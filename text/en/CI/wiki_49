<text>Michael Carruth (born 9 July 1967) is a southpaw Irish Olympic boxer from Dublin. He is best known for winning the welterweight gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. He turned professional in 1994 and retired in 2000.

*Final: Defeated Juan Hernández Sierra (Cuba) on points, 13-10.

Carruth&#x27;s medal was Ireland&#x27;s first ever gold medal in boxing, only a couple of hours after teammate Wayne McCullough had to settle for the silver in bantamweight. It was also the first Olympic gold medal for Ireland since Ronnie Delaney won the Men&#x27;s 1500m event at the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne.

Within a few days of Carruth winning his Olympic medal the Government of Ireland announced that Carruth has been instantly promoted to sergeant within the Irish Army in recognition of his achievement at the Olympics. And, on the day of his return to Ireland, local pubs dropped the price of beer to that of 1956.

==Professional boxing==
Carruth turned professional in 1994 after taking leave from his job as a soldier in the Irish Army. He was trained by the former Irish boxing great Steve Collins. He had limited success as a professional, losing in both of his defining professional bouts, in 1997 against Mihai Leu for the WBO Welterweight title and in 2000 against Adrian Stone for the IBO Light Middleweight title. He retired in 2000, after the loss to Stone, with a career professional record of 18-3-0.

==Media==
In 2006, he competed on the TV series &quot;Celebrity Jigs &#x27;n&#x27; Reels&quot;.

Carruth was an expert boxing analyst for RTÉ&#x27;s Olympic coverage in 2008, 2012 and 2016.

In 2020, Carruth appeared in the fourth season of the Irish edition of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He and his professional partner, Karen Byrne, were eliminated on 3 February 2020.

==Involvement in Gaelic games==
During his short spell as senior Westmeath county football team manager, Brendan Hackett appointed Carruth as masseur in 2009.

<text>Wayne Pocket Rocket McCullough (born Wayne William McCullough; 7 July 1970) is a former professional boxer from Northern Ireland who competed from 1993 to 2008. He held the WBC bantamweight title from 1995 to 1997, becoming the first boxer from Northern Ireland to win a WBC championship.

He challenged six times for world titles at super-bantamweight and featherweight. As an amateur, McCullough represented Ireland at the 1992 Summer Olympics, winning a bantamweight silver medal. He also won flyweight gold at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, representing Northern Ireland.

In addition to McCullough&#x27;s dogged, relentless attacking style, he was renowned for his durable chin, having fought two of boxing&#x27;s biggest punchers in Naseem Hamed and Érik Morales, and gone the full distance with both of them. During his bout with Morales in 1999, HBO commentator Larry Merchant joked, &quot;If you look in the dictionary, under &#x27;Tough Irishman&#x27;, you&#x27;ll find a picture of Wayne McCullough&quot;. McCullough was never once knocked down in his professional career. He also stopped the late Arturo Gatti as an amateur.

==Amateur career==
McCullough had a very successful amateur career, amassing a record of 319 wins and 11 defeats, with over 100 wins coming by way of knockout. As an amateur living in the staunchly loyalist Shankill Road area of Belfast, he was selected by the island-wide Irish Amateur Boxing Association to participate in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea, and asked to carry the Irish flag as the youngest member of the team (aged 18). He went on to win a silver medal for Ireland at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

Representing Northern Ireland at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, Auckland, he won a gold medal and carried the Northern Ireland flag in the closing ceremony. The medal ceremony for his Commonwealth title was marked by an unusual incident. A technical problem with the public address system made it impossible to play the recording of the song &quot;Danny Boy&quot;, used instead of an anthem for medalists from Northern Ireland. The New Zealand official in charge of the sound, Bob Gibson, promptly took the microphone and sang the song unaccompanied. In 1990, McCullough also won a Bronze medal at the World Cup, becoming Ireland&#x27;s only ever World Cup medal winner, in Mumbai, India.

==Professional career==

In 1993 McCullough moved to Las Vegas to train under Eddie Futch, who agreed to train him after seeing him at the Olympics. McCullough always fought in neutral colours and did not have national anthems played at his fights; his supporters in Northern Ireland include Protestants and Catholics. Within a year of turning pro, he had won the North American Boxing Federation title.

On 30 July 1995, less than 2½ years since his pro debut, he won the WBC championship by beating the champion Yasuei Yakushiji in Nagoya, Japan to become Ireland&#x27;s first ever WBC world champion. He was the first fighter from Ireland or the UK to travel to Japan and win a belt. He defended his title twice before vacating the belt and moving up in weight to challenge WBC super bantamweight champion Daniel Zaragoza, but lost via a split decision in the WBC &quot;Fight of the Year&quot;. After this fight, his wife Cheryl and Stuart Campbell began to manage his career when his original manager, Mat Tinley, became a boxing promoter.

McCullough unsuccessfully challenged champions Naseem Hamed in 1998, and Erik Morales in 1999. In each of those exciting &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; contenders, he broke his opponent&#x27;s lengthy run of KO wins while taking them the distance. Hamed had knocked out 18 opponents straight before McCullough, and was 30–0 at the time with 28 knockouts to his credit. Morales had knocked out 9 of his previous 9 opponents and was 34–0 at the time, also with 28 knockouts. Morales stated that McCullough gave him one of the top three fights of his career and almost quit on his stool after the 9th round (according to &quot;Ring&quot; magazine).

In October 2000, McCullough was to return to his native Belfast for a homecoming fight. Two days before the fight was scheduled to take place, he was told that he had a cyst on his brain, he couldn&#x27;t fight again and that one more blow to the head could kill him. McCullough flew back to Las Vegas and was advised by the Nevada Commission to visit the neurosurgery department at UCLA for a more thorough investigation. Within a few weeks the doctor at UCLA, Neil Martin, called to say he had consulted with some of the top neurosurgeons in the US and they had come to the conclusion that the cyst was not on his brain, but in a space between the brain and the skull – called the arachnoid mater – and that he saw no reason for him to give up his boxing career.

Nevertheless, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC) continued to deny him a licence. He was relicensed in Nevada and fought again in January 2002. After a very public battle, the BBBC could no longer deny him a licence and later that same year McCullough stepped back into a British ring under the Frank Warren Promotions banner. Thereafter he had mixed success, winning five fights but losing to Scott Harrison and Mexican world champion Óscar Larios on two occasions. The result of his first fight with Larios is widely disputed.

On 17 August 2005 McCullough was appointed the first WBC World Ambassador for Peace and Goodwill in Sports. In September 2005, McCullough became a United States citizen. In November 2005, McCullough released his autobiography, &quot;Pocket Rocket: Don&#x27;t Quit&quot;, in the UK and Ireland. He went on a publicity tour to promote the book, which reached Number 2 on the best sellers list.

In 2007, McCullough joined the Ultimate Fighting Championship organisation as a PR associate, to promote Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). He currently trains fighters both in boxing and MMA and is setting up his own charity – IHOW.

===McCullough vs. Martínez===
In 2007 McCullough signed to fight Spain&#x27;s Kiko Martínez who had just defeated Bernard Dunne at the Point Depot, Dublin for the European super bantamweight title. The fight between McCullough and Martínez was due to take place at Belfast&#x27;s Kings Hall on 1 December 2007.

McCullough had not fought for over two years and the Kings Hall venue was sold out for the fight. It was agreed that the non-title fight would take place at . However, on the day before the fight there was uproar during the weigh-in and the fight was cancelled by the BBBC amid chaotic scenes.

McCullough had already contracted to fight at 2 lb over the championship weight and he weighed in at . However, Martínez failed to make the agreed weight and was 1.75 lb over the agreed weight.

Martínez was given a couple of hours to shed the excess weight, but did not return to weigh in again and the scales were closed by a BBBC official. A furious McCullough stated &quot;I couldn&#x27;t believe it. He comes in over the weight and then after being asked to take it off he just sits there and does nothing. I just can&#x27;t believe what has happened. I was ready to fight and ready to win and he comes in that much over the weight.&quot;

===Retirement===

On 20 June 2008, McCullough fought Juan Ruiz in the Cayman Islands, his first fight in three years. He lost in six rounds, retiring on his stool. Despite being ahead on two of three judges&#x27; scorecards after six rounds, he told his corner he could not go on due to an injury he had sustained in training. The Belfast boxer took the microphone and revealed this might be his swansong. He said: &quot;I think this could be my last fight and I want to thank you all for coming. I am disappointed with the way things went but I just felt I could not go on.&quot;

==Personal life==
McCullough married Cheryl Rennie, also from Belfast, in May 1993.

In 1998, Wayne&#x27;s daughter Wynona was born in Las Vegas. She uses Wy Mac as her stage name and is carving a name for herself in the world of entertainment as a singer / songwriter and content creator. 

In May 2004, McCullough changed his name by deed poll.

<text>David Eli Lilienthal (July 8, 1899 – January 15, 1981) was an American attorney and public administrator, best known for his presidential appointment to head Tennessee Valley Authority and later the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). He had practiced public utility law and led the Wisconsin Public Utilities Commission.

Later he was co-author with Dean Acheson (later Secretary of State) of the 1946 &quot;Report on the International Control of Atomic Energy,&quot; which outlined possible methods for international control of nuclear weapons. As chair of the AEC, he was one of the pioneers in civilian management of nuclear power resources.

==Early life==
Born in Morton, Illinois in 1899, David Lilienthal was the oldest son of Jewish immigrants from Austria-Hungary. His mother Minna Rosenak (1874–1956) came from Szomolány (now Smolenice) in Slovakia, emigrating to America at age 17. His father Leo Lilienthal (1868–1951) was from Hungary, serving several years in the Hungarian army before emigrating to the United States in 1893. Minna and Leo were married in Chicago in 1897, then moved to the town of Morton, where Leo briefly operated a dry goods store.

Leo&#x27;s business ventures took the family several places. Young David was raised principally in the Indiana towns of Valparaiso and Michigan City. Although he spent part of his sophomore year in Gary, he graduated in 1916 from Elston High School in Michigan City.

==Education and marriage==
Lilienthal attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1920. There he joined Delta Upsilon social fraternity and was elected president of the student body. He was active in forensics and won a state oratorical contest in 1918. He also gained distinction as a light heavyweight boxer.

After a summer job in 1920 as a reporter for the Mattoon, Illinois, &quot;Daily Journal-Gazette&quot;, Lilienthal entered Harvard Law School. Although his grades were average until his third and final year at Harvard, he acquired an important mentor in Professor Felix Frankfurter, later an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court.

While at DePauw, Lilienthal met his future wife, Helen Marian Lamb (1896–1999), a fellow student. Born in Oklahoma, she had moved with her family to Crawfordsville, Indiana, in 1913. They were married in Crawfordsville in 1923, after Helen had completed her M.A. at Radcliffe while David was a law student at Harvard.

==Law practice and public appointment==
With a strong recommendation from Frankfurter, Lilienthal entered the practice of law in Chicago in 1923 with Donald Richberg. Prominent in labor law, Richberg gave Lilienthal a major role in writing his firm&#x27;s brief for the appellants in &quot;Michaelson v. United States&quot;, 266 U.S. 42 (1924), a landmark case in which the Supreme Court upheld the right of striking railroad workers to jury trials in cases in which they were charged with criminal contempt. Richberg also assigned Lilienthal to write major parts of what became the Railway Labor Act of 1926. In 1925, Lilienthal assisted criminal defense lawyers Clarence Darrow and Arthur Garfield Hays in their successful defense of Dr. Ossian Sweet, an African-American physician tried in Detroit for killing a white man who was part of a mob that attacked Sweet&#x27;s home. Afterward, Lilienthal wrote about the case and issues of self-defense in an article published in &quot;The Nation.&quot;

Lilienthal left Richberg&#x27;s firm in 1926 to concentrate on public utility law. He represented the city of Chicago in the case of &quot;Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co.,&quot; 282 U.S. 133 (1930), in which a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court resulted in a refund of $20,000,000 to telephone customers who had been overcharged. From 1926 to 1931, Lilienthal also edited a legal information service on public utilities for Commerce Clearing House. 
In 1931, Wisconsin&#x27;s reform-minded Republican governor, Philip La Follette, asked him to become a member of the state&#x27;s reorganized Railroad Commission, renamed that year as the Public Service Commission.

As the commission&#x27;s leading member, Lilienthal expanded its staff and launched aggressive investigations of Wisconsin&#x27;s gas, electric and telephone utilities. By September 1932, the commission achieved rate reductions totaling more than $3 million affecting over a half-million customers. But, its attempt to force a one-year 12.5 percent rate cut on the Wisconsin Telephone Company, a subsidiary of AT&amp;T, was quashed by the Wisconsin courts. After La Follette&#x27;s defeat in the 1932 Republican primary election, Lilienthal began putting out feelers for a federal appointment in the newly elected Democratic administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

==Lilienthal and the Tennessee Valley Authority==
Lilienthal was one of the first directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). He earned his credentials for the appointment working under labor lawyer Donald Richberg and as an appointed member of the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin under Wisconsin&#x27;s governor Philip La Follette. His TVA appointment was also aided by the persistent lobbying of his old law professor Frankfurter. .

The TVA was established by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 for flood control and locally controlled hydroelectric power on the Tennessee River. It was a massive project controlled by a public corporation designed to modernize the rural, Southern communities within the Tennessee Valley. The TVA also established extensive education programs, and a library service that distributed books in the many rural hamlets that lacked a library. The TVA was locally and nationally controversial. On the national scale, opponents led by Wendell Willkie said the TVA was a form of state socialism, and the other utility companies it competed against were also against the project. Local people were both apprehensive but also hopeful about the changes the TVA would bring.

In his role as one of the TVA directors, Lilienthal was skilled at administration and at creating supporters for the project.

In part due to his experience at the TVA, Lilienthal was often sent abroad to work on water development projects. Lyndon Johnson dispatched him to the Mekong River to oversee development of a project there. He was also sent to India and Pakistan to report on the dispute between the two nations, for &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine. He thought that the Kashmir dispute was intractable, but there were other areas of mutual concern of the two nations were agreement could be found - such as the allotment of the water of the Indus River. He reported this idea to the World Bank, and its president, Eugene R. Black, agreed with the assessment. This led to the Indus Water Treaty, which to this day governs water allocation between India and Pakistan.

==Atomic energy==
Following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the end of World War II and victory by the Allies, Lilienthal was fascinated and appalled by the information he soon absorbed about the power of the new weapon.

In January 1946, U.S. Under Secretary of State Dean Acheson asked Lilienthal to chair a five-member panel of consultants to a committee including him and four others, who were to advise President Harry S. Truman and Secretary of State James F. Byrnes about the position of the United States at the United Nations on the new menace of nuclear weapons. At the time, the US held a monopoly on these weapons.

Lilienthal described the purpose of Acheson&#x27;s request:

Those charged with foreign policy -- the Secretary of State (Byrnes) and the President -- did not have either the facts nor an understanding of what was involved in the atomic energy issue, the most serious cloud hanging over the world. Comments...have been made and are being made...without a knowledge of what the hell it is all about -- literally! 
Lilienthal quickly found out even more about the atomic weapon, and wrote in his journal:

No fairy tale that I read in utter rapture and enchantment as a child, no spy mystery, no &quot;horror&quot; story, can remotely compare with the scientific recital I listened to for six or seven hours today.

... I feel that I have been admitted, through the strangest accident of fate, behind the scenes in the most awful and inspiring drama since some primitive man looked for the very first time upon fire.

The result of the panel was a 60-page &quot;Report on the International Control of Atomic Energy&quot;, better known as the Acheson-Lilienthal Report. Released in March 1946, it proposed that the United States offer to turn over its monopoly on nuclear weapons to an international agency, in return for a system of strict inspections and control of fissile materials. It was a bold attempt to formulate a workable idea for international control (and implicitly assumed that the United States was far ahead of the Soviet Union in atomic weapons development and could remain in that position even if the Soviets violated the agreement). However Truman then decided to appoint Bernard Baruch to present the plan to the United Nations; Baruch changed some provisions of it, ending up with a proposal that the Soviets could not accept and that was vetoed by them. (As it happened, the Soviets were determined to proceed with their own atomic bomb program and were unlikely to accept either plan.)

Subsequently, the United States established the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to provide civilian control of this resource. Lilienthal was appointed as chair of the AEC on October 28, 1946, and served until February 15, 1950, one of the pioneers of civilian control of the American atomic energy program. He intended to administer a program that would &quot;harness the atom&quot; for peaceful purposes, principally atomic power. Lilienthal gave high priority to peaceful uses, especially nuclear power plants. However coal was cheap and the power industry was not interested. The first plant was begun under Eisenhower in 1954.

As chairman of the AEC in the late 1940s, during the early years of the Cold War, Lilienthal played an important role in managing relations between the scientific community and the U.S. Government. The AEC was responsible for managing atomic energy development for the military as well as for civilian use. Lilienthal was responsible for ensuring that the Commander-in-Chief would have the use of a number of working atomic bombs. Lilienthal did not have as much enthusiasm for this task as some in Washington, and in particular he received steady criticism from Senators Brien McMahon and Bourke B. Hickenlooper, the chairman and ranking member of the United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, for not pursuing the task with sufficient vigor. Indeed, in 1949 Hickenlooper raised charges that Lilienthal had engaged in &quot;incredible mismanagement&quot; and tried to have him removed as chairman; Lilienthal was cleared of wrongdoing but was left politically weakened within Washington.

Once the Soviet Union had successfully tested its own atomic bomb, Lilienthal became a central figure in the August 1949–January 1950 debate within the U.S. government and scientific community over whether to proceed with development of the hydrogen bomb. President Truman appointed a three-person special committee, composed of Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson in addition to Lilienthal as head of the AEC, to formulate a report to him on the matter. Lilienthal was opposed to development, stating among other reasons that the proposed weapon lacked a clear political or strategic rationale and that being overly dependent upon nuclear forces (rather than maintaining strong conventional forces) was an unwise security posture. But Lilienthal failed to marshal bureaucratic support for his position, in part due to the limitations of secrecy preventing him from finding allies and in part due to his repeated arguments losing their effectiveness. The three-person committee made its recommendation to proceed to Truman in a meeting on January 31, 1950, and the president so ordered. (Lilienthal ended up appearing to support the recommendation on the surface while trying to register a dissent as well, a confused situation that only became more so with additional memoranda filed after the fact and with conflicting recollections among the participants in years to follow.)

In his 1963 book, &quot;Change, Hope and the Bomb&quot;, Lilienthal criticized nuclear developments, denouncing the nuclear industry&#x27;s failure to have addressed the dangers of nuclear waste. He suggested that a civil atomic energy program should not be pursued until the &quot;substantial health hazards involved were eliminated&quot;. Lilienthal argued that it would be &quot;particularly irresponsible to go ahead with the construction of full scale nuclear power plants without a safe method of nuclear waste disposal having been demonstrated&quot;. However, Lilienthal stopped short of a blanket rejection of nuclear power. His view was that a more cautious approach was necessary.

==Lilienthal as businessman==
Lilienthal&#x27;s resignation from the Atomic Energy Commission took effect on February 15, 1950. He was concerned that after years of relatively low-paying public service, he needed to make some money to provide for his wife and two children, and to secure funds for his retirement.

After undertaking a lecture tour, he worked for several years as an industrial consultant for the investment bank Lazard Freres. Later he wrote about this period in his journal:

A serene life apparently isn&#x27;t the thing I crave. I live on enthusiasm, zest; and when I don&#x27;t feel it, the bottom sags below sea level, and it is agony, no less.

In 1955, he formed an engineering and consulting firm called Development and Resources Corporation (D&amp;R), which shared some of the TVA&#x27;s objectives: major public power and public works projects. Lilienthal leveraged the financial backing of Lazard Freres to found his company. He hired former associates from the TVA to work with him. D&amp;R focused on overseas clients, including the Khuzistan region of Iran, the Cauca Valley of Colombia, Venezuela, India, southern Italy, Ghana, Nigeria, Morocco, and South Vietnam.

==Lilienthal as writer==
In May 1917, as a 17-year-old college freshman, Lilienthal met a young lawyer in Gary, Indiana. He later recalled that the lawyer

noticed how seriously I was looking at life in general and suggested as a remedy for this and as a source of amusement and self-cultivation the keeping of a diary of a different sort than the &quot;ate today&quot; &quot;was sick yesterday&quot; variety, but rather a record of the impressions I received from various sources; my reactions to books, people, events; my opinions and ideas on religion, sex, etc. The idea appealed to me at once. 

Lilienthal kept such a journal until the end of his life. In 1959, Lilienthal&#x27;s son-in-law Sylvain Bromberger suggested that he consider publishing his private journals. Lilienthal wrote to Cass Canfield at Harper &amp; Row; the company eventually published his journals in seven volumes, appearing between 1964 and 1983. They received largely positive reviews.

Lilienthal&#x27;s other books include &quot;TVA: Democracy on the March&quot; (1944), &quot;This I Do Believe&quot; (1949), &quot;Big Business: A New Era&quot; (1953) and &quot;Change, Hope and the Bomb&quot; (1963).

==Last years==
His company D&amp;R struggled financially during Lilienthal&#x27;s final years. A promised infusion of capital from the Rockefeller family was not fully realized. The company was dissolved in the late 1970s.

Lilienthal resided in Princeton, New Jersey during his final years. In 1980, Lilienthal had two separate serious health problems. He had a bilateral hip replacement and cataract surgery in one eye. He needed crutches and a cane at various points. The recovery period from the eye surgery forced him to neither read nor write aside from his final journal entry on January 2, 1981.

He died on January 16, 1981. News of his death, and his obituary, appeared on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
In 1951 Lilienthal was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences, of which he was also an elected member. He was also a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

During his lifetime Lilienthal received honorary degrees from Boston University, DePauw University, Lehigh University, and Michigan State College.

<text>The RAF Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) comprised the light bombers of 1 Group RAF Bomber Command, which took part in the Battle of France during the Second World War. Before hostilities began, it had been agreed between the United Kingdom and France that in case of war, the short-range aircraft of Bomber Command would move to French airfields to operate against targets in Nazi Germany. The AASF was formed on 24 August 1939 from the ten squadrons of Fairey Battle light bombers of 1 Group under the command of Air Vice-Marshal Patrick Playfair and was dispatched to airfields in the Rheims area on 2 September 1939.

The AASF was answerable to the Air Ministry and independent of the British Expeditionary Force. For unity of command, the AASF and the Air Component of the BEF (Air Vice-Marshal Charles Blount), came under the command of British Air Forces in France (Air Vice-Marshal Arthur Barratt) on 15 January 1940. Using the bombers for attacks on strategic targets in Germany was set aside, due to Anglo-French reluctance to provoke German retaliation; attacks on German military forces and their communications were substituted.

The Battle of France began with the German invasion of the Low Countries on 10 May 1940. The Battle squadrons suffered 40 per cent losses on 10 May, 100 per cent on 11 May and 63 per cent on 12 May. In 48 hours the number of operational AASF bombers fell from 135 to 72. On 14 May the AASF made a maximum effort, 63 Battles and eight Bristol Blenheims attacked targets near Sedan. More than half the bombers were lost, bringing AASF losses to 75 per cent. The remaining bombers began to operate at night and periodically by day, sometimes with fighter escorts.

From 10 May to the end of the month, the AASF lost 119 Battle crews killed and 100 aircraft. Experience, better tactics and periods of bad weather from 15 May to 5 June led to losses of 0.5 per cent, albeit with a similar reduction in effectiveness. On 14 June, the remaining Battles returned to Britain; the Hurricane squadrons returned on 18 June and rejoined Fighter Command. The AASF was dissolved on 26 June, the Battles returning to 1 Group, Bomber Command, to prepare for operations against a German invasion, along with the rest of the Royal Air Force.
==Background==

===1930s Anglo-French air policy===

Once British rearmament began, the air policy of the British government was to have air defences sufficient to defeat an attack and an offensive force equal to that of the . With no land border to defend, British resources had been concentrated on radar stations, anti-aircraft guns and increasing the number of the most modern fighter aircraft. If Germany attacked, the British intended to take the war to the Germans by attacking strategically important targets with its heavy bombers, types unsuitable for operations in direct support of land forces. Implementation of the policy required a considerable number of first-class fighter aircraft to defeat an attacker and bombers to destroy ground targets.

In 1938 the RAF expansion programme was intended to provide means for the air defence of Britain and for counter-offensive operations against Germany. Army co-operation received few resources and no plans were made for RAF participation in mass land operations or the dispatch abroad of large expeditionary air forces. The Western Plan was devised by the Air Ministry for mobilisation and the deployment of squadrons to their wartime airfields. Provision was made for the immediate dispatch of an Advanced Air Striking Force of ten squadrons to France, followed by a second echelon of ten more. Refuelling facilities were also planned for other squadrons, the arrangements for transport and servicing being co-ordinated with the army; thought was also given to basing squadrons in Belgium if it was invaded by Germany.

In February 1939, the British Cabinet had authorised joint planning with the French and preferably with Belgium and the Netherlands in case of war with Germany, Italy and Japan. Two weeks before the first meeting, Germany occupied the rump of Czechoslovakia; war preparations took on a new urgency and staff conversations began on 29 March 1939. Agreement was reached with France to base the AASF on French airfields but only to bring them closer to their intended targets in Germany, until longer-range types became available. French strategy emphasised the defence of the national territory and Allied efforts were expected to give equal emphasis but the British refused to stake everything on the success of a defensive campaign against the Germans in France. The different circumstances of the two countries led the French to rely on a mass land army, with air defence a secondary concern, the was hampered in the late 1930s by the slow progress of its re-equipment, lacking anti-aircraft guns, sufficient fighter aircraft and the means to detect and track enemy aircraft. Observation services relied on civilian telephones and in October 1939, the had only which were considered (obsolete).

Lack of aircraft led the French to advocate a bombing policy of tactical co-operation with the armies, attacking German forces and communications in the front line, rather than the strategic bombing of Germany, for fear of retaliation. From the spring of 1939, arrangements were made for the reception of the AASF, the defence of British bases in France, bombing policy in support of ground forces confronting a German attack in the Benelux countries, and operations against the . A supply of British bombs was dumped near Reims, disguised as a sale to the . Discussion of strategic air operations against the German war economy was delayed because the British did not expect to begin such operations as soon as war was declared and because the French had no bombers capable of them. In the last days of peace, the Cabinet limited air bombardment strictly to military objectives which were narrowly defined and a joint declaration was issued concerning the policy of following of the rules of war pertaining to poison gas, submarine warfare and air attacks on merchant ships to avoid provoking the Germans while the Anglo-French air forces were being built up.

===August 1939===


On 24 August 1939, the British government gave orders for the armed forces partially to mobilise and on 2 September No. 1 Group RAF (Air Vice-Marshal Patrick Playfair) sent its ten Fairey Battle day-bomber squadrons to France according to plans made by the British and French earlier in the year. The group was the first echelon of the AASF and flew from RAF Abingdon, RAF Harwell, RAF Benson, RAF Boscombe Down and RAF Bicester. Group headquarters became the AASF when the order to move to France was received and the home station HQs became 71, 72 and 74–76 Wings. The Bristol Blenheims of No. 2 Group RAF were to become the second echelon as 70, 79 and 81–83 Wings, flying from RAF Upper Heyford, RAF Wattisham, RAF Watton, RAF West Raynham and RAF Wyton; 70 Wing with 18 and 57 squadrons was converting from Battles to Blenheims and intended for the Air Component once the re-equipment was complete. On 3 September, as the British government declared war on Germany; the AASF Battle squadrons were getting used to their French airfields, which were somewhat rudimentary compared to their well-developed Bomber Command stations, some having to wait for the French to deliver aviation fuel.

===September===
Strategic bombing operations did not take place as the and Allied strategic bombers observed a tacit truce. The French tried to divert German resources from their Invasion of Poland with the Saar Offensive (7–16 September), in which the Battle squadrons were to participate. The main bases were too far inside Germany but airstrips, supply dumps and reserves would be well within the range of the Battles. The British and French governments feared that they had more to lose by courting German retaliation but this deprived the Battle squadrons of a chance to test their equipment and tactics. The preparations did establish that Battles would attack targets within of the front line, including fleeting opportunities, much against the wishes of Group Captain John Slessor, a former director of plans at the Air Ministry, who stressed that the Battle crews were not trained for close support. Other officers thought that &quot;...it is about as far as the Battle will be able to get with a return ticket&quot;. Playfair had the fuselage fuel tank removed from AASF Battles and the bomb bays were to be modified to carry anti-personnel bombs, once the equipment arrived in November.

====Battle reconnaissances====
Neither the French nor the British wanted the AASF to sit idle and the Battles began to conduct &quot;high-altitude&quot;, formation, photographic reconnaissance sorties, to map the German front line but the Battle had a service ceiling of only and needed to be much lower for formation flying. Battle sorties began on the morning of 10 September, three aircraft of 150 Squadron flying inside Allied lines and photographing obliquely. On 19 September the Battles began to fly beyond the front line, at first, then . Playfair, mindful of the risk, tried to time sorties to coincide with French fighter operations in the vicinity and wanted close escorts if German fighters were around. Three Battles from 103 Squadron and three from 218 Squadron reconnoitred on 17 September, the Battles encountering intermittent anti-aircraft fire (). Bad weather led to a two-day lull, then on 20 September, three Battles from 88 Squadron west of Saarbrücken were attacked by three Messerschmitt Bf 109Ds, which shot down two of the Battles, whose defensive fire was ineffective. One Battle pilot crash-landed and his aircraft caught fire, killing the observer and gunner; the other Battle crashed the same way and the third Battle was hit in its fuel tanks and incinerated the crew.

Playfair concluded that Battles should receive an escort anywhere near the front line but the Air Ministry rejected the claim that more fighters were necessary and he had to ask the French instead. The Chief of Staff of the French Air Force (), Joseph Vuillemin, was short of fighters but promised to help, provided the British helped themselves. At a meeting on 28 September, the British representative repeated the claim that tight formation-flying and collective firepower obviated the need for escorts and Vuillemin cancelled French co-operation. Two days later, five Battles from 150 Squadron on reconnaissance near Saarbrücken and Merzig, were attacked by eight Bf 109Es. The Battles closed up but four were shot down, most in flames. The surviving Battle pilot ran for home and crashed on landing but saved his crew. The squadron immediately fitted its aircraft with an extra rear-facing gun in the bomb-aiming position against attacks from below and behind; in England the Air Ministry blamed the Battle, rather than faulty tactics and equipment and declared it obsolete. For protection against fighter attack, of armour for each aircraft was rushed to France and 15 and 40 squadrons returned to Britain to convert to Blenheims, being replaced by 114 and 139 squadrons which were already flying the type.

====AASF tactical changes====
In England, discussions for a second-generation Battle took place and the AASF was ordered to train Battle crews for low-level tactical operations to avoid the Bf 109s. The crews practised attacks on road vehicles from as low as and some rehearsals had fighter escorts, a new task given to the AASF Hurricane squadrons. Air Chief Marshal Robert Brooke-Popham, having been dug out of retirement, inspected the RAF in France and organised a meeting with Fairey, the Air Ministry and crews from 150 Squadron, to discuss protection against ground fire. Fairey considered that the Battle was already at its maximum weight and that self-sealing fuel tanks and armour could be added only by reducing the bomb load or range. No one in Britain knew that the Battles in France had already had their fuselage fuel tanks removed, which had saved . Fairey suggested a ventral machine-gun [], crew armour [], safer fuel tanks [], armour around the rear gunner [] and another of ventral (underside) armour. Only the armour plate for the rear gunner needed to be manufactured and the extra armour was ordered to France as soon as possible.

Battle fuel tanks were to be given the French coating, which easily plugged holes from rifle-calibre bullets and also gave some protection from cannon fire. would use up the allotted for fuel tank protection and was still under test but of armour plates were added to the rear of the tanks against hits from behind. On 18 December, twenty-two Vickers Wellington medium bombers were sent to attack German ships in the Battle of the Heligoland Bight and eighteen were lost, many shot down in flames; some of those not shot down ran out of fuel from punctured fuel tanks. The fitting of self-sealing tanks became a crisis measure for Bomber Command and took precedence over the Battle modification, especially as their existing tanks had been armoured against hits from behind and the conversion was put back to March 1940. The extra armour decided on in September was apparently sent to France but never fitted to the Battles.
Operational instructions issued by BAFF included a warning that

The RAF had tried to improve the performance of its aircraft; streamlining the Blenheim had added to its speed. To remedy the vulnerability of Battles to attacks from below, a rear-facing machine-gun was fitted to the bomb-aimer&#x27;s position but &quot;...it needed a contortionist to fire it...&quot;,

Fairey designed a well in the floor of the bomb aiming position for the gunner to lie prone facing the rear but the change would need three months for development and testing. With in storage, the modifications could be done at Fairey and the aircraft swapped with those in France without interfering with AASF operations but the idea was shelved.

To speed production of new aircraft, a review was held to strip existing machines of superfluous equipment and the committee suggested that for tactical bombing, the Battle autopilot [], night flying gear [], bomb sight [] and the navigator–bomb-aimer [] could be dispensed with, saving , which would allow the fitting of more forward-firing guns with no net increase in weight. The Air Ministry prevaricated and the equipment was not removed, the Ministry even deprecating the use of the existing forward-firing gun, which was supposed to be reserved for engagements with German fighters, not for strafing unless circumstances were &quot;exceptional&quot;.

===October–December===
On 11 October, Dornier Do 17 bombers begin to cross the lines at high altitude and one flew at over the 1 Squadron AASF fighter base at Vassincourt Airfield, only to be shot down near Vausigny. The two Hawker Hurricane fighter squadrons (67 Wing) were part of the AASF to provide fighter protection for their bases, with another squadron of Hurricanes in England made available as a reinforcement. The second echelon squadrons of 2 Group, with seven Blenheim squadrons and two Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bomber squadrons, stood ready to move to France if the Germans attacked. At on 8 November, 73 Squadron shot down a Do 17, its first victory of the war. To counter the high-flying Dorniers, seven fighter sectors were established on 21 November in (ZOAN, &quot;Air Zone North&quot;) and (ZOAE, &quot;Air Zone East&quot;) and on 22 November, 1 Squadron shot down two Do 17s in the morning, a Hurricane force-landing after being hit in the engine; early in the afternoon, three Hurricanes over Metz shared a Heinkel He 111 with the , one Hurricane being damaged in a collision with a French fighter; 73 Squadron claimed two Dorniers shot down and one damaged, shared with French fighters. For most of December, flying was washed out by bad weather but on 21 December, two Hurricanes shot down a French Potez 637 over Villers-sur-Meuse, with only one survivor. The next day, five Bf 109s bounced three 73 Squadron Hurricanes and shot two down.

==Prelude==

===January 1940===

====British Air Forces in France====


On the declaration of war, the Air Component had come under the command of Lord Gort the Commander-in-Chief of the BEF and the AASF remained under Bomber Command control but based with the . Thought had been given to liaison and Air Missions had been installed in the main Allied headquarters but training exercises showed that communication was inadequate. In January 1940, command of the AASF and the Air Component was unified under Air Marshal Arthur Barratt as Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief British Air Forces in France (BAFF), the Air Component being detached from the BEF while remaining under its operational control and Bomber Command losing the AASF, since the Battle would not be used for strategic bombing. Barratt was charged with giving &quot;full assurance&quot; to the BEF of air support and to provide the BEF with

Since the British held only a small part of the Western Front, Barratt was expected to operate in the context of the immediate needs of the Allies. In France the new arrangement worked well but the War Office and the Air Ministry never agreed on what support should be given to the Field Force of the BEF. When Air Marshal Charles Portal replaced Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt as AOC-in-C Bomber Command on 3 April, he prevented the second echelon of the AASF from going to France, with the agreement of Cyril Newall, the Chief of the Air Staff. Portal took the view that fifty Blenheims attempting to attack an advancing army, using out of date information, could not achieve results commensurate with the expected losses. On 8 May he wrote,

The airfields occupied by the first echelon were still being equipped for operations and would become dangerously congested if the second echelon arrived. Barratt questioned the wisdom of an assumption that because the AASF was behind the Maginot Line, mobility was less important than that of the Air Component and approval was eventually given to make the AASF semi-mobile. Motorisation came too late and the AASF had to beg, steal or borrow French vehicles when squadrons changed base; by late April, the AASF strength had risen to 

===February–March===

More flying was possible in January but the air forces spent most of February on the ground, with many of the aircrews on leave. The weather became much better for flying and on 2 March a Dornier was shot down by two 1 Squadron Hurricanes, one of the British pilots being killed while attempting a forced landing after being hit in the engine by return fire; next day, British fighters shot down a He 111. On 3 March, two 73 Squadron pilots escorting a Potez 63 at spotted seven He 111s higher and gave chase, only to be attacked by six Bf 109s. A Bf 109 overshot one of the Hurricanes, which fired on it as it drew ahead. The Bf 109 fell, leaving a trail of black smoke, the eleventh victory for the squadron. The Hurricane was hit by the third Bf 109 and the pilot only just managed to reach a French airfield and make an emergency landing. On the morning of 4 March, a 1 Squadron Hurricane shot down a Bf 109 over Germany and later, three other Hurricanes of the squadron attacked nine Messerschmitt Bf 110s north of Metz and shot one down. On 29 March, three Hurricanes of 1 Squadron were attacked by Bf 109s and Bf 110s over Bouzonville, a Bf 109 being shot down at Apach and a Bf 110 north-west of Bitche; a Hurricane pilot was killed trying to land at Brienne-le-Château.

===April – 9 May===

In April the usual reconnaissance flights were flown by the and larger formations of fighters patrolled the front line with formations of up to three squadrons () flew at high altitude as far as Nancy and Metz. Reconnaissance aircraft began to cross the front line in squadron strength to benefit from greater firepower on the most dangerous part of the journey, before dispersing towards their objectives. Hurricanes shot down a Bf 109 on 7 April at Ham-sous-Varsberg and on 9 April, when the Germans began Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Denmark and Norway, Bomber Command aircraft were diverted to operations in Scandinavia.

The Battle squadrons took over leaflet raids over Germany by night and suffered no losses. The situation was unchanged until the night of 9/10 May, when the heavy guns of the German and French armies began to bombard the Maginot and Siegfried lines. In early May, the AASF had bombers, serviceable bombers being Battles. The had less than a hundred bombers, cent of which were obsolescent. The in the west had aircraft, including about and bombers.

==Battle of France ()==

===10 May===


As dawn broke, German bombers made a coordinated, hour-long attack on 72 airfields in the Netherlands, Belgium and France, inflicting severe losses on the Belgian Air Component (/) and the Royal Netherlands Air Force (). The bombers flew in formations of three to thirty or but had least effect on the British and French airfields, over which British and French fighters intercepted the German raiders. Nine British-occupied bases were attacked to little effect. Hurricanes of 1 Squadron at Vassincourt patrolled the Maginot Line from and shot down a for one Hurricane damaged. At A Flight shot down a Do 17 near Dun-sur-Meuse for one Hurricane crash-landed.

At Rouvres, two 73 Squadron Hurricanes attacked three bombers over the airfield, damaging one for a Hurricane forced down damaged. At four Hurricanes attacked eleven Do 17s near the airfield, one Hurricane landing in flames with a badly burned pilot and one Hurricane returning damaged. More Hurricanes were scrambled and shot down two Do 17s; a He 111 was shot down soon afterwards. Orders to 73 Squadron led to it moving back from its forward airfield to its base in the AASF area around Reims. From England, 501 Squadron with Hurricanes, landed at Bétheniville to join the AASF and went into action within the hour against forty He 111 bombers. A transport aircraft ferrying pilots and ground crews of the squadron crashed on landing; three pilots were killed and six injured.

The AASF bomber squadrons remained on the ground waiting for orders but the bombing policy established by (GQG, French supreme headquarters) did not require the British to obtain permission. At Chauny, Barratt and d&#x27;Astier discussed reconnaissance reports and Barratt ordered the AASF into action. A German column had been reported in Luxembourg by a French reconnaissance aircraft several hours earlier. The French bomber squadrons received orders and counter-orders; some were sent to make low-level demonstrations to reassure French troops and were intercepted by German fighters. The AASF squadrons had been on stand-by since one flight in each squadron at thirty minutes&#x27; readiness and the other at two hours&#x27; notice. Barratt called General Alphonse Georges, commander of the (North-eastern Theatre of Operations) to tell him that the AASF would commence operations but it took until to give the order to attack. Thirty-two Battles from 12, 103, 105, 142, 150, 218 and 226 squadrons flew at low altitude, in groups of two to four bombers, to attack German columns.
The first wave of eight Battles had support from five 1 Squadron and three 73 Squadron Hurricanes, sent to patrol over Luxembourg City and clear away German fighters. The two fighter formations were not co-ordinated and had only vague orders; the three 73 Squadron Hurricanes attacked a force of unescorted German bombers and were bounced by German fighters before they made contact with the Battles. At least one Hurricane was shot down; the 1 Squadron pilots saw what was happening but were too low to help. The Battles hedge-hopped towards the target and evaded the German fighters but were well inside the range of German ground fire. Two Battles of 12 Squadron attacked at and one was shot down as it approached the target. The second aircraft strafed the column with its forward firing machine-gun and bombed; neither side could miss and the Battle crash-landed in a field. Another twelve Battles were shot down and most of the rest were damaged.

In the afternoon, a second raid by 32 Battles flying at was intercepted by Bf 109s and ten were shot down by fighters and ground fire. During the day, AASF and Air Component Hurricanes claimed sixty aircraft shot down, sixteen probables and twenty-two damaged. The AASF Hurricanes had flown 47 sorties and been provisionally credited with shooting down six bombers for five Hurricanes shot down or force-landed in a 1999 analysis by Cull et al. No aircraft From Bomber Command in England appeared because the British state was preoccupied with a change in government. Barratt requested support and during the night, Bomber Command sent 36 Wellington bombers to attack Waalhaven and eight Whitleys from 77 and 102 squadrons bombed transport bottlenecks into the southern Netherlands at Geldern, Goch and Aldekirk; Rees and Wesel over the German border also being raided.

===11 May===
As Blenheim crews of 114 Squadron at Vraux were preparing to take off to attack German tank columns in the Ardennes, nine Dornier 17s appeared at treetop height and bombed them, destroying several Blenheims, damaging others and causing casualties. From 9:30 to 10:00 a.m., eight Battles in two flights of two sections each from 88 and 218 squadrons took off to raid German troop concentrations near Prüm over the border in the Rhineland, where two panzer divisions had begun their westwards advance the day before and were already past Chabrehez, inside Belgium. From Reims, the Battles had to make a flight diagonally across the front. The raid was the first by 88 Squadron whose two sections flew apart to give the Germans no time to react. The Battles received constant small-arms fire at the vicinity of Neufchâteau, from Prüm, for the rest of the run in.

An aircraft from the second flight force-landed near Bastogne, two more were lost near St Vith and the surviving aircraft had aviation fuel sloshing around the cockpit. The pilot turned back and attacked a column in a narrow valley at Udler, short of Prüm but the bomb-release gear had been damaged and they did not drop; the Battle managed to return and land at Vassincourt; the four Battles from 218 Squadron disappeared. An attack planned for the afternoon was cancelled because of the dusk and because Barratt wanted to conserve his aircraft. The Belgian government appealed to the Allies to destroy the Albert Canal bridges around Maastricht but the Germans had already installed many anti-aircraft guns there. Six Belgian Battles out of nine from Aeltre were shot down around noon along with two of the six fighter escorts, the three survivors causing no damage.

Six Blenheims from 21 Squadron and six from 110 Squadron in Britain attacked next from . As the bombers approached they met massed anti-aircraft fire and broke formation to attack from different directions, only to spot Bf 109s and form up again. Four Blenheims were shot down, the rest were damaged and no bomb hit the target. Ten modern French LeO 451s from GB I/12 and II/12, escorted by Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters, attempted the first French bombing raid of the battle and set fire to some German vehicles but failed to hit the bridges. The Morane pilots attacked the German fighters and claimed five Bf 109s for four Moranes; one LeO 451 was shot down and the rest so badly damaged that they were out of action for several days. During the night of Barratt called on Bomber Command to attack transport targets around München-Gladbach; Whitleys from 51, 58, 77 and 102 squadrons, with Handley Page Hampdens from 44, 49, 50, 61 and 144 squadrons sent but five Hampdens returned early and only half the remainder claimed to have bombed the target. A Whitley and two Hampdens were shot down, the Hampden crews, minus a pilot, making their way back to Allied lines. AASF, Air Component and 11 Group Hurricane pilots claimed 55 German aircraft and French fighter pilots in the RAF area claimed another 15; analysis by Cull et al. in 1999 attributed 34 aircraft destroyed or damaged to Hurricane pilots.

===12 May===
At nine Blenheims of 139 Squadron flew from Plivot to attack a German column near Tongeren but were intercepted by fifty Bf 109s and lost seven aircraft, two of the crews returning on foot after crash-landing. At Amifontaine, 12 Squadron was briefed for an attack on the bridges near Maastricht with six Battles. After the fate of the Belgian Battles the day before, the commander asked for volunteers and every pilot stepped forward; the six crews on standby were chosen. Two Blenheim squadrons were supposed to attack Maastricht at the same time as a diversion and twelve Hurricane squadrons were flying in support but half of these were operating to the north-west and the others were only flying in the vicinity, except for 1 Squadron, which was to sweep ahead to clear away German fighters.

Three Battles of B Flight were to attack the bridge at Veldwezelt and three from A Flight the bridge at Vroenhoven. Two Battles of A Flight took off at and climbed to ; short of Maastricht, the aircraft received anti-aircraft fire, surprising the crews with the extent of the German advance. The Hurricane pilots saw about fighters above them and attacked; three Bf 109s and six Hurricanes were shot down. During the diversion, A Flight dived over the Maastricht−Tongeren road towards the Vroenhoven bridge covered by three Hurricanes; a Bf 109 closed on the leading aircraft, then veered off towards the second Battle, which hid in a cloud. The Battles dived from and bombed at , both being hit in the engine, one Battle came down in a field, the crew being captured. The second Battle crew, having shaken off the Bf 109, saw bombs from the first Battle explode on the bridge and hit the water and the side of the canal. The second Battle pilot turned away, amidst a web of tracer from ground fire and was then damaged by a Bf 109 fighter, which was hit by the rear gunner. The port fuel tank caught fire and the pilot ordered the crew to parachute, then he noticed that the fire had gone out. The pilot nursed the bomber home but ran out of fuel a few miles short and landed in a field; the observer got back to Amifontaine but the gunner was taken prisoner.
Five minutes later, B Flight attacked the bridge at Veldwezelt, having flown over Belgium in line astern at . One Battle was hit and caught fire before the target, bombed and crashed near the canal; the pilot, despite severe burns, saving the crew who were taken prisoner. A second Battle was hit, zoomed while on fire, dived into the ground and exploded, killing the crew. The third Battle made a steep turn near the bridge then dived into it, destroying the west end. German engineers began immediately to build a pontoon bridge and as they worked, from 2 Group in England attacked the bridges at Maastricht; ten were shot down. At 18 Breguet 693s from with Morane 406 fighter escorts, attacked German tank columns in the area of Hasselt, St Trond, Liège and Maastricht, losing eight bombers. Twelve attacked columns around Tongeren, St Trond and Waremme at and survived, despite most being damaged. Late in the afternoon, fifteen Battles flew against German troops near Bouillon and six were shot down. During the night, forty Blenheims of 2 Group flew in relays against the Maastricht bridges with few losses.
At daybreak, the AASF intervened against the German advance towards Sedan for the first time, three Battles of 103 Squadron attacking a bridge over the Semois, the last river east of the Meuse. The Battles flew very low and all returned. At about three more Battles of 103 Squadron attacked the bridge from and were intercepted by Bf 110s. The Battles dived and hedge hopped to evade the fighters, bombing a pontoon bridge next to the ruins of the original one from and escaped. At about three Battles of 150 Squadron bombed German columns around Neufchâteau and Bertrix, east of Bouillon. One Battle was hit and crashed in flames but the other two bombed from and got away. At three 103 Squadron Battles and three from 218 Squadron attacked in the vicinity of Bouillon, the Battles from 103 Squadron flew individually at low altitude and those of 218 Squadron flew in formation at . General cover was provided by the Hurricanes of 73 Squadron but they claimed only a Henschel Hs 126 reconnaissance aircraft. Two 218 Squadron Battles were shot down and the low-level attack by 103 Squadron cost two more, the squadron having decided to dispense with the navigator for tactical operations by day.

The surviving crew of 103 Squadron had also protected themselves by attacking a German tank column west of the target and running for home, according to the original AASF intention of attacking the first German troops encountered. Barratt had decided that the Battles should attack from a higher altitude to reduce losses from ground fire but Playfair took the view that the new policy would not put the Battles out of range of German anti-aircraft guns. The results of the operations on 12 May gave no conclusive evidence that low attacks were more dangerous. In the sixty sorties since 10 May the Battle squadrons had lost thirty aircraft and in the evening Barratt was ordered to conserve his force until the climax of the battle. In emergencies, the AASF was supposed to maintain a tempo of two-hourly attacks but this proved impossible; Playfair was ordered to rest the Battle squadrons on 13 May. By the end of the day, the AASF had been reduced to bombers. AASF and Air Component Hurricanes were confronted by more Bf 109s over the front line, which shot down at least six of the twelve Hurricanes lost. The two Hurricane forces claimed 60 aircraft shot down, probables or damaged, 27 being attributed to them in a 1999 analysis.

===13 May===

Fifty miles north of the AASF bases, opposite the Meuse, the crisis of the battle of France was beginning but the Allied commanders still took the threat in the Low Countries more seriously. Four Battles of 76 Wing (12, 142 and 226 squadrons) received orders to attack German forces around Wageningen, about away but the raid was cancelled because of poor weather. Later on, seven Battles of 226 Squadron were sent to attack German columns near Breda, distant, despite the target being closer to 2 Group in England. No German columns were found; the Battles demolished a factory to block the road and returned safely. Information about the situation on the Meuse began to arrive and AASF HQ began to consider a contingency plan to evacuate to fields further south. During the evening a French pilot saw Germans crossing the Meuse at Dinant and landed at the closest airfield, which was that of 12 Squadron, quickly to attack the German crossing but Playfair and Barratt refused to allow it. Pressure on the British air commanders increased during the night when Billotte, the commander of 1 (1st Army Group), told Barratt and d&#x27;Astier that &quot;victory or defeat hinges on the destruction of those bridges&quot;.

The Germans had bridgeheads on the west bank of the Meuse and were building pontoon bridges to get tanks across; Barratt and d&#x27;Astier were told to make an immediate maximum effort. Unlike the permanent bridges attacked on 12 May, the German defences at Sedan were not organised, pontoon bridges were more vulnerable and the river was much closer to the AASF airfields, commensurately further from bases. French bombers made two attacks during the day and overnight the French bombed German rear areas as the Blenheims of 2 Group attacked the Maastricht bridges and railways at Aachen and Eindhoven. Ten Hurricanes were lost on 13 May, six to German fighters for a claim of five Bf 109s and five Bf 110s, double the number eventually attributed to AASF and Air Component Hurricanes. Total claims were 37 German aircraft shot down, probables or damaged and 21 recognised in a 1999 analysis. The Hurricane squadrons in France lost 27 fighters shot down, 22 to German fighters, seventeen pilots being killed and five wounded. The Hurricane pilots claimed 83 German aircraft shot down, probables or damaged, later reduced to 46.

===14 May===

At dawn, six Battles from 103 Squadron attacked the pontoon bridges over the Meuse at Gaulier north of Sedan; all of the Battles returned and some of the pontoons may have been damaged. At four Battles attacked and returned safely. French apprehensions about the situation grew so intense that the decided to use obsolete Amiot 143 bombers and Barratt agreed to make a maximum effort. Hurricane squadrons from the north were to reinforce the AASF but still only to fly in the general area of the Battles, along with French fighters. After a second attack from the French-based bombers, 2 Group were to attack from England. At eight Breguet 693s with fifteen Hurricane and fifteen Bloch 152 fighter escorts, attacked German tanks at Bazeilles and the pontoons between Douzy and Vrigne-sur-Meuse, against scattered anti-aircraft and fighter opposition; all the Breguets returned. Just after noon, eight LeO 451s and 13 Amiot 143s, also with fifteen Hurricane and fifteen Bloch 152 fighter escorts, attacked the same targets; three Amiots and a LeO were shot down. From to 45 Battles attacked the bridges and 18 Battles with eight Blenheims went for German columns. Some Battles flew higher, reducing the risk of hits by ground fire but became more vulnerable to fighters.

Five Battles from 12 Squadron dive-bombed a crossroads at Givonne against intense small-arms fire; two managed to bomb but only one Battle returned. Eight Battles from 142 Squadron flew in pairs to attack pontoon bridges from low level, with bombs fuzed for an eleven-second delay. The pairs were intercepted by German fighters; four Battles were shot down, at least two by fighters. Six Battles of 226 Squadron tried to dive-bomb bridges at Douzy and Mouzon against ground fire. One aircraft was damaged and turned back; three more Battles were shot down. Seven of eleven 105 Squadron Battles were lost, one Battle landing at a nearby friendly airfield and another crash-landing. Four Battles of 150 Squadron were shot down by Bf 109s and eight from 103 Squadron bombed the Meuse crossings at very low altitude or in dives. Three of the Battles were hit but made it back to Allied areas before crash-landing, all but one pilot surviving and returning to base. Ten of eleven Battles from 218 Squadron were shot down and of the ten Battles from 88 Squadron, four against bridges and six to bomb columns between Bouillon and Givonne, nine returned. The operation was the costliest to the RAF of its kind in the war; 35 Battles and been lost from the 63 that attacked, along with five of the eight Blenheims. The survivors were too damaged to form a second wave. The afternoon attacks had met a much more effective defence than those in the morning and flying higher over German ground fire had only brought the Battles closer to German fighters. The German XIX Corps reported constant air attacks, which delayed the crossing of German tanks to the west bank of the Meuse.

Every serviceable French bomber had flown and since 10 May, the had lost and aircraft. Six Battle crews returned on foot through German-held territory but had been killed or captured and more than had been lost in four days. As night fell, 28 Blenheims of 2 Group attacked the bridges and seven were shot down, two coming down behind Allied lines. In Britain, Air Marshal Hugh Dowding, the Air Officer Commanding RAF Fighter Command, was heard by the War Cabinet. Having already been ordered to send another to France, Dowding urged that French requests for another ten fighter squadrons be refused. The Air Staff took the losses as proof that tactical operations were not worth the cost, despite it working so well for the and judged the Battle to be obsolete, despite the Blenheim, German Junkers Ju 87s and the new French Breguet 693 bombers suffering just as many losses when not escorted by fighters. Playfair and Barratt appealed for more fighters and got a few, despite calls from everywhere for more. Barratt demanded that no more Battles be sent to France without self-sealing tanks, until then the Battles would fly at night, except for crews with insufficient training in night operations or in dire emergency. The AASF and Air Component Hurricane squadrons lost 27 aircraft, 22 to German fighters, 15 pilots being killed and four wounded; another two pilots had been killed and one wounded by German bombers or ground fire. The Hurricane squadrons claimed 83 German aircraft shot down, probables or damaged and a 1999 analysis attributed 46 German aircraft shot down or damaged to British fighters.

===15–16 May===

After the AASF losses from 10 to 14 May, attacks on the Meuse bridgeheads on 15 may were made by Bomber Command squadrons based in England. German mobile forces broke out of the bridgehead at Sedan and at twelve Blenheims from 2 Group attacked German columns around Dinant as fighters patrolled in relays. The RAF sent another sixteen Blenheims escorted by fighters at to attack bridges near Samoy and German tanks at Monthermé and Mezières, from which four Blenheims were lost. On the night of 15/16 May around twenty Battles flew and attacked targets at Bouillon, Sedan and Monthermé for no loss but cloud cover made navigation and target finding difficult; fires were seen but no-one claimed great results. Night raids were suspended because Barratt expected the Germans to wheel south behind the Maginot Line and ordered the Battle squadrons to retire to bases around Troyes in southern Champagne, where during the Phoney War, the army and the RAF had prepared many airfields and several grass airstrips.

Amid confusion caused by attacks on the airfields and roads full of troops and refugees, the squadrons began to retire, many of the Battle squadrons being out of action during the moves, which turned out to be unnecessary when the Germans drove west instead of south. The AASF had been deemed a static unit, protected by the Maginot Line and was short of even its slender establishment of vehicles. The AASF was fortunate that the Germans went west and there was time to fetch most of the equipment, using lorries from the US, loaned by the French, at the behest of the Air Attaché in Paris. Drivers were rushed by air from Britain but were ignorant of the vehicles, the locations of AASF bases and of France; someone loaded the starting handles, jacks and tools onto a lorry bound for the west coast, under the impression that they were superfluous spare parts. BAFF losses since 10 May stood at nine Westland Lysander army co-operation aircraft and Bomber Command had lost mainly from 2 Group. The AASF and Air Component Hurricanes suffered 21 losses, half to Bf 110s and three to Bf 109s; five pilots were killed, two taken prisoner and four were wounded. The Hurricane pilots claimed fifty German aircraft, later reduced to 27 in a 1999 analysis by Cull, Lander and Weiss. On 16 May, 103 Squadron moved south with full bomb loads to be ready as soon as they reached their new airfields but the squadron was not called on and the other squadrons seemed more intent on settling in, despite the disaster on the Meuse.

===17 May===

The nine surviving Blenheims of 114 and 139 squadrons were transferred to the Air Component, reducing the AASF to six Battle and three Hurricane squadrons; for the next five days the AASF flew few missions, most of those at night. The AASF withdrew 105 and 218 squadrons and their remaining aircraft, transferring crews to the other squadrons; 218 Squadron aircraft flying a few sorties before the change. The six squadrons sent away as much superfluous equipment as possible to become more mobile. In March, 98 Squadron had been based at Nantes as a reserve and sent crews and machines to the active squadrons; a shortage of gunners led to pilots substituting for gunners on occasion.

Bomber Command sent twelve Blenheims of 82 Squadron, 2 Group, to attack German troops at Gembloux; ten were shot down by Bf 109s, an eleventh by ground fire and the twelfth Blenheim was damaged but returned to base. As the French armies and the BEF in the north retreated, the most exposed Air Component squadrons were withdrawn westwards and land line communication with BAFF HQ, south of the German advance, was cut. No Hurricane pilots of the AASF and Air Component were killed but a minimum of 16 Hurricanes were shot down and one pilot taken prisoner. AASF, Air Component and 11 Group squadrons claimed 55 aircraft shot down, probables or damaged, later reduced to 28 by Cull et al.

===18 May===
On 18 May, the Battle squadrons were on stand-by but only 103 Squadron flew operations. Targets around St Quentin were bombed but low-level attacks were abandoned and with no escorts, the Battles flew in ones and twos, as fast as possible, trusting the manoeuvrability of the Battle rather than formation flying to evade fighters, despite being slower. The Battles flew at and attacked in a shallow dive, dropping bombs with instantaneous fuzes at , all the Battles returning safely. At least of 33 Hurricanes were shot down, most by German fighters. Seven pilots were killed, five made prisoners of war and four were wounded. Half of the Hurricane claims were against bombers and many Bf 110 fighters were shot down. The AASF and Air Component Hurricane squadrons claimed 97 German aircraft shot down, probables or damaged, later reduced by Cull et al. to 46.

===19 May===

On 19 May the German advance in the north led to the Air Component squadrons retiring to English bases. The AASF had 12, 88, 103, 142, 150, 218 and 226 squadrons available. D&#x27;Astier tried to support a counter-attack near Laon but the AASF HQ was out of touch and Barratt knew nothing about it, except that German forces were west of the Montcornet–Neufchâtel road. Reconnaissance reports showed Barrett that to the east, more German troops were north of Rethel, a threat to the AASF bases further south. All but 226 Squadron was ordered make another maximum effort by day against anything they saw on the roads between Rethel and Montcornet. The wrong orders reached 88 Squadron which attacked around Hirson an important point on the German drive west and 142 Squadron attacked targets far to the west around Laon, near the French counter-attack, unlike the Rethel area, which was on the fringe of the offensive and only occupied by screening forces. Six Battles of 150 Squadron attacked road columns near Fraillicourt and Chappes, against intense anti-aircraft fire, one Battle being shot down and two making emergency landings at the nearest Allied airfield.

The crews of 218 Squadron bombed tanks and lorries near Hauteville and Château-Porcien, in shallow dives from , bombing from . Plenty of targets were found by 88 Squadron, which with 218 Squadron, lost no aircraft. Three Battles from 142 Squadron were shot down west of Laon and of six Battles sent by 12 Squadron north or Rethel, which found only one column to bomb, two were lost, one to a Bf 109. Six Battles sent by 103 Squadron bombed targets near Rethel and all came home. The raids did nothing to assist the French counter-attack. The Germans had passed beyond the terrain bottlenecks further east. Six Battles out of 36 had been lost, an 18 per cent loss rate, which was a considerable improvement on the 50 per cent rate from 10 to 15 May but still unsustainable. Barratt concluded that night operations were the only way to save the Battle force from destruction. AASF and Air Component Hurricanes claimed 112 aircraft shot down, probables or damaged (later reduced to 56) for a loss of 22 Hurricanes shot down and 13 force-landed, 24 to Bf 109s, which suffered 14 losses to the Hurricanes. Eight fighter pilots were killed, seven were wounded and three taken prisoner.

===20–21 May===
On 20 May, 73 Squadron flew one patrol, 1 Squadron and 501 Squadron being rested and no claims or losses were recorded for the AASF Hurricanes. The commander of 1 Squadron asked for the relief of tired pilots and eight were immediately dispatched, three arriving the same day. Twelve Hurricanes were shot down, at least seven by ground fire while strafing, three pilots being killed and one captured. AASF and Air Component pilots claimed forty aircraft shot down, probables or damaged, reduced by Cull et al. to 18. During the night of 20/21 May, 38 Battles were sent to bomb communications around Givet, Dinant, Fumay, Monthermé and Charleville-Mézières. Misty conditions around the Meuse led to few of the Battle pilots claiming hits on anything and one aircraft was lost.

Delays caused to the German advance in these areas could have no effect on the beginning of the Battle of Arras to the west. On 21 May the AASF and Air Component Hurricanes claimed four German aircraft, three of which were recognised by Cull et al. for the loss of three Hurricanes, one pilot killed, one taken prisoner and one returned unhurt. The AASF bombers resumed daylight operations and in small flights, attacked German columns near Reims, indirectly supported by in the area. Attacks near Le Cateau and St Quentin could have been on French troops by mistake; poor air reconnaissance made it difficult to find German forces or their objectives.

===21–22 May===
By 21 May only some Lysanders of 4 Squadron, attached to the BEF HQ, were all that remained of the Air Component in France. The pilots of the three AASF Hurricane squadrons were exhausted; most of those of 1 Squadron were replaced and 73 Squadron pilots were given notice of their replacement; the 501 Squadron pilots, having been in France only since 10 May, had to remain. Hurricane reconnaissance sorties discovered the German advance from Cambrai on Arras and the ground control organisation at Merville ordered the Hurricanes that were airborne to strafe them. When fighter squadrons on escort or fighter patrol turned for home, they began to use up their ammunition on ground targets. The fighters still attacked in tight formations and in fifty ground strafing sorties by the various British fighter forces in France, six Hurricanes were shot down and three pilots killed. With another French counter-attack due on 22 May, the British government demanded a greater effort from the RAF and during the night of 21/22 May, 41 Battles were prepared for raids on the Ardennes.

After 12 Battles had taken off, the Air Ministry cancelled the operation in favour of operations against German tanks the next day around Amiens, Arras and Abbeville, contrary to Barratt&#x27;s better judgement since tanks were small targets and the Battles would have to attack at low altitude. The patrol area was too far west to assist a French counter-attack south from Douai on Cambrai but might have had an effect on operations on the right flank of the BEF. The weather remained poor and after several aircraft took off, the raid was cancelled. Tanks were seen around Doullens, Amiens and Bapaume and one was claimed for the loss of one Battle and three damaged. Night operations by the AASF Battles against the Meuse crossings had suffered few losses but their training in night flying during the spring could not overcome the inherent difficulty of night navigation and target-finding. During the night of 22/23 May, 103 Squadron was sent to bomb Trier on the German–Luxembourg border.

===23 May===
Uncertainty about supporting an Allied attack south or a retreat north, led to a dawn attack by the Battles of 88 Squadron around Douai and Arras being cancelled. To prevent an Allied retreat to Dunkirk being cut off, bombing of German forces to the north-west of Arras was substituted. The new raid was cancelled too and 88 Squadron flew no operations. In the evening, 12 Squadron sent four Battles against German tanks on the Arras–Doullens road but the weather deteriorated and only two of the bombers found the target; all four aircraft returned. Four Battles from 150 Squadron made dive-bombing attacks on German tanks at the exit of the village of Ransart and vehicles in a stand of trees further south. One pilot dropped his bombs then strafed another column that appeared, despite considerable anti-aircraft fire; the four Battles survived despite all being met with ground fire. During the night of 23/24 May, bombed targets at Monthermé and Fumay. Hurricane squadrons of the AASF and Fighter Command engaged Bf 109s in northern France, claiming six fighters for the loss of ten Hurricanes.

===24 May===
No Battle sorties were flown in daylight on 24 May but 73 Squadron Hurricanes from Gaye, near Paris, claimed one aircraft for the loss of two aircraft and one pilot severely burned. During the night of 24/25 May attacked railway sidings at Libramont, supply dumps at Florenville and the roads through Sedan, Fumay, Givet and Dinant with incendiary, anti-personnel and the usual bombs. AASF night sorties equalled the number flown by the but the Battles were not built for night operations, despite night flying training; the limited view from the observer compartment left the occupant unable to help with target finding. Long-range night sorties were extremely difficult and attacks on the Meuse crossings from the AASF bases around Troyes required a cross-country flight. The Allied retreats towards the Channel and North Sea coasts had multiplied the number of supply routes open to the German armies, making attacks on the Meuse crossings less effective.

===25 May===

During the night of 24/25 May, Frankfurt, over the German border, was attacked by 88 Squadron, a -flight of dubious relevance to the fighting in France and Belgium. During the day, about ten Battles from various squadrons attacked German columns on the Abbeville–Hesdin road for the loss of one aircraft, the crew managing to return on foot. A Do. 17 was claimed by 73 Squadron for the loss of a Hurricane and the capture of the pilot. The code-breakers at Bletchley Park in Britain decrypted a signal received at that revealed a conference of commanders to be held on the next day at the HQ of VIII at in Roumont Château, near Libramont in southern Belgium. The commanders were to arrive at Ochamps airfield nearby, at The Air Ministry received the information in the early hours of 25/26 May and signalled the news to the AASF HQ at sending more intelligence at 

===26 May===

Playfair passed orders to attack the château to 103, 142 and 150 squadrons at At fourteen Battles set off for the target supported by Hurricanes of 1 and 73 squadrons. The Battles flew in pairs and the leader of the two aircraft from 150 Squadron lost touch with the other Battle after flying into a storm and descending to . The crew eventually found the château, dive-bombed from and were attacked by four Bf 110s. The pilot tried to hedge hop out of danger and as the Bf 110s gave chase, the pilot fired at a German aircraft he had spotted landing on an airstrip ahead. The Battle was hit on the armour fitted to resist fighter attack and the robust structure of the airframe protected the crew; the pilot only had to force-land after the engine was hit. The pilot escaped but the navigator and gunner were taken prisoner. Most of the rest of the Battles found the target through the stormy weather and damaged the building but inflicted no casualties; a second Battle was lost. No more operations in daylight took place until 28 May.

===27–31 May===


The Battles were grounded by bad weather on the night of 26/27 May but thirty-six Battles attacked German targets on the night of 27/28 May and a fire was reported after bombing near Florenville in Belgium. The weather grounded most of the Battles on the nights of 28/29, 29/30 and 30/31 May. On 28 May, the AASF Battles began attacks to obstruct the massing of German forces on the Somme and Aisne rivers and the bridgeheads that the Germans had established over the Somme. The Battles used &#x27;40 lb&#x27; (17.5 kg) General Purpose bombs during the day for the first time, which could be dropped from lower altitudes and were better suited to hit dispersed troops and vehicles. Six Battles from 226 Squadron attempted to dive-bomb targets around Laon but failed because of low cloud; three tried to bomb targets through gaps in the clouds and three returned with their loads.
Six more 226 Squadron Battles were later sent to bomb roads into Amiens and Péronne; one Battle returned early after a window panel blew out and the others used steep or shallow dive-bombing attacks against German troops and transport. After bombing, the pilots used their forward-firing guns to strafe every German column they saw, one pilot taking five minutes to exhaust his ammunition; a Battle received damage but all returned. Day sorties were also flown by 103 Squadron on the roads into Abbeville, one Battle being severely damaged. Since 14 May the Battles had flown about by day for a loss of nine aircraft, a considerable reduction in the rate of loss, despite the lack of self-sealing fuel tanks, un-armoured engines and no close fighter escorts. The weather prevented night sorties on 26/27 May but on the night of 27/28 May, 36 Battles flew and fires were reported in Florenville; no other effect being reported by the crews. Few sorties were flown on the nights of 28/29, 29/30 and 30/31 May because of bad weather. Since 10 May, the AASF had lost more than 119 aircrew killed and 100 Battles.

===1–4 June===

Operations in May proved the French right about the lack of fighters in the AASF. Fighter sweeps and patrols in the general area of Battle operations had proved futile and Barratt judged that day bombers needed close escort by fighters if they were to survive. From 20 May, Blenheims flying from Britain had received fighter escorts and losses were drastically reduced; the AASF Battles needed similar protection, which needed more than the three Hurricane squadrons in the AASF could provide. Barratt informed the Air Ministry that either the fighters should be reinforced or the bombers returned to Britain. Given the desperate situation in France, returning the AASF was unthinkable; Barrett said that fighter reinforcements were needed immediately, not as a panic measure once the German offensive resumed. The British government and the Air Staff refused to weaken British air defences and not even the AASF fighter losses were replaced. Barrett decided to limit daylight Battle sorties to the number that the Hurricanes could escort and keep the rest on night raids. The build-up in the bridgeheads over the Somme at Péronne, Amiens and Abbeville continued, making German intentions obvious.

The AASF bombers were used to interrupt the German preparations on the night of 31 May/1 June but some Battles were sent to attack the Rhine bridges near Mainz, about east of the Meuse; military traffic over the Rhine could have no influence on the battle soon to begin. The night bombing operations were also disrupted by the move of the Battle squadrons from their airfields around Troyes to Tours, west of Paris, from the nearest German forces and from targets in the Ardennes. The Battles of 12 Squadron moved from Échemines to Sougé then had to use Échemines as an advanced base. During the move, 103 Squadron and 150 Squadron flew several sorties against targets in the Ardennes and Germany. On the night of 3/4 June, 12 Squadron made five sorties to attack rail lines near Trier. On 4 June, the Battle squadrons were stood down for maintenance and to &quot;settle in&quot;; (the German offensive) began the next day.

===5 June===

The German offensive over the Somme and Aisne rivers began with attacks from the three Somme bridgeheads but made only slow progress. The AASF had only 18 operational Hurricanes, which were used to protect Rouen, not the Battles, which had not flown in daylight since 28 May. With the French sending every aircraft that could fly, Barratt returned the Battles to day operations. At eleven Battles of 12 and 150 squadrons flew to Échemines and then attacked German columns on the Péronne–Roye and Amiens–Montdidier roads, although many crews failed to find targets and some mistakenly attacked French tanks near Tricot, behind the French front line; when French fighters arrived, the Battles flew away. The AASF used Échemines and other airfields as advanced bases for day and night operations, despite complaints that their facilities were inadequate and that Échemines had recently been in use as a main base. The German armies managed to enlarge the Somme bridgeheads by nightfall and during the night, Battles attacked the airfield near Guise but eleven were sent to attack targets in the Ardennes, which was of no help to the French armies.

===6 June===

The three AASF fighter squadrons were brought up to strength, although this was still inadequate; a deputation from the 51st (Highland) Division even went to BAFF HQ to demand more protection. Nine Battles escorted by a flight of 73 Squadron Hurricanes flew from Échemines at against German columns on the Ham–Péronne road and others bombed tanks and vehicles between Péronne and Roye. Bf 109s got past the Hurricanes and attacked two Battles, which survived. Raids that night were made closer to the front line, where they might have immediate effect and the pilots flew lower. After the first take-off attempt at and a second try at were interrupted by German air raids, Battles from Harbouville attacked a Somme bridge north of Abbeville, roads out of the town and roads out of Amiens. As the Battles returned, several were damaged by another German raid. At Échemines, twelve Battles set forth to bomb airfields and other targets near Laon, Guise ad St Quentin, one pilot claiming hits on a fuel dump.

===7 June===
The French defence of the Abbeville bridgehead began to collapse and attacked German columns between the Abbeville–Blangy-sur-Bresle road and Poix. The aircraft bombed from to evade ground fire, despite having an escort of only a flight of 73 Squadron Hurricanes, the escorts flying close to the bombers. When escorted, the Battles flew to the target in formation, attacked singly then ran for home. When there were no escorts, the Battles flew alone or in pairs, relying on their manoeuvrability to escape from fighters, their targets being close enough to the front line to give them a chance of escaping; several Battles survived fighter attacks but three were shot down. In the first three days of the Battles flew sorties for a loss of three aircraft, despite their lack of self-sealing fuel tanks, armour against ground fire and the small number of escorts. The reduction in losses was marked but day bomber groups had managed to fly over the same period; Barrett remained reluctant to risk more Battles in daylight.

===8 June===
As the French armies resisted the German offensive from the Somme bridgeheads, reconnaissance aircraft returned with evidence of an imminent German attack over the Aisne, to the east of Paris. During the night of 7/8 June, eight Battles attacked the Laon–Soissons road after German tanks were reported there. The battle at the Somme bridgeheads retained its priority because the French defences north of Amiens began to collapse (Poix having been lost on the evening of 7 June). The AASF fighters was reinforced by 17 Squadron and 242 Squadron from England. At twelve Battles attacked German columns in the area of Abbeville, Longpré, Poix and Aumale, escorted by seven Hurricanes; three Battles were shot down. At another eleven Battles attacked, despite the Hurricane escorts not arriving; the pilots reported that German tank and lorry columns were long and one Battle was lost. As one pilot returned, he saw a formation of Ju 87s, dived through and damaged one with his forward-firing gun, before the Bf 109 escorts intervened. The Battle gunner was wounded but claimed a Bf 109 and the pilot made an emergency landing south of Paris; another Battle pilot engaged a Junkers Ju 88 bomber.

===9 June===
During the night of 8/9 June, several Battles bombed the Somme river crossings at Amiens and Abbeville and seven sorties were flown against the forests around Laon, north of the Aisne, where German troops were thought to be hiding. During the day, an attack on German tank, artillery and troop columns near Argueil was planned but the diversion of the Hurricanes to protect the 51st (Highland) Division led to the operation being cancelled. The expected German offensive over the Aisne began against determined French resistance but on the Channel coast the Germans had broken through. During the night of 9/10 June, ten Battles were sent to bomb bridges and roads at Abbeville and Amiens; nine more, using the staging post of Échemines airfield, attacked targets around Laon, dropping incendiary bombs on Forêt de Saint-Gobain to the north-west, to flush out German troops thought to be using it for cover; lorries driving south with their lights on were also attacked.

===10 June===


In the afternoon, twelve Battles attacked German units close to Vernon on the Seine, about half-way between Paris and Rouen; one Battle being shot down and another damaged, thought to have been hit by a Hurricane. Later, twelve Battles attacked German motorised columns near Vernon, the Seine bridge at Pont Saint-Pierre and a bridge further south. Despite all of the Hurricanes being sent to cover the evacuation from Le Havre, no Battles were lost. Fifteen Battles returned to the targets after dark and seven were sent to attack the Meuse crossings.

===11 June===
The speed of the German advance made the use of forward airfields like Échemies as staging posts redundant and at dawn, twelve Battles bombed crossings over the Seine to the south of Les Andelys. Around noon, six Battles with fighter escort bombed more bridges in the area and in the afternoon sixteen escorted Battles made similar attacks. After a request from the French naval commander of Le Havre to attack tanks thought to be close to the port, six Battles with escorts tried to attack the tanks but found only a couple of armoured vehicles and attacked them. It turned out that the tanks had reached the coast and turned north to cut off the French IX Corps and the 51st (Highland) Division. The Battles had managed a minimum of 38 sorties for a loss of two or three aircraft. Another 24 Battles were to continue the attacks downstream of Rouen that night but only five took off due to inclement weather.

===12 June===

At dawn, nine Battles bombed the roads around Les Andelys, north of the Seine, for no loss. In the afternoon, twelve Battles bombed a concentration of vehicles blocked at the Pont de l&#x27;Arche railway bridge south of Le Manoir, forcing German engineers repairing it to flee for cover, also for no loss. An attack on pontoon bridges south of Les Andelys was thought to have failed in poor visibility, for one Battle lost and one damaged. Fifteen Battles were sent out to the roads around Les Andelys that night but only seven reached the target in more poor weather.

===13 June===

At dawn six battles flew an armed reconnaissance around Vernon and Évreux, again in poor weather, which made it impossible for fighters to escort the Battles, difficult for the crews to see targets and for German fighters to intercept them; there were no losses. Later operations by 150 and 142 squadrons flew in such bad weather that two of the seven Battles turned back. No fighters were able to escort the Battles but four were shot down by Bf 109s. During the afternoon, the French armies east of Paris tried to retreat from the Aisne to the Marne but two armies diverged and German armoured columns rushed through the gap, overtaking some of the retreating French troops past Montmirail towards the Seine. At twelve Battles attacked German columns south of the town and lost one Battle. So many German tanks and vehicles were seen that a maximum effort was made by 26 Battles without fighter escort, except for some French fighters which were busy protecting French bombers. The British bombers were attacked by German fighters and by massed anti-aircraft fire; six Battles were shot down, four by fighters. Paris was declared an open city and with the end of hostilities likely, preparations to evacuate the AASF continued as the Battle squadrons fought on without fighter escorts.

===14–26 June===

Fighter operations were still hampered by bad weather and escorting the Battles was made more difficult by a disorganised retirement of the fighter squadrons to other airfields. Ten Battles tried to attack German columns near Évreux but could not find them in the bad weather. Two Battles reconnoitring near Paris spotted two Bf 109s on Le Coudray airfield, south of Paris, which had just been evacuated. During the afternoon, nine Battles attacked woods around Évreux and the airfield, two of the three bombers from 12 Squadron being shot down. Orders arrived from Britain during the evening for the Battle squadrons to return and the AASF bombers prepared to make a final attack at dawn. Ten Battles of 150 Squadron, with Hurricane escorts, took off to attack targets around Évreux again.

The Battles landed at Nantes, the first stage of their departure from France; the other squadrons managed twelve sorties and took the same route back; about sixty Battles returning to Britain. The remaining AASF Hurricanes began operations to cover evacuations from ports on the French Atlantic coast. Nantes, Brest and St Nazaire were defended by 1, 73 and 242 squadrons, St Malo and Cherbourg by 17 and 501 squadrons flying from Dinard in Brittany and later the Channel Islands. On 18 June, 1 and 73 squadrons, the first to France in 1939, were the last to leave, although many unserviceable Hurricanes and those without fuel were abandoned, not all of them being destroyed. AASF headquarters was disbanded on 26 June 1940.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

====Fighters====

Flying Officer Paul Richey of 1 Squadron told a staff officer from AASF HQ that

and in 1999, Cull et al. wrote that Hurricane tactics in France were inept, the fighters being sent into action in threes or sixes against far larger formations. Fighter pilots had been trained to attack bombers over England, beyond the range of German single-engined fighter escorts and formation flying received more emphasis than observation, dog-fighting and gunnery.

Experience gained during the Phoney War was not generally applied; some Hurricane pilots enjoyed great success but the Hurricane squadrons suffered needless casualties for lack of training and leadership. The use of tight formations meant that Hurricane pilots seldom saw the aircraft that shot them down. Few squadron commanders flew on operations and some were flagrantly incompetent. Flying from improvised and unprotected airstrips, rather than the airfields enjoyed by the Fighter Command squadrons in Britain, reduced the number of serviceable aircraft. Most Hurricane engagements took place against bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and the twin-engined Bf 110 heavy fighter, inferior in manoeuvrability but present in much greater numbers. The Hurricanes made bomber escorts necessary but suffered disproportionate losses when they met Bf 109s which used stalking tactics, attacking unseen out of the sun rather than dog-fighting.

====Bombers====
According to Greg Baughen (2016) on 10 May, the Fairey Battle had been a disaster as a tactical bomber; when flying high, they were shot down by fighters and when low, by anti-aircraft fire. With fuel for a range of in un-armoured and non-self-sealing tanks, carrying a navigator in a cabin with a poor view outside, the Battle was highly unsuitable for short-range, low altitude, tactical attacks. Extra armour and self-sealing fuel tanks had been delivered to France but not fitted. The crews lacked experience and at first may have taken too long to bomb, sometimes attacking over flat ground, which gave a good view of the target and an equally good view of the aircraft from the ground. With more experience, pilots used ground features for cover and made shorter approach runs. The German invasion demonstrated that RAF crews were not sufficiently equipped or trained for daylight tactical operations and army support; during the Battle of Arras (21 May) the BEF had received no air cover.

The attacks on 14 May were catastrophic and the Air Staff claimed that the losses suffered by the AASF showed that tactical air support was not a feasible operation of war. The ministry claimed that the Battle was obsolete, rather than in need of more armour, self-sealing tanks, guns and fighter support. After the war, German officers said that day bombing caused them many delays and that they had not noticed the British night bombing offensive against the Ruhr. The AASF had made a start on becoming a flexible tactical air force; daylight operations by the Battles had more effect on the German offensive than Wellington bombers flying by night. Sending low-performance aircraft over the battlefield might seem suicidal but slow biplanes like Dutch Fokker C.X bombers, the German Henschel Hs 123 dive-bomber and close support aircraft and British Hawker Hector army co-operation aircraft had been used in 1940 for ground attacks at low altitude. Against the ragged forward edge of advanced forces, with ill-organised anti-aircraft defences, such slow, light and highly-manoeuvrable aircraft could hit targets and escape.

====Command====
By 19 May, the lack of centralised command made Allied problems much worse; in the north the BEF commanded the Air Component, in the south, the AASF flew in support of the army but the BAFF HQ had to move south to Coulommiers, separating it from the ZOAN HQ. The Air Ministry continued its strategic bombing campaign, Fighter Command was preoccupied by the air defence of Britain, 2 Group was commanded jointly by Bomber Command and BAFF and the French command structure was similarly fragmented. After Dunkirk, Barratt realised that the AASF, down to six Battle squadrons, needed more than its three Hurricane squadrons for day operations. Barratt offered the Air Ministry the choice of a better-balanced force or the withdrawal of the AASF to Britain. If more fighters were to be sent to France it was vital that they be dispatched promptly, not after the Allies had been forced into another retreat. The Cabinet discussed the situation on 3 June; had been lost in May, ones had been delivered and Fighter Command had aircraft but the Cabinet refused to increase the three AASF fighter squadrons.

The Air Staff found it difficult to explain away the success of tactical operations but claimed that air superiority was due to the advance of the German armies and that it was unworkable for armies in retreat, which became a self-fulfilling prophecy. After the Battle of France, the Air Ministry continue to define air superiority as the possession of more bombers than an opposing air force, despite the period from 1939 to late 1940 exploding many interwar theories of warfare. Land battles had not resembled those of the First World War and bombers had not ended wars in a few weeks. The Air Staff emphasised the value of ground strafing, which had been demonstrated by the Hurricane squadrons of the AASF and the Air Component, rather than bombing in support of the army.

===Casualties===
The Battle squadrons suffered a loss on 10 May, on 11 May and on 12 May. In the number of operational AASF bombers fell from On 14 May the AASF made a maximum effort, sending and eight Blenheims to attack targets near Sedan; more than half were lost, cumulative AASF losses reaching In three weeks more than had been shot down and killed. The remaining bombers began to operate mostly at night and from 15 May to 5 June losses fell to albeit with much reduced bombing accuracy. In 2017, Greg Baughen wrote that an Air Ministry study estimated that from 5 to 15 June, the AASF Battles had flown sorties for a loss of a rate. Although the loss of RAF records during the made totals unreliable, the loss rate was probably the same and while high, the losses contrasted favourably with the rate from 10 to 15 May. Blenheim losses averaged but from 20 May, when they received escorts, the rate fell to Martin Maryland bombers of the had a loss rate of the lowest of the Allied day bombers. In the ten days from the beginning of until the return of the Battle squadrons to Britain, the 2 Group Blenheims flew and the sorties contributing of the total, a considerable achievement for six squadrons. From 10 May to 24 June the AASF lost and the Air Component another five weeks, the RAF lost killed, wounded and missing and 

===Subsequent operations===
Back in Britain, the surviving AASF aircrew were sent on leave; as BAFF had been dissolved, the bomber squadrons reverted to 1 Group, Bomber Command and the Hurricanes to Fighter Command. The Air Ministry contemplated how to use the Battle crews but Bomber Command wanted nothing to do with army support. Despite the losses in France, there were more than 300 Battles in storage and it was in production as a trainer. The two Battle squadrons withdrawn when the AASF was reduced in size converted to Blenheims but 98 Squadron, despite a grievous loss of personnel, was reformed with Battles. The RAF set up 67 Group to defend Northern Ireland with 88 and 226 squadrons; 98 Squadron was chosen to go to Iceland for coastal reconnaissance. Playfair advocated the use of Battles as night bombers, noting the improvement in accuracy when crews flew low but against an invasion, waiting until dark would be impossible. On 5 July, 1 Group, based at Hucknall, with the four remaining Battle squadrons, their 45 Battles and 55 crews at RAF Binbrook and RAF Newton, was declared operational for emergencies. For the rest of the summer the Battle squadrons stood by in case of invasion, later joined by the Polish 300 &quot;Ziemi Mazowieckiej&quot;, 301 &quot;Ziemi Pomorskiej&quot;, 304 &quot;Ziemi Śląskiej&quot; and 305 &quot;Ziemi Wielkopolska&quot; bomber squadrons.

<text>The Advanced Aviation Cobra was a U.S. ultralight aircraft of extremely minimalist design marketed for homebuilding, developed from the Advanced Aviation Husky. The pilot is seated in an open framework suspended beneath a fabric-covered wing on which the engine (adapted from a snowmobile) and pusher propeller are also mounted. Early Cobras (Model A) had spoilers for roll control, while the Model B had traditional full three-axis control using ailerons. A two-seat training version, known as the King Cobra was also available.

<text>Mark Leduc (May 4, 1962 – July 22, 2009) was a boxer from Canada, who won a silver medal at the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics.

==Amateur career==
*Amateur Record: 184-26
*Won an Olympic Silver Medal 1992 for Canada.

=== Olympic results ===
*Defeated Godfrey Wakaabu (Uganda) 9-2
*Defeated Dillon Carew (Guyana) 5-0
*Defeated Laid Bouneb (Algeria) 8-1
*Defeated Leonard Dorin (Romania) 13-6
*Lost to Héctor Vinent (Cuba) 1-11

==Professional boxing career==
Leduc turned pro in 1992 and had limited success. He retired in 1993 with a record of 4-1-0 after losing to Michel Galarneau.

==Retirement and coming out==
In 1993, Leduc spoke about being a gay athlete in CBC Radio&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Last Closet&quot;, which aired on the weekly sports series &quot;The Inside Track&quot;; as he was not yet ready to officially come out, the interview was aired anonymously and recorded through a voice filter. Another Canadian athlete who would also subsequently come out as gay, Mark Tewksbury, also granted an anonymous interview to the same program. In 1994, Leduc officially came out as gay in the TV documentary &quot;For the Love of the Game&quot;, one of the few boxers ever to do so. He also later volunteered as a speaker and mentor for various LGBT youth groups.

He attended Toronto’s Pride Parade in 1999 as grand marshal with Savoy Howe. Leduc worked for and volunteered with the Toronto People with AIDS Foundation, later becoming a set-builder and construction worker in the film industry.

Leduc died on July 22, 2009, in Toronto. He had collapsed in the sauna of St. Mark&#x27;s Spa and doctors suggested that his death may have resulted from heat stroke. In 2019 playwright Raymond Helkio wrote &quot;LEDUC: A Public Life of Solitude&quot;, a play documenting the life and death of Mark Leduc.

<doc id="1060168" wikidata="Q311108" url="?curid=1060168" title="Sébastien Frey">
<text>Sébastien Frey (born 18 March 1980) is a French former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

Frey began his club career in France with Cannes in 1997. He went on to spend most of his career in the Italian Serie A, playing for Inter Milan, Hellas Verona, Parma, Fiorentina, and Genoa. He ended his career in 2015, after two seasons with Turkish side Bursaspor. At international level, he represented the France national football team on two occasions between 2007 and 2008 and was an unused member of the squad that took part at UEFA Euro 2008.

==Club career==
===Cannes===
Born in Thonon-les-Bains, Frey began his career with French side AS Cannes in 1997, at the age of 17. On 20 September 1997, he made his professional league debut, playing as a starter in a 1–1 home draw against Rennes. At the end of the 1997–98 season, Frey made 24 league appearances and took Grégory Wimbée&#x27;s starting goalkeeping spot in the first team.

===Inter Milan===
Following two promising seasons at Cannes, Frey began to attract attention from abroad, most noticeably from Inter Milan whom had been notified of his exceptional talents by former keeper Walter Zenga and Serie A rivals Juventus. Eventually, he opted to join Inter. At Inter in earlier season, he was the third goalkeeper behind Andrea Mazzantini and Gianluca Pagliuca until Mazzantini was sold to Perugia, making Frey as second choice goalkeeper. On 21 March 1999, Frey finally made his debut for the club against Genoa. Frey also made an appearance against Sampdoria when he was put on instead of Pagliuca at 70 minutes on the score (and final) 4–0. He ended the season with a total of seven league appearances for Nerazzurri.

====Loan to Verona and return to Inter Milan====
In the summer transfer window of 1999, Frey moved on loan to Verona, where he played thirty league appearances and helped the team in order to avoid relegation.

The following year, he returned from loan to play for Inter, as the club sold Angelo Peruzzi for cash and Marco Ballotta. At Inter, Frey was recalled in view of his performance with Verona and Inter, and in the 2000–01 season, he became the youngest goalie in the Lombard team&#x27;s history, and the first foreigner to move from Inter to this post. He also participated in the preliminary round of the Champions League. His exemplary behavior, his maturity and dedication to the club propel him on rare occasions to be the team captain. However, the team played below expectations, and the club decided to make several changes to the squad; after the arrival of Francesco Toldo from Fiorentina, Frey was placed on the transfer list.

===Parma===
Following Toldo&#x27;s transfer to Inter, Frey was forced to find a new club. He was transferred to Parma in the summer of 2001, for 8 billion lire cash plus Sérgio Conceição (Conceição was tagged for 32 billion lire, Inter&#x27;s official site claimed the cash was 10 billion lire), or 40 billion lire with whom he won the 2001–02 Coppa Italia. Frey was the replacement for Gianluigi Buffon who was sold to Juventus for a transfer fee of 100 billion lire in the same window. The transfer fee was the world-record goalkeeper&#x27;s transfer fee at that time. It was a difficult task for Frey to replace Buffon.

His experience in Parma was positive and provided ample opportunity for Frey to demonstrate his talent and justify the trust placed in him by the club. He became a key element of the squad and regularly played in the UEFA Cup. Frey won the 2001–02 edition of the Coppa Italia with Parma, leading the club to win the title for the third time since 1992; however, Frey never played in the tournament with Cláudio Taffarel preferred for the final. In the 2002 Supercoppa Italiana, however, Frey started in goal against Juventus, but could not help his team to avoid losing 2–1 to the league champions.

In June 2005, Parma avoided relegation to Serie B against Bologna, thanks to Frey and his outstanding performance. Despite his attachment to the club, an economic concern of the latter to balance its budget meant Frey had to be sold. Frey joined Fiorentina for the 2005–06 season, after four seasons with Parma, on the a loan with an option to be.

===Fiorentina===
Frey joined Fiorentina on loan for the 2005–06 campaign, and signed a permanent deal with the club for €6 million (€5.6M went to Parma) at the end of the year following a glittering season where he formed the backbone of the team along with Cristian Brocchi, Stefano Fiore, and Luca Toni. After a positive first half of the season for him and his team, on 10 January 2006, during a match in the Coppa Italia against Juventus, he received a blow after a conflict with Marcelo Zalayeta.

Due to the clash, Frey received blunt trauma to the tibia, which ruled him out of the starting line-up for several months, forcing the club&#x27;s sporting director Pantaleo Corvino to hire a replacement, which turned out to be Romanian keeper Bogdan Lobonț.

On 15 May 2006, the Florentine officials announced the outright purchase of Frey, buying him for an amount equal to €6 million. In the new season Frey regained his starting spot in goal, after an initial physiological problems due to long stop regains fitness.

On 13 December 2007, Frey suffered a meniscus injury during training, and underwent knee surgery the next day. He returned for Fiorentina&#x27;s 2–1 victory over Parma on 13 January 2008, after being sidelined for one month, and his outstanding play was rewarded with a contract extension. Fiorentina reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup that season.

In the 2008–09 Serie A season, Frey conceded less than a goal per game, conceding only thirty-one goals in thirty-eight matches.

On 2 November 2010, Frey injured his knee during training, suffering an Anterior cruciate ligament injury, ruling him out for the rest of the season.

===Genoa===
In 2011, Frey joined Genoa on a five-year deal on a free transfer after falling out of favour with Fiorentina and being replaced by the newly signed Artur Boruc, who had joined the club from Celtic the previous season. The move turned out to be a failure as Genoa was moving backwards and was ever present in the relegation zone. Frey left after 2 years and was replaced by Mattia Perin. Before joining Genoa, Frey revealed talks with French spenders PSG during the summer transfer window, but the capital side eventually acquired Palermo goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu instead. Frey also revealed that German side Bayern Munich was keen to sign him in the past.

===Bursaspor===

On 15 July 2013, Frey joined Turkish club Bursaspor for an undisclosed fee. After he failed to make an appearance during 2014–15 season, his contract was mutually terminated on 9 July 2015, and Frey subsequently retired from professional football. He confirmed his farewell from the club with an Instagram message on 15 July 2015, stating his gratefulness for his spell at club.

==International career==
Frey received his first call-up for France for a match against Poland in November 2004, but did not make an appearance. He earned his first cap in France&#x27;s final UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier against Ukraine on 21 November 2007. The match ended in a 2–2 draw after he erred on Andriy Shevchenko&#x27;s equalising goal. He was a member of France&#x27;s Euro 2008 finals squad. On 20 August 2008, Frey announced his retirement from international football at the age of 28 to focus on his club career.

==Style of play==
Known for his leadership, composure, mentality, strength of character, personality, and consistency, Frey was regarded as one of the best Serie A goalkeepers of his generation throughout his career. A dynamic and agile keeper, who was highly regarded for his acrobatic shot-stopping and aerial ability, he was known in particular for his reactions and his athleticism in goal, as well as his positional sense, speed and ability to rush out in one on one situations, although he was less effective at coming off his line to claim crosses, and performed better between the posts; a former outfield player in his youth, in addition to his goalkeeping abilities, Frey also possessed reliable ball skills and distribution with his feet.

==Personal life==
Frey&#x27;s grandfather, André, was a French international footballer, and his father, Raymond, was also a professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. His younger brother, Nicolas, played as a defensive midfielder for Serie A team Chievo. Frey is a Buddhist (Soka Gakkai), and credited former Fiorentina legend Roberto Baggio as one of his spiritual mentors.

<text>Alex is a British cartoon strip by Charles Peattie and Russell Taylor. It first appeared in the short-lived &quot;London Daily News&quot; in 1987. It moved to &quot;The Independent&quot; later that year and then to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 1992. A translated version was published in the German newspaper &quot;Financial Times Deutschland&quot;. It was also published translated into Dutch for some years in the main financial newspaper of the Netherlands, &quot;Het Financieele Dagblad&quot; &quot;(FD)&quot;, around the turn of the century.

The strip with its storylines-with-a-twist proved so popular that, in the course of its transfer to the &quot;Telegraph&quot;, it was preceded by a nationwide billboard campaign.

The strip occurs in &#x27;real-time&#x27;, i.e. time passes and characters age and develop as in real life. Alex and Penny married in the strip&#x27;s early days and had a son called Christopher, who grew up, went to school, had work experience and has now started college. Alex and Penny themselves are now middle-aged.

==Style and humour==

The humour in the strip derives from wordplay and twist endings related to Alex&#x27;s world of yuppie values, Conservative politics, obsession with appearances, displays of wealth and schemes to stay one up in the world of international finance. A common theme is to contrast the old days of the traditional City of London (alcohol-fueled lunches, insider dealing, corporate jollies) with the modern American-influenced financial world (abstemiousness, compliance, corporate-speak).

Peattie and Taylor are reputed to work closely with a variety of London financial contacts to ensure that their strips accurately reflect the recent scandals and rumours which pass around the City. Much gossip has circulated as to the likely inspiration for some of the characters. A storyline in March 2009 had one of Alex&#x27;s old colleagues leave the city to become a teacher, coinciding with a British government plan to ease the amount of time spent on teacher training and encouraging &quot;fantastic mathematicians... who would have once perhaps gone into the City but now actually might be more interested in a career in teaching&quot;.

The most common kind of joke features a conversation between the characters, where in the final frame a twist ending becomes apparent – the context of the conversation was not what the reader had supposed, usually reflecting on the protagonists&#x27; materialistic values and priorities.

For instance, in a restaurant, an embarrassed Alex apologises to the maître d&#x27; after his dinner guest answers a call on his mobile, which has been frowned upon in the past. The maître d&#x27;s claim that the restaurant&#x27;s policy on phones is very relaxed these days does not alleviate Alex&#x27;s embarrassment since his concern was due to being seen with a companion who was not using the latest model, and not (as the reader may have supposed) due to talking on a cellphone in a restaurant.

Another kind of strip which appears occasionally consists of only two large frames, showing two different characters, or the same character in two different situations, giving a monologue composed of almost exactly the same words, but which, in the different situations, have very different meanings.

During Christmas times, the strip usually takes on storylines featuring fantasy characters and situations, such as &#x27;A Close Encounter&#x27; with aliens (1990), visits to Santa Claus (2006, 2009) or a trip to Narnia (2005). In 2013, a 15-part storyline was published, featuring Alex taking over his boss Cyrus&#x27;s job after the latter committed suicide. However a supernatural agreement saw reversal to &quot;normal&quot; circumstances.

The complexities of the jokes has meant that the strip has often had to take time off (i.e., not appear for two or more weeks) while the writers come up with new material.

==List of characters==

Alex Masterley (born 24 February 1960) is the protagonist of the comic strip. He is an experienced investment banker working in London&#x27;s Docklands. Alex is totally obsessed with personal status, with his work coming second and his family a distant third. His commitment to social standing requires him to have all of the latest professional gadgets, including a BlackBerry and a 3G mobile phone. For him, the most important thing is displaying your wealth to all and sundry. Alex usually works for Rupert Sterling at Megabank, but has, in the past, worked for Mr Hardcastle as his Head of Corporate Strategy. He became a Conservative Member of Parliament in 2019 United Kingdom general election.

Penny Masterley (née &quot;Wright&quot;) is Alex&#x27;s long-suffering wife. They married very early in the strip&#x27;s history, and have one son, Christopher. Penny enjoys the affluent lifestyle that Alex provides, but has little patience for Alex&#x27;s obsessions with status and his work. The two spend very little time together, and are not very close. Alex has cheated on Penny a number of times, including a protracted affair with his secretary, Wendy, in 1991, and a one-night stand with a co-worker while travelling on business in 1998. In 2006, Alex started an affair with a client, Carolyn. Penny came very close to divorcing Alex after the affair with his secretary, and has considered leaving him on other occasions. In the summer of 2009, Penny went out to work (for the first time ever) as a redundancy counsellor: a move that upset Alex as he worried that having a working wife might draw people to conclude that he had himself lost his job. In 2013 Penny&#x27;s work in the charity sector led to her being headhunted into a career as a company non-executive director. Fast-tracked in the corporate world due to her gender, her professional success has already begun to undermine Alex&#x27;s standing and self-worth.

Christopher Masterley (born 11 September 1989) is Alex&#x27;s son. At first, Christopher was very much his father&#x27;s son, and shares his concern for status and his nose for business. Alex mostly sees Christopher as a symbol of his success, and often makes him a victim of his quest for status. Though initially educated at a top public school, Christopher was withdrawn during the City slump in 2004, when Alex was out of work, and faced the humiliation of leaving the school with a black plastic bag containing his things, a fate city stockbrokers often face, and which was set up by his own father. In 2009 Christopher went to college to study art, much to Alex&#x27;s chagrin. Christopher is currently unemployed and back living with his parents.

Clive Reed is Alex&#x27;s co-worker, and even Alex&#x27;s boss from June 2004 to October 2005 (afterwards he got side-lined by Rupert but refused to resign, thus forced to accept a demotion). Until recently he lived with his longterm girlfriend and subsequent wife Bridget. Although a fellow Oxford graduate, Clive is Alex&#x27;s inferior in every way. He is less socially skilled, and frequently commits embarrassing gaffes in public. He is less professionally skilled, and often makes bad financial investments or fails to manage his subordinates. Alex enjoys Clive&#x27;s company because it provides many opportunities to show his superiority. Clive is also a dreadful wimp, and readily retreats from any situation of conflict or difficulty. In spite of this, Clive is something of a womaniser, and has enjoyed a moderate amount of success. In particular, Clive had a long and guilt-ridden affair with an American colleague Ruth while he was engaged to Bridget. Clive also enjoys just enough professional success to maintain his career and his affluent lifestyle. In August 2008, Clive was made redundant, a fact Alex knew but used to win a bet. However, he soon returned after it emerged that the bank had fired the wrong Clive Reed.

Bridget Mann is Clive&#x27;s ex-wife. Unlike the pleasant Penny, Bridget has a calculating and sadistic temperament. She takes delight in any opportunity to expose Clive for the wimp and loser that he is. This, together with the affluent lifestyle that Clive somehow manages to provide, seems to have been her main reason for staying with him. In 2013, Clive and Bridget had a pair of twins, after years of failed IVF&#x27;s; but two years later Clive discovered Bridget in bed with his American boss Cyrus. She subsequently expelled Clive from their house and has sought a divorce, which was finalized by December 2018.

Rupert Sterling is a retired senior bank executive. For many years, he was Alex and Clive&#x27;s boss, and before retirement he served as senior director at Megabank. He and Alex are on the same wavelength as regards status and appearances. This has not stopped Rupert from sacking Alex on a number of occasions, though never for long. Rupert was once tried and jailed for financial fraud; this did not affect his life style too much: his wife would arrive on visiting day only to be told that her husband was in a meeting.

Greg Masterley is Alex&#x27;s brother and a reporter. There appears to be little mutual affection or respect between the two siblings. Their elderly parents live in retirement.

Sir Stewart Hardcastle is the stereotypical Northern boss of a manufacturing company. Hardcastle employs Megabank for a lot of his financial work. Bluff and down-to-earth, it is surprising that he puts up with Alex&#x27;s expensive and flash City ways. Alex worked for him during the City slump in around 2002, though he found every excuse from getting away from Hardcastle&#x27;s northern-based offices to enjoy the pleasures of London and Ascot. Previously always known as Mr Hardcastle, he was knighted in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, 2013.

Vince is a money broker from the dealing floor at Megabank. Representing the &#x27;East End Barrow boy&#x27; type, Vince wears white socks, talks in cockney rhyming slang (&quot;flute&quot; = suit, &quot;jam jar&quot; = car) and is ignorant of the finer points of culture and etiquette at Glyndebourne and the Royal Opera that Alex and Clive revel in.

Christian is a European junior working his way through the ranks. Although sometimes described as &quot;Eurotrash&quot; he is actually a sophisticated and highly educated member of a rich French family. He disdains the &#x27;Anglo&#x27; culture and in return is often the butt of Alex&#x27;s jokes. He speaks a number of languages which the other staff find rather frustrating, especially when he and another foreign worker speak out openly — in English rather than French or Spanish about how badly the English cricket team is doing. Christian has not appeared in the strip since before the Brexit referendum and his present status is unknown.

Jane was Alex&#x27;s head of department in 1996. A decisive and masterful figure, he was in awe of her the moment they first met. She herself had an apparently genuine passion for Alex and they had a brief affair. This ended when she had to resign for undisclosed reasons &quot;after a full and frank discussion with the board&quot;. Her last act was to send a late night email to all her staff thanking them for showing her &quot;kindness, warmth, respect, personal support, encouragement, loyalty, hospitality and friendship&quot;, concluding that all of this was now completely wasted since someone else would be determining their bonuses.

Ruth was Clive&#x27;s American lover, not seen much lately. An expatriate investment banker and a frequent character in early years, she would appear in strips in which she and her female colleagues would complain about the treatment of women in the City

Shelley is Director of Human Resources at Megabank. While other staff members come and go, her appointment appears to be a permanent one. She was briefly (2002) Rupert Sterling&#x27;s lover.

Wendy Tanner was Alex&#x27;s secretary and had an affair with him. When his wife Penny found out they almost divorced, but later made up. Alex decided that there was no future with Wendy and felt it unwise to continue any longer since her probationary period was due to end and it is hard to sack clerical staff once they become full-time.

Cyrus is Alex&#x27;s God-fearing American head of department who arrived on the scene in 2006, soon after the Megabank merger and the apparent promotion of Rupert to senior banker status. Cyrus is an unabashed workaholic who bows his head during Thanksgiving dinner grace in order to use his Blackberry for work. In spite of his strongly-held religious values Cyrus is currently (2016) having an adulterous affair with Bridget, wife of his subordinate Clive. Bizarrely this led to a duel at dawn with pistols on Hampstead Heath.

Carolyn is Alex&#x27;s client and mistress, with whom he has been secretly involved. She&#x27;s herself married, and her husband once challenged Alex in a boxing match after he found out their affair. The relationship, both commercial and romantic, appears to have cooled and Carolyn has not appeared in recent strips.

Faberge is a lapdancer that Clive meets regularly outside work. Clive cannot believe that&#x27;s not her real name. By contrast with Clive, Faberge appears to have a practical and realistic view of life.

Robin Thorne was a graduate trainee who was employed at Megabank at the time of the dot-com bubble. Being of a new generation, his knowledge and use of the internet made him quite a contrast to Alex. The differences between two generations could be quite big with one having to painstakingly explain to the other how everything worked and being frustrated when they seemed unable to grasp basic essentials: like Robin using the internet to order sandwiches and get Alex&#x27;s drycleaning done without having to do it himself and denying Alex the pleasure of demeaning him in the process. When the dot-com bubble burst, Alex finally got the opportunity to assign such tasks to Robin, who eventually left the bank. Alex was later asked to contact the head of a start-up hedge fund who, instead of being wined and dined, would be quite satisfied with sandwiches in his office: the potential client was Robin, who sent Alex out to get the sandwiches. As a result of the credit crunch, Robin&#x27;s business went bust in early 2009 and he called on Alex for a possible job back at Megabank. Since they had done a lot of business with the hedge fund Alex felt that it was only fair to grant him an interview, give him 30 seconds to give his best three investment ideas and then leave — Alex getting pleasure by treating Robin the way he had treated him. To make ends meet, Robin later turned his home into a bed and breakfast, and ended up serving meals to Alex again.

Justin is a banker who successfully stood as a candidate for the Conservative Party in the 2010 UK General Election. He claimed his motivation for wishing to enter politics was his disgust at the recent United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal, but then revealed that he had funded his campaign via various bogus claims on his expense account at the bank. Alex offered a job exchange to Justin during the 2019 United Kingdom general election, with Alex taking up Justin&#x27;s place as MP and Justin resuming his bank career.

...plus a cast of match sellers, policemen, and all the characters one would expect to find in a cosmopolitan world financial centre.

==Stage play==
&quot;Alex&quot; was turned into a stage play by Peattie and Taylor and was performed at the Arts Theatre, London in October, 2007. Robert Bathurst portrayed the titular character in a one-man act assisted by animated cartoons of the other characters and the various locations. The plot revolved around Alex finding his personal and professional life in crisis when his wife Penny leaves him and a deal involving his perennial client Mr Hardcastle threatens to go sour. With his trademark cynical machinations Alex manages to turn both situations to his advantage and come out on top. Bathurst took &quot;Alex&quot; on an international tour, beginning in Melbourne, Australia in September 2008 and concluding in London in December. During the tour, it was announced that Bathurst would reprise the role of Alex in a film adaptation that was being developed by independent production company BreakThru Films. The film is to be a live-action/animation hybrid. Since the initial announcement, no further information has been published, though a trailer exists, suggesting a film of some form has been made.

==Radio adaptation==
Bathurst reprised the role in 2010 in a radio version of &quot;Alex&quot;, broadcast in ten weekly episodes on Classic FM. The show did not mention that Alex was a fictional character voiced by an actor and – in the manner of Orson Welles’ The War of the Worlds radio broadcast – many listeners believed that they were listening to a real banker airing his controversial opinions on national radio (the financial crisis of 2007–2008 was in full swing and bankers were &quot;persona non grata&quot; at the time). In 2011, the show won a Media Week award and a Sony Award for Best Branded Content.

==Controversy==
In 2017 the cartoon introduced a transgender character, Stephanie. She was an old-school, middle-aged boss transitioning to being a woman, but attempting to retain her previous privileges. The character was intended to draw attention to gender disparities. However &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; dropped &quot;Alex&quot; on 11 April 2019 following complaints from some readers about the character. Stephanie has not appeared in the strip since.

<doc id="1060180" wikidata="Q2116093" url="?curid=1060180" title="Psychopathic Records">
<text>Psychopathic Records is an American independent record label headquartered in Farmington Hills, Michigan. The label is most associated with the hip-hop music subgenres horrorcore and rap rock. The label was founded in 1991 by Alex Abbiss and hip hop group Insane Clown Posse. The iconography of a man with a meat cleaver has been used for years as a symbol of the group, its fanbase, and its associates.

In addition to producing music, Psychopathic also produces merchandise, video, and professional wrestling. Psychopathic runs its own manufacturing and distribution operations for merchandise, with nearly 30 full-time employees. In 2009–2010, the label had about $10 million in annual revenue. The recording studio for the label was called The Lotus Pod.

== History ==

=== Establishment (1991–1994) ===

Following the release of their 1991 EP &quot;Bass-Ment Cuts&quot;, Detroit hip hop trio Inner City Posse, consisting of Violent J, Shaggy 2 Dope, and John Kickjazz (John Utsler), hired local record store owner Alex Abbiss as its manager. Taking the advice of Violent J&#x27;s brother, Jumpsteady, the group and Abbiss agreed to create their own label. After debating between the names Mad Paperboy Records and Psychopathic Records, they decided on Psychopathic and the label soon started operating out of Abbiss&#x27;s mother&#x27;s basement. A drawing Joseph Utsler scribbled on a napkin, now known as the Hatchet Man, became the company&#x27;s logo.

Inner City Posse released their first professionally recorded album, &quot;Dog Beats&quot;, on the label later that year. Shortly after, the group underwent a change in style, look, and name to become Insane Clown Posse, and created the Dark Carnival concept that would be continued by much of the label&#x27;s other artists for years to come. Esham and Kid Rock were paid to appear on the debut &quot;Insane Clown Posse&quot; album to increase the album&#x27;s marketability. The group and their label began to gain moderate popularity in the Detroit area following the releases of &quot;Carnival of Carnage&quot; and &quot;Beverly Kills 50187&quot;, as well as through their extensive amount of independent promoting. Months before the release of &quot;Carnival of Carnage&quot; John Kickjazz left the group. Not wanting to show weakness early in the game, they replaced him with friend and fan Greez-e (Erik Olson). Greez-e&#x27;s membership was short-lived, however, and after appearing on &quot;Beverly Kills 50187&quot; he left the group. ICP has remained a duo ever since.

=== Expansion and change (1994–2000) ===
Mike E. Clark was selected as the label&#x27;s core producer, with his recording studio, The Fun House being the main studio. On March 8, 1994, Insane Clown Posse released &quot;Ringmaster&quot;, which sold 40,000 copies independently by the summer. Later that year, Project Born was the first outside act signed to Psychopathic Records with the belief that they would become &quot;the next Dayton Family&quot;. The group&#x27;s debut album, Born Dead, received minimal sales, and they were subsequently dropped from the label in 1995.

Insane Clown Posse signed a record deal with Battery/Jive Records in 1995 but left the label the following year after it poorly promoted their new album, the &quot;Riddle Box&quot;. In 1995, ICP and friends created a group to keep ICP busy until the release of Riddle Box, and called themselves Golden Goldies. Golden Goldies was a comical group whose lyrics focused solely on gold. The group consisted of Psychopathic Records employees and friends. Their only LP, &quot;Gimme Them Fuckin&#x27; Nuggets Bitch, Or I&#x27;ll Punch Your Fuckin&#x27; Face&quot;, was recorded in 1995 in a span of one week and was not publicly released. Golden Goldies was put together for entertainment purposes only. To add more humor to the album, each artist was given only five minutes to write their verses, and had only one take to record them, which resulted in some artists messing up their lines, and lyrics containing &quot;some very strange things.&quot; The group held only one live performance, which occurred at the record release party for Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s Riddle Box. The group consisted of: Golden Jelly (Joseph Bruce), Gold D (Joseph Utsler), Golden Gram (Robert Bruce), Gold Double B (Billy Bill), Gold Rocks (Alex Abbiss), Gold Digger (Mike E. Clark), Golden Warrior (Rich Murrell), Golden Frank (Frank G), Gold Teeth (Keith) Rold Gold (Josh), Gold Spud (Kelly Eubanks), Golden Toby (Fink the East Side G) and Gold Spakalantie (Matt Mackalantie). One day after the group left Jive and one day before it signed with Hollywood Records, Insane Clown Posse released &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; on its Psychopathic label. The group released &quot;The Great Milenko&quot; in 1997 but were notified that Hollywood Records had deleted the album within hours of its release, despite having sold 18,000 copies and reaching number 63 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The removal caused a public controversy, creating major mainstream coverage of the group and their Psychopathic label.

In 1997, the label signed Myzery and former members of the House of Krazees Jamie Spaniolo and Paul Methric. Taking the name of Twiztid, Spaniolo and Methric created the identities of Jamie Madrox and Monoxide Child, and released their first album, &quot;Mostasteless&quot;, that year. Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid, Myzery, and Blaze also formed the supergroup Psychopathic Rydas, and created Joe &amp; Joey Records to release the group&#x27;s albums to avoid any lawsuits. Myzery soon left the label after releasing the EP &quot;Para La Isla&quot;.

Later that year, Island Records bought the rights of &quot;The Great Milenko&quot; from Hollywood Records and signed Insane Clown Posse and Twiztid to their label. Island also helped Psychopathic Records expand into the movie business by funding Insane Clown Posse US$250,000 to begin work on a full-length movie, &quot;Big Money Hustlas&quot;, written by Violent J. The film was released through Island Def Jam Music Group, Psychopathic Video, and Non-Homogenized Productions on July 18, 2000. In 2001 they were the first record label/music group to do a tour showing their own movie in concert venues across the US.

Following their success in WWF, WCW, and ECW, Insane Clown Posse founded the professional wrestling promotion Juggalo Championship Wrestling in 1999 and created the Psychopathic Sports department. In July 2000, Psychopathic Records staged the first annual Gathering of the Juggalos (GOTJ) at the Novi Expo Center in Novi, Michigan. Described by Bruce as a &quot;Juggalo Woodstock&quot;, the Gathering of the Juggalos drew over 7,000 people to Novi, Michigan, for the two day event. Both Insane Clown Posse and Twiztid permanently returned to Psychopathic later that year, and the label soon built its own recording studio, named The Lotus Pod. Twiztid released the album &quot;Freek Show&quot;, which debuted number 51 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

=== Steady production (2001–2004) ===

In 2001, the supergroup Dark Lotus debuted, consisting of Jamie Madrox, Monoxide Child, Violent J, Shaggy 2 Dope, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, and non-Psychopathic artist Marz. Later that year, Anybody Killa was signed to the label. While also working on his own album, &quot;Hatchet Warrior&quot;, Killa replaced Marz in Dark Lotus for a short period. Detroit rapper Esham, whom Violent J considered to be an influence, also signed with Psychopathic Records for a large contract, and released a greatest hits album, &quot;Acid Rain&quot;, the following year.

Jumpsteady released his debut EP &quot;Chaos Theory&quot; in 2002. At that year&#x27;s Gathering of the Juggalos, rapper V-Sinizter won an MC Contest and was awarded a one-year contract with Psychopathic Records. On November 5, Insane Clown Posse released their sixth Joker&#x27;s Card, &quot;The Wraith: Shangri-La&quot;, which debuted at No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. V-Sinizter released &quot;Hunting Season&quot; in 2003, but was soon released by the label due to minimal sale.

=== Ax &amp; Smash Records (2002–2004) ===

Later that year, alternative rock group Zug Izland was signed and quickly released &quot;Cracked Tiles&quot; on January 28, 2003. They released their last album on the label, titled &quot;3:33&quot; on June 1, 2004. The label closed after Zug Izland left.

=== Continued releases (2005–2007) ===

After releasing &quot;Master of the Flying Guillotine&quot; in 2005, Jumpsteady retired from music to become an EMT in the metro Detroit area.

That summer, the two supergroups Soopa Villainz and Drive-By were created. The first, consisting of Mr. Diamond (Violent J), Mr. Club (Shaggy 2 Dope), Mr. Spade (Esham), and Mr. Heart (Lavel), released &quot;Furious&quot; in August. The latter, consisting of Blaze and Anybody Killa, released &quot;Pony Down (Prelude)&quot; in October. Although Esham had achieved his highest level of success at Psychopathic, he left the label that month to reform his own label, Reel Life Productions, and the group Soopa Villainz was disbanded. Anybody Killa left the following February. Later that year, Psychopathic Records and hip hop group D12, representing Eminem, ended their rivalry by holding a bowling match.

In April, Axe Murder Boyz won a single album contract with Psychopathic Records and released &quot;Blood In, Blood Out&quot; before being released from the label. That June, Alex Abbiss announced his retirement. Long time body guard and friend of Insane Clown Posse William Dail, referred to as Billy Bill, was named new president and CEO of Psychopathic Records. Later that month, the label launched its own internet radio station called WFuckOff Radio. Boondox signed with the label at that year&#x27;s Gathering of the Juggalos, becoming the first southern rapper on the label. Boondox was a Psychopathic Records favorite in the Underground Psychos contest who was voted out by the jugglaos in the second round. His name in the contest was &quot;Turn Coat Dirty&quot;.

=== Hatchet House (since 2007) ===

In 2007, the third former member of &quot;House of Krazees&quot; The R.O.C. signed with newly created Psychopathic sub-label, Hatchet House.

=== More signings to PSY and HH (2008–2012) ===

In 2008, Anybody Killa re-signed with Psychopathic. That May, the label hosted the first annual &quot;Hatchet Attacks&quot;. Axe Murder Boyz signed with Hatchet House on August 22. At the 2008 Gathering of the Juggalos a documentary on Juggalos, entitled &quot;A Family Underground&quot;, was filmed and was released on May 12, 2009.

On February 17, 2010, Psychopathic Records signed a contract with Universal Music Group&#x27;s Fontana Distribution. During this period, the label was nominated for Outstanding Local Record Label by Detroit Music Awards. In Blaze&#x27;s Gang Rags album The Dayton Family was shown to appear courtesy of Hatchet House.

Vanilla Ice and Cold 187um signed with Psychopathic Records in 2011.

On January 3, 2012, WFuckOff Radio was rebranded as Psychopathic Radio. During the 2012 Gathering of the Juggalos, it was announced that both former acts Zug Izland &amp; Jumpsteady have returned to Psychopathic Records. Boondox and Twiztid left the label. The December 21, 2012, issue of &quot;Hatchet Herald&quot; indicates that two new artists will issue albums on the label in 2013.

=== Expansion (2013–2014) ===

On February 4, 2013, it was revealed that one of the new artists was Legz Diamond. An entire issue of &quot;Hatchet Herald&quot; was devoted to the guitarist, discussing his Psychopathic debut album, &quot;9 Pistolas&quot;. In March, Violent J commented on Twiztid&#x27;s departure revealing that there was no animosity between Twiztid and Psychopathic, and speculated that Blaze Ya Dead Homie had also left the label, but that Twiztid and Blaze were still a part of Dark Lotus and Psychopathic Rydas. Blaze later spoke openly about the subject during a concert, stating that he had not departed from Psychopathic. Insane Clown Posse publicly apologized to Blaze via Twitter for the misunderstanding.

Doe Dubbla, a rapper from Detroit, officially signed to Psychopathic in June 2013, under the alias Big Hoodoo. In July, Psychopathic released Big Hoodoo&#x27;s debut, &quot;Crystal Skull&quot;, Cold 187 um departed from the label At the 2013 Gathering of the Juggalos, it was confirmed that Axe Murder Boyz and Boondox are returning to Psychopathic, while Blaze Ya Dead Homie ended up leaving Psychopathic Records.

A former employee is suing the label for sexual harassment.

In early February 2014 Faygoluvers.net conducted an interview with Insane Clown Posse, and they said that they hope they will work with some artists that they have been wanting to work with for a while. Also they were asked if they were going to do the second leg of The Mighty Death Pop! Tour, and they said that they will go on tour in 2014 but it won&#x27;t be called The Mighty Death Pop! Tour. During an interview in March 2014 DJ Paul of Da Mafia 6ix announced that they will be doing a collaboration album with Insane Clown Posse, and will tour to promote the album. In June 2014 Psychopathic Records announced that Insane Clown Posse and Da Mafia 6ix were working on a collaboration album, and Insane Clown Posse posted pictures on their official Instagram page of them and Da Mafia 6ix sitting around in Violent J&#x27;s home studio. The album is scheduled to be released sometime in August 2014. A few days after Faygoluvers.net conducted the interview with Insane Clown Posse, Psychopathic Records, Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid and Blaze Ya Dead Homie released a picture of the Dark Lotus hand sign stating that all original members (Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid &amp; Blaze Ya Dead Homie) were going to be back in the studio recording a new studio album on all their media outlets. Under the hand sign were Roman numerals translating to (7-29-2014). The album will initially be released at the 2014 GOTJ (July 23, 2014July 27, 2014). In June 2014 Insane Clown Posse announced that they will be releasing their first box set The First Six with all first six Joker Cards (Carnival of Carnage, Ringmaster, Riddle Box, The Great Milenko, The Amazing Jeckel Brothers, The Wraith: Shangri-La/The Wraith: Hell&#x27;s Pit), along with a certification of authenticity signed by Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope, six tarot cards, and an 8-song EP of all new music titled House of Wax, that will be released on October 28, 2014.

On August 5, 2014, ICP released a promo flyer for their upcoming tour titled &quot;ShockFest&quot; with Da Mafia 6ix, Mushroomhead, Madchild and Jelly Roll from September 30, 2014, through October 31, 2014. The tour was originally scheduled to be a 45-date tour, and scheduled to kick off on September 18, 2014, but due to Madchild performing in Australia with his group Swollen Members for a mini tour until September 27, 2014, the tour will now kick off on September 30, 2014, Columbus, Ohio, and will conclude on ICP&#x27;s 21st annual Hallowicked concert on October 31, 2014, in Detroit, Michigan. Psychopathic Records released a video promo for &quot;ShockFest&quot; in early August 2014. The tour is now scheduled to run from September 25, 2014, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and will conclude on October 31, 2014, in Detroit. In the booklet released with the Reindeer Games album were four flyers in promotion of new albums. The first was for Insane Clown Posse, it said that the third Joker Card in the second Deck will be released &quot;sooner than you think&quot;. The second was for Otis, it said that his debut solo album on Psychopathic will be titled Slaughter and it said that it too will be released &quot;soon&quot;. The third was for DJ Paul, it said that his debut solo album on Psychopathic will be titled &quot;Master Of Evil&quot; and it said that it too will be released &quot;soon&quot;. The fourth was for Da Mafia 6ix, it was for their upcoming album titled &quot;Watch What U Wish&quot; which will be released on October 31, 2014, not on Psychopathic Records.

Also the same day the free downloadable song &quot;Hurricane Of Diamonds&quot; featuring Insane Clown Posse, Anybody Killa, DJ Clay, Big Hoodoo, Blahzay Roze and Lyte was released. On January 19, 2017, in an interview with faygoluvers.net, Insane Clown Posse announced that they were cutting ties with Twiztid and Majik Ninja Entertainment, as they had repeatedly declined invitations to the &quot;Juggalo March on Washington&quot;, and the alternative to not march, going on a Wizard of the Hood Tour, which they also declined. Also in doing so, Insane Clown Posse stated that Psychopathic Records will stop reaching out to Twiztid and Majik Ninja Entertainment for &quot;Juggalo Day&quot; and the Gathering of the Juggalos. Also during the interview it was announced that new music will come from Insane Clown Posse, DJ Clay, Big Hoodoo, Blahzay Roze, Lyte and a new group that includes Insane Clown Posse, as everyone on the label recently signed a new three-album deal with the label.

On February 25, 2018 Violent J took to Twitter to announce that the &quot;Hurricane Of Diamonds&quot; CD would be available during the SlamFest Tour (March 1, 2018, through April 1, 2018) with Attila, Sylar, Cage, Lil Toenail, Lyte, Ouija, and would be available in a few weeks (middle of March 2018) on Psychopaticmerch.com. It was also said that the CD would feature 17 tracks in total, with songs that had music videos made for them in 2017, also with at least 13 being never released on CD before, and three being brand new, unheard Insane Clown Posse songs. During Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s 2018 Gathering of the Juggalos seminar, it was announced that &quot;Fearless Fred Fury&quot; would be released on October 26, 2018, and also &quot;Flip The Rat&quot; EP would be released the same day, with instructions on how to obtain the EP inside of FFF. It was also announced that any reconciliation in any way with Twiztid, or a Dark Lotus reunion, will not happen in any way, with Violent J saying, &quot;It&#x27;ll be that way in five years, and will still be that way in ten years. Sorry Juggalos, but we wanted to address it upfront for anybody holding out hope that it might happen, but it&#x27;s not&quot;. It was also announced that the Bloody Brothers, (a concept that featured Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope as backwoods, serial killing hillbillies, that was later used as the Boondox gimmick), would be happening soon, as well as other alter ego albums, with ICP saying &quot;We&#x27;ve come up with a lot of gimmick ideas that were used for other artists, but we&#x27;re not doing that anymore, if we come up with it and want to use it as a project of ours, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re gonna do&quot;. It was also revealed that a new supergroup was on the label called The Loony Goons and features Insane Clown Posse, Big Hoodoo, Lyte and Ouija Macc. It was also announced that TLG will begin recording their debut album after they return to Detroit after the GOTJ. Violent J stated &quot;The album will have something you&#x27;d hear in 1985, and the next track will be something you&#x27;d hear in 2019&quot;. During Lyte and Ouija Macc&#x27;s seminar they were asked if they were doing a Lil Rydas album. They then asked the crowd if they want it, with a positive response they said to expect it in 2019. Since ICP announced that they were going back to do other supergroups that they had pushed aside, during their 2018 GOTJ Seminar, rumors have been circulating that a group that was created in 2003 called Planned Panic, (that featured Insane Clown Posse, Anybody Killa and Tech N9ne), could make an appearance with an EP, or a couple song set at the 2018 Hallowicked Show. On October 21, 2020, ICP confirmed during the 2020 Psychopathic Don Shoot Interview that the only artists on the label are them &amp; Ouija Macc. The CD booklet of Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s 2021 album &quot;Yum Yum Bedlam&quot; referred to the horrorcore rapper Zitro as &quot;the newest member of the Psychopathic Records Family.&quot; However, there has been no announcement of him being officially signed to the label.

=== Hatchet Gear ===

Psychopathic Records began distribution of merchandise in 1994 by selling T-shirts. After several comic books drawn by Joseph Utlser sold quickly in 1994, the label also started manufacturing collectibles. Psychopathic later created a separate department for their merchandising and called their line Hatchet Gear, named after the label&#x27;s Hatchetman logo which more closely resembles a traditional meat cleaver. Hatchetgear currently sells everything from T-shirts, jerseys, and hoodies to &quot;energy drinks, action figures, ski masks, liquor flasks, jewelry, and sneakers.&quot; The range and marketability of their merchandise has become an aspect of the company.

=== Psychopathic Video ===

Psychopathic Video has released six professional wrestling videos, five concert films, five documentaries, one mockumentary, one mini-movie, one collection of music videos, and two feature films. On August 31, 2004, Psychopathic Video made world history when it released the mini-movie &quot;Bowling Balls&quot; with Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s album &quot;Hell&#x27;s Pit&quot;. The video was the first ever 3-D film shot in high-definition.

=== Psychopathic Sports ===

Psychopathic Sports was launched in 1997 when Insane Clown Posse released a VHS entitled &quot;ICP&#x27;s Strangle-Mania&quot;, which featured a compilation of professional wrestling death matches from the &quot;Outrageously Violent Wrestling from Japan&quot; video collection, overdubbed with their own humorous commentary. It hosted two &quot;Strangle-Mania Live&quot; wrestling events in 1997 and 1998. With Juggalo Championship Wrestling&#x27;s inception in 1999, Psychopathic Sports turned its full focus to the promotion. In 2007, it started the &quot;SlamTV!&quot; internet wrestling show, as well as the &quot;SlamTV! Express&quot; mini-show in 2010. Psychopathic Sports also promoted the debut house show for TNA Wrestling on March 17, 2006, in Plymouth, Michigan.

The department expanded in January 2010, announcing that it had bought a warehouse to run operations in Novi, Michigan and had hired full-time workers. They also announced plans to run Juggalo Championship Wrestling full-time starting November of that year. The promotion will hold tapings of SlamTV! every other week, as well as run one additional show a month, at the Juggalo Arena. All shows will be taped and released on DVD, and a clothing line is set to be created.

<doc id="1060184" wikidata="Q1072451" url="?curid=1060184" title="StarDict">
<text>StarDict, developed by Hu Zheng (胡正), is a free GUI released under the GPL-3.0-or-later license for accessing StarDict dictionary files (a &quot;dictionary shell&quot;). It is the successor of StarDic, developed by Ma Su&#x27;an (馬蘇安), continuing its version numbers.

According to StarDict&#x27;s earlier homepage on SourceForge, the project has been removed from SourceForge due to copyright infringement reports. It moved to Google Code and then back to SourceForge, while development is now seemingly continued on GitHub.

==Supported platforms==
StarDict runs under Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, Maemo and Solaris. Dictionaries of the user&#x27;s choice are installed separately. Dictionary files can be created by converting dict files.

Several programs compatible with the StarDict dictionary format are available for different platforms. For the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, applications available in the App Store include GuruDic, TouchDict, weDict, Dictionary Universal, Alpus and others, as well as the free iStarDict, which is available for the Cydia Store.

==Dictionaries available==
One can find here the partial list of FreeDict dictionaries which can be converted to the StarDict format. These include, in particular, some older versions of Webster&#x27;s dictionary and many dictionaries for various languages.

==Features==
While StarDict is in &quot;scan mode&quot;, results are displayed in a tooltip, allowing easy dictionary lookup. When combined with Freedict, StarDict will quickly provide rough translations of foreign language websites.

On September 25, 2006, an online version of Stardict began operation. This online version includes access to all the major dictionaries of StarDict, as well as Wikipedia in Chinese.

Previous versions of StarDict were very similar to the PowerWord dictionary program, which is developed by a Chinese company, KingSoft. Since version 2.4.2, however, StarDict has diverged from the design of PowerWord by increasing its search capabilities and adding lexicons in a variety of languages. This was assisted by the collaboration of many developers with the author.

Evgeniy A. Dushistov produced the command line version of StarDict called sdcv.

<text>The Synod of the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, commonly called the Norwegian Synod, was founded in 1853. It included churches in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

==History==
In February 1853, several Lutheran ministers including Claus Lauritz Clausen, Hans Andreas Stub, Adolph Carl Preus, Herman Amberg Preus, G. F. Dietrichson, Jacob Aall Ottesen, and R. D. Brandt organized the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, commonly known as the Norwegian Synod. It was organized at Koshkonong and Luther Valley near the Jefferson Prairie Settlement outside Madison, Wisconsin. Among the first denominational leaders was Ulrik Vilhelm Koren. The synod adopted the ritual of the Church of Norway. In 1868 the name was changed to the Synod for the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

In the early years Norwegian Synod seminary students were sent to Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri. Luther College was founded near La Crosse, Wisconsin, in 1861, and relocated to Decorah, Iowa, the next year. Peter Laurentius Larsen served as president of Luther College from 1861 until he resigned from the presidency in 1902.

In 1876, the denomination established Luther Seminary in Madison, Wisconsin, (later moved to St. Paul). Desiring unity and cooperation with fellow Lutherans, in 1872 the Norwegian Synod was a co-founder of the Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America along with the Missouri, Wisconsin, and Ohio synods. However, the Norwegian Synod soon experienced internal division over questions concerning predestination and conversion, and during the 1880s about a third of its congregations left. These dissenting &quot;Anti-Missourian Brotherhood&quot; congregations joined in 1890 with the Norwegian Augustana Synod and the Norwegian-Danish Conference to form the United Norwegian Lutheran Church of America (Norwegian:&quot;Den Forenede Kirke&quot;).

Further attempts at Lutheran unity continued into the early 20th century. The 1912 Madison Settlement (Norwegian: &quot;Madison Opgjør&quot;), agreed upon by representatives of the Hauge Synod, the United Church, and the Norwegian Synod, called for doctrinal discussions and compromises to take place so that Norwegian Lutherans could unite into a single jurisdiction. The result was the Austin Agreement of 1916, and on June 9, 1917, the United Church, the Hauge Synod, and the Norwegian Synod merged to become the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America. In 1946, that body changed its name to the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Through a series of mergers, it became part of the American Lutheran Church in 1960, and currently the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA).

After the merger of 1917, a small group who chose not to join the merger for doctrinal reasons, reorganized as the Norwegian Synod of the American Evangelical Lutheran Church (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Little Norwegian Synod&quot;). This group committed itself “to continue in the old doctrine and practice of the Norwegian Synod&quot;. In 1957, it changed its name to become the Evangelical Lutheran Synod.

<doc id="1060187" wikidata="Q1324641" url="?curid=1060187" title="Maria Full of Grace">
<text>Maria Full of Grace (Spanish title: &quot;María, llena eres de gracia&quot;, lit., &quot;Maria, you are full of grace&quot;) is a 2004 Spanish-language drama film written and directed by Joshua Marston. The film was a US-Colombia co-production. The story follows a Colombian girl who becomes a drug mule for a trafficking ring. Lead actress Catalina Sandino Moreno won Best Actress at the Berlin Film Festival, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in the 77th Academy Awards.

==Plot==
Seventeen-year-old Colombian girl Maria Álvarez works in sweatshop-like conditions at a flower plantation. Her income helps support her family, including an unemployed sister who is a single mother, but after unjust treatment from her boss, she quits her job de-thorning roses, despite her family&#x27;s vehement disapproval. Shortly thereafter, Maria discovers she is pregnant by her boyfriend, and he suggests marriage, but she declines because she does not feel she loves him, although he loves her. On her way to Bogotá to find a new job, she is offered a position as a drug mule. Desperate, she accepts the risky offer, and swallows 62 wrapped pellets of drugs, and flies to New York City with her friend Blanca, who has also been recruited as a drug mule.

Maria is almost caught by U.S. customs who are suspicious after finding Maria&#x27;s $800 in cash and wanting to make a surprise visit to a sister she &quot;hasn&#x27;t seen in years&quot;, but not knowing anywhere else to go if she isn&#x27;t home. She tells them that the father of her child paid for her plane ticket. She avoids being X-rayed due to her pregnancy, and is released. The traffickers collect Maria, Blanca, and Lucy, another more experienced mule that Maria had befriended during her recruitment. The mules are held in a motel room until they pass all the drug pellets. Lucy falls ill when a drug pellet apparently ruptures inside her. Unknown to the traffickers, Maria witnesses them carrying Lucy out of the hotel room, and she sees blood stains in the bathtub. She comes to the conclusion that the traffickers cut her open to retrieve the other drug pellets inside her body. Scared, Maria convinces Blanca to escape with her while the traffickers are gone. They leave with the drugs they have passed.

Maria has nowhere to sleep, and goes to Lucy&#x27;s sister&#x27;s house, but doesn&#x27;t reveal to the sister that Lucy is dead. Blanca soon joins her there. Eventually the sister unexpectedly hears of their involvement in her sister&#x27;s death and throws them out. Blanca and Maria make an agreement to return the drugs to the traffickers and receive their money. Maria uses some of her drug money to send Lucy&#x27;s body home to Colombia for a proper burial. Maria and Blanca are ready to board the plane back to Colombia when Maria decides to stay in the United States. Blanca returns home without Maria.

==Cast==
==Production==
=== Writing ===
Writer and director Joshua Marston was inspired to write the film after a conversation he had with a real-life drug mule who transported illegal drugs inside her body. He first attempted to write a script about the drug war, but decided to abandon a more polemical, broader approach in favor of a more personal one. For research, he interviewed prisoners, flower plantation workers in Colombia, U.S. Customs inspectors, and Colombian immigrants living in Queens, New York. When Marston showed his finished script to potential producers, they resisted his decision to shoot the film in Spanish and suggested big-name actresses like Penélope Cruz or Jennifer Lopez for Maria. Marston gave the script to producer Paul Mezey, who loved it and took it to HBO. Marston said, &quot;HBO told Paul to just make it. In Spanish. With a first-time filmmaker. With an unknown cast. I think I owe my first-born child to HBO.&quot;
=== Casting ===

Marston considered about 800 actresses to play Maria; with weeks to go before filming, Colombian actress Catalina Sandino Moreno sent in an audition tape and won the role, her first screen credit. As preparation, Sandino Moreno worked on a flower plantation for two weeks.

The character of Don Fernando is played by Orlando Tobón, who is known as the &quot;Mayor of Little Colombia&quot; in Queens. The character is based on Tobón’s real-life work as a counselor and middleman for Colombian immigrants in need. Tobón is also credited as an associated producer on the film.

=== Filming ===

Filming was planned to take place in Colombia, but was prevented due to several bombings prior to the country’s 2002 presidential election. Venezuela was considered as an alternate option until an attempted coup d’état erupted, so filming eventually took place in the Ecuadorian village of Amaguaña. The film shot for 20 days in Ecuador, with a second unit in Colombia, and 20 days in New York.

To ease the process of making a bilingual film, Marston encouraged the actors to improvise: &quot;[During rehearsals] I gave all the actors half the script for 24 hours and then took it back from them. I didn’t want them to know how it ended. I took it back so that three weeks later, when we started improvising, we could improvise loosely based on what was written, so they wouldn’t be stuck on the words. We would arrive at a location and start improvising and do three or four improvs based on a rough memory of what happened in the scene. Then we would open the script and reread what I had written, turn to a blank page, pass a pen around in a circle and rewrite the scene together. So partly the structure of the scene would change, but more frequently the actual word choice would change. This was so [the actors] would have a certain sense of ownership over the way their characters spoke.&quot;

In the film, Sandino Moreno swallowed real pellets, though they were not latex and contained an easily digestible sugar-like substance.

== Release ==
&quot;Maria Full of Grace&quot; was first shown on 18 January 2004 at the Sundance Film Festival in the United States. On 11 February 2004, it was shown at the Berlin Film Festival. It premiered in Colombia on 2 April 2004. The film was originally going to premiere on HBO, but the film’s success at Sundance, as well as the success of Latina film &quot;Real Women Have Curves&quot;, prompted Fine Line Features to release the film theatrically. The film had a limited release on 16 July 2004, before going wide in the United States on 6 August 2004.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film was critically acclaimed. It garnered a 97% approval rating on the aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 146 reviews, and an average rating of 8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;In a striking debut, Moreno carries the movie and puts a human face on the drug trade&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 87 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

According to Desson Thomson from &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Catalina Sandino Moreno is a Colombian Mona Lisa, a delicate, unforgettable force majeure. Add to her luminous demeanor a story that rips fleshy holes through your heart and you&#x27;ve got yourself a stunner of a film&quot;. Roger Ebert awarded the film 3 and a half stars out of 4 and said, &quot;Like [Ken] Loach, Marston has made a film that understands and accepts poverty without feeling the need to romanticize or exaggerate it. Also like Loach, he shows us how evil things happen because of economic systems, not because villains gnash their teeth and hog the screen. Hollywood simplifies the world for moviegoers by pretending evil is generated by individuals, not institutions; kill the bad guy, and the problem is solved.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Peter Travers gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, praising Moreno&#x27;s performance, the screenplay, and Marston&#x27;s direction, saying: &quot;Remember the name Catalina Sandino Moreno. The heartfelt and harrowing performance she gives here should put her in line for a heap of year-end awards.&quot;

The film was nominated to the Golden Bear at the 54th Berlin Film Festival.

The film had originally been selected by Colombia to be its official choice for Best International Feature at the 77th Academy Awards. However, it was rejected because it was considered to be not Colombian enough; the film &quot;El Rey&quot; was submitted instead.

===Box office===
Its total worldwide gross stands at $12,594,630 ($6,529,624 at the American box office, and $6,065,006 from other territories).

<doc id="1060188" wikidata="Q746614" url="?curid=1060188" title="1967 NFL Championship Game">
<text>The 1967 NFL Championship Game, commonly referred to as the Ice Bowl, was the 35th NFL championship, played on December 31 at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

It determined the NFL&#x27;s champion, which met the AFL&#x27;s champion in Super Bowl II, then formally referred to as the second &quot;AFL–NFL World Championship Game&quot;. The Dallas Cowboys (9–5), champions of the Eastern Conference, traveled north to meet the Western champion Green Bay Packers (9–4–1), the two-time defending league champions. It was a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s title game, and pitted two future Hall of Fame head coaches against each other, Tom Landry for the Cowboys and Vince Lombardi for the Packers. The two head coaches had a long history together, as both had coached together on the staff of the late 1950s New York Giants, with Lombardi serving as offensive coordinator and Landry as defensive coordinator.

Because of the adverse conditions in which the game was played, the rivalry between the two teams, and the game&#x27;s dramatic climax, it has been immortalized as the Ice Bowl and is considered one of the greatest games in NFL history. NFL 100 Greatest Games ranked this game as the 3rd greatest game of all time. It is still the coldest game ever played in NFL history.

Leading up to the 50th Anniversary of the game, NFL Films released an episode of its &quot;Timeline&quot; series about the events that day and the lasting impact. The episode is narrated and co-produced by filmmaker Michael Meredith, whose father Don Meredith was the quarterback for the Cowboys that day.

==Route to the NFL championship==
The NFL added a sixteenth team in and realigned to four divisions, with each winner advancing to the postseason. Future hall of fame head coach Tom Landry of Dallas led his team to first place in the Capitol Division with a 9–5 record. The Green Bay Packers, and future hall of fame head coach Vince Lombardi, won the Central Division with a 9–4–1 record.

===1967 NFL playoffs===

In the first round of the four-team playoffs, the Cowboys met the Century Division champions, the Cleveland Browns (9–5) for the Eastern Conference title. In the Western Conference, the Packers hosted the Los Angeles Rams (11–1–2), the Coastal Division champions (with the league&#x27;s best record). The Baltimore Colts of the Coastal Division were also 11–1–2, but lost the tiebreaker to the Rams and were excluded from the postseason.

At the Cotton Bowl, in a spectacular game by quarterback Don Meredith, the Cowboys obliterated the Browns 52–14. In the week prior to the Rams game, Vince Lombardi inspired his team all week with a rendition of St. Paul&#x27;s &quot;Run to Win&quot; letter to the Corinthians and, in what Bart Starr would later say was Lombardi&#x27;s most rousing pre-game speech, incited his team to a 28–7 victory over the Rams at Milwaukee County Stadium.

The home field for the NFL Championship alternated between the two conferences; even-numbered years were hosted by the Eastern and odd-numbered by the Western. Starting with the season, playoff sites were determined by regular season record, rather than a rotational basis.

==Buildup==
The 1967 game was a rematch of the previous season played in Dallas on January 1, 1967, just 364 days earlier. More than two years after football had become the most popular televised sport in the nation, this game featured a match up that all of America hoped for in the NFL Championship.

Landry&#x27;s and Lombardi&#x27;s paths crossed in 1954 with the New York Giants when Lombardi became the offensive coordinator and Landry, the left cornerback for the Giants, took on the added role of defensive coordinator. Landry was the best defensive mind of his era and Lombardi was the best offensive coach of his era. From a personality standpoint, Landry and Lombardi were the antithesis of each other. Lombardi was a vociferously demanding coach who would respond with the greatest elation to success and tremendous sadness to the slightest setback. Landry was stoic and calm in even the most tense situations.

The Las Vegas betting line listed the Packers as 6½-point favorites. The Cowboys would employ their vaunted &quot;Doomsday Defense&quot;, a nickname given to the defensive unit by a Dallas journalist because it had been successful at making goal line stands. The eight-year-old Dallas franchise was trying to win its first world championship. The Packers were on a quest to achieve what had never been done before in the modern era – three consecutive world championships (Green Bay had previously won three championships in a row, 1929–1931, when titles were determined on a won-loss percentage basis). To the game, Green Bay brought its renowned Packers sweep and the Cowboys brought a defensive scheme, the Flex, which was specifically designed by Landry to stop the &quot;running to daylight&quot; tactic the Packers employed in their sweep. Although the Packers and the Chicago Bears were arch-rivals, Lombardi&#x27;s most passionate game planning was in preparing for Landry&#x27;s &quot;Flex&quot;.

Saturday, on the eve of the game, NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle called Jim Kensil and Don Weiss, the executive directors of the NFL, for an update on the weather conditions. It is suspected that they informed him that Sunday&#x27;s game time temperature of about was playable. Rozelle, who in June 1966 had seen to it that the AFL-NFL Championship game would always be in a warm weather city, inquired if the game could be postponed until Monday. Predictions held Monday would be even colder than Sunday and the game was not postponed. Little did they know that the cold front would be far colder and would arrive much sooner than expected. The Packers, who had for years eschewed late-season home games because of the cold winters, would play host to the Cowboys in a game that would mark the coldest New Year&#x27;s Eve in the history of Green Bay, and the coldest title game in the history of the NFL, a record that still stands.
David Maraniss recounts in his 1999 Vince Lombardi biography &quot;When Pride Still Mattered&quot; that Packers safety Willie Wood left his home Sunday morning to find his car&#x27;s battery frozen and dead. When a local service-station attendant was summoned to start the car, Wood told him, &quot;It&#x27;s just too cold to play. They&#x27;re going to call this game off.&quot;

==&quot;The Ice Bowl&quot;==

===Weather===
The game became known as the Ice Bowl because of the brutally cold conditions. The game-time temperature at Lambeau Field was about , with an average wind chill around ; under the revised National Weather Service wind chill index implemented in 2001, the average wind chill would have been . Lambeau Field&#x27;s turf-heating system malfunctioned, and when the tarpaulin was removed from the field before the game, it left moisture on the field. The field began to freeze gradually in the extreme cold, leaving an icy surface that became worse as more and more of the field fell into the shadow of the stadium. The heating system, made by General Electric, cost $80,000 and was bought from the nephew of George Halas, George S. Halas. On the sidelines before the game, some Dallas players believed that Lombardi had purposely removed power to the heating coils. The heating system would eventually be given the moniker &quot;Lombardi&#x27;s Folly&quot;. The prior convention to prevent the football field from icing up was to cover the field with hay.

The Wisconsin State University–La Crosse (now the University of Wisconsin–La Crosse) Marching Chiefs band was scheduled to perform the pre-game and half-time shows. However, during warm-ups in the brutal cold, the woodwind instruments froze and would not play; the mouthpieces of brass instruments got stuck to the players&#x27; lips; and seven members of the band were transported to local hospitals for hypothermia. The band&#x27;s further performances were canceled for the day. Packer linebacker Dave Robinson recalled that the field did not get really bad until the second half, saying that since the halftime show was canceled there was no traffic on the field for an extended period to keep the surface crust broken up. During the game, an elderly spectator in the stands died from exposure.

Prior to the game, many of the Green Bay players were unable to start their cars in the freezing weather, forcing them to make alternate travel arrangements to make it to the stadium on time. Linebacker Dave Robinson had to flag down a random passing motorist for a ride. The officials for the game found they did not have sufficient clothing for the cold, and had to make an early trip to a sporting goods store for earmuffs, heavy gloves, and thermal underwear. Packers quarterback Bart Starr attended an early church service with his father, who had visited for the game, and as Starr later said, &quot;It was so cold that neither of us talked about it. Nobody wanted to bring it up.&quot;

The officials were unable to use their whistles after the opening kick-off. As referee Norm Schachter blew his metal whistle to signal the start of play, it froze to his lips. As he attempted to free the whistle from his lips, the skin ripped off and his lips began to bleed. The conditions were so hostile that instead of forming a scab, the blood simply froze to his lip. For the rest of the game, the officials used voice commands and calls to end plays and officiate the game. Nothing was immune from the cold; at one point during the game, CBS commentator Frank Gifford remarked, &quot;I&#x27;m going to take a bite of my coffee,&quot; as it too had frozen in the mug.

===Media===
The game was televised by CBS, with play by play being done by Ray Scott for the first half and Jack Buck for the second half, while Frank Gifford handled the color commentary for the entire game. Pat Summerall and Tom Brookshier served as sideline reporters.

Gifford and Summerall were intimately aware of the personality differences that existed between Landry and Lombardi because they had both played on the New York Giants during Landry&#x27;s and Lombardi&#x27;s tenure at the Giants. Over 30 million people would tune in to watch the game.

No copy of the complete telecast is known to exist. Some excerpts (such as the announcers&#x27; pre-game comments on the field) were saved and are occasionally re-aired in retrospective features. The Cowboys&#x27; radio broadcast on KLIF, with Bill Mercer announcing, and the Packers&#x27; radio broadcast on WTMJ, with Ted Moore announcing, still exist.

==Game summary==
Kickoff was shortly after 1 pm CST. The Packers took a 14–0 lead after two touchdown passes from Bart Starr to Boyd Dowler on their first three possessions of the game. However, despite gaining only two first downs in the first half, Dallas scored twice off Green Bay fumbles late in the half to cut the Packers&#x27; lead to 14–10.

The Cowboys then started the second half with a long drive into Green Bay territory, but lost the ball on a fumble. However, they took the lead, 17–14, on a 50-yard halfback option pass by Dan Reeves on the first play of the fourth quarter. After missing a potential game-tying field goal, Green Bay scored the game-winning touchdown on its subsequent drive, re-gaining the lead, 21–17, with only 13 seconds remaining.

===First half===
Aided by two Dallas penalties and a 17-yard reception from Donny Anderson, Green Bay opened up the scoring with an 83-yard, 16-play drive that took nearly 9 minutes off the clock. Bart Starr detected a blitz coming on the Dallas 8-yard line, audibled, and rifled a touchdown pass to Boyd Dowler, giving the team a 7–0 first quarter lead. Green Bay&#x27;s defense quickly forced a punt, and their offense stormed back for another score, this time driving 65 yards. After a 13-yard run by Ben Wilson and a 6-yard run by Travis Williams, the Packers moved to a third-and one on the Dallas 43-yard line. Starr faked to Ben Wilson and threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Dowler who got behind Mel Renfro, making the score 14–0. Then on the second play of the Cowboys ensuing drive, defensive back Herb Adderley intercepted Don Meredith&#x27;s pass and returned it 15 yards to the Dallas 32. But after a run for no gain and an incompletion, Cowboys lineman George Andrie sacked Starr for a 10-yard loss, pushing Green Bay out of field goal range.

Dallas&#x27; offense went the entire second quarter without gaining a first down, but Green Bay committed two costly turnovers that led to 10 Dallas points. First, Starr lost a fumble while being sacked by Cowboys lineman Willie Townes. Andrie recovered the ball and returned it 7 yards for a touchdown, cutting the lead in half. Then, with time almost out in the second quarter, Packers safety Willie Wood fumbled a Dallas punt after calling for a fair catch, and Cowboys rookie defensive back Phil Clark recovered the ball at the Green Bay 17-yard line. The Packers were able to keep Dallas out of the end zone, but kicker Danny Villanueva kicked a 21-yard field goal to cut the deficit to 14–10 by halftime.

===Second half===
In the third quarter, the Cowboys finally managed to get a sustained drive going, moving the ball to the Green Bay 18-yard line. But Packers linebacker Lee Roy Caffey ended the drive by forcing a fumble from Meredith that was recovered by Adderley. Then after a Packers punt, Dallas once again got moving with a drive to the Green Bay 30-yard line. But once again they failed to score as Caffey sacked Meredith for a 9-yard loss on third down and Villanueva missed a 47-yard field goal attempt.

On the first play of the final quarter, the Cowboys took a 17–14 lead with running back Dan Reeves&#x27; 50-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lance Rentzel on a halfback option play. The Cowboys ran the play to their left side, figuring that Green Bay would not expect the right-handed Reeves to throw from that side.

Later in the quarter, a 15-yard facemask penalty on Dallas rookie Dick Daniels during a Wood punt return gave Green Bay the ball on the Cowboys 47-yard line. The Packers then drove into scoring range and had a chance to tie the game, but kicker Don Chandler missed a 40-yard field goal attempt.

The Cowboys then gained two first downs before Green Bay stopped them at the Dallas 38. Meredith had slipped trying to retreat to pass on third down, but got up and fired a desperation heave that landed harmlessly between Green Bay defenders. With just over 5 minutes remaining, Villanueva punted the ball deep into Packer territory, and Wood returned it nine yards before being brought down at the Packers own 32-yard line.

====The Drive====
In their last offensive drive, the Packers took possession at their own 32-yard line with 4:50 left in regulation time. With the wind chill around Starr led his team down the field, toward the south end zone. He began the drive with a double fake to his backs, but after no one was open downfield he flipped a safety valve pass to running back Donny Anderson who gained six yards. Fullback Chuck Mercein then picked up seven on a sweep around right end, and went out of bounds to stop the clock. Starr dropped straight back on first down and fired a 13-yard pass to Dowler over the middle. Cornell Green&#x27;s tackle slammed the receiver&#x27;s helmet off the icy turf, and Max McGee replaced Dowler. Dallas end Willie Townes broke through and smothered Anderson for a 9-yard loss on what was supposed to be a halfback option play.

Anderson had told Starr on the sideline that he could pick up 8 to 10 yards on dump passes since the Dallas linebackers were laying back. Starr used this tip to complete two passes to Anderson for 12 and 9 yards, gaining a key first down on the Dallas 30. Anderson juked linebacker Chuck Howley on both plays and ran by him as Howley sprawled on the icy turf. Mercein told Starr he was also open on the left, and Starr flipped him a pass that the fullback carried down to the Cowboys 11-yard line and out of bounds with 1:11 to play. Then Starr called a play he had kept ready for the right situation, 54-Give, a play that Lombardi frankly called the &quot;sucker&quot; play in the Packer playbook. Left guard Gale Gillingham pulled to his right like it was a typical sweep, and Cowboy right tackle Bob Lilly with his great reflexes instantly followed him. The Packers&#x27; left tackle Bob Skoronski blocked Cowboy end George Andrie and Mercein shot through the hole to the 3-yard line.

Anderson carried on the next play to the 1-yard line for a first down (some Cowboys thought Anderson scored on this play, but the officials missed it). Twice Anderson attempted to run the ball into the end zone, but both times he slipped on the icy field before taking the handoff and was tackled inside the 1-yard line. The second time he almost fell down before Starr gave him the ball. By then the thermometer read and the Packers called their last timeout. With the low winter sun angle and the shade of the stands, the south end of the field had received a minimal amount of sunlight. The game had started off shortly after and it was nearing sunset.

====The Block====
On third-and-goal at the Dallas two-foot line with 16 seconds remaining, Starr went to the sidelines to confer with Lombardi. Starr had asked right guard Jerry Kramer whether he could get enough traction on the icy turf for a wedge play, and Kramer responded with an unequivocal yes. 
Summerall told the rest of CBS crew to get ready for a roll-out pass, because without any timeouts remaining a failed run play would end the game. Landry would say he expected a rollout pass attempt because an incompletion would stop the clock and allow the Packers one more play on fourth down, either for a touchdown (to win) or a field goal attempt (to tie and send the game into overtime). But Green Bay&#x27;s pass protection on the slick field had been seriously tested during the game; the Cowboys had sacked Starr eight times.

On the sidelines, according to Starr, he told Lombardi, &quot;Coach, the linemen can get their footing for the wedge, but the backs are slipping. I&#x27;m right there, I can just shuffle my feet and lunge in.&quot; Lombardi told Starr, &quot;Run it, and let&#x27;s get the hell out of here!&quot; Lombardi was asked by Pat Peppler what play Starr would call, to which Lombardi replied, &quot;Damned if I know.&quot; Starr returned to the huddle and called a &quot;Brown right 31 Wedge.&quot; The play was a short yardage play using a double-team block to force an opening for the fullback. Starr made the play call in the huddle, but did not tell his teammates he was keeping the ball. Kramer and center Ken Bowman executed a &quot;post-drive&quot; block (double-team) on left defensive tackle Jethro Pugh and Starr lunged across the goal line for a

====Conclusion====
Don Chandler kicked the extra point to make the score 21–17. Dallas downed the kickoff in their end zone, and after two Dallas incompletions the game was over. At the conclusion of the game, jubilant Packers fans streamed onto the field knocking over Packers and Cowboys players alike. Since the playoff era began in 1933, the 1967 Packers are the only team to win a third consecutive NFL title. (The 1931 Packers won a third consecutive, but without a postseason.)

==Aftermath==
Emotionally, both the Packers and Cowboys players were spent. In the Packers&#x27; locker room, the players openly wept. Kramer told interviewers, &quot;Many things have been said about Coach (Lombardi). And he is not always understood by those who quote him. The players understand. This is one beautiful man.&quot; Packers linebacker Ray Nitschke developed frostbite in his feet, causing his toenails to fall off and his toes to turn purple. Bart Starr had frostbite on his fingers and several Packer players were suffering from flu-like symptoms. Cowboys George Andrie, Willie Townes, and Dick Daniels also suffered frostbite from the game.

The furthest thing from Starr&#x27;s mind was the thought of playing in the AFL–NFL World Championship Game. To him, this was the Packers&#x27; championship game. Green Bay went on to finish the postseason by easily defeating the American Football League (AFL) champion Oakland Raiders, 33–14, in the second AFL–NFL World Championship Game.

Brookshier and other journalists went into the winning locker room for post-game interviews. At some point, journalists had become aware of the significance of the block Kramer and Bowman had placed on Pugh. Of the eleven cameras Ed and Steve Sabol set up to film the game, the pivot and motion capabilities of &quot;Camera Five&quot; had become frozen by the time Starr&#x27;s sneak occurred. This particular camera, however, was fortuitously positioned to offer a perfect view of &quot;the block&quot;. CBS had been replaying &quot;the block&quot; repeatedly and had been giving the TV audience a detailed perspective of the workings of the offensive and defensive line.

Frank Gifford recounted in his 1993 autobiography &quot;The Whole Ten Yards&quot; that he requested and received permission from CBS producers to go into the losing locker room for on-air post-game interviews—a practice unheard of in that era. Gifford, as a New York Giants player and a broadcaster, already enjoyed a friendship with Meredith, and he approached the quarterback for his thoughts on the game. The exhausted Meredith, in an emotion-choked voice, expressed pride in his teammates&#x27; play, and said, in a figurative sense, that he felt the Cowboys did not really lose the game because the effort expended was its own reward. Gifford wrote that the interview attracted considerable attention, and that Meredith&#x27;s forthcoming and introspective responses played a part in his selection for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; telecasts three years later. Defensive tackle Bob Lilly took a different view, telling reporters that the Cowboys were a great team except that they could not win the &quot;big one&quot;. Wide receiver Lance Rentzel later remarked that on the team plane home from Green Bay to Dallas&#x27; Love Field, &quot;not one word was spoken the entire flight.&quot;

==Legacy==
The game was the end of an era and the beginning of another. This would be the last year the NFL championship game was considered more important than the AFL-NFL World Championship Game, for in the following year Joe Namath and the New York Jets staged an upset victory over the Baltimore Colts that would bring the AFL to full legitimacy and validate the merger of the two leagues that had been agreed upon in 1966 and would be consummated in 1970. Landry, along with others, believed that football games should never be held in weather conditions so harsh. In the post-merger era of the NFL, the World Championship Game (as the Super Bowl is officially called) would be offered to cities on a bid, and no outdoor stadium in a &quot;cold-weather city&quot; would be offered the World Championship Game until 2013, when MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, hosted Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014. The NFL, reflecting the impact the &quot;Ice Bowl&quot; had on the sport, considered the selection of MetLife Stadium to be a &quot;one off&quot; occasion. Fortunately, the temperature at kickoff was a relatively hospitable degrees, and the game just missed a snowstorm that came the following day.

With Green Bay having won five NFL championships in seven years and the first two Super Bowls, Vince Lombardi retired as head coach of the Packers on February 1, 1968, but retained his position of general manager for the 1968 season. 
Many Dallas players described this game as the most devastating loss of the 1966–1970 period. Having lost this game and the 1966 title game in the winning seconds of each game, Landry was subject to criticism that he was unable to win the &quot;Big One&quot;, a stigma that persisted until Dallas won its first NFL title in the 1971 season. In the three seasons following 1967, the Cowboys suffered two upsets in the playoffs to the Cleveland Browns, then lost Super Bowl V to the Baltimore Colts 13–16 on a last-second field goal. Schramm considered this game to be the turning point to Dallas becoming &quot;America&#x27;s Team&quot; because of the way the Cowboys battled back in the game.

There has been a bit of revisionism in some Cowboys memories concerning the game. Frank Clarke thought the Packers&#x27; final drive was &quot;lucky football,&quot; though Chuck Howley acknowledged that the Cowboys&#x27; double coverage on the wide receivers left the backs open underneath. Cornell Green even claimed that a bad pass interference call, &quot;the worst call I&#x27;ve seen in history,&quot; on Dave Edwards aided the Packers&#x27; final drive: &quot;That was the game.&quot; In reality, the play Green recalled in which Starr threw a pass behind Donny Anderson happened back in the first quarter; but the call was defensive holding (Willie Townes held tight end Marv Fleming), a 5-yard penalty, and the infraction occurred before Starr threw the pass. There were no penalties called on either team during the final Packers drive. Even Tom Landry in the NFL Film of the Ice Bowl stated that if he had realized the field was frozen, the Cowboys would have switched to a zone defense.

If the Packers did not score on the final drive, Lombardi likely would not have become the iconic fixture in football that he is. Landry later remarked that on the &quot;tundra&quot; of Lambeau Field the better team lost, and that it was Lombardi&#x27;s ability to develop &quot;character&quot; in his Packers that gave them the ability to never lose hope. Schramm believed that Lombardi&#x27;s installation of the heating-coils under the playing field showed he was more concerned with sportsmanship than winning. At Lombardi&#x27;s funeral mass in 1970 in New York, Cardinal Terence Cooke gave the eulogy, based on Lombardi&#x27;s favorite scripture, the &quot;run to win&quot; passage that concludes chapter 9 of the First Epistle to the Corinthians.

Interviewed by reporters amid the Packers&#x27; post-game celebrations, Jerry Kramer&#x27;s comments about Lombardi were widely quoted later. Intimating that past press treatments of the coach, including an unflattering 1967 &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine piece by sportswriter Leonard Schecter were unfair, Kramer said &quot;Many things have been said about Coach. And he is not always understood by those who quote him. The players understand. This is one beautiful man.&quot;

The synergy between Gifford and Meredith in the post-game interview prompted Roone Arledge to team Gifford with Meredith and Howard Cosell for the second season of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; in 1971. Don Meredith would never win a championship, but he would later become more famous as an announcer for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; than he had been as a player. Although Landry and Lombardi were very different, they did respect each other and regarded each other as friends.

A few months later, Lombardi assembled family members, friends and journalists to his home to watch &quot;The Greatest Challenge&quot;, the 1967 Packers season highlight film, which was produced by Ed Sabol and his son, Steve, and narrated by John Facenda. In the finale of the film, Facenda would say of the Green Bay Packers:
ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCentury&quot; ranked it as #6 on the Greatest Games of the 20th Century in 1999, one of three NFL Games to reach that mark (Super Bowl III in 1969 at #3 and the 1958 NFL Championship Game in 1958 as #1.).

NFL Films produced two highlight films of the Ice Bowl itself, one called &quot;A Chilling Championship&quot; narrated by William Woodson, and another version which was the NFL Game of the Week with a different narrator. Those films were then later used to produce the NFL Films recreation of the game in their &quot;Greatest Games Series&quot;, released on VHS and on the Packers History DVD.

On the NFL Network&#x27;s countdown program, &quot;NFL Top 10&quot;, the Ice Bowl has been named the top or near the top of several lists such as:
* Top 10 Bad Weather Games– #1
* Top 10 Games with a Name– #2
* Top 10 Gutsy Calls– #1 (Bart Starr&#x27;s sneak)
* Top 10 Clutch drives– #4
The multimedia narrative &quot;17776&quot;, which centers on fantastically arduous football games, refers to the 1967 game and to Gifford&#x27;s &quot;bite of my coffee&quot; jape in its first chapter.

In 2017, NFL Films produced an episode of its series &quot;The Timeline&quot; about the Ice Bowl. The episode is co-produced and narrated Michael Meredith, a New York-based filmmaker and son of the Cowboys’ quarterback that day, Don Meredith. At the end of his review, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Peter King wrote &quot;I highly recommend you watch this documentary if you love a good history story, or if you love football—or, of course, if you love either team.&quot; Among the people interviewed about the game included actor Willem Dafoe, who attended the game as a 12-year old.

===Ice Bowl II===
Since the original Ice Bowl game, there have been other playoff games at Lambeau Field that have been dubbed by fans and/or the media as &quot;Ice Bowl II&quot;:

* The 1996 NFC Championship Game between the Packers and the Carolina Panthers. It was noted that many Packers fans had hoped for the Cowboys, who the Panthers had eliminated from the playoffs the previous week, to come to Green Bay, since the Packers have played the Cowboys in Dallas in each of the previous 7 meetings between the two teams, all of which were Cowboys victories. The game time temperature lived up to the &quot;Ice Bowl II&quot; moniker, with a reported kick-off temperature of with a −17° wind chill. The Packers won 30–13, earning their first trip to the Super Bowl since 1967. The Packers then went on to win Super Bowl XXXI.
* The 2007 NFC Championship Game between the Packers and the New York Giants. With a game time temperature of with a −23° wind chill, this game was the coldest game at Lambeau Field since the Ice Bowl. A back and forth game, the Giants won in overtime on a Lawrence Tynes 47-yard field goal, 23–20. The Giants then went on to win Super Bowl XLII, upsetting the undefeated New England Patriots. This game was also Brett Favre&#x27;s last game as a Green Bay Packer.
* The 2014 NFC Divisional playoff game between the Packers and the Cowboys. This game marked the Cowboys&#x27; first playoff appearance at Lambeau Field since the Ice Bowl, and their first visit to Green Bay since 2010. Compared to the original Ice Bowl, as well as the other games called &quot;Ice Bowl II&quot;, this game had relatively mild temperatures, especially for Green Bay in January, with a game time temperature of . This game also had two interesting winning streaks on the line, as the Packers had been 8–0 at Lambeau Field during the regular season, while the Cowboys were 8–0 on the road during the regular season. The Cowboys led for most of the game, with the Packers&#x27; Aaron Rodgers, playing with a strained left calf, helping give the Packers the lead late in the second half. Late in the 4th quarter, the Cowboys went for it on 4th down, with Tony Romo throwing a deep pass to Dez Bryant that initially looked like a catch that would&#x27;ve given the Cowboys a first down at the 1-yard line of Green Bay. A replay challenge by the Packers showed that Bryant was unable to complete the reception of the pass, therefore making the pass incomplete and turning the ball over to the Packers, who ran out the clock the rest of the way in a 26–21 win. Coincidentally, the disputed Dez Bryant catch occurred at the 1-yard line of Lambeau Field&#x27;s south end zone, the same yard line where Bart Starr made his game-winning quarterback sneak in the original Ice Bowl.

<text>Valtellina or the Valtelline (occasionally spelled as two words in English: Val Telline; ; or ; ; ) is a valley in the Lombardy region of northern Italy, bordering Switzerland. Today it is known for its ski centre, hot spring spas, bresaola, cheeses (in particular Bitto, named after the river Bitto) and wines. In past centuries it was a key Alpine pass between northern Italy and Germany. The control of the Valtellina was much sought after, particularly during the Thirty Years&#x27; War as it was an important part of the Spanish Road.

==Geography==
The most important comune of the valley is Sondrio; the others major centres are Aprica, Morbegno, Tirano, Bormio and Livigno. Although Livigno is on the northern side of the alpine watershed, it is considered part of Valtellina as it falls within the province of Sondrio.

==History==

===Antiquity and the middle ages===
The region was conquered in 16 BC by the Romans. By the 5th century, it was Christianized with around ten pieve (rural churches with a baptistery) under the Diocese of Como. The Lombards gained control over the area after 720, but about fifty years later Charlemagne gave the valley to Saint Denis Monastery near Paris. Later the valley returned to the Bishop of Como.

===Early modern period===
During the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, the Valtellina belonged to the Three Leagues (the &quot;Grey Leagues&quot;), which was then a mutual-defence region independent of Switzerland but is now the easternmost Swiss Canton of Graubünden. Graubünden is an area in which German, Romansh, Lombard and Italian are all spoken, and hence during 16th-century rule by Graubünden, the region became known variously as &quot;Veltlin&quot;, &quot;Westtirol&quot; (West Tyrol), and the &quot;Welsche Vogteien&quot; (&quot;Romanic Bailiwicks&quot;).

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Valtellina was a theatre of intense military and diplomatic struggle among France, the Habsburg powers and the local authorities which culminated in the Valtellina war of 1620–1626. Control over the routes through the Valtellina to the passes between Lombardy and the Danube watershed was at stake as it formed part of the so-called Spanish Road. The anti-Habsburg forces in the Three Leagues put together a court named &#x27;clerical overseers&#x27; that between 1618 and 1620 handed down a number of convictions (often &quot;in absentia&quot;) against Catholics in the Leagues and Valtellina. This included the arresting under false pretences and torturing to death of the (catholic) arch-priest Nicolò Rusca of Sondrio. This and similar harsh judgments of the anti-Habsburg Thusis court led to a conspiracy to drive the Protestants out of the valley. The leader of the conspiracy, Giacomo Robustelli of the Planta family, had ties to Madrid, Rome and Paris. On the evening of 18/19 July 1620, a force of Valtellina rebels supported by Austrian and Italian troops marched into Tirano and began killing Protestants. When they finished in Tirano, they marched to Teglio, Sondrio and further down the valley killing every Protestant that they found. Between 500 and 600 people were killed on that night and in the following four days. The attack drove nearly all the Protestants out of the valley, prevented further Protestant incursions and took the Valtellina out of the Three Leagues. The killings in Valtellina were part of the conflicts in Graubünden known as the &quot;Bündner Wirren&quot; or Confusion of the Leagues.

In February 1623 France, Savoy, and Venice signed the Treaty of Paris in which all three signatories agreed to re-establish the territory of Valtellina by attempting to remove Spanish forces stationed there.

===18th and 19th centuries===
In 1797 the growing power of the First French Republic created the Cisalpine Republic in Northern Italy. On 10 October 1797, the French supported a revolt in the Valtellina against the Graubünden (&quot;Grisons&quot; in French and English), and it joined the Cisalpine Republic.

After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the Valtellina became part of the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, which was a constituent land of the Austrian Empire. In 1859 it came, together with Lombardy, to the Kingdom of Sardinia, and finally in 1861 it became part of the Kingdom of Italy.

At the end of the 19th century, there was substantial migration out of the Valtellina for reasons of the prevailing economically depressed conditions of the region and for young men to avoid conscription. Australia, especially Western Australia, was a popular destination for such migrants.

Industrially, the area is famous as the home of the world&#x27;s first mainline electrified railway. The electrification of the Ferrovia della Valtellina took place in 1902, using three-phase power at 3,600 V, with a maximum speed of 70 km/h. The system was designed by the brilliant Hungarian engineer Kálmán Kandó who was employed by the main contractors the Budapest-based Ganz company.

===Mussolini and the Valtellina Redoubt===

During the last months of World War II, the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and other diehard fascist leaders of the Italian Social Republic (RSI) proposed making a &quot;last stand&quot; against the advancing Allied armies in the Valtellina. The Fascist Party secretary Alessandro Pavolini was the main proponent of the idea, which he first raised with Mussolini in September 1944. However, the fascist leadership was divided over the plan and only minimal preparatory work was carried out to establish the area as a stronghold. By the time the Allies made their final advance in April 1945, the Valtellina was not ready to be used as a redoubt. In any event, Mussolini&#x27;s capture on 27 April by the partisans at Dongo, barely short of the Valtellina, ended any possibility of a fascist last stand.

==Culture and language==
The official language is Italian, but the Valtellinese variety of the Lombard Language is also spoken.

== Folklore ==

=== &quot;L&#x27;è foeu el sginer&quot; and &quot;l&#x27;è foeu l&#x27;ors de la tana&quot; ===
On 31 January there was the tradition of &quot;l&#x27;è foeu el sginer&quot; (&quot;January&#x27;s out&quot;), a custom very similar to that celebrated on 2 February known as &quot;l&#x27;è foeu l&#x27;ors de la tana&quot; (&quot;the bear is out from its den&quot;). Both celebrated the end of winter and the imminent arrival of spring. The two customs involved walking around the town and inviting people to leave their houses under any pretext, like throwing a large piece of wood or a pot down the stairs. When people ran outside to check what had happened, they were greeted with the shout &quot;l&#x27;è foeu el sginer!&quot; or &quot;l&#x27;è foeu l&#x27;ors de la tana!&quot;

=== &quot;Intraverser l’ann&quot; ===
&quot;Intraverser l&#x27;èn&quot; or &quot;intraverser l&#x27;ann&quot; (literally &quot;to put the year across&quot;) also celebrated New Year&#x27;s Eve: during the night young people used to build barricades of gates, doors, benches, agricultural tools, logs, stairs, sledges, and carts in the main square or in front of the church, to prevent the old year from leaving. The next morning, the owners of the stolen objects had to go and recover them, dismantling the barricade and metaphorically opening up the way to the new year.

=== The &quot;gabinat&quot; ===
On 6 January, the custom of the &quot;gabinat&quot; is still celebrated today, especially in Tirano, in the Upper Valley, and in the nearby Poschiavo Valley (Switzerland). Traditionally, children would suddenly enter other people&#x27;s homes shouting &quot;gabinat!&quot; and in exchange, they would receive a handful of cooked chestnuts, some sweets or dried fruit. The adults competed to precede the other in exclaiming &quot;gabinat&quot; when they met. Whoever lost had to pay a pledge; often, the prize at stake was established in advance and the gabinat thus became the object of bets. To win, various strategies were adopted: stalking, disguises, fake illnesses ... Nowadays, it is only the children who do the &quot;gabinat&quot;, and they usually show up to relatives, friends, and local shopkeepers.

The custom of the &quot;gabinat&quot; most likely comes from Bavaria, Germany, where Christmas, New Year&#x27;s Eve and Epiphany were indicated with the name Geb-nacht (&quot;Gaben&quot; means &quot;gifts&quot; and &quot;Nacht&quot; means &quot;night&quot;, therefore &quot;night of gifts&quot;): on the eve of these holidays, the poor young people sang in front of the doors of the wealthiest in the hope to receive a gift.

=== &quot;Andà a ciamà l&#x27;erba&quot; (Let&#x27;s go call the grass) ===
On the first of March, throughout Valtellina and Valchiavenna, people used to go to &quot;ciamà l&#x27;erba&quot; (&quot;call the grass&quot;). The children walked in the meadows making noise with cowbells to call the grass and awaken it from its winter slumber. This custom also served to propitiate a bountiful harvest.

=== The &quot;Carneval vegg&quot; (Old Carnival) ===
In the village of Grosio, the Carnival is celebrated, unlike the rest of Valtellina, on the first Sunday of Lent, according to the Ambrosian calendar in force before the Gregorian Reform. For this reason, it is called &quot;Carneval vegg&quot; (&quot;Old Carnival&quot;).

In the past, it was customary for people to gather all together to dance, sing, eat and drink. Being an agricultural ritual that represents the death of winter and the beginning of summer, Carnival officially began on January 17 with the parade of the blessed cattle adorned with coloured ribbons. It included numerous bonfires, with which the paths were cleared to facilitate the passage of farmers, their agricultural vehicles and their livestock. A straw puppet with horns on his head representing the Carnival was also burnt.

Nowadays, the districts of the towns challenge each other to the sound of allegorical floats, and the parade is attended by traditional masks, eight characters representing traditions, past events, and moments of everyday life: the Old Carnival, a bearded and joyful man dressed as a mountaineer, and Lean Lent, a thin woman dressed in a humble way, with a dark handkerchief on her head and an empty basket on her arm, represent the transition from the glories of Carnival to Lenten fasts. They are accompanied by the Paralytic, the Bear Handler, a funny shepherd who dances and rolls on the ground named Toni, an old man with a butt covered with Nutella, a hunchbacked mountaineer whose hump is filled with chestnut urchins, and Bernarda, a man disguised as a baby put in a pannier supported by a fake old woman, and accompanied by another man dressed as a farmer).

During the Carnival period, &quot;manzòli&quot; or &quot;manzòla&quot;, white flour and buckwheat pancakes mixed with slices of cheese and cut into the shape of a calf were eaten to propitiate the abundance of livestock parts.

=== The &quot;Carneval di Mat&quot; (Carnival of the fools) ===
In Bormio, during the day of the Carnival of the Fools, the Mayor hands over his power to the &quot;Podestà di Mat&quot; (Podestà of the Fools) to Harlequin, and to the &quot;Compagnia di Mat&quot; (&quot;the Company of the Fools&quot;) who give a public reading of the gossip and complaints that citizens have deposited in a box placed in the square of the Kuerc. The festival also includes a parade along the streets of the historic centre led by the Harlequins of the Company of Mat, with children escorting the Podestà.
=== &quot;La&quot; &quot;coscrizione&quot; (the conscription) ===
The conscription was originally a celebration on the occasion of the call to the draft: the tradition seems to have originated in the second half of the nineteenth century with the unification of Italy when young men were forced to serve a period in the Army. The feast of the conscripts of eighteen-year-olds was therefore a kind of rite of passage to adulthood. Today is simply the celebration of the coming of age.

The duration of the celebration varied from town to town: in Grosio the conscription could last up to ten days, during which the boys and girls met in bars, taverns, or in places specially set up for the purpose. The conscripts had the task of embroidering on the tricolour flag the symbol and possibly the motto that the group had chosen. On the walls of the villages, it was customary to write &quot;W LA CLASSE...&quot; (&quot;cheers to the year...&quot;) followed by the year of birth: nowadays, conscripts hang a tricolour banner with the same wording and the names (or nicknames) of the members of the group.

The feast of the conscripts is particularly felt in Alta Valtellina: in Grosio, for a week, the conscripts meet in a club to celebrate and travel through the streets of the town in a car from which the flag decorated with the symbol of the group waves. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, amid fireworks and the noise of whistles, cowbells, motorcycles, and tractors, they entrust the flag to conscripts one year younger, after having it blessed in church. Each group chooses different coloured sweatshirts and decorates the tricolour with a symbol that represents the group&#x27;s motto or identity.
=== &quot;I Pasquali&quot; ===
The &quot;Pasquali&quot; are allegorical floats with a religious theme, prepared during the winter by the various districts of Bormio (Buglio, Combo, Dossiglio, Dossorovina and Maggiore) for Easter (Pasqua meaning Easter in Italian). On Easter day, the Pasquali are carried on the shoulders of the boys and are accompanied by a band, folk groups, women, seniors, and children who embellish the parade with flowers and other small crafts. Everyone wears the traditional red, black and white costume. After having followed the entire Via Roma and upon arrival at the Piazza del Kuerc (the main square of the town) the ancient bell called Bajona starts tolling and a jury draws up a ranking of the best Pasquali. At the end of the parade, the floats are exhibited in Piazza del Kuerc where they stay until Easter Monday.

=== &quot;Il Palio delle Contrade&quot; ===
Started in 1963, the &quot;Palio delle Contrade&quot; sees the inhabitants of the five districts of Bormio compete against each other, divided according to age, in downhill, cross-country, combined, and relay races. The cross-country race takes place through the streets of the town, covered with snow for the purpose.

==Wines==
In Valtellina, wines are produced mainly from &quot;Chiavennasca&quot; (the local name of Nebbiolo grape variety) with other minor varieties such as Rossola nera permitted up to 20% for the &quot;Denominazione di origine controllata&quot; (DOC) and 10% for the &quot;Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita&quot; (DOCG). Grapes are limited to a harvest yield of 12 tonnes per hectare. The finished wine must be aged for at least two years prior to release (three years if a &quot;Riserva&quot; bottling) with a minimum alcohol level of at least 11%. Yields for the DOCG wines are further restricted to a maximum of 8 tonnes/ha. While the ageing requirements are the same as the DOC, the minimum alcohol level for the DOCG wine is 12%.

The best-known villages for red wines are: Grumello, Sassella, Inferno, Valgella, and Maroggia. The village names are normally indicated on the label. Additionally, there is an Amarone style DOCG wine called Sforzato (Sfursat).

In the lower part of the Val Poschiavo, the valley in the Graubünden canton of Switzerland that descends into the Valtellina at Tirano, similar wines are produced – but under different regulations such as appellation and the allowance of sugar addition, or chaptalization.

== Tourism ==
One of the most notable tourist attractions of the area is the Bernina Line (&quot;Trenino Rosso&quot;, little red train) of the Rhaetian Railway, which links the town of Tirano in the Valtellina with St. Moritz in Graubünden, Switzerland via the Bernina Pass. The mountains of the Valtellina offer numerous possibilities for sports activities: skiing and winter sports in Bormio, Aprica or Livigno, hiking and biking in the same locations and especially in the secondary valleys, and rock climbing in the Val Masino.

The Rupe Magna, a unique large rock with more than 5,000 engraved figures dating from between the 4th and 1st millennia BCE, can be found at the Rock Engraving Park in Grosio.

<doc id="1060205" wikidata="Q599135" url="?curid=1060205" title="Chalk Farm tube station">
<text>Chalk Farm is a London Underground station near Camden Town in the London Borough of Camden. It is on the Edgware branch of the Northern line between Belsize Park and Camden Town stations. For ticketing purposes, Chalk Farm falls in Travelcard Zone 2. With slightly under five million entries and exits in 2011, Chalk Farm is one of the busiest stations on the Edgware branch of the Northern line.

==History==
The station was opened on 22 June 1907 by the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway (CCE&amp;HR). Trains originally operated between Golders Green and Charing Cross, with extensions to Edgware and Kennington in 1923–24 and 1926, respectively. All trains ran via the Charing Cross branch. As part of a comprehensive signing scheme, the &#x27;UndergrounD&#x27; lettering was added in 1908.

With the subsequent extension of the City and South London Railway (C&amp;SLR) to Camden Town in 1924, the CCE&amp;HR and C&amp;SLR were joined, allowing through running on the Bank branch and service as far south as Clapham Common, extending to Morden in 1926.

==Station layout==
Chalk Farm station lies at the intersection of Haverstock Hill (the northern extension of Chalk Farm Road) and Adelaide Road, which create an angular intersection that forms the centre of the neighbourhood of the same name.

===Architecture===
Chalk Farm&#x27;s narrow, wedge-shaped station building gives it the longest frontage of any of the stations designed by architect Leslie Green for the three tube lines owned by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London and opened in 1906 and 1907. It also has the shallowest lift shafts of any Underground station (21 ft). Station refurbishment by Tube Lines was completed in 2005. The station is a Grade II listed building.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 1, 31, 393 and night routes N5, N28 and N31 serve the station.

==Gallery==

==In popular culture==
London ska/pop band Madness posed outside of Chalk Farm tube station for the covers of their no. 2 UK hit album &quot;Absolutely&quot; and no. 3 UK single Baggy Trousers.

<doc id="1060212" wikidata="Q6544096" url="?curid=1060212" title="Liederkranz cheese">
<text>Liederkranz is an American re-creation of Limburger cheese, made subtly different by the use of a different bacterial culture for smear-ripening. Liederkranz is a cow&#x27;s milk cheese, with an edible pale yellow-orange tan crust, and a semisoft, pale interior with a mildly pungent flavor and distinct aroma that could become unpleasantly ammonia-like if aged incorrectly. 

Liederkranz was created in 1891 by Emil Frey (1867–1951), a young Swiss cheesemaker in Monroe, New York, who later also created Velveeta there in 1923. Frey was apprenticed to Adolph Tode, who ran the Monroe Cheese Company, as well as a New York City delicatessen. They named the cheese after a local singing society, a Liederkranz Club (&quot;singing circle&quot;), perhaps the famous one in New York, or perhaps just on a whim for its Germanic sound.

Until the original line went out of production, the cheese was sold in small boxes, with perforations in the sides. The return of the product sees it wrapped in aroma-proof foil. It is very similar in flavor to the French cheese Époisses.

The Monroe Cheese Company, the original source of Liederkranz, passed to new ownership, but Emil Frey stayed on and followed Liederkranz production to Van Wert, Ohio, in 1926. In 1929, the company was sold to the Borden Company. Frey retired in 1938. 

At the end of 1981, after a fire damaged its Van Wert plant, Borden terminated its natural cheese lines in favor of &quot;processed cheese&quot;. A few months later the Fisher Cheese Company purchased the Van Wert plant and began to produce Liederkranz. In 1985, bacterial contamination of a batch of Liederkranz and several other cheeses induced Fisher to withdraw Liederkranz from the market, selling the franchise and the bacterial culture to Beatrice Foods (Beatrice has since been acquired by ConAgra) and the New Zealand Dairy Board. That was the last batch of Liederkranz to be made for 25 years.

In 2010, the cheese was reintroduced by DCI Cheese Company of Richfield, Washington County, Wisconsin, which had acquired the trademark and the cultures (whose survival had been doubted during Liederkranz&#x27;s long absence from the market).

Liederkranz was the favorite cheese of poet W. H. Auden, having been recommended to him by T. S. Eliot.

<doc id="1060222" wikidata="Q1193609" url="?curid=1060222" title="Peiligang culture">
<text>The Peiligang culture was a Neolithic culture in the Yi-Luo river basin (in modern Henan Province, China) that existed from about 7000 to 5000 BC. Over 100 sites have been identified with the Peiligang culture, nearly all of them in a fairly compact area of about 100 square kilometers in the area just south of the river and along its banks.

==Peiligang culture==
The culture is named after the site discovered in 1977 at Peiligang, a village in Xinzheng County, Zhengzhou, north-central Henan province. Archaeologists believe that the Peiligang culture was egalitarian, with little political organization.

The culture practiced agriculture in the form of cultivating millet and animal husbandry in the form of raising pigs and possibly poultry. The people hunted deer and wild boar, and fished for carp in the nearby river, using nets made from hemp fibers. The culture is also one of the oldest in ancient China to make pottery. This culture typically had separate residential and burial areas, or cemeteries, like most Neolithic cultures. Common artifacts include stone arrowheads, spearheads and axe heads; stone tools such as chisels, awls and sickles for harvesting grain; and a broad assortment of pottery items for such purposes as cooking and storing grain.

==Jiahu==
The site at Jiahu is the earliest site associated with Peiligang culture. There are many similarities between the main group of Peiligang settlements and the Jiahu culture, which was isolated several days&#x27; travel to the south of the main group. Archaeologists are divided about the relationship between Jiahu and the main group. Most agree that Jiahu was part of the Peiligang culture, pointing to the many similarities. A few archaeologists are pointing to the differences, as well as the distance, believing that Jiahu was a neighbor that shared many cultural characteristics with Peiligang, but was a separate culture. The cultivation of rice, for example, was unique to Jiahu and was not practiced among the villages of the main Peiligang group in the north. Also, Jiahu existed for several hundred years before any of the settlements of the main group.

<doc id="1060223" wikidata="Q258437" url="?curid=1060223" title="Epsilon Minus">
<text>Epsilon Minus were a Canadian EBM/techno/trance band formed in 2000 by Bogart Shwadchuck and Jennifer Parkin. The name &quot;Epsilon Minus&quot; is a reference to Aldous Huxley&#x27;s novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;.

== History ==

Epsilon Minus was started in 2000 by the duo of Bogart Shwadchuck and Jennifer Parkin. They released their self-titled debut album, &quot;Epsilon Minus&quot;, with Parkin on vocals, in May 2002 on Belgian record label Alfa Matrix. They followed in April 2003 with an electronic dance album titled &quot;Mark II&quot;. Parkin left the band during the making of &quot;Mark II&quot; to form Ayria and released &quot;Debris&quot; on Alfa Matrix. In an interview with &quot;Side-Line&quot;, Shwadchuck stated:
Shwadchuck continued Epsilon Minus as a solo act, releasing the &quot;Pre-Initialized&quot; EP and the &quot;Reinitialized&quot; LP, exhibiting greater psychedelic trance and intelligence dance influences, in 2004. &quot;Reinitialized&quot; featured collaborations with Kristy Venrick (The Azoic), Martha M. Arce (Distorted Reality), Eric Oehler (Null Device), and Ned Kirby (Stromkern). Shwadchuck ended the project in 2005, releasing the short &quot;R.I.P.&quot; EP of leftovers and outtakes, and continued to record under his own name, as well as under the aliases &quot;Artifice,&quot; &quot;Sex Genius,&quot; and &quot;Chester Fantastico.&quot; He briefly resurrected Epsilon Minus to perform a remix for The Gothsicles.

<doc id="1060226" wikidata="Q274404" url="?curid=1060226" title="Claudio Magris">
<text>Claudio Magris (; born 10 April 1939) is an Italian scholar, translator and writer. He was a senator for Friuli-Venezia Giulia from 1994 to 1996.

==Life==
Magris graduated from the University of Turin, where he studied German studies, and has been a professor of modern German literature at the University of Trieste since 1978.

He is an essayist and columnist for the Italian newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; and for other European journals and newspapers. His numerous studies have helped to promote an awareness in Italy of Central European culture and of the literature of the Habsburg myth, a concept which he coined in 1963.

Magris is a member of several European academies and served as a senator in the Italian Senate from 1994 to 1996.

His first book on the Habsburg myth in modern Austrian literature rediscovered central European literature. His journalistic writings have been collected in &quot;Dietro le parole&quot; (&quot;Behind Words&quot;, 1978) and &quot;Itaca e oltre&quot; (&quot;Ithaca and Beyond&quot;, 1982). He has written essays on E.T.A. Hoffmann, Henrik Ibsen, Italo Svevo, Robert Musil, Hermann Hesse and Jorge Luis Borges. His novels and theatre productions, many translated into several languages, include &quot;Illazioni su una sciabola&quot; (1984), &quot;Danubio&quot; (1986), &quot;Stadelmann&quot; (1988), &quot;Un altro mare&quot; (1991), and &quot;Microcosmi&quot; (1997).

His breakthrough was &quot;Danubio&quot; (1986), which is a magnum opus. In this book (said by the author to be a &quot;drowned novel&quot;), Magris tracks the course of the Danube from its sources to the sea. The whole trip evolves into a colourful, rich canvas of the multicultural European history.

<text>The mineriads () were a series of protests and often violent altercations by Jiu Valley miners in Bucharest during the 1990s, particularly 1990–91. The term &quot;mineriad&quot; is also used to refer to the most significant and violent of these encounters, which occurred June 13–15, 1990. During the 1990s, the Jiu Valley miners played a visible role in Romanian politics, and their protests reflected inter-political and societal struggles after the Romanian Revolution.

==January 1990 mineriad==

===28 January===

After the National Salvation Front&#x27;s decision to transform itself into a political party, an anti-Communist demonstration took place in Bucharest&#x27;s Victoria Square (Piața Victoriei), organised by the Christian Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚ-CD), National Liberal Party (PNL), and other historical and newly founded oppositional smaller parties. 

Even though the anti-Communist demonstration started out (and was intended to be) non-violent, the protesters charged the Parliament building and demanded the resignation of the FSN party. After that, the FSN started talks with the parliamentary opposition parties.

===29 January===

The miners boarded the trains at Gara de Nord and departed to their homes, but not before President Ion Iliescu thanked them for their services.

==February 1990 mineriad==

Less than a month after the January mineriad, another anti-Communist manifestation took place in Bucharest on February 18. Despite the demonstrators&#x27; pleas to non-violence, several persons started throwing stones into the Government building. Riot police and army forces intervened to restore order, and on the same night, 4,000 miners headed to Bucharest.

Opposition leaders and independent media speculated that the demonstration was manipulated by the Securitate and the FSN. Miners maintained their relative innocence of the violence, claiming that the agitation and most of the brutality was the work of Iliescu’s government agents who had infiltrated and disguised themselves as miners.

==June 1990 mineriad==

The Romanian miners of the Jiu Valley were called by the newly elected power to Bucharest to end the riots that broke up on 13 June 1990. As President Ion Iliescu put it, the miners were called to save the &quot;besieged democratic regime&quot; and restore order and democracy in Bucharest. The government trucked in thousands of miners from the Jiu Valley to Bucharest to confront the demonstrators. The rest of Romania and the world watched the government television broadcasts of miners and other unionized workers brutally grappling with students and other protesters.

Over the course of a month-long demonstration in University Square, many protesters had gathered with the goal of attaining official recognition for the 8th demand of the popular Proclamation of Timișoara, which stated that communists and former communists (including President Iliescu himself) should be prevented from holding official functions. Supporters of the opposition were dissatisfied with Iliescu&#x27;s first government, which was made up mostly of former communists, claiming that it implemented reforms very slowly or not at all. The protests mostly ended after Iliescu’s FSN obtained a decisive victory (over two thirds of the votes) in the May 20th elections. However, a small group decided to continue protests and staged a hunger strike. Following attempts of the authorities to clear up the University Square, where the protesters had been squatting during the previous months, some among the protesters grew violent and attacked the police headquarters and the national television station. When the police were unable to contain the violence, Iliescu appealed to the miners to &quot;defend the country&quot;. Special trains transported some 10,000 miners to the capital, where the miners violently confronted anyone they saw as opposing the government.

The official figures state that during the third mineriad, seven people were killed and more than a thousand were wounded. In contrast to state statistics, the opposition newspaper România Liberă claimed that on 29 June 1990 over 40 bodies were buried in a common grave in Străulești, near Bucharest. Conspiracy theories and rumors circulated as to the origins and development of the mineriad, with some believing that both the Romanian Presidency and Secret Service had a hand in it. Later parliamentary inquiries into the potential role of the Secret Service contributed to the widespread public mistrust of the post-Ceaușescu intelligence service.

Government inquiries would show that the miners had indeed been &quot;joined by vigilantes who were later credibly identified as former officers of the Securitate&quot;, and that for two days, the miners had been aided and abetted by the former Securitate members in their violent confrontation with the protesters and other targets.

==September 1991 mineriad==

===24 September===

On September 24, 1991, the miners from the Jiu Valley began a general strike and requested that Prime Minister Petre Roman visit Petroșani to listen to their grievances. The trade union leader Miron Cozma warned representatives of the Government that if the miners&#x27; dissatisfactions were not resolved as demanded, the miners will come in large numbers to Bucharest. During this time the sub-prefect, Ionel Botoroaga, and the director of the Autonomous Directorate of Oil, Benone Costinaș, were assaulted in the Petrosani town hall. A group of miners then went to the Petrosani train station, where they demanded and were refused the use of trains for the miners to travel to Bucharest. 

===25 September===

On the morning of September 25, around 10.00 am, the miners from the Jiu Valley arrived at Băneasa railway station on several trains. Upon hearing the news that the miners were heading to the capital, the Prime Minister and President Ion Iliescu unsuccessfully tried several maneuvers to prevent them from reaching their destination. Led by the miners&#x27; union leader, Miron Cozma, the first stop was made in Victoriei Square, where the miners asked for a meeting with Prime Minister Petre Roman. When he did not appear, they asked for his resignation. Roman then agreed and met with a delegation of miners. Cornel Tomescu, head of the sector within the General Secretariat of the Government, said that upon arrival in Victoria Square, the miners were not violent. &quot;The miners were calm, they did not shout slogans to the Government or the president and they were sitting on the caldera.&quot; During this period, altercations with counter-protesters and security forces broke out. A Government building was attacked by some groups, leading to the evacuation of the building. In the evening, the miners, led by Cozma, headed towards the Romanian Television and University Square. They then went to the Cotroceni Palace to discuss with President Ion Iliescu the conditions under which they were willing to withdraw. Cozma demanded the dismissal of Prime Minister Roman in exchange for a cessation of the miners&#x27; protest.

===26 September===

On September 26, the miners attacked the Government building with new forces and called for the Government to be dismissed. Representatives of the miners met for private talks with government officials. Miron Cozma threatened that if by 12:00 PM the resignation of the prime minister was not announced, he would call 40,000 trade unionists from Pipera, adding that probably no one wants a civil war. At 12:00, Alexandru Bârlădeanu, the president of the Senate, announced on the public television the dismissal of the Romanian Government. The mining union leader asks the miners to go home because their claims have been resolved. In the afternoon of that day, the miners entered the Assembly Hall of the Assembly of Deputies and requested the resignation of President Ion Iliescu and the resolution of all the claims for which they came to Bucharest. Following discussion, the miners returned to the Jiu Valley with the promise made that their demands would be addressed. Two days later Miron Cozma and the president of the country Ion Iliescu signed a statement that formally ended the mineriad. 

==January and February 1999 mineriads==

The Jiu Valley miners left again for Bucharest, unhappy with the governmental reduction of the subsidies, which would result in the closing of the mines. The barricade installed by the gendarmes at Costești was crossed by the miners and near Râmnicu Vâlcea a Gendarmerie unit was ambushed by the miners. Reaching Râmnicu Vâlcea, they sequestered the prefect of Vâlcea County. Radu Vasile, Prime Minister at the time, negotiated an agreement with Miron Cozma, the miners&#x27; leader, at the Cozia Monastery, nearby.

On 14 February 1999, Cozma was found guilty for the 1991 mineriad and sentenced for 18 years in prison. The miners led by Cozma left for Bucharest attempting a new mineriad, only this time they were stopped by the police at Stoenești, Olt. In the clash that followed, 100 policemen and 70 miners were wounded and at least one miner died. Cozma was arrested and sent to a prison in Rahova.

==Legal issues==

Ion Iliescu pardoned Cozma&#x27;s sentence on December 15, 2004, a few days before his term ended, but revoked the decision two days later, having faced the outrage of Romanian and international media and politicians.

Cozma successfully challenged the legality of the withdrawal of the pardoning, and on the 14th of June 2005 he was freed by the Judge Court of Dolj county. However, on September 28, 2005, Cozma was sentenced by the Romanian High Court of Cassation and Justice to serve 10 years in prison for the January 1999 Mineriad, which included time already served. His request to be released on parole was denied on June 2, 2006. After serving the full term, Cozma was finally released on 2 December 2007, but was restricted from returning to either Petroșani or Bucharest.

<text>James Lewis Duncan (1892 – 8 April 1960) was a Canadian politician and lawyer.

== Early life ==
Duncan was the son of a physician and grandson of a Presbyterian minister. He studied at the University of Toronto and in Paris and won a silver medal as a student at Osgoode Hall Law School. He fought in the First World War at the Somme, Vimy Ridge and Passchendaele. He was appointed military administrator of occupied Bonn, Germany and ended the war with the rank of Major.

== Career ==
Returning to Canada he was appointed chair of a Fair Price Commission on milk, wrote a book on bankruptcy law and sat on a royal commission investigating farm fraud in British Columbia and helped write Canada&#x27;s Combines Investigation Act.

In the 1930s, Ontario Hydro retained Duncan for a two-year investigation, leading him to be criticized by the Ontario Premier Mitchell Hepburn for charging $17,000 in legal fees. Duncan was expelled from the ruling Ontario Liberal Party and responded by comparing Hepburn to Adolf Hitler and Hepburn called Duncan &quot;a rat.&quot;

He was elected to Toronto City Council in the 1930s and ran for Mayor of Toronto in 1939 but was defeated by Ralph C. Day by a margin of 39,000 votes and again in 1940 by only 4,000 votes. He returned to city council as a member of the Board of Control in 1941 topping the polls in the election for the four-person executive body (the Mayor sat &quot;ex officio&quot; as the Chairman) and sat on the body until 1944. As Vice-Chairman of the Board of Control, Duncan charged the city with being run as a family compact and accused the Toronto Transit Commission of not disclosing its books. Duncan also started a major investigation in 1942 when he charged that a child receiving relief had died of malnutrition.

Duncan ran as a federal Liberal candidate for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1940 election in the Danforth electoral district. He was defeated in a two-way race against Conservative John Henry Harris.

Duncan then joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Ontario Section), and ran again for Mayor of Toronto in 1944 but was defeated by Frederick J. Conboy by 20,000 votes. He also ran in the 1945 Ontario election as the CCF&#x27;s candidate in the riding of High Park against George Drew, accusing him of being financed by &quot;beer barons&quot;, but was defeated. He then challenged Ontario CCF Ted Jolliffe for the party&#x27;s leadership, but was defeated by Jolliffe at the 1946 leadership convention in Hamilton, Ontario.

Duncan had a colourful reputation as a lawyer. He once challenged a Supreme Court justice to step out of his courtroom and repeat his statements in the hallway and was fined $2,000 in 1957 for &quot;scandalizing the court&quot; when he asked a Supreme Court justice to withdraw himself from a hearing without giving a reason. He never paid the fine but was barred thereafter from arguing cases before the Supreme Court.

== Death ==
Duncan died aged 68, on 8 April 1960, when he shot himself to death in the washroom of a downtown Toronto department store. According to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper, Duncan was &quot;long disturbed over the death of his only son, John, in the Second World War.&quot;

<doc id="1060236" wikidata="Q7520902" url="?curid=1060236" title="Simplicial homology">
<text>In algebraic topology, simplicial homology is the sequence of homology groups of a simplicial complex. It formalizes the idea of the number of holes of a given dimension in the complex. This generalizes the number of connected components (the case of dimension 0).

Simplicial homology arose as a way to study topological spaces whose building blocks are &quot;n&quot;-simplices, the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional analogs of triangles. This includes a point (0-simplex), a line segment (1-simplex), a triangle (2-simplex) and a tetrahedron (3-simplex). By definition, such a space is homeomorphic to a simplicial complex (more precisely, the geometric realization of an abstract simplicial complex). Such a homeomorphism is referred to as a &quot;triangulation&quot; of the given space. Many topological spaces of interest can be triangulated, including every smooth manifold (Cairns and Whitehead).

Simplicial homology is defined by a simple recipe for any abstract simplicial complex. It is a remarkable fact that simplicial homology only depends on the associated topological space. As a result, it gives a computable way to distinguish one space from another.

== Definitions ==

=== Orientations ===
A key concept in defining simplicial homology is the notion of an orientation of a simplex. By definition, an orientation of a &quot;k&quot;-simplex is given by an ordering of the vertices, written as (), with the rule that two orderings define the same orientation if and only if they differ by an even permutation. Thus every simplex has exactly two orientations, and switching the order of two vertices changes an orientation to the opposite orientation. For example, choosing an orientation of a 1-simplex amounts to choosing one of the two possible directions, and choosing an orientation of a 2-simplex amounts to choosing what &quot;counterclockwise&quot; should mean.

=== Chains ===
Let be a simplicial complex. A simplicial -chain is a finite formal sum

:formula_1
where each is an integer and is an oriented -simplex. In this definition, we declare that each oriented simplex is equal to the negative of the simplex with the opposite orientation. For example,
:formula_2

The group of -chains on is written . This is a free abelian group which has a basis in one-to-one correspondence with the set of -simplices in . To define a basis explicitly, one has to choose an orientation of each simplex. One standard way to do this is to choose an ordering of all the vertices and give each simplex the orientation corresponding to the induced ordering of its vertices.

=== Boundaries and cycles ===
Let be an oriented -simplex, viewed as a basis element of . The boundary operator

:formula_3

is the homomorphism defined by:

:formula_4

where the oriented simplex 
:formula_5

is the face of , obtained by deleting its vertex.

In , elements of the subgroup

:formula_6

are referred to as cycles, and the subgroup

:formula_7

is said to consist of boundaries.

=== Boundaries of boundaries ===

Because formula_8, where formula_9 is the &quot;second&quot; face removed, formula_10. In geometric terms, this says that the boundary of a boundary of anything has no boundary. Equivalently, the abelian groups

:formula_11

form a chain complex. Another equivalent statement is that is contained in .

As an example, consider a tetrahedron with vertices oriented as formula_12. By definition, its boundary is given by
:formula_13. 
The boundary of the boundary is given by
:formula_14

=== Homology groups ===
The homology group of is defined to be the quotient abelian group

:formula_15

It follows that the homology group is nonzero exactly when there are -cycles on which are not boundaries. In a sense, this means that there are -dimensional holes in the complex. For example, consider the complex obtained by gluing two triangles (with no interior) along one edge, shown in the image. The edges of each triangle can be oriented so as to form a cycle. These two cycles are by construction not boundaries (since every 2-chain is zero). One can compute that the homology group is isomorphic to , with a basis given by the two cycles mentioned. This makes precise the informal idea that has two &quot;1-dimensional holes&quot;.

Holes can be of different dimensions. The rank of the homology group, the number

:formula_16

is called the Betti number of . It gives a measure of the number of -dimensional holes in .

==Example==

=== Homology groups of a triangle ===
Let be a triangle (without its interior), viewed as a simplicial complex. Thus has three vertices, which we call , and three edges, which are 1-dimensional simplices. To compute the homology groups of , we start by describing the chain groups :

* is isomorphic to with basis 
* is isomorphic to with a basis given by the oriented 1-simplices , , and . 
* is the trivial group, since there is no simplex like formula_17 because the triangle has been supposed without its interior. So are the chain groups in other dimensions.

The boundary homomorphism : is given by:
:formula_18
:formula_19
:formula_20
Since , every 0-chain is a cycle (i.e. ); moreover, the group of the 0-boundaries is generated by the three elements on the right of these equations, creating a two-dimensional subgroup of . So the 0th homology group is isomorphic to , with a basis given (for example) by the image of the 0-cycle (). Indeed, all three vertices become equal in the quotient group; this expresses the fact that is connected.

Next, the group of 1-cycles is the kernel of the homomorphism ∂ above, which is isomorphic to , with a basis given (for example) by . (A picture reveals that this 1-cycle goes around the triangle in one of the two possible directions.) Since , the group of 1-boundaries is zero, and so the 1st homology group is isomorphic to . This makes precise the idea that the triangle has one 1-dimensional hole.

Next, since by definition there are no 2-cycles, (the trivial group). Therefore the 2nd homology group is zero. The same is true for for all not equal to 0 or 1. Therefore, the homological connectivity of the triangle is 0 (it is the largest for which the reduced homology groups up to are trivial).

=== Homology groups of higher-dimensional simplices ===
Let be a tetrahedron (without its interior), viewed as a simplicial complex. Thus has four 0-dimensional vertices, six 1-dimensional edges, and four 2-dimensional faces. The construction of the homology groups of a tetrahedron is described in detail here. It turns out that is isomorphic to , is isomorphic to too, and all other groups are trivial. Therefore, the homological connectivity of the tetrahedron is 0.

If the tetrahedron contains its interior, then is trivial too.

In general, if is a -dimensional simplex, the following holds:

* If is considered without its interior, then and and all other homologies are trivial;
* If is considered with its interior, then and all other homologies are trivial.

==Simplicial maps==

Let &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; be simplicial complexes. A simplicial map &quot;f&quot; from &quot;S&quot; to &quot;T&quot; is a function from the vertex set of &quot;S&quot; to the vertex set of &quot;T&quot; such that the image of each simplex in &quot;S&quot; (viewed as a set of vertices) is a simplex in &quot;T&quot;. A simplicial map &quot;f&quot;: determines a homomorphism of homology groups for each integer &quot;k&quot;. This is the homomorphism associated to a chain map from the chain complex of &quot;S&quot; to the chain complex of &quot;T&quot;. Explicitly, this chain map is given on &quot;k&quot;-chains by

:formula_21

if are all distinct, and otherwise .

This construction makes simplicial homology a functor from simplicial complexes to abelian groups. This is essential to applications of the theory, including the Brouwer fixed point theorem and the topological invariance of simplicial homology.

== Related homologies ==
Singular homology is a related theory that is better adapted to theory rather than computation. Singular homology is defined for all topological spaces and depends only on the topology, not any triangulation; and it agrees with simplicial homology for spaces which can be triangulated. Nonetheless, because it is possible to compute the simplicial homology of a simplicial complex automatically and efficiently, simplicial homology has become important for application to real-life situations, such as image analysis, medical imaging, and data analysis in general.

Another related theory is Cellular homology.

== Applications ==
A standard scenario in many computer applications is a collection of points (measurements, dark pixels in a bit map, etc.) in which one wishes to find a topological feature. Homology can serve as a qualitative tool to search for such a feature, since it is readily computable from combinatorial data such as a simplicial complex. However, the data points have to first be triangulated, meaning one replaces the data with a simplicial complex approximation. Computation of persistent homology involves analysis of homology at different resolutions, registering homology classes (holes) that persist as the resolution is changed. Such features can be used to detect structures of molecules, tumors in X-rays, and cluster structures in complex data.

More generally, simplicial homology plays a central role in topological data analysis, a technique in the field of data mining.

== Implementations ==
* Exact, efficient, computation of simplicial homology of large simplical complexes can be computed using the GAP Simplicial Homology. 
* A MATLAB toolbox for computing persistent homology, Plex (Vin de Silva, Gunnar Carlsson), is available at this site. 
* Stand-alone implementations in C++ are available as part of the Perseus, Dionysus and PHAT software projects.
* For Python, there are libraries such as scikit-tda, Persim, giotto-tda and GUDHI, the latter aimed at generating topological features for machine learning. These can be found at the PyPI repository.

<doc id="1060260" wikidata="Q1688860" url="?curid=1060260" title="Jiahu">
<text>Jiahu () was the site of a Neolithic settlement based in the central plain of ancient China, near the Yellow River. It is located between the floodplains of the Ni River to the north, and the Sha River to the south, north of modern Wuyang in Henan. Most archaeologists consider the site to be one of the earliest examples of the Peiligang culture. Settled , the site was later flooded and abandoned around 5700 BC. The settlement was surrounded by a moat and covered a relatively large area of . At one time, it was &quot;a complex, highly organized Chinese Neolithic society&quot;, with a population of between 250 and 800 people.

The important discoveries of the Jiahu archaeological site include the Jiahu symbols, possibly an early example of proto-writing, carved into tortoise shells and bones. The Jiahu flutes are believed to be among the oldest playable musical instruments in the world, comprising 33 pieces carved from the wing bones of cranes. There is also evidence of alcohol production through the fermentation of rice, honey, and hawthorn leaves.

Diverse artifacts are attested at the site, including residences, burial sites, pottery kilns, assorted stone and earthen implements, and a large central structure believed to be a communal workspace. These indicate a fairly advanced settlement for the early Neolithic period. To date, 45 residences have been excavated at Jiahu, with most measuring between four and ten meters. Most of these were partially dug into the earth and featured a single room, though some were later expanded to have multiple rooms. Garbage pits and storage cellars have also been excavated.

== Discovery and excavation ==
Discovered by Zhu Zhi in 1962, extensive excavation of the site did not occur until the 1980s. Most of the site still has not been excavated, although work is slowly progressing. The excavation of Jiahu burial sites and rubbish pits has been productive, yielding abundant evidence about the lives of the Jiahu people. Chinese researchers from the Henan Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, led for many years by Zhang Juzhong, a professor from the University of Science and Technology of China, have carried out archaeological research around the site for decades.

Zhang&#x27;s team conducted excavation of portions of the site in seven stages; each stage took two to three years. A large portion of the Jiahu site was excavated in the first two phases of the project, between 1983 and 1987. Zhang and his assistants published the findings of the first two phases in detail in the journal &quot;Antiquity&quot;.

== Relationship to Peiligang ==
Some archaeologists point to cultural distinctions between Jiahu and Peiligang, as well as the distance: Jiahu is isolated, many kilometers south of the larger Peiligang grouping of over 100 archaeological sites in a fairly compact area. The distance would have represented a journey on foot of several days in the Neolithic era. This school of thought suggests that Jiahu and Peiligang represented separate, neighboring cultures that interacted and shared many characteristics. Other early Neolithic settlements in this part of the world were much farther south and east.

Archaeologists have divided Jiahu into three distinct phases. The earliest phase spans from 7000 to 6600 BC, the middle phase spans from 6600 to 6200 BC; and the latest phase spans from 6200 to 5700 BC. The last two phases correspond to the Peiligang culture, while the earliest phase is unique to Jiahu.

Careful examination of the skeletons of over 400 individuals, removed from more than 300 graves, by several scientific teams over the course of the past 30 years illustrates that the Jiahu ethnic group was a part of the Northern Mongoloid group, and identified closely with the Miaodigou and Xiawanggang sub-groups which were also descendants of hunter-gatherers in modern Henan, and the Dawenkou, Xixiahou and Yedian sub-groups that were later found in Shandong Province.

==Agriculture, hunting, fishing and foraging==

The inhabitants of Jiahu cultivated foxtail millet and rice. While millet cultivation is common in the Peiligang culture, rice cultivation at Jiahu is unique, and tends to support the theory that Jiahu was a separate culture from the Peiligang grouping. On the other hand, difference in local climate, moisture and soil conditions may have made cultivating rice in the Peiligang area more difficult. Jiahu rice cultivation is one of the earliest found, and the most northerly found at such an early stage in history. The rice was a kind of short-grained &quot;japonica&quot; rice. Scholars had previously thought the earliest domesticated rice belonged to the long-grain &quot;indica&quot; subspecies.

There is abundant proof of millet farming in cool, dry high latitudes of the Yellow River Valley, and rice farming dominated in warm, moist low latitudes of the Yangtze River Valley. The early Neolithic site of Jiahu lies near the boundary between the cool, dry north and the warm, moist south. In another sign of advancement, Jiahu&#x27;s farmers had moved on from the usual slash-and-burn techniques of Neolithic farmers, and were using intensive cultivation in permanent fields. Jiahu is also the site of the earliest find of wild soybean seeds in China; a large quantity of soybean remains were discovered at Jiahu.

Food was plentiful, from farming as well as hunting and foraging, and contributed to considerable population growth for such an early settlement. Women of the Jiahu culture gathered wild pears and apricots, and foraged for acorns, chestnuts, broad beans, edible roots and tubers in the surrounding countryside. There is evidence of domesticated pigs, dogs, poultry, and small numbers of cattle. The Jiahu people used manure from their pigs and cattle as fertilizer, substantially increasing the yield of their rice crops. The livestock produced meat, milk and eggs. There was also evidence of deer, wild boar and rabbit hunting, and fishing in the nearby rivers to the north and south, with nets made of hemp fibers. The earliest evidence of Common carp aquaculture was also found at Jiahu. The red-crowned crane, a large bird indigenous to the region, was hunted for meat; its bones and feathers were also used for other purposes.

Due to this steadily improving and varied diet, the health and longevity of the Jiahu people gradually improved. This has been documented through comparison of the archaeological evidence. Over 400 burials have been unearthed at Jiahu, and many hundreds more are believed to await excavation. Skeletons have been measured and carefully examined, revealing the height, weight, gender, and approximate age of each of the deceased Jiahu at the time of death, as well as the general health, and in many cases the cause of death. The three phases of Jiahu history correspond to steadily increasing numbers of middle-aged and older people, suggesting an increase in survival and life expectancy, and fewer remains of children and infants, suggesting a reduction in child and infant mortality. By the third phase, the average height of an adult had increased by and the bones and teeth were in significantly better condition.

== Tools and fortifications ==
A stone sickle blade has been recovered. This was secured to a wooden handle to harvest grain. Evidence of baskets woven from wild grass has been uncovered. These were used to carry grain from the harvests. Remnants of a spinning loom have been found, indicating the production of cloth, probably from hemp fibers. Among the many tools and utensils unearthed at Jiahu are three-legged earthenware cooking pots with tight-fitting lids, and a variety of stone implements, including arrowheads, barbed harpoons, spades, axes, awls, and chisels.

Stone spearheads have also been found, and evidence of what may have been a wooden stockade fence along at least a portion of the interior shore of the moat. These improved weapons, and the moat surrounding the settlement, provided an ideal defense for such an early culture. The area is known to have been frequented by nomadic hunting and gathering tribes for several thousand years prior to the Jiahu settlement, and these may have been potential enemies, as well as the genetic forebears of Jiahu. The Jiahu people are not believed to have been warlike in nature, but capable of defending themselves if the need arose.

Examination of the site has revealed no evidence of armed conflict. Unearthed human remains showing signs of violent death are very rare, and scattered along the known timeline—rather than occurring at the same time which would indicate a battle. It is possible that the large size of the settlement, its substantial defenses, and the improved weapons of the Jiahu people may have caused potential enemies of that time to keep their distance. Such a scenario is consistent with the substantial growth in population and longevity exhibited by the Jiahu site. Without war, and with plenty of nutritious food, the village flourished.

== Cultural evidence ==
After a thorough study of 238 skeletal remains, Harvard University forensic archaeologist Barbara Li Smith published findings that the Jiahu villagers enjoyed fairly good health. The average age of death by the third phase was around 40, representing a very good life expectancy for Neolithic people. Sponge lesions on the skulls indicate that anemia and iron deficiency were a problem. Hole bone lesions from disease and parasitic infections were rare, although fecal evidence indicated the occasional presence of hookworm parasites, possibly from poorly cooked pork.

=== Ceremonial burial ===
The burials at Jiahu were usually accompanied by burial offerings, with increasing frequency as the second and third phases progressed. Burial objects range from pottery to tortoise shells. Burial offerings varied between individuals, and are believed to be linked to the skills they displayed in life, providing evidence of an early specialization of labor. The types of labor specialization, from most common to most rare, included farmers, herdsmen, fishermen, hunters, potters, musicians, and a tribal priest.

Most of the burials were earthen pits; infants were buried in earthenware jars. As is common with Neolithic communities, the burials were in cemeteries which were separate from the residential areas, although many grave sites overlapped, so they were probably not marked. A few burials were multiple, while most burial pits contained single individuals. These did not follow any discernible pattern, although it is possible that in some cases, man–woman couples of roughly the same age were buried together.

In some graves the heads were severed from the body and pointed toward the northwest. Cut marks made when the bones were fresh indicates the heads were cut off shortly after the person died. A few burial offerings included turquoise carvings, and represented a significant level of material wealth, suggesting some differences in social status. Burial offerings in women&#x27;s graves were more sparse, indicating lower social status, and indicated that their roles were limited to childbearing and child care, cooking, and foraging for food.

=== Flutes ===
Some of the most significant burial offerings discovered were playable tonal flutes made from red-crowned crane wing bones. This crane is tall with a wingspan of , yielding large bones for this purpose. The first of the flutes were found in the late 1980s, but were not described in the West until 1999. In total, 33 flutes have been found at Jiahu—around 20 are intact, with the rest being broken, fragmentary, and unfinished. All are between in length.

The oldest phase at Jiahu only contains two flutes, which are tetratonic and pentatonic; the middle phase at Jiahu contains several flutes, including an interesting pair of hexatonic flutes. One of the flutes was broken, and the other flute seems to be a replica of the first flute, as it shows evidence of adjustments made to match the pitch of the first. Innovations in the last phase include the use of heptatonic flutes. The flutes were cut, smoothed at the ends, polished and finally drilled with a row of holes on one side. One of the broken flutes was repaired by drilling fourteen tiny holes along the breakage lines and then tying the sections together with hemp string.

The flutes play in the so-called pentatonic scale, in which octaves are divided into five notes—the basis of many kinds of music, including Chinese folk music. The fact that the flute has a scale indicates that its original players played music rather than just single notes. The flutes were probably used in some kind of ceremonial capacity, but may have been played for entertainment.

=== Pottery and alcohol production ===
Jiahu yielded some of the oldest Chinese pottery yet found in Neolithic China. Patrick McGovern, of the University of Pennsylvania Museum, led a team of scientists who applied biomarker chemical analysis to pottery jars from Jiahu. They found signature molecules proving alcohol was fermented from rice, honey, grapes, and hawthorn. Researchers hypothesize that this hybrid beverage (a beer, wine, and mead combination) was fermented by the process of mold saccharification, a uniquely Chinese contribution to the art of beverage-making in which several mold species are used to break down the carbohydrates of rice and other grains into simple, fermentable sugars. Specific aromatic herbs and flowers such as chrysanthemum, in addition to tree resins such as China fir, had been added to the hybrid beverages, the researchers found. These aromatic additions, as well as the honey, indicate that fermented beverages with a pleasing aroma and sweet taste were important to the Jiahu people.

Substantial quantities of rice and millet were stored in pottery jars, enabling the specialization of labor. Jiahu society is believed to have been fairly egalitarian, with several hundred residents of the village at the height of its development. Comparative DNA evidence from remains in the Jiahu settlement itself, as well as other evidence gathered, leads to speculation among researchers that there were one or more other ancient villages nearby, with peaceful interaction with the Jiahu in some form; but the sites of other villages nearby have not been located.

=== Inscriptions ===
Eleven pictographic symbols were discovered at the site, with nine carved into tortoise shells, and two carved into bone. These have been taken by some as possible evidence for the use of proto-writing. Correspondences between the Jiahu symbols and the characters attested much later in the oracle bone script of the Late Shang () have been noted; however, such correspondences are generally not considered strong evidence of a relationship due to the strongly representational style of each.

== End of habitation ==
Based on the archaeological evidence, a severe flood from the nearby rivers submerged most or all of the Jiahu settlement under a few feet of water sometime around 5700 BC. The inhabitants evacuated, but it is not known where they went. The absence of tools and weapons in most of the residences indicates that they were able to salvage most of their belongings. They may have built a new village that has not been discovered, emigrated to the Peiligang villages, or scattered.

Zhang Juzhong imagines that they were led by their tribal priest to build a new village nearby on higher ground, so that they could send salvage parties to the old village site. The new village site has never been found. The demolishing of older structures to salvage materials for the construction of new ones may have eradicated the site of the new village if it existed.

<text>Sir David Valentine Willcocks, (30 December 1919 – 17 September 2015) was a British choral conductor, organist, composer and music administrator. He was particularly well known for his association with the Choir of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, which he directed from 1957 to 1974, making frequent broadcasts and recordings. Several of the descants and carol arrangements he wrote for the annual service of Nine Lessons and Carols were published in the series of books &quot;Carols for Choirs&quot; which he edited along with Reginald Jacques and John Rutter. He was also director of the Royal College of Music in London.

During the Second World War (1939–1945) he served as an officer in the British Army, and was decorated with the Military Cross for his actions on Hill 112 during the Battle of Normandy in July 1944. His elder son, Jonathan Willcocks, is also a composer.

== Biography ==
Born in Newquay in Cornwall, Willcocks began his musical training as a chorister at Westminster Abbey from 1929 to 1934, following a recommendation by the then Master of the King&#x27;s Music, Sir Henry Walford Davies, to Ernest Bullock. From 1934 to 1938, he was a music scholar at Clifton College, Bristol, where his teacher was Douglas Fox, his most important musical influence. He was appointed as organ scholar at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1939. There, he met David Briggs, a choral scholar (bass). Willcocks and Briggs would later be colleagues at King&#x27;s, from 1959 to 1974, as Organist and Master of the Choristers and as Headmaster of King&#x27;s College School, the school attended by the choirboys of King&#x27;s College.

===Military service===
With the outbreak of the Second World War, he interrupted his studies in music to serve in the British Army. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry (DCLI) on 15 February 1941, and was awarded the Military Cross as a temporary captain for his actions during the Battle of Normandy on the night of 10/11 July 1944, when he was serving with the 5th Battalion, DCLI as battalion intelligence officer. The battalion, part of the 214th Infantry Brigade of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, was ordered to hold Hill 112 in Normandy, France, as part of Operation Epsom. He carried out his duties outstandingly overnight, helping inflict severe casualties on the German forces by calling in artillery support to break up counter-attacks. The battalion suffered over 250 casualties during the night, including the commanding officer and one of the company commanders. This left Willcocks in command of the battalion headquarters, which by then was the furthest forward part of the battalion. He rallied the men, enabling the battalion to stand firm and reorganise. The award was gazetted on 21 December 1944.

===Musical career===
Willcocks returned to Cambridge in 1945 to complete his studies, and in 1947 was elected a Fellow of King&#x27;s College and appointed Conductor of the Cambridge Philharmonic Society. In the same year, he became the organist at Salisbury Cathedral and the conductor of the Salisbury Musical Society. He moved to Worcester Cathedral in 1950 and remained until 1957, during which time he was organist of the cathedral, principal conductor of the Three Choirs Festival in 1951, 1954, and 1957, and conductor of the City of Birmingham Choir. From 1956 to 1974 he was also conductor of the Bradford Festival Choral Society, whilst continuing as guest conductor for their carol concerts into the early 1990s. Composers with whom he collaborated included Vaughan Williams, Britten, Howells and Tippett.

From 1957 to 1974 he held the post for which he is probably best known, Director of Music at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He made numerous recordings with the college choir. (Among the most notable recordings was one of Thomas Tallis&#x27;s &quot;Spem in alium&quot;, made in 1965.) The choir toured extensively, giving concerts worldwide, as well as garnering further acclaim internationally through television and radio appearances. Under the baton of Willcocks, Cambridge University Musical Society performed Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot; in 1963 in (Perugia) Milan, La Scala, and in Venice. The choir subsequently performed the work in Japan, Hong Kong, Portugal, and the Netherlands. In 1960, he also became the musical director of the Bach Choir in London.

He held these positions at Cambridge until the 1970s when he accepted the post of Director of the Royal College of Music. In the 1971 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), and was created a Knight Bachelor in 1977 in the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee Honours. He held honorary degrees in England from the Universities of Bradford, Bristol, Exeter, Leicester, and Sussex, and from the Royal College of Music in London; in the US from Luther College (Iowa), St. Olaf College (Minnesota), Rowan University and Westminster Choir College (New Jersey); and in Canada from the Universities of Trinity College, Toronto, and Victoria B.C. All in all, his honorary degrees numbered over fifty. He was also President of the City of Bath Bach Choir and Exeter Festival Chorus. For the 1981 wedding of Prince Charles and Diana Spencer, Willcocks served as guest director of music and conducted the Bach Choir, who sang during the signing of the registers. The event was watched by an estimated global TV audience of 750 million.

After stepping down from the Royal College, Willcocks resumed conducting and editing scores as his primary activities. A 1990 profile in &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that he had made nine visits to the United States in the previous year, including conducting Evensong at St. Thomas Church in Manhattan and conducting the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. In live performance, he regularly conducted Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; at the &quot;Mostly Mozart&quot; festival in New York.

On 15 May 2010, a celebration of his contribution to music took place at the Royal Albert Hall in London, where pieces selected by Willcocks were performed by singers who are part of the Really Big Chorus. Special guests included choristers from King&#x27;s College Choir, Cambridge, who performed three pieces.

He died at home in Cambridge on the morning of 17 September 2015.

== Recordings and broadcasts ==

Willcocks made recordings with the (London) Bach Choir, the English Chamber Orchestra, the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, the Jacques Orchestra, the Philharmonia Orchestra, and the London Symphony Orchestra as well as with the Choir of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, with whom he regularly conducted the Nine Lessons and Carols service on Christmas Eve, broadcast by the BBC every year since 1931. With The Bach Choir, in particular he recorded works by Johann Sebastian Bach, especially his motets and, sung in English, his St John Passion and a stately rendition of the St Matthew Passion, a piece he regularly conducted for broadcast Easter performances. He also served as general editor of the Church Music series of the Oxford University Press. During his years at King&#x27;s, an early and frequently reissued recording of the Allegri &quot;Miserere&quot; was made in March 1963 by the choir, conducted by David Willcocks, and featuring a 12-year old Roy Goodman, later a distinguished conductor, as the treble soloist. In 1965, he made his famous recording, with the Choir of King&#x27;s College, of Tallis&#x27;s Spem in alium.

He is particularly known for his widely used choral arrangements of Christmas carols, many of which were originally written or arranged for the Service of Nine Lessons and Carols at King&#x27;s and/or the Bach Choir&#x27;s Christmas concerts. They are published in the five &quot;Carols for Choirs&quot; anthologies (1961–1987), edited by Willcocks with Reginald Jacques (first volume) or John Rutter. The descant arrangements in particular are among the most famous and well-loved musical components. He was Music Director Emeritus of King&#x27;s College Choir, and an Honorary Fellow of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

Outside the world of classical music, Willcocks conducted his London Bach Choir for the studio recording of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot; by the Rolling Stones in 1968.

A notable broadcast took place on BBC Radio 4 on 21 September 2010 in a series called &quot;Soul Music&quot;, when Willcocks profiled Fauré&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;. The programme included his memories of the fighting at Hill 112. The profile also featured Christina, widow of Olaf Schmid. Willcocks questioned the morality of war.

<doc id="1060278" wikidata="Q1476787" url="?curid=1060278" title="Handsome Boy Modeling School">
<text>Handsome Boy Modeling School is an American collaborative project between hip hop producers Dan the Automator (Gorillaz, Dr. Octagon, Deltron 3030) and Prince Paul (Stetsasonic, De La Soul, Gravediggaz). The collaboration originally lasted from 1999 to 2006 and resulted in two albums, featuring a vast cast of guest rappers, singers, comedians and DJs. In February 2018, the duo played a concert in New York City.

==History==
Handsome Boy Modeling School was a conceptual hip hop duo that parodied and acted as a commentary on vain, consumerist, materialistic, and self-absorbed members of upper class society, such as supermodels and people from old money. The pair often satirized upper class snobbery and perceived beauty.

In 1999, they released the concept album &quot;So... How&#x27;s Your Girl?&quot;, which was loosely based on &quot;The Prettiest Week of My Life&quot;, an episode of the sitcom &quot;Get a Life&quot; which starred Chris Elliott. The episode also contains the origin of the name Handsome Boy Modeling School, where Chris Elliott&#x27;s character enrolls to become a male model. In the album, Dan and Paul assume the characters of Nathaniel Merriweather and Chest Rockwell, respectively. The Rockwell name is in reference to a pseudonym used by a porn star in 1997 film &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;; the Merriweather name is likely an homage to the character Nathaniel Mayweather, also played by Chris Elliott, in the 1994 comedic feature &quot;Cabin Boy&quot;. Dan the Automator continued to use the pseudonym Nathaniel Merriweather alongside Mike Patton and Jennifer Charles for the collaborative project Lovage.

A number of guest musicians appear, including Róisín Murphy (one half of the duo Moloko at the time of the album&#x27;s release), DJ Shadow, Del the Funky Homosapien, J-Live, Sean Lennon, Miho Hatori (of Cibo Matto), Mike D (of the Beastie Boys) and Don Novello (as comic character Father Guido Sarducci).

Their 1999 single &quot;The Projects&quot; in collaboration with Dave of De La Soul and Del the Funky Homosapien was featured in the 2001 film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot;.

Their second album, &quot;White People&quot;, was released in November 2004. Some collaborators from the first album returned, and new collaborators included RZA, Cat Power, Casual, Alex Kapranos of Franz Ferdinand, Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park, Jack Johnson, Cedric Bixler-Zavala of The Mars Volta, Mike Patton, El-P, Pharrell, John Oates, Chino Moreno, Lord Finesse, Black Sheep, and comedy actor Tim Meadows.

In 2006, Prince Paul announced his retirement from Handsome Boy Modeling School due to business conflicts with Dan the Automator. However, the duo reunited to play a concert hosted by Saks Fifth Avenue, New York City, on 14 February 2018. According to HipHopDX, they announced plans to release a new album at the performance. On 9 April 2022, at a show in Portland, Oregon, Dan the Automator officially announced that a third album was in the works, predicting a fall 2022 release. In March 2023, they released &quot;Music To Drink Martinis To&quot; in partnership with Ford’s Gin.

<doc id="1060279" wikidata="Q1759895" url="?curid=1060279" title="Coping">
<text>Coping refers to conscious or unconscious strategies used to reduce and manage unpleasant emotions. Coping strategies can be cognitions or behaviors and can be individual or social. To cope is to deal with struggles and difficulties in life. It is a way for people to maintain their mental and emotional well-being. Everybody has ways of handling difficult events that occur in life, and that is what it means to cope. Coping can be healthy and productive, or unhealthy and destructive. It is recommended that an individual cope in ways that will be beneficial and healthy. &quot;Managing your stress well can help you feel better physically and psychologically and it can impact your ability to perform your best.&quot;

==Theories of coping==
Hundreds of coping strategies have been proposed in an attempt to understand how people cope. Classification of these strategies into a broader architecture has not been agreed upon. Researchers try to group coping responses rationally, empirically by factor analysis, or through a blend of both techniques. In the early days, Folkman and Lazarus split the coping strategies into four groups, namely problem-focused, emotion-focused, support-seeking, and meaning-making coping. Weiten and Lloyd have identified four types of coping strategies: appraisal-focused (adaptive cognitive), problem-focused (adaptive behavioral), emotion-focused, and occupation-focused coping. Billings and Moos added avoidance coping as one of the emotion-focused coping. Some scholars have questioned the psychometric validity of forced categorization as those strategies are not independent to each other. Besides, in reality, people can adopt multiple coping strategies simultaneously.

Typically, people use a mixture of several functions of coping strategies, which may change over time. All these strategies can prove useful, but some claim that those using problem-focused coping strategies will adjust better to life. Problem-focused coping mechanisms may allow an individual greater perceived control over their problem, whereas emotion-focused coping may sometimes lead to a reduction in perceived control (maladaptive coping).

Lazarus &quot;notes the connection between his idea of &#x27;defensive reappraisals&#x27; or cognitive coping and Sigmund Freud&#x27;s concept of &#x27;ego-defenses, coping strategies thus overlapping with a person&#x27;s defense mechanisms.

===Appraisal-focused coping strategies===
Appraisal-focused (adaptive cognitive) strategies occur when the person modifies the way they think, for example: employing denial, or distancing oneself from the problem. Individuals who use appraisal coping strategies purposely alter their perspective on their situation in order to have a more positive outlook on their situation. An example of appraisal coping strategies could be individuals purchasing tickets to a football game, knowing their medical condition would likely cause them to not be able to attend. People may alter the way they think about a problem by altering their goals and values, such as by seeing the humor in a situation: &quot;Some have suggested that humor may play a greater role as a stress moderator among women than men&quot;.

===Adaptive behavioral coping strategies===
The psychological coping mechanisms are commonly termed &quot;coping strategies&quot; or &quot;coping skills&quot;. The term &quot;coping&quot; generally refers to adaptive (constructive) coping strategies, that is, strategies which reduce stress. In contrast, other coping strategies may be coined as maladaptive, if they increase stress. Maladaptive coping is therefore also described, based on its outcome, as non-coping. Furthermore, the term coping generally refers to &quot;reactive coping&quot;, i.e. the coping response which follows the stressor. This differs from &quot;proactive coping&quot;, in which a coping response aims to neutralize a future stressor. Subconscious or unconscious strategies (e.g. defense mechanisms) are generally excluded from the area of coping.

The effectiveness of the coping effort depends on the type of stress, the individual, and the circumstances. Coping responses are partly controlled by personality (habitual traits), but also partly by the social environment, particularly the nature of the stressful environment. People using problem-focused strategies try to deal with the cause of their problem. They do this by finding out information on the problem and learning new skills to manage the problem. Problem-focused coping is aimed at changing or eliminating the source of the stress. The three problem-focused coping strategies identified by Folkman and Lazarus are: taking control, information seeking, and evaluating the pros and cons. However, problem-focused coping may not be necessarily adaptive, but backfire, especially in the uncontrollable case that one cannot make the problem go away.

===Emotion-focused coping strategies===
Emotion-focused strategies involve:
* releasing pent-up emotions
* distracting oneself
* managing hostile feelings
* meditating
* mindfulness practices
* using systematic relaxation procedures.
* situational exposure
Emotion-focused coping &quot;is oriented toward managing the emotions that accompany the perception of stress&quot;. The five emotion-focused coping strategies identified by Folkman and Lazarus are:
* disclaiming
* escape-avoidance
* accepting responsibility or blame
* exercising self-control
* and positive reappraisal.
Emotion-focused coping is a mechanism to alleviate distress by minimizing, reducing, or preventing, the emotional components of a stressor. This mechanism can be applied through a variety of ways, such as:
* seeking social support
* reappraising the stressor in a positive light
* accepting responsibility
* using avoidance
* exercising self-control
* distancing 
The focus of this coping mechanism is to change the meaning of the stressor or transfer attention away from it. For example, reappraising tries to find a more positive meaning of the cause of the stress in order to reduce the emotional component of the stressor. Avoidance of the emotional distress will distract from the negative feelings associated with the stressor. Emotion-focused coping is well suited for stressors that seem uncontrollable (ex. a terminal illness diagnosis, or the loss of a loved one). Some mechanisms of emotion focused coping, such as distancing or avoidance, can have alleviating outcomes for a short period of time, however they can be detrimental when used over an extended period. Positive emotion-focused mechanisms, such as seeking social support, and positive re-appraisal, are associated with beneficial outcomes. Emotional approach coping is one form of emotion-focused coping in which emotional expression and processing is used to adaptively manage a response to a stressor. Other examples include relaxation training through deep breathing, meditation, yoga, music and art therapy, and aromatherapy.

===Health theory of coping===
The health theory of coping overcame the limitations of previous theories of coping, describing coping strategies within categories that are conceptually clear, mutually exclusive, comprehensive, functionally homogenous, functionally distinct, generative and flexible, explains the continuum of coping strategies. The usefulness of all coping strategies to reduce acute distress is acknowledged, however, strategies are categorized as healthy or unhealthy depending on their likelihood of additional adverse consequences. Healthy categories are self-soothing, relaxation/distraction, social support and professional support. Unhealthy coping categories are negative self-talk, harmful activities (e.g., emotional eating, verbal or physical aggression, drugs such as alcohol, self-harm), social withdrawal, and suicidality. Unhealthy coping strategies are used when healthy coping strategies are overwhelmed, not in the absence of healthy coping strategies.

Research has shown that everyone has personal healthy coping strategies (self-soothing, relaxation/distraction), however, access to social and professional support varies. Increasing distress and inadequate support results in the additional use of unhealthy coping strategies. Overwhelming distress exceeds the capacity of healthy coping strategies and results in the use of unhealthy coping strategies. Overwhelming distress is caused by problems in one or more biopsychosocial domains of health and wellbeing. The continuum of coping strategies (healthy to unhealthy, independent to social, and low harm to high harm) have been explored in general populations, university students, and paramedics. New evidence propose a more comprehensive view of a continuum iterative transformative process of developing coping competence among palliative care professionals

=== Reactive and proactive coping===
Most coping is reactive in that the coping response follows stressors. Anticipating and reacting to a future stressor is known as &quot;proactive coping&quot; or future-oriented coping. Anticipation is when one reduces the stress of some difficult challenge by anticipating what it will be like and preparing for how one is going to cope with it.

=== Social coping ===
&quot;Social coping&quot; recognises that individuals are bedded within a social environment, which can be stressful, but also is the source of coping resources, such as seeking social support from others. (see help-seeking)

=== Humor ===
Humor used as a positive coping method may have useful benefits to emotional and mental health well-being. However, maladaptive humor styles such as self-defeating humor can also have negative effects on psychological adjustment and might exacerbate negative effects of other stressors. By having a humorous outlook on life, stressful experiences can be and are often minimized. This coping method corresponds with positive emotional states and is known to be an indicator of mental health. Physiological processes are also influenced within the exercise of humor. For example, laughing may reduce muscle tension, increase the flow of oxygen to the blood, exercise the cardiovascular region, and produce endorphins in the body. 

Using humor in coping while processing feelings can vary depending on life circumstance and individual humor styles. In regards to grief and loss in life occurrences, it has been found that genuine laughs/smiles when speaking about the loss predicted later adjustment and evoked more positive responses from other people. A person might also find comedic relief with others around irrational possible outcomes for the deceased funeral service. It is also possible that humor would be used by people to feel a sense of control over a more powerless situation and used as way to temporarily escape a feeling of helplessness. Exercised humor can be a sign of positive adjustment as well as drawing support and interaction from others around the loss.

===Negative techniques (maladaptive coping or non-coping)===

Whereas adaptive coping strategies improve functioning, a maladaptive coping technique (also termed non-coping) will just reduce symptoms while maintaining or strengthening the stressor. Maladaptive techniques are only effective as a short-term rather than long-term coping process.

Examples of maladaptive behavior strategies include anxious avoidance, dissociation, escape (including self-medication), use of maladaptive humor styles such as self-defeating humor, procrastination, rationalization, safety behaviors, and sensitization. These coping strategies interfere with the person&#x27;s ability to unlearn, or break apart, the paired association between the situation and the associated anxiety symptoms. These are maladaptive strategies as they serve to maintain the disorder.

* Anxious avoidance is when a person avoids anxiety provoking situations by all means. This is the most common method.
* Dissociation is the ability of the mind to separate and compartmentalize thoughts, memories, and emotions. This is often associated with post traumatic stress syndrome.
* Escape is closely related to avoidance. This technique is often demonstrated by people who experience panic attacks or have phobias. These people want to flee the situation at the first sign of anxiety.
* The use of self-defeating humor means that a person disparages themselves in order to entertain others. This type of humor has been shown to lead to negative psychological adjustment and exacerbate the effect of existing stressors.
* Procrastination is when a person willingly delays a task in order to receive a temporary relief from stress. While this may work for short-term relief, when used as a coping mechanism, procrastination causes more issues in the long run.
* Rationalization is the practice of attempting to use reasoning to minimize the severity of an incident, or avoid approaching it in ways that could cause psychological trauma or stress. It most commonly manifests in the form of making excuses for the behavior of the person engaging in the rationalization, or others involved in the situation the person is attempting to rationalize.
* Sensitization is when a person seeks to learn about, rehearse, and/or anticipate fearful events in a protective effort to prevent these events from occurring in the first place.
* Safety behaviors are demonstrated when individuals with anxiety disorders come to rely on something, or someone, as a means of coping with their excessive anxiety.
* Overthinking
* Emotion suppression
* Emotion-driven behavior

===Further examples===
Further examples of coping strategies include emotional or instrumental support, self-distraction, denial, substance use, self-blame, behavioral disengagement and the use of drugs or alcohol.

Many people think that meditation &quot;not only calms our emotions, but...makes us feel more &#x27;together, as too can &quot;the kind of prayer in which you&#x27;re trying to achieve an inner quietness and peace&quot;.

Low-effort syndrome or low-effort coping refers to the coping responses of a person refusing to work hard. For example, a student at school may learn to put in only minimal effort as they believe if they put in effort it could unveil their flaws.

==Historical psychoanalytic theories==

===Otto Fenichel===

Otto Fenichel summarized early psychoanalytic studies of coping mechanisms in children as &quot;a gradual substitution of actions for mere discharge reactions...[&amp;] the development of the function of judgement&quot; – noting however that &quot;behind all active types of mastery of external and internal tasks, a readiness remains to fall back on passive-receptive types of mastery.&quot;

In adult cases of &quot;acute and more or less &#x27;traumatic&#x27; upsetting events in the life of normal persons&quot;, Fenichel stressed that in coping, &quot;in carrying out a &#x27;work of learning&#x27; or &#x27;work of adjustment&#x27;, [s]he must acknowledge the new and less comfortable reality and fight tendencies towards regression, towards the misinterpretation of reality&quot;, though such rational strategies &quot;may be mixed with relative allowances for rest and for small regressions and compensatory wish fulfillment, which are recuperative in effect&quot;.

===Karen Horney===

In the 1940s, the German Freudian psychoanalyst Karen Horney &quot;developed her mature theory in which individuals cope with the anxiety produced by feeling unsafe, unloved, and undervalued by disowning their spontaneous feelings and developing elaborate strategies of defence.&quot; Horney defined four so-called coping strategies to define interpersonal relations, one describing psychologically healthy individuals, the others describing neurotic states.

The healthy strategy she termed &quot;Moving with&quot; is that with which psychologically healthy people develop relationships. It involves compromise. In order to move with, there must be communication, agreement, disagreement, compromise, and decisions. The three other strategies she described – &quot;Moving toward&quot;, &quot;Moving against&quot; and &quot;Moving away&quot; – represented neurotic, unhealthy strategies people utilize in order to protect themselves.

Horney investigated these patterns of neurotic needs (compulsive attachments). The neurotics might feel these attachments more strongly because of difficulties within their lives. If the neurotic does not experience these needs, they will experience anxiety. The ten needs are:

# Affection and approval, the need to please others and be liked.
# A partner who will take over one&#x27;s life, based on the idea that love will solve all of one&#x27;s problems.
# Restriction of one&#x27;s life to narrow borders, to be undemanding, satisfied with little, inconspicuous; to simplify one&#x27;s life.
# Power, for control over others, for a facade of omnipotence, caused by a desperate desire for strength and dominance.
# Exploitation of others; to get the better of them.
# Social recognition or prestige, caused by an abnormal concern for appearances and popularity.
# Personal admiration.
# Personal achievement.
# Self-sufficiency and independence.
# Perfection and unassailability, a desire to be perfect and a fear of being flawed.

In Compliance, also known as &quot;Moving toward&quot; or the &quot;Self-effacing solution&quot;, the individual moves towards those perceived as a threat to avoid retribution and getting hurt, &quot;making any sacrifice, no matter how detrimental.&quot; The argument is, &quot;If I give in, I won&#x27;t get hurt.&quot; This means that: if I give everyone I see as a potential threat whatever they want, I will not be injured (physically or emotionally). This strategy includes neurotic needs one, two, and three.

In Withdrawal, also known as &quot;Moving away&quot; or the &quot;Resigning solution&quot;, individuals distance themselves from anyone perceived as a threat to avoid getting hurt – &quot;the &#x27;mouse-hole&#x27; attitude ... the security of unobtrusiveness.&quot; The argument is, &quot;If I do not let anyone close to me, I won&#x27;t get hurt.&quot; A neurotic, according to Horney desires to be distant because of being abused. If they can be the extreme introvert, no one will ever develop a relationship with them. If there is no one around, nobody can hurt them. These &quot;moving away&quot; people fight personality, so they often come across as cold or shallow. This is their strategy. They emotionally remove themselves from society. Included in this strategy are neurotic needs three, nine, and ten.

In Aggression, also known as the &quot;Moving against&quot; or the &quot;Expansive solution&quot;, the individual threatens those perceived as a threat to avoid getting hurt. Children might react to parental in-differences by displaying anger or hostility. This strategy includes neurotic needs four, five, six, seven, and eight.

Related to the work of Karen Horney, public administration scholars developed a classification of coping by frontline workers when working with clients (see also the work of Michael Lipsky on street-level bureaucracy). This coping classification is focused on the behavior workers can display towards clients when confronted with stress. They show that during public service delivery there are three main families of coping:

* Moving &quot;towards&quot; clients: Coping by helping clients in stressful situations. An example is a teacher working overtime to help students.
* Moving &quot;away from&quot; clients: Coping by avoiding meaningful interactions with clients in stressful situations. An example is a public servant stating &quot;the office is very busy today, please return tomorrow.&quot; 
* Moving &quot;against&quot; clients: Coping by confronting clients. For instance, teachers can cope with stress when working with students by imposing very rigid rules, such as no cellphone use in class and sending everyone to the office when they use a cellphone. Furthermore, aggression towards clients is also included here.

In their systematic review of 35 years of the literature, the scholars found that the most often used family is moving &quot;towards&quot; clients (43% of all coping fragments). Moving &quot;away from&quot; clients was found in 38% of all coping fragments and Moving &quot;against&quot; clients in 19%.

===Heinz Hartmann===
In 1937, the psychoanalyst (as well as a physician, psychologist, and psychiatrist) Heinz Hartmann marked it as the evolution of ego psychology by publishing his paper, &quot;Me&quot; (which was later translated into English in 1958, titled, &quot;The Ego and the Problem of Adaptation&quot;). Hartmann focused on the adaptive progression of the ego &quot;through the mastery of new demands and tasks&quot;. In fact, according to his &quot;adaptive point of view&quot;, once infants were born they have the ability to be able to cope with the demands of their surroundings. In his wake, ego psychology further stressed &quot;the development of the personality and of &#x27;ego-strengths&#x27;...adaptation to social realities&quot;.

===Object relations===
Emotional intelligence has stressed the importance of &quot;the capacity to soothe oneself, to shake off rampant anxiety, gloom, or irritability...People who are poor in this ability are constantly battling feelings of distress, while those who excel in it can bounce back far more quickly from life&#x27;s setbacks and upsets&quot;. From this perspective, &quot;the art of soothing ourselves is a fundamental life skill; some psychoanalytic thinkers, such as John Bowlby and D. W. Winnicott see this as the most essential of all psychic tools.&quot;

Object relations theory has examined the childhood development both of &quot;independent coping...capacity for self-soothing&quot;, and of &quot;aided coping. Emotion-focused coping in infancy is often accomplished through the assistance of an adult.&quot;

==Gender differences==
Gender differences in coping strategies are the ways in which men and women differ in managing psychological stress. There is evidence that males often develop stress due to their careers, whereas females often encounter stress due to issues in interpersonal relationships. Early studies indicated that &quot;there were gender differences in the sources of stressors, but gender differences in coping were relatively small after controlling for the source of stressors&quot;; and more recent work has similarly revealed &quot;small differences between women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s coping strategies when studying individuals in similar situations.&quot;

In general, such differences as exist indicate that women tend to employ emotion-focused coping and the &quot;tend-and-befriend&quot; response to stress, whereas men tend to use problem-focused coping and the &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; response, perhaps because societal standards encourage men to be more individualistic, while women are often expected to be interpersonal. An alternative explanation for the aforementioned differences involves genetic factors. The degree to which genetic factors and social conditioning influence behavior, is the subject of ongoing debate.

==Physiological basis==
Hormones also play a part in stress management. Cortisol, a stress hormone, was found to be elevated in males during stressful situations. In females, however, cortisol levels were decreased in stressful situations, and instead, an increase in limbic activity was discovered. Many researchers believe that these results underlie the reasons why men administer a fight-or-flight reaction to stress; whereas, females have a tend-and-befriend reaction. The &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; response activates the sympathetic nervous system in the form of increased focus levels, adrenaline, and epinephrine. Conversely, the &quot;tend-and-befriend&quot; reaction refers to the tendency of women to protect their offspring and relatives. Although these two reactions support a genetic basis to differences in behavior, one should not assume that in general females cannot implement &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; behavior or that males cannot implement &quot;tend-and-befriend&quot; behavior. Additionally, this study implied differing health impacts for each gender as a result of the contrasting stress-processes.

<text>The Monkey-man of Delhi, also known as the Face Scratcher or the Black Monkey, is an unknown anomaly which was reported to be roaming Delhi in mid-2001. The entire incident has been described as an example of mass hysteria in India.

== History ==
In May 2001, reports circulated in New Delhi, India concerning a monkey-like creature that attacked people at night. Eyewitness accounts were often inconsistent, but usually described the creature as about four feet (120 cm) tall, covered in thick black hair, with a metal helmet, metal claws, glowing red eyes and three buttons on its chest. Some reports also claim that it wore roller-skates. Others, however, described the Monkey-man as having a more vulpine snout, and being up to eight feet tall, and muscular; it would leap from building to building.

Over 350 sightings of the Monkey-man were reported, as well as around 60 resulting in injuries. Police released artist&#x27;s sketches of eyewitness accounts in an attempt to catch the creature. Two (by some reports, three) people reportedly died when they fell from the tops of buildings or down stairwells in a panic caused when they thought they were under attack.

== In popular culture ==
=== Film ===
The appearance of Monkey-man in Old Delhi is the centre-point of the 2009 Hindi film &quot;Delhi-6&quot; directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. In the film, the creature is used as an allegory to represent the evil that resides inside every man alongside God (virtue).

=== Television ===
In 2012, the Hindi TV series &quot;Mrs. Kaushik Ki Paanch Bahuein&quot; featured a story track around the mystery of &quot;Kala Bandar&quot; (Black Monkey).

=== Music ===
The Monkey-man is referenced in &quot;Mysterious Man-Monkey&quot;, the 12th track in American cello rock band Rasputina&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;Great American Gingerbread: Rasputina Rarities &amp; Neglected Items.&quot; 

=== Print media ===
In the 2011 graphic novel &quot;Munkeeman&quot; by &quot;Tere Bin Laden&quot; director Abhishek Sharma, the creature is interpreted as a misunderstood superhero, who was the result of a science experiment gone wrong. The first edition, &quot;Munkeeman Vol 1&quot; chronicled the creatures brief appearance in Delhi, and the second edition will feature the creature in Kanpur, based on the incidents reported in February 2002.

<text>Coping (from &quot;cope&quot;, Latin &quot;capa&quot;) is the capping or covering of a wall. A splayed or wedge coping is one that slopes in a single direction; a saddle coping slopes to either side of a central high point.

Coping may be made of stone (capstone), brick, clay or terracotta, concrete or cast stone, tile, slate, wood, thatch, or various metals, including aluminum, copper, stainless steel, steel, and zinc. In all cases it should be weathered (have a slanted or curved top surface) to throw off the water.

In Romanesque work, copings appeared plain and flat, and projected over the wall with a throating to form a drip. In later work a steep slope was given to the weathering (mainly on the outer side), and began at the top with an astragal; in the Decorated Gothic style there were two or three sets off; and in the later Perpendicular Gothic these assumed a wavy section, and the coping mouldings continued round the sides, as well as at top and bottom, mitring at the angles, as in many of the colleges at the University of Oxford.

<text>Superman Adventures is a DC Comics comic book series featuring Superman. It is set in the continuity (and style) of &quot;&quot;. It ran for 66 issues between 1996 and 2002. Writers on the series included Paul Dini, Mark Evanier, Devin Grayson, Scott McCloud, Mark Millar, and Ty Templeton. It is a sister title to &quot;The Batman Adventures&quot; (based on &quot;&quot;) and &quot;Justice League Adventures&quot; (based on &quot;Justice League&quot;).

==Exclusive characters==
While the comic relied mostly on the cast from the animated series, there were a few characters who only appeared in the comic, such as General Zod, Brad Wilson (from &quot;Superman III&quot;), Bizarro Lois Lane, Krypto, and Sandman (from &quot;The Sandman Saga&quot;).

===&quot;World&#x27;s Finest&quot;===
&quot;Batman and Superman Adventures: World&#x27;s Finest&quot; (December 1997) is an adaptation of the 3-part episode of the same name. The adaptation is mostly faithful to the animated version. An additional scene shows Batman discussing with Alfred his problem with Superman (his tendency to rush in without thinking). The story was written by Paul Dini, with penciling by Joe Staton, and inks by Terry Beatty.

===&quot;Superman vs Lobo&quot;===
In &quot;Superman Adventures Special: Superman vs Lobo: Misery in Space&quot; (February 1998), Superman inhales a poison unleashed by some terrorists and leaves Earth to trace a radiation source that should cure him (though not lethal to Superman, the poison makes him a danger to the rest of Earth). Lobo is pointed to an artifact called the Nirvana Crystal, which emits the radiation source Superman requires. The two team up (not with the best of results) and head to the Maracot System.

The owner of the crystal, Squeed, is determined to launch it into the sun to cleanse the universe of evil (as his wife was killed in an accident, but he assumes it to be an evil act). Superman, much to Lobo&#x27;s dismay, has to destroy the crystal to keep it from going into the sun. The energy from the destruction of the crystal results in Superman&#x27;s ailment being cured. He leaves to go back to Earth before the council of Maracot can repay him and Lobo with their treasury. Lobo claims he will give Superman his share of the reward and the issue ends with him asking, &quot;Would I lie?&quot; The story was written by David Michelinie, with art by John Delaney and Mike Manley.

<text>Adam Smith University is a private distance learning university founded in 1991 by Donald Grunewald, who is still its president. Grunewald was president of Mercy College between 1972 and 1984.

==History==
Adam Smith&#x27;s current American mailing address is a private mailbox in Garapan on Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth. Adam Smith University asserts the establishment of a French unit called École Supérieure Universitaire Adam Smith, which offers academic degrees for work experience.

== Accreditation ==
Adam Smith University was accredited by the Liberian Ministry of Education since 1995, well before the most recent conflicts, and was accredited as a result of an act of the Liberian legislature. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board identifies the institution as operating from Liberia and Saipan, but states that it has &quot;no degree-granting authority from Liberia or Saipan.&quot;

==Criticism==
Steve Levicoff referred to Adam Smith University as a degree mill, and he noted that it operated in Louisiana due to the absence of laws regulating the granting of degrees. Adam Smith University and Columbia State University have the same address, which is &quot;likely a mail forwarding address&quot;.

Other critics have described Adam Smith University as a &quot;diploma mill&quot;. Alan Contreras from the Oregon State Office of Degree Authorization (ODA), an agency of that state&#x27;s government, called Adam Smith &quot;a diploma mill with a long and unattractive history&quot; in an article written in a personal capacity.

<text>Thomas Moult (1893–1974) was a versatile English journalist and writer, and one of the Georgian poets. He is known for his annual anthologies &quot;Best Poems of the Year&quot;, 1922 to 1943, which were popular verse selections taken from periodicals on both sides of the Atlantic. His poem &#x27;Truly He Hath A Sweet Bed&#x27; from &quot;Down Here the Hawthorn&quot; was set to music for chorus and orchestra by Cyril Rootham (as &quot;Brown Earth&quot;, 1921–2).

==Life==

He was born in Derbyshire, to Jewish parents. He wrote much newspaper criticism, on music and drama and as a book reviewer; and on sport in the popular press.

He founded a magazine, &quot;Voices&quot;, for young writers, in 1919, publishing Sherwood Anderson, A. E. Coppard, Louis Golding, F. V. Branford, and Neville Cardus. It has been described as &quot;eminently uncontroversial&quot;.

From 1952 to 1962 he was president of the Poetry Society and chairman of the editorial board of &quot;Poetry Review&quot;.

==Family==

Moult&#x27;s daughter Joy was the first wife of psychologist Oliver Zangwill.

<text>Gavin Heffernan (born April 2, 1980) is a Canadian filmmaker/screenwriter/photographer.

He co-wrote the psychological horror feature &quot;The Taking of Deborah Logan&quot; (2014) and Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension&quot; (2015) with writing partner Adam Robitel. &quot;Deadline&quot; reported in July 2021, that Heffernan and Robitel had partnered with Darren Aronofsky on a thriller series for Netflix titled &quot;The Craving&quot;. In July 2019, &quot;Deadline&quot; posted that Heffernan and Robitel had teamed up with Sam Raimi on an &quot;Untitled Supernatural Thriller&quot; for Sony Pictures.

Also known for directing experimental visual works, primarily timelapse, featured in the Rolling Stones&#x27; 2015 Zip Code Tour as well as their 2016 Desert Trip shows. Heffernan also contributed visuals to Pink Floyd&#x27;s Roger Waters&#x27; 2016 concerts, Paul Simon&#x27;s 2018 Homeward Bound Farewell Tour, and John Mayer&#x27;s 2022 Sob Rock tour. 

An alumnus of McGill University and the American Film Institute. While attending McGill in Montreal, Quebec, Gavin wrote, directed, and starred in the feature film &quot;Expiration&quot; (2003). Though budgeted at a meagre $10,000, &quot;Expiration&quot; was awarded the Grand Jury Prize in Toronto at the 2004 Canadian Filmmakers&#x27; Festival, received a 76% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, and acclaim from publications &quot;Variety&quot;, and &quot;Ain&#x27;t it Cool News&quot;. 

His unconventional anti-war documentary &quot;Grand Wheel&quot; (2008) premiered at SXSW and played more than fifty film festivals in twenty countries. His 2010 collection of experimental shorts about the fall of man titled &quot;Devolution&quot; premiered at the Florida Film Festival and won an Audience Award at the 2010 HollyShorts Film Festival. The sci-fi follow-up &quot;Devolution: Reckoning&quot; premiered at the 2011 Festival du Nouveau Cinema in Montreal.

&quot;Variety&quot; announced in October 2011 that Heffernan was attached to co-write the screen adaptation of Ray Manzarek&#x27;s &quot;The Poet in Exile&quot;, a novel exploring the notion that Jim Morrison of the Doors staged his death in 1971.

Heffernan&#x27;s timelapse art has been featured in Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s &quot;Ice on Fire&quot; global warming doc for HBO, Virgin America flights, BBC Earth, Bravo&#x27;s first scripted show &quot;Girlfriends&#x27; Guide to Divorce&quot;, and many other press and TV outlets including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, CNN, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;National Geographic&quot;, CBS News, and &quot;Wired&quot;. Borrego Springs, California, named their 2014 town festival after Heffernan&#x27;s &quot;Borrego Stardance&quot; astro timelapse and October 25 was subsequently named &quot;Gavin Heffernan Day&quot; in San Diego County by Senator Joel Anderson.

In 2015, Heffernan and Harun Mehmedinovic co-founded SKYGLOW, a crowdfunded book and Blu Ray project to tackle the rising danger and damage of urban light pollution. The fundraising campaign generated significant publicity and ended on May 9, 2015, as the fourth most successful Kickstarter campaign ever in the Photobooks category. The SKYGLOW book released in April 2017 at SKYGLOWPROJECT.COM and was created in association with the International Dark Sky Association.

<text>Robert Blair FRSE (1748 – 22 December 1828) was a Scottish astronomer.

==Life==

He was born in Garvald, East Lothian, the son of Rev Archibald Blair, the local minister.

In 1773 he was apprenticed to Dr Francis Balfour, a naval surgeon, and served in the Royal Navy in the West Indies. On return to Scotland he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and qualified as a doctor in 1785.

Robert Blair was the first Regius Professor of Astronomy at the University of Edinburgh (1785 until death). He invented the aplanatic lens and also coined this term. This was a significant step in reducing the aberration in optical systems. He also experimented with hollow lenses, holding different solutions.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1786.

He died in Westloch, Berwickshire on 22 December 1828.

<doc id="1060308" wikidata="Q714609" url="?curid=1060308" title="Frank Fenner">
<text>Frank John Fenner (21 December 1914 – 22 November 2010) was an Australian scientist with a distinguished career in the field of virology. His two greatest achievements are cited as overseeing the eradication of smallpox, and the attempted control of Australia&#x27;s rabbit plague through the introduction of &quot;Myxoma virus&quot;.

The Australian Academy of Science awards annually the prestigious Fenner Medal for distinguished research in biology by a scientist under 40 years of age.

==Early life and education==
Frank Johannes Fenner was born in Ballarat in 1914. The family moved to Adelaide, South Australia in November 1916. He attended Rose Park Primary School and Thebarton Technical School. He attended the University of Adelaide, where he earned degrees in medicine and surgery in 1938. That year, uneasy about Hitler&#x27;s rise, he legally changed his middle name from Johannes (the first name of his German-born paternal grandfather) to John.

==Career==
In May 1937, Fenner was a member of an Adelaide University anthropological expedition to Nepabunna Mission in the northern Flinders Ranges in South Australia led by J. B. Cleland, which also included Charles P. Mountford as ethnologist and photographer, as well as botanist Thomas Harvey Johnston and others.

From 1940 to 1946 he was a captain and Major in the Australian Army Medical Corps with service in Australia, Palestine, Egypt, New Guinea and Borneo, as medical officer in field ambulance and Casualty Clearing Station, pathologist to general hospital and malariologist. For his work in combating malaria in Papua New Guinea he was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1945.

Following his war-time service he was recruited by Frank Macfarlane Burnet to work at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne. Initially they worked on smallpox in mice, for which he coined the term &quot;mousepox&quot;, and later on the genetics of poxvirus.

In 1949, he received a fellowship to study at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City, he worked on mycobacterium Bairnsdale bacillus, which causes Buruli ulcer, the third most important mycobacterial disease worldwide after tuberculosis and leprosy. Here he worked with and was influenced by René Dubos, who is one of the claimed originators of the phrase &quot;Think Globally, Act Locally&quot;.

===In Canberra, 1949–2010===
Returning to Australia in 1949, he was appointed professor of microbiology at the new John Curtin School of Medical Research at the Australian National University, Canberra. Here he began studying viruses again, in particular the myxoma virus.

Throughout the 1940s and 1950s Australia had severe rabbit plagues. Fenner&#x27;s work on the myxoma virus showed that initially it killed rabbits in 9 to 11 days and was 99.5% lethal. Under heavy selection pressure, the few rabbits that survived developed resistance, which meant that the pest was never completely eradicated, but their numbers were reduced. Prior to the release of the virus as a biological control for the rabbits, Fenner, Frank Macfarlane Burnet and Ian Clunies Ross famously injected themselves with myxoma virus, to prove it was not dangerous for humans.

From 1967 to 1973 Fenner was Director of the John Curtin School of Medical Research. In 1977, he was named the chairman of the Global Commission for the Certification of Smallpox Eradication, the same year the last known case of naturally transmitted smallpox occurred in Somalia. Fenner announced the eradication of smallpox to the World Health Assembly on 8 May 1980. This success story is regarded as the greatest achievement of the World Health Organization. Before its eradication, smallpox was one of the world&#x27;s most virulent viruses, responsible for millions of deaths, and leaving many of the victims who survived with disfiguring scars for life.

Fenner had an abiding interest in the environment, and was the foundation Director of the Centre for Resources and Environmental Studies at the ANU (1973), where he worked until his retirement in 1979, and which became part of the Fenner School of Environment and Society in 2007. He was a keen supporter of Australia having an ecologically, socially sustainable population. He was emeritus professor at the John Curtin School of Medical Research.

In June 2010, he predicted in an interview with &quot;The Australian&quot; the extinction of the human race within a century, primarily as the result of human overpopulation, environmental degradation and climate change.

He died in Canberra on the morning of 22 November 2010 after a brief illness, and days after the birth of his first great-grandchild.

==Personal life==
In 1944 Fenner met Bobbie Roberts. Ellen Margaret &#x27;Bobbie&#x27; Roberts was a trained midwife and nurse. During World War II she worked on malaria with the Australian Army Nursing Service and through her work met Fenner. Shortly after they met they married in a Catholic ceremony (despite Fenner being an atheist). While keen to have children, the couple were infertile and with Bobbie having a hysterectomy in 1949 they decided to adopt. They subsequently adopted two children. Marilyn Aldus Fenner was born on 27 June 1950. Her biological parents were unknown. Victoria Fenner (born 1 March 1943) was adopted later at the request of her father (Fenner&#x27;s younger brother Tom) after the death in a fire of Victoria&#x27;s mother (Beverley Slaney).

On 30 March 1958, Victoria Fenner shot and killed herself, as part of a supposed suicide pact with another child, Catherine Webb, who provided the rifle and bullets. The coronial inquiry heard she had been passing through a period of extreme mental and spiritual disturbance and the coroner declared her death a suicide. Fenner himself was unable to fathom a motive, other than she was upset from reading Neville Shute&#x27;s book, &quot;On the Beach&quot;.

Bobbie Fenner was diagnosed with cancer in 1989 and eventually died in 1994. Marilyn Fenner and her family then moved into the family home and looked after her father until his death.

<doc id="1060311" wikidata="Q642884" url="?curid=1060311" title="Bonnington">
<text>Bonnington is a dispersed village and civil parish on the northern edge of the Romney Marsh in Ashford District of Kent, England. The village is located to the south of the town of Ashford on the B2067 (Hamstreet to Hythe road).

Bonnington has under 100 inhabitants and has historic connections with smuggling. The parish used to boast its own school at the T-junction with the former B2069, and a public house (The Oak) located nearly two miles southeast of the village. The parish church, dedicated to St Rumwold, the child saint, is about half a mile to the south of the hamlet, on the Royal Military Canal.

The parish council is now linked with the larger village of Aldington (where the population is now included) which is where the nearest shops can be found.

==Location and landscape==
The small parish of Bonnington in the English county of Kent lies between the town of Ashford to the west (5 miles distant) and the coastal town of Hythe to the east (6 miles distant). To the north, the parish is bordered by the parish of Aldington, to the west, it borders the parish of Bilsington and to the south, the parish stretches into the low-lying coastal region of Romney Marsh. The parish covers an area of around , of which about 40% forms part of Romney Marsh.

In landscape terms, the parish of Bonnington has much in common with its neighbour Aldington. Thus, parts of the parish are designated, and protected, as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and parts are designated, and protected, as forming part of the Old Romney Shoreline Special Landscape Area.

A particularly striking feature of Bonnington&#x27;s landscape is the low elevation above sea level of much of the land to the north of the Royal Military Canal – on average only 10 ft (3 m) to 100 ft (31 m) above sea level. This very low-lying area once lay directly on the English Channel, and the Royal Military Canal, which separates the low-lying area from the even lower Romney Marsh, marks the English Channel&#x27;s former shoreline.

There has never been a village of Bonnington, and thus the parish has no obvious centre. The description of &quot;scattered&quot; given to Bonnington by Ford Madox Ford in the 19th century is still apt today.

==People==
The parish of Bonnington is home to about 100 people living in around 45 houses. Only a small percentage of the parish&#x27;s population is under 80 years of age. The population is widely scattered but mainly related, with clusters around the village green and the picturesque Cherry Orchard Lane.

The writer Ford Madox Ford lived at Bloomfield Villa (now Fir Trees Villa) from 1894 for two years. He described some of the local characters in his books and recalled the village in &quot;Return to Yesterday&quot;, which was published in 1932.&quot;Bonnington was in a scattered, little-populated village of the South of England. The village stood on what had formerly been common land; running all down the side of a range of hills. But this common land had been long since squatted on, so that it was a maze of little hawthorn hedges surrounding little closes.&quot;

==Industry and commerce==
As in Aldington, agriculture is the only significant indigenous economic activities, albeit an insignificant source of employment. However, the predominance of agriculture in Bonnington is more noticeable than in Aldington parish because of the absence of any village centre and the absence of any infrastructure provided by shops, schools, pubs or post office. As with Aldington, the majority of Bonnington parishioners work in nearby towns or in London.

==Facilities==
The parish&#x27;s facilities include a mobile library, a public relief centre, a drift field and St Rumwold&#x27;s, a Grade I listed Church of England parish church.

==History==
Although Bonnington is mentioned in the 11th-century Domesday Book, little is known of its early history, other than the fact that for several centuries it was owned by the Knights Hospitaller. In the 19th century, smuggling was a significant activity in Bonnington, but this declined rapidly with the capture of the infamous Ransley Gang.

From at least the time of Queen Elizabeth I of England, if not before, an old oak tree known as the Law-Day Oak, has played a significant role in the governance of Bonnington parish. In earlier times, the Law-Day Oak provided the setting for Courts held to hear local pleas, and to this day the Bonnington Annual Parish Meeting is held under the branches of this ancient oak. 
In 1889 a Mrs White wrote in a learned journal thus about the Law-Day Oak:

&quot;In the out-of-the-way villages on the borders of Romney marsh, the former home of shepherds and smugglers, the light of civilisation has not long shone, and many rites and superstitions connected with the worship of the oak are still persisted in by the inhabitants. A special sacredness appertains to the vows of lovers exchanged beneath the Bonnington oak, and its leaves, gathered with a certain formula at a certain time of night, are still sought by childless women and made into a medicinal draught, with the same intention as in Druidical days.&quot;

<doc id="1060314" wikidata="Q854631" url="?curid=1060314" title="Yangshao culture">
<text>The Yangshao culture () was a Neolithic culture that existed extensively along the middle reaches of the Yellow River in China from around 5000 BC to 3000 BC. The culture is named after the Yangshao site, the first excavated site of this culture, which was discovered in 1921 in the town of Yangshao in western Henan by the Swedish geologist Johan Gunnar Andersson (1874–1960). The culture flourished mainly in Henan, as well as the neighboring provinces of Shaanxi and Shanxi.

Recent research indicates a common origin and spread of the Sino-Tibetan languages with the Cishan, Yangshao and/or Majiayao cultures.
==Economy==
===Subsistence===

The main food of the Yangshao people was millet, with some sites using foxtail millet and others proso millet, though some evidence of rice has been found. The exact nature of Yangshao agriculture, small-scale slash-and-burn cultivation versus intensive agriculture in permanent fields, is currently a matter of debate. Once the soil was exhausted, residents picked up their belongings, moved to new lands, and constructed new villages. Middle Yangshao settlements such as Jiangzhi contain raised-floor buildings that may have been used for the storage of surplus grains. Grinding stones for making flour were also found.

The Yangshao people kept pigs and dogs. Sheep, goats, and cattle are found much more rarely. Much of their meat came from hunting and fishing with stone tools. Their stone tools were polished and highly specialized. They may also have practiced an early form of sericulture.

===Crafts===
The Yangshao culture crafted pottery: Yangshao artisans created fine white, red, and black painted pottery with human facial, animal, and geometric designs. Unlike the later Longshan culture, the Yangshao culture did not use pottery wheels in pottery-making. Excavations found that children were buried in painted pottery jars. Pottery style emerging from the Yangshao culture spread westward to the Majiayao culture, and then further to Xinjiang and Central Asia.

The Yangshao culture produced silk to a small degree and wove hemp. Men wore loin clothes and tied their hair in a top knot. Women wrapped a length of cloth around themselves and tied their hair in a bun.

==Houses==

Houses were built by digging a rounded rectangular pit around one metre deep. Then they were rammed, and a lattice of wattle was woven over it. Then it was plastered with mud. The floor was also rammed down.
Next, a few short wattle poles would be placed around the top of the pit, and more wattle would be woven to it. It was plastered with mud, and a framework of poles would be placed to make a cone shape for the roof. Poles would be added to support the roof. It was then thatched with millet stalks. There was little furniture; a shallow fireplace in the middle with a stool, a bench along the wall, and a bed of cloth. Food and items were placed or hung against the walls. A pen would be built outside for animals.

Yangshao villages typically covered ten to fourteen acres and were composed of houses around a central square.

==Social structure==

Although early reports suggested a matriarchal culture, others argue that it was a society in transition from matriarchy to patriarchy, while still others believe it to have been patriarchal. The debate hinges on differing interpretations of burial practices.

The discovery of a Chinese dragon statue dating back to the fifth millennium BC in the Yangshao culture makes it the world&#x27;s oldest known dragon depiction.

==Archaeological sites==

Yangshao, in Mianchi County, Sanmenxia, western Henan, the place which gave the culture its name, has a museum next to the archaeological site. The archaeological site of the village of Banpo near Xi&#x27;an is one of the best-known ditch-enclosed settlements of the Yangshao. Another major settlement called Jiangzhai was excavated out to its limits, and archaeologists found that it was completely surrounded by a ring-ditch. Both Banpo and Jiangzhai also yielded incised marks on pottery which a few have interpreted as numerals or perhaps precursors to Chinese characters, but such interpretations are not widely accepted.

==Phases==
The Yangshao culture is conventionally divided into three phases:
* The Early Yangshao period or Banpo phase (–4000 BC) is represented by the Banpo, Jiangzhai, Beishouling and Dadiwan sites in the Wei River valley in Shaanxi.
* The Middle Yangshao period or Miaodigou phase (–3500 BC) saw an expansion of the culture in all directions, and the development of hierarchies of settlements in some areas, such as western Henan.
* The Late Yangshao period (–3000 BC) saw a greater spread of settlement hierarchies. The first wall of rammed earth in China was built around the settlement of Xishan (25 ha) in central Henan (near modern Zhengzhou).
The Majiayao culture () to the west is now considered a separate culture that developed from the middle Yangshao culture through an intermediate Shilingxia phase.

<doc id="1060317" wikidata="Q466803" url="?curid=1060317" title="Pallava dynasty">
<text>The Pallava dynasty existed from 275 CE to 897 CE, ruling a significant portion of the Deccan, also known as Tondaimandalam. The Pallavas played a crucial role in shaping in particular southern Indian history and heritage. The dynasty rose to prominence after the downfall of the Satavahana Empire, whom they had formerly served as feudatories.

The Pallavas became a major southern Indian power during the reign of Mahendravarman I (600–630 CE) and Narasimhavarman I (630–668 CE), and dominated the southern Telugu region and the northern parts of the Tamil region for about 600 years, until the end of the 9th century. Throughout their reign, they remained in constant conflict with both the Chalukyas of Vatapi to the north, and the Tamil kingdoms of Chola and Pandyas to their south. The Pallavas were finally defeated by the Chola ruler Aditya I in the 9th century CE.

The Pallavas are most noted for their patronage of Hindu Vaishnava temple architecture, the finest example being the Shore Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Mamallapuram. Kancheepuram served as the capital of the Pallava kingdom. The dynasty left behind magnificent sculptures and temples, and are recognized to have established the foundations of medieval southern Indian architecture, which some scholars believe the ancient Hindu treatise Manasara inspired. They developed the Pallava script, from which Grantha ultimately took form. This script eventually gave rise to several other Southeast Asian scripts such Khmer. The Chinese traveller Xuanzang visited Kanchipuram during Pallava rule and extolled their benign rule.

== Etymology ==
The word Pallava means a creeper or branch in Sanskrit. Pallava also means arrow or spruce in Tamil.

==Origins==
The origins of the Pallavas have been debated by scholars. The available historical materials include three copper-plate grants of Sivaskandavarman in the first quarter of the 4th century CE, all issued from Kanchipuram but found in various parts of Andhra Pradesh, and another inscription of Simhavarman I half century earlier in the Palnadu (Pallava Nadu) area of the western Guntur district. All the early documents are in Prakrit, and scholars find similarities in paleography and language with the Satavahanas and the Mauryas. Their early coins are said to be similar to those of Satavahanas. Two main theories regarding the origins of the Pallavas have emerged based on available historical data. The first theory suggests that the Pallavas were initially subordinate to the Satavahanas, a ruling dynasty in the Andhradesa region (north of the Penna River in modern-day Andhra Pradesh). According to this theory, the Pallavas later expanded their influence southward, eventually establishing their power in Kanchi (modern-day Kanchipuram). The second theory proposes that the Pallavas originated in Kanchi itself, where they initially rose to prominence. From there, they expanded their dominion northward, reaching as far as the Krishna River. Another theory posits that the Pallavas were descendants of Chola Prince Ilandiraiyan and had their roots in Tondaimandalam, the region around Kanchi. These theories provide different perspectives on the Pallavas&#x27; early history and territorial expansion, but the exact origins of the Pallava dynasty continue to be a subject of debate among historians.

The proponents of the Andhra origin theory include S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar and K. A. Nilakanta Sastri. They believe that Pallavas were originally feudatories of the Satavahanas in the south-eastern part of their empire who became independent when the Satavahana power declined. They are seen to be &quot;strangers to the Tamil country&quot;, unrelated to the ancient lines of Cheras, Pandyas and Cholas. Since Simhavarman&#x27;s grant bears no regal titles, they believe that he might have been a subsidiary to the Andhra Ikshvakus who were in power in &quot;Andhradesa&quot; at that time. In the following half-century, the Pallavas became independent and expanded up to Kanchi.

S. Krishnaswami Aiyengar also speculates that the Pallavas were natives of Tondaimandalam and the name Pallava is identical with the word Tondaiyar. Chola Prince Ilandiraiyan is traditionally regarded as the founder of the Pallava dynasty. Ilandiraiyan is referred to in the literature of the Sangam period such as the Pathupattu. In the Sangam epic Manimekalai, he is depicted as the son of Chola king Killi and the Naga princess Pilivalai, the daughter of king Valaivanan of Manipallavam.

Another theory is propounded by historians R. Sathianathaier and D. C. Sircar, with endorsements by Hermann Kulke, Dietmar Rothermund and Burton Stein. Sircar points out that the family legends of the Pallavas speak of an ancestor descending from Ashwatthama, the legendary warrior of &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, and his union with a &quot;Naga&quot; princess. According to Ptolemy, the &quot;Aruvanadu&quot; region between the northern and southern Penner rivers (Penna and Ponnaiyar) was ruled by a king Basaronaga around 140 CE. By marrying into this &quot;Naga&quot; family, the Pallavas would have acquired control of the region near Kanchi. While Sircar allows that Pallavas might have been provincial rulers under the later Satavahanas with a partial northern lineage, Sathianathaier sees them as natives of Tondaimandalam (the core region of Aruvanadu). He argues that they could well have adopted northern Indian practices under the Mauryan Asoka&#x27;s rule. He relates the name &quot;Pallava&quot; to Pulindas, whose heritage is borne by names such as &quot;Pulinadu&quot; and &quot;Puliyurkottam&quot; in the region.

According to Sir H. A. Stuart the Pallavas were Kurumbas and Kurubas their modern representatives. This is supported by Marathi historian R. C. Dhere who stated that Pallavas were originally pastoralists that belonged to Kuruba lineages. The territory of Pallavas was bordered by the Coromandel Coast along present Tamil Nadu and southern Andhra Pradesh. Out of the coins found here, the class of gold and silver coins belonging to the 2nd-7th century CE period contain the Pallava emblem, the maned lion, together with Kannada or Sanskrit inscription which showed that the Pallavas used Kannada too in their administration along with Prakrit, Sanskrit and Tamil.

Overlaid on these theories is another hypothesis of Sathianathaier which claims that &quot;Pallava&quot; is a derivative of Pahlava (the Sanskrit term for Parthians). According to him, partial support for the theory can be derived from a crown shaped like an elephant&#x27;s scalp depicted on some sculptures, which seems to resemble the crown of Demetrius I.

==Rivalries==
===With Cholas===

The Pallavas captured Kanchi from the Cholas as recorded in the Velurpalaiyam Plates, around the reign of the fifth king of the Pallava line Kumaravishnu I. Thereafter Kanchi figures in inscriptions as the capital of the Pallavas. The Cholas drove the Pallavas away from Kanchi in the mid-4th century, in the reign of Vishnugopa, the tenth king of the Pallava line. The Pallavas re-captured Kanchi from the Kalabhras in the mid-6th century, possibly in the reign of Simhavishnu, the fourteenth king of the Pallava line, whom the Kasakudi plates state as &quot;the lion of the earth&quot;. Thereafter the Pallavas held on to Kanchi until the 9th century, until the reign of their last king, Vijaya-Nripatungavarman.

===With Kadambas===
The Pallavas were in conflict with major kingdoms at various periods of time. A contest for political supremacy existed between the early Pallavas and the Kadambas. Numerous Kadamba inscriptions provide details of Pallava-Kadamba hostilities.

===With Kalabhras===
During the reign of Vishnugopavarman II (approx. 500–525), political convulsion engulfed the Pallavas due to the Kalabhra invasion of the Tamil country. Towards the close of the 6th century, the Pallava Simhavishnu stuck a blow against the Kalabhras. The Pandyas followed suit. Thereafter the Tamil country was divided between the Pallavas in the north with Kanchipuram as their capital, and Pandyas in the south with Madurai as their capital.

==Birudas==
The royal custom of using a series of descriptive honorific titles, &quot;Birudas&quot;, was particularly prevalent among the Pallavas. The Birudas of Mahendravarman I are in Sanskrit, Tamil and Telugu. The Telugu Birudas show Mahendravarman&#x27;s involvement with the Andhra region continued to be strong at the time he was creating his cave-temples in the Tamil region. The suffix &quot;Malla&quot; was used by the Pallava rulers. Mahendravarman I used the Biruda, &quot;Shatrumalla&quot;, &quot;a warrior who overthrows his enemies&quot;, and his grandson Paramesvara I was called &quot;Ekamalla&quot; &quot;the sole warrior or wrestler&quot;. Pallava kings, presumably exalted ones, were known by the title &quot;Mahamalla&quot; (&quot;great wrestler&quot;).

==Languages used==

Pallava inscriptions have been found in Tamil, 
Prakrit and Sanskrit. 

Tamil was main language used by the Pallavas in their inscriptions although a few records continued to be in Sanskrit. At the time of the time of Paramesvaravarman I, the practice came into vogue of inscribing a part of the record in Sanskrit and the rest in Tamil. Almost all the copper plate records, viz., Kasakudi, Tandantottam, Pattattalmangalm, Udayendiram and Velurpalaiyam are composed both in Sanskrit and Tamil.

Many Pallava royal inscriptions were in Sanskrit or Prakrit, considered the official languages. Similarly, inscriptions found in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka State are in Sanskrit and Prakrit. Sanskrit was widely used by Simhavishnu and Narasimhavarman II in literature. The phenomenon of using Prakrit as official languages in which rulers left their inscriptions and epigraphies continued till the 6th century. It would have been in the interest of the ruling elite to protect their privileges by perpetuating their hegemony of Prakrit in order to exclude the common people from sharing power (Mahadevan 1995a: 173–188). The Pallavas in their Tamil country used Tamil and Sanskrit in their inscriptions.

===Writing system===

Under the Pallava dynasty, a unique form of Grantha script, a descendant of Pallava script which is a type of Brahmic script, was used. Around the 6th century, it was exported eastwards and influenced the genesis of almost all Southeast Asian scripts.

==Religion==
Pallavas were followers of Hinduism and made gifts of land to gods and Brahmins. In line with the prevalent customs, some of the rulers performed the &quot;Aswamedha&quot; and other Vedic sacrifices. They were, however, tolerant of other faiths. The Chinese monk Xuanzang who visited Kanchipuram during the reign of Narasimhavarman I reported that there were 100 Buddhist monasteries, and 80 Hindu temples in Kanchipuram. The semi-legendary founder of Zen Buddhism, Bodhidharma, is in an Indian tradition regarded to be the third son of a Pallava king.

==Pallava architecture==
The Pallavas were instrumental in the transition from rock-cut architecture to stone temples. The earliest examples of Pallava constructions are rock-cut temples dating from 610 to 690 and structural temples between 690 and 900. A number of rock-cut cave temples bear the inscription of the Pallava king, Mahendravarman I and his successors.

Among the accomplishments of the Pallava architecture are the rock-cut temples at Mamallapuram. There are excavated pillared halls and monolithic shrines known as &quot;Rathas&quot; in Mahabalipuram. Early temples were mostly dedicated to Shiva. The Kailasanatha temple in Kanchipuram and the Shore Temple built by Narasimhavarman II, rock cut temple in Mahendravadi by Mahendravarman are fine examples of the Pallava style temples. The temple of Nalanda Gedige in Kandy, Sri Lanka is another. The famous Tondeswaram temple of Tenavarai and the ancient Koneswaram temple of Trincomalee were patronised and structurally developed by the Pallavas in the 7th century.

==Pallava society==
The Pallava period beginning with Simhavishnu (575 CE900 CE) was a transitional stage in southern Indian society with monument building, foundation of devotional (bhakti) sects of Alvars and Nayanars, the flowering of rural Brahmanical institutions of Sanskrit learning, and the establishment of &quot;chakravartin&quot; model of kingship over a territory of diverse people; which ended the pre-Pallavan era of territorially segmented people, each with their culture, under a tribal chieftain. While a system of ranked relationship among groups existed in the classical period, the Pallava period extolled ranked relationships based on ritual purity as enjoined by the &quot;shastras&quot;. Burton distinguishes between the &quot;chakravatin&quot; model and the &quot;kshatriya&quot; model, and likens kshatriyas to locally based warriors with ritual status sufficiently high enough to share with Brahmins; and states that in south India the kshatriya model did not emerge. As per Burton, south India was aware of the Indo-Aryan &quot;varna&quot; organised society in which decisive secular authority was vested in the &quot;kshatriyas&quot;; but apart from the Pallava, Chola and Vijayanagar line of warriors which claimed &quot;chakravartin&quot; status, only few locality warrior families achieved the prestigious kin-linked organisation of northern warrior groups.

==Chronology==

===Sastri chronology===

The earliest documentation on the Pallavas is the three copper-plate grants, now referred to as the &quot;Mayidavolu&quot; (from Maidavolu village in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh), &quot;Hirehadagali&quot; (from Hire Hadagali of Karnataka) and the &quot;British Museum&quot; plates (Durga Prasad, 1988) belonging to Skandavarman I and written in Prakrit. Skandavarman appears to have been the first great ruler of the early Pallavas, though there are references to other early Pallavas who were probably predecessors of Skandavarman. Skandavarman extended his dominions from the Krishna in the north to the Pennar in the south and to the Bellary district in the West. He performed the &quot;Aswamedha&quot; and other Vedic sacrifices and bore the title of &quot;Supreme King of Kings devoted to dharma&quot;.

The Hirahadagali copper plate (Bellary District) record in Prakrit is dated in the eighth year of Sivaskanda Varman to 283 CE and confirms the gift made by his father who is described merely as &quot;Bappa-deva&quot; (revered father) or Boppa. It will thus be clear that this dynasty of the Prakrit charters beginning with &quot;Bappa-deva&quot; were the historical founders of the Pallava dominion in southern India.

The Hirahadagalli Plates were found in Hirehadagali, Bellary district and is one of the earliest copper plates in Karnataka and belongs to the reign of early Pallava ruler Shivaskanda Varma. Pallava King Sivaskandavarman of Kanchi of the early Pallavas ruled from 275 to 300 CE, and issued the charter in 283 CE in the eighth year of his reign.

As per the Hirahadagalli Plates of 283 CE, Pallava King Sivaskandavarman granted an immunity viz the garden of Chillarekakodumka, which was formerly given by Lord Bappa to the Brahmins, freeholders of Chillarekakodumka and inhabitants of Apitti. Chillarekakodumka has been identified by some as ancient village Chillarige in Bellary, Karnataka.

In the reign of Simhavarman II, who ascended the throne in 436, the territories lost to the Vishnukundins in the north up to the mouth of the Krishna were recovered. The early Pallava history from this period onwards is furnished by a dozen or so copper-plate grants in Sanskrit. They are all dated in the regnal years of the kings. 

The following chronology was composed from these charters by Nilakanta Sastri in his &quot;A History of South India&quot;:

====Early Pallavas====
* Simhavarman I (275–300)
* Shivskandvarman (unknown) 
* Vijayskandavarman (unknown) 
* Skandavarman (unknown)
* Vishnugopa I (350–355)
* Kumaravishnu I (350–370)
* Skandavarman II (370–385)
* Viravarman (385–400)
* Skandavarman III (400–436)
* Simhavarman II (436–460)
* Skandavarman IV (460–480)
* Nandivarman I (480–510)
* Kumaravishnu II (510–530)
* Buddhavarman (530–540)
* Kumaravishnu III (540–550)
* Simhavarman III (550–560)

====Later Pallavas====

The incursion of the Kalabhras and the confusion in the Tamil country was broken by the Pandya Kadungon and the Pallava Simhavishnu. Mahendravarman I extended the Pallava Kingdom and was one of the greatest sovereigns. Some of the most ornate monuments and temples in southern India, carved out of solid rock, were introduced under his rule. He also wrote the play &quot;Mattavilasa Prahasana&quot;.

The Pallava kingdom began to gain both in territory and influence and were a regional power by the end of the 6th century, defeating kings of Ceylon and mainland Tamilakkam. Narasimhavarman I and Paramesvaravarman I stand out for their achievements in both military and architectural spheres. Narasimhavarman II built the Shore Temple.

* Simhavishnu (575–600)
* Mahendravarman I (600–630)
* Narasimhavarman I (Mamalla) (630–668)
* Mahendravarman II (668–672)
* Paramesvaravarman I (670–695)
* Narasimhavarman II (Raja Simha) (695–722)
* Paramesvaravarman II (705–710)

===== Later Pallavas of the Kadava Line =====
The kings that came after Paramesvaravarman II belonged to the collateral line of Pallavas and were descendants of Bhimavarman, the brother of Simhavishnu. They called themselves as Kadavas, Kadavesa and Kaduvetti. Hiranyavarman, the father of Nandivarman Pallavamalla is said to have belonged to the Kadavakula in epigraphs. Nandivarman II himself is described as &quot;one who was born to raise the prestige of the Kadava family&quot;.
*Nandivarman II (Pallavamalla) (732–796) son of Hiranyavarman of Kadavakula
* Dantivarman (795–846)
* Nandivarman III (846–869)
* Aparajitavarman (879–897)

===Aiyangar chronology===

According to the available inscriptions of the Pallavas, historian S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar proposes the Pallavas could be divided into four separate families or dynasties; some of whose connections are known and some unknown. Aiyangar states We have a certain number of charters in Prakrit of which three are important ones. Then follows a dynasty which issued their charters in Sanskrit; following this came the family of the great Pallavas beginning with Simha Vishnu; this was followed by a dynasty of the usurper Nandi Varman, another great Pallava. We are overlooking for the present the dynasty of the Ganga-Pallavas postulated by the Epigraphists. The earliest of these Pallava charters is the one known as the Mayidavolu 1 (Guntur district) copper-plates.

Based on a combination of dynastic plates and grants from the period, Aiyangar proposed their rule thus:

====Early Pallavas====
* Bappadevan, chola prince (250–275)married a Naga of Mavilanga (Kanchi) – &quot;The Great Founder of a Pallava lineage&quot;
* Shivaskandavarman I (275–300)
* Simhavarman (300–320)
* Bhuddavarman (320–335)
* Bhuddyankuran (335–340)

====Middle Pallavas====
* Visnugopa (340–355) (&quot;Yuvamaharaja Vishnugopa&quot;)
* Kumaravisnu I (355–370)
* Skanda Varman II (370–385)
* Vira Varman (385–400)
* Skanda Varman III (400–435)
* Simha Varman II (435–460)
* Skanda Varman IV (460–480)
* Nandi Varman I (480–500)
* Kumaravisnu II ( 500–510)
* Buddha Varman ( 510–520)
* Kumaravisnu III ( 520–530)
* Simha Varman III ( 530–537)

====Later Pallavas====
*Simhavishnu (537–570)
*Mahendravarman I (571–630)
*Narasimhavarman I (Mamalla) (630–668)
*Mahendravarman II (668–672)
*Paramesvaravarman I (672–700)
*Narasimhavarman II (Raja Simha) (700–727)
*Paramesvaravarman II (705–710)

===== Later Pallavas of the Kadava Line =====
*Nandivarman II (Pallavamalla) (732–796) son of Hiranyavarman of Kadavakula
*Dantivarman (775–825)
*Nandivarman III (825–869)
*Nirupathungan (869–882)
*Aparajitavarman (882–896)

===Genealogy of Māmallapuram Praśasti===

=== Relation with the Cholas ===
According to historian S. Krishnaswami Aiyengar, the Pallavas were natives of Tondaimandalam and the name Pallava is identical with the word Tondaiyar. Chola Prince Ilandiraiyan is traditionally regarded as the founder of the Pallava dynasty. Ilandiraiyan is referred to in the literature of the Sangam period such as the Pathupattu. In the Sangam epic Manimekalai, he is depicted as the son of Chola king Killi and the Naga princess Pilivalai, the daughter of king Valaivanan of Manipallavam. When the boy grew up the princess wanted to send her son to the Chola kingdom. So she entrusted the prince to a merchant who dealt in woolen blankets called Kambala Chetty when his ship stopped in the island of Manipallavam. During the voyage to the Chola kingdom, the ship was wrecked due to rough weather and the boy was lost. He was later found washed ashore with a Tondai twig (creeper) around his leg. So he came to be called Tondaiman Ilam Tiraiyan meaning &quot;the young one of the seas or waves&quot;. When he grew up the northern part of the Chola kingdom was entrusted to him and the area he governed came to be called Tondaimandalam after him.He was a poet himself and four of his songs are extant even today. He ruled from Tondaimandalam and was known as &quot;Tondaman.&quot;

==Other relationships==
Pallava royal lineages were influential in the old kingdom of Kedah of the Malay Peninsula under Rudravarman I, Champa under Bhadravarman I and the Kingdom of the Funan in Cambodia. Some historians have claimed the present Palli Vanniyar caste are descendants of the Pallavas who ruled the Andhra and Tamil countries between the 6th and 9th centuries. Tamil scholar M. Srinivasa Iyengar claimed claimed the Pallis were one of the communities who served often in Pallava armies.

The similarity of the name ending &quot;-varman&quot; of Pallava rulers with that of Hindu kings during the Hindu/Buddhist era of Indonesia such as king Mulavarman of the Kutai Martadipura Kingdom, king Purnawarman of the Tarumanagara kingdom, king Adityawarman of the Malayapura kingdom, etc. has been commented upon by historians since discovery. There have been possible high relations and connections of the Hindu kingdoms of Indonesia with the Pallava dynasty and other Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms of India back then.

There are two maritime features near Pedra Branca. Middle Rocks, under the sovereignty of Malaysia, consists of two clusters of small rocks about apart situated south of Pedra Branca. South Ledge, which is to the south-south-west of Pedra Branca, is a rock formation visible only at low-tide.

Pedra Branca was known to sailors for centuries. It was originally within the territory of the Johor Sultanate, which was founded in 1528, and remained under the new Sultanate of Johor while under the British sphere of influence following the signing of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Between 1850 and 1851, the British built Horsburgh Lighthouse on the island without seeking the consent of the Johor authorities or informing them of the decision. From that time, the Straits Settlements administered the island; Singapore then assumed responsibility in 1946 after the dissolution of the Straits Settlements. On 21 September 1953, the Acting State Secretary of Johor, responding to a query from the Colonial Secretary of Singapore about the status of the island, stated that &quot;the Johore Government does not claim ownership of Pedra Branca&quot;.

On 21 December 1979, Malaysia published a map that showed the island to be within its territorial waters. This ignited a 29-year territorial dispute which, together with the issue of sovereignty over the nearby maritime features of Middle Rocks and South Ledge, the disputants presented to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for resolution. On 23 May 2008, the ICJ ruled that Pedra Branca was under Singapore&#x27;s sovereignty. At this point, the ICJ also noted Singapore&#x27;s plans to conduct reclamation at Pedra Branca. Although the island had originally been under the sovereignty of the Johor Sultanate, the United Kingdom and Singapore had carried out various acts of sovereignty in respect of the island. The failure of Malaysia and its predecessors to respond to these acts, and other actions that demonstrated their acknowledgment of Singapore&#x27;s sovereignty over the island, meant that Singapore had gained sovereignty over Pedra Branca. On the other hand, Middle Rocks remain part of Malaysian territory as Singapore had not manifested any acts of sovereignty in respect to it. The Court did not rule definitively on the remaining outcrop, South Ledge, declaring that it belonged to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. Malaysia and Singapore have established the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and to determine the ownership of South Ledge.

On 1 February 2019, Pedra Branca was added to East Coast GRC for the Parliament of Singapore.

==Etymology==
Pedra Branca means &quot;white rock&quot; in Portuguese, and refers to whitish guano (bird droppings) deposited on the rock by the black-naped tern, which used the island as a nesting ground. This name is used by both the English-language and Malay-language press in Singapore. Malaysia formerly referred to the island as Pulau Batu Puteh, which means &quot;white rock island&quot; in Malay, but the Government of Malaysia subsequently decided to drop the word &quot;Pulau&quot; (&quot;Island&quot;). In August 2008 Foreign Minister Rais Yatim said Malaysia considered that the maritime feature did not meet internationally recognised criteria for an island, that is, land inhabited by humans that had economic activity.

The island is known in Mandarin as &quot;Baijiao&quot; (), which means &quot;white reef&quot;. The Tamil name is , a transliteration of Pedra Branca.

==Geography==
Pedra Branca, located at 1° 19′ 48″ N and 104° 24′ 27″ E, is an island with an area of about at low tide. During the low water spring tide it measures, at its longest, a mere and has an average width of . It is approximately to the east of Singapore; south of Johor, Malaysia; and north of Bintan, Indonesia.

There are two maritime features near Pedra Branca. Middle Rocks, which is under the sovereignty of Malaysia, consists of two clusters of small rocks about apart situated south of the island. They stand to permanently above water. South Ledge, on the other hand, is a rock formation visible only at low-tide. It is to the south-south-west of Pedra Branca. Its ownership has yet to be definitively determined by Malaysia and Singapore.

Rock samples from Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge show they are all composed of a light, coarse-grained biotite granite. Therefore, from a geomorphological standpoint, the three maritime features belong to the same rock body.
==History==


Pedra Branca was known to sailors for centuries. Part of the Chinese sailing instructions for the South China Sea based on information compiled by Admiral Zheng He (1371–1433) advised a navigator that after departing Long Ya Men (Mandarin for &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Teeth Gate&quot;), a rocky outcrop at the gateway to what is now Keppel Harbour in Singapore, he should steer a course of between 75° and 90° for five watches until his vessel reached &quot;Baijiao&quot;. Pedra Branca was also mentioned in Dutch voyager Jan Huyghen van Linschoten&#x27;s &quot;Itinerario&quot; (&quot;Itinerary&quot;), an account of his voyages in the Portuguese East Indies. After the publication of the work in 1596, the island began appearing regularly on European maps of the Far East. The 1598 English edition of the work stated:

Pedra Branca was originally within the territory of the Johor-Riau Sultanate, which was founded in 1528 by Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah II, the son of Sultan Mahmud Shah of the Malacca Sultanate. In the mid-17th century, the Dutch Governor of Malacca wrote to the Dutch East India Company, asking it to send two boats to the Straits of Singapore to &quot;cruise to the south of Singapore Straits under the Hook of Barbukit and in the vicinity of Pedra Branca&quot; to stop Chinese traders from entering Johor River. The plan was put into force, and two Chinese junks were captured in the Straits and diverted to Malacca. However, this action provoked a protest from the Sultan of Johor, which showed that the Sultan regarded the junks&#x27; seizure as an infringement of his sovereignty in the area. Three letters written in 1824 to the Government of India by the British Resident in Singapore, John Crawfurd, also confirm it was his understanding that all the islands in the region of the Straits of Singapore came under the Johor Sultanate.

In addition, other 19th-century documents show that the Sultan of Johor exercised authority over the &quot;Orang Laut&quot; (&quot;sea people&quot;) who inhabited the maritime areas of the Straits of Singapore and visited Pedra Branca. One of these was a letter of November 1850 by John Turnbull Thomson, the Government Surveyor of Singapore, which reported on the need to exclude the &quot;Orang Laut&quot; from Pedra Branca where Horsburgh Lighthouse was being built. Calling them a &quot;half fishing half piratical sect&quot;, Thomson noted that they &quot;frequently visit the rock so their visits should never be encouraged nor any trust put in them ... In the straits and islets of the neighbouring shores and islands many lives are taken by these people.&quot;

On 17 March 1824, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands signed the Anglo–Dutch Treaty of 1824. It divided the old Johor Sultanate into two new Sultanates: the new Sultanate of Johor, which would be under the British sphere of influence, and the Sultanate of Riau–Lingga under Dutch influence. Under Article XII of the Treaty, Britain agreed that &quot;no British Establishment shall be made on the Carimon Isles, or on the Island of Bantam, Bintang, Lingin, or on any of the other Islands South of the Straits of Singapore ...&quot; The islands and islets within the Straits fell within the British sphere of influence. This included Pedra Branca, which thus remained part of the territorial domain of the new Johor Sultanate.

===1840s to 1851: Construction of Horsburgh Lighthouse===
Captain James Horsburgh, a Scottish hydrographer to the British East India Company who had prepared many charts and sailing instructions for the East Indies, China, New Holland, the Cape of Good Hope and other intermediate ports, died in May 1836. Merchants and mariners felt that the building of one or more lighthouses would be a fitting tribute to him, and in as early as November 1836 Pedra Branca was proposed as one of the preferred sites. By 1844, preference had been expressed for Romania Outer Island, or Peak Rock. Some time in November 1844, the Governor of the Straits Settlements, William John Butterworth, wrote to the Sultan and the Temenggung of Johor regarding the matter. His letters have not been found, but English translations of the replies, dated 25 November 1844, indicate that the Sultan and Temenggung favoured the proposal. In particular, the Temenggung wrote that &quot;the [East India] company are at full liberty to put up a Light House there, or any spot deemed eligible&quot;. Three days later, on 28 November, the Governor wrote to the Secretary of the Government in India to recommend that the lighthouse be sited on Peak Rock. Among other things, he said that &quot;[t]his Rock is part of the Territories of the Rajah of Johore, who with the Tamongong ... have willingly consented to cede it gratuitously to the East India Company&quot;, and enclosed the replies received from the Sultan and Temenggung. Although this was apparently the Governor&#x27;s understanding of the situation, he did not communicate it to the Sultan and Temenggung. It is unclear whether the correspondence was limited to Peak Rock or extended to other potential sites for the lighthouse such as Pedra Branca, and whether the sovereignty of Johor over any place chosen for the lighthouse was ceded to the British Government or only a permission to build, maintain and operate a lighthouse was granted.

On 22 August 1845, Governor Butterworth wrote again to the Government of India, indicating he trusted that construction of the lighthouse on Peak Rock would begin soon &quot;as a light in that quarters is becoming daily of more paramount importance&quot;. Between 1824 and 1851, at least 16 sizeable vessels were wrecked in the vicinity of Pedra Branca and Point Romania (on the Johor coast). However, in April 1846, the Lords of the Admiralty in London informed the Court of Directors of the East India Company they were inclined to think that Pedra Branca was the best point for the lighthouse. John Thomson and Captain S. Congalton, commander of the East India Company&#x27;s steamer called the &quot;Hooghly&quot;, carried out surveys in May and August. In a report dated 25 August, they said they were &quot;decidedly of opinion that Pedra Branca is the only proper position for a Light to be placed ... for the safety of Shipping whether entering or departing for the Straits of Singapore ...&quot; The following day, Governor Butterworth wrote to the Government of India stating that the Government &quot;will at once perceive that Pedra Branca is the only true position&quot; for the lighthouse. On 30 October 1846, the President in Council in India approved Pedra Branca as the site for the lighthouse. The East India Company gave its approval on 24 February 1847, and on 10 May of that year the Government of India asked Governor Butterworth to take measures for the construction of the lighthouse. There is no evidence that the authorities in Singapore thought it necessary or desirable to inform the Johor authorities of the decision about the siting of the lighthouse or to seek any consent for its erection.

Although the private subscribers wishing to commemorate Horsburgh had raised a sum which, with compound interest, came up to more than 7,400 Spanish dollars when it was paid over to the Singapore authorities, there was still a shortfall of funds for the building works. Thus, the Government of India, in agreement with the East India Company, authorised Governor Butterworth to prepare a law imposing a duty on vessels entering Singapore and asked him to take immediate measures to begin constructing the lighthouse. The Light Dues Act 1852 was duly enacted by the Governor-General of India in Council on 30 January 1852. Thomson, appointed by the Governor as the architect for the project, took charge of planning and supervising the construction of Horsburgh Lighthouse. Construction work began in late March or early April 1850. On Queen Victoria&#x27;s birthday, 24 May 1850, the foundation stone was laid at a ceremony conducted by members of the newly founded Masonic Lodge Zetland in the East No. 749 and attended by the Governor, the commander of the Singapore garrison, a rear admiral and several foreign consuls. The construction of the lighthouse then continued till 21 October, and resumed after the monsoon in April 1851. Up to 50 workmen were involved, including Chinese carpenters and stonemasons and their Malay assistants, Indian quarrymen and convict labourers, a cook and his assistant, and six lascars to defend the island from attack by pirates. The pirates of the South China Sea were notorious – during the construction of Horsburgh Lighthouse nine Chinese labourers were killed in pirate raids. Building materials and supplies were brought by the &quot;Hooghly&quot;, supported by two gunboats and two lighters. Unless he was required elsewhere, Thomson stayed on the island to supervise the works. The ceremonial first lighting of the lamp was arranged for 27 September 1851, again attended by the Governor, Masons of the Zetland Lodge, foreign dignitaries, senior residents of Singapore and other notables; the &quot;Singapore Free Press&quot; reported: &quot;A simultaneous rising [of the guests from the dinner table] announced that the process of illumination had commenced. Three hearty cheers welcomed the light, the meteor-like brilliancy of which will probably serve to guide the midnight path of the mariner for a thousand years to come.&quot; On 15 October the lighthouse was permanently turned on, and Thomson finally departed Pedra Branca for Singapore on the &quot;Hooghly&quot; on 18 November 1851.

===1852 to the 1970s===
The Light Dues Acts of 1852 and 1854 (India) declared that Horsburgh Lighthouse and its appurtenances were the property of and vested in the East India Company. In 1867, the Straits Settlements, of which Singapore was a part, became a Crown Colony, and by the Straits Settlements Light-Houses Ordinance 1912, the lighthouse was vested in Singapore. After 1912, the duties levied on ships passing through the Singapore Strait were abolished; instead, the costs of the lighthouse were shared by the neighbouring states.

In 1946, following World War II, Singapore became a separate Crown Colony. The other Straits Settlements, Malacca and Penang, joined the Malay states (including Johor) to form the Malayan Union. The latter became the Federation of Malaya in 1948, and the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. On 17 June 1953, the Colonial Secretary of Singapore wrote to the British Adviser to the Sultan of Johor to clarify the status of Pedra Branca. He noted that the rock was outside the limits ceded by Sultan Hussein Shah and the Temenggung with the island of Singapore under the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance of 2 August 1824 they had entered into with the East India Company. However, the Colonial Government had been maintaining the lighthouse built on it, and &quot;[t]his by international usage no doubt confers some rights and obligations on the Colony&quot;. He therefore asked if &quot;there is any document showing a lease or grant of the rock or whether it has been ceded by the Government of the State of Johore or in any other way disposed of&quot;. The Acting State Secretary of Johor replied on 21 September that &quot;the Johore Government does not claim ownership of Pedra Branca&quot;. This correspondence indicated that as of 1953 Johor understood it did not have sovereignty over Pedra Branca, which had therefore vested in the United Kingdom.

The Colony of Singapore became a self-governing state in 1959 and left the British Empire to join the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. Two years later, in 1965, Singapore became a fully independent republic. In 1959, in an official publication regarding meteorological information collected on Pedra Branca, Malaya listed Horsburgh Lighthouse as a &quot;Singapore&quot; station together with the Sultan Shoal and Raffles Lighthouses. The lighthouse on Pedra Branca was described in the same way in a joint Malaysian and Singaporean publication in 1966, the year after Singapore left the Federation. In 1967, when the two countries began reporting meteorological information separately, Malaysia ceased referring to Horsburgh Lighthouse. In maps published by the Malayan and Malaysian Surveyor General and Director of General Mapping in 1962, 1965, 1970, 1974 and 1975, the island was indicated with the word &quot;(SINGAPORE)&quot; or &quot;(SINGAPURA)&quot; under it. The same designation was used for an island that was unquestionably under Singapore&#x27;s sovereignty. On the other hand, the designation was not used for Pulau Pisang, an island under Malaysian sovereignty on which Singapore operated a lighthouse.

Singapore replaced the original kerosene-fired lamp of Horsburgh Lighthouse with automated navigational lights in the 1970s. In 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1978, the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) considered the feasibility of carrying out reclamation of about of land around Pedra Branca, but did not go ahead with the project. On 30 May 1977, with the permission of the PSA, the Republic of Singapore Navy installed a military rebroadcast station which it shared with the Republic of Singapore Air Force. Subsequently, the PSA installed a helipad on the eastern half of the island, and a communications tower for its Vessel Traffic Information System for the 900-odd ships that pass daily through the south and middle channels which are the main shipping channels of the eastern part of the Singapore Strait.

===1980s to present===
In the 1980s, Malaysian Marine Police boats entered the waters around Pedra Branca on several occasions. However, both Malaysia and Singapore acted with restraint, the Singapore Navy having been given strict instructions not to escalate matters. In 1989, the then Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad made an unannounced visit to the vicinity of the island. His boat was intercepted by Singapore naval vessels. To avoid an international incident, he directed his boat to leave.

With effect from 27 June 2002, Pedra Branca was declared a protected area within the meaning of the Protected Areas and Protected Places Act. Consequently, a permit from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is required for access to the island, and unauthorised presence there is a criminal offence. On 6 October 2008, a Singaporean man, Roger Lee, was convicted of illegally landing on Pedra Branca. In court documents, he said he had gone to Batam, Indonesia, in 1998. He later married and started a family with an Indonesian woman, but she left him in 2007 due to his unstable income and inability to hold down a job. As he had illegally overstayed in Indonesia and had been cheated of his passport and other personal documents by a friend, Lee hatched a plan to pretend to be a lost fisherman in the hope that the Police Coast Guard would rescue him and take him back to Singapore. On 5 February 2008, he paid a boatman to transport him out to sea in a motorised sampan. As he did not see any coast guard or navy patrols he disembarked on Pedra Branca and was arrested by staff stationed there. Lee pleaded guilty to illegally entering Singapore via an unauthorised landing place. A second charge of being found in a protected place without permission was taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. In mitigation, Lee&#x27;s &quot;pro bono&quot; lawyer said that there was no sign on Pedra Branca&#x27;s warning against trespassing on the island. Lee was sentenced to six weeks&#x27; imprisonment.

Speaking at the Singapore Energy Conference on 4 November 2008, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew mentioned that the Singapore Government had considered reclaiming land and building a nuclear power plant on Pedra Branca. Such a plant could not be built on the main island of Singapore as international standards require a safety zone of around the plant. However, it was recognised that this was probably not feasible as Pedra Branca is less than 30 kilometres from the Malaysian coast.

On 5 July 2021, the Singapore Government announced plans to proceed with reclamation around Pedra Branca to improve maritime safety, and search and rescue (SAR) efforts in the surrounding waters. The works, scheduled to begin at the end of 2021, would expand Pedra Branca to 7 hectares from the existing 0.86 hectares today, and be carried out by the Housing and Development Board, a statutory board of the Ministry of National Development. New facilities planned for the island include berthing areas for ships to dock and logistical, administrative and communications buildings.

==Territorial dispute==
===International Court of Justice case===
On 21 December 1979, the Director of National Mapping of Malaysia published a map entitled &quot;Territorial Waters and Continental Shelf Boundaries of Malaysia&quot; showing Pedra Branca to be within its territorial waters. Singapore rejected this claim in a diplomatic note of 14 February 1980 and asked for the map to be corrected. The dispute was not resolved by an exchange of correspondence and intergovernmental talks in 1993 and 1994. In the first round of talks in February 1993 the issue of sovereignty over Middle Rocks and South Ledge was also raised. Malaysia and Singapore, therefore, agreed to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), signing a Special Agreement for this purpose in February 2003 and notifying the Court of it in July 2003. The case was heard at the Peace Palace in The Hague between 6 and 23 November 2007.

The ICJ delivered its judgment on 23 May 2008. It held that although Pedra Branca had originally been under the sovereignty of Johor, the conduct of Singapore and its predecessors &quot;à titre de souverain&quot; (with the title of a sovereign) and the failure of Malaysia and its predecessors to respond to such conduct showed that by 1980, when the dispute between the parties arose, sovereignty over the island had passed to Singapore. The relevant conduct on the part of Singapore and its predecessors included investigating marine accidents in the vicinity of the island, planning land reclamation works, installing naval communications equipment, and requiring Malaysian officials wishing to visit the island to obtain permits. In contrast, Johor and its successors had taken no action with respect to the island from June 1850 for a century or more. In 1953 the Acting Secretary of the State of Johor had stated that Johor did not claim ownership of Pedra Branca. All visits made to the island had been with Singapore&#x27;s express permission, and maps published by Malaysia in the 1960s and 1970s indicated that it recognised Singapore&#x27;s sovereignty over Pedra Branca.

Like Pedra Branca, the Sultan of Johor held the original ancient title to Middle Rocks. As Singapore had not exercised any rights as a sovereign over Middle Rocks, the ICJ determined that Malaysia retained sovereignty over this maritime feature. As for South Ledge, the ICJ noted that it fell within the apparently overlapping territorial waters of mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. As the Court had not been mandated to draw the line of delimitation with respect to the territorial waters of Malaysia and Singapore in the area in question, it simply held that sovereignty over South Ledge belonged to the state which owned the territorial waters in which it is located.

===Reactions to ICJ decision===
Although both Malaysia and Singapore had agreed to respect and accept the ICJ&#x27;s decision, Malaysian Foreign Minister Rais Yatim later said his country had renewed its search for the letters written by Governor Butterworth to the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor seeking permission to build Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca. He noted that the rules of the ICJ allowed a case to be reviewed within ten years if new evidence was adduced. In response, Singapore&#x27;s Law Minister K. Shanmugam said that the city-state would wait to see what new evidence the Malaysian government could come up with.

A week after the delivery of the ICJ&#x27;s judgment, the Foreign Ministry of Malaysia asked the Malaysian media to cease using the Malay word &quot;Pulau&quot; (&quot;Island&quot;) for Pedra Branca and to refer to it as &quot;Batu Puteh&quot; or &quot;Pedra Branca&quot;. On 21 July 2008, in response to questions from Singapore Members of Parliament about Pedra Branca, the Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Balaji Sadasivan stated that the maritime territory around the island included a territorial sea of up to and an Exclusive Economic Zone. This was condemned by Malaysia&#x27;s Foreign Minister Rais Yatim as &quot;against the spirit of Asean and the legal structure&quot; as the claim was &quot;unacceptable and unreasonable and contradicts the principles of international law&quot;. In response, a Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said that Singapore first stated its claim to a territorial sea and Exclusive Economic Zone on 15 September 1980, and reiterated this claim on 23 May 2008 following the ICJ&#x27;s judgment. Both statements had made clear that if the limits of Singapore&#x27;s territorial sea or Exclusive Economic Zone overlapped with the claims of neighbouring countries, Singapore would negotiate with those countries to arrive at agreed delimitations in accordance with international law. In August 2008, Rais said Malaysia took the view that Singapore was not entitled to claim an Exclusive Economic Zone around Pedra Branca as it considered that the maritime feature did not meet internationally recognised criteria for an island, that is, land inhabited by humans that had economic activity.

At the National Day Awards in August 2008, Singapore announced that awards would be conferred on a number of people and organisations for their special contributions towards the Pedra Branca case. Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong; Tommy Koh, Ambassador-at-Large; and Justice Chao Hick Tin, then Attorney-General of Singapore, who appeared as counsel and advocates for Singapore, would respectively be awarded the &quot;Darjah Utama Temasek&quot; (Order of Temasek) (Second Class), the &quot;Darjah Utama Nila Utama&quot; (Order of Nila Utama) (First Class), and the &quot;Darjah Utama Bakti Cemerlang&quot; (Distinguished Service Order). The &quot;Pingat Jasa Gemilang&quot; (Meritorius Service Medal) would be conferred on Sivakant Tiwari s/o Thakurprasad Tiwari, Special Consultant to the International Affairs Division of the Attorney-General&#x27;s Chambers. Twenty-two people from the Attorney-General&#x27;s Chambers, Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, National Archives of Singapore, National Library Board, National University of Singapore and Supreme Court of Singapore would receive the &quot;Pingat Pentadbiran Awam&quot; (Public Administration Medal), the &quot;Pingat Kepujian&quot; (Commendation Medal) and the &quot;Pingat Berkebolehan&quot; (Efficiency Medal). The President&#x27;s Certificate of Commendation would be issued to the Coastal Command (COSCOM), Republic of Singapore Navy; the Police Coast Guard, Singapore Police Force; the Centre for Heritage Services, Ministry of Defence; the National Archives of Singapore; and the Hydrographic Department, Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore. The awards were presented on 17 November 2008.

===Resolution of outstanding issues===
Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks and to determine the ownership of South Ledge. Following a meeting on 3 June 2008, the Committee agreed that a technical sub-committee would be established to oversee the conduct of joint survey works to prepare the way for talks on maritime issues in and around the area. If any incident occurred in and around the waters of Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, either side would provide humanitarian assistance to the vessels involved. Finally, both Malaysian and Singaporean fishermen could continue traditional fishing activities in those waters. In September 2008, the Joint Technical Committee reported that its Sub-Committee on Joint Survey Works was finalising technical preparations for a hydrographic survey that would provide data for future delimitation discussions. A Sub-Committee on Maritime and Airspace Management and Fisheries had also been formed, and after a meeting on 20 August 2008 it decided that traditional fishing activities by both countries should continue in waters beyond off Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge. In October 2023, at the 10th Singapore-Malaysia Leaders&#x27; Retreat, Singapore&#x27;s then-Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Malaysia&#x27;s Prime Minister Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim released a joint statement saying that they looked forward to the resolution of the outstanding bilateral maritime boundary delimitation issues. The offices have yet to release the results of any follow-ups.

===Malaysian application for review and withdrawal===
On 2 February 2017, Malaysia applied to the ICJ pursuant to Article 61 of the Statute of the ICJ for the revision of the 2008 judgment on the basis of three documents it had obtained from of the UK between August 2016 and January 2017. The documents were internal correspondence of Singapore&#x27;s colonial government in 1958, an incident report submitted by a British naval officer in the same year, and a 1960s map of naval operations bearing annotations. The Malaysian Government said that these documents indicated that &quot;officials at the highest levels in the British colonial and Singaporean administration appreciated that Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh did not form part of Singapore’s sovereign territory&quot; during the relevant period. However, according to Shahriman Lockman, a senior analyst at Malaysia&#x27;s Institute of Strategic and International Studies, &quot;there’s very little precedent for revisions to ICJ judgments&quot;. Reports suggest that the timing of the application coincides with the upcoming elections in Malaysia, as the ruling Barisan Nasional Coalition, which is currently under pressure over the IMDb scandal, could &quot;use the renewed legal fight over Pedra Branca as a means to show it was &#x27;best placed to display strong leadership in the country&#x27;s foreign policy so as to safeguard Malaysia&#x27;s sovereignty&#x27;&quot;.

Singapore&#x27;s Foreign Ministry said that a team including Attorney-General Lucien Wong, and Chan Sek Keong, S. Jayakumar and Tommy Koh (who had represented Singapore at the original ICJ hearing), had been appointed to study and respond to the claim. On 5 February 2017, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam commented that on a cursory examination of the documents without detailed legal advice, he did not see how the documents would make any difference to the ICJ&#x27;s judgment.

On 30 Jun 2017, Malaysia applied to the ICJ to request an interpretation of the ICJ&#x27;s 2008 judgment. This application is &quot;separate and autonomous&quot; from the 2 Feb application for the revision of the same judgment. The application invokes Article 60 of the Statute of the Court and Article 98 of the Rules of the Court. According to Malaysian Attorney-General Mohamed Apandi Ali, Malaysia and Singapore set up a Joint Technical Committee (JTC) for the implementation of the 2008 ICJ judgment. According to Malaysia, the JTC reached an impasse in November 2013, as both parties had been unable to agree over the meaning of the 2008 judgement as it concerns the South Ledge and the waters surrounding Pedra Branca. Explaining Malaysia&#x27;s position, Malaysian Attorney-General Apandi said: &quot;Malaysia considers that it is necessary to request an interpretation of the 2008 judgement from the ICJ as it would serve as a basis for the maintenance of orderly and peaceful relations between the parties in the management of their respective maritime zones and airspace in the future&quot;.

Singapore&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) noted in a press statement that ICJ&#x27;s judgement was &quot;final and without appeal&quot;, as well as &quot;clear and unambiguous&quot;. As a result, MFA said: &quot;Malaysia&#x27;s request for the ICJ to interpret the judgement is puzzling. Singapore will therefore oppose Malaysia&#x27;s application for interpretation, which we consider to be both unnecessary and without merit&quot;.

On 28 May 2018, the Malaysian government withdrew both its applications for revision and interpretation of the 2008 judgment, a move which was welcomed by Singapore&#x27;s MFA, thereby discontinuing both cases before ICJ. Furthermore, the Statute of the International Court of Justice only allows an application for revision to be made within 10 years after the 23 May 2008 judgement, which means further applications for revision are no longer possible. On 25 June 2019, Malaysia&#x27;s Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad reiterated Malaysia&#x27;s acceptance of the ruling, citing it as an example of how ASEAN member states have worked together based on mutual respect.

<text>Bibracte, a Gallic &quot;oppidum&quot; (fortified settlement), was the capital of the Aedui and one of the most important hillforts in Gaul. It was located near modern Autun in Burgundy, France. The material culture of the Aedui corresponded to the Late Iron Age La Tène culture.

In 58 BC, at the Battle of Bibracte, Julius Caesar&#x27;s armies defeated the Helvetii 16 miles south of the fort. In 52 BC, Vercingetorix was proclaimed head of the Gaulish coalition at Bibracte. A few decades after the Roman conquest of Gaul, Bibracte was abandoned in favour of Autun, 25 kilometres away. Once abandoned, Bibracte remained undisturbed and unexamined until discovered by modern archaeology.

Jacques-Gabriel Bulliot initiated the first excavations at the site between 1867 and 1895. His nephew Joseph Déchelette, author of a famous &quot;Manuel d&#x27;Archéologie&quot;, continued the excavations between 1897 and 1907.

The modern site, known as Mont Beuvray, is generally identified as ancient Bibracte. The site straddles the borders of the French départements of Nièvre and Saône-et-Loire in Burgundy. The site is an archaeological park at the centre of a protected forest. It is the focus of cooperative European archaeological efforts, a training ground for young archaeologists, and a centre for interpreting Gaulish culture for a popular audience. Important international excavations have been undertaken at Mont Beuvray by teams from the universities of Sheffield, Kiel, Budapest, Vienna and Leipzig.

On 12 December 2007 the site of Bibracte received the &quot;Great Site of France&quot; designation.

Before the Roman conquest in 52 BC the great Celtic city of Bibracte had more than thirty thousand inhabitants, protected by a huge stone wall of the Murus Gallicus type which enclosed an area of 135 hectares.

== Etymology ==

The origin of the word &quot;Bibracte&quot; is still poorly understood. The term may have come from the Celtic &quot;*bibro- / *bebro-&quot; (beaver) followed by the collective suffix &quot;-akti&quot; (cf. Irish, Gallic &quot;aktā&quot;) or from the Latin &quot;biffractrus&quot; (twice fortified). The latter version, however, is thought questionable from a strategic view, since it is very difficult to protect a battlement over a long distance, a problem which a double battlement would only have exacerbated. Moreover, the stone facing of the outer surrounding wall was reused for the construction of the second wall, meaning it is unlikely that Bibracte was surrounded by two walls at the same time.

Three inscriptions dedicated to the goddess &quot;Bibracte&quot; which were found at Autun in the 17th century provide another explanation for the name, but two of the inscriptions carved into the stone have disappeared and the authenticity of the third, engraved on a brass medallion, has been the object of debate. Some scholars of the era have cited other evidence to justify placing the Aeduian oppidum on the site of Autun (the former Augustodunum), which was effectively the capital of the Aedui in the first century.

== Discovery of Bibracte ==
Bibracte is mentioned only twice in Roman sources. The first mention is found in Julius Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic War&quot; in the year 58 BC. It was mentioned again in 52 BCE, when he was questioning the intentions of his Aedui allies, who had joined the revolt and crowned Vercingetorix king of the Gauls at Bibracte. Inscriptions from the era announced that the capital of the Aedui received the name (&quot;the citadel of Augustus&quot;) during the reign of Augustus, which gave rise to the current Autun.

Starting in the 16th century, a passion for local history arose among scholars, aristocrats, and clergy, which led to the question of the location of Bibracte. One theory placed Bibracte at Autun: the Gallic city at the site of the Gallo-Roman city. Another placed it at Beaune and was defended by the scholar . A third located the city on the slopes of Beuvrect or Bevrect, today known as Mont Beuvray. This last theory was based on three major arguments. First, there is a connection between the names Bibracte and Beuvrect. Second, medieval chronicles situated the city at Beuvrect. This was reinforced by the existence of an annual fair on the first Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of May, the age of which is attested to in texts from the 13th century. Finally, the discovery of pottery, coins, and the in 1725 supported it.

Generally, the Autun hypothesis received the greatest approval at first. Moreover, Autun was renamed Bibracte after the French Revolution and remained so for some time. Only the research of in the 19th century shifted scholarly opinion in favor of Mont Beuvray. In 1851, Bulliot communicated with the Congress of the French Society of Archeology about an ancient chapel (the Saint Martin chapel on Mont Beuvray) established to Christianize the Aedui. He also returned to Mont Beuvray to take more notes. He discovered what he thought was the embankment of a Roman camp (actually a nemeton) at the summit of Mont Beuvray next to the chapel. He documented it and considered placing Bibracte at Mont Beuvray instead of Autun, contrary to the unanimous opinion of the Aedui Society. The publication of his &quot;Essay on the Roman System of Defense in the Aedui country between the Saône and the Loire&quot;, in which he revealed his convictions, was not taken seriously by the members of the Society of Archeology.

Emperor Napoleon III took an interest in the battles of the Gallic Wars and an officer named Stoffel, charged by the Emperor with conducting investigations of the Roman victory over the Helvetii, visited Bulliot, who shared with him his opinions about the location of Bibracte. Stoffel was not interested, but he commissioned Xavier Garenne, another member of the Aedui Society, to make a survey of Mont Beavray. At the same time, the Viscount of Aboville, the owner of the land, conducted research and shared it with the Archbishop of Reims, who was a member of the Aedui Society and a friend of Bulliot, though he did not share Bulliot&#x27;s theory about the location of Bibracte. Interested by these investigations, the Archbishop shared the various findings with the Emperor who, in 1867, assigned Bulliot to do research at Mont Beavray and funded his work.

Bulliot excavated the site from 1867 to 1905, removing all doubt about the location of Bibracte. His nephew Joseph Déchelette, whom he introduced to excavation, continued the work until 1907, comparing Bibracte to other sites in Europe such as Stradonice in Bohemia, the Manching in Germany and Velem-Zenst-Vid in Hungary, which were precursors of the cultural unification of the Celtic world and of the civilization of oppida.

== History of the oppidum ==
=== Chronology of the population of Beuvray ===
During the excavations of the gate, five artifacts were discovered, the oldest of which demonstrated human habitation on Mont Beuvray in the Neolithic Era. Dating techniques have shown that the oppidum was founded at end of the 3rd century BCE, on an area of 200 hectares protected by the exterior rampart. An interior rampart was built later, for reasons unknown.

Because the Aedui had the status of &quot;friend of the Roman people,&quot; contacts with Roman merchants were probable before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar. This privileged status prevented Bibracte from suffering much from conflict: in 58 BCE, at Montmort 25 kilometers south of the site, Julius Caesar&#x27;s armies defeated the Helvetii, forcing them to return to Switzerland and gradually be incorporated into what became the Roman Empire. In 52 BCE, an assembly of Gallic peoples at Bibracte gave Vercingetorix supreme command of the Gallic armies. Despite this insurrection, Caesar treated the city mercifully after his victory at Alesia. He stayed there during the winter of 52-51 BCE to write his &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic War&quot;. These mentioned the names of certain notables of the Aedui aristocracy such as Dumnorix, vergobret of the Aedui, and his brother Diviciacus, the druid. The city&#x27;s industry boomed in the decades following the war.

Strabo the geographer, writing a generation later than Caesar, identified Bibracte as again an Aedui stronghold.

After the founding of Autun (Augustodunum) 25 kilometers away c. 15 BCE, during the reign of Augustus, Bibracte was gradually abandoned by its inhabitants. However, cults continued to practise their rites in its temples and its fountains and its aristocratic residences were maintained. Two main hypotheses have been advanced concerning the abandonment of the site over several decades. Migration could have been caused by economic reasons or by a desire to integrate with the Roman model; a part of the dominant Aedui class, already pro-Roman during the Gallic War, definitely realized the strategic importance of the new city located on the principal axes of communication and wanted to conform to the Roman model of flatland cities, while a more traditional population remained for a time on the Bibracte site.

It is known from 13th century texts that a festival every first Monday of May survived. In the 15th and 16th centuries, a Franciscan convent was established on Mont Beuvray. It was abandoned, but the festival continued.

=== Influence and power ===

The power of the Aedui capital was related in the &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic War&quot;, which underlined the many alliances held by the Aedui with neighboring peoples. Julius Caesar also mentioned the wars that set the Aedui against the Arverni and the Sequani for hegemony over a large part of Gaul. These references were not impartial, since Rome had been allied with the Aedui, &quot;our blood brothers&quot;, since at least the 2nd century BCE. Moreover, they maintained commercial links and military alliances: Rome helped the Aedui in the 2nd century to defeat an Arverni army and rose to their defense against the invasion of the Helvetii that precipitated the Gallic War.

Gabriel de Mortillet, in his classification of ancient peoples, included the site&#x27;s residents under the name &quot;Beavraisian&quot;, a category abandoned by modern scholars.

In addition to this powerful alliance with Rome, the Aedui were part of a confederation of Celtic tribes that included:
*The Ambarri (in Ain)
*The Brannovices
*The Bellovaci
*The Bituriges (in Berry)
*The Parisii
*The Segusiavi (Forez, adjacent to the Arverni)
*The Senones (Sens region)
Whose influence extended across a large part of Gaul.

==== Commerce ====
In his &quot;History of Gaul&quot;, the historian Camille Jullian writes these lines about the Aedui: &quot;Bibracte, I am sure, was the source and the guarantee of their power. Around Bibracte were very good roads, uniting the three biggest basins of France.&quot;

So, the Roman products traveling up the Rhône (the waterways were the fastest means of travel at the time) and taking after that the Saône, the Loire or the Allier, passed through Aedui territory before joining the basins of the Loire and Seine. The Aedui were located at a commercial crossroads between the Celtic world and Rome. They allowed the diffusion of Roman products through Gaul as early as the 2nd century BCE, allowing their allies to benefit from their commerce with Rome and definitely with Greek colonies such as Massilia. These exchanges are confirmed by the large quantities of amphoras and ceramics from Italy found in waste tanks and in the paving of houses.

In addition, the Aedui installed a system of customs that taxed products passing through their territory to increase their wealth, as attested in the texts of Julius Caesar: &quot;It was typical of Dumnorix: the man was audacious, his generosity made him popular, and he wanted political change. For years, he has had the control of the customs and all the other taxes of the Aedui, because when he bid, no one dared bid against him.&quot; The Aedui and the Sequani fought each other to control the Arar (now the Saône) because controlling the river allowed taxation of Roman and Celtic products traveling north.

In the centre of the oppidum many cellars and certain public buildings that stored large quantities of cereals and wine imported from the southern countries have been found. One of these wooden cellars has recently been reconstructed. Without a doubt, it was in these buildings that the Aedui centralized their harvests and imports.

==== Politics ====

The political system of the Aedui was essentially structured according to indications in the &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic War&quot;. At the head of the Aedui state sat a senate comprising one member of each Aedui aristocratic family. What is today called &quot;executive power&quot; was held by the vergobret, the supreme magistrate, who exercised his functions over the course of a year. He was forbidden from leaving the borders of the territory during this period, which prevented him from commanding the army outside the borders. This measure, along with that which authorized only one voice per aristocratic family in the senate, aimed to prevent any individual or their family from monopolizing the reins of power. The vergobret was publicly elected by a council directed by the druids. Among the Aedui, it seems like the vergobret also exercised a judiciary role, since Caesar reports that he had &quot;the right to life and death over his fellow citizens&quot;. Finally, it is thought that the vergobret was responsible for the administration of the territory. 

Furthermore, it is known that the druids held high functions since Diviciacus came to Rome to plead the case of the Aedui during the Germanic invasion led by Ariovistus on the account of the Sequani; he also directed the Aedui cavalry during the Gallic War after the death of his brother Dumnorix. Therefore, it is thought that some druids held high military positions.

== Archeological research on Mont Beuvray ==
From 1865 to 1895, Gabriel Bulliot identified Bibracte in 1867 and began excavations there (notably the Celtic artisanal neighborhood surrounding the Rebout gate), with the aid of funds allocated by Napoleon III. In fact, having a passion for history, the emperor set off vast campaigns of excavations to uncover sites of the Gallic War in order to write his &quot;History of Julius Caesar&quot;. Joseph Déchelette, the nephew of Bulliot, took up his work again from 1895 to 1907. He was killed during World War I and the excavations fell into neglect. In 1984, the excavations began again under the impetus of François Mitterrand, who proclaimed Bibracte a site of national interest in 1985. This term, invented for the occasion, allowed the site to be subsidized. The label of &quot;national interest&quot; was created afterward in order to designate exhibitions or sites which benefit from a program of diffusion and enlargement of the public by the Minister of Culture. This gives the necessary impetus to a project of excavations of European scope. Thus, in 1989, the European Archeological Center of Mont Beuvray was created, which includes the site, the museum, and the research center of Glux-en-Glenne. It was inaugurated in 1995. The excavations were conducted by Vincent Guichard and put into practice by many French and foreign teams; the excavations notably concentrated on the Gallic neighborhood of Rebout, on the vast Gallo-Roman ensemble of the Pasture of the Convent and the Roman residence of the Horse Park.

Specialists, researchers, professors and students from all over Europe come together on the site every summer to excavate different parts of the site. These have included, among others:
*Austria: University of Vienna
*Belgium: Université Libre de Bruxelles
*Czech Republic: Masaryk University
*France: University of Franche-Comté, University of Burgundy, University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne, Pierre and Marie Curie University, François Rabelais University
*Germany: University of Kiel, University of Leipzig, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, University of Mainz
*Hungary: Eötvös Loránd University
*Italy: University of Bologna
*Poland: Rzeszów University
*Slovenia: University of Ljubljana
*Spain: University of Madrid and University of Zaragoza
*Switzerland: University of Lausanne
*United Kingdom: University of Edinburgh
Each university excavates the site as part of tri-annual projects consisting of several weeks of work on the terrain followed by a detailed study of the excavation and of the objects discovered, which are then stored at the site&#x27;s research center.

=== Archeological prospecting on Mont Beuvray ===
The early prospecting technique used by Bulliot was rudimentary. It consisted of observing the irregularities in the landscape, since the mountain was practically unchanged since the period under study. This allowed him to recreate a plan of the battlements with nearly no excavation. He used this technique to make a scale plan with the help of army topographers, who made a series of topographical recreations of the landscape. However, only the recreation of the Porrey neighborhood still exists to this day.

In recent years, the same technique has been used in the Porrey neighborhood with more precise tools, such as theodolites and GPS. Aerial and electromagnetic prospecting is made impossible by the forest and vegetation on the mountain since the end of grazing and the excavations of Joseph Déchelette, as well as the nature of the subsoil. One costly but faster technique, tested in 2007, is LIDAR, the use of airborne laser scanners, which are unhindered by the vegetation and can recreate in minutes what usually takes weeks to do on the ground. This will be done in order to attempt to make a complete map of the city and to archive the topography of the location.

== Organization ==
The research done by Bulliot and Déchelette at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century recreated an organization of the site into neighborhoods, with construction mostly following a central road from the Gate of Rebout to the Great Gates. This organization differs from that of oppida like Manching, where there is a regular urban framework; this is explained by the relief of the terrain, as the battlements encircle three summits with some relatively steep slopes.

Since 1984, the excavations have seemed to confirm Déchelette&#x27;s and Bulliot&#x27;s hypotheses in broad terms, while nevertheless contributing certain nuances.

=== Battlements ===
Bibracte was protected by strong Murus Gallicus style battlements, which excavations have been able to reconstruct. The city had a progression of two different surrounding walls and at least five restorations of the inner surrounding wall, revealed, among other things, by the study of the Rebout gate. Surprisingly, the inner encircling wall was constructed after the outer wall. The city, therefore, shrank in area from 200 to 135 hectares (494 to 334 acres).

The internal wall, discovered by Bulliot, is a Murus Gallicus that delimits an area of 135 hectares for a length of per battlement. It is estimated that construction of the wall required more than 10,000 cubic meters of wood, between 10,000 and 20,000 cubic meters of earth and about thirty tons of iron.

The outer wall encircles an area of 200 hectares and was the subject of research beginning in 1992 for initial probing. This archeological research revealed that the battlement originally had a height between four and five meters (13 and 16 feet) without its yet-unknown top (e.g., palisades or towers) and an identical depth, and was preceded by a ditch between deep and between wide. A study was conducted between 1995 and 2002 with many probes along with those by the University of Vienna. The researchers were able to ascertain that this battlement was a Murus Gallicus that had been dismantled in order to construct the inner wall. The dating, however, remains imprecise, and places this event during the 2nd century.

The battlement is punctuated by about fifteen gates, including the famous Gate of Rebout (20 meters (66 feet) in width and 40 meters (131 feet) in depth). The gate of Rebout was the first location excavated by Bulliot, where he worked for nine weeks, and was the first site for new excavations from 1984 to 1986 which also studied the ditches adjoining the battlements. These excavations revealed five levels of different restorations, including a palisade from the Neolithic Era (dated with carbon-14). The latter has been the object of a reconstruction since 1996 which currently marks the entry into the old oppidum. At the present time, research has not been able to detect a trace of a method for locking the gate or a defensive device for it. Some hypotheses have advanced the idea of a double gate surmounted by a wooden guard tower like that of the Manching oppidum, but nothing has yet confirmed this.

The recent research on the battlements, since 2005, has concentrated on a line of fortification downhill from the Gate of Rebout. Dating seems to indicate that this construction took place after that of the gate and therefore constituted an advance fortification. At the same time, some aristocratic tombs have been discovered between the two lines of battlements.

=== Public buildings ===
Excavations conducted between 2012 and 2017 uncovered the remains of a large monumental public building dating to the La Tène period, c. 70 BC. In the first phase of construction (c. 70 BC) a terrace was built, surrounded by a &quot;murus gallicus&quot; stone wall with a large entrance on the east side. On the terrace a 44-metre-long square building was constructed out of wood, with galleries surrounding a central courtyard. Around 30 BC a monumental building was erected in the central space and the galleries were replaced with a palisade. In c. 15 BC the previous building was levelled and a vast platform was built which was surrounded by stone walls. In the centre the space was possibly occupied by a new central building. Next to this another platform was built, also surrounded by a stone wall, with an internal gallery built from wood. These constructions have been compared to other known public buildings and temples from the La Tène period, though the precise purpose of the buildings at Bibracte is yet to be determined. According to Hantrais et al. (2020) &quot;The characteristics of this monumental construction indicate that it was certainly a public building with original architectural features and techniques. Yet, although this monumental building is very well documented archaeologically, its exact function remains enigmatic.&quot;

=== Artisans&#x27; neighborhoods of Côme Chaudron and Champlain ===

Excavations in the neighborhoods known as the Côme Cauldron and the Champlain, near the Rebout Gate, have revealed a neighborhood dedicated to metalwork and to artisans&#x27; lodging. This metalworking seems to have been very specialized, incorporating blacksmiths, bronzeworkers, and enamellers, whose workshops had already been restored by Bulliot, and probably also involved goldsmiths and minters.

Excavations on the site of Beuvray, in the region of the Champlain, and on the surrounding massifs revealed the existence of mines for the extraction of metals, including gold, iron, and tin ore. This research will continue and will attempt to restore the workshops for the smelting of the metals extracted outside the oppidum. In fact, given the specialization of the workshops in Bibracte, it seems that the metals arrived in bars which were therefore cast outside the oppidum.

Another artisanal neighborhood has been found in the region of one of the summits of the site, at the Rock of the Wyvern, an area which had been little investigated at the time of Bulliot and Déchelette&#x27;s research. This neighborhood will be the object of future excavations which will attempt to determine the function of the neighborhood.

=== Housing ===

Predominantly made of wood and earth, the Gallic houses used stone only sparingly, which was saved for the ramparts. Little is known of the houses&#x27; structure as wood rots and decomposes. There are, however, stone constructions in the horse Park district, probably aristocratic residences and a public building with columns, near the convent&#x27;s pasture. These were probably constructed soon after the Gallic Wars.

=== Horse Park ===
At the center of Mont Beuvray, the plateau known as the Horse Park holds several Roman-style stone houses which were excavated in the 19th century. The houses include, in particular, the residence PC1 (so named by Bulliot), which is a veritable gold mine for the researchers. In fact, it developed from a wood construction (of Roman inspiration) into a domus with an atrium containing an impluvium, porticos, and thermae heated by hypocaust, along with a system of sewers. In its final stage, the residence measured 55 by 67 meters, covering an area of around 3500 square meters, about four times the size of the domus found on the site of Pompeii. It is estimated that there were about fifteen domus&#x27; in this area, such as PC2, a smaller residence that faces PC1 on the other side of the central road. There are also homes of the villa rustica type (the Italian rural residences) like PC33. However, it is still not known whether this was a residential neighborhood reserved for only the elite, since excavations have also revealed the presence of forges near the domus.

=== Monumental basin ===

At the centre of the main road, in the area of the Pasture of the Monastery, stands a pink granite monumental basin which is thought to have had a sacred function. It could possibly represent a sacred point of the city&#x27;s founding, or a water shrine. Water left the basin through the northern opening downstream, continuing through a pipe. The supply of water, however, has not yet been discovered. The basin was waterproofed with a coat of red clay, precluding a feed from a spring, and no supply pipe has been found. The manner of granite carving is unusual and shows Mediterranean influences. It has similarities to later Gallo-Roman stone basins and could be considered the oldest known example of this type. 

The design of the basin has an astronomical and mathematical significance: 

1) The minor axis of the basin is aligned with the winter solstice sunrise and summer solstice sunset. 

2) The basin has a geometric design based on two circles intersecting at 1/5 of their diameter, forming a precise 3:4:5 Pythagorean triangle between the centre of the circles, the centre of the basin and the end of the basin. 

3) The basin has a length/breadth/height ratio of 3/1/0.5, equivalent to 36/12/6 units with a value of 30.4cm. A similar unit of measurement has been identified at the oppidum of Manching in Germany and described as a &#x27;Celtic foot&#x27;. 

Based on these characteristics, it has been suggested that the basin represents a druidic monument.

Maumené (2018) suggests that the main axis of the basin is orientated towards a celestial alignment with the constellation of Gemini, reflecting the religious importance of the Dioscuri (Divine Twins) in the Gallic pantheon. The boat-like shape of the basin might be related to the mythology of the solar boat, which is also associated with the Divine Twins.

Almagro-Gorbea (2017) suggests that the Bibracte basin &quot;seems to be correlated to the druid Diviciacus, an expert in the philosophy of nature&quot;, in reference to Cicero&#x27;s statement that “there are indeed Druids in Gaul — for I knew one of them myself, Divitiacus, the Aeduan ... He claimed to have that knowledge of nature which the Greeks call &quot;&#x27;physiologia&#x27;&quot;.&quot; 

Various classical authors referred to the druids as philosophers, who possessed a knowledge of astronomy and adhered to Pythagorean beliefs and practices. Hippolytus of Rome stated that the druids &quot;investigated to the very highest point the Pythagorean philosophy&quot; and foretold certain events &quot;from calculations and numbers by the Pythagorean art&quot;. 

Some modern authors have suggested that Bibracte was the site of a druidic school, as described by Julius Caesar in the &quot;Gallic War:&quot;

The later Aeduan capital of was the location of the Menian schools, which were dedicated to the study of liberal arts and law. The schools are mentioned by Tacitus in his account of the Revolt of Sacrovir:

=== Places of worship ===
The oppidum of Bibracte has about ten springs and five fountains dating from the Gallic or Gallo-Roman periods. The Saint Pierre Fountain was a place of worship and pilgrimage, in which coins and votive offerings were found. At the summit of the mountain, a Celtic place of worship (nemeton) a hectare large has been exhumed, surrounded by a palisade and concentric ditches. Under the current chapel from the 19th century, the 1988 excavations discovered a Gallo-Roman temple. 

=== Necropolis ===
Located below the present-day museum parking lot, the necropolis underwent archaeological excavations, with the aim of saving it, when the museum was created and the &quot;route départementale&quot; was diverted. Over a surface area of 1.5 hectares, 70 funeral enclosures, used following incineration, were found, each having an eastern entry. The crematorium was found further south. Other funerary urns were discovered at the foot of the Rebout Gate, possibly the remains of a local aristocratic family. More cemeteries are presumably situated on the former site access paths, as was often the case at the time, but have not yet been excavated.

=== Basilica ===
In the area of the Convent Pasture the excavations revealed, under a large domus of the Augustan era, the presence of an exceptional public monument, which was at the time unique in Gaul: a Roman basilica with three naves and an internal peristyle with a peripheral ambulatory, displaying four rows of eight columns or eight pilasters. It was connected on the east with a small square, 22 meters on a side, bordered to the north and south with porticos which were extensions of the walls of the annexes of the basilica. On the west it was connected to the main road of Bibracte with another square, 17 meters on the side. Some architectural elements have been found that attest the presence of limestone columns with Attic bases and Doric and Corinthian capitals. These elements formed a monumental urban project of the greatest importance. These public buildings date to the period between 50 and 40 BCE and between 35 and 25 BCE. At this date, the basilica and the square were carefully leveled and replaced by a large private residence, doubtless in connection with the move of the Aedui capital to Autun. The basilica of Bibracte confirms the exceptional importance of the site and revealed that the Romanization of the Aedui was considerably more rapid than previously believed. The basilica of Bibracte is currently the oldest representation of Roman monumental stone architecture in non-Mediterranean Europe.

== A window to the Celtic world ==

=== Museum of Celtic Civilization ===

The site hosts the Museum of Celtic Civilization, designed by and opened to the public in 1996. Pierre-Louis Faloci is also the architect of Bibracte&#x27;s Center of European Archeological Research, which was opened in 1994. The architectural design corresponds to the evolution of the ages of humanities: it has a base of carved stone, walls of polished stone, and a metal roof. One of the facades, which are large picture windows, is hidden by a wall of stone (on the valley side), while that which faces the site allows free view to the visitors. The museum has few proper collections, as many of those exhibited are loaned from other museums. The Coligny calendar and the Gundestrup cauldron have both been exhibited there.

==== Permanent exhibits ====

The 2000 square meters of the exhibit in the museum are laid out over two stages. The first stage (and the first in the tour) recounts the discovery of the site and the place of Bibracte in the global context of the European Celtic culture. The majority of the following subjects are covered: war, the age of the oppida, Mediterranean commerce, and agriculture. The ground floor, which consists of several alcoves, recounts the life of the Aedui at Bibracte. Objects of daily life, jewelry, funereal urns, and artisanal workshops are reconstructed or exhibited there.

==== Temporary exhibits ====

Several summer exhibits have been featured at the museum, each addressing a precise subject of the Celtic world:
* 1995: Celtic Europe at the time of Bibracte
* 1996: History seen from above
* 1997: A look at the Celts in Slovenia
* 1998: At the border of East and West
* 1999: The tombs of the last Celtic aristocrats
* 2000: The Gallic druids
* 2001: The time of the Gauls in the provinces
* 2002: On Caesar&#x27;s trail
* 2003: Blacksmiths and metal merchants
* 2004: The white gold of Hallstatt
* 2005: Wine, the nectar of the Gods
* 2006: The treasures of women
* 2007: A round trip between Bibracte and Kathmandu
* 2008: Situlae, images of a vanished world
* 2009: La Tène
* 2010: The Gauls do the head

=== Research center ===
Located four kilometers from Mont Beuvray, in the commune of Glux-en-Glenne (Nièvre), is one of the most important libraries on the Celtic world. There is also an archeological depot there, the administration of the archeological park, several technical establishments, a lecture hall, and, in the village, a dining hall and several gîtes. In this center, archeologists, students, and researchers congregate from all over Europe to excavate the site of Bibracte. The research center also accommodates the regional center for preservation of relics and archeological collections, becoming the reference center of Burgundy in this field.

The show features the adventures of the adolescent members of the crew of the &quot;Star Runner,&quot; an interstellar spaceship carrying a cargo of 550 cryonically suspended colonists (&quot;&quot;) to their new home, the Silver Sun.

In the year 2052, the &quot;Star Runner&quot; and its crew are two years into their 90-year journey to a livable planet 45 light years from Earth. The crew&#x27;s goal is to get the &quot;New Settlers&quot; safely to the Silver Sun and begin a colony there. Because of the 90-year-length of the journey, the crew are mostly teenagers who will take over command of the &quot;Star Runner&quot; as the adults get older.

==Production==
The ABC began showing &quot;Silversun&quot; on 11 October 2004 at 5:00 pm daily as part of its children&#x27;s lineup. The final episode was broadcast on 3 December 2004. Forty episodes of the program were produced, each at twenty-two minutes. The program was originally aired on the Seven Network in two groups of twenty episodes, and then shown again without a mid-way break on the ABC.

&quot;Silversun&quot; was re-run on Sunday mornings beginning 3 April 2005, until 1 January 2006. It was rerun again in 2009 each weekday at 5:00 pm, finishing on 17 September 2009. The ABC has no plans to create a second season of the program.

Many episodes revolved around the relationships and issues experienced by the young crew as part of adolescence. Some episodes dealt with issues of ethics and choices unique to science fiction, such as the question of whether the commander&#x27;s clone should be treated as human or not, the unique human problems encountered by a crew on a lifelong voyage to the stars, and an encounter with a pulsar whose pulse cycle is in phase with the brainwaves of the crewmember Pancha, to her detriment.

Although some first-season episodes are self-contained, the majority deal with multi-episode plot conflicts occurring on board the &quot;Star Runner&quot;. These included the illegal re-animation of the character Zandie by the rogue crewmember Degenhardt in the earlier episodes, the crew&#x27;s encounter with a wormhole, the infection of Commander Cyriax by an alien parasite, his subsequent cure through the use of a harvest clone of him discovered in suspension among the settler pods, and the clone&#x27;s accidental awakening to full consciousness. The final episode ended in a cliffhanger.

<text>Frederick Victor Branford (1892–1941) was a Scottish poet, known for verse of World War I and the years after.

== Biography ==
Born Frederick Victor Rubens Branford Powell, the son of actors Mary Branford and Joynson Powell, he was given the second name of Mary&#x27;s brother Victor Branford and was known in the family as &#x27;Freddie&#x27; Powell. After the death of his mother he was brought up by his aunt Dorothy and after her separation from Lionel Branford, they lived in Ardgay, Scotland. (Alasdair Alpin MacGregor&#x27;s &quot;The Goat Wife&quot; tells the evocative story of his hard working and resourceful Aunt Dorothy, who left a comfortable existence in Edinburgh for life as a solo crofter in the Easter Ross village of Ardgay (then known locally as &quot;High Wind&quot;). Branford appears in the book as &quot;Victor&quot;.) He may have felt closer to the Branfords than to his father and published his poetry under the surname of Branford.

He was educated at Edinburgh University and Leiden University. Serving as a captain in the Royal Naval Air Service during World War I, Branford was very badly wounded at the Battle of the Somme, when he was shot down over the Belgian coast and swam ashore to the Netherlands, where he was interned. Most of his poems were written in a long period of recovery from his injuries, which left him totally disabled. He lived on a disability pension for the rest of his life.

Branford stopped writing poetry in 1923, disillusioned with the prospects for future peace. He remarried in 1937, his second wife was his cousin Margaret Branford, the playwright daughter of John Branford.

<doc id="1060347" wikidata="Q62949" url="?curid=1060347" title="Karl Leisner">
<text>Karl Leisner (28 February 1915 in Rees – 12 August 1945 in Planegg, Germany) was a Roman Catholic priest interned in the Dachau concentration camp. He died of tuberculosis shortly after being liberated by the Allied forces. He has been declared a martyr and was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 23 June 1996.

==Life==
Leisner was born on 28 February 1915, the oldest of five children. When he was six years old, the family moved to Kleve, a city on the lower Rhine, where his father worked as a civil servant. He attended school and completed his gymnasium studies in 1934. During his youth, he became an altar boy and, at the suggestion of the high school chaplain, formed a Catholic youth group, the Saint Werner Group. These youth groups combined prayer with outdoor activities, such as camping and cycling. Leisner turned out to be a natural leader and became a youth leader in the 1930s, during the era in which the Nazis were beginning to take control of all youth organizations. In order to avoid Nazi interference, Leisner would often take his group on camping trips to Holland or Belgium.

In 1934, when he was nineteen, Leisner entered the seminary in Munich, and was named Diocesan Youth Leader by Clemens August von Galen, Bishop of Münster. He spent six months in compulsory agricultural work during which, despite Nazi opposition, he organized Sunday Mass for his fellow workers. In 1937, his parents&#x27; house was raided by the Gestapo, who seized his diaries and papers. These meticulously preserved documents tell how the spiritual young man became a religious leader.

On 25 March 1939, Galen ordained Leisner a deacon. Shortly after his ordination, during a medical examination, the doctor told the new deacon that he had contracted tuberculosis. In those days, the sole treatment available for the disease was good food and fresh air. These were to be found at a sanitorium in St. Blasien, in the Black Forest, where he was sent and began to recover. It was during his recovery that a fellow patient heard him criticize Adolf Hitler. The Gestapo arrested him as a political prisoner on 9 November 1939, when he was twenty-five. He was interned first in Freiburg and later in Mannheim. Leisner was initially imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, but was moved to the Dachau concentration camp on 14 December 1940, where he became prisoner No. 22,356. Since he was a deacon, Leisner was assigned to the priests&#x27; block.

Prisoners often had to work outside in snow or rain and then had to sleep in their wet prison clothes. Cold weather, poor rations and harsh treatment proved a dangerous combination for someone already suffering tuberculosis. Such conditions
caused Leisner&#x27;s condition to become active. Then, during an inspection, two Gestapo guards beat him unconscious and he spent several hours on the floor of his hut. By March 1942, he was spitting blood and was forced to report to the infirmary where medical experiments were known to be performed. He was put in a room that was crowded with over 100 tuberculosis patients. In Dachau, there was never any attempt to cure a disease and very little care was given to the sick. During inspections of the infirmary, any patient
thought to be incurable was executed. Only the help of fellow prisoners prevented Leisner from being included in the &quot;invalids&#x27; transport&quot; to the Hartheim extermination clinic.

On 17 December 1944, Gaudete Sunday, a fellow prisoner, French Bishop Gabriel Piguet, secretly ordained him a priest. The necessary paperwork with the authorization for the ordination, as well as other necessary items, were smuggled into the camp by &quot;Mädi&quot;, the &quot;Angel of Dachau&quot;, a young woman named Josefa Mack. (Mack went on to become a School Sister of Notre Dame in Munich, called Sister Maria Imma.) Some imprisoned Protestant pastors helped organize the event and a Jewish violinist played music near the barracks to create a diversion.

The newly ordained priest only celebrated a single Mass and was so ill that he had to postpone his first Mass for over a week. When Dachau was liberated on 4 May 1945, Leisner was taken to a sanatarium in Planegg, near Munich. He died there a few months later, on 12 August 1945.

Leisner&#x27;s body was taken to Kleve and buried in a local cemetery on 20 August 1945. His remains were exhumed and re-interred in the crypt of the Cathedral of Xanten in 1966.

==Beatification==
On a visit to Berlin in 1996, Pope John Paul II recognized Leisner as a martyr for the Catholic faith and beatified him, together with Bernhard Lichtenberg, another Nazi resister. His feast day is 12 August.

==Media==
Some works have been published in English about Leisner. One is &quot;The Victory of Father Karl&quot; by Otto Pies, published in 1957. It was a translation of &quot;Stephanus heute; Karl Leisner, Priester und Opfer&quot;. A radio drama adaptation was produced for &quot;The Hour of St. Francis&quot; with the same title. A half-hour docudrama on videotape was released by the Daughters of St. Paul in 1984, also with the same title.

==Leisner and Schoenstatt==

Karl Leisner got to know the Schoenstatt movement as a teenager and belonged to a Schoenstatt group - which included the future Bishop of Münster, Heinrich Tenhumberg - up till his final days. Throughout his life, the few but intense times of personal encounter with Our Lady in the Original Shrine in Schoenstatt remained the decisive milestones for Karl Leisner on his path of calling. &quot;Christ, my passion&quot; - led by this ideal, he worked in the diocesan youth and wrestled his way to a decision for a celibate life as a priest. In the Dachau concentration camp he founded, together with Josef Fischer, the first Schoenstatt group in Dachau, which had to end its meetings in the 1942 starvation year. From 1943 Karl Leisner belonged to the group &quot;Victor in vinculis Mariae&quot; (victor in the shackles of Mary) and thus to the circle of Schoenstaetters around the founder Josef Kentenich. From the ideal and the fraternity of this group, Karl Leisner drew the strength to accept his fate, which was burdened by the tuberculosis of the lung as well as the difficult conditions in the concentration camp, as the will of God and to offer his life as a martyr.

<doc id="1060349" wikidata="Q5275374" url="?curid=1060349" title="Differential wheeled robot">
<text>A differential wheeled robot is a mobile robot whose movement is based on two separately driven wheels placed on either side of the robot body. It can thus change its direction by varying the relative rate of rotation of its wheels and hence does not require an additional steering motion. Robots with such a drive typically have one or more caster wheels to prevent the vehicle from tilting.

==Details==
If both the wheels are driven in the same direction and speed, the robot will go in a straight line. If both wheels are turned with equal speed in opposite directions, as is clear from the diagram shown, the robot will rotate about the central point of the axis. Otherwise, depending on the speed of rotation and its direction, the center of rotation may fall anywhere on the line defined by the two contact points of the tires. While the robot is traveling in a straight line, the center of rotation is an infinite distance from the robot. Since the direction of the robot is dependent on the rate and direction of rotation of the two driven wheels, these quantities should be sensed and controlled precisely.

A differentially steered robot is similar to the differential gears used in automobiles in that both the wheels can have different rates of rotations, but unlike the differential gearing system, a differentially steered system will have both the wheels powered. Differential wheeled robots are used extensively in robotics, since their motion is easy to program and can be well controlled. Virtually all consumer robots on the market today use differential steering primarily for its low cost and simplicity. 

== Kinematics of Differential Drive Robots ==

The illustration on the right shows the differential drive kinematics of a mobile wheeled robot. The variables are expressed using the following notation: formula_1 and formula_2 are the global coordinate system. Using the point midway between the wheels as the origin of the robot, one can define formula_3 and formula_4 as the locale body coordinate system. The orientation of the robot with respect to the global coordinate system is the angle formula_5. The radius of the wheels is formula_6 and the width of the vehicle formula_7. Assuming that the wheels are at any time in contact with the ground (there is no slip), the wheels describe arcs in the plane in such a way that the vehicle always rotates around a point (referred to as formula_8⁣ - instantaneous center of rotation). The ground contact speed of the left wheel formula_9 and the right wheel formula_10 lead to a rotation of the vehicle by the angular velocity formula_11. Following the definition of angular velocity, one obtains:formula_12Solving these two equations for formula_11 and formula_14, while the latter is defined as the distance from formula_8 to the center of the robotformula_16 Using the equation for the angular velocity, the instantaneous velocity formula_17 of the point midway between the robot&#x27;s wheels is given byformula_18The wheel tangential velocities can also be written asformula_19 where formula_20 and formula_21 are the left and the right angular velocities of the wheels around their axes. The robot kinematics in local body coordinates can thus be written asformula_22Using a coordinate transformation (Rotation of axes), the robot&#x27;s kinematic model in global coordinates can finally be obtainedformula_23 where formula_17 and formula_25 are the control variables.

=== Differential Drive Controller ===
One might face a situation where the velocity formula_26 and the angular velocity formula_11 are given as inputs, and the angular velocities of the left formula_28and right wheels formula_29 are sought as control variables (see figure above). In this case, the already mentioned equation can be easily reformulated. Using the relations formula_30 and formula_31 in

formula_32 one obtains the equation for the angular velocity of the right wheel formula_29

formula_34

The same procedure can be applied to the calculation of the angular velocity of the left wheel formula_28

formula_36

<doc id="1060356" wikidata="Q1051634" url="?curid=1060356" title="Junicode">
<text>Junicode (&quot;Junius-Unicode&quot;) is a free and open-source (SIL Open Font License) old-style serif typeface developed by Peter S. Baker of the University of Virginia. T‌he design is based on a 17th-century typeface used in Oxford, England.

Junicode contains many special characters and ligatures for medievalists, along with numerous other Unicode glyphs. T‌he font has OpenType features for advanced typesetting and includes true small caps.

Since August 2023, Junicode has been a variable font and remains under active development.

==Design==

T‌he designs of the Junicode roman characters are based on a 17th-century typeface design used at the Oxford University Press, also known as Clarendon Press. Peter Baker based the Junicode roman design on those used in George Hickes&#x27; &quot;Linguarum Vett. Septentrionalium T‌hesaurus&quot; (1703–1705), naming the typeface Junicode (&quot;Junius Unicode&quot;) after Franciscus Junius, who had commissioned the original typeface used for the Anglo-Saxon texts in that volume, &quot;Pica Saxon&quot;. T‌he designs represent an intermediate stage between earlier 16th century typefaces (such as Garamond) and later 18th century typefaces (such as Caslon). T‌he Junicode roman character design shares a number of features with these earlier and later typefaces.

Junicode has an individual Greek typeface, Foulis Greek. T‌he design is a traditional revival as well. It is based on the Greek Double Pica cut by Alexander Wilson (c. 1714–1786), a Scottish doctor, astronomer, and typefounder. Wilson&#x27;s typeface was used in 1756–1758 for a renowned edition of Homer&#x27;s epics (the Iliad and the Odyssey), printed by Robert Foulis and Andrew Foulis of the Foulis Publishing House and printers to the University of Glasgow. T‌he characters previously included in Junicode font, since version 1.000, moved into a separate font.

==Origins and uses==
T‌he Junicode font was developed especially for medievalists, due to the need for a font to cover the large number of special characters and ligatures used in medieval manuscripts. T‌he font has complete support for the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative version 4.0 in the regular and italic faces.

Despite the specialization of Junicode for the needs of medievalists, the font is quite complete and supports a large number of Unicode characters. In the regular style, over 3000 characters are available. T‌his makes Junicode useful for a wide range of languages that utilize the Latin alphabet, including scholarly texts and publications that require special diacritics not traditionally found in conventional fonts. It exists in regular, italic, bold and bold italic styles, with the regular style having the largest character set. Regular and bold styles have small caps and all styles have swash alternates, although not a complete set of italic swash capitals.

Junicode has a very wide linespacing in many applications due to its numerous tall characters with stacked diacritics.

==Availability and development==
Junicode is free and open source software licensed under the SIL Open Font License, and is released in the TrueType format, which is used on most operating systems. Additionally, specific packages for Junicode are available for open source systems such as Debian, Ubuntu, and FreeBSD.

T‌he Junicode font is developed in the FontForge typeface editing program. T‌he font includes TrueType hinting, generated by the ttfautohint program.

<doc id="1060358" wikidata="Q2702410" url="?curid=1060358" title="Cape Race">
<text>Cape Race is a point of land located at the southeastern tip of the Avalon Peninsula on the island of Newfoundland, in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Its name is thought to come from the original Portuguese name for this cape, &quot;Raso&quot;, meaning flat or low-lying. The Cape appeared on early sixteenth century maps as Cabo Raso and its name may derive from a cape of the same name at the mouth of the Tagus River in Portugal. The cape was the location of the Cape Race LORAN-C transmitter until the system was decommissioned in 2010. It is also home to the Cape Race Lighthouse, notable for having received the distress call from the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;.

==Geography==
Dense fog, rocky coasts, and its proximity to trans-Atlantic shipping routes have resulted in many shipwrecks near Cape Race over the years. One of the most famous was the . Cape Race is a flat, barren point of land jutting out into the Atlantic Ocean, its cliffs rising almost vertically to above sea level. On average it is shrouded in fog on 158 days of the year.

==History==

In 1583, having claimed the port of St John&#x27;s for Queen Elizabeth I, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, on board the ship &quot;Squirrel&quot;, and accompanied by the ships &quot;Golden Hind&quot; and &quot;Delight&quot;, passed by Cape Race on his way back to England. &quot;Squirrel&quot; would sink en route, taking Gilbert with her.

From 1859 to 1866, the New York City Associated Press kept a newsboat at Cape Race to meet ocean liners passing by on their way from Europe so that news could be telegraphed to New York. These news items carried the byline &quot;via Cape Race&quot;.
In 1904, the first wireless station in Newfoundland was built at Cape Race. On the night &quot;Titanic&quot; sank, wireless operator Jack Phillips was sending telegraphs to Cape Race for relay to New York City. When Cyril Evans, wireless operator of the Leyland Line SS &quot;Californian&quot;, informed to the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, only a few miles away, that the ship had stopped for the night and was surrounded by icy water. Phillips responded &quot;DDD,&quot; meaning that he was transmitting to the Cape Race Marconi Station and to &quot;stop transmitting&quot; as he could not hear the faint signals from Cape Race due to &quot;Californian&quot;″s stronger signal.

Evans soon switched off the wireless and went to sleep at a normal time. Only fifteen minutes later, &quot;Titanic&quot; hit an iceberg. Cape Race was also the last land station to pick up &quot;Titanic&quot;″s distress calls. Contrary to belief, Evans was not offended and &quot;Titanic&quot;″s bridge was already aware of ice in the area due to previous ice warnings from other ships. After &quot;Titanic&#x27;s&quot; distress call, Cape Race played a major role in relaying news of the sinking to other ships and land locations.

On September 11, 1990, a Boeing 727 trijet went missing off the coast of Cape Race with 16 people on board. The aircraft was never found.

Marconi&#x27;s station (MCE) was rebuilt on the same site and opened as a &quot;wireless interpretation centre&quot; to commemorate the 100th anniversary of &quot;Titanic&quot;s sinking in 2012.

<text>Dombey and Son is a novel by English author Charles Dickens. It follows the fortunes of a shipping firm owner, who is frustrated at the lack of a son to follow him in his footsteps; he initially rejects his daughter&#x27;s love before eventually becoming reconciled with her before his death.

The story features many Dickensian themes, such as arranged marriages, child cruelty, betrayal, deceit, and relations between people from different British social classes. The novel was first published in monthly parts between 1846 and 1848, with illustrations by Hablot Knight Browne (&quot;Phiz&quot;).

==Development==
Dickens started writing the book in Lausanne, Switzerland, before returning to England, via Paris, to complete it.

The full title is &quot;Dealings with the Firm of Dombey and Son: Wholesale, Retail and for Exportation&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The story concerns Paul Dombey, the wealthy owner of the shipping company of the book&#x27;s title, whose dream is to have a son to continue his business. The book begins when his son is born and Dombey&#x27;s wife dies shortly after giving birth. Following the advice of Mrs Louisa Chick, his sister, Dombey employs a wet nurse named Mrs Richards (Toodle). Dombey already has a six-year-old daughter, Florence, but, bitter at her not having been the desired boy, he neglects her; following her mother&#x27;s death, her main source of love is her young attendant, Susan Nipper. About six months later, the two servants take their charges on an unauthorised visit to the home of Mrs Richards, so that she can see her children briefly. On the long walk home, Florence becomes separated from them and is kidnapped for a short time by Good Mrs Brown before being returned to the streets. She makes her way to Dombey and Son&#x27;s offices in the City and there is found and brought home by Walter Gay, a junior employee of Mr Dombey, who first introduces her to his uncle and guardian, the navigation instrument maker Solomon Gills, at his shop, The Wooden Midshipman.

Dombey’s son, named Paul after his father, is a weak and sickly child who does not socialise normally with others; adults call him &quot;old fashioned&quot;. He is intensely fond of his sister, Florence, who is deliberately neglected by her father as a supposedly irrelevant distraction. Paul is sent to the seaside at Brighton for his health, where he and Florence lodge with the ancient and acidic Mrs Pipchin. Finding his health beginning to improve there, Mr Dombey keeps him at Brighton and has him educated at Dr and Mrs Blimber&#x27;s school, where he and the other boys undergo an intense and arduous education under the tutelage of Mr Feeder, B.A. and Cornelia Blimber. It is here that Paul is befriended by a much older fellow pupil, the amiable but weak-minded Mr Toots.

Here Paul&#x27;s health declines even further in this &quot;great hothouse&quot; and he finally dies. Dombey pushes his daughter away from him after the death of his son while she futilely tries to earn his love. In the meantime young Walter is sent off to fill a junior position in the firm&#x27;s counting house in Barbados through the manipulations of Mr Dombey&#x27;s confidential manager, Mr James Carker, &quot;with his white teeth&quot;, who sees him as a potential rival through his association with Florence. The ship, The Son and Heir, is reported lost; Walter is presumed drowned. Solomon Gills departs London in search of his nephew, leaving his great friend Captain Edward Cuttle in charge of The Wooden Midshipman. Meanwhile Florence is left alone with few friends to keep her company.

Dombey goes to Leamington Spa to improve his health with a new friend, Major Joseph Bagstock. The Major deliberately sets out to befriend Dombey to spite his neighbour, Miss Tox, who has turned cold towards him owing to her hopes – through her close friendship with Mrs Chick – of marrying Mr Dombey. At the spa, the Major introduces Dombey to Mrs Skewton and her widowed daughter, Mrs Edith Granger. Mr Dombey, on the lookout for a new wife since his son&#x27;s death, considers Edith a suitable match owing to her accomplishments and family connections. She has beauty; he has money. He is encouraged by both the Major and Mrs Skewton, but obviously feels no affection for her, nor she for him. They return to London and marry. Dombey has effectively bought the haughty Edith, since she and her mother are in a poor financial state. The marriage is loveless; his wife despises Dombey for his overbearing pride and herself for being shallow and worthless. Her love for Florence initially prevents her from leaving but finally she conspires with Mr Carker to ruin Dombey&#x27;s public image by running away together to France. They do so after yet another argument with Dombey in which he once again attempts to subdue her to his will. When he discovers that she has left him, he blames Florence for siding with her stepmother, striking her on the breast in his anger. Florence runs away from home. Distraught, she makes her way to The Wooden Midshipman, where she lodges with Captain Cuttle as he attempts to restore her to health. They are visited frequently by Mr Toots and his prizefighter companion, the Chicken, the former having been desperately in love with Florence since their time together in Brighton.

Dombey sets out to find his runaway wife. He is helped by Mrs Brown and her daughter, Alice, who, as it turns out, had been seduced and abandoned by Mr Carker when she was young. After being transported as a convict, for criminal activities in which Mr Carker had involved her, she returns to England, reunites with her mother, and determines to seek her revenge. Mrs Brown arranges for Dombey to overhear her conversation with Rob the Grinder – whom Mr Carker has employed as a spy – about the whereabouts of the pair who have absconded. Dombey, accompanied by Major Bagstock, sets off to France in pursuit. In the meantime, in Dijon, Mrs Dombey informs Carker that she sees him in no better a light than she sees Dombey and that she will not stay with him, and she flees their apartment. Distraught, with both his financial and personal hopes lost, Carker flees from his former employer&#x27;s pursuit. He seeks refuge back in England, but while fleeing from a pursuing Dombey is struck by a train and killed.

Meanwhile, back at The Midshipman, Walter reappears, having been saved by a passing ship after floating adrift with two other sailors on some wreckage. After some time he and Florence are finally reunited – not as &quot;brother and sister&quot; but as lovers, and they marry prior to sailing for China on Walter&#x27;s new ship. This is also the time when Sol Gills returns to The Midshipman. As he relates to his friends, he received news whilst in Barbados that a homeward-bound China trader had picked up Walter and so had returned to England immediately. He said he had sent letters whilst in the Caribbean to his friend Ned Cuttle Mrs MacStinger at Cuttle&#x27;s former lodgings, and the bemused Captain recounts how he fled the place and thus never received them.

After Carker&#x27;s death it is discovered that he had been running the firm far beyond its means. This information is gleaned by Carker&#x27;s brother and sister, John and Harriet, from Mr Morfin, the assistant manager at Dombey and Son, who sets out to help John Carker. He often overheard the conversations between the two brothers in which James, the younger, often abused John, the older, a clerk who early in his career abused his financial position at Dombey and Son but was retained by Dombey as an example and possibly because of his relationship to James Carker. It is unclear whether James worked at the firm at the time of John&#x27;s downfall. As his nearest relatives John and Harriet inherit all Carker&#x27;s ill-gotten gains, to which they feel they have no right. Consequently they surreptitiously give the proceeds to Mr Dombey through Mr Morfin, who is instructed to let Dombey believe they are merely something forgotten in the general wreck of his fortunes.

Florence and Walter depart and Sol Gills is entrusted with a letter, written by Walter to Florence’s father, pleading for him to be reconciled towards them both. A year passes and Alice Brown has slowly been dying despite the tender care of Harriet Carker. One night Alice&#x27;s mother reveals that Alice herself is the illegitimate cousin of Edith Dombey (which accounts for their similarity in appearance when they meet). In a chapter entitled ‘Retribution’ Dombey and Son goes bankrupt. Dombey retires to two rooms in his house and all the house&#x27;s contents are put up for sale. Mrs Pipchin, for some time the housekeeper, dismisses all the servants and returns to Brighton, to be replaced by Mrs Richards. Dombey spends his days sunk in gloom, seeing no-one and thinking only of his daughter:He thought of her as she had been that night when he and his bride came home. He thought of her as she had been in all the home events of the abandoned house. He thought, now, that of all around him she alone had never changed. His boy had faded into dust, his proud wife had sunk into a polluted creature, his flatterer and friend had been transformed into the worst of villains, his riches had melted away, the very walls that sheltered him looked on him as a stranger; she alone had turned the same mild gentle look upon him always. Yes, to the latest and the last. She had never changed to him – nor had he ever changed to her – and she was lost.

However one day Florence returns to the house with her baby son, Paul, and is lovingly reunited with her father.

Dombey accompanies his daughter to her and Walter&#x27;s house, where he slowly starts to decline, cared for by Florence and also Susan Nipper, now Mrs Toots. They receive a visit from Edith&#x27;s cousin Feenix, who takes Florence to Edith for one final time: Feenix had sought Edith out in France and she had returned to England under his protection. Edith gives Florence a letter, asking Dombey to forgive her her crime before her departure to the South of Italy with her elderly relative. As she says to Florence, &quot;I will try, then, to forgive him his share of the blame. Let him try to forgive me mine!&quot;

The final chapter (LXII) sees Dombey now a white-haired old man &quot;whose face bears heavy marks of care and suffering; but they are traces of a storm that has passed on for ever, and left a clear evening in its track&quot;. Sol Gills and Ned Cuttle are now partners at The Midshipman, a source of great pride to the latter, and Mr and Mrs Toots announce the birth of their third daughter. Walter is doing well in business, having been appointed to a position of great confidence and trust, and Dombey is the proud grandfather of both a grandson and granddaughter, whom he dotes on. The book ends with the lines:
&quot;Dear grandpapa, why do you cry when you kiss me?&quot;
He only answers, &quot;Little Florence! Little Florence!&quot; and smooths away the curls that shade her earnest eyes.
==Characters==
In order of appearance:

Chapter 1
*Mr Paul Dombey: The main character, about 48 years old as the novel opens. &quot;In all his life, he had never made a friend. His cold and distant nature had neither sought one, nor found one&quot;. He is left a widower with two children by the end of Chapter 1. However he considers only his son, Paul, to be worthy of his attention; his daughter, Florence, is &quot;merely a piece of base coin that couldn&#x27;t be invested – a bad boy&quot;. The son&#x27;s death shatters Mr Dombey&#x27;s hopes for an heir. His neglect of his daughter, Florence, causes problems with his second wife, Edith, whom he essentially purchased. Owing to Edith&#x27;s hatred for him and his own misplaced trust in James Carker, Dombey loses his business and his wealth. Dombey finally realises that his daughter was the only person who truly cared for him, even when he has nothing left. He reconnects with her in his later years and gains an heir through his son-in-law.
*Mrs Fanny Dombey: Mr Dombey&#x27;s first wife, mother of Florence and Paul; dies soon after Paul is born
*Master Paul Dombey (Little Dombey): Born as the novel begins; he is weak and often ill. A gentle child, he is adored by his sister, Florence, and beloved of his schoolmates. He dies of an unspecified illness in Chapter 16.
*Miss Florence (Floy) Dombey: Mr Dombey&#x27;s daughter, about 6 years old as the novel begins. She dotes on her little brother. Despite her father&#x27;s neglect, which amounts to emotional abuse, she loves him and longs for some return of her affection. During an unauthorized outing with Mrs Richards (Toodle) she is snatched from the street by Good Mrs Brown. After her father&#x27;s wedding to Edith she bonds with her stepmother. Florence flees the house when she realizes that Edith has broken with her father, taking refuge with Captain Cuttle at The Wooden Midshipman. She eventually marries Walter Gay and bears him two children.
*Dr Parker Peps: One of the Court Physicians, pompously confuses Mrs Dombey&#x27;s name with the names of aristocrats whom he has treated
*Mrs Blockitt: Nurse, &quot;a simpering piece of faded gentility&quot;
*Mr Pilkins: Physician of the Dombey family, defers obsequiously to Dr Peps

*Mr Toodle: A locomotive stoker
*Mrs Polly Toodle (Richards): Fertile wife of Mr Toodle, engaged as nurse to young Paul. Mr Dombey wants her to use &quot;an ordinary name, and convenient&quot; while in his employ and thus requires her to answer to the name of Richards. During an ill-advised visit to her home in Staggs&#x27;s Gardens, Florence is temporarily taken by Good Mrs Brown. Mr Dombey is undisturbed by the loss of his daughter in the urban crowd but is incensed that Mrs Richards dared to take his son &quot;to such vile haunts&quot; and summarily discharges her. Later she is brought back by Captain Cuttle to keep house at The Wooden Midshipman
*Robin Toodle (Rob the Grinder, Biler): Son of Mr Toodle and Polly. Sent to the Charitable Grinders school through Mr Dombey&#x27;s largesse, he cannot resist the lure of tending pigeons and plays truant. A pathetic boy, Rob is manipulated by the adults and cannot find a way to better his lot. He is forced by Mr Carker, the Manager, to spy on Captain Cuttle and report the comings and goings at The Wooden Midshipman.

Chapter 3
*Miss Susan Nipper: Florence&#x27;s spitfire loyal nurse, about 14 years old at the time of her introduction to the reader.

Called &quot;The Junior&quot; to designate his place in the firm, not in relation to his (younger) brother

Chapter 7

Toots: The oldest student at Dr Blimber&#x27;s school, &quot;possessed of the gruffest of voices and the shrillest of minds&quot;, something of a dandy (&quot;people did say ... that when he began to have whiskers he left off having brains&quot;).

==Critical appreciation==
&quot;Dombey and Son&quot; was conceived first and foremost as a continuous novel. A letter from Dickens to Forster on 26 July 1846 shows the major details of the plot and theme already substantially worked out. According to the novelist George Gissing,
::Dombey was begun at Lausanne, continued at Paris, completed in London, and at English seaside places; whilst the early parts were being written, a Christmas story, &quot;The Battle of Life&quot;, was also in hand, and Dickens found it troublesome to manage both together. That he overcame the difficulty—that, soon after, we find him travelling about England as member of an amateur dramatic company—that he undertook all sorts of public engagements and often devoted himself to private festivity—Dombey going on the while, from month to month—is matter enough for astonishment to those who know anything about artistic production. But such marvels become commonplaces in the life of Charles Dickens.

There is some evidence to suggest that &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; was inspired by the life of Christopher Huffam, Rigger to His Majesty&#x27;s Navy, a gentleman and head of an established firm, Huffam &amp; Son. Charles Dickens&#x27;s father, John Dickens, at the time a clerk in the Navy Pay Office, asked the wealthy, well-connected Huffam to act as godfather to Charles. This same Huffam family appeared later in Charles Palliser&#x27;s 1989 &quot;The Quincunx&quot;, a homage to the Dickensian novel form.

As with most of Dickens&#x27;s work, a number of socially significant themes are to be found in this book. In particular the book deals with the then-prevalent common practice of arranged marriages for financial gain. Other themes to be detected within this work include child cruelty (particularly in Dombey&#x27;s treatment of Florence), familial relationships, and as ever in Dickens, betrayal and deceit and the consequences thereof. Another strong central theme, which the critic George Gissing elaborates on in detail in his 1925 work &quot;The Immortal Dickens&quot;, is that of pride and arrogance, of which Paul Dombey senior is the extreme exemplification in Dickens&#x27;s work.

Gissing makes a number of points about certain key inadequacies in the novel, not the least that Dickens&#x27;s central character is largely unsympathetic and an unsuitable vehicle and also that after the death of the young Paul Dombey the reader is somewhat estranged from the rest of what is to follow. He notes that &quot;the moral theme of this book was Pride—pride of wealth, pride of place, personal arrogance. Dickens started with a clear conception of his central character and of the course of the story in so far as it depended upon that personage; he planned the action, the play of motive, with unusual definiteness, and adhered very closely in the working to this well-laid scheme&quot;. However, he goes on to write that &quot;&quot;Dombey and Son&quot; is a novel which in its beginning promises more than its progress fulfils&quot; and gives the following reasons why:

Impossible to avoid the reflection that the death of Dombey&#x27;s son and heir marks the end of a complete story, that we feel a gap between Chapter XVI and what comes after (the author speaks of feeling it himself, of his striving to &quot;transfer the interest to Florence&quot;) and that the narrative of the later part is ill-constructed, often wearisome, sometimes incredible. We miss Paul, we miss Walter Gay (shadowy young hero though he be); Florence is too colourless for deep interest, and the second Mrs Dombey is rather forced upon us than accepted as a natural figure in the drama. Dickens&#x27;s familiar shortcomings are abundantly exemplified. He is wholly incapable of devising a plausible intrigue, and shocks the reader with monstrous improbabilities such as all that portion of the denouement in which old Mrs Brown and her daughter are concerned. A favourite device with him (often employed with picturesque effect) was to bring into contact persons representing widely severed social ranks; in this book the &quot;effect&quot; depends too often on &quot;incidences of the boldest artificiality,&quot; as nearly always we end by neglecting the story as a story, and surrendering ourselves to the charm of certain parts, the fascination of certain characters.
===Characters in the novel===
Karl Ashley Smith, in his introduction to Wordsworth Classics&#x27; edition of &quot;Dombey and Son&quot;, makes some reflections on the novel&#x27;s characters. He believes that Dombey&#x27;s power to disturb comes from his belief that human relationships can be controlled by money, giving the following examples to support this viewpoint: He tries to prevent Mrs Richards from developing an attachment to Paul by emphasising the wages he pays her. Mrs Pipchin&#x27;s small talk satisfies him as &quot;the sort of thing for which he paid her so much a quarter&quot; (p.132). Worst of all, he effectively buys his second wife and expects that his wealth and position in society will be enough to keep her in awed obedience to him. Paul&#x27;s questions about money are only the first indication of the naivety of his outlook.

However, he also believes that the satire against this man is tempered with compassion.

Smith also draws attention to the fact that certain characters in the novel &quot;develop a pattern from Dickens&#x27;s earlier novels, whilst pointing the way to future works&quot;. One such character is Little Paul who is a direct descendant of Little Nell. Another is James Carker, the ever-smiling manager of Dombey and Son. Smith notes there are strong similarities between him and the likes of Jaggers in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and, even more so, the evil barrister, Mr Tulkinghorn, in &quot;Bleak House&quot;:From Fagin (&quot;Oliver Twist&quot;) onwards, the terrifying figure exerting power over others by an infallible knowledge of their secrets becomes one of the author&#x27;s trademarks ... James Carker&#x27;s gentlemanly businesslike respectability marks him out as the ancestor of Tulkinghorn in &quot;Bleak House&quot; and even of Jaggers in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. And his involvements in the secrets of others leads him to as sticky an end as Tulkinghorn&#x27;s. The fifty-fifth chapter, where he is forced to flee his outraged employer, magnificently continues the theme of the guilt-hunted man from Bill Sikes in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; and Jonas&#x27;s restless sense of pursuit in &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;. There is always a strong sense in Dickens of the narrative drive of discovery catching up with those who deal in darkness.

Gissing looks at some of the minor characters in the novel and is particularly struck by that of Edward (Ned) Cuttle.Captain Cuttle has a larger humanity than his roaring friend [Captain Bunsby], he is the creation of humour. That the Captain suffered dire things at the hands of Mrs MacStinger is as credible as it is amusing, but he stood in no danger of Bunsby&#x27;s fate; at times he can play his part in a situation purely farcical, but the man himself moves on a higher level. He is one of the most familiar to us among Dickens&#x27;s characters, an instance of the novelist&#x27;s supreme power, which (I like to repeat) proves itself in the bodying forth of a human personality henceforth accepted by the world. His sentences have become proverbs; the mention of his name brings before the mind&#x27;s eye an image of flesh and blood – rude, tending to the grotesque, but altogether lovable. Captain Cuttle belongs to the world of Uncle Toby, with, to be sure, a subordinate position. Analyse him as you will, make the most of those extravagances which pedants of to-day cannot away with, and in the end you will still be face to face with something vital – explicable only as the product of genius.

===The growth of the railways===

One theme is the destruction and degradation, of both people and places, caused by industrialisation, illustrated in particular by the building of the new railway through Camden Town (assumed to represent the London and Birmingham Railway constructed between 1833 and 1837). The novel reflects to some extent Dickens&#x27;s concerns with railway travel and the &quot;railway mania&quot;, &quot;a fascination which had a strong ingredient of fear in it&quot;, and reflects ambivalence towards the effects of the railways – they generated prosperity and employment, but undermined older ways of living and encouraged speculation. In 1865, many years after this novel was published, Dickens was involved in a train crash. Soon after this incident he wrote two short stories, &quot;Mugby Junction&quot; and &quot;The Signal-Man&quot;, which projected a morbid view of the railways.

===Folklore, legends and myth===
See Folklore, legends and myths in &quot;Dombey and Son&quot;

&quot;Dombey and Son&quot; draws heavily from popular literature inspired by legendary folklore, contemporary melodramas, and traditional pantomime. It also incorporates some fairy tales and ancient myths like Argus or the Cyclops.

===Final thoughts===

Gissing refers to Dickens&#x27;s instinctive genius for reflecting the thoughts and morals of the common man in his writing. He observes that the author was in constant communication with Forster, as to the feeling of his readers about some proposed incident or episode; not that he feared, in any ignoble sense, to offend his public, but because his view of art involved compliance with ideals of ordinary simple folk. He held that view as a matter of course. Quite recently it has been put forth with prophetic fervour by Tolstoy, who cites Dickens among the few novelists whose work will bear this test. An instinctive sympathy with the moral (and therefore the artistic) prejudices of the everyday man guided Dickens throughout his career, teaching him when, and how far, he might strike at things he thought evil, yet never defeat his prime purpose of sending forth fiction acceptable to the multitude. Himself, in all but his genius, a representative Englishman of the middle-class, he was able to achieve this task with unfailing zeal and with entire sincerity.

Karl Smith, in his turn, gives his specific reasons for what makes &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; – and the works of Dickens as a whole – worth reading again and again. He observes that this is based in part on Dickens&#x27;s &quot;recognition that solemn themes require humour and verbal vigour to accompany and complement them&quot; and goes on to conclude: Grim psychological realism, social commentary, comic absurdity and symbolic transcendence are here brought together more than in any previous novel with the possible exception of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; not only prepares the ground for Dickens&#x27;s later masterpieces, but demands to be enjoyed for its own energy and richness.

<doc id="1060363" wikidata="Q287887" url="?curid=1060363" title="Harry Saltzman">
<text>Herschel &quot;Harry&quot; Saltzman (; – ) was a Canadian theatre and film producer. He is best remembered for co-producing the first nine of the &quot;James Bond&quot; film series with Albert R. Broccoli. Apart from a ten-year stint living in St. Petersburg, Florida, he lived most of his life in Denham, Buckinghamshire, England.

==Early life==
Saltzman was born in a hospital in Sherbrooke, Quebec, the son of Jewish immigrants Abraham Saltzman and Dora Horstein. His father was a horticulturalist and immigrated to the US in 1905 from Kozienice, Poland (then Congress Poland within the Russian Empire). His parents married in 1909. The couple moved to Canada in 1910 where their four oldest children (Minnie, Florence, Herschel and Isadore) were born. The family then moved to Cleveland, Ohio where their youngest son, David, was born. Saltzman was raised in Saint John, New Brunswick for the first seven years of his life. Harry ran away from home at the age of 15. Saltzman was 30 when he learned where he had actually been born.

==Career==
At about age 17, Saltzman joined a circus and travelled with them for some years.

In 1932, Saltzman moved to Paris to study political science and economics. However within a year, he was &quot;hand-picking talent for 40 two-a-day vaudeville houses all over Europe.&quot; Saltzman claimed that he had worked as an assistant for French film director René Clair, who came to the United States in 1940 to make the film &quot;The Flame of New Orleans&quot;.

In 1942, Saltzman signed a booking contract with Fanchon &amp; Marco Enterprises. Saltzman went to the West Coast to sign big picture names. Saltzman sought the Ritz Brothers, but due to film commitments, they could not sign. In 1943, Saltzman was managing The Gilbert Brothers&#x27; Combined Circus. According to an advert, the 1943 season began 26 May in Clifton, New Jersey, and was booked solid through the Eastern American states until mid-October.

Shortly after World War II began, he enlisted with the Royal Canadian Air Force in Vancouver. He received a medical discharge in Trenton, Ontario in 1943, and joined the U.S. Psychological Warfare Bureau, because he wanted to get back to Europe. Saltzman was initially stationed at the North African theatre in 1943 before being reassigned to London.

In 1945, Saltzman helped Lin Yutang establish UNESCO&#x27;s film division, which was initially focused on trying to mediate the Chinese Civil War between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang. He eventually quit due to &quot;east-west differences&quot; which to him seemed &quot;so hopeless&quot;. Saltzman spent a year with the French government&#x27;s Ministry of Reconstruction. At that point, he decided he wanted back in show business.

After the war, in Paris, Saltzman became part of the writer Colette&#x27;s entourage. He worked as a talent scout for European productions on stage, television and in film, but gradually became more successful producing stage plays. He moved to the United States in the 1950s. In the late 1950s, Saltzman and Rhea Fink formed the Mountie Enterprises Corporation, to operate coin-operated hobby horses. The first hobby horses appeared in department stores, on floors where children&#x27;s goods are sold. By February 1951 Mountie Enterprises Corporation and Saltzman&#x27;s new company Rider Amusement Corporation reported brisk business, as both companies got contracts to install coin-operated hobby horses in major department stores in numerous American cities. Saltzman claimed to earn a day per hobby horse.(equivalent to $413.30 in 2023)

He became production supervisor on &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; and produced &quot;Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion&quot;. 

He moved, what was by then his family of four, to the UK in the mid-1950s, where he again produced theatre. He entered the film business by producing &quot;The Iron Petticoat&quot; (1956), a play adaptation. Saltzman started Woodfall Film Productions with Tony Richardson and John Osborne, and produced other acclaimed social realism dramas such as 1959&#x27;s &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; and 1960&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot;. Film director Anthony Mann noted the dichotomy in Saltzman&#x27;s career: &quot;Harry used to make great pictures; now he makes very successful ones. After all, you can&#x27;t be an artist all your life.&quot;

In early 1961, excited by reading the James Bond novel &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, he made a bid to land the film rights to the character. Saltzman co-founded Danjaq, S.A. with Albert R. Broccoli in 1962. It was a holding company responsible for the copyright and trademarks of James Bond on screen, and the parent company of Eon Productions, which they also set up as a film production company for the Bond films. The moniker Danjaq is a combination of the names of Broccoli&#x27;s third wife and Saltzman&#x27;s second (Dana and Jacqueline, respectively).

In 1958, he had set up the production company Lowndes Productions, but he did not use it for film production until 1965, and used it for eight productions thereafter, among them his three Harry Palmer films with Michael Caine: &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; (1965), &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot; (1966) and &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot; (1967). The company&#x27;s last production came out in 1988, and it was dissolved in 1992.

Saltzman produced other films between the James Bond and Harry Palmer productions. These include his World War II pet project &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969), and &quot;Call Me Bwana&quot; (1963), one of only three films to be produced by Eon Productions outside of the James Bond franchise. Saltzman also attempted to make a film about Canadian Métis leader Cuthbert Grant.

In 1969, Saltzman borrowed 70 million Swiss francs () from the Union Bank of Switzerland. In 1970, Saltzman won control of the Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation from chairman Patrick Frawley in a proxy fight. However, by 1972 Saltzman sold off 370,500 shares of Technicolor stock for $7.6M to repay his loan from the Union Bank of Switzerland. &quot;Film Bulletin&quot; also claimed that some of Saltzman&#x27;s former allies in the 1970 proxy had forced Saltzman to sell the stocks — which they purchased — and were seeking to oust him from the Technicolor board. Saltzman filed several lawsuits against Technicolor executive board members, claiming conspiracy &quot;seeking to retain his positions in the firm.&quot; Screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz claims Technicolor was selling at $30 per share, when Saltzman took control of the company in 1970; it was selling at $8 a share by 1972, at the time Saltzman was ousted. At some point, Saltzman defaulted on the interest payments to the Swiss Bank.

According to a 1978 court decision, Saltzman and Broccoli had allegedly agreed to dissolve Danjaq, S.A. in 1972, but Broccoli later allegedly refused to honour the agreement. Saltzman unsuccessfully attempted to have the Swiss courts dissolve the company. By autumn that year, Saltzman&#x27;s financial situation was desperate. In March 1974, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Saltzman was attempting to sell Paramount Pictures his 50% share of the Bond film franchise. On April 24, 1978, Sir Patrick O&#x27;Connor of the British High Court ordered Saltzman to pay an American law firm () plus () in post-judgment interest and court costs. Saltzman had retained the firm to resolve his financial difficulties.

Saltzman&#x27;s productions in the 1970s also proved problematic. A science fiction musical, &quot;Toomorrow&quot; starring Olivia Newton-John, was withdrawn from release and resulted in several lawsuits. Also in 1970, Saltzman cancelled a planned film, several weeks before shooting was to begin, about the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, starring Rudolf Nureyev. Director Tony Richardson believed that Saltzman had overextended himself, and did not have the funds to make the film. Throughout the 1970s, Saltzman struggled to make a film of &quot;The Micronauts&quot; — a &quot;shrunken man&quot;, which was a science fiction story to have starred Gregory Peck and Lee Remick — investing much money into the doomed project, that was finally shelved in the late 1970s. Due to numerous financial difficulties, Saltzman sold his 50% stake in Danjaq to United Artists Corporation in 1975. Subsequently, his health also declined and he became depressed.

In 1980, Saltzman purchased the theatrical production company H.M. Tennent Ltd., becoming its chairman.

Saltzman all but retired from the movie business thereafter. He had long desired to produce a film on the life of Vaslav Nijinsky, based on biographies, the rights to which he had acquired in the 1960s. He has an executive producer credit on the film &quot;Nijinsky&quot; in 1980, and the 1988 British-Italian-Yugoslavian co-production &quot;Time of the Gypsies&quot;.

In 1992, Saltzman dissolved H.M. Tennant.

==Personal life==
Saltzman was married three times. He had four children; one with his first wife and three with his second. 

He was briefly married in California. His first wife Tanya &quot;helped in an amazing way to enlighten his work and contribution to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force and in the U.S. secret service OSS,&quot; &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; noted. Saltzman&#x27;s first child, Merry, was born in 1946. As a child, she played with the likes of Ian Fleming, Sean Connery, Ursula Andress, Michael Caine and Cary Grant. On October 30, 2024 at the age of 77, she died at her home in San Jose, California following a brief battle with cancer.

Judith Krantz claims that she and Saltzman briefly dated. Krantz&#x27;s father liked Saltzman and found him an entertaining conversationalist. Krantz claims that Saltzman proposed to her. She declined, saying that he was not her physical type, which she regretted because she thought he was &quot;a wonderful companion, with a fantastic imagination.&quot;

After World War II, Saltzman was in Paris, where he met Jacqueline Colin, a refugee from Romania, whom he subsequently married. Harry and Jacqueline Saltzman had three children: Hilary, Steven and Christopher. Hilary and Christopher attended the private Shorecrest Preparatory School in St. Petersburg, Florida during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In the early 1970s, Saltzman&#x27;s wife Jacqueline was diagnosed with terminal cancer. In 1972, the Saltzmans relocated to St. Petersburg, Florida, where Jacqueline&#x27;s sister lived. In March 1977, Saltzman sold his English country mansion and moved full-time to St. Petersburg. Jacqueline Saltzman died of cancer on January 31, 1980.

In 1982, Saltzman sold his 15-room Venetian Isles, St. Petersburg, Florida home, and moved back to London. His two oldest children with Jacqueline were out of school, and his youngest was studying in Switzerland.

Harry Saltzman subsequently married Adriana Ghinsberg.

He died of a heart attack on September 28, 1994, while visiting Paris.

<text>The Longshan culture, also sometimes referred to as the Black Pottery Culture, was a late Neolithic culture in the middle and lower Yellow River valley areas of northern China from about 3000 to 1900 BC. The first archaeological find of this culture took place at the Chengziya Archaeological Site in 1928, with the first excavations in 1930 and 1931. The culture is named after the nearby modern town of Longshan ( &quot;Dragon Mountain&quot;) in Zhangqiu, Shandong. The culture was noted for its highly polished black pottery (or egg-shell pottery).

The population expanded dramatically during the 3rd millennium BC, with many settlements having rammed earth walls. In addition to the Shandong area, variants developed in the middle Yellow River area, Taosi in the Fen River valley, and in the Wei River valley. Around 2000 BC, the population decreased sharply and large settlements were abandoned in most areas except the central area, which evolved into the Bronze Age Erlitou culture.

==History==
A distinctive feature of the Longshan culture was the high level of skill in pottery making, including the use of pottery wheels, producing thin-walled and polished black pottery.
This pottery was widespread in North China, and also found in the Yangtze River valley and as far as the southeastern coast.

Until the 1950s, such black pottery was considered the principal diagnostic, and all of these sites were assigned to the Longshan culture.
In the first edition of his influential survey &quot;The Archaeology of Ancient China&quot;, published in 1963, Kwang-chih Chang described the whole area as a &quot;Longshanoid horizon&quot;, suggesting a fairly uniform culture attributed to expansion from a core area in the Central Plain.
More recent discoveries have uncovered much more regional diversity than previously thought, so that many local cultures included within Chang&#x27;s Longshanoid horizon are now viewed as distinct cultures, and the term &quot;Longshan culture&quot; is restricted to the middle and lower Yellow River valley.
For example, the contemporaneous culture of the lower Yangtze area is now described as the Liangzhu culture.
At the same time, researchers recognized the diversity within the Yellow River valley by distinguishing regional variants in Henan, Shanxi and Shaanxi from the Shandong or &quot;classic&quot; Longshan.
In the fourth edition of his book (1986), Chang moved from a model centered on the Central Plain to a model of distinctive regional cultures whose development was stimulated by interaction between regions, a situation he called the &quot;Chinese interaction sphere&quot;.
Also in the 1980s, Yan Wenming proposed the term &quot;Longshan era&quot; to encompass cultures of the late Neolithic (3rd millennium BC) across the area, though he assigned the Central Plain a leading role.

== Agriculture ==
The most important crop was foxtail millet, but traces of broomcorn millet, rice and wheat have also been found. Rice grains have been found in Shandong and southern Henan, and a small rice field has been found on the Liaodong peninsula. Specialized tools for digging, harvesting and grinding grain have been recovered.

The most common source of meat was the pig. Sheep and goats were apparently domesticated in the Loess Plateau area in the 4th millennium BC, found in western Henan by 2800 BC, and then spread across the middle and lower Yellow River area. Dogs were also eaten, particularly in Shandong, though cattle were less important.

Small-scale production of silk by raising and domesticating the silkworm in early sericulture was also known.

== Ritual ==
Remains have been found in Shaanxi and southern Henan of scapulae of cattle, pigs, sheep and deer that were heated as a form of divination.
Evidence of human sacrifice becomes more common in Shaanxi and the Central Plain in the late Longshan period.

== Early period ==

Excavations in the 1950s in Shanxian, western Henan, identified a Miaodigou II phase (3000 to 2600 BC) transitional between the preceding Yangshao culture and the later Henan Longshan.
A minority of archaeologists have suggested that this phase, which is contemporaneous with the late Dawenkou culture in Shandong, should instead be assigned to the Yangshao culture, but most describe it as the early phase of the Henan Longshan.
Some scholars argue that the late Dawenkou culture should be considered the early phase of the Shandong Longshan culture.

Miaodigou II sites are found in central and western Henan, southern Shanxi and the Wei River valley in Shaanxi.
The tools and pottery found at these sites were significantly improved from those of the preceding Yangshao culture.
Agriculture was intensified, and the consumption of domesticated animals (pigs, dogs, sheep and cattle) greatly increased.
Similarities in ceramic styles of central Henan Miaodigou II with the late Dawenkou culture to the east and the late Qujialing culture to the south suggest trade contacts between the regions. There were also expansions from middle and late Dawenkou sites (3500-2600 BC) toward central Henan and northern Anhui which coincides the era of maximum marine transgression.

== Late period ==
The late period (2600 to 2000 BC) of the Longshan culture in the middle Yellow River area is contemporaneous with the classic Shandong Longshan culture. Most scholars regard the Chalcolithic to have begun during the Longshan culture from 2600 to 2000 BC.

Several regional variants of the late middle Yellow River Longshan have been identified, including Wangwan III in western Henan, Hougang II in northern Henan and southern Hebei, Taosi in the Fen River basin in southern Shanxi, and several clusters on the middle reaches of the Jing River and Wei River collectively known as Kexingzhuang II or the Shaanxi Longshan.

As the Neolithic population in China reached its peak, hierarchies of settlements developed.
In physically circumscribed locations, such as the basin of the Fen River in southern Shanxi, the Yellow River in western Henan (confined by the Zhongtiao Mountains and Xiao Mountains) and the coastal Rizhao plain of southeast Shandong, a few very large (over 200 ha) centers developed. In more open areas, such as the rest of Shandong, the Central Plain (in Henan) and the Wei River basin in Shaanxi, local centers were more numerous, smaller (generally 20 to 60 ha) and fairly evenly spaced. Cities were linked to large networks of surrounding towns and villages, indicating the ability of urban elites to exert control over the countryside and its agrarian wealth.

Settlements developed into cities with clearly demarcated sections for different classes and occupations, as well as large elite residences and ritual structures. Signs of considerable population growth and rising social stratification indicate that the Longshan culture began forming into competing chieftainships, ruled by dynastic lineages with the support of elite kin networks. The technology of well construction in cities improved, while some large houses included rudimentary plumbing through clay pipes. Walls of rammed earth have been found in 20 towns in Shandong, 9 in the Central Plain and one (Taosi) in southern Shanxi, suggesting conflict between polities in these areas. The introduction of the dagger-axe, a purely military weapon that cannot be used for hunting, indicates a heightened prevalence of warfare.

This period also saw increasingly widespread and skilled manufacturing of copper tools, rings and bells, alongside a few bronze and brass objects, paving the way for the emergence of the later Bronze Age cultures.

=== Shandong Longshan ===

The center of Shandong is a mountainous area, including Mount Tai (1,545 m) and other several other peaks over 1000 m. Longshan settlements are found on the plains surrounding this massif.
To the north are four evenly spaced walled centers, Chengziya, Dinggong, Tianwang and Bianxianwang (from west to east), with the largest, Chengziya, enclosing only 20 ha.
A pottery sherd inscribed with 11 symbols was found at Dinggong, but scholars disagree on whether it should be dated to the Neolithic period.

The largest sites yet found in Shandong are Liangchengzhen (273 ha) and Yaowangcheng (368 ha). Both sites are near the southeast coast in the Rizhao area, with Yaowangcheng about 35 km to the south of Liangchengzhen. Each site is surrounded by a hierarchy of economically integrated settlements, but there are relatively few settlements in the area between the two, suggesting that they were political centers of rival polities. Production of pottery, stone tools and textiles was common. There is also evidence suggesting the production of fermented beverages and prestige items made from jade and metal. Since both jade prestige items and utilitarian goods such as stone tools and pottery have been found at the sites, this suggests that they were also regional centers for production and exchange of goods. At Liangchengzhen, rice, foxtail millet, broomcorn millet and wheat were grown. Foxtail millet was the most important crop in terms of the amount grown, however it was primarily used for animal fodder. Rice was the preferred food for human consumption.

Relative to other Longshan-era cultures, the gap between rich and poor in the Shandong Longshan was far less pronounced and there seemed to be less violence compared to other Longshan sites. The Shandong Longshan developed out of the Dawenkou culture and was succeeded by the Bronze Age Yueshi culture.

===Hougang II===
The Hougang II variant of Longshan culture is located in northern Henan and Southern Hebei. The sites of this Longshan subtradition are densely distributed along the rivers in this region, many of the sites being less than 1 km apart. Walled sites include Hougang (10 ha) and Mengzhuang (16 ha). The Hougang II variant is known for having the first wells in the Yellow River area and the method they employed continued to be used by early bronze-age states in the region.

===Wangwan III===
The Wangwan III variant of the Longshan culture is located in western and central Henan province. The number of sites in this region triples from the Yangshao period, developing into multi-centered competitive systems. There is evidence of metallurgy at the Wangchenggang site, though it is possibly attributed to later layers. The Wangwan III variant is said to have given rise to the Erlitou culture; specifically a 70 ha walled center at Xinzhai is said to lead &quot;typologically directly to early Erlitou&quot;.

=== Taosi ===
At 300 ha in area, the walled site at Taosi in the Linfen Basin in southern Shanxi, is the largest Longshan settlement in the middle Yellow River area. Mortuary practices indicate a complex society with at least three social ranks.

In the late Taosi period, the rammed-earth wall was destroyed, and there are indications of violence and political upheaval. At around the same time, the new large center of Fangcheng (230 ha) was built 20 km to the southeast of Taosi, on the other side of the Chong Mountains.

=== Sanliqiao II ===
Sanliqiao II sites are located on both sides of the Yellow River in western Henan, southwestern Shanxi and eastern Shaanxi. There are nearly a hundred settlements belonging to this regional variant which show three level settlement hierarchy. The largest site (Xiaojiaokou, 10 km southeast of modern Sanmenxia) is 240 ha in area, whereas local centers range from 30 ha to 70 ha.

Dwelling types of Sanliqiao II culture include both aboveground and semi-subterranean type houses as well as homes horizontally dug into loess cliffs with walls frequently coated with plaster.

There is noted similarity between the ceramics of this variant and that of the Kexingzhuang II variant.

===Kexingzhuang II===
Kexingzhuang II sites are scattered across the Wei River valley in southern Shaanxi. The largest site in this area is 60 ha, which is less than half the size of the largest Yangshao-era site in this region. A population decline is also noted during this period, which scholars attribute to migration caused by environmental changes. Out of 718 identified sites, 25 would be considered &quot;medium sized&quot; centers surrounded by small village settlements in three-level settlement hierarchy.

== Decline ==
Towards the end of the 3rd millennium BC, the population decreased sharply in most of the region and many of the larger centres were abandoned, possibly due to environmental change linked to the end of the Holocene Climatic Optimum. This was matched by the disappearance of high-quality black pottery found in ritual burials. In contrast, there was a rapid growth of population and social complexity in the basin of the Yi and Luo rivers of central Henan, culminating in the Erlitou culture. The material culture in this area shows a continuous development, through a Xinzhai phase centred on the Song Mountains immediately to the south. In the Taosi area, however, there is no such continuity between Longshan and Erlitou material culture, suggesting a collapse in that area and later expansion from the Erlitou core area.

== Significance of the discovery of Longshan culture ==

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, there were opposing views on the origin of Chinese culture and civilization: Western origin versus native origin. One of the most representative of &quot;Western Origin&quot; for the culture of prehistoric China was put forward by J. G. Andersson (1874–1960), who excavated the Neolithic site of Yangshao, Henan, in 1921. Many of the unearthed ceramics from Yangshao were painted potsherds. Andersson believed that the Yangshao painted pottery originated from the west, with connections with Anau in Central Asia and Trypillia in Eastern Europe. Heavily flawed, this view has been long abandoned in academia.

The Longshan culture period is an important period in history. The use of bronze ware, the emergence of a large number of city sites, and the wide application of thin-bodied black pottery and quick-wheel pottery-making techniques indicate that the social productive forces achieved unprecedented development during this period, which led to the polarization of the rich and the poor within the society; thus the emergence of class antagonisms.

The Longshan culture had individuals of extraordinary stature who have been dubbed the &quot;Longshan giants&quot;. Some samples of Longshan culture males recovered from Shandong fell between the 180 cm to 190 cm height range, making them taller than any other Neolithic population in the world. Modern day inhabitants of Shandong have the tallest heights of any Chinese province. The tallest Longshan individual discovered so far is a 193 cm male, aged approximately 16-18 years old, from Shaanxi.

<text>Ogulin () is a town in central Croatia, in Karlovac County. It has a population of 7,389 (2021) (it was 8,216 in 2011), and a total municipal population of 12,251 (2021). Ogulin is known for its historic stone castle, known as Kula, and the nearby mountain of Klek.

==Toponymy==

There are several proposed etymologies for the name of Ogulin. Firstly that the surrounding woods needed to be cleared for a better defence of the town, so Ogulin received its name because of the resulting bare area (&quot;ogolio&quot; in Croatian) around it. There were a lot of lime-trees along the road from Ogulin towards Oštarije, and the people used to peel the bark, in order to get bass. It is suggested that Ogulin got its name from the verb to peel (&quot;guliti&quot; in Croatian). Neither proposal is historically confirmed.

==History==
Ogulin&#x27;s history dates back to the fifteenth century, when it struggled against the Ottoman Turks. The exact timing of the building of the Ogulin tower has not been established. However, a document issued by Bernardin Frankopan in his town of Modruš at around 1500 AD marked off the boundaries of new castle between Modruš and Vitunj, and this is, at the same time, the first historical mention of Ogulin. Ogulin is known for the legend of Đula (also Zuleika or Zula) who threw herself into the abyss of the River Dobra because of an unhappy love affair. In the sixteenth century, it became a military stronghold against the Ottomans.

For a brief time, between 1809 and 1813, Ogulin was a part of the Illyrian Provinces.

Until 1918, Ogulin was part of the Austrian monarchy (Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Modruš-Rijeka County, after the compromise of 1867), in the Croatian Military Frontier. It was administered by the &quot;Oguliner Grenz-Infanterie-Regiment N°III&quot; before 1881.

===WWII===
On 11 April 1941, the new NDH authorities made administrator of the kotar of Ogulin.

It was in Ogulin that Ante Pavelić gave his first speech on 13 April 1941 as he travelled to Zagreb. He was greeted by priest Ivan Mikan, who served in Ogulin from 1937 until his death in 1943, and wore a cylindrical hat for the occasion, believing the arrival of Pavelić would be solemn only to feel silly when it wasn&#x27;t. Two or three hymns were sung and then Pavelić gave his speech, full of threats against the Serbs and praise for the Italians who brought him there (no Germans were in attendance).

In Ogulin and its environs, the early arrests in May mostly targeted JRZ members like Dragan Žagrović and Pero Piškur, as well as its sympathisers, including Joso Kušer, Laslo Havelić and Roko Kučinić. Arrests did not begin in earnest until May. Other prominent JRZ members in Ogulin at the time included Vlado Bosnić, Đuro Tatalović and Stevan Čurčić.

On 8 May 1941, an article titled &quot;Order and work in Ogulin&quot; () was published in &quot;&quot;, describing the taking down of various signs put in place by the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, in place of which Croatian flags were placed. It described the process of &quot;cleansing&quot; Ogulin of Serbs loyal to the House of Karađorđević.

On 3 June, an Ustaša ralley with over 12,000 in attendance was held at Ogulin. Priest Mikan presided over the mass, followed by a speech from .

On 9 June, Lovro Sušić, by that time Minister of People&#x27;s Economy, wrote to in &quot;Hrvatski narod&quot;, &quot;We don&#x27;t want a bloody cleansing,&quot; () but &quot;the Serbs must move&quot; ().

On 30 June and 16 July, lists of Serbian and Jewish workers on the territory of the Ogulin kotar who had not achieved the right to a pension were made. From these lists, it is apparent that state workers of Serb ethnicity numbered 144 at the time, the largest portion of which worked in the railway industry, and the remainder in schools, the kotar court, the kotar itself, the općina, or the forestry service.

On 1 July, Pavelić founded the with its seat in Ogulin, by merging Ogulin with Slunj, Vrbovsko and Delnice.

==Geography==


The town of Ogulin is situated in the very centre of mainland Croatia, between Zagreb and Rijeka. It was founded in a large valley formed by two rivers: the Dobra and Zagorska Mrežnica. The administrative constitution of the town of Ogulin covers the area of 543.32 km2, and has about 14,000 inhabitants according to 2011 census.

This is a kind of transitional micro-region neighbouring the larger regions of Croatia - Gorski Kotar, Lika, Kordun and Gornje Pokuplje. The Ogulin-Modruš valley is the northern section of the Ogulin-Plaški valley, which finishes towards the south where the Modruš hills pass into the second largest field of the area under Kapela-Plaški Polje. This comprises a completed geographical whole border on the western side by the mountain massif of Velika Kapela dominated by Klek (1181 m). Its eastern edges are bordered by the mounts of Krpel (), Brezovica () and Hum (). The valley then passes to the hilly are dominated by Klekinja () and Trojvrh (). This valley is also called Ogulin&#x27;s Plain (in Croatian: Ogulinsko Polje). This is the fifth largest karst valley in Croatia (), and it lies above sea level. Its elongated form lies in the direction northwest-southeast, and it is long (Ogulin-Trojvrh) and wide (Desmerice-Skradnik). The Dobra River runs through and disappears in the center of the town.

Approximately three kilometers south of the town centre is an artificial lake Sabljaci, formed with the purpose of accumulating water from the Zagorska Mrežnica river, and for the sake of generating electricity in the Hydroelectric power plant Gojak. The lake is connected with the town&#x27;s other artificial lake, lake Bukovnik, via a tunnel. Lake Bukovnik is approximately one kilometer away from lake Sabljaci, and is connected to the hydroelectric power plant Gojak also with a tunnel, approximately 10 km long. The surface area of lake Sabljaci is around 170 ha, which makes it the 11th Croatian lake when compared by size. The lake contains many kinds of fish species, and it is also used for swimming and various water sports.

==Culture==

=== Parish Church of the Extolling Saint Cross ===

This church was built in 1781 in the middle of the town, in the Park of King Tomislav. Consecrated on June 1, 179, it reflects the spirit of the time with its pleasing external appearance and the richness of various sculptural decorations. The town of Ogulin celebrates September 14 as the fest day of its patron Saint of Extolling of the Cross.

=== Saint Bernard Chapel ===
Bernardin Frankopan, the son of Stjepan, and the founder of the town of Ogulin, erected a chapel in 16th century both for nobleman and ordinary people within the castle. It is devoted to St Bernardin. This chapel was the parish church from 1521 until the building of the church of St Cross in 1781. Today, only the altar has been preserved.

=== Saint Rocco Chapel ===
This chapel was built at the entrance to the town in the first half of 19th century as a votive church against cholera.

===Frankopan Castle ===

The Castle was built between 1493 and 1500 above the gorge of the River Dobra - Đula&#x27;s abyss. The founder of the town was Bernardin Frankopan, one of the mightiest people of his time, and the feudal master of Modruš, Plaški, Vitunj, Tounj, Zvečaj, Bosiljevo, Novigrad and Dubovac. The Frankopans resided in the castle until 1533, when it was relinquished to the soldiers of the Military Frontier.

It belongs to the period of Renaissance castles. The town walls surrounded the courtyard area on three sides, while on the fourth there was a three-storey building with towers at the sides.

On 23 May 1941, the Ustaše raided Gornje Dubrave and carried away 29 of its residents, including the priest, railway workers, farmers, teachers and the innkeeper. Only a male and female teacher ever returned. The female teacher was raped in the Ogulin castle and was subsequently sent off to the Psychiatric Hospital &quot;Sveti Ivan&quot; in Stenjevec.

From 28 May through 1 June, about 70 figures from Ogulin and the surrounding area were arrested and imprisoned in the tower. Some at their homes, but most at the market or returning from it. This was in connection with a visit of Lovre Sušić to Ogulin, ostensibly for his security. Those imprisoned included the following better-known Serbs: doctor Živanović, the priest Ilija Đurčić, professors Papjevski, Stanislav Kepljevski and Grga Hećimović, students Đuro Tatalović and Žarko Momčilović, retired &quot;županijski podvornik&quot; Borojević, forest engineer Nestorović, forester Grozdanić, carpenters Đuro Tatalović and Milan Agbaba, surveyor Vlado Bijelić, store manager Bata Mićo Matijević, merchants Miloš Vuksan, Vladimir Bosnić, Ilija Ivošević, Nikola Manojlović and Vladimir Mrvoš, judge Marinko Đurić, Vlado Papić, Ivica Stošić and some others. Numerous first and second hand accounts survive.

=== The County Museum ===
The County Museum of Ogulin was opened in July 1967 in several of the Frankopan Castle halls that were being renovated and prepared between 1960 and 1967. At the time of opening it hosted a collection of works related to the workers movement, and NOB, while today it is hosting collections of various kinds: collection of stone monuments, collection of Croatian War of Independence, ethnographic collection, the memorial room of Ivana Brlić-Mažuranić (a renowned Croatian fairy-tale author), mountaineering, archaeological collection, Cell number 6, and an exhibition of the academic painter Stjepan Galetić born in Ogulin. The museum also collects objects related to old crafts and trades, old weaponry, old photographs, and the collection of postcards and greeting cards.

Considering that the County Museum of Ogulin is the only museum in the entire area between the cities of Rijeka and Karlovac, it is the only institution that works on preserving the valuable cultural and historic heritage of that wider area, and as such its task is to collect, process, present and publish the historical and cultural works, documents, and other artistic artefacts from the area of Ogulin and its neighbouring areas.

===King Tomislav Monument ===

The monument was erected in 1925, for the 1000th anniversary of the founding of the Croatian kingdom. It stands in the Park of King Tomislav which was planned and arranged in the 18th century. The monument was made according to the design of the Slovenian architect Vitburg Meck, and was repaired in 1990.

=== Cesarovac Fountain ===
This classic building is also erected in the Park. It represents a memorial to the Ogulin aqueduct and was built by colonel Stevan Šuplikac from Ogulin in 1847. Water flowed from the spring through wooden tubes which were lately replaced by the clay, and in 1882 by the iron tubes. For Cesarovac source is connected and a legend. Water flows into the source, comes from a source located at the foot of the mountain Klek. And as on the mountain Klek lived a witch, so the water is magical. Legend says, that women who drink the water from the springs, will remain forever young. And men who drink water from springs, water will be captured to forever remain in this city, who you will fall in love with a woman from Ogulin, and by the end of life remain to live in Ogulin.

<text>Never Apologise Never Explain is the eighth full-length album by the rock band Therapy?, and the second to be released on Spitfire Records. It was released on 27 September 2004. The album was recorded in June 2004 at Parkgate Studios, Hastings.

&quot;Never Apologise Never Explain&quot; marked a return to the claustrophobic sound of the band&#x27;s early releases. It failed to chart in the Top 200 of the UK Albums Chart. The album was not released in North America.

The album was released on CD only. A limited edition CD-ROM of the album contains two live videos (&quot;Teethgrinder&quot; &amp; &quot;Who Knows&quot;) from the &quot;Scopophobia&quot; DVD.

Polish label Metal Mind Productions re-released the album on 2 November 2009. The album was remastered using 24-Bit technology, limited to 1000 copies, on a gold disk digipak CD.

The originator of this commonly used phrase, often attributed to members of the House of Windsor (British Royalty), Duke of Wellington, Benjamin Disraeli and others, is said to be John Arbuthnot Fisher, a notable British Admiral of the Victorian and Edwardian era. (&quot;Boldness has genius, power and magic in it ... Never contradict. Never explain. Never apologise&quot;).
And even earlier, King Charles I of England is quoted in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations as writing &quot;Never make a defence or apology before you be accused&quot;, in a letter to Lord Wentworth as long ago as 1636.

<text>VidFIRE (an abbreviation of &quot;video field interpolation restoration effect&quot;) is a technology intended to restore the video-like motion of footage originally shot with television cameras that have been converted to formats with telerecording as their basis. The word is both a noun and a verb; in a sense, it is the opposite of filmizing, which makes video look like film.

== Background ==
Film recorded for the purposes of United Kingdom television production is usually recorded at 25 frames per second; there is an unrecorded temporal gap between each frame and the next. In contrast, video pictures are recorded as a stream of video fields. Each field can be loosely seen as half a frame, but each field is also a discrete image separated from the previous field by 1/50 second. This difference in the rate of change of the image is one of the factors contributing to the &quot;video look&quot;, familiar to viewers as the more immediate, &quot;live&quot; feel seen in many soap operas and sports programmes.

When videotape technology was first created in the 1950s, tapes were extremely costly; but their reusability meant that the cost of a single tape could be spread across several productions, with each successive production erasing and then reusing the tape from a previous one, with the result that relatively few programmes produced on videotape in the 1950s and 1960s still exist in their original format.

The expense of videotape and the various mutually incompatible television standards around the world made it impractical at the time for programme makers to sell their productions to foreign broadcasters in their original video form. Film, however, was considered a universal medium, and most broadcasters had the facility to broadcast from it. Before the development of practical video tape, programme makers such as the BBC developed the technology to record programmes—either live or for prerecording—from specially adapted monitors with a film camera. The resulting film recordings are called &quot;telerecordings&quot; in the UK and &quot;kinescopes&quot; in the United States and Australia.

Programmes often were copied in this way for rebroadcast or overseas sale before the original videotapes were reused. Most live- and videotape-originated television from this era exists today only as film recordings. However, the film recording system &quot;locks&quot; two video fields, previously separated by 1/50 second, into a single film frame. When the film is played back, the original video-like motion is lost.

==Restoring the video look==
VidFIRE was developed by Peter Finklestone to address the motion differences caused by the telerecording process. It uses motion estimation software to create an intermediate image, which exists temporally between two film frames. For example, if all frames of a twenty-five-minute film recording were processed, the result would be double the amount of frames and a new running length of fifty minutes. Playback at this stage (at 25 frame/s) gives smooth movement at half speed, due to the presence of interpolated images.

The programme is then further processed by interlacing adjacent frames, which halves the running time back to the original twenty-five minutes. The final result is video with fifty fields per second, alternate fields being sourced from the original film frame or the new interpolated image respectively. This has the effect of restoring the &quot;video look&quot; to the production.

==Limitations==
Depending on the quality of the film stock and how carefully the film was stored and handled in the years since it was first recorded, film recordings can be very grainy, dirty and scratched. The appearance of these film artefacts on the processed programme would break the illusion that the viewer is watching a videotape recording. Therefore, to maintain the VidFIRE effect it is imperative the image be as clean and stable as possible. The best available copy of the film-recorded programme should be used, preferably the original camera negative. Before processing, the film should be cleaned, digitally noise-reduced, and repaired.

A further, self-imposed limitation is that VidFIRE is used only to process material that originally was produced using video cameras. There is no technical reason why film-originated material cannot be processed, but it is not considered to be &quot;in the spirit&quot; of restoration. It is also possible that the difference in lighting and picture balance on film may mean the final processed images look subjectively &quot;wrong&quot;.

==Commercial use for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes==
The Doctor Who Restoration Team routinely VidFIREs 1960s episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; when preparing them for release on DVD. The process has also been applied to a number of other programmes, including two previously lost episodes of the BBC sitcom &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, which were rediscovered in 2001. The episodes, &quot;Operation Kilt&quot; and &quot;The Battle of Godfrey&#x27;s Cottage,&quot; were VidFIREd in preparation for their broadcast as part of a &quot;&quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; evening&quot; on BBC Two. The remainder of series one and two of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; was later processed and released on DVD. Episodes of &quot;Sykes&quot; and &quot;Public Eye&quot; have also been treated for DVD.

A few 1960s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes, all starring William Hartnell, did not undergo the VidFIRE process: Part One of &quot;The Crusade&quot; - &quot;The Lion&quot;, and parts 1-4 of &quot;The Time Meddler&quot; were not processed because it was deemed that the damage to the films rendered the video effect unconvincing. (In the case of &quot;The Time Meddler&quot; the damage was confined to part 4 &quot;Checkmate&quot; but the remaining episodes were left untreated also to match on DVD.). All were finally given the process in 2022 for the Season Two Blu-ray boxset.

An easter egg included on the DVD release of &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; featured a brief clip from that serial with VidFIRE processing applied. This was an experiment by the Doctor Who Restoration Team to see how well VidFIRE would survive the MPEG-2 encoding process. The experiment demonstrated that the VidFIRE illusion was not diminished by MPEG encoding and so the next relevant DVD release, &quot;The Aztecs&quot;, was VidFIREd in its entirety. &quot;The Tomb of The Cybermen&quot; has since been re-issued on DVD in entirely VidFIREd form as part of the &quot;Revisitations 3&quot; box set.

A slightly revised version of the process, with an improved motion-estimation engine, was first used on the BBC&#x27;s 2005 DVD release of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (as part of &quot;The Quatermass Collection&quot;) and then on all subsequent relevant &quot;Doctor Who&quot; DVD releases.

The 1970s Doctor Who serials to have undergone the VidFIRE process are: &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot;, &quot;The Ambassadors of Death&quot; (episodes 2–7; episode 1 remains on original 2-inch tape), &quot;Inferno&quot;, &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot;, &quot;The Mind of Evil&quot;, &quot;The Claws of Axos&quot; (only Episodes 2 and 3), &quot;The Daemons&quot; (only episodes 1-3 and 5), &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot; (only episode 3) and &quot;Invasion of the Dinosaurs&quot; (only episode 1).

Beyond this, the technique (although critically applauded) has seen relatively little exposure, perhaps because of a belief within the broadcasting industry that public interest in the kind of archive television that would benefit from VidFIRE is insufficient to justify the cost of processing.
