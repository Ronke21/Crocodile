<text>Community organizing is a process where people who live in proximity to each other or share some common problem come together into an organization that acts in their shared self-interest. Unlike those who promote more-consensual community building, community organizers generally assume that social change necessarily involves conflict and social struggle in order to generate collective power for the powerless. Community organizing has as a core goal the generation of &quot;durable&quot; power for an organization representing the community, allowing it to influence key decision-makers on a range of issues over time. In the ideal, for example, this can get community-organizing groups a place at the table &quot;before&quot; important decisions are made. Community organizers work with and develop new local leaders, facilitating coalitions and assisting in the development of campaigns. A central goal of organizing is the development of a robust, organized, local democracy bringing community members together across differences to fight together for the interests of the community.

==Types of community organizing==

Community organizers attempt to influence government, corporations, and institutions, increase direct representation within decision-making bodies, and foster general social reform more generally. Where negotiations fail, these organizations quickly seek to inform others outside of the organization of the issues being addressed and expose or pressure the decision-makers through a variety of means, including picketing, boycotting, sit-ins, petitioning, and electoral politics. Organizing groups often seek out issues they know will generate controversy and conflict. This allows them to draw in and educate participants, build commitment, and establish a reputation for advancing local justice.

Community organizers generally seek to build groups that are democratic in governance, open and accessible to community members, and concerned with the general health of a specific interest group, rather than the community as a whole. In addition, community organizing seeks to broadly empower community members,through mobilizing efforts, with the end goal of &quot;distributing&quot; power and resources more equally between the community members and external political and social figures of power. When adapting the goal of community empowerment, organizers recognize the uneven distribution of material and social resources within society as the root cause of the community&#x27;s issues. The process of creating empowerment starts with admitting that power gaps and resource inequalities exist in society and affects an individual&#x27;s personal life. Though community organizers share the goal of community empowerment, community organizing itself is defined and understood in a variety ways. There are different approaches to community organizing. These include:

* Feminist organizing. However, feminist organizing can sometimes lean away from the conflictual vision of organizing to the point that it may not belong in the same category.
* Faith-based community organizing (FBCO) which brings together religious institutions. The Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF) under Edward T. Chambers (deeply informed by the work of Ernesto Cortes and developed through a document originally drafted by Dick Harmon) was the classic early example of this. The IAF as well as the Gamaliel Foundation, Faith in Action, and the Direct Action and Research Training Center are or were national or regional umbrella groups organized at one point around this approach.
* Broad-based organizing, which emerged out of FBCO, reflecting the inclusion of a broader range of institutions and groups beyond religious ones. Parts of the IAF were early movers in this direction.
* A range of forms of neighborhood-based organizing that either organizes individuals or creates new &quot;from scratch&quot; kinds of organizations. This can include:
** Doorknocking, where organizers go door to door and draw individuals into an organization. ACORN is a key example of an organization using this approach.
** Block-club organizing, where blocks (two sides of a street on a block) are organized into a club or sometimes tenants in a building are organized. Tom Gaudette and Shel Trapp were very involved in developing this approach. Generally the block-club model also includes higher level forms of organization (street clubs, larger areas) because block clubs alone were felt not to form a strong foundation for organizing. Organization for a Better Austin and the Chatham-Avalon Park Community Council in Chicago and many of the organizations developed by Shel Trapp for National People&#x27;s Action, including those in Cleveland, were good examples.
** House meetings, where a series of house meetings are held in a community, leading to a community congress to form an organization. This approach was developed by Fred Ross. The Community Service Organization (CSO) was a good example, and a similar approach was used by the Cesar Chavez (who was an organizer in the CSO) in the United Farm Workers.
** An &quot;Organic&quot; approach, where problems are located across a particular community and then people are organized around these problems locally, and then leaders are brought together in a larger organization. The Northwest Community Organization in Chicago, developed by Tom Gaudette and the early (and to some extent current) Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement were examples of this approach
** Coalition building. National Peoples Action was a good example of this (now called People&#x27;s Action).

Because of its focus on &quot;local&quot; issues and relationships between members, individual groups generally prioritize relatively local community interests by focusing on local issues. There has been an attempt to build a general community organizing practice model that ties the different types of community organizing together despite their differences. Scholars Shane R. Brady and Mary Katherine O&#x27;Connor construct a starting point for a general practice model, a model that defines community organizing as its own field of practice; however, this model depends on existing practice models adapted by the different types of community organizing. For example, FBCOs and many grassroots organizing models use the &quot;social action approach&quot;, which is built on the work of Saul Alinsky from the 1930s into the 1970s. By contrast, feminist organizing follows a &quot;community-building approach,&quot; which emphasizes raising consciousness to support the community&#x27;s empowerment.

===Grassroots action===
Grassroots organizing is distinctive for its bottom-up approach to organizing. Grassroots organizers build community groups from scratch, developing new leadership where none existed and organizing the unorganized. This type of organizing uses a process where people collectively act in the interest of their communities and the common good. According to scholar Brian D. Christens, grassroots organizing focuses on building and maintaining interpersonal relationships between their community members. Building social relationships allow community members to build collaborative skills, deliberative skills to handle conflict, and strengthen civil engagement. Some networks of community organizations that employ this method and support local organizing groups include National People&#x27;s Action and ACORN. Although efforts in grassroots organizing are significant in marginalized communities, it is specifically popular among marginalized communities of color.

&quot;Door-knocking&quot; grassroots organizations like ACORN organize poor and working-class members recruiting members one by one in the community. Because they go door-to-door, they are able to reach beyond established organizations and the &quot;churched&quot; to bring together a wide range of less privileged people. FBCOs have tended to organize more middle-class people, because their institutional membership is generally drawn from the mainline denominations. ACORN tended to stress the importance of constant action in order to maintain the commitment of a less rooted group of participants. ACORN and other neighborhood-based groups like the Organization for a Better Austin had a reputation of being more forceful than faith-based (FBCO) groups, in part because they needed to continually act to keep their non-institutionalized members engaged, and there are indications that their local groups were more staff (organizer) directed than the leader (local volunteer) directed. (However, the same can be said for many forms of organizing, including FBCOs.) The &quot;door-knocking&quot; approach is more time-intensive than the &quot;organization of organizations&quot; approach of FBCOs and requires more organizers who, partly as a result, can be lower paid with more turnover. Unlike the existing FBCO national &quot;umbrella&quot; and other grassroots organizations, ACORN maintains a centralized national agenda and exerts some centralized control over local organizations. Because ACORN USA was a 501(c)4 organization under the tax code, it was able to participate directly in election activities, but contributions to it were not tax-exempt.

==== Limitations to grassroots organizing ====
Grassroots organizing is vulnerable, being dependent on the support of more powerful people; its goals can be easily thwarted. Because grassroots organizing focuses on building relationships within the community, scholars note that grassroots community organizing can be passive and depoliticizing. This approach to building community empowerment does not aim for a specific political or social goal. In other words, building relationships do not always directly confront institutions, though it might challenge an individual&#x27;s views through one-on-one conversations with other individuals in the community.

=== Feminist community organizing ===
Feminist organizing, also known as women&#x27;s community organizing, is community organizing with a feminist motivation. The goals of feminist organizing include: increasing women&#x27;s employment opportunities; improving women&#x27;s physical and mental well-being; and, raising consciousness. Organizers prioritize raising consciousness for women to understand how their personal struggles are interconnected with societal inequalities. While women have participated in grassroots organizing, the characteristics of feminism distinguish feminist organizing from other forms of grassroots organizing.

==== Community-building in feminist organizing ====
Feminists want to break down racial and gendered boundaries and promote unity among women. Feminist organizing focuses on building relationships within the community, seeing such relationships as a prerequisite for raising consciousness. This type of organizing is called the community-building approach, which is the opposite of the social action (Alinsky) approach (where the focus is on challenging social and political inequalities that impact the community). The community-building approach depends on the participation and collaboration of both community organizers and community members. This eliminates the power difference between an organizer and participants. Therefore, the community-building approach supports the belief that power rests in the community and community empowerment is the process of building that power.

Scholars Catherine P. Bradshaw et al. states that feminist organizers believe power is not quantifiable, and that power is created, rather than distributed. The hierarchical relationship between organizer and participant is broken down also by facilitating decision-making among community members rather than just by community leaders. To build relationships among community members, feminist organizers encourage sharing personal experiences. Feminist organizers believe that this forms a sense of interconnectedness and trust among community members which is important in the community organizing process. The shift to community building was also caused by external forces, rather than just feminist organizer&#x27;s motivations. During 1980s, the rising neoliberal agenda caused many community organizers to shift to the community-building approach.

==== Limitations to feminist organizing ====
Some feminists argue that feminist community organizing can disregard the racial and capability diversity among women. In the process of pushing for unity among women, feminist organizers are inclined to disregard the benefits of diversity. Economist Marilyn Power uses the term &quot;homogenous category&quot; to highlight the problem of masking racial diversity, while sociologist Akwugo Emejulu uses the concept of essentialism (reducing women to their gender stereotypes) to highlight the capabilities limitation. Though feminist organizers&#x27; intentions are to recognize women&#x27;s diversity through unity, some are concerned that the vision of unity eclipses a diverse reality.

There are studies that speculate that these limitations are caused by feminism&#x27;s emergence from a Eurocentric perspective. Historically, European American feminists delegitimize the racial difference of women. In addition, European American feminists delegitimize women who do not follow the traditional gender norms influenced by white domestic middle class womanhood. Currently, feminist organizing focuses on addressing gender inequalities, which means only the problems of women who follow and are impacted by gender norms will be addressed. Feminist organizing becomes counterproductive for those who do follow gender norms. Psychologist Lorraine Gutierrez claims that feminist organizing disregards problems that are larger than the scope of gender norms. This negatively impacts women empowerment because it is the diversity that motivates women to mobilize.

===Faith-based===

Faith-based community organizing (FBCO), also known as Congregation-based Community Organizing, is a methodology for developing power and relationships throughout a community of institutions: today mostly congregations, but these can also include unions, neighborhood associations, and other groups. Progressive and centrist FBCO organizations unite around basic values derived from common aspects of their faith instead of around strict dogmas. There are now at least 180 FBCOs in the US as well as in South Africa, England, Germany, and other nations. Local FBCO organizations are often linked through organizing networks such as the Industrial Areas Foundation, Gamaliel Foundation, PICO National Network, and Direct Action and Research Training Center (DART). In the United States starting in 2001, the Bush administration launched a department to promote community organizing that included faith-based organizing as well other community groups.

FBCOs tend to have mostly middle-class participants because the congregations involved are generally mainline Protestant and Catholic (although &quot;middle-class&quot; can mean different things in white communities and communities of color, which can lead to class tensions within these organizations). Holiness, Pentecostal, and other related denominations (often &quot;storefront&quot;) churches with mostly poor and working-class members tend not to join FBCOs because of their focus on &quot;faith&quot; over &quot;works,&quot; among other issues. FBCOs have increasingly expanded outside impoverished areas into churches where middle-class professionals predominate in an effort to expand their power to contest inequality.

Because of their &quot;organization of organizations&quot; approach, FBCOs can organize large numbers of members with a relatively small number of organizers that generally are better paid and more professionalized than those in &quot;door-knocking&quot; groups like ACORN. FBCOs focus on the long-term development of a culture and common language of organizing and on the development of relational ties between members. They are more stable during fallow periods than grassroots groups because of the continuing existence of member churches. FBCOs are 501(c)3 organizations. Contributions to them are tax exempt. As a result, while they can conduct campaigns over &quot;issues&quot; they cannot promote the election of specific individuals.

==== Faith-based community and digital transformation ==== 

The way in which faith based communities FBCOs organize has undergone a dramatic change with the introduction of digital technology. In &quot;Digitally Enabled Social Change: Activism in the Internet Age&quot;, authors Earl and Kimport (2011) provide valuable insights into this shift – namely how decreased costs associated with &#x27;Taking Action on the Cheap&#x27; have opened up greater opportunities for involvement in religious initiatives or movements. Digital tools allow faith based groups to spread their message further, better coordinate collective actions across distances and mobilize supporters in unprecedented ways – greatly democratizing this kind of organizing effort. However, this transition to digital also poses complex challenges that must be addressed on topics such as community identity and collective action – as noted by Earl and Kimport themselves in their book.

===Broad-based===
Broad-based organizations intentionally recruit member institutions that are both secular and religious. Congregations, synagogues, temples and mosques are joined by public schools, non-profits, and labor and professional associations. Organizations of the Industrial Areas Foundation are explicitly broad-based and dues-based. Dues-based membership allows IAF organizations to maintain their independence; organizations are politically non-partisan and do not pursue or accept government funding. Broad-based organizations aim to teach institutional leaders how to build relationships of trust across racial, faith, economic and geographic lines through individual, face-to-face meetings. Other goals include internally strengthening the member institutions by developing the skills and capacities of their leaders and creating a vehicle for ordinary families to participate in the political process. The Industrial Areas Foundation sees itself as a &quot;university of public life&quot; teaching citizens the democratic process in the fullest sense.

===Power versus protest===
While community organizing groups often engage in protest actions designed to force powerful groups to respond to their demands, protest is only one aspect of the activity of organizing groups. To the extent that groups&#x27; actions generate a sense in the larger community that they have &quot;power,&quot; they are often able to engage with and influence powerful groups through dialogue, backed up by a history of successful protest-based campaigns. Similar to the way unions gain recognition as the representatives of workers for a particular business, community organizing groups can gain recognition as key representatives of particular communities. In this way, representatives of community organizing groups are often able to bring key government officials or corporate leaders to the table without engaging in &quot;actions&quot; because of their reputation. As Alinsky said, &quot;the first rule of power tactics&quot; is that &quot;power is not only what you have but what the enemy thinks you have.&quot; The development of durable &quot;power&quot; and influence is a key aim of community organizing.

&quot;Rights-based&quot; community organizing, in which municipal governments are used to exercise community power, was first experimented with by the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF.org) in Pennsylvania, beginning in 2002. Community groups are organized to influence municipal governments to enact local ordinances. These ordinances challenge preemptive state and federal laws that forbid local governments from prohibiting corporate activities deemed harmful by community residents. The ordinances are drafted specifically to assert the rights of &quot;human and natural communities,&quot; and include provisions that deny the legal concepts of &quot;corporate personhood&quot; and &quot;corporate rights&quot;. Since 2006, they have been drafted to include the recognition of legally enforceable rights for &quot;natural communities and ecosystems&quot;.

Although this type of community organizing focuses on the adoption of local laws, the intent is to demonstrate the use of governing authority to protect community rights and expose the misuse of governing authority to benefit corporations. As such, the adoption of rights-based municipal ordinances is not a legal strategy, but an organizing strategy. Courts predictably deny the legal authority of municipalities to legislate in defiance of state and federal law. Corporations and government agencies that initiate legal actions to overturn these ordinances have been forced to argue in opposition to the community&#x27;s right to make governing decisions on issues with harmful and direct local impact.

The first rights-based municipal laws prohibited corporations from monopolizing horticulture (factory farming), and banned corporate waste dumping within municipal jurisdictions. More recent rights-based organizing, in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Maine, Virginia and California has prohibited corporate mining, large-scale water withdrawals and chemical trespass. A similar attempt was made by Denton, Texas to restrict fracking was initially successful, but then overturned and further legislation passed to prevent Texas communities from enacting similar bans.

===Political orientations===
Community organizing is not solely the domain of progressive politics, as dozens of fundamentalist organizations are in operation, such as the Christian Coalition. However, the term &quot;community organizing&quot; generally refers to more progressive organizations, as evidenced, for example, by the reaction against community organizing in the 2008 US presidential election by Republicans and conservatives both online and offline.

===Fundraising===
Organizing groups often struggle to find resources. They rarely receive funding from government since their activities often seek to contest government policies. Foundations and others who usually fund service activities generally don&#x27;t understand what organizing groups do or how they do it, or shy away from their contentious approaches. The constituency of progressive and centrist organizing groups is largely low- or middle- income, so they are generally unable to support themselves through dues. In search of resources, some organizing groups have accepted funding for direct service activities in the past. As noted below, this has frequently led these groups to drop their conflictual organizing activities, in part because these threatened funding for their &quot;service&quot; arms.

Recent studies have shown, however, that funding for community organizing can produce large returns on investment ($512 in community benefits to $1 of Needmor funding, according to the Needmor Fund Study, $157 to 1 in New Mexico and $89 to 1 in North Carolina according to National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy studies) through legislation and agreements with corporations, among other sources, not including non-fiscal accomplishments.

== What community organizing is not ==
Understanding what community organizing &quot;is&quot; can be aided by understanding what it &quot;is not&quot; from the perspective of community organizers.

*Activism: According to Edward Chambers, community organizing is distinguishable from activism if activists engage in social protest without a coherent strategy for building power or for making specific social changes.
*Mobilizing: When people &quot;mobilize&quot;, they get together to effect a specific social change but have no long-term plan. When the particular campaign that mobilized them is over, these groups dissolve and durable power is not built.
*Advocacy: Advocates generally speak for others who are deemed (often incorrectly) unable to represent their own interests due to disability, inherent complexity of the venue such as courts and hospitals, or other factors. Community organizing emphasizes the virtue of having those affected to speak for themselves.
*Social movement building: A broad social movement often encompasses diverse collections of individual activists, local and national organizations, advocacy groups, multiple and often conflicting spokespersons, and more, held together by relatively common aims but not a common organizational structure. A community organizing group might be &quot;part&quot; of a &quot;movement.&quot; Movements generally dissolve when the motivating issue(s) are addressed, although organizations created during movements can continue and shift their focuses.
*Legal action: Lawyers are often quite important to those engaged in social action. The problem comes when a social action strategy is designed primarily around a lawsuit. When lawyers take the center stage, it can push grassroots struggle into the background, short circuiting the development of collective power and capacity. There are examples where community organizing groups and legal strategies have worked together well, however, including the &quot;Williams v. California&quot; lawsuit over inequality in k-12 education.
*Direct service: Americans today often equate civic engagement with direct service. Organizing groups usually avoid actually providing services, today, however, because history indicates that when they do, organizing for collective power is often left behind. Powerful groups often threaten the &quot;service&quot; wings of organizing groups in an effort to prevent collective action. In the nonprofit sector, there are many organizations that used to do community organizing but lost this focus in the shift to service.
*Community development: Consensual community development efforts to improve communities through a range of strategies, usually directed by educated professionals working in government, policy, non-profit, or business organizations, is not community organizing. Community development projects increasingly include a community participation component, and often seek to empower residents of impoverished areas with skills for collaboration and job training, among others. However, community development generally assumes that groups and individuals can work together collaboratively without significant conflict or struggles over power to solve community challenges. One currently popular form is asset-based community development that seeks out existing community strengths. The relationship between community organizing and community development is however more one of nuance than total difference. There is much community development literature and practice which is very similar to community organizing, see for example the international Community Development Journal. And certainly since the 1970s community development practitioners have been influenced by structural analyses of inequity and power distribution.
*Nonpartisan dialogues about community problems: A range of efforts create opportunities for people to meet together and engage in dialogue about community problems. Like community organizing, the effort in contexts like these is generally to be open to a diverse range of opinions, out of which some consensus may be reached. A study circle is an example. However, beyond the dialogue that also happens inside organizing groups, the focus is on generating a collective and singular &quot;voice&quot; in order to gain power and resources for the organization&#x27;s members as well as constituents in the broader community.
*Power gained and exerted in community organizing is also not the coercion applied by legal, illegal, physical, or economic means, such as those be applied by banks, syndicates, corporations, governments, or other institutions. Rather, organizing makes use of the voluntary efforts of a community&#x27;s members acting jointly to achieve an economic or other benefit. As opposed to commercial ventures, gains that result from community organizing automatically accrue to persons in similar circumstances who are not necessarily members, e.g. residents in a geographic area or in a similar socioeconomic status, or persons having conditions or circumstances in common who benefit from gains won by the organizing effort. This may include workers who benefit from a campaign affecting their industry, for example, or persons with disabilities who benefit from gains made in their legal or economic eligibility or status.

==History in the United States==

Robert Fisher and Peter Romanofsky have grouped the history of &quot;community organizing&quot; (also known as &quot;social agitation&quot;) in the United States into four rough periods:

===1880 to 1900===

People sought to meet the pressures of rapid immigration and industrialization by organizing immigrant neighborhoods in urban centers. Since the emphasis of the reformers was mostly on building community through settlement houses and other service mechanisms, the dominant approach was what Fisher calls social work. During this period the Newsboys Strike of 1899 provided an early model of youth-led organizing.

===1900 to 1940===
During this period, much of community organizing methodology was generated in Schools of Social Work, with a particular methodological focus grounded in the philosophy of John Dewey, which focused on experience, education, and other sociological concepts. This period saw much energy coming from those critical of capitalist doctrines as well. Studs Terkel documented community organizing in the depression era, such as that of Dorothy Day. Most organizations had a national orientation because the economic problems the nation faced did not seem possible to change at the neighborhood levels.

===1940 to 1960===
Saul Alinsky, based in Chicago, is credited with originating the term &quot;community organizer&quot; during this time period. Alinsky wrote &quot;Reveille for Radicals&quot;, published in 1946, and &quot;Rules for Radicals&quot;, published in 1971. With these books, Alinsky was the first person in America to codify key strategies and aims of community organizing.

The following excerpts from &quot;Reveille for Radicals&quot; give a sense of Alinsky&#x27;s organizing philosophy and of his style of public engagement:

:* &quot;A People&#x27;s Organization is a conflict group, [and] this must be openly and fully recognized. Its sole reason in coming into being is to wage war against all evils which cause suffering and unhappiness. A People&#x27;s Organization is the banding together of large numbers of men and women to fight for those rights which insure a decent way of life...&quot;

:* &quot;A People&#x27;s Organization is dedicated to an eternal war. It is a war against poverty, misery, delinquency, disease, injustice, hopelessness, despair, and unhappiness. They are basically the same issues for which nations have gone to war in almost every generation... War is not an intellectual debate, and in the war against social evils there are no rules of fair play...&quot;

:* &quot;A People&#x27;s Organization lives in a world of hard reality. It lives in the midst of smashing forces, dashing struggles, sweeping cross-currents, ripping passions, conflict, confusion, seeming chaos, the hot and the cold, the squalor and the drama, which people prosaically refer to as life and students describe as &quot;society.&quot;&quot;

In 1940, with the support of Roman Catholic Bishop Bernard James Sheil and Chicago Sun-Times publisher Marshall Field, Alinsky founded the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF). The mandate of the national community organizing network was to partner with religious congregations and civic organizations to build &quot;broad-based organizations&quot; that could train up local leadership and promote trust across community divides.

After Alinsky died in 1972, Edward T. Chambers became the IAF&#x27;s executive director. Hundreds of professional community and labor organizers and thousands of community and labor leaders have been trained at its workshops. Fred Ross, who worked for Alinsky, was the principal mentor for Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. Other organizations following in the tradition of the Congregation-based Community Organizing pioneered by IAF include PICO National Network, Gamaliel Foundation, Brooklyn Ecumenical Cooperatives, founded by former IAF trainer, Richard Harmon and Direct Action and Research Training Center (DART).

===1960 to present===

In the 1960s the New Left (beginning with Students for a Democratic Society) tried their hand at community organizing. They were critical of what they conceived of as Alinsky&#x27;s &quot;dead-end local activism&quot;. But the dispiriting reality was that however much they might talk about &quot;transforming the system,&quot; &quot;building alternative institutions,&quot; and &quot;revolutionary potential&quot;, their credibility on the doorstep rested on their ability to secure concessions from, and therefore to develop relations with, the local power structures. Community organizing appeared to trap the radical activists in &quot;a politics of adjustment&quot;. By the beginning of the 1970s most of the New Left groups had vacated their store-front offices.

Nonetheless, the Civil Rights Movement, anti-war protest, ethnic mobilizations, women&#x27;s liberation, and the struggle for gay rights all influenced, and were influenced by, ideas of neighborhood organizing. Experience with federal anti-poverty programs and the upheavals in the cities produced a thoughtful response among activists and theorists in the early 1970s that has informed activities, organizations, strategies and movements through the end of the century. Less dramatically, civic association and neighborhood block clubs were formed all across the country to foster community spirit and civic duty, as well as provide a social outlet.

====Loss of urban communities====
During these decades, the emergence of an ongoing process of white flight, the ability of middle-class white Americans to move out of majority Black areas, and the professionalization of community organizations into 501(c)3 nonprofits, among other issues, increasingly dissolved the tight ethnic and racial communities that had been so prevalent in urban areas during the first part of the century. As a result, community organizers began to move away from efforts to mobilize existing communities and towards efforts to &quot;create&quot; community, fostering relationships between community members. While community organizers like Alinsky had long worked with churches, these trends led to an increasing focus on congregational organizing during the 1980s, as organizing groups rooted themselves in one of the few remaining broad-based community institutions. This shift also led to an increased focus on relationships among religion, faith, and social struggle.

====Emergence of national organizing support organizations====
A collection of training and support organizations for national coalitions of mostly locally governed and mostly FBCO community organizing groups were founded in the Alinsky tradition. The Industrial Areas Foundation was the first, created by Alinsky himself in 1940. The other key organizations include ACORN, PICO National Network, Direct Action and Research Training Center, and the Gamaliel Foundation. The role of the organizer in these organizations was &quot;professionalized&quot; to some extent and resources were sought so that being an organizer could be more of a long-term career than a relatively brief, mostly unfunded interlude. The training provided by these national &quot;umbrella&quot; organizations helps local volunteer leaders learn a common &quot;language&quot; about organizing while seeking to expand the skills of organizers.

====Examples of community organizers====
Many of the most notable leaders in community organizing today emerged from the National Welfare Rights Organization. John Calkins of DART, Wade Rathke of ACORN, John Dodds of Philadelphia Unemployment Project and Mark Splain of the AFL–CIO, among others. There have been many other notable community organizers through the decades: Mark Andersen, Ella Baker, Heather Booth, César Chávez, Lois Gibbs, Mother Jones, Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Nader, Huey P. Newton, Barack Obama, and Paul Wellstone.

====Youth organizing====
More recently has come the emergence of youth organizing groups around the country. These groups use neo-Alinsky strategies while also usually providing social and sometimes material support to less-privileged youth. Most of these groups are created by and directed by youth or former youth organizers.

====2008 presidential election====
Prior to his entry into politics, President Barack Obama worked as an organizer for a Gamaliel Foundation FBCO organization in Chicago. Marshall Ganz, former lieutenant of César Chávez, adapted techniques from community organizing for Obama&#x27;s 2008 presidential election.
At the 2008 Republican National Convention, former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani questioned Obama&#x27;s role as a community organizer, asking the crowd &quot;What does a community organizer actually do?&quot;, and was answered with resounding applause. This was seconded by the vice presidential nominee, Alaska governor Sarah Palin, who stated that her experience as the mayor of Wasilla, Alaska was &quot;sort of like being a community organizer, except that you have actual responsibilities.&quot; In response, some progressives, such as Congressman Steve Cohen (D-TN) and liberal pundit Donna Brazile, started saying that &quot;Jesus was a community organizer, Pontius Pilate was a governor&quot;, a phrase produced on bumper stickers and elsewhere. Pontius Pilate was the Roman Prefect who ordered the execution of Jesus.

After Obama&#x27;s election in 2008, the campaign organization &quot;Obama for America,&quot; became &quot;Organizing for America,&quot; and has been placed under the auspices of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Organizing for America sought to advance the president&#x27;s legislative agenda and played an important role in building grassroots support for The Affordable Health Care Act. After the 2012 election, OFA went through another transition and is now called Organizing for Action. This 501(c)4 organization focuses on training people to be community organizers and working on local and national progressive issues such as climate change, immigration reform and marriage equality.

==History in the United Kingdom==

===TCC (Trefnu Cymunedol Cymru / Together Creating Communities)===

TCC (Trefnu Cymunedol Cymru / Together Creating Communities) is the oldest community organising group in the UK, founded in 1995. TCC is an institutional membership organisation; members include community groups, faith groups, and schools, from across North East Wales (Wrexham, Flintshire, and Denbighshire). As a broad-based alliance, TCC brings communities together for action on local, regional, and national issues. 
TCC is remarkable in community organising in that its area of operation includes a diverse geographical region, including many rural areas, and is notably not based in a city.

TCC has had success with a number of campaigns over the last 25 years. This includes getting several employers (including the Welsh Assembly) to pay the Living Wage, improving Muslim women&#x27;s access to leisure facilities, making Wales the world&#x27;s first Fairtrade nation, improving British Sign Language provision for Deaf young people, getting a Parkinson&#x27;s nurse to be based in North East Wales, getting a local authority to recycle instead of building an incinerator, and getting a homeless shelter for Wrexham.

In 2019, TCC&#x27;s Stop School Hunger / Dysgu Nid Llwgu campaign led to the Welsh Government committing funding so that the poorest pupils in Wales will be able to afford breakfast as well as lunch at school. TCC runs an ongoing programme of community organising training for adults and young people. Community leaders from TCC&#x27;s diverse membership work together to actively engage in democracy and decision making, holding regular accountability meetings ahead of elections and building ongoing relationships with power holders.

=== Community Organisers (CO) programme, 2011–2015 ===
In 2010 the Conservative/Liberal Democrat Coalition Government pledged as part of its commitment to the Big Society to train a new generation of Community Organisers (CO) programme. This policy aim sat alongside a number of other policy objectives including The Localism Act all of which were designed to give new powers to communities to take great control over their neighbourhoods, services and assets. The Cabinet Office commissioned Ipsos MORI and NEF Consulting to conduct the evaluation of the CO programme. Evaluation work began in October 2012 and the main report, published in December 2015, summarises the final assessment of the programme.

=== Community Organisers Expansion Programme (COEP), 2017–2020 ===
In March 2017, Community Organisers secured a major £4.2m contract from the Office for Civil Society, part of the Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS), to expand its movement of Community Organisers from 6,500 to 10,000 by 2020. The programme embeds community organising as part of the fabric of neighbourhoods across England and equips local people with the skills to transform their communities for good. It expands the community organising movement to include young people from the National Citizen Service (NCS) and ambassadors for the #iwill social action campaign for 10 to 20-year-olds. The programme has also established the National Academy of Community Organising to sustain the ongoing training of Community Organisers.

=== Community Organisers ===
A key commitment of the Community Organisers (CO) programme, was to build an independent legacy body that would sustain and develop Community Organising in England. Established in 2015, Community Organisers (originally known as COLtd) is the National Training and Membership body for Community Organisers in England, delivering accredited training. Community Organisers has also established he National Academy of Community Organising to provide training and support to people in community organising in the UK.

=== National Academy of Community Organising ===
The National Academy of Community Organising (NACO) provides quality assured training and Qualification courses in community organising. It is a network of affiliated local hubs of community organising known as Social Action Hubs. These organisations deliver our courses. There are currently 22 Social Action Hubs across England. They are locally rooted organisations committed to community organising who train and support people to develop their understanding and practice of community organising and to get involved in social action. Each Social Action Hub is unique and works in its own way to ignite social change through community organising, However, all of the Social Acton Hubs are quality assured by Community Organisers to offer our training courses

===London Citizens===
London Citizens began life in East London in 1996 as TELCO (the East London Communities Organisation) subsequently expanding to South London, West London and by 2011 into North London. London Citizens has a dues paying institutional membership of over 160 schools, churches, mosques, trade unions, synagogues and voluntary organisations. In the beginning, small actions were undertaken to prevent a factory from contaminating the area with noxious smells and prevent drug dealing in school neighbourhoods. Over time larger campaigns were undertaken. Before Mayoral elections for the Greater London Authority in 2000, 2004 and 2008 major Accountability Assemblies were held with the main mayoral candidates. They were asked to support London Citizens and work with them on issues such as London Living wage; an amnesty for undocumented migrants; safer cities initiatives and development of community land trust housing. South London Citizens held a citizens enquiry into the working of the Home Office department at Lunar House and its impact on the lives of refugees and migrants. This resulted in the building of a visitor centre.

===Citizens UK===
Citizens UK has been promoting community organising in the UK since 1989 and has established the profession of Community Organiser through the Guild of Community Organisers teaching the disciplines of strategy and politics. Neil Jameson, the executive director of Citizens UK, founded the organisation after training with the Industrial Areas Foundation in the USA. Citizens UK (formerly the Citizens Organising Foundation) established citizens groups in Liverpool, North Wales, the Black Country, Sheffield, Bristol, Milton Keynes and London. London Citizens&#x27; forerunner TELCO was formed in 1996. Milton Keynes Citizens began in 2010. The others had a brief and glorious start lasting roughly 3 years when COF was unable to finance them any longer. Manchester Changemakers was formed in 2007 and is independent of Citizens UK.

===Citizens UK campaigns===

===Citizens UK General Election Assembly===
In May 2010 Citizens UK held a General Election Assembly at the Methodist Central Hall Westminster with 2,500 people from member institutions and the world media present. This event was three days before the election and proved to be one of the most dynamic and electric events of the election campaign. Citizens UK had negotiated to have David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Gordon Brown as the leaders of the three main political parties attend. Each candidate for Prime Minister was questioned on stage concerning their willingness to work with Citizens UK if elected. Each undertook to work with Citizens UK and come to future assemblies to give account of work achieved. In particular they agreed to work to introduce the Living Wage and to end the practice of holding children of refugee families in detention.

====Living wage====
In 1994, the city of Baltimore passed the first living-wage law in the USA. This changed the working and living conditions of Baltimore&#x27;s low-wage service workers and established an example for other cities in the USA. In London it was a campaign launched in 2001 by London Citizens, the largest civil alliance in the Citizens UK network. The Living Wage Campaign calls for every worker in the country to earn enough to provide their family with the essentials of life. Launched by London Citizens in 2001, the campaign had by 2010 persuaded more than 100 employers to pay the Living wage and won over £40 million of Living Wages, lifting 6,500 families out of working poverty. The Living Wage is a number. An hourly rate, set independently, every year (by the Greater London Authority in London). It is calculated according to cost of living and gives the minimum pay rate required for a worker to provide their family with the essentials of life. In London the 2010–11 rate was £7.85 per hour. London is now being copied by other cities around the UK. As a result, Citizens UK set up the Living Wage Foundation in 2011 to provide companies with intelligence and accreditation. It also moderates the hourly rate applicable for the Living Wage outside London.

====People&#x27;s Olympic Legacy====
When London announced it would bid to be the host city for the Olympic Games in 2012, London citizens used their power to gain a lasting legacy for Londoners from the billions that was to be spent. Following on from hundreds of one-to-one meetings and a listening campaign across member institutions, in 2004 London Citizens signed an historic agreement with the London 2012 bid team, which set in stone precisely what the people of east London could expect in return for their support in hosting the Olympic Games. The People&#x27;s Promises, as they are known, demanded:
* 2012 permanently affordable homes for local people through a Community land trust and mutual home ownership;
* Money from the Olympic development to be set aside to improve local schools and the health service;
* University of East London to be main higher education beneficiary of the sports legacy and to consider becoming a Sports Centre of Excellence
* At least £2m set aside immediately for a Construction Academy to train up local people;
* That at least 30% of jobs are set aside for local people;
* That the Lower Lea Valley is designated a &#x27;Living Wage Zone&#x27; and all jobs guaranteed a living wage
The Olympic Delivery Authority, the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and the Olympic Legacy Company work with London Citizens to ensure that these promises are delivered.

====Independent Asylum Commission====
Citizens UK set up the Independent Asylum Commission in order to investigate widespread concern about the way refugees and asylum seekers were being treated by the UK Border Agency (now, UK Visas and Immigration). The report made a series of over 200 recommendations for change which are still being negotiated. This resulted in the ending of the practice of holding children of refugee families in detention by the Coalition government elected in 2010.

=== ACORN UK ===
ACORN UK was formed by 100 tenants supported by 3 staff organisers in Easton, Bristol in May 2014 who voted to organise for more security, better quality and more affordable housing. Two of the founding members were graduates of the Community Organisers programme. ACORN has since hired more staff and organised branches in Newcastle and recently Sheffield and the organisation involves 15,000 members. ACORN UK has combined online organising via social media with ACORNs traditional door-knocking approach, to organise transient private sector tenants. The group has also combined local direct-action &quot;member defence&quot; actions (including eviction resistances and picketing of rogue landlords/letting agents) with larger regional and national campaigns for housing rights (for example winning regional local authority support for including the standards of their &quot;ethical lettings charter&quot; in the regional West of England Rental Standard and persuading Santander bank to drop a buy to let mortgage clause requiring landlords to raise rents). They also worked alongside Generation Rent to register and mobilise the &quot;renters vote&quot; in the 2016 general election.

=== Living Rent ===
Living Rent is Scotland&#x27;s tenant union, also affiliated to ACORN International. The group formed out of the Living Rent campaign in 2015 and today has branches in Glasgow and Edinburgh and two organising staff.

===Political analysis===
Community organising in the UK is distinctive because it deliberately sets out to build permanent alliances of citizens to exercise power in society. The UK analysis is that to understand Society it is necessary to distinguish Civil Society from the State and the Market. In a totalitarian Society all three may virtually coincide. In a fully democratic society the three will be distinct. Where the state and the market become predominant, even in a democracy, civil society is reduced on the one hand to voting and volunteering and on the other to consuming. This is very dangerous for democracy because the sense of citizenship and agency becomes feeble and ineffective. In other words, Civil Society becomes powerless.
Community organising and the role of the professional Community Organiser is working out how to take back power from the State and the Market by holding them accountable. The state and the market cannot operate without moral values and direction. It is not the role of the state or the market to determine those values. In a democratic society there has to be a genuine public discourse concerning justice and the common good. Problems with the global banking system in 2008 in large part arose because &quot;light touch regulation&quot; meant that there was no underlying moral system. The market was left to its own devices with disastrous consequences for the global economy.

====Intermediate institutions====
Community organising works because it organises people and money through the institutions which have the potential to engage in the public discourse about what is the common good. These are the institutions which can mediate between the family and the State – such as faith organisations, cooperatives, schools, trades unions, universities and voluntary agencies. Community organising builds these institutions into permanent citizens membership alliances which work together to identify issues and agree ways of introducing solutions. Community organising teaches the art of non-partisan, democratic politics. Because community organising brings together diverse institutions which do not normally work together it is sometimes referred to as Broad Based community organising.

Community organising starts with the recognition that change can only come about when communities come together to compel public authorities and businesses to respond to the needs of ordinary people. It identifies and trains leaders in diverse communities, bringing them together to voice their needs and it organises campaigns to ensure that these needs are met.
&quot;Our answer is to organise people through the places where they have regular contact with their neighbours – faith institutions and workplaces and educational establishments. Our experience of practising broad based community organising across the UK has confirmed for us that the threads that once connected the individual to the family, the family to their community and the community to the wider society are fraying and in danger of breaking altogether. We believe these strands, connections and alliances are vital for a healthy democracy and should be the building blocks of any vibrant civil society.
We believe in building for power which is fundamentally reciprocal, where both parties are influenced by each other and mutual respect develops. The power and influence that we seek is tempered by our religious teachings and moral values and is exercised in the fluid and ever-changing relationship with our fellow leaders, allies and adversaries. We value and seek to operate in the public sphere. We believe that UK public life should be occupied not just by a few celebrities and politicians – but also by the people themselves seeking a part of the action.&quot;

===Institute for Community Organising===
Citizens UK set up the Institute for Community Organising (ICO) as part of its Centre for Civil Society established in 2010 in response to growing demands for its training. The ICO is the first operating division of the centre and was established to offer a series of training opportunities for those who wish to make community organising a full or part-time career and also for Community Leaders who wish to learn the broad philosophy and skills of community organising and who are in a position to put them into practice in their institutions and neighbourhoods. The Institute provides training and consultancy on a commercial basis to other agencies which wish to employ the skills and techniques of community organising in their institutions. The ICO has an Academic Advisory Board and an International Professional Advisory Body drawn from the global network of Community Organising Institutes in the UK (CITIZENS UK), USA (Industrial Areas Foundation) and Germany (DICO).

===Labour Party===
In 2018, the Labour Party set up a Community Organising Unit to focus on organising with communities and groups of employees, helping them to campaign on local and workplace issues.

==History in Australia==
Since 2000, active discussion about community organizing had begun in Sydney. A community organizing school was held in 2005 in Currawong, involving unions, community organizations and religious organizations. In 2007, Amanda Tattersall, a union and community organizer, approached Unions NSW to sponsor the initial stages of a new community organizing coalition called the Sydney Alliance. The coalition launched on 15 September 2011 with 43 organisations and is supporting the establishment of other community organizing coalitions across the country.

== Community organizing in Hong Kong ==

=== Emergence of community organizing in the 1970s ===
After the 1966 Star Ferry Riots and 1967 Riots, the British colonial government launched a series of policies to pacify the discontent and strengthen its rule. One of the measures was the subvention of &quot;Neighbourhood Level Community Development Project&quot; (NLCDP) in 1978, which is interpreted as an act to manage the pressure groups. Social workers were hired to provide activities and promote engagement in areas in shortage of welfare services. According to some scholars&#x27; view, in contrast with the government&#x27;s intention, NLCDP then became a site of &quot;radical community organizing movements&quot; that used protest actions.

The 1970s saw the rise of social and pressure group movements in Hong Kong. Many social organizations and pressure groups were formed without the government&#x27;s subsidy, in turn having more freedom to organize different activities. Some organizations were formed by progressive Christians. For instance, the Society for Society for Community Organization (SoCO) was formed in 1971. Pastors working in the district Tsuen Wan from six denominations formed a fellowship to discuss local issues, and decided to obtain funding from the World Council of Churches to form the Tsuen Wan Ecumenical Social Service Centre (TWESSC) to serve the low-income people in 1973.

Residents were organized in housing-related movements with demands ranging from improvement of facilities to housing policy. One of the examples is the protest of Yau Ma Tei boat people.

=== Influence of Saul Alinsky in Hong Kong in the 1970s ===
The Asia Committee for People&#x27;s Organisation (ACPO), influenced by Liberation Theology and Saul Alinsky&#x27;s concepts, provided both financial support and training to church groups in different parts of Asia such as Hong Kong, Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines. They invited Alinsky-trained consultants to organize training programmes and also Alinsky himself to Hong Kong in 1971. Alinsky&#x27;s two works, &quot;Reveille for Radicals&quot; and &quot;Rules for Radicals&quot; were widely read by university students and social workers. Due to Alinsky&#x27;s influence, the social workers adopted a more aggressive confrontational mode to force the government into actions.

=== Community organizing in the 1990s ===
A few social movements that adopted community organizing to demand housing rights in the 1990s caused much controversy especially in the social work sector, challenging the mode of &quot;community organizing&quot;. In 1993, the TWESSC organized some residents of public housing estates to protest, demanding the British colonial government to retract the &quot;Well-off Tenants Policies&quot; that increased the rent for higher-income residents in public housing estates. They planned to march towards the Governor&#x27;s House but were blocked in the way. They then sat in at the Upper Albert Road, blocking three lanes of the road, and demanded the Governor to take the petition letter. As a result, 23 people were arrested.

In 1994, the Buildings Department took a large-scale action to demolish rooftop houses, which were considered as unauthorized building works. On 17 October, the social workers of TWESSC organized the residents that lived in rooftop structures in Tak Yan House and Cheuk Ming House of Tsuen Wan to protest against the demolition and ask for resettlement and relocation. After camping overnight outside the Murray Building, which accommodated the Buildings, Lands and Planning departments. The protestors staged a sit-in at the lobby and kept all the lifts open, demanding to meet Director of Buildings, Helen Yu Lai Ching-ping. On 14 December, the social workers organized the residents to sit-in on the Garden Road outside the Murray Building. Residents brought their daily life instruments such as empty liquid petroleum gas pots and cooking utensils with the aim to stage a street theatre about losing their home. The liquid petroleum gas pots became the justification of police to clear the protest and caused much controversy. Twenty-two people, including social workers, were arrested under the charge of causing obstruction to traffic in Garden Road and attended court hearings.

In 1995, the rooftop dwellers in Kingland Apartments in Mong Kok protested against the Buildings Department&#x27; plan to demolish their rooftop homes. The NGO SoCO, a university students organization Social Movement Resource Centre and some other citizens joined to form the &quot;Kingland&#x27;s friends&quot; to support the residents. In March, around 20 residents and social workers demonstrated outside the government office. Three were alleged to have clashed with police and security guards and were arrested. In late April, the SoCo decided to withdraw from the &quot;Kingland&#x27;s friend&quot; and close the case, claiming that &quot;residents were swayed by students associations to plan illegal and violent ways for protest&quot;. In May, nearly 300 riot police cleared the Kingland Apartments.

The aftermath of the series of events had an impact on the mode of community organizing in the social work sector. SoCo complained to TWESSC that some of their social workers joined &quot;Kingland&#x27;s Friends&quot; and intervened in SoCo&#x27;s work. The executive member and staff of TWESS had disagreement about social workers&#x27; position in joining social movements, leading to the dismissal of six workers. The TWESSC was disbanded in January 1997. In 1995, the government announced a plan to eventually abolish NLCDPs. On 1 July 1997, the sovereignty of Hong Kong was handed over to mainland China. The SAR government changed the subvention model to giving a &quot;lump sum grant&quot;, which is seen as a measure to depoliticize social work by some scholars. As a result, &quot;radical community organizing&quot; by social workers became less common.

==For international development==
One of Alinsky&#x27;s associates, Presbyterian minister Herbert White, became a missionary in South Korea and the Philippines and brought Alinsky&#x27;s ideas, books and materials with him. He helped start a community organization in the Manila slum of Tondo in the 1970s. The concepts of community organizing spread through the many local NGO and activists groups in the Philippines.

Filipino community organizers melded Alinsky&#x27;s ideas with concepts from liberation theology, a pro-poor theological movement in the developing world, and the philosophy of Brazilian educationalist Paulo Freire. They found this community organizing a well-suited method to work among the poor during the martial law era of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Unlike the communist guerrillas, community organizers quietly worked to encourage critical thinking about the status quo, facilitate organization and support the solving of concrete collective problems. Community organizing was thus able to lay the groundwork for the People Power Revolution of 1986, which nonviolently pushed Marcos out of power.

The concepts of community organizing have now filtered into many international organizations as a way of promoting participation of communities in social, economic and political change in developing countries. This is often referred to as participatory development, participatory rural appraisal, participatory action research or local capacity building. Robert Chambers has been a particularly notable advocate of such techniques.

In 2004, members and staff of ACORN created ACORN International which has since developed organization and campaigns in Peru, India, Canada, Kenya, Argentina, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Honduras, the Czech Republic, Italy and elsewhere.

<text>The National University of San Cristóbal de Huamanga () is a public university located in the city of Ayacucho (formerly known as Huamanga) in southern Peru.

==History==
The university was established in 1677 by Cristóbal de Castilla y Zamora, the Catholic archbishop of La Plata o Charcas. Until it was closed in the mid-19th century, it operated mostly as a seminary for the training of Catholic priests. The government of Perú reopened it in 1959 as a national university.

In the 1960s, the university became a breeding ground for communist organizations, including the Shining Path. This group, led by philosophy professor Abimael Guzmán, started there before growing into a violent guerrilla movement that conducted a bloody campaign against the government of Perú and against rival leftists groups. (See also Efraín Morote Best.)

The rector of the university is Homero Ango Aguilar, a biologist.

<text>The Ash Wednesday bushfires, known in South Australia as Ash Wednesday II, were a series of bushfires that occurred in south-eastern Australia in 1983 on 16 February, the Christian holy day Ash Wednesday. Within twelve hours, more than 180 fires fanned by hot winds of up to caused widespread destruction across the states of Victoria and South Australia. Years of severe drought and extreme weather combined to create one of Australia&#x27;s worst fire days in a century. The fires were the deadliest in Australian history until the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009.

75 people died as a result of the fires; 47 in Victoria, and 28 in South Australia. This included 14 Country Fire Authority and three Country Fire Service personnel, all 17 were volunteer firefighters. Many fatalities were as a result of firestorm conditions caused by a sudden and violent wind change in the evening which rapidly changed the direction and size of the fire front. The speed and ferocity of the flames, aided by abundant fuels and a landscape immersed in smoke, made fire suppression and containment impossible. In many cases, residents fended for themselves as fires broke communications, cut off escape routes and severed electricity and water supplies. Up to 8,000 people were evacuated in Victoria at the height of the crisis and a state of disaster was declared for the first time in South Australia&#x27;s history. 

A 2001 report found Ash Wednesday to be one of Australia&#x27;s worst fires. More than 3,700 buildings were destroyed or damaged and 2,545 individuals and families lost their homes. Livestock losses were very high, with more than 340,000 sheep, 18,000 cattle and numerous native animals either dead or later destroyed. A total of 4,540 insurance claims were paid totalling A$176 million with a total estimated cost of well over A$400 million (1983 values) for both states, equivalent to A$1.3 billion in 2007.
The emergency saw the largest number of volunteers called to duty from across Australia at the same time—an estimated 130,000 firefighters, defence force personnel, relief workers and support crews.

==Backgrounds==

===1980 South Australian bushfires===
On Ash Wednesday in 1980 (20 February) during a virtually rainless summer after a very wet spring in 1979, bushfires swept through the Adelaide Hills in South Australia, destroying 51 houses. These fires were referred to as &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; until the 1983 fires, which became notorious nationwide.

===El Niño===
As 1982 came to a close, large areas of eastern Australia lay devastated by a prolonged drought thought to be caused by the El Niño climatic cycle. In many places, rainfall over winter and spring had been as little as half the previous record low in a record dating back to the 1870s and severe water restrictions were imposed in Melbourne in November. On 24 November, the earliest Total Fire Ban in forty years was proclaimed in Victoria. By February 1983, summer rainfall for Victoria was up to 75% less than in previous years. The first week of February was punctuated by intense heat, with record-high temperatures experienced on 1 and 8 February. This combination further destabilised an already volatile fire situation in the forested upland areas surrounding the Victorian and South Australian capitals of Melbourne and Adelaide.

===Early fire season===
Victorian Government firefighting agencies employed extra staff and organised for extra equipment and aircraft to be ready for firefighting over the summer. The first big bushfire occurred on 25 November 1982 and was followed by large fires on 3 and 13 December 1982. Even before 16 February, fires were already causing destruction in Victoria. An ongoing fire near Cann River in the state&#x27;s east had been burning uncontrolled for almost a month. Prior to that, a major bushfire on 8 January had taken hold north of Bacchus Marsh in the Wombat State Forest where two Forest Commission workers lost their lives defending Greendale. On 1 February 1983, a fire burnt the north face of Mount Macedon and areas of state forest. Fifty houses were destroyed. These fires were already creating a strain on firefighting resources. In the 1982/83 season, 3500 fires were reported to the Country Fire Authority in Victoria alone.

===Dust storm===

On 8 February, Melbourne was enveloped by a giant dust storm. The dust cloud was over high, long and was composed of an estimated of topsoil from the drought-ravaged Wimmera and Mallee areas of north-west Victoria. Leading a dry cool change and preceded by record temperatures, the dust storm cut visibility in Melbourne to 100 metres, creating near darkness for almost an hour.

There was also a dust storm in Adelaide on the day of the bushfires.

==Events of 16 February==
Wednesday 16 February dawned as another unrelentingly hot, dry day. The weather early on Ash Wednesday was complex and did not signify how the day would develop. A front separated hot, dry air coming in from the interior to the north, from cooler air moving eastwards from the Southern Ocean. Ahead of the front were hot, turbulent, gale-force northerly winds. Temperatures around Melbourne and Adelaide quickly rose above , with winds gusting up to and relative humidity plunging to as low as 6 per cent. From mid-morning, McArthur&#x27;s fire danger index was in excess of 100 in several places in Victoria and South Australia. It would be one of the worst fire weather days in south-east Australia since the disastrous Black Friday bushfires in 1939.

The first fire was reported at 11:30 am at McLaren Flat, south of Adelaide. Within hours, multiple reports of breaking fires quickly began to deluge Victoria&#x27;s and South Australia&#x27;s emergency services. In Victoria alone, 180 fires were reported, eight of which became major fires. At one stage, the entire Melbourne metropolitan area was encircled by an arc of fire. Property loss began early in the afternoon, particularly in the Adelaide Hills, east of Adelaide and the Dandenong Ranges, east of Melbourne.

Murray Nicoll, a journalist from radio station 5DN and resident of the Adelaide Hills, reported live from his local area where five people died:
Mount Lofty Summit Road is lined by a number of historic mansions, like Eurilla, Carminow and Mount Lofty House. The flames roared up the tower of Carminow like a chimney, destroying everything, including the gardens. Next door at Eurilla, Kym and Julie Bonython lost all of their worldly possessions, including antiques, paintings and Kym Bonython&#x27;s extensive jazz record collection. He saved only his favourite motorbike. At this time, this part of the Adelaide Hills was still not connected to the mains water supply, so all of the houses had only petrol-powered pumps and rainwater tanks. &quot;The petrol in the emergency pump just vaporised with the heat&quot; said Kym Bonython. &quot;We could do nothing except watch the place burn&quot;. Across the road at Pine Lodge (formerly the Mt Lofty Tea Rooms), the resident rolled out the property&#x27;s fire hose, connected it to the working diesel pump, only to find that embers were already burning numerous holes in the hose, rendering it useless. Down the road at Mount Lofty House, Mr and Mrs James Morgan lost $150,000 worth of furniture and artwork, which they had moved into the huge house only a fortnight before the fires, when they purchased the property.

At 3:15 pm on Wednesday, Mr and Mrs Morgan went to pick up their children from the local school and kindergarten. &quot;Three quarters of an hour later the roof was burning&quot;, said Mr Morgan. Flames across the road and road blocks prevented the family from returning to the house, until it was burnt to the ground. &quot;It&#x27;s worth nothing now&quot;, said Mr Morgan. All of these houses have since been restored and are privately owned. Mount Lofty House has since been turned into a boutique hotel. St Michael&#x27;s House, a mansion converted to an Anglican theological college and priory in the 1940s, was also burnt in the fires, but not restored and the whole site has since been cleared, leaving only the ruins of the gate house.

More than 60 per cent of the houses lost in South Australia were in the Mount Lofty Ranges. Of the 26 people who died in South Australia, 12 were in metropolitan areas, including four in the Adelaide suburb of Greenhill.

===Wind change===
The most disastrous factor in the Ash Wednesday fires occurred just before nightfall when a fierce and dry wind change swept across South Australia and Victoria. This abruptly changed the direction and dramatically increased the intensity of the fires. The long corridors of flame that had been driven all day by the strong northerly were suddenly hit by gale-force south-westerly winds and became enormous fire fronts, many kilometres wide, with wind reportedly moving faster than .

The near-cyclonic strength of the wind change created an unstoppable firestorm that produced tornado-like fire whirls and fireballs of eucalyptus gas measuring over three metres across. Survivors reported that the roar of the fire front was similar to that of a jet engine, though multiplied fifty, a hundred times. The change in temperature and air pressure was so savage that houses were seen exploding before fire could touch them. A resident of Aireys Inlet, on Victoria&#x27;s western coast, was quoted:

Unusual phenomena arising from the extreme conditions were reported. One survivor was startled to see a burning mattress hurtling through the air. Others noted road surfaces that bubbled and caught fire. experts later reported that, from evidence of melted metal, the heat of the fires after the change rose to , exceeding that recorded during the Allied bombing of Dresden in World War II. In fact, the Ash Wednesday fires were measured at around 60,000 kilowatts of heat energy per metre, leading to similarities with the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

Whole townships were obliterated in minutes. In the Dandenong Ranges, the villages of Cockatoo and Upper Beaconsfield were devastated, with twelve volunteer firefighters losing their lives after being trapped by a wall of flame when the wind change struck, while parts of Belgrave Heights (where this fire started) and Belgrave South suffered large areas of property loss.

Most of Macedon and much of historic Mount Macedon to the north-west of Melbourne was razed, including many heritage-listed 19th-century mansions and famed gardens. 

A fire that started in Deans Marsh raced into the Otway Forest. When the wind change happen the fire formed a huge front and headed for the coast.
Burning all night, the morning after Ash Wednesday, first light revealed the devastation of the popular coastal towns along the Great Ocean Road such as Aireys Inlet, Anglesea and Lorne resembled barren moonscapes. The fire on the coast had been so intense that firefighters were forced to abandon all control efforts and let it burn until it reached the ocean, destroying everything in its path. Residents were forced down to the water edge of beaches in the areas to escape the flames.

In Victoria, over 16,000 firefighters combatted the blaze, including staff and works crews from the Forests Commission Victoria, National Park Service, and volunteers from the Country Fire Authority and State Emergency Service. Also involved were over 1,000 Victoria Police, 500 Australian Defence Force personnel and hundreds of local residents. A variety of equipment was used, including 400 vehicles (fire-trucks, water tankers and dozers), 11 helicopters and 14 fixed wing aircraft.

The total land area burnt was approximately in Victoria and in South Australia. The summer bushfires of 1982/1983 razed approximately .

==Aftermath==
Many of the Victorian fires were thought to have been caused by sparks between short-circuiting power lines, and tree branches connecting with power lines. A systematic review of fire safety was undertaken; areas under high-tension pylons were cleared and local domestic lines considered to be at risk were replaced with insulated three-phase supply lines.

In South Australia, an inquest into the fires found that the communication systems used by the Country Fire Service were inadequate and, as a result, the government radio network was installed, although this did not happen until almost 20 years later. Improvements in weather forecasting, with particular reference to wind changes and fronts, was undertaken by the Bureau of Meteorology. An emergency disaster plan, known as Displan, was also legislated. Many of the lessons learned in building better homes for fire survival, bush management and emergency response efficiency in analysis of the fires conducted by the CSIRO were to prove vital in later crises, including the 1994 Eastern seaboard and 2003 Canberra fire outbreaks.

A study was conducted into the 32 fatalities (excluding firefighters) that occurred in Victoria. It revealed that 25 were outside their homes, several of whom died in vehicles while attempting to escape the conflagration. It was found that delaying evacuation until the last minute was a common failing.

==Legacy==
Until the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires, Ash Wednesday had the highest-recorded death toll for a bushfire disaster, with 75 deaths. For the next quarter century, Ash Wednesday was used as the measure for all bushfire emergencies in Australia; though since 2009, that has been supplemented by the lessons learned from Black Saturday. It remains well known as one of the worst natural disasters in Australia&#x27;s history.

Many psychological studies were undertaken in the months and years after the fire and found that the events left many in the affected communities with the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder, even 20 years after the disaster in 2003.

The lasting impact of Ash Wednesday was highlighted in 2008, when its 25th anniversary received much public and media attention. Commemoration sites have been set up in areas that were hit worst by the fires, with museums hosting exhibits inviting survivors to tell their stories.

<doc id="1051274" wikidata="Q1811455" url="?curid=1051274" title="United Nations Security Council Resolution 1566">
<text>United Nations Security Council resolution 1566, adopted unanimously on 8 October 2004, after reaffirming resolutions 1267 (1999), 1373 (2001) and 1540 (2004), the Council condemned terrorism as a serious threat to peace and strengthened anti-terrorism legislation.

==Resolution==
Condemning terrorism as one of the most serious threats to peace and security, the council called on countries to prosecute or extradite anyone supporting terrorist acts or participating in the planning of such schemes. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, it set up a working group to consider recommendations on measures to be imposed against &quot;individuals, groups or entities involved in or associated with terrorist activities&quot; not already identified by its Al-Qaeda and Taliban sanctions committee. There was concern at the increasing number of victims of terrorist attacks, including children.

Some approaches to be studied included &quot;more effective procedures considered to be appropriate for bringing them to justice through prosecution or extradition,&quot; freezing financial assets, travel restrictions and arms embargoes.

The text called on countries to prevent and punish &quot;criminal acts, including against civilians, committed with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or taking of hostages, with the purpose to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or particular persons, intimidate a population or compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.&quot; Such acts were &quot;under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other similar nature,&quot; according to the council.

The resolution also asked the working group to consider the possibility of establishing an international compensation fund for victims of terrorist acts and their families, which might be financed through voluntary contributions generated in part from assets seized from terrorist organizations, their members and sponsors. Furthermore, the Secretary-General Kofi Annan was requested to make the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate operation as soon as possible.

==Adoption==
Ambassador Andrey I. Denisov of Russia – which sponsored the resolution along with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, France, Germany, Romania, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States – stressed there was a need to improve the legal and other operational instruments to combat terrorism and terrorist organizations that are expert at changing their tactics depending on the situation. &quot;We are convinced that the resolution further strengthens the essential coordinating role of the United Nations in the international campaign against the terrorist threat,&quot; he said.

Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry of the United Kingdom, which held the council&#x27;s rotating presidency in October 2004, said that the 15-member body &quot;reaffirmed their view that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, whenever and by whomsoever committed.&quot; Ambassador Jones Parry also said that text reaffirmed the UN&#x27;s central role in the fight against terrorism as well as the council&#x27;s determination &quot;to stand together in confronting the scourge of terrorism.&quot;

U.S. Ambassador John Danforth said root causes in no way justified terrorism. &quot;The resolution which we have adopted states very simply that the deliberate massacre of innocents is never justifiable in any cause – never.&quot; He added that &quot;Some claim that exploding bombs in the midst of children is in the service of God,&quot; but that such an act &quot;is the ultimate blasphemy.&quot;

The resolution came days after terrorist attacks in Pakistan, Egypt, and the beheading of a British hostage Kenneth Bigley in Iraq, all of which were considered the work of Al-Qaeda. It was also the culmination of anti-terrorism diplomatic efforts by Russia following the Beslan school massacre.

<text>Fatimah Rifaat (June 5, 1930 – January 1996), better known by her pen name Alifa Rifaat (), was an Egyptian author whose controversial short stories are renowned for their depictions of the dynamics of female sexuality, relationships, and loss in rural Egyptian culture. While taking on such controversial subjects, Fatimah Rifaat&#x27;s protagonists remained religiously faithful with passive feelings towards their fate. Her stories did not attempt to undermine the patriarchal system; rather they were used to depict the problems inherent in a patriarchal society when men do not adhere to their religious teachings that advocate for the kind treatment of women. Fatimah Rifaat used the pseudonym Alifa to prevent embarrassment on the part of her family due to the themes of her stories and her writing career.

==Life==
Fatma Abdullah Rifaat was born on June 5, 1930, in Cairo, Egypt. Her father was an architect and her mother was a housewife. Her family boasted that their roots are said to extend back to Umar ibn al-Khattab, a companion and advisor to the prophet Muhammad. She was raised in provincial Egypt and spent most of her life there. Subsequently, rural Egypt became the setting for most of her stories. Her active interest in writing began at age nine when she wrote a poem expressing the despair in her village. For this she was met with punishment by her family due to the poem&#x27;s subject matter. Fatimah attended Misr al-Jadidah Primary school and The Cultural Center for Women for her intermediate education. She also attended the British Institute in Cairo from 1946 to 1949 where she studied English. When Alifa Rifaat expressed interest in continuing her education by enrolling in the College of Fine Arts in Egypt her father instead arranged for her to marry her cousin, a police officer.

For the first few years of their marriage, her husband allowed her to write and publish stories under her pseudonym despite the common idea of writing being a purely masculine field in Egyptian culture. She published her stories from 1955 until 1960 when she chose to stop after facing pressure from her husband to end her writing career. During this nearly 14-year period of literary silence Alifa Rifaat pursued the study of literature, astronomy, and history. Despite her attempts at preoccupation through these means Alifa Rifaat remained frustrated at her inability to express herself and the societal issues she faced as a woman through literary means.

In 1973, after facing a serious illness, Alifa&#x27;s husband allowed her once more to write and publish her work. She continued on to publish a collection of short stories and two novels beginning with the short story &quot;My World of the Unknown,&quot; for which she gained initial popularity.

Alifa Rifaat&#x27;s husband died in 1979. Although she travelled across provincial Egypt in accordance with her husband&#x27;s transfers for work she never left Egypt until after his death. She continued on to make the [hajj], the sacred pilgrimage to Mecca, in 1981 and travelled to multiple European and Arab states including England, Turkey, Germany, Morocco, and Austria.

Throughout her life Fatimah Rifaat became a member of the Federation of Egyptian Writers, the Short-Story Club, and the Dar al-Udaba (Egypt). She also attended the First International Women&#x27;s Book Fair (London, England) in 1984 where she spoke about the rights of women in Islam and the topic of polygamy.
In 1984 Fatimah Rifaat received the Excellency Award from the Modern Literature Assembly.

Fatimah Rifaat Died at the age of 65 in January 1996. She left behind three sons and a body of over 100 works that have been translated into multiple languages and have been produced for television. Some of her works have also been read on BBC.

==Literary themes and translations==
Alifa Rifaat wrote in Arabic throughout her literary career. Her style, though focusing more on romance in the beginning of her career, later shifted to social critique after she met translator Denys John-Davies. Denys also persuaded her to write in a more colloquial style of Arabic, which although being a more accessible form of writing to the Egyptian population, was also during this period a less desired form of writing than the formal style. Her novels and short stories have been translated into multiple languages including English, German, Dutch, and Swedish. The most popular English translation of her work is of her collection of short stories, Distant View of a Minaret and Other Short Stories, which is translated by Denys Johnson-Davies.

Fatimah Rifaat, unlike the prominent Egyptian Feminist Nawal El Saadawi, focused her writing on women in traditional Islamic roles. In her autobiography Fatimah describes her father&#x27;s lack of affection towards her as a possible root of her exploration of the needs and desires of men in terms of women. She continues on to relate that through her life she found that &quot;all men seek is pleasure. For that reason I cry out for complete and complementary love in all my writings.&quot; Fatimah also expresses in her autobiography the need for men and women to only participate in intercourse when they are in a serene state, so that orgasm can be achieved, which she believes acts to strengthen faith in God.

Fatimah Rifaat&#x27;s writing centers upon the silent plight of women in a patriarchal Muslim society. Her stories mainly take place in provincial Egypt. These stories handle themes such as sex, death, marriage, masturbation, clitoridectomy, love, teenage pregnancy, widowhood, and loss along with other controversial topics. During this time period a woman was considered a purely sexual being, and the allowance of freedom of her sexuality was feared to result in fitna, or societal chaos. Although Alifa Rifaat strove to express through writing the sexual repression of women, her stories and her life were conducted in an orthodox Muslim manner and she did not advocate the rise of women against patriarchy. Most of Rifaat&#x27;s female protagonists take a resigned or begrudgingly accepting stance towards the hardships they face in life. For Fatimah Rifaat, patriarchy is merely a fact of life and acceptable under Quranic terms, however it is the opposite and in some instances even the same gender&#x27;s lack of observance towards religious teachings that acts as the catalyst to many of the protagonists’ problems. In her stories many of the sexual encounters take place during the characters&#x27; marriage and there is no instance of extra-marital male-female relationships as this would be considered purely sinful under the practice of Islam.

Some of Fatimah Rifaat&#x27;s most popular stories include &quot;Distant View of a Minaret,&quot; &quot;Bahiyya’s Eyes,&quot; and &quot;My World of the Unknown.&quot;

== &quot;Distant View of a Minaret&quot; ==
&quot;Distant View of a Minaret&quot; opens with a husband and wife performing the act of intercourse. The story is told from the wife&#x27;s point of view and it is quickly revealed that during this interaction she is both uninterested and feels estranged from her husband. She recalls how in the past she attempted to express her desire for sexual satisfaction to her husband which was met in return with denial and anger. At some point during the act she becomes aware of the call to prayer. Afterwards she performs necessary ablutions and her prayers, a ritual with which she feels more in touch with than with her own relationship with her husband. She then peers out the window to look at a minaret in Cairo, recounting how there used to be a view of multiple minarets before new buildings blocked them out. The husband then suffers from a heart attack while still in bed and dies. In the end the protagonist is dully surprised at how calm she has remained during and after her husband&#x27;s death.
This story conveys the passive female sexual role as pushed by selfish male domination of the sexual relationship in marriage. The lone minaret likely represents the solitude that the female protagonist experiences having resigned to this role.

== &quot;Bahiyya’s Eyes&quot; ==
&quot;Bahiyya’s Eyes&quot; is told from the perspective of the aged Bahiyya speaking to her daughter after visiting a doctor about her loss of sight. She tells her daughter that although the doctor&#x27;s diagnosis attributes her loss of sight to natural causes and tells her she can be treated with medication she knows that it is instead due to all of the tears she has cried because of her life as a woman. Bahiyya then recounts her childhood, her clitoridectomy by the women of her village, her widowhood and the hardships of raising children as a single mother.
This story tackles the issue of suppression of female sexuality through recounting the events of Bahiyya&#x27;s childhood. She continues on to lament the position of women in society and the upholding of this low status by members of both genders. Bahiyya is also a name for Egypt.

== &quot;My World of the Unknown&quot; ==
&quot;My World of the Unknown&quot; centers on a woman who enters into a sexual awakening with the aid of a jinni in the form of a snake. When the woman and her husband move into a house the wife discovers a female jinni in the form of a snake who teaches her the height of sexual pleasure. The woman remains with the snake despite her confusion until her husband kills a snake in the yard, violating the code of the jinni, at which point the female jinni leaves.

This story deals with the issue of feminine pleasure. Although the wife does have an affair with the jinni, since the creature is female it is not considered adultery.

<doc id="1051279" wikidata="Q547674" url="?curid=1051279" title="George Zweig">
<text>George Zweig (; born May 30, 1937) is an American physicist of Russian-Jewish origin. He was trained as a particle physicist under Richard Feynman. He introduced, independently of Murray Gell-Mann, the quark model (although he named it &quot;aces&quot;). He later turned his attention to neurobiology. He has worked as a research scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and in the financial services industry.

==Early life and education==
Zweig was born on May 30, 1937 in Moscow, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union, into a Jewish family. His father was a structural engineer. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1959 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics, having taken numerous physics courses as electives. He earned a PhD degree in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology in 1964.

==Career==
Zweig proposed the existence of quarks at CERN, independently of Murray Gell-Mann, shortly after defending his PhD dissertation. Zweig dubbed them &quot;aces&quot;, after the four playing cards, because he speculated there were four of them (on the basis of the four extant leptons known at the time). The introduction of the concept of quarks provided a cornerstone for particle physics.

Like Gell-Mann, he realized that several important properties of particles such as baryons (e.g., protons and neutrons) could be explained by treating them as triplets of other constituent particles, with fractional baryon number and electric charge. Unlike Gell-Mann, Zweig was partly led to his picture of the quark model by the peculiarly attenuated decays of the meson to , a feature codified by what is now known as the OZI Rule, the &quot;Z&quot; in which stands for &quot;Zweig&quot;. In subsequent technical terminology, ultimately Gell-Mann&#x27;s quarks were closer to &quot;current quarks&quot;, while Zweig&#x27;s to &quot;constituent quarks&quot;.

Gell-Mann received the Nobel Prize for physics in 1969, for his overall contributions and discoveries concerning the classification of elementary particles and their interactions; at that time, quark theory had not become fully accepted, and was not specifically mentioned in the official citation of the prize. In 1977 Richard Feynman nominated both Zweig, and Gell-Mann again, for the Nobel prize, but the nomination failed.

Zweig later turned to research on hearing and neurobiology, and studied the transduction of sound into nerve impulses in the cochlea of the human ear, and how the brain maps sound onto the spatial dimensions of the cerebral cortex. In 1975, while studying the ear, he introduced a version of the continuous wavelet transform, the cochlear transform.

In 2003, Zweig joined the quantitative hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, founded by the former Cold War code breaker James Simons. He left the firm in 2010. Once his four-year confidentiality agreement with Renaissance Technologies expired, the 78-year-old Zweig returned to Wall Street and co-founded a quantitative hedge fund, called Signition, with two younger partners. They began trading in 2015.

<doc id="1051281" wikidata="Q1493735" url="?curid=1051281" title="Mount Stuart">
<text>Mount Stuart is a mountain in the Cascade Range, in the U.S. state of Washington. It is the second highest non-volcanic peak in the state, after Bonanza Peak and seventh-highest overall. Mount Stuart is the highest peak in the Stuart Range, and it is located in the central part of the Washington Cascades, south of Stevens Pass and east of Snoqualmie Pass in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.

==Name==
Mount Stuart was given its name by George B. McClellan in September 1853 in honor of his oldest and best friend, &quot;the late Capt. Jas. [Jimmie] Stuart of the Rifles—a gallant soldier &amp; accomplished gentleman.&quot; Stuart had died of an arrow wound on June 18, 1851, following a skirmish with Native Americans at the base of the Siskiyou Mountains in southwest Oregon.

==Topography==
Mount Stuart is more notable for its local relief than for its absolute elevation. For example, the south face rises in just . The northeast and northwest sides of the mountain exhibit similar steep relief. Due to its location away from higher peaks, Mount Stuart has a topographic prominence of , making it the sixth most prominent in the state. The rock of Mount Stuart is rugged due to the extensive jointing of the granite. The north slopes of the mountain shelter three glaciers - Stuart, Ice Cliff and Sherpa Glaciers from west to east.

==Climate==
==Climbing history==
It is not known for sure who made the first ascent of Mount Stuart. According to Fred Beckey: &quot;Claude Rusk... was told by Frank Bryant of Yakima about finding a stick at the summit bearing the name `Angus McPherson—1873.&#x27; A. H. Sylvester, who climbed to the summit in 1897 and 1899 for triangulation, believed the first ascent was made by Frank Tweedy and Richard Goode during the Northern Pacific land survey.&quot; Tweedy (after whom Tweedy&#x27;s pussypaws is named) climbed Mount Stuart on August 5, 1883, and two days later again with Goode (after whom Goode Mountain is named). They did not report finding evidence of an earlier ascent. Since the easiest route is not too technical, an earlier Native American ascent is also a possibility.

The standard route is the Cascadian Couloir up the southeast flank of the mountain, which ascends to a false summit just southeast of the main summit, and finishes along a short ridge. The route involves scrambling and often steep snow. Far more technical climbs are available on the complex north face and other aspects of the mountain.

<doc id="1051283" wikidata="Q5107761" url="?curid=1051283" title="Chris Pierce">
<text>Chris Pierce is an American singer, songwriter, producer, multi-instrumentalist, radio host, educator, public speaker, wine producer and officiant born and based in California.

==Early life==
Pierce is from Pasadena, California. He grew up singing in church and playing in bands from an early age and listened to classic soul, rhythm and blues, jazz, gospel and rock and roll recordings. When he was 15 he was diagnosed with otosclerosis which caused him to lose significant hearing. A surgery helped him regain 70% of his hearing in his right year. In his teenage years, he pursued acting and singing in local theater presentations and appeared on notable television shows such as &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot;, &quot;Big Break&quot; hosted by Natalie Cole, &quot;Star Search&quot; and &quot;Half and Half&quot;.

While still in high school, Pierce began playing gigs with Grammy-nominated rock musician Jon Butcher. After high school he received a scholarship to study jazz at USC. At 19 years old he performed on a US tour with Sonia Dada and later continued on to Moscow, Russia. After touring with Sonia Dada, Pierce came home to Southern California to work on his degree in jazz studies at USC. In 2005, Pierce met Seal at a house party and later joined him as his opening act on a world tour. Pierce says, &quot;I kinda got discovered by him... That opened up a bunch of different things.&quot;

==Career==
For over 3 decades Pierce has been recording and doing independent road tours. He has opened for Neil Young, B.B. King, Seal, Rodrigo y Gabriela, Jill Scott, Aaron Neville, Colbie Caillat, Al Green, Jamie Cullum, Toots &amp; The Maytals, and Robert Cray. In 2021, Chris Pierce&#x27;s cover of &quot;No One&quot; by Alicia Keys was featured on the ABC television series &quot;A Million Little Things&quot; and the single was released by Hollywood Records. Chris Pierce also co-wrote the hit song &quot;We Can Always Come Back To This&quot; which was featured 3 times on the NBC drama &quot;This Is Us&quot;. The song peaked at #1 on the Billboard Blues Chart and #12 on iTunes&#x27;s Top 100.

His songs have also been featured in film and television like &quot;Crash&quot;, &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot;, &quot;In Plain Sight&quot;, &quot;True Blood&quot;, &quot;Eli Stone&quot;, &quot;What About Brian&quot;, &quot;Lincoln Heights&quot;, &quot;Army Wives&quot;, &quot;North Shore&quot;, &quot;Half and Half&quot;, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Sister Act&quot;, &quot;Great Plains&quot; and &quot;The Long Shots&quot; starring Ice Cube. His single &quot;Are You Beautiful&quot; has been used in a national Banana Republic ad campaign.

==Reception==
Critic Paul Saitowitz of &quot;The Press-Enterprise&quot; has compared Pierce&#x27;s voice to Ray Charles, writing that it &quot;fluctuates from delicate falsettos to shrieks reminiscent of Ray Charles&quot;. In a concert review, the &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot; wrote that he has &quot;one of the most powerful voices going.&quot;

Chris Pierce&#x27;s 2021 album, &quot;American Silence,&quot; garnered critical acclaim from &quot;NPR&quot;, &quot;SiriusXM&quot;, &quot;The Bluegrass Situation&quot;, &quot;Acoustic Guitar&quot;, &quot;No Depression&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Americana UK&quot; and more for its strong racial justice themes. &quot;NPR&quot;&#x27;s Robin Hilton said, &quot;I haven&#x27;t been so deeply, deeply moved by just a person and their guitar like this in a long time.” &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;American Silence&quot; is the sound of everyone who&#x27;s hungry for change, steadying themselves and marching toward a common goal.&quot; &quot;No Depression&quot; noted the timelines of the album&#x27;s release around the worldwide racial justice uprisings: &quot;Chris Pierce&#x27;s &quot;American Silence&quot; is one of those albums that truly feels like a lifetime in the making.&quot;

Additionally, his song &quot;Keep On Keeping On&quot; was chosen as KCRW&#x27;s &quot;Today&#x27;s Top Tune&quot; and he appeared on KCRW&#x27;s &quot;Morning Becomes Eclectic&quot; with Nic Harcourt, who selected Pierce&#x27;s album, &quot;Walking on The Earth&quot;, as &quot;Best Album of July 2008.&quot;

<doc id="1051290" wikidata="Q2546138" url="?curid=1051290" title="Karen Walker (Will &amp; Grace)">
<text>Karen Walker (&quot;née&quot; Delaney; previously St. Croix, Popeil, and Finster) is a fictional character on the American television sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, portrayed by Megan Mullally. Although Karen was originally conceived as a supporting character role for &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, her escapades became a more prominent part of the show due to the popularity of the character with the audience. She was a multi-millionaire thanks to her marriage to Stanley Walker (an unseen character), until it was discovered that all of his money was loaned after their divorce in the series finale. However, at the end of the series, she regains this status.

The 2017 revival of the series retconned that revelation as one of Karen&#x27;s daydreams; she is still rich and still married to Stan. However, in the tenth season, Karen and Stan go through another divorce after she is caught cheating on him with his friend, a government agent by the name of Malcolm Widmark (Alec Baldwin), and she struggles with her loneliness and erratic emotions.

Karen has been described by Grace Adler (Debra Messing) as &quot;a spoiled, shrill, gold-digging socialite who would sooner chew off her own foot than do an honest day&#x27;s work.&quot; She is also a promiscuous alcoholic/drug addict with an often tenuous grip on reality and very few morals. She’s best friends with Will Truman’s (Eric McCormack) equally narcissistic friend Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes). After Mullally spoke her lines in her normal speaking voice in the pilot, she increased her delivery in pitch in subsequent episodes until her distinct nasal voice became one of the character&#x27;s trademarks. In 2010, Karen Walker was ranked No. 23 on the TV Guide Network special &quot;25 Greatest TV Characters of All Time&quot;.

==Fictional character history==

===Early years===
Karen Delaney was born on January 12, 1959 (which is revealed in the show&#x27;s season 8). Karen had a difficult childhood, thanks in part to her unstable relationship with her mother, Lois Whitley (Suzanne Pleshette), a con artist who incorporated her young daughter into her schemes. Karen has made many references in the show to her education and her maiden name, Delaney, which suggest she is of Irish-American background.

Although she tries to keep her age a secret, Jack revealed that she was 42 in 2001, meaning she was born in January 1959. She has been married four times – her first husband&#x27;s surname was St. Croix, her second husband was named Popeil (a reference to the American culinary businessman/entrepreneur Ron Popeil), her third was Stan Walker (married since 1995), and she was married for less than a day to Lyle Finster (John Cleese) in May 2004. As of the end of the series, she is still married to Stanley (see below), who has two children of his own, Olivia and Mason. She has intimated an illicit relationship with Ronald Reagan. Karen also goes under the alias &quot;Anastasia Beaverhausen&quot; (&quot;Anastasia as in Russian royalty, Beaverhausen as in ... where the beaver live&quot;) and also once used the alias Pilar Palabundar to &quot;beat up businessmen for cash in Chinatown.&quot; Fans of the Beaverhausen have created several interesting social media profiles, further fictionalizing both the alias character Anastasia and creating relatives. One of the more prominent iterations is Alexander Beaverhausen, who is a photographer in Dallas. Living a luxury life in Dallas but has strayed away from Anastasia.

Another alias was Lupita, used when she had an affair with a hotel janitor while trying to pass as a maid using Rosario&#x27;s uniform. Her real name may not, in fact, be Karen, as she changes her name from time to time to &quot;throw off the Feds.&quot; Her mother refers to her as &quot;Kiki&quot;, which was her childhood nickname. She has made more than one reference to attending Sarah Lawrence College. She is noted also for her shrill, squeaky voice; in one episode in the third season, Karen inhales helium from a balloon, only for the gas to have absolutely no effect on her voice. She is also noted for her addiction to alcohol and prescription drugs.

Karen seems to have had a background in acting (including a performance in a soft-core adult film as a naughty maid); however, she vowed never to act again after her part as a bank teller in the TV show &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; was cut. (Her one line was: &quot;Would you like that in fives, tens, or fifteens?&quot; delivered in a Southern accent). She has also spoken of a two-episode character arc in &quot;Dynasty&quot;.

Karen tends to have trouble separating stories she has read, seen, or heard about with her actual life. On one occasion she explains that she loves her family and then recites the story of Heidi, claiming it as her own. Another situation involves Karen&#x27;s fear of elevators: she and Jack are walking up the stairs of a skyscraper because she refuses to use the elevator. Jack asks her why she&#x27;s afraid of elevators, and she recounts the opening scene of the movie &quot;Speed&quot; (1994). She has also described the events of &quot;Norma Rae&quot; (1979) and &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot; (1967) as her own life experiences.

== Overview ==

=== Connection to other characters ===
To entertain herself, Karen takes a job as personal assistant to interior designer Grace Adler. Though she rarely accomplishes any work, she keeps the job because it keeps her &quot;away from Stan and the kids&quot;, as she once told an intern. Karen actually quits Grace Adler Designs twice. First, when Grace found Karen in a dominatrix film and Karen was horribly embarrassed, and second, when Karen does a design job all on her own and Grace takes credit for it. In the first instance, Karen returned to the company at the end of the episode because Grace gave her 49 copies of the film (Grace keeps one—totaling 50) so &quot;no one would have to see the tape again.&quot; The second time, Karen returned in the next episode. She becomes Jack&#x27;s assistant at &quot;Out TV&quot;, but she gets fired because she and Jack couldn&#x27;t keep a professional relationship, and she then returned to Grace like &quot;nothing ever happened&quot;, even though she remarks, &quot;I missed you&quot;.

Despite her incompetence, Grace never fires her because of the business benefits from Karen&#x27;s social contacts; Karen also pays for Grace&#x27;s health insurance and Christmas bonus. For a long time, Karen never cashed any of the paychecks she was given because, being rich, she didn&#x27;t need to; also, Karen and Grace had made a deal that, in exchange for not cashing the checks, Karen was not required to actually do any work. Instead, she kept them in a shoe box on her desk because she thought they were &quot;pretty little blue pieces of paper.&quot; In one episode, when Stan cuts down on her extravagant spending habits, she cashes all her paychecks at once, nearly bankrupting Grace. Karen gives the money back to Grace in the end.

Karen and Grace are very close friends, despite Karen&#x27;s constant criticisms and insults regarding Grace&#x27;s clothing choices and personal life (often dismissing Grace&#x27;s wardrobe with the comment &quot;Honey, what is this? What&#x27;s going on here?&quot; What are we trying to say?&quot;). Karen and Grace&#x27;s best friend Will Truman initially dislike each other, but they gradually become friends as well. Through Grace, she also meets Jack McFarland, and they become inseparable best friends.

=== Karen&#x27;s home life ===
For the first few seasons of the show, Karen lives with husband Stan Walker. Karen met Stan Walker in 1985, brushing off three simultaneous relationships (with Martina Navratilova, Sultan Habibi Shoshani Padush Al-Kabir, and a man named Clayton) to be with him, only to learn that Stan was married. After going through two other marriages, she finally got together with Stan 10 years later. At some point before this, she also agreed to appear in the fetishistic simply film &quot;Next to Godliness&quot;, a dominatrix flick. Stan is an obese man who was credited with keeping Taco Bell and Pizza Hut in business, and who has worn a toupee since his teens.

Stan was a mostly unseen character during the show&#x27;s run, despite being mentioned in many episodes. His hands and legs were shown in the episode &quot;New Will City&quot; but his face never was shown. His two children by his first wife, Mason (whom Karen calls &quot;the fat one&quot;) and Olivia (&quot;the girl&quot;), were often left in Karen&#x27;s incompetent care.

In the fourth season, Stan is jailed for tax evasion and tells Karen to date other men. She cannot bring herself to do so until she meets rich bachelor Lionel Banks (Rip Torn), but just as their affair begins, Stan is released from jail. However, after Karen catches Stan with his mistress, Lorraine Finster (Minnie Driver), a cafeteria worker at the prison, the couple separate and Karen moves into the Palace hotel. After beginning divorce proceedings at the end of the fifth season, Stan dies suddenly. Despite cruelly mocking him for years, Karen is genuinely saddened by his death.

During season six, Karen pursues romantic liaisons and eventually marries Lyle Finster (John Cleese), Lorraine&#x27;s father. However, after 20 minutes of marriage, she asks for a divorce upon realizing that Lyle puts his own needs ahead of hers.

Karen becomes the head of Walker, Inc. upon Stan&#x27;s death. However, at the end of season seven, it is revealed that Stan faked his death and had actually been in hiding. Karen begins dating Malcolm (Alec Baldwin), a government agent who had helped Stan go underground. However, she ultimately reconciles with Stan, and Malcolm leaves on a government mission to Sri Lanka. But later in the eighth season, Karen and Stan experience significant marital difficulties. They finally choose to divorce, only for Karen to learn in season eight&#x27;s finale that his money is borrowed, so she is now broke.

Karen then pressures Jack into a relationship with Beverley Leslie (played by Leslie Jordan), who is wealthy enough to support Jack—and in turn keep Karen in the extravagant lifestyle to which she is accustomed. Though he is not attracted to Beverley, Jack goes ahead with the scheme because Karen had financially supported him for the whole of their relationship. Karen realizes that she is doing to Jack what her mother did to her, and tells him that she cares more about his happiness than the money. Beverley, who had been in the bathroom, then comes out to an empty bedroom, looks for Jack on the outside balcony and, being 4&#x27;11 and 100 lbs., is swept to his death by a gust of wind. Beverley had left his $100 million estate to Jack. He happily becomes the provider in his relationship with Karen, which has otherwise not changed. The series finale shows that—until at least 2028—Karen, Jack, and Rosario share an extravagant penthouse apartment together, and, thanks to plastic surgery, Karen appears to have not aged a day.

When the series was revived in 2017, however, the events of the finale were written off as one of Karen&#x27;s drug-induced hallucinations. In this continuity, Karen is still married to Stan and still independently wealthy, and has become a member of First Lady Melania Trump&#x27;s inner circle.

However, in the final two episodes of season 9, it is revealed that Karen and Malcolm go on a rendezvous trip every year. By this point, Malcolm is very tired of having to hide from Stan and pressures Karen into deciding between him and Stan. Though she is reluctant to change their situation and despite both of them being tempted to give in to each other, Karen decides to stay with Stan and she and Malcolm share an awkward goodbye. In the beginning of season 10, Malcolm confesses the affair to Stan in hopes of starting a relationship with Karen again, but when Karen finds out about this, she slaps Malcolm and tells him to leave her alone for good. Karen is then served divorce papers from Stan, and in the next few episodes is seen struggling with her emotions and loneliness. Later in the season, Malcolm reappears at Karen&#x27;s and Grace&#x27;s office, hoping to win Karen back, but she is still angry at him and Grace is forced to be a mediator between them. Grace manages to convince Karen to forgive Malcolm and they decide to take things slow. However, when she feels that Malcolm is not putting as much effort into their relationship as she is, she confides her troubles to a lesbian named Nikki (Samira Wiley) who tells her she needs someone to take care of her. They then become lovers and Karen begins to question changing her sexuality. Ultimately in the season 10 finale, she announces herself as straight and breaks things off with Nikki, after realizing how lost she has become since her divorce from Stan.

In the series finale, Stan asks her to take him back, and she realizes that she still loves him. At his direction, she goes to the observation deck of the Statue of Liberty, where they had their first date, but he does not show up. Just as she is about to leave, however, Stan arrives on a helicopter and sends down a note asking her to marry him again. She says yes, and boards the helicopter. That night, she is with Will, Grace, and Jack as Grace goes into labor, and accompanies them to the hospital.

== Other relationships ==

=== Rosario ===
Karen is very close to her maid Rosario Salazar (Shelley Morrison), whom she met and hired in 1985. Although the duo often bicker and fight, it is only part of the bond they share. In the beginning of the series, it seems that Rosario didn&#x27;t speak much English, and Karen has a hard time communicating with her. Karen&#x27;s way of giving Rosario orders is to add the letter &quot;o&quot; to the end of every word she says (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;Enougho with the April Fresho. *hangs up the phone* Right now she&#x27;s calling me a bitcho&quot;). In another example of miscommunication, Karen ends phone calls with Rosario by saying &quot;hola&quot;, which means &quot;hello&quot; in Spanish and not &quot;goodbye&quot;. When Rosario is first seen on-camera at the end of the first season, it is revealed that she speaks English fluently and that Karen is merely being patronizing. In a later season, we see Karen forced to live in an apartment block she owns in Spanish Harlem as punishment for failing to bring the building to code. She is seen in this episode screeching at a child in the street in fluent Spanish. In the final episode of the first season, Karen arranges for Rosario to marry Jack so she can get a Green Card.

Karen and Rosario have a love-hate relationship: They have frequent, volatile arguments that end with them embracing each other and emotionally declaring their affection for each other. Rosario affectionately calls Karen &quot;mami&quot; from time to time, when they&#x27;re not trading insults. The only low points occur when Karen loses Rosario in a bet to her nemesis Beverley Leslie and when Karen fires Rosario after discovering she had hidden the truth about Stan being alive. In &quot;Saving Grace, Again (2)&quot; it is suggested that Karen uses Rosario as a horse or at least treats her like one because she asks Jack if &quot;winter white is a good color for Rosario&#x27;s saddlebag&quot; and in &quot;Cheatin&#x27; Trouble Blues&quot;, after climbing up numerous flights of stairs, said, &quot;Well, if I&#x27;d known we were gonna do all this walking, I would&#x27;ve saddled up Rosario, like when we go to Greece!&quot;

In the 2017 revived series, Rosario dies of a heart attack. Karen keeps up an uncaring façade for days afterward, even as she arranges a funeral for her, as well as the quinceañera she never had. She loses her nerve and flees the funeral before it starts, drowning her sorrows at a nearby bar. However, she does bid Rosario a quietly emotional goodbye when she is alone with the casket, and tells her she was her best friend, and that she loves her, tearfully declaring &quot;te amo mami&quot;.

=== Gin ===
Karen has a sister named Gin, played by Bernadette Peters. According to Gin, Karen rigged a floorboard during a game of Twister so she would fall through, hurt herself, and end her career in dance. Gin always mentions how one of her legs is now shorter than the other due to the incident. Later, Gin admits she rigged the floorboard as a cry for attention.

=== Lois Whitley ===
Lois, played by Suzanne Pleshette, is Karen&#x27;s mother who appears in the episode &quot;Someone Old, Someplace New&quot;. Jack is making a movie called &quot;The Mystery of Karen Walker&quot; and while making the movie he meets Lois. At the end of the episode Karen and Lois see each other for the first time in many years. Karen says &quot;I told you I never wanted to see you again.&quot; It is later revealed that Lois made a living as a con artist during Karen&#x27;s childhood and adolescence, implicating Karen in many of her schemes. As a result of this unconventional upbringing, Karen decided to distance herself from her mother, presumably in an attempt to lead a more stable life. However, the fruit does not fall far from the tree, as Karen&#x27;s long, colorful history of multiple marriages and desire to &quot;throw the feds off&quot; proves. They forgive each other in the next episode, &quot;Something Borrowed, Someone&#x27;s Due&quot;, but Lois wants to do one last job: conning an elderly shut-in out of his fortune. Karen would appear to be a down-on-her-luck daughter who is so &quot;slow&quot; that she was a cheerleader who never stopped clapping. While doing this Karen makes Lois sign a paper saying she will never pull another con with Karen again, and Karen notarizes it; she reveals that she is a legal notary from a Chicago job they once pulled. The job fails when the old man&#x27;s daughter gets a restraining order against Lois; then Lois and Karen make amends.

=== Other rivals ===
Karen&#x27;s arch rivals include, but are not limited to, Beverley Leslie (Leslie Jordan), Lorraine Finster (Minnie Driver), Anita Bryant, Candice Bergen (who is also Karen&#x27;s best friend, referring to running into her at a restaurant as &quot;a nightmare-slash-delightful&quot;), and Marlo Thomas (Karen hates her, but likes her husband, Phil Donahue). Further enemies include Scott Woolley (Jeff Goldblum), whom she jilted in high school; Candace &quot;Candy&quot; Pruitt (Christine Ebersole), who once said that Karen&#x27;s voice sounded &quot;like someone strangling an old macaw&quot;; and Helena Barnes (Joan Collins), a famous interior designer. Karen often openly insults or ridicules her enemies, while simultaneously thinking of them as her friends. Karen has a tendency to stumble upon becoming aware of her physical proximity to certain rivals. The most notable occurrence of this physical reaction occurs during her encounters with Beverley Leslie.

== Personality ==
With other staff and help, Karen is deliberately patronizing, referring to them solely by their title both in conversation and to their faces: &quot;Driver&quot;, &quot;Butler&quot;, &quot;Private Detective&quot;, &quot;Pharmacist&quot;, &quot;Back-Up Pharmacist&quot;, et cetera, and even refers to Will as &quot;Lawyer&quot; on occasion. She does this even when they are doing other jobs (&quot;Cook sometimes cleans, Cleaner sometimes cooks, Driver sometimes provides an alibi ...&quot;). This rude tone is not just limited to her employees, as she looks down on or openly mocks most people she meets, even her friends. Karen is often cruel to her staff at home, training them to run when she enters a room. Other times, she berates them, but somehow this comes across as an act of affection.

While being patronizing and condescending most of the time, Karen also seems to respect those that won&#x27;t back down from her. When she first meets Rosario, she bickers with her after Rosario told her that no one wants to hear her whining, only to say she likes Rosario and tells her she wants her to work for her. On another occasion, she asks Ben Ducette&#x27;s assistant Mrs. Freeman to pop a stamp on a letter and put it into the mail for her, only to receive a very icy look in return without touching the envelope or replying to her. After an uncomfortable pause for Will and Ben, Karen takes back the envelope and genuinely tells her she likes her.

Sometimes Karen unintentionally reveals to her friends a softer side. In one such incident, Karen&#x27;s husband has an apparent heart attack. Karen discovers that her friends have placed a bet to see who can get her to cry first, so she punishes each of them by leading them on to think she might break down in their presence. In the end, it is revealed that it was not a heart attack but rather acute angina. She then has an emotional breakdown over the incident, during which Grace stumbles in and consoles her. Another episode sees Karen and Jack in her mansion with her refusing to let him enter &#x27;the forbidden room&#x27;. When Jack finally gains access he discovers it is a nursery which Karen had prepared during a pregnancy scare in an earlier season. Although she agrees to change the room into a liquor storage room, she quickly changes her mind and the audience sees her stony façade crumble.

In one episode, Jack accidentally gives away her favorite shoes to charity, and she rushes to buy them back, only to find that a poor woman is about to buy them. Karen gives the woman $500 for the shoes and admonishes Jack not to tell anyone.

== Sexuality and gender ==
Karen frequently implies that she&#x27;s attracted to other women, and has hinted that she has slept with members of the same sex. She makes frequent references to Grace being secretly attracted to her, and once considered marrying Martina Navratilova during the 1980s. During the original series, she has made advances towards multiple women, including one woman named Diane who seemed open to the idea. In the 10th season, she enters a lesbian relationship with a woman named Nikki (Samira Wiley), but ends it upon realizing that she is not really a lesbian, but is simply feeling lost. In the first episode of season 11, Karen mentions to Will that she considers herself pansexual, despite deciding that she was straight in the season 10 finale.

== After &quot;Will and Grace&quot; ==
Walker&#x27;s persona has appeared in advertisements for &quot;The Megan Mullally Show&quot;, which debuted in September 2006 and canceled in January 2007. In one of the advertisements, &quot;Karen&quot; asks Mullally to take her along, and in another, Karen tries to pass for Mullally at a meeting with studio executives until she is caught by Mullally and they begin to physically struggle with each other. Mullally once again donned a Walker persona in an episode of &quot;The Megan Mullally Show&quot; which featured Andy Dick. In September 2016, just over a decade after the &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; series finale had first aired, Mullally appeared in a 10-minute &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; webisode as Karen, alongside Eric McCormack (Will), Debra Messing (Grace), Sean Hayes (Jack), and Shelley Morrison (Rosario). In the webisode, Karen announces that she is going to vote for Donald Trump in the presidential election, much to the chagrin of the other characters.

=== &quot;Karen: The Musical&quot; ===
In 2009, Mullally announced that she was developing a Broadway musical entitled &quot;Karen: The Musical&quot;, which was to be the &quot;return of Karen Walker&quot;. However, when the project was brought up during a 2013 interview, Mullally revealed that it had been abandoned after she lost the rights to the Karen Walker character.

<doc id="1051292" wikidata="Q6589536" url="?curid=1051292" title="List of Mazda model codes">
<text>This list of Mazda model codes describes following model codes which have been used by Mazda since the 1980s.

==Naming scheme==
The company&#x27;s model codes form the fourth and fifth characters of the VIN on post-1981 vehicles. The first character is a letter representing the model family, while the second is a sequential letter for subsequent models. For example, the Mazda N family used by the Mazda Miata started at NA and was updated in 1998 to NB and in 2006 to NC. The 2016 and newer MX-5s are designated ND.

Mazda generally starts car model codes at the letter &quot;A&quot;, but van and truck variants often get different names, usually starting at &quot;V&quot;.

Note: The US-built Mazda6 and Tribute do not use the Mazda model code in the VIN; in its place is an AutoAlliance code. Instead of the model code letter, position four in the VIN specifies the vehicle&#x27;s safety systems, and position five specifies the marque, due to being built in a multi-brand facility.

===Old VINs===
Prior to 1981, Mazda used a different VIN format and model code naming scheme. The model families were given two characters, and the model a third, based on their names.

The following pre-1981 model groups are known:
* M1 - Familia
* S1 - Capella/Savanna
* SA2 - Savanna/RX-7
* LA - Luce
* CD - Cosmo
* PA1/PA2 - Proceed

The next digit of the VIN specified the engine:
* 0 - 10A/10B
* 2 - 12A/12B
* 3 - 13A/13B

<doc id="1051297" wikidata="Q1057101" url="?curid=1051297" title="Cessna 180 Skywagon">
<text>The Cessna 180 Skywagon is a four- or six-seat, fixed conventional gear general aviation airplane which was produced between 1953 and 1981. Though the design is no longer in production, many of these aircraft are still in use as personal aircraft and in utility roles such as bush flying.

==Development==
Cessna introduced the heavier and more powerful 180 as a complement to the Cessna 170. It eventually came to be known as the Skywagon, with the name appearing in promotional material by 1973.

The prototype Cessna 180, N41697, first flew on May 26, 1952. Cessna engineering test pilot William D. Thompson was at the controls.

In all its versions, 6,193 Cessna 180s were manufactured. In 1956, a tricycle gear version of this design was introduced as the Cessna 182, which came to bear the name Skylane. Additionally, in 1960, Cessna introduced a heavier, more powerful sibling to the 180, the conventional gear Cessna 185. For a time, all three versions of the design were in production.

==Design==

The airframe of the 180 is all-metal, constructed of aluminum alloy. The fuselage is a semi-monocoque structure, with exterior skin sheets riveted to formers and longerons. The strut-braced wings, likewise, are constructed of exterior skin sheets riveted to spars and ribs. The landing gear of the 180 is in a conventional arrangement, with main gear legs made of spring steel, and a steerable tailwheel mounted on a hollow tapered steel tube.

Cessna 180s produced between 1953 and 1963 have two side windows, while 1964 to 1981 models feature three side windows, as they use the same fuselage as the Cessna 185. 180s can be equipped with floats and skis.

==Operational history==

===Record flight===
The Cessna 180 gained recognition as the aircraft chosen by Geraldine Mock, the first woman pilot to successfully fly around the world. The flight was made in 1964 in her 1953 model, the &quot;Spirit of Columbus&quot; (N1538C), as chronicled in her 1970 book &quot;Three-Eight Charlie&quot;. The Cessna factory obtained the aircraft and kept it at the Pawnee (Wichita, Kansas) manufacturing plant after the epic flight, suspended from the ceiling over one of the manufacturing lines. It is currently on display at the National Air and Space Museum.

==Variants==
&quot;Cessna has historically used model years similar to U.S. auto manufacturers, with sales of new models typically starting a few months prior to the actual calendar year.&quot;

<text>România liberă (, ) is a Romanian daily newspaper founded in 1943 and currently based in Bucharest. A newspaper of the same name also existed between 1877 and 1889.

==History and profile==
The name &quot;România liberă&quot; was first used by a daily newspaper focusing on politics published between 15 May 1877, (one day after Romania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire) and 13 April 1888, and afterwards by daily with somewhat erratic publication between 1915 and 1920.

The current series of &quot;România liberă&quot; began on 28 January 1943, during World War II, as an illegal newspaper of the Union of Patriots, a front organisation of the Communist Party. During the war it opposed the Nazi-allied government of Ion Antonescu, issuing calls to sabotage of the war industry and open armed resistance. Although after 1947 all the newspapers were controlled by the Communist Party, it has been described as the least ideological daily during the era of Nicolae Ceaușescu. It was also the only Romanian newspaper allowed to publish full-page advertisement sections.

In 1988, four journalists from &quot;România liberă&quot;, Petre Mihai Băcanu, Anton Uncu, Mihai Creanga, and Alexandru Chivoiu, attempted to publish a clandestine newspaper called &quot;Romania&quot; in which they criticized the Romanian leader Nicolae Ceaușescu and the censorship of the press, demanding press freedom and democracy. The four journalists were arrested by the Securitate, the secret police of the Communist regime, and were thrown in prison. They were freed on December 22 by the revolutionaries who had overthrown Ceausescu. They returned to &quot;România liberă&quot; and transformed the newspaper into a voice of the opposition to communism.

Although Ceaușescu was killed in December 1989, the power in Romania was taken mostly by former members of the Communist Party, notably Ion Iliescu. &quot;România liberă&quot; newspaper became the most critical voice against Iliescu and his government. The newspaper promoted conservative values, democracy, and the argued that Romania should join NATO and the European Union. They also wrote extensively about the abuses of the Securitate during the Communist Party&#x27;s rule.

In 1990, &quot;România liberă&quot;″s circulation rose as high as 1.5 million. However, those numbers fell off ten years later, and in 2000 the paper was purchased by the German company WAZ. Echoing complaints of journalists at rival daily &quot;Evenimentul Zilei&quot;, which was owned by the Swiss press trust Ringier, &quot;România liberă&quot; journalists complained in September 2004 that foreign owners were telling them to lessen political coverage and tone down their negative reporting of the government. Their concern was echoed by a variety of organizations including the Open Society Foundations. Paper&#x27;s management denied the charges.

In the case of &quot;România liberă&quot;, this protest took the form of a statement in the edition of 13 September 2004, in which the newspaper&#x27;s editors protested interference by WAZ. They accused their German ownership of having no concern for the public interest, and accused Klaus Overbeck in particular of trying to dictate to them what they could print in the newspaper. At the time of purchase WAZ had promised to confine themselves to the business side of the newspaper and stay out of editorial matters.

The paper has published &quot;The New York Times International Weekly&quot; on Fridays for some time beginning with 2009. This eight-page supplement featured a selection of English-language articles from &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In 2010 WAZ left the Romanian market and its shares at &quot;România liberă&quot;, leaving businessman Dan Adamescu as single share holder of Medien Holding Group.

<text>Villa Badoer is a villa in Fratta Polesine, in the Veneto region of northern Italy. It was designed in 1556 by Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio for the Venetian noble Francesco Badoer, and built between 1557 and 1563 on the site of a medieval castle, which guarded a bridge across a navigable canal. This was the first time Palladio used his fully developed temple pediment in the façade of a villa.

Villa Badoer has been part since 1996 of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto&quot;.

The building is open to the public and one of the wings houses the Museo archeologico nazionale di Fratta Polesine, opened in 2009.

== History ==
In 1554, on the southern border of the Venetian Republic’s territories, in the flat and foggy country of Polesine, Palladio designed a villa for the Venetian noble Francesco Badoer, intended to become the epicentre of the vast agricultural estate of almost five hundred fields that he had inherited six years previously.

Constructed and inhabited in 1556, the villa therefore functioned for the management of the fields and was simultaneously a visible sign of the “feudal” presence, so to speak, of Badoer in the territory: it is not coincidental that the building rises on the site of an ancient medieval castle. Palladio succeeded in uniting within one effective synthesis these dual meanings, joining the majestic manor house to the two &quot;barchesse&quot; (farm wings) bent into semicircles, which screen the stables and other agricultural annexes.

== The project by Palladio ==

There are no surviving drawings by Palladio relating to Villa Badoer, nor any building accounts, except those published by the architect in his &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; (1570).

Probably as a result of exploiting the substructures of the medieval castle, the manor house of the villa rises on a high basement, and recalls precedents like the Villa Medici at Poggio a Caiano by Giuliano da Sangallo, and the not far distant Villa dei Vescovi at Luvigliano by Giovanni Maria Falconetto. Building on the old foundations saved money, and gave a slightly raised setting to the building. This manoeuvre rendered necessary a scenographic staircase of several flights leading to the front door of the villa, the main descending to the courtyard and the two lateral ones connecting with the gable-ends of the &quot;barchesse&quot;. Thus, the ensemble recalls the structures of an antique, terraced temple complex.
The elegant curvilinear &quot;barchesse&quot; are the only ones that were realised by Palladio from the many projected (for example, those for the Villa Mocenigo on the Brenta, the Villa Thiene at Cicogna or the Villa Trissino at Meledo) and their shape – as Palladio writes – recalls arms opening to receive the visitor; the relevant antique source was very probably the exedrae of the Temple of Augustus in Rome. These originally housed agricultural activities, for this was a working villa, like Villa Emo and most of the villas by Palladio. Unusual among Palladio&#x27;s completed works, the wings here do not touch the villa, and they are set slightly in front of it. Vasari thought that they were beautiful, and even fantastic.

On the &quot;barchesse&quot; Palladio used the Tuscan order, appropriate to their utilitarian function and for the opportunity they afforded of realising very broad intercolumniations, which would not impede carriage access. Instead, the villa&#x27;s loggia displays an elegant Ionic order, to emphasise its residential, manorial status. The visual focus of the entire complex was centred precisely on the dominant axis of the great triangular pediment supported by Ionic columns, which bears the family arms, such that the villa&#x27;s flanks and rear are unarticulated and present a simply utilitarian aspect. This was the first time Palladio used his fully developed temple pediment in the façade of a villa.

Moreover, the distributive structure of the manorial house reveals Palladio&#x27;s usual organisation into a vertical axis, with service rooms occupying the basement storey, the patron&#x27;s habitation on the piano nobile, and a granary in the attic.

The plan and elevation of Villa Badoer presented in Palladio&#x27;s woodcuts in the &quot;Quattro Libri&quot; of 1570 is somewhat different from what was built there. A rear elevation and portico shown in the book were never built, but whether interrupted and not resumed, or curtailed in the course of construction are not known. Puppi suggested &quot;that the omission of the ceremonial features from the back façade had been decided by the patron, who must have thought them unnecessary in confrontation with the empty expanse of open countryside, and with the short extent of his property... on that side.&quot;

== Interiors and decoration ==
The piano nobile retains its original fresco decoration. All the rooms are covered by flat ceilings and on the walls a certain &quot;Giallo Fiorentino&quot; designed complex combinations of allegorical figures, whose significance remains partially obscure. Palladio referred to these frescoes as being &quot;grottesche di bellissima inventione&quot; by a certain Giallo Fiorentino, whose real identity has remained uncertain. Milanesi&#x27;s identification as Jacopo Giallo, a Florentine illuminator to whom some manuscript work has been assigned, was eliminated by Lionello Puppi&#x27;s archival discovery that Jacopo Giallo was dead by 1545, thirteen years before the villa was built; Puppi offered instead a certain fresco painter &quot;Giallo Fiorentino&quot;, an assistant to Giuseppe Salviati for exterior frescoes at Palazzo Loredan at San Stefano. More recently, Pier Francesco di Jacopo Foschi has been suggested.

Architectural critics such as Witold Rybczynski think that the interior is relatively small and unimpressive, compared to the grandiose exterior.

== Conservation ==

The building passed to the public in the 1960s (initially to the Ville Venete Institute, then to the Province of Rovigo) and was completely restored.

In 1996, UNESCO designated Villa Badoer as part of the World Heritage Site &quot;City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto&quot;.

The building is open to the public. Since 21 February 2009 the northern barchesse of the Villa houses the Museo archeologico nazionale di Fratta Polesine (National archaeological museum of Fratta Polesine).

<text>Response bias is a general term for a wide range of tendencies for participants to respond inaccurately or falsely to questions. These biases are prevalent in research involving participant self-report, such as structured interviews or surveys. Response biases can have a large impact on the validity of questionnaires or surveys.

Response bias can be induced or caused by numerous factors, all relating to the idea that human subjects do not respond passively to stimuli, but rather actively integrate multiple sources of information to generate a response in a given situation. Because of this, almost any aspect of an experimental condition may potentially bias a respondent. Examples include the phrasing of questions in surveys, the demeanor of the researcher, the way the experiment is conducted, or the desires of the participant to be a good experimental subject and to provide socially desirable responses may affect the response in some way. All of these &quot;artifacts&quot; of survey and self-report research may have the potential to damage the validity of a measure or study. Compounding this issue is that surveys affected by response bias still often have high reliability, which can lure researchers into a false sense of security about the conclusions they draw.

Because of response bias, it is possible that some study results are due to a systematic response bias rather than the hypothesized effect, which can have a profound effect on psychological and other types of research using questionnaires or surveys. It is therefore important for researchers to be aware of response bias and the effect it can have on their research so that they can attempt to prevent it from impacting their findings in a negative manner.

==History of research==
Awareness of response bias has been present in psychology and sociology literature for some time because self-reporting features significantly in those fields of research. However, researchers were initially unwilling to admit the degree to which they impact, and potentially invalidate research utilizing these types of measures. Some researchers believed that the biases present in a group of subjects cancel out when the group is large enough. This would mean that the impact of response bias is random noise, which washes out if enough participants are included in the study. However, at the time this argument was proposed, effective methodological tools that could test it were not available. Once newer methodologies were developed, researchers began to investigate the impact of response bias. From this renewed research, two opposing sides arose.

The first group supports Hyman&#x27;s belief that although response bias exists, it often has minimal effect on participant response, and no large steps need to be taken to mitigate it. These researchers hold that although there is significant literature identifying response bias as influencing the responses of study participants, these studies do not in fact provide empirical evidence that this is the case. They subscribe to the idea that the effects of this bias wash out with large enough samples, and that it is not a systematic problem in mental health research. These studies also call into question earlier research that investigated response bias on the basis of their research methodologies. For example, they mention that many of the studies had very small sample sizes, or that in studies looking at social desirability, a subtype of response bias, the researchers had no way to quantify the desirability of the statements used in the study. Additionally, some have argued that what researchers may believe to be artifacts of response bias, such as differences in responding between men and women, may in fact be actual differences between the two groups. Several other studies also found evidence that response bias is not as big of a problem as it may seem. The first found that when comparing the responses of participants, with and without controls for response bias, their answers to the surveys were not different. Two other studies found that although the bias may be present, the effects are extremely small, having little to no impact towards dramatically changing or altering the responses of participants.

The second group argues against Hyman&#x27;s point, saying that response bias has a significant effect, and that researchers need to take steps to reduce response bias in order to conduct sound research. They argue that the impact of response bias is a systematic error inherent to this type of research and that it needs to be addressed in order for studies to be able to produce accurate results. In psychology, there are many studies exploring the impact of response bias in many different settings and with many different variables. For example, some studies have found effects of response bias in the reporting of depression in elderly patients. Other researchers have found that there are serious issues when responses to a given survey or questionnaire have responses that may seem desirable or undesirable to report, and that a person&#x27;s responses to certain questions can be biased by their culture. Additionally, there is support for the idea that simply being part of an experiment can have dramatic effects on how participants act, thus biasing anything that they may do in a research or experimental setting when it comes to self-reporting. One of the most influential studies was one which found that social desirability bias, a type of response bias, can account for as much as 10–70% of the variance in participant response. Essentially, because of several findings that illustrate the dramatic effects response bias has on the outcomes of self-report research, this side supports the idea that steps need to be taken to mitigate the effects of response bias to maintain the accuracy of research.

While both sides have support in the literature, there appears to be greater empirical support for the significance of response bias. To add strength to the claims of those who argue the importance of response bias, many of the studies that reject the significance of response bias report multiple methodological issues in their studies. For example, they have extremely small samples that are not representative of the population as a whole, they only considered a small subset of potential variables that could be affected by response bias, and their measurements were conducted over the phone with poorly worded statements.

==Types==

===Acquiescence bias===

Acquiescence bias, which is also referred to as &quot;yea-saying&quot;, is a category of response bias in which respondents to a survey have a tendency to agree with all the questions in a measure. This bias in responding may represent a form of dishonest reporting because the participant automatically endorses any statements, even if the result is contradictory responses. For example, a participant could be asked whether they endorse the following statement, &quot;I prefer to spend time with others&quot; but then later on in the survey also endorses &quot;I prefer to spend time alone,&quot; which are contradictory statements. This is a distinct problem for self-report research because it does not allow a researcher to understand or gather accurate data from any type of question that asks for a participant to endorse or reject statements. Researchers have approached this issue by thinking about the bias in two different ways. The first deals with the idea that participants are trying to be agreeable, in order to avoid the disapproval of the researcher. A second cause for this type of bias was proposed by Lee Cronbach, when he argued that it is likely due to a problem in the cognitive processes of the participant, instead of the motivation to please the researcher. He argues that it may be due to biases in memory where an individual recalls information that supports endorsement of the statement, and ignores contradicting information.

Researchers have several methods to try and reduce this form of bias. Primarily, they attempt to make balanced response sets in a given measure, meaning that there are a balanced number of positively and negatively worded questions. This means that if a researcher was hoping to examine a certain trait with a given questionnaire, half of the questions would have a &quot;yes&quot; response to identify the trait, and the other half would have a &quot;no&quot; response to identify the trait.

Nay-saying is the opposite form of this bias. It occurs when a participant always chooses to deny or not endorse any statements in a survey or measure. This has a similar effect of invalidating any kinds of endorsements that participants may make over the course of the experiment.

===Courtesy bias===
&quot;Courtesy bias&quot; is a type of response bias that occurs when some individuals tend to not fully state their unhappiness with a service or product as an attempt to be polite or courteous toward the questioner. It is a common bias in qualitative research methodology. 

In a study on disrespect and abuse during facility based childbirth, courtesy bias was found to be one of the causes of potential underreporting of those behaviors at hospitals and clinics. Evidence has been found that some cultures are especially prone to the courtesy bias, leading respondents to say what they believe the questioner wants to hear. This bias has been found in Asian and in Hispanic cultures. Courtesy bias has been found to be a similar term referring to people in East Asia, who frequently tend to exhibit acquiescence bias. As with most data collection, courtesy bias has been found to be a concern from the phone survey respondents.

Attempts were made to create a good interview environment in order to minimize courtesy bias. An emphasis is needed that both positive and negative experiences must be important to showcase to enhance learning and minimize the bias as much as possible.

===Demand characteristics===
Demand characteristics refer to a type of response bias where participants alter their response or behavior simply because they are part of an experiment. This arises because participants are actively engaged in the experiment, and may try to figure out the purpose, or adopt certain behaviors they believe belong in an experimental setting. Martin Orne was one of the first to identify this type of bias, and has developed several theories to address their cause. His research points to the idea that participants enter a certain type of social interaction when engaging in an experiment, and this special social interaction drives participants to consciously and unconsciously alter their behaviors There are several ways that this bias can influence participants and their responses in an experimental setting. One of the most common relates to the motivations of the participant. Many people choose to volunteer to be in studies because they believe that experiments are important. This drives participants to be &quot;good subjects&quot; and fulfill their role in the experiment properly, because they believe that their proper participation is vital to the success of the study. Thus, in an attempt to productively participate, the subject may try to gain knowledge of the hypothesis being tested in the experiment and alter their behavior in an attempt to support that hypothesis. Orne conceptualized this change by saying that the experiment may appear to a participant as a problem, and it is his or her job to find the solution to that problem, which would be behaving in a way that would lend support to the experimenter&#x27;s hypothesis. Alternatively, a participant may try to discover the hypothesis simply to provide faulty information and wreck the hypothesis. Both of these results are harmful because they prevent the experimenters from gathering accurate data and making sound conclusions.

Outside of participant motivation, there are other factors that influence the appearance of demand characteristics in a study. Many of these factors relate to the unique nature of the experimental setting itself. For example, participants in studies are more likely to put up with uncomfortable or tedious tasks simply because they are in an experiment. Additionally, the mannerisms of the experimenter, such as the way they greet the participant, or the way they interact with the participant during the course of the experiment may inadvertently bias how the participant responds during the course of the experiment. Also, prior experiences of being in an experiment, or rumors of the experiment that participants may hear can greatly bias the way they respond. Outside of an experiment, these types of past experiences and mannerisms may have significant effects on how patients rank the effectiveness of their therapist. Many of the ways therapists go about collecting client feedback involve self-reporting measures, which can be highly influenced by response bias. Participants may be biased if they fill out these measure in front of their therapist, or somehow feel compelled to answer in an affirmative matter because they believe their therapy should be working. In this case, the therapists would not be able to gain accurate feedback from their clients, and be unable to improve their therapy or accurately tailor further treatment to what the participants need. All of these different examples may have significant effects on the responses of participants, driving them to respond in ways that do not reflect their actual beliefs or actual mindset, which negatively impact conclusions drawn from those surveys.

While demand characteristics cannot be completely removed from an experiment, there are steps that researchers can take to minimize the impact they may have on the results. One way to mitigate response bias is to use deception to prevent the participant from discovering the true hypothesis of the experiment and then debrief the participants. For example, research has demonstrated that repeated deception and debriefing is useful in preventing participants from becoming familiar with the experiment, and that participants do not significantly alter their behaviors after being deceived and debriefed multiple times. Another way that researchers attempt to reduce demand characteristics is by being as neutral as possible, or training those conducting the experiment to be as neutral as possible. For example, studies show that extensive one-on-one contact between the experimenter and the participant makes it more difficult to be neutral, and go on to suggest that this type of interaction should be limited when designing an experiment. Another way to prevent demand characteristics is to use blinded experiments with placebos or control groups. This prevents the experimenter from biasing the participant, because the researcher does not know in which way the participant should respond. Although not perfect, these methods can significantly reduce the effect of demand characteristics on a study, thus making the conclusions drawn from the experiment more likely to accurately reflect what they were intended to measure.

===Extreme responding===

Extreme responding is a form of response bias that drives respondents to only select the most extreme options or answers available. For example, in a survey utilizing a Likert scale with potential responses ranging from one to five, the respondent may only give answers as ones or fives. Another example is if the participant only answered questionnaires with &quot;strongly agree&quot; or &quot;strongly disagree&quot; in a survey with that type of response style. There are several reasons for why this bias may take hold in a group of participants. One example ties the development of this type of bias in respondents to their cultural identity. This explanation states that people from certain cultures are more likely to respond in an extreme manner as compared to others. For example, research has found that those from the Middle East and Latin America are more prone to be affected by extremity response, whereas those from East Asia and Western Europe are less likely to be affected. A second explanation for this type of response bias relates to the education level of the participants. Research has indicated that those with lower intelligence, measured by an analysis of IQ and school achievement, are more likely to be affected by extremity response. Another way that this bias can be introduced is through the wording of questions in a survey or questionnaire. Certain topics or the wording of a question may drive participants to respond in an extreme manner, especially if it relates to the motivations or beliefs of the participant.

The opposite of this bias occurs when participants only select intermediate or mild responses as answers.

=== Question order bias ===
Question order bias, or &quot;order effects bias&quot;, is a type of response bias where a respondent may react differently to questions based on the order in which questions appear in a survey or interview. Question order bias is different from &quot;response order bias&quot; that addresses specifically the order of the set of responses within a survey question. There are many ways that questionnaire items that appear earlier in a survey can affect responses to later questions. One way is when a question creates a &quot;norm of reciprocity or fairness&quot; as identified in the 1950 work of Herbert Hyman and Paul Sheatsley. In their research they asked two questions. One was asked on whether the United States should allow reporters from communist countries to come to the U.S. and send back news as they saw it; and another question was asked on whether a communist country like Russia should let American newspaper reporters come in and send back news as they saw it to America. In the study, the percentage of “yes” responses to the question allowing communist reporters increased by 37 percentage points depending on the order. Similarly results for the American reporters item increased by 24 percentage points. When either of the items was asked second, the context for the item was changed as a result of the answer to the first, and the responses to the second were more in line with what would be considered fair, based on the previous response. Another way to alter the response towards questions based on order depends on the framing of the question. If a respondent is first asked about their general interest in a subject their response interest may be higher than if they are first posed technical or knowledge based questions about a subject. Part-whole contrast effect is yet another ordering effect. When general and specific questions are asked in different orders, results for the specific item are generally unaffected, whereas those for the general item can change significantly. Question order biases occur primarily in survey or questionnaire settings. Some strategies to limit the effects of question order bias include randomization, grouping questions by topic to unfold in a logical order.

===Social desirability bias===
Social desirability bias is a type of response bias that influences a participant to deny undesirable traits, and ascribe to themselves traits that are socially desirable. In essence, it is a bias that drives an individual to answer in a way that makes them look more favorable to the experimenter. This bias can take many forms. Some individuals may over-report good behavior, while others may under-report bad, or undesirable behavior. A critical aspect of how this bias can come to affect the responses of participants relates to the norms of the society in which the research is taking place. For example, social desirability bias could play a large role if conducting research about an individual&#x27;s tendency to use drugs. Those in a community where drug use is seen as acceptable or popular may exaggerate their own drug use, whereas those from a community where drug use is looked down upon may choose to under-report their own use. This type of bias is much more prevalent in questions that draw on a subject&#x27;s opinion, like when asking a participant to evaluate or rate something, because there generally is not one correct answer, and the respondent has multiple ways they could answer the question. Overall, this bias can be very problematic for self-report researchers, especially if the topic they are looking at is controversial. The distortions created by respondents answering in a socially desirable manner can have profound effects on the validity of self-report research. Without being able to control for or deal with this bias, researchers are unable to determine if the effects they are measuring are due to individual differences, or from a desire to conform to the societal norms present in the population they are studying. Therefore, researchers strive to employ strategies aimed at mitigating social desirability bias so that they can draw valid conclusions from their research.

Several strategies exist to limit the effect of social desirability bias. In 1985, Anton Nederhof compiled a list of techniques and methodological strategies for researchers to use to mitigate the effects of social desirability bias in their studies. Most of these strategies involve deceiving the subject, or are related to the way questions in surveys and questionnaires are presented to those in a study. A condensed list of seven of the strategies are listed below:
*Ballot-box method: This method allows a subject to anonymously self-complete a questionnaire and submit it to a locked &quot;ballot box&quot;, thereby concealing their responses from an interviewer and affording the participant an additional layer of assured concealment from perceived social repercussion.
*Forced-choice items: This technique hopes to generate questions that are equal in desirability to prevent a socially desirable response in one direction or another.
*Neutral questions: The goal of this strategy is to use questions that are rated as neutral by a wide range of participants so that socially desirable responding does not apply.
*Randomized response technique: This technique allows participants to answer a question that is randomly selected from a set of questions. The researcher in this technique does not know which question the subject responds to, so subjects are more likely to answer truthfully. Researchers can then use statistics to interpret the anonymous data.
*Self-administered questionnaires: This strategy involves isolating the participant before they begin answering the survey or questionnaire to hopefully remove any social cues the researcher may present to the participant.
*Bogus-pipeline: This technique involves a form of deception, where researchers convince a subject through a series of rigged demonstrations that a machine can accurately determine if a participant is being truthful when responding to certain questions. After the participant completes the survey or questionnaire, they are debriefed. This is a rare technique, and does not see much use because of the cost, time commitment and because it is a one-use only technique for each participant.
*Selection interviewers: This strategy allows participants to select the person or persons who will be conducting the interview or presiding over the experiment. This, in the hope that with a higher degree of rapport, subjects will be more likely to answer honestly.
*Proxy subjects: Instead of asking a person directly, this strategy questions someone who is close to or knows the target individual well. This technique is generally limited to questions about behavior, and is not adequate for asking about attitudes or beliefs.

The degree of effectiveness for each of these techniques or strategies differs depending on the situation and the question asked. In order to be the most successful in reducing social desirability bias in a wide range of situations, it has been suggested that researchers utilize a combination of these techniques to have the best chance at mitigating the effects of social desirability bias. Validations are not made on a &quot;more is better&quot; assumption (higher stated prevalence of the behavior of interest) when selecting the best method for reducing SDB as this is a &quot;weak validation&quot; that does not always guarantee the best results. Instead, ground &quot;truthed&quot; comparisons of observed data to stated data should reveal the most accurate method.

==Related terminology==

*Non-response bias is not the opposite of response bias and is not a type of cognitive bias: it occurs in a statistical survey if those who respond to the survey differ in the outcome variable.
*Response rate is not a cognitive bias, but rather refers to a ratio of those who complete the survey and those who do not.

==Highly vulnerable areas==

Some areas or topics that are highly vulnerable to the various types of response bias include:

<text>The Liberal–National Coalition, commonly known simply as the Coalition, is an alliance of centre-right to right-wing political parties that forms one of the two major groupings in Australian federal politics. The two partners in the Coalition are the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia (the latter previously known as the Country Party and the National Country Party). Its main opponent is the Australian Labor Party (ALP); the two forces are often regarded as operating in a two-party system. The Coalition was last in government from 2013 to 2022. The group is led by Peter Dutton, who succeeded Scott Morrison after the 2022 federal election.

The two parties in the Coalition have different geographical voter bases, with the Liberals – the larger party – drawing most of their vote from urban areas and the Nationals operating almost exclusively in rural and regional areas. They occupy a broadly similar place on the right of the political spectrum. The partnership between the two current parties dates back to 1946, shortly after the Liberal Party was formed, and has continued almost uninterrupted since then. The Country Party also maintained similar alliances with the Liberal Party&#x27;s predecessors, the United Australia Party and Nationalist Party, and similar parties at state level. The first such federal arrangement was formed in 1923, as a solution to the hung parliament that resulted from the 1922 federal election.

The Liberals and Nationals maintain separate organisational wings and separate parliamentary parties, but co-operate in various ways determined by a mixture of formal agreements and informal conventions. There is a single Coalition frontbench, both in government and in opposition, with each party receiving a proportionate number of positions. By convention, the leader of the Liberal Party serves as the overall leader, serving as prime minister when the Coalition is in government and leader of the opposition when the Coalition is in opposition. The leader of the National Party becomes the deputy prime minister during periods of Coalition government. The two parties co-operate on their federal election campaigns, run joint Senate tickets in most states, and generally avoid running candidates against each other in the House of Representatives.

A merger of the Liberals and Nationals has been suggested on a number of occasions, but has never become a serious proposition. The relationship between the two parties varies at state and territory level. The situation in New South Wales and Victoria broadly mirrors that at federal level, while in Western Australia the parties are much more independent of each other. In the Northern Territory the territorial parties merged in 1974 to form the Country Liberal Party (CLP), and in 2008 the Queensland state-level parties merged, forming the Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP). LNP and CLP members elected to federal parliament do not form separate parliamentary parties, joining either the Liberals or Nationals. In South Australia, Tasmania and the ACT, the Nationals have no sitting MPs and little or no organisational presence.

==History==

The origins of the Coalition date back to the 1922 federal election, when the Nationalist Party, the main middle-class non-Labor party of the time, lost the absolute majority it had held since its formation in 1917. The Nationalists could only stay in office with the support of the two-year-old Country Party. It soon became apparent that a confidence and supply agreement would not be enough to keep the Nationalists in office.

However, Country Party leader Earle Page had never trusted the Nationalist Prime Minister, Billy Hughes. Indeed, the Country Party had been formed in part due to discontent with Hughes&#x27; rural policy. Page not only let it be known that he would not serve under Hughes, but demanded Hughes&#x27; resignation before he would even consider coalition talks. Hughes resigned, and Page then entered negotiations with the new Nationalist leader, Stanley Bruce. The Country Party&#x27;s terms were unusually stiff for a prospective junior partner in a Westminster system (and especially so for a relatively new party) – five seats in an 11-member cabinet, as well as the Treasurer&#x27;s post and second rank in the ministry for Page. Nonetheless, Bruce agreed rather than force a new election. Since then, the leader of the Country Party, which evolved into the National Party, has ranked second in nearly all non-Labor governments, a status formalised in 1967 when the post of Deputy Prime Minister was formally created to denote Country leader John McEwen&#x27;s status as the number-two man in the government.

The Nationalist–Country Coalition was reelected twice, and continued in office until its defeat in 1929.

The Country Party and the Nationalists&#x27; successor party, the United Australia Party, fought the 1931 federal election with a joint Senate ticket, though they ran separate House tickets. The UAP came up only four seats short of a majority in its own right. The Emergency Committee of South Australia, which stood for the UAP and Country Party in South Australia, joined the UAP party room, giving the UAP enough support to rule alone. However, the parties once again joined in a full Coalition government following the 1934 federal election.

After the death of Prime Minister Joseph Lyons in April 1939, Page was appointed as his successor on an interim basis, pending the new election of a new UAP leader. Despite Page&#x27;s misgivings, the UAP elected Robert Menzies – who was known to dislike the Country Party. Page subsequently made a vitriolic speech in parliament attacking Menzies&#x27;s character, and withdrew his party from the coalition – the most recent occasion on which the coalition has been broken while in government. However, a number of Page&#x27;s colleagues disagreed with his stance, and he resigned as leader in September 1939. He was replaced by Archie Cameron, and after months of negotiations the coalition was revived in March 1940, with five Country MPs joining the second Menzies ministry.

After losing eight seats at the 1940 federal election, the Coalition was plunged into minority government for the first time in its history. Archie Cameron was an immediate victim of the election result, being replaced by Arthur Fadden and later defecting to the UAP. Menzies increasingly struggled to balance his management of Australia&#x27;s war effort with domestic concerns, and his party began to rebel against him. However, the UAP was bereft of leadership despite having been in power for a decade. With this in mind, in August 1941 the Coalition collectively decided that Fadden and Menzies should swap positions, with Menzies becoming Minister for Defence Co-ordination and Fadden becoming prime minister. It was the first and only occasion on which the Coalition was led by the leader of the junior party. However, the Fadden government only lasted a few months before losing a confidence motion and being replaced by the Labor Party in the form of the Curtin government.

After the demise of the Fadden government, the Coalition voted to continue on under his leadership in opposition. Menzies had opposed this, and resigned as UAP leader, to be replaced by the ageing Billy Hughes. Up until the 1943 election, the Coalition effectively operated as a single unit, with separate party meetings being extremely rare. However, the landslide defeat it suffered – under Fadden as opposition leader – led to an immediate change in strategy. The UAP voted to break off its ties with the Country Party in opposition, and re-elected Menzies as its leader. This is the most recent occasion on which the senior partner in the Coalition has opted to withdraw.

The UAP was folded into the Liberal Party in 1945, with Menzies as leader. In the lead-up to the 1946 federal election, Menzies renewed the Coalition with the Country Party, which was still led by Fadden. They won the 1949 federal election as a Coalition, and stayed in office for a record 23 years. Since 1946, the Coalition has remained intact with two exceptions, both in opposition. The parties decided not to form a coalition opposition following their defeat in 1972, but went into the 1974 federal election as a Coalition. The Coalition remained together upon entering opposition in 1983 federal election. The Coalition suffered another break, related to the &quot;Joh for Canberra&quot; campaign, from April to August 1987, the rift healing after the 1987 federal election.

The solidity of the Coalition is so strong that when the Liberals won parliamentary majorities in their own right in the 1975, 1977 and 1996 federal elections, the Coalition was retained.

In the 2007 federal election, the Coalition lost to the Labor Party and went into opposition. The Coalition regained office in the 2013 federal election as a majority government. In October 2018, the Coalition went into minority government for the second time in its history, when the seat of Wentworth was won by Independent Kerryn Phelps in the by-election. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of incumbent Liberal MP Malcolm Turnbull, who was ousted as Prime Minister and Liberal Party leader during a spill motion earlier in August 2018. The coalition formed majority government again following the 2019 federal election. In the 2022 Australian federal election, the Coalition lost to the Labor Party and returned to opposition.

==Suggestions to merge==
In March 1973, former Prime Minister William McMahon publicly announced his support for a merger. McMahon reiterated his view after Labor won the 1974 election, and Billy Snedden, his successor as leader of the Liberal Party, also stated that he favoured a merger.

During the 1980s, former Nationals MP Peter Nixon reviewed the party and &quot;concluded it should seriously consider amalgamating with the Liberals&quot;. Former Nationals leader Doug Anthony wrote not long afterward, &quot;Any objective and rational National Party member who read this report would have to accept that amalgamation was the only realistic course. Regrettably, there are still too many who don&#x27;t want to read it and who don&#x27;t want to face reality, that the role of a specialist party looking after the needs of rural people is in decline.&quot; Nationals leader Ian Sinclair publicly rejected calls for a merger, citing the incompatibility of the National Party&#x27;s conservatism and the &quot;small-l liberal&quot; wing of the Liberal Party.

In July 1989, Senator Fred Chaney, the deputy leader of the Liberal Party, stated his tentative support for a merger, but noted that it could not be led by politicians and should come from the grassroots.

In the wake of their 2007 federal election loss, there was again talk of a merger in 2007 and 2008, as a result of a shrinking National Party vote. It was argued that the decline in the National vote is linked to a declining rural population, and National Party policies have become increasingly similar to those of the Liberal Party. However no merger took place outside of Queensland.

==Electoral organisation==
Coalition arrangements are facilitated by Australia&#x27;s preferential voting systems which enable Liberals and Nationals to compete locally in &quot;three-cornered-contests&quot;, with the Australian Labor Party (ALP), while exchanging preferences in elections. Such contests would weaken their prospects under first-past-the-post voting. From time to time, friction is caused by the fact that the Liberal and National candidates are campaigning against each other, without long-term damage to the relationship.

Indeed, the whole point of introducing preferential voting was to allow safe spoiler-free, three-cornered contests. It was a government of the Nationalist Party, a forerunner to the modern Liberal Party which introduced the legislation, following Labor&#x27;s unexpected win at the 1918 Swan by-election where the conservative vote split. Two months later, the Corangamite by-election held under preferential voting caused the initially leading ALP candidate to lose after some lower-placed candidates&#x27; preferences had been distributed.

As a result of variations on the preferential voting system used in every state and territory, the Coalition has been able to thrive, wherever both its member parties have both been active. The preferential voting system has allowed the Liberal and National parties to compete and co-operate at the same time. By contrast, a variation of the preferential system known as optional preferential voting has proven a significant handicap to coalition co-operation in Queensland and New South Wales, because significant numbers of voters do not express all useful preferences.

==Nomenclature==
Due to a disciplined coalition between the parties and their predecessors being in existence for almost 100 years with only a few brief cessations within a parliamentary system, most commentators and the general public often refer to the Coalition as if it were a single party. Polling and electoral results contain a two-party-preferred (TPP) vote which is based on Labor and the Coalition. The Australian Electoral Commission has distinguished between &quot;traditional&quot; (Coalition/Labor) two-party-preferred (TPP/2PP) contests, and &quot;non-traditional&quot; (Independent, Greens, Liberal vs National) two-candidate-preferred (TCP/2CP) contests. At the 2010 federal election, all eight seats which resulted in a two-candidate-preferred result were re-counted to also express a statistical-only &quot;traditional&quot; two-party-preferred result.

==Electorate==
As of 2022, the biggest voting blocs of the Coalition are men, the Greatest Generation (people born between 1901–1927), the middle class (as opposed to the working class), who make between 45,001–80,000 per year, and have a non-tertiary qualification or no educational qualification. Homeowners vote more for the Coalition than any other party, and the State of Queensland is its biggest electorate by two-party-preferred vote percentage (though by primary vote, Tasmania is the state with the highest Coalition vote).

The Coalition also gathers significant support from Australians in regional, rural and remote areas, whilst lacking significant support in most parts of the capital cities. However, there are regions of capital cities that do still vote for the Coalition; such as the Hills District and Sutherland and most of the Eastern Suburbs and Northern Suburbs of Sydney; some areas of Melbourne&#x27;s east and northeast; many areas of Brisbane and Perth; and the southern part of Darwin.

The Coalition has below-average support among Indian and Muslim voters. Historically, Chinese Australians have voted for the Coalition over Labor, due to a perception that Liberal Party was more business-oriented than Labor. However, this has declined in recent years. In the 2022 Australian federal election, electorates with a higher concentration of Chinese-Australian voters experienced larger swings against the Coalition compared to other electorates; in the top 15 seats by Chinese ancestry, the swing against the Coalition on a two-party-preferred basis was 6.6 per cent, compared to 3.7 per cent in other seats. This resulted in the Liberal Party losing many federal seats with large Chinese communities in 2022 to Labor (losing Bennelong and Reid in Sydney and Chisholm in Melbourne to Labor and Kooyong in Melbourne to a teal independent), as well as losing Aston in 2023, which was the first time in over a century in which the government won a seat off the opposition in a by-election. In the 2023 New South Wales state election, the top 10 electorates in terms of Chinese ancestry all saw big swings to Labor. However, the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party managed to hold many state seats with large Chinese communities (such as the Sydney seats of Drummoyne, Epping, Holsworthy, Lane Cove, Miranda, Oatley and Ryde).

==Chronology==

==Federal election results==
===House of Representatives===
==States and territories==
===New South Wales===

A Coalition between the Liberal (and predecessors) and National parties has existed without interruption in New South Wales since 1927. Predecessors of the NSW Liberal Party, including the UAP, Nationalist Party and the Democratic Party, maintained a coalition with the Country Party (old name of National Party).

The Liberal Party is led by Mark Speakman and the National Party by Dugald Saunders. The Coalition won the 2011 state election in a massive swing under Barry O&#x27;Farrell, the 2015 election with a reduced majority under Mike Baird, and the 2019 election under Gladys Berejiklian. The Coalition led by Dominic Perrottet lost the 2023 state election and is in opposition since.

New South Wales is the only state where the non-Labor Coalition has never broken, and yet has also never merged. This remained the case even in 2011, when the Liberals won a majority in their own right but still retained the Coalition. On 10 September 2020, the Nationals threatened to move to the crossbench over a dispute regarding koala protection laws, but the issue was resolved the next day and the Nationals remained in the Coalition.

===Queensland===
Due to Brisbane having a much smaller share of Queensland&#x27;s population compared to the other state capitals, Queensland is the only state in which the Nationals were consistently the stronger non-Labor party. The Nationals were the senior partner in the non-Labor Coalition from 1925 until the Coalition was broken in 1983. At an election held two months later, the Nationals under Joh Bjelke-Petersen came up one seat short of a majority, but later gained a majority when two Liberal MLAs crossed the floor to join the Nationals. The Nationals then governed in their own right until 1989. The Coalition was renewed in 1991, and won power under Rob Borbidge from 1996 to 1998.

The Queensland Liberals and Nationals had contested separately for the Senate in federal elections until the 2007 election, when they ran a join Senate ticket for the first time in 30 years. In 2008, the two parties agreed to merge, forming the Liberal National Party (LNP), under the leadership of former National Lawrence Springborg. Although it is dominated by former Nationals, it has full voting rights within the Liberal Party and observer status within the National Party. Springborg stood down in 2009, and was succeeded by former Liberal John-Paul Langbroek. The LNP won an overwhelming majority government in the 2012 state election under the leadership of former Liberal Campbell Newman, who had taken over from Langbroek a year earlier. However, it lost power in 2015 and remained in opposition for nearly a decade, returning to power in 2024.

At the federal level, 15 LNP MPs sit with the Liberals, including federal Liberal leader Peter Dutton; six sit with the Nationals, including federal Nationals leader David Littleproud. LNP Senators Matt Canavan Susan McDonald sit with the Nationals, while the LNP&#x27;s four other senators sit with the Liberals. The highest-profile LNP MP of the 2010s was former federal Nationals leader and Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss. The LNP has an informal agreement with its federal counterparts as to which party room in which LNP members will sit. Incumbent MPs retain their previous federal affiliations, whereas members who win seats from the ALP that previously belonged to the Coalition will sit with the previous member&#x27;s party. An amicable division of seats was decided upon for new seats or seats that have never been won by the Coalition. In practice, all LNP MPs from Brisbane and most LNP MPs from the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast sit with the Liberals, while those from rural seats usually sit with the Nationals.

===South Australia===
The state branch of the Country Party merged with the Liberal Federation, the state branch of the UAP, in 1932 to form the Liberal and Country League. It later became the state division of the Liberal Party when the latter was formed in 1945. A separate Country Party (later Nationals SA) was revived in 1963, though the main non-Labor party in South Australia continued to use the LCL name until it was also renamed to the Liberal Party in 1974. The revived SA Nationals have never been successful in South Australia, due to the state&#x27;s highly centralised population (some three-quarters of the population lives in Adelaide) and the Liberals&#x27; strong support in rural areas that would tilt National in most of the rest of Australia. The party&#x27;s current incarnation has only elected two representatives: Peter Blacker from 1973 to 1993, and Karlene Maywald from 1997 to 2010.

From 2004 to 2010, Maywald was a Minister in the Rann Labor government, before losing her seat at the 2010 South Australian state election, thereby informally creating a Labor-National coalition in South Australia. The National Party, at the time, rejected the notion that it was in a coalition with Labor at the state level. State National Party President John Venus told journalists, &quot;We (The Nationals) are not in coalition with the Labor Party, we aren&#x27;t in coalition with the Liberals, we are definitely not in coalition with anyone. We stand alone in South Australia as an independent party.&quot; Flinders University political scientist Haydon Manning disagreed, saying that it is &quot;churlish to describe the government as anything but a coalition&quot;. The party did not run candidates at the 2010 federal election, but ran one candidate in the seat of Barker and two for the Senate at the 2013 election. The Nationals candidate for Barker and several other Coalition figures assured electors that any Nationals elected from South Australia would be part of the Coalition, after comments from the Liberal candidate to the contrary.

===Tasmania===
The National Party has never done well in Tasmania, even though its first leader, William McWilliams, was a Tasmanian. It has elected only two other lower house members. A Tasmania branch of the then-Country Party was formed in 1922 and briefly held the balance of power, but merged with the Nationalists in 1924. It was refounded in 1962, but never gained much ground. In 1969, Liberal MHA Kevin Lyons, the son of former Prime Minister Lyons, pulled together most of the Tasmanian Country Party into the Centre Party, which held the balance of power in that year&#x27;s state election. It threw its support to the Liberals, and Lyons – the Centre Party&#x27;s lone MHA – became Deputy Premier. The Liberal–Centre alliance fell apart in 1972, forcing an early election. In 1975, what remained of the Centre Party became the Tasmanian chapter of what was by now the National Country Party before fading away completely. A Tasmanian National Party branch was briefly revived in the 1990s before it too disappeared, leaving the Liberal Party as the sole major non-Labor party in the state. In 2018, Senator Steve Martin, formerly of the Jacqui Lambie Network, joined the Nationals, becoming the party&#x27;s first federal member from Tasmania in either chamber in 90 years. However, Martin lost his bid for a new term.

===Victoria===

A Coalition between the Liberal and National parties exists in Victoria. The Liberal Party is led by Brad Battin and the National Party by Danny O&#x27;Brien.

The Country Party was the stronger coalition partner on multiple occasions from the 1920s through to the 1950s, and Country leaders served as Premier of Victoria on five separate occasions. However, the relationship between the two parties was somewhat strained for most of the second half of the 20th century. In 1948, the coalition was broken when the Liberal leader and Premier Thomas Hollway sacked Country leader John McDonald as Deputy Premier. In March 1949, the Liberals renamed themselves the Liberal and Country Party as part of an effort to merge the two non-Labor parties in Victoria. However, McDonald saw this as an attempted Liberal takeover of the Country Party, and the Country Party turned the proposed merger down. As a result, both parties competed against each other and fought elections separately from 1952 to 1989. The presence of John McEwen, a Victorian, as number-two man in the federal government from 1958 to 1971 (including a brief stint as interim Prime Minister) did little to change this.

The Liberals and Nationals reached a Coalition agreement in 1990. They fought and won the 1992 and 1996 elections as a Coalition under the leadership of Jeff Kennett. Although the Liberals won enough seats to govern alone, Kennett retained the Nationals in his government. When Peter Ryan became leader of the Nationals shortly after the Kennett government&#x27;s 1999 election defeat, he terminated the Coalition agreement and led the Nationals into the 2002 and 2006 elections separately from the Liberals. However, the Coalition agreement was renewed in 2008 and the Victorian Liberal and National parties went into the 2010 election as a Coalition. The Coalition ended up winning the 2010 election with a one-seat margin under the leadership of Ted Baillieu, who resigned in 2013 and was succeeded by Denis Napthine. The Coalition lost power at the 2014 election. The Coalition arrangement was maintained while the two parties were in opposition.

According to The Age, between November 2018 and November 2021, the Coalition&#x27;s Legislative Council members voted with the Andrews Government&#x27;s position 28.9% of the time; of the parties in the Legislative Council, only the Liberal Democratic Party had a lower figure (22.1%).

===Western Australia===
The Country Party was the stronger coalition partner from the 1933 state election to the 1947 state election, although the Coalition did not form government during this period. Western Australia has never had a premier from the Country/National Party.

In May 1949, the Liberal and Country League was formed to attempt to merge Country Party (then called County Democratic League or CDL) and Liberal Party together. This did not eventuate and the CDL did not join the new party.

The National Party was in Coalition with the Liberal Party government from 1993 to 2001 (see Hendy Cowan), but the Coalition was subsequently broken. In 2008, the Liberals under Colin Barnett, the Nationals under Brendon Grylls, and independent John Bowler formed a minority government after the 2008 election. However, it was not characterised as a &quot;traditional coalition&quot;, with limited cabinet collective responsibility for National cabinet members. Tony Crook was elected as the WA Nationals candidate for the seat of O&#x27;Connor at the 2010 federal election. Although some reports initially counted Crook as a National MP, and thus part of the Coalition, Crook sat as a crossbencher.

The Liberals won enough seats for a majority in their own right in the 2013 state election, but Barnett had announced before the election that he would retain the coalition with the Nationals. However, Barnett would have likely had to keep the Nationals in his government in any event. According to the ABC&#x27;s Antony Green, the rural weighting in the Legislative Council all but forces the WA Liberals to depend on National support even when the Liberals have enough support to govern alone. The Barnett government was heavily defeated at the 2017 state election, and the two parties went their separate ways with Liberal Party being the sole opposition party.

In the 2021 election, the Liberal Party ended up winning fewer seats than the National Party, headed by Mia Davies, with the National Party gaining opposition status and Davies becoming the first Nationals opposition leader since 1947. Following the election, the Liberal Party and Nationals Party entered into a formal alliance to form opposition, with National Party being the senior party and the Liberal Party being the junior party in the alliance. Shadow ministerial positions were also held by parliamentary members of both parties. This was similar to the agreements between both parties when they were in government following the 2008 and 2013 elections. Similar to the 2008 and 2013 agreements, the deputy leader of the senior party, Nationals deputy leader Shane Love, was the deputy opposition leader, instead of the leader of the junior party, Liberal Party leader David Honey. Under the alliance, each party maintained their independence, and could speak out on issues when there was a disagreement with their partner.

===Territories===
*Australian Capital Territory: The National Party is not affiliated in the Australian Capital Territory, leaving the Liberal Party as the sole major non-Labor party in the territory.
*Northern Territory: The two parties&#x27; branches in the Northern Territory merged in 1974, forming the Country Liberal Party. The CLP governed the Territory from 1974 to 2001 and from 2012 to 2016. The CLP retains full voting rights within the federal National Party, and has observer status with the federal Liberal Party. The CLP directs its federal members of the House and Senate whether to sit with the federal Liberals or Nationals. In practice, since the mid-1980s, CLP House members have sat with the Liberals while CLP Senators sit with the Nationals. For example, Natasha Griggs sat with the Liberals when she held the Darwin-area seat of Solomon from 2010 to 2016. CLP Senator Nigel Scullion was the leader of the Nationals in the Senate from 2007 to 2008, when he was succeeded by Barnaby Joyce. He was the federal deputy leader of the Nationals, alongside Truss, from 2007 to 2013. Joyce became federal Nationals deputy leader after his successful transition to the House of Representatives at the 2013 election, and Scullion returned as the Nationals Senate leader.

<text>Monocrete is a building construction method utilising modular bolt-together pre-cast concrete wall panels.

Monocrete construction was widely used in the construction of government housing in the 1940s and 1950s in Canberra, Australia. The expansion of the new capital was exceeding the ability of the Government to build houses, so alternative construction methods were investigated.

The Canberra monocrete homes are built on brick piers and surrounding brick footing, and all of the walls are of monocrete construction including interior ones. They are precast with steel windows and door frames set directly into the concrete. Steel plates in the ceiling space bolt the individual wall panels together. The floor and roof are of normal construction - wood and tile respectively. The gaps between the wall panels are filled with a flexible gap-filling compound and covered with tape on the interior. It has been suggested that the panels tend to move separately to one another, opening up cracks in between them, and that the houses also tend to be susceptible to condensation build up and mold growth on the inside of the walls.

A similar technique is used in the construction of some modern commercial buildings.

<text>The Southern Musical Convention was the first &quot;Sacred Harp&quot; musical convention, organized by B. F. White and others in 1845. It was formed at Huntersville in Upson County, Georgia.

From its founding until 1867, White&#x27;s &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; was the &quot;textbook&quot; of the convention. It was a collection of songs notated by shape notes and featuring four-part harmonies. Shape-note singing had been taught by preachers and missionaries during the second Great Awakening, as a way of evangelizing to people on the frontier and in rural areas. They would collect at camp meetings and spend considerable time singing these hymns. The shape notes were an eight-note system used as an easy way to teach people melodies and harmonies for singing sacred music.

After 1867, the Convention adopted a policy of using other song books. It gradually had less influence in the history of &quot;Sacred Harp.&quot; Under White&#x27;s leadership, the Southern Musical Convention sponsored three revisions of the &quot;Sacred Harp&quot; (1850, 1859, 1869). The 1849-1850 committee consisted of B. F. White, Leonard P. Breedlove, E. L. King, Joel King, R. F. M. Mann, A. Ogletree, S. R. Pennick and J. R. Turner. The second revision committee of the &quot;Sacred Harp&quot; in 1858-1859 consisted of B. F. White, R. F. Ball, J. T. Edmunds, A. Ogletree, E. T. Pound, J. P Reese, T. Waller, and A. S. Webster. The Southern Musical Convention selected White, Edmund Dumas, R. F. M. Mann, Absalom Ogletree and Marion Patrick as the committee to revise the &quot;Sacred Harp&quot; in 1869–1870.

Not only did the convention provide a gathering for vocal musicians, but it also created an authoritative body to approve of teachers for singing schools. In January 1852, the Convention authorized a newspaper, &quot;The Organ,&quot; which was published at Hamilton, Georgia the county seat of Harris County. B. F. White was &quot;Superintendent&quot; of the publication.

The Southern Musical Convention supplied the pattern for many subsequent Sacred Harp musical organizations. These included the two oldest existing Sacred Harp Conventions: the Chattahoochee Musical Convention and the East Texas Musical Convention.

<doc id="1051318" wikidata="Q1042378" url="?curid=1051318" title="Miss Australia">
<text>Miss Australia was an Australian beauty pageant held from 1908 until 2000. It was replaced by Miss World Australia from 2002, and Miss Universe Australia from 2004. From 1926 to 1991 the program operated as the Miss Australia Quest, after which the name was changed to the Miss Australia Awards.

From 1954, the contest was associated with the Spastic Centres of Australia. The winner of Miss Australia raised money for the centres through her family and friends, raising money for children and adults with cerebral palsy. The Miss Australia Quest was sponsored and organised from 1954 until the early 1960s by the lingerie manufacturer, Hickory, until Dowd Associates transferred ownership to the Australian Cerebral Palsy Association in 1963.

The pearl-encrusted Miss Australia crown was worn by titleholders from 1965 to 1991. The crown was hand-crafted in silver and blue velvet, and decorated with more than 800 pearls. Designed by Melbourne artist Ernest Booth and manufactured in Japan, the crown was presented to the Miss Australia Quest in 1965 by Toyomoto Australia Pty Ltd. The crown was last used in 1991, and is held at the National Museum of Australia.

==History==

The first Miss Australia contest was held in 1908 as a one-off event sponsored through the &quot;Lone Hand&quot;, with entrants from New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. The winner was Alice Buckridge from Victoria. The primary purpose of the contest was &quot;to attract customers: whether they were newspaper readers, patrons at an amusement venue or visitors to a country fair&quot; (Saunders and Ustinoff, 2005:4)

The Miss Australia contests of 1926 and 1927 were sponsored by &quot;Smith&#x27;s Weekly&quot; magazine and Union Theatres, with heats from each State, and were straightforward beauty contests, judged by an anonymous panel from the staff of the magazine and associated publications. Miss Australia 1937 was again sponsored by &quot;Smith&#x27;s Weekly&quot; and again had heats in each State, but judging criteria were far broader, and the judging panel comprised prominent women. The prizes for the first two centred around screen tests and an escorted trip to the movie capitals of America. The 1937 prize was a chaperoned first-class travel world tour which included London for the Coronation season. &quot;Smith&#x27;s Weekly&quot; was not involved in later Quests.

In 1953, the contest was revised by Bernard J. Dowd to promote the American Hickory lingerie that he marketed in Australia. A panel of Hickory-appointed judges in each state selected a winner based on photos sent it by young women, and then a national panel of Hickory-appointed judges chose the winner, Miss Australia.

In 1954, Colin Clay of the Queensland Spastic Welfare League asked Hickory if the Miss Australia competition could be used as a fundraiser for the league. Hickory agreed and from then on the contestants raised money for the league. Each state branch of the league would conduct its own contest to find a state winner, known as Miss Queensland, Miss New South Wales, etc, based on traditional &quot;beauty contest&quot; critieria. They would also award Miss Queensland Charity Queen, Miss New South Wales Charity Queensland, etc to the young woman who raised the most money in each state. The state finalists would then compete in the national competition for Miss Australia and Miss Australia Charity Queen.

In 1963, Dowd assigned all rights to the contest to the League.

<doc id="1051326" wikidata="Q6591823" url="?curid=1051326" title="List of NJ Transit railroad stations">
<text>NJ Transit Rail Operations provides passenger service on 12 lines at a total of 166 stations, some operated in conjunction with Amtrak and Metro-North Railroad (MNR).

NJ Transit Rail Operations (NJTR) was established by NJ Transit (NJT) to run commuter rail operations in New Jersey. In January 1983 it took over operation from Conrail, which itself had been formed in 1976 through the merger of a number of financially troubled railroads and had been operating commuter railroad service under contract from the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT). Soon after its creation, NJT commissioned a survey of operating stations, 53 of which were eventually nominated and listed on the state and federal registers of historic places in 1984. Since 2009, NJT is a stakeholder in the state&#x27;s &quot;smart growth&quot; transit-oriented development initiatives, its transit hubs forming the basis for transit villages.

The regional rail network, which serves the northern and central parts of New Jersey and Rockland and Orange counties in New York, radiates from Hoboken Terminal in Hoboken, Pennsylvania Station in Midtown Manhattan, and Pennsylvania Station in Newark. Lines intersect at Secaucus Junction. Service from Atlantic City to Center City, Philadelphia is provided by one line separate from the rest of the NJT system, though SEPTA Regional Rail service connects Philadelphia and Trenton. Amtrak provides service in New Jersey along the Northeast Corridor (NEC) between Newark and Trenton and at intermediate points.

Since its inception, NJT has closed several stations and opened new ones reflecting infrastructure improvements and discontinuance or additions in service. Some station locations, not listed here, became part of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail and the River Line, both of which were largely built along existing railroad rights-of-way. New and re-opened stations are being built or proposed along planned expansions and extensions, notably the Lackawanna Cut-Off, which is under reconstruction. Restoration of passenger service along the West Trenton Line, Monmouth-Ocean-Middlesex project right-of-ways, and the Raritan Valley/Lehigh Line, which include the reactivation/construction of new stations, have all been considered but not advanced.

==Services==


==Station designations==
===Historic register listings===
In 1981, NJT commissioned the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) to conduct a study of 112 train stations under its jurisdiction built before World War II that were still in operation. Many of thematic nomination stations are listed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places (ID#5080) on March 17, 1984. The SHPO recommended that fifty-three stations, some of which had already been listed, be included in a thematic nomination for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Forty stations were added on June 22, 1984 and the remainder added on September 29, 1984. (#64000496) Most were along former lines and heritage railroads that had become part of NJT, while West Trenton Station is used by SEPTA.

The oldest station building, built in 1868 at the Ramsey-Main Street station, was not listed. The oldest active station to be listed on NRHP was Hackensack&#x27;s 1869-built Anderson Street station, until it was destroyed in a fire and explosion in 2009, and thus was delisted. Proposals to revive service on the West Trenton Line and Lackawanna Cut-Off include the re-use of some listed stations in both New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania.

Two significant individually-listed historic stations include Newark Pennsylvania Station and Hoboken Terminal, both of which are major stations that also serve as terminals for light rail, PATH subway trains, and in the case of Hoboken, ferries across the Hudson River to Pier 11 at Wall Street and the Battery Park City Ferry Terminal.

===Transit villages===
The NJDOT established the Transit Village Initiative in 1999 to promote transit-oriented development (TOD), offering multi-agency assistance and grants to municipalities for projects which fulfill certain conditions to promote higher density development and use of public transportation within a radius of a transit hub, specifying appropriate mixed land-use strategy, available property, station-area management, and commitment to affordable housing, job growth/maintenance, and cultural activities. Transit village development must also preserve the architectural integrity of historically significant buildings and the landscape. , the state had made 30 transit village designations, many of which are centered around &quot;Main Street&quot; or central business district train stations. Since 2008, there has been significant population growth and increased ridership in neighborhoods around stations.

==Active stations==

===Operated by NJ Transit===
===Operated by others===
Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s West-of-Hudson service is operated by NJ Transit. NJ Transit owns the Pascack Valley Line right-of-way (ROW) and stations, which are leased to Metro-North. On the Port Jervis Line north of Suffern, Metro-North owns or leases the ROW under an agreement with Norfolk Southern Railway and operates the stations. Two SEPTA Regional Rail lines terminate at stations in New Jersey, one of which is not served NJ Transit.

NJ Transit and Metro-North also operated a joint &quot;Train to the Game&quot; service for football games at the Meadowlands Sports Complex with stops at , , , , , , , , , , , and on the New Haven Line.

==Proposed and future stations==

Between 2008 and 2016, New Jersey Transit added four infill stations on existing lines. , one additional infill station is planned.

Several other lines are proposed for restoration. Parts of the Lackawanna Cut-Off Restoration Project in New Jersey have been implemented and there are proposals to extend the line west and into northeastern Pennsylvania. Restoration of service along the West Trenton Line between West Trenton (with connecting service to SEPTA&#x27;s West Trenton Line) and Bridgewater where it would junction with the Raritan Valley Line (RVL) has been proposed, but not advanced. Extension of the Raritan Valley Line in connection with the Lehigh Line into Lehigh County, Pennsylvania has also been considered.

=== Proposed expansion stations ===

==Former stations==
NJ Transit has closed numerous stations since its inception due to realignments in service or low ridership.

<text>Ault Park is a park on the St. Lawrence River in the Township of South Stormont, near Long Sault, Ontario, Canada.

Originally on Sheek&#x27;s Island, the park was built on family property donated to the Township of Cornwall by Levi Addison Ault.

Sheek&#x27;s Island was submerged by the St. Lawrence Seaway project in 1958, and Ault Park was rebuilt on the new river shore.

==Lost Villages Museum==
It is now home to the Lost Villages Historical Society, who operate the Lost Villages Museum, a living museum incorporating a number of buildings moved from the villages. Other buildings from the villages were moved to a site near Morrisburg to create Upper Canada Village.

== Important archaeological digs ==
The original site of Ault Park on Sheek Island was also the site of an important archaeological excavation between 1956 and 1958, before the island and dig site were permanently submerged under 14-feet of water for the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway. This project, a joint project of the University of Toronto and the National Museum of Canada, was largely a salvage operation to conserve the artifacts left behind from many cultures of people including remnants of a village believed to date back 3500 years. The University of Toronto petitioned for an injunction against the Seaway project in order to continue the excavations however they were not successful. A number of artifacts were taken from the site for further investigation.

Some of the cultures who were found to have inhabited the island were multi-component-Middle Archaic, Laurentian, Archaic, Meadowood, Point Peninsula, Pickering, and the St. Lawrence Iroquois.

==Affiliations==
The Museum is affiliated with CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

<doc id="1051333" wikidata="Q3323122" url="?curid=1051333" title="Wenatchee Mountains">
<text>The Wenatchee Mountains are a range of mountains in central Washington State, United States of America. A major subrange of the Cascade Range, extending east from the Cascade crest, the Wenatchee Mountains separate the drainage basins of the Yakima River from the Wenatchee River. The crest of the range forms part of the boundary between Chelan and Kittitas Counties.

==Extent==
Fred Beckey describes the Wenatchee Mountains as the area between the Wenatchee and Yakima rivers and Stevens Pass. Among the range&#x27;s significant features he describes are Mount Stuart, the second highest non-volcanic peak in Washington and one of the largest single granitic mountains in the United States, the Cashmere Crags, the Lost World Plateau, Edward Plateau, and Dragontail Plateau, the Enchantment Lakes Basin (&quot;one of the most marvelous examples of an ice-sculpted wilderness in the Cascade Range″), Icicle Creek and its narrow, U-shaped valley over deep, one of the deepest in the Cascades, and the Wenatchee River&#x27;s unusual winding Tumwater Canyon gorge.

According to Peakbagger.com the Wenatchee Mountains are defined as bounded by U.S. Route 2 from Stevens Pass to Wenatchee on the Columbia River, then down the Columbia River to Interstate 90, then west along the highway to the vicinity of Cle Elum and Roslyn, then north along Cle Elum Lake and the Cle Elum River and north to Stevens Pass. Subranges of the Wenatchee Mountains and their highest peaks as defined by Peakbagger.com are the Chiwaukum Mountains (Big Chiwaukum Mountain, ), North Wenatchee Mountains (Cashmere Mountain, ), Stuart Range (Mount Stuart, ), the Teanaway Area (Ingalls Peak, ), and the Mission-Naneum Ridges (Mission Peak, ). Peakbagger.com also defines and names the mountain regions bordering the Wenatchee Mountains. These are the Alpine Lakes Area to the west, South Cascade Crest to the south, Glacier Peak-North Stevens Pass area to the northwest, and the Entiat Mountains to the northeast.

The USGS GNIS defines the range with a simple list seven points in a line, running from approximately Paddy-Go-Easy Pass and Granite Mountain to approximately Blewett Pass and Naneum Creek.

==Natural history==

The Wenatchee Mountains are in the rain shadow of the main Cascade Range and hence are drier and have fewer trees. This comparative lack of trees offers good wildflower displays and wide views. Serpentine soils are found within the Wenatchee Mountains, modifying the plant communities in those areas.

The Wenatchee Mountains are home to a number of rare, endemic, or disjunct plant species, including &quot;Androsace nivalis&quot; var. &quot;dentata&quot;, &quot;Claytonia megarhiza&quot; var. &quot;nivalis&quot;, &quot;Delphinium viridescens&quot;, &quot;Lewisiopsis tweedyi&quot;, &quot;Trifolium thompsonii&quot;, and &quot;Valeriana columbiana&quot;. The Wenatchee Mountains checkermallow (&quot;Sidalcea oregano&quot; var. &quot;calva&quot;) occurs only along Peshastin Creek, south of Leavenworth, Washington. It is the rarest plant in Washington, and is now on the endangered species list.

<text>Bob Lloyd Schieffer (born February 25, 1937) is an American television journalist. He is known for his moderation of presidential debates, where he has been praised for his capability. Schieffer is one of the few journalists to have covered all four of the major Washington national assignments: the White House, the Pentagon, United States Department of State, and United States Congress. His career with CBS has almost exclusively dealt with national politics. He has interviewed every United States President since Richard Nixon, as well as most of those who sought the office.

Schieffer has been with CBS News since 1969, serving as the anchor on the Saturday edition of &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; for 20 years, from 1976 to 1996, as well as the Chief Washington Correspondent from 1982 until 2015, and moderator of the Sunday public affairs show, &quot;Face the Nation&quot;, from 1991 until May 31, 2015. From March 10, 2005, to August 31, 2006, Schieffer was interim weekday anchor of &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, and was one of the primary substitutes for Katie Couric and Scott Pelley.

Following his retirement from &quot;Face the Nation&quot;, Schieffer has continued to work for CBS as a contributor, making many appearances on air giving political commentary covering the 2016 presidential election. Schieffer is currently releasing episodes of a new podcast, &quot;Bob Schieffer&#x27;s &#x27;About the News&#x27; with H. Andrew Schwartz&quot;.

Schieffer has written three books about his career in journalism: &quot;Face the Nation: My Favorite Stories from the First 50 Years of the Award-Winning News Broadcast&quot;, &quot;This Just In: What I Couldn&#x27;t Tell You on TV&quot;, and &quot;Bob Schieffer&#x27;s America&quot;. He co-authored a book about Ronald Reagan, &quot;The Acting President&quot;, with Gary Paul Gates, that was published in 1989. In his memoir, &quot;This Just In&quot;, Schieffer credits the fact he was a beat reporter at CBS for his longevity at the network.

Schieffer has won virtually every award in broadcast journalism, including eight Emmys, the overseas Press Club Award, the Paul White Award presented by the TV News Directors Association, and the Edward R. Murrow Award given by Murrow&#x27;s alma mater, Washington State University.

Schieffer was inducted into the Broadcasting &amp; Cable Hall of Fame in 2002, and inducted into the National Academy of Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame in 2013. He was named a living legend by the Library of Congress in 2008.

Schieffer is currently serving as the Walter Shorenstein Media and Democracy Fellow at Harvard Kennedy School&#x27;s Shorenstein Center.

==Early life==
Schieffer was born on February 25, 1937, in Austin, Texas, to John Emmitt Schieffer and Gladys Payne Schieffer, and grew up in Fort Worth, Texas. He is an alumnus of North Side High School, and received a B.A. in journalism and English in 1959 from Texas Christian University (TCU). In university he was a member of the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps and the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. The College of Communication at TCU was renamed in Bob Schieffer&#x27;s honor in 2013.

==Early career==

After graduating from TCU, Schieffer served in the United States Air Force for three years as a public information officer stationed at Travis Air Force Base and later McChord Air Force Base. He was honorably discharged and joined the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; as a reporter, with one of his key assignments being a trip to Vietnam to profile soldiers from the Fort Worth area. Schieffer was the first reporter from a Texas newspaper who reported from Vietnam.

It was at the &quot;Star Telegram&quot; that he received his first major journalistic recognition when John Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963. Shortly after President Kennedy was shot in Dallas, Texas, Schieffer was in the &quot;Star-Telegram&quot; office and received a telephone call from a woman in search of a ride to Dallas. The woman was Marguerite Oswald, Lee Harvey Oswald&#x27;s mother, whom he accompanied to the Dallas police station, where he spent the next several hours. In the company of Oswald&#x27;s mother, Marguerite, and his wife, Marina, he was able to use the phone in the police station to call in dispatches from other &quot;Star-Telegram&quot; reporters in the building. This enabled the &quot;Star-Telegram&quot; to create four &quot;Extra&quot; editions on the day of the assassination. Schieffer later joined the &quot;Star-Telegram&quot;&#x27;s television station, WBAP-TV in Fort Worth, before taking a job with CBS in 1969.

==CBS Broadcasting career==
Schieffer was anchor of the &quot;CBS Sunday Night News&quot; from 1973 to 1974, the &quot;CBS Sunday Evening News&quot; in 1976, and of the &quot;Saturday Evening News&quot; broadcast for twenty years from 1976 until 1996. He also anchored &quot;the weekday CBS morning show&quot; at the time called &quot;Morning&quot;, which was titled in accordance to the day of the week (Monday Morning, Tuesday Morning, etc.) from 1979 to 1980. One of his best known roles was as moderator of the Sunday public affairs show, &quot;Face the Nation&quot;, from 1991 until May 31, 2015.

Schieffer was also known for his reporting duties. Between 1970 and 1974, he was assigned to the Pentagon. From 1974 to 1979, he was the White House correspondent for CBS, and in 1982 he became Chief Washington Correspondent, in addition to his anchor duties.

In the wake of Dan Rather&#x27;s controversial retirement, he was named interim anchor for the weekday &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. He assumed that job on March 10, 2005, the day following Rather&#x27;s last broadcast.

Under Schieffer, the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; gained about 200,000 viewers, to average 7.7 million viewers, reversing some of the decline in ratings that occurred during Rather&#x27;s tenure; while &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; was down by 700,000 viewers, and ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Tonight&quot; lost 900,000. Schieffer closed the gap with ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Tonight&quot; when co-anchor Bob Woodruff was injured in late January 2006.

Schieffer made his last &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; broadcast on August 31, 2006, and was replaced by Katie Couric. On Couric&#x27;s second broadcast, he returned to provide segments for the evening news as chief Washington correspondent. Schieffer was also a substitute anchor for Couric and Scott Pelley when he became anchor of the evening news in June 2011.

On October 13, 2004, Schieffer was the moderator of the third presidential debate between President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry in Tempe, Arizona. On October 15, 2008, Schieffer moderated the third presidential debate between Senator Barack Obama and Senator John McCain at Hofstra University in Uniondale, New York. Schieffer also moderated the third debate of the presidential candidates in 2012, between President Obama and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, on October 22, in Boca Raton, Florida.

In 2013, Schieffer won the National Association of Broadcasters Distinguished Service Award and the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism.

==Retirement from broadcasting==

On April 8, 2015, Schieffer announced his intention to retire as host of &quot;Face the Nation&quot; while speaking at his alma mater, Texas Christian University. Schieffer departed after working in journalism for 52 years, 46 of those years with CBS. On the April 12 broadcast of the program, he announced that John Dickerson, the political director for CBS, would succeed him, beginning in June 2015.

As he prepared to retire from &quot;Face The Nation&quot;, Schieffer reflected on the acclaim that came his way during the latter stages of his career. &quot;The interesting thing about my life — a lot of the recognition I got was after most people retired,&quot; he told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, going on to add, &quot;I think that people just became familiar with me just because I had been there and others had come and gone.&quot;

Schieffer&#x27;s final broadcast as moderator of &quot;Face the Nation&quot; was on May 31, 2015.

==Singing career==
Since leaving the anchor desk at &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; in 2006, Schieffer has entertained his longstanding interest in songwriting by collaborating with musicians in New York and Washington, D.C. His latest efforts have resulted in four songs with the Washington area band, Honky Tonk Confidential, all of which appear on their CD, &quot;Road Kill Stew and Other News (with Special Guest Bob Schieffer)&quot;. Schieffer sings &quot;TV Anchorman&quot;, and wrote the lyrics for the other songs.

==Personal life==

Schieffer married Patricia Penrose in 1967; they have two daughters and three granddaughters.

Schieffer is the older brother of Tom Schieffer, a long time Texas state legislator and friend and former business partner of President George W. Bush, who was appointed U.S. Ambassador to Australia from 2001 to 2005 by President Bush, and served as U.S. Ambassador to Japan from 2005 through 2009. In 2009, Tom Schieffer campaigned for the Democratic nomination for governor but withdrew from the race on November 23, 2009, citing an inability to raise enough cash to fund an effective campaign.

Schieffer has a sister, Sharon Schieffer Mayes, who is a retired teacher and school administrator who taught science for 17 years before becoming the Vice Principal of Dunbar High School in Fort Worth, Texas. Sharon Mayes eventually became the high school principal at Keller High School at a time when only 2 percent of the principals in the largest high schools in Texas were women.

Schieffer is a survivor of grade III bladder cancer. He was diagnosed in 2003 and has been cancer-free since 2004. He has been diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes, and is on insulin therapy.

==Popular culture==

After fellow CBS newscaster and Texan Dan Rather was switched from the White House beat to hosting the documentary show, &quot;CBS Reports&quot;, in 1974, the October 13, 1974, edition of the &quot;Doonesbury&quot; comic strip featured a joking fantasy scene in which Schieffer, his successor, haltingly comments on the transition: &quot;It was the affiliatesthey just couldn&#x27;t take him. I mean let&#x27;s face it, Dan wasn&#x27;t exactly MR. TACT!. I dunno... Maybe it&#x27;s just as well in the long run, I mean, you know? Anyway, this is Robert Schieffer at the White House...&quot; (Schieffer notes that &quot;The strip was right on except for one thing. My real name is Bob, not Robert&quot;).

Schieffer had a cameo appearance beside Harrison Ford in the 2010 film, &quot;Morning Glory&quot;, along with his CBS News colleague Morley Safer as well as MSNBC&#x27;s Chris Matthews.
He also had a cameo appearance on television series &quot;Madam Secretary&quot; in the episode named &quot;Face of Nation&quot;.

<text>The Chiwaukum Mountains are a north–south mountain range in central Washington, United States. They stretch from Snowgrass Mountain at , to .

The mountains are made of schist, part of the Nason terrane. The original rock in the Nason terrane was laid down 210 Myr ago. The terrane then smashed into the western coastline of the continent, and the Mount Stuart batholith intruded into it in the late Cretaceous. The intrusion of the granitic rock metamorphosed the rock into schist.

In July 2014, the lightning-caused Chiwaukum Creek Fire burned the east flank of the Chiwaukum Mountains.

<text>The Stuart Range is a mountain range in central Washington, United States. The range lies within the eastern extent of the Cascade Range immediately southwest of Leavenworth and runs east–west. The western peaks make up a single sharp ridge. The eastern half of the range splits into two parallel ridges, the northern of which is known as the Enchantment Peaks. Between these ridges lies the Enchantment Basin, which holds the dozens of tarns known as the Enchantment Lakes. Collectively, the basin and the encircling eastern peaks of the Stuart Range make up The Enchantments, a well-known backpacking destination. The south face of the Stuart Range falls off steeply to Ingalls Creek, beyond which rise the roughly parallel Wenatchee Mountains.

==Geology==
The Mount Stuart batholith underlies the Stuart Range and the nearby Wenatchee Mountains. The batholith is about 13 by 16 miles in extent. Two plutonic masses are separated by a thin screen of Chiwaukum Schist and rocks of the Ingalls Complex. The more-eastern pluton is 93 million years old, while the more-western rock mass is between 83 and 86 million years old. Exposed rock tends to be quartz diorite and granodiorite.

The range sits near a convergent plate boundary where one plate overrides another. In Western Washington, the North American Plate overrides the Juan de Fuca Plate, resulting in both volcanic and seismic activity. This convergence has been ongoing for over 200 million years. Continuing uplift and erosion has exposed the underlying granite batholith, making for one of the more spectacular mountain ranges in Washington.

<text>Jacuzzi is an American private company that manufactures and markets hot tubs, pools, and other bath products. It is best known for the Jacuzzi hydrotherapy products. The company is headquartered in Irvine, California. It is the largest hot tub manufacturer in Europe with eight factories, the largest being in Italy.

The company was founded in 1915 by seven Italian immigrant brothers from the Jacuzzi family in Berkeley, California. It developed a variety of products including pumps for agricultural use. In 1948, Jacuzzi created water pumps to treat a family member&#x27;s rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/saga-jacuzzi-family&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The water pumps were a niche medical product until they were integrated into a recreational hot tub in 1968. As the popularity of hot tubs grew, Jacuzzi created more models that were more advanced. Jacuzzi was family-run until 1979, after which it then changed hands several times, before being bought by its current owner Investindustrial in 2019.

Due to its popularity and market dominance among hot tub sales, the word &quot;Jacuzzi&quot; became akin to a generic trademark in advertising and product marketing, synonymous with &quot;hot tub&quot; itself in American English. However, the Associated Press Stylebook lists Jacuzzi as a trademark brand for products such as hot tubs, whirlpool spas, and whirlpool baths, and not as a legally genericized trademark.

== History ==
===Beginnings===
Jacuzzi was founded by seven siblings in the Jacuzzi family: Giocondo, Frank, Rachele, Candido, Joseph, Gelindo and Valeriano, who were from Casarsa della Delizia in northern 
Italy. Their original last name was Iacuzzi, but when the first two brothers emigrated from Italy to the US in 1907, immigration staff misspelled their name as &quot;Jacuzzi&quot;. All seven siblings had emigrated by 1910. More family members emigrated to the U.S. when the brothers won a contract to provide propellers to the U.S. for World War I planes.

Jacuzzi began as a machining company. The brothers worked on a citrus farm owned by an early aviation inventor. They offered to help develop aviation products, creating an early wood propeller that was curved instead of flat and was used in World War I. One of the first propellers they made is now either in storage at or on loan from the Smithsonian Institution. They also developed one of the first fully-enclosed cabins for airplanes, called the Jacuzzi J-7, which was used to transport mail.

In 1921, a mail plane crashed, killing all of the passengers on board, including Giocondo Jacuzzi.
The siblings subsequently abandoned the aviation industry and experimented with several other products, the first successful one being a water pump created by Rachele Jacuzzi in 1926.
The product line expanded into a variety of pumps.

=== Hydrotherapy ===
In 1948, Candido Jacuzzi developed an improved full body hydrotherapy pump, the J-300, to treat his son&#x27;s (Ken Jacuzzi) rheumatoid arthritis between hospital visits, after noting his positive response the smaller Hubbard tank at the Herrick hospital in Berkeley. He patented the pump in 1952 and began marketing it between 1955 and 1956 as a therapeutic aid. The pump was a portable device that could turn any regular bathtub into a spa.

From 1968, a whirlpool bath was produced, which included jets that mixed air and water. This product (called the Roman Bath) was developed by Roy Jacuzzi, a 3rd-generation member of the family. This is considered the first whirlpool tub designed for relaxation, rather than for medical use. Jacuzzi used celebrity Jayne Mansfield and others to market the tubs, which initially gained popularity among Hollywood movie stars. In the 1970s, Jacuzzi products were featured on Queen for a Day and other TV shows and grew in popularity in California. The company started developing larger models that could fit more than one person. They also added filters and heaters, so the tub didn&#x27;t need to be drained with each use. From 1970, family-sized spas were producted.

By 1989, Jacuzzi had 2,200 employees. Initially, Jacuzzi primarily sold through contractors and builders, but in 1993 it started selling through retailers. In the 1990s Jacuzzi entered markets outside the US, especially in Italy and Spain. By the end of the 1990s, half of its sales were outside the US.

Jacuzzi was influential in the trend towards larger and more luxurious bathrooms.

===Changes in ownership===
By 1979, there were 257 Jacuzzi family members involved in the Jacuzzi brand and there was a growing number of disputes among them. Then the business was acquired by Kidde for $70 million. Most of the Jacuzzi family members left the company, except Roy Jacuzzi, who stayed on as the head of the hot tub and bath division. In 1987, Kidde was acquired by Hanson PLC. In 1995 Hanson spun off Jacuzzi and other brands into a public company called U.S. Industries. USI renamed itself Jacuzzi Brands in 2003. This was in turn bought out by Apollo Management, and then by Investindustrial in 2019.

Acquisitions since the 1990s have included Haugh Products (above-ground pools), Sundance Spas, Gatsby Spas, Zurn Industries (toilets, sinks), Hydropool (hot tubs), Liners Direct (bath products), BathWraps (shower and bathtub renovation). In the 1990s, Jacuzzi had taken on too much debt and sold more than $600 million worth of businesses. The business segment producing industrial, irrigation, well water, submersible, and centrifugal systems was sold to Franklin Electric in 2004. The plumbing division, Zurn Industries, was sold in 2007 for $950 million. Current brands include ThermoSpas, Sundance Spas, and Dimension One.

<doc id="1051351" wikidata="Q213732" url="?curid=1051351" title="Karl Max, Prince Lichnowsky">
<text>Karl Max, Prince Lichnowsky (8 March 1860 – 27 February 1928) was a German diplomat who served as ambassador to Britain during the July Crisis and who was the author of a 1916 pamphlet that deplored German diplomacy in mid-1914 which, he argued, contributed heavily to the outbreak of the First World War. 

==Pre-1914 life and career==
He was the sixth Prince and eighth Count Lichnowsky. He succeeded his father in 1901. His father was Carl, Prince Lichnowsky (1819–1901), fifth Prince and seventh Count Lichnowsky, a general of cavalry, and his mother was Marie, Princess of Croy (1837–1915). He was the head of an old noble Bohemian family, possessing estates at Kuchelna, then in Austrian Silesia, and Grätz in Moravia (present Hradec nad Moravicí, Czech Republic). As a hereditary member of the upper house of the Prussian Diet for the Free Conservative Party, Lichnowsky played a part in domestic politics, adopting in general a moderate attitude and deprecating partisan legislation. Though a Roman Catholic, he avoided identifying himself with the clerical party in Germany.

Entering the diplomatic service, Lichnowsky was appointed an attaché at the London embassy in 1885 and later served as legation secretary at Bucharest. He became German Ambassador to Austria-Hungary in 1902, replacing Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg, but was forced into retirement in 1904, accused of too much independence from the Foreign Office after several conflicts with Friedrich von Holstein, head of the Office&#x27;s political division. In 1904, he married Countess Mechtilde von Arco-Zinneberg (1879–1958).

He spent eight years in retirement, as his memoirs relate, &quot;on my farm and in my garden, on horseback and in the fields, but reading industriously and publishing occasional political articles.&quot; For several years, newspaper rumour in Germany had connected the name Lichnowsky with practically every important diplomatic post that became vacant, and even with the Imperial chancellorship. No official appointment was forthcoming, however, beyond the designation of privy councilor (German: &quot;Wirklicher Geheimrat&quot;) in 1911.

In 1912, Lichnowsky was appointed ambassador to the United Kingdom, in which post he served until the outbreak of war in 1914. Soon after his appointment, he filed a report on a conversation with Lord Haldane, British secretary of state for war. In it, Haldane had made clear that Britain could go to war if Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia and Germany attacked France. The report was said to have infuriated Kaiser Wilhelm II.

==The 1914 Crisis==
During the July Crisis of 1914, Lichnowsky was the only German diplomat who raised objections to Germany&#x27;s efforts to provoke an Austro-Serbian war, arguing that Britain would intervene in a continental war. On 25 July, he implored the German government to accept an offer of British mediation in the Austro-Serbian dispute. On 27 July, he followed with a cable arguing that Germany could not win a continental war. This cable was not shown to Kaiser Wilhelm II. A cable on 28 July relayed an offer from King George V to hold a conference of European ambassadors to avoid general war. A final cable on 29 July to the German Foreign Office stated simply &quot;if war breaks out it will be the greatest catastrophe the world has ever seen.&quot; These warnings went unheeded, and by the time the final cable reached Berlin, Austrian troops were already bombarding Belgrade.

On Britain&#x27;s declaration of war on 4 August 1914, Lichnowsky returned to Germany. So highly was he thought of, a British military guard of honour saluted his departure – a rare privilege in the circumstances.

==His 1916 pamphlet==

His privately printed pamphlet, &quot;My Mission to London 1912–1914&quot;, circulated in German upper-class circles in 1916, accused his government of failing to support him in efforts to avert World War I; its 1917 publication in the United States led to his expulsion from the Prussian House of Lords. In 1918, the renamed &quot;Lichnowsky Memorandum&quot; was published in &quot;The Disclosures from Germany&quot; (New York: American Association for International Conciliation, 1918). It was also published in the Danish journal &quot;Politiken&quot; in March 1918, from which a British copy was published by Cassell &amp; Co., later in 1918, with a preface by Professor Gilbert Murray.

The pamphlet mainly covers the period 1912–1914, and occasionally back to 1900. Lichnowsky deplored the German alliance with Austria-Hungary (though he owned land in Austria and had served as a diplomat in Vienna), feeling that it inevitably pulled German diplomacy into Balkan crises and tensions with Russia, without any compensating benefits to Germany with its new industries, trade and colonies. &quot;This is a return to the days of the Holy Roman Empire and the mistakes of the Hohenstaufens and Habsburgs,&quot; he wrote.

The Kaiser had commented on 31 July 1914 about an encircling British diplomacy during the crisis: &quot;For I no longer have any doubt that England, Russia and France have agreed among themselves, knowing that our treaty obligations compel us to support Austria-Hungary, to use the Austro-Serb conflict as a pretext for waging a war of annihilation against us. ... Our dilemma over keeping faith with the old and honourable Emperor has been exploited to create a situation which gives England the excuse she has been seeking to annihilate us with a spurious appearance of justice on the pretext that she is helping France and maintaining the well-known Balance of Power in Europe, i.e. playing off all European States for her own benefit against us.&quot;

In contrast, Lichnowsky outlined how the British foreign minister Sir Edward Grey had helped, with two treaties, on dividing the Portuguese Empire and establishing the Berlin–Baghdad railway, and had supported Germany&#x27;s policy in the resolution of the Balkan Wars in 1912 and 1913 that excluded Russia. Britain had held back from declaring war until 4 August, after Belgium had been invaded, yet in a telegram sent to him from Berlin on 1 August: &quot;... England was already mentioned as an opponent...&quot;

Lichnowsky summed up his view on blame for the outbreak of war, and the failure of diplomacy, in three main points:

* &quot;We [Germany] encouraged Count Berchtold [Austrian foreign minister] to attack Serbia, although German interests were not involved and the danger of a world-war must have been known to us. Whether we were aware of the wording of the [Austrian] Ultimatum is completely immaterial.&quot;
* Between 23 and 30 July, Sergey Sazonov, the Russian foreign minister, having declared that Russia would not tolerate an attack on Serbia, all attempts to mediate the crisis were rebuffed by Germany. In the meantime, Serbia had replied to the Austrian ultimatum and Berchtold was &quot;content ... with the Serbian reply&quot;.
* &quot;On the 30th July, when Berchtold wanted to come to terms (with Serbia]), we sent an ultimatum to Petrograd [Russia], merely because of the Russian mobilisation, although Austria was not attacked; and on the 31st July we declared war on Russia, although the Czar pledged his word that he would not order a man to march (against Germany), as long as negotiations were proceeding – thus deliberately destroying the possibility of a peaceful settlement.&quot;

&quot;In view of the above, undeniable, facts, it is no wonder that the whole of the civilised world outside Germany places the entire responsibility for the world war upon our shoulders.&quot;

At the pamphlet&#x27;s end, he forecasts that the Central Powers were doomed to lose World War I, and says: &quot;The world will belong to the Anglo-Saxons, Russians and Japanese.&quot; The German role, he wrote, &quot;will be that of thought and commerce, not that of the bureaucrat and soldier. (Germany) made its appearance too late, and its last chance of making good the past, that of founding a Colonial Empire, was annihilated by the world war.&quot;

The pamphlet heavily influenced the minds of the French and British politicians who promulgated the Versailles Peace Treaty in 1919. 

==Comments==
In his column in the 11 May 1918 issue of &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;, G. K. Chesterton would note:

:&quot;And, what is worse, the spirit of this cheerless impudence has sometimes spread and chilled the blood of better men. I have noticed it lately in the last stiff pose of people who still try the stale game of blaming everybody for the war, long after the Lichnowsky revelations and the peace imposed on Russia have quite finally fixed the blame.&quot;

The latter refers to the harsh terms the Germans imposed on Russia in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in early March 1918. Chesterton was reminding his readers that, were Germany to win the war in the west, it would impose equally harsh terms on Belgium and France, in line with the 1914 Septemberprogramm.

Professor Murray summarised his 1918 foreword to the pamphlet with: 
:&quot;The cleaner our national conscience the keener surely will be our will to victory. The slower we were to give up the traditions of generosity and trustfulness that came from our long security, the firmer will be our resolution to hold out...&quot;

Lichnowsky was seen as a &#x27;Good German&#x27; who had truthfully warned his government but had been ignored at the crucial moment.

Lichnowsky&#x27;s viewpoint was largely followed by the influential historian Fritz Fischer in his 1961 book &quot;Germany&#x27;s Aims in the First World War&quot;.

<doc id="1051355" wikidata="Q190736" url="?curid=1051355" title="Sawfish">
<text>Sawfish, also known as carpenter sharks, are a family of rays characterized by a long, narrow, flattened rostrum, or nose extension, lined with sharp transverse teeth, arranged in a way that resembles a saw. They are among the largest fish, with some species reaching lengths of about . They are found worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions in coastal marine and brackish estuarine waters, as well as freshwater rivers and lakes. All species are critically endangered.

They should not be confused with sawsharks (order Pristiophoriformes) or the extinct sclerorhynchoids (order Rajiformes) which have a similar appearance, or swordfish (family Xiphiidae) which have a similar name but a very different appearance.

Sawfishes are relatively slow breeders and the females give birth to live young. They feed on fish and invertebrates that are detected and captured with the use of their saw. They are generally harmless to humans, but can inflict serious injuries with the saw when captured and defending themselves.

Sawfish have been known and hunted for thousands of years, and play an important mythological and spiritual role in many societies around the world.

Once common, sawfish have experienced a drastic decline in recent decades, and the only remaining strongholds are in Northern Australia and Florida, United States. All five species are rated as Critically Endangered by the IUCN. They are hunted for their fins (shark fin soup), use of parts as traditional medicine, their teeth and saw. They also face habitat loss. Sawfish have been listed by CITES since 2007, restricting international trade in them and their parts. They are protected in Australia, the United States and several other countries, meaning that sawfish caught by accident have to be released and violations can be punished with hefty fines.

== Taxonomy and etymology==
The scientific names of the sawfish family Pristidae and its type genus &quot;Pristis&quot; are derived from the .

Despite their appearance, sawfish are rays (superorder Batoidea). The sawfish family has traditionally been considered the sole living member of the order Pristiformes, but recent authorities have generally subsumed it into Rhinopristiformes, an order that now includes the sawfish family, as well as families containing guitarfish, wedgefish, banjo rays and the like. Sawfish quite resemble guitarfish, except that the latter group lacks a saw, and their common ancestor likely was similar to guitarfish.

===Living species===
The species level taxonomy in the sawfish family has historically caused considerable confusion and was often described as chaotic. Only in 2013 was it firmly established that there are five living species in two genera.

&quot;Anoxypristis&quot; contains a single living species that historically was included in &quot;Pristis&quot;, but the two genera are morphologically and genetically highly distinct. Today &quot;Pristis&quot; contains four living, valid species divided into two species groups. Three species are in the smalltooth group, and there is only a single in the largetooth group. Three poorly defined species were formerly recognized in the largetooth group, but in 2013 it was shown that &quot;P. pristis&quot;, &quot;P. microdon&quot; and &quot;P. perotteti&quot; do not differ in morphology or genetics. As a consequence, recent authorities treat &quot;P. microdon&quot; and &quot;P. perotteti&quot; as junior synonyms of &quot;P. pristis&quot;.

===Extinct (fossil) species===

In addition to the living sawfish, there are several extinct species that only are known from fossil remains found around the world in all continents. &quot;Peyeria&quot; from the Cenomanian age (Late Cretaceous) was once considered as the oldest known pristid, though it may represent a rhinid rather than a sawfish, or probably a junior synonym of the sclerorhynchoid &quot;Onchopristis&quot;. Indisputable sawfish genera emerged in the Cenozoic age about 60 million years ago, relatively soon after the Cretaceous–Paleogene mass extinction. Among these are &quot;Propristis&quot;, a monotypic genus only known from fossil remains, as well as several extinct &quot;Pristis&quot; species and several extinct &quot;Anoxypristis&quot; species (both of these genera are also represented by living species). Historically, palaeontologists have not separated &quot;Anoxypristis&quot; from &quot;Pristis&quot;. In contrast, several additional extinct genera are occasionally listed, including &quot;Dalpiazia&quot;, &quot;Onchopristis&quot;, &quot;Oxypristis&quot;, and &quot;Mesopristis&quot;, but recent authorities generally include the first two genera within Sclerorhynchoidei and the last two are synonyms of &quot;Anoxypristis&quot;.

The extinct order Sclerorhynchoidei had long rostra with large denticles similar to sawfishes and sawsharks. This feature was convergently evolved, recently proposed as &#x27;pristification&#x27;, and their closest living relatives are actually skates. While they are often called &quot;sawfishes&quot;, the more accurate common name for sclerorhynchoids is &quot;sawskates&quot;.

== Appearance and anatomy ==
Sawfish are dull brownish, greyish, greenish or yellowish above, but the shade varies and dark individuals can be almost black. The underside is pale, and typically whitish.

===Saw===
The most distinctive feature of sawfish is their saw-like rostrum with a row of whitish teeth (rostral teeth) on either side of it. The rostrum is an extension of the chondrocranium (&quot;skull&quot;), made of cartilage and covered in skin. The rostrum length is typically about one quarter to one third of the total length of the fish, but it varies depending on species, and sometimes with age and sex. The rostral teeth are not teeth in the traditional sense, but heavily modified dermal denticles. The rostral teeth grow in size throughout the life of the sawfish and a tooth is not replaced if it is lost. In &quot;Pristis&quot; sawfish, the teeth are found along the entire length of the rostrum, but, in adult &quot;Anoxypristis&quot;, there are no teeth on the basal one-quarter of the rostrum (about one-sixth in juvenile &quot;Anoxypristis&quot;). The number of teeth varies depending on the species and can range from 14 to 37 on each side of the rostrum. It is common for a sawfish to have slightly different tooth counts on each side of its rostrum. (The difference typically does not surpass three.) In some species, females on average have fewer teeth than males. Each tooth is peg-like in &quot;Pristis&quot; sawfish, and flattened and broadly triangular in &quot;Anoxypristis&quot;. A combination of features, including fins and rostrum, are typically used to separate the species, but it is possible to do it by the rostrum alone.

===Head, body and fins===

Sawfish have a strong shark-like body, a flat underside and a flat head. &quot;Pristis&quot; sawfish have a rough sandpaper-like skin texture because of the covering of dermal denticles, but in &quot;Anoxypristis&quot; the skin is largely smooth. The mouth and nostrils are placed on the underside of the head. There are about 88–128 small, blunt-edged teeth in the upper jaw of the mouth and about 84–176 in the lower jaw (not to be confused with the teeth on the saw). These are arranged in 10–12 rows on each jaw, and somewhat resemble a cobblestone road. They have small eyes and behind each is a spiracle, which is used to draw water past the gills. The gill slits, five on each side, are placed on the underside of the body near the base of the pectoral fins. The position of the gill openings separates them from the superficially similar yet generally much smaller (up to long) sawsharks, in which the slits are on the side of the neck. Unlike sawfish, sawsharks also have a pair of long barbels on the rostrum (&quot;saw&quot;).

Sawfish have two relatively high and distinct dorsal fins, wing-like pectoral and pelvic fins, and a tail with a distinct upper lobe and a variably sized lower lobe (lower lobe relatively large in &quot;Anoxypristis&quot;; small to absent in &quot;Pristis&quot; sawfish). The position of the first dorsal fin compared to the pelvic fins varies and is a useful feature for separating some of the species. There are no anal fins.

Like other elasmobranches, sawfish lack a swim bladder (instead controlling their buoyancy with a large oil-rich liver), and have a skeleton consisting of cartilage. Males have claspers, a pair of elongated structures used for mating and positioned on the underside at the pelvic fins. The claspers are small and indistinct in young males.

Their small intestines contain an internal partition shaped like a corkscrew, called a spiral valve, which increases the surface area available for food absorption.

===Size===
Sawfish are large to very large fish, but the maximum size of each species is generally uncertain. The smalltooth sawfish, largetooth sawfish and green sawfish are among the world&#x27;s largest fish. They can certainly all reach about in total length and there are reports of individuals larger than , but these are often labeled with some uncertainty. Typically reported maximum total lengths of these three are from . Large individuals may weigh as much as , or possibly even more. Old unconfirmed and highly questionable reports of much larger individuals do exist, including one that reputedly had a length of , another that had a weight of , and a third that was long and weighed .

The two remaining species, the dwarf sawfish and narrow sawfish, are considerably smaller, but are still large fish with a maximum total length of at least and respectively. In the past it was often reported that the dwarf sawfish only reaches about , but this is now known to be incorrect.

== Distribution ==
===Range===
Sawfish are found worldwide in tropical and subtropical waters.

Historically they ranged in the East Atlantic from Morocco to South Africa, and in the West Atlantic from New York (United States) to Uruguay, including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. There are old reports (last in the late 1950s or shortly after) from the Mediterranean and these have typically been regarded as vagrants, but a review of records strongly suggests that this sea had a breeding population. In the East Pacific they ranged from Mazatlán (Mexico) to northern Peru. Although the Gulf of California occasionally has been included in their range, the only known Pacific Mexican records of sawfish are from south of its mouth. They were widespread in the western and central Indo-Pacific, ranging from South Africa to the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, east and north to Korea and southern Japan, through Southeast Asia to Papua New Guinea and Australia. Today sawfish have disappeared from much of their historical range.

===Habitat===
Sawfish are primarily found in coastal marine and estuarine brackish waters, but they are euryhaline (can adapt to various salinities) and also found in freshwater. The largetooth sawfish, alternatively called the freshwater sawfish, has the greatest affinity for freshwater. For example, it has been reported as far as up the Amazon River and in Lake Nicaragua, and its young spend the first years of their life in freshwater. In contrast, the smalltooth, green and dwarf sawfish typically avoid pure freshwater, but may occasionally move far up rivers, especially during periods when there is an increased salinity. There are reports of narrow sawfish seen far upriver, but these need confirmation and may involve misidentifications of other species of sawfish.

Sawfish are mostly found in relatively shallow waters, typically at depths less than , and occasionally less than . Young prefer very shallow places and are often found in water only deep. Sawfish can occur offshore, but are rare deeper than . An unidentified sawfish (either a largetooth or smalltooth sawfish) was captured off Central America at a depth in excess of .

The dwarf and largetooth sawfish are strictly warm-water species that generally live in waters that are and respectively. The green and smalltooth sawfish also occur in colder waters, in the latter down to , as illustrated by their (original) distributions that ranged further north and south of the strictly warm-water species. Sawfish are bottom-dwellers, but in captivity it has been noted that at least the largetooth and green sawfish readily take food from the water surface. Sawfish are mostly found in places with soft bottoms such as mud or sand, but may also occur over hard rocky bottoms or at coral reefs. They are often found in areas with seagrass or mangrove.

Sawsharks are typically found much deeper, often at depths in excess of , and when shallower mostly in colder subtropical or temperate waters than sawfish.

== Behavior ==
===Breeding and life cycle===
Relatively little is known about the reproductive habits of the sawfish, but all species are ovoviviparous with the adult females giving birth to live young once a year or every second year. In general, males appear to reach sexual maturity at a slightly younger age and smaller size than females. As far as known, sexual maturity is reached at an age of 7–12 years in &quot;Pristis&quot; and 2–3 years in &quot;Anoxypristis&quot;. In the smalltooth and green sawfish this equals a total length of , in the largetooth sawfish at , in the dwarf sawfish about , and in the narrow sawfish at . This means that the generation length is about 4.6 years in the narrow sawfish and 14.6–17.2 years in the remaining species.

Mating involves the male inserting a clasper, organs at the pelvic fins, into the female to fertilize the eggs. As known from many elasmobranchs, the mating appears to be rough, with the sawfish often sustaining lacerations from its partner&#x27;s saw. However, through genetic testing it has been shown that at least the smalltooth sawfish also can reproduce by parthenogenesis where no male is involved and the offspring are clones of their mother. In Florida, United States, it appears that about 3% of the smalltooth sawfish offspring are the result of parthenogenesis. It is speculated that this may be in response to being unable to find a partner, allowing the females to reproduce anyway.

The pregnancy lasts several months. There are 1–23 young in each sawfish litter, which are long at birth. In the embryos the rostrum is flexible and it only hardens shortly before birth. To protect the mother the saws of the young have a soft cover, which falls off shortly after birth. The pupping grounds are in coastal and estuarine waters. In most species the young generally stay there for the first part of their lives, occasionally moving upriver when there is an increase in salinity. The exception is the largetooth sawfish where the young move upriver into freshwater where they stay for 3–5 years, sometimes as much as from the sea. In at least the smalltooth sawfish the young show a degree of site fidelity, generally staying in the same fairly small area in the first part of their lives. In the green and dwarf sawfish there are indications that both sexes remain in the same overall region throughout their lives with little mixing between the subpopulations. In the largetooth sawfish the males appear to move more freely between the subpopulations, while mothers return to the region where they were born to give birth to their own young.

The length of the full lifespan of sawfish is labeled with considerable uncertainty. A green sawfish caught as a juvenile lived for 35 years in captivity, and a smalltooth sawfish lived for more than 42 years in captivity. In the narrow sawfish it has been estimated that the lifespan is about 9 years, and in the &quot;Pristis&quot; sawfish it has been estimated that it varies from about 30 to more than 50 years depending on the exact species.

===Electrolocation===
The rostrum (saw), unique among jawed fish, plays a significant role in both locating and capturing prey. The head and rostrum contain thousands of sensory organs, the ampullae of Lorenzini, that allow the sawfish to detect and monitor the movements of other organisms by measuring the electric fields they emit. Electroreception is found in all cartilaginous fishes and some bony fishes. In sawfish the sensory organs are packed most densely on the upper- and underside of the rostrum, varying in position and numbers depending on the species. Utilizing their saw as an extended sensing device, sawfish are able to examine their entire surroundings from a position close to the seafloor. It appears that sawfish can detect potential prey by electroreception from a distance of about . Some waters where sawfish live are very murky, limiting the possibility of hunting by sight.

===Feeding===
Sawfish are predators that feed on fish, crustaceans and molluscs. Old stories of sawfish attacking large prey such as whales and dolphins by cutting out pieces of flesh are now considered to be wholly unsubstantiated. Humans are far too large to be considered potential prey. In captivity they are typically fed &quot;ad libitum&quot; or in set amounts that (per week) equal 1–4% of the total weight of the sawfish, but there are indications that captives grow considerably faster than their wild counterparts.

Exactly how they use their saw after the prey has been located has been debated, and some scholarship on the subject has been based on speculations rather than real observations. In 2012 it was shown that there are three primary techniques, informally called &quot;saw in water&quot;, &quot;saw on substrate&quot; and &quot;pin&quot;. If a prey item such as a fish is located in the open water, the sawfish uses the first method, making a rapid swipe at the prey with its saw to incapacitate it. It is then brought to the seabed and eaten. The &quot;saw on substrate&quot; is similar, but used on prey at the seabed. The saw is highly streamlined and when swiped it causes very little water movement. The final method involves pinning the prey against the seabed with the underside of the saw, in a manner similar to that seen in guitarfish. The &quot;pin&quot; is also used to manipulate the position of the prey, allowing fish to be swallowed head-first and thus without engaging any possible fin spines. The spines of catfish, a common prey, have been found imbedded in the rostrum of sawfish. Schools of mullets have been observed trying to escape sawfish. Prey fish are typically swallowed whole and not cut into small pieces with the saw, although on occasion one may be split in half during capture by the slashing motion. Prey choice is therefore limited by the size of the mouth. A sawfish had a catfish in its stomach.

It had been suggested that sawfish use their saw to dig/rake in the bottom for prey, but this was not observed during a 2012 study, or supported by later hydrodynamic studies. Large sawfish often have rostral teeth with tips that are notably worn.

===Saw and self-defense===
Old stories often describe sawfish as highly dangerous to humans, sinking ships and cutting people in half, but today these are considered myths and not factual. Sawfish are actually docile and not aggressive to humans and only use their saws against people defensively such as when captured; they can inflict serious injuries when defending themselves, by thrashing the saw from side to side. The saw is also used in self-defense against predators, such as sharks, that may eat sawfish. In captivity, they have been seen using their saws during fights over hierarchy or food.

==Relationship with humans==

===In history, culture and mythology===

The largetooth sawfish was among the species formally described by Carl Linnaeus (as &quot;&quot;Squalus pristis&quot;) in &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1758, but sawfish were already known thousands of years earlier.

Sawfish were occasionally mentioned in antiquity, in works such as Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; (77–79 AD). &quot;Pristis&quot;, the scientific name formalised for sawfish by Linnaeus in 1758, was also in use as a name even before his publication. For example, sawfish or &quot;priste&quot; were included in &quot;Libri de piscibus marinis in quibus verae piscium effigies expressae sunt&quot; by Guillaume Rondelet in 1554, and &quot;pristi&quot;&quot; were included in &quot;De piscibus libri V, et De cetis lib. vnus&quot; by Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1613. Outside Europe, sawfish are mentioned in old Persian texts, such as 13th century writings by Zakariya al-Qazwini.

Sawfish have been found among archaeological remains in several parts of the world, including the Persian Gulf region, the Pacific coast of Panama, coastal Brazil and elsewhere.

The cultural significance of sawfish varies significantly. The Aztecs, in what is currently Mexico, often included depictions of sawfish rostra (saws), notably as the striker/sword of the monster Cipactli. Numerous sawfish rostra have been found buried at the Templo Mayor, and two locations in coastal Veracruz had Aztec names referring to sawfish. In the same general region, sawfish teeth have been found in Mayan graves. The sawfish saw is part of the dancing masks of the Huave and Zapotecs in Oaxaca, Mexico. The Kuna people on the Caribbean coast of Panama and Colombia consider sawfish as rescuers of drowning people, and protectors against dangerous sea creatures. Also in Panama, sawfish were recognized as containing powerful spirits that could protect humans against supernatural enemies.

In the Bissagos Islands off West Africa, dancing dressed as sawfish and other sea creatures is part of men&#x27;s coming-of-age ceremonies. In Gambia, the saws indicate courage; the more saws are on display in a house, the more courageous the owner is seen to be. In Senegal, the Lebu people believe the saw can protect their family, house and livestock. In the same general region, they are recognized as ancestral spirits who use the saw as a magic weapon. The Akan people of Ghana see sawfish as an authority symbol. There are proverbs with sawfish in the African language Duala. In some other parts of coastal Africa, sawfish are considered extremely dangerous and supernatural, but their powers can be used by humans, as their saw is seen to retain powers against disease, bad luck and evil. Among most African groups, consumption of sawfish meat is entirely acceptable, but among some (the Fula, Serer and Wolof people) it is taboo. In the Niger Delta region of southern Nigeria, the saws of sawfish (known as &quot;oki&quot; in Ijaw and neighbouring languages) are often used in masquerades.

In Asia, sawfish are a powerful symbol in many cultures. Asian shamans use sawfish rostrums for exorcisms and other ceremonies to repel demons and disease. They are believed to protect houses from ghosts when hung over doorways. Illustrations of sawfish are often found at Buddhist temples in Thailand. In the Sepik region of New Guinea, locals admire sawfish, but also see them as punishers, who will unleash heavy rainstorms on anyone breaking fishing taboos. Among the Warnindhilyagwa, a group of Indigenous Australians, the ancestral sawfish, &quot;Yukwurrirrindangwa&quot; and rays created the land. The ancestral sawfish carved out the river of Groote Eylandt with their saws. Among European sailors, sawfish were often feared as animals that could sink ships by piercing/sawing the hull with their saw (claims now known to be entirely untrue), but there are also stories of them saving people. In one case, it was described how a ship almost sank during a storm in Italy in 1573. The sailors prayed and made it safely ashore, where they discovered a sawfish that had &quot;plugged&quot; a hole in the ship with its saw. A sawfish rostrum said to be from this miraculous event is kept at the sanctuary of Carmine Maggiore in Naples.
Sawfish have been used as symbols in recent history. During World War II, illustrations of sawfish were placed on navy ships, and used as symbols by both American and Nazi German submarines. Sawfish served as the emblem of the German U-96 submarine, known for its portrayal in &quot;Das Boot&quot;, and was later the symbol of the 9th U-boat Flotilla. The German World War II (Battle Badge of Small Combat Units) depicted a sawfish.

In cartoons and humorous popular culture, the sawfish—particularly its rostrum (&quot;nose&quot;)—has been employed as a sort of living tool. Examples of this can be found in &quot;Vicke Viking&quot; and &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; volume &quot;Demons of the Deep&quot;.

A stylized sawfish was chosen by the Central Bank of the West African States to appear on coins and banknotes of the CFA currency. This was due to it being a mythological representation of fecundity and prosperity. The image takes its form from an Akan and Baoule bronze weight, used for exchanges in the trade of gold powder.

===In aquariums===
Sawfish are popular in public aquariums, but require very large tanks. In a review of 10 North American and European public aquariums that kept sawfish, their tanks were all very large and ranged from about . Individuals in public aquariums often function as &quot;ambassadors&quot; for sawfish and their conservation plight. In captivity they are quite robust, appear to grow faster than their wild counterparts (perhaps due to consistent access to food). Some individuals have lived for decades, but breeding them has proven difficult. In 2012, four smalltooth sawfish pups were born at Atlantis Paradise Island in the Bahamas and, in 2023, another three were born at SeaWorld Orlando in Florida; these remain the only times a member of this family has been successfully bred in captivity. Unsuccessful breeding attempts had taken place earlier at the same facility, including a miscarriage in 2003. Nevertheless, it is hoped that this success may be the first step in a captive breeding program for the threatened sawfish. It is speculated that seasonal variations in water temperature, salinity and photoperiod are necessary to encourage breeding. Artificial insemination, as already practiced with a few captive sharks, is also being considered. Tracking studies indicate that if sawfish are released to the wild after spending a period in captivity (for example, if they outgrow their exhibit), they rapidly adopt a movement pattern similar to that of fully wild sawfish.

Among the five sawfish species, only the four &quot;Pristis&quot; species are known to be kept in public aquariums. The most common is the largetooth sawfish, with studbooks including 16 individuals in North America in 2014, 5 individuals in Europe in 2013 and 13 individuals in Australia in 2017; this was followed by the green sawfish, with 13 individuals in North America, and 6 in Europe. Both of these species are also kept at public aquariums in Asia, and the only captive dwarf sawfish are in Japan. In 2014, studbooks included 12 smalltooth sawfish in North America, and the only ones kept elsewhere are at a public aquarium in Colombia.

===Decline and conservation===
Sawfish were once common, with habitat found along the coastline of 90 countries, locally even abundant, but they have declined drastically and are now among the most threatened groups of marine fish.

====Fishing for various uses====
Sawfish and their parts have been used for numerous things. In approximate order of impact, the four most serious threats today are use in shark fin soup, as traditional medicine, rostral teeth for cockfighting spurs and the saw as a novelty item. Despite being rays rather than sharks, sawfish have some of most prized fins for use in shark fin soup, on level with tiger, mako, blue, porbeagle, thresher, hammerhead, blacktip, sandbar and bull shark. As traditional medicine (especially Chinese medicine, but also known from Mexico, Brazil, Kenya, Eritrea, Yemen, Iran, India and Bangladesh) sawfish parts, oil or powder have been claimed to work against respiratory ailments, eye problems, rheumatism, pain, inflammation, scabies, skin ulcers, diarrhea and stomach problems, but there is no evidence supporting any of these uses. The saws are used in ceremonies and as curiosities. Until relatively recently many saws were sold to visiting tourists, or through antique stores or shell shops, but they are now mostly sold online, often illegally. In 2007 it was estimated that the fins and saw from a single sawfish potentially could earn a fisher more than US$5,000 in Kenya and in 2014 a single rostral tooth sold as cockfighting spurs in Peru or Ecuador had a value of up to US$220. Secondary uses are the meat for consumption and the skin for leather. Historically the saws were used as weapons (large saws) and combs (small saws). Oil from the liver was prized for use in boat repairs and street lights, and as recent as the 1920s in Florida it was regarded as the best fish oil for consumption.

Sawfish fishing goes back several thousand years, but until relatively recently it typically involved traditional low-intensity methods such as simple hook-and-line or spearing. In most regions the major population decline in sawfish started in the 1960s–1980s. This coincided with a major growth in demand of fins for shark fin soup, the expansion of the international shark finning fishing fleet, and a proliferation of modern nylon fishing nets. The exception is the dwarf sawfish which was relatively widespread in the Indo-Pacific, but by the early 1900s it had already disappeared from most of its range, only surviving for certain in Australia (there is a single recent possible record from the Arabian region). The saw has been described as sawfish&#x27;s Achilles&#x27; heel, as it easily becomes entangled in fishing nets. Sawfish can also be difficult or dangerous to release from nets, meaning that some fishers will kill them even before bringing them aboard the boat, or cut off the saw to keep it/release the fish. Because it is their main hunting device, the long-term survival of saw-less sawfish is highly questionable. In Australia where sawfish have to be released if caught, the narrow sawfish has the highest mortality rate, but it is still almost 50% for dwarf sawfish caught in gill nets. In an attempt of lowering this, a guide to sawfish release has been published.

====Habitat destruction and vulnerability to predators====
Although fishing is the main cause of the drastic decline in sawfish, another serious problem is habitat destruction. Coastal and estuarine habitats, including mangrove and seagrass meadows, are often degraded by human developments and pollution, and these are important habitats for sawfish, especially their young. In a study of juvenile sawfish in Western Australia&#x27;s Fitzroy River about 60% had bite marks from bull sharks or crocodiles. Changes to river flows, such as by dams or droughts, can increase the risk faced by sawfish young by bringing them into more contact with predators.

Endangered sawfish and other fish in Florida are showing strange behaviors and dying because of environmental toxins. These toxins, produced by microalgae near the sea bottom, affect the neurological systems of fish. 

====21st century status====
The combined range of the five sawfish species encompassed 90 countries, but today they have certainly disappeared entirely from 20 of these and possibly disappeared from several others. Many more have lost at least one of their species, leaving only one or two remaining. Of the five species of sawfish, three are critically endangered and two are endangered according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature&#x27;s Red List of Threatened Species. The sawfish is now presumed extinct in 55 nations (including China, Iraq, Haiti, Japan, Timor-Leste, El Salvador, Taiwan, Djibouti and Brunei), with 18 countries with at least one species of sawfish missing and 28 countries with at least two. The United States and Australia appear to be the last strongholds of the species, where sawfish are better protected. Science Advances identifies Cuba, Tanzania, Colombia, Madagascar, Panama, Brazil, Mexico and Sri Lanka as the nations where urgent action could make a big contribution to saving the species.

=====Australia =====
The only remaining stronghold of the four species in the Indo-Pacific region (narrow, dwarf, largetooth and green sawfish) is in Northern Australia, but they have also experienced a decline there. &quot;Pristis&quot; sawfish are protected in Australia and only Indigenous Australians can legally catch them. Violations can result in a fine of up to AU$121,900. The narrow sawfish does not receive the same level of protection as the &quot;Pristis&quot; sawfish. Under CITES regulations, Australia was the only country that could export wild-caught sawfish for the aquarium trade from 2007 to 2013 (no country afterwards). This strictly involved the largetooth sawfish where the Australian population remains relatively robust, and only living individuals &quot;to appropriate and acceptable aquaria for primarily conservation purposes&quot;. Numbers traded were very low (eight between 2007 and 2011), and following a review Australia did not export any after 2011.

Largetooth sawfish have been monitored in Fitzroy River, Western Australia, a primary stronghold for the species, since 2000. In December 2018, the largest recorded mass fish death in the river occurred when more than 40 sawfish died, mainly because of heat and a severe lack of rainfall during a poor wet season. A 14-day research expedition in Far North Queensland in October 2019 did not spot a single sawfish. Expert Dr Peter Kyne of Charles Darwin University said that habitat change in the south and gillnet fishing in the north had contributed to the decline in numbers, but now that fishers had started working with the conservationists, dams and water diversions to the river flows had become a bigger problem in the north. Also, impact of successful saltwater crocodile conservation is a negative one on sawfish populations. However, there were still good populations in the Adelaide River and Daly River in the Northern Territory, and the Fitzroy River in the Kimberley.

A study by Murdoch University researchers and Indigenous rangers, which captured more than 500 sawfish between 2002 and 2018, concluded that the survival of the sawfish could be at risk from dams or major water diversions on the Fitzroy River. It found that the fish are completely reliant on the Kimberley&#x27;s wet season floods to complete their breeding cycle; in recent drier years, the population has suffered. There has been debate about using water from the river for agriculture and to grow fodder crops for cattle in the region.

Sharks and Rays Australia (SARA) are conducting a citizen science investigation to understand the sawfish&#x27;s historical habitats. Citizen can report their sawfish sighting online.

=====Rest of the world =====
Except for Australia, sawfish have been extirpated or only survive in very low numbers in the Indo-Pacific region. For example, among the four species only two (narrow and largetooth sawfish) certainly survive in South Asia, and only two (narrow and green sawfish) certainly survive in Southeast Asia.

The status of the two species of the Atlantic region, the smalltooth and largetooth sawfish, is comparable to the Indo-Pacific. For example, sawfish have been entirely extirpated from most of the Atlantic coast of Africa (only survives for certain in Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone), as well as South Africa. The only relatively large remaining population of the largetooth sawfish in the Atlantic region is at the Amazon estuary in Brazil, but there are smaller in Central America and West Africa, and this species is also found in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The smalltooth sawfish is only found in the Atlantic region and it is possibly the most threatened of all the species, as it had the smallest original range (range ) and has experienced the greatest contraction (disappeared from c. 81% of its original range). It only survives for certain in six countries, and it is possible that the only remaining viable population is in the United States. In the United States the smalltooth sawfish once occurred from Texas to New York, but its numbers have declined by at least 95% and today it is essentially restricted to Florida. However, the Florida population retains a high genetic diversity, has now stabilised and appears to be slowly increasing. A Recovery Plan for the smalltooth sawfish has been in effect since 2002. It has been strictly protected in the United States since 2003 when it was added to the Endangered Species Act as the first marine fish. This makes it &quot;illegal to harm, harass, hook, or net sawfish in any way, except with a permit or in a permitted fishery&quot;. The fine is up to US$10,000 for the first violation alone. If accidentally caught, the sawfish has to be released as carefully as possible and a basic how-to guide has been published. In 2003 an attempt of adding the largetooth sawfish to the Endangered Species Act was denied, in part because this species does not occur in the United States anymore (last confirmed US record in 1961). However, it was added in 2011, and all the remaining sawfish species were added in 2014, restricting trade in them and their parts in the United States. In 2020, a Florida fisherman used a power saw to remove a smalltooth sawfish&#x27;s rostrum and then released the maimed fish; he received a fine, community service and probation.

Since 2007, all sawfish species have been listed on CITES Appendix I, which prohibits international trade in them and their parts. The only exception was the relatively robust Australian population of the largetooth sawfish that was listed on CITES Appendix II, which allowed trade to public aquariums only. Following reviews Australia did not use this option after 2011 and in 2013 it too was moved to Appendix I. In addition to Australia and the United States, sawfish are protected in the European Union, Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Guinea, Senegal and South Africa, but they are likely already functionally extirpated or entirely extirpated from several of these countries. Illegal fishing continues and in many countries enforcement of fishing laws is lacking. Even in Australia where relatively well-protected, people are occasionally caught illegally trying to sell sawfish parts, especially the saw. The saw is distinctive, but it can be difficult to identify flesh or fins as originating from sawfish when cut up for sale at fish markets. This can be resolved with DNA testing. If protected their relatively low reproduction rates make these animals especially slow to recover from overfishing. An example of this is the largetooth sawfish in Lake Nicaragua where once abundant. The population rapidly crashed during the 1970s when tens of thousands were caught. It was protected by the Nicaraguan government in the early 1980s, but remains rare today. Nevertheless, there are indications that at least the smalltooth sawfish population may be able to recover at a faster pace than formerly believed, if well-protected. Uniquely in this family, the narrow sawfish has a relatively fast reproduction rate (generation length about 4.6 years, less than one-third the time of the other species), it has experienced the smallest contraction of its range (30%) and it is one of only two species considered Endangered rather than Critically Endangered by the IUCN. The other rated as Endangered is the dwarf sawfish, but this primarily reflects that its main decline happened at least 100 years ago and IUCN ratings are based on the time period of the last three generations (estimated about 49 years in dwarf sawfish).

There are several research projects aimed at sawfish in Australia and North America, but also a few in other continents. The Florida Museum of Natural History maintains the International Sawfish Encounter Database where people worldwide are encouraged to report any sawfish encounters, whether it was living or a rostrum seen for sale in a shop/online. Its data is used by biologists and conservationists for evaluating the habitat, range and abundance of sawfish around the world. In an attempt of increasing the knowledge of their plight the first &quot;Sawfish Day&quot; was held on 17 October 2017, and this was repeated on the same date in 2018.

<text>Gaius Licinius Stolo, along with Lucius Sextius, was one of the two tribunes of ancient Rome who opened the consulship to the plebeians.

A member of the plebeian &quot;Licinia gens&quot;, Stolo was tribune from 376 BC to 367 BC, during which he passed the &quot;lex Licinia Sextia&quot; restoring the consulship, requiring a plebeian consul seat, limiting the amount of public land that one person could hold, and regulating debts. He also passed a law stipulating that the &quot;Sibylline Books&quot; should be overseen by &quot;decemviri&quot;, of whom half would be plebeians in order to prevent any falsification in favor of the patricians. The patricians opposed these laws, though they finally were passed. Licinius was then elected consul for 361 BC ().

He was later charged with violating his own laws concerning the ownership of land and was forced to pay a heavy fine.

Although Livy describes the activities of Gaius Licinius in great detail, it is likely that his description is not accurate; much of it is suspiciously similar to events in the age of the Gracchi two hundred years later, and it is quite possible that the annalist Licinius Macer invented episodes of his family&#x27;s activities.

He was married to the youngest daughter of Marcus Fabius Ambustus. An anecdote frequently told said that Stolo&#x27;s wife urged him to procure the consulship for plebeians through the &quot;Lex Licinia Sextia&quot;, as she was jealous of the honors of Servius Sulpicius Praetextatus, the patrician husband of her sister. As early as the turn of the 19th century, the German historian Barthold Georg Niebuhr pointed out the historical untrustworthiness and contradictions in this tale.

<text>Levi Addison Ault (November 1851 – February 1930) was a Canadian-born American businessman and bureaucrat whose career was closely associated with the city of Cincinnati, Ohio, where he earned the nickname &quot;Father of Cincinnati&#x27;s parks&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Mille Roches, Province of Canada to a successful fabric manufacturer, Ault moved to Wisconsin in his teens, where he worked as a bookkeeper. In 1876, he moved to Cincinnati and took a job as a lampblack salesman.

Two years later, Ault and his business partner Frank Wiborg incorporated Ault &amp; Wiborg, an ink manufacturer that became the world&#x27;s top producer and supplier of inks and lithograph supplies. In 1928, Ault sold his share in the company for $14 million 
($ today)

In the mid-1920s, Ault was offered an ambassadorship by U.S. President Warren G. Harding, but he declined.

Ault was also an avid naturalist, whose passion for parks led him to join Cincinnati&#x27;s parks board. He served as chair of the board from 1908 to 1926, and donated 204 acres (825,000 m2) of land to the city to create Ault Park. Twenty acres (21,000 m2) not donated by Ault himself were later added to this park as well.

He also donated a family property on Sheek&#x27;s Island to the Township of Cornwall, which also became known as Ault Park.

In 1958, 28 years after Ault&#x27;s death, Sheek&#x27;s Island and Ault&#x27;s birthplace in Mille Roches were submerged by construction on the St. Lawrence Seaway project. With the help of Ault&#x27;s surviving family, Ault Park was rebuilt on the new river shoreline near Long Sault, and is home to a historical museum commemorating The Lost Villages.

<doc id="1051386" wikidata="Q8016678" url="?curid=1051386" title="William Paul Quinn">
<text>William Paul Quinn (10 April 1788 – 21 February 1873) was born in India and immigrated to the United States, where he became the fourth bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first independent black denomination in the United States when founded in 1816 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 

In 1836 Quinn was assigned as a missionary to what was known as the Northwest, specifically Indiana and Ohio, although he also traveled to Illinois and Missouri. He settled in Richmond, Indiana as his base, founding an AME Church there and several throughout these states. In 1844 he was elected as bishop and in 1849 as Senior Bishop of the church.

==Early life and education==
By his own account, Quinn was said to have been born in Calcutta, India to an Indian family. An 1851 affidavit said his mother was Egyptian and his father was Spanish, who were involved in the mahogany trade. He was introduced to Christianity by a Quaker missionary in India and went to England, where he took an English name. He immigrated to the United States as a young man by 1808 and became active with an AME Church in New Jersey. He was part of its founding as a denomination in 1816.

==Religious career==
Quinn came to the US by 1808, when he became involved in the AME Church in New Jersey. He was among the founders of the denomination in 1816, the first black independent denomination in the United States. According to that account, he was ordained a deacon in 1818. His wife was Mary Jane Quinn. 

In 1836 Quinn was assigned as a missionary to the Northwest Territory, and traveled throughout Indiana and Ohio to plant congregations. He is also credited with helping found the Brooklyn AME Church in Brooklyn, Illinois. Now called the Quinn&#x27;s Chapel AME Church, it is thought to be the earliest AME Church west of the Appalachian Mountains. Brooklyn was an early black village founded on the Mississippi River across from St. Louis, Missouri. 

Quinn settled with his wife in Richmond, Indiana, which he used as a base for his missionary work. Quinn became an elder in 1838. They founded the Bethel A.M.E. Church in Richmond, as well as similar churches in Dublin, Newport (now Fountain City), and Cambridge City, Indiana, and most of the AME churches in Ohio and Indiana.

On May 19, 1844, due to his success in planting churches in the Northwest, the General Conference of the church elected him a bishop. He became the Senior Bishop of the church in May 1849, serving until his death in Richmond on February 3, 1873. During that period, another 47 AME congregations were established from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to California.

Quinn was known for saying that the Divine Command theory should be accepted without question, because God could be seen as always doing the right thing; even if he does not &quot;appear&quot; to be doing the right thing, the end outcome will be good.

Quinn was buried at Earlham Cemetery in Richmond.

==Legacy and honors==
Paul Quinn College, the oldest historically black college in Texas, was named after him. It was founded in Austin, Texas in 1872 by AME Church members to educate freedmen and later moved to Waco, Texas. In 1991 Paul Quinn College moved to Dallas, Texas, where it remains today.

<doc id="1051400" wikidata="Q2900179" url="?curid=1051400" title="Better Luck Tomorrow">
<text>Better Luck Tomorrow is a 2002 American independent crime drama film directed by Justin Lin. The film is about Asian American overachievers who become bored with their lives and enter a world of petty crime and material excess. &quot;Better Luck Tomorrow&quot;″s cast include Parry Shen, Jason Tobin, Sung Kang, Roger Fan, and John Cho. The film tells a fictional story of youth violence, drawing inspiration from several sources, including the Columbine shootings and the murder of Stuart Tay, a teenager from Orange County, California.

Crucial funding for the film came from MC Hammer, whom Lin had met in April 2001 at the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas, Nevada. &quot;Out of desperation, I called up MC Hammer because he had read the script and liked it. Two hours later, he wired the money we needed into a bank account and saved us,&quot; Lin said. MC Hammer is credited as a producer of the film. 

&quot;Better Luck Tomorrow&quot; debuted at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival, and was subsequently acquired by MTV Films, its first acquisition. MTV Films worked with Paramount Pictures to release the film theatrically in the United States on April 11, 2003.

== Plot ==
Ben Manibag is a stereotypical overachieving Asian American teenager in a wealthy Orange County suburb whose goals are to make his high school basketball team, get with his cheerleader crush Stephanie and to get into a prestigious Ivy League university. His perfectionism masks another side of his life, which is toilet-papering houses with his best friend Virgil and engaging in petty crime with Virgil&#x27;s cousin, Han Lue.

Though Ben makes the basketball team, he ends up being mostly a benchwarmer. Through Daric Loo, senior valedictorian and president of nearly every student club, Ben gets involved in a school-wide cheat sheet operation. Daric pays Jesus, another student, to steal the tests from the school office, and Ben uses the tests to make cheat sheets which are then sold off to students. Ben brings Virgil and Han into the racket, and the four of them make a small fortune. Meanwhile, Ben finds himself competing with Steve Choe, a private school student and Stephanie&#x27;s boyfriend, for Stephanie&#x27;s affections. Steve discovers Ben&#x27;s crush and offers to let him take Stephanie to the Winter Formal.

The group&#x27;s activities gradually escalate into more dangerous crimes, such as the theft of computer parts from the school and selling drugs. They become users themselves, with Ben developing a heavy cocaine habit. Feeling increasingly conflicted by the expectations others have of him, and horrified at waking up with a nosebleed due to his cocaine use, Ben decides to quit the group. He resumes his academic pursuits and begins spending more time with Stephanie. He eventually asks her to the formal; she accepts.

After the Winter Formal dance, Ben is lured back to his life of crime when Steve meets with Ben and tells him he has information on a possible score. The group is stunned when Steve reveals he wants them to rob his parents&#x27; house. Though Ben and Han are initially against it, Daric convinces the group this would be the perfect opportunity to teach the haughty Steve a lesson.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve, the four meet Steve at Jesus&#x27;s house under the pretense of robbing Steve&#x27;s parents, but Daric, Virgil and Han begin attacking Steve while Ben keeps watch outside. In the ensuing struggle Steve gets Virgil&#x27;s gun which goes off. Ben runs in and, seeing the gun in Steve&#x27;s hand, beats Steve with a baseball bat. The group convinces Jesus to bury the body in his backyard for $300. Steve begins to twitch, revealing he&#x27;s still alive, but Daric suffocates Steve with a gasoline-soaked rag while a tearful Virgil holds his arms back. Afterwards, the four go to a New Year&#x27;s Eve party, where Ben and Stephanie kiss at midnight.

The next day, while cleaning up the aftermath of the murder, Ben and Virgil hear Steve&#x27;s phone ringing under the ground in Jesus&#x27;s backyard. They dig it up and learn it was a call from Stephanie. Ben debates on whether to report Steve&#x27;s murder to the police. The guilt over Steve&#x27;s murder is too much for Virgil, who attempts suicide, but fails and suffers potential brain damage. Daric expresses concern about Han or Virgil reporting the murder, but Ben simply resolves to do nothing and walks away.

At the end of the film, Ben is shown alone. He encounters Stephanie one day on the way home. She asks him whether he has seen Steve lately, and expresses some concern that he has not called. They kiss, implying the resumption of their relationship. Ben&#x27;s voice-over tells the audience that he has no idea about what the future holds, but all he knows is that there is no turning back.

== Production ==
Justin Lin said that the title &quot;Better Luck Tomorrow&quot; refers to how the film explores &quot;the whole youth culture of today, specifically Asian-American, but also just the general mentality of teenagers today. I mean, I work with teenagers, I grew up in the 80s, and already it&#x27;s very different, the mentality. You go to suburbia, you look at upper-middle-class-kids, and through the media they&#x27;ve literally adopted an urban-gangsta-mentality.&quot;

While writing the script, he found inspiration in his work as a youth basketball coach and teaching high school students how to make community documentaries.

Originally the film was going to be shot in digital-video, but within two weeks, after Fujifilm and later Kodak proposed deals with the director, the filming switched to 35 mm.

Sung Kang had originally wanted to play Ben Manibag.

Lin&#x27;s original investors wanted a white cast with Macaulay Culkin as the male lead if he wanted a million dollar investment for his movie. Lin objected and continued to fund the project with his 10 credit cards and life savings. He said knowing the film &quot;potentially could&#x27;ve been the last film I ever made&quot; he wanted to make it &quot;about issues that were very important to me.&quot;

After those funds were depleted, finishing funds equivalent to one third of the film&#x27;s budget were provided by Cherry Sky Films for post-production, preparing the film to submit to Sundance, after producer Joan Huang reconnected with Lin at the LA Asian Pacific American Film Festival. Lin also brought in an additional $10,000 from artist MC Hammer, whom he had met while working at the Japanese American National Museum.

== Connection to the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; franchise ==
Director Justin Lin later directed multiple films in the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; franchise, with Kang reprising his role as Han Lue. &quot;Better Luck Tomorrow&quot; was subsequently recognized as Han&#x27;s origin story.

==Reception==
=== Critical reception ===
The film has an approval rating of 81% at the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 106 reviews with an average rating of 7.03/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A promising work by Lin, the energetic &quot;Better Luck Tomorrow&quot; is disturbing and thought-provoking.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 32 critics.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote &quot;Lin is a talent to watch. There&#x27;s a sting to this film that gets to you.&quot; Roger Ebert in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a full four-star-rating and wrote that it was a &quot;disturbing and skillfully-told parable about growing up in today&#x27;s America&quot; and that Lin &quot;reveals himself as a skilled and sure director&quot;. Ebert defended the filmmakers during a screening after an audience member accused them of misrepresenting their culture and race. Ebert declared &quot;What I find very condescending and offensive about your statement, is nobody would say to a bunch of white filmmakers, &#x27;how could you do this to your people?&#x27;&quot;. In 2018, Jane Yong Kim of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote the film &quot;[complicates] the question of Asian American representation in Hollywood in ways that still resonate deeply today&quot;.

=== Release ===
&quot;Better Luck Tomorrow&quot; opened on 13 screens on April 11, 2003, earning the highest per-screen average of any in film release at the time.

Much of the film&#x27;s success was attributed to grassroots campaigning by young Asian-American viewers, particularly college students, who promoted the film on school campuses and online.

=== Awards and film festivals ===
* Official Selection and Grand Jury Prize Nomination – Sundance Film Festival, 2002. In a question and answer session following a festival screening, in response to an audience member who asked director Lin if he thought it was irresponsible to portray Asian-Americans in such a negative light, Roger Ebert stood up and said, angrily, &quot;What I find very offensive and condescending about your statement is nobody would say to a bunch of white filmmakers, &#x27;How could you do this to your people?&#x27;&quot;. And then he continued: &quot;This film has the right to be about these people, and Asian-Americans have the right to be whatever the hell they want to be. They do not have to &#x27;represent&#x27; their people.&quot; Ebert&#x27;s approval of the film drew the attention of major studios, leading eventually to MTV&#x27;s buying the film for distribution.
* Official Selection – Toronto International Film Festival, 2002. Lin said reception at the Toronto festival was notably different than Sundance with the audience more interested in discussing the state of youth rather than the race of the ethnicity of the actors. &quot;In America, most of the time, I can&#x27;t even get into talking about the issues, because they&#x27;re just stuck on race,&quot; he said.
* Independent Spirit Awards – John Cassavetes Award Nomination, 2004

<doc id="1051404" wikidata="Q61738980" url="?curid=1051404" title="Monounsaturated fat">
<text>In biochemistry and nutrition, a monounsaturated fat is a fat that contains a monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), a subclass of fatty acid characterized by having a double bond in the fatty acid chain with all of the remaining carbon atoms being single-bonded. By contrast, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have more than one double bond.

==Molecular description==
Monounsaturated fats are triglycerides containing one unsaturated fatty acid. Almost invariably that fatty acid is oleic acid (18:1 n−9). Palmitoleic acid (16:1 n−7) and cis-vaccenic acid (18:1 n−7) occur in small amounts in fats.

==Health==
Studies have shown that substituting dietary monounsaturated fat for saturated fat is associated with increased daily physical activity and resting energy expenditure. More physical activity was associated with a higher-oleic acid diet than one of a palmitic acid diet. From the study, it is shown that more monounsaturated fats lead to less anger and irritability.

Foods containing monounsaturated fats may affect low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.

Levels of oleic acid along with other monounsaturated fatty acids in red blood cell membranes were positively associated with breast cancer risk. The saturation index (SI) of the same membranes was inversely associated with breast cancer risk. Monounsaturated fats and low SI in erythrocyte membranes are predictors of postmenopausal breast cancer. Both of these variables depend on the activity of the enzyme delta-9 desaturase (Δ9-d).

In children, consumption of monounsaturated oils is associated with healthier serum lipid profiles.

The Mediterranean diet is one heavily influenced by monounsaturated fats. In the late 20th century, people in Mediterranean countries consumed more total fat than Northern European countries, but most of the fat was in the form of monounsaturated fatty acids from olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids from fish, vegetables, and certain meats like lamb, while consumption of saturated fat was minimal in comparison.
A 2017 review found evidence that the practice of a Mediterranean diet could lead to a decreased risk of cardiovascular diseases, overall cancer incidence, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and early death. A 2018 review showed that the practice of the Mediterranean diet may improve overall health status, such as the reduced risk of non-communicable diseases. It also may reduce the social and economic costs of diet-related illnesses.

===Diabetes===
Increasing monounsaturated fat and decreasing saturated fat intake could improve insulin sensitivity, but only when the overall fat intake of the diet was low. However, some monounsaturated fatty acids (in the same way as saturated fats) may promote insulin resistance, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids may be protective against insulin resistance.

== Sources ==

Monounsaturated fats are found in animal flesh such as red meat, whole milk products, nuts, and high fat fruits such as olives and avocados. Algal oil is about 92% monounsaturated fat. Olive oil is about 75% monounsaturated fat. The high oleic variety sunflower oil contains at least 70% monounsaturated fat. Canola oil and cashews are both about 58% monounsaturated fat. Tallow (beef fat) is about 50% monounsaturated fat. and lard is about 40% monounsaturated fat. Other sources include hazelnut, avocado oil, macadamia nut oil, grapeseed oil, groundnut oil (peanut oil), sesame oil, corn oil, popcorn, whole grain wheat, cereal, oatmeal, almond oil, sunflower oil, hemp oil, and tea-oil Camellia.

<doc id="1051405" wikidata="Q2604425" url="?curid=1051405" title="Shirō Hamaguchi">
<text>is a Japanese anime composer, arranger and orchestrator. He is best known for composing music to the anime franchises &quot;Girls und Panzer&quot;, &quot;One Piece&quot;, and &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; and arranging/orchestrating music in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. He frequently collaborates with fellow composers Kohei Tanaka and Akifumi Tada on anime scores.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Born in Fukuoka, Japan, Shiro Hamaguchi graduated with a music degree from Tokyo University of the Arts, where he befriended fellow video game musician Masashi Hamauzu. After graduation, he was hired as a department project manager at Victor Entertainment from 1994 to 1996. In 1996, he joined the anime and video game music production company Imagine, where he worked alongside famed composers Hayato Matsuo, Kohei Tanaka, and Kow Otani. His debut role was the anime series &quot;Violinist of Hameln&quot; (1996), where he arranged Tanaka&#x27;s works. His music impressed &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; composer Nobuo Uematsu, who chose Hamaguchi as the arranger for the &quot;Final Fantasy VII Reunion Tracks&quot; album. He provided orchestral renditions of &quot;Aeris&#x27;s Theme&quot;, &quot;Main Theme of Final Fantasy VII&quot;, and &quot;One-Winged Angel&quot;, which have become iconic through their use in various &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; concerts. Subsequently, he created music for the anime series &quot;Ehrgeiz&quot; (unrelated to the video game) and &quot;AWOL - Absent WithOut Leave&quot;.

===Further career===
Hamaguchi scored the pirate-based anime &quot;One Piece&quot; in 1999 with Tanaka, later returning to compose four of its movies. He also worked as an arranger for the &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; series. The success of his &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; arrangements led Uematsu to hire him to orchestrate four pieces for the 1999 title &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, including the opening theme &quot;Liberi Fatali&quot; and the theme song &quot;Eyes on Me&quot;. These pieces and nine new arrangements appeared in the orchestral album &quot;Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec Final Fantasy VIII&quot;. The following year, he arranged a selection of tracks from the game&#x27;s soundtrack for the series&#x27; first Piano Collections album in five years. The success of &quot;Eyes on Me&quot; prompted Kenji Ito to use Hamaguchi as the arranger for his theme song in &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot;.

In 2000, Hamaguchi composed the &quot;Megumi no Daigo&quot; film and the &quot;Dinozaurs&quot; anime series, the latter with Imagine colleague Akifumi Tada. He provided orchestrations to &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;″s full motion video music, featured in &quot;Final Fantasy IX Original Soundtrack PLUS&quot;, and an arrangement of the theme song &quot;Melodies of Life&quot;; he also created another Piano Collections album to the game. Hamaguchi collaborated with Uematsu to create music for the animated film &quot;Ah! My Goddess: The Movie&quot; and the 2001 anime series &quot;Final Fantasy: Unlimited&quot;, which also featured compositions by Tada.

For &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, he orchestrated the ending theme and the two versions of the theme song &quot;Suteki da ne&quot;. He also produced the arrangements for the 2002 concert 20020220 Music from Final Fantasy, the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; concert since 1989. It mixed his older arrangements with new ones such as &quot;Vamo&#x27; Alla Flamenco&quot;, &quot;Theme of Love&quot;, &quot;Tina&quot;, &quot;Dear Friends&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, and an eight-minute medley of music from &quot;Final Fantasy I&quot;, &quot;II&quot;, and &quot;III&quot;. The concert and its CD release set a precedent for many future concerts. Also in 2002, Hamaguchi scored the anime series &quot;Kiddy Grade&quot;. His contribution to &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; (2003) was arranging the opening theme. He also orchestrated three themes for &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; on behalf of his university friend Hamauzu.

At the end of 2003, Hamaguchi produced the &quot;Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII&quot;. He also made new arrangements of &quot;Opening ~ Bombing Mission&quot;, &quot;To Zanarkand&quot;, &quot;Ronfaure&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Not Alone&quot;, and &quot;Opera &#x27;Maria and Draco&#x27;&quot; for the concert series Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy in 2004. The concert also featured his arrangement of &quot;Cloud Smiles&quot; from the 2005 film &quot;Final Fantasy VII Advent Children&quot;; the remaining contributions to the film by Hamaguchi were old orchestral and piano arrangements. A handful of Hamaguchi&#x27;s orchestral arrangements were added to Tour de Japon&#x27;s American successor Dear Friends - Music from Final Fantasy, which made its debut in May 2004 in Los Angeles. His arrangements have also been performed at the events More Friends: Music from Final Fantasy, Voices - Music from Final Fantasy, and Play! A Video Game Symphony.

In 2005, Hamaguchi scored the anime series &quot;Oh! My Goddess&quot; and contributed arrangements to the third Symphonic Game Music Concert. The same year, Hamaguchi decided to enroll at the Berklee College of Music in a one-year jazz composition course to further his opportunities as an anime composer. He has since scored &quot;One Piece Movie: The Desert Princess and the Pirates: Adventures in Alabasta&quot;, &quot;Big Windup!&quot;, &quot;Ah! My Goddess: Fighting Wings&quot;, and &quot;Rosario + Vampire&quot;. He orchestrated the late composer Ingo Nugel and his brother Henning Nugel&#x27;s arrangements from &quot;The Settlers II (10th Anniversary)&quot; for performance at the fifth Symphonic Game Music Concert in August 2007. In September 2010, he arranged a suite containing the music from Starwing and Lylat Wars for the Symphonic Legends concert in Cologne.

Hamaguchi also composed the official music score for the Sanrio anime &quot;Jewelpet&quot; and its sequels, &quot;Jewelpet Twinkle&quot; and &quot;Jewelpet Sunshine&quot;. He later left the production staff in 2012 to focus on composing music for the film &quot;One Piece Film: Z&quot; and the anime film &quot;Hanasaku Iroha: The Movie – Home Sweet Home&quot;.

<text>North Epping is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 19 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Hornsby Shire. North Epping is in the Northern Sydney region, and is often referred to as part of the &quot;North-West&quot; or North Shore. Epping is a separate suburb to the south and under the Parramatta City Council, which shares the postcode of 2121.

North Epping is a leafy suburb, surrounded by bushland of the upper section of Lane Cove National Park. 

North Epping is an exclave of Hornsby Shire Council, geographically cut off from the bush land shire by the Lane Cove National Park. 
North Epping relies on nearby Epping for much of its infrastructure, including transport, libraries, and public swimming pools.

There are many walking trails, including the Great North Walk which also links residing suburbs such as South Turramurra, Marsfield and West Pymble. One of the well known landmarks is Whale Rock.

==History==

===Aboriginal culture===
The Wallumedegal Aboriginal tribe lived in the area between the Lane Cove River and Parramatta River, which was known as Walumetta.

===European settlement===
In 1792 Governor Arthur Phillip began the granting of parcels of lands to marines, and the area was referred to on Phillip&#x27;s maps as the Field of Mars, named after the Roman Field of Mars probably because of the military link. It contained the area of what is now Epping and North Epping. The name Epping is derived from Epping Forest in Essex, England.
The land was broken up into farms and orchards, and after World War II it started to convert to residential use. Areas which had previously been reserved as part of the green belt scheme became available for residential development in 1948. North Epping post office was established in 1954 and the public school in 1960.

===Becoming a separate suburb===
North Epping was split off from Epping as a separate suburb on 1 December 1995.

<doc id="1051426" wikidata="Q2051565" url="?curid=1051426" title="Arachnodactyly">
<text>Arachnodactyly (&quot;spider fingers&quot;) is a medical condition that is characterized by fingers and toes that are abnormally long and slender, in comparison to the palm of the hand and arch of the foot. In some cases, the thumbs of an individual with the condition are pulled inwards towards the palm. This condition is present at birth.

==Causes==
This feature can occur on its own with no underlying health problems, or it can be associated with certain medical conditions, including Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndromes, Loeys–Dietz syndrome, and homocystinuria. It is also seen in congenital contractural arachnodactyly, which is caused by mutation in the gene encoding fibrillin-2 on chromosome 5q23.

==Notable cases==
It remains unconfirmed whether composer Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s abnormally large reach on a piano was a result of arachnodactyly due to Marfan syndrome, as the pianist exhibited no other signs of the disease.

<doc id="1051432" wikidata="Q2937820" url="?curid=1051432" title="Pith and substance">
<text>Pith and substance is a legal doctrine in Canadian constitutional interpretation used to determine under which head of power a given piece of legislation falls. The doctrine is primarily used when a law is challenged on the basis that one level of government (be it provincial or federal) has encroached upon the exclusive jurisdiction of another level of government. 

The &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, which established a federal constitution for Canada, enumerated in Sections 91 and 92 the topics on which the Dominion and the Provinces could respectively legislate. Notwithstanding that the lists were framed so as to be fairly full and comprehensive, soon it was found that the topics enumerated in the two sections overlapped, and the Privy Council repeatedly had to rule on the constitutionality of laws made by the federal and provincial legislatures. It was in this situation that the Privy Council evolved the doctrine that, for deciding whether an impugned legislation was &quot;intra vires&quot; (within its powers), regard must be had to its pith and substance.

Thus, if a statute is found in substance to relate to a topic within the competence of the legislature, it should be held to be &quot;intra vires&quot; even though it might incidentally trench on topics not within its legislative competence. The extent of the encroachment on matters beyond its competence may be an element in determining whether the legislation is colourable: whether in the guise of making a law on a matter within its competence, the legislature is, in truth, making a law on a subject beyond its competence. However, where that is not the position, the fact of encroachment does not affect the vires of the law even as regards the area of encroachment.

==Nature of pith and substance analysis==

The analysis must answer two questions:

#what is the pith and substance or essential character of the law?
#does it relate to an enumerated head of power in section 91 or 92 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;?

===Essential character===

The first task in the pith and substance analysis is to determine the pith and substance or essential character of the law:

:* What is the true meaning or dominant feature of the impugned legislation? This is resolved by looking at the purpose and the legal effect of the regulation or law. The purpose refers to what the legislature wanted to accomplish.
:* Purpose is relevant to determine whether, in this case, Parliament was legislating within its jurisdiction, or venturing into an area under provincial jurisdiction.
:* The legal effect refers to how the law will affect rights and liabilities, and is also helpful in illuminating the core meaning of the law: see &quot;Reference re Firearms Act&quot;. The effects can also reveal whether a law is colourable (does the law in form appear to address something within the legislature&#x27;s jurisdiction, but in substance deal with a matter outside that jurisdiction?). For example, in &quot;R. v. Morgentaler (1993)&quot;, the province of Nova Scotia passed a law that prohibited certain surgical procedures from being performed outside of hospitals under the guise of health services protection. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that in substance, the province was attempting to ban abortions.

The pith and substance analysis is not technical or formalistic it is essentially a matter of interpretation. The court looks at the words used in the impugned legislation as well as the background and circumstances surrounding its enactment. In conducting this analysis, the court should not be concerned with the efficacy of the law or whether it achieves the legislature’s goals.

===Assignment===

There are two significant principles to be used in determining whether a matter falls within a particular federal or provincial jurisdiction:

:* The Constitution must be interpreted flexibly over time to meet new social, political and historic realities
:* The principle of federalism must be respected, keeping in mind:
::* Power is shared by two orders of government, each autonomous in developing policies and laws within their own jurisdiction
::* Classes of subjects should be construed in relation to one another
::* In cases where federal and provincial classes of subjects contemplate overlapping concepts, meaning may be given to both through the process of “mutual modification”
::* Classes of subjects should not be construed so broadly as to expand jurisdiction indefinitely

Once the law has been characterized it must be assigned to one of the two heads of power. The matters in the exclusive domain of the federal government are enumerated under section 91 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; and matters in the exclusive domain of the provincial government are enumerated under section 92. Whether the characterization of a law fits within one of the enumerated matters depends on the breadth given by the court to each matter.

A law found to be valid under the pith and substance analysis of the law may also have some &quot;incidental&quot; effects upon matters outside of the government&#x27;s jurisdiction. This is tolerated, as a law is classified by its dominant characteristic. The modern approach to Canadian constitutional interpretation is to allow a fair amount of interplay and overlap into the other level of government&#x27;s jurisdiction.

==Ancillary effects doctrine==

In many circumstances, however, a law that is found to be invalid under the pith and substance analysis may still be saved by using the doctrine of necessarily incidental or ancillary effects. In such cases, the intruding provisions of the law will only be upheld if they satisfy the &quot;rational connection&quot; test.

The doctrine was first articulated in &quot;Cushing v. Dupuy&quot;, where the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that certain rules of civil court procedure could be prescribed under the federal bankruptcy power. It was subsequently confirmed in &quot;Tennant v. The Union Bank of Canada&quot;, where rules governing warehouse receipts with respect to bank loans could be prescribed under the federal banking power.

The full test was articulated in &quot;General Motors v. City National Leasing&quot; by Dickson CJ, where he summarized and outlined the analysis to be used in that regard in future cases:

:* The court must determine whether the impugned provision can be viewed as intruding on provincial powers, and if so to what extent.
:* It must establish whether the act (or a severable part of it) in which the impugned provision is found is valid.
::* In cases under the second branch of s. 91(2) this will normally involve finding the presence of a regulatory scheme and then ascertaining whether the hallmarks articulated by the Court have been met by the scheme. If the scheme is not valid, that is the end of the inquiry.
:* If the regulatory scheme is declared valid, the court must then determine whether the impugned provision is sufficiently integrated with the scheme that it can be upheld by virtue of that relationship. This requires considering the seriousness of the encroachment on provincial powers, in order to decide on the proper standard for such a relationship. If the provision passes this integration test, it is &quot;intra vires&quot; Parliament as an exercise of the general trade and commerce power. If the provision is not sufficiently integrated into the scheme of regulation, it cannot be sustained under the second branch of s. 91(2). 

In certain cases, it may be possible to dispense with some of the aforementioned steps if a clear answer to one of them will deal with the issue. For example, if the provision in question has no relation to the regulatory scheme, the question of its validity may be quickly answered on that ground alone.

==Use outside of Canada==

The pith and substance doctrine as applied in the jurisprudence of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, effectively the British imperial court of appeal, has been carried to other Commonwealth federations. It is used in the Indian constitution. It was also used in Northern Ireland under the &quot;Government of Ireland Act 1920&quot;. The substance of the doctrine has been cast in statutory form in the &quot;Scotland Act 1998&quot; for the purpose of devolution to Scotland. It was also used in Australia until 1964, when the High Court case of &quot;Fairfax v Commissioner of Taxation&quot; overruled its use by an alternate method.

===In India===
It is used in the Indian constitution. The doctrine has been applied in India also to provide a degree of flexibility in the otherwise rigid scheme of distribution of powers. The reason for adoption of this doctrine is that if every legislation were to be declared invalid on the grounds that it encroached powers, the powers of the legislature would be drastically circumscribed.

<doc id="1051436" wikidata="Q3898136" url="?curid=1051436" title="Paul Quinn College">
<text>Paul Quinn College (PQC) is a private historically black Methodist college in Dallas, Texas. The college is affiliated with the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME). It is the oldest historically black college west of the Mississippi River and the nation&#x27;s first urban work college.

Paul Quinn is home to the &quot;WE over ME Farm&quot;, which was created through a partnership with PepsiCo to bring healthy food to the food desert of Dallas.

==History==

The college was founded by a small group of African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church preachers in Austin, Texas, on April 4, 1872, as the Connectional School for the Education of Negro Youth. Originally, its classes were held in churches and people&#x27;s homes, but in 1877 the school moved into its own building in Waco, Texas. 

The college was renamed Waco College. Classes were held in a modest one-building trade school; freedmen were taught the skills of blacksmithing, carpentry, tanning, and saddle work, common occupations for the era, especially in the increasingly segregated state. This was the model established by the Tuskegee Institute.

Later, under the direction of Bishop William Paul Quinn (1788–1873), A.M.E. districts were developed throughout the South and tasked with raising funds to improve the college. During this period, more than twenty acres of additional land was purchased and the curriculum was expanded to include the classical subjects of Latin, mathematics, music, theology, English, plus vocational skills in carpentry, sewing, and household, kitchen, and dining room work. In May 1881, the college was chartered by the State of Texas and changed its name to Paul Quinn College to commemorate the contributions of Bishop William Paul Quinn. In 1898 the school had seven faculty, including four women.

===Expansion===
The campus was expanded, with new buildings constructed with capital raised from interested patrons. In 1950, the college began significant physical expansion. A campus church, student union building, gymnasium and administration building were erected between 1950 and 1954. Two new dormitories, a modern two-story classroom building, a fully equipped science department, and a new library were added to the campus.

In spring of 1954, the Waco Chamber of Commerce successfully completed a campaign which raised $100,000 for a new women&#x27;s dormitory to replace one destroyed by a fire. Bishop O.L. Sherman was assigned to supervise the work of the A.M.E. Church in Texas in 1962. His first official act was to have the Charter of the college changed so that trustees could be elected without regard to race, creed, or color. Because of this significant innovation, new leaders from Central Texas were added to the board of trustees.

Dr. Stanley E. Rutland became President of the college in 1969. Under his leadership, the physical plant of the college continued to improve. Among the changes were the addition of a new gymnasium, the renovation of historic Johnson Hall, and the development of the Ethnic Cultural Center. Under Dr. Rutland, the college received accreditation in 1972 with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) for the first time.

===Move to Dallas===
The college relocated to southeast Dallas in 1990. It acquired the former campus of Bishop College from African-American businessman Comer Cottrell. During the first semester in its new home, the college boasted an enrollment of 1,020 students and became the only HBCU in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

In 2006, Board of Trustees member Peggy Sterling and her employer, American Airlines, secured the services of global management-consulting firm the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to analyze the operations and performance of the college. BCG&#x27;s work ultimately provided the Institution with a blueprint that eventually became the college&#x27;s Strategic Plan from 2007 to 2012.

===New direction===
In September 2007, Michael Sorrell, a former member of the Board of Trustees, was selected as president, after having served as the interim president since March of that year.

Since his arrival, the college has raised academic standards and embarked on an ambitious revitalization of the campus, which has included spending over $4 million in capital improvements. It has reduced institutional debt by 40 percent and resolved all previous issues with the audit findings.

Sorrell instituted a &quot;business casual&quot; dress code on campus in order to prepare students for work life after college. His next set of plans for the college call for an increased commitment to recruitment and retention.

In 2009, the college&#x27;s accreditation was challenged by SACS, based on problems with institutional effectiveness and financial stability. Following a lawsuit, a judge issued an injunction which reinstated accreditation prior to hearing of the lawsuit.

Since that time, Sorrell has continued improvements: the college produced over $2 million in budget surpluses in fiscal 2009, 2010, and 2011; achieved unqualified audits for 2009 and 2010; invested more than $4 million in infrastructure improvements without adding any debt; and formed a groundbreaking partnership with PepsiCo to convert an unused football stadium into a fully operational urban farm.

In 2011, the college received membership into the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS) accrediting agency.

Paul Quinn&#x27;s Hispanic student population has grown steadily in recent years, making up at least 12% of the student body.

As of 2016, Paul Quinn is one of only eight work colleges in the nation and the first to be in an urban environment.

In 2016, Paul Quinn implemented the African-American Leadership Institute. President Sorrell stated the institute is Paul Quinn&#x27;s attempt to address economic development, educational, public policy, and leadership development in the North Texas African-American community.

In 2018, Paul Quinn broke ground on the first new campus building in over 40 years. The Trammel S. Crow Living and Learning Center will include a dormitory and gym to hold up to 1,500 people. Construction of the new building is expected to be completed in 2019.

Also in 2018, Paul Quinn opened a work program expansion site in Plano, Texas.

In 2021, it was announced Paul Quinn would house an International Baccalaureate school on its campus for students in grades sixth through 12.

==Campus life==
===The WE over Me Farm at Paul Quinn College===
The WE over Me Farm at Paul Quinn College, formerly called the Food for Good Farm at Paul Quinn College, began as an answer to the food desert conditions in the Southern sector of Dallas. In 2008, college president Michael Sorrell, who had shuttered the school&#x27;s football program shortly after taking office in 2007, talked with a real estate investor about devoting a tract of land to community farming. Although the idea of using the former football field was initially a joke by Sorrell, it soon became reality.

The reconstruction of the football field into a 100-yard farm that produces spinach, herbs, watermelon, potatoes, sweet potatoes, arugula, and other produce has produced partnerships with Yale University and other institutions for the continued study of the impact of urban farming. The dedication of the farm was on May 10, 2010. The farm gives 20 percent of the gross yield to the community. Even before the farm was officially dedicated, it had picked up a major customer in Legends Hospitality, a venue management firm partially owned by the Dallas Cowboys that provides food services for the Cowboys&#x27; AT&amp;T Stadium. Yahoo! Sports reported in 2013 that the farm will produce about 17,500 pounds of food for AT&amp;T Stadium in the 2013 football season.

In April 2011, the farm hosted its first major fundraising event. &quot;A Community Cooks&quot; featured 13 top local chefs cooking various dishes for the community. Will Allen, the keynote speaker, is a MacArthur Fellow and one of the foremost thinkers on urban farming. &quot;A Community Cooks&quot; is an annual event.

===Cafeteria===
Citing health concerns, in August 2012, Paul Quinn banned pork and pork products from being sold at the cafeteria. More turkey, salads and other healthy food options have been included.

===We Are Not Trash===
The college ended 2011 locked in a battle with the city of Dallas over the McCommas Bluff Landfill, which is approximately 1.5 miles east of the campus. The city&#x27;s decision to re-route all of Dallas&#x27; waste to the landfill, effectively transforming it into one of the largest landfills in the southwest, infuriated the student population. This anger was exacerbated by the fact the school is located in the middle of an area the United States Department of Agriculture has labeled a food desert.

In June 2011, the students organized a town hall meeting and invited city officials to explain the efficacy of expanding the landfill. More than 250 residents attended. This was the largest town hall meeting in this city council district in more than 20 years. The town hall meeting eventually turned into &quot;I AM NOT TRASH&quot;, two student-led demonstrations at the Dallas City Hall. Despite the students efforts, the city council voted 8–7 to move forward with the plans to dump all the city&#x27;s waste into the landfill without any prior study as to the effect of such a decision.

In response, the Quinnite Nation mobilized into WE ARE NOT TRASH, a student-led, community-oriented effort to advocate for thoughtful, citizen-oriented policy-making from their elected leaders. On Saturday, November 5, 2011, approximately 500 people marched alongside a group of civic leaders from south Dallas across one of the Trinity River bridges into Downtown Dallas.

===Trayvon Martin verdict===
On March 23, 2012, hundreds of community members joined Paul Quinn students to protest the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, by George Zimmerman on February 26 of the same year.

August 6, 2013, vice-president of content with HBCU Buzz, Robert K. Hoggard wrote, &quot;Incensed by the legal protections that led to Zimmerman’s acquittal for the killing of Trayvon Martin, Paul Quinn College, a historically black college in Southern Dallas, is offering the new $7,500 Scholarship for Social Justice to a student who shows potential to bring about change in the community and in the justice system.&quot;

===Student organizations===
Student organizations on campus include the Student Government Association, class organizations, the Vocal Ensemble, and the PQC Spirit Team. Furthermore, students can be initiated into honor societies, such as Phi Delta Kappa and Alpha Chi National College Honor Society, as well as National Pan-Hellenic Council fraternities and sororities. PQC also offers Multicultural Greek Council organizations.

===Dress code===
Since the 2007 academic year, the college uses a &quot;business casual&quot; dress code. This encourages students to develop professional attitudes and behaviors in preparation for future success. Students are not allowed to wear saggy pants, jeans, flip flops, slippers, pajama bottoms, nor shorts, sweatsuits, or shirts without collars outside their dormitories on weekdays from 7 am - 5:30 pm, unless involved in exercise. A college closet was established to help provide professional business clothing for students in need.

==Athletics==

The Paul Quinn athletic teams are called the Tigers. The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Red River Athletic Conference (RRAC) since the 1998–99 academic year. They are also a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA). The Tigers previously competed as a founding member of the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) from 1920–21 to 1928–29, which is currently an NCAA Division I FCS athletic conference.

Paul Quinn competes in nine intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, track &amp; field and volleyball.

===Accomplishments===
Paul Quinn teams have won 18 conference championships since 1983.

==Campus==

The John Hurst Adams Administrative Building, formerly Price-Branch Classroom Building, contains the presidential suite administrative offices and classrooms. In the fall of 2011, two fully interactive technology classrooms were built on the second level of the building. These classrooms have state of the art video conferencing capability.

The Isabel and Comer Cottrell Student Union Building, also known as the SUB, was completed in 1970. The SUB includes the cafe, the Tiger&#x27;s Den, the student lounge, and the student workout facility. In the fall of 2012, the institution will convert the student workout facility into the Quinnite Retention Center, a 24-hour study facility that will aide in the college&#x27;s efforts to improve retention rates. The space that was formerly the campus bookstore will now be a state of the art gym facility that students, staff, and faculty can use. The Grand Lounge is the campus&#x27; primary meeting space. It is also where the weekly Chapel services are held.

The Richard Allen Chapel, formerly Carr P. Collins Chapel, completed in 1970, is currently under renovation. The lawn of the chapel is the venue for the annual commencement exercises. Completed in 1970, it serves as the religious education building.

The gymnasium was completed in 1961. In spring 2011, the gymnasium was outfitted with a new HVAC system.

Zale Library was completed in 1963. The library contains a 9x23 foot mural that was painted by artist Louis Freund in 1968. The mural depicts the progression and struggles of African-Americans in the pursuit of an education. In spring 2011, more than 900 volumes of legal publications were donated by Hunton &amp; Williams, LLP to start the Paul Quinn College Law Library.

The school has one residence hall, the Lucy Hughes Hall, formerly Pearl C. Anderson hall. the dormitory for females opened in 1969 as a facility of Bishop College. It currently serves men and women.

<doc id="1051439" wikidata="Q4962771" url="?curid=1051439" title="Brewster Jennings &amp; Associates">
<text>Brewster Jennings &amp; Associates was a front company set up in 1994 by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as a cover for its officers. The most famous is Valerie Plame, a &quot;covert employee of the CIA&quot; whose then-classified status was published in a syndicated newspaper column by Robert Novak on July 14, 2003. Novak later said that his initial primary source was then-United States Deputy Secretary of State (2001–2005) Richard Armitage, though Armitage disagreed with Novak as to the extent of his role.

==Plame affair==

According to Walter Pincus and Mike Allen, in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; of October 4, 2003, Brewster Jennings &amp; Associates was &quot;the obscure and possibly defunct firm&quot; at one time listing Valerie Plame as a staff member:Plame&#x27;s name was first published July 14, 2003, in a newspaper column by Robert D. Novak that quoted two senior administration officials. They were critical of Plame&#x27;s husband, former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson, IV, for his handling of a CIA mission that undercut President Bush&#x27;s claim that Iraq had sought uranium from the African nation of Niger for possible use in developing nuclear weapons... The name of the CIA front company was broadcast yesterday [October 3, 2003, on CNN] by Novak, the syndicated journalist who originally identified Plame. Novak, highlighting Wilson&#x27;s ties to Democrats, said on CNN that Wilson&#x27;s &quot;wife, the CIA employee, gave $1,000 to Gore, and she listed herself as an employee of Brewster-Jennings &amp; Associates.&quot;

Whereas, in his appearance on CNN on October 3, 2003, Novak insisted, as quoted by Pincus and Allen the next day: &quot;&#x27;There is no such firm, I&#x27;m convinced. CIA people are not supposed to list themselves with fictitious firms if they&#x27;re under a deep cover – they&#x27;re supposed to be real firms, or so I&#x27;m told. Sort of adds to the little mystery,&#x27;&quot; the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporters disputed Novak&#x27;s conviction: In fact, it appears the firm did exist, at least on paper. The Dun &amp; Bradstreet database of company names lists a firm that is called both Brewster Jennings &amp; Associates and Jennings Brewster &amp; Associates. The phone number in the listing is not in service, and the property manager at the address listed said there is no such company at the property, although records from 2000 were not available.

Pincus and Allen explain also that:
The company&#x27;s identity, Brewster Jennings &amp; Associates, became public because it appeared in Federal Election Commission records on a form filled out in 1999 by Valerie Plame, the case officer at the center of the controversy, when she contributed $1,000 to Al Gore&#x27;s presidential primary campaign. After the name of the company was broadcast on October 3, 2003, administration officials confirmed that it was a CIA front. They said the obscure and possibly defunct firm was listed as Plame&#x27;s employer on her W-2 tax forms in 1999 when she was working undercover for the CIA.

Reiterating that the company was listed on the Dun &amp; Bradstreet database of company names, Ross Kerber and Bryan Bender, in an article published on October 10, 2003, in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, observe that &quot;Plame&#x27;s exposure as an intelligence operative has become a major controversy in Washington,&quot; stating: &quot;Former intelligence officials confirmed Plame&#x27;s cover was an invention and that she used other false identities and affiliations when working overseas. &#x27;All it was was a telephone and a post office box,&#x27; said one former intelligence official who asked not to be identified. &#x27;When she was abroad she had a more viable cover.&#x27;&quot;

Furthermore, reporting for the news service Knight Ridder, Warren Stroebel writes:
Compounding the damage, the front company, Brewster Jennings &amp; Associates, the name of which has been reported previously, apparently also was used by other CIA officers whose work now could be at risk, according to Vince Cannistraro, former CIA chief of counterterrorism operations and analysis. Now, Plame&#x27;s career as a covert operations officer in the CIA&#x27;s Directorate of Operations is over. Those she dealt with – on business or not – may be in danger. The directorate is conducting an extensive damage assessment. And Plame&#x27;s exposure may make it harder for American spies to persuade foreigners to share important secrets with them, U.S. intelligence officials said.

==D&amp;B statements==
A spokeswoman for Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a New Jersey operator of commercial databases, said Brewster Jennings was first entered into its records on May 22, 1994, but wouldn&#x27;t discuss the source of the filing. Its records list the company, at 101 Arch Street, Boston, Massachusetts, as a &quot;legal services office,&quot; which could mean a law firm, with annual sales of $60,000, one employee, and a chief executive identified as &quot;Victor Brewster, Partner.&quot;

==Origin of the company name==
The front company appears to have based its name on the late Benjamin Brewster Jennings, a president and founder of the Socony-Vacuum oil company, which would later become Mobil Oil and which then merged to become part of ExxonMobil. But the Jennings family denies any connection, said a grandson, Brewster Jennings, a real estate investor in Durango, Colorado. He said that since the firm was named as a CIA front he&#x27;s heard from many friends and family members who &quot;find tremendous humor in all this.&quot;

==Physical location==
According to research published by Pincus and Allen, &quot;The phone number in the Dun &amp; Bradstreet listing is not in service and the property manager at the address listed said there is no such company at the property, although records from 2000 were not available.&quot;

101 Arch Street is a 21-story &quot;tower finished in 1988 at the corner of Summer and Arch streets with 405,511 square feet (37673 square meters) of office space, then housing the upscale Dakota&#x27;s restaurant, since succeeded by Vinalia. Many commuters pass through the building as they exit the Downtown Crossing subway station. 101 Arch was sold in 2003 to CB Richard Ellis Investors of Los Angeles for an estimated $90 million.&quot;
==Nuclear investigation==
According to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and its main source Sibel Edmonds, Brewster Jennings &amp; Associates was used by the CIA to investigate an alleged foreign intelligence ring, including Pakistan&#x27;s ISI, which was attempting to recruit moles to obtain U.S. nuclear secrets. A parallel investigation was being run by the FBI. The American-Turkish Council put Brewster Jennings in contact with a number of Turkish agents involved in the ring, but who claimed to be conducting research in alternative energy sources. The Turkish agents were on the verge of hiring the firm for consultation when a senior US State Department official tipped them off, leading them to break off the relationship and warn the ISI and others of the front company. The State Department officially denies this. This official was later identified as Marc Grossman, the former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs from 2001-2005, both under sworn testimony by Edmonds and by other sources.

<text>Probabilistic encryption is the use of randomness in an encryption algorithm, so that when encrypting the same message several times it will, in general, yield different ciphertexts. The term &quot;probabilistic encryption&quot; is typically used in reference to public key encryption algorithms; however various symmetric key encryption algorithms achieve a similar property (e.g., block ciphers when used in a chaining mode such as CBC), and stream ciphers such as Freestyle which are inherently random. To be semantically secure, that is, to hide even partial information about the plaintext, an encryption algorithm must be probabilistic.

== History ==

The first provably-secure probabilistic public-key encryption scheme was proposed by Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali, based on the hardness of the quadratic residuosity problem and had a message expansion factor equal to the public key size. More efficient probabilistic encryption algorithms include Elgamal, Paillier, and various constructions under the random oracle model, including OAEP.

== Security ==

Probabilistic encryption is particularly important when using public key cryptography. Suppose that the adversary observes a ciphertext, and suspects that the plaintext is either &quot;YES&quot; or &quot;NO&quot;, or has a hunch that the plaintext might be &quot;ATTACK AT CALAIS&quot;. When a deterministic encryption algorithm is used, the adversary can simply try encrypting each of their guesses under the recipient&#x27;s public key, and compare each result to the target ciphertext. To combat this attack, public key encryption schemes must incorporate an element of randomness, ensuring that each plaintext maps into one of a large number of possible ciphertexts.

An intuitive approach to converting a deterministic encryption scheme into a probabilistic one is to simply pad the plaintext with a random string before encrypting with the deterministic algorithm. Conversely, decryption involves applying a deterministic algorithm and ignoring the random padding. However, early schemes which applied this naive approach were broken due to limitations in some deterministic encryption schemes. Techniques such as Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) integrate random padding in a manner that is secure using any trapdoor permutation.

== Examples ==

Example of probabilistic encryption using any trapdoor permutation:

* &quot;x&quot; - &quot;single bit&quot; plaintext
* &quot;f&quot; - trapdoor permutation (deterministic encryption algorithm)
* &quot;b&quot; - hard core predicate of &quot;f&quot;
* &quot;r&quot; - random string

formula_1

formula_2

This is inefficient because only a single bit is encrypted. In other words, the message expansion factor is equal to the public key size.

Example of probabilistic encryption in the random oracle model:

* &quot;x&quot; - plaintext
* &quot;f&quot; - trapdoor permutation (deterministic encryption algorithm)
* &quot;h&quot; - random oracle (typically implemented using a publicly specified hash function)
* &quot;r&quot; - random string

<text>The Members Church of God International (), abbreviated as MCGI, is an international Christian religious organization with headquarters in the Philippines. It is popularly known in the Philippines as Ang Dating Daan (; abbreviated as ADD), after its flagship radio and television program of the same name which is also the longest-running religious program in the Philippines which was hosted by Eli Soriano, MCGI&#x27;s &quot;Overall Servant&quot; (former title: &quot;Presiding Minister&quot;) until his death in 2021.

In compliance with government regulations, Eli Soriano registered the group with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as &quot;Ang Mga Kaanib sa Iglesia ng Dios Kay Kristo Hesus, Haligi at Saligan ng Katotohan, sa Bansang Pilipinas&quot; (English: Members of the Church of God in Christ Jesus, Pillar and Ground of Truth in the Philippines). In 2004, its registered name was changed to &quot;Members Church of God International&quot; () in line with the church&#x27;s overseas expansion. The group is known in Hispanophone and Lusophone countries as &quot;Miembros de la Iglesia de Dios Internacional&quot; and &quot;Membros da Igreja de Deus Internacional&quot; respectively, shortened as MIDI.

MCGI is not related to the many Church of God groups that descended from the Barney Creek Meeting House revival of the late 19th century in the United States.

==History==
The Members Church of God International in the Philippines rooted from a similar denomination, the &quot;Iglesia ng Dios kay Cristo Jesús, Haligi at Suhay ng Katotohanan&quot; (Church of God in Christ Jesus, Pillar and Support of the Truth) which was first headed by Nicolas Antiporda Perez in Pulilan, Bulacan, Philippines in 1928. It started as a small group with less than a hundred believers.

===Perez&#x27; leadership (1928–1975)===
On December 10, 1936, the church was registered with the Philippine government by Perez as Presiding Minister with a Central Office in Natividad St., Pasay &quot;(then part of Rizal)&quot;. Since then, church workers were being sent to nearby provinces around Manila.

Perez led the church from 1928 until the time of his death in May 1975. In 1969, Perez gave Soriano an identification card bearing the &quot;Minister&quot; title. Before Perez died, he did not lay his hands on a successor. After the death of Perez, Soriano outlined the topics being taught to the members, in order for them not to lose hope. The members thought Perez prepared those topics before he died but other workers in the church knew, however, that it was written by Soriano.

On July 11, 1975, members of the Board of Trustees, including Soriano, allowed Levita Gugulan, the Secretary General, to act as &quot;temporary&quot; presiding officer until such time a new presiding officer is elected, in compliance to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, Gugulan led the church permanently.

===Schism and legal battle===
Soriano and other members believe women are not allowed to rule over the church according to the Bible. In their belief that the group formerly led by Perez already went astray in the teachings of God, Soriano left the group led by Gugulan, together with some members who testified that they have heard Perez preach that it is strictly prohibited in the Bible for a woman to rule over the Church of God.

Soriano registered &quot;Mga Kaanib sa Iglesia ng Dios kay Kristo Hesus Haligi at Saligan ng Katotohanan&quot; (Members of the Church of God in Christ Jesus, the Pillar and Ground of Truth) with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Soriano used the word &quot;saligan&quot; (ground or foundation) in reference to the Greek word &quot;ἑδραίωμα&quot; (hedraióma), and not &quot;suhay&quot; (brace), which is used by Gugulan&#x27;s group.

Gugulan&#x27;s group filed a petition with the SEC to compel Soriano to change the registered name of his group. During the pendency of the case, Soriano registered &quot;Ang Mga Kaanib sa Iglesia ng Dios Kay Kristo Hesus, Haligi at Saligan ng Katotohanan sa Bansang Pilipinas&quot; to comply with the SEC. In 1996, the SEC En Banc favored Gugulan&#x27;s petition and it was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in 1999. In December 2001, the Supreme Court First Division denied Soriano&#x27;s appeal with finality. Pending Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, Soriano reserved a new corporate name in 1996 containing transliterated Hebrew words and have it finalized in 2004 with the current name.

===Soriano&#x27;s leadership (1977–2021)===

In the 1970s, missionary works started and were first in the towns of Pampanga and then, the neighboring provinces of Bulacan, Rizal, Nueva Ecija, Bataan, and Metro Manila. In the last quarter of 1980, the church launched the radio program Ang Dating Daan. Through the local radio station DWWA 1206 kHz, the radio program was heard in many parts of the Philippines. The program became popular because of its unique live question-and-answer portion. In 1983, the program kicked off its national television appearance through IBC Channel 13. &quot;Ang Dating Daan&quot; as a program in radio made its stint in television through RJTV 29, PTV 4, SBN 21, and now UNTV.

On January 13, 2004, the church registered &quot;Members Church of God International&quot; as its corporate name in the SEC. In the same year, the church tapped GlobeCast for The Old Path (TOP) Channel satellite broadcast in the United States of America and Canada.

On January 7, 2006, the first live Bible exposition in the United States was held in Los Angeles, California. In 2008, Bible Expositions were conducted in the continent of Oceania bringing forth the first congregation in Papua New Guinea. In the same year, congregations were established in Ghana, West Africa as a result of a series of Bible studies in Africa. The early months of 2009 saw the Church introduced in Latin America.

In June 2011, Soriano doles out vitamins, medicines for the congregation.

===Razon&#x27;s leadership (2021–present)===
From April 4–10, 2021, the church holds a special event entitled &quot;The Legacy Continues&quot;. A week-long commemoration with worldwide events for public service and charity programs. A total of 628,567 individuals benefited from the global feeding program across 7,377 locations worldwide. During the event, a total of 2,021 branches of MCGI free stores are already opened from its initial launch. Another total of 1,200 individuals benefited for the mass wish-granting activity for small-scale livelihood grants and free tablets that they can use for online schooling needs.

==Organization==
The Members Church of God International as an organization is managed by its Central Administration under the Workers Ministry (&quot;now Servants&#x27; ministry)&quot;. It is composed of the Overall Servants (), council of Helpers of the Ministry ( abbreviated as &quot;KNP&quot;) and Church &quot;Servants&quot; ().

===Overall servants===
Bro. Eli Soriano was the Overall Servant () to the church (formerly called as presiding minister or &quot;Tagapangasiwang Pangkalahatan&quot; in Tagalog) until February 2021. His deputy, Bro. Daniel Razon is the Assistant Overall Servant (, formerly called as vice presiding minister or &quot;Pangalawang Tagapangasiwang Pangkalahatan&quot; in Tagalog).

They supervise the entire organization, implement policies and projects, teach the helpers of the ministry (formerly called as assistants to the administration, ministers-in-charge, abbreviated as &quot;MIC&quot; and officers-in-charge, abbreviated as &quot;OIC&quot;) and church workers all the doctrines of Christ and oversee rightful execution of duties and responsibilities assigned to them, including other officials in various church ministries and organizations.

The overall servant prepares the outline of biblical topics () and preach sermons. A part of it will be delivered and discussed by his deputy. Preaching of biblical topic is done by the Overall Servants, either live or recorded, which is being aired in all locale church congregations. They also personally take time to resolve spiritual and personal problems of members every Thanksgiving gathering, during the consultation period.

===Helpers and workers===
Helpers of the ministry supervise a church &quot;Division&quot; () referring to a geographical region in the Philippines or group of countries in a continent such as Asia Oceania. Area Servants (, formerly called as Tagapangasiwang Pampook and abbreviated as &quot;TP&quot;) oversee a church &quot;District&quot; () referring to one Philippine province. Assigned Church &quot;Servants&quot; administer various church services such as Prayer Meetings, Worship Services, Indoctrination Sessions, Bible Studies, Bible Expositions, and Thanksgiving in local congregations. They are allowed to communicate official memorandum signed by the Overall Servants and preside over matters and activities concerning the local church. Brethren can personally seek spiritual or personal advice from &quot;servants(encargado)&quot;, who were trained during ministerial classes, in giving Biblical advice and recommendations.

==Logo==
As required by Philippines agency Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for organizations to have their respective official seal, where every paper submitted to the office must have a dry seal, Bro. Eli Soriano was obliged to create a dry seal for the church. Thus the following symbols explain:
* The open book represents the Bible;
* The torch represents the lamp;
* The cords represent a binding tie, which is the love that exists among the members;
* The anchor represents the hope that the members have in the Church of God;
* The big star, which dominates everything in the logo, represents Christ;
* The four Hebrew characters on the open book, referred to as Tetragrammaton, read (right to left) as Yod, He, Vau, He, and translated in English as YHWH, is the original name of God in Hebrew, written in the Ten Commandments.

==Membership==
The church keeps a formal number of members but does not openly reveal it. In 2015, the church gained more than 20,000 new members through regular and mass baptisms.

As of 2015, the church has established more than 1,360 congregations in the Philippines and abroad, up from a total of 1,280 locales reported in 2014.

Congregations are grouped geographically by divisions, districts and zones mainly the Philippines, South America, North America, Canada, Asia Oceania, Middle East, Europe, Israel and Africa Division. The official website of the church reported its presence in 46 countries and territories as of 2010.

Since its arrival in South America in 2009, the church saw a growing number of locales in the continent. As of 2015, it reported 237 established locales in Brazil, including those in Curitiba, Porto Alegre, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Florianópolis.

Members not living in accordance with the church&#x27;s teachings may be excommunicated or expelled, from the church.

==Propagation and evangelization efforts==

The Members Church of God International believe that an important duty and obligation of the members of the church is to propagate the gospel on earth until the consummation of the ages. Eli Soriano began his nightly town-to-town preaching in the 1970s but eventually realized that his life is not enough to reach the entire Philippines. In the 1980s he decided to use emerging media such as radio and television.

In October 1980, it initially launched the &quot;Ang Dating Daan&quot; program hosted by Bro. Eli Soriano and Bro. Daniel Razon and later on Philippine television in February 1983. The program is now being broadcast in more than 70 countries, in five languages over terrestrial television, radio, internet and carried by at least seven satellites across the globe.

Currently, the church programs reach in six inhabited continents via TV Verdade, TV La Verdad, The Truth Channel and UNTV using the services of at least seven satellite providers.

===Radio broadcast===

The 30-minute AM radio program of &quot;Ang Dating Daan&quot; began in 1980. In 1999, the program is heard nationwide through DZRH, RMN and 100 Radyo Natin stations. Since 2011, the radio program is now on its home station UNTV Radyo La Verdad 1350.

===Television broadcast===
The program started its television debut in February 1983 on IBC-13. Later, it was transferred to RJTV-29, PTV-4 and SBN-21. In 2004, UNTV-37 became its permanent home. UNTV 37 is a free-to-air network and also carried by major cable networks and direct-to-home providers.

Between 2010 and 2011, the church reached the airwaves of India, Uruguay, Argentina, Bolivia and Portugal by acquiring timeslots in local television channels. To further boost viewership, it acquired a 30-minute slot on Fox Channel which is carried by 50 cable networks in Central America and South America. Later, the church acquired timeslots in Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Honduras, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Guatemala. In 2013, the program was aired in Mexico via Gala TV. It was followed by broadcasts in Dominican Republic, Spain, Equatorial Guinea and soon in Cuba.

The church also founded ADDTV in 2014 and launched it as Truth Channel on September 3, 2017. The channel features &quot;Itanong mo kay Soriano&quot;. In the same year, the church began its 24/7 free-to-air terrestrial broadcast &quot;El Camino Antiguo&quot; in El Salvador on Canal 61.

On February 13, 2016, MCGI receives Anak TV seals for its five television programs &quot;Truth in Focus&quot;, &quot;A Song of Praise&quot;, &quot;KNC Show&quot;, &quot;Munting Parangarap&quot; and &quot;Kaagapay&quot; approved by Anak TV Foundation.

On March 4, 2022, the church debuts a new program &quot;MCGI Cares &quot;on UNTV-37 and on social media hosted by Bro. Daniel Razon.

===Satellite broadcast===

In 2004, the church tapped GlobeCast to air the TOP Channel in United States and Canada via a direct-to-home satellite broadcast through Galaxy 19, Eutelsat Hotbird 13D and Measat which aims to propagate the program to English-speaking countries including Europe and Asia. In 2010, it was aired in the Philippines via Dream Satellite TV. In 2016, TOP Channel was relaunched as The Truth Channel.

On December 26, 2009, the church launched TV Verdade () via Star One C2, SES-6 and Thaicom 5. It primarily airs &quot;O Caminho Antigo&quot;, the Portuguese version of &quot;Ang Dating Daan&quot; through local free television channels in Brazil. Currently, the program airs in Minas Gerais, the second most populous state in Brazil, Paraná, Cornélio Procópio. In December 2016, TV Verdade HD was launched in high definition (HD) format (1080p) for households in South and Central America and some parts of North America via SES-6.

In July 2012, the church also launched TV La Verdad (), its broadcast channel for Spanish-speaking countries airing via SES-6.

===Online media===
In 1999, the church joined the World Wide Web when it launched a website called &quot;angdatingdaan.org&quot; with video streaming feature. Its English version went online in 2005 as &quot;theoldpath.tv.&quot;

From 2001 to 2007, the website &quot;Kaanib.NET&quot; was an online community and portal that connected the global members.

From 2004 to 2005, the website &quot;mybeliever.com&quot; was an online news magazine featuring church events with its printed version known as Believer NewsMagazine. The printed features memoirs of 2004 mid-year International Thanksgiving, Daniel S. Razon: the man of steel, MIC: ministers in Christ, a photoquote special edition and the last edition was Happy New Year which recognized Nisan as the start of year in Hebrew calendar.

In 2007, Eliseo Soriano published his official blogsite and another blog in 2014. ControversyX is an expository blog, in five languages, which tackles issues about religion. It has more than 4.5 million page views .

In 2009, the international website of the church went online as &quot;mcgi.org.&quot;

In 2012, the church&#x27;s official Facebook page was created.

In 2014, the church introduced the &quot;MCGI Broadcast App.&quot;

In October 2020, the MCGI Classified Ads was launched to cater job opportunities available for members.

A short-lived podcast program &quot;The Unheard Truth&quot; was launched on Google and Spotify until 2021.

Continuing the church propagation in spreading the word of God, MCGI released Digital Bible app on July 1, 2022. The app can be downloaded on both Android and iOS devices for free access of the public.

===Print media===
The church distributes print and digital materials for free. It publishes the &quot;TOP Magazine&quot;, &quot;Believer Newsmagazine&quot; and a newspaper called &quot;Magandang Balita&quot; (English: Good News). Soriano&#x27;s online blogs are also compiled and printed as &quot;The Blog Magazine&quot;.

The church has also been acknowledged by the Philippine Bible Society as a regular donor and major distribution partner of Tagalog Bibles. Copies of full-length &quot;Ang Dating Daan&quot; episodes are also distributed in DVD format.

==Beliefs and fundamental doctrines==
The Members Church of God International believes that the Almighty God, the Father sent his begotten Son, Jesus Christ, instrumental in the establishment of the &quot;Church of God&quot;, first planted in Jerusalem and preached by the apostles. They believe that gentile nations, including the Philippines, are partakers of the promise of eternal life through belief in Jesus Christ and the gospel and are not authorized by God to establish their own church, but were members associated with the same &quot;body&quot; or the church written in the gospel by accepting it and executing the doctrines written by the apostles. The church&#x27;s registered name contains descriptive words &quot;ang mga kaanib&quot; in Tagalog or &quot;members&quot; in English to emphasize the group&#x27;s association today, as members of the &quot;Church of God&quot; that was already established a long time ago.

For them, the church&#x27;s primary objective, as commanded by Jesus Christ, is to propagate the gospel to all nations until the consummation of the ages, convert sinners to believe and glorify God and to make them qualify for the eternal life in heaven. They believe in God the Father, Jesus Christ the Son, and the Holy Spirit but they adopt a nontrinitarianism orientation, rejecting the Trinitarian concept that there is &quot;one God in three co-equal persons&quot;, which for them is against the Bible. They believe that the Father is greater than all, greater than Jesus Christ as declared by Christ himself. They do not observe customs and traditions which they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Christianity. Church members prefer to be called and identified as plain &quot;Christians&quot;.

===God the Father===
The Almighty God is also called as &quot;God of Israel&quot; citing , the creator of the universe (), with his Son, Jesus Christ (). God cannot lie. God is not omniscient (he does not know ahead of time all future human actions and choices), and God is not omnipresent (he created hell but is not there).

===The Lord Jesus Christ===
Jesus Christ is the Father&#x27;s only Begotten Son (in Romanized Greek: &quot;Monogenēs theos&quot;) as mentioned in . For them, Christ is the Wonderful, Counselor, a true and Mighty God, Prince of Peace referred in . He is the only savior of mankind and the only way to the kingdom of God in heaven (, , ; ). He is recognized as the Apostle, High Priest () and Mediator () of the church. They believe that Christ descended on earth from the bosom of the Father, suffered for the redemption of sin, died on the cross, resurrected after three days, ascended to heaven and sat on the right side of God.

===The Holy Spirit===
The Holy Spirit is the &quot;comforter&quot; citing , sent by the Father and Christ, to give spiritual happiness and to help the brethren in his or her weaknesses, and to console a believer in times of persecution and trials ().

===Prayer===
Prayer is a basic doctrine in the church. All church gatherings, either spiritual or socio-civic, begin and end with prayers. The church believes that it is a commandment of God to live a prayerful life based on . To encourage its members to pray, the church launched an exclusive 24/7 prayer service website on March 6, 2011, enabling access to continuous singing of praises and hourly community prayer to God. They believe that it is prohibited to pray in public just to be seen (). As a discipline, they refrain from showing the act of praying on their television broadcasts, either live or recorded, in public. In November 2013, the church launched a community prayer service on UNTV and Radyo La Verdad 1350 AM. However, only the audio of the community prayer is being aired, to encourage non-brethren to join and participate in praying to God, without necessarily being seen publicly.

===Bible===
The church believes that only the Bible or the Holy Scriptures, composed of 66 inspired books of the Protestant canon, teaches the full wisdom of God for the salvation of man and that no other books should be used as basis for serving God and Jesus Christ.

===The Church of God in the Bible===
They believe that God is &quot;calling&quot; those people with determination to serve him, bringing them in his fold (, ; ), teaching them righteousness after baptism, for their sins to be covered by the priceless blood of Christ poured in Mount Calvary, for the redemption of sin, to make them qualify for life eternal in heaven (, ; ; ; ).

===The church mission===
The church believes that Jesus Christ delegated the task of preaching the Word of God, on a global scale, to his apostles based on and fulfilling this commandment is their primary objective. The church aims to propagate the gospel on earth until the consummation of the ages. They believe that only the church can teach the wisdom of God for the salvation of mankind citing , and . They believe that this effort is geared towards converting sinners to believe and glorify God ().

===Baptism===
Baptism is a key part in their doctrines. Membership is conferred through immersion baptism of adults. Indoctrination classes are required prior to joining the organization. The classes are composed of nine lessons concerning church doctrines prepared by the Overall Servant, Eliseo Soriano. Indoctrinees must fully accept the doctrines taught during the indoctrination before they can be baptized. The church rejects infant baptism.

====Mass baptism====
The church conducts a mass baptism at the 15th session of mass indoctrination series. This event is held at the MCGI Chapel in Apalit, Pampanga, and various MCGI coordinating centers worldwide. It is where listeners who completed the mass indoctrination sessions voluntarily accept the doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ.

==Church services and events==
The congregation meets regularly on a daily basis. Gatherings are held in Ang Dating Daan convention centers and monitoring centers, which are typically functional in character, and do not contain religious symbols except for the church logo and reminders for non-members that are prominently displayed.

All gatherings of the church are opened with congregational singing of an opening song, followed by hymns led by the choir and then an opening prayer. After prayer, it follows a reading of chapter or two of the Bible. The subject matter (topic) for most meetings is the same worldwide. After the topic has been delivered, brethren kneel down for closing prayers followed by a doxology and &quot;basbas&quot; (blessing). When guests or visitors are invited or wish to attend these church gatherings, they are free to stay in their seats.

The members believe that Christians should always attend religious gatherings regularly.

In 2011, a Bible-reading segment was added where a chapter or two of the Bible is being read. Meetings are devoted to the study of a Biblical topic, divided in portions, and will be continued in succeeding meetings.

In March 2020, the presentation of topic reactions was added, where members share what they have learned from the topic of previous gatherings, as part of the doctrine of edifying one another in the Christian love.

===Serbisyong kapatiran===
In July 2020, &quot;Serbisyong kapatiran&quot; is launched as online daily gathering of members from Mondays to Fridays at 9:30 p.m. in the Philippines.

Under SISSL, developers could modify and distribute source code and derived binaries freely. Furthermore, developers could choose to keep their modifications private or make them public. However, the SISSL is unique among OSI-approved licenses in requiring that &quot;The Modifications which You create must comply with all requirements set out by the Standards body in effect one hundred twenty (120) days before You ship the Contributor Version.&quot; If the Modifications do not comply, SISSL becomes a copyleft license, and source must be published &quot;under the same terms as this license [SISSL] on a royalty-free basis within thirty (30) days.&quot;

Several open source projects funded by Sun Microsystems were licensed under SISSL, including OpenOffice.org, and Sun Grid Engine (SGE). Later versions of OpenOffice.org were dual-licensed under the SISSL and LGPL until the retirement of the SISSL, at which time OpenOffice.org was relicensed only under the LGPL. Sun Grid Engine appears to still be covered by the SISSL.

Sun&#x27;s Chief Open Source Officer Simon Phipps announced the retirement of the license on September 2, 2005 to combat license proliferation. It is now listed by OSI as &quot;voluntarily retired&quot; by Sun, and the OSI license page states that &quot;Sun has ceased to use or recommend this license.&quot; OpenOffice.org 2.0 code, for example, is now licensed exclusively under the LGPL. Sun developed the Common Development and Distribution License, a variant of the Mozilla Public License and later released OpenSolaris and the GlassFish Application Server under that license.

<doc id="1051494" wikidata="Q3475496" url="?curid=1051494" title="School Certificate (New South Wales)">
<text>The School Certificate was a qualification issued by the Board of Studies, typically at the end of Year 10. The successful completion of the School Certificate was a requirement for completion of the Higher School Certificate. The School Certificate was issued for the last time in 2011. It has been replaced with the RoSA (Record of School Achievement)

==Tests==
To receive the School Certificate, students were required to sit for the School Certificate tests. There were five tests:
*English-literacy
*Mathematics
*Science
*Australian History, Geography, Civics and Citizenship
*Computing Skills

==Requirements==
Each student was required to study English, Mathematics, Science, History, Geography and Australian Civics and Citizenship and Personal Development, Health and Physical Education (PD/H/PE) every year in Years 7-9. Each course was also supposed to include a degree of computer use, so students became familiar with that technology.

At some time during Years 7-9 students must have studied courses in Creative Arts (Visual Arts and Music), Technology and Applied Studies and a Language Other Than English.

The student may also have completed a number of additional studies (electives). These additional studies were required to be completed in a number of hours, as defined by the Board of Studies. A student had a choice of these additional studies according to the courses which were available at their school.

==Review and abolition==
In his 1997 report &quot;Shaping their future&quot;, Professor Barry McGaw was highly critical of the School Certificate. His report noted several deficiencies in the School Certificate, including:

* The lack of preparedness of many students for Year 10, 11 and 12
* The apparent lack of challenge posed by Year 10 studies for more able students
* The ‘low stakes’ nature of the external assessment where students were not accountable for their own individual results
* Perceptions that the timing of external examinations in the middle of Year 10 has lessened the significance of subsequent Year 10 studies
* Concerns about a perceived discontinuity between junior and senior secondary school studies.

Professor McGaw recommended that the School Certificate be abolished and replaced, for students leaving school, with a statement of achievement which would include each student’s results on statewide tests in literacy and numeracy as well as school-based results in all courses completed in Year 10.

Despite Professor McGaw&#x27;s recommendations, the New South Wales government remained committed to the School Certificate, though major changes were made to its structure and timing in order to address some of the concerns listed above.

The disparity between the recommendations of the McGaw report and the actions taken by the New South Wales government led to frequent rumours and press reports of the ultimate abolition of the School Certificate. However, the NSW Government remained committed to the School Certificate for several years. In 2010, the New South Wales Government asked the Board of Studies to review the School Certificate as part of the changes to the school leaving age in New South Wales and also the development of a national curriculum. The NSW Government announced the abolition of the School Certificate after 2011, with students in year 10 that year being the final cohort to sit the external examinations and receive the qualification.

<text>Paul Hausser, also known as Paul Falk after taking his birth name post war (7 October 1880 – 21 December 1972), was a German general and then a high-ranking commander in the Waffen-SS who played a key role in the post-war efforts by former members of the Waffen-SS to achieve historical and legal rehabilitation.

Hausser served as an officer in the Prussian Army during World War I and attained the rank of general in the inter-war &quot;Reichsheer&quot;. After retirement, he joined the SS and was instrumental in forming the Waffen-SS. During World War II, he rose to the level of army group commander. He led Waffen-SS troops in the Third Battle of Kharkov, the Battle of Kursk and the Normandy Campaign. Hausser was the highest-ranking officer in the Waffen-SS alongside Sepp Dietrich. Unlike Dietrich, Hausser was a trained staff officer before joining the SS.

After the war he became a founding member and the first spokesperson of HIAG, a lobby group and a revisionist veterans&#x27; organisation, founded by former high-ranking Waffen-SS personnel in West Germany in 1951. It campaigned for the restoration of legal and economic rights of the Waffen-SS employing a multi-prong propaganda campaign to achieve its aims.

Hausser wrote two books, arguing the purely military role of the Waffen-SS and advancing the notion that its troops were &quot;soldiers like any other&quot;, according to the title of the second book. Under Hausser&#x27;s leadership, HIAG reshaped the image of the Waffen-SS as a so-called pan-European force that fought honorably and had no part in war crimes or Nazi atrocities. These notions have since been challenged by mainstream historians.
==Early life and military career==
Hausser was born on 7 October 1880 in Brandenburg an der Havel into a Prussian military family and entered the army in 1892. In 1899, he graduated from a cadet academy and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 155th (7th West Prussian) Infantry Regiment. Hausser graduated from the Prussian Military Academy in Berlin in 1911. Hausser married Elisabeth Gerard in 1912; the couple had one daughter who was born in December 1913. They remained married until his death in 1972.

During World War I he served in the German General Staff and in staff roles on the Eastern Front, primarily serving with the 109th Infantry Division between 1916 and 1918. He was promoted to major in 1918 and was retained in the postwar &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, reaching the rank of &quot;Oberst&quot; (colonel) by 1927.

Hausser retired from the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; in 1932 with the rank of Generalleutnant, having filled various appointments including chief of staff of &quot;Wehrkreis II&quot; (Military District 2) in Stettin, commander of the 10th Infantry Regiment, and deputy commander of the 4th Infantry Division. Hausser joined the right-wing World War I veterans&#x27; organization &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot;, becoming the head of its Brandenburg-Berlin chapter in 1933. Soon after, the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; was incorporated into the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), and, with the SA&#x27;s demise, into the SS.

==SS career==
In November 1934 Hausser was transferred to the &quot;SS-Verfügungstruppe&quot; (SS Dispositional Troops; SS-VT) and assigned to the SS-Junkerschule Bad Tölz. He became the Inspector of the SS-VT in 1936. In this role, Hausser was in charge of the troop&#x27;s military and ideological training but did not have command authority. The decision on deployment of the troops remained in Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s hands. This aligned with Hitler&#x27;s intentions to maintain these troops exclusively at his disposal, &quot;neither [a part] of the army, nor of the police&quot;, according to Hitler&#x27;s order of 17 August 1938.
Hausser served during the 1939 invasion of Poland as an observer with the mixed &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;/SS Panzer Division &quot;Kempf&quot;. In October 1939 the SS-VT was formed as a motorized infantry division known as the SS-&quot;Verfügungs&quot;-Division with Hausser in command. He led the division, later renamed 2nd SS Division Das Reich, through the French campaign of 1940 and in the early stages of Operation Barbarossa. For his service in the Soviet Union, Hausser was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross in 1941 and the Oak Leaves in 1943 (he received the Swords for his service in Normandy). He was severely wounded, losing an eye.

After recovering, he commanded the newly formed SS-Panzer Corps (renamed II SS Panzer Corps in June 1943) and against Hitler&#x27;s explicit orders withdrew his troops from Kharkov to avoid encirclement. He led the 1st, 2nd and 3rd SS divisions during the Battle of Kursk. After Kursk, his Corps was re-formed (substituting the 1st, 2nd and 3rd SS Panzer Divisions with the 9th and 10th SS divisions) and sent to Italy, then to France where he commanded them in the early stages of the Normandy Campaign.

After the death of Friedrich Dollmann, commander of the Seventh Army, Hausser was promoted to its command. During the Falaise encirclement in 1944, Hausser was seriously wounded (shot through the jaw). Hausser was promoted to SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer in August 1944 and subsequently commanded Army Group Oberrhein and later Army Group G until 3 April 1945. On the day he was relieved, Joseph Goebbels wrote, &quot;He has definitely not stood the test.&quot; He ended the war on the staff of Field Marshal Albert Kesselring. At the Nuremberg Trials, he claimed that the Waffen-SS only had a military role and denied that it was involved in war crimes and atrocities.

==Post-war activities==

===Work for U.S. Army Historical Division===
Following the war, Hausser participated in the work of the U.S. Army Historical Division, where under the guidance of Franz Halder, German generals wrote World War II operational studies for the U.S. Army, first as POWs and then as employees. In the late 1940s, Hausser authored an operational study on the Seventh Army&#x27;s response to the Allied Normandy breakout. The study, together with contributions from Rudolf Christoph von Gersdorff, Heinrich Freiherr von Lüttwitz, Wilhelm Fahrmbacher and Heinrich Eberbach, was published in 2004 as &quot;Fighting the Breakout: The German Army in Normandy from COBRA to the Falaise Gap&quot;.

===Leader of Waffen-SS lobby group===
From 1950, Hausser was active in HIAG, a revisionist organization and a lobby group of former Waffen-SS members. HIAG began in late 1950 as a loose association of local groups; by October 1951, however, it claimed to embrace 376 local branches across West Germany. In December 1951, Hausser became its first spokesperson.

With the publication of its first periodical in late 1951, HIAG was beginning to draw attention to itself and generate public controversy, including speculation that it was a neo-Nazi organization. In response, Hausser wrote an open letter to the &quot;Bundestag&quot; denying these accusations and describing the HIAG as an advocacy organisation for former Waffen-SS troops. Hausser asserted that its members rejected all forms of radicalism and were &quot;upstanding citizens&quot;.

As part of its lobbying efforts, HIAG attempted to &quot;manipulate historical record or simply to ignore it&quot;, according to the historian David C. Large, who studied HIAG in the 1980s. HIAG&#x27;s rewriting of history included significant multi-prong propaganda efforts, including tendentious periodicals, books and public speeches, along with the publishing house of Munin Verlag, to serve as a platform for its publicity aims. The express aim of Munin Verlag was to publish the &quot;war narratives&quot; of former Waffen-SS members, in cooperation with HIAG.

===Memoirs===
Paul Hausser&#x27;s 1953 book &quot;Waffen-SS im Einsatz&quot; (&quot;Waffen-SS in Action&quot;) was the first major work by one of the HIAG leaders. It was published by , owned by a right-wing politician and publisher . A foreword from the former Wehrmacht General Heinz Guderian provided an endorsement for the Waffen-SS troops and referred to them as &quot;the first realization of the European idea&quot;.

The book described the growth of Waffen-SS into a multinational force where foreign volunteers fought heroically as a &quot;militant example of the great European idea&quot;. Historians have refuted this characterisation, arguing that it was largely Nazi propaganda employed to bolster the ranks of the Waffen-SS with foreign volunteers. The message was later repurposed by HIAG as it sought historical and legal rehabilitation of the force. &quot;Waffen-SS in Action&quot; was included in the index of objectionable war books maintained by West Germany&#x27;s Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons. The index was created in the early 1960s to limit the sale of such works to minors due to their chauvinism and glorification of violence.

Hausser later wrote another book, published in 1966 by HIAG&#x27;s imprint , under the title &quot;Soldaten wie andere auch&quot; (&quot;Soldiers Like Any Other&quot;). According to the military historian S.P. MacKenzie, the work epitomised how HIAG leaders wanted the Waffen-SS to be remembered, while the historian Charles Sydnor described it as &quot;equally tendentious&quot;.

Hausser&#x27;s books, along with those by other key HIAG members and former Waffen-SS Generals Felix Steiner and Kurt Meyer, have been characterised by the historian Charles Sydnor as the &quot;most important works of [Waffen-SS] apologist literature.&quot; These works demanded rehabilitation of the military branch of the Nazi Party and presented Waffen-SS members as both victims and misunderstood heroes.

==Historical revisionism==
By the mid-1950s, under Hausser&#x27;s guidance, HIAG attempted to establish a position that separated the Waffen-SS from other SS formations and shifted responsibility for crimes that could not be denied to the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; (security and police), the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; (concentration camp organisation, &quot;Death&#x27;s Head troops&quot;) and the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; (mobile killing units). The Waffen-SS, according to this position, could thus be successfully integrated into the parallel myth of the clean Wehrmacht.

Hausser continued to deny that there was any connection between the Waffen-SS and Nazi atrocities. In 1957, he wrote an open letter in &quot;Der Freiwillige&quot;, HIAG&#x27;s official publication, to West Germany&#x27;s minister of defence, stating that Death&#x27;s Head troops &quot;merely served as external guards in the concentration camps without the possibility of interfering with the internal procedure&quot;. He did not mention that the guards accompanied prisoners on external labor details and that commanders of concentration camps generally came from the Waffen-SS. This apologist position also ignored the fact that the organizational structure of the SS tied the Waffen-SS to the Nazi annihilation machine through transfer of personnel between various SS units and the shifting responsibilities of the units themselves, as they may perform frontline duties at one time and then be reassigned to &quot;pacification actions&quot;, the Nazi term for punitive operations in the rear.

The German historian Karsten Wilke, who wrote a book on HIAG, &quot;Die &quot;Hilfsgemeinschaft auf Gegenseitigkeit&quot; (HIAG) 1950–1990: Veteranen der Waffen-SS in der Bundesrepublik&quot; (&quot;HIAG 1950–1990: Waffen-SS veterans in the Federal Republic&quot;), notes that, by the 1970s, HIAG attained a monopoly on the historical representation of the Waffen-SS. Its recipe was simple and contained just four ingredients:
*The Waffen-SS was apolitical
*It was elite
*It was innocent of all war crimes or Nazi atrocities
*It was a European army &quot;par excellence&quot;, the Army of Europe.

Historians dismiss, and even ridicule, HIAG&#x27;s characterization. The French author Jean-Paul Picaper labels it as a &quot;self-panegyric&quot;, while David Clay Large uses the words &quot;extravagant fantasies about [Waffen-SS&#x27;s] past and future&quot;. The historian James M. Diehl describes HIAG&#x27;s claims of the Waffen-SS being the &quot;fourth branch of the Wehrmacht&quot; as &quot;false&quot;, and HIAG&#x27;s insistence that the force was a precursor to NATO as &quot;even more outrageous&quot;.

Hausser&#x27;s last project within HIAG was the five-hundred page SS picture tome under the nostalgic title &quot;Wenn alle Brüder schweigen&quot; (&quot;When All Our Brothers Are Silent&quot;); the project was spearheaded by Hausser, along with convicted Nazi war criminal Joachim Peiper, another prominent Waffen-SS figure, as a contributor. The publication was released in 1973.

Hausser died at the age of 92, on 21 December 1972 at Ludwigsburg.

<doc id="1051506" wikidata="Q1166813" url="?curid=1051506" title="Dharug">
<text>The Dharug or Darug people, are a nation of Aboriginal Australian clans, who share ties of kinship, country and culture. In pre-colonial times, lived as hunters in the region of current day Sydney. The Darug speak one of two dialects of the Dharug language related to their coastal or inland groups. There was armed conflict between the Dharug and the English settlers in the first half of the 19th century. Controversy over land rights, deference to culture and official return of Dharug artifacts, such as the skull of the warrior Pemulwuy.

== Dharug country ==
Dharug country covers an area of approximately 6,000 km2 (2,300 square miles). In the north, it reaches the Hawkesbury River and its mouth at Broken Bay, creating a border with the Awabakal. To the northwest, the Dharug country extends to the town of Mount Victoria in the Blue Mountains meeting the Darkinjung. To the west, Wiradjuri country begins at the eastern fringe of the Blue Mountains. To the southwest, in the Southern Highlands, is the border with Gandangara country. In the southeast, in the Illawarra area is the border with the traditional Tharawal lands. The Dharug traditional country includes the areas around Campbelltown, Liverpool, Camden, Penrith and Windsor.

==Dharug language and people==

The Dharug language, has two dialects; one inland and one coastal. 

The word &quot;myall&quot;, now a pejorative word in Australian English denoting any Aboriginal person who keeps a traditional way of life, originated in the Dharug language. In Dharug, the word &quot;mayal&quot; means anyone from another clan or country.

The two dialects are associated with the activities of the inland (&quot;paiendra&quot; or &quot;tool people&quot;) and the coastal (&quot;katungal&quot; or &quot;&quot;sea people&quot;)&quot; people, respectively. Traditionally, the &quot;paiendra&quot; hunted kangaroos, emus and other land animals, and used stone axes more extensively than the &quot;katungal&quot;. The &quot;katungal&quot; built canoes, harvesting primarily seafood diet, including fish and shellfish from Sydney Harbour, Botany Bay and their associated rivers.

===Clans===

The Dharug nation consisted of a number of clans and their descendant clans. Each group of approximately 50 to 100 individuals lived in their own particular geographic area. According to James Kohen, academic and expert witness for the Dharug people, describes 15 clans while others describe 29 individual clans.

==History of contact==
Between 1794 and about 1830, the Hawkesbury River area was a place of conflict between Dharug people and the more than 400 British settlers in the region. The farms created by the settlers disrupted access to the river and the gathering of food by the Dharug. Dharug who took crops from the farms were killed, for example, by gibbeting or hanging, by the settlers. The Dharug burned the farmers&#x27; crops in retaliation. In 1795, as the level of conflict escalated, government troops were sent to protect the settlers. In 1801, Governor King ordered troops to patrol farms on the Georges River and to shoot any Dharug on sight. In 1816, Governor Macquarie forbade Aboriginals to carry any weapons within two kilometres of a house or a town or to congregate in groups bigger than six. He also authorised settlers to establish vigilante groups and the addition of three new military outposts.

A group led by Pemulwuy, a Dharug warrior, raided Parramatta, where he was severely wounded and then fled. His group was accused of killing 4 settlers and of raping women. The government issued orders for his capture, dead or alive. He was shot and killed by two settlers in 1802. His head was severed, pickled and dispatched by King to Sir Joseph Banks. Although William, Prince of Wales advised he would return Pemulwuy&#x27;s remains, in 2010, the skull had not been located. 

Tedbury, Pemluwuy&#x27;s son, raided farms until 1810. Mosquito, another warrior, led raids for about 20 years before he was captured and hanged in Van Diemen&#x27;s land (now Tasmania) 1823.

Smallpox, introduced in 1789 by the British, led to the deaths of up to 90% of the Dharug population in some areas. For safety, some Dharug moved to live in the sandstone caves and overhangs of the Hawksbury river region, while others remained in dwellings made from bark, sticks and branches.

==Controversy==
A place of deep Dharug cultural importance is an area previously called &quot;Blacks Town&quot; and now the suburb of Colebee which lies in the Blacktown local government area. In 2012, City of Blacktown ceased recognition of the Dharug people as the traditional owners of the area. The council also passed a motion, opposed by some councillors, to begin a process to consider changing the name &quot;Blacktown&quot;. In response, an online petition was launched calling for the recognition of the Dharug people.

In 2020, the Hills Shire Council, whose local government area includes Dharug land, rejected requests to include an Acknowledgement of Country at its meetings. It is the only Sydney local council that does not include an Acknowledgement of Country at its meetings.

<doc id="1051508" wikidata="Q547716" url="?curid=1051508" title="Iolo Morganwg">
<text>Edward Williams, better known by his bardic name Iolo Morganwg (; 10March 174718December 1826), was a Welsh antiquarian, poet and collector. He was seen as an expert collector of Medieval Welsh literature, but it emerged after his death that he had forged several manuscripts, notably some of the Third Series of Welsh Triads. Even so, he had a lasting impact on Welsh culture, notably in founding the secret society known as the Gorsedd, through which Iolo Morganwg successfully co-opted the 18th-century Eisteddfod revival. The philosophy he spread in his forgeries has had an enormous impact upon neo-Druidism. His bardic name is Welsh for &quot;Iolo of Glamorgan&quot;.

==Early life==
Edward Williams was born in Pen-onn, near Llancarfan, Vale of Glamorgan, and raised in the village of Flemingston (or Flimston; &quot;Trefflemin&quot; in Welsh). He followed his father as a stonemason. In Glamorgan, he took an interest in manuscript collection, and learnt to compose Welsh poetry from poets such as Lewis Hopkin, Rhys Morgan, and especially Siôn Bradford. 

In 1773, he moved to London, where the antiquary Owen Jones introduced him to the city&#x27;s Welsh literary community, and where he became a member of the Gwyneddigion Society: he would later also be active in the Cymreigyddion Society. In 1777 he returned to Wales, where he married and tried farming, but without success. During this time he produced his first forgeries.

Williams&#x27;s son, Taliesin (bardic name, Taliesin ab Iolo), whom he had named after the early medieval bard Taliesin, later went on to collect his manuscripts in 26 volumes, a selection being published as the &quot;Iolo Manuscripts&quot; by the Welsh Manuscripts Society in 1848.

==Literary career==
From an early date Williams was concerned with preserving and maintaining the literary and cultural traditions of Wales. He produced a large number of manuscripts as evidence for his claims that ancient Druidic tradition had survived the Roman conquest, the conversion of the populace to Christianity, the persecution of bards under King Edward I, and other adversities. His forgeries develop an elaborate mystical philosophy, which he claimed as a direct continuation of ancient Druidic practice. Williams&#x27;s reportedly heavy use of laudanum may have been a contributing factor.

Williams first came to public notice in 1789 for &quot;Barddoniaeth Dafydd ab Gwilym&quot;, a collection of the poetry of the 14th-century Dafydd ap Gwilym. Included were a large number of hitherto unknown poems by Dafydd that he claimed to have found; these are regarded as Williams&#x27;s first forgeries. 

His success led him to return to London in 1791, where he founded the Gorsedd, a community of Welsh bards, at a ceremony on 21 June 1792 at Primrose Hill. He organised the occasion according to what he claimed were ancient Druidic rites. In 1794 he published some of his own poetry, which was later collected in a two-volume &quot;Poems, Lyric and Pastoral&quot;. Essentially his only genuine work, it proved quite popular.

Williams worked with Owen Jones and William Owen Pughe on &quot;The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales&quot;, a three-volume collection of medieval Welsh literature published in 1801–1807. This relied partly on manuscripts in Williams&#x27;s collection, some his forgeries. The forged material included a false &quot;Brut&quot; chronicle and a book attributed to Saint Cadoc. The second volume, which collected the Welsh Triads, contained an additional &quot;third series&quot; of forged triads, as well as Williams&#x27;s alterations to the authentic ones.

After Williams&#x27;s death some of his collection was compiled into &quot;The Iolo Manuscripts&quot; by his son, Taliesin Williams. His papers were used by many later scholars and translators, and for reference by Lady Charlotte Guest as she translated the prose collection &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. She did not, however, rely on Williams&#x27;s editions of the tales themselves, except for &quot;Hanes Taliesin&quot;. Later still, further Williams forgeries were published in a text known as &quot;Barddas&quot;. This work, published in two volumes in 1862 and 1874, was claimed to be a translation of works by Llywelyn Siôn, detailing the history of the Welsh bardic system from its ancient origins to the present day. Though it contains nothing of authentic Druidic lore, it is the fullest account of the mystical cosmology Williams developed. 

Other works by Williams include the &quot;Druid&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, still used by the Gorsedd and by neo-Druid groups, a treatise on Welsh metrics called &quot;Cyfrinach Beirdd Ynys Prydain&quot; (&quot;The Mystery of the Bards of the Isle of Britain&quot;), published posthumously in 1828, and a hymn series published as &quot;Salmau yr Eglwys yn yr Anialwch&quot; (&quot;Psalms of the church in the wilderness&quot;) in 1812.

==Philosophy==

Iolo&#x27;s philosophy represented a fusion of Christian and Arthurian influences, a romanticism comparable to that of William Blake and the Scottish poet and forger James MacPherson, the revived antiquarian enthusiasm for all things &quot;Celtic&quot;, and such elements of bardic heritage as had genuinely survived among Welsh-language poets. Part of his aim was to assert the Welshness of South Wales, particularly his home region of Glamorgan, against the prevalent idea that North Wales represented the purest survival of Welsh traditions. The metaphysics elucidated in his forgeries and other works proposed a theory of concentric &quot;rings of existence&quot;, proceeding outward from Annwn (the Otherworld) through Abred and Ceugant to Gwynfyd (purity or Heaven).

Outside his shop in Cowbridge was a sign saying his sugar was from plantations that employed no slaves. However, he contested a will in order to receive a legacy from one of his three brothers, all of whose plantations in Jamaica used slave labour.

By 1799 he had become a Unitarian, and was a leading spirit when a Unitarian Association was formed in South Wales in 1802. It was he who drew up its &quot;Rheolau a Threfniadau&quot; (Rules and Procedures), published in 1803.

==Bardic alphabet==

Iolo Morganwg developed his own runic system based on an ancient druid alphabet system, in Welsh Coelbren y Beirdd (&quot;the Bardic Alphabet&quot;). It was said to be the alphabetic system of the ancient druids. It consisted of 20 main letters, and 20 others &quot;to represent elongated vowels and mutations.&quot; These symbols were to be represented in a wooden frame, known as &quot;peithynen&quot;.

==Exposure==
Towards the end of the 19th century, the grammarian Sir John Morris-Jones was involved in exposing Iolo as a forger, which led to the bard being labelled a charlatan. Morris-Jones called Iolo &quot;hateful&quot; and said it would be an age &quot;before our history and literature are clean of the traces of his dirty fingers.&quot;

After the First World War, the scholar Griffith John Williams (1892–1963) was the first to make a full study of Iolo&#x27;s work, consulting original documents donated to the National Library of Wales by Iolo&#x27;s descendants in 1917. Williams aimed to find out exactly how much of Iolo&#x27;s output was based on imagination rather than fact. He established that the poems Iolo attributed to Dafydd ap Gwilym were forgeries. His researches led him to become a defender of Iolo&#x27;s reputation as well as a critic.

It has been suggested that some of Iolo&#x27;s claims were supported by oral tradition: recent research has revealed that the tale of Ieuan Gethin, a soldier in the Glyndŵr revolt, might have basis in fact.

==Legacy==
In 1926, in honor of the hundredth anniversary of Morganwg&#x27;s death, a plaque was mounted at the location of his old shop. It reads:

A memorial plaque was erected in 2009, on the approximate site of the first Gorsedd ceremony, held on London&#x27;s Primrose Hill in 1792, and another memorial stone on Stalling Down near Cowbridge, where the first Gorsedd ceremony in Wales took place in 1795.

Such was the extent of his forgery that, even into the 21st century, some of his tampered versions of medieval Welsh texts are better known than the original versions.

A Welsh-language school in Cowbridge, Ysgol Iolo Morganwg, is named after him, and Super Furry Animals vocalist Gruff Rhys dedicated a song to him on his 2014 album, &quot;American Interior&quot;.

<doc id="1051522" wikidata="Q716909" url="?curid=1051522" title="Ordre des Arts et des Lettres">
<text>The Order of Arts and Letters () is an order of France established on 2 May 1957 by the Minister of Culture. Its supplementary status to the was confirmed by President Charles de Gaulle in 1963. Its purpose is the recognition of significant contributions to the arts, literature, or the propagation of these fields.

Its origin is attributed to the Order of Saint Michael (established 1 August 1469), as acknowledged by French government sources.

==Background==
To be considered for the award, French government guidelines stipulate that citizens of France must be at least thirty years old, respect French civil law, and must have &quot;significantly contributed to the enrichment of the French cultural inheritance&quot;.

Membership is not, however, limited to French nationals; recipients include numerous foreign luminaries. Foreign recipients are admitted into the Order &quot;without condition of age&quot;.

The Order has three grades:
* (Commander) — medallion worn on a necklet; up to 20 recipients a year
* (Officer) — medallion worn on a ribbon with rosette on left breast; up to 60 recipients a year
* (Knight) — medallion worn on a ribbon on left breast; up to 200 recipients a year

The (medallion) of the Order is an eight-pointed, green-enameled asterisk, in gilt for Commanders and Officers and in silver for Knights; the obverse central disc has the letters &quot;A&quot; and &quot;L&quot; on a white-enameled background, surrounded by a golden ring emblazoned with the phrase . The reverse central disc features the head of Marianne on a golden background, surrounded by a golden ring bearing the words . The Commander&#x27;s badge is topped by a gilt twisted ring.

The ribbon of the Order is green with four white stripes.

==Members of the Order==

According to the statutes of the Order, French citizens must wait a minimum of 5 years before they are eligible to be upgraded from to , or to , and must have displayed additional meritorious deeds than just those that originally made them a . However, in the statutes, there is a clause saying &quot;&quot;. (Translation: &quot;The officers and commanders of the Legion of Honour can be promoted directly to an equivalent grade in the Order of Arts and Letters&quot;.) This means that if someone were to be made of the Legion of Honour, then the next year, that person could be directly made of the Order of Arts and Letters and bypass a nomination as a knight and the five-year rule.

<doc id="1051526" wikidata="Q21167512" url="?curid=1051526" title="Chemical hazard">
<text>Chemical hazards are hazards present in hazardous chemicals and hazardous materials. Exposure to certain chemicals can cause acute or long-term adverse health effects. Chemical hazards are usually classified separately from biological hazards (biohazards). Chemical hazards are classified into groups that include asphyxiants, corrosives, irritants, sensitizers, carcinogens, mutagens, teratogens, reactants, and flammables. In the workplace, exposure to chemical hazards is a type of occupational hazard. The use of personal protective equipment may substantially reduce the risk of adverse health effects from contact with hazardous materials.

Long-term exposure to chemical hazards such as silica dust, engine exhausts, tobacco smoke, and lead (among others) have been shown to increase risk of heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure.

==Types of chemical hazard==

==Routes of exposure==
The most common exposure route to chemicals in the work environment is through inhalation. Gas, vapour, mist, dust, fumes, and smoke can all be inhaled. Those with occupations involving physical work may inhale higher levels of chemicals if working in an area with contaminated air. This is because workers who do physical work will exchange over 10,000 litres of air over an 8-hour day, while workers who do not do physical work will exchange only 2,800 litres. If the air is contaminated in the workplace, more air exchange will lead to the inhalation of higher amounts of chemicals.

Chemicals may be ingested when food or drink is contaminated by unwashed hands or from clothing or poor handling practices. When ingestion of a chemical hazard occurs it comes from when those said chemicals are absorbed while in the digestive tract of the body. Ingestion only occurs when food or drink has contact with the toxic chemical. This can happen through direct or indirect ingestion. When food or drink is brought into an environment where harmful chemicals are unsealed there is the possibility of those chemical vapors or particles contaminating the food or the drink. A more direct form of chemical ingestion is the possibility of consuming the chemical directly. This rarely happens but, it is possible, that if there is little to no labeling on the chemical containers and if they are not secured properly an accident can occur which could lead to someone mistakenly assuming the chemical was something it was not.
Chemical exposure to the skin is a common workplace injury and may also occur in domestic situations with chemicals such as bleach or drain-cleaners. The exposure of chemicals to the skin most often results in local irritation to the exposed area. In some exposures, the chemical will be absorbed through the skin and will result in poisoning. The eyes have a strong sensitivity to chemicals, and are consequently an area of high concern for chemical exposure. Chemical exposure to the eyes results in irritation and may result in burns and vision loss.

Injection is an uncommon method of chemical exposure in the workplace. Chemicals can be injected into the skin when a worker is punctured by a sharp object, such as a needle. Chemical exposure through injection may result in the chemical entering directly into the bloodstream.

==Symbols of chemical hazards==

Hazard pictograms are a type of labeling system that alerts people at a glance that there are hazardous chemicals present. The symbols help identify whether the chemicals that are going to be in use may potentially cause physical harm, or harm to the environment. The 9 symbols are: 

* Explosive (exploding bomb)
* Flammable (flame)
* Oxidizing (flame above a circle)
* Corrosive (corrosion of table and hand)
* Acute toxicity (skull and crossbones)
* Hazardous to environment (dead tree and fish) 
* Health hazard/hazardous to the ozone layer (exclamation mark)
* Serious health hazard (cross on a human silhouette)
* Gas under pressure (gas cylinder)

These pictographs are also subdivided into class and categories for each classification. The assignments for each chemical depends on their type and their severity. The standard set of 9 hazard pictograms was published and distributed as a regulatory requirement through the efforts of the United Nations via the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals.

==Controlling chemical exposure==

===Elimination and substitution===
Chemical exposure is estimated to have caused approximately 190,000 illnesses and 50,000 deaths of workers annually. There exists an unknown link between chemical exposure and subsequent illness or death. Therefore, the majority of these illnesses and deaths are thought to be caused by a lack of knowledge or awareness concerning the dangers of chemicals. The best method of controlling chemical exposure within the workplace is through the elimination or the substitution of all chemicals that are thought or known to cause illness or death.

===Engineering controls===
Although elimination and substitution of harmful chemicals is the best known method for controlling chemical exposure, there are other methods that can be implemented to diminish exposure. The implementation of engineering controls is an example of another method for controlling chemical exposures. When engineering controls are implemented, there is a physical change made to the work environment that will eliminate or reduce the risk to chemical exposure. An example of engineering controls is the enclosure or isolation of the process that creates the chemical hazard.

===Administrative controls and safe work practices===
If the process that creates the chemical hazard cannot be enclosed or isolated, the next best method is the implementation of administrative controls and work practices controls. This is the establishment of administrative and work practices that will reduce the amount of time and how often the workers will be exposed to the chemical hazard. An example of administrative and work practices controls is the establishment of work schedules in which workers have rotating job assignments. This will ensure that all workers have limited exposure to chemical hazards.

===Personal protective equipment===
Employers should provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect their workers from chemicals used within the workplace. The use of PPE prevents workers from being exposed to chemicals through the routes of exposure—inhalation, absorption through skin or eyes, ingestion, and injection. One example of how PPE usage can prevent chemical exposure concerns respirators. If workers wear respirators, they will prevent the exposure of chemicals through inhalation.

==First aid==
In case of an emergency, it is recommended to understand first aid procedures in order to minimize any damage. Different types of chemicals can cause a variety of damage. Most sources agree that it is best to rinse any contacted skin or eye with water immediately. Currently, there is insufficient evidence of how long the rinsing should be done, as the degree of impacts will vary for substances such as corrosive chemicals. 

Transporting the affected person to a health care facility may be important, depending on condition. If the victim needs to be transported before the recommended flush time, then flushing should be done during the transportation process. Some chemical manufacturers may state the specific type of cleansing agent that is recommended.

==Long-term risks==

===Cancers===
===Cardiovascular disease===
A 2017 SBU report found evidence that workplace exposure to silica dust, engine exhaust or welding fumes is associated with heart disease. Associations exist for exposure to arsenic, benzopyrenes, lead, dynamite, carbon disulfide, carbon monoxide, metalworking fluids and occupational exposure to tobacco smoke. Working with the electrolytic production of aluminium, or the production of paper when the sulfate pulping process is used, is associated with heart disease. An association was found between heart disease and exposure to compounds which are no longer permitted in certain work environments, such as phenoxy acids containing TCDD (dioxin) or asbestos.

Workplace exposure to silica dust or asbestos is also associated with pulmonary heart disease. There is evidence that workplace exposure to lead, carbon disulfide, or phenoxy acids containing TCDD, as well as working in an environment where aluminium is being electrolytically produced, are associated with stroke.

=== Reproductive and developmental disorders === 
Pesticides and carbon disulfide, amongst many other chemical species have been linked to disruptions of endocrine balances in the brain and ovaries. Any contact with harmful chemicals during the first few months of pregnancy or even after has been connected to some miscarriages and has affected the menstrual cycle to the point that it has been able to block ovulation. Chemicals inducing health issues during pregnancy may also affect infants or fetuses.

<doc id="1051535" wikidata="Q6470610" url="?curid=1051535" title="Lionel Murphy">
<text>Lionel Keith Murphy QC (30 August 1922 – 21 October 1986) was an Australian politician, barrister, and judge. He was a Senator for New South Wales from 1962 to 1975, serving as Attorney-General in the Whitlam government, and then sat on the High Court from 1975 until his death in 1986.

Murphy was born in Sydney, and attended Sydney Boys High School before matriculating at the University of Sydney. He initially graduated with a degree in chemistry, but then went on to Sydney Law School and eventually became a barrister. He specialised in labour and industrial law, and took silk in 1960. Murphy was elected to the Senate at the 1961 federal election, as a member of the Labor Party. He became Leader of the Opposition in the Senate in 1967.

Following Labor&#x27;s victory at the 1972 federal election, Gough Whitlam appointed Murphy as Attorney-General and Minister for Customs and Excise. He oversaw a number of reforms, establishing the Family Court of Australia, the Law Reform Commission, and the Australian Institute of Criminology, and developing the &quot;Family Law Act 1975&quot;, which fully established no-fault divorce. He also authorised the 1973 Murphy raids on ASIO. In 1975, following the death of Douglas Menzies, Murphy was appointed to the High Court. He is the most recent politician to be appointed to the court.

On the court, Murphy was known for his radicalism and judicial activism. However, his final years were marred by persistent allegations of corruption. He was convicted of perverting the course of justice in 1985, but had the conviction overturned on appeal and was acquitted at a second trial. In 1986, a commission was established to determine whether he was fit to remain on the court, but it was abandoned when Murphy announced that he was suffering from terminal cancer.

==Early life and education==
Murphy was the youngest of five sons, and sixth of seven children of William, a native of County Tipperary, and Lily Murphy. He was born and grew up in Sydney. Though the Murphy household was Irish Catholic, albeit estranged from the Church, Murphy became a humanist and rationalist.

He was educated at government schools in Sydney&#x27;s south-eastern suburbs, including Kensington Public School in Kensington, where he was dux after repeating his final year in 1935, and Sydney Boys High School from 1936 to 1940 in nearby Moore Park, graduating with A levels in English, Mathematics, and Chemistry and B levels in Physics and French. After completing his secondary education, in 1941, Murphy matriculated to the University of Sydney, though he had not been successful in gaining a university scholarship awarded to the top 100 in the state. His initial scholastic performance was ordinary and he briefly considered transferring to study a Bachelor of Arts majoring in psychology at the Faculty of Arts.

Murphy excelled in his final year, graduating from the School of Chemistry, Faculty of Science with a Bachelor of Science with Honours in Organic Chemistry. In 1943, he commenced working in the chemical industry, thereby coming under the authority of the wartime Manpower Directorate.

In 1945, Murphy commenced studying law at the Sydney Law School of the University of Sydney and, in 1949, graduated with a Bachelor of Laws with Honours. While at the University of Sydney, during both his science and law degrees, Murphy was politically and socially active and was involved in the Students&#x27; Chemistry Society, the Junior Science Association, and the Science Association.

In 1944, in his third year of his science degree, Murphy was elected to the Students&#x27; Representative Council but was dismissed two hours after his election victory, on a &quot;constitutional technicality&quot;. This event is said to have cemented his interest in politics and law, and he commenced participating in the university&#x27;s debating society and its monthly debates the following year.

==Legal career==
Unusually, two years prior to his graduating with and possessing a law degree, Murphy passed the Barristers&#x27; Admission Board examination and was admitted to the New South Wales Bar Association in 1947. After graduating from the University of Sydney Faculty of Law, Murphy took up residence in University Chambers, Phillip Street and then moved to the fourth floor of Wentworth Chambers. He rapidly established himself as a labour/industrial lawyer, representing left-wing unionists.

In 1960, he was appointed as a Queen&#x27;s Counsel.

==Parliamentary career==
Murphy was a member of the Australian Labor Party from an early age. In the Senate pre-selection convention in the Sydney Trades Hall in April 1960, he had the backing of Ray Gietzelt but lacked factional endorsement. However, he drew first position in addressing the delegates and won support with an impassioned but well-structured and infectiously optimistic seven-minute speech on the Labor Party&#x27;s historical commitment to civil liberties and human rights. He was elected to the Australian Senate in 1961, and, in 1967, he was elected Opposition Leader in the Senate.

===Attorney-Generalship===
In 1969, Labor Leader Gough Whitlam appointed him Shadow Attorney-General and, when Labor won the 1972 election, he became Attorney-General and Minister for Customs and Excise. One of Murphy&#x27;s more dramatic actions as Attorney-General was his sudden visit to the Melbourne headquarters of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) on 16 March 1973. This came about because ASIO officers were unable to satisfy his requests for information concerning intelligence on supposed terrorist groups operated by the Ustaše in Australia. Murphy&#x27;s concern about the matter was heightened by the impending visit to Australia of the Yugoslav Prime Minister Džemal Bijedić. ASIO officers claimed not to be able to locate the file with which to properly brief Murphy. Murphy&#x27;s belief was that, though a security service was an important part of the Australian social fabric, like any other arm of executive government it must be accountable to the relevant Minister. According to journalist George Negus, then Murphy&#x27;s press secretary: &quot;Lionel had asked for the files of the six most dangerous or subversive people in Australia&quot;. When the files arrived, Murphy found they were of several Communist Party (CPA) unionists and people such as CPA leader and peace movement activist Mavis Robertson. When he told Whitlam, they both laughed.

Murphy was highly involved in the behind-the-scenes machinations and parliamentary debates around the appointment of DLP Senator Vince Gair as Ambassador to Ireland in 1974 (see Gair Affair), which preceded Whitlam&#x27;s calling of a double dissolution election for May 1974.

Murphy&#x27;s most important legislative achievement was the &quot;Family Law Act 1975&quot;, which completely overhauled Australia&#x27;s law on divorce and other family law matters. It established the principle of &quot;no-fault divorce&quot;, in the face of opposition from the Roman Catholic Church and many other individuals and organisations. This act also established the Family Court of Australia.

===Civil Celebrants===
Murphy used an existing provision of the Marriage Act 1961 (Section 39C) to establish the Civil Marriage Celebrant programme. Using this provision he appointed about a hundred Civil Celebrants and urged them to provide marriage ceremonies of dignity, meaning and substance for non-church people. It was an initiative opposed by the Australian Labor Party, the public servants of his department and his personal staff. 
&quot;The civil celebrant program is almost entirely the result of one man’s vision. Murphy himself told me the story of how he was opposed by his own staff, the public service, his fellow Members of Parliament s and officials of the Labour Party. He defied all, and, on July 19, 1973, in the dead of night typed the first appointment himself, found the envelope and stamp, walked to a post box and posted it himself. Lois D’Arcy, carries the honour of being appointed the first genuinely independent civil celebrant in Australia, and actually in all the world.&quot;
Although it was a radical move at the time, the programme proved to be very successful. In 2015, 74.9 per cent of marrying couples in Australia chose a civil marriage celebrant to officiate. The programme broadened to include secular funerals of substance, namings and other ceremonies which celebrated the landmarks of human existence. Murphy took an enthusiastic interest in this programme - sending telegrams of congratulation to the first several hundred couples married by civil celebrants and would often unexpectedly turn up uninvited to weddings performed by celebrants to delight in his achievement.

===Human Rights Bill===

As Attorney-General, Murphy drew up a Human Rights Bill (which lapsed with the double dissolution of 1974) giving as among the reasons: &quot;in criminal law, our protections against detention for interrogation and unreasonable search and seizure, for access to counsel and to ensure the segregation of different categories of prisoners are inadequate. Australian laws on the powers of the police, the rights of an accused person and the state of the penal system generally are unsatisfactory. Our privacy laws are vague and ineffective. There are few effective constraints on the gathering of information, or its disclosure, or surveillance, against unwanted publicity by government, the media or commercial organisations&quot;. Murphy also introduced important legislation substantially abolishing appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, removing censorship, providing freedom of access to government information, reforming corporations and trade practices law, protecting the environment, abolishing the death penalty and outlawing racial and other discrimination.

Furthermore, Murphy established a systematic legal aid service for all courts, set up the Australian Law Reform Commission with Michael Kirby as its inaugural chairman and set up the Australian Institute of Criminology.

Murphy took the French Government to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to protest against its nuclear tests in the Pacific. The French government conducted 41 atmospheric nuclear tests at Mururoa after 1966 and formally ceased atmospheric nuclear testing in 1974 as a result of public pressure facilitated by Murphy&#x27;s ICJ case.

==Judicial career==

In February 1975, Whitlam appointed Murphy to a vacancy on the High Court of Australia. He was the first serving Labor politician appointed to the Court since Dr. H. V. Evatt in 1931 and the appointment was bitterly criticised. He resigned from the Senate on 9 February 1975 to take up the appointment. Murphy was the last High Court justice to have served as a Member of Parliament, and the last politician appointed to the High Court. Additionally, Murphy was one of only eight justices of the High Court to have served in the Parliament of Australia prior to his appointment to the Court, along with Edmund Barton, Richard O&#x27;Connor, Isaac Isaacs, H. B. Higgins, Edward McTiernan, John Latham, and Garfield Barwick.

Although it did not become a constitutional requirement until 1977, it had been long-standing convention that a Senate casual vacancy be filled by a person from the same political party. However, on 27 February 1975, the Premier of New South Wales, Tom Lewis, controversially appointed Cleaver Bunton, a person with no political affiliations, to replace Murphy in the Senate, beginning the chain of events which led to the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis. These events provided the impetus for the 1977 constitutional change that ensures such an appointment cannot be repeated, although a State Government can still achieve a similar result by declining to fill a Senate vacancy. Soon after his appointment to the bench, Murphy visited Justice Menzies&#x27; old chambers in Taylor Square, which would now be his. Staring at the volumes of British law reports on the shelves behind his desk, he said, &quot;I want all of these to go&quot;. He replaced them with decisions from the Supreme Court of the United States.

==Court cases and death==
In the summer of 1983/84, during the term of the first Hawke government, both &quot;The National Times&quot; and &quot;The Age &quot; published transcripts of telephone conversations illegally recorded from 1979 to 1981 by the New South Wales Police. Although not then authenticated, they were allegedly between Murphy and Sydney lawyer Morgan Ryan, who in 1982 faced charges of forgery and conspiracy.

In July 1985, Murphy was initially convicted on one of two charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice, over new allegations made by Clarrie Briese, the Chief Magistrate of New South Wales, that Murphy had attempted to influence a court case against Morgan Ryan, whom Murphy referred to as &quot;my little mate&quot;. A subsequent appeal to the NSW Court of Appeals quashed Murphy&#x27;s conviction on the grounds that the trial judge had misdirected the jury.

A second trial was then held and, on 28 April 1986, Murphy was found not guilty of attempting to pervert the course of justice. After his acquittal, Murphy said, &quot;Thank heavens for the jury system!&quot;. Despite being a well-educated judge, Murphy&#x27;s defence rested on an unsworn, or “dock statement” (typically used by those who are unable to communicate fluently, or represent themselves), which avoided the possibility of being cross-examined in court.

Due to the seriousness of the allegations, Attorney-General Lionel Bowen, acting on what he said was his belief that the Justices of the High Court were minded to take some independent action to assess Justice Murphy&#x27;s fitness to return to the Court, introduced legislation for a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry, consisting of three retired judges, to examine &quot;whether any conduct of the Honourable Lionel Keith Murphy has been such as to amount, in its opinion, to proved misbehaviour within the meaning of section 72 of the Constitution&quot;. (Section 72 specifies that a High Court judge may be removed only by the Governor-General and both houses of Parliament &quot;on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity&quot;.) The terms of this inquiry specifically excluded the issues for which Murphy had already been tried and acquitted.

The legislation establishing the Commission of Inquiry received assent in May 1986. In July, Murphy announced that he was dying of terminal cancer, and the establishing legislation was repealed. The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate were given control of the commission&#x27;s documents. Murphy returned to the Court for one week of sittings. He died on 21 October 1986.

==Personal life==
Murphy had a distinctive profile and a large nose that was broken in a 1950 car accident in England and left largely untreated.

In July 1954, he married Russian-born Nina Morrow (née Vishegorodsky; known as Svidersky), a comptometrist, at St John&#x27;s Church in Darlinghurst, Sydney. Their daughter, Lorel Katherine, was born in 1955. In 1967, Murphy&#x27;s marriage to Nina ended in divorce.

In 1969, Murphy married Ingrid Gee (née Grzonkowski), a model and television quiz-show compère who had been born in German-occupied Poland. They had two sons, Cameron and Blake. Cameron was President of the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties from 1999 to 2013. Ingrid died in October 2007.

In 2021, the ABC investigative series &quot;Exposed: The Ghost Train Fire&quot; aired an allegation, for which they provided no evidence, that Murphy and NSW Premier Neville Wran had conspired with organised crime figure Abe Saffron to help Saffron&#x27;s relatives obtain the Luna Park lease after the 1979 Sydney Ghost Train fire, which caused the deaths of six children and an adult.

==Legacy==

In addition to his work as a legislator, Murphy also took a lifelong interest in science, having first studied science, then law, at the University of Sydney. Justice Michael Kirby identified Murphy&#x27;s later scientific reading as &quot;a positive influence on his approach to jurisprudence&quot;.

===&quot;Lionel Murphy SNR&quot;===
N86 is a nitrogen-abundant supernova remnant (SNR) N86 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It was dubbed the &quot;Lionel-Murphy SNR&quot; by astronomers at the Australian National University&#x27;s Mount Stromlo Observatory in acknowledgement of Murphy&#x27;s interest in science and because of SNR N86&#x27;s perceived resemblance to a &quot;Canberra Times&quot; cartoonist&#x27;s depiction of his large nose (prior to surgery), and a picture was hung in his office.

A supernova remnant (SNR) results from the gigantic explosion of a star, the resulting supernova expelling much or all of the stellar material with velocities as much as 1% the speed of light and forming a shock wave that can heat the gas up to temperatures as high as 10 million K, forming a plasma.

Murphy normally rejected public honours (such as a knighthood) but accepted this because of the symbolic resemblance to his own impact on human rights in Australian law and its lasting significance as a &quot;signpost&quot; to space travellers. Murphy asked for a large mounted photo of SNR N86 from the scientific paper and placed it in his High Court chambers in the place where the other High Court justices usually hung a portrait of the Queen.

===Lionel Murphy Foundation===
The Lionel Murphy Foundation was co-founded by Gough Whitlam, Neville Wran, and Ray Gietzelt in 1986. It funds postgraduate scholarships for students who &quot;intend to pursue a postgraduate degree in science, law or legal studies, or other appropriate discipline&quot; with a commitment to social justice.

===Judicial philosophy and legacy===
Mary Gaudron, who herself would become a justice of the High Court, stated at Lionel Murphy&#x27;s Memorial Service at Sydney Town Hall:
&quot;There are so many words – reformist, radical, humanitarian, civil libertarian, egalitarian, democrat — they are all abstractions. My words are no better; but, for me, and perhaps for those of us who believe in justice based on practical equality, Lionel Murphy was – Lionel Murphy is – the electric light of the Law. He would take an ordinary old abstraction – like equal justice — he would expose it, he would illuminate the abstraction, he would make its form stark, and so he could then say as he did in &quot;McInnis&#x27; case&quot;, these words: &quot;Where the kind of trial a person receives depends on the amount of money he or she has, there is no equal justice&quot;&quot;.

Law professor Jack Goldring concluded that Murphy&#x27;s approach as a High Court judge was &quot;marked by a number of features: a strong nationalism conceding and welcoming the existence of States as political (albeit subsidiary) entities; a stalwart belief in democracy and parliamentary rule; a firm support for civil liberties; and overall a &#x27;constitutionalism&#x27; in the classical, liberal sense of seeing a constitution as not simply a legal document, but rather as a set of values shared by the community&quot;.

<text>Geoffrey Bond Lewis (July 31, 1935 – April 7, 2015) was an American actor. He appeared in more than 200 films and television shows, and was principally known for his film roles alongside Clint Eastwood and Robert Redford. He often portrayed villains or quirky characters.

==Life and career==
Lewis was born July 31, 1935, in Plainfield, New Jersey, but spent much of his youth in Wrightwood, California. He studied theater arts at San Bernardino Valley College for two years, then worked as a truck driver and at other odd jobs before launching his career as an actor. He took acting classes at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City and performed off-Broadway and at regional theaters in Massachusetts. He tried breaking into Hollywood in the 1960s.

Lewis appeared in TV series including &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Cannon,&quot; &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;Lou Grant&quot;, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, &quot;The A-Team&quot;, &quot;Titus&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;, &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;. In 1979, he appeared in &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;. He also played opposite Polly Holliday in the &quot;Alice&quot; spin-off &quot;Flo&quot; (1980–81) for which he received a Golden Globe nomination. He co-starred with Fred Dryer in &quot;Land&#x27;s End&quot; (1995–96).

His film credits include such movies as &quot;Down in the Valley&quot;, &quot;The Butcher&quot;, &quot;Maverick&quot;, and &quot;When Every Day Was the Fourth of July&quot;.

Lewis worked frequently with actor-director Clint Eastwood in several films, including &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot;, &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot;, &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot;, &quot;Bronco Billy&quot;, &quot;Every Which Way but Loose&quot;, &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot;, and &quot;High Plains Drifter&quot;.

In the 1980s, Lewis was also a member of musical storytelling group Celestial Navigations with musician and songwriter Geoff Levin.

==Personal life==
Lewis was married three times and had numerous children. News outlets variously reported that he had nine or ten surviving children. One of his children is actress Juliette Lewis with whom he acted in at least two films, &quot;Blueberry&quot; and &quot;The Way of the Gun&quot;. His other children include his daughters Brandy, Hannah and Dierdre Lewis and Emily Colombier; his sons Peter, Lightfield, Miles and Matthew; and nine grandchildren.

On April 7, 2015, he died of a heart attack at age 79. He had suffered the heart attack while working out at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital, according to his family. Miles Lewis told &quot;Variety&quot; he had been suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease and dementia.

<doc id="1051548" wikidata="Q4803084" url="?curid=1051548" title="As the Roots Undo">
<text>As the Roots Undo is the debut studio album by American screamo band Circle Takes the Square. It was released on CD and vinyl in 2004 by the Robotic Empire and HyperRealist labels respectively. The album would later see a repress on the LP format in 2014 through GatePost Recordings.

The album is a contender for the most celebrated screamo record. Noisey called it &quot;one of the most critically acclaimed cult classics in modern hardcore&quot; which has &quot;long garnered praise from both the press and fans alike for its forward-thinking blend of 90s screamo, fractured grindcore, and experimental post-rock.&quot; On June 11, 2010, Sputnikmusic placed it at number 3 on its list of the 100 best albums of the decade.

==Content and packaging==
The CD is packaged in a four-fold flap with artwork along each side; the artwork was done by band member Drew Speziale.

When asked about his influences at the time of writing &quot;As the Roots Undo&quot;, Drew Speziale referred to bands that were innovating punk and hardcore through incorporating a lot of melody, including their tour-mates Majority Rule, Pg. 99 and City of Caterpillar and bands who had &quot;really dark melodies going on underneath [an] overtly pretty brutal sound&quot; such as Orchid and His Hero Is Gone, besides less intense artists such as Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Modest Mouse and Built to Spill.

<text>Sheek Island is an island in the St. Lawrence River in the Canadian province of Ontario. It is considered to be one of Ontario&#x27;s Lost Villages, which were permanently flooded by the creation of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1958. While much of the island has been flooded, a portion of it remains above water, but is not populated.

Sheek Island was occupied primarily by family farms and recreational properties. In 1914, Levi Addison Ault donated a family property on the island to the Township of Cornwall, which became Ault Park. After the island was flooded by the Seaway project, Ault Park was rebuilt on the new shoreline near Long Sault.

From 1956 to 1958, archaeologists conducted excavations in Ault Park, and believed that they might have found remnants of a 3500-year old native village. The University of Toronto petitioned for an injunction against the Seaway project so that the excavations could continue, but they were not successful. A number of artifacts were taken from the site for further study.

<doc id="1051555" wikidata="Q7688" url="?curid=1051555" title="Raion">
<text>A raion (also spelt rayon) is a type of administrative unit of several post-Soviet states. The term is used for both a type of subnational entity and a division of a city. The word is from the French (meaning &#x27;honeycomb, department&#x27;), and is commonly translated as &#x27;district&#x27; in English.

A raion is a standardized administrative entity across most of the former Soviet Union and is usually a subdivision two steps below the national level, such as a subdivision of an oblast. However, in smaller USSR republics, it could be the primary level of administrative division. After the fall of the Soviet Union, some of the republics kept the &quot;raion&quot; (e.g. Azerbaijan, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan) while others dropped it (e.g. Georgia, Uzbekistan, Estonia, Latvia, Armenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan).

In Bulgaria, it refers to an internal administrative subdivision of a city not related to the administrative division of the country as a whole, or, in the case of Sofia municipality a subdivision of that municipality.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;raion&quot; is derived from French &quot;rayon&quot;, which is itself derived from Frankish *&quot;hrātu&quot; &#x27;honeycomb&#x27;. It is used in many languages spanning Central Europe to Central Asia and Siberia. For instance, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; and .

==List of countries with raion subdivisions==
Fourteen countries have or had entities that were named &quot;raion&quot; or the local version of it.
==History==

===Raions in the Soviet Union===
In the Soviet Union, raions were administrative divisions created in the 1920s to reduce the number of territorial divisions inherited from the Russian Empire and to simplify their bureaucracies. The process of conversion to the system of raions was called raionirovanie (&quot;regionalization&quot;). It was started in 1923 in the Urals, North Caucasus, and Siberia as a part of the Soviet administrative reform and continued through 1929, by which time the majority of the country&#x27;s territory was divided into raions instead of the old volosts and uyezds.

The concept of &quot;raionirovanie&quot; was met with resistance in some republics, especially in Ukraine, where local leaders objected to the concept of raions as being too centralized in nature and ignoring the local customs. This point of view was backed by the Soviet Russian People&#x27;s Commissariat of Nationalities. Nevertheless, eventually all of the territory of the Soviet Union was regionalized.

Soviet raions had self-governance in the form of an elected district council (&quot;raysovet&quot;) and were headed by the local head of administration, who was either elected or appointed.

===Raions outside the Soviet Union===

Following the model of the Soviet Union, raions were introduced in Bulgaria and Romania. In China the term is used in Uyghur in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

In Romania they have been later replaced.

===Raions after the dissolution of the Soviet Union===
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, raions as administrative units continue to be used in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine.

<text>Albert () is a commune in the Somme department in Hauts-de-France in northern France.

It is located about halfway between Amiens and Bapaume.

==History==
Albert was founded as a Roman outpost, in about 54 BC. After being known by various forms of the name of the local river, the Ancre, it was renamed to Albert after it passed to Charles d&#x27;Albert, duc de Luynes. It was a key location in the Battle of the Somme in World War I, and World War I tourism is important for the town.
During World War I, the statue of Mary and the infant Jesus – designed by sculptor Albert Roze and dubbed the &quot;Golden Virgin&quot; – on top of the Basilica of Our Lady of Brebières was hit by a shell on 15 January 1915 and slumped to a near-horizontal position, where however it remained until further shelling in 1918 destroyed the tower.

In his letters home to his wife, Rupert Inglis, who was a former rugby international and now a forces chaplain, described passing through Albert: &quot;We went through the place today (2 October 1915) where the Virgin Statue at the top of the Church was hit by a shell in January. The statue was knocked over, but has never fallen, I sent you a picture of it. It really is a wonderful sight. It is incomprehensible how it can have stayed there, but I think it is now lower than when the photograph was taken, and no doubt will come down with the next gale. The Church and village are wrecked, there&#x27;s a huge hole made by a Jack Johnson just outside the west door of the Church.&quot;

The German army recaptured the town in March 1918 during the Spring Offensive; the British, to prevent the Germans from using the church tower as a machine gun post, bombarded and destroyed the basilica. The statue fell in April 1918 and was never recovered.

Albert was completely reconstructed after the war, including widening and re-orienting the town&#x27;s main streets. The Basilica, however, was faithfully rebuilt according to its original design by Eduoard Duthoit, the son of the architect who had overseen its construction in 1885–1895. The present statue is an exact replica of Roze&#x27;s original design, and a war memorial designed by Roze and featuring an image of the &quot;Leaning Virgin&quot; can be seen in the &quot;Abri&quot; (Shelter) Museum, which houses souvenirs of the war. The underground shelters in which the museum is located served as protective bunkers for Albert&#x27;s residents during aerial bombardments in World War II.

The city appears in the short story &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;, by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. In the story it is the location of a British artillery park that the Germans are about to bomb during World War I.

The Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial is located only 9 kilometres from the village. It is a memorial site dedicated to Dominion of Newfoundland forces members who were killed during World War I. Officially opened by British field marshal Earl Haig in 1925, the memorial is one of only two National Historic Sites of Canada located outside of Canada.

==Liberation of Albert in World War II==

On September 1 1944, the 7th Battalion of the Green Howards were spearheading the Allied advance through northern France. After passing through Beauvais, Boves and Villers Bretonneux, the battalion arrived at Morlancourt at 2.30pm. Here they were intercepted by the Maquis who informed them of a strong enemy force in nearby Albert.

At 8pm, A and B Companies remained in reserve at Morlancourt, while C and D Companies advanced towards Albert. On arrival, near Becourt, the Carrier Platoon commander, Captain Murray divided his command, placing two sections on the Albert-Peronne road, while taking the other two sections with him to the Albert-Becourt track.

Soon after 10pm, loud explosions were heard in Albert and an hour later, enemy transport was heard approaching Becourt along the track. A German armoured car and a small scout car led a convoy of lorries that the British allowed to pass. The final lorry was closely followed by a tank and a half-track armoured vehicle, at which point the British opened fire. The tank stopped and returned fire while the half-track advanced to within ten metres of the British who threw grenades at it forcing it to withdraw. While reversing, the half-track was hit by a P.I.A.T. anti-tank grenade. It lost control and exploded. The Green Howards lost one carrier which was set on fire by the tank.

The men then took up a position flanking the track where they opened up with Bren guns on the convoy. As the Germans were travelling, in many cases, astride their vehicles, the heavy fusillade created a catastrophic number of casualties amongst the enemy.

When the firing stopped, Capt. Murray, accompanied by a sergeant and a corporal, advanced further down the track on foot when they encountered a seven man German patrol at point blank range. The three British soldiers promptly opened fire causing the Germans to flee into the nearby wood which was then bombarded with P.I.A.T. and mortars. 

On reconnoitering the wood the following morning, the British found between thirty and forty German vehicles, packed head to tail, all burnt out. There were many signs of a panicky retreat.

Meanwhile, the other two sections, under Sergeant Rawson on the Albert-Peronne Road, when they realised their road was not being used, came across to assist their comrades on the Becourt track. On approaching the wood, they were heavily fired on, and, when making a detour, ran into a German armoured vehicle. When two Germans approached them on foot, they killed one and wounded the other, an officer who was taken to Battalion Headquarters 

At 6am the following morning, the Battalion moved into Albert. There was no opposition and they moved freely through the town which came out to welcome the liberators. In the words of the Green Howard war diary that day, the Battalion had &quot;quite a celebration.&quot;

There is little doubt that Captain Murray&#x27;s decision to engage the enemy overnight, rather than wait until daylight, averted a potential disaster for the people of Albert. 

During the operation, which lasted for four hours and routed a far superior and better equipped enemy, the Green Howards lost two men, Sergeant Harland Matthews (27) and private Richard Westcott (19). 

For his courage, leadership and a very high standard of personal gallantry, Captain Murray was awarded the Military Cross. The full citation reads, &quot;During the whole of these operations, which lasted for more than four hours, Captain Murray displayed great powers of leadership and a very high standard of personal gallantry. He was a great inspiration to his men, who, during the night, inflicted many casualties on the enemy, and much destruction to his vehicles. The enemy were undoubtedly in considerable strength and in possession of a number of heavy weapons.&quot;

==Twin towns==
Albert is twinned with the British town of Ulverston in Cumbria.

The two towns regularly meet to play football at Easter with the Cyril Barker Shield being contested every year. Albert and Ulverston alternate the match&#x27;s venue.
Albert is also twinned with the German towns of Aldenhoven and Niesky. After the First World War, Albert was &quot;adopted&quot; by the English city of Birmingham, whose citizens funded a new almshouse building, and the main street is named Rue de Birmingham.

==Population==
==Notable residents==
The French operatic bass Xavier Depraz was born in Albert on 22 April 1926.

<doc id="1051577" wikidata="Q7532962" url="?curid=1051577" title="Six of the Best">
<text>Six of the Best was a reunion concert between the English rock band Genesis and their original frontman Peter Gabriel, with former guitarist Steve Hackett joining the band for the two encores. The one-off event took place on 2 October 1982 at the Milton Keynes Bowl, England, and staged as a benefit to raise funds for Gabriel who faced considerable financial debts after the first WOMAD festival. It was the only time Gabriel and Hackett have performed with the band since their departures in 1975 and 1977, respectively.

==Background==

The &quot;classic&quot; line-up of Genesis featured frontman Peter Gabriel, bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford, keyboardist Tony Banks, drummer Phil Collins, and guitarist Steve Hackett. After Gabriel left the band to pursue a solo career in 1975, Hackett followed suit in 1977, leaving Genesis as a core trio of Banks, Rutherford, and Collins, who took over from Gabriel as lead vocalist on subsequent albums and live shows. 

The concert originated after Gabriel helped to stage the first World of Music, Arts and Dance (WOMAD) festival, held in Shepton Mallet, England in July 1982. Although an artistic success it was a commercial failure for several reasons including poor weather, a national rail strike affecting transport to the venue, and a lack of publicity and understanding surrounding the world music event that led to poor ticket sales. The venture left Gabriel in considerable financial hardship with debts as high as £200,000, and received &quot;a lot of nasty phone calls and a death threat.&quot; The dire situation was helped when Gabriel&#x27;s manager Tony Smith, who also managed Genesis, suggested a one-off reunion concert as a benefit to raise funds for Gabriel. Genesis were on the road with the &quot;Three Sides Live&quot; tour at this time, and therefore had the necessary staging and equipment to put on the show. The tour finished with three nights at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Odeon between 28–30 September, during which the band rehearsed a revised setlist with Gabriel. Hackett, who was recording in Brazil, got the invite to perform and quickly flew to London to join the band in Hammersmith for rehearsals, flying mostly overnight. He was keen to have done more with the band, but was asked to only play on the two encores.

==The concert==
The show took place on 2 October, which was also Rutherford&#x27;s 32nd birthday, to an estimated 40,000 people. Tickets were sold at £9 for advance purchases and £10 for people arriving on the day. The show opened with fellow Charisma Records artists John Martyn, The Blues Band, and Talk Talk, the latter were faced with a hostile reaction from the crowd and cans and bottles were thrown towards the stage during their set. Genesis were introduced by Jonathan King, who named the band in 1967 and supervised the recording of their first album. Gabriel entered the stage in a coffin carried to the stage by four pallbearers, a stunt that was not known by the group prior to the show.

In 2015, Rutherford expressed his regret that the concert had not been recorded or filmed. Several audience recordings of the show have been released.

<doc id="1051589" wikidata="Q1322820" url="?curid=1051589" title="Pyraminx">
<text>The Pyraminx () is a regular tetrahedron puzzle in the style of Rubik&#x27;s Cube. It was made and patented by Uwe Mèffert after the original 3 layered Rubik&#x27;s Cube by Ernő Rubik, and introduced by Tomy Toys of Japan (then the 3rd largest toy company in the world) in 1981.

== Optimal solutions ==

The maximum number of twists required to solve the Pyraminx is 11. There are 933,120 different positions (disregarding the trivial rotation of the tips), a number that is sufficiently small to allow a computer search for optimal solutions. The table below summarizes the result of such a search, stating the number &quot;p&quot; of positions that require &quot;n&quot; twists to solve the Pyraminx:

== Records ==

The world record single solve is 0.73 seconds, set by Simon Kellum of the United States at Middleton Meetup Thursday 2023. The world record average of five solves (excluding fastest and slowest) is 1.15 seconds, set by Sebastian Lee of Australia at Maitland Spring 2024.

=== Top 5 solvers by single solve===
=== Top 5 solvers by Olympic average of 5 solves===
== Methods ==

There are many methods for solving a Pyraminx. They can be split up into two main groups.

1) V First Methods - In these methods, two or three edges are solved first, and a set of algorithms, also called LL (last layer) algorithms, are used to solve the remainder of the puzzle.

2) Top First Methods- In these methods, three edges around a center piece are solved first, and the remainder of the puzzle is solved using a set of algorithms.

Common V first methods-

a) Layer by Layer - In this method, a face with all edges permuted is solved, and then the remaining puzzle is solved by a single algorithm from a set of 5.

b) Algorithmic L4E and Intuitive L4E - L4E or last 4 edges is somewhat similar to Layer by Layer. The only difference is that only two edges are solved around three centers. Both of these methods solve the last four edges in the same step, hence the name. The difference is that Intuitive L4E requires a lot of visualization and &quot;intuition&quot; to solve the last four edges while algorithmic L4E uses algorithms. Algorithmic L4E is generally used more at higher levels, although there are very fast Intuitive L4E users. It is also easy to transition between Intuitive L4E and Algorithmic L4E.

Common top first methods-

a) One Flip - This method uses two edges around one center solved and the third edge flipped. There are a total of six cases after this step, for which algorithms are memorized and executed. The third step involves using a common set of algorithms for all top first methods, also called Keyhole last layer, which involves 5 algorithms, four of them being the mirrors of each other.

b) Keyhole - This method uses two edges in the right place around one center, and the third edge placed elsewhere on the puzzle. The centers of the fourth color are then solved using the slot formed by the non-permuted edge. The last step is solved using Keyhole last layer algorithms.

c) OKA - In this method, one edge is oriented around two edges in the wrong place, but one of the edges that is in the wrong place belongs to the block itself. The last edge is found on the bottom layer, and a very simple algorithm is executed to get it in the right place, followed by keyhole last layer algorithms.

Some other common top first methods are WO and Nutella.

Many top Pyraminx speedsolvers only use V-first methods, as top-first methods are extremely clunky and outdated due to hardware.

==Variations==

There are several variations of the puzzle. The simplest, Tetraminx, is equivalent to the (3x) Pyraminx but without the tips (see photo), resembling a truncated tetrahedron. There also exist &quot;higher-order&quot; versions, such as the 4x Master Pyraminx (see photos) and the 5x Professor&#x27;s Pyraminx.

The Master Pyraminx has 4 layers and 16 triangles-per-face (compared to 3 layers and 9 triangles-per-face of the original), and is based on the Skewb Diamond mechanism. This version has about 2.6817 × 1015 combinations. The Master Pyraminx has
* 4 &quot;tips&quot; (same as the original Pyraminx)
* 4 &quot;middle axials&quot; (same as the original Pyraminx)
* 4 &quot;centers&quot; (similar to Rubik&#x27;s Cube, none in the original Pyraminx)
* 6 &quot;inner edges&quot; (similar to Rubik&#x27;s Cube, none in the original Pyraminx)
* 12 &quot;outer edges&quot; (2-times more than the 6 of the original Pyraminx)
In summary, the Master Pyraminx has 30 &quot;manipulable&quot; pieces. However, like the original, 8 of the pieces (the tips and middle axials) are fixed in position (relative to each other) and can only be rotated in place. Also, the 4 centers are fixed in position and can only rotate (like the Rubik&#x27;s Cube). So there are only 18 (30-8-4) &quot;truly movable&quot; pieces; since this is 10% &quot;fewer&quot; than the 20 &quot;truly movable&quot; pieces of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube, it should be no surprise that the Master Pyraminx has about 10,000-times &quot;fewer&quot; combinations than a Rubik&#x27;s Cube (43 quintilion in the short scale or 43 trilion in the long scale). The Master Pyraminx can be solved in numerous ways: one is layer by layer like the original one or reducing it to a Jing pyraminx.

<text>USS &quot;Picuda&quot; (SS-382), a , was originally named Obispo, making her the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the obispo, a spotted sting ray.

==Construction and launching==
&quot;Obispo&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, on 15 March 1943. She was launched on 12 July 1943 sponsored by Mrs. Robert H. English. On 24 September 1943, she was renamed &quot;Picuda&quot;, making her the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the picuda, a great barracuda, up to long, of the Caribbean Sea and the tropical western Atlantic Ocean, known for its ferocious voracity. She was commissioned on 16 October 1943.

&quot;Picuda&quot; remained in the Portsmouth Navy Yard to complete fitting out until 18 November 1943, when she commenced underway trials. She completed torpedo tube trials off Newport, Rhode Island from 14 December through 16 December 1943, and she shifted to the submarine base at New London, Connecticut, for final training exercises. She put to sea from New London on 1 January 1944, reported for duty with the United States Pacific Fleet at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, on 13 January 1944, arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 27 January 1944, and joined the Pacific Fleet Submarine Force as a unit of Submarine Division 201, Submarine Squadron 20.

==Pacific War==
&quot;Picuda&quot; got underway from Pearl Harbor for her first war patrol on 17 February, setting course for waters off the Caroline Islands, and entering her designated patrol area on 29 February. In an area not far from Truk, she sank 2,672-ton ex-gunboat &quot;Shinyo Maru&quot; on 2 March, going deep to evade a string of 15 depth charges dropped by searching corvettes. On 18 March, &quot;Picuda&quot; changed course to patrol along the Saipan-Palau shipping lanes. She scored hits on a large enemy tanker that afternoon but was held down by two destroyers while the target escaped. She was off Yap Island a few minutes after midnight of 19 March, and sank 1,504-ton cargo ship &quot;Hoko Maru&quot; with two torpedoes.

Eleven days later she closed two cargo ship under escort of two destroyers off the west coast of Yap Island and let go five torpedoes at the largest merchantman. The first hit stopped the target dead in the water and a second torpedo tore off the port quarter capsized the 5,873-ton cargo ship &quot;Atlantic Maru&quot;. Two destroyers came down the torpedo tracks to hover over &quot;Picuda&quot; and she was shaken by 26 exploding depth charges before she escaped. With only one torpedo worth firing she returned to Midway Island on 5 April. Upon completion of her refit, she took aboard student officers and men for indoctrination training exercises off Midway, from 28 to 30 April. Three days later she formed a wolf-pack with submarines and .

&quot;Picuda&quot; put to sea from Midway with the wolf-pack 4 May to conduct her second war patrol in waters off Formosa. On 22 May, she sent four bow shots streaking to sink 1,200-ton river gunboat &quot;Hashidate&quot;. She also severely damaged 3,172-ton cargo ship &quot;Tsukauba Maru&quot; with the same salvo. The latter enemy was polished off by land-based aircraft from the United States Army Air Corps the following day. On 2 June, &quot;Picuda&quot; closed a convoy of twelve ships hugging the coast of Formosa. After sending her contact report to the other submarines of her wolf-pack, she slipped between two of the three leading escorts and pressed home an attack on a large tanker. Three hits were heard as all escorts made for &quot;Picuda&quot;. She maneuvered clear and sustained no damage from the many depth charges which exploded on all sides and above from eight enemy vessels during the next hour. She continued to patrol the Formosa coast until 4 June then passed off Batan Island and eastward of the Nansei Shoto to a point northward of Chichi Jima by 14 June. Two days later she pointed her bow for Midway where she arrived 22 June. She put to sea the next day to arrive at Pearl Harbor 27 June. After the end of the second war patrol, Raborn was replaced as skipper of &quot;Picuda&quot; by Commander Glynn R. Donaho.

&quot;Picuda&quot;, in wolf-pack with sister ships and , departed Pearl Harbor for her third war patrol 23 July in waters of the Luzon Strait between Formosa and Luzon. On 25 August, &quot;Picuda&quot; spotted ten ships hugging the coast some off the beach of Luzon. Slipping past five escorts, and with three enemy patrol planes overhead, she fired six torpedoes to sink 1,943-ton tanker &quot;Kotoku Maru&quot;, and then sank the 1,270 ton pursuing . &quot;Picuda&quot; probed deeper in the interior of Luzon Strait on 16 September, for a bold daylight attack on an eight-ship convoy, guarded by three destroyers and air cover. She sank 5,975-ton cargo ship &quot;Tokushima Maru&quot; and scored hits for unknown damage to two other cargo ships. Searching the southern border of her assigned patrol area, &quot;Picuda&quot; found another convoy hugging the north coast of Luzon on 21 September and sank the 1,948-ton cargo ship &quot;Awaji Maru&quot;. &quot;Picuda&quot; made rendezvous with and , then set course in company with these two submarines to terminate her third war patrol in the lagoon of Majuro Atoll on 3 October.

At Majuro, &quot;Picuda,&quot; now commanded by Evan T. Shepard, her final wartime skipper, formed a new wolf-pack with &quot;Queenfish&quot; and &quot;Barb&quot;, and departed 27 October. Topping off with fuel at Saipan, 1 November and 2 November, the wolf pack set course to range over the northern waters of the East China Sea, westward of Kyūshū. &quot;Picuda&quot; sank the 9,433-ton passenger-cargo ship &quot;Mayasan Maru&quot; on 17 November in the area southwest of Nagasaki. On 23 November, closing a convoy off the Korean Archipelago and stealing between two lead escorts, &quot;Picuda&quot; sank 6,933-ton cargo ship &quot;Shuyo Maru&quot; and 5,296-ton passenger-cargo ship &quot;Fukuju Maru&quot;. She departed her patrol area six days later and returned from her fourth patrol to moor in Apra Harbor, Guam, on 2 December.

On 29 December, &quot;Picuda&quot; put to sea for her fifth war patrol in the Formosa Straits and the East China Sea off the east coast of China from Shanghai to Kam Kit. On 7 January 1945, &quot;Picuda&quot; received a contact report from &quot;Barb&quot; and closed a convoy in the straits of Formosa to inflict severe damage with four torpedo hits on 10,045-ton tanker &quot;Munakata Maru&quot;. On the afternoon of 8 January, she again received a convoy contact report from &quot;Barb&quot; and slipped between two escorts of the starboard screen about four hours before midnight to pick out two large passenger-cargo ships. Three bow tubes fired at each target resulted in one hit on each. She swung and fired stern shots at a tanker, then discovered an escort dead ahead, range, and was forced to clear the area. The 2,854-ton coastal tanker &quot;Hikoshima Maru&quot;, hit by both &quot;Picuda&quot; and &quot;Barb&quot;, was disabled and ran aground. The cargo ship &quot;Meiho Maru&quot; had a similar experience, and severe damage was inflicted on 6,600-ton cargo ship &quot;Hisagawa Maru&quot; as well as 6,516-ton coastal tanker &quot;Manju Maru&quot;. &quot;Picuda&quot; having flashed a contact report as she cleared the area, set course for lifeguard station in support of the Third Fleet airstrikes on Formosa. In the early morning darkness of 29 January, &quot;Picuda&quot; made out at least three large ships in the rain and commenced tracking. The rain slacked as she approached dead ahead of a troop transport, overlapped by a cargo ship. One hit on the transport and two hits on the cargo ship were observed by &quot;Picuda&quot;&#x27;s officer of the deck. The transport, almost dead in the water, commenced shrill whistle blasts and the mist dropped down to reveal the cargo ship enveloped in a huge cloud of steam and smoke. An enemy float plane forced &quot;Picuda&quot; to abandon the attack. The victim sunk in this attack was the 5,497-ton passenger-cargo ship &quot;Clyde Maru&quot;. &quot;Picuda&quot; reached Tanapag Harbor, Saipan 5–6 February and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 15 February.

&quot;Picuda&quot; spent much of her sixth war patrol on lifeguard station off the coast of China. She got underway from Pearl Harbor 15 March and cleared the replenishment base of Apra Harbor, Guam on 29 March. She entered her patrol area off Kii Suido on 2 April for uneventful lifeguard duty in support of B-29 Superfortress strikes. On 6 May, &quot;Picuda&quot; made rendezvous with sister ship off the Nansei Shoto and received five crewmen from an Army B-29 bomber and debarked these survivors at Tanapag Harbor on 10 May, transferring them to the Headquarters of the Twenty-First Bomber Command. After voyage repairs alongside submarine tender , she departed 11 May for the East Coast of the United States. She stopped at Pearl Harbor, San Francisco, California, and transited the Panama Canal to arrive at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Kittery, Maine, on 22 June.

&quot;Picuda&quot; received six battle stars for World War II service.

==Post-war==
&quot;Picuda&quot; was assigned to Submarine Division 201, Squadron 20, US Atlantic Fleet. She remained in the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for major overhaul until 18 October. She shifted to the Submarine Base at New London on 31 October for duty as a training ship for the Submarine School. &quot;Picuda&quot; put to sea from New London 12 November for a training cruise which included visits to Key West, Florida, and Havana, Cuba. Upon her return to New London, 26 November, she was assigned to the New London Group of 16 November (Inactive) Fleet. She shifted to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on 12 December to commence preservation incidental to being placed in inactive status. On 15 January 1946, &quot;Picuda&quot; was ordered to cease inactivation and report to the Second Fleet for duty as a unit of Submarine Division 81, Squadron 8, US Atlantic Fleet.

&quot;Picuda&quot; prepared for active service in the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard until 18 February and shifted to the Submarine Base at New London the next day. In company with five other submarines of the New London Group, she cleared that base 25 February for a tour of duty out of the Submarine Base at Balboa, Panama, returning by way of St. Thomas, to New London on 27 March. &quot;Picuda&quot; again entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for inactivation on 27 March and was towed by a fleet tug to New London on 19 September 1946. She was placed out of commission, in reserve 25 September 1946.

&quot;Picuda&quot; was assigned to the New London Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet until late in the year 1952 when she was towed to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for snorkel conversion. She recommissioned 19 June 1953, Lieutenant Commander Ted N. Swain. Her conversion was complete by 24 August, and she shifted to the Submarine Base at New London. She reported for duty to Submarine Division 122, Squadron 12, US Atlantic Fleet.

&quot;Picuda&quot; steamed by way of Norfolk, Virginia, and Nassau, Bahamas, to arrive at Key West, Florida, on 17 September. She was assigned to duty as a training ship for Submarine Refit Training Group and based her operations for that command at Key West through September 1959. This duty included almost daily exercises in the Key West operating area, visits to American ports on the Gulf of Mexico, and periodic training cruises to the waters of Cuba, Jamaica and Haiti. This service was intervened by special cruises from Key West and two tours of duty in the Mediterranean Sea. On her first special cruise, she operated off Norfolk from 24 April to 20 May 1954, participating in anti-submarine development exercises. On her second special cruise, she cleared Key West on 3 September and set course for waters of Northern Europe and the Mediterranean. She arrived at Londonderry Port, Northern Ireland, on 24 September for joint maneuvers with ships of the Royal Navy, then arrived at Gibraltar on 29 October to join units of the Sixth Fleet for Operation &quot;Bright Bonfire.&quot; She returned to Londonderry Port 14 November to resume hunter-killer and other anti-submarine warfare tactics with units of the British Fleet, and cleared that port 25 November to resume her training duties at Key West, 11 December. She again sailed from Key West 6 January 1958 and arrived at Gibraltar 18 January. Her tour with the Sixth Fleet included participation in operation &quot;ASCENDEX&quot; and visits to the ports of Palma and Barcelona, Spain; Port de Monaco; and Genoa, Italy. She sailed from Gibraltar on 18 August and conducted hunter-killer exercises with destroyers in waters off Cuba and Jamaica before returning to Key West 11 October.

&quot;Picuda&quot; underwent overhaul in the Charleston Naval Shipyard from 13 October 1958 to 12 March 1959, followed by a brief period of refresher training in the New London, Connecticut–Newport, Rhode Island, area. She resumed her former duties at Key West on 27 March 1959 and put to sea from that port 1 June for her third Mediterranean tour. She touched at Norfolk 4 June and reached Gibraltar on 15 June. Operations in the Mediterranean during this tour included visits to Naples and Genoa, Italy; Marseilles, France; and Lisbon, Portugal. She departed the latter port 26 August to resume training duties at Key West, Florida.

&quot;Picuda&quot; was brought to Pensacola, Florida during the 50th Anniversary of Naval Aviation and people were allowed to board her to see inside.

In 1961, &quot;Picuda&quot; visited Guantanamo Bay and underwent a five-month overhaul at Charleston Naval Shipyard. In 1962, &quot;Picuda&quot; visited Guantanamo Bay twice before circumnavigating South America, conducting joint operations with Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Peru. This operation was terminated due to the Cuban Missile Crisis, and &quot;Picuda&quot; proceeded to Key West, Florida. &quot;Picuda&quot; spent most of 1963 operating out of her homeport of Key West making one trip to Guantanamo Bay.

In 1964, &quot;Picuda&quot; operated out of Key West in the Atlantic and Caribbean, winding up the year with an overhaul in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. &quot;Picuda&quot; made another visit to Guantanamo Bay in 1965. She began 1966 with a three-month Mediterranean tour with the Sixth Fleet, participating in fleet ASW exercises and NATO exercises with French and Italian naval forces. She wound up the year with another visit to Guantanamo Bay.

In the 1967 North Atlantic NATO operation &quot;Quick Pursuit,&quot; &quot;Picuda&quot; lost two men at sea (Lieutenant (junior grade) Jerry R. Alexander and Chief Torpedomans Mate Robert E. Small). She visited Bergen, Norway and Portsmouth, England before returning to Key West.

At the time of her decommissioning, &quot;Picuda&quot; held the record for being the longest serving submarine in the history of the US Navy. She had served 28 years, 11 months and 15 days. The previous record holder was .

==Spanish Navy service==
Transferred to Spain on 1 October 1972, former &quot;Picuda&quot; was renamed . The submarine was stricken from the US Navy Naval Vessel Register on 1 November 1974 and was purchased outright by Spain on 18 November 1974. In 1975, she was laid up with mechanical defects and finally deleted from the &quot;Armada Española&quot; on 30 April 1977, her name being shifted to former ex-&quot;Jallao&quot; (SS-368), which the Spanish had acquired.

Noriko Sakai was born in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. She made her debut as an idol singer in 1986.

Sakai released her first single, on February 5, 1987, nine days short of her sixteenth birthday. Over 40,000 copies of the single were sold. In the early years of her career, she used the nickname , although around the mid-1990s she started to distance herself from it.

She ventured overseas in the 1990s to Taiwan to shoot VITALON P beverage commercials, as well as holding concerts which received praise.

Sakai returned to the public attention after 1993, where she received recognition for her acting in &quot;Hitotsu Yane no Shita&quot; as Kashiwagi Koyuki. In 1995, she acted in &quot;Hoshi no Kinka&quot; (Heaven&#x27;s Coins) as Aya Kuramoto, also singing the theme song which became her best selling album to date.

By the end of 1998 she organized the Asian concert tours throughout Taiwan, mainland China, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and other countries in the regions.

===Personal life===
On December 28, 1998, she suddenly held a press conference, announcing her marriage to . She and Yūichi have one son, born on July 17, 1999.

===Return to the entertainment industry===
In January 2000, after the birth of her son, Sakai made a comeback to showbiz, and gradually took on roles in movies, drama and advertising. In 2003 she starred in honor film Ju-On: The Grudge 2 as Kyoko Harase. Sakai&#x27;s popularity in Japan is not outstanding, but she has considerable supporters in Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China.

=== Drug scandal ===
Sakai re-emerged in the headlines for a drug scandal on August 2, 2009, when Sakai&#x27;s husband, Yūichi Takasō allegedly inhaled a small amount of stimulant drugs in a public lavatory, at a park in Tokyo&#x27;s Minato Ward. The next day, Takasō&#x27;s car, parked on a street in Tokyo&#x27;s Shibuya Ward, was searched. In the car, 0.817 grams of stimulant drugs were found. On August 4, 2009, Takasō was stopped by Tokyo Metropolitan Police while walking in public in Shibuya. When Takasō was subjected to a body search, stimulant drugs were reportedly found in his underwear. Takasō was immediately placed under arrest. Sakai was summoned to the scene of the arrest. She was asked to go to the police station for further questions and to submit to a urine test. Instead, she told the police she had to pick her 10-year-old son up, and that she would go to the police station later that day. Sakai later disappeared with her son.

While Takasō was being questioned at the police department, he reportedly told the police he and Sakai were involved in drugs. As early as ten days prior to his arrest, the two of them used drugs while on a family trip to Amami Ōshima in Kagoshima Prefecture. At the time of Takasō&#x27;s arrest, Sakai was living in her own apartment in Tokyo. While Sakai was away, the police searched Sakai&#x27;s home, and reportedly found 0.008 grams of stimulant drugs, carefully wrapped in aluminum foil. An inhaler among the drugs was discovered to have Sakai&#x27;s DNA. As a result, a warrant was issued for her arrest. On August 5, 2009, Sakai dropped her son off with an unnamed friend, purchased some underwear and other necessities from a store, and then disappeared.

Attempting to track Sakai down by cell phone, the police reported that her cell phone lost signal within the area of Yamanashi Prefecture, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) west of Tokyo. Sakai later claimed that the cell phone was damaged, and that she threw the phone away. The police believed that the cell phone may have contained information leading to the source of the stimulant drugs.

On August 7, 2009, Sakai turned herself in to the authorities, and then was placed under arrest. The official charge against Sakai was &quot;suspicion of possessing stimulant drugs,&quot; according to a Tokyo police official. She admitted to the drugs being in her apartment, but did not admit to taking the drugs herself. She also said she kept the drugs in foil &quot;to use them later.&quot;

On August 17, 2009, a beach house in Katsuura, Chiba was also searched. A frequent location for both Sakai and Takasō the past five years, 0.097 grams of amphetamines and paraphernalia were found in the house. On August 21, 2009, after admitting to the drugs found in the beach house, Takasō was served with a second charge for possession of stimulant drugs.

==== Drug testing and indictment ====
On August 9, 2009 – two days after Sakai&#x27;s arrest, a urine test result came up negative. Light use of methamphetamine can only be detected in a urine test within one to four days after use. On August 19, 2009, investigators announced that Sakai&#x27;s hair tested positive for the stimulant drug, although the results were weak. Before Sakai was caught, she reportedly dyed and cut her hair; both practices would affect the testing results. Because of the positive result in the hair test, Sakai&#x27;s jail time was extended another nine days – until August 28, 2009.

On the final day of Sakai&#x27;s detention, prosecutors officially indicted Sakai for alleged amphetamine possession, based on the evidence collected by the police. The fact that the drugs were carefully wrapped for later use was a deciding factor in the verdict. On September 10, 2009, an additional charge of stimulant drug use was added. Sakai allegedly used amphetamines at a hotel during her Kagoshima Prefecture visit with her husband and son.

Sakai was released from jail after posting bail on September 17, 2009. Accompanied by her attorney, and with Sun Music Vice President Masahisa Aizawa in attendance, she apologized to the public during a press conference. &quot;My weakness caused me to give in to illegal drugs and caused grief to many people. I pledge to repent and atone for this crime for the rest of my life,&quot; she said. Sakai was checked into a hospital to overcome her drug habit, and asked for restraint from the media during her recovery.

Sakai&#x27;s first court date was held on October 26, 2009 – drawing a crowd of 6,600 people outside of a Tokyo courthouse. Sakai pleaded guilty to drug use. Prosecutors suggested eighteen months in prison for Sakai, but on November 9, 2009, the court delayed the jail term to November 9, 2012, as long as she stays crime-free. Sakai attended the University of Creation; Art, Music &amp; Social Work in Takasaki, Gunma, where she received her degree in welfare and nursing care in March 2013.

==== Reactions ====
The drug scandal cost Sakai billions of yen in canceled contracts and other endeavors she was involved in prior. On August 6, 2009, car manufacturer Toyota reportedly stopped showing a commercial, featuring Sakai, on its web site. Sakai&#x27;s clothing line &quot;PP rikorino&quot;, consisting of over 150 items were pulled from stores throughout Japan.

During the first week of the scandal, Apple Inc&#x27;s iTunes Store rated Sakai&#x27;s 1995 song &quot;Aoi Usagi&quot; the number one downloaded song, based on an eleven-day period. Other Sakai songs among the top 100 downloads include &quot;Kagami no Doresu&quot; (17th) and &quot;Sekaijū no Dare Yori Kitto&quot; (18th). However, on August 9, 2009, Victor Entertainment, the distributor of Sakai&#x27;s works, withdrew Sakai&#x27;s CDs from stores, and suspended downloads of her songs. Online stores such as Amazon Japan still sold Sakai&#x27;s CDs and DVDs, despite increasing the selling prices as a result of Victor&#x27;s move. In more recent years Victor Entertainment has reversed its decision and redistributed her work.

Immediately after the indictment announcement, Sun Music, the talent agency who has represented Sakai since 1986, suspended her contract and removed her official website from its server. The agency&#x27;s president Masahisa Aizawa said, &quot;We apologize from the bottom of our hearts for the alleged misdeeds of Ms. Sakai.&quot; Soon after Aizawa&#x27;s announcement, he was demoted to vice-president. Chairman Hideyoshi Aizawa removed himself from the position, and is now an adviser to Sun Music, with no right to represent the firm.

In the aftermath of the scandal, Sakai divorced her husband Takasō on July 31, 2010.

=== Second return to the entertainment industry ===
In April 2011, Sakai participated in a tour around Beijing to educate the hazards of drug addiction. She claimed that she would temporarily set aside her entertainment career to partake in charity organizations.

At a news conference on November 24, 2012, Sakai announced her return to the entertainment industry, after finishing her suspended sentence that ended earlier Friday. Sakai also signed on with talent agency Office Nigun Niiba. She returned to the stage in December 2012 as the main character in a story about the Sengoku period, ending December 25, 2012. In all, 7,500 people attended the stage performance during the ten-day period.

In October 2021, Sakai re-recorded &quot;Aoi Usagi&quot; and placed an NFT of it and promo photos on auction to promote the fourth season of the drama series &quot;Producer K&quot;, which marked her first drama appearance in eight years.

<doc id="1051609" wikidata="Q2106574" url="?curid=1051609" title="Pott's fracture">
<text>Pott&#x27;s fracture, also known as Pott&#x27;s syndrome I and Dupuytren fracture, is an archaic term loosely applied to a variety of bimalleolar ankle fractures. The injury is caused by a combined abduction external rotation from an eversion force. This action strains the sturdy medial (deltoid) ligament of the ankle, often tearing off the medial malleolus due to its strong attachment. The talus then moves laterally, shearing off the lateral malleolus or, more commonly, breaking the fibula superior to the tibiofibular syndesmosis. If the tibia is carried anteriorly, the posterior margin of the distal end of the tibia is also sheared off by the talus. A fractured fibula in addition to detaching the medial malleolus will tear the tibiofibular syndesmosis. The combined fracture of the medial malleolus, lateral malleolus, and the posterior margin of the distal end of the tibia is known as a &quot;trimalleolar fracture&quot;.

An example of Pott&#x27;s fracture would be in a sports tackling injury. The player receives a blow to the outside of the ankle, causing the ankle to roll inwards (so that the sole of the foot faces laterally). This damages the ligaments on the inside of the ankle and fractures the fibula at the point of contact (usually just above the tibiofibular syndesmosis). A better way to visualize this is the two hands of a clock, with one hand facing 12 and the other facing 6. The vertical line they form represents the fibula of the person&#x27;s right leg. The lateral force approaches from 3 o&#x27;clock, sending the lower hand snapping outwards to point at 5 o&#x27;clock.

Bimalleolar fractures are less likely to result in arthritis than trimalleolar fractures.

==History==
English physician Percivall Pott experienced this injury in 1765 and described his clinical findings in a paper published in 1769.

The term &quot;Dupuytren fracture&quot; refers to the same mechanism, and it is named for Guillaume Dupuytren. Pott did not describe disruption of the tibio-fibular ligament, whereas Dupuytren did.

<doc id="1051627" wikidata="Q721695" url="?curid=1051627" title="Szemerédi–Trotter theorem">
<text>The Szemerédi–Trotter theorem is a mathematical result in the field of Discrete geometry. It asserts that given points and lines in the Euclidean plane, the number of incidences (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the number of point-line pairs, such that the point lies on the line) is

formula_1

This bound cannot be improved, except in terms of the implicit constants in its big O notation. An equivalent formulation of the theorem is the following. Given points and an integer , the number of lines which pass through at least of the points is

formula_2

The original proof of Endre Szemerédi and William T. Trotter was somewhat complicated, using a combinatorial technique known as &quot;cell decomposition&quot;. Later, László Székely discovered a much simpler proof using the crossing number inequality for graphs. This method has been used to produce the explicit upper bound formula_3 on the number of incidences. Subsequent research has lowered the constant, coming from the crossing lemma, from 2.5 to 2.44. On the other hand, this bound would not remain valid if one replaces the coefficient 2.44 with 0.42.

The Szemerédi–Trotter theorem has a number of consequences, including Beck&#x27;s theorem in incidence geometry and the Erdős-Szemerédi sum-product problem in additive combinatorics.

== Proof of the first formulation ==
We may discard the lines which contain two or fewer of the points, as they can contribute at most incidences to the total number. Thus we may assume that every line contains at least three of the points.

If a line contains points, then it will contain line segments which connect two consecutive points along the line. Because after discarding the two-point lines, it follows that , so the number of these line segments on each line is at least half the number of incidences on that line. Summing over all of the lines, the number of these line segments is again at least half the total number of incidences. Thus if denotes the number of such line segments, it will suffice to show that

formula_4

Now consider the graph formed by using the points as vertices, and the line segments as edges. Since each line segment lies on one of lines, and any two lines intersect in at most one point, the crossing number of this graph is at most the number of points where two lines intersect, which is at most . The crossing number inequality implies that either , or that . In either case , giving the desired bound

:formula_5

== Proof of the second formulation ==
Since every pair of points can be connected by at most one line, there can be at most lines which can connect at or more points, since . This bound will prove the theorem when is small (e.g. if for some absolute constant ). Thus, we need only consider the case when is large, say .

Suppose that there are &quot;m&quot; lines that each contain at least points. These lines generate at least incidences, and so by the first formulation of the Szemerédi–Trotter theorem, we have

formula_6

and so at least one of the statements formula_7, or formula_8 is true. The third possibility is ruled out since was assumed to be large, so we are left with the first two. But in either of these two cases, some elementary algebra will give the bound formula_9 as desired.

== Optimality ==
Except for its constant, the Szemerédi–Trotter incidence bound cannot be improved. To see this, consider for any positive integer formula_10 a set of points on the integer lattice

formula_11

and a set of lines

formula_12

Clearly, formula_13 and formula_14. Since each line is incident to points (i.e., once for each formula_15), the number of incidences is formula_16 which matches the upper bound.

== Generalization to formula_17 ==
One generalization of this result to arbitrary dimension, formula_17, was found by Agarwal and Aronov. Given a set of points, , and the set of hyperplanes, , which are each spanned by , the number of incidences between and is bounded above by

formula_19

provided formula_20. Equivalently, the number of hyperplanes in containing or more points is bounded above by

formula_21

A construction due to Edelsbrunner shows this bound to be asymptotically optimal.

József Solymosi and Terence Tao obtained near sharp upper bounds for the number of incidences between points and algebraic varieties in higher dimensions, when the points and varieties satisfy &quot;certain pseudo-line type axioms&quot;. Their proof uses the Polynomial Ham Sandwich Theorem.

==In formula_22== 
Many proofs of the Szemerédi–Trotter theorem over formula_23 rely in a crucial way on the topology of Euclidean space, so do not extend easily to other fields. e.g. the original proof of Szemerédi and Trotter; the polynomial partitioning proof and the crossing number proof do not extend to the complex plane.

Tóth successfully generalized the original proof of Szemerédi and Trotter to the complex plane formula_22 by introducing additional ideas. This result was also obtained independently and through a different method by Zahl. The implicit constant in the bound is not the same in the complex numbers: in Tóth&#x27;s proof the constant can be taken to be formula_25; the constant is not explicit in Zahl&#x27;s proof.

When the point set is a Cartesian product, Solymosi and Tardos show that the Szemerédi-Trotter bound holds using a much simpler argument.

== In finite fields ==
Let formula_26 be a field.

A Szemerédi-Trotter bound is impossible in general due to the following example, stated here in formula_27: let formula_28 be the set of all formula_29 points and let formula_30 be the set of all formula_29 lines in the plane. Since each line contains formula_32 points, there are formula_33 incidences. On the other hand, a Szemerédi-Trotter bound would give formula_34 incidences. This example shows that the trivial, combinatorial incidence bound is tight.

Bourgain, Katz and Tao show that if this example is excluded, then an incidence bound that is an improvement on the trivial bound can be attained.

Incidence bounds over finite fields are of two types: (i) when at least one of the set of points or lines is `large&#x27; in terms of the characteristic of the field; (ii) both the set of points and the set of lines are `small&#x27; in terms of the characteristic.

=== Large set incidence bounds ===
Let formula_35 be an odd prime power. Then Vinh showed that the number of incidences between formula_36 points and formula_37 lines in formula_38 is at most

formula_39

Note that there is no implicit constant in this bound.

=== Small set incidence bounds ===
Let formula_26 be a field of characteristic formula_41. Stevens and de Zeeuw show that the number of incidences between formula_36 points and formula_37 lines in formula_44 is

formula_45

under the condition formula_46 in positive characteristic. (In a field of characteristic zero, this condition is not necessary.) This bound is better than the trivial incidence estimate when formula_47.

If the point set is a Cartesian Product, then they show an improved incidence bound: let formula_48 be a finite set of points with formula_49 and let formula_50 be a set of lines in the plane. Suppose that formula_51 and in positive characteristic that formula_52. Then the number of incidences between formula_53 and formula_50 is

formula_55

This bound is optimal. Note that by point-line duality in the plane, this incidence bound can be rephrased for an arbitrary point set and a set of lines having a Cartesian product structure.

In both the reals and arbitrary fields, Rudnev and Shkredov show an incidence bound for when both the point set and the line set has a Cartesian product structure. This is sometimes better than the above bounds.

<text>is a video game produced by HAL Laboratory in 1984 for the MSX. A Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game was released in 1988. It is designed to be played by one to four players, in turn. It is an emulation of a pinball machine.

The pinball machine rendered in &quot;Rollerball&quot; is composed of four screens, which, by proportion, would be about as long as two standard pinball tables if it were a real table. The graphics on two of the four screens are based on various aspects of the New York City skyline. The topmost screen (hereafter called the &quot;bonus screen&quot;) merely shows some clouds and a blimp. The second screen (the &quot;main screen&quot;) shows the top of the Empire State Building, while the third screen (&quot;intermediate&quot;) shows the lower skyline and the Statue of Liberty. The lowest (&quot;final&quot;) screen shows only a blue backdrop, representing the Ocean.

==Gameplay==
===Main screen===
In the main mode, each player launches the ball directly into the main screen. To the top is a small loop marked &quot;SLOT&quot;; if the player sends the ball through this loop, a slot machine display in the center of the screen cycles, with various penalties or rewards given when one of the three symbols (an eggplant, a pair of cherries, or a bell) appears three times. The center of the SLOT loop is open, allowing the player to enter the bonus screen.

There is a pair of kickback holes in the upper left of the main screen, with a bumper in proximity to the upper one. The lower one will shoot the ball straight up, relying on the curvature of the wall to direct it into the upper hole if the player is lucky. If the ball falls in the upper hole, one of two things can happen. If the kickback slot in the bonus screen is empty, the ball will be transferred to that slot and another ball will be released to the plunger to enter play. If the kickback slot is already filled, the ball is relaunched from the lower hole.

===Intermediate screen===
When in the intermediate screen, the most viable way of returning to the main screen is by a kickback hole on the upper left of the screen. It initially fires up to the main screen when entered, but switches directions every time it is used. If the player gets three cherries on the main screen slot, this hole will always shoot the ball upwards. Otherwise, there are some chances to score in this screen, but it is not a desirable place to have the ball.

There are three sets of three drop targets, and a set of three slots. When the game begins, a light (with the letter A) is lit above the first slot, and one set of three drop targets is chosen and marked with a flashing green light. Additionally, a bonus tally on this screen begins at 3,000 points. Completing a set of drop targets increases this bonus tally; sending the ball through a slot when its light is lit (one can move the light by flipping the flippers) adds the current tally to the player&#x27;s score.

===Lower screen===
The lower screen, however, is the least desirable place to be. The ball can only be officially drained from this screen. However, some options are still available to the player:

* The apparatus on the left side of the screen acts as a kind of slot machine to provide bonuses. The button on the lower side of the apparatus enables it, the spinner changes the bonus indicated, and the flashing sensor will (as long as it is flashing when the ball passes over it) award the player the indicated bonus.
* A smaller right flipper sits near a kickback hole at the upper right of the screen. If enabled through either receiving three cherries on the main screen or the Exit Hole bonus from the lower screen bonus apparatus, this hole sends the ball back to the plunger to be relaunched, with no lost ball penalty.
* A kickback slot to the left of the left flipper complex can be opened the same way as the Exit Hole, as can a stopper between the two flippers. The kickback can also be opened by lighting the ABC slots in the middle of the screen.
* A well-aimed hit from the left flipper can send the ball safely back into the intermediate screen.

===Bonus screen===
While on the bonus screen, the player must shoot the ball over each of seven sensors, with the letters in the phrase &quot;SKY HIGH&quot; written on them, in a random but forced order. (That is, the player must shoot the ball over the flashing letter to light it and activate it; passing over non-flashing or already activated letters has no effect.) After this is done and the ball is placed in the kickback hole at the top of the screen, the letters turn into bumpers which must be hit numerous times to remove and start the bonus game again. Successfully finishing this bonus gives the player a large sum of points, as well as an extra ball (the first time completed) or an increase of the bonus multiplier (any other completion).

Two sets of four targets, similar to drop targets, are in the top corners of the bonus screen. When all activated, the upper left targets, labeled &quot;RAISE THE SAVER&quot;, place a stopper at the gap between the left wall and the left flipper apparatus. The upper right targets, labeled &quot;OPEN THE GATE&quot;, open a kickback slot in the lower right corner. Locking a ball in the kickback slot will send the ball into play as part of a two-ball multiball event when the bonus game is enabled. If the slot is opened when a ball is already locked, the locked ball will kick the entering ball back into play.

===Losing a ball===
If the ball passes the flippers on the lower screen, on either side or between the flippers, it is drained and the end-of-ball bonus is calculated. A tally of the current bonus is kept during gameplay and shown on the lower screen; this bonus starts at 1,000 points and is increased in intervals of 1,000 points during play. Upon draining the ball, the bonus is counted down to 0 points and added to the player&#x27;s score; to represent any increase in the bonus multiplier, this count is repeated. The bonus multiplier can be increased by finishing the bonus game more than once, or by receiving three cherries or three bells on the main screen slot machine.

The game ends after three balls (in addition to any extra balls from the bonus screen) are drained; a typical final score can be around 300,000 points. Scoring 1,000,000 points enables the credits after the final ball is drained.

==Match play==
The alternate mode is a two-player game called Match Play. In this mode, a much smaller table, only one screen tall, houses a number of buttons and switches that lower the score of the player on that side by various amounts. Four sensors in the middle of the table will switch the scores of the two players whenever they all become lit. A slot machine is spun by the buttons on the outer walls, and its bonus is enacted by hitting the button on the top wall. The first player to lose all his or her points loses.

Two animals in the middle of each player&#x27;s area show an emotion, from ecstasy to sadness, through neutral indifference, depending on that player&#x27;s score and the score margin between the two players. In the Japanese version, the left player&#x27;s animal is an elephant, and the right player&#x27;s is a giraffe. In the English version, the giraffe was changed to a donkey, likely in reference to the Republican and Democratic U.S. political parties.

<text>José Vega Santana, known by his stage name &quot;Remi&quot; (born February 28, 1958) is a singer and clown from Puerto Rico. His career as a clown, spanning over 35 years, began with the group &quot;Los Dulces Payasos&quot; (&quot;The Sweet Clowns&quot;) after developing the character of Remi while a student at the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico. He&#x27;s one of the most famed clowns in Puerto Rico.

==Family life==
Vega is married to Bettina Mercado, president of Bettina Cosmetics. He has a daughter from a previous marriage to Marina Berti, Marina Vega Berti who participated in Miss Universe Puerto Rico 2013 as Miss Luquillo.

==Early years==
Vega was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, his mother was the lead singer in &quot;Googie Santana&quot; and his grandfather was former baseball player Pepe Santana. Ever since he was young, Vega knew that he wanted to be an entertainer. He started as a radio music programmer and announcer. Later, he joined the dance and theater company of María Teresa Miranda.

In the mid-1970s, Vega was a Psychology student in the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico. During that time he also took painting classes in the School of Plastic Arts in San Juan. It is there that he, together with some other students decided to form an &quot;Artisans Market&quot; at the Luis Muñoz Rivera Park. The purpose of the &quot;Market&quot; was to give painting classes to young children, and on one occasion they dressed up as clowns. This was when Vega developed and created the character of &quot;Remi&quot;. They became so popular that they decided to form a group and call themselves &quot;Los Dulces Payasos&quot; (The Sweet Clowns).

==Remi the clown==

In 1983, Vega and the group received an offer from local T.V. producer Tommy Muñiz to work in &quot;Channel 7&quot;. The channel gave them their own children&#x27;s show. During this time they also recorded an album with songs composed by Vega. They have the distinction of being the first &quot;cultural clowns&quot; to create new children&#x27;s songs in Puerto Rico.

During the time that Vega wasn&#x27;t acting in his clown character, he sang and composed songs for the group Haciendo Punto en Otro Son. Vega composed &quot;Mi Son&quot;, a song that summarized the band&#x27;s journey from the first album until the last studio album &quot;Llegaremos&quot;. He participated in the group until the live album, &quot;Punto Final&quot; (1986). He also did a solo of one of his compositions called &quot;Personajes&quot;.

In 1985, Vega developed a new concept in children&#x27;s television, which he called &quot;Chiquimundo&quot;, and whose main objective was to educate children. This show was also transmitted on &quot;Channel 7&quot; and was produced by Rafo Muñiz (Tommy&#x27;s son). &quot;Remi&quot; was joined by the clowns &quot;Colorina&quot; and &quot;Cascabel&quot;. The show was an instant hit with the children and their parents in Puerto Rico.

In 1986, the three clowns recorded an album for children which became a local hit. Vega joined forces with the musician Pedro Rivera Toledo and produced the theater production of &quot;El Soldadito de Plomo&quot; (The Little Lead Soldier) in which Vega played the leading role.

==Singing career==
In the year 2000, Vega was selected to represent Puerto Rico in the international song festival known as the OTI which was celebrated in the city of Acapulco, Mexico. In the festival he sang one of his compositions &quot;Con Una Canción&quot; (With A Song) and won first place as &quot;Best Singer&quot;. He also won a second place prize for &quot;Best Composer&quot;. The last time a Puerto Rican had received a distinction in the &quot;OTI&quot; festival was in 1980, when Rafael José won as &quot;Best Singer&quot;. Vega received a hero&#x27;s welcome upon his return to the island and was honored by the Puerto Rico House of Representatives and Senate for his distinguished career of 20 years.

==Later years==
Vega has traveled to many cities in the United States making presentations as &quot;Remi&quot;. He had a comic book which was called &quot;Remi, El Clown&quot; which presented the adventures of Puerto Rico&#x27;s Clown, Remi.

<text>The Santa Matilde, or SM4.1, is a sports car designed and produced in Brazil by Companhia Industrial Santa Matilde between 1977 and 1997.

== Conception ==

Equipped with tuned versions of the Chevrolet Opala engine, the first prototype was revealed at the 1976 Salão do Automóvel de São Paulo as one of the most expensive and luxurious cars in the country at the time. It featured items like retractable bumpers, power windows, hidden radio antenna, cassette player, retractable seat belts, leather seats with fine adjustment and air conditioning.

The project was run by engineer Humberto Pimentel Duarte and former pilot and race-car tuner Renato Peixoto. The body design came from Humberto&#x27;s daughter Ana Lídia and was not based on any previous car, although a few details were inspired by many car models.

== Characteristics ==

The Santa Matilde has a fiberglass body reinforced with polyester. It is a 2+2 coupe, but the rear seats are completely useless and headroom is tight for drivers taller than 

In 1982 two engines were available; a 4.1 straight 6 cylinder 171 hp (157 kW) (SAE), or a 2.5 4 cylinder turbo, with . The engines originally came from the Chevrolet Opala, featuring a specially designed exhaust manifold and a different carburetor. The car has smoothly integrated direction and rear lights. The lower front air intakes are used for the air conditioning and the internal ventilation.

The instrument panel resembles the contemporary Porsche models at the time - it had indicators for water temperature, oil pressure, speed, odometer (full and partial), RPM, fuel level and a clock. One interesting feature about the car, were the retractable bumpers made of a rubber compound with steel frames. Unlike most cars on sale in Brazil at the time, the Santa Matilde had both front and rear disc brakes.

== Generations ==

=== Santa Matilde 78-79 ===
Line-produced between 1978 and 1979, it had 171 hp (128 kW) and a top speed of . Based on the prototype, this version had some problems like overheating, noise and ventilation

=== Santa Matilde 82 ===
Externally, a new rear design and some cosmetic changes at the front, smoothing some lines. Internally, many of the earlier model&#x27;s problems were addressed. This model was line-produced in 1982 with small changes in design.

=== Santa Matilde 83-87 ===

Entering series production in 1983, this model was a sedan style with a top speed of over . Sold as the Santa Matilde SM 4.1, production ended in August 1987.

==== Santa Matilde Cabriolet ====
Produced intermittently between 1984 and 1990, this was a convertible version.

=== Santa Matilde 91-95 ===
Line-produced between 1991 and 1995, this model had square front lights and was also produced by demand between 1991 and 1995.

=== Santa Matilde 97 ===

A lot of modifications were introduced in this model:

* New independent differential from the Chevrolet Omega
* New rear suspension
* Many design changes

On May 27, 2003, the band released their self-titled debut album &quot;Smile Empty Soul&quot;. The album was produced by John Lewis Parker, and mixed by David J. Holman. Three singles, &quot;Bottom of a Bottle&quot;, &quot;Nowhere Kids&quot; and &quot;Silhouettes&quot;, were released via the recording. In March 2005, the album was certified gold with sales in excess of 500,000+.

===&quot;Anxiety&quot; (2005–2006)===
In 2005, before the recording of their second album &quot;Anxiety&quot; was finished, drummer Derek Gledhill was replaced by Flickerstick percussionist Dominic Weir. Their album &quot;Anxiety&quot; was not released (at that time) due to the band parting ways with Lava Records after the company refused to release their record.

On July 13, 2006, Smile Empty Soul signed with independent label, Bieler Bros. Records. At this point, drummer Dominic Weir had been replaced by Jake Kilmer, and Mike Booth (ex-Cold) was added as a second guitarist.

===&quot;Vultures&quot; (2006–2009)===
On October 24, 2006, the band released &quot;Vultures&quot;, the official follow-up to their 2003 debut &quot;Smile Empty Soul&quot;. The album doesn&#x27;t feature any songs from the unreleased &quot;Anxiety&quot;. The first single released was the song &quot;The Hit&quot;.

&quot;Vultures&quot; debuted at No. 169 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts with just over 5,000 copies sold. The band then embarked on a tour with The Exies.

In late April 2007, the band parted ways with Mike Booth, which was a mutual split. The band has yet to replace him, and has continued on as a 3-piece.

The trio began recording their new record in Greenville, South Carolina on February 1, 2008.

===&quot;Consciousness&quot; and &quot;More Anxiety&quot; (2009–2012)===
Soon after recording for their new album entitled &quot;Consciousness&quot; was finished, the band returned to the studio to record a few more songs. Later on, the band confirmed that they had signed with F.O.F./EMI records. &quot; Consciousness &quot;was then released in August 2009.

In November 2009, the 2005 album &quot;Anxiety&quot; was released on iTunes.

On March 9, 2010, &quot;More Anxiety&quot;, a special edition of &quot;Anxiety&quot; including a bonus DVD was released.

Smile Empty Soul have released music videos for &quot;We&#x27;re Through&quot; and &quot;Faker&quot; from their album &quot;Consciousness&quot;.

In 2009, it was announced that Danielsen formed a new group called World Fire Brigade with Fuel vocalist Brett Scallions, which also consisted of bassist Brad Stewart (ex-Shinedown) and former Candiria drummer Ken Schalk. The debut studio album, entitled &quot;Spreading My Wings&quot;, was released in August 2012 through FrostByte Media.

===&quot;3&#x27;s&quot; (2012–2013)===
On March 14, 2012, it was announced that Smile Empty Soul had signed with eOne Music. They released their first album with eOne Music, &quot;3&#x27;s&quot; on May 22, 2012.

In March 2012, &quot;Afterlife&quot;, the first single from &quot;3&#x27;s&quot;, was released.

In April 2013 lead singer Sean Danielsen released his solo EP &quot;Enjoy the Process&quot;.

Later that year, October 1, 2013 was announced as the expected date of release.

===&quot;Chemicals&quot; (2013–2015)===

In June 2013 it was announced that Smile Empty Soul formed an imprint label called Two Disciples Entertainment in conjunction with Pavement Entertainment and would release &quot;Chemicals&quot; in fall of 2013.

On November 3, 2014, Danielsen released his second solo EP entitled &quot;Food Chain&quot;.

===&quot;Shapeshifter&quot; (2015–2017)===
In September 2015, the ensemble also announced through their Facebook page that in early 2016, an EP and DVD was expected. In November 2015, the band stated that the artwork for the EP is complete. The work, whose title was announced in January 2016 as &quot;Shapeshifter&quot; is scheduled for release on 1 April 2016.

===&quot;Rarities&quot;,&quot; Oblivion &quot;and&quot; Sheep&quot; (2017–present)===
In October 2016, the band stated via their Facebook page that in early 2017, they plan to release a compilation album consisting of 13 rare and unreleased tracks. On 10 December 2016 the compilation album was announced as &quot;Rarities&quot; as well as artwork and some track names.

In September 2017, the ensemble announced via their Facebook page that Kilmer and Martin would be parting ways with Smile Empty Soul, leaving Danielsen as the only remaining original band member. Mark Young, originally from Hed PE and Victor Ribas, originally from HURT, have joined the band as both touring and recording musicians on bass and drums/percussion/vocals respectively.

In May 2018, Young announced his departure from the ensemble.

On February 7, 2019 it was announced that Smile Empty Soul will be releasing an acoustic EP titled &quot;The Acoustic Sessions. Volume 1&quot; In August 2019, Danielsen announced that the ensemble planned to release an EP entitled &quot;Sheep&quot;.

On February 14, 2020 Sean was teasing new gear on Smile Empty Soul Page with Caption &quot;Interesting things to come...&quot; and Sean revealing Smile Empty Soul will continue as 2 Member Band Only.
On May 18, 2020, it was announced on Facebook along with album art on May 18, 2020 that Acoustic Sessions Vol.2 is going to be recorded.
