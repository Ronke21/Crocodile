<text>Rosedale is a neighborhood in New York City in the southeastern portion of the borough of Queens. The neighborhood, located along the southern part of Queens, borders Nassau County.

Rosedale is located in Queens Community District 13 and its ZIP Code is 11422. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 105th Precinct.

== History ==
Rosedale was originally conceived in the consolidation of the borough of Queens as a part of what is now Springfield Gardens. At the time, the Laurelton Land Company was in charge of the new Borough of Queens. It was dotted with farmland that was isolated from each other, so construction on an acceptable mode of transportation was started immediately. The Southern Railroad of Long Island (now Long Island Rail Road) was built and the whole area (today Laurelton, Rosedale, and Springfield Gardens) was served by the Laurelton station. The area was also connected to the Brooklyn waterworks. In the 20th century, the water system was less needed, and its use dwindled. Today the ruins of the aqueduct system can still be seen. After the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s construction, many new roads such as Francis Lewis and Sunrise Boulevard (today Sunrise Highway) were constructed. The area that is now Rosedale remained farmland until the mid-1930s. After the former period of relatively slow growth, development rapidly turned Rosedale into a suburban community. Rosedale was originally known as Foster&#x27;s Meadow.

During the mid-1970s, African American and Caribbean families started moving into what had been a mostly Irish, Italian, and Jewish community. Many black families&#x27; homes were firebombed to harass them and cajole them to leave. The U.S. government filed a civil-rights lawsuit in 1975 against a group named Return Our American Rights (ROAR), alleging that ROAR had been harassing white homeowners who tried to sell to black clients, and implicating ROAR in some of the firebombings. In 1976, Bill Moyers presented a documentary titled &quot;Rosedale: The Way It Is,&quot; which addressed the racial tensions in the community. While the racial tensions decreased in subsequent years, there were still some incidents of racial conflict: for instance, during the July 4 weekend in 1989, a group of white youths chased black youths through Rosedale after a dispute over firecrackers.

In the end, the area ended up being mostly a home to many Caribbean immigrants. Irish, Italian, and Jewish Americans moved to the neighboring Nassau County communities of Valley Stream, South Valley Stream, and Woodmere.

== Location ==
Rosedale is bordered to the north by Cambria Heights, to the east by Valley Stream and North Woodmere (both in Nassau County), to the west by Laurelton, Springfield Gardens, and John F. Kennedy International Airport, and to the south by Inwood and Lawrence in Nassau County. It is at the eastern edge of New York City, at its border with Valley Stream forming part of the boundary between Queens and Nassau County. The neighborhood is part of Queens Community Board 13. Many roads of importance in Queens also run through Rosedale such as Francis Lewis Boulevard, Conduit Avenue, Cross Island Parkway, and the Belt Parkway, as well as Rockaway Boulevard, Sunrise Highway, and Merrick Boulevard which connect Queens and Nassau Counties.

<text>Mesohippus (Greek: / meaning &quot;middle&quot; and / meaning &quot;horse&quot;) is an extinct genus of early horse. It lived 37 to 32 million years ago in the Early Oligocene. Like many fossil horses, &quot;Mesohippus&quot; was common in North America. Its shoulder height is estimated at 60 cm.

==Description==

&quot;Mesohippus&quot; had longer legs than its predecessor &quot;Eohippus&quot; and stood about 60 cm (6 hands) tall. This equid is the first fully tridactyl horse in the evolutionary record, with the third digit being longer and larger than its second and fourth digits; &quot;Mesohippus&quot; had not developed a hoof at this point, rather it still had pads as seen in &quot;Hyracotherium&quot; and &quot;Orohippus&quot;. The face of &quot;Mesohippus&quot; was longer and larger than earlier equids. It had a slight facial fossa, or depression, in the skull. The eyes were rounder, and were set wider apart and further back than in &quot;Hyracotherium&quot;.

Unlike earlier horses, its teeth were low crowned and contained a single gap behind the front teeth, where the bit now rests in the modern horse. In addition, it had another grinding tooth, making a total of six. &quot;Mesohippus&quot; was a browser that fed on tender twigs and fruit. The cerebral hemisphere, or cranial cavity, was notably larger than that of its predecessors and its brain was similar to modern horses.

<doc id="1068045" wikidata="Q942905" url="?curid=1068045" title="Miohippus">
<text>Miohippus (meaning &quot;small horse&quot;) is an extinct genus of horse existing longer than most Equidae. It lived in what is now North America from 32 to 25 million years ago, during the late Eocene to late Oligocene. According to the Florida Museum of Natural History, Othniel Charles Marsh first believed &quot;Miohippus&quot; lived during the Miocene and thus named the genus using this incorrect conclusion. More recent research provides evidence that &quot;Miohippus&quot; actually lived during the Paleogene period.

&quot;Miohippus&quot; species are commonly referred to as the three-toed horses. Their range was from Alberta, Canada to Florida to California.

== Taxonomy ==
The type species of &quot;Miohippus&quot;, &quot;M. annectens&quot;, was named by Marsh in 1874. It is classified as a member of the subfamily Anchitheriinae following MacFadden (1998).

=== Species list ===
* &quot;M. anceps&quot; 
* &quot;M. annectens&quot; 
* &quot;M. assiniboiensis&quot; 
* &quot;M. condoni&quot; 
* &quot;M. equiceps&quot; 
* &quot;M. equinanus&quot; 
* &quot;M. gemmarosae&quot; 
* &quot;M. gidleyi&quot; 
* &quot;M. intermedius&quot; 
* &quot;M. longicristis&quot; 
* &quot;M. obliquidens&quot; 
* &quot;M. primus&quot; 
* &quot;M. quartus&quot; 

== Description ==
The species &quot;M. obliquidens&quot; dating from 34.9 to 30.0 Ma found in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska when calculated for estimated body mass were within the margin of 25 to 30 kg. &quot;Miohippus&quot; became much larger than &quot;Mesohippus&quot;. They weighed around 40 to 55 kilograms. They were somewhat larger than most earlier Eocene horse ancestors, but still much smaller than modern horses, which typically weigh about 500 kilograms.

&quot;Miohippus&quot; was larger than &quot;Mesohippus&quot; and had a slightly longer skull. Its facial fossa was deeper and more expanded, and the ankle joint was subtly different. &quot;Miohippus&quot; also had a variable extra crest on its upper molars, which gave it a larger surface area for chewing tougher forage. This would become a typical characteristic of the teeth of later equine species.

&quot;Miohippus&quot; had two forms, one of which adjusted to the life in forests, while the other remained suited to life on prairies. The forest form led to the birth of &quot;Kalobatippus&quot; (or &quot;Miohippus intermedius&quot;), whose second and fourth finger again elongated for travel on the softer primeval forest grounds. The &quot;Kalobatippus&quot; managed to relocate to Asia via the Bering Strait land bridge, and from there moved into Europe, where its fossils were formerly described under the name &quot;Anchitherium&quot;. &quot;Kalobatippus&quot; is then believed to have evolved into a form known as &quot;Hypohippus&quot;, which became extinct near the beginning of the Pliocene.

As many as eight species of &quot;Miohippus&quot; were described from the John Day Formation of Oregon, but recent work on the dental variation has determined that only one species of &quot;Miohippus&quot; was present within a given member.

<text>Dimitris Avramopoulos (; born 6 June 1953) is a Greek politician of the conservative New Democracy party, and former career diplomat. He has served in various high-level cabinet posts, including Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for National Defence, and was Mayor of Athens from 1995 to 2002. He served as EU Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship in the Juncker Commission between 2014 and 2019.

==Personal life==
Avramopoulos was born in Athens in 1953, into a family which had originally come from Ilia and Elliniko in Arcadia. He served his 26 months military service from 1978 to 1980 in the Hellenic Air Force.

He is married to Vivian, with whom he has two sons, Filippos and Iasonas. Apart from his native Greek, he speaks English, French and Italian fluently.

==Diplomatic career==
In 1980, Avramopoulos joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Athens, where he worked until 1993. From 1988 to 1992, he served as Greek Consul to Belgium in Liège. At the same time he was a Special Adviser to Konstantinos Mitsotakis, President and Leader of the New Democracy. During this time he also represented Greece in Vienna at the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe. In 1992 he became official spokesman of the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was appointed Consul General of Greece in Geneva. In 1993 he was promoted to director of the Prime Minister of Greece&#x27;s Diplomatic Office.

==Political career==
===Mayor of Athens===
In 1993, Avramopoulos resigned from Greek diplomatic service to enter parliamentary politics as a member of New Democracy and was elected a member of its Central Committee. From 1993 to 1994 he served as a Member of the Hellenic Parliament. In 1994 he was elected Mayor of Athens, and was re-elected in October 1998 in a historic first-round landslide victory. From 1995 to 1999 he served as chairman of the &quot;Central Union of Local Authorities&quot; of Greece.

In 1995 he founded the “Permanent Conference of the Mayors of the Capitals of South-East Europe” and served as its first President. From 1996 to 2000 he served as vice-president of the executive committee of the International Union of Local Authorities (IULA) and from 1997 to 2002, as a member of the Committee of the Regions of the European Union. Elected as president of the Summit Conference of the Mayors of the World in 2000, he served until 2002, during which time he founded the &quot;&quot;World Union of Olympic Cities&quot;, &quot;Athens’ International Prize for Democracy&quot;&quot;, and “&quot;World Institute of Global and Cities’ Diplomacy&quot;”, Rome.

===Ministerial posts===
In March 2001, he split from New Democracy with his Movement of Free Citizens (KEP), but in a surprising move merged back in June 2002. When in 2004 New Democracy won the parliamentary elections, Avramopoulos was appointed Minister of Tourism, serving until 2006, and afterwards, from 2006 until 2009, as Minister of Health and Social Solidarity.

In the October 2009 election, Avramopoulos was re-elected to the Hellenic Parliament representing the constituency of Athens A. After the election of Antonis Samaras to the “New Democracy” Party Presidency he was appointed President of the Organizing Committee of the 8th Party Congress held at Athens in June 2010. In July 2010, he became Vice-President of “New Democracy”, serving until 1 November 2014.

On 11 November 2011 he was appointed Minister for National Defence in the coalition government of Lucas Papademos, resigning from his parliamentary seat, thus adhering to the New Democracy policy that no serving Opposition Party Deputies may hold ministerial office.

At the 6 May 2012 election, Avramopoulos was returned as Deputy for Athens A, being re-elected in the 17 June 2012 general election. On 21 June 2012 he was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs. After the Cabinet reshuffle of 25 June 2013 he became Greek Minister for Defence again, serving until his nomination as Greece&#x27;s European Commissioner in November 2014.

===European Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs===

On 27 July 2014, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras nominated Avramopoulos as Greece&#x27;s next member of the European Commission. Before the nomination, Dora Bakoyiannis was widely seen to be a strong contender for the Commission post. Samaras also defied calls from the centre-left Pasok party for Maria Damanaki to continue as European Commissioner.

Jean-Claude Juncker then nominated Avramopoulos as European Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs. In this capacity, Avramopoulos shares competency over cyber-security matters with Günther Oettinger.

In the aftermath of the victory of the left-wing SYRIZA party in the 25 January election in 2015, Avramopoulos&#x27; name was widely circulated in Greek media as the most likely choice for SYRIZA&#x27;s candidate in the second round of the election for the Presidency of Greece. According to the Greek media reports, the nomination would be seen both as a gesture of conciliation with the right, but would crucially also enable SYRIZA to nominate its own European Commissioner. On 30 January Samaras phoned Avramopoulos and assured him that &quot;New Democracy&quot; would support his eventual nomination.

Avramopoulos criticized the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria. He said that &quot;the European Union remains committed to the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Syrian state&quot;.

=== Member of Parliament ===
Avramopoulos was elected to the Hellenic Parliament in Elis at the June 2023 Greek legislative election.

==Other positions==
From the outset of his political career, Avramopoulos served for twenty years as Honorary President of the &quot;Athens’ International Prize for Democracy&quot; for UNESCO in Paris (until 2013). He has also been Chairman of the Steering Committee on Cities´ Diplomacy, established by the Global Forum (Rome) and the World Bank Institute (Washington D.C.). He was elected President of the “World Institute of Global and Cities’ Diplomacy”, an independent NGO based in Rome as well as Executive President of the “World Union of Olympic Cities”, an Olympic Games NGO.

==Greek-Turkish rapprochement==
Avramopoulos has a friendly relation with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan since they were Mayors of Athens and Istanbul respectively. He is deemed one of the main proponents of Greek-Turkish rapprochement.
Also this year the two former Mayors came together to discuss topics regarding Migration, Borders and Security on European and EU-level in Istanbul on 3 June 2019.
On the same day, Avramopoulos also met with Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu to discuss about the same topic.
==Academic degrees==
Avramopoulos read Public Law and Political Science at Athens University Law School, graduating with the degree of Bachelor of Arts (BA).
He then undertook postgraduate studies receiving a Master&#x27;s degree in European Studies at the Institute of European Affairs, Université libre de Bruxelles.
He has been conferred honorary doctorates by Adelphi University (Long Island, New York), Deree College (Athens), Drexel University (Philadelphia) and Kingston University (London), and has been elected Honorary Professor of Peking University (Beijing) and of the European College of Parma (Italy).

<text>The Reading Royals are a professional ice hockey team that currently plays in the ECHL. The team participates in the North Division of the ECHL&#x27;s Eastern Conference. The Royals play their home games at the Santander Arena located in downtown Reading, Pennsylvania.

Since 2001, the Royals have ranked among ECHL leaders in regular season attendance. On March 25, 2006, against the Trenton Titans, the Royals reached their one millionth fan in attendance. The Royals hosted two ECHL All-Star Games; one in 2005 and one in 2009. The Royals were the 2013 ECHL Kelly Cup champions. They earned the title with a five-game victory over the Stockton Thunder in the 2013 Kelly Cup Finals.

==Franchise history==
===Columbus Chill and Kings era===
The Reading Royals were founded in 1991 as the Columbus Chill. David Paitson was the team&#x27;s first president and general manager while former NHL player Terry Ruskowski was the head coach, started the team with a goal of introducing new audiences to the sport of ice hockey and building a strong fan base. The two were successful with the help of an extensive marketing plan. The Chill&#x27;s 83-game sellout streak beginning in early January 1992 still stands as a minor league hockey record today. It would take the team two seasons to reach the playoffs, doing so in 1994 under coach Ruskowski. The Chill would go on to win two conference championships and make the playoffs for five of the eight seasons. The Chill were a key part of the growth of hockey in Columbus, Ohio, and paved the way for the National Hockey League expansion Columbus Blue Jackets in 2000.

The Chill then suspended operations for in 1999 to make room for the Blue Jackets. The Chill franchise relocated during their inactive two year status to their present location in downtown Reading, Pennsylvania, for the 2001–02 season as the Reading Royals. When the franchise returned to active status in the ECHL, they became the affiliate of the NHL&#x27;s Los Angeles Kings and their American Hockey League affiliate, the Manchester Monarchs. At the time, the Royals were partially owned by the same owners of the Kings and Monarchs, the Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG). The rest of the ownership was by Santander Arena management, SMG.

The Royals made their first trip to the Kelly Cup playoffs in 2004 in their third season, winning the North Division playoff championship under head coach Derek Clancey. In the next season, they became the North Division regular season champions, only to lose to the eventual Kelly Cup champion Trenton Titans in the North Division Finals.

Under coach Karl Taylor from 2005 to 2008, the Royals had generally mediocre performance in regular season performances. In the 2007–08 season, skaters Dany Roussin and Brock Hooton enjoyed some fame in Reading due to their &quot;goal-a-game&quot; nature for much of the season, while tough-guys Steven Later and Malcolm MacMillan were among league leaders in penalty minutes. After a strong finish to the regular season, Taylor led the team to the North Division Finals where their tour ended in a seven-game battle with the Cincinnati Cyclones. The Cyclones continued on to sweep past other teams to win the Kelly Cup, but the Royals were the only team to take them to seven games in the playoffs.

Some better-known players during this era who played for the Royals include Los Angeles Kings goaltenders Barry Brust, Jonathan Quick, and Yutaka Fukufuji; Phoenix Coyotes winger Ryan Flinn; Toronto Maple Leafs goaltender James Reimer; and Anaheim Ducks winger George Parros, who was the first Royal to appear in the Stanley Cup finals. Veteran Larry Courville and former head coach Derek Clancey have also contributed to the Royals organization.

===New affiliations and the Courville era===
The 2007–08 season would be Karl Taylor&#x27;s last with the Royals organization. In late June 2008, general manager Gordon Kaye announced that Taylor would leave Reading to serve as coach for the AEG&#x27;s newly acquired ECHL franchise, the Ontario Reign. The new team would also become the primary affiliate for AEG&#x27;s Kings and Monarchs. On July 9, 2008, the Royals became the affiliate of the Boston Bruins and a secondary affiliate for the Toronto Maple Leafs for the 2008–09 season. The Royals continued to wear their colors of purple, black, and silver. The Santander Arena and the city of Reading, Pennsylvania, were also named the hosts of the 2009 All-Star Game and Skills Challenge. On July 24, 2008, Reading announced that Jason Nobili would be head coach for the 2008–09 season. Unfortunately, Nobili was unable to coax much from the team and was dismissed by Kaye on January 6, 2009, with the team in last place overall in the ECHL. Larry Courville was named as interim coach for the remainder of the season.

On April 4, 2009, general manager Gordon Kaye announced that Courville would return for the 2009–10 season as full-time head coach. On August 4, 2009, The Royals announced it renewed their affiliations with the Bruins and Maple Leafs and the AHL&#x27;s Toronto Marlies.

In 2011, AEG sold off its shares of the Royals to the Berks County Convention Center Authority (BCCCA).

On July 9, 2012, the Royals became the affiliate of the Washington Capitals. At the end of their first season with the Capitals, the Royals won the 2013 Kelly Cup by defeating the Stockton Thunder in five games. Captain Yannick Tifu played in every regular season and postseason game, scoring a game-winning goal in the final minutes of game four of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Cincinnati Cyclones. Reading won the first three games of the 2013 Kelly Cup Finals against the Stockton Thunder. On May 25, 2013, goaltender Riley Gill had a 29-save shutout and the Royals defeated the Thunder 6–0 to claim the team&#x27;s first Kelly Cup. Riley Gill was named the MVP for the playoffs with a 13–4–0 record, a 1.91 a goals against average, a .930 save percentage, and four shutouts.

In 2014, Jack Gulati purchased all shares of the ownership of the Royals from SMG and BCCCA. In June 2014, the Philadelphia Flyers announced a two-year affiliation agreement with the Royals, giving the Flyers an entirely Pennsylvania based minor league system for the first time since 1997–98. The Flyers and Royals agreed to a multi-year affiliation extension in 2016.

During his eighth full season as head coach, Courville announced he would be stepping down at the end of the 2016–17 season. However, one day after qualifying for the 2017 playoffs, he was fired by the Royals and replaced by assistant Kirk MacDonald on an interim basis. The interim tag was removed from MacDonald a few weeks after the Royals were eliminated in the first round of the 2017 playoffs.

===2017–2022: Kirk MacDonald era===
The Royals&#x27; first season under Kirk MacDonald resulted in a third-place finish in the North Division with a 39–24–9–0 record and 87 points. Reading finished two points behind the Adirondack Thunder for first place. The Manchester Monarchs earned 88 points in the regular season and then swept the Royals in the North Division semifinals. The Monarchs won the first two games of the series in double overtime despite goaltender John Muse making 54 saves in game one and 53 in game two. In game three, Muse registered 52 saves, giving the three-highest postseason save performances from a Reading netminder in a four-day span. Forward Matt Willows lead the team with 32 goals and 74 points before he announced his retirement after the season. Muse split the season between Reading and the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the AHL and tied for a league-high .931 save percentage. The Royals took 658 penalty minutes, the fewest in ECHL history.

During the 2018–19 season, the Royals&#x27; owner Jack Gulati agreed to sell the team back to the Berks County Convention Center Authority (BCCCA), the previous ownership and the owners of Santander Arena, on June 30, 2019. The Royals concluded the 2018–19 season with a six-game win streak and eight-game point streak, finishing with 78 points and a 34–28–4–6 record, but were one point behind the Brampton Beast for the final playoff spot in the North Division. Reading had the most points of any team to miss the 2019 Kelly Cup playoffs. The Royals used eight goaltenders through the season, tied for the most in team history. Jamie Phillips went 8–2–0–1 in his final 12 games of the season after being reassigned to Reading at the trade deadline. Chris McCarthy had a career-best 54 assists and 74 points (third in league). On May 9, 2019, the Royals re-signed head coach Kirk McDonald to a two-year contract extension. The Royals and Flyers also renewed their affiliation though at least the 2019–20 season with a 2020–21 renewal option.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Royals voluntarily suspended operations for the 2020–21 ECHL season. The team returned for the 2021–22 season with another renewed affiliation with the Flyers.

On June 13, 2022, MacDonald announced he would resign as head coach.
===2022–2024: James Henry era===
On June 17, 2022, the Royals announced that James Henry would take over as head coach. On August 8, 2022, the Royals and Flyers announced that their partnership extended throughout the 2023–24 season with an option to extend the deal further. 
James Henry was relieved of Head Coaching duties on Jan 29th, 2024. 

===2024–present: Jason Binkley era===

After serving as the interim Head Coach following the dismissal of Head Coach James Henry, the Royals missed the playoffs for the first time since the 2018-2019 season. Binkley was hired as Head Coach, shedding the interim title as well adding General Manager to his resume on May 17, 2024.

<text>Marshall Julius Jefferson (born September 19, 1959) is an American musician, working in the house music subgenres of Chicago house and deep house.

==Biography==
Sometimes known as the father of house music, Jefferson was originally a record producer in the Universal Recording Studios in Chicago, where he met the owner of Trax Records, Larry Sherman. Jefferson&#x27;s 1986 single for Trax, &quot;Move Your Body&quot;, the first house song to use piano, was a popular and influential song in the genre. During the late-1980s heyday of house music, he recorded solo and collaborative material under various names such as Virgo, Jungle Wonz, Truth, and On the House. Jefferson&#x27;s deep house productions include songs by CeCe Rogers and Sterling Void, and Ten City&#x27;s first two albums. In March 1987, the British music magazine &quot;NME&quot; reported that Jefferson and Frankie Knuckles were in the UK for the first house-music tour.

&quot;Move Your Body&quot; appeared in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, playing on house-music radio station SF-UR. This song also appeared in Michael Winterbottom&#x27;s film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; and in the 1991 documentary film &quot;Paris Is Burning&quot;.

Jefferson took a break from music in 1990, then returned to DJing in 1993. He moved to Billericay in Essex where he had a five-year residency with the Tribal Gathering and Big Love events.

Jefferson now lives in Manchester, England and released a remixed version of &quot;Move Your Body&quot; (credited to Marshall Jefferson x Solardo, with the latter being a Mancunian production duo made up of Mark Richards &amp; James Eliot) in 2019. The remix was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in 2023.

In 2021, he teamed up again with Byron Stingily to release &quot;Be Free&quot;, the first single in 25 years to be credited to Stingily&#x27;s house music group Ten City.

Jefferson is featured in Episode 3 of the 2024 PBS series &quot;Disco: Soundtrack of a Revolution&quot;.

<doc id="1068054" wikidata="Q5579622" url="?curid=1068054" title="Golden Lamb Inn">
<text>The Golden Lamb Inn is the oldest hotel in Ohio, having been established in the Warren County seat of Lebanon in 1803. It opened as a log tavern, licensed as &quot;a house of Public Entertainment&quot; located on the main street of Lebanon. The present four-story structure is built around the 1815 rebuilding of the inn, maintaining its colonial architecture. It is known as the Golden Lamb because that image appeared on its signboard for the benefit of the illiterate. At various times it has been known as the Ownly Hotel, the Bradley House, the Lebanon House, and the Stubbs House.

On January 12, 1978, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Golden Lamb.

==Famous guests==
Because of Lebanon&#x27;s position on the highway between Cincinnati and Columbus, many notables have visited the inn. The Golden Lamb has been visited by twelve American Presidents: William Henry Harrison, Benjamin Harrison, John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren, Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, Warren G. Harding, William Howard Taft, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush.

Other famous guests to visit the Golden Lamb include Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Daniel Webster, Thomas Corwin, Clement Vallandigham (who infamously shot and killed himself accidentally in his hotel room at the Golden Lamb, while attempting to prove that a man, whom his client was accused of shooting, shot himself accidentally), Cordell Hull secretary of state for President Franklin D. Roosevelt (who went to school in Lebanon at the National Normal University), Robert A. Taft, Dewitt Clinton, and Lord Stanley, who later became prime minister of the United Kingdom. More recently, on September 8, 2008 Republican presidential and vice-presidential candidates senator John McCain and Alaska governor Sarah Palin spoke at the Golden Lamb.

==Owners==
Jonas Seaman of New Jersey was the log tavern&#x27;s builder and first operator. Debts forced him to sell during the 1810&#x27;s. Ichabod Corwin, one of Lebanon&#x27;s founders, bought the old Seaman tavern. Corwin built a fine brick hostel replacing the old log structure. In 1926, Robert Jones, grandfather of Senator Rob Portman and husband of Virginia Kunkle leased the Golden Lamb. In 1927, he refurbished it and redecorated it with Shaker furniture. In 1969, Mr. and Mrs. Jones leased the Golden Lamb to the Comisar family, who owned and operated the now defunct five-star Maisonette restaurant in Cincinnati. The Golden Lamb Restaurant &amp; Hotel continues to be owned by the Portman Family of Ohio.

==The building==
*Four floors
*Lobby
*Restaurant with a tavern, three large public dining rooms, and five private dining rooms
*Gift shop 
*Seventeen guest rooms 
*The old stables were removed to make room for the parking lot

<doc id="1068059" wikidata="Q23193275" url="?curid=1068059" title="Ravenna, Seattle">
<text>Ravenna is a neighborhood in northeastern Seattle, Washington named after Ravenna, Italy. Though Ravenna is considered a residential neighborhood, it also is home to several businesses, many of which are located in the University Village, a shopping mall.

Ravenna Park, located near University Village and the walking or biking route connecting Green Lake to Burke–Gilman Trail, is located within the neighborhood.

== Ravenna and Ravenna-Bryant ==
What is now Ravenna has been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period (c. 8000 BCE–10,000 years ago). The Native American Duwamish (before contact, the &quot;Dkhw’Duw’Absh&quot;, &quot;the People of the Inside&quot;) tribe of the Lushootseed (Skagit-Nisqually) Coast Salish nations had the prominent village of &quot;SWAH-tsoo-gweel&quot; (&quot;portage&quot;) on then-adjacent Union Bay, and what is now Ravenna was their backyard before the arrival of White settlers. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway was built c. 1886 along what is now the Burke-Gilman Trail, following what was the shoreline past where the UW power plant and University Village are today. In 1890 mining and real estate magnate William Wirt Beck (1851-1944) filed the first plat on the 400 acres of land he owned covering most of the modern-day neighborhood, with the intention of creating an ideal community where his own home was one of the first to be built (and still stands several blocks East of the park). That same year he established the Seattle Female College, with classes held in Beck&#x27;s home. Placement of churches and other civic structures would be modeled after the townsite&#x27;s namesake, Ravenna, Italy. King County&#x27;s first grist mill was also established at Ravenna in 1890 by the Ravenna Flouring Mill Company who built their mill along the railroad grade. 70 acres comprising old growth timber protected by a ravine were preserved by Beck for use as a park that would later become Ravenna Park. In 1891, a streetcar line followed 14th Avenue NE (what is now University Way NE, as illustrated in the Cowen&#x27;s University Park Addition Seattle annex map below on this page), then followed near the southern boundary of what is now Ravenna Park, where the narrow right-of-way remains clearly visible beside the park. Ravenna Boulevard was built in 1903 as a small part of the Olmsted Brothers&#x27; grand plan for Seattle streets and parks.
Ravenna incorporated as an independent town in 1906, which permitted Seattle to annex it in 1907. The original boundary of the Town of Ravenna when it was annexed extended from 15th Avenue NE eastward to 20th Avenue NE (above 65th Street NE) and eastward to 30th Ave NE (south of 65th Street NE), bounded on the south by 55th Street. Ravenna south of the Burke-Gilman Trail is filled land from dump sites at 26th Avenue, filling the drained Union Bay Marsh and much of Union Bay. University Village (1956) was built on the southernmost reclaimed land in Ravenna.

Ravenna is bounded on the west by 15th and 20th Avenues NE, beyond which lies the Roosevelt neighborhood; on the north by NE 75th and 85th Streets, beyond which lie Maple Leaf and Wedgwood; on the east by 35th and 25th Avenues NE, beyond which lie View Ridge, Windermere and Laurelhurst; and on the south by NE Ravenna Boulevard, and NE Blakeley or NE 45th Streets, beyond which lie the University District and sometimes University Village (boundaries are informal). University Village and Calvary Cemetery are in south Ravenna.

The adjacent Bryant neighborhood, or Ravenna-Bryant, extends the neighborhood east to 45th Avenue NE, south of NE 75th Street and north of Sand Point Way NE.

The principal arterial is 25th Avenue NE; minor arterials are 15th and 35th Avenues NE, and NE 65th Street; 40th Avenue NE and NE 55th Street are collector arterials. Besides the eponymous boulevard, arguably its most well-known street is Candy Cane Lane. On the length of Park Road (one block and a little roundabout) residents have been creating an elaborate Christmas display since 1951, bringing bumper-to-bumper traffic to the boulevard on December nights. The 20th Avenue NE collector arterial has become increasingly bike- and pedestrian-friendly with the closure of the park bridge to motor vehicles (1975). NE Ravenna Boulevard is a local bikeway.

An eponymous grocery has been at the same location on the boulevard since the 1920s. Most emblematic of the neighborhood are Queen Mary, serving Victorian English Tea, and the Duchess Tavern (1934). The only Volvo dealership in town is family-owned and in Ravenna-Bryant.

The accompanying photograph shows an area around the railroad depot in the late 19th century. Between the depot and the mill could now be 25th Avenue NE at the Burke-Gilman Trail. Left of the mill is the Ravenna Depot, center. The straight road left continues past Roper&#x27;s Grocery on 24th Street, just left of the tree, left of center, to what is now the SE corner of Ravenna Park, behind the house between the foreground trees. Behind the hamlet of Ravenna, middle background, is the new Seattle Female College (c. 1890), &quot;non-sectarian, distinctly Christian&quot;, and including the Seattle Conservatory of Music and Ravenna Seminary. The stable for the college is beyond the depot. Left of the college and above the small foreground snag, faintly, is a broad side of the Phillips house, still extant today.

==Ravenna-Cowen Park==
The conjoined Cowen Park and Ravenna Park is located at a southwest corner of Ravenna-Bryant, reaching from beyond the source of Ravenna Creek beside nearby Brooklyn Avenue and Ravenna Boulevard, under the 15th Avenue bridge to 25th Avenue NE. The parks comprise the centerpiece of the neighborhood.

For many decades of Seattle city history, the park ravine had been ignored by loggers and farmers and still possessed full old-growth timber rising nearly 400 feet. The trees remained through the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition of 1908, at which they were featured exhibitions. Public controversy about them declined after their gradual disappearance in suspicious circumstances by 1926. Today, none of that size remain anywhere in the world. The legacy helped save Seward and Carkeek parks, and helped galvanize conservation efforts ever since. Today, a single Sierra Redwood stands over the Medicinal Herb Garden at a south edge of the UW campus, at 106 feet somewhat over a quarter of the height of those of Cowen Park-Ravenna Park.

===Ravenna Creek===

Projects have included daylighting portions of the creek (partly with the goal of restoring native fish runs), building and maintaining trails, and restoring riparian habitat, sometimes in collaboration with the University of Washington&#x27;s environmental science program. Completion of downstream daylighting to the mouth of the creek beside Union Bay Natural Area and restoration of migrating fish has come into conflict with property owners, specifically the owners of University Village, even though a revised daylighting project would not include their land.

<text>Bleddyn Llewellyn Williams MBE (22 February 1923 – 6 July 2009), was a Welsh rugby union centre. He played in 22 internationals for Wales, captaining them five times, winning each time, and captained the British Lions in 1950 for some of their tour of Australia and New Zealand. Considered to be the nonpareil of Welsh centres; he was robust in the tackle and known for his strong leadership and surging runs; he was often referred to as &#x27;The Prince Of Centres&#x27;.

==Biography==
Born at Taff&#x27;s Well, near Cardiff, he was the third of eight brothers Williams attended Rydal School in Colwyn Bay from the age of 14 until he was 18. He had already played for the Welsh Schoolboys in 1937 when he had been recommended for a scholarship to Rydal by legendary rugby player Wilf Wooller. At Rydal he played at outside half and was seen as one of the school&#x27;s star players and managed to play for Cardiff Athletic during the 1938/39 season before the outbreak of the war. He worked for the Steel Company of Wales.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War he joined the Royal Air Force. Trained as a fighter pilot in Arizona, he was switched to and trained as a glider pilot, attached to the Glider Pilot Regiment.

Williams took part in various Commando and Parachute Regiment campaigns, piloting a glider in Operation Varsity – the crossing of the River Rhine into Germany – with a cargo of medical and radio supplies. He then spent a week sleeping rough, before bumping into his commanding officer, Hugh Bartlett DFC, the Sussex County Cricket Club batsman, on a Friday morning: &quot;Williams aren&#x27;t you meant to be at Welford Road tomorrow playing for Great Britain against the Dominions? They need you. Go now!&quot; Williams caught the last supply plane to RAF Brize Norton that night, and although the team didn&#x27;t win he did score a try. He couldn&#x27;t win the match but did score a glorious try. He turned out for both the RAF and the Great Britain United rugby teams.

===Rugby career===
During war-time Williams joined Cardiff and switched his position to centre. He was offered £6,000 to play rugby league for Leeds but turned down the offer He forged a famous centre partnership for Cardiff with Dr Jack Matthews and along with Billy Cleaver they made one of the most formidable midfield trios the club has ever produced. Each of Bleddyn&#x27;s seven brothers also played for Cardiff, and his younger brother Lloyd represented Wales in the 1960s. At one time four of the siblings played in the same Cardiff team together and between them had a Cardiff career that spanned thirty years. Bleddyn Williams played 283 games for Cardiff and scored 185 tries for the club, including a club record 41 tries in the 1947–48 season.

===International career===
Williams made his debut for Wales in January 1947 against as a fly-half, playing alongside Haydn Tanner. He went on to win a further 21 Welsh caps, all as a centre, making his final appearance against in January 1955. He scored seven tries, for a total of 21 points in internationals. Williams captained Wales in five matches, four times in 1953 and once in 1955, in his final international. He led the side to victory in all five games.
In 1953 he had the unique distinction of captaining his club (Cardiff), and his country (Wales), to victory against the touring New Zealand All Blacks.

Williams was a member of the 1950 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia and played three of the four tests against (missing the first test through injury) and both tests against . He captained the Lions in the third and fourth tests against New Zealand, deputising for the injured captain Karl Mullen. Williams scored one international try for the Lions, in the first test against Australia.

===Later life===
After injury forced him to retire at the age of 32 in 1955, Williams began a career in the media, establishing himself as an authoritative commentator on the game. He was the rugby union correspondent of the &quot;Sunday People&quot; for 30 years.

He was made an MBE in the 2005 New Year Honours list, an award he accepted with typical modesty by saying he owed it to his team mates.

He was the president of Cardiff Athletic Club

===Personal life===
Post war, Williams married Violet; the couple had a son and two daughters. In 1979, Violet gave Williams the Kiss of Life after he collapsed with an embolism. Violet later died of cancer. On 6 July 2009, Williams died at the Holme Tower medical centre in Cardiff, after suffering ill health for some time.

<doc id="1068073" wikidata="Q2332695" url="?curid=1068073" title="Charles Ricketts">
<text>Charles de Sousy Ricketts (2 October 1866 – 7 October 1931) was a British artist, illustrator, author and printer, known for his work as a book designer and typographer and for his costume and scenery designs for plays and operas.

Ricketts was born in Geneva to an English father and a French mother and brought up mainly in France. In 1882 he began studying wood engraving in London, where he met a fellow student, Charles Shannon, who became his lifelong companion and artistic collaborator. Ricketts first made his mark in book production, first as an illustrator, and then as the founder and driving force of the Vale Press (1896–1904), one of the leading private presses of the day, for which he designed the type and illustrations. A disastrous fire at the printers led to the closure of the press, and Ricketts turned increasingly to painting and sculpture over the following two decades.

In 1906 he also began a career as a theatre designer, first for works by his friend Oscar Wilde and later for plays by writers including Aeschylus, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, William Shakespeare, Bernard Shaw, and W. B. Yeats. His most enduring theatre designs, which remained in use for more than 50 years, were for Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Mikado&quot;. With Shannon, Ricketts built up a substantial collection of paintings, drawings and sculpture. He established a reputation as an art connoisseur, and in 1915 turned down the offer of the directorship of the National Gallery. He later regretted that decision, but served as adviser to the National Gallery of Canada from 1924 until his death. He wrote three books of art criticism, two volumes of short stories and a memoir of Wilde. Selections from his letters and diaries were posthumously published.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Ricketts was born in Geneva, the only son of Charles Robert Ricketts (1838–1883) and Hélène Cornélie de Soucy (1833 or 1834–1880), daughter of Louis, Marquis de Soucy. He had a sister, Blanche (1868–1903). His father had served as a First Lieutenant in the Royal Navy before being invalided out at age 25 due to wounds. It was an artistic household: his father was an amateur painter of marine subjects, and his mother was musical. Ricketts spent his early childhood in Lausanne and London, and his early teens in Boulogne and Amiens. Except for a year at a boarding-school near Tours he was educated by governesses.

Hélène Ricketts died in 1880 and her widower moved to London with his two children. Ricketts was at that stage hardly able to speak English. His biographer Paul Delaney writes that the boy was considered &quot;too delicate to attend school&quot;, and consequently was largely self-educated, &quot;reading voraciously and &#x27;basking&#x27; in museums; he thus escaped being moulded along conventional lines&quot;.
In 1882 Ricketts entered the City and Guilds Technical Art School in Kennington, London, where he was apprenticed to Charles Roberts, a prominent wood-engraver. The following year Ricketts&#x27;s father died, and Ricketts became dependent on his paternal grandfather, who supported him with a modest allowance. On his sixteenth birthday he met the painter and lithographer Charles Haslewood Shannon, with whom he formed a lifelong personal and professional partnership. &quot;The Times&quot; described their relationship:
===The Vale Press===
After concluding their studies at Kennington, the two men considered going to live and work in Paris, as several of their contemporaries had done. They consulted Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, an artist they revered, who advised them against it, considering the current trends of French art to be excessively naturalistic – &quot;photographic drawing&quot;. Shannon, three years the senior, took a teaching post at the Croydon School of Art, and Ricketts earned money from commercial and magazine illustrations.
In 1888 Ricketts took over James Abbott Whistler&#x27;s former house, No 1, The Vale, in Chelsea, which became the focus of contemporary artists. They produced &quot;The Dial&quot;, a magazine devoted to art, that had five issues from 1889 to 1897. Among their circle was Oscar Wilde, for whom Ricketts illustrated his books &quot;A House of Pomegranates&quot; (1891) and &quot;The Sphinx&quot; (1894), and painted, in the style of François Clouet, the hero of Wilde&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Portrait of Mr. W. H.&quot; used as the frontispiece of the book. Ricketts and Shannon worked together on editions of &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot; (1893) and &quot;Hero and Leander&quot; (1894). Reviewing the former, &quot;The Times&quot; singled out the &quot;beautiful type [and] the very charming woodcuts and initial letters with which it is enriched by two accomplished artists, Mr. Charles Ricketts and Mr. Charles Shannon, who are jointly responsible for the designs, while the actual woodcut execution is the work of Mr. Ricketts.&quot;

Inspired by the work of A. H. Mackmurdo and William Morris&#x27;s Kelmscott Press, Ricketts and Shannon set up a small press over which, according to the critic Emmanuel Cooper, Ricketts exercised complete control of design and production. He told Lucien Pissarro that he intended &quot;to do for the book something in the line of what William Morris did for furniture&quot;. Cooper writes that Ricketts designed founts, initials, borders and illustrations for the press, &quot;blending medieval, Renaissance and contemporary imagery&quot;. His woodcut illustrations &quot;often incorporated the swirling lines of Art Nouveau and androgynous figures&quot;. The Vale Press, which existed between 1896 and 1904, published more than eighty volumes, mostly reprints of English poetic classics, and earned a reputation as &quot;one of the big six amongst modern presses&quot;. Initially, Ricketts financed the Vale publications by inviting subscriptions, but in 1894 its finances were put on a more secure footing when he was introduced to a rich barrister, William Llewellyn Hacon, who invested £1,000 and became Ricketts&#x27;s business partner in the firm. A fire at the printers in 1904 destroyed the press&#x27;s woodcuts, and Ricketts and Shannon decided to abandon publishing and turn to other work. They closed the Vale Press and threw the type into the river. Ricketts marked the demise of the press by publishing a complete bibliography of its publications. Thereafter, he occasionally designed books for friends such as Michael Field (the joint pen name of Katherine Harris and Emma Cooper) and Gordon Bottomley.

===Paintings and sculpture===
Ricketts increasingly turned to painting and sculpture. A later painter, Thomas Lowinsky, has commented on how different Ricketts&#x27;s styles were as a book designer on the one hand and as a painter on the other: &quot;his books expressed in their pre-Raphaelitism the English side of his character, whilst his pictures, with their debt to Delacroix and Gustave Moreau, the French&quot;. Delaney cites Symbolist influences, seen in his choice of themes: 
:tragic and romantic... focused on key moments in the destiny of his subjects, such as Salome, Cleopatra, Don Juan, Montezuma, and (though Ricketts was a non-believer) Christ, figures he admired for the way they courageously met their fates.
Delaney ranks among Ricketts&#x27;s best paintings &quot;The Betrayal of Christ&quot; (1904); &quot;Don Juan and the Statue&quot; (1905) and &quot;The Death of Don Juan&quot; (1911); &quot;Bacchus in India&quot; (c.1913); &quot; The Wise and Foolish Virgins&quot; (c. 1913); &quot;The Death of Montezuma&quot; (c. 1915); and &quot;The Return of Judith&quot; (1919), and &quot;Jepthah&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1924). At least one of Ricketts&#x27;s paintings – &quot;The Plague&quot; – is in a continental gallery, the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, Paris. In Delaney&#x27;s view, Ricketts&#x27;s considerable scholarship was a mixed blessing as his deep knowledge of earlier painters sometimes inhibited his work, both as a painter and as a sculptor. The influence of Rodin is seen in Ricketts&#x27;s sculptures, which number about twenty and include &quot;Silence&quot;, a memorial to Wilde. Delaney finds more power in Ricketts&#x27;s bronzes, citing &quot;Orpheus and Eurydice&quot; (Tate collection) and &quot;Paolo and Francesca&quot; (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge) as striking interpretations of their subjects. A contemporary critic remarked that despite their &quot;unusually beautiful colour&quot; and &quot;curious but definite, half-literary, half-pictorial appeal&quot;, Rickett&#x27;s paintings were &quot;probably the least important and satisfactory part of the output of a man who was undoubtedly one of the most gifted, versatile, and outstanding in the world of art of his day&quot;.

In 1915 Ricketts was offered the directorship of the National Gallery, but having controversial views on how the gallery&#x27;s paintings ought to be shown he turned down the post, which he later regretted. Although never formally employed by the gallery he was nevertheless consulted about some of the hangings of the rooms. He had been approached about letting his name go forward for nomination to the Royal Academy in 1905, but declined out of concern that Shannon might feel slighted. Shannon was elected as a member in 1920, and Ricketts followed, as an associate member in 1922, and a full member in 1928. In 1929 he was appointed a member of the Royal Fine Arts Commission. He was also a member of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers, and served as art adviser to the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa from 1924 to 1931.

===Theatre design===
Ricketts became a celebrated designer for the stage. &quot;Mr Ricketts is infallible in his ideas on costume&quot; observed &quot;The Times&quot;. His career as a theatre designer lasted from 1906 to 1931. He began by working on a double bill of Wilde plays – &quot;Salome&quot; and &quot;A Florentine Tragedy&quot; – at the King&#x27;s Hall, Covent Garden, given as a private production because Wilde&#x27;s biblical drama was refused a licence for public performance. For the same company Ricketts designed Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;The Persians&quot; in 1907, for which his costumes and scenery received considerably better notices than the play. For the commercial theatre during the 1900s Ricketts designed Laurence Binyon&#x27;s &quot;Attila&quot; (with Oscar Asche at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre), &quot;Electra&quot; by Hofmannsthal (with Mrs Patrick Campbell at the New Theatre, 1908), and &quot;King Lear&quot; (with Norman McKinnel, at the Haymarket, 1909). During the 1910s he designed Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Lady of the Sonnets&quot; (1910), Arnold Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Judith&quot; (1916), and Shaw&#x27;s Annajanska, the Bolshevik Empress (1918).
After the First World War Ricketts resumed his theatrical activity, and designed &quot;The Betrothal&quot;, by Maurice Maeterlinck (with Gladys Cooper) at the Gaiety Theatre (1921), Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Saint Joan&quot; (with Sybil Thorndike) at the New Theatre (1924), &quot;Henry VIII&quot; (with Lewis Casson and Thorndike) at the Empire Theatre (1925) and &quot;Macbeth&quot; (with Henry Ainley, Thorndyke and Casson) at the Princes Theatre (1926). In the same year he designed costumes and scenery for the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company&#x27;s production of &quot;The Mikado&quot; at the Savoy Theatre, and did the same in 1929 for their &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; at the same theatre. Most of Ricketts&#x27;s costume designs for &quot;The Mikado&quot; were retained by subsequent designers of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte productions for more than 50 years.

Outside London, Ricketts worked for the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, in 1912 on plays by W. B. Yeats and J. M. Synge, and designed John Masefield&#x27;s &quot;The Coming of Christ&quot;, staged in Canterbury Cathedral in 1928. His final theatre designs were for Ferdinand Bruckner&#x27;s &quot;Elizabeth of England&quot; (with Phyllis Neilson-Terry at the Cambridge Theatre, London (1931) and Donald Tovey&#x27;s opera &quot;The Bride of Dionysus&quot;, which was staged in Edinburgh after Ricketts&#x27;s death.

After Ricketts&#x27;s death the National Art Collections Fund bought a collection of his drawings for theatrical costumes and scenery, and arranged for them to be exhibited at galleries in London and throughout Britain. Twelve of the drawings were shown in the Winter Exhibition of the Royal Academy, and a selection of eighty from the remainder of the drawings was shown at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

===Collector and writer===

Together with Shannon, Ricketts accumulated a collection of drawings and paintings (French, English, and old masters), Greek and Egyptian antiquities, Persian miniatures, and Japanese prints and drawings. The collection was bequeathed to public art galleries, principally the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.

Ricketts achieved some success as a writer. He published two monographs: &quot;The Prado and its Masterpieces&quot; (1903), and &quot;Titian&quot; (1910). Delaney comments that although superseded by modern scholarship, they remain &quot;among the most evocative books on art in English&quot;. &quot;Pages on Art&quot;, a selection of Ricketts&#x27;s essays and articles for publications including &quot;The Burlington Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Morning Post&quot;, was published in 1913. It covered an eclectic range of subjects including Charles Conder, Shannon, post-impressionism, Puvis de Chavannes, G. F. Watts, Chinese and Japanese art, and stage design.

Under the pen-name Jean Paul Raymond, Ricketts wrote and designed two collections of short stories, &quot;Beyond the Threshold&quot; (1928) and &quot;Unrecorded Histories&quot; (1933). Under the same pseudonym he wrote &quot;Recollections of Oscar Wilde&quot; (1932), a highly personal memoir, published after his death; it was described by &quot;The Observer&quot; as &quot;a loyal and sensitive commemoration&quot; of the man Ricketts regarded as the most remarkable he had met. After Ricketts&#x27;s death Cecil Lewis edited selections from the artist&#x27;s letters and diaries, which were published as &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; in 1939.

===Last years and legacy===
Ricketts&#x27;s last years were overshadowed by the illness of Shannon. They had remained together since they first met, despite several affairs Shannon had with women. While hanging a picture at their house in Regent&#x27;s Park in January 1929, Shannon fell and suffered permanent brain damage. To pay for Shannon&#x27;s care Ricketts sold some of their collection. Delaney writes that the strain of the situation, compounded by overwork, contributed to Ricketts&#x27;s death.

On 7 October 1931 Ricketts died suddenly, aged 65, from angina pectoris at the Regent&#x27;s Park house. A memorial service was held at St James&#x27;s, Piccadilly, on 12 October, attended by many from the art world including Robert Anning Bell, Alfred Drury, Gerald Kelly, Sir John Lavery, Henry Macbeth-Raeburn and Julius Olsson. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium; his ashes were partly scattered in Richmond Park, London, and the remainder buried at Arolo, Lake Maggiore, Italy. Shannon outlived him by six years.

Ricketts was celebrated in a BBC television programme, &quot;Poverty and Oysters&quot;, with reminiscences by Kenneth Clark and Cecil Lewis (1979), and a BBC Radio 3 programme, &quot;Between Ourselves&quot; (1991), with reminiscences by Lewis (by then a nonagenarian) and featuring John Gielgud as Ricketts and T. P. McKenna as Bernard Shaw. Ricketts is portrayed in Michael MacLennan&#x27;s 2003 play &quot;Last Romantics&quot;, based on the life of Ricketts, Shannon and their circle, including Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley.

<text>Lufthansa Flight 540 was a scheduled commercial flight for Lufthansa, serving the Frankfurt–Nairobi–Johannesburg route.

On 20 November 1974, the Boeing 747-130 that was operating as Flight 540 was carrying 157 people (139 passengers and 18 crew members) crashed and caught fire shortly after taking off from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, Kenya, for the last leg of the flight, resulting in the deaths of 54 passengers and 5 crew members. The crash was the first fatal accident involving a Boeing 747, and it remains the deadliest crash in the history of Lufthansa. It also remains as the deadliest aviation accident to occur in Kenya.

==Aircraft and crew== 
The aircraft involved was a Boeing 747-130 registered as D-ABYB and was named &quot;Hessen.&quot; It was the second 747 to be delivered to Lufthansa. It first flew on 30 March 1970 and was delivered to Lufthansa on 13 April. The aircraft was powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7 turbofan engines. The aircraft had 16,781 flying hours at the time of the accident.
In command was 53-year-old Captain Christian Krack (who had logged 10,464 flight hours, with 1,619 hours on the Boeing 747), 35-year-old First Officer Hans-Joachim Schacke (3,418 flight hours, 2,237 of which were logged on the Boeing 747) and 51-year-old Flight Engineer Rudolf &quot;Rudi&quot; Hahn (13,000 hours of flying experience). The cabin crew consisted of 14 regular flight attendants and 1 assistant stewardess, who was responsible for childcare. Lufthansa only offered the so-called Mickey Mouse Service on the route from Frankfurt to Johannesburg.

==Accident==
As the aircraft was making its takeoff from runway 24 at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, the pilots felt a buffeting vibration. The captain continued the climb and retracted the landing gear. However, as this was being done, the aircraft started to descend and the stall warning system light came on. The aircraft continued to descend and approximately from the end of the runway, the 747 airplane crashed in the grass. It then struck an elevated access road and broke up. The left wing exploded and fire spread to the fuselage. 54 of the 139 passengers and 5 of the 18 crew members died. The three pilots survived the accident.

==Cause==
The cause of the accident was determined to be a stall caused by the leading edge slats (strictly speaking, outboard variable camber leading-edge slats and inboard Krueger flaps) having been left in the retracted position. Even though the trailing edge flaps were deployed, without the slats being extended the aircraft&#x27;s stall speed was higher and the maximum angle of attack was lower. As a result, the aircraft was unable to climb out of ground effect. The flight engineer was found to have failed to open the slat system bleed air valves as required on the pre-flight checklist. This prevented bleed air from flowing to the 747&#x27;s pneumatic slat system and, since the leading edge slats on the 747 are pneumatically driven, kept it from deploying the leading edge slats for takeoff. The takeoff warning system, which would have sounded an alarm if the flaps had not been set for takeoff, did not have a separate warning that the slats&#x27; pneumatic valve had not been opened by the flight engineer.

The faulty state of the slats should by design have been indicated by yellow warning lights: one for the pilot, and eight for the flight engineer. However, both crew members stated in court that these lights had been green. Three possible explanations have since been offered for this inconsistency: that the morning sun was blinding the cockpit crew and thus hampered color perception, that a construction error could have caused green lights despite the retracted slats, and that the crew lied. None of these possibilities could be conclusively proven. The flight crew was blamed for not performing a satisfactory pre-takeoff checklist, but the accident report also faulted the lack of adequate warning systems that could have alerted the crew to the problem. Two previous occurrences of this error had been reported, but in those cases the pilots had been able to recover the aircraft in time. After this third, deadly incident, Boeing added systems to warn pilots if the slat valve had not been opened prior to takeoff.

Captain Krack and flight engineer Hahn were dismissed from Lufthansa shortly after, but their dismissals were overturned by a labor court, as no investigation report was available to rule out the possibility of a technical defect.

Flight engineer Hahn was charged with criminal negligence, but was acquitted in 1981. The accident was the first fatal crash involving a Boeing 747.

However, there are reliable indications that Lufthansa was already aware of possible problems with (false) displays concerning the slats a good six months before the Nairobi crash. Other airlines such as British Airways therefore equipped their aircraft with an additional warning system, which Lufthansa did not.

<text>Fort Smith ( &quot;beside the rapids&quot;) is a town in the South Slave Region of the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. It is located in the southeastern portion of the Northwest Territories, on the Slave River and adjacent to the Alberta border along the 60th parallel north.

== History ==
Fort Smith was founded around the Slave River. It served a vital link for water transportation between southern Canada and the western Arctic. Early fur traders found a portage route, long established by indigenous peoples, from what is now Fort Fitzgerald on the western bank of the Slave River to Fort Smith. This route allowed its users to bypass the four sets of impassable rapids (Cassette Rapids, Pelican Rapids, Mountain Rapids, and Rapids of the Drowned). The portage trail had been traditionally used for centuries by generations of local Indigenous peoples.

The make up of the Indigenous population of the region shifted as the fortunes of the tribes changed. By 1870, the Slavey had moved north and the Cree had occupied the Slave River Valley. The Chipewyan had also begun moving into the area.

Peter Pond of the North West Company was the first white trader recorded to have traveled on the Slave River and made contact with Indigenous peoples in this region. In the 1780s he established a post on Lake Athabasca called Fort Chipewyan, at the head of the Slave River.
Dominated by the activities of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, the fur trade penetrated more deeply into the Mackenzie River district in the 19th century. York boats were used to run the Slave River rapids and, where needed, small portages were established to bypass the most dangerous areas. Nonetheless, serious mishaps were bound to happen. This section of the Slave River became known as &#x27;The Rapids of the Drowned&#x27;. 

In 1872, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company built an outpost called Smith&#x27;s Landing (Fort Fitzgerald) at the most southern set of the Slave River rapids. In 1874, another outpost was constructed at the most northern set of rapids. It was called Fort Smith. Both posts were named in honour of Donald Alexander Smith, who in August 1897, was elevated to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as The 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal.

In 1876, the Roman Catholic Mission was moved from Salt River to Fort Smith while the community was prospering.

In 1886, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company launched the steam-propelled vessel SS &quot;Wrigley&quot; to run from Fort Smith to the Mackenzie River. The steamer ran the Slave River from Fort McMurray to the head of the rapids at Smith&#x27;s Landing beginning in 1882.
In 1898, the Yukon Gold Rush brought many gold seekers over the portages and through Fort Smith. In 1908, a new HBC steamer paddlewheeler, SS &quot;Mackenzie River&quot;, was launched to operate on the Slave and Mackenzie rivers below Fort Smith (see boats of the Mackenzie River watershed).

In 1911, government was established in Fort Smith when Ottawa sent an Indian agent and a regional medical doctor, and the Royal Northwest Mounted Police opened a detachment. With these developments, Fort Smith became not only the transportation centre for the western Arctic but the administrative centre as well.

The mission sawmill produced lumber for the first hospital, St. Anne&#x27;s, built in 1914 for the Grey Nuns. The sawmill also supplied the lumber for the first school, built in 1915. The Roman Catholic Mission also operated St. Bruno&#x27;s Farm, which supplied produce, meat, and dairy products. Until it was closed in the 1920s, the farm supplied all the church&#x27;s missions in the western Arctic. Its workers maintained a herd of more than 140 cattle.

Horse-drawn freight services were complemented by tractors in 1919, when the Alberta &amp; Arctic Transportation Company, a subsidiary of Lamson &amp; Hubbard Trading Company, commissioned two tractors on the Slave River portage to haul commercial freight from one side of the rapids to the other.

With the discovery of oil at Norman Wells in 1920, a federal government administration building was constructed to house the new Northwest Territories branch and the first court of justice in the Mackenzie District. The Union Bank of Canada, making use of a tent, opened the first bank in the Northwest Territories in Fort Smith in June 1921.
In 1920 the Lamson &amp; Hubbard Trading Company launched &quot;Distributor&quot; to service its trading posts along the Mackenzie River. This group was taken over by the HBC in 1924. By the 1930s, a significant part of the Fort Smith economy was centred around ship and barge building. The HBC and Northern Transportation Company Limited (NTCL) established shipyards below Fort Smith.

Wood Buffalo National Park was established in 1922; its operations and administration headquarters were in Fort Smith.

In 1924, Fort Smith received the first of the Northwest Territories and Yukon Radio System installed by the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals. In 1928, Fort Smith Airport was built.

The discovery of gold in Yellowknife in 1938 was a catalyst for an economic boost to Fort Smith, as many prospectors came passing through and bought supplies at the post. In the same year, an Anglican Mission house was built; a church was built in 1939.

In 1942–1943, Fort Smith played a small part in the war effort when huge armies raged across the globe in the Second World War. With a population of 250, Fort Smith hosted 2,000 United States Army soldiers who were en route to the Canol Oil Pipeline Project at Norman Wells and the Canol Road. They brought hundreds of barge loads of supplies; and in order to move these, they built a tractor road from Fort Smith to Hay River and even farther north.

The continued gold fever that fuelled Yellowknife&#x27;s growth also stimulated the five-fold growth of Fort Smith&#x27;s population in the decade following 1945. Government administrative facilities were increased to keep up with population needs and the village developed as a transportation hub for the Mackenzie District.

Fort Smith was incorporated as a village in 1964; two years later, with a population of 2,130, the village became a town on October 1, 1966. The all-weather road to Hay River was officially completed in 1966, permanently linking Fort Smith to the south.

The completion of a southern rail link to Hay River in 1964 meant that Fort Smith&#x27;s role as the transportation hub was largely negated. Shipping operations on the Slave River ceased in 1968.

When Yellowknife was designated as the territorial capital in 1967, Fort Smith was kept as the administrative centre of the government of the Northwest Territories&#x27; vast region. See history of Northwest Territories capital cities.

On Friday August 9, 1968, disaster struck Fort Smith when a landslide some broke away from the riverbank; it caused property damage and killed one person. The riverbank area has since been sloped to stabilize it. Reshaped as a gentle hillside, it is known as Riverbank Park, and features groomed trails, picnic areas, and a viewing platform to oversee the Rapids of the Drowned.

In 1970, the Adult Vocational Training Centre was opened. Its operations were later expanded and in 1981 it became Thebacha College. A few years later, Arctic College was created by the government of the Northwest Territories. The Thebacha Campus was home to government headquarters offices. In 1995, the college changed its name to Aurora College in order to allow Nunavut the use of the Arctic College name for their tribal college.

Today, Fort Smith&#x27;s economy is based on the federal, territorial, and aboriginal governments, along with education and tourism. In 2008, interest began to develop to re-establish a portage route to supply the Fort McMurray oilsands operations by river.

== Geography ==
The town is approximately southeast of Yellowknife, the territorial capital. The park headquarters for Wood Buffalo National Park is located in Fort Smith.

<text>Ian Scott Gibbs (born 23 January 1971) is a Welsh former rugby footballer who has represented Wales and the Lions in rugby union and Wales and Great Britain in rugby league. Noted feats included his performance in the 1997 British Lions tour to South Africa (in which he was named &quot;Player of the Series&quot;) and the individual try he scored in the dying minutes of the last Five Nations match in 1999 against England.

==Background==
Gibbs was born in Bridgend, Glamorgan, Wales.

==Rugby union==
Gibbs began his rugby career at Pencoed RFC, progressing through the mini and youth levels. His first class career started at Bridgend RFC during the 1990/91 season, followed by a short spell at Neath RFC, before making his Wales debut in 1991 against England. However he transferred to Swansea RFC in January 1992, scoring a try on his debut in a Cup game against Oakdale. Gibbs also scored further tries that season in the cup against Neath RFC and Newport RFC to help Swansea reach the final where they lost to Llanelli RFC at Cardiff Arms Park.

Despite being only 22, he was selected for the 1993 British Lions tour to New Zealand, where he impressed so much that he was selected for the second and third tests instead of then-England captain Will Carling.
==Rugby league==
In 1994 Gibbs left union to join rugby league team St. Helens. While playing league, Gibbs was selected to play for Wales in the 1995 World Cup. He also won the Challenge Cup, and the inaugural Super League title with St. Helens in 1996. He played at centre in the 1996 Challenge Cup final victory over Bradford Bulls.

Scott Gibbs played at in St. Helens&#x27; 16–25 defeat by Wigan in the 1995–96 Regal Trophy Final during the 1995–96 at Alfred McAlpine Stadium, Huddersfield on Saturday 13 January 1996.

==Return to union==
On his return to union in 1996 it was sometimes joked that he was the fastest prop in world rugby, though in fact he was an inside centre. He became known as the world&#x27;s hardest tackler (summed up by his nickname &quot;Car Crash&quot;) and this was exemplified by his performance in his second Lions tour.

In 1997 Gibbs was a key member of the victorious British Lions tour of South Africa. The Springboks were at the time the world champions following the 1995 World Cup, and were expected to win the series. However, the Lions produced some noted defensive performances with Gibbs at the centre of the action pulling off some devastating tackles. In one game, Gibbs crashed through the Springboks&#x27; key player, 19-stone Os du Randt on one of his trademark bullocking runs. The Lions went on to win the series 2–1 and Gibbs was voted &quot;Player of the Series&quot;.

In later years Gibbs was sometimes criticised for being too one-dimensional, but he did show agility to claim the winning try in the last-ever Five Nations match in 1999. Wales were playing England at Wembley with England trying to complete the Grand Slam. England led by 6 points with 3 minutes left to play and appeared to have won the game. However, during injury time (which was added to the 80 minutes in the era prior to the practice of stopping the game clock) Wales had a final attacking line-out from which Gibbs received a Scott Quinnell pass 20m from the try line. Gibbs memorably broke through England&#x27;s defensive line, ran around one defender, side-stepped another and crossed for one of the most celebrated tries in Welsh rugby history.

In a 2013 article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Gibbs said that the play was inspired by a move that his old St Helens teammate Bobbie Goulding had regularly used to great success in the 13-man code, namely packing the midfield with forwards before allowing a back to cut through on a diagonal dummy run. Following Neil Jenkins&#x27; conversion, Wales won the match 32–31 in what is agreed to be one of the best matches played in the competition, and caused England not only to miss out on the Grand Slam, but handed the last Five Nations Championship to Scotland.

In 2001 Gibbs was called up as a replacement to the 2001 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia, though he did not play in any of the Tests.

==Post-retirement==
Gibbs retired from rugby in 2004 at age 33 and went on to contribute to the BBC&#x27;s rugby union coverage. He also coaches the Pirates in Muscat, Oman.

Gibbs resides in Cape Town, South Africa, with his fiancée.

<doc id="1068102" wikidata="Q7245403" url="?curid=1068102" title="Prior-appropriation water rights">
<text>In the American legal system, prior appropriation [[water rights]] is the doctrine that the first person to take a quantity of water from a water source for &quot;beneficial use&quot; (agricultural, industrial or household) has the right to continue to use that quantity of water for that purpose. Subsequent users can take the remaining water for their own use if they do not impinge on the rights of previous users. The doctrine is sometimes summarized, &quot;first in time, first in right&quot;.

Prior appropriation rights do not constitute a full ownership right in the water, merely the right to withdraw it, and can be abrogated if not used for an extended period of time.

==Origin==
Water is very scarce in the West and so must be allocated sparingly, based on the productivity of its use. The prior appropriation doctrine developed in the Western United States from Spanish (and later Mexican) civil law and differs from the riparian water rights that apply in the rest of the United States. The appropriation doctrine originated in Gold-Rush–era California, when miners sought to acquire water for mining operations. In the 1855 case of &quot;Irwin v. Phillips&quot;, Matthew Irwin diverted a stream for his mining operation. Shortly afterward, Robert Phillips started a mining operation downstream and eventually tried to divert the water back to its original streambed. The case was taken to the California Supreme Court, which ruled for Irwin.

==Nature of the right==
The legal details of prior appropriation vary from state to state. Under the prior appropriation system, the right is initially allotted to those who are &quot;first in time of use&quot;; these rights of withdrawal can then trade on the open market, like other property. For water sources with many users, a government or quasi-government agency is usually charged with overseeing allocations. Allocations involving water sources that cross state borders or international borders can be quite contentious, and are generally governed by federal court rulings, interstate agreements and international treaties.

A claim of prior appropriation must prove four sub-claims: diversion (that the water had been withdrawn), priority (that the withdrawer had diverted water prior to the other claimant), intent (that the water had been withdrawn by design), and beneficial use (that the water was put to a publicly-acceptable end). If proved, the initial person to use a quantity of water from a water source for a beneficial use has the right to continue to use the same quantity of water for the same purpose. Subsequent users can use the remaining water for their own beneficial purposes provided that they do not impinge on the rights of previous users; this is the priority element of the doctrine. But neither can a senior user change the manner (i.e., location) in which they appropriate water to the detriment of a junior user. These &quot;Preservation of Conditions&quot; were granted to the second user after &quot;Farmers Highline Canal &amp; Reservoir Co. v. City of Golden&quot;, 272 P.2d 629 (Colo. 1954). A senior water user could, for example, only have been using the water during a particular season. Then the purchaser of the water right could only use the water in the same season as when the right was established. In addition, the state may put additional conditions on the use of the water right to prevent polluting or inefficient uses of water.

Beneficial use is commonly defined as agricultural, industrial or household use. The doctrine has historically excluded ecological purposes, such as maintaining a natural body of water and the wildlife that depends on it, but some jurisdictions now accept such claims. The extent to which private parties may own such rights varies among the states.

Each water right has a yearly quantity and an appropriation date. Each year, the user with the earliest appropriation date (known as the &quot;senior appropriator&quot;) may use up to their full allocation (provided the water source can supply it). Then the user with the next earliest appropriation date may use their full allocation and so on. In cases of water shortages, prior-appropriation does not require a senior user to utilize less water than usual. Therefore, during times of drought, users with junior appropriation dates might not receive their full allocation or even any water at all.

When a water right is sold, it retains its original appropriation date. Only the amount of water historically consumed can be transferred if a water right is sold. For example, if alfalfa is grown using flood irrigation, the amount of the return flow may not be transferred, only the amount that would be necessary to irrigate the amount of alfalfa historically grown.

Prior appropriation rights are subject to certain adverse possession-type rules to reduce speculation. Withdrawal rights can be lost or shrunk over time if unused for a certain number of years, or if a litigant can demonstrate that the water&#x27;s use is not beneficial. Abandonment of a water right is rare, but occurred in Colorado in a case involving the South Fork of San Isabel Creek in Saguache County.

===Interaction with other allocation methods===
In some states, junior upstream water users may take water from downstream users, as long as they return the water in comparable quantity and quality.

California and Texas grant waterfront property owners water allocations prior to any other users, in a hybrid system with riparian water rights. In Oregon, landowners have rights to water on their own land at a certain time at which it is then incorporated into the appropriation system.

== Adoption ==
Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wyoming all use the prior appropriation doctrine, with permitting and reporting as their regulatory system. Of these, California, Texas, and Oregon recognize a dual doctrine system that employs both riparian and prior appropriation rights (see ). Eight states (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming) engage in prior appropriation without recognizing the riparian doctrine.

However, prior appropriation does not always determine water allocation in these states because various federal regulations also have priority over senior users. For example, the Endangered Species Act of 1973 seeks to protect animals at risk of extinction, so a senior user&#x27;s rights may be restricted in favor of federal regulation protecting the habitats of endangered animals. These federal rules manifest as a prior allotment by the Secretary of the Interior.

===Arizona===
Arizona adopted the prior appropriation doctrine such that a person could acquire this water right simply by applying it to beneficial use and posting an appropriation notice at the point of diversion. On June 12, 1919, they enacted the Public Water Code in which the person must apply for and obtain a permit for water use.

===Colorado===
The appropriation doctrine was adopted in Colorado in 1872 when the territorial court ruled in &quot;Yunker v. Nichols&quot;, 1 Colo. 552 (1872), that a non-riparian user who had previously applied part of the water from a stream to beneficial use had superior rights to the water with respect to a riparian owner who claimed a right to use of all the water at a later time. The question was not squarely presented again to the Colorado Court until 1882 when in the landmark case, &quot;Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch Co.&quot;, 6 Colo. 443 (1882), the court explicitly adopted the appropriation doctrine and rejected the riparian doctrine, citing Colorado irrigation and mining practices and the nature of the climate. The decision in &quot;Coffin&quot; ruled that prior to adoption of the appropriation doctrine in the Colorado Constitution of 1876 that the riparian doctrine had never been the law in Colorado. Within 20 years the appropriation doctrine, the so-called Colorado Doctrine, had been adopted, in whole or part, by most of the states in the Western United States that had an arid climate.

===New Mexico===
New Mexico enacted its appropriate Surface-Water Code in 1907. Later, in 1931, New Mexico enacted the Underground Water Law that adapted the state&#x27;s surface law to ground water.

===Montana===
The prior-appropriation doctrine was adopted in 1973 in Montana under the 1973 Water Use Act. Later, they then passed the Montana Ground Water Assessment Act in 1991.

===Texas===
In 1967, Texas passed the Water Rights Adjudication Act in regards to surface waters such that the allocation of these waters was under a unified permit system.

==Criticism==
Even though water markets increasingly gain ground, many criticize the prior appropriation system for failing to adequately adjust to society&#x27;s evolving values and needs. Environmentalists and recreational river-users demand more water be left in rivers and streams, but courts have been slow to accept these requests as beneficial uses. Conversely, the tool of beneficial use is too tied to custom to encourage users to conserve. An appropriator who uses water inefficiently retains the right to the full allotment, but an appropriator who uses only a portion risks losing the right to the rest, and water right markets remain too illiquid to purchase any excess. As a result, the vast majority of water in the West still is allocated to agricultural uses despite cries for additional water from growing cities.

High demand can cause an over-appropriation of the waters, in which there are more water rights for a particular stream than water actually available. This leads to an apparent inefficiency: if a water source is over-appropriated, the latest users will almost never see water from their claims. But without those claims, excess water from an unusually wet year will go to waste.

==In other goods==
Water is not the only public good that has been subject to prior appropriation. The same &quot;first in time, first in right&quot; theory has been used in the United States to encourage and give a legal framework for other commercial activities.

The early prospectors and miners in the California Gold Rush of 1849, and later gold and silver rushes in the western United States, applied appropriation theory to mineral deposits. The first one to discover and begin mining a deposit was acknowledged to have a legal right to mine. Because appropriation theory in mineral lands and water rights developed in the same time and place, it is likely that they influenced one another. As with water rights, mining rights could be forfeited by nonuse. The miners codes were later legalized by the federal government in 1866, and then in the Mining Law of 1872.

The Homestead Act of 1862 granted legal title to the first farmer to put public land into agricultural production. This &quot;first in time&quot; right to agricultural land may have been influenced by appropriation theory applied to mineral lands.

In recent years, there has been some discussion of limiting air pollution by granting rights to existing pollution sources. Then it has been argued, a free cap and trade market could develop in pollution rights. This would be prior appropriation theory applied to air pollution. Recent concern over carbon dioxide and global warming has led to an economic market in CO2 emissions, in which some companies wish to balance emissions increases by offsetting decreases in existing emissions sources. This is essentially acknowledging a prior appropriation right to existing CO2 emitters.

<text>Leevi Antti Madetoja (; 17 February 1887 – 6 October 1947) was a Finnish composer, music critic, conductor, and teacher of the late-Romantic and early-modern periods. He is widely recognized as one of the most significant Finnish contemporaries of Jean Sibelius, under whom he studied privately from 1908 to 1910.

The core of Madetoja&#x27;s &quot;oeuvre&quot; consists of a set of three symphonies (1916, 1918, and 1926), arguably the finest early-twentieth century additions to the symphonic canon of any Finnish composer, Sibelius excepted. As central to Madetoja&#x27;s legacy is &quot;Pohjalaisia&quot; (&quot;The Ostrobothnians&quot;, 1923), proclaimed Finland&#x27;s &quot;national opera&quot; following its successful 1924 premiere and, even today, a stalwart of the country&#x27;s repertoire. Other notable works include an &quot;Elegia&quot; for strings (1909); &quot;Kuoleman puutarha&quot; (&quot;The Garden of Death&quot;, 1918–21), a three-movement suite for solo piano; the &quot;Japanisme&quot; ballet-pantomime, &quot;Okon Fuoko&quot; (1927); and, a second opera, &quot;Juha&quot; (1935). Madetoja&#x27;s fourth symphony, purportedly lost in 1938 at a Paris railway station, never materialized.

Acclaimed during his lifetime, Madetoja today is seldom heard outside the Nordic countries, although his music has in recent decades enjoyed a renaissance, as the recording projects of a number of Nordic orchestras and conductors evidence. His idiom is notably introverted for a national Romantic composer, a blend of Finnish melancholy, folk melodies from his native region of Ostrobothnia, and the elegance and clarity of the French symphonic tradition, founded on César Franck and guided by Vincent d&#x27;Indy. His music also reveals Sibelius&#x27;s influence.

Madetoja was also an influential music critic, primarily with the newspaper &quot;Helsingin sanomat&quot; (1916–32), in which he reviewed the music scenes of France and Finland, praising Sibelius in particular. In 1918, he married the Finnish poet L. Onerva; their marriage was tempestuous and remained childless. His health failing due to alcoholism, Madetoja died from a heart attack on 6 October 1947 in Helsinki.

== Life and career ==
=== Early years (1887–1915) ===
==== Childhood ====
Madetoja was born in Oulu, Finland, on 17 February 1887, the third son of Anders Antinpoika Madetoja (1855–1888) and Anna Elisabeth, née Hyttinne (1858–1934). To provide for his family, Madetoja&#x27;s father, a first mate on a merchant ship, had earlier emigrated in 1886 to the United States, only to die in 1888 of tuberculosis along the Mississippi River. Leevi thus never met his father, and his mother raised him and his brother, Yrjö (1885–1918). (Madetoja&#x27;s oldest brother, Hjalmar, had died as an infant in 1883.) The family lived in poverty and struggled with hunger, and as a boy Leevi worked variously as a street cleaner and as a laborer at a sawmill.

Although his first attempts at composition were at the age of eight, Madetoja was by no means a musical prodigy. He studied the violin and piano on his own and played the mouth organ as a boy. Additionally, Madetoja became a skilled kantele player: he received a 10-string kantele on his tenth birthday, and in secondary school at the Oulu Lyceum, he upgraded to a 30-string version. (Madetoja is certainly the only notable classical composer in history whose primary instrument was the kantele.) At the Lyceum, Leevi sang in, and eventually directed, the school&#x27;s male and mixed choirs.

==== Student years ====
In 1906, Madetoja enrolled at the University of Helsinki and the Helsinki Music Institute, where he studied music theory, composition, and piano under Armas Järnefelt and . A year later, in the summer of 1907, the Finnish Literature Society sponsored Madetoja&#x27;s trip to the Inkeri region in Russia so that he could collect folk songs. Additional good fortune arrived in 1908, when Jean Sibelius, Finland&#x27;s most famous composer, accepted Leevi for private instruction. Although his lessons with Sibelius at Ainola were unstructured and sporadic, Madetoja valued his time with the master and assimilated some of Sibelius&#x27;s unique idiom. The two studied together until 1910. (For more see: Madetoja and Sibelius.)

At the Music Institute, Madetoja&#x27;s premiered his first compositions at student concerts: in December 1908, the Op. 2 songs, &quot;Yksin&quot; and &quot;Lähdettyäs&quot;; and on 29 May 1909, the Piano Trio, Op. 1 (second and third movements only). His public introduction arrived in January 1910 when Robert Kajanus, chief conductor of the Helsinki Orchestral Society, conducted Madetoja&#x27;s &quot;Elegia&quot; (from the four-movement &quot;Symphonic Suite&quot;, Op. 4) to great success; critics described the &quot;Elegia&quot; as the &quot;first master work&quot; of a budding &quot;natural orchestral composer&quot;.

After graduating from the Music Institute and the University of Helsinki in 1910, Madetoja took up a career as a music critic, penning essays and reviews for the &quot;Säveletär&quot; magazine and, later, the . Additional praise followed Madetoja&#x27;s first composition concert in Helsinki on 26 September 1910, at which he conducted the Piano Trio and excerpts from the &quot;Symphonic Suite&quot; and &quot;Chess&quot;, Op. 5 (excerpted from incidental music Madetoja had composed for Eino Leino&#x27;s play). The positive reviews did, however, contain a note of concern: given Madetoja&#x27;s plans to travel to Paris for additional education, the critic of &quot;Uusi Suometar&quot; worried about the negative influence &quot;French modern atonal composition&quot; could have on &quot;this fresh northern nature [Madetoja]&quot;.

Madetoja&#x27;s interest in the Paris music scene was a result of the enthusiastic reports of his composer-friend, Toivo Kuula, who had earlier studied in the city. With funding from the Finnish government and a letter of introduction from Sibelius, Madetoja applied to be a student of Vincent d&#x27;Indy, who headed a school of thought founded upon the symphonic principles of César Franck. The two only met for one lesson, however, as d&#x27;Indy took ill and Madetoja&#x27;s plans collapsed; he would spend the rest of his time in Paris without a teacher, attending concerts and working on his own compositions (the result was the &quot;Concert Overture&quot;, Op. 7).

After a brief stay in Oulu (where he composed and premiered on 29 September 1911 a short cantata for mixed choir and piano, &quot;Merikoski&quot;, Op. 10), Madetoja undertook a second trip abroad, this time to Vienna and Berlin, in the autumn of 1911. Sibelius again aided his pupil, arranging for Madetoja to study under his former teacher, Robert Fuchs. While in Vienna, Madetoja audited composition and conducting courses at the Conservatory, observed Franz Schalk&#x27;s rehearsals, and composed &quot;Dance Vision&quot;, Op. 11.

==== Conductorships ====
In 1912, Kajanus appointed Madetoja and Kuula—who had together returned to Helsinki from Berlin—as assistant conductors of the Helsinki Orchestral Society, Madetoja&#x27;s term lasting until 1914. The appointment put Madetoja in the middle of Helsinki&#x27;s &quot;orchestra feud&quot;, as Kajanus&#x27; Orchestral Society squared off against Georg Schnéevoigt&#x27;s newly created Helsinki Symphony Orchestra, which consisted mainly of foreign musicians. Madetoja&#x27;s position with the Orchestral Society provided him the opportunity to perform a number of his compositions: on 12 October 1912, &quot;Dance Vision&quot; premiered under Madetoja&#x27;s baton, and even more importantly, he had his second composing concert on 14 October 1913, where he premiered the &quot;Concert Overture&quot; and &quot;Kullervo&quot;, Op. 15, a symphonic poem based on the Kalevalic tragic hero of the same name. Madetoja earned little as an assistant conductor and thus supplemented his income as a music critic for &quot;Uusi Suometar&quot;, becoming well known for his articles on the French music scene and his recurring travels to Paris.

The dawn of the First World War in July 1914 brought an end to the feud between the two rival orchestras: the Helsinki Symphony Orchestra collapsed after the German musicians who formed its backbone were expelled from the country, and Kajanus and Schnéevoigt divided conducting duties for a joint orchestra, the Helsinki City Orchestra, that consisted of forty players surviving on starvation wages. The merger rendered Madetoja (and, a year later, Kuula) superfluous, and Madetoja pawned his metronome to stave off penury. Despite the hostilities, he traveled to Russia in September 1914 to take up the conductorship of the Viipuri Orchestra (1914–1916). Madetoja found the group in a state of devastation: he was able to piece together 19 musicians, a reality that forced him to spend much of his time finding and arranging material for such an undersized ensemble.

=== Mature career (1916–1930) ===
==== A new Finnish symphonist ====
While juggling his responsibilities in Viipuri, Madetoja worked on his most first major compositions, the First Symphony in Helsinki (Kajanus the dedicatee), conducting the premiere on 10 February 1916; apparently he completed the finale just before this performance. The critics, some of whom—for example in &quot;Hufvudstadsbladet&quot;—noted the influence of Sibelius, received the work warmly. Buoyed by this success, Madetoja relocated to Helsinki and began composing a second symphony in the summer. To support himself, he began work as a music critic for the &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; newspaper (1916–32) and as a teacher of music theory and history at the Music Institute (1916–39). In 1917, the Finnish government granted Madetoja a three-year artist&#x27;s pension, which allowed him to focus more on composing. (In 1918, the pension was extended for life.)

In 1918, the embers of the First World War ignited into civil war (27 January – 15 May 1918) between socialist Red Guards and the nationalist Whites. The war brought personal tragedy to Madetoja: On 9 April, Red Guards captured and executed Yrjö Madetoja, Leevi&#x27;s brother, during the Battle of Antrea in Kavantsaari. It fell to Leevi to inform his mother:

A month later, during May Day celebrations, Kuula got into an altercation with a group of White Army officers, one of whom shot him to death. These two losses deeply upset Madetoja and likely found expression in the symphony, a composition in which he had already been contemplating Finland&#x27;s fate in the wake of world war and a revolution in Russia; the epilogue Madetoja affixed to the work is one of pain and resignation: &quot;I have fought my battle and now withdraw&quot;.

The 17 December 1918 premiere of the Second Symphony under Kajanus&#x27;s baton was extraordinarily well received. Katila, for example, proclaimed Madetoja&#x27;s latest work to be &quot;the most remarkable achievement in our music since the monumental series of Sibelius&quot;. (Upon his mother&#x27;s death in 1934, Madetoja retroactively dedicated the Second Symphony to her.) Around this time, Madetoja also published in &quot;Lumikukkia&quot; magazine a piece for solo piano, originally titled &quot;Improvisation in Memory of my Brother Yrjö&quot;. In 1919, Madetoja expanded the piece into a three-movement suite, renaming it &quot;The Garden of Death&quot;, Op. 41, and removing the reference to his brother; the suite shares melodic motifs with the Second Symphony.

The 1920s found Madetoja financially stable but stretched thin. In addition to his teaching responsibilities at the Music Institute and criticism for &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot;, by June 1928 Madetoja had added the position of music teacher at his other alma mater, the University of Helsinki. Despite the trifling salary, the post held great prestige, having previously been the chair of Fredrik Pacius (1835–69), (1870–96), and (controversially) Kajanus (1897–27), and included among its tasks the conductorship of the Academic Orchestra. He also took on administrative roles in the music profession: in 1917, he was a founding member of the Finnish Composers&#x27; League (Suomen Säveltaiteilijain Liitto; forerunner to the , or Suomen Säveltäjät, founded in 1945), serving as its secretary and, later, president; in 1928, moreover, he helped establish the Finnish Composers&#x27; Copyright Society (Säveltäjäin Tekijänoikeustoimisto; TEOSTO), serving on its board of directors from 1928 to 1947 and as its chairman from 1937 to 1947. Despite manifold commitments, Madetoja (somehow) found time to compose three of his most important, large-scale works: an opera, &quot;The Ostrobothnians&quot;, Op. 45 (1918–23); the Third Symphony, Op. 55 (1925–26); and a ballet-pantomime, &quot;Okon Fuoko&quot;, Op. 58 (1925–27). When taken together, these three works solidified his position as Finland&#x27;s premiere, post-Sibelian composer.

==== A Finnish national opera ====
&quot;The Ostrobothnians&quot; commission, first offered to Kuula in November 1917, was for an opera based upon the popular 1914 folk play by the Ostrobothnian journalist and writer, Artturi Järviluoma. Although Kuula viewed the play as a strong candidate for a libretto, its realism conflicted with his personal preference for fairy tale or legend-based subject matter, in keeping with the Wagnerian operatic tradition. When Kuula refused the opportunity, the commission fell to Madetoja, who had also expressed interest in the project. The composition process, begun in late December 1917, took Madetoja much longer than expected; letters to his mother indicate that he had entertained hopes of completing the opera by the end of 1920 and, when this deadline passed, 1921 and, eventually, 1922. In the end, the opera was not completed until September 1923, although it would be another full year until the opera premiered. Nevertheless, some of the music (from Acts I and II) did see the light of day sooner, as Madetoja had pieced together a five-number orchestral suite at the behest of Kajanus, who premiered the suite on 8 March 1923 in Bergen, Norway during his orchestra tour; the reviews were positive, describing the music as &quot;interesting and strange&quot;.

The first performance of the complete opera on 25 October 1924 at the Finnish National Opera (which, incidentally, was also the one-thousandth performance in the history of the Opera House) was, perhaps, the greatest triumph of Madetoja&#x27;s entire career. Indeed, with &quot;The Ostrobothnians&quot;, Madetoja succeeded where his teacher, Jean Sibelius, famously had failed: in the creation of a Finnish national opera, a watershed moment for a country lacking an operatic tradition of its own. In &quot;Helsingin sanomat&quot;, Katila wrote on behalf of many Finns, calling &quot;The Ostrobothnians&quot; &quot;the most substantial work in the whole of Finnish opera&quot;. &quot;The Ostrobothnians&quot; immediately became a fixture of the Finnish operatic repertoire (where it remains today), and was even produced abroad during Madetoja&#x27;s lifetime, in Kiel, Germany in 1926; Stockholm in 1927; Gothenburg in 1930; and, Copenhagen in 1938.

==== Two final masterworks ====
After the success of &quot;The Ostrobothnians&quot;, Madetoja departed for France, staying for six months in Houilles, a small town just outside of Paris. Here, in the quiet of the Parisian suburbs, Madetoja began to compose his Third Symphony, Op. 55, and upon returning to Finland in October (due to financial worries), his work on the project continued. The new symphony received its premiere in Helsinki on 8 April 1926, and although Madetoja received the usual praise, the audience and critics found the new work somewhat perplexing: with the monumental, elegiac Second Symphony having set expectations, the optimism and restraint of the Third came as a surprise, its (subsequent) significance eluding nearly everyone. Some years later, the French music writer, Henri-Claude Fantapié, described the cheerful, pastorale Third Symphony as a &quot;sinfonia Gallica&quot; in spirit and explained the premiere as thus: &quot;The listeners expected the opera [&quot;The Ostrobothnians&quot;] to be followed by a nationalistic anthem and were disappointed to hear something that seemed to them to be hermetic and that, to crown it all, was lacking in pomposity and solemnity … the properties the majority of Finnish music-lovers always expect in a new work.&quot; Nevertheless, today the Third Symphony is widely regarded as Madetoja&#x27;s &quot;masterpiece&quot;, the rare Finnish symphony equal in stature to Sibelius&#x27;s seven essays in the form.

While on his way to Paris in 1925, Madetoja had met a music publisher from Copenhagen, Wilhelm Hansen, who placed him into contact with the Danish playwright Poul Knudsen. A libretto for a new ballet-pantomime, based upon &quot;exotic&quot; Japanese themes, was on offer and Madetoja accepted the project with alacrity. Having outlined his plan for the new commission while staying in Houilles, Madetoja he more or less composed the Third Symphony and &quot;Okon Fuoko&quot; simultaneously, although the pressure to complete the former was so great that Madetoja was compelled to place the ballet-pantomime aside until December 1926. Although Madetoja completed the score in late 1927, scheduling the ballet-pantomime&#x27;s premiere in Copenhagen proved difficult, despite the enthusiasm of the chief conductor of the Royal Danish Orchestra, Georg Høeberg, who after a test rehearsal had proclaimed the score a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. The primary cause of the delay appears to have been the difficulty of casting a lead actor, as the part required both singing and miming; Knudsen insisted upon—and opted to wait for—an actor then on leave from the theatre, Johannes Poulsen.

The production languished unperformed until it (finally) received its premiere on 12 February 1930, not in Copenhagen, but rather in Helsinki, at the Finnish National Opera under the baton of . The performance was the first significant setback of Madetoja&#x27;s career: although the critics &quot;unanimously praised&quot; Madetoja&#x27;s music, the consensus opinion was that Knudsen&#x27;s libretto—with its awkward mixture of song, melodramatic spoken dialogue, dance, and pantomime—was a dramatic failure. In the end, &quot;Okon Fuoko&quot; received only three performances total and the Danish premiere never took place. Seeking to salvage his score, Madetoja in 1927 pieced together the six-number &quot;Okon Fuoko Suite No. 1&quot;, which proved a success; the composer&#x27;s plans to set two additional suites never materialized.

=== Later years (1931–1947) ===
==== Declining fortunes ====
For Madetoja, the 1930s brought hardship and disappointment. During this time, he was at work on two new major projects: a second opera, &quot;Juha&quot;, and a fourth symphony, each to be his final labor in their respective genres. The former, with a libretto by the famous Finnish soprano, Aino Ackté (adapted from the 1911 novel by writer Juhani Aho), had fallen to Madetoja after a series of events: first, Sibelius—ever the believer in &quot;absolute music&quot;—had refused the project in 1914; and, second, in 1922, the Finnish National Opera had rejected a first attempt by Aarre Merikanto as &quot;too Modernist&quot; and &quot;too demanding on the orchestra&quot;, leading the composer to withdraw the score. Two failures in, Ackté thus turned to Madetoja, the successful &quot;The Ostrobothnians&quot; of whom was firmly ensconced in the repertoire, to produce a safer, more palatable version of the opera.

The death of Madetoja&#x27;s mother, Anna, on 26 March 1934, interrupted his work on the opera; the loss so devastated Madetoja that he fell ill and could not travel to Oulu for the funeral. Madetoja completed work on the opera by the end of 1934 and it premiered to considerable fanfare at the Finnish National Opera on 17 February 1935, the composer&#x27;s forty-eighth birthday. The critics hailed it as a &quot;brilliant success&quot;, an &quot;undisputed masterpiece of Madetoja and Finnish opera literature&quot;. Nevertheless, the &quot;euphoria&quot; of the initial performance eventually wore off and, to the composer&#x27;s disappointment, &quot;Juha&quot; did not equal the popularity of &quot;The Ostrobothnians&quot;. Indeed, today &quot;Juha&quot; is most associated with Merikanto, whose modernist &quot;Juha&quot; (first performed in the 1960s) is the more enduringly popular of the two; having been displaced by Merikanto&#x27;s, Madetoja&#x27;s &quot;Juha&quot; is rarely performed.

==== The lost symphony ====
The composition of the Fourth Symphony remains a mystery, although Madetoja&#x27;s chief biographer, Erkki Salmenhaara, has unearthed the key details. In the spring of 1930, Madetoja told &quot;Karjala&quot; newspaper that he had begun a new symphony with the themes derived from &quot;Finnish folk song&quot;. An eight-year gestation ensued. Plans to complete the symphony in time for his fiftieth birthday on 17 February 1937 did not come to fruition, and in July 1937, Madetoja retired to the spa town of in Iisalmi to focus further on the symphony. As the Fourth&#x27;s finish line neared in the spring of 1938, Madetoja traveled to Nice hoping that France, as it had a decade earlier with the Third Symphony, would stoke his creative fires.

Misfortune quickly dashed Madetoja&#x27;s hopes: while passing through Paris on his way to Southern France, his suitcase—which contained the Fourth Symphony—was stolen at a railway station in the city; the near-completed manuscript was never recovered. With his inspiration and memory in decline, Madetoja never undertook a reconstruction of the lost score, notwithstanding his (unsuccessful) 1941 application for a stipend to &quot;finish my fourth symphony that is underway&quot;. When a student of his, , asked whether Madetoja could recreate the symphony, he replied, &quot;Do you think that I could rewrite something that a thief has taken&quot;? By January 1942, he was hospitalized for alcoholism. During his treatment, Madetoja occupied himself with old issues of &quot;Musiikkitieto&quot; magazine and, when he came across a story about his time in Runni, he did not recall having composed the Fourth. (&quot;I wonder if anything has been written at all&quot;?)

==== Death ====
In the 1940s, Madetoja battled poor physical health, depression, a collapsing marriage, and waning artistic inspiration; his already less-than-prolific pace declined to a crawl. During this time, Madetoja orchestrated his song cycle for soprano and piano, &quot;Autumn&quot;, Op. 68, a setting of his wife&#x27;s poems he had completed eight years earlier. With its mature idiom and mournful outlook on the human experience, some sources describe &quot;Autumn&quot; as Madetoja&#x27;s &quot;testament&quot;. Otherwise, Madetoja occupied himself with smaller forms, primarily for choir a cappella; the seven Op. 81 songs for male choir were completed in 1946, as were the two Op. 82 songs for mixed choir. His final completed piece was &quot;Matkamies&quot; (&quot;Wayfarer&quot;) for female choir, written in the year of his death (sketch completed by Olavi Pesonen).

Madetoja died at approximately 11:00 am on 6 October 1947 at the Konkordia Methodist hospital in Helsinki. Although some sources attribute his death to heart attack, no surviving record indicates a conclusive cause of death. The Madetoja funeral took place five days later on 11 October at the Helsinki Old Church; the president of Finland, Juho Kusti Paasikivi, supplied a wreath, as did the Ministry of Education, the City of Oulu, and other institutions and mourners. Critics praised Madetoja in obituaries and Onerva published a memorial poem. Madetoja left (very early) plans for a number of never-realized works, including a violin concerto, a requiem mass, a third opera (a &quot;Finnish &quot;Parsifal&quot;&quot;), and &quot;Ikävyys&quot; (&quot;Melancholy&quot;), a composition for voice and piano after Aleksis Kivi.

Madetoja (joined by Onerva in 1972) is buried at Hietaniemi cemetery () in Helsinki, a national landmark and frequent tourist attraction that features the graves of famous Finnish military figures, politicians, and artists. Unveiled in 1955, the gravestone—located on block V8 in the Old Area (), near the cemetery wall (circle marker 48 on the following map; approx. )—is by the Finnish sculptor Kalervo Kallio and is courtesy of TEOSTO. Also buried in the cemetery are Madetoja&#x27;s friend, Toivo Kuula (d. 1918; block U19), as well as Onerva&#x27;s onetime paramour, Eino Leino (d. 1926; block U21).

== Personal life ==
In February 1910, Madetoja—while composing the incidental music for Eino Leino&#x27;s play, &quot;Chess&quot;—made the acquaintance of the Finnish poet Hilja Onerva Lehtinen (a.k.a., L. Onerva), a friend and lover of the playwright. Although Madetoja was five years Onerva&#x27;s junior, their relationship deepened and in 1913 they began telling others of their marriage; in fact, however, they formally married in 1918. Their financial situation precarious, an orchestral rehearsal in Turku doubled as honeymoon. Their marriage was childless (even though they wished to have children) and plagued by quarrels; each suffered from chronic alcoholism. In the final years of Madetoja&#x27;s life, Onerva was confined to a mental institution—it appears against her will, as the letters she wrote to her husband asking for him to retrieve her were not successful. In 2006, the couple&#x27;s correspondence was published in Finnish under the title, &quot;Night Songs: L. Onerva and Leevi Madetoja&#x27;s Letters from 1910 to 1946&quot; (eds. Anna Makkonen and Tuurna Marja-Leena).

== Relationship with Sibelius ==

=== Student and teacher ===
Madetoja, 22 years Sibelius&#x27;s junior, began to study composition privately under the Finnish master in 1908, a unique opportunity with which only one other individual prior to Madetoja had been presented: his friend, Toivo Kuula. Later in life, during Sibelius&#x27;s fiftieth birthday celebrations, Madetoja recounted the way in which he had, as a young man, reacted to the news:

Sibelius seems to have discounted his own pedagogical skills, telling Madetoja, &quot;I am a bad teacher.&quot;. First, he had little patience for pedagogy or the quotidian nature of instruction, resulting in a teaching style that was &quot;too haphazard&quot; and &quot;anything but systematic or disciplined&quot;. This was not lost on Madetoja, who in January 1910 wrote to Kuula in Paris, &quot;Sibelius has been tutoring me. You know from your own experience that his tutoring is anything but detailed.&quot; Madetoja recalled, for example, that Sibelius&#x27;s method consisted of &quot;short, striking remarks&quot; (for example, &quot;No dead notes. Every note must live&quot;), rather than &quot;instruction in the ordinary pedagogic sense&quot;.

Second, Sibelius&#x27;s &quot;deeply idiosyncratic&quot; idiom was too &quot;personal&quot; to serve adequately as a &quot;foundation&quot; upon which to build a school of musical thought. That Madetoja&#x27;s own musical style shows the mark of Sibelius is a testament to the longer duration and greater depth of his instruction under Sibelius; Kuula, who only briefly studied with Sibelius, shows no such influence. Finally, Sibelius—prone to periods of self-doubt and ever-concerned with his standing in artistic circles—was mistrustful of the next generation of composers, fearing one might displace him from his perch. &quot;Youth has a right to make its voice heard. One sees oneself as a father figure to them all&quot;, Sibelius confided to his diary. &quot;[But] they don&#x27;t give a damn about you. Perhaps with reason.&quot;

Despite these issues, Madetoja found his instruction under Sibelius enriching and the two men enjoyed a &quot;harmonious&quot; relationship, notwithstanding occasional irritations. Madetoja was clearly fond of his teacher and enjoyed Sibelius&#x27;s counsel and company:

Madetoja continued to feel this way throughout his life. A decade later, he sought to defend Sibelius against the (growing) conventional wisdom that he was a poor teacher around whom no appreciable school of thought had formed (unlike, for example, Arnold Schoenberg and the Second Viennese School). In &quot;Aulos&quot;, a volume published on the occasion of Sibelius&#x27;s sixtieth birthday in 1925, Madetoja argued for a more nuanced, less &quot;superficial&quot; definition of the word &#x27;teacher&#x27; and recounted with fondness his personal experiences as one of Sibelius&#x27;s pupils.

=== Colleagues ===
Sibelius followed Madetoja&#x27;s rise with the pride of a teacher. Early on he recognized his pupil&#x27;s potential as a symphonic composer (&quot;What you wrote about your symphonic business delights me exceedingly,&quot; Sibelius wrote to Madetoja. &quot;I feel that you will achieve your greatest triumphs in that genre, for I consider that you have precisely the properties that make a symphonic composer. This is my firm belief.&quot;), and the 10 February 1916 premiere of Madetoja&#x27;s First Symphony found Sibelius&#x27;s remarking on its beauty. The 17 December 1918 premiere of Madetoja&#x27;s Second Symphony similarly impressed Sibelius, who was again in attendance.

Nevertheless, Sibelius also eyed Madetoja&#x27;s maturation somewhat wearily. For example, when some reviews of the First Symphony discerned within Madetoja&#x27;s music the influence of Sibelius, he worried his former pupil might take offence at the comparison and mistook Madetoja&#x27;s characteristic &quot;melancholia&quot; for &quot;sulkiness&quot;. Suddenly, Sibelius found Madetoja arrogant and watched with concern as he drew closer to Kajanus, with whom Sibelius had an on-again-off-again friendship/rivalry. &quot;Met Madetoja, who—I&#x27;m sorry to say—has become pretty bumptious after his latest success,&quot; Sibelius fretted to his diary. &quot;Kajanus smothers him with flattery and he hasn&#x27;t the breeding to see it for what it is.&quot; A second complication for the Madetoja-Sibelius relationship was the master&#x27;s fear that his former pupil eventually might &quot;supplant him in public esteem&quot;. Certainly Madetoja&#x27;s rise coincided with Sibelius&#x27;s increasing sense of isolation:

Madetoja was &quot;scarcely aware&quot; of Sibelius&#x27;s private musings to his diary, and for his part, he continued as a critic and writer to champion actively his former teacher. In July 1914, for example, Madetoja praised Sibelius&#x27;s tone poem, &quot;The Oceanides&quot;, writing in &quot;Uusi Suometar&quot; that rather than &quot;repeat endlessly&quot; the style of his previous works, Sibelius had yet again shown his penchant for &quot;renewing himself musically … It is the sign of life … always forward, striving for new aims.&quot; He also had kind words for &quot;Tapiola&quot;, describing it as &quot;a beautiful work&quot;, and among others, Sibelius&#x27;s Third, Fourth, and Fifth symphonies.

Despite his conducting duties in Viipuri and the stress of composing his First Symphony, Madetoja sought to take on yet another commitment: to write the first Finnish language biography of Sibelius in honor of the master&#x27;s fiftieth birthday in 1915. Notwithstanding his initial misgivings, Sibelius consented to the project; certainly, he could not have found a biographer more sympathetic and sensitive than Madetoja. The interviews at Ainola, however, came to nothing: to the embarrassment of both men, publishers were uninterested in the biography. As Madetoja wrote to Sibelius:

As a result, the biography was abandoned and Madetoja settled for a piece in &quot;Helsingin sanomat&quot; in which he took other critics to task for having overlooked the &quot;absolute, pure&quot; qualities of Sibelius&#x27;s music. Sibelius outlived Madetoja by almost ten years.

== Music ==

=== Idiom ===
Stylistically, Madetoja belongs to the national Romantic school, along with Finnish contemporaries Armas Järnefelt, Robert Kajanus, Toivo Kuula, Erkki Melartin, Selim Palmgren, and Jean Sibelius; with the exception of &quot;Okon Fuoko&quot;, Madetoja&#x27;s music, darkly colored but tonal, is not particularly modernist in outlook, certainly not when compared directly with the outputs of Uuno Klami, Aarre Merikanto, Ernest Pingoud, and Väinö Raitio. For a Romantic composer, however, Madetoja&#x27;s music is notably &quot;introverted&quot;, avoiding the excesses characteristic of that art movement in favor of the &quot;balance, clarity, refinement of expression, and technical polish&quot; of classicism.

Stylistically, Madetoja&#x27;s idiom is unique and deeply personal, a blend of three distinct musical ingredients: 1) Finnish nationalism, as evidenced by Madetoja&#x27;s use of folk melody (especially from his native region, Ostrobothnia) and literary sources, such as the &quot;Kalevala&quot;; 2) the musical language of Sibelius, under whom Madetoja privately studied; and finally, 3) the &quot;elegance&quot; of the French symphonic tradition, founded on César Franck and formally organized by Vincent d&#x27;Indy as the Schola Cantorum de Paris. Madetoja and Kuula—having both studied in Paris—represent the first two significant Finnish composers to show the influence of French music. Nevertheless, the two friends would travel different paths: whereas Kuula adopted the language and techniques of the French Impressionists headed by Claude Debussy.

=== Notable works ===
In total, Madetoja&#x27;s oeuvre comprises 82 works with opus numbers and about 40 without. While he composed in all genres, Madetoja was most productive—and found his greatest success—with the orchestra: symphonies, operas, cantatas, and orchestral miniatures all flowed from his pen; indeed, for Salmenhaara, Madetoja&#x27;s work in this genre places him &quot;on a par with his European colleagues&quot; as a composer for orchestra. Curiously, he composed no concerti, although at various times in his career he hinted at plans for a violin concerto. Madetoja was also an accomplished composer for voice, as his numerous choral pieces and songs for voice and piano evidence; he found less success with—and composed sparingly for—solo piano, &quot;The Garden of Death&quot; notwithstanding. Finally, Madetoja wrote little for chamber ensemble after his student years, although it is unclear if this was due to insufficient skill or waning interest in the genre.

==== Symphonies ====
The core of Madetoja&#x27;s oeuvre is his set of three symphonies, perhaps the most significant contribution to the genre of Finnish national Romantic composers, post-Sibelius. Each of Madetoja&#x27;s symphonies is &quot;unique and distinct&quot;, a testament to his &quot;true talent for symphonic composition&quot;. The First Symphony, although late-Romantic in style, carefully eschews the extravagance and overindulgence typical of debut efforts, placing it among the most &quot;mature&quot; and restrained of first symphonies. Accordingly, Madetoja&#x27;s First, in F major, is most concentrated of his three essays in the form and, at three movements rather than the traditional four, it is also the shortest. Madetoja&#x27;s Second, in E-flat major is a dramatic &quot;war symphony&quot; in which the composer contemplates personal loss during the Civil War. It is Madetoja&#x27;s longest and most elegiac symphony and, perhaps for this reason, it is also the most enduringly popular of the set. Although in four movements, Madetoja links movement I to II and movement III to IV; moreover, the symphony also features solo oboe and horn &quot;in distanza&quot; (offstage) in movement II. The Third, in A major, is optimistic and pastorale in character, as well as &quot;more restrained&quot; than the Second, is today considered one of the finest symphonies in the Finnish orchestral canon, indeed a &quot;masterpiece ... equal in stature&quot; to Sibelius&#x27;s seven essays in the form. Although technically his penultimate symphonic composition (a fourth symphony was lost and thus never completed), the Third is would be Madetoja&#x27;s final addition to the symphonic canon.

==== Operas and ballets ====
The success of &quot;The Ostrobothnians&quot; was due to a confluence of factors: the appeal of the music, tonal but darkly colored; the use of folk melodies (blended with Madetoja&#x27;s own idiom) familiar to the audience; a libretto (also by Madetoja) based upon a well-known and beloved play; a story about freedom from oppression and self-determination, the allegorical qualities of which were particularly salient in a country that had recently emerged from a war for independence; and, the skillful combination of comedic and tragic elements. The introduction to Act I (No. 2: &quot;Prisoner&#x27;s Song&quot; in the suite), for example, is based upon a famous Ostrobothnian folk song, &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Wind Bent the Birch&quot;), which was one of the 262 folk songs Kuula had collected during his travels and which made its way into Madetoja&#x27;s nationalistic opera, becoming its signature leitmotif. Relative to &quot;The Ostrobothnians&quot;, with &quot;Juha&quot; Madetoja takes a &quot;more symphonic, refined&quot; approach, one that eschews folk tunes, despite the nationalistic themes of the libretto.

== Legacy ==

=== Reception and recordings ===
Acclaimed during his lifetime, Madetoja is today seldom heard outside the Nordic countries (the &quot;Elegia&quot; perhaps excepted). A few commentators, however, have described such neglect as unfortunate and undeserved, as Madetoja is one of the most important post-Sibelian Finnish symphonists. Part of this neglect is not unique to Madetoja: the titanic legacy of Sibelius has made it difficult for Finnish composers (especially his contemporaries), as a group, to gain much attention, and each has had to labor under his &quot;dominating shadow&quot;. However, with respect to the neglect of Madetoja in particular, something else might also be at play: Madetoja&#x27;s eschewal of Romantic excess in favor of restraint, perhaps, has made him a tougher sell to audiences. According to one music critic:

In recent decades, Madetoja has begun to enjoy the renaissance Parland foresaw, as the recording projects of numerous Nordic orchestras and conductors evidence. Petri Sakari and the Iceland Symphony Orchestra (Chandos, 1991–92) and John Storgårds and the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra (Ondine, 2012–13) have each recorded the symphonies and a few of the more famous orchestral miniatures. Arvo Volmer and the Oulu Symphony Orchestra (, 1998–2006), the largest of the projects, has recorded nearly all of Madetoja&#x27;s works for orchestra, featuring the world premiere recordings for many pieces, among them the complete &quot;Symphonic Suite&quot;, Op. 4 (as opposed to just the &quot;Elegia&quot;), the &quot;Chess Suite&quot;, Op. 5; &quot;Dance Vision&quot;, Op. 11; the &quot;Pastoral Suite&quot;, Op. 34; the &quot;Barcarola&quot;, Op. 67/2, and &quot;Rustic Scenes&quot;, Op. 77. All three of Madetoja&#x27;s stage works, furthermore, have now been recorded in their complete, unabridged form—two recordings of &quot;The Ostrobothnians&quot; (Finlandia, 1975: Jorma Panula and the Finnish National Opera Orchestra; and, Finlandia, 1998: Jukka-Pekka Saraste and the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra) and one each of &quot;Juha&quot; (Ondine, 1977: Jussi Julas and the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra) and of &quot;Okon Fuoko&quot; (Alba, 2002: Volmer and the Oulu Symphony Orchestra).

Nordic vocalists, virtuosos, and ensembles have preserved many of Madetoja&#x27;s non-orchestral pieces as well. In 2004, Mika Rannali and Alba teamed to record Madetoja&#x27;s complete works for solo piano, while in 2001–02, and Helena Juntunen covered the complete lieder for solo voice and piano for Ondine (, piano accompaniment). Madetoja&#x27;s works (with opus numbers) for choir a cappella have also received systematic treatment; in the 1990s, the YL Male Voice Choir and Finlandia recorded (across three volumes) those for male choir, while in 2006–07, the Tapiola Chamber Choir and Alba tackled many of those for mixed choir. Despite these projects, a large portion of Madetoja&#x27;s oeuvre nevertheless remains unrecorded, the most notable omissions being the cantatas, a few neglected pieces for voice and orchestra, and the handful of compositions for chamber ensemble.

Modern-day critics have received the Madetoja revival with enthusiasm. The &quot;American Record Guide&#x27;s&quot; Tom Godell, for example, has applauded the recording efforts of both Volmer and Sakari, in particular praising Madetoja for his &quot;beautiful, swirling rainbows of vivid [orchestral] color&quot; and his &quot;uncanny ability to instantly establish a mood or rapidly sketch vast, ice-covered landscapes&quot;. Writing for the same magazine, William Trotter reviews Volmer&#x27;s &quot;absorbing&quot; five-volume set, pronouncing Madetoja a &quot;first-rate composer, touched sometimes with genius … who had to wait a long, long time before his work could emerge from under the dominating shadow of his teacher&#x27;s [Sibelius&#x27;s] seven symphonies&quot;. Reviewing the Ondine song collection for &quot;Fanfare&quot;, Jerry Dubins notes music&#x27;s nuanced emotional range, as Madetoja achieves &quot;moments of soaring ecstasy and searing pain&quot;, but without recourse to &quot;sentimental&quot; or &quot;cloying&quot; ornamentation. &quot;It is, quite simply&quot;, Dubins continues, &quot;some of the most gorgeous song-writing I have encountered in a very long time&quot;. Similarly, the &quot;American Record Guide&#x27;s&quot; Carl Bauman has kind words for the Rannali interpretations of Madetoja&#x27;s &quot;carefully written and polished ... unique&quot; solo piano miniatures, but in an echo of Parland, notes that Madetoja&#x27;s &quot;natural, unpretentious tone&quot; means that &quot;one has to listen carefully in order to fully appreciate Madetoja&#x27;s genius&quot;. A notable detractor in the sea of praise, however, has been Donald Vroon, chief editor of the &quot;American Record Guide&quot;. Arguing that Madetoja&#x27;s three symphonies &quot;reflect the influences of Sibelius—but … without his blazing inspiration&quot;, Vroon describes Madetoja&#x27;s music as &quot;bland&quot; and &quot;brooding … very Nordic, maybe written in winter when the sun is seldom seen&quot;. He concludes, &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine anyone being thrilled by them [the symphonies] or considering Madetoja a great discovery&quot;.

=== Memorials ===
A number of buildings and streets in Finland bear Madetoja&#x27;s name. In Oulu, Madetoja&#x27;s hometown, the Oulu Symphony Orchestra has performed since 1983 in the () Madetoja Hall (), located on Leevi Madetoja Street (). A second landmark in the city, directly adjacent to the Music Center, is the (), a special music high school founded in 1968 and renamed in the composer&#x27;s honor in 1981. Oulu is also home to a bronze statue of the composer (approx. ), which stands in a park near Oulu City Hall; the statue was unveiled in 1962 and is by the Finnish sculptor . Finally, in addition to the Madetoja-Onerva gravesite, Helsinki boasts two streets named after the composer ( and ), both of which are near an urban park ().

An additional honor arrived in 1987, when the Finnish government issued a postage stamp of Madetoja&#x27;s likeness in commemoration of the centennial anniversary of the composer&#x27;s birth. The centennial also marked the arrival of the Finnish musicologist Erkki Salmenhaara&#x27;s Finnish-language biography of the composer, titled &quot;Leevi Madetoja&quot; (Helsinki: Tammi), which three decades later remains the definitive account of Madetoja&#x27;s life and career. A year later in 1988, the Society of Finnish Composers established the for outstanding achievement in the performance of contemporary Finnish music; the Finnish conductor, Susanna Mälkki, is the current honoree (2016).

In addition, every three years, the Oulu University of Applied Sciences () hosts—together with the () and the Northern Ostrobothnia Association of Art and Culture ()—the Leevi Madetoja Piano Competition (), which is one of Finland&#x27;s premier music competitions for students. The Finnish Male Voice Choir Association (&quot;Suomen Mieskuoroliitto)&quot; is organizing quinquennial International Leevi Madetoja Male Voice Choir Competition, held for the first time in Turku in 1989. VII International Leevi Madetoja Male Voice Choir Competition will be organized at the Helsinki Music Centre on 10 April 2021.

<text>John Wayne Glover (26 November 1932 – 9 September 2005) was an English-Australian serial killer convicted of the murders of six elderly women (aged from 60 to 93), over a period of 14 months from 1989 to 1990. The victims included Winifreda, Lady Ashton, widow of the English-Australian impressionist painter Sir Will Ashton, in suburbs located in Sydney&#x27;s North Shore. Given the advanced age of his victims, after Glover was arrested in 1990, the press nicknamed him The Granny Killer. 

Following his arrest in 1990, he admitted to the murders and was sentenced to consecutive terms of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. He committed suicide by hanging himself in prison on 9 September 2005.

==Biography==
===Background===
Originally from a working-class family in Wolverhampton, England, Glover was convicted of many petty crimes dating back to 1947, mostly for stealing clothing and handbags. He left school at 14. 

He served in the British army but was expelled when these crimes were discovered. He emigrated to Australia in 1956 or 1957 with no qualifications. He first first lived in Melbourne. 

Shortly after emigrating from England to Australia, Glover (who became a naturalised Australian citizen) was convicted on two counts of larceny in Victoria, and a stealing charge in New South Wales. In 1962, he was convicted on two counts of assaulting women in Melbourne, two counts of indecent assault, one of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and another four counts of larceny. He was sentenced to a three-year good-behaviour bond.

He had a troubled relationship with older women in his life, especially his mother Freda (who had several husbands and many boyfriends). After 1968, when he married Gay Rolls and moved into his parents-in-law&#x27;s house in Mosman, Sydney, he also had trouble with his mother-in-law. Glover&#x27;s mother moved to Australia in 1976; she died of breast cancer in 1989. 

Before John Glover began his killings in the late 1980s, he was a volunteer at the Senior Citizens Society. His friends considered him to be a friendly and trustworthy man. He was married with two daughters, and appeared to live a contented lifestyle in Mosman. Glover worked as a sales representative for the Four&#x27;N Twenty meat pie company.

==Murders==
No proof has been found of Glover killing before 1989, when he was 56. At this stage, he had been married for 20 years with children, and his wife had no knowledge of his previous criminal offences. 

Glover admitted to the killings when confronted with the police evidence. He denied responsibility for other crimes in which he was a prime suspect, including the bashing murder of 78-year-old artist Florence Broadhurst in her Paddington studio in 1977. A number of years after his conviction, Glover admitted that he never worried about who his victims were, or why he killed them. He said he wanted to stop killing, but could not. After each murder, he apparently went about his normal life.

===Pre-murder offence===
On 11 January 1989, 84-year-old Margaret Todhunter was walking down Hale Road, Mosman, where she was seen by Glover. After parking his car, he walked up to the victim. He punched Todhunter in the face, and stole the contents of her purse, including $209. Glover went to the Mosman Returned and Services League (RSL) club, where he spent Mrs Todhunter&#x27;s money. Investigating police concluded the crime was a mugging and held little hope of finding the perpetrator.

=== Gwendolin Mitchelhill ===
On 1 March 1989, as Glover left the Mosman RSL in Military Road, he saw 82-year-old Gwendolin Mitchelhill walking down the street. Glover returned to his car and put a hammer under his belt. He followed Mitchelhill to the entry foyer of her Military Road apartment building. As she went to open the front door, he hit her with the hammer on the back of her head. He continued to strike her about the head and body, breaking several of her ribs. Glover fled the scene, taking her purse containing $100. Mitchelhill was still alive when she was found by two schoolboys, but died shortly after the police and ambulance arrived. 

The police had no eyewitnesses or leads and nothing concrete linked this attack with the previous attack on Margaret Todhunter. No forensic evidence was available, either, as well-intentioned neighbours, believing she had merely fallen, had washed the crime scene. The police assumed that it was another mugging gone wrong.

===Lady Winfreda Isabel Ashton (Hoggard)===

On 9 May 1989, Glover was walking along Military Road when he saw 84-year-old Lady Ashton, widow of English-Australian impressionist artist Sir John William Ashton, walking towards him. She was on her way home to nearby Raglan Street. Glover put on a pair of gloves and followed her into the foyer of her apartment, where he attacked her with his hammer. He threw her to the ground and dragged her into a rubbish bin alcove, where he repeatedly hit her head on the pavement. Glover recalled that she had almost overpowered him, until he fell on top of her and started to hit her head on the pavement. After he knocked her unconscious, Glover removed her pantyhose and strangled her. He placed Lady Ashton&#x27;s walking stick and shoes at her feet. He left with her purse containing $100. Glover headed for the Mosman RSL, where he commented to staff that he hoped the sirens outside were not because of another mugging.

The police found Lady Ashton lying face down diagonally across the concrete floor of the small bin alcove. A pool of blood was around her head. The pantyhose was strung so tightly around her neck that it cut through the skin. Her bare legs were crossed and her arms were placed by her sides. She had a thin trickle of blood running out of her mouth. At this point, the police concluded they were facing a serial killer. To date, all three victims were wealthy elderly women, from the same suburb, and all were assaulted or killed in the same manner before being robbed of their handbags.

A &quot;post mortem&quot; examination was carried out and no sign of semen was found. The ligature mark around her neck measured 9 cm. She had bruises on her nose and temple, on her neck, and both her eyelids. At some stage during the struggle, she bit her lips, causing damage to the inner lining of her mouth. A wound was on her cheek, which was an open cut. A small, semicircular abrasion was a few centimetres away from it. The examiner noted the victim&#x27;s diamond ring was still present, suggesting that she had not been killed for money.

===Further offences===
* On 6 June 1989, Glover molested 77-year-old Marjorie Moseley at the Wesley Gardens Retirement Home in Belrose. The victim reported to hospital staff and police that a man had put his hand under her nightgown, but that she could not remember what the man looked like. 
* On 24 June 1989, Glover visited the Caroline Chisholm Nursing Home in Lane Cove, where he lifted the dress of an elderly patient and fondled her buttocks. In a neighbouring room, he slid his hand down the front of another patient&#x27;s nightdress and stroked her breasts. The woman cried out for help and Glover was briefly questioned by staff at the hospital before leaving.
* On 8 August 1989, Glover assaulted the elderly Effie Carnie in a back street of Lindfield, on Sydney&#x27;s upper North Shore.
* On 6 October, Glover pretended to be a doctor and ran his hand up the dress of Phyllis McNeil, a patient at the Wybenia Nursing Home in the lower North Shore suburb of Neutral Bay. Glover left when the blind McNeil called for help. At the time, Glover was apparently never suspected of, or identified as being responsible for the molestations.
* On 18 October 1989, Glover followed 86-year-old widow Doris Cox along Spit Road, Mosman, to her retirement village. In the secluded stairwell at the front of the house, he attacked her, ramming her face into a brick wall, where she fell. Although she survived the assault, she was not able to provide a clear description or recollection of events – probably due to her dementia. According to her, the attacker was a young man, possibly a teenager or skateboarder. Cox assisted police with an identikit drawing, but again, the scene had been cleaned by neighbours before investigators arrived.

===Margaret Pahud===
On 2 November 1989, Glover approached 78-year-old Lane Cove resident Dorothy Beencke while she was walking home in a quiet back street, just off Longueville Road, Lane Cove (about 10 km from Mosman). Glover engaged her in conversation, and offered to carry her groceries home for her. Beencke invited him inside her house for a cup of tea. Glover declined the tea, but on the return down the laneway to the main street, he passed another old woman, and assaulted her from behind.

The victim this time was 85-year-old widow Margaret Pahud (also on her way home from grocery shopping). The investigating police were certain this was the work of the &quot;granny killer&quot;. She was hit on the back of the head with a blunt instrument, and when she collapsed, he struck her again on the side of the head. Glover rearranged her clothing, shoes, and walking stick, took her handbag, and left. Again, nobody saw the attack, but within a few minutes, her body was found by a young schoolgirl, who at first thought the body was a pile of clothing dumped in the laneway. Neighbours again washed down the crime scene before the police arrived. As the police and ambulance were on their way, Glover rummaged through the contents of Pahud&#x27;s purse on the grounds of a nearby golf club. He headed off to the Mosman RSL Club to spend the $300 he had stolen from Pahud.

===Olive Cleveland===
Within 24 hours of the Pahud murder, on 3 November, 81-year-old Olive Cleveland became the fourth woman killed by the now so-called &quot;granny killer&quot;. Glover struck up a conversation with Cleveland while she was sitting on a bench just outside the Wesley Gardens Retirement Village, where she lived in the suburb of Belrose. When Cleveland became uncomfortable, she got up and walked to the main building; but Glover seized her from behind and forced her down a ramp into a secluded side lane. There he hit her and repeatedly pushed her head into the concrete before he removed her pantyhose and tied it tightly around her neck. Once again, Glover rearranged her clothing, shoes, and walking stick, then left, taking money ($60) from her handbag. Once again, the old woman&#x27;s injuries were initially attributed to a heavy fall, and the crime scene was washed down. No eyewitnesses were found. Shortly afterwards, the state government doubled the reward for apprehension of the perpetraator to $200,000.

===Muriel Falconer===
On 23 November 1989, Glover was sitting in the Buena Vista Hotel in Middle Head Road, Mosman, when he saw 93-year-old widow Muriel Falconer walking opposite the hotel (returning home with her shopping). Glover returned to his car (parked opposite the police station), to retrieve his hammer and gloves. He followed Falconer to the exterior of her home in Muston Street. He quietly moved up behind her while the partially deaf and blind Falconer opened her front door. He put his hand around her mouth to silence her, before repeatedly hitting her around the head and neck with his hammer. When she fell to the floor, Glover began to remove Falconer&#x27;s pantyhose. As he did this, she began to regain consciousness and cried for help. This prompted Glover to hit her multiple times with the hammer until she finally passed out. He removed her undergarments and used them to strangle her. He searched her purse and the rest of her house for valuables before leaving with $100, again after rearranging her shoes. 

The following afternoon, the body was discovered by a neighbour, who entered using a spare key. The crime scene was left undisturbed and investigators were able to collect forensic evidence, including bloody shoe prints. A neighbour described a suspect as middle-aged, portly, and grey-haired. The reward was increased to $250,000 by Christmas.

===Police investigation===
On 11 January 1990, Glover visited the Greenwich Hospital in River Road, Greenwich, on his pie sales round. He was in his work uniform and carried a clipboard, and entered the hospital&#x27;s palliative care ward, which held four elderly and ill women, including 82-year-old advanced-cancer patient Daisy Roberts. After Glover asked if she was losing any body heat, he pulled up her nightgown and touched her in an indecent manner. Roberts panicked and called for help, upon which a nurse found Glover in the ward. When confronted, Glover ran from the ward; the nurse was able to record his car&#x27;s registration number, and notified police.

The hospital staff were able to identify and name Glover, as he was known from doing his pie rounds. A week later, the police returned with a photograph of Glover, which both the nurse and Roberts positively identified. Although this was a significant breakthrough, the hospital assaults were not linked to the murders, nor reported to the murder task force for three weeks. Detectives from Chatswood police station contacted and confirmed Glover&#x27;s name via his employers. Detectives contacted Glover and requested he attend an interview at the station the following day. 

When Glover failed to appear, the police rang his home and were informed by his wife that he had attempted suicide by overdose and was recovering at the Royal North Shore Hospital. Police went to the hospital to see Glover, but he declined to be interviewed. He did permit them to take a photograph. Staff at the hospital handed police a suicide note written by Glover. In the middle of the page on Four&#x27;N Twenty Pies business paper, were the words &quot;no more grannies ... grannies&quot; and &quot;Essie [Glover&#x27;s mother-in-law] started it&quot;.

Two weeks later, the suicide note and photo were passed on to the task force (now numbering some 70 members), whereupon detectives believed immediately that Glover was the killer, although they had no evidence. The head of the detective task force said, 
Glover was interviewed over the nursing-home assaults and denied all accusations. Police had limited evidence and decided not to question him about the murders, which would have revealed to Glover their suspicions. Glover was put under constant police surveillance, including at one stage, with an automatic tracking device. To make sure that he was not being followed, Glover would drive around the block more than once, or drive the wrong way up one-way streets.

==Separation== 

Late in 1989, Glover was diagnosed with male breast cancer. He (Glover) separated from his wife, who took their daughters to New Zealand. 

===Joan Sinclair===
On 19 March 1990, Glover killed his sixth and final victim in Mosman. She was 60-year-old divorcee Joan Sinclair from Beauty Point, with whom Glover had a platonic relationship. By this stage, police had Glover under constant surveillance and watched as Sinclair let Glover into her home around 10:00am. By 1:00pm, no sign of Glover or movement within the house was seen. Police and the surveillance team became concerned around 5:00pm, and got permission to enter the house at 6:00pm. Two uniformed police knocked on the front door (ostensibly to check on barking dogs) to no answer, and when looking through the rear glass door, saw a hammer lying in a pool of dry blood on a mat. Four detectives searched the house and found Sinclair&#x27;s battered head wrapped in a bundle of blood-soaked towels. She was naked from the waist down and her pantyhose were tied around her neck. Her genitals were damaged, but Glover later denied raping her. After finding Sinclair&#x27;s body, police searched the house for Glover, who was found unconscious in the filled bathtub.

Glover later told police he had murdered Joan Sinclair and said that they had been having a relationship for some time. He said that he beat her about the head with his hammer, removed her pantyhose, and strangled her with it. Glover rolled the body onto a mat, wrapped four towels around her extensive head wounds to stem the flow of blood, and dragged her body across the room, leaving a trail of blood. He ran the bath, swallowed a handful of Valium with a bottle of Vat 69, slashed his left wrist, and lay in the tub to die.

==Trial==
At the trial, commencing 28 March 1990, Glover pleaded not guilty to his crimes on the grounds of diminished responsibility. A psychiatrist said Glover had built up hostility and aggression against his mother since his childhood. This continued against his mother-in-law, who was said to &quot;trigger&quot; him. When she died, he had to take out his aggression on someone else. 

The psychiatrist who studied the case added that Glover&#x27;s was a very unusual case because few serial killers exist, and most of them are mentally ill, and/or have an organic disease of the brain; Glover was assessed as sane at the time of the murders. Dr. John Shand, a psychiatrist testifying at the trial , said Glover had a severe personality disorder.

The Crown prosecutor maintained that Glover was well aware of his actions. When he killed, he was planning what to do with the victim&#x27;s stolen money, and took time to clean his hammer with acid to destroy forensic evidence. Glover was impotent and had no interest in sex. Tying the pantyhose so tightly around his victims&#x27; necks was to make sure they were dead, while also trying to trick the police into thinking that this was the work of a sexually motivated killer.

Glover was addicted to poker machines. The easiest way for him to get more money for his gambling was to steal. After the guilty verdict was delivered by the jury, Justice Wood stated that he was dealing with an extremely dangerous prisoner:
==&quot;Confession&quot; sketch==
Days before Glover killed himself, he handed his last outside visitor a sketch of a park. Glover noted two pine trees in the image. In the middle of the right pine tree, the number &quot;nine&quot; could be seen between leaves and branches. The number nine is said to represent either the total number of murders or the number of unsolved murders committed by Glover.

Unsolved murders that may have been committed by Glover include:
# Emmie May Anderson, 78, East Melbourne (19 October 1961)
# Irene Kiddle, 61, St Kilda, Victoria (22 March 1963)
# Elsie Boyes, 63, Prahran, Victoria (3 June 1967)
# Christina Yankos, 63, Albert Park (9 April 1968)
# Florence Broadhurst, 78, Paddington, New South Wales (16 October 1977)
# Josephine McDonald, 72, Ettalong, New South Wales (29 August 1984)
# Wanda Amundsen, 83, Umina, New South Wales (21 November 1986)

==Imprisonment and death==
Glover was imprisoned at Lithgow Prison, where he was held in a maximum-security prison cell.

In May 2005 Glover collapsed in his cell and was placed on suicide watch after telling prison officers &quot;I&#x27;ve had enough – I want to kill myself.&quot; He was examined by a mental health review team, and monitored by closed circuit television. He was also given medical examinations as a follow-up to the two cancer surgeries he had undergone the year before.

On 10 September 2005, Glover was found dead in his Lithgow maximum security prison cell and pronounced dead at 1:25 pm. The 72-year-old serial killer was confirmed to have hanged himself.

==Media==
Glover&#x27;s serial murders were the focus of three episodes on different crime series: &quot;Crime Investigation Australia&quot; series-one episode &quot;No More Grannies / The Granny Killer&quot;, series-two episode of &quot;Forensic Investigators&quot; entitled &quot;Granny Killer&quot;, and an episode of &quot;Under Investigation&quot; hosted by Liz Hayes.

<text>Michael Brook (born 1951) is a Canadian guitarist, inventor, music producer, and film music composer. He plays in many genres, including rock, electronica, world music, minimalism and film scores. His collaborations with musicians around the world have made him &quot;one of the most sought-after producers in the music industry.&quot; Born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Brook lives in Los Angeles. He is the creator of the Infinite Guitar.

== Career ==
Brook studied music and electronics at York University and worked as an engineer at the Grant Avenue studios, then owned by the Lanois brothers. Here he worked with Brian Eno, The Edge, Jon Hassell and Harold Budd. In 1985 he released his first solo album &quot;Hybrid&quot;, containing instrumental tracks with Indian and African elements.

Another notable collaboration was &quot;Sleeps with the Fishes&quot; with Clan of Xymox member Pieter Nooten (4AD, 1987). He worked on the album &quot;Set&quot; by Youssou N&#x27;Dour, &quot;Miss America&quot; by Mary Margaret O&#x27;Hara and collaborated with Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan on the album &quot;Mustt Mustt&quot;.

He toured as a member of the Sylvian and Fripp tour group, with the final concert at the Royal Albert Hall in December 1993 documented on the album &quot;&quot;. He also opened the concerts with a solo set, featuring the Infinite Guitar with effects and sequencer backing. In 1998, he produced the album &quot;Volcán: Tributo a José José&quot;, a tribute album to singer Jose Jose. In 2006, the solo album &quot;RockPaperScissors&quot; was released, with an ambient remix version following in 2007. Brook toured small venues in Canada and the United States in late January/early February, 2007. In writing about his score for the film 2015 film &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot; said the film was &quot;buoyed along by a beautiful Michael Brook score and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised his &quot;evocative scoring.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
He was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1996 for his production work and as a co-artist on Pakistani singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan&#x27;s album &quot;Night Song&quot;.

Brook&#x27;s soundtrack to &quot;Into the Wild&quot; was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 2008.

He also contributed a track to The Edge&#x27;s soundtrack for the film Captive (1986). Brook&#x27;s Infinite Guitar was later utilized by The Edge on U2&#x27;s The Joshua Tree (1987).

Two films that he scored, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;Aloft&quot;, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2015.

He won ASCAP awards in 2011 for &quot;The Fighter&quot; and 2013 for &quot;The Vow&quot;. He won the Havana Film Festival award for best music in 2011 for &quot;El Infierno&quot;.

<doc id="1068126" wikidata="Q65176" url="?curid=1068126" title="Alfred Pringsheim">
<text>Alfred Pringsheim (2 September 1850 – 25 June 1941) was a German mathematician and patron of the arts. He was the father-in-law of the author and Nobel Prize winner Thomas Mann.

== Family and academic career ==
Pringsheim was born in Ohlau, Province of Silesia (now Oława, Poland). He came from an extremely wealthy Silesian merchant family with Jewish roots. He was the first-born child and only son of the Upper Silesian railway entrepreneur and coal mine owner Rudolf Pringsheim (1821–1901) and his wife Paula, née Deutschmann (1827–1909). He had a younger sister, Martha.

Pringsheim attended the Maria Magdalena Gymnasium in Breslau, where he excelled in music and mathematics. Starting in 1868 he studied mathematics and physics in Berlin and at the Ruprecht Karl University in Heidelberg. In 1872 he was awarded a doctorate in mathematics, studying under Leo Königsberger. In 1875, he moved from Berlin, where his parents lived, to Munich to earn his habilitation. Two years later he became a lecturer at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich.

In 1886 Pringsheim was appointed associate professor of mathematics there, and in 1901 full professor. He retired as emeritus professor in 1922. He was elected a member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences in 1898, a position he held until 1938, and was a corresponding member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences. He was also awarded membership in the Leopoldina, Germany&#x27;s oldest academy of natural sciences.

Pringsheim considered himself to be a German citizen who no longer followed the &quot;Mosaic belief&quot; (meaning conservative or orthodox Judaism). He repeatedly declined to have himself baptized.

In 1878 Pringsheim married the Berlin actress Gertrude Hedwig Anna Dohm (1855–1942), whose mother was the Berlin advocate of women&#x27;s rights Hedwig Dohm (1831–1919). They had five children: Erik (1879–1909), Peter (born 1881), Heinz (born 1882) and twins born in 1883, Klaus and Katharina, known as Katia. His first-born son, Erik, was exiled to Argentina because of his dissolute life and gambling debts and died there at an early age. His sons Peter and Klaus followed him in pursuing academic careers, obtaining professorships in physics and musical composition. One musician in the family was enough, so his third son, Heinz, became an archaeologist with a doctorate in that field, but soon changed course, becoming a successful conductor and critic in Berlin and Munich. His daughter Katia was the first female in Munich to earn the qualifications for university admission and was one of the first active women students at Munich University. She later became the wife of the author and Nobel Prize winner Thomas Mann.

In 1889 Pringsheim and his family moved into a Neo-Renaissance villa at Arcisstrasse 12 designed by the Berlin architects Kayser &amp; von Großheim with interior furnishings provided by Joh. Wachter and the court furniture manufacturer O. Fritsche of Munich. On major social nights the Munich elite was hosted here in what was known as the Pringsheim Palace. There he had the Romantic painter Hans Thoma, of similar political affiliation, decorate the music room.

Besides mathematics, ever since his youth Pringsheim was also intensively occupied with music, and adapted various compositions of Richard Wagner for the piano.

Later he became interested in the theory and history of art, building up important collections of majolica earthenware and silver. His was the largest and most important private collection of majolica in Germany consisting of 440 pieces. He also collected enamels, stained-glass panels, tapestries, and paintings by Franz von Lenbach.

In his novel &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, Thomas Mann portrayed his father-in-law as the character Samuel Spoelman.
== Mathematical investigations ==
In mathematical analysis, Pringsheim studied real and complex functions, following the power-series-approach of the Weierstrass school. Pringsheim published numerous works on the subject of complex analysis, with a focus on the summability theory of infinite series and the boundary behavior of analytic functions.

One of Pringsheim&#x27;s theorems, according to Hadamard earlier proved by E. Borel, states that a power series with positive coefficients and radius of convergence equal to 1 has necessarily a singularity at the point 1.
This theorem is used in analytic combinatorics and the Perron–Frobenius theory of positive operators on ordered vector spaces.

Another theorem named after Pringsheim gives an analyticity criterion for a C∞ function on a bounded interval, based on the behaviour of the radius of convergence of the Taylor expansion around a point of the interval.
However, Pringsheim&#x27;s original proof had a flaw (related to uniform convergence), and a correct proof was provided by Ralph P. Boas.

Pringsheim and Ivan Śleszyński, working separately, proved what is now called the Śleszyński–Pringsheim theorem on convergence of certain continued fractions.

Besides his research in analysis, Pringsheim also wrote articles for the &quot;Enzyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften&quot; on the fundamentals of arithmetic and on number theory. He published papers in the &quot;Mathematische Annalen&quot;. As an officer of the &quot;Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften&quot;, he recorded the minutes of its scientific meetings.

He also proved a significant part of the Abel–Dini–Pringsheim theorem, a convergence test for a series in which the nth term is divided by the nth partial sum.

== Acquaintance with the Wagner family ==
Pringsheim had a deep, early interest in music and was especially fascinated by the works of Richard Wagner. He corresponded with Wagner personally, and he took Wagner&#x27;s letters with him when he went into exile to Switzerland. His musical inclinations led to the publication of several arrangements of Wagner&#x27;s work, and he also wrote on subjects in the field of music.

His association with Wagner was so intense that Pringsheim supported Wagner financially to a significant extent, and also backed the Bayreuth music festival. In gratitude, he received a certificate designating him as a patron, which guaranteed him a seat at certain performances. In her memoirs about this acquaintance with Wagner, his granddaughter, Erika Mann, wrote that Prof. Pringsheim was even once involved in a duel because someone had insulted Wagner.

== Financial situation ==
His family&#x27;s fortune left Pringsheim a wealthy man. He also had a sizeable monthly income as a full professor at the university. After the death of the family patriarch in 1913 he had at his disposal assets amounting to 13 million marks and an annual income of 800,000 marks, which is today equivalent to 10.5 million euro and 646,000 euro, respectively.

Pringsheim&#x27;s financial decline began with World War I. As a “German patriot” he subscribed to war loans which lost their nominal value after the war, which meant the loss of a major part of his capital. The disastrous inflation of 1923 and 1924 resulted in additional high losses. As a result, he had to sell part of his art collection, which probably included a mural by Hans Thoma. He commented, ironically, “I live from wall to mouth”. He also had to sell his marvellous mathematics library which contained many precious books dating back to the sixteenth century. The auction catalogue is still preserved in the &quot;Bayerische Staatsbibliothek&quot;.

== Nazi persecution ==
When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Pringsheim was persecuted because of his Jewish origins. In 1933, the Nazis seized the Pringsheim Palace. In 1934, he refused to take a loyalty oath to Hitler&#x27;s Nazi government. The Pringheim&#x27;s passports were canceled by the Nazi authorities in early 1937. 

Primarily because of his age (he was in his mid-80s) he did not want to go abroad, as did most of his family, and remained in Germany. One of many antisemitic pieces of Nazi legislation, the which came into effect 1 January 1938, forced him to legally change his name into &quot;Alfred Israel Pringsheim&quot; at age 87. At first, he was not allowed to leave the country. Winifred Wagner was not able to help the elderly Wagner devotee in this respect. Through the intervention of the then-rector of Munich University (LMU), his former neighbor Karl Haushofer, who was a friend of Rudolf Hess, and the professor of mathematics Oskar Perron, one of Alfred Pringsheim&#x27;s former students, as well as through the initiative of a courageous member of the SS who arranged for passports at the last minute, he and his wife were able to leave for Zürich, Switzerland on 31 October 1939 after suffering further grave humiliations.

During Kristallnacht, in November 1938, the SS seized Pringsheim&#x27;s maiolica collection from his home in Munich. His world famous collection of majolica was sold in a forced sale by the Nazis at Sotheby&#x27;s in London in 1939 in exchange for permission to emigrate. The fate of his goldsmith collection is less well known.

Pringsheim&#x27;s house was forceably sold to the Nazi party. It was torn down and replaced by a party administration building. The files of all German Nazi party members were stored there until 1945. Today it houses the Institute of Art History of Munich University (LMU) and the offices of the Munich State Collection of Antiquities, among others entities.

Pringsheim died on 25 June 1941 in Zürich. His wife then apparently burned all of the personal effects which had been brought to Switzerland, including the letters from Richard Wagner. She died one year later.

== Restitution claims ==
Pringheim&#x27;s heirs have requested that artworks looted by the Nazis and sold in forced sales be returned to the family. According to Christie&#x27;s some of the works were restituted in 1953. However, other sources specify that there was a financial settlement with the German government. In 2008 Pringheim&#x27;s heirs asked the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen Foundation to restitute to them seven pieces of Italian maiolica that the museum had acquired by the collector J.N. Bastert. Research into paintings and other objects is ongoing. More than 400 artworks are registered with the German Lost Art Foundation in its Lostart database.

<text>Disco Bloodbath: A Fabulous but True Tale of Murder in Clubland is a 1999 memoir written by James St. James about his life as a Manhattan celebutante and Club Kid. The book specifically chronicles his friend Michael Alig&#x27;s rise to fame, and Alig and his roommate&#x27;s subsequent murder of fellow club kid and drug dealer Andre &quot;Angel&quot; Melendez. St. James was Alig&#x27;s mentor, rival, and collaborator in the Manhattan party scene and was familiar with many of its key figures. The memoir was later retitled &quot;Party Monster&quot; after the 2003 motion picture of that name starring Macaulay Culkin, Seth Green, Chloë Sevigny, and Marilyn Manson.

&quot;Disco Bloodbath&quot; has since gone out of print and often goes for several hundred dollars in auctions. It was only printed three times: in 1999, twice in paperback with different colored jackets, and once in hardcover. It was reprinted in 2003 under the title &quot;Party Monster - The Fabulous but True Tale of Murder in Clubland&quot; (); paperbacks are widely available.

==Characters==

===Michael Alig===

Michael Alig was a founder of the notorious Club Kids, a group of young clubgoers led by Alig in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1996, Alig and his roommate, Robert D. &quot;Freeze&quot; Riggs, were convicted of murdering Andre &quot;Angel&quot; Melendez in a confrontation over a delinquent debt.

===DJ Keoki===

Superstar DJ Keoki is an electronic music DJ who was born in El Salvador but raised in Hawaii. He had no experience as a DJ when he was branded &quot;Superstar DJ Keoki&quot;. It was infamous partykid (later, murderer) Michael Alig who helped in the early promotion of his then boyfriend DJ Keoki.

===James St. James===

James St. James (born James Clark) was a Club Kid of the Manhattan nightclub scene in the late 1980s/early 1990s, Alig&#x27;s mentor, and the author of the book. He was notorious for a lifestyle of excess that included heavy drug use, partying, and bizarre costumes. St. James continues to work with World of Wonder, the production company that produced the films &quot;Party Monster: The Shockumentary&quot; (1998) and &quot;Party Monster&quot; (2003), both based on St. James&#x27; memoirs, &quot;Disco Bloodbath: A Fabulous but True Tale of Murder in Clubland&quot;.

===Andre Melendez===

Andre Melendez, better known as Angel Melendez, was a Club Kid and purported drug dealer who lived and worked in New York City. Melendez and his family arrived in New York from Colombia when Melendez was 8 years old. Melendez became a drug dealer during the early 1990s after meeting Peter Gatien, owner of The Limelight and several other prominent nightclubs in New York City, and became a regular dealer in Gatien&#x27;s clubs. He was frequently seen at Manhattan clubs wearing his trademark feathered wings.

<doc id="1068129" wikidata="Q494665" url="?curid=1068129" title="Pieter Jelles Troelstra">
<text>Pieter Jelles Troelstra (; 20 April 186012 May 1930) was a Dutch lawyer, journalist and politician active in the socialist workers&#x27; movement. He is most remembered for his fight for universal suffrage and his failed call for revolution at the end of World War I.

==Early and personal life==
Troelstra was born 20 April 1860 in Leeuwarden and grew up in the village of Stiens, where his father was a liberal tax inspector. He was an ethnic Frisian, and his name is styled in the traditional Frisian way: first name (&quot;Pieter&quot;, because of his Frisian writings, is often written as &quot;Piter&quot;, as it is spelled in Frisian), patronymic (&quot;Jelles&quot;, meaning &quot;son of Jelle&quot;), family name (Troelstra).

He went on to study law at the University of Groningen. After graduation, he settled in Leeuwarden as a lawyer. He became involved in politics and the workers&#x27; movement through a Frisian movement, later to be known as the &quot;&quot; (Frisian People&#x27;s Party). He had originally joined this movement because of his poetry and interest in the West Frisian language. Through the movement and his work as a lawyer, he got into the social democratic part of this wide movement.

From 1888 to 1904, Troelstra was married to Sjoukje Bokma de Boer, a well-known children&#x27;s book writer under the pen name of Nienke van Hichtum, with whom he had two children, one being Jelle Troelstra.

==Involvement with SDB==
In 1890, Troelstra joined the Social Democratic League (SDB), an early Dutch socialist movement under the leadership of Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis. In time, he got into conflict with the anarchist tendencies of the movement. In 1893, the SDB took a decisive anti-parliamentary stance, and Troelstra no longer believed it could do any useful socialist work.

==Founding of SDAP==
After trying to get some members of the SDB to join him, he was one of the twelve men who started the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (SDAP) in 1894. Unlike the old SDB, the SDAP was more like its German counterpart, then still also named the SDAP, which was taking a more reformist course, trying to get social law implemented, while still keeping the ideal of revolution up.

From around 1903 he and Henri Polak edited the Sociale Bibliotheek book series, whose publisher in 1914 was the Commissie voor de Schriftelijke Propaganda Brochurenhandel S.D.A.P. in Amsterdam.

==Hogerhuis Case==
In 1897, Troelstra, who now earned a living as a lawyer, got involved in the infamous Hogerhuis Case concerning three brothers (Keimpe, Wybren and Marten Hogerhuis) who were being prosecuted for the burglary of a rich farmer. Although the evidence against the brothers was shaky at best, they were nonetheless sentenced to lengthy prison terms, leading to accusations of (legal discrimination based on wealth or education).

Troelstra was the member of parliament for the district of Leeuwarden, close to the men&#x27;s village of Beetgum, and was drawn into the case after the brothers&#x27; conviction. He collected additional evidence, which he published in socialist newspapers. One of his revelations was that soon after the burglary, three men had quickly emigrated to America and Germany. However, Troelstra did not manage to get the case retried. The affair gained fame, particularly in socialist circles, as the Dutch pendant of the French Dreyfus Affair, and Troelstra&#x27;s role was, perhaps not coincidentally, not unlike that played by Émile Zola. Despite the failure of his efforts (the brothers served most of their sentence), they contributed to Troelstra&#x27;s reputation and goodwill in the Frisian countryside.

==SDAP leader==
Troelstra was inclusive in his outlook. As leader of the parliamentary faction of the SDAP, he did not insist upon a tight party line. That permitted a period of harmony within the SDAP between 1894 and 1900.

Both within and outside parliament, the SDAP proved to be a powerful force, despite its relatively small representation in the House of Representatives. However, the socialists felt a moral advantage because parliament was hardly an accurate representation of the people, and they used their possibilities to the full, among other things by filibustering (each representative had unlimited speaking time). When, in 1911 a majority of parliament refused to vote on an SDAP motion, the anger of the party was expressed by one of its most fiery speakers, :
In that case, the inkwells will fly through the room... I cannot be held accountable for anything. I assure you, we will start throwing chairs.The antagonism between the SDAP and more conservative forces would cause bitterness for a long time afterwards and also explains many of Troelstra&#x27;s actions.

==1913 elections and universal suffrage==
Troelstra&#x27;s biggest political issue was universal suffrage in the Netherlands. This struggle reached its climax in 1910 to 1913. After electoral success in the 1913 general election, the SDAP was offered a place in a coalition government. The proposed coalition had plans for universal suffrage, but a party congress renounced such a close co-operation with its traditional enemy. Some MPs, such as the SDAP&#x27;s co-founders Willem Vliegen and Schaper, were very distraught over what they saw as a tactical disaster. Vliegen wrote in 1934:
I have never been able to prefer a government without social democrats over one with them, as evident as it may be that one cannot entertain all company. I still think that the refusal to accept government responsibility in 1913 is one of the most significant errors the SDAP ever made.

There is evidence to suggest that Troelstra himself was rather relieved; he had only reluctantly supported the request for government participation. Universal suffrage was eventually steered through parliament in 1917, by the liberal minority cabinet of Pieter Cort van der Linden.

==Red Week (November 1918)==

Inspired by the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the German Revolution of 1918–1919, Troelstra made a historic if ill-advised move. In November 1918, he used a speech in the traditional worker stronghold of Rotterdam to call for a socialist revolution in the Netherlands. However, it was not followed up by any revolutionary activity on the side of other SDAP activists, who were as surprised by Troelstra&#x27;s declaration as most other people. The government, on the other hand, reacted quickly and sent troops to the major cities. In addition, a counter-campaign was set up to emphasise loyalty to the House of Orange.

By that time, it had become clear that the attempted revolution, for which Troelstra had gathered very little support even among his own party, had failed. The events are known as the Red Week (Dutch: &quot;Roode Week&quot;) or, more commonly, &quot;Troelstra&#x27;s mistake&quot; (Dutch: &quot;Vergissing van Troelstra&quot;).

==Later life==
After all this Troelstra was broken and stayed at home, but a party conference two weeks later received him with a standing ovation. Although he could defend the position that the party had never had actual plans for a coup, his reputation had taken irreparable damage, both inside and outside the party.

The SDAP would not be invited to form any other government until the national cabinet of 1939. However, the establishment and the right wing had been frightened. In the next cabinet, under Hendrikus Colijn, social reforms were started to reduce discontent and to deny the socialists further support.

Troelstra is still an inspirational figure for many in the Dutch workers&#x27; movement.

He withdrew from politics in 1925 and devoted much time, despite ever declining health, to dictating his memoirs to his secretary, the later Amsterdam alderman . These memoirs (&quot;Gedenkschriften&quot;), which appeared in four volumes (&quot;Genesis&quot;, &quot;Growth&quot;, &quot;Surf&quot; and &quot;Storm&quot;) after 1925, almost became part of the furniture in the houses of many Dutch workers, further testimony to Troelstra&#x27;s reputation among his followers.

Troelstra died 12 May 1930 in The Hague. The section in The Hague of the Labour Party, the successor of the SDAP, celebrates at a monument to Troelstra.

<text>The Young Turks (TYT) is an American populist news commentary show live streamed on social media platforms YouTube and Twitch. It additionally appears on selected television channels. &quot;TYT&quot; serves as the flagship program of the TYT Network, a multi-channel network of associated web series focusing on news and current events. TYT covers American politics, wars and conflicts in the Middle East, sports, and a wide array of other topics. The program was created by Cenk Uygur, Ben Mankiewicz and Dave Koller. Uygur is Turkish-American and named the program after the Young Turks movement of the 20th century. Currently co-hosted by Uygur and Ana Kasparian, it is also often accompanied by various other in-studio contributors. &quot;The Young Turks&quot; began as a radio program that premiered on February 14, 2002, on Sirius Satellite Radio before launching a web series component in 2005 on YouTube, and then later Twitch; at some point it was also carried on Air America.

In addition to being carried on YouTube and Twitch, it is also currently available on Amazon Prime Direct, iTunes, Hulu, Roku, and on social media platforms Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. It has spawned two spin-off television series, one that aired on Current TV from 2011 to 2013 and a second that debuted on Fusion in 2016 as a limited-run program developed to cover the 2016 United States presidential election. &quot;The Young Turks&quot; also served as the subject of a documentary, entitled &quot;Mad as Hell&quot;, which was released in 2014. The network also has a channel on YouTube TV. For most of its existence &quot;TYT&quot; relied on small grassroots financial contributions from its viewership to sustain itself as an independent news organization. However, in 2017 &quot;TYT&quot; sought to expand its media network and hire more staff through various venture capital fundraising efforts that raised $20 million.

&quot;The Young Turks&quot; is the second longest-running online news and politics talk show (after &quot;The Alex Jones Show&quot; started in 1999).

==Format==
&quot;The Young Turks&quot; live streams for up to three hours, with its story selection and associated commentary broken up by format. Issues that the show focuses on include national political news, the influence of money in the political process, drug policy, social security, the privatization of public services, climate change, the influence of religion, abortion and reproductive rights, civil rights and issues of injustice towards people of color and sexual minorities, sexual morality, and the influence of corporations, neutrality and establishment political thought on traditional news media. The program maintains a liberal/progressive ideology in its political commentary. Co-creator and host Cenk Uygur describes himself as an &quot;independent progressive&quot; and asserts that the show is aimed at the &quot;98 percent &#x27;not in power&#x27;&quot; and what he describes as the 60 percent of Americans who hold progressive views.

The two-hour main show is usually hosted by Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, with a rotating cast of other progressive co-hosts, including John Iadarola, Jayar Jackson and more. The first hour usually focuses on American politics, foreign policy and breaking news headlines. The second hour generally provides social commentary on a wide range of topics, both domestic and foreign. The program also features a post-game show, in which Uygur and Kasparian discuss their personal lives. Uygur has regular bits and on-air interaction with other staff members who create and run the show, including among others Jesús Godoy, Dave Koller, Jayar Jackson and Steve Oh.

Each Friday, &quot;The Young Turks&quot; features a panel of guests from the worlds of politics, journalism, pop culture, sports and comedy – dubbed the &quot;TYT Power Panel&quot; – that is led by Uygur and John Iadarola in the first hour, and Ugyur and/or Jayar Jackson in the second hour. Along with Iadarola and Jackson, other fill-in hosts and recurring guests include series co-creator/contributor Ben Mankiewicz, television personality Brian Unger, Becca Frucht, Brett Erlich, Wes Clark Jr., Michael Shure, Cara Santa Maria, RJ Eskow, Gina Grad, Samantha Schacher, and Jayde Lovell.

==Production==

&quot;The Young Turks&quot; is broadcast in a two-to-three hour live stream format, which airs Monday through Fridays at 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time. The program was originally based out of the living room of creator/host Cenk Uygur, but it moved production to a small office in Los Angeles after the show hired a limited staff to produce the program. When the program was given a secondary live show on Current TV in 2011, the network provided a larger studio in Los Angeles to house its television and online broadcasts; production was forced to leave the facility after Current TV was sold to Al Jazeera, prior to the network&#x27;s conversion into the now-defunct generalized news service Al Jazeera America.

In 2013, &quot;The Young Turks″&quot; production staff relocated temporarily to new studio quarters at YouTube Space LA in Los Angeles. In October 2013, &quot;The Young Turks&quot; launched an Indiegogo campaign, aimed at raising $250,000 in order to build a new studio. Fundraising completed with $400,000 being raised. The program moved its production facilities and staff operations to a new studio facilities in Los Angeles later that year, with construction of their new studio being completed in June 2015. In 2017, TYT sought to expand its media network and hire more staff through various venture capital fundraising efforts that raised $20-million.

==History==

===Radio program===
&quot;The Young Turks&quot; was originally developed as a radio talk show that was similar in format to a Los Angeles-based public access television program that Cenk Uygur had hosted, titled &quot;The Young Turk&quot;. With the help of friend Ben Mankiewicz (with whom he had previously worked), his childhood friend Dave Koller, and Jill Pike, Uygur began &quot;The Young Turks&quot; as a radio program in February 2002 on Sirius Satellite Radio.

In 2006, the program received attention for its 99-hour &quot;Live on Air Filibuster,&quot; conducted during Congressional hearings for the nomination of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court. Hosts including Thom Hartmann and John Amato filled in during the event, to allow the show&#x27;s regular hosts and contributors to rest or take breaks.

Prior to signing a distribution deal to carry the program on Air America in 2006, the show was broadcast on Sirius Satellite Radio, on Sirius Left 143 and later 146, airing weekdays from 6:00 to 9:00 pm. Eastern Time; a day-behind rebroadcast of the program aired on Sirius Talk Central 148 weekday afternoons from 12:00 to 2:00 pm. Eastern. Being carried exclusively on Sirius for several years, &quot;The Young Turks&quot; was the first show to air exclusively on Sirius Left that was not distributed through a syndication network. TYT was also carried by KFH (1330 AM and 98.7 FM, now KNSS (AM) and KNSS-FM) in Wichita, Kansas each weeknight from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. Central Time and webcast by RadioPower.org.

On February 2, 2009, TYT was removed from the broadcast schedule of America Left, a progressive talk channel carried on Sirius/XM Channel 167, and replaced by an additional hour of &quot;The Bill Press Show&quot;. The program returned to Sirius/XM on March 16, 2009. In late 2010, TYT announced through its Facebook page that it would discontinue carrying the program on Sirius/XM Satellite Radio; the last edition of &quot;The Young Turks&quot; to be carried on the service aired on November 19, 2010. TYT rejoined Sirius/XM in 2017 with the show being run on SiriusXM Progress.

===Web series===

&quot;The Young Turks&quot; was the first daily streaming online talk show, having begun airing in that format in 2006, with an official website on the internet and a channel hosted on YouTube. The show provides in-depth coverage on politics, news topics, current events, and other issues.

In August 2007, Ben Mankiewicz left the show to serve as a contributor for TMZ&#x27;s syndicated entertainment news program &quot;TMZ on TV&quot;. At roughly the same time, Jill Pike left to pursue a job in Washington, D.C. Ana Kasparian, then working as an intern for the program, was hired to do pop culture-focused segments. Mankiewicz eventually returned to &quot;The Young Turks&quot; as a regular correspondent.

During the 2008 elections, the show developed close ties to Brave New Films. The program aired commercials for the independent film production company and featured actors such as Robert Greenwald and Jonathan Kim as guests.

The success of TYT is due to a large extent of their shift from radio to the internet through the broadcast of programming content on online platforms. Uygur and co-host Kasparian applied a populist left branding and programming strategy that made TYT a successful global online organization, with larger numbers of YouTube subscribers and viewers than several other notable news networks like FOX, MSNBC and CNN. The presence of TYT on YouTube has given the network a platform to democratize production of content and practices associated with its online distribution through an ability to share, comment and like material on its channel. Through likes and shares of TYT content on many online platforms, audience members have become a &quot;virtual word of mouth&quot; expanding the network&#x27;s reach to other people with similar views and stimulating the growth of the TYT community.

Support by viewers for alternative media outlets like TYT adopting new technology has meant the network was able to overcome being a small sized organization of the traditional alternative media landscape. The emergence of TYT in the digital era has resulted in fewer operational costs regarding organizing and communication. TYT nonetheless has relied on small grassroots financial contributions from its viewers that gave it the ability to emerge as an alternative media organization that does not advocate for the interests of corporations. The financial contributions TYT received went to renting a studio, and to purchase production equipment and furniture. By 2010, TYT employed people and maintained a budget resembling the size of a small newspaper.

On July 30, 2013, &quot;The Young Turks&quot; launched a TYT Network app on Roku, which features much of the same content that is already available for free through the program&#x27;s YouTube channel, which has over 4.2 million subscribers and generates 50 million monthly views. The network is among the few online channels to generate more than 1 billion views since launching on YouTube, which does not market a channel on the Roku app store. Young Turks COO Steve Oh acknowledged that making the TYT Network available on Roku was the first part of a strategy to continue the network&#x27;s growth, regardless of what medium in which its viewers are watching its content, with the intent to figure out a way to monetize its programming through multiple distribution channels, rather than relying on one or two larger channels (such as YouTube or cable television distribution). The network also announced plans to unveil native apps for iOS and Android devices. Oh also noted that the network&#x27;s representatives were speaking with other media platforms about expanding its programming.

In April 2014, &quot;The Young Turks&quot; began offering its content on Hulu. With this, it began providing a condensed 30-minute version of the program featuring excerpts from the full two-hour daily show, along with a 30-minute weekly version of its daily pop-culture show &quot;PopTrigger&quot;, with other shows being added shortly afterward. Oh stated on the Hulu launch that, &quot;as TYT Network has grown from a single show to an entire network, we&#x27;ve consistently found ways to bring our shows to more people[..] We&#x27;ve long admired Hulu as a leader of online video and both parties saw an opportunity to bring digitally-native politics and pop culture talk shows to Hulu&#x27;s audience.&quot; He also stated that the company is pitching shows to cable network, but had no immediate plans to revive a television broadcast as either a relaunched program or a show similar in format to the one it formerly produced for Current TV.

The website&#x27;s yearly revenue was roughly US$3 million in 2013. According to Cenk Uygur, &quot;about a third of the revenue comes from subscriptions, and the rest comes from YouTube ads.&quot; At that time, the company maintained a staff of 30 employees. In 2014, the company received a US$4 million investment from Roemer, Robinson, Melville &amp; Co., LLC, a private equity firm led by Republican former Louisiana Governor Buddy Roemer. In December 2016, TYT Network launched a crowdfunding campaign aiming to raise US$2 million for the hiring of four further investigative teams. Five months later, the aim was met. In August 2017, it was announced that The Young Turks have raised $20 million in venture-capital from 3L Capital, WndrCo (owned by businessman Jeffrey Katzenberg), Greycroft, and e.ventures. TYT stated it would use the funds to &quot;hire additional management execs and creative talent, as well as enhance its subscription-video offering and expand marketing initiatives&quot;. Shawn Colo, managing partner of 3L Capital, joined the TYT Network&#x27;s board.

TYT operates under a strategy of diversifying its finances that involves the airing of socially responsible advertisements, offering subscriptions for TYT membership, selling its own merchandise and other investments. Among its advertising partners is Aspiration Bank, an organization involved in &quot;socially conscious and sustainable banking services&quot; and whom TYT presents as different from other banks and their fossil fuel and campaign financing investments. Due to popular demand from viewers, TYT established an online outlet selling its own label branded merchandise, such as t-shirts, that are often designed and voted upon through the input of its audience. Its online subscription membership has two plans, &quot;insider&quot; offering full web content access and discounts, and &quot;activist&quot;, offering additional access to its townhalls and political events.

Following the 2016 election, TYT fundraised for small grassroots donations among its members, raising thousands of dollars and created a media division named &quot;TYT Investigates&quot; devoted to investigative journalism with the aim to hold people with power to account. Operating as a watchdog outfit, &quot;TYT Investigates&quot; investigative journalists report on issues such as inequalities in the economic system, power held by corporations, and other topics sidelined by traditional media like the views of ordinary citizens at political events. For example, TYT journalist Emma Vigeland has attended US President Donald Trump&#x27;s political rallies and interviewed supporters.

In mid-December 2017, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that TYT was courting former CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather to host a news show. On January 21, 2018, TYT confirmed that it will show &quot;The News with Dan Rather&quot;, a half-hour &quot;untraditional evening newscast&quot; weekly on Mondays in the time slot before the main Young Turks show.

===Linear channel===
On May 17, 2018, The Young Turks launched a 24-hour linear channel on YouTube TV which includes all of TYT&#x27;s current shows and four new shows called &quot;The Damage Report&quot;, &quot;#NoFilter&quot;,&quot;The Happy Half Hour&quot; and &quot;Old-School Sports&quot;. The channel has since been made available on The Roku Channel and Xumo as well.

==Reception==
In a September 2006 article, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; contributing writer Paul Bedard described TYT as &quot;the loudly liberal counter to the right-leaning presets on my Sirius Satellite Radio.&quot; In 2014, &quot;The Independent&quot; described it as &quot;the most-watched online news show in the world.&quot;

The network is reliant on its multimedia platforms to attract online viewers and its audience are &quot;young, educated, affluent and politically interested&quot; people who consume news from online sources. As a result of ongoing TYT membership drives, its base of subscribed members has grown numbering 32,000 in 2019. Per month, the media outlet receives 200 million views. On YouTube, its main show, The Young Turks, has more than 4.7 million subscribers. Over 12 million viewers (2019) are subscribed to its multiple online channels. TYT has become one of the largest watched online networks, with its videos seen over 8 billion times (2019). TYT&#x27;s millennial viewership ranks the network first for news and politics across its online platforms.

===Awards and nominations===
&quot;The Young Turks&quot; has won and been nominated for numerous Internet content awards, including, but not limited to the following:

* In 2009, the program won in the Political category at the Podcast Awards, and won for &quot;Best Political News Site&quot; at the Mashable Open Web Awards.
* In 2010, it was nominated for a Streamy Award for &quot;Best News or Political Web Series&quot; and the &quot;Audience Choice Award for Best Web Series&quot;.
* In 2011, the program won in the News category at the Third Annual Shorty Awards, and won for &quot;Best News and Political Series&quot; at that year&#x27;s Webby Awards.
* In 2012, it won in the Best Video Podcast category at the Podcast Awards .
* In 2013, the program was nominated for two Streamy Awards in the Best News and Culture Series and Audience Choice Award for Series of the Year categories.
* In 2015, &quot;The Young Turks&quot; also won a Streamy Award in the News and Culture category.
* In 2017, TYT won the Shorty Awards Audience Honor for the Best in Overall YouTube Presence.

Other awards won by &quot;The Young Turks&quot; in the 2010s were &quot;Best Political News Site&quot; and the &quot;People&#x27;s Voice Webby Award&quot; in all 5 of its categories.

==Viewer statistics==
On April 20, 2013, &quot;The Young Turks&quot; announced that its YouTube channel had received over 1 billion video views.

In September 2018, the company launched a membership drive, reporting the number of members to be around 27,000. As of August 2018, TYT had approximately 27,000 paying subscribers online.

As of September 2017, the program&#x27;s YouTube channel averaged a daily hit count of 2 million views.

By August 2016, Cenk Uygur reported that number of paid subscribers had increased to more than 23,000. By October 2016, the total number of views for the TYT Network&#x27;s YouTube channel had surpassed 3 billion.

==Controversies==
===Name controversy===
The show&#x27;s name &quot;Young Turks&quot; has been criticized and called for change due to the Committee of Union and Progress&#x27; conflation with the larger Young Turks political movement in the Ottoman Empire which was responsible for committing the Armenian genocide, the Assyrian genocide, and the Greek genocide. Alex Galitsky, who works for the Armenian National Committee of America, stated &quot;If a group decided to call themselves ‘the Young Nazis’, and pitched themselves as a disruptor or anti-establishment news outlet, people would be rightly outraged&quot;.

In 1991, Cenk Uygur wrote an article in &quot;The Daily Pennsylvanian&quot;, the student newspaper of the University of Pennsylvania, in which he promoted Armenian genocide denial. In 2016, Cenk Uygur posted a statement on &quot;TYT&quot;″s website in which he rescinded his Armenian genocide denial statements, arguing: &quot;My mistake at the time was confusing myself for a scholar of history, which I most certainly am not. I don’t want to make the same mistake again, so I am going to refrain from commenting on the topic of the Armenian Genocide, which I do not know nearly enough about.&quot; In response to the criticism he has explained that the name of the show was chosen because it is a popular colloquialism traditionally meaning a young radical who fights the status quo.

===Dismissal of Jordan Chariton===
In November 2017, &quot;TYT&quot; fired field reporter Jordan Chariton over sexual assault allegations made against him by &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. Chariton denied the accusations, considered legal actions and later he settled the matter with &quot;TYT&quot;.

===Unionization of &quot;TYT&quot; staff===
In late February 2020, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) sought to unionize the production and post-production staff at &quot;TYT&quot;. Uygur urged his employees not to, as he stated &quot;TYT&quot; is a small media organization and the move would endanger its financial viability; however, the network supported its workers holding a secret ballot to unionize. Employees expressed support for an open ballot and a bargaining process followed. On April 9, 2020, nine of fifteen members voted in favor to have their own union and unionize with IATSE, with the majority decision being approved by &quot;TYT&quot;.

===Resignation of Mondale Robinson===
In December 2024, &quot;TYT&quot; contributor and mayor of Enfield, North Carolina, Mondale Robinson, resigned live on air over what he views as Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian&#x27;s shift away from progressive principles and embrace of the Make America Great Again movement and conservative personalities such as Glenn Beck.

==Television spin-offs==

===&quot;The Young Turks with Cenk Uygur&quot;===
The first linear television incarnation of the program began as an hour-long show that premiered on Current TV on December 5, 2011. Co-created and hosted by Cenk Uygur (who executive produced the series with original program co-creator Dave Koller, with Jesus Godoy, Jayar Jackson and Mark Register serving as producers), the program was co-presented by Ana Kasparian, with Ben Mankiewicz, Michael Shure, Brian Unger, Wes Clark Jr. and RJ Eskow as contributors and correspondents. It was filmed at studio facilities in the Los Angeles suburb of Culver City.

Current TV announced the launch of a separate television broadcast of &quot;The Young Turks&quot; on September 20, 2011, with the program intending to air Monday through Friday evenings at 7:00 pm. Eastern Time beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011. It was the second news and opinion program to air on Current, alongside &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;, and was part of a strategy to refocus the network&#x27;s prime time schedule around progressive talk programming (which was followed by the debut of &quot;The War Room with Jennifer Granholm&quot; in January 2012). According to the show&#x27;s website, the show was titled &quot;The Young Turks with Cenk Uygur&quot; to differentiate itself from the popular web series. For two years, the two separate shows were produced each Monday through Thursday, with a one-hour break between the production airtimes of the television and web shows. In a press release, representatives for Current described TYT as &quot;a group of progressive, outspoken journalists and commentators discussing politics and pop culture&quot; and founder Cenk Uygur as bringing a, &quot;uniquely progressive and topical commentary about politics and pop culture.&quot;

On January 2, 2013, Current TV was sold to Qatar-owned broadcaster Al Jazeera Media Network, which announced plans to reorganize the channel as Al Jazeera America, focusing on world news and investigative content with a more neutral tone; with the move, the channel would discontinue its talk programming slate, including &quot;The Young Turks with Cenk Ugyur&quot;, which ended its run on Current TV on August 15, 2013, shortly before the network&#x27;s relaunch.

In an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; Uygur commented that with the discontinuance of the television broadcast, he was relieved to move on and focus on his web show and the TYT Network site, stating that he had been &quot;exhausted from doing the two shows at once&quot; and that he was glad to put his energies there, as he believes that the future of media will gravitate towards online content. Uygur also noted that he talked with Al Jazeera after the company bought Current, reaching a mutual agreement not to continue with the television broadcast due to the change in ideological tone that Al Jazeera America would maintain. However, members of &quot;The Young Turks″&quot; on-air contributing staff, such as Michael Shure (who served as a political and general assignment contributor), Cara Santa Maria (part of TechKnow) and Ben Mankiewicz (who worked as a movie critic), regularly appeared on Al Jazeera America. &quot;The Young Turks&quot; also maintain a partnership with Al Jazeera&#x27;s digital channel AJ+, in an arrangement first announced in March 2015.

===&quot;The Young Turks on Fusion&quot;===
&quot;The Young Turks&quot; returned to television with a weekly, hour-long program on Fusion, &quot;The Young Turks on Fusion&quot;, which premiered on September 12, 2016, for a twelve-week limited run. Hosted by Ana Kasparian and John Iadarola, the program – which was broadcast from college campuses around the United States, in a live-audience format modelled after ESPN&#x27;s &quot;College GameDay&quot; – focused on coverage of the 2016 United States presidential campaign. The show also featured Cenk Uygur, Jimmy Dore, Ben Mankiewicz, Hannah Cranston, Hasan Piker, and Kim Horcher as contributors, as well as Fusion reporters and celebrity guest hosts. Piker is the nephew of Uygur and went on to become a well-known Twitch streamer and commentator in his own right.

==Political activity==
TYT promotes itself as the &quot;Home of Progressives&quot;. Uygur has stated that &quot;TYT values journalistic objectivity&quot;. TYT commentary generates &quot;hybridized content&quot;. This involves TYT referencing news from mainstream sources and providing its own content analysis by connecting it to different narratives and discourses related to the social realities of its audience. The network&#x27;s commentary has generated counter narratives in relation to traditional policy discussions. TYT places news in its context and connects it to the decision-making process. By engaging with social movements, the station has called on its audience to become part of its &quot;TYT army&quot;. The network uses its platforms for advocacy, such as calling for its audience to participate in the political process and give candidates support.

As part of new media, TYT coverage conveys the frustration and discontent held by youth with the political system. Progressive social policies and liberal values are promoted through commentary by TYT. Examples include TYT calling for gun control and the need to mitigate violence by police during its coverage of the 2018 Parkland school shooting. In similar coverage of shootings, TYT has provided information on gun and crime related homicide numbers and placed into context the laws, police training and additional factors that worsen the situation. Hosts on TYT advocate for unionization in large companies and the sharing of profits with their workers. The network has spoken out against corruption in politics and for the need to remove corporate donations out of the political system. The station has been critical of what it regards as a &quot;corporate coup&quot; in the US. TYT has criticized politicians from the US Democratic Party for alleged attachment to financial interests and for appearing to be progressive. Hosts on TYT have called for the Democratic Party to undergo a revitalization process. The network has been critical of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal and its supporters like Hillary Clinton, whereas TYT approved of Senator Bernie Sanders&#x27; opposition to it. The station has defended the whistleblower WikiLeaks organization and its data disclosures on several issues such as the TPP, the DNC email leak and the Hillary Clinton email controversy. TYT was skeptical about claims of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.

The station uses traditional and online media platforms regarding political action and mobilization for citizen engagement with institutional politics. For example, TYT townhalls are hosted in local communities involving a moderator asking questions of the expert panel followed by audience questions, with the events streamed on YouTube and on-demand web access for its subscription membership. Viewers also have the option to send video questions to the network if they are unable to be present at the townhall. TYT townhall events involve detailed commentary by hosts and guests on political topics ranging from personal experiences to abstract notions on issues of concern that serve to connect their audience and lived experiences with politics. During the 2016 US presidential election, TYT hosted townhalls with Sanders and Green party candidate Jill Stein. In the late 2010s, other TYT townhalls were held with Sanders on the climate change crisis. Several hosts for TYT have expressed support for Sanders.
The network supports political candidates who are from the same ideological persuasion. Following the 2016 presidential election, Uygur co-founded Justice Democrats, an organization that seeks to get progressive candidates elected into office. During the US mid-term elections (2018), the network endorsed all candidates from the Justice Democrats (JD). TYT was the first network to give airtime to progressive candidates such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to discuss policies and contrast themselves from electoral opponents on its shows like &quot;Rebel HQ&quot;, a half an hour interview based program created in 2017. In 2018, TYT also featured other progressive political candidates on &quot;Rebel HQ&quot; such as Richard Ojeda during his congressional run, gubernatorial candidates Cynthia Nixon who ran in New York State and Christine Hallquist in Vermont to discuss their policies.

As a platform for online and offline civic engagement and political action, &quot;Rebel HQ&quot; offers information about a candidate, their website and campaign. The show informs viewers on how they can contact politicians, assist progressive candidates affiliated or unaffiliated with the Justice Democrats through donations or to participate by volunteering, canvassing and attending events like rallies in local communities. TYT&#x27;s online platforms facilitate the encouragement of civic participation with the political system that in 2018 assisted Justice Democrats in getting 7 congressional victories, 25 candidates during the general election and 78 in the primaries. After Ocasio-Cortez became a congresswoman, TYT has continued to cover and defend her from slants by the political and media elite. Other Justice Democrats congressional members like Ro Khanna and Rashida Tlaib have appeared on TYT discussing progressive policies and issues.

In June 2019, during a high-profile Democratic presidential candidate campaign weekend in Iowa, TYT and a group of supporters launched the Progressive Economic Pledge campaign, challenging presidential candidates to sign. The pledge is to support higher wages, Medicare for All, Green New Deal, college for all and the end of private campaign financing.

In mid-November 2019, Uygur filed to run for Congress in California&#x27;s 25th district, a seat recently vacated by the resignation of Katie Hill, an office also being pursued by former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos. He received 6.6% of the vote and did not advance to the runoff, which was won by Republican Mike Garcia.

On October 11, 2023, Uygur announced his campaign for President in the Democratic Primary. As of December 2023, he has been kept out of the primary due to the fact that he is not a natural-born American citizen.

On December 6, 2023, TYT hosted a forum featuring Democratic Party presidential primary candidates U.S. Representative Dean Phillips, Marianne Williamson, and Cenk Uygur. Biden was invited but declined to attend. The candidates responded to the GOP debate being held in Tuscaloosa, which was scheduled to end at the same time. The discussion was moderated by John Iadarola, the main host of &quot;The Damage Report&quot; on the same network.

On January 12, 2024, NewsNation hosted a second forum featuring Phillips, Williamson, and Uygur. Biden was invited but did not attend. The discussion was moderated by Dan Abrams.

Later he has held teaching positions at the Sibelius Academy and the National Theater Academy. He was Composer-in-Residence at Oulu Sinfonia from 1997 to 2007.

Kortekangas is particularly known for his choral music and operas, of which the latest are &quot;Messenius ja Lucia&quot; (2004), &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Girl&quot; (2007), &quot;One Night Stand&quot; (2011), &quot;Oma vika&quot; (Own Fault, 2015), &quot;Veljeni vartija&quot; (My Brother&#x27;s Keeper, 2018), and &quot;Koria täti&quot; (2021), as well as the church operas &quot;Elämänkuvat&quot; (Pictures of Life, 2019) and &quot;Ende und Beginn&quot; (2021).

<text>Corinthian Football Club was an English amateur football club based in London between 1882 and 1939. Above all, the club is credited with having popularised football around the world, having promoted sportsmanship and fair play, and having championed the ideals of amateurism.

The club was famed for its ethos of &quot;sportsmanship, fair play, [and] playing for the love of the game&quot;. Corinthian Spirit, still understood as the highest standard of sportsmanship, is often associated with the side. This spirit was famously summed up in their attitude to penalties; &quot;As far as they were concerned, a gentleman would never commit a deliberate foul on an opponent. So, if a penalty was awarded against the Corinthians, their goalkeeper would stand aside, lean languidly on the goalpost and watch the ball being kicked into his own net. If the Corinthians themselves won a penalty, their captain took a short run-up and gave the ball a jolly good whack, chipping it over the crossbar.&quot; Among others, Real Madrid were inspired to adopt Corinthian&#x27;s white strip, while Sport Club Corinthians Paulista in Brazil and Zejtun Corinthians in Malta adopted their name.

==History==
The club was founded on 28 September 1882 by Nicholas Lane Jackson, Assistant Secretary of the Football Association. At that time, football was still amateur, with the English game dominated by southern clubs. In international football (which had not yet spread beyond the home nations), Scotland prevailed, having won three consecutive matches over England by scores of 5–1, 6–1 and 5–4.

Jackson attributed Scotland&#x27;s success to &quot;the greater opportunities our opponents over the border [have] of playing together&quot;, and aimed to counteract this by forming a club &quot;composed of the best amateur players in the kingdom&quot;. In order to accomplish this aim, Corinthian took care to avoid playing matches on Saturdays (when players might be playing for other clubs). The first proposed name for the club was the &quot;Wednesday Club&quot;, but this was changed to the &quot;Corinthian Football Club&quot; on the suggestion of Harry Swepstone.

From the outset, Corinthian supplied large numbers of players to the England football team. During the 1880s, the majority of England caps were awarded to Corinthian players and, for two England matches against Wales in 1894 and 1895, the entire team consisted of members of the club (a feat achieved by no other club, before or since).

Given that the club&#x27;s constitution declared that it should &quot;not compete for any challenge cup or any prize of any description&quot; the team originally only played friendly matches. An exception was later made for the Sheriff of London Charity Shield, for which they competed nine times between 1898 and 1907 (winning three), before the match was replaced in the calendar by the FA Charity Shield.

The club would have been strong contenders for the era&#x27;s honours had they entered major competitions — shortly after Blackburn Rovers beat Queen&#x27;s Park in the 1884 FA Cup Final, the Corinthians beat Blackburn 8–1. In 1889, it was written that Corinthians was the only amateur club &quot;which might be pitted against [inaugural Football League champions Preston North End] with any reasonable hope of success&quot;. In the 1904 Sheriff of London Charity Shield against Bury (who had beaten Derby County 6–0 in the 1903 FA Cup final), Corinthian won 10–3.
Corinthian began competing in the FA Cup from the 1922–23 season. They also competed in the 1927 FA Charity Shield against FA Cup winners Cardiff City, losing 2–1 at Stamford Bridge.

==Honorary distinctions==
Among many others:

*Inspired five Brazilian São Paulo railway workers to found one of Brazil&#x27;s largest and most successful professional teams, Sport Club Corinthians Paulista.
*Fielded the first Black player to play Association Football at international level, Andrew Watson 
*Inflicted English side Manchester United&#x27;s heaviest defeat, beating the Red Devils 11–3 in a friendly in Leyton, London in 1904.
*Awarded Sweden their first National Football title, named the Corinthian Bowl.
*Inspired Percy Ashley to name Manchester Corinthians LFC in 1949.

==Notable players==
Notable players who have played for Corinthian include:
* Andrew Watson: the first Black player to play Association football at international level. 
* C. B. Fry: sporting polymath who made 74 appearances for Corinthian, described by contemporaries as &quot;...probably the most variously gifted Englishman of any age&quot;
* R. C. Gosling: described by Sir Frederick Wall, the long-serving Secretary of the Football Association, as &quot;the richest man who ever played football for England&quot;.
* Charles Aubrey Smith: a former Corinthian footballer and British actor, who has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, situated at 6327 Hollywood Blvd. 
* Max Woosnam: the English sportsman referred to as the &#x27;Greatest British sportsman&#x27; in recognition of his achievements.
* Graham Doggart: a leading goal scorer of Corinthian, who went on to appoint England&#x27;s World Cup winning manager, Sir Alf Ramsey.
* Charles Bambridge: held the record for the most years as England&#x27;s top goalscorer; only Michael Owen, Vivian Woodward, Wayne Rooney, Gary Lineker, Jimmy Greaves and Harry Kane have more.
* Tinsley Lindley: A Corinthian centre-forward who famously wore his brogues instead of football boots.
* Charles Wreford-Brown: A constant figure throughout the club&#x27;s golden era, he played 161 games for the club, scoring 8 goals.

==Tours==
The club&#x27;s foreign tours are also credited with having popularised football around the world; they were the first club to take the sport outside Europe; the 2000 and 2012 FIFA Club World Champions, SC Corinthians Paulista, are named after the club (indeed, Charles Miller, considered the father of football in Brazil, played for the club in 1892), and the 2015 FIFA Club World Champions, Real Madrid, wear white to this day in their honor.

Their tours included South Africa, Canada, the United States, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Spain, Denmark, Holland, Austria, Sweden, Switzerland, Brazil, Ireland, Jamaica and Germany.

During &#x27;The Split&#x27;, the 1907–1914 dispute about professional clubs being admitted to membership of the country Football Associations, Corinthian pledged its allegiance to the Amateur Football Alliance, as did Oxford University and Cambridge University. Corinthian therefore, banned from playing top home opposition by The FA, increased the frequency of their foreign tours; &quot;Corinthian F.C. had little option but to concentrate on their [footballing] missionary work overseas and of the 131 matches played before &#x27;The Split&#x27; was resolved in January 1914, 72 were played abroad&quot;.

The club played at various venues including the Queen&#x27;s Club, The Oval, and the old Crystal Palace. On 12 April 1939, the Corinthians played their last match. They merged with Casuals F.C. to form a new club, Corinthian-Casuals F.C.

== Honours ==
Sheriff of London Charity Shield: 3

*Winners: 1898 (shared), 1900, 1904

<doc id="1068156" wikidata="Q6028047" url="?curid=1068156" title="Industrialization of services business model">
<text>The industrialization of services business model is a business model used in strategic management and services marketing that treats service provision as an industrial process, subject to industrial optimization procedures. It originated in the early 1970s, at a time when various quality control techniques were being successfully implemented on production assembly lines.

Theodore Levitt (1972) argued that the reason the service sector suffered from inefficiency and wide variations in quality were that it was based on the craft model. Each service encounter was treated as an isolated event. He felt that service encounters could be systematized through planning, optimal processes, consistency, and capital intensive investments. This model was the foundation of the success of McDonald&#x27;s and many other mass service providers in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.

Unfortunately, the application of assembly line techniques to service provision had several undesirable consequences. Employees found working under these conditions disempowering, resulting in low morale, high staff turnover, and reduced service quality. One of the most difficult aspects of this model for employees to deal with was the &quot;smile incentives&quot;. Employees were instructed to put a smile on their face during the service encounter. This manufacturing and commercialization of apparent happiness has been criticised by many commentators, particularly Mundie (1987). Also many customers prefer the &quot;personal touch&quot;.

By the early 1990s most service providers turned their attention back to the human element and personalized their services. Employees were empowered to customize the service encounter to the individual characteristics of customers.

Subsequently, scholars developed the service-profit-chain concept to understand how employees and customers interact to create value.

<text>Gerald Rafferty (16 April 1947– 4 January 2011) was a Scottish singer, songwriter, musician and record producer. He was a founding member of Stealers Wheel, whose biggest hit was &quot;Stuck in the Middle with You&quot; in 1973. His solo hits in the late 1970s included &quot;Baker Street&quot;, &quot;Right Down the Line&quot; and &quot;Night Owl&quot;.

Rafferty was born into a working-class family in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland. His mother taught him both Irish and Scottish folk songs when he was a boy; later, he was influenced by the music of the Beatles and Bob Dylan. He joined the folk-pop group the Humblebums (of which Billy Connolly was a member) in 1969. After they disbanded in 1971, he recorded his first solo album, &quot;Can I Have My Money Back?&quot; Rafferty and Joe Egan formed the group Stealers Wheel in 1972. Among their other hits was &quot;Star&quot;. In 1978, he recorded his second solo album, &quot;City to City&quot;. A heavy drinker for much of his life, Rafferty died from liver failure in 2011.

==Early years==

Rafferty was born on 16 April 1947 into a working-class family of Irish Catholic origin in Underwood Lane in Paisley, a son and grandson of coal miners. A son of Joseph and Mary (Skeffington) Rafferty, he had two brothers, Jim and Joe (died 1988).

Rafferty grew up in a council house in the town&#x27;s Ferguslie Park, in Underwood Lane, and was educated at St Mirin&#x27;s Academy. His Irish-born father, an alcoholic, was a miner and lorry driver who died when Rafferty was 16. Rafferty learned both Irish and Scottish folk songs as a boy. He recalled, &quot;My father was Irish, so growing up in Paisley I was hearing all these songs when I was two or three. Songs like &#x27;She Moves Through the Fair&#x27;, which my mother sings beautifully. And a whole suite of Irish traditional songs and Scots traditional songs&quot;. Heavily influenced by folk music and the music of the Beatles and Bob Dylan, Rafferty started to write his own material.

==Musical career==
Rafferty left St Mirin&#x27;s Academy in 1963. He then worked in a butcher&#x27;s shop, as a civil service clerk, and in a shoe shop. However, he explained in an interview, &quot;But there was never anything else for me but music. I never intended making a career out of any of the jobs I did.&quot; On weekends, he and a classmate, future Stealers Wheel collaborator Joe Egan, played in a local group named the Maverix, mainly covering chart songs by groups such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. In the mid 1960s Rafferty earned money, for a time, busking on the London Underground. In 1966, Rafferty and Egan were members of the band the Fifth Column. The group released the single &quot;Benjamin Day&quot;/&quot;There&#x27;s Nobody Here&quot; (Columbia 8068), but it was not a commercial success.

===The Humblebums and Stealers Wheel===
In 1969, Rafferty became the third member of a folk-pop group, the Humblebums, along with comedian Billy Connolly and Tam Harvey. Harvey left shortly afterwards, and Rafferty and Connolly continued as a duo, recording two more albums for Transatlantic Records. A 1970 appearance at the Royal Festival Hall, supporting Fotheringay with Nick Drake, earned a positive review from critic Karl Dallas, who noted that all three acts showed &quot;promise rather than fulfilment&quot;, and observed that &quot;Gerry Rafferty&#x27;s songs have the sweet tenderness of Paul McCartney in his &#x27;Yesterday&#x27; mood&quot;. In his own stand-up shows, Connolly has often recalled this period, telling how Rafferty made him laugh and describing the crazy things they did while on tour. Once Rafferty decided to look in the Berlin telephone directory to see if any Hitlers were listed.

After the duo separated in 1971, Transatlantic owner Nathan Joseph signed Rafferty as a solo performer. Rafferty recorded his first solo album, &quot;Can I Have My Money Back?&quot;, with Hugh Murphy, a staff producer working for the label. &quot;Billboard&quot; praised the album as &quot;high-grade folk-rock&quot;, describing it as Rafferty&#x27;s &quot;finest work&quot; to date: &quot;His tunes are rich and memorable with an undeniable charm that will definitely see him into the album and very possibly singles charts soon&quot;. Yet although the album was a critical success, it did not enjoy commercial success. According to Rafferty&#x27;s daughter Martha, it was around this time that her father discovered, by chance, Colin Wilson&#x27;s classic book &quot;The Outsider&quot;, about alienation and creativity, which became a huge influence both on his songwriting and his outlook on the world: &quot;The ideas and references contained in that one book were to sustain and inspire him for the rest of his life.&quot; Rafferty later confirmed that alienation was the &quot;persistent theme&quot; of his songs; &quot;To Each and Everyone&quot;, from &quot;Can I Have My Money Back?&quot;, was an early example.

In 1972, having gained some airplay from his Signpost recording &quot;Make You, Break You&quot;, Rafferty joined Egan to form Stealers Wheel and recorded three albums with the American songwriters and producers Leiber &amp; Stoller. The group was beset by legal wranglings, but had a huge hit with &quot;Stuck in the Middle with You&quot;, which earned critical acclaim as well as commercial success: a 1975 article in &quot;Sounds&quot; described it as &quot;a sort of cross between white label Beatles and punk Dylan yet with a unique Celtic flavour that has marked all their work&quot;. Twenty years later, the song was used prominently in the 1992 movie &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;; Rafferty refused to grant permission for its re-release. Stealers Wheel also produced the lesser top 50 hits &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Agreed That Everything Will Turn Out Fine&quot; followed by &quot;Star&quot;, and there were further suggestions of Rafferty&#x27;s growing alienation in tracks such as &quot;Outside Looking In&quot; and &quot;Who Cares&quot;. The duo disbanded in 1975.

===&quot;City to City&quot; and &quot;Night Owl&quot;===
Legal issues after the break-up of Stealers Wheel meant that, for three years, Rafferty was unable to release any material. After the disputes were resolved in 1978, he recorded his second solo album, &quot;City to City&quot;, with producer Hugh Murphy, which included the song with which he remains most identified, &quot;Baker Street&quot;. According to Murphy, interviewed by &quot;Billboard&quot; in 1993, he and Rafferty had to beg the record label, United Artists, to release &quot;Baker Street&quot; as a single: &quot;They actually said it was too good for the public.&quot; The single reached #3 in the UK and #2 in the US. The album sold over 5.5 million copies, toppling the &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; soundtrack in the US on 8 July 1978. Rafferty considered this his first proper taste of success, as he told &quot;Melody Maker&quot; the following year: &quot;...all the records I&#x27;ve ever done before have been flops. Stealers Wheel was a flop. &#x27;Can I Have My Money Back?&#x27; was a flop. The Humblebums were a flop... My life doesn&#x27;t stand or fall by the amount of people who buy my records.&quot;

&quot;Baker Street&quot; features a saxophone riff played by Raphael Ravenscroft, although the origins of the solo have been disputed. As the singer recalled in a 1988 interview with Colin Irwin: 

In a 2006 interview with &quot;The Times&quot;, Ravenscroft said he was presented with a song that contained &quot;several gaps&quot;: 
In his interview with Colin Irwin, Rafferty disputed this and said that Ravenscroft had been his second choice to play the saxophone solo, after Pete Zorn, who was unavailable: &quot;The only confusion at the time that I didn&#x27;t enjoy too much was the fact that a lot of people believed that the line was written by Raphael Ravenscroft, the sax player, but it was my line. I sang it to him.&quot; When a remastered version of &quot;City to City&quot; was released in 2011, it included the original, electric guitar &#x27;demo&#x27; version of the song as a bonus track, confirming Rafferty&#x27;s authorship of the riff (which appears in the demo note-for-note, as an electric guitar solo). In the liner notes to the album, Rafferty&#x27;s long-time friend and collaborator Rab Noakes commented: Michael Gray, Rafferty&#x27;s former manager, agreed: 

&quot;Baker Street&quot; remains a mainstay of soft-rock radio airplay and, in October 2010, it was recognised by the BMI for surpassing 5 million plays worldwide. &quot;Stuck in the Middle With You&quot; has received over 4 million plays worldwide, and &quot;Right Down The Line&quot; has had over 3 million plays. In a 2003 interview with &quot;The Sun (Scotland)&quot;, Rafferty commented on how profitable his biggest song had been: &quot;Baker Street still makes me about £80,000 a year. It&#x27;s been a huge earner for me. I must admit, I could live off that song alone.&quot; Rafferty loathed the 1992 dance music cover version of &quot;Baker Street&quot; by Undercover, describing it as &quot;dreadful, totally banal–it&#x27;s a sad sign of the times&quot;. But it earned him another £1.5 million, selling around three million copies in Europe and America. He never let &quot;Baker Street&quot; be used for advertising, despite lucrative offers.

&quot;Right Down the Line&quot; was the second single from &quot;City to City&quot;. The song made No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and No. 1 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts in the US. It remained at the top of the adult contemporary chart for four non-consecutive weeks. The third single from the album, &quot;Home and Dry&quot;, reached No. 28 in the US Top 40 in early 1979. 

The lyrics of &quot;Baker Street&quot; reflected Rafferty&#x27;s disenchantment with certain elements of the music industry. This was elaborated on by music journalist Paul Gambaccini for BBC World News:.

Rafferty&#x27;s next album, &quot;Night Owl&quot;, also did well. Guitarist Richard Thompson performed on the track &quot;Take The Money and Run&quot;, and the title track was a UK No. 5 hit in 1979. &quot;Days Gone Down&quot; reached No. 17 in the US. The follow-up single &quot;Get It Right Next Time&quot; made the UK and US Top 40.

===&quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot;, &quot;Sleepwalking&quot; and &quot;North and South&quot;===

Subsequent albums, such as &quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot; (1980), &quot;Sleepwalking&quot; (1982), and &quot;North and South&quot; (1988), fared less well, perhaps due partly to Rafferty&#x27;s longstanding reluctance to perform live, with which he felt uncomfortable.

In 1980, Rafferty and Murphy produced a record for Richard and Linda Thompson; though never released, it eventually evolved into their album &quot;Shoot Out the Lights&quot;.

In his next album, &quot;Sleepwalking&quot; (1982), Rafferty took a very different approach to his work. Christopher Neil replaced Hugh Murphy, Rafferty&#x27;s usual producer, introducing synthesisers and drum machines that give the album a harder, less acoustic sound, and apparently eschewing the richly detailed arrangements notable on Rafferty&#x27;s three previous records. According to Murphy, interviewed a decade later: &quot;Gerry had made three albums on the trot and I think he was pretty jaded at that time and feeling the pressure and he just thought, &#x27;Well, I&#x27;ll try another tack,&#x27; which is understandable&quot;. Instead of a cover painting and hand-lettering by John Patrick Byrne, who had illustrated every previous Rafferty and Stealers Wheel album, &quot;Sleepwalking&quot; featured a simple, stark photograph of an empty road stretching to the sky. There was change too in the songs. The deeply introspective lyrics of &quot;Sleepwalking&quot; suggest Rafferty found success far from glamorous: tracks like &quot;Standing at the Gates&quot;, &quot;Change of Heart&quot;, and &quot;The Right Moment&quot; suggest the singer was exhausted, burnt-out, and desperately seeking a new direction – and continued his long-running theme of alienation. Liner notes for the compilation album &quot;Right Down the Line&quot; (prepared with Rafferty&#x27;s close co-operation) confirmed this several years later, noting the singer was now &quot;finding himself at the crossroads and looking to replace the treadmill with a new dimension in his life&quot;.

Rafferty sang the Mark Knopfler-penned song &quot;The Way It Always Starts&quot; (1983) on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Local Hero&quot;. Also in 1983, Rafferty announced his intention to take a break and devote more time to his family: &quot;It dawned on me that since Baker Street I had been touring the world, travelling everywhere and seeing nowhere. Whatever I do in the future, it&#x27;s at my own pace, on my own terms.&quot;

Based at 16th-century Tye Farm in Hartfield, near the Kent-Sussex border, Rafferty installed electric gates to protect his privacy, built a recording studio, and worked largely by himself or with Murphy. In 1987, Rafferty and Murphy co-produced The Proclaimers first UK hit single &quot;Letter from America&quot;.

According to his former wife Carla, who discouraged visitors: &quot;He was just stalling for time. Maybe some new project would suddenly happen, but I knew he&#x27;d crossed the line as far as the record business went.&quot; His next album, &quot;North and South&quot;, was released in 1988. In an interview that year with Colin Irwin to promote the album, Rafferty mentioned that he was interested in doing more production work and writing film soundtracks, and even floated the idea of writing a musical about the life of Robert Louis Stevenson. Reviews of the album were mixed. In &quot;The Times&quot;, critic David Sinclair was particularly scathing: &quot;On North and South, it sounds as if he has thumbed a lift up the road to a mock-Texan bar somewhere in his native Scotland. There is a mid-Atlantic blandness lurking behind the rococo roots veneer.&quot;

In the early 1990s, Rafferty recorded a cover version of the Bob Dylan song &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin&#x27;&quot; with Barbara Dickson, who had contributed backing vocals to both &quot;City to City&quot; and &quot;Night Owl&quot;. The track appeared on Dickson&#x27;s albums &quot;Don&#x27;t Think Twice It&#x27;s All Right&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Barbara Dickson Collection&quot; (2006).

===&quot;On a Wing and a Prayer&quot; and &quot;Over My Head&quot;===
Rafferty released two further albums in the 1990s in what musician Tom Robinson later described as &quot;a major return to form&quot;. &quot;On a Wing and a Prayer&quot; (1992) reunited him with his Stealers Wheel partner Egan on several tracks. It included three tracks co-written with Rafferty&#x27;s brother Jim, also a singer-songwriter, who had been signed to Decca Records in the 1970s. Rafferty recorded a new version of his Humblebums song &quot;Her Father Didn&#x27;t Like Me Anyway&quot; on the album &quot;Over My Head&quot; (1994). These were the last two records Rafferty produced with Hugh Murphy, who died in 1998. According to guitarist Hugh Burns, Murphy&#x27;s death was &quot;a great blow to Gerry&quot; and marked the end of a creative partnership that had lasted almost 30 years.

===&quot;Another World&quot;===
By the end of the 1990s, new technology enabled Rafferty to distance himself even further from the conventional approach of the music industry and work entirely on his own terms. Now based in London, he employed sound engineer Giles Twigg to assemble a Digidesign mobile recording studio and, with Twigg&#x27;s help, recorded the album &quot;Another World&quot; in London, Scotland, Barbados, France, and Italy with collaborators from previous albums, including Hugh Burns, Mark Knopfler, Kenny Craddock, and Mo Foster. Through his company Icon Music, Rafferty promoted and sold the album independently on a website created specifically for the purpose.

&quot;Another World&quot;, released in 2000, was originally available only via direct order from his website, but since 2003 has been available on the Hypertension label. &quot;Another World&quot;, almost an esoteric work, also with the assistance of Mark Knopfler and Egan, featured an album cover illustrated by John Byrne, who also illustrated the covers for &quot;Can I Have My Money Back?&quot;, &quot;City to City&quot;, &quot;Night Owl&quot;, and &quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot;, and all three Stealers Wheel albums. Byrne was also responsible for one of Rafferty&#x27;s most prized possessions: a hand-painted Martin acoustic guitar bearing his portrait and the name &quot;Gerry Rafferty&quot;, which features in many photographs of the singer.

&quot;Another World&quot; marked a new departure for the singer. As he explained in a press release heralding the new record in November 2000: &quot;My heart and soul have gone into this album, and by releasing it in this way my creative influence has not been diluted in any way.&quot; Finally, thanks to the Internet, it seemed Rafferty no longer needed the music industry: technology was allowing him to put his music directly in the hands of an appreciative audience. Rafferty felt he had matured as an artist, as he told the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; at the time of the release: &quot;At my time of life, I don&#x27;t want to be talking to 23-year-old record executives who are just trying to sell their products to 19-year-olds. I&#x27;m older and my audience is older. They&#x27;ll know where to find me.&quot; In the same interview, he said that the entire record had been made for approximately £200,000, with half spent on travel, the recording system costing £75,000, and the website and marketing adding £25,000.

Rafferty maintained his enthusiasm for this new approach to recording for the next three years. In a blog posting dated 31 March 2004 he wrote: &quot;Let&#x27;s get back to music: after all that&#x27;s the only reason that this website has been set up.&quot; Another posting announced that Rafferty would begin to release music regularly as free downloads: &quot;In reality, Gerry could put a new track out every two weeks or so. We will keep you informed of developments as they happen.&quot; Only a handful of tracks were ever released, however, and the website eventually closed down without any explanation.

===&quot;Life Goes On&quot;===
During November 2009, Rafferty released what would be his final album, &quot;Life Goes On&quot;. This was again on the Hypertension music label. Featuring 18 tracks, the album contains six new recordings, covers of Christmas carols, plus also some traditional songs that had previously been available on the Gerry Rafferty website. The remaining tracks are remastered tracks from his previous three albums.

===Posthumous releases===
Rafferty&#x27;s death in January 2011 rekindled interest in the singer&#x27;s work. His daughter Martha relaunched Rafferty&#x27;s old website, gerryrafferty.com, with a full discography, rare photos, and new artwork by John Byrne. She portrayed her father as an autodidact with an &quot;incredibly strong work ethic&quot; and passion for books (&quot;There were literally whole walls of book shelves at home and he&#x27;d read every single word. Mainly philosophy, art, religion, psychology and many a biography.&quot;).

In September 2011, EMI issued a remastered collector&#x27;s edition of &quot;City to City&quot; featuring previously unheard demo versions of &quot;Baker Street&quot;, &quot;Mattie&#x27;s Rag&quot;, &quot;City to City&quot;, and other tracks from the album.

Other artists continue to be inspired by Rafferty&#x27;s work. In 2012, Cuillin Recordings issued &quot;Paisley Spin&quot;, a remix of three tracks from &quot;Can I Have My Money Back?&quot; by Celtic fusion artist Martyn Bennett. Bonnie Raitt recorded a reggae treatment of &quot;Right Down the Line&quot; for her &quot;Slipstream&quot; album released 10 April 2012. Barbara Dickson released a tribute album of 13 Rafferty songs, &quot;To Each and Everyone: The Songs of Gerry Rafferty&quot;, in September 2013, including cover versions of &quot;Baker Street&quot;, &quot;The Ark&quot;, and &quot;Steamboat Row&quot;.

On 3 September 2021 Parlophone UK released &quot;Rest in Blue&quot;, an album on which Martha Rafferty completed a project started by her father from demos left by Rafferty. The collection of blues, rock, and folk demos had been planned for a new album before his death.

==Attitude to the music industry==
Rafferty drew a clear distinction between the artistic integrity of a musician, on the one hand, and the music industry&#x27;s need to create celebrities and sell products, on the other. In an interview with Colin Irwin in 1988, he said: &quot;There&#x27;s a thin line between being a songwriter and a singer and being a personality... If you feel uncomfortable with it you shouldn&#x27;t do it. It&#x27;s not for me – there are too many inherent contradictions.&quot; Two decades later, speaking to the press after Rafferty&#x27;s funeral, Charlie Reid of The Proclaimers confirmed Rafferty&#x27;s dislike of celebrity: &quot;He was not entirely comfortable with fame. Even more so than most people who work in this business, he saw it as not a good thing.&quot; Reid believed Rafferty was fundamentally unsuited to the pressures of celebrity: &quot;He struck me as a very, very sensitive man and for someone like that, fame was probably not appropriate.&quot; Billy Connolly agrees that Rafferty had different priorities: &quot;I wanted success and fame and I got it, to a degree. Gerry wanted respect. He wanted his talent to be respected. He wanted his songs to be respected. And he certainly got that.&quot;

Generally an autobiographical writer, Rafferty returned to this theme often, in the lyrics of Stealers Wheel songs such as &quot;Stuck in the Middle With You&quot; and &quot;Good Businessman&quot;, and later solo tracks like &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot; (from &quot;Night Owl&quot;), &quot;Welcome to Hollywood&quot; (from &quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot;), and &quot;Sleepwalking&quot; (from the album of the same name). The liner notes to the compilation album &quot;Right Down the Line&quot;, written by Jerry Gilbert with Rafferty&#x27;s close co-operation, note his consistent refusal to tour the United States and &quot;generally &#x27;play the industry game&#x27;.&quot; It was ironic that Rafferty—a lover and collector of religious icons, who would later name one of his publishing companies &quot;Icon Music&quot;—was also an iconoclast. According to Michael Gray, Rafferty&#x27;s personal manager at the height of his success, he turned down many opportunities to work with other artists: &quot;... he retained a healthy scepticism not just about the music industry but about society, money and politics in general. His background was soaked in Scottish socialism and poverty, his mind sharp and his personality acerbic, and he wasn&#x27;t going to be dazzled by the glamour of success.&quot;

Rafferty never changed his mind about the music business; if anything, his views hardened. In 2000, he told the &quot;Paisley Daily Express&quot; that the second Stealers Wheel album, released in 1974, had been named &quot;Ferguslie Park&quot;, after a deprived area of Paisley, &quot;to get as far away as possible from all the bullshit of the music industry in London.&quot; Monsignor John Tormey, celebrating Rafferty&#x27;s funeral mass, suggested the singer&#x27;s attitude to fame was an indication of his spiritual integrity: &quot;He always searched for a more authentic way to live his life, shunning the outward trappings of celebrity so that he might live as he chose to live his life.&quot;

==Personal life==

In 1965, 18-year-old Rafferty met 15-year-old Carla Ventilla, an apprentice hairdresser from an Italian family in Clydebank, at a dancehall—a story he later recounted in the song &quot;Shipyard Town&quot; on &quot;North and South&quot;. They married in 1970 and lived in Scotland with their daughter, Martha Mary, before moving to the south of England in the late 1970s, where they divided their time between their farm near the Kent–Sussex border and a home in Hampstead, London. Rafferty&#x27;s lengthy commutes from London to Scotland inspired some songs on the album &quot;City to City&quot; (including the title track and &quot;Mattie&#x27;s Rag&quot;, which recounted his delight at being reunited with his daughter), while the later move south inspired &quot;The Garden of England&quot; (from the album &quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot;) and some songs on &quot;North and South&quot;. Rafferty and Ventilla divorced in 1990.

After the completion of &quot;Another World&quot; in 2000, Rafferty planned to move back to Scotland and bought Eaglestone House, &quot;a substantial listed 1860s mansion&quot; in the Highland village of Strathpeffer, although he sold the property two years later and never actually moved in.

===Alcoholism===
Rafferty enjoyed alcohol from a young age, and early songs, such as &quot;One Drink Down&quot;, &quot;Baker Street&quot;, and &quot;Night Owl&quot;, freely mention the subject. According to Michael Gray, the singer&#x27;s personal manager in the early 1980s: &quot;It never occurred to me in all the time I knew him that he was heading for alcoholism. Maybe I should have realised, but I didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m unsure whether he did.&quot; As the 1980s progressed, Rafferty&#x27;s growing drinking problem placed his marriage under impossible strain; his wife divorced him in 1990, although they remained close. In the late 1980s, Rafferty had told journalist Colin Irwin: &quot;I was always very conscious about keeping a low profile because that&#x27;s the way I like to go about it. And I don&#x27;t plan to be in the public eye too much now either.&quot;

In 1995, Rafferty was deeply affected by the death of his older brother Joseph, an event from which family and friends said he never fully recovered.

In the last decade of his life, having taken pains to shun the fame and celebrity that accompanied his musical achievements, Rafferty found himself making headlines once again as he struggled with alcoholism and depression and the increasingly erratic behaviour they spawned. While the news stories focused on Rafferty&#x27;s binges, they revealed nothing of the impact on his family and friends. His girlfriend Enzina Fuschini said she: &quot;felt that he was under some sort of evil spell. He felt crippled by it... I saw a man in despair&quot;. According to Rafferty&#x27;s ex-wife Carla: &quot;There was no hope. I would never have left him if there&#x27;d been a glimmer of a chance of him recovering.&quot;

===Disappearance===
In 2008, Rafferty moved away from California and briefly rented a home in Ireland, where his drinking soon became a problem again. In July that year, he flew to London, where he stayed in the five-star Westbury Hotel in Mayfair and began a four-day drinking binge during which he extensively damaged his room. Speaking to &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper later, the hotel&#x27;s director commented: &quot;It was such a shame. In person, Mr Rafferty was a really nice man, he kept himself to himself and didn&#x27;t bother the other guests but he was clearly on a downward spiral. He was in self-destruct mode.&quot;

There were conflicting reports about what happened next. The newspaper &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot; reported that Rafferty had been asked to leave the hotel and had then checked himself into St Thomas&#x27; Hospital suffering from a chronic liver condition, brought on by heavy drinking. The same report claimed that on 1 August 2008, Rafferty had disappeared, leaving his belongings behind, and that the hospital had filed a missing persons report. No such missing persons report existed.

On 17 February 2009, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Rafferty was in hiding in the south of England, being cared for by a friend. Subsequently, Rafferty&#x27;s spokesperson Paul Charles told &quot;The Independent&quot; that he had been in touch with Rafferty a fortnight previously and that he was alive and well but had no plans to either record or tour. This was contradicted by a report in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; on the following day, which quoted a statement his solicitors made to Channel 4 News: &quot;Contrary to reports, Gerry is extremely well and has been living in Tuscany for the last six months... he continues to compose and record new songs and music... and he hopes to release a new album of his most recent work in the summer of this year [2009].&quot; The album, titled &quot;Life Goes On&quot;, was released in November 2009.

After leaving St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, and while claiming he was in Tuscany, he was moving from one London hotel to another. During this time, he met Enzina Fuschini, an Italian artist living in Dorset. Rafferty and Fuschini rented a large home together in Upton, near Poole. Fuschini said she cared for the singer during 2009 and tried to help him overcome his alcoholism, and that he proposed to her at the Ritz Hotel in Paris on Christmas Eve that year.

==Death==
In November 2010, Rafferty was admitted to the Royal Bournemouth Hospital where he was put on a life-support machine and treated for multiple organ failure. After being taken off life support, Rafferty recovered for a short time, and doctors thought that he might recover. Rafferty died of liver failure at the home of his daughter Martha in Stroud, Gloucestershire, on 4 January 2011. He was 63.

A requiem mass was held for Rafferty at St Mirin&#x27;s Cathedral in his native town of Paisley on 21 January 2011. The mass was streamed live over the Internet. Politicians in attendance were the First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond MSP, Wendy Alexander MSP, Hugh Henry MSP, and Robin Harper MSP. The musicians present included Craig and Charlie Reid of The Proclaimers, former bandmates Joe Egan and Rab Noakes, Barbara Dickson, and Graham Lyle. The eulogy was given by Rafferty&#x27;s longtime friend John Byrne. His remains were then cremated at the Woodside Crematorium in Paisley and his ashes scattered on Iona. He is survived by his daughter Martha, granddaughter Celia, and brother Jim.

===Will and legal dispute over estate===
In October 2011, newspapers reported that Rafferty&#x27;s immediate family were the beneficiaries of his £1.25 million estate. Rafferty had apparently not changed his will after meeting Enzina Fuschini in 2008 and left her nothing. Fuschini contested the will, but it was later reported that she had lost her case and £75,000 legal costs were awarded against her.

==Tributes and legacy==
Newspapers printed lengthy obituaries for the singer; in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Michael Gray charted Rafferty&#x27;s long downward spiral into alcoholism, while a full-page obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; summarised his career more positively: &quot;As well as being a singer of considerable talent who at one time had the pop world at his feet, Gerry Rafferty was also a consummate songwriter, blessed with sensitivity and an enviable melodic flair that at its best recalled Paul McCartney.&quot;

Other entertainers also paid tribute to Rafferty, with comedian and ex-bandmate Billy Connolly calling him &quot;a hugely talented songwriter and singer who will be greatly missed&quot; and musician Tom Robinson saying, &quot;His early work with Stealers Wheel was an inspiration to a whole generation of songwriters in the 70s, including me.&quot; Speaking after the funeral, Charlie Reid of The Proclaimers said: &quot;I think Gerry Rafferty was one of the few people who really successfully straddled the worlds of both folk and popular music. He did it really well and he was respected in both camps.&quot; Barbara Dickson also paid tribute to her friend, whom she described as a &quot;luminous, glorious Scottish musician&quot;. Finbar Furey, who knew Rafferty for over 40 years, said he &quot;was in a different league completely. He didn&#x27;t know how good he was. He was one of the most talented musicians and singers I ever knew but he completely underestimated his own talent. He was a very humble man.&quot;

Shortly after news of the singer&#x27;s death, Lily Allen tweeted the message &quot;Rest in Peace Gerry x&quot; with a video link to the song &quot;Right Down the Line&quot;, reputedly one of her favourite music tracks. Electropop star Elly Jackson described &quot;Right Down the Line&quot; as &quot;my favourite track of all time. It makes me think of home, nostalgia and happiness.&quot;

In November 2012, Rafferty&#x27;s hometown of Paisley paid tribute to the singer by naming a street in the Shortroods area &quot;Gerry Rafferty Drive&quot;. Gordon Laurie, director of the housing association behind the project, commented: &quot;It is a fitting tribute to a brilliant musician who lives on through his music.&quot;

In January 2013, BBC Radio 2 re-broadcast their 2012 programme &quot;Bring It All Home – Gerry Rafferty Remembered&quot;, which had been recorded live at Celtic Connections in Glasgow and was presented by Ricky Ross. Contributing artists included his friend Rab Noakes, The Proclaimers, Barbara Dickson, Ron Sexsmith, Jack Bruce, Paul Brady, Emma Pollock, James Vincent McMorrow and Betsy Cook. Rafferty&#x27;s guitarist Hugh Burns, multi-instrumentalist Graham Preskett and saxophonist Mel Collins, were also featured.

<doc id="1068163" wikidata="Q451853" url="?curid=1068163" title="Battle of St. Jakob an der Birs">
<text>The Battle of St. Jakob an der Birs was fought between the Old Swiss Confederacy and French (mostly Armagnac) mercenaries, on the banks of the river Birs. The battle took place on 26 August 1444 and was part of the Old Zürich War. The site of the battle was near Münchenstein, Switzerland, just over 1 km outside the city walls of Basel, today within Basel&#x27;s St-Alban district.

==Background==
In 1443, the seven cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy invaded the canton of Zürich and besieged the city. Zürich had allied with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III, who now appealed to King Charles VII of France to send an army to relieve the siege.

Charles, seeking to send away the &quot;écorcheurs&quot;, troublesome troops made idle by the truce with King Henry VI of England in the Hundred Years&#x27; War, sent his son the Dauphin (later King Louis XI of France) with an army of about 30,000 of these écorcheurs into Switzerland, most of them Armagnacs, to relieve Zürich. As the French forces entered Swiss territory at Basel, the Swiss commanders stationed at Farnsburg decided to send an advance troop of 1,300, primarily young pikemen. These moved to Liestal on the night of 25 August, where they were joined by a local force of 200.

==Battle==
In the early morning, they managed to surprise and rout French vanguard troops at Pratteln and Muttenz. Enthused by this success, and despite strict orders to the contrary, the Swiss troops crossed the Birs to meet the bulk of the French army of some 30,000 men, which was ready for battle. Immediately, the Swiss forces formed three pike squares of five hundred men each, and they fought well when Armagnac cavalry charged again and again and were repulsed.

Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini (1405–1464, later Pope Pius II, until 1439 participant in the Council of Florence), described the battle in vivid detail, telling how the Swiss ripped bloody crossbow bolts from their bodies and charged the enemy even after they had been pierced by pikes or had lost their hands, charging the Armagnacs to avenge their own deaths.

The fighting lasted for several hours and was of an intensity evoking awed commentary from witnesses. Eventually, the Swiss pike squares weakened, so the commander ordered his men to retreat into a small hospital of St. Jakob. A small reinforcement from Basel was repulsed, and its leader, Henman Sevogel, was killed.

The Armagnac troops set their artillery to bombard the hospital, inflicting heavy casualties on the Swiss. Nevertheless, as the offensive party, the Swiss categorically refused to surrender. As the Armagnacs moved into the hospital, the remaining Swiss were pressed into the hospital&#x27;s garden and killed to the last man within half an hour.

==Aftermath==
Even though the battle itself was a devastating defeat for the Swiss, and a significant blow to Bern, the canton which contributed the force, it was nevertheless a Swiss success in strategic terms. Because of the heavy casualties on the French side, the original plan of moving towards Zürich, where a Swiss force of 30,000 was ready, was now judged unfavorably by the Dauphin. The French troops turned back, contributing to the eventual Swiss victory in the Old Zürich War. The actions of the Swiss were praised as heroic by contemporary observers, and reports of the event quickly spread throughout Europe.

The Dauphin formally made peace with the Swiss Confederacy and Basel in a treaty signed at Ensisheim on 28 October, and withdrew his troops from the Alsace in the spring of 1445. The intervention of the Church Council being held in the city of Basel at that time was crucial in instigating this peace: the Swiss Confederates were allies of the city of Basel, and so the Dauphin&#x27;s war could also be construed as an aggressive act against the Council housed within its walls. Charles VII of France had implemented the reformist decrees of the Council of Basel in 1438, so it was important for the Dauphin not to appear to be threatening its members.

In terms of military tactics, the battle exposed the weakness of pike formations against artillery, marking the beginning of the era of gunpowder warfare.

==Legacy in Swiss historiography and patriotism==
While the sheer bravery or foolhardiness on the Swiss side was recognized by contemporaries, it was only in the 19th century, after the collapse of the Napoleonic Helvetic Republic, that the battle came to be stylized as a kind of Swiss Thermopylae, a heroic and selfless rescue of the fatherland from a French invasion.

The battle became a symbol of Swiss military bravery in the face of overwhelming odds. It was celebrated in 19th-century Swiss patriotism, finding explicit mention in &quot;Rufst du, mein Vaterland&quot;, the Swiss national anthem from the 1850s to 1961. The first monument at the battle site was erected in 1824, the current monument by Ferdinand Schlöth dates to 1872. Memorial ceremonies at the site were held from 1824, from 1860 to 1894 yearly, and afterward every five years (discontinued after 1994).

The death of knight Burkhard VII. Münch, according to the chroniclers at the hands of a dying Swiss fighter, became symbolic of the outcome of the battle and the strategy of deterring powers of superior military strength from invading Switzerland by the threat of inflicting disproportionate casualties even in defeat, pursued by Swiss high command during the World Wars.

<doc id="1068165" wikidata="Q1343350" url="?curid=1068165" title="Rocky Anderson">
<text>Ross Carl &quot;Rocky&quot; Anderson II (born September 9, 1951) is an American attorney, writer, activist, and civil and human rights advocate. He served two terms as the 33rd Mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah, from 2000 to 2008. 

Prior to serving as mayor, Anderson practiced law for 21 years in Salt Lake City, during which he was the 1996 Democratic nominee for Congress in Utah&#x27;s Second Congressional District. Following his terms as mayor, Anderson founded and served as the Executive Director of High Road for Human Rights and returned to his legal practice, frequently bringing legal challenges to government programs. Anderson also served as the 2012 presidential nominee for his newly created Justice Party, receiving 43,000 votes out of more than 129 million votes cast. Anderson ran again for mayor of Salt Lake City in the 2023 mayoral election, but he lost to incumbent Erin Mendenhall 58% to 34%.

==Early life and education==
Ross C. &quot;Rocky&quot; Anderson was born in Logan, Utah, one of three children of Roy and Grace Anderson. His parents both worked at Anderson Lumber Company, a local lumber yard founded by Rocky&#x27;s great-grandfather, a Norwegian immigrant carpenter who had converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

Though Anderson does not currently consider himself to be a Mormon, he was raised as one and was a practicing member of the LDS Church in Logan. He has described his disagreement with certain doctrines of the LDS Church, particularly the denial of the priesthood to men of black African descent and the denial to Black men and women of the right to engage in religious ceremonies prior to 1978. Anderson has likewise expressed his disagreement with the LDS Church&#x27;s teachings and policies relating to members of the LGBTQ+ community. Anderson also expresses disagreement with what he describes as the LDS teaching of personal moral abdication through obedience to people in positions of authority, arguing that it violates the principle of personal conscience and individual moral development and accountability.

Amidst a wide variety of courses, Anderson studied ethics, political philosophy, and religious philosophy at the University of Utah.

During high school (He attended Ogden High School, built as a WPA project during the Great Depression), Anderson played lead guitar in a rock and roll band, the Viscounts, and worked at a cabinet and roof truss plant. He also shingled roofs during his high school and college years. After graduating from Ogden High School, Anderson attended the University of Utah, during which time he served as Treasurer for the Beta Epsilon chapter of Sigma Chi fraternity and worked at various jobs, including as a truck driver, a roofer, and a gas station manager. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy, graduating magna cum laude. After reading existentialist literature and several works on ethics, religious philosophy, and political philosophy, he had a &quot;powerful epiphany. We can&#x27;t escape responsibility, there&#x27;s no sitting out moral decisions, and whenever we refuse to stand up against wrongdoing we&#x27;re actually supporting the status quo.&quot;

After graduating from the University of Utah, Anderson worked at several jobs. He built buck fence at a ranch in Wyoming, tended bar in Salt Lake City, drove a cab, waited tables at a restaurant, worked at a methadone clinic, typed freight bills, and worked in construction.

He started graduate school in philosophy at the University of Utah, then traveled to Europe and lived and worked for a few months in Freiburg, Germany before returning to the United States to attend law school. In 1978, Anderson graduated, with honors, from George Washington University Law School, earning his Juris Doctor.

==Career==
=== Law Practice ===
Upon graduation from law school, Anderson returned to Salt Lake City to practice law. He participated in several jury trials in federal and state courts and handled appeals before the Utah Court of Appeals, the Utah Supreme Court, the United States District Court for the District of Utah (in an appeal from Bankruptcy Court) and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Anderson had an extremely diverse legal practice and represented plaintiffs in dozens of major cases, involving a wide variety of issues, including securities fraud, violation of church and state separation, civil rights, professional malpractice, abuse of incarcerated people, child sex abuse, and First and Fourth Amendment violations.

Before he was elected Mayor of Salt Lake City, Anderson practiced law for twenty-one years in Salt Lake City, beginning as an associate with Berman &amp; Giauque and later as a partner in Berman &amp; Anderson; Hansen &amp; Anderson; Anderson &amp; Watkins; and Anderson &amp; Karrenberg. After he returned to the practice of law in 2014, he was of counsel with Winder &amp; Counsel, then was a partner at Lewis Hansen, and then practiced at Law Offices of Rocky Anderson until 2021, when he wound down his law practice and volunteered full-time as Executive Director of the Justice Party (later named Allied Justice). He specialized in civil litigation in several areas of law, including antitrust, securities fraud, commercial, product liability, professional malpractice and civil rights. He often represented individuals suing corporations or government entities, including plaintiffs in the following cases:
* &quot;Bradford v. Moench&quot;: A consumer rights lawsuit in which Anderson successfully asserted a novel securities law theory and achieved, in a precedent-setting decision, broad protections for depositors in inadequately insured &quot;thrift and loan&quot; companies.
* &quot;Scott v. Hammock&quot;: A lawsuit in which Anderson represented a young woman who had been sexually abused by her adoptive father. During the case, Anderson challenged the right of confidentiality that the L.D.S Church asserted regarding non-penitential communications by the defendant with his Mormon bishop.
* &quot;University of Utah Students Against Apartheid v. Peterson&quot;: A case in which plaintiffs successfully asserted their First Amendment rights to symbolic speech after the university administration ordered them to remove shanties used to protest the university&#x27;s investments in South Africa. (Anderson filed an amicus brief for the ACLU in the case.)
* &quot;Armstrong v. McCotter&quot;: A civil rights case involving a young mentally ill man, Michael Valent, who, while incarcerated in prison, died from a pulmonary embolism after being strapped naked in a restraint chair for 16 hours solely because of conduct linked to his schizophrenia.
* &quot;Bott v. Deland&quot;: A civil rights case based upon deliberate indifference toward and unnecessarily rigorous treatment of an incarcerated person with a severe medical problem. The case established, for the first time, protections for the rights of incarcerated people under the Utah Constitution far broader than under the United States Constitution. In that case, the Utah Supreme Court agreed that financial damages, not limited by state statute, are available for violations of the protections provided for incarcerated people under the State Constitution.
* &quot;Regan v. Salt Lake County&quot;: A class action challenging invasive searches, including strip searches, of women held on minor violations at the Salt Lake County Jail.
* &quot;Prettyman v. Salt Lake City&quot;: A civil rights case involving the excessive use of force by police, resulting in the breaking of a rod in the plaintiff&#x27;s back.
* &quot;Harding v. Walles&quot;: A civil rights case involving the sexual abuse of a male prison inmate by a prison guard.
* Mitchell v. Roberts: A child sex abuse case, seeking to protect the right, created by the Utah Legislature, to sue a perpetrator even if the prior statute of limitations had already run.
* Cinema Pub v. Petilos: Successfully vindicated the First Amendment rights of a local theater that serves alcohol after the Utah D.A.B.C. sought to sanction the business for showing the movie Deadpool.
* Kendall v. Olsen: Sought justice regarding the warrantless invasion of a private backyard by a police officer who unjustifiably shot and killed the resident&#x27;s beloved dog.

Anderson helped to spearhead the reform of Utah&#x27;s child custody laws. He worked to institute a program to help those who do not qualify for assistance through Legal Aid or Legal Services, but who are unable to afford to pay in full for legal representation. Anderson served as Chair of the Litigation Section of the Utah State Bar Association (when the Litigation Section was recognized by the Utah Bar Association as the Section of the Year), and as president of Anderson and Karrenberg, a Salt Lake City law firm.

=== Volunteer work with non-profit organizations and activism. ===
When he was practicing law, Anderson was affiliated with several non-profit organizations dedicated to protecting civil rights, providing educational opportunities for economically disadvantaged children, protecting reproductive freedom, improving the penal and criminal justice systems, and strengthening legislative ethics. He served as president of the boards of the ACLU of Utah, Guadalupe Schools, and Citizens for Penal Reform, which he founded. He served as a board member of several other community-based non-profit organizations, including Planned Parenthood Association of Utah (for whom he also performed pro bono legal services, including a successful lawsuit to obtain an occupancy certificate for a new clinic, which had been denied because of community opposition to a family planning clinic) and Utah Common Cause. On behalf of Common Cause, Anderson lobbied for stronger legislation pertaining to ethical conduct by elected officials, as well as for campaign finance reform.

While he was practicing law, Anderson opposed the Reagan Administration&#x27;s efforts to overthrow the government in Nicaragua and some of the Administration&#x27;s other policies relating to Latin America. He spoke publicly and debated regarding the U.S.&#x27;s illegal intervention in Nicaragua and organized two trips to Nicaragua for dozens of Utahns so they could see, and report back to the public, what was actually happening in the country. He also twice debated the commander-in-chief of the Contras, Adolfo Calero.

Moved by the suffering of the friends and family members of several women who had been murdered in the Salt Lake City area, but whose killings Salt Lake City police detectives had failed to solve, Anderson worked &quot;pro bono&quot; for many months, reviewing documents and locating and interviewing witnesses. His work, together with the efforts of others, led to the eventual grand jury indictment and conviction of a man for one of the murders.

Rocky served as Chair of the Board of Salt Lake Academy of Music (SLAM) and now serves on the Board of the Haitian Orchestra Institute (HOI).

===1996 congressional campaign===
After winning a contentious primary election against Kelly Atkinson by a margin of 11%, Anderson ran for Congress as the Democratic nominee in Utah&#x27;s 2nd congressional district in 1996 against Republican Merrill Cook. Without any financial help from the Democratic Party (some local Democratic leaders viewed Anderson as being too liberal because of his work with the ACLU, his advocacy for reproductive rights, his support for same-sex marriage, his opposition to U.S. policy toward Nicaragua in the 1980s, and his opposition to the death penalty), he garnered over 100,000 votes in the district. Anderson lost the 1996 race to Merrill Cook, achieving 37 percent of the ballots cast versus Cook&#x27;s 60 percent.

===Mayor of Salt Lake City===
Anderson ran for Mayor of Salt Lake City in 1999, defeating 10 other candidates in the primary campaign, before winning 60% of the vote in the general election against opponent Stuart Reid. He won re-election by an 8% margin against Frank R. Pignanelli in 2003.

Anderson&#x27;s two terms in office were extremely eventful, with Anderson playing a leading role in hosting the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. He organized and co-hosted dozens of mayors for three consecutive years at the Sundance Summit. He also founded the Salt Lake City International Jazz Festival, as well as providing national and international leadership regarding climate protection. He conducted a successful national campaign to require that airports across the country screen all checked luggage, expanded the area&#x27;s light rail system, significantly expanded protected open space, implemented an innovative and highly successful restorative justice program and created a city wide after-school and summer youth program, YouthCity.

Many of Anderson&#x27;s achievements were described in his State of the City addresses and listed by the news media shortly before he left office.

State Senator Chris Buttars of West Jordan publicly denounced former Mayor Rocky Anderson for having &quot;attracted the entire gay community to come and live in Salt Lake County&quot; after a Dan Jones poll indicated strong support for allowing domestic partnerships. In the 2004 election, 63% of the city population voted against banning same-sex marriage, in agreement with Mayor Anderson.

Anderson chose not to run for a third term so he could push for reforms of U.S. human rights policies and practices through grassroots organizing.

====Environmental and climate protection programs====

Considered perhaps the &quot;greenest&quot; mayor in the United States, Anderson gained international renown for his Salt Lake City Green Program – a comprehensive effort to improve sustainability and reduce the City&#x27;s environmental footprint – which achieved a 31% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from municipal operations in just 3 years. Elements of the program, which Anderson described as covering &quot;everything from dog waste to nuclear wastes&quot;, included initiatives to improve the efficiency of the City&#x27;s fleet and use of electricity, measures to make Salt Lake City more bicycle-and pedestrian-friendly, and co-generation plants at the City&#x27;s landfill and wastewater treatment facilities that recapture methane to generate electricity.

As part of the Salt Lake City Green program, Anderson committed Salt Lake City to the Kyoto Protocol goals in 2002. He mandated that all city buildings use energy-efficient light bulbs and replaced SUVs in the city fleet with high-efficiency, alternative-fuel vehicles. Anderson almost doubled the city&#x27;s recycling capacity in one year. The City surpassed its Kyoto goals in 2006, seven years ahead of schedule.

In 2003, Anderson received the Climate Protection Award from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and the Sierra Club acknowledged his environmental work with its Distinguished Service Award. In November 2005, the Salt Lake City Green program led to Salt Lake City receiving the World Leadership Award for environmental programs, presented by the World Leadership Forum in London.

Anderson exemplified &quot;green living&quot; through personal example, including xeriscaping his entire yard, installing solar panels at his home, recycling all recyclable materials, and using cold-water detergent, fluorescent bulbs, thermostat timers and a natural gas-powered car.

While serving as mayor, Anderson informed and inspired other municipal officials about the importance of educating constituents about climate change and of taking measures to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Anderson later researched, produced, and narrated a multi-media piece (still available on YouTube) regarding the need for tenacious, effective leadership to protect against further disastrous climate chaos.

For three consecutive years, he organized and co-hosted, with Robert Redford and ICLEI, &quot;The Sundance Summit: A Mayors Gathering on Climate Protection&quot;, attended by dozens of mayors from throughout the United States. At the Sundance Summit, mayors learned the science of climate change, how to communicate regarding the causes, consequences, and solutions to climate change, and best practices in cities implementing ground-breaking climate protection practices.

Anderson also spoke on the subject of the climate crisis at side meetings at United Nations Conference of the Parties (COP) meetings in New Delhi, Buenos Aires, and Bali, and at conferences in Sweden, Australia, and across the United States. Anderson also spoke in Beijing to a gathering of Chinese mayors and vice-mayors about how they can help their communities reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Anderson was also the only representative from the United States to consult in London with representatives from G8 nations on climate change, in preparation for the 2005 G8 Summit. He also spoke on climate protection issues at the 2006 annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative and the 2007 annual meeting of the national Environmental Law Societies.

During Anderson&#x27;s tenure as mayor, he created the &quot;e2 Business&quot; program, recruiting local businesses to implement major sustainability practices, and led a national campaign against the environmentally and economically destructive use of plastic water bottles, which he has called &quot;the greatest marketing scam of all time&quot;. While serving as Executive Director of High Road for Human Rights, Anderson co-authored a major article on the human rights implications of the climate crisis and why climate chaos should be treated as human rights violation.

====Tobacco====
Anderson is an ardent opponent of the tobacco industry, and has supported legislative measures to discourage smoking and tax tobacco products.

====Ethnic minority issues and communities====
In December 2001, state and federal officials organized a raid at the Salt Lake City Airport to enforce immigration laws against undocumented employees, who were arrested, imprisoned, and fired. In response, Anderson created the Family to Family program, which made it possible for Salt Lake City families to provide direct emotional and financial assistance to the airport workers and their families, while gaining a better understanding of the plight of immigrants. Additionally, the Mayor spearheaded a successful challenge to English-only legislation in Utah in 2000, and later spoke at large demonstrations for comprehensive immigration reform.

Anderson received the League of United Latin American Citizens&#x27;s first-ever &quot;Profile in Courage&quot; award, as well as the National Association of Hispanic Publications&#x27; Presidential Award.

Anderson signed an executive order in 2000 implementing a full-fledged affirmative action program in City hiring. This program led to historic levels of ethnic minority hiring and retention in City government. The percentage of the City government&#x27;s workforce that was drawn from the ethnic minority community increased more than 30% in seven years, and the number of senior City administrators from the ethnic minority community by 2007 increased by over 85% since 2000. Thirty-two percent of Anderson&#x27;s appointments to City boards and commissions, and one-third of the staff in the Mayor&#x27;s Office, were individuals from ethnic minorities.

Along with Jon Huntsman Sr., Anderson co-convened the Alliance for Unity, a non-partisan group of religious and community leaders working to build bridges between diverse people throughout Utah.

====2002 Winter Olympics====
After working with Mitt Romney and leading Salt Lake City through the 2002 Winter Olympics, Anderson handed off the Olympic flag at the closing ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. One of Anderson&#x27;s key achievements was working effectively with the Utah State Legislature and Mitt Romney in making certain that public safety needs would be adequately financed. Romney later said, &quot;I think a lot of people would look at (the Olympic funding deal) and say it was a minor miracle. [Rocky] was instrumental, key, in reaching a solution.&quot;

Anderson endorsed Romney&#x27;s subsequent 2002 gubernatorial bid in Massachusetts. Romney later endorsed Anderson&#x27;s 2003 mayoral re-election campaign. Anderson has criticized Romney&#x27;s changes in position on certain issues after he decided to run for president of the U.S. &quot;The Mitt Romney who ran for and served as governor of Massachusetts was a very different Mitt Romney than has been running for President of the United States ... the real Mitt Romney — the Mitt Romney we all knew and [who] served as governor of Massachusetts — was very reasonable, very moderate — he felt that Roe versus Wade should be the end of the debate on choice; supporter of stem cell research — he was not the right-winger that he seemed to be when he decided he would run for President of the United States.&quot;

====Crime and criminal justice====
Anderson was a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, a bi-partisan group with the stated goal of &quot;making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets&quot;.

Anderson restructured Salt Lake City&#x27;s criminal justice system and, after reviewing the peer-reviewed literature indicating that DARE is ineffective in reducing drug use, discontinued the DARE program in Salt Lake City schools. Instead, he supported the implementation of other programs — ATLAS and ATHENA — that have demonstrated significant success.

He called for an end to the failed &quot;war on drugs&quot; and for better drug prevention education, the implementation of harm reduction policies, and the availability of substance abuse treatment on demand. He successfully lobbied President Clinton to grant a commutation of a lengthy prison sentence imposed on a Salt Lake City man who had already served several years in a federal penitentiary for his first and only conviction for violating drug laws.

Anderson also worked for years, with several other people, to finally obtain the release from a federal penitentiary of Weldon Angelos, who was sentenced under a federal minimum mandatory statute to 55 years in prison for selling three small amounts of marijuana while he had––but did not use or threaten anyone with––a gun.

In 2000, Anderson ordered the Salt Lake City Police Department to end its participation in the DARE program. He told DARE officials: &quot;I think your organization has been an absolute fraud on the people of this country ... For you to continue taking precious drug-prevention dollars when we have such a serious and, in some instances, growing addiction problem is unconscionable.&quot;

In 2006, Anderson appointed Chris Burbank as Salt Lake City Police Chief, emphasizing Burbank&#x27;s progressive approach to law enforcement and commitment to community policing. Under Burbank&#x27;s leadership, the department continued to align with Anderson&#x27;s focus on restorative justice and innovative reforms, including diverting offenders into treatment and counseling programs rather than imposing custodial sentences. Anderson praised Burbank&#x27;s efforts to foster trust within the community and address systemic issues in policing, which complemented the city&#x27;s broader criminal justice reforms.

Instead of pushing for more minor offenders to be sent to jail or prison, Anderson constructed innovative restorative justice programs, which earned Salt Lake City a nomination for a second World Leadership Award. He implemented reforms to ensure that mental health courts would channel mentally ill criminals into mandatory treatment programs rather than putting them behind bars. People arrested on drug charges, or for prostitution or the solicitation of prostitutes (as well as several other types of offenses), were sent through a comprehensive course of counselling rather than automatically being handed criminal convictions and custodial sentences. The results were better, and the costs far lower, than with the traditional retributive approach.

====Economy====
Anderson promulgated an administrative rule which stipulated that when it considered bids, the city should give preference to companies that paid a living wage to their employees. One Republican legislator called it the &quot;Rocky loophole&quot;, and was intent on closing it. The Utah Legislature then passed a statute prohibiting cities from giving such preference.

Establishing a reputation as a fiscal conservative, during the 1999–2007 period Anderson increased the balance of Salt Lake City&#x27;s general reserve fund by more than 62%, from $20.3 million to $32.6 million.

====Opposition to the 2003 war in Iraq and human rights abuses====
Described by Amy Goodman as &quot;one of the most outspoken critics of the Bush administration and the Iraq war,&quot; Anderson was a leading opponent of the invasion and occupation of Iraq by the U.S., both before and after the invasion, and was the only mayor of a major city to advocate the impeachment of President Bush and Vice-President Cheney.

He often spoke out against the invasion and occupation of Iraq, and in favor of impeachment, including at several large rallies and state and federal legislative hearings, in Salt Lake City; Olympia, Washington; New York; and Washington, D.C.; and on national television and radio programs hosted by Amy Goodman, Bill O&#x27;Reilly, and Tom Ashbrook. He engaged in a live debate with Sean Hannity that focused on Iraq and impeachment.
====Call for the impeachment of President George W. Bush====
Interviewed by Wolf Blitzer on CNN after an anti-war rally marking the fourth anniversary of the invasion and initial occupation of Iraq, Anderson advocated the impeachment of President George W. Bush, commenting:
:This president, by engaging in such incredible abuses of power, breaches of trust with both the Congress and the American people, and misleading us into this tragic and unbelievable war, the violation of treaties, other international law, our constitution, our own domestic laws, and then his role in heinous human rights abuses; I think all of that together calls for impeachment.

Anderson did not spare his criticism of the Democratic Party, saying:
:The fact that anybody would say that impeachment is off the table when we have a president who has been so egregious in his violations of our constitution, a president who asserts a unitary executive power, that is absolutely chilling.

In 2006, he expressed his view of the Democratic Party:

But what do I have to say about the Democratic Party? I&#x27;m ashamed, really, of how little leadership there has been. There has been just tremendous timidity on the part of the party, generally, although there have been a handful of exceptions. But, you know, we had one member of the United States Senate vote against the PATRIOT Act, the blank check that was given by Congress to this president, I think in total abrogation of the role of Congress under separation of powers and under the power to make war, to declare war. They gave that away to a president that didn&#x27;t have his facts straight and, I think, was manipulating the intelligence to sell this war.

Anderson researched, wrote, produced, and narrated a major multimedia piece concerning the invasion and occupation of Iraq, as well as the case for impeachment.

===Human rights advocacy===
After almost eight years as mayor of Salt Lake City, Anderson decided that he would not run for re-election, and that he would instead devote himself to educating, motivating, and mobilizing people to push elected officials and others to take action to prevent or stop major human rights abuses. Anderson has stressed the importance of people at the grassroots level advocating for progressive change, stating, &quot;We keep expecting elected officials will do the right thing, and the fact is they never do unless they&#x27;re pushed.&quot;

In January 2008 he founded High Road for Human Rights, a non-profit organization set up to achieve major reforms of US human rights policies and practices through unique, coordinated and sustained grassroots activism that complements the work of other human rights organizations.

The principle that underpined the organization is that most politicians will do nothing unless they are pushed. High Road was a bottom-up, grassroots-based organization founded &quot;to make it clear there will be short-term political costs for those who continue to ignore these kinds of problems ... Every time a congressperson or senator comes home and hold a meeting, there [should be] a group there pushing on the same issues&quot;, according to Anderson. High Road had a growing membership base and active local teams of people who met and worked together to bring about change.

The organization had a broad-based membership, with an Advisory Committee composed of prominent human-rights, environmental and political activists, as well as artists, actors, and writers, including Ed Asner, Harry Belafonte, Lester Brown, Hillary Brown, Ben Cohen, Daniel Ellsberg, Ross Gelbspan, Susan Joy Hassol, Mark Hertsgaard, Mimi Kennedy, Paul Rogat Loeb, Edward Mazria, Bill McKibben, Yoko Ono, Gus Speth, Winnie Singh, Sheila Watt-Cloutier, Elie Wiesel, and Terry Tempest Williams. High Road for Human Rights primarily addressed five issues: torture and the undermining of the rule of law, genocide, slavery, the death penalty, and the human rights implications of the climate crisis.

Anderson testified before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee during a hearing on September 25, 2008, concerning executive branch abuses of power, and spoke at rallies organized by High Road for Human Rights in which he called for accountability for torture. He has also researched, written, produced, and narrated two multimedia pieces focusing on torture and the undermining of the rule of law.

For his work on human rights matters during his tenure as Executive Director of High Road for Human Rights, Anderson received the Morehouse University Gandhi, King, Ikeda Award and the Bill of Rights Defense Committee&#x27;s Patriot Award.

===Criticisms of President Obama and the Democratic Party===
After President Obama&#x27;s election, Anderson was critical of many of his policy positions and staff selections. He opposed Susan Rice, whom Obama appointed as United States ambassador to the United Nations. Anderson criticized Rice for &quot;doing nothing&quot; to stop the Rwandan genocide as a staff member of the United States National Security Council. (Samantha Power described how Rice had advocated not using the word &quot;genocide&quot; in connection with the 1994 Rwandan genocide because of the potential &quot;effect on the November [congressional] election.&quot;). Anderson was also critical of the appointment by Obama of John Brennan as his counter-terrorism adviser because Brennan, as a member of the George W. Bush administration, had publicly supported wiretapping, &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot;, and the &quot;rendition&quot; of war-on-terror suspects to offshore prisons beyond the reach of American law. Anderson also pointed to what he described as Obama&#x27;s change of position after he received the Democratic presidential nomination on the question of immunity for telecom companies that cooperated with the Bush Administration&#x27;s wiretapping program.

He was also critical of Obama&#x27;s advocacy of &quot;clean coal&quot; after winning the Democratic nomination for president. Deeming himself to be &quot;non-partisan&quot; in his critiques of policy, Anderson has subsequently gone on to fiercely criticize the Obama Administration in numerous areas, stating:

I don&#x27;t know what people were expecting, all this hope and change nonsense ... There&#x27;s no question that we&#x27;re seeing a continuation [of the harm to], and even in some instances a worsening of our republic under this administration. The Obama administration has contended that no documents stamped as secret by a government agent should ever be allowed into evidence by our courts. That even goes beyond what the Bush Administration did.

Anderson has emphasized the apparent discrepancies between Obama&#x27;s positions as a candidate for the 2008 presidency and the actions he has taken as president, believing that &quot;President Obama has betrayed us in almost every single way from being a candidate to being the President of the United States.&quot; Anderson has pointed to Obama&#x27;s failure to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, refusing to prosecute what Anderson deems to be the &quot;war criminals&quot; of the Bush administration, continuing renditions, violating the War Power Clause of the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution by committing military troops to Libya without congressional authorization, and continuing, and even expanding, the occupation in Afghanistan. He stated that Obama is &quot;the least deserving recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in the history of the Nobel Peace Prize.&quot;

Concerning Obama&#x27;s alleged betrayal of the rule of law, Anderson has commented:

The complacency that has allowed wars of aggression, wars of choice, we weren&#x27;t forced into them, they were totally illegal wars under international law, the kinds of war crimes that took place, with people just saying, even our current president, &#x27;Oh, let&#x27;s put that behind us. Let&#x27;s not call people to account. Let&#x27;s not enforce our laws

On August 11, 2011, major news media in Utah reported that Anderson had denounced the Democratic Party and had resigned his membership. Anderson wrote in a letter to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that &quot;Until the Democratic Party shows some spine and draws a line in the sand — that an end to the tax breaks for the wealthy needs to be part of any debt/budget bill — please take my name off your list.&quot; He added: &quot;I&#x27;m done with the Democratic Party. As I said on Amy Goodman&#x27;s show a couple years ago, I&#x27;ve put my &#x27;Proud Democrat&#x27; coffee mug in storage. I think now I&#x27;ll just throw it in the garbage and have done with it&quot; and that &quot;The Constitution has been eviscerated while Democrats have stood by with nary a whimper. It is a gutless, unprincipled party, bought and paid for by the same interests that buy and pay for the Republican Party.&quot;

Anderson has stated that despite his earlier belief that the Bush administration would be merely an &quot;aberration&quot; in the history of the US, &quot;President Obama has institutionalized some of the worst abuses of the Bush Administration.&quot;

===2012 presidential campaign===

On November 29, 2011, the &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; quotes Anderson as saying, &quot;I&#x27;ll be announcing my candidacy,&quot; for the 2012 presidential nomination of a new national political party. This party later called the Justice Party. Its formation is reported to have been discussed among Anderson; Margaret Flowers, a medical doctor and proponent of a single-payer health plan; Kevin Zeese, an organizer of the Occupy D.C. movement; and former U.S. Rep. John Anderson, who ran for president as an independent in the 1980 presidential election.

Anderson formally accepted the 2012 presidential nomination of the Justice Party on January 13, 2012. His running mate was Luis J. Rodriguez, a Chicano activist and writer from California.

In March 2012, Anderson announced that he was seeking the presidential nomination of Americans Elect in addition to campaigning as the Justice Party nominee. The following May, Americans Elect announced that it would not run a presidential nominee in 2012.

Anderson was nominated by the Natural Law Party in Michigan, the Independent Party of Connecticut, the Independent Party of New Mexico, the Progressive Party of Oregon, and was on the ballot in Idaho and Tennessee as an independent candidate. Anderson appeared on the ballot in new states under the Justice Party banner with running-mate Rodriguez. He also sought the presidential nomination of the Peace and Freedom Party, but withdrew his bid for that nomination in August 2012. He received 43,018 votes, or 0.03 percent of the vote.

==Claims and responses==

In August 2005, Anderson violated Salt Lake City policy when he used $634 in public funds to purchase meals and alcoholic beverages on two occasions for musicians who performed at the Salt Lake City International Jazz Festival and for visiting mayors from throughout the country. The &quot;Deseret News&quot; published four consecutive front-page articles on the story, and portrayed the purchases as &quot;bar tabs&quot;.

When interviewed in September 2005 by the &quot;Deseret Morning News&quot;, Anderson stated that he disagreed with the policy, asserting that the provision of hospitality to out-of-town visitors is an important mayoral function, and that exceptions to the policy had been made previously. The policy was subsequently changed to allow appropriate purchases of food and alcohol when entertaining out-of-town guests. Mayor Anderson used his private funds to reimburse the City for expenditures incurred while entertaining visiting mayors.

The &quot;Deseret News&quot; soon generated additional controversy with its coverage of an interview that Anderson gave to &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper in London. Leading with the headline, &quot;LDS Church Not Taliban, Rocky says&quot;, the paper noted that Anderson had compared life in Utah to life under the Taliban. Anderson later said the comment, intended to be light-hearted, was not directed toward the state, its residents, or the LDS Church. Rather, he said, the comment was directed toward local media, particularly the Deseret Morning News, which had originally characterized his alcohol and food purchases at a local restaurant as &quot;bar tabs&quot;, and which had run articles about the fact that a Salt Lake City Reads Together book selection contained profanity.

In October 2005, local politicians accused Anderson of improperly spending public money. This time the issue centered around travel to Italy connected with the 2006 Winter Olympic Games. Anderson responded that the trip to Turin was to continue the longstanding Olympic tradition of delivering the Olympic message without the use of any fossil fuels and did not cost Utah taxpayers any money since it was privately financed.

On June 12, 2007, following a meeting in a City Council workroom, Anderson was involved in a physical and verbal confrontation with a real-estate developer Dell Loy Hansen. After Hansen reportedly yelled at and grabbed Anderson&#x27;s shoulder, Anderson responded by threatening to &quot;kick [Hansen&#x27;s] ass&quot; if he touched Anderson again.

== Personal life ==
Though Anderson has acknowledged the importance of some fundamental moral lessons he learned as a young member of the LDS Church, and has described the value he places on his Mormon heritage, he has spoken out about the LDS Church&#x27;s discrimination against gays and lesbians, and has written on this issue. He appeared in the films, &quot;8: The Mormon Proposition,&quot; and &quot;Quiet Heroes&quot;.

Anderson has one son, born in 1982, and has been married and divorced twice. He lives in Salt Lake City with his Golden Retriever, Franklin (full name: Franklin New Deal Wonder Boy) and, decades-old Yellow-Naped Amazon Parrot, Cardozo.

A multi-part documentary by Rhea Gavry and Doug Monroe about Rocky Anderson, including discussions with Daniel Ellsberg, Ralph Nader, Katrina vanden Heuvel and many others, ten years in the making, is now available for viewing.

<doc id="1068167" wikidata="Q5115724" url="?curid=1068167" title="Chuck Stone">
<text>Charles Sumner &quot;Chuck&quot; Stone, Jr. (July 21, 1924 – April 6, 2014) was an American pilot, newspaper editor, journalism professor, and author. He was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II and was the first president of the National Association of Black Journalists, serving from 1975 to 1977. Passionate about racial issues and supportive of many liberal causes, he refused to follow any party line, &quot;but called the issues as he saw them.&quot;

==Early life==
Chuck Stone was born July 21, 1924, in St. Louis, Missouri, to Charles Sumner Stone Sr and Madeline Chafin and raised in Hartford, Connecticut. His father was a business manager for a nearby college, and his mother was a payroll officer for the Hartford Board of Education. Stone graduated from Hartford Public High School in 1942 with honors, and from there proceeded to go into the army. Stone served in World War II, where he was member of the Tuskegee Airmen. He had already been admitted to Harvard University after completing his military service, but chose instead to matriculate at Wesleyan University, receiving degrees in political science and economics. He was the first African-American undergraduate in several decades at Wesleyan, graduating in the class of 1948 and serving as the commencement speaker. Stone subsequently received a master&#x27;s degree in sociology from the University of Chicago. After completing his education, he worked for the Chicago department store Carson Pirie Scott, serving as the store&#x27;s first African-American executive. He then studied law for eighteen months at the University of Connecticut before spending two years in Egypt, Gaza, and India as a representative for CARE.

==Professional career==
===Journalist and educator===
Chuck Stone&#x27;s career in journalism began in 1958, when his friend Al Duckett, then editor of &quot;The New York Age&quot;, hired him as a reporter, and then promoted him to editor. Stone also wrote articles for the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot; and the Washington D.C. edition of the &quot;Afro-American&quot; before being hired as editor-in-chief of &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot; in August 1963.

Years later, Stone worked as a columnist for The &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; from 1972 to 1991. Stone was very critical of the Philadelphia Police Department&#x27;s record of brutality towards African-Americans, which made him a trusted middleman between Philadelphia police and criminal suspects, more than 75 of whom &#x27;surrendered&#x27; to Stone rather than to the cops. 

In 1975, he was the M. Lyle Spencer Visiting Professor of Journalism in the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. He taught journalism at the University of Delaware for seven years, and from 1986 to 1988 he served as the House Advisor for the Martin Luther King Humanities House at the University of Delaware. Stone later became the Walter Spearman Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he retired in 2005.

Stone was nominated twice for the Pulitzer Prize, and was inducted into the National Association of Black Journalists Hall of Fame in August 2004. On March 29, 2007, Stone attended a ceremony in the United States Capitol rotunda, where he and the other veteran Tuskegee Airmen (or their widows) were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal by President George W. Bush in recognition of the Airmen&#x27;s service during World War II.

Stone was known for his passionate and bold personality. The New York Times refers to him as the &quot;Fiery, Trusted Columnist&quot; and journalist Dennis Jackson once did a segment on him titled, &quot;The Outspoken Mr. Stone.&quot;

===Civil rights===
Chuck Stone became associated with the Civil Rights Movement and the Black Power movement while working as an editor at Harlem&#x27;s &quot;New York Age&quot;, the Washington, D.C. &quot;Afro-American&quot;, and the Chicago &quot;Daily Defender.&quot; He also served three years as a special assistant and speechwriter for Rep. Adam Clayton Powell Jr. of the 22nd congressional district of New York, chair of the House Education and Labor Committee. In 1966 Stone was a member of a steering committee organized by Powell to discuss the meaning of the Black Power Movement.

In addition, he often served as a mediator between criminals and the police for over 20 years. His most notable role was during the negotiation of the 5-day Graterford Prison hostage crisis of 1981, in which Stone entered negotiations on day 4 of a stalemate between escaped prisoners and 29 hostages. Stone served as a go-between and successfully negotiated the end of the stand-off, for which he &quot;gained wide credibility.&quot;

His book, &quot;Black Political Power in America,&quot; analyzes ethnic political power as seen in the United States and encourages Black citizens to vote in a block in order to consolidate their voice in America, much as the Italians and Irish did in the past. This work, along with &quot;Tell It Like It Is&quot; and his other articles, draw attention to the racial inequalities in America and advocate for change.

==Personal life==
Stone was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He was a member of the fraternity&#x27;s World Policy Council, a think tank whose purpose is to expand Alpha Phi Alpha&#x27;s involvement in politics, and social and current policy to encompass international concerns. He was married to Louise Davis Stone for 49 years before they divorced. They are the parents of Krishna Stone, Allegra Stone and Charles Stone III, creator and star of the Budweiser &quot;Whassup!&quot; television commercials, and director of movies such as &quot;Drumline&quot;, &quot;Mr. 3000&quot;, and &quot;Paid In Full&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Stone died April 6, 2014, at the age of 89. He was survived by his three children, one grandchild, and two sisters. Bob Butler, president of the NABJ from 2013 to 2015, has named Stone to be the &quot;guiding force behind the NABJ,&quot;  and the key to the organization&#x27;s longevity. Butler has credited Stone with helping to improve diversity in newsroom management, stating that &quot;what (diversity) does exist is because of Chuck and the other founders of the NABJ.&quot; The Chuck Stone Program for Diversity in Education and Media is a workshop for rising high school seniors at the Hussman School of Journalism and Media, formerly known as the School of Journalism and Mass Communication. The program, which began in 2007, honors the legacy of Chuck Stone, who retired from the school in 2005. The Chuck Stone Papers are housed in the Rubenstein Rare Book and Manuscript Library as part of the John Hope Franklin Center at Duke University.

<text>Koroivos (, before 1955: Κελεβή - &quot;Kelevi&quot;) is a village in the municipal unit of Gastouni, Elis, Greece. It is situated in a flat rural area, south of the river Pineios. It is 2 km southeast of Lefkochori, 2 km west of Roupaki, 2 km southwest of Agia Mavra and 4 km east of Gastouni. The village was named after Coroebus of Elis, one of the winners of the first Ancient Olympic Games.Today, there is a Cultural Center in the village, while only a kindergarten is open, since the primary school was closed due to lack of children. In the center of the village dominates the temple of Agia Paraskevi, as well as the large square. The small church of the village cemetery, which is preserved to this day, dates from the era of Ottoman rule. The main activity and source of income for the inhabitants of Koroivos is agriculture and animal husbandry.

<text> ( &quot;The Pirate Bureau&quot;) was a Swedish think tank established to support the free sharing of information, culture, and intellectual property. provided a counterpoint to lobby groups such as the Swedish Anti-Piracy Bureau.

In 2005 released an anthology entitled &quot;Copy Me&quot;, containing selected texts previously available from its website. Members of participated in debates on Swedish Radio and Swedish Television and also gave several lectures in other European countries, such as at the 2005 22nd Chaos Communication Congress in Berlin.

&#x27;s activities might have changed over the years, partly as a result of the addition of the Pirate Party to the Swedish political scene. During Walpurgis Night 2007, burned all of their remaining copies of &quot;Copy Me&quot; in a ritual-like performance, declaring:

The file-sharing debate is hereby buried. When we talk about file-sharing from now on it&#x27;s as one of many ways to copy. We talk about better and worse ways of indexing, archiving and copying—not whether copying is right or wrong. Winter is pouring down the hillside. Make way for spring!

Jonas Andersson, a Swedish researcher specialized in the politics of file-sharing, gave this brief definition in October 2009:

Piratbyrån is entirely separate from The Pirate Party; it is more of a loosely organised think-tank, a website, a philosophical greenhouse or FAQ guide to digitization.

The MPA-funded Svenska antipiratbyrån (Swedish Anti-Piracy Bureau), an agency devoted to fighting copyright infringement, was formed in 2001, before Piratbyrån. Piratbyrån humorously copied the name of their opponent, removing the &quot;anti&quot;.

In June 2010 the group disbanded following the death of co-founder and prominent member Ibrahim Botani, also known as Ibi Kopimi Botani. Several former members of Piratbyrån are now involved in Telecomix. Around the same time, the front page of the website was replaced with the three words (Swedish for &#x27;Closed for reflection&#x27;).

==Self-definition==
In 2008, Piratbyrån published a report titled &quot;Piratbyrån – The Bureau of Piracy Activities 2007&quot; which starts with the following description of the organisation:

==Definition by Prix Ars Electronica jury==
As Piratbyrån received an &quot;award of distinction&quot; at Prix Ars Electronica in 2009, the jury statement said:

==BitTorrent tracker==
Members of Piratbyrån founded the BitTorrent tracker The Pirate Bay in 2003 as a Swedish language site. The Pirate Bay now operates independently from Piratbyrån, although a number of The Pirate Bay administrators were also active in Piratbyrån.

===Police raid===
On the morning of 31 May 2006, the servers of both The Pirate Bay, a popular Swedish BitTorrent tracker, and Piratbyrån were confiscated in a raid by Swedish police. The seizure was part of an investigation into possible illegal activities on the part of The Pirate Bay. Piratbyrån and the Antipiratbyrån set up a temporary news blog during the investigation.

==Activities in 2007==
In &quot;Piratbyrån – The Bureau of Piracy Activities 2007&quot;, published in 2008, Piratbyrån list its activities for the year 2007. Activities by Piratbyrån members include lectures at universities and conferences, the publication of reports, participation in art projects and research projects, an interview with Vanity Fair in February 2007, participation in the planning of The Oil of the 21st Century conference in Berlin, presentations at a Norwegian computer party (The Gathering), interviews to the media regarding the raid on The Pirate Bay, opening of a webshop to sell Kopimi Klothing, participation in the organisation of protests to mark the one-year anniversary of the police raid on The Pirate Bay, attendance of the BELEF07 festival in Belgrade (Serbia), and participation in the organisation of a one-day art event in Stockholm titled &quot;Who Makes And Owns Your Work&quot;.

In March 2007 Piratbyrån members were invited to a meeting with the executive group for the Swedish Film Institute, to share their views about film and copying. According to Piratbyrån &quot;The leadership listens with interest — only to some months later launch new anti-piracy initiatives...&quot;. In the same month Piratbyrån collaborates with the Norwegian group Piratgruppen, launching the counter-campaign &quot;Piracy frees music&quot; (promoted via The Pirate Bay), in response to the &quot;Piracy kills music&quot; anti-piracy campaign by the Norwegian record industry.

In 2007 members of Piratbyrån also contributed to the production of the film &quot;Steal This Film (Part Two)&quot;, which features interviews with Piratbyrån members and was released in December 2007.

==Activities in 2009==
Piratbyrån organized the &quot;Spectrial&quot;, a theatricalizing intervention in The Pirate Bay trial in Stockholm, early in 2009.

Installed the Embassy of Piracy – The Embassy of Piracy, for the First Internet Pavilion at the Venice Biennial

At the Prix Ars Electronica Piratbyrån received an &quot;award of distinction&quot; (including a prize money of 5000 euro) in the category &quot;Digital Communities&quot;. The motivation of the jury underlined the Piratbyrån &quot;never forget that humor and irony are among the strongest weapons available to cultural producers.&quot;

==Kopimi==
The &quot;Kopimi&quot; symbol was conceived in January 2005 by Piratbyrån co-founder Ibrahim Botani. The logo, pronounced &quot;copy me&quot;, can be used to specifically request people to copy and distribute a work, for any purpose. Botani intended the logo to be the opposite of copyright, which usually restricts copying a work, and as a unifying symbol of the anti-copyright ideas Piratbyrån stood for. As such, the Kopimi symbol may be considered an anti-copyright notice of sorts.

Later in 2005, the Kopimi logotype was included in the Piratbyrån book &quot;Copy Me&quot;. In June of that year, the Kopimi symbol was added to the front page of the Pirate Bay. Throughout the next 15 years, three different variants of the logo were used on the front page, until it was removed sometime in March/April 2020.
The history section of the site stated: &quot;&quot;Some of you may have noticed that little symbol at the bottom of the page, the pyramid. It&#x27;s a symbol called Kopimi (Copy Me) which was founded by an old friend of ours, the artist Ibi Botani. It&#x27;s basically about promoting copying. Using the kopimi symbol on something not only shows that it is ok to copy it, it says it &quot;wants&quot; to be copied, mixed or manipulated!&quot;

While Kopimi may appear to be a public-domain-equivalent license, no one associated with Piratbyrån ever called Kopimi a license, instead describing it as a symbol of certain ideas. The Open Source Initiative, Free Software Foundation, or any other organisation within the open-source movement, does not list Kopimi as an approved license. Since May 2024, the website of Kopimi explicitly states: &quot;Kopimi is not a copyright license. For best results, release your work under a license like Creative Commons CC0, and use a kopimi badge ... to encourage sharing and remixing&quot;.

Wikimedia Commons, a repository of free content and a sister site of Wikipedia, allows users to label their files with Kopimi.

===Kopimism===

&quot;Kopimism&quot; and &quot;kopimist&quot; are terms derived from Botani&#x27;s symbol. It is unclear who coined them, but they have been used since at least July 2006. In January 2007, the Pirate Bay used the terms when they attempted to buy Sealand, a sea fort off the coast of England and a self-proclaimed country. The Pirate Bay declared: &quot;To make sure the owners will be kopimistic and that the country won&#x27;t be governed by people that do not care about its future, we have come up with a plan. With the help of all the kopimists on Internets, we want to buy Sealand.&quot;&quot;

The Missionary Church of Kopimism was founded in 2010 by Isak Gerson, a philosophy student and a member of the Pirate Party of Sweden. After two failed attempts, Kopimism was officially recognized as a religion by the Swedish government in January 2012. The Church considers copying a holy virtue, and uses various Kopimi symbols to present itself.

===Copie===

Inspired by Kopimi, the Pirate Party of Brazil created their own version of the concept called &quot;Copie&quot;, which plays both on the Portuguese words &quot;copie&quot; (copy) and &quot;co-pie&quot; (tweet together). The Copie logotype shows 5 birds tweeting together.

<doc id="1068177" wikidata="Q5467924" url="?curid=1068177" title="Ford SHO V6 engine">
<text>The Ford SHO V6 is a family of DOHC V6 engines fitted to the Ford Taurus SHO from 1989 to 1995. The designation SHO denotes Super High Output. 

Due to the engine&#x27;s unusual and aesthetically pleasing appearance it is sometimes transplanted into other vehicles. Its distinctive variable length intake manifold is bilaterally symmetrical, so it can be rotated 180 degrees (making it face &quot;backwards&quot; on the engine, relative to its original installation orientation) to ease the engine&#x27;s transition from transverse to longitudinal mounting.

The SHO engines share a common bell housing pattern with the following Ford engines: the 2.3/2.5 L FWD HSC I4, the 3.0 L FWD/RWD Vulcan V6, and the 3.8 L FWD Canadian Essex V6. In 1996, Ford discontinued the SHO V6 and began fitting the Taurus SHOs with the SHO 3.4 L V8 and the Ford AX4N automatic transmission.

== Origin ==
In 1984, executives of the Yamaha Motor Corporation signed a contract with the Ford Motor Company to develop, produce, and supply a compact 60° DOHC V6 engine based upon the existing Vulcan engine for transverse application.

== 3.0 L ==

The SHO V6 was a high-tech and revolutionary design when it debuted in 1988. Displacing , it was an iron block, closed deck, aluminum head 24-valve DOHC engine with an innovative variable length intake manifold. Its oversquare and symmetrical design, which sported an bore and stroke, gave the high-revving engine an output of at 6200 rpm and of torque at 4800 rpm at the flywheel, and it sported the added luxury of being able to be used in rear-drive applications. Redline was marked on the tachometer at 7000 rpm, and fuel cut-off occurred at 7300 rpm. This engine was only available with the Ford MTX-IV transmission.

== 3.2 L ==

From 1993 to 1995, the SHO engine was sold in two displacements: the existing continued to be sold mated to the MTX-IV manual transmission, and a new engine was sold mated to the Ford AX4S automatic transmission. The new engine, while retaining the same stroke of its brother, sported a larger bore that helped raise torque output to at 4000 rpm at the flywheel. Power output was still , but now at 6000 rpm; this was due to a milder cam setup compared to the more aggressive intake camshaft in the version.

== Other Ford vehicles ==

In 1989, with the help of Roush Racing, Ford Truck Public Affairs created a one-off Ford Ranger, dubbed the &quot;SHO Ranger&quot;, with a SHO V6 and a Mustang GT&#x27;s T-5 manual transmission. According to D.A. &quot;Woody&quot; Haines, assistant manager of that division, they commissioned the project truck &quot;to test the market.&quot;

In 1993, Ford Canada hand-built 40 Mercury Sables, some of which were powered by SHO V6 engines, as part of their AIV (Aluminum Intensive Vehicle) program and released 20 to the public. Using aluminum suspension elements and aluminum body panels, held together with spot welding and adhesive joining processes developed specifically for this vehicle, the end result was a car that was lighter than a SHO Taurus. Multimatic Motorsports entered one of these vehicles in the 1995 One Lap of America event, finishing 15th overall and 1st in the Mid-Price class.

== Modifications ==

A popular modification to cars equipped with the SHO engine is to replace the engine with a engine. Further modification can include installing the cams from a engine into a engine. These more aggressive cams, along with a higher torque output have been known to allow the manual transmission-equipped Taurus SHO to run into the low 14s on the .

== SHOGun Festiva ==
In 1990, Chuck Beck of Special Editions and Rick Titus took seven Ford Festivas and mounted SHO V6s − still mated to their native transmissions − behind the front seats in mid-rear engine configuration. Along with substantial cosmetic body changes, including custom fiberglass wheel arches to accommodate a wider stance and larger tires, the suspension was completely redesigned. Each car was painted a different color. These changes resulted in a car that could do a quarter-mile (400 m) run in 12.9 seconds at , and could achieve a lateral acceleration figure ranging from .95 to 1.04 g. Two of the seven are notable; Jay Leno owns number 003 (the silver one), and number 005 (the purple one) included special modifications for competition in the SCCA, including a rollcage and 5-point restraints.

 One was destroyed in the 2021–2022 Boulder County fires.

Since the creation of these cars, others have imitated the idea by performing SHO-to-Festiva transplants of their own.

<text>Frederick Ralph Cornelius Penner (born November 6, 1946) is a Canadian children&#x27;s entertainer and musician known for the song &quot;The Cat Came Back&quot; and his television series, &quot;Fred Penner&#x27;s Place&quot;, which aired on CBC in Canada from 1985 to 1997 and in the United States on Nickelodeon from 1989 to 1992.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Penner was born on November 6, 1946, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Lydia Agathe Penner (&quot;née&quot; Winters, 1913–2005) and Edward W. Penner of Winkler, Manitoba. By the age of four, he had begun making up songs while travelling on the bus with his mother. He taught himself how to play the guitar when he was in grade school, and performed in school choirs and pageants. Through his experiences with his sister Susan, who had Down syndrome, he recognized the therapeutic value of music.

Penner received his high school diploma at Kelvin High School, where he took lead roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. After graduating from the University of Winnipeg with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and psychology, he spent time working with mentally and physically disabled children, using music to comfort and entertain.

===Music and television career===
By 1972, Penner was a full-time professional musician, performing folk music songs in Winnipeg. In the mid-70s, Penner performed in a number of groups, most notably the folk music group Kornstock, along with Al Simmons, Bob King, both of whom also became well-known children&#x27;s entertainers, and drummer Mike Klym.

In 1977, Penner met choreographer and future wife, Odette Graziella Heyn, with whom he started a children&#x27;s dance theatre company. Penner accepted an offer to do a recording, which resulted in the album &quot;The Cat Came Back&quot;, which launched his career and established him as one of Canada&#x27;s leading children&#x27;s entertainers. Penner is noted as a pioneer of children&#x27;s music in Canada.

In 1984, he appeared on the children&#x27;s television show, &quot;The Elephant Show&quot;, singing &quot;The Cat Came Back&quot; and was given his own show, &quot;Fred Penner&#x27;s Place&quot; the next year. The show became a hit and aired on CBC in Canada from 1985 to 1997 and in the United States on Nickelodeon from 1989 to 1992. The show is known for Penner&#x27;s musical performances, special guests, puppets including Word Bird, and the famous title sequence, which features Penner&#x27;s entry through a hollow log. The show won or received nominations for several awards including a Juno Award in 1989 and a Gemini Award in 1994. Penner recorded more than 900 episodes of the show. Since the show ended, Penner continues to perform and record regularly.

==Accolades==
Penner has received a Juno Award for Children&#x27;s Album of the Year four times: in 1989, 2003, 2015 and 2018.

In 1991, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada for &quot;using music and song to entertain and educate his young audience&quot;. In 2011, he was made a Member of the Order of Manitoba.

Penner received an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of Alberta June 15, 2023 for his lifetime of work supporting inclusivity and children&#x27;s advocacy.

==Personal==
As of 2022, Penner lives with his second wife in Courtenay, British Columbia. Previously he split his time between Winnipeg and Toronto. He has four children by his first marriage to Odette Heyn. He remarried in 2016, to theatre director Rae Ellen Bodie. His daughter Hayley Gene Penner is a songwriter.

Penner has promoted a number of humanitarian causes with UNESCO, UNICEF, World Vision and the National Conference on Down Syndrome.

<text>The Clouds (also called just Clouds) are an indie rock band from Sydney, Australia formed in December 1989. The core of the group consisted of frontwomen Jodi Phillis (guitar and vocals) and Patricia &quot;Trish&quot; Young (bass and vocals). The line-up of The Clouds has changed several times with different drummers and lead guitarists. The Clouds&#x27; music is distinguished by rapid and unusual chord changes, creative bass guitar, and Phillis and Young&#x27;s vocal harmonies. They released 4 albums and numerous EPs and singles before breaking up in 1997. They reformed in 2011.

==History==
===1989–1993: &quot;Penny Century&quot;, &quot;Octopus&quot; &amp; &quot;Thunderhead&quot;===
The Clouds were one of Australia&#x27;s most promising acts in the late 1980s and early 1990s, along with other up-and-comers like Ratcat, Falling Joys, Tall Tales and True and The Hummingbirds.

The Clouds secured a recording contract with Red Eye Records in 1990 and began recording their debut EP in May which was released in October, titled &quot;Cloud Factory&quot;. The EP peaked at number 118 on the ARIA charts In April 1991, they released the EP &quot;Loot&quot;, featuring the song &quot;Soul Eater&quot;. &quot;Loot&quot; peaked at number 22 on the ARIA chart.

In mid 1991, recording for the &quot;Penny Century&quot; album began. The album was released in October 1991, and peaked at number 23 on the ARIA Chart. It spawned the singles &quot;Hieronymous&quot; and &quot;Anthem&quot;.

In September 1992, the band released &quot;Say It&quot;, the lead single from their second studio album &quot;Octopus&quot; which was released in October 1992.
&quot;Octopus&quot; peaked at number 24 on the ARIA charts.

In June 1993, recording began on the third album, &quot;Thunderhead&quot;. The lead single &quot;Bower of Bliss&quot; was released in August. &quot;Thunderhead&quot; was released in October, and peaked at number 30 on the ARIA chart. The second single, &quot;Alchemy&#x27;s Dead&quot; was released in December.

===1994–1999: &quot;Futura&quot; and break up===
In 1994, Clouds took a six-month tour to Europe and the United States, securing an American record deal with Elektra Records. Whilst in London the EP &quot;Beetroot&quot; was recorded. It was released in Australia in October 1994 and peaked at number 65 on the ARIA chart.

Following the signing with Elektra Records &quot;Thunderhead&quot; was released in the United States in March 1995 along with numerous promotional singles. However, shortly after these releases The Clouds were dumped by Elektra. Despite this setback, recording of new songs continued and two singles were released in 1995, &quot;Aquamarine&quot; and &quot;Panel Van&quot; in August and November 1995, respectively.

In May 1996, Red Eye Records released a re-released &quot;Penny Century&quot; which included a limited edition bonus CD of early songs called &quot;Pre-Raphaelite&quot;. This helped the album to reach gold accreditation in Australia (35,000 copies sold).

In November 1996, the band released their fourth studio album &quot;Futura&quot; which peaked at number 50 on the ARIA chart. The group eventually disbanded in 1997.

In 1999, the compilation album &quot;Favourites&quot; was released.

===2000–present: reformation ===
Although Phillis was living in a small town in Tasmania and Young was living in London, the two occasionally reunited over the years to perform a few shows. Phillis went on to form The Dearhunters and Roger Loves Betty, and also records and performs as a solo artist.

In late 2005, Phillis and Young resurfaced under the name The Girls from the Clouds, releasing a 5-track EP titled &quot;Lalalala&quot;. In April 2007, however, the duo announced they had disbanded again.

The Clouds reunited to tour with Jesus Jones and The Wonder Stuff in August 2011. In late 2011 and early 2012, the band toured Australia in The Clouds Reunion Tour.

In February 2017, The Clouds released a new song, &quot;Mabel&#x27;s Bookshop&quot; from an EP &quot;Zaffre&quot;, their first new music in 20 years. Two more songs followed in 2017 and 2019.

They toured at the 2017 The Day on the Green with Blondie and Cyndi Lauper.

In December 2022, The Clouds toured in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of &quot;Penny Century&quot;.

<doc id="1068192" wikidata="Q448953" url="?curid=1068192" title="Hubertine Auclert">
<text>Hubertine Auclert (; 10 April 1848 – 4 August 1914) was a leading French feminist and a campaigner for women&#x27;s suffrage.

==Early life==
Born in the Allier &quot;département&quot; in the Auvergne area of France into a middle-class family, Hubertine Auclert&#x27;s father died when she was 13 and her mother sent her to live and study in a Roman Catholic convent. As a young girl she planned to become a nun but left the convent at 16. Estranged from her mother, she lived with her uncle for a time but had to return to the convent a few years later. She left the convent for good in 1869 and moved to Paris in 1873. There, the ousting of Emperor Napoleon III and the establishment of the Third Republic opened the door to activism on the part of women, who began demanding changes to the Napoleonic Code to provide education and economic independence for women and the legalisation of divorce.

==Political activism and feminism==
Auclert, inspired by the high-profile activities of Maria Deraismes and Léon Richer, became involved with feminist work and eventually took a job as Richer&#x27;s secretary. Influenced by her life in a Catholic convent, and like many of the leading republican feminists at the time, she was a militant anticlerical. While the main focus of the French feminist movement was directed towards changes to the laws, Auclert pushed further by demanding that women be given the right to run for public office and claiming that the unfair laws would never have been passed had the views of women legislators been heard. In 1876, she founded the &quot;Société le droit des femmes&quot; (The Rights of Women) to support women&#x27;s suffrage, and in 1883, the organization formally changed its name to the &quot;Société le suffrage des femmes&quot; (Women&#x27;s Suffrage Society).

In 1878, the &quot;International Congress on Women&#x27;s Rights&quot; was held in Paris but to the chagrin of Auclert, it did not support women&#x27;s suffrage. Resolute, in 1880, Auclert began a tax revolt, arguing that without representation women should not be subjected to taxation. One of her legal advisors was attorney Antonin Lévrier, whom she later married. On 13 February 1881 she launched &quot;La Citoyenne&quot;, a monthly that argued vociferously for women&#x27;s enfranchisement. The paper received vocal support from even the elite in the feminist movement, such as Séverine, and socialite Marie Bashkirtseff wrote several articles for the newspaper. In her writings, she also brought the term feminism, a term first coined by Charles Fourier, into the English language in the 1890s. 

At the Socialist Workers&#x27; Congress in Marseille in 1879, Auclert made passionate pleas for women&#x27;s rights, but argued that they needed economic independence due to their &quot;natural&quot; motherhood.
Auclert was on a special committee to consider the equality of women and was given an hour to speak to the congress on the subject.
After her speech, she was invited to head a committee to prepare a statement on women&#x27;s rights. The statement, which said women should have the same social, legal, political and working rights as men, was approved by the congress.

In 1884, the French government finally legalized divorce, but Auclert denounced it because of the law&#x27;s blatant bias against women that still did not allow a woman to keep her wages. Auclert proposed the radical idea that there should be a marriage contract between spouses with separation of property.

==Algeria and feminism==
Auclert, and her husband, moved to Algeria in 1888 where they would remain for four years until he died and she returned to Paris. While in Algeria, Auclert extensively studied and recorded the daily lives of Arab women. Auclert paralleled the male prejudice against women in France with the racial prejudice against the colonized in Algeria as the &quot;French Algerians… do everything possible to keep the Arabs in a state of ignorance so conductive to exploitation and domination.&quot;

Her activism for the rights of Algerian women paralleled the &quot;familial&quot; or &quot;maternalist&quot; feminism that she advocated for in France. Such prejudice took form as French collusion with Arab males to suppress Arab women&#x27;s education and to respect Islamic practices of child marriages, polygamy, and bride trade which restricted the rights of the Arab woman.

Auclert acted out of a moral duty to elevate the status of Arab women to make it possible for them to obtain the same dignity of French women. In Algeria and on her return to France, Auclert pursued legal action to acknowledge the rights of Arab women, such as petitions for improved education, and the abolition of polygamy. While her thoughts on Islamic culture were entrenched in imperial thinking, she made clear the negative influence of French colonialism on the societies in which they settled. She claimed that the oppression from Islamic law was made worse by collusion between the French administrators and Arab men. Arab males, in her eyes, appeared backwards in part because of the effects of racism from the French settlers. Because of male oppression, she saw the colonized women as the most significant sufferers. She claimed because of the patriarchy of both the Arabs and the French, the Algerian women were the least advanced socially, morally, and culturally.

She wrote about the consequences Arab women suffered because of Islam in the Algerian press: &quot;Le Radical Algérien,&quot; and in &quot;La Citoyenne&quot;. Unintentionally, her work in Algeria served as further justification for French colonialism as it highlighted the perceived degraded condition of Arab women under Algerian rule. No longer able to support &quot;La Citoyenne&quot; financially, the newspaper closed, but she continued her activism. In 1900, she witnessed the establishment of the &quot;National Council of French Women&quot; as an umbrella organisation for feminist groups in France all of which soon came to support suffrage.

===Criticism===
Julia Clancy-Smith, author of &quot;Islam, Gender, and Identities in the Making of French Algeria, &quot;writes that, though Auclert criticizes the negative influence of French colonialism, she is similar to contemporary British feminists in using a discourse of a &quot;universal sisterhood&quot; that was oxymoronically imperial and hierarchical to protect the colonized populations. While Auclert blamed French men for worsening the &quot;barbarism&quot; of Arab men and thus worsening the condition of Arab women, much of her rhetoric to advocate for Arab women painted them as victims of their religion.

Clancy-Smith quotes that Auclert claimed Arab men rendered the women &quot;little victims of Muslim debauchery,&quot; and must be &quot;freed from their cages, walled homes, and cloisters&quot; to assimilate into Frenchwomen. Auclert&#x27;s writing about Algerian women focused on, in Clancy-Smith&#x27;s words, &quot;the morally perverse sexual customs of the natives.&quot; For example, the most provocative section of Auclert&#x27;s work detailed her argument that &quot;Arab marriage is child rape.&quot; Clancy-Smith also critiques Auclert&#x27;s success as an activist: all of the petitions that Auclert submitted on behalf of Algerian women were met with indifference, according to Auclert. There are no records of Muslim women&#x27;s awareness or response to her advocacy. Clancy-Smith argues that Auclert returned to Paris in 1892 without &quot;any concrete results,&quot; other than ironically convincing many in France that the Algerians were too barbaric and unsuitable for political rights.

==Later activism and death==
In July 1907 married women in France were finally given incomplete control over their own salaries due to the lobbying of the &quot;Avant-Courrière&quot; (Forerunner) association led by Jeanne Schmahl.

If a woman bought something with her earnings that she did not consume herself, such as a piece of furniture, it became her husband&#x27;s property unless there was a marriage contract that specified otherwise, which normally occurred with prosperous couples.
In November 1907, the General Council of the Seine yielded to pressure from Auclert and gave its support to Paul Dussaussoy&#x27;s 1906 bill proposing limited women&#x27;s suffrage.

The 60-year-old Auclert continued her push for total equality. In 1908, she symbolically smashed a ballot box during municipal elections in Paris, and in 1910, she and Marguerite Durand defied authorities and presented themselves as candidates in the elections for members of the legislative assembly.

Considered one of the central figures in the history of the French women&#x27;s rights movement, Auclert continued her activism until her death in 1914, at 66, the day after France declared war on Germany, entering World War I. She is interred in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris; the sculpture on her tomb commemorates the &quot;&quot;Suffrage des Femmes&quot;.&quot;

<text>The National Association of Black Journalists Hall of Fame is a hall of fame project of the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) honoring African-American and other journalists. The original Hall of Fame list was established on April 5, 1990, with the induction of seven individuals. No further individuals were inducted until the Hall of Fame was revived by the NABJ in 2004. Since 2004, several individuals have been inducted to the Hall of Fame each year. Nominations are approved by the NABJ Board of Directors, and new inductees are installed annually at the NABJ Hall of Fame Banquet and Inductions. Thirty-nine individuals are currently inductees in the Hall of Fame.

<text>The Tupolev Tu-98 (NATO reporting name Backfin) was a prototype swept wing jet bomber developed by Tupolev for the Soviet Union.

==Development==
The Tu-98 emerged from a program for a fast supersonic bomber to replace the Tupolev Tu-16. It was powered by two Lyulka AL-7 turbojet engines with side-mounted intakes high on the fuselage (above the wingroot). The Tu-98 was built in 1955 and first flown in 1956. It was shown to an American delegation at the Tushino airfield outside Moscow in June 1956, but it subsequently did not enter service, and only the single prototype was completed.

The basic design of the Tu-98 had a great influence on the subsequent prototype of the Tupolev Tu-28 interceptor, officially known as the Tu-128 (NATO codename &#x27;Fiddler&#x27;).

The Tu-98 was a supersonic bomber developed by OKB-156, designed as a replacement for the Tu-16. Work on the prototype began on the basis of the Resolution of the USSR Council of Ministers on April 12, 1954. The aircraft&#x27;s chief designer was D. S. Markov.

The aircraft was built in 1955 and took to the air for the first time in 1956. Test flights continued until 1959. The Tu-98 did not pass any of the state tests nor did it enter into production due to numerous, unresolved manufacturing and technological difficulties. The aircraft was later used as a flying, supersonic research laboratory during the development of the Tu-128 interceptor.

The last flight was made on November 21, 1960, when the undercarriage collapsed. The prototype was subsequently written off.

The &quot;98&quot; was further developed into a lightweight version of the supersonic bomber called the &quot;98A&quot; (Tu-24).

The Tu-98 was shown to a US delegation under General Twining at the Kubinka military airfield near Moscow in June 1956 and presented by Soviet first secretary Nikita Khrushchev as the latest Soviet bomber development. The US military was impressed and, as no details were given about the aircraft, assigned the design to the Yakovlev design office. There were also speculations about an alleged series production, which was estimated at 15 pieces per year in 1958, which is why NATO gave the code name Backfin and the (fictitious) designation Yak-42. A commissioning was never planned for the Tu-98. The only prototype was flown only for test purposes and at the air parade in Tushino.

The design of the Tu-98 had a major impact on the prototype of the Tupolev Tu-28 interceptor, officially known as the Tu-128. In addition to aerodynamic tests for the Tu-128, the Tu-98 was used for tests with the future Tu-128 RP-7 &quot;Smersch&quot; radar, where the glazed bow was replaced by the device, and the &quot;Kompleks 80&quot; fire control system. The R-4 air-to-air missiles intended as armament for this type were also tested with the Tu-98. The official name of the machine for it was Tu-98LL for &quot;letajuschtschaja laboratorija&quot;, flying laboratory. After these tests were completed, the Tu-98 was parked in Zhukovsky for a while before it was scrapped. The Tu-98 also provided information for the construction of the Tu-22.

== Design ==

The aircraft is built according to the scheme of a mid wing with a swept wing (the sweep angle on the leading edge is 55 degrees). Two AL-7F engines were installed in the stern, and the car was distinguished by long canals and air intakes shifted upwards. The main landing gear was located in the fuselage, which made the wing “clean”, but led to a considerable reduction of stability on the ground. The crew consisted of a pilot - a ship commander, a navigator-operator and a navigator-navigator. All crew stations had ejection seats. The front of the aircraft was a single pressurized cabin. Behind the pressurized cabin there was a technical compartment with photographic equipment (AFA-33/75). The fuel system consisted of 4 main and one centering tanks in the fuselage. Wing - two-spar, caisson design.

The control system was performed according to the traditional scheme - with a fixed stabilizer, although for the first time in all control channels, Andrey Nikolayevich agreed to use irreversible hydraulic boosters (his saying is known - “the best booster is the one that stands on the ground”). The front desk had a two-wheel axle, the main ones had two pairs of wheels.

For the first time in the domestic bomber, a remote-controlled aft-firing dual AM-23 gun DK-18 installation was used. The guns were aimed by the ARS-1 “Argon” radar sight, the antenna unit of which was placed in the upper part of vertical stabilizer. An additional AM-23 cannon was mounted in the forward right fuselage, which could be fired by the pilot.

Rocket-bomb armament aircraft provided suspension FAB-100, FAB-250 or FAB-500 in various combinations, as well as up to 300 ARS-85, or 61 TRS-132, or 18 TRS-212. For naval aviation, it was supposed to arm the aircraft with AMD-500 and AMD-100 mines, torpedoes RAT-52, MAN, MAV and TAN-53. As the sighting equipment on the plane set radar &quot;Initiative&quot; and collimator sights OPB-16.

<text>Brands Hatch is a motor racing circuit in West Kingsdown, Kent, England, United Kingdom. Originally used as a grasstrack motorcycle circuit on farmland, it hosted 12 runnings of the British Grand Prix between 1964 and 1986 and currently hosts many British and International racing events. The venue is owned and operated by Jonathan Palmer&#x27;s MotorSport Vision organisation.

== Circuit ==

Brands Hatch offers two layout configurations. The &quot;Indy Circuit&quot; layout is located entirely within a natural amphitheatre offering spectators views of almost all of the shorter configurations from wherever they watch. The &quot;Grand Prix&quot; layout has played host to several Formula One Grands Prix, including those with moments such as Jo Siffert&#x27;s duel with Chris Amon in and 1992 World Driver&#x27;s Champion Nigel Mansell&#x27;s first win in . Noise restrictions and the proximity of the Grand Prix loop to local residents mean that the number of race meetings held on the extended circuit is limited to just a few per year (usually for higher-profile series such as the BTCC and the BSB).

The full Grand Prix circuit begins on the Brabham Straight, an off-camber, slightly curved stretch, before plunging into the right-hander at Paddock Hill Bend, with gradients of 8%. Despite the difficulty of the curve, due to the straight that precedes it, it is one of the track&#x27;s few overtaking spots. The next corner, Druids, is a hairpin bend, taken after an uphill braking zone at Hailwood Hill. The track then curves around the south bank spectator area into the downhill, off-camber Graham Hill Bend, and another, slightly bent stretch at the Cooper Straight, which runs parallel to the pit lane. After the straight, the circuit climbs uphill though the decreasing-radius Surtees turn, before moving onto the back straight where the track&#x27;s top speeds can be reached. The most significant elevation changes on the circuit occur here at Pilgrim&#x27;s Drop and Hawthorn Hill, which leads into Hawthorn Bend (with some parts approaching 7%). The track then loops around the woodland with a series of mid-speed corners, most notably the dip at Westfield and Dingle Dell and the blind Sheene curve. From there the track then emerges from the left hand and cambered Stirlings Bend onto the short straight to Clearways and rejoins the Indy Circuit for Clark Curve with its uphill off-camber approach to the pit straight and the start/finish line.

The British Rallycross Circuit at Brands Hatch was designed and constructed by Trevor Hopkins, a four-times British Rallycross Champion. Completed around 1981, the circuit spans approximately . A notable feature is the starting point on the startline, followed by a right turn and descent on loose terrain at Paddock Hill Bend. After navigating the left-right Esses at the bottom, the circuit rejoins the Indy Circuit, leading up and around Druids hairpin. A 90-degree left turn through Langley&#x27;s Gap and across the knife-edge connects back to the Indy Circuit, but in an anti-clockwise direction. Subsequently, cars proceed from Cooper Straight, swooping up the old link road and returning to Paddock.

==History==

===Origins – 1940s===

Brands Hatch was originally the name of a natural grassy hollow that was shaped like an amphitheatre. 

Although the site was originally used as a military training ground, the fields belonging to Brands Farm were first used as a circuit by a group of Gravesend cyclists led by Ron Argent, with the permission of the local farmer and landowner, Harry White. Using the natural contours of the land, many cyclists from around London practised, raced and ran time trials on the dirt roads carved out by farm machinery. The first actual race on the circuit was held in 1926, over between cyclists and cross-country runners. Within a few years, motorcyclists were using the circuit, laying out a three-quarter-mile anti-clockwise track in the valley. They also saw the advantage of competing in a natural arena just a few hundred yards from the A20, and with the passage of time, a kidney-shaped circuit came into use. The first motorcycle races were &quot;very informal&quot; with much of the organisation being done on the spot. Initially, the racing was on a straight strip approximately where Cooper Straight came to be when the track was tarmacked. Brands Hatch remained in operation during the 1930s, but after being used as a military vehicle park and being subject to many bombing raids during World War II, it needed much work before it could become a professional racing circuit.

In 1932, four local motorcycling clubs joined forces (Bermondsey, Owls, Sidcup and West Kingsdown) and staged their first meeting that March.

Motorcycle racing quickly resumed after World War II and in 1947, Joe Francis (managing director of Brands Hatch Stadium Ltd.) persuaded the BBC to televise a grass track meeting, the first motorcycle event to be televised on British TV.

===1950s===

Following World War II, cinders were laid on the track of what was by then known as &quot;Brands Hatch Stadium&quot; and motorcycle racing continued. That was until 1950 when the 500 Club managed to persuade Joe Francis, that the future for his stadium lay in car and motorcycle road racing. The group behind 500 c.c. single-seater racing cars was the 500 Club and it, together with the owners, invested the sum of £17,000 on a tarmac surface.

Thus Brands Hatch was born as a motor racing venue, and on 16 April 1950, the opening meeting was scheduled for the first purpose-built post-war racing circuit in England, approval having been given by the RAC following a demonstration by a handful of 500s in February. Amongst those giving the demonstration was a very young Stirling Moss. The Half-Litre Car Club for 500cc Formula 3 organised that first race on 16 April, with 7,000 spectators coming to witness these cars complete in 10 races. Don Parker won the first race. Before the year was out, five meetings had been held, with the events running to a similar programme. The June meeting was a Moss benefit for he won all five races he entered in the Works Cooper and set a new lap record. The August Bank Holiday meeting saw for the first time, involvement of the national press with the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; sponsoring the main event of the day. The old cinder track had been in length, but the tarmac circuit was lengthened to and now ran anticlockwise. The Maidstone &amp; Mid-Kent Motor Club invited a number of sports car drivers to test the circuit on 5 November, this being the first time that any car other than a 500cc had used it, and they ran clockwise.

In 1951, season included seven car meetings, all for Formula 3 and they were again organised the Half-Litre Car Club to which the 500 Club had changed its name since becoming a Limited Company. In February, the Aston Martin Owners Club tested some 1.5-litre sports cars at Brands Hatch preparatory to the full International season starting.

The 1952 season saw the emergence of Stuart Lewis-Evans. Les Leston raised the lap record to (50.6sec) – the first time that had been exceeded.

1953 saw the introductions of raised spectator protection banks. This was to be Parker&#x27;s year for he won the &quot;Autosport&quot; Formula 3 Championship taking seven races at Brands on his way the title. Some 50,000 people packed into the &quot;Daily Telegraph International&quot; and as the season came to an end Parker raised the lap record to (48.4secs). During 1953, the Universal Motor Racing Club was established, with a racing school set up at Brands Hatch. The Half Litre Club, later to become the British Racing and Sports Car Club (BRSCC), ran many races throughout the 1950s and firmly established the venue as one of Britain&#x27;s top racing circuits.
The track continued to expand during 1953 and 1954, with the addition of Druids Bend by lengthening the circuit, a pit lane and spectator banks and reversing the racing direction to clockwise. While Formula III racing was unquestionably close and exciting, it did have its limitations and now the paying public wanted some variety and more powerful cars to watch. The change in direction of racing traffic resulted in the creation of &quot;Paddock Hill Bend&quot; a fast sweeping downhill right-hander. At the bottom the Paddock Hill, a quarter-mile extension to the circuit was added which took the competitors up the other side of the valley to a right-hand hairpin, which is called &quot;Druids Hill Bend&quot;. This new section re-joined the old track at another tricky corner, &quot;Bottom Bend&quot;, and the result was a circuit lengthened to .

The first race winner on the revised track was Stuart Lewis-Evans, at the wheel of a Cooper-Norton Mk.8, with a new name at the inaugural meeting. That name was N. G. Hill who was a &#x27;graduate&#x27; of the racing school.

As the season progressed larger engine machines began to appear starting with small and medium capacity sport cars, then Formula Libre machines. However, most races were still run for Formula 3 and 1954 saw the first of what was to become the traditional Boxing Day meeting down in Kent. A total of 15,000 spectators arrived at the Christmas meeting to watch a programme of seven races with the added attraction of ox-roasting and Stirling Moss.

It was Jim Russell&#x27;s year, for he dominated the Formula 3, winning the &quot;Autosport&quot; National Championship, as well as four of the meeting. Cooper T39s and Lotus Mk.9s dominated sports car racing while Archie Scott Brown had a stranglehold on the over 1,900 cc class, driving either the works Lister-Bristol or Louis Manduca&#x27;s Jaguar C-Type.

At the August Bank Holiday meeting spectators could avail themselves of the only permanent grandstand at a British motor sport circuit; it had been purchased second-hand from the defunct Northolt pony-trotting stadium and for the 1956 season, a telephone system was installed linking race control, the grandstand and the marshals&#x27; posts, while a modern hospital was opened at the circuit, complete with operating theatre.

As larger-capacity cars become more common, 500 cc racing began to decline, but the formula still gave close, exciting racing. The first year that public car race meetings were organised by other than the BRSCC was 1956 – in June, the 750 Motor Club joined forces with the Club Lotus to offer a mixture of races, including, for the first time at Brands, saloon cars. This was also the year the Brands grew up, running Formula One cars for the first time on 14 October. Initially, a long-distance race was planned, but in the end a 15-lap race was run which attracted four work entries from Connaught (B-Types for Archie Scott Brown, Les Leston, Jack Fairman and Stuart Lewis-Evans) opposed by privately entered Maserati 250Fs driven by Roy Salvadori and Bruce Halford and a selection of independents. Archie won from Lewis-Evans, setting a new lap record in the process at a speed of . Politics caused the cancellation of the Boxing Day meeting that year due to the Suez Crisis.

As a result of Suez affair, forecasts for 1957 season were gloomy, but the programme ran as planned, the two feature meeting of the year being run for the new Formula Two on Whit Sunday and August Bank Holiday. The year saw a continued diversification at BRSCC meetings with fewer 500cc events and more sport-racing machinery. The &quot;Kentish 100&quot; was the biggest event yet run at the circuit for Formula Two with two 42-lap heats and attracted a truly International field. Formula Two featured at other meetings but at the August Bank Holiday meeting, Formula 3 proved that it was not yet dead as it was run as the feature event for the &quot;Daily Telegraph Trophy&quot;.

Jim Clark made his Brands Hatch debut at the Boxing Day event, when he drove the Border Reivers-entered Lotus Elite into second place behind Colin Chapman. At the August Bank Holiday meeting in 1958, an 1,100cc sports car became the first to lap Brands Hatch in under a minute. Its creator had been unable to afford to purchase a Lotus, so had designed his own car; the car was called a Lola and its creator was Eric Broadley.

The highlight of the 1959 season was again the &quot;Kentish 100&quot;, with no less than 40 drivers (including 10 Grand Prix names) fighting for just 16 grid positions. Jack Brabham won both 42-lap heats driving the works Cooper-Climax. The feature race at the Boxing Day meeting was for Formula Junior, a new International Formula for single-seater racing cars using production engines up to 1,100 cc; works entries were received from Elva, Gemini, Lola, Cooper and Lotus. This new formula was to prove the death-knell of 500 cc racing.

===1960s===

In January 1960, Kent County Council gave planning permission for the extension of Brands Hatch – an extension which would double the length of the track offering a choice of long or short circuits. The new track used, all of this existing one with the extension of Kidney Bend; South Bank became a long, uphill 160° sweep out into the country and making the approach to Clearways very much faster. From South Bank there followed a long straight dipping into and out of the next valley to the right-hand Hawthorn Bend followed by Portobello Straight to Westfield Bend leading to the dip to Dingle Dell, Dingle Dell Corner and the difficult left-hand Stirling&#x27;s Bend. A short straight then brought the circuit back to Clearways at much higher speed than hitherto. John Hall said, &quot;For the first time ever, Britain will have a Grand Prix track within 20 miles of London.&#x27;&quot;

The new track was planned to be completed in time for the August Bank Holiday meeting and was ready for testing in June. The debut of the new track came in August as planned, with works entries from BRM, Cooper, Ferrari, and Lotus together with independents such Yeoman Credit Racing, Scuderia Eugenio Castellotti and Scuderia Centro Sud. Record traffic jams were reported on the A20, and the huge crowd saw the non-championship &quot;Silver City Trophy&quot; Formula One race won by Jack Brabham in the works Cooper-Climax by just 4.4 seconds from Graham Hill in the BRM P48, after the gearbox of Jim Clark&#x27;s Lotus expired after leading 22 laps of the 50-lap race. The fastest lap was set jointly by Clark and Brabham, in 1min 40.6sec, at a speed of .

Clark had his revenge a few weeks later when the circuit saw Formula Two cars performing in the &quot;Kentish 100&quot; with a hard-fought win over Dan Gurney; both were driving Lotus-Climaxes, Clark&#x27;s was a works car and Gurney&#x27;s a private entry.
Soon after, the track was sold to Grovewood Securities Ltd., and John Webb put in charge of Motor Circuit Developments to manage the circuit.

This was the year of the new 1.5-litre Formula One and on 3 June 1961, the &quot;Silver City Trophy&quot;, was contested over 76 laps of the GP Circuit by Grand Prix cars. Entries were received from Cooper, Lotus, BRM, UDT-Laystall and Yeoman Credit. Victory went to Stirling Moss driving the pale green UDT-Laystall Lotus 18/21 Climax from Jim Clark abroad the works Lotus 21 Climax and Tony Brooks driving the BRM P57 Climax. The 7 August meeting saw the Guards International Trophy for Intercontinental Formula cars. In effect the redundant 2.5-litre F1 cars from pre-1961. The race was a 76-lap affair over the GP Circuit; Jack Brabham won in the works Cooper T53-Climax from Jim Clark (works Lotus 18-Climax) and Graham Hill (BRM P57).

The following year 1962 did not see any major meetings at Brands, but on 1 October, the longest race staged so far took place. This was the &quot;Motor&quot;-sponsored Six-Hour Saloon race. The field of 35 entries included some foreign entrants and victory went to Mike Parkes and Jimmy Blumer driving a 3.8-litre Jaguar Mk II; the German pairing of Peter Lindner and Peter Nöcker in another Jaguar from a Mini-Cooper driven by John Alvy and Denny Hulme, a New Zealand mechanic employed by Jack Brabham.

The Club Circuit had six meeting during 1962, and witnessed the coming of Formula Junior. At the Easter Monday meeting, a Formula Junior race saw the lap record tumble to 55.6secs and the first-ever 80 mph lap (actual speed was ) by John Fenning, aboard a Lotus 20-Ford. The &#x27;Trio&#x27; meeting in July saw the end of an era when a 500 took the chequered flag for the last time with Mike Ledbrook, driving a Cooper-Norton Mark 8 in the 500 and 250cc race. At the Boxing Day meeting, Hulme won the Formula Junior race driving the prototype Brabham BT6-Ford, setting a new outright lap record of 54.8secs at an average speed of .

The severe winter of 1962/63 caused the cancellation of most sports, which resulted in empty television screens on occasions. The lack of sport to show virtually created Rallycross, for on 9 February a rallycross-type event was staged on the slushy Brands Hatch car parks in front of the TV cameras (not the Rallycross Circuit used in the 1980s and 1990s). The event had been quickly organised by Raymond Baxter of the BBC and the London Motor Club, and saw Timo Mäkinen win easily in the works Austin-Healey 3000.

The second &quot;Motor&quot;-sponsored Six-Hour saloon car race, was a round of the inaugural European Touring Car Challenge. It was run in appalling conditions on 6 July. The large crowd witness the favourite, a 7-litre Ford Galaxie driven by Dan Gurney and Jack Brabham, floundering in the wet and the Jaguar dominated the race. Victory went to Roy Salvadori and Denny Hulme from Peter Linder and Peter Nöcker after the winners on the road, Mike Salmon and Pete Sutcliffe being disqualified for engine irregularities. The &quot;Guards Trophy&quot; was run for sports cars and went to Roger Penske driving his Zerex Special, which was based on a Cooper F1 chassis.

The British Grand Prix came to Kent in 1964 and was to be shared with Silverstone in alternate years until 1986. Also the race was given the courtesy title &quot;European Grand Prix&quot; and the management rose to the occasion. The date was 11 July, a cool and dry day which saw Jim Clark at his best in the Lotus 25 winning by 2.8secs from Graham Hill in the BRM P261, who was followed home by John Surtees in the V8 Ferrari 158; fourth and one lap down was Jack Brabham driving a car bearing his own name. A further lap down in fifth place was Lorenzo Bandini in the V6 Ferrari with Phil Hill taking the final World Championship point in a Cooper. The race average was and Clark set the fastest lap at 1min 38.8secs (). The Motor Six Hours had its third and final running on 6 June (still a round of the ETCC), with victory going to the Alan Mann-entered Lotus-Cortinas of Sir John Whitmore/Peter Proctor and Henry Taylor/Peter Harper.

The 1964 season was the busiest so far for Brands Hatch, with 14 car race meeting alone; the British Automobile Racing Club (BARC) organised its first meeting in Kent, while the London Motor Car Club organised one in June. The year&#x27;s &quot;Guards Trophy&quot; went to Bruce McLaren driving for Cooper in a 3.9-litre Oldsmobile-powered sports car.

During the Lombank Trophy Race of 27 December 1965, held at Brands Hatch, driver George Reid Crossman was killed during the last race of the Formula 3 season. [race day program]

With the Grand Prix not due back at Brands until 1966, they promoted a non-championship Formula One race to be known as &quot;Race of Champions&quot; sponsored by &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. The race was run in two 40-lap heats with victory going to Jim Clark (Lotus 33), while his teammate Mike Spence, won the second and taking the overall victory. The first 100 mph lap was set by Clark in 1min 35.4secs. The longest race ever run at the Kentish Circuit took place on 22/23 May, this being the Guards 1000 consisting of two 500-mile races for production saloon cars. The overall winner was the works MG MGB of John Rhodes and Warwick Banks.

The British Grand Prix returned in 1966, the inaugural year of the 3-litre Formula One. The works Brabham-Repco BT19 were first and second in the hands of Jack Brabham and Denny Hulme; Brabham completed the 212-mile race in 2hrs 13mins 13.4secs () lapping everyone except Hulme in the process. Third was Graham Hill in the BRM P261 from Jim Clark (Lotus 33) with Jochen Rindt fifth in the Cooper-Maserati and in sixth position, a further lap adrift, was Bruce McLaren in the McLaren-Serenissima. The event was notable for the only F1 appearance of the Shannon SH 1 in the hands of Trevor Taylor which lasted just one lap. This was also the year that John Surtees won the &quot;Guards Trophy&quot; on August Bank Holiday Monday driving the 6-litre Lola T70. The &quot;Motor Show 200&quot; for Formula Two cars saw a young Austrian named Jochen Rindt win in the Roy Winkelmann-entered Brabham BT18.

The 1967 Race of Champions (still sponsored by &quot;Daily Mail&quot;) saw the first of two major victories by American cars at Brands when Dan Gurney brought the Eagle-Weslake T1G over the line first by 0.8 seconds from Lorenzo Bandin&#x27;s Ferrari 312/67. So good was the public&#x27;s response to the race (run in two 10-lap heats and a 40-lap final) that John Webb decided to make the race an annual event. The other great American victory was to come when the be-winged 7-litre Chaparral 2F-Chevrolet driven by Phil Hill and Mike Spence won the &quot;BOAC 500&quot; run over 211 laps of the Grand Prix Circuit at an average speed of , from the Ferrari 330-P4 of Chris Amon and Jackie Stewart. These two had lapped the rest of the field twice, third place going to the Jo Siffert/Bruce McLaren Porsche 910. The year saw many firsts; in July, Tetsu Ikuzawa became the first Japanese ever to win a race in Britain, the first Mini Festival was run at Whitsun and the Mini-Seven Club ran the first ever all-saloon car meeting in February. But the biggest &#x27;first &#x27;was the arrival of Formula Ford which was to become the providing ground and starting place for so many drivers. The first Formula Ford race was run on 7 July and was won by Roy Allan in a Lotus 51.

1968 proved to be a busy season, with no less than five International meetings; the first was the Race of Champions followed by the BOAC 500, the British Grand Prix, the Guards Trophy, and the Motor Show 200. The former race gave the McLaren marque its maiden Formula One victory when Bruce, driving his own car, led home the field ahead of Pedro Rodríguez in the BRM P133 and his new team-mate, Denny Hulme. Sponsorship on racing cars was just beginning and a television executive was distressed by the &#x27;sailor man&#x27; on the side of the Gold Leaf Team Lotus and threatened to withdraw television coverage if the offering item was not obscured, so Graham Hill was black-flagged to have the decal covered!

It was March 1968 at a minor club meeting when 17-year-old rider Barry Sheene lined up on the starting grid, on a works 125cc Bultaco, for his first race. It was an impressive debut by anyone&#x27;s standards. Sheene had worked his way up to second place and threatening the leader, Mike Lewis, when the bike seized and spat its rider off over the handlebars. A rostrum position in the day&#x27;s 250cc race was a great achievement, but an even better was not very far away. Just one week later, and again at Brands, Sheene took his first race win, and he did it is style by an incredible 12 seconds. And the best was yet to come, for he dominated a field of 350cc machines, riding special 250cc Bultaco (with an enlarged 280cc capacity).

The Manufacturers&#x27; World Championship came to Brands in early 1968, followed by the &quot;BOAC 500&quot; on 7 April. The winner was the Ford GT40 Mk.1 of Jacky Ickx and Brian Redman from the Porsche 908 of Gerhard Mitter and Ludovico Scarfiotti, these two being the only cars to complete the full race distance of 218-laps. Two laps further down in third was another 907 driven by Vic Elford and Jochen Neerpasch and fourth place went to another GT40, driven by Paul Hawkins and David Hobbs.

Three months later came the British Grand Prix on 20 July, won by Jo &quot;Seppi&quot; Siffert. Siffert&#x27;s victory was noteworthy in that he won in a Lotus 49B which was delivered new to the circuit on the first morning of the meeting. It was completed in the paddock and was entered by the Walker-Durlacher team – a private entrant winning a Grand Prix. In second place just 4.4 secs behind was Chris Amon (Ferrari), with his teammate Jacky Ickx third. Fourth was Denny Hulme in a McLaren M7A, from Surtees in the Honda RA300 one lap down, and Jackie Stewart a further lap down in the Matra-Ford MS80.

Easter Monday 1969 saw another brainchild of John Webb and the BRSCC&#x27;s Competitions Director Nick Syreett come to fruition. This was Formula 5000 which was based upon the American Formula A, the cars being single-seater chassis powered by American V8 and V6 stock-block engines of up to 5-litre capacity. The need for the new formula was caused by the escalating costs of Formula Three, Formula Two and the decreasing number of non-championship Formula One events as more and more countries demanded a Grand Prix. The winner of the first Formula 5000 race was Peter Gethin driving a McLaren M10A with Chevrolet power.

Indianapolis-style single-car qualifying was introduced for the 1969 Race of Champions, but it simply did not catch on – perhaps it did not have the glamour of the Indy 500; Jackie Stewart won the race in the Matra MS80 owned by Ken Tyrrell and went on to win his first World Championship with it.

The &quot;BOAC 500&quot; was once again the British round of the Manufacturers&#x27; World Championship and was a Porsche benefit, 908s taking the first three places, the winners being Jo Siffert and Brian Redman; the second place car of Vic Elford and Richard Attwood was two laps behind, with Gerhard Mitter and Udo Schütz third.

===1970s===

The International race calendar for 1970 opened with the Race of Champions. March Engineering made its Formula One-winning debut when Jackie Stewart won driving Ken Tyrrell&#x27;s March-Cosworth 701.

The British Grand Prix returned to Brands Hatch on 19 July and saw victory go to Jochen Rindt by less than 33 seconds from Jack Brabham, who had run out of fuel. The Austrian driver of the Lotus was then disqualified following a protest over an aerofoil, but was reinstated before the evening was out. Third place went to Denny Hulme in the McLaren from the Ferrari of Clay Regazzoni; a lap down in fifth spot with the March of Chris Amon with Graham Hill sixth in the other Lotus. Rindt&#x27;s winning speed was .

Although the World Championship sports race was now &quot;BOAC 1000&quot;, but measured in kilometres, not miles, it was another Porsche benefit, the fearsome 917s taking the first three places from a 908; the first car home was the Pedro Rodríguez/Leo Kinnunen car from Vic Elford/Denny Hulme and Richard Attwood/Hans Herrmann. The 908 was driven by Gijs van Lennep and Hans Laine. The race was run over 235 laps at a speed of .

By 1971, the ownership of Brands Hatch was in the hands of Motor Circuit Developments (MCD), which saw the arrival of another MCD-inspired single-seater formula in the shape of Formula Atlantic. The &quot;BOAC 1000&quot; saw Alfa Romeo take their first major success in 20 years, with the chequered flag being taken by the 33TT3 of Andrea de Adamich and Henri Pescarolo, who completed the 235 laps at a speed of . They were followed home by the Ferrari 312PB of Jacky Ickx and Clay Regazzoni, with the Porsche 917 of Jo Siffert and Derek Bell a further three laps down in third.

Motor Racing is a dangerous game and there had been some fatalities at Brands including the deaths of George Crossman, Tony Flory and Stuart Duncan in the mid-60s. But in October 1971, the season drew to its close with the death of a major driver. Jo Siffert died in an accident in the &quot;Rothmans World Championship Victory Race&quot;. This non-championship event for Formula One and Formula 5000 cars was arranged to mark Jackie Stewart and Ken Tyrrell&#x27;s joint World Championships. The race was 40 laps in length; &#x27;Seppi&#x27; lost control of his BRM P160 on lap 15, hit the bank at Hawthorn Hill, the car was engulfed in flames and he was asphyxiated before he could be extricated. The circuit came under a great deal of criticism, and it was agreed that a three-year programme of major safety modifications around the track would be commenced before the start of the 1972 season.

The 1972 season was a particularly busy one, with Formula One visiting twice for the Race of Champions on 19 March sponsored by &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and the John Player-sponsored British Grand Prix on 15 July (bearing the title European Grand Prix), while the BOAC 1000 was the British round of the World Championship of Makes. On 16 April, what was to be the last BOAC 1000 resulted in a complete Italian benefit race with Ferrari and Alfa Romeo filling the first six places. The 235-lap race was won by Mario Andretti and Jacky Ickx in a Ferrari 312PB, with the average race speed of , from Tim Schenken and Ronnie Peterson, a lap down in a similar car. The first Alfa home completed the podium, was the 33TT3 of Rolf Stommelen and Peter Revson. And so to July, 76-laps of the Grand Prix Circuit adds up to just a few hundred yards over 200 miles which Emerson Fittipaldi completed in 1hr 47:50.2secs (), driving the John Player Special Lotus-Cosworth 72D, from Jackie Stewart (Tyrrell-Cosworth 003), Peter Revson in the Team Yardley McLaren-Cosworth M19A, Chris Amon in the Matra-Simca MS120C, Denny Hulme Team Yardley McLaren-Cosworth M19C, with Arturo Merzario taking the last point in the Ferrari 312B2.

The following year, 1973, was less hectic; the BOAC 1000 was cancelled when the date offered by the FIA was unsuitable, and the year had an unfortunate Race of Champions. Peter Gethin driving a Formula 5000 Chevron-Chevrolet B24 beat the Formula One cars and James Hunt made his F1 debut in Hesketh Racing&#x27;s March 731. Before the start of that season, £50,000 was spent upon a new grandstand adjoining the Grovewood Suite, while opening seating and new pits were built to comply with FIA requirements. There were also improvements made between Westfields and Stirlings.
It rained again during the Race of Champions in 1974, and the more nimble Formula One cars showed their heels to the Formula 5000 contingent; the winner was Jacky Ickx driving a Lotus-Ford 72E. The Grand Prix circus returned to Brands for a race on 20 July, and the RAC (who organised the race) came in for censure from the FIA for allowing the pit lane to be blocked during the race, thus preventing Niki Lauda from rejoining at the end to claim fifth place, which he was awarded on appeal. The winner was Jody Scheckter in a Tyrrell-Cosworth 007 who covered the race at an average pace of , from Emerson Fittipaldi (McLaren-Cosworth M23B), Jacky Ickx (Lotus-Cosworth 72E), Clay Regazzoni and Niki Lauda (Ferrari 312B3) with Carlos Reutemann (Brabham-Cosworth BT44) in sixth.

The BOAC 1000 had become the &quot;British Airways 1000&quot; and was dominated by the works Matra-Simca MS670C which finish first and second; first home were the Jean-Pierres – Jarier and Beltoise – with Henri Pescarolo and Gérard Larrousse second. Third, no less than 11 laps down, was the Gulf-Ford GR7 of Derek Bell and David Hobbs.

The winter of 1974/5 was mild, which was fortunate, allowing both tracks to be resurfaced in their entirety and completed in time for the opening event of 1975.

Tom Pryce had made a name for himself at Brands, driving Formula Ford and Formula F100 cars. He came to the &quot;British Airways/Daily Mail Race of Champions&quot; on 16 March as a works driver for the UOP Shadow. He drove the DN5; Pryce carved his way through the field, closing upon Jody Scheckter&#x27;s Tyrrell-Cosworth when Scheckter&#x27;s engine blew. This was Pryce&#x27;s first and only Formula One win - he died a little over two years later during the 1977 South African Grand Prix.
It was again Grand Prix year in 1976, and notwithstanding the money already spent, another £100,000 was expended on the track and safety work; the major change was a realignment of Paddock Bend, which resulted in a slight shortening of the circuit to . Bottom Straight was also realigned making it straighter; this was all done to expand the cramped pit facilities. It was at this time that name changes occurred; Pilgrims became Hailwood Hill, Bottom Bend became Graham Hill Bend and Bottom Straight became Cooper Straight. The Grand Prix took place on 18 July and was somewhat controversial. Following a first-lap accident the race was stopped. This year&#x27;s Race of Champions winner and national hero, James Hunt was involved so he took over the spare McLaren M23D, which he won, but was later disqualified by the FIA, as it was deemed that he had not completed the first lap. Ferrari&#x27;s Niki Lauda was declared the winner from the Tyrrell of Jody Scheckter and John Watson&#x27;s Penske PC3. Tom Pryce brought the Shadow home in fourth.
On 25 September, the second British round of the World Championship of Makes arrived for the &quot;Brands Hatch Six-Hours&quot;; it was run in a deluge which caused it to be stopped for an hour and it was eventually run over 103 laps – – which Jacky Ickx and Jochen Mass won at driving a Porsche 935/2 Turbo. The race totally dominated by the Stuttgart marque, the first five places going to Porsche 935 Turbos – a 934 Turbo was sixth with a Carrera seventh. A little relief came with the eighth-place BMW 320i, two more Porsches rounded out the first ten. In November, Brands Hatch took over the running of the annual Formula Ford Festival (which it still holds to this day) from Snetterton. This was won by Irishman Derek Daly in a Hawke DL17.

1977 was a quiet year, with James Hunt retaining his Race of Champions crown for McLaren. The event was not held in 1978, but this was a Grand Prix year. It was also a year to remember for it was also Indy year. Controversy again loomed at the Grand Prix, but trouble was averted; Niki Lauda had won the Swedish Grand Prix driving the Brabham BT46B &#x27;fan car&#x27;, but before it arrived in Kent, the car was banned by the FIA. Despite this, Lauda still finished second, in the conventional Brabham-Alfa Romeo BT46, behind the Ferrari 312T3 of Carlos Reutemann, with the other Brabham of John Watson in third. Fourth went to Patrick Depailler in a Tyrrell 008, with Hans-Joachim Stuck fifth in a Shadow DN9 and Patrick Tambay sixth, in a McLaren M26.

12 March 1978, saw the return of the European Touring Car Championship (ETCC) to Brands Hatch. Of the four BMW&#x27;s entered, two did not even make the start. The other two were a Luigi car, entered by BMW Italia for Tom Walkinshaw and Umberto Grano, and the Jolly Club pairing of Carlo Facetti and Martino Finotto. The latter were the quickest car, but hopeless pit stops, saw the Luigi car took over the lead on lap 117 (out of 120) and take the spoils. Third was the VW Motorsport Scirocco of Richard Lloyd and Anton Stocker, as well as their class victory.

Important through the Grand Prix is, the high-spot of the 1978 season at Brands Hatch and Silverstone was the coming of the USAC Champ Car. John Webb had gone to America to witness the organisation of Indy Racing at first hand and as a result of that visit two rounds of the USAC National Championship were in England. The Silverstone race was wet and the Brands one dry. The costs were £500,000 but, unfortunately the race did not capture the imagination of the British enthusiasts, despite the appearance of such legendary names as A. J. Foyt, Rick Mears, Tom Sneva and Danny Ongais. The Brands race was run on the Club Circuit which was then renamed the Indy Circuit in honour of the guests. The race was won by Mears (Gould Penske), from Sneva with the fastest lap going to Ongais at (41.4 secs.) – a new outright record.

1979 saw the return of the &quot;Race of Champions&quot; on 15 April, however the contained only seven regular cars that completed in the World Championship, while the rest of field was made up of entrants from the British Formula One Championship. The spoils of victory went to way of Ferrari, with Gilles Villeneuve winning in a modified 312T3. Second was Nelson Piquet in a Brabham-Alfa Romeo BT48, from Mario Andretti&#x27;s Lotus-Cosworth 79 in third. Also, this year the World Championship of Makes arrived for again the &quot;Brands Hatch Six-Hours&quot; with victory going to Reinhold Joest and Volkert Merl in their Joest Racing Porsche 908/3 Turbo.

The Jolly Club pairing of Carlo Facetti and Martino Finotto, were out of luck again, when the ETCC landed in Kent for the Brands Hatch 500 km. They lost the lead of the race they had comfortably headed for 100 of a scheduled 120 laps, when the gear lever broke. Once again the rival Luigi team were on hand to take a well deserved win, this time being driven the Belgian team of Raymond van Hove, Jean Xhenceval and Pierre Dieudonné with the familiar BMW CSL.

===1980s===

The circuit did not see a Race of Champions in 1980 – the Formula One calendar was now so full that the teams could not afford a week to run in a non-championship race and henceforward, British fans would have only one opportunity to see current F1 cars in action per year. A little piece of motor racing history was written when Desiré Wilson became the first woman to win a Formula One race when she won a round of the British Formula One Championship, driving a Wolf WR4.

27 April 1980, saw the final ETCC race at Brands Hatch, literally saw Harald Neger blow away victory in his Racing Corporation Vienna BMW 635CSi. The Austrian stormed through the field in lap one, following a bad practice, but the engine had been over-revved. Now the Eggenberger Motorsport BMW 320s took over, and after Hans-Jürg Dürig had to retire with a broken seat, Siegfried Müller Jr. and Helmut Kelleners won the race, with an older BMW 3.0 CSi second with the Belgian pairing of Michel Delcourt and Jean-Marie Baert.

Ayrton Senna da Silva&#x27;s European car racing debut, 1 March 1981 was impressive, but not sensational, finishing fifth during a &quot;P&amp;O Ferries&quot; Championship (Formula Ford 1600), driving a Van Diemen RF80. A fortnight later competing in the &quot;Townsend Thoresen&quot; Championship, Senna totally dominated the race despite a very heavy downpour, winning by 9.4 seconds during 15-lap race on the Indy Circuit. This time driving a Van Diemen RF81. Few knew beforehand that this race would make history – Senna first win.

On 16 March, the &quot;Brands Hatch Six-Hours&quot; was run and saw a healthy invasion of Italian cars; Lancia Beta Monte Carlos in the hands of Riccardo Patrese and Walter Röhrl, with Michele Alboreto and Eddie Cheever taking the two places for Lancia Corse, the winning car being the only one to complete the full race distance of 147 laps, at . In third spot a further lap down was the De Cadenet LM of Alain de Cadenet and Desiré Wilson. This was Alan Jones&#x27;s World Championship year and on his way to the crown he won the &quot;Marlboro British Grand Prix&quot; on 13 July, in a Williams-Cosworth FW07B from Nelson Piquet and Carlos Reutemann. Piquet&#x27;s Brabham-Cosworth BT49 split the two Williams, Derek Daly and Jean-Pierre Jarier filling the next spots for Tyrrell, with a young Frenchman, Alain Prost for McLaren in sixth. There was a slimmed down calendar in 1981 with but one International, the emphasis being on top-class national racing.

By contrast 1982 was extremely busy. The highlight of the year was the &quot;Marlboro&quot; British Grand Prix and it was voted the best of the year by the members of the Formula One Constructors Association. Once again the Grand Prix was run over (76 laps), the winner being Niki Lauda in the McLaren-Cosworth MP4/1B from the Ferrari 126C2 of Didier Pironi and Patrick Tambay. The winner speed was .

It was a non-Grand Prix year at Brands in 1983, but the &quot;Marlboro Daily Mail Race of Champions&quot; was successfully staged on 10 April, notwithstanding the fact it was only a week before the French Grand Prix and clashed with a tyre test at Paul Ricard. It was also the last non-championship F1 race to be held in the sport&#x27;s history. It was won by the reigning world champion Keke Rosberg in the Williams FW08, who narrowly beat Danny Sullivan in his Tyrrell 011. Meanwhile, former world champion Alan Jones finished third in his last drive for Arrows. To bring some real excitement, noise and spectacle back into British motor racing, the BRSCC invented Thundersports. The new series had its debut on Easter Monday and the country&#x27;s first major sport car race since the mid-1970s was a resounding success. Then, the year turned into a Grand Prix one after all; following the cancellation of the proposed New York Grand Prix, John Webb lobbied FISA in company with the RAC MSA and was granted the opportunity to run the Grand Prix d’Europe on 25 September, thus giving Britain its second Grand Prix that season.

The full circus arrived in Kent and Elio de Angelis placed his Lotus-Renault 94T on pole position; the race was 76 laps/199 miles long which Nelson Piquet in the Brabham-BMW BT52B won at . Alain Prost followed him home 6 sec later in the Renault RE40 with Nigel Mansell in the second Lotus in third.

In 1984, Brands become the first British circuit to hold Grands Prix in three consecutive years since the 1950s. This was officially the year for Kent to host the British Grand Prix but it was fraught with politics as Tyrrell was adjudged by the sport&#x27;s governing body to have infringed the rules at the Canadian Grand Prix and was excluded from the remainder of the season. A court injunction ensured that the cars started their home race, but Stefan Bellof and Stefan Johansson qualified the cars on the back row of the grid, the former finishing 11th but Johansson being eliminated in a first-lap accident. The win went to Niki Lauda, driving a McLaren-TAG MP4/2. Second was Derek Warwick in the Renault RE50 and Ayrton Senna driving the Toleman-Hart TG184 into third place. Lauda&#x27;s winning speed was .

1984 saw the return of the European Formula Two Championship, the first visit since Jochen Rindt&#x27;s win in 1967, which was also the last race for this category before being replaced by Formula 3000. 23 September turned out to be very wet, with the original race lasting only 16 laps being stopped due to heavy rain. The remaining 31 laps were run later in the day, with Philippe Streiff in an AGS-BMW winning on aggregate from the Martini-BMW of Michel Ferté and Roberto Moreno in a Ralt-Honda.

On 22 September 1985, Brands Hatch hosted the second British round of the World Endurance Championship in the form of the &quot;Brands Hatch 1000km&quot;. It was to be another Porsche benefit, which the Stuttgart cars taking a 1–2 finish; first was the 962C of Derek Bell and Hans-Joachim Stuck (who jointly took the driver&#x27;s title) with the identical car of Jacky Ickx and Jochen Mass second – these two were the only cars to covered the full race distance of 238 laps. Five laps down in third was the Lancia-Martini LC2 of Bob Wollek/Mauro Baldi/Andrea de Cesaris.
A fortnight later, for the second time in three years, Britain staged two Grands Prix in one season; in July, the British Grand Prix was held at Silverstone, but the loss of a race in New York City made a date available in Europe towards the end of the season. The management team led by John Webb made a bid for it and won the right to host the Grand Prix d’Europe on 6 October. It was fitting that Nigel Mansell should score his first Grand Prix on this occasion, at the wheel of a Williams-Honda FW10B, completing the 75 laps of the Grand Prix Circuit, at a speed of from Ayrton Senna&#x27;s Lotus-Renault 97T and teammate Keke Rosberg in the other Williams. Alain Prost brought his McLaren-TAG MP4/2B home in fourth, to win become the 1985 World Drivers&#x27; Championship.

In October that year, rumours started to circulate regarding the future of Motor Circuit Developments; at the time the property of Eagle Star Holdings which had been sold to British American Tobacco. This caused some alarm as to the future of the circuits. Thanks to the efforts of John Webb, John Foulston, the then Chairman of Atlantic Computers plc and a staunch enthusiast of motorsport, secured the future of Brands Hatch, Oulton Park and Snetterton for &#x27;the foreseeable future&#x27; in a £5.25m bid. Early in 1987, he added Cadwell Park to his fold, which came to be known as the Brands Hatch Leisure Group.

The Kentish Circuit was to host the Grand Prix only once more and that was on 13 July 1986 (making five years in a row), after which it was to be run continually at Silverstone. The reason for this was that the international motorsports governing body at the time, FISA, had instituted a policy of long-term contracts with circuits. Brands Hatch was perceived as a poorer facility, and it did have very little run-off and room to expand, something Silverstone as a former World War II airfield had in acres. Silverstone and the BRDC had signed a seven-year contract with Formula 1 and FISA at some point in 1986, to run from 1987 to 1993. The 1986 race saw Piquet take pole at , the fastest lap ever recorded at Brands up to that point, and 22mph faster than the pole time set for the 1976 race on the same layout. Race day saw a major first lap accident at Paddock Bend where Jacques Laffite (Ligier-Renault JS27) broke both legs after going head-on into the wall on the right side of the track, which spelt the end of his F1 career and Brands Hatch as a Formula One circuit. It was his 176th Grand Prix, equalling Graham Hill&#x27;s record. Nigel Mansell&#x27;s Williams-Honda FW11 had rolled to a stop shortly after the start but, as a result of the race stoppage, he was able to use the spare Williams (which was set up for his teammate Nelson Piquet) and he took the restart, eventually winning from Piquet. Mansell won at a speed of . Alain Prost was third in his McLaren-TAG MP4/2C with fourth going to René Arnoux in the other Ligier, with the Tyrrells of Martin Brundle and Philippe Streiff taking the final points.

A week later, the World Sports Car Championship contingent arrived in Kent for the &quot;Brands Hatch 1000&quot;. The first three places were taken by Porsche 956s, the winning car of Bob Wollek and Mauro Baldi (Richard Lloyd Racing Porsche 956 GTi) being the only car to complete the 238 laps, at a speed of . Second home was Joest Racing&#x27;s 956 of Derek Bell, Hans-Joachim Stuck and Klaus Ludwig, with the Brun Motorsport 956 of Thierry Boutsen and Frank Jelinski third, four and five laps down respectively.

Almost exactly a year later, Brands echoed to the sound of the sports car, although the championship was now called, World Sports-Prototype Championship for Teams (WSPC) and the race was the &quot;Shell Gemini 1000&quot; run on 26 July 1987. This was the year of the &#x27;big cats&#x27;, with the Tom Walkinshaw Racing run Silk Cut Jaguar team and their XJR-8 of Raul Boesel and John Nielsen, who won at an average speed of with the Richard Lloyd Racing entered Porsche 962GTi of Mauro Baldi and Johnny Dumfries second, these two being the only cars to run the full distance. Third, no less than nine laps adrift, was Jan Lammers and John Watson&#x27;s XJR-8.
If the Grand Prix was lost to Brands, large-capacity single-seater racing cars were not entirely so and on 23 August, the Intercontinental F3000 Championship was run, as the early years of the championship, the cars were all Cosworth-powered Lolas, Marches and Ralts. The race was over 45 laps, making a distance of , which Julian Bailey won at in a Lola T87/50. In second place was Maurício Gugelmin, followed by Roberto Moreno, both Ralt RT21-mounted, with Stefano Modena and Yannick Dalmas.
The big sports cars returned again on 24 July 1988. The &#x27;big cats&#x27; were victorious again, this time using Jaguar XJR-9s, driven by Martin Brundle, John Nielsen and Andy Wallace. They were the only car to complete the full race distance, averaging . in second place was the Joest Racing Porsche 962C of Bob Wollek and Klaus Ludwig, with third going to Mauro Baldi and Jean-Louis Schlesser in their Sauber-Mercedes C9 .

A little under a month later, the F3000 brigade arrived. Practice was marred by a series of worrying accidents, but Johnny Herbert took pole position with his teammate Martin Donnelly alongside in the Eddie Jordan Racing Reynard 88Ds. In the race, they were in a class of their own with Herbert taking a huge lead as the race was stopped following an accident at Paddock Bend. At the restart Donnelly moved into the lead from Pierluigi Martini, but Gregor Foitek and Herbert touched, resulting in a bad accident and a second stoppage. Herbert was seriously injured, suffering major leg fractures. At the third start, Donnelly went away to score a debut win in the Formula, at , from Martini in a March 88B and Mark Blundell in a Lola T88/50.

On 23 July 1989, the WSPC contenders arrived in Kent, for the &quot;Brands Hatch Trophy&quot;. Following changes to championship rules, the race distance was down to 115 laps of the Grand Prix Circuit, making a race distance of , which was won by the Sauber-Mercedes C9 of Mauro Baldi and Kenny Acheson, at an average speed of . into second place came a Porsche 962C contested by Bob Wollek and Frank Jelinski, from the second Sauber of Jean-Louis Schlesser and Jochen Mass. The British cars were placed fourth and fifth, the Aston Martin AMR1 of David Leslie and Brian Redman beating the Jaguar XJR-11 of Jan Lammers and Patrick Tambay.

A month later, on 20 August, the International F3000 Championship was held over 48 laps of the Grand Prix Circuit, which Martin Donnelly won the second successive year in a Reynard 89D at . Second was teammate Jean Alesi, followed by Érik Comas in a Lola T89/50.

====Brands Hatch Racing====
Brands Hatch Racing was a Formula One entrant in 1980. They competed in the 1980 British Grand Prix with driver Desiré Wilson, Williams as manufacturer of the Williams FW07 with a Ford engine and Goodyear tyres. As car number 43 its qualifying position of 27th was not good enough to qualify for the race. In the following years, they were involved in sports car racing between 1980 and 1984:
===1990s===

Exactly a year later on 19 August 1990, the Formula 3000 cars were back to contest the eighth round of the Championship. Allan McNish won the race at in a Lola T90/50 with a Mugen engine, followed by Damon Hill in an identical car, with a Cosworth power plant. The final step of the podium was taken by Marco Apicella. The Sports Prototypes did not return to Kent in 1990, going to Donington Park instead.
The 1991 International Formula 3000 Championship returned on 18 August for another race around the Grand Prix Circuit. Reynard 91Ds filled the first three places, first home being Emanuele Naspetti at , driving with Cosworth-power, from Alex Zanardi in a similar car. Third went to Christian Fittipaldi in the Pacific Racing Mugen entered Reynard.

International motor racing returned for the 1996 BPR 4 Hours of Brands Hatch, when a round of the BPR Global GT Series for GT1 and GT2 sports cars was staged there on 8 September. The Porsche 911 GT1 of Hans-Joachim Stuck and Thierry Boutsen led home three McLaren F1 GTRs driven by Andy Wallace/Olivier Grouillard, Pierre-Henri Raphanel/Lindsay Owen-Jones and John Nielsen/Thomas Bscher.

In October 1999, Octagon, a part of Interpublic, commenced negotiations for the purchase of Brands Hatch Leisure Group. In December an agreement was reached, with control of Brands Hatch, Cadwell Park, Oulton Park and Snetterton passing to the new owners for £120m. Octagon obtained the right from the FIA to run the British Grand Prix from 2002 and announced the intention of rebuilding the Grand Prix Circuit, whilst at the same time negotiating with the British Racing Drivers Club to run the Grand Prix at Silverstone. An agreement was reached which ensured that the Grand Prix will be run at Silverstone for 15 years. Because of this agreement, the layout of the Grand Prix Circuit at Brands Hatch stayed nearly identical to before.

===2000s===
The circuit has a curfew of 18:30 due to a housing estate built near to Clearways bend. Race engines cannot be started until after 08:30 and must be turned off by 18:30. Despite this, Brands Hatch holds race meetings on almost every weekend during the motorsport season, ranging from small club series to major international races attracting up to 50,000 spectators.

After Octagon failed to obtain the necessary planning permission and subsequent leasing of the British Grand Prix to Silverstone, this left Brands Hatch without any top-line single-seater racing. However, high-profile single-seater did return in 2003, when the &quot;London Champ Car Trophy&quot;, a round of the CART Series, was held at the circuit. Despite attracting around 40,000 spectators to see Sébastien Bourdais (Newman/Haas Racing Lola) win, the race was not retained for subsequent seasons.
Over the winter of 2002/03, the Dingle Dell chicane was reprofiled and removed. The motorcycle racing governing body (FIM) requested the change ahead of the World Superbike Championship visit in August, but it also allowed the installation of extra gravel traps should the CART be switched from the Indy Circuit to the Grand Prix configuration. Shortly after completion, Barry Sheene died, and the new complex was renamed the Sheene Curve.

One of the biggest developments in the circuit&#x27;s history occurred in January 2004, when Jonathan Palmer&#x27;s MotorSport Vision company completed the purchase of Brands Hatch and the other Octagon venues (Cadwell Park, Oulton Park, and Snetterton). Palmer immediately implemented a programme of improvements to the venue, designed to heighten customer experiences both for spectators and competitors.

25 September 2005, the inaugural A1 Grand Prix of Nations was held at Brands Hatch. A1 Grand Prix was a single-seater one-make series where the drivers represented their nation, as opposed themselves or a team. The first race, an 18-lap Sprint saw Nelson Piquet Jr. lead flag-to-flag to win for A1 Team Brazil, ahead of Alexandre Premat (France) and Matt Halliday (New Zealand). The 35-lap Main race also went to Piquet Jr. with Australia&#x27;s Will Power second, and Mexico&#x27;s Salvador Durán third.

On a rainy and cold 21 May 2006, SEAT and Chevrolet shared the honours on the first visit of the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC)&#x27;s to Brands Hatch. Despite the weather, a good crowd came to the circuit to witness two races that were both run on soaked asphalt. SEAT Sport secured a 1–2–3 finish with Yvan Muller taking the flag ahead of teammates Peter Terting and James Thompson. Alain Menu was welcomed back to the pits as a hero by the RML garage at the end of Race 2 as he achieved the team&#x27;s first WTCC victory. SEAT&#x27;s Rickard Rydell finished second on the podium with fellow SEAT driver, Thompson obtaining another third place of the day.
2006, also saw the first visit of the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM) on 2 July. In the warm English sunshine, 21,500 fans witnessed Tom Kristensen, who seemed to be a sure winner in his Audi A4, but with 16 of the 85 laps to go, his car shot off with problems. The winner was the Swede, Mattias Ekström. Second and third were Jamie Green and Bernd Schneider.

The A1 Grand Prix cars returned on 29 April 2007, for the finale of their 2006/07 season. This time Great Britain was victorious in the Sprint with Robbie Kerr driving, with Nico Hülkenberg (Germany) and Enrico Toccacelo (Italy) third. Hülkenberg reversed the result in the Main to win from Kerr with Toccacelo again in third.

A perfect pit stop strategy, great overtaking manoeuvres and a vast experience enabled Bernd Schneider (AMG-Mercedes C-Klasse) to take the DTM victory when the series visited in 2007. Only 0.543 seconds behind was Martin Tomczyk, with third going to Mattias Ekström, both driving Audi Team Abt Sportsline entered A4s.

23 September 2007, saw Alain Menu claim victory in Race 1, after not putting a wheel wrong all race. The Chevrolet driver came under pressure from N.Technology&#x27;s James Thompson on numerous occasion but the Alfa Romeo never got close enough to overtake, Third across the line was Colin Turkington&#x27;s BMW. Race 2 saw Andy Priaulx take his first ever win at the wheel of a touring car at Brands. The man from Guernsey lead home Félix Porteiro (BMW) and Robert Huff (Chevrolet).

Brands Hatch held the finale again on 4 May 2008. Like the previous season, Robbie Kerr won the Sprint race the American, Jonathan Summerton and Ireland&#x27;s Adam Carroll taking the next two steps on the podium. The Main race went to way of Team India&#x27;s Narain Karthikeyan from Kerr in second and Neel Jani (Switzerland) third.
WTCC witnessed BMW and Chevrolet share the glory when they returned to Kent for the WTCC Race of UK, 27 July 2008. Jörg Müller of BMW Team Germany and Alain Menu for Chevrolet claimed a win each. The German inherited his win when Robert Huff (Chevrolet) went off while leading. As for Menu, this was his third WTCC win at Brands in three years, closely followed home by Félix Porteiro and Alex Zanardi in third.

31 August 2008 saw unstable weather conditions, and Timo Scheider (Audi Team Abt Sportline) defended an extremely narrow lead against the Mercedes driver, Paul di Resta. In front of a weekend crowd of 26,800, Mattias Ekström recovered with a drive to finish third.

Brands Hatch has held sixteen Superbike World Championship, since 1993, when Giancarlo Falappa&#x27;s double victory in the pouring rain, including two rounds in 2000. Brands has featured in many of the pivotal moments in the championship&#x27;s history, including Carl Fogarty&#x27;s double victory in 1995, and more recently James Toseland&#x27;s double in 2007, not forgetting Shane &#x27;Shakey&#x27; Bryne&#x27;s double as a &quot;wildcard&quot; entrant back in 2003. The last visit in 2008 saw Ryuichi Kiyonari take his first two World Superbike wins of his career, although this was overshadowed by the death of Craig Jones in a supporting World Supersports race. Unfortunately, the circuit owners, MotorSport Vision and the championship organisers FG Sport decided not to return to Brands Hatch in 2009, over a dispute about an increased sanctioning fee.

Back in 1999, the event was dominated by Fogarty&#x27;s fan, his following was enormous. He would attract a record crowd of 100,000 spectators to Brands (unofficially, the figure was nearer 120,000). The grandstands were red with Ducati jackets and shirts. The flags were covered with the menacing image of the &quot;Foggy Eyes&quot; and Union Jacks. Despite all this support the American, Colin Edwards (Honda) taking the double.

2009 saw the last A1 Grand Prix, and this was held at Brands Hatch, following the cancellation of the final round in Mexico. Adam Carroll won both races for A1 Team Ireland. The Sprint podium was completed by Team India&#x27;s Narain Karthikeyan and Mexico&#x27;s Salvador Durán, with Holland&#x27;s Jeroen Bleekemolen and Swiss driver Neel Jani doing the same in the Main race.

Once again Alain Menu proved to be one of the men to beat when the WTCC revisited Brands in 2009; the Swiss overtook his teammate Robert Huff in the early stages of Race 1 and added another victory to his impressive tally on this track. Huff finished second from an aggressive Andy Priaulx (BMW). Augusto Farfus (BMW) turned pole into victory in Race 2, with teammate Jörg Müller following him home in second. Gabriele Tarquini (SEAT) won a tough fight for third with Priaulx and Rickard Rydell (SEAT).

DTM returned to Kent for their annual visit on 6 September 2009. Paul di Resta delivered a timely victory for HWA Team and Mercedes-Benz, after he made a good start from pole position, as he fended off the first corner challenge of Timp Scheider&#x27;s Audi, to claim Mercedes&#x27; 150th DTM win.

===2010s===

On 18 July 2010, Yvan Muller and Robert Huff gave RML&#x27;s Chevrolet a 1–2 finished the WTCC Race 1 of UK, ahead of Independent runner, Colin Turkington&#x27;s Team RAC BMW who drove a great race to take the final podium position from Alain Menu on the penultimate lap. BMW Team RBM&#x27;s Andy Priaulx converted pole position into a Race 2 win on home turf. Turkington went one better in race two to bring his BMW 320i across the line in second to complete a great result for British drivers. Gabriele Tarquini secured the final podium spot for SR-Sport and SEAT.
With an impressive display, Paul di Resta takes another DTM in 2010. After 98 laps, he crossed the finish line with his AMG-Mercedes C-Klasse, 7.4 seconds ahead of his teammate Bruno Spengler, thus repeated last year&#x27;s victory. Double champion, Timo Scheider (Audi) completed the podium.

Martin Tomczyk headed an Audi 1–2–3 in a wet race at Brands Hatch, on 4 September 2011. Mattias Ekström secured second, just two seconds behind and closing. Edoardo Mortara was third, just two seconds ahead of top Mercedes driver, Gary Paffett in fourth.

On 20 May 2012, Gary Paffett (Mercedes-Benz AMG C-Coupé) won his home DTM race, from pole position. His margin of victory over Bruno Spengler BMW M3 DTM was five seconds. Mike Rockenfeller completed the top three in the Team Phoenix Audi A5 DTM, making it three different manufacturers on the podium. This was Mercedes&#x27; fourth win out of seven races at Brands Hatch.

The DTM competitors returned to Brands, May 2013, where Mike Rockenfeller dominated with a lights-to-flag win, in his Audi RS5. The reigning champion, Bruno Spengler was second for BMW with his fellow Canadian, Robert Wickens taking third for Mercedes-Benz. However the DTM cars did not return in 2014, as the series expanded into Eastern Europe and China. DTM chief, Hans Werner Aufrecht said that &quot;while Brands and Zandvoort had been good venues for the championship, Hungary and China were stronger markets&quot;. Meanwhile, Jonathan Palmer, head of Brands owner MotorSport Vision, said the decision to part with the DTM was a mutual one. &quot;We have enjoyed hosting DTM at Brands Hatch for eight years but we have agreed with ITR that it&#x27;s time for the event to move on. We witnessed great races at these circuits and have to say thank you for the good cooperation,&quot; he said.

After a four-year hiatus, it was confirmed that DTM would return to Brands Hatch in August 2018, this time competing on the full Grand Prix layout.

The British Superbike season finale has also been regularly hosted at the circuit, with the 2011 deciding round proving particularly dramatic, as Tommy Hill and John Hopkins frequently overtook each other on the final lap, with Hill emerging as the champion by 0.006 of a second. Brands Hatch typically hosts three rounds of the series, including two events on the Grand Prix circuit.

The opening and closing rounds of the British Touring Car Championship are also held at Brands Hatch, with the champions typically crowned at the circuit in October.

Brands Hatch had hosted Britcar&#x27;s &#x27;Into the Night&#x27; race from 2008 to 2011. After a four-year hiatus, it hosted the final round of the 2016 season in the night again and this event continues annually. 
Truck racing has also developed into a large family-friendly event, with the series final event of the year concluded with a large fireworks display which attracts huge crowds.

The circuit also hosts a major events on the historic racing calendar on May Bank Holiday: the Masters Historic Festival.

Despite the curfew, the early evenings during the autumn months allow some racing to take place in darkness and the Britcar &#x27;into the night&#x27; race has been a regular on the calendar, with the Lotus 1000 km reviving a tradition that started in the 1960s with the BOAC sportscar races.

The circuit has also launched a number of innovative themed festivals celebrating motorsport of different cultures, including the American SpeedFest, Festival Italia and Deutsche Fest. The American SpeedFest, launched in 2013, features the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series has become one of the venue&#x27;s biggest events of the year. These festivals feature large off track entertainment areas, running concurrently with the on track racing.

===British Rallycross Grand Prix===

In the early 1980s, Rallycross was beginning to attract more sponsorship and enjoy a higher quality of competition, frequently broadcast on BBC Grandstand. The Rallycross Grand Prix ran at Brands Hatch between 1982 and 1994 and was an open competition for anyone who owned a Rallycross car. This led to an appealing race with eclectic mix of cars and drivers, most notably Denis Marcel&#x27;s in a Matra Murena, Stig Blomqvist in his own Audi Quattro, and Cor Euser in a MG Metro 6R4. Also, the location of the circuit and the marketing effort of the organizers contributed to its success. In a popular move, Group B rally cars were permitted from 1987 until 1992.

Recent versions at Lydden Hill and Croft have not recaptured the magic of the original Grand Prix, which remain some of the sport&#x27;s best ever.

===Other events===

Aside from circuit racing, Single Stage Rally uses the tarmac and other inner sections of the circuit like the pits and other roads at the venue. The annual Modified Live and Race Car Live events also follow an exhibition format.

The circuit has hosted the Motocross des Nations four times.

In 2011, it also hosted one of the rounds of the Mini 7 Racing Club season.

During the week the circuit offers some general test days and driving experiences, and can also be hired out for private testing and track days.

Since 2015, Brands Hatch hosts the Revolve24 Circuit Challenge, an ultra-distance cycling event featuring 24-hour, 12-hour and 6-hour races for soloists and relay teams up to 8 riders.

===2012 Summer Paralympics===

In September 2012, Brands Hatch was the base for the road cycling events of the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Riders raced around a course that starts and finishes at Brands Hatch and encompasses both the circuit and local roads surrounding it.

Notably, the men&#x27;s H4 time trial and road race were won by Italy&#x27;s Alex Zanardi, a racing driver who had extensive experience as a driver at the track. Zanardi first drove at Brands Hatch in 1991 in the Formula 3000 series, and had last driven at the track in the World Touring Car Championship in 2009 – eight years after losing both legs in a near-fatal 2001 racing accident during a CART FedEx Championship Series race in Germany.

<text>The Toledan Tables, or Tables of Toledo, were astronomical tables which were used to predict the movements of the Sun, Moon and planets relative to the fixed stars. They were a collection of mathematic tables that describe different aspects of the cosmos including prediction of calendar dates, times of cosmic events, and cosmic motion.

== Origins ==
The Toledan Tables were completed around 1080 by a group of Arabic astronomers at Toledo, Spain. They had started as preexisting Arabic tables made elsewhere, and were numerically adjusted to be centered on the location of Toledo. The Tables of Toledo were partly based on the work of al-Zarqali (known to the West as Arzachel), an Arab mathematician, astronomer, astronomy instrument-maker, and astrologer, who lived in Toledo. The tables were produced by a team whose membership is largely unknown, with the exception of al-Zarqali.

Toledo came under Christian Spanish rule in the mid-1080s, shortly after the tables were completed. A century later at Toledo, the Arabic-to-Latin translator Gerard of Cremona (1114–1187) translated for Latin readers the &quot;Tables of Toledo&quot;, the most accurate compilation in Europe at the time. This collection of tables was influenced heavily by the work of earlier astronomers and tables such as that of Ptolematic tables and the work of al-Battānī. What the Toledan Tables didn&#x27;t derive from previous texts was their parameters for the mean motion of celestial bodies. These parameters use sidereal co-ordinates which is different than other tables, Ptolemy&#x27;s are tropical for instance. During the mid-thirteenth century, Campanus of Novara constructed tables for the meridian of Novara from the Toledan tables of al-Zarqali.

The original version of the Arabic &quot;Toledan Tables&quot; have been lost but there is still over one hundred versions of the Latin translation which were used for a Greek translation of the &quot;Toledan Tables&quot;, written in Cyprus in the 1330s, likely by the Greek Cypriot scholar George Lapithes.

There are a fair amount of errors in the Toledan Tables&#x27; calculations. The Toledan Tables are almost entirely a collection of copies of other tables. Because of this, the many errors and discrepancies are primarily considered to be copy errors.

== Historical Uses ==
The Toledan Tables were updated in the 1270s by the Alfonsine tables, which were produced at Toledo, in Spanish and Latin, from the original tables of two centuries earlier. The descendants of the Toledan Tables, as updated with some corrections, were the most widely used astronomy tables in late medieval Latin astronomy. Although the compilers of the tables assumed the Earth was stationary at the center of the universe, the data in the tables was successfully used by Copernicus in the development of the model in which the Sun is stationary.

The Toledan Tables were used in the work of a man by the name of Isaac ben Joseph Israeli of Toledo. He used a collection of various Toledan Tables along with other sources to provide information on eclipses. These eclipses had been observed by R. Isaac ben Sid, who was known as one of the authors of the Castilian Alfonsine Tables. Because of this, it was thought that Isaac ben Joseph would speak about the Alfonsine Tables, however he makes no mention of these tables, instead he references the Toledan Tables.

An important characteristic of a few of the Toledan Tables is that they listed the arguments of the planetary positions in half-degrees, making these tables twice as long as other tables which dealt in only full degrees. These arguments were specifically found for Saturn, Venus and Mercury.
The Toledan Tables were organized into categories such as:

* Chronology of eras
* Trigonometry and spherical astronomy
* Mean motions of the sun, moon, and planets
* Planetary latitudes
* Eclipses
* Astrology
In modern astronomy, tables of movements of astronomical bodies are called ephemerides. These expand upon the ideas of the Toledan tables, and are used with modern computing methods to calculate where any celestial body will be at any point in time in relation to another celestial body. They are updated yearly by NASA to provide the accuracy needed for modern calculations. This expands upon the Alfonsine tables by using an updated analytical solution to the conics of the orbital bodies that more accurately map their orbits.

<text>Pirate radio in Ireland has had a long history, with hundreds of pirate radio stations having operated within the country.

Due to past lax enforcement of the rules, the lack of commercial radio until 1989, and the small physical size of the country, pirate radio stations proliferated for a number of years. A small number of stations also attempted television broadcasts although most of these ventures were short-lived.

==History==
===20th century===
Pirate radio in Ireland has its origins in the early and mid-20th century. In 1940, for example, Mayo man Jack Sean McNeela died on hunger strike in Arbour Hill Military Detention Barracks after 55 days protesting his arrest for operating a pro IRA clandestine radio station.

In the early 1970&#x27;s Irish language activists in county Galway established Saor Raidió Chonamara to protest the lack of an official fulltime broadcasting service in Irish. The authorities responded by establishing such a service.

While the number of recorded pirate radio stations during the 1980&#x27;s was in the hundreds, only a few have been notable enough to be remembered. Pirate radio reached its height of popularity in Ireland in that decade after Sunshine Radio and Radio Nova were launched in Dublin. They were soon joined by others.

It was commercial music radio at a time when state broadcaster RTÉ struggled to capture the youth market. This was followed by the arrival in 1982 of South Coast Radio, ABC Tramore and Radio ERI in Cork. These were pirate radio stations run for the first time on a commercial basis with the critical support of Ireland&#x27;s advertising industry. 

Professional market research conducted in the 1980s by market research companies such as Lansdowne Research, Irish Marketing Surveys and Behaviours and Attitudes showed that these radio stations consistently led RTE in terms of reach and market share

In Cork, Radio ERI had a consistent reach in excess of 50% with a reach of 63% recorded in 1986/87, an unprecedented listenership figure. The station boasted an extensive marketing and sales department which produced no fewer than six future local radio managing directors or chief executives throughout Ireland under the legalised regime after 1989 

In 1988 it, along with stations such as Sunshine and Q102 run by Mike Hogan (who was the first managing director of Dublin ILR franchise holder Capital Radio in 1989) and owned by nightclub impresario Pierre Doyle, had annual sales revenues in millions of pounds. 

This led to the Radio and Television Act 1988 which paved the way, with the cooperation of nearly all pirate radio stations, to a new era in independent local radio in Ireland which commenced in 1989. The Independent Radio and Television Commission (IRTC) was established under this legislation.

The 1988 Act effectively limited future pirate radio stations by making it illegal to advertise or support them with stiff penalties. The 1980s were therefore the heyday of pirate radio in Ireland.

===21st century===
In 2002 a new radio regulation body, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), was founded by the Irish government to replace the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation (ODTR).

ComReg had much more funding, staff and resources than its predecessor – and these were put to use in May 2003, when a major crackdown on Dublin pirates saw virtually every station wiped off the band. This series of raids was conducted over two days and involved Garda Síochána officers and ESB staff.

Today only a handful of stations still operate in Dublin (mostly limited to evenings and/or weekends) and in some border areas. Operations elsewhere tend to be rare and sporadic. 

==Notable stations==

===Dublin===

====Radio Dublin====
Radio Dublin started in 1966 founded by Ken Sheehan, and peaked in the late 1970s and up unto the early 1980s until the arrival of Radio Nova and Sunshine radio whose professionalism and quality stereo reception left the station adrift in their wake in the subsequent years. Radio Dublin broadcast on MW, SW and FM simultaneously.

After Eamonn Cooke took over, Radio Dublin had ever increasing ambitions. It was the first radio station in the Republic of Ireland to complete a 24-hour broadcast, this on the occasion of the Irish general election of June 1977. The broadcast was hosted by Roland Burke and David Moore and Bernard Evans. The station ceased full-time operation shortly after the jailing of the station&#x27;s then-owner Eamonn Cooke in 2003 for historic child sex offences many of which took place at the radio station.
====Smaller stations of the late 1970s, early 1980s====
Other pirate stations in Dublin included Radio Dublin, Capitol Radio (Alternative Music station which from September 1986 had an alter ego station Nitesky 96FM), Big D, Radio City, TTTR (Country Music) and ARD (Alternative Radio Dublin - based in Drimnagh then at the Crofton Airport Hotel in Whitehall). Amongst the DJs at the Big D were Chris Wilkinson, Dennis Murray and Dj Shagnasty. Well-known names on radio and television that went through these smaller stations include Marty Whelan, Gerry Ryan, Dave Fanning, John Paul, Ian Dempsey and Robbie Irwin.
North Dublin Community Radio (a forerunner to NEAR FM), was a local community-based radio station, which operated in the Northside of Dublin broadcasting on 100 MHz FM and on 1008 kHz AM.

====1990s====
In the 1990s, a number of stations started, resumed or continued broadcasting despite legislation and occasional raids. Notable stations of this period included Radio Dublin, Sunset, Kiss, Pulse, DLR, Phantom and Radio Limerick One.

===Offshore Radio===
While offshore pirates were rarer in Ireland, they still existed, and many notable UK offshore stations had a connection with Ireland. Both Radio Atlanta and Radio Caroline were built on board ships that were docked in (and made initial test transmissions from) a private Irish port at Greenore in the Republic of Ireland. The &quot;Caroline North&quot; station was occasionally tendered from Dundalk. The Dutch stations Radio Paradijs and REM island were also fitted out in Irish ports while Laser 558 had some Irish staff and financial backing. Another offshore station located at various locations off the coast of Scotland in international waters, later identified itself as Radio Scotland and Ireland when its radio ship moved to anchorage off the west coast and within range of Ireland (for a time they anchored off Northern Ireland).

<doc id="1068218" wikidata="Q1631467" url="?curid=1068218" title="Strategy guide">
<text>Strategy guides are instruction books that contain hints or complete solutions to specific video games. The line between strategy guides and video game walkthroughs is somewhat blurred, with the former often containing or being written around the latter. Strategy guides are often published in print, both in book form and also as articles within video game magazines. In cases of exceptionally popular game titles, guides may be sold through more mainstream publication channels, such as bookstores or even newsstands. Some publishers also sell E-Book versions on their websites.

Strategy guides marketed as &quot;official&quot; are written by game distributors themselves or licensed to a specialty publishing house; Prima Games and Piggyback Interactive specialise in writing official guides for various companies. There are also a number of publishers who make unlicensed, &quot;unofficial&quot; strategy guides, and many of today&#x27;s mainstream publishers began by making such guides.

==Typical contents==
The contents of a strategy guide varies between game genres. Typically, the guides contain:
* Detailed gameplay information, for example, maneuvers that are not detailed in the manual.
* Complete maps of the game, which show the placement of all items (including hidden and hard-to-find ones).
* Detailed instructions for specific locations on how to proceed from there.
* Explanations of puzzles.
* Details of enemies, including techniques on defeating individual enemies (especially bosses), the segment for minor enemies is commonly referred to as a bestiary.
* Checklist of collectible items.
* Cheats and game editing, although this has been less common in official guides.
* Walkthroughs to help the player complete levels.
* Advice on tactics and strategies for use in multi-player (games with multi-player only)

==Publishing before game release==
In order to be released at the same time as the game, commercial strategy guides are often based on a pre-release version of the game, rather than the final retail version; BradyGames&#x27; guide for &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; included misplaced item locations and a slightly different map, which made some directions impossible to follow. BradyGames rectified such mistakes by offering free errata pages for download from their website.

Strategy guides are sometimes published before the game itself is published. This can be risky because there is always the chance that a game will end up not being released. For example, in January 2001, Prima published a guide () for the Dreamcast version of &quot;Half-Life&quot;, which was canceled late in development when Sega discontinued the console.

==Online guides==
Online strategy guides and FAQs are hosted at sites such as GameFAQs and IGN FAQs, though much of this content is user generated and not published by the company. A number of other sites contain strategy guides, and videos in a number of niche areas, such as Role Playing Games or First Person Shooters. These sites may attract a more limited set of viewers, but can include more depth of content. Video-sharing sites such as YouTube have given rise to video walkthroughs using programs such as Fraps, which allows players to more easily mirror the strategies being described. These videos are re-posted to a number of sites.

Video game wikis are used as both strategy guides and documentation. Content is generated and edited completely by users. Wikis allow for information to updated if a developer introduced a new patch to the game. Wiki farms such as Fandom and Gamepedia host a large number of unofficial video game wikis while wikis can be integrated into the overall site such as IGN Wikis. While most wikis are considered unofficial and not supported by the developer, some developers may choose to do so for various reasons. These reasons may include resolving copyright issues and real world trading that may be found on unofficial wikis. For example, ArenaNet hosts an official wiki for &quot;Guild Wars&quot; and &quot;Guild Wars 2&quot;, citing that &quot;it&#x27;s often more complete and useful than the documentation that ArenaNet generates internally.&quot; Information on the wiki is integrated into the game, allowing players to access information from in game. Although the wiki is hosted by ArenaNet, the site is run and moderated by the community and contributions are released under GNU Free Document License (GDFL) similar to sites such as Wikipedia.

Aside from the quality of the content, the community aspect of fan walkthroughs is significant. One perspective argues that walkthroughs are shared stories for gamers and game fans. In creating walkthroughs, gamers actively create meaning for the games. This is similar to activities of traditional media such as books, films and television (e.g., Fan Fiction).

The increasing availability of free online FAQs and walkthroughs has taken away some of the demand for commercial strategy guides, although there is still a large market for them. Print guides often feature extensive picture-by-picture walkthroughs, maps, and game art, none of which is possible in the plain-text works hosted by prominent sites such as GameFAQs. Some newer sites allow strategy guides to be hosted in formats that allow pictures and videos, which further undercuts the advantages of print strategy guides.

Some publishers have tried combining their printed books with the Internet. In 2000, the &quot;Final Fantasy IX Official Strategy Guide&quot; was published by BradyGames, but much of the information was contained on Square&#x27;s PlayOnline website. This seemed like a good way to promote PlayOnline, while creating a guide that would have updatable content, but it was widely panned. Players saw no need of buying a book if a significant part of the content was online; and there was no point paying for online content from one site, if it was available for free on another site. As a result, Square abandoned the online strategy guide concept and released traditional printed guides for future games.

==Criticism==
Games journalist and guide writer Alan Emrich has severely criticized recent strategy guides for:
*Containing only facts which should have been in the game manual, e.g. about the user interface.
*Failing to teach users how to improve their play.
*Failing to provide information which helps them to make decisions, e.g. about the capabilities and costs of units and buildings.
*Being inaccurate, often because the developers have tweaked the game during the publication lead time.

The faults, he says, are mainly caused by the game publishers&#x27; and guide publishers&#x27; haste to get their products on to the market; &quot;[previously] strategy guides were published after a game was released so that they could be accurate, even to the point of including information changes from late game &#x27;patch&#x27; releases. The &quot;Master of Orion&quot; official strategy guide that Tom Hughes and I wrote is just that kind of book.&quot;

<text>Donald McDonald Dickinson (January 17, 1846 – October 15, 1917) was a lawyer and politician from the U.S. state of Michigan.

==Biography==
Dickinson was born in the town of Richland, Oswego County, New York, on January 17, 1846, the son of Asa Case Dickinson and Minerva Holmes. His family moved to Michigan when he was two years old. He graduated from the University of Michigan Law School in 1867 and built a very successful practice in Detroit, frequently arguing cases before the Supreme Court of the United States.

In 1872, Dickinson established himself in state politics by working to effectively organize the Democratic Party in what at the time was a heavily Republican state. He was a member of Democratic National Committee from Michigan 1880–1885, and was an early supporter of the candidacy of Grover Cleveland for President in 1884. After the election, Cleveland offered Dickinson a position on the recently created Civil Service Commission, but he declined. However, in 1887, Dickinson accepted the appointment as United States Postmaster General, serving from January 6, 1888, until the end of Cleveland&#x27;s first term in 1889. A railroad strike soon after Dickinson took office interrupted postal service in the nation. Dickinson refused to use federal forces to break the strike and instead modified the distribution routes so that postal deliveries could continue. At Cleveland&#x27;s request, Dickinson applied civil service reforms to hiring practices to minimize the effect of patronage on the postal service.

Following Cleveland&#x27;s defeat, Dickinson returned to the practice of law in Detroit. He subsequently headed Michigan&#x27;s delegation to the 1892 Democratic National Convention which renominated Cleveland. Dickinson split with the Democratic Party over William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s ascendancy and his monetary proposals. Dickinson supported the Republican ticket of William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt in 1900 and also supported Roosevelt&#x27;s unsuccessful run as a third party candidate in 1912.

He died in Detroit on October 15, 1917, and is interred at Elmwood Cemetery. Dickinson County, Michigan, is named for him.

<doc id="1068230" wikidata="Q1274157" url="?curid=1068230" title="Market power">
<text>In economics, market power refers to the ability of a firm to influence the price at which it sells a product or service by manipulating either the supply or demand of the product or service to increase economic profit. In other words, market power occurs if a firm does not face a perfectly elastic demand curve and can set its price (P) above marginal cost (MC) without losing revenue. This indicates that the magnitude of market power is associated with the gap between P and MC at a firm&#x27;s profit maximising level of output. The size of the gap, which encapsulates the firm&#x27;s level of market dominance, is determined by the residual demand curve&#x27;s form. A steeper reverse demand indicates higher earnings and more dominance in the market. Such propensities contradict perfectly competitive markets, where market participants have no market power, P = MC and firms earn zero economic profit. Market participants in perfectly competitive markets are consequently referred to as &#x27;price takers&#x27;, whereas market participants that exhibit market power are referred to as &#x27;price makers&#x27; or &#x27;price setters&#x27;.

The market power of any individual firm is controlled by multiple factors, including but not limited to, their size, the structure of the market they are involved in, and the barriers to entry for the particular market. A firm with market power has the ability to individually affect either the total quantity or price in the market. This said, market power has been seen to exert more upward pressure on prices due to effects relating to Nash equilibria and profitable deviations that can be made by raising prices. Price makers face a downward-sloping demand curve and as a result, price increases lead to a lower quantity demanded. The decrease in supply creates an economic deadweight loss (DWL) and a decline in consumer surplus. This is viewed as socially undesirable and has implications for welfare and resource allocation as larger firms with high markups negatively effect labour markets by providing lower wages. Perfectly competitive markets do not exhibit such issues as firms set prices that reflect costs, which is to the benefit of the customer. As a result, many countries have antitrust or other legislation intended to limit the ability of firms to accrue market power. Such legislation often regulates mergers and sometimes introduces a judicial power to compel divestiture.

Market power provides firms with the ability to engage in unilateral anti-competitive behavior. As a result, legislation recognises that firms with market power can, in some circumstances, damage the competitive process. In particular, firms with market power are accused of limit pricing, predatory pricing, holding excess capacity and strategic bundling. A firm usually has market power by having a high market share although this alone is not sufficient to establish the possession of significant market power. This is because highly concentrated markets may be contestable if there are no barriers to entry or exit. Invariably, this limits the incumbent firm&#x27;s ability to raise its price above competitive levels.

If no individual participant in the market has significant market power, anti-competitive conduct can only take place through collusion, or the exercise of a group of participants&#x27; collective market power. An example of which was seen in 2007, when British Airways was found to have colluded with Virgin Atlantic between 2004 and 2006, increasing their surcharges per ticket from £5 to £60.

Regulators are able to assess the level of market power and dominance a firm has and measure competition through the use of several tools and indicators. Although market power is extremely difficult to measure, through the use of widely used analytical techniques such as concentration ratios, the Herfindahl-Hirschman index and the Lerner index, regulators are able to oversee and attempt to restore market competitiveness.

== Market structure ==

In economics, market structure can profoundly affect the behavior and financial performance of firms. Market structure depicts how different industries are characterized and differentiated based upon the types of goods the firms sell (homogenous/heterogenous) and the nature of competition within the industry. The degree of market power firms assert in different markets are relative to the market structure that the firms operate in. There are four main forms of market structures that are observed: perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly. Perfect competition and monopoly represent the two extremes of market structure, respectively. Monopolistic competition and oligopoly exist in between these two extremes.

&quot;Perfect Competition&quot; refers to a market structure that is devoid of any barriers or interference and describes those marketplaces where neither corporations nor consumers are powerful enough to affect pricing. In terms of economics, it is one of the many conventional market forms and the optimal condition of market competition. The concept of perfect competition represents a theoretical market structure where the market reaches an equilibrium that is Pareto optimal. This occurs when the quantity supplied by sellers in the market equals the quantity demanded by buyers in the market at the current price. Firms competing in a perfectly competitive market faces a market price that is equal to their marginal cost, therefore, no economic profits are present. The following criteria need to be satisfied in a perfectly competitive market:

# Producers sell homogenous goods
# All firms are price takers
# Perfect information 
# No barriers to enter and exit 
# All firms have relatively small market share and cannot influence price

As all firms in the market are price takers, they essentially hold zero market power and must accept the price given by the market. A perfectly competitive market is logically impossible to achieve in a real world scenario as it embodies contradiction in itself and therefore is considered an idealised framework by economists.

=== Monopolistic competition power ===
Monopolistic competition can be described as the &quot;middle ground&quot; between perfect competition and a monopoly as it shares elements present in both market structures that are on different ends of the market structure spectrum. Monopolistic competition is a type of market structure defined by many producers that are competing against each other by selling similar goods which are differentiated, thus are not perfect substitutes. In the short term, firms are able to obtain economic profits as a result of differentiated goods providing sellers with some degree of market power; however, profits approaches zero as more competitive toughness increases in the industry. The main characteristics of monopolistic competition include:

#Differentiated products
# Many sellers and buyers
# Free entry and exit 
Firms within this market structure are not price takers and compete based on product price, quality and through marketing efforts, setting individual prices for the unique differentiated products. Examples of industries with monopolistic competition include restaurants, hairdressers and clothing.

===Monopoly power ===
The word monopoly is used in various instances referring to a single seller of a product, a producer with an overwhelming level of market share, or refer to a large firm. All of these treatments have one unifying factor which is the ability to influence the market price by altering the supply of the good or service through its own production decisions. The most discussed form of market power is that of a monopoly, but other forms such as monopsony and more moderate versions of these extremes exist. A monopoly is considered a &#x27;market failure&#x27; and consists of one firm that produces a unique product or service without close substitutes. Whilst pure monopolies are rare, monopoly power is far more common and can be seen in many industries even with more than one supplier in the market. Firms with monopoly power can charge a higher price for products (higher markup) as demand is relatively inelastic. They also see a falling rate of labour share as firms divest from expensive inputs such as labour. Often, firms with monopoly power exist in industries with high barriers to entry, which include, but are not limited to:

# Economies of scale
# Predatory pricing
# Control of key resources (required in production of the good)
# Legal regulations

A well-known example of monopolistic market power is Microsoft&#x27;s market share in PC operating systems. The &quot;United States v. Microsoft&quot; case dealt with an allegation that Microsoft illegally exercised its market power by bundling its web browser with its operating system. In this respect, the notion of dominance and dominant position in EU Antitrust Law is a strictly related aspect.

===Oligopoly power===
Another form of market power is that of an oligopoly or oligopsony. Within this market structure, the market is highly concentrated and several firms control a significant share of market sales. The emergence of oligopoly market forms is mainly attributed to the monopoly of market competition, i.e., the market monopoly acquired by enterprises through their competitive advantages, and the administrative monopoly due to government regulations, such as when the government grants monopoly power to an enterprise in the industry through laws and regulations and at the same time imposes certain controls on it to improve efficiency. The main characteristics of an oligopoly are:

# A few sellers and many buyers.
# Homogenous or differentiated products. 
# High barriers to entry. This includes, but is not limited to, &#x27;technology challenges, government regulations, patents, start-up costs, or education and licensing requirements&#x27;.
# Interaction/strategic behaviour.

It is salient to note that only a few firms make up the market share. Hence, their market power is large as a collective and each firm has little or no market power independently. For firms trying to enter these industries, unless they can start with a large production scale and capture a significant market share, the high average costs will make it impossible for them to compete with the existing firms. Generally, when a firm operating in an oligopolistic market adjusts prices, other firms in the industry will be directly impacted.

The graph below depicts the kinked demand curve hypothesis which was proposed by Paul Sweezy who was an American economist. It is important to note that this graph is a simplistic example of a kinked demand curve.

Oligopolistic firms are believed to operate within the confines of the kinked demand function. This means that when firms set prices above the prevailing price level (P*), prices are relatively elastic because individuals are likely to switch to a competitor&#x27;s product as a substitute. Prices below P* are believed to be relatively inelastic as competitive firms are likely to mimic the change in prices, meaning less gains are experienced by the firm.

An oligopoly may engage in collusion, either tacit or overt to exercise market power and manipulate prices to control demand and revenue for a collection of firms. A group of firms that explicitly agree to affect market price or output is called a cartel, with the organization of petroleum-exporting countries (OPEC) being one of the most well known example of an international cartel.

==Sources of market power==
By remaining consistent with the strict definition of market power as any firm with a positive Lerner index, the sources of market power is derived from distinctiveness of the good and or seller. For a monopolist, distinctiveness is a necessary condition that needs to be satisfied but this is just the starting point. Without barriers to entries, above normal profits experienced by monopolists would not persist as other sellers of homogenous or similar goods would continue to enter the industry until above normal profits are diminished until the industry experiences perfect competition

There are several sources of market power including:

# High barriers to entry. These barriers include the control of scarce resources, increasing returns to scale, technological superiority and government created barriers to entry. OPEC is an example of an organization that has market power due to control over scarce resources – oil. 
# Increasing returns to scale. Firms that experience increasing returns to scale also experience decreasing average total costs and therefore become more profitable with size and higher demand levels.
# High start-up costs. This barrier makes it difficult for new entrants to succeed as the initial creation costs are ingrained within the industry. Firms like power, cable television and telecommunication companies fall within this category. A firm seeking to enter such industries require the ability to spend millions of dollars before starting operations and generating revenue. 
# Brand loyalty of consumers and value placed by consumers on reputation. Incumbent firms often have a competitive advantage over new entrants as customers are familiar with the product and service. An incumbent firm can engage in several entry-deterring strategies such as limit pricing, predatory pricing and strategic bundling. Microsoft has substantial pricing or market power due to technological superiority in its design and production processes. 
# Government policies/regulations. One significant technique of governmental action to create monopolies is the granting of franchises and operating licenses. This is due to the fact that no other businesses are permitted by law to operate without a franchise. A prime example are patents granted to pharmaceutical companies which prevent competitors from creating and selling their specific goods. These patents give the drug companies a virtual monopoly in the protected product for the term of the patent.
# Factors of Production Barriers. An important influencing factor of market power is the control of the supply of factors of production to produce the good. Factors of production can be divided into tangible land, capital, and intangible human resources, intelligence, etc. As the industrial economy changes to a knowledge-based economy, the control of the supply of intangible factors of production such as talent, intelligence, information, etc. will become more and more of a barrier to entry for companies with unlimited market power.

==Measurement of market power==
Measuring market power is inherently complex because the most widely used measures are sensitive to the definition of a market and the range of analysis.

Magnitude of a firm&#x27;s market power is shown by a firm&#x27;s ability to deviate from an elastic demand curve and charge a higher price (P) above its marginal cost (C), commonly referred to as a firm&#x27;s mark-up or margin. The higher a firm&#x27;s mark-up, the larger the magnitude of power. This said, markups are complicated to measure as they are reliant on a firm&#x27;s marginal costs and as a result, concentration ratios are the more common measures as they require only publicly accessible revenue data.

=== Concentration ratios ===
Market concentration, also referred to as industry concentration, refers to the extent of which market shares of the largest firms in the market account for a significant portion of the economic activities quantifiable by various metrics such as sales, employment, active users. Recent macroeconomic market power literature indicates that concentration ratios are the most frequently used measure of market power. Measures of concentration summarise the share of market or industry activity accounted for by large firms. An advantage of using concentration as an empirical tool to quantify market power is the requirement of only needing revenue data of firms which results in the corresponding disadvantage of the inconsideration of costs or profits.

==== &quot;N&quot;-firm concentration ratio ====

The &quot;N&quot;-firm concentration ratio gives the combined market share of the largest &quot;N&quot; firms in the market. For example, a 4-firm concentration ratio measures the total market share of the four largest firms in an industry. In order to calculate the &quot;N&quot;-firm concentration ratio, one usually uses sales revenue to calculate market share, however, concentration ratios based on other measures such as production capacity may also be used. For a monopoly, the 4-firm concentration ratio is 100 per cent whilst for perfect competition, the ratio is zero. Moreover, studies indicate that a concentration ratio of between 40 and 70 percent suggests that the firm operates as an oligopoly. These figures are viable but should be used as a &#x27;rule of thumb&#x27; as it is important to consider other market factors when analysing concentration ratios.

An advantage of concentration ratios as an empirical tool for studying market power is that it requires only data on revenues and is thus easy to compute. The corresponding disadvantage is that concentration is about relative revenue and includes no information about costs or profits.

==== Herfindahl-Hirschman index ====

The Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) is another measure of concentration and is the sum of the squared market shares of all firms in a market. The HHI is a more widely used indicator in economics and government regulation. The index reflects not only the market share of large firms within the market, but also the market structure outside of large firms, and therefore, more accurately reflects the degree of influence of large firms on the market. For example, in a market with two firms, each with 50% market share, the HHI is formula_1 = 0.502 + 0.502 = 0.50. The HHI for a monopoly is 1 whilst for perfect competition, the HHI is zero. Unlike the &quot;N&quot;-firm concentration ratio, large firms are given more weight in the HHI and as a result, the HHI conveys more information. However the HHI has its own limitations as it is sensitive to the definition of a market, therefore meaning you cannot use it to cross-examine different industries, or do analysis over time as the industry changes.
=== Lerner index ===
The Lerner index is a widely accepted and applied method of estimating market power in a monopoly. It compares a firm&#x27;s price of output with its associated marginal cost where marginal cost pricing is the &quot;socially optimal level&quot; achieved in market with perfect competition. Lerner (1934) believes that market power is the monopoly manufacturers&#x27; ability to raise prices above their marginal cost. This notion can be expressed by using the formula:

:formula_2

Where P represents the price of the good set by the firm and MC representing the firm&#x27;s marginal cost. The formula focuses on the nature of monopoly and emphasising welfare economic implications of the Pareto optimal principle. Although Lerner is usually credited for the price/cost margin index, the generalized version was fully derived prior to WWII by Italian neoclassical economist, Luigi Amaroso.

==Connection with competition law==
Market power within competition law can be used to determine whether or not a firm has unfairly manipulated the market in their favour, or to the detriment of entrants. The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 under section 2 restricts firms from engaging in anticompetitive conduct by utilising an individual firm&#x27;s power to manipulate the market or partake in anticompetitive acts.
A firm can be found in breach of the act if they have leveraged their market power to unfairly gain further market power in a manner that is detrimental to the market and consumers. The measurement of market power is key in determining a breach of the act and can be determined from multiple measurements as discussed in measurements of market power above.

In Australia, consumer law allows for firms to have significant market power and utilise it, as long as it is determined to not have “the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition” 

==Elasticity of demand==
The degree to which a firm can raise its price above marginal cost depends on the shape of the demand curve at a firm&#x27;s profit maximising level of output. Consequently, the relationship between market power and the price elasticity of demand (PED) can be summarised by the equation:

: formula_3

The ratio formula_4 is always greater than &quot;1&quot; and the higher the formula_4 ratio, the more market power the firm possesses. As PED increases in magnitude, the formula_4 ratio approaches &quot;1&quot; and market power approaches zero. The equation is derived from the monopolist pricing rule:

: formula_7

<text>Tony Ray-Jones (7 June 1941 – 13 March 1972) was an English photographer.

==Life==
Born Holroyd Anthony Ray-Jones in Wells, Somerset, he was the youngest son of Raymond Ray-Jones (1886–1942), a painter and etcher who died when Tony was only eight months old, and Effie Irene Pearce, who would work as a physiotherapist. After his father&#x27;s death, Tony&#x27;s mother took the family to Tonbridge in Kent, to Little Baddow (near Chelmsford, Essex), and then to Hampstead in London. He was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital (Horsham), which he hated.

Tony Ray-Jones studied at the London School of Printing, where he concentrated on graphic design. In the early 1960s he obtained a scholarship that enabled him to join Yale University School of Art on the strength of photographs he had taken in north Africa from a taxi window. Although only 19 on his arrival at Yale, Ray-Jones&#x27; talent was obvious, and in 1963 he was given assignments for the magazines &quot;Car and Driver&quot; and &quot;Saturday Evening Post.&quot;

Eager to use photography for more creative purposes, Ray-Jones went to the Design Lab held by the art director Alexey Brodovitch in the Manhattan studio of Richard Avedon; Brodovitch&#x27;s gruff manner and high standards won respect and hard work from Ray-Jones and others. Ray-Jones also got to know a number of New York &quot;street photographers&quot;, such as Joel Meyerowitz, a fellow Brodovich student at the time.
Ray-Jones graduated from Yale in 1964 and photographed the United States energetically until his departure for Britain in late 1965. From then until 1970, he lived and worked at 102 Gloucester Place, Marylebone; this is now marked by a memorial plaque.

On his return to Britain, he was shocked at the lack of interest in non-commercial photography, let alone in the publication of books presenting it. He was also unsure of what subject he might pursue, but the idea of a survey of the English at leisure gradually took shape. He began work on that, at the same time doing portrait and other work for the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, Sunday newspapers, and magazines.

In the October 1968 issue of &quot;Creative Camera&quot; magazine, he described what he was trying to achieve:

My aim is to communicate something of the spirit and the mentality of the English, their habits and their way of life, the ironies that exist in the way they do things, partly through their traditions and partly through the nature of their environment and their mentality. For me there is something very special about the English &#x27;way of life&#x27; and I wish to record it from my particular point of view before it becomes Americanised and disappears.

His photographs of festivals and leisure activities are full of a somewhat surreal humour, and show the influence of photographers such as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Garry Winogrand, as well as his own collection of the work of Sir Benjamin Stone.

In 1969, &quot;Architectural Review&quot; magazine commissioned photojournalists for eight themed issues called &quot;Manplan&quot;, examining the contemporary state of architecture and town planning. The photos were published between September 1969 and September 1970. Ray-Jones&#x27;s work documenting people living on housing estates in Britain was published in an issue on housing in 1970, and were included in his second unsuccessful submission to join Magnum Photos.

Critic Sean O&#x27;Hagan wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;:

Ray-Jones was in many ways a social anthropologist with a camera, but it is his eye for detail and often brilliantly complex compositions that sets him apart. His images often appear cluttered ... On closer inspection, though, what we are glimpsing is several small narratives contained in the bigger defining one.&quot;

Ray-Jones was both sociable and abrasive, introducing himself to Bill Jay, the editor of &quot;Creative Camera&quot;, by saying &quot;Your magazine&#x27;s shit, but I can see you&#x27;re trying. You just don&#x27;t know enough, so I am here to help you&quot;. However, he impressed Jay (who later acknowledged Ray-Jones as one of the greatest influences on his view of photography), and also worked hard and successfully to have exhibitions of his works.

He returned to the United States in January 1971 to work as a teacher at the San Francisco Art Institute – one of the few ways in which he could legally stay in the US. He disliked teaching, finding the students self-centred and lazy, but he was soon able to busy himself working on assignments for both the British and the US press.

Ray-Jones&#x27;s non-assignment photographs were first published in the October 1968 issue of &quot;Creative Camera&quot;.

In late 1971, Ray-Jones started to suffer from exhaustion. Early the next year leukaemia was diagnosed, and he started chemotherapy. Medical treatment in the US was too expensive, so Ray-Jones flew to London on 10 March and immediately entered the Royal Marsden Hospital; he died there on 13 March.

Sean O&#x27;Hagan said &quot;in his short life he helped create a way of seeing that has shaped several generations of British photography.&quot;

==Legacy==
Ray-Jones&#x27; book about the English, unfinished at the time of his death, was published posthumously by Thames &amp; Hudson in 1974 as &quot;A Day Off: An English Journal&quot;.

Ray-Jones&#x27; archive has been housed at the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford since 1993. It consists of 700 photographic prints, 1,700 negative sheets, 2,700 contact sheets, 10,000 colour transparencies and Ray-Jones&#x27; notebooks and correspondence.

<doc id="1068242" wikidata="Q5479124" url="?curid=1068242" title="Francesca Martinez">
<text>Francesca Martinez (born 1978) is an English comedian, writer and actress. She has cerebral palsy, but prefers to describe herself as &quot;wobbly&quot;. Martinez first came to public attention in 1994, when she made her debut on the television series &quot;Grange Hill,&quot; where she went on to portray the role of Rachel Burns for a total of 55 episodes. Later turning her focus to stand-up comedy, she has performed at the Edinburgh Festival and internationally, including the Melbourne Comedy Festival, the Adelaide Fringe Festival, the Perth Festival and the Just For Laughs Festival in Montreal. In 2018 she completed a 140-date tour, and has had off-West End London runs at the Tricycle Theatre, the Hackney Empire, and the Soho Theatre. Martinez&#x27;s debut play, &quot;All of Us&quot;, was scheduled to be performed at the National Theatre in 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It opened in July 2022.

== Early life ==
Martinez was born in London to a Spanish father and a half-Swedish, half-English mother in 1978. She was diagnosed with cerebral palsy aged two. Martinez was also incorrectly diagnosed as intellectually disabled by a consultant physician, but her parents chose for her to be educated at an integrated school, an experience that Martinez enjoyed. She later attended an all-girls&#x27; high school, an experience that harmed her previously good self-esteem. She was 14 when she secured a role on the series &quot;Grange Hill&quot;.

==Career==
Before becoming a comedian, Martinez appeared in the BBC children&#x27;s drama series &quot;Grange Hill&quot; from 1994 to 1998, where she played the first disabled pupil to appear in the fictional school, and has acted in other drama series such as &quot;Holby City&quot;.

A year after she began performing stand-up comedy, in 2000, Martinez became the first female comic to win the prestigious &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; Open Mic Award at the Edinburgh Festival. She performed her debut solo show, &quot;I&#x27;m Perfect&quot;, in 2002. In 2003 she was listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy.

In August 2005, she appeared in the BBC sitcom &quot;Extras&quot;.

In April 2008, Martinez made global headlines when (live on Channel 4 News) she became the first Olympic torch bearer to pull out of the London relay in protest over China&#x27;s treatment of Tibet.

Martinez performed at the 2008 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland alongside Emma Thompson.

In April 2009, she appeared on the BBC Radio 4 stand-up comedy show, &quot;4 Stands Up&quot;.

In October 2012, she made her debut appearance on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s topical panel show &quot;The News Quiz&quot;, alongside regulars Jeremy Hardy and Sandi Toksvig. She appeared on &quot;The News Quiz&quot; again in January and July 2013.

In 2014, her best-selling book &quot;WHAT THE **** IS NORMAL?!&quot; was published by Random House to critical acclaim. It was nominated for the Chortle Comedy &#x27;Best Book&#x27; Award and The Bread And Roses Radical Publishing Award in 2015. Her tour of the same name clocked up over 140 dates around the world – winning a Fringe Media Network Award at the Edinburgh Fringe, as well as being nominated for Best Show at Dave&#x27;s Leicester Comedy Festival and at the Perth Festival, Australia.

In 2015, she opened series 11 of &quot;Live At The Apollo&quot;, which also featured Alan Carr and Nish Kumar. In 2016, Martinez supported Frankie Boyle on his sell-out UK tour &quot;Hurt Like You&#x27;ve Never Been Loved&quot;.

Martinez has become a regular face on television, including appearances on &quot;The Frank Skinner Show&quot;, &quot;Russell Howard&#x27;s Good News&quot; (BBC Three), &quot;The Jonathan Ross Show&quot;, ITV&#x27;s &quot;Loose Women&quot;, &quot;Free Speech&quot; (BBC3), RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot; with Brendan O&#x27;Connor, &quot;Adam Hills Tonight&quot;, &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot; and &quot;Question Time&quot; on BBC1.

Martinez has written scripts for the BBC and Channel 4. In 2018, her debut radio play &quot;How We&#x27;re Loved&quot; aired on BBC Radio Four.

==Campaigning==
On 8 December 2012, Martinez launched a campaign &quot;War on Welfare&quot; which pledged to get 100,000 supporters to sign a petition calling for an end to UK government cuts for disability benefits and an independent impact assessment of the government&#x27;s welfare changes. The petition attracted 5,000 signatures in the first 48 hours and achieved its target of 100,000 supporters on 30 November 2013.

An outspoken opponent of welfare reform by the government, she uses her public profile to raise issues about disability and fight for what she believes would be a fairer system. Martinez said: &quot;As a disabled person in the media, I want to help give this issue a voice. It&#x27;s morally wrong for the government to target those in need instead of saving money by targeting the real causes of this crisis – and close tax loopholes and regulate the financial sector. To me, it&#x27;s a human rights issue.&quot;

She is patron of a number of charities.

She has challenged the government in numerous TV interviews, including on &quot;Newsnight&quot; and &quot;This Week&quot;, and in other TV appearances such as &quot;Question Time&quot;.

In 2015 she helped organise This Changes Everything, a one-day event on climate and social justice, with Naomi Klein, Russell Brand, and many other speakers. The event was streamed globally and aimed to kick-start a movement to unify the left against climate change.

==Awards and nominations==
In 2013 she was nominated for a Women in Public Life Award, and won the Public Affairs Achiever of the Year Award. In April 2014 she was named as one of Britain&#x27;s most influential women in the BBC Woman&#x27;s Hour power list 2014. She was also nominated for Red Magazine&#x27;s Woman of the Year Award 2014 and for a European Diversity Hero of the Year Award 2014.

Martinez has received honorary doctorates from the Open University and Bradford University.

==Political views==
In July 2015, Martinez endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. In 2016, along with other celebrities, Martinez toured the UK to support Corbyn&#x27;s bid to become Prime Minister. In September 2016, she performed at the Keep Corbyn rally in Brighton in support of Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election.

In November 2019, along with other public figures, Martinez signed a letter supporting Corbyn. In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, she signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Corbyn&#x27;s leadership in the 2019 general election.

<text>James Thomas Mulville (born 5 January 1955) is an English comedian, comedy writer, producer and television presenter. He is best known for co-founding (in 1986) the British independent television production company Hat Trick Productions with Denise O&#x27;Donoghue and Rory McGrath (who left in 1992). In 2003, Mulville and O&#x27;Donoghue, as co-founders of Hat Trick, were listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as two of the 50 funniest people in Britain.

==Early career==
Brought up in Walton, Liverpool, Mulville attended Alsop High School, a local comprehensive. He began his career as an actor and writer for the Cambridge Footlights, whilst reading French and Classics at Jesus College, Cambridge.

At Cambridge, Mulville met Rory McGrath with whom he both performed and wrote. He became president of Cambridge Footlights in 1977 and after graduating, went on to work for BBC Radio comedy for four years, producing shows such as &quot;Injury Time&quot; (1980–1982) and &quot;Radio Active&quot;, before moving to television in 1984 as script editor and producer of &quot;Alas Smith and Jones&quot;.

==TV appearances and radio broadcasts==
He appeared in and co-wrote the cult TV show &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot; (1983–1988). He was one of the cast of the British comedy series &quot;The Steam Video Company&quot; (1984). He starred in the ITV sitcom &quot;That&#x27;s Love&quot; in the 1980s, along with Diana Hardcastle and Tony Slattery.

He co-wrote and starred with Rory McGrath in the two series of &quot;Chelmsford 123&quot;, a comedy set in Roman Britain, broadcast on Channel 4 in 1988 and 1990. They also co-wrote the radio comedy &quot;Glompus Van Der Hloed&#x27;s Tales From The Crypt&quot;, which starred Andrew Sachs, Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones, which aired on Capital Radio in the early 1980s and subsequently released in an abridged version as an album. He featured on the radio version, as well as the television pilot, of UK improvisation show, &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, alongside Stephen Fry and Nonny Williams.

Mulville had a non-comic acting role in Alan Bleasdale&#x27;s &quot;G.B.H.&quot; in 1991, playing a researcher hired by the lead character Michael Murray to trace his childhood nemesis. On radio, he appeared in the BBC Radio 4 comedy series &quot;Old Harry&#x27;s Game&quot; (1995–2012) as Thomas Quentin Crimp; he and writer and co-star Andy Hamilton are old friends, having met at Cambridge, where they were at university with Rory McGrath, Clive Anderson and Griff Rhys Jones.

==Personal life==
He has been married three times, with the first two marriages ending in divorce. He has four children, a step-daughter and three sons. His second marriage was to Denise O&#x27;Donoghue, with whom he continued to work after they divorced. In 1999 Mulville and O&#x27;Donoghue jointly received the BAFTA Alan Clarke Award for their creative contribution to television. His third wife is Karen Mulville, the co-founder of the retirement complex Auriens.

He is an Everton F.C. supporter. In 2004 he was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Liverpool.

<text>Matthew Pritchett MBE (born 14 July 1964) is a British cartoonist who has worked on &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper under the pen name Matt since 1988.

==Early life and education==
Pritchett&#x27;s father Oliver Pritchett, who was a columnist for &quot;The Telegraph&quot; for all decades, is the son of the writer V. S. Pritchett. Matt&#x27;s sister is screenwriter Georgia Pritchett.

Pritchett attended a grammar school in south&amp;east London before studying graphics at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art. He started working as a waiter in a pizza restaurant, and started drawing cartoons in his spare time. His first cartoon was published in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, and he soon started drawing more cartoons for &quot;The Telegraph&quot; diary. He had considered becoming a film-cameraman, but gave up after realising he had misunderstood the role.

==Career and honours==
Following the death of Mark Boxer in 1988, Pritchett was hired by Max Hastings to be The Telegraph&#x27;s new cartoonist. His first cartoon in this role came the day after the newspaper was printed with the date error, leading them to make a front-page apology accompanied by a cartoon saying &quot;I hope I have a better Thursday than I did yesterday&quot;.

He was appointed an MBE in the 2002 New Year Honours &quot;for services to Journalism&quot;, and in 2005, &quot;Press Gazette&quot; inducted him into their Hall of Fame as one of the 40 most influential journalists of the past four decades.

He has won the British Press Awards&#x27; &quot;Cartoonist of the Year&quot; multiple times, and has been a nominee many other times. His work has also been published in &quot;Punch&quot;.

==Personal life==
Pritchett is married to Pascale Smets, a Belgian former fashion designer. They met whilst studying at Saint Martin&#x27;s, and have three daughters and a son together, including &quot;The Guardian&quot; cartoonist Edith Pritchett. His wife&#x27;s sister, Benedicte, is married to Martin Newland, a former editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

<doc id="1068259" wikidata="Q328745" url="?curid=1068259" title="Harry Thompson">
<text>Harry William Thompson (6 February 1960 – 7 November 2005) was an English radio and television producer, comedy writer, novelist and biographer. He was the creator of the dark humour television series &quot;Monkey Dust&quot;, screened between 2003 and 2005.

Born in London, Thompson was educated at Highgate School and Brasenose College, Oxford, then joined the BBC as a trainee in 1981. He soon focused his attention on comedy, working as a researcher for &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot;. Rising to the level of producer, he produced the BBC radio shows &quot;The News Quiz&quot; and &quot;Lenin of the Rovers&quot;. Hat Trick Productions subsequently employed Thompson to produce a television adaptation of &quot;The News Quiz&quot;, entitled &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, a critical and commercial success which Thompson produced for five years before moving onto other projects.

A biographer and novelist, Thompson wrote six books: an investigation into the story of &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot;; a biography of Hergé with a commentary on his &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; series; biographies of Peter Cook and Richard Ingrams; a novel, &quot;This Thing of Darkness&quot;; and the semi-autobiographical &quot;Penguins Stopped Play&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life and career: 1960–1989===
Harry William Thompson was born on 6 February 1960 in London. His father was a marketing manager who worked for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, while his mother was a teacher who campaigned for higher standards in education. He attended the private, fee-paying school Highgate School before going on to study History at Brasenose College, Oxford. There he became editor of the university newspaper, &quot;Cherwell&quot;, working alongside arts editor Roly Keating, the future controller of BBC2.

Leaving university, he joined the BBC as a trainee in 1981. Here, he worked on the late-night news programme &quot;Newsnight&quot;, later commenting that it was &quot;the most awful experience of my life, full of people who barked into phones, professionally&quot;. Switching his focus to comedy, he worked as a researcher for BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and for various comedy shows on BBC Radio, including BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot;. Rising to the level of producer, he was responsible for the production of long-established show &quot;The News Quiz&quot; as well as Alexei Sayle&#x27;s new comedy series, &quot;Lenin of the Rovers&quot; (1988). &quot;The Guardian&quot; would note that at this time he established himself as &quot;a maverick&quot; who pushed established boundaries with &quot;outrageous jokes&quot;.

===Panel shows and early writing: 1990–98===
During the 1980s several independent producers realised that BBC Radio 4 had a number of comedy shows that could be successfully converted to television. Among them was the company Hat Trick Productions, who decided to adapt &quot;The News Quiz&quot; for television in 1989. Jimmy Mulville, the company&#x27;s managing director, asked Thompson to produce this venture, which first appeared in 1990 as &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot;. Thompson selected Angus Deayton to present the show, with Ian Hislop and Paul Merton as the team leaders. He oversaw the production of the show for 93 episodes over five series. He later remarked that when the show first began, he was extremely confident, considering it to be &quot;the best comedy show on TV. It never occurred to me that anything else could be better… I know it sounds arrogant&quot;. &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot; initially screened on BBC2, but proved enough of a success that by 2000 it had been moved to BBC1.

Moving on to produce other comedy panel shows, in 1995 he began work on &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot;, a BBC sports show. He followed this in 1996 by the creation of a music quiz show, &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;. In 1998 he was part of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s five-part political satire programme &quot;Cartoons, Lampoons, and Buffoons&quot;.

===Later comedy career: 1998–2005===
In 1998 Thompson produced and co-wrote the first series of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot;, where he was instrumental in the creation of the comic character Ali G, played by Sacha Baron Cohen. Thompson later wrote for spin-off &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;. Defending the humour in the show, he publicly announced that &quot;You&#x27;ll never see anything PC or right-on in my shows. I get accused quite a lot of straying into bad taste, but I think you can laugh at almost anything.&quot;

In 2003 Thompson, alongside Shaun Pye, created and wrote the adult cartoon comedy &quot;Monkey Dust&quot;. The programme was known for its dark humour and handling of taboo topics such as bestiality, murder, suicide and paedophilia. There were three series broadcast on BBC Three between 2003 and 2005; no further series were made following Thompson&#x27;s death from lung cancer. In 2003 &quot;The Observer&quot; listed him as one of the 50 funniest or most influential people in British comedy, citing &quot;Monkey Dust&quot; as evidence: &quot;the most subversive show on television. The topical animated series is dark and unafraid to tackle taboo subjects such as paedophilia, taking us to Cruel Britannia, a creepy place where the public are hoodwinked by arrogant politicians and celebrities. This edgy show doesn&#x27;t always work, but when it does there is nothing quite like it&quot;. More recently a &quot;Guardian&quot; critic called it &quot;a wonderful programme... perhaps the best thing in Thompson&#x27;s formidable CV&quot;.

Thompson&#x27;s last broadcast work was the Channel 5 sitcom &quot;Respectable&quot;, on which he finished work the week before he died. Co-written with Shaun Pye, the programme was set in a suburban brothel and aired in 2006. &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticised the programme&#x27;s &quot;woefully old-fashioned, juvenile outlook&quot; and called it &quot;drearily unsophisticated&quot;. The programme was also criticised in some quarters on the grounds that it made light of prostitution.

===Other work===
Harry Thompson also produced non-comedy documentaries for BBC Radio. He made several programmes with writer/presenter Terence Pettigrew, starting with anniversary tributes to Hollywood icons James Dean (&quot;You&#x27;re Tearing Me Apart&quot;) and Montgomery Clift (&quot;I Had The Misery Thursday&quot;). Pettigrew and Thompson subsequently worked together on a second series of documentaries, including on national service (&quot;Caught in the Draft&quot;), and also about the evacuation of children from major British cities during the Second World War (&quot;Nobody Cried When The Trains Pulled Out&quot;). Both programmes were presented by Michael Aspel.

As well as writing for television, Thompson wrote biographies of Hergé (1991), &quot;Private Eye&quot; editor Richard Ingrams (1994) (of which &quot;The Independent&quot; said, &quot;The problem is that Thompson simply worships Ingrams, and his biography melts steadily into hagiography... [an] overlong panegyric&quot;) and Peter Cook (1997). His novel &quot;This Thing of Darkness&quot;, a historical fiction about Charles Darwin and Robert FitzRoy, the captain of the &quot;Beagle&quot;, was longlisted for the Booker Prize in 2005. Thompson described Fitzroy, rather than Darwin, as the book&#x27;s hero: 
His final book, the semi-autobiographical &quot;Penguins Stopped Play&quot;, was finished in 2005; it dealt with his amateur cricket team, the Captain Scott XI, and was published posthumously in 2006.

===Personal life and death===
Thompson was married to Fiona Duff. They had two children, Betty and Bill. The breakdown of their marriage became public in 1997 when Duff wrote an article about Thompson&#x27;s affair with a 25-year-old woman (later revealed to be Victoria Coren) in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. In 2003, Thompson began a relationship with Lisa Whadcock; they met after she wrote a fan letter to him about &quot;Monkey Dust&quot;.

Despite never having been a smoker, Thompson was diagnosed with lung cancer in April 2005. He was treated at a London hospital, and married Whadcock on Monday 7 November 2005, before dying later that day. The British Comedy Awards had planned to present him with a Jury&#x27;s Award in December, with executive producer Michael Hurll stating that &quot;It&#x27;s sad he won&#x27;t be there to receive it, but the legacy of his enduringly popular series lives on&quot;. Upon learning of his death, BBC One controller Peter Fincham said Thompson was &quot;that rarity in television – the talented, single-minded, subversive maverick&quot; and that his death would &quot;leave a big hole in the comedy world&quot;. Fincham&#x27;s comments were echoed by BBC Two controller Roly Keating, who stated that &quot;Harry was a truly independent spirit and one of the funniest people I&#x27;ve ever known&quot;. His literary agent Bill Hamilton told BBC News that Thompson had been &quot;plainly a genius&quot;.

In a 2005 episode of &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot;, featuring Alexander Armstrong as host and Fi Glover and Ian McMillan as guest panellists, a message stating &quot;In Memory of Harry Thompson, the first producer of &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot; (1960–2005)&quot; was displayed.

<doc id="1068262" wikidata="Q1378670" url="?curid=1068262" title="Scrap">
<text>Scrap consists of recyclable materials, usually metals, left over from product manufacturing and consumption, such as parts of vehicles, building supplies, and surplus materials. Unlike waste, scrap can have monetary value, especially recovered metals, and non-metallic materials are also recovered for recycling. Once collected, the materials are sorted into types – typically metal scrap will be crushed, shredded, and sorted using mechanical processes.

Metal recycling, especially of structural steel, ships, used manufactured goods, such as vehicles and white goods, is an industrial activity with complex networks of wrecking yards, sorting facilities, and recycling plants. The industry includes both formal organizations and a wide range of informal roles such as waste pickers who help sorting through scrap.

==Processing==

Scrap metal originates both in business and residential environments. Typically a &quot;scrapper&quot; will advertise their services to conveniently remove scrap metal for people who don&#x27;t need it.

Scrap is often taken to a wrecking yard (also known as a scrapyard, junkyard, or breaker&#x27;s yard), where it is processed for later melting into new products. A wrecking yard, depending on its location, may allow customers to browse their lot and purchase items before they are sent to the smelters, although many scrap yards that deal in large quantities of scrap usually do not, often selling entire units such as engines or machinery by weight with no regard to their functional status. Customers are typically required to supply all of their own tools and labor to extract parts, and some scrapyards may first require waiving liability for personal injury before entering. Many scrapyards also sell bulk metals (stainless steel, etc.) by weight, often at prices substantially below the retail purchasing costs of similar pieces.

A scrap metal shredder is often used to recycle items containing a variety of other materials in combination with steel. Examples are automobiles and white goods such as refrigerators, stoves, clothes washers, etc. These items are labor-intensive to manually sort things like plastic, copper, aluminum, and brass. By shredding it into relatively small pieces, the steel can easily be separated out magnetically. The non-ferrous waste stream requires other techniques to sort.

In contrast to wrecking yards, scrapyards typically sell everything by weight, instead of by item. To the scrapyard, the primary value of the scrap is what the smelter will give them for it, rather than the value of whatever shape the metal may be in. An auto wrecker, on the other hand, would price exactly the same scrap based on what the item does, regardless of what it weighs. Typically, if a wrecker cannot sell something above the value of the metal in it, they would then take it to the scrapyard and sell it by weight. Equipment containing parts of various metals can often be purchased at a price below that of either of the metals, due to saving the scrapyard the labor of separating the metals before shipping them to be recycled.
Thieves sometimes sell stolen items to scrapyards. Copper pipes and wiring, bronze monuments and aluminium siding have all been targets of metal theft, with the number of thefts increasing as prices rise. Manhole covers have also been stolen. In the 1970s, the term &quot;newsjacking&quot; was coined to describe the theft of newspapers for sale to scrap dealers.

==Resources==

Scrap prices may vary markedly over time and in different locations. Prices are often negotiated between buyers and sellers directly or indirectly over the Internet. Prices displayed as the market prices are not the prices that recyclers will see at the scrap yards. Other prices are ranges or older and not updated frequently. Some scrap yards&#x27; websites have updated scrap prices.

In the US, scrap prices are reported in a handful of publications, including &quot;American Metal Market&quot;, based on confirmed sales as well as reference sites such as Scrap Metal Prices and Auctions. Non-US domiciled publications, such as &quot;The Steel Index&quot;, also report on the US scrap price, which has become increasingly important to global export markets. Scrap yards directories are also used by recyclers to find facilities in the US and Canada, allowing users to get in contact with yards.

With resources online for recyclers to look at for scrapping tips, like websites, blogs, and search engines, scrapping is often referred to as a hand and labor-intensive job. Taking apart and separating metals is important to making more money on scrap, tips like using a magnet to determine ferrous and non-ferrous materials can help recyclers make more money on their metal recycling. When a magnet sticks to the metal, it will be a ferrous material, like steel or iron. This is usually a less expensive item that is recycled but usually is recycled in larger quantities of thousands of pounds. Non-ferrous metals like copper, aluminum, and brass do not stick to a magnet. Some cheaper grades of stainless steel are magnetic, other grades are not. These items are higher priced commodities for metal recycling and are important to separate when recycling them. The prices of non-ferrous metals also tend to fluctuate more than ferrous metals so it is important for recyclers to pay attention to these sources and the overall markets.

== Urban mining ==

This term is used to describe the recovery of &quot;dormant&quot; materials that once served a purpose in society but have become disused since. For example, large amounts of metal are buried underground as part of the provision of basic services including telecoms. Infrastructure, buildings and equipment stored or lying dormant in this way accounted for 28% of Sweden&#x27;s copper use in 2021. In the same period, one sixth of the cables installed in Sweden&#x27;s telecoms came from harvesting via urban mining. In particular this involved copper, aluminium, iron and steel. Figures for this are issued by SGU, a Swedish government body responsible for geological survey of bedrock, soil and groundwater.

==Hazards==
Great potential exists in the scrap metal industry for accidents in which a hazardous material present in scrap causes death, injury, or environmental damage. A classic example is radioactivity in scrap; the Goiânia accident and the Mayapuri radiological accident were incidents involving radioactive materials. Toxic materials such as asbestos, and toxic metals such as beryllium, cadmium, lead and mercury may pose dangers to personnel, as well as contaminating materials intended for metal smelters.

Many specialized tools used in scrapyards are hazardous, such as the alligator shear, which cuts metal using hydraulic force, compactors, scrap metal shredder, and vacuum.

==Criticism and benefits of recycling==


According to the WHO (2023), “When e-waste is treated using inferior activities, it can release as many as 1000 different chemical substances ... including harmful … “

==Metal recycling industry==

The metal recycling industry encompasses a wide range of metals. The more frequently recycled metals are scrap steel, iron (ISS), lead, aluminum, copper, stainless steel, and zinc. Steel is the most recycled due to its sustainable properties. There are two main categories of metals: ferrous and non-ferrous. Metals that contain iron in them are known as &quot;ferrous&quot;.

Metals without iron are &quot;non-ferrous&quot;.
* Common non-ferrous metals are copper, brass, aluminum, zinc, magnesium, tin, nickel, and lead.
*Usable coins can be deposited in banks. Damaged US coins can be redeemed for money via the Mutilated Coin Redemption Program.

Non-ferrous metals also include precious and exotic metals:
* Precious metals are metals with a high market value in any form, such as gold, silver, and platinum group metals.
*Exotic metals contain rare elements such as cobalt, mercury, titanium, tungsten, arsenic, beryllium, bismuth, cerium, cadmium, niobium, indium, gallium, germanium, lithium, selenium, tantalum, tellurium, vanadium, and zirconium. Some types of metals are radioactive. These may be &quot;naturally occurring&quot; or formed by nuclear reactions. Metals that have been exposed to radioactive sources may also become radioactive in settings such as medical environments, research laboratories, and nuclear power plants.

OSHA guidelines should be followed when recycling any type of scrap metal to ensure safety.

==Ferrous metal recycling==

Ferrous metals are able to be recycled, with steel being one of the most recycled materials in the world. Ferrous metals contain an appreciable percentage of iron and the addition of carbon and other substances creates steel. Iron is also commonly recycled, since it is a ferrous metal. 

===Description===
In the United States, steel containers, cans, automobiles, appliances, and construction materials contribute the greatest weight of recycled materials. For example, in 2008, more than 97% of structural steel and 106% of automobiles were recycled, comparing the current steel consumption for each industry with the amount of recycled steel being produced (the late 2000s recession and the associated sharp decline in automobile production in the US explains the over-100% calculation). A typical appliance is about 75% steel by weight and automobiles are about 65% steel and iron.

The steel industry has been actively recycling for more than 150 years, in large part because it is economically advantageous to do so. It is cheaper to recycle steel than to mine iron ore and manipulate it through the production process to form new steel. Steel does not lose any of its inherent physical properties during the recycling process, and has drastically reduced energy and material requirements compared with refinement from iron ore. The energy saved by recycling reduces the annual energy consumption of the industry by about 75%, which is enough to power eighteen million homes for one year. According to the International Resource Panel&#x27;s Metal Stocks in Society report, the per capita stock of steel in use in Australia, Canada, the European Union EU15, Norway, Switzerland, Japan, New Zealand, and the US combined is (about 860 million people in 2005).

Basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS) uses 25–35% recycled steel to make new steel. BOS steel usually contains lower concentrations of residual elements such as copper, nickel, and molybdenum, and is, therefore more malleable than electric arc furnace (EAF) steel, and is often used to make automotive fenders, tin cans, industrial drums, or any product with a large degree of cold working. EAF steelmaking uses almost 100% recycled steel. This steel contains greater concentrations of residual elements that cannot be removed through the application of oxygen and lime. It is used to make structural beams, plates, reinforcing bar, and other products that require little cold working. Downcycling of steel by hard-to-separate impurities such as copper or tin can only be prevented by well-aimed scrap selection or dilution by pure steel. Recycling one metric ton (1,000 kilograms) of steel saves 1.1 metric tons of iron ore, 630 kilograms of coal, and 55 kilograms of limestone.

===Types of scrap used in steelmaking===
*Heavy melting steel – Industrial or commercial scrap steel greater than 6 mm thick, such as plates, beams, columns, channels; may also include scrap machinery or implements or certain metal stampings
*Old car bodies – Vehicles with or without interiors and their original wheels
*Cast iron – Cast iron bathtubs, machinery, pipe, and engine blocks
*Pressing steel – Domestic scrap metal up to approx. thick. Examples – &quot;White goods&quot; (fridges, washing machines, etc.), roofing iron, water heaters, water tanks, and sheet metal offcuts
*Reinforcing bars or mesh – Used in the construction industry within concrete structures
*Turnings – Remains of drilling or shaping steels. Also known as &quot;borings&quot; or &quot;swarf&quot;
*Manganese steel – Non-magnetic, hardened steel used in the mining industry, cement mixers, rock crushers, and other high-impact and abrasive environments.
*Rails – Rail or tram tracks

===Ship breaking===
The hulls of ships, with any usable equipment salvaged and removed, can be broken up to provide scrap steel. For a time countries in south Asia carried out most shipbreaking, often using manual methods that were hazardous to workers and the environment. International regulations now dictate the treatment of old ships as sources of hazardous waste, so shipbreaking has returned to ports in more developed countries. In 2013, about 29 million tons of scrap steel were recovered from broken ships. Some of the scrap can be reheated and rolled to make products such as concrete reinforcing bars, or the scrap may be melted to make new steel.

==Economic role==
===United States===

The scrap industry was valued at more than $90 billion in 2012, up from $54 billion in 2009 balance of trade, exporting $28 billion in scrap commodities to 160 countries. Since 2010, the industry has added more than 15,000 jobs and supports 463,000 workers, both directly and indirectly. In addition, it generates more than $10 billion in revenue for federal, state, and local governments. Scrap recycling also helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserves energy and natural resources. For example, scrap recycling diverts of materials away from landfills. Recycled scrap is a raw material feedstock for nearly 60% of steel made in the US, almost 50% of the copper and copper alloys produced in the US, more than 75% of the US paper industry&#x27;s needs, and for 50% of US aluminum. Recycled scrap helps keep air and water cleaner by removing potentially hazardous materials and keeping them out of landfills.

<text>The Belgian official journal (, , ) is the official journal or gazette of the Kingdom of Belgium. It is where the official publication of laws, royal decrees, decrees, ordinances, and official notices are published. The publication is handled by the Federal Public Service Justice.

==Content and history==
Any new law or changes to it made by the government can only take effect once it has been published in the &quot;Staatsblad&quot;/&quot;Moniteur&quot;. Other legal formalities about which the Belgian people need to be informed, including activities such as starting a business, are also published in this paper. Also published are Court mournings after important deaths, and official banquets at Court, with transcripts of speeches.

The journal was established on 16 June 1831. During World War II, the journal was published separately but under the same title by both the Belgian government in exile and the occupying authority. In order to distinguish between the two, the government-in-exile version is retrospectively entitled Belgian Official Journal (Exile Government). To save money, the paper version of the &quot;Staatsblad&quot;/&quot;Moniteur&quot; was replaced by an electronic equivalent in 2003, which is available to the public on the Internet. Three copies of every issue are still printed: one for the Royal Library, one for the Senate and one for the House of Representatives.

<doc id="1068269" wikidata="Q174818" url="?curid=1068269" title="USS Hyman G. Rickover (SSN-709)">
<text>USS &quot;Hyman G. Rickover&quot; (SSN-709), a , was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, pioneer of the nuclear Navy, and the only &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarine not named after a United States city or town. She was initially to be named USS &quot;Providence&quot;; however, following the retirement of Admiral Rickover, her name was reassigned prior to official christening. SSN-719 was later given the name USS &quot;Providence&quot;.

The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 10 December 1973 and her keel was laid down on 24 July 1981. She was launched on 27 August 1983 sponsored by the Admiral&#x27;s wife, Mrs. Eleonore Ann Bednowicz Rickover. &quot;Hyman G. Rickover&quot; was commissioned on 21 July 1984.

==Ship&#x27;s crest==
The ship&#x27;s crest was designed by the wife of a former crewmember, it symbolically represents Admiral Rickover and the boat.

The four white stars symbolize Admiral Rickover&#x27;s rank upon retirement. The submarine&#x27;s upward angle represents seeking out our nation&#x27;s enemies. The nuclear power symbol is a reminder that Admiral Rickover is father of the nuclear Navy, and the motto, &quot;Committed to Excellence&quot; symbolizes the Admiral&#x27;s 64 years of active naval service.

==Service==
During the months of January through April 1984 &quot;Hyman G. Rickover&quot; was nearing the completion of her construction. The initial manning was completed in January. Initial criticality of the ship&#x27;s S6G reactor was achieved on 10 March 1984. Berthing and messing areas were completed in April and, on 23 April 1984, the crew moved aboard the ship. A special meal of ribeye steaks, baked potatoes, and corn on the cob was served to remember the occasion.

The ship was placed into service on 24 April 1984 and initial sea trials began on 16 May 1984 with Admiral Kinnaird R. McKee aboard. Admiral McKee served as Director of the Office of Naval Nuclear Propulsion, United States Department of Energy. The sea trials were completed smartly and in the shortest time ever for a 688-class submarine built at Electric Boat. Admiral McKee complimented the crew on their fine performance prior to his departure.

At exactly 12:08, 21 July 1984 &quot;Hyman G. Rickover&quot; was placed in commission by the commissioning officer Vice Admiral Bernard M. Kauderer, Commander Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. The ceremony was held in a downpour at Submarine Base Groton, Conn., and was well attended despite the weather and the one-hour delay due to the late arrival of U.S. Representative Charles E. Bennett of Florida, the principal speaker.

&quot;Hyman G. Rickover&quot; was featured prominently in the documentary &quot;Submarine: Steel Boats-Iron Men&quot; filmed in 1989 and aired in November 1991.

&quot;Hyman G. Rickover&quot; was inactivated on 14 December 2006 and was transported to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, in 2007 for the year-long inactivation process. &quot;Hyman G. Rickover&quot; was decommissioned in 2007, with the crew departing for the final time on 17 December 2007. The submarine was towed the next year to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, where she remains moored until dismantlement and disposal, which is scheduled for 2016.

<doc id="1068282" wikidata="Q1155331" url="?curid=1068282" title="His Majesty's Theatre, London">
<text>His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre is a West End theatre situated in the Haymarket in the City of Westminster, London. The building, designed by Charles J. Phipps, was constructed in 1897 for the actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree, who established the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) at the theatre. In the early decades of the 20th century Tree produced spectacular productions of Shakespeare and other classical works, and the theatre hosted premieres by such playwrights as Bernard Shaw, J. M. Synge and, later, Noël Coward and J. B. Priestley. Since the First World War the wide stage has made the theatre suitable for large-scale musical productions, and His Majesty&#x27;s has accordingly specialised in hosting musicals. It has been home to record-setting musical theatre runs such as the First World War hit &quot;Chu Chin Chow&quot; and Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, which has run at His Majesty&#x27;s since 1986, except during the COVID-19 pandemic theatre closures.

The first theatre on the site was established in 1705 by the architect and playwright John Vanbrugh as the Queen&#x27;s Theatre. Legitimate drama unaccompanied by music was prohibited by law in all but the two London patent theatres, and the theatre quickly became an opera house. Between 1711 and 1739 more than 25 operas by George Frideric Handel premiered here. The theatre burnt down in 1789, and a new theatre was completed in 1791. Some of Joseph Haydn&#x27;s series of concerts in London took place at the theatre in the 1790s. In the early 19th century the theatre was home to an opera company (which moved to the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, in 1847) presenting the first London performances of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;, &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. It also hosted the ballet of Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in the mid-19th century, before returning to opera with the London premieres of such works as Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; and Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; cycle. A third building was constructed in 1868. 

The theatre&#x27;s capacity is 1,216 seats, and the building was Grade II* listed by English Heritage in 1970. LW Theatres has owned the building since 2000. The land beneath it is on a long-term lease from the Crown Estate. The name of the theatre changes with the gender of the monarch. Throughout the reign of Queen Victoria it was called &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre&quot;, changing to His Majesty&#x27;s on the accession of Edward VII in 1901. In 1952 the theatre again became Her Majesty&#x27;s on the accession of Elizabeth II. On 6 May 2023, the name reverted to &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre&quot; following the accession of Charles III the previous year.

== Background ==

There have been four theatres on the site, at the junction of the Haymarket and Charles II Street in the West End of London. The first opened as the Queen&#x27;s Theatre on 9 April 1705. In the late 17th century there were two patent theatre companies, who were the only performers permitted by law to stage plays without music. They had been brought together as the United Company at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, built in 1663, but there were continual disagreements between the actors and their manager, Christopher Rich. In 1695 some of the actors broke away and set up a rival company at the Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields Theatre, managed by Thomas Betterton. The company did not prosper at that theatre, and in 1703 the dramatist and architect John Vanbrugh acquired a former stable yard, at a cost of £2,000, for the construction of a new theatre in the Haymarket. He was joined in the enterprise by his principal associate and manager William Congreve and Betterton&#x27;s company. To build the theatre, Vanbrugh raised the money by subscription, possibly among members of the Kit-Cat Club. According to Colley Cibber:

== Vanbrugh&#x27;s theatre: 1705–1789 ==
The land for the theatre was held on a lease renewable in 1740; the freeholder was, and remains, the Crown Estate. Building was delayed by the necessity of acquiring the street frontage, and a three-bay entrance led to a brick shell long and wide. Cibber described the audience fittings as lavish but the facilities for playing poor.

Vanbrugh and Congreve received Queen Anne&#x27;s authority to form &quot;a Company of Comedians&quot; on 14 December 1704, and the theatre opened as the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in April 1705 with imported Italian singers in &quot;Gli amori d&#x27;Ergasto&quot; (&quot;The Loves of Ergasto&quot;), a pastoral opera by Jakob Greber, with an epilogue by Congreve. This was the first opera sung in Italian in London. Later in the season Vanbrugh presented a comedy, &quot;The Confederacy&quot;, in which Thomas Doggett, later known for Doggett&#x27;s Coat and Badge, scored one of his greatest successes, but overall, the season was a failure. The theatre proved too large for actors&#x27; voices to carry across the auditorium: according to a contemporary account, &quot;the convenience of a good theatre has been sacrificed to exhibit a triumphal piece of architecture ... not one word can be distinctly heard&quot;. Another obstacle to success was that in the early 18th century the new theatre was too far from the homes of its potential patrons. Cibber commented that the City, the Inns of Court, and the middle part of the town, from which much of the clientele of theatres came, were not within easy walking distance, and for those in the cheaper seats, &quot;Coach hire is often too hard a Tax upon the Pit and the Gallery&quot;.

Congreve departed and Vanbrugh bought out his other partners. As he became progressively more involved in the construction of Blenheim Palace, his management of the theatre became increasingly chaotic, showing &quot;numerous signs of confusion, inefficiency, missed opportunities, and bad judgement&quot;. In May 1707, experiencing mounting losses and running costs, he sold a fourteen-year lease on the theatre to Owen Swiny and gave up active management of the theatre. The theatre was not licensed to present non-musical plays, and in 1708 the authorities enforced that provision. The actors moved to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and Queen&#x27;s Theatre concentrated on opera.
Some performances of plays at Queen&#x27;s were licensed in 1709 by the Lord Chamberlain, and the theatre&#x27;s acoustics were altered to better support drama. After 1709, however, the theatre was devoted to Italian opera and was sometimes referred to as the Haymarket Opera House. The young George Frideric Handel made his English début with his opera &quot;Rinaldo&quot;, on 24 February 1711 at the theatre, featuring the two leading castrato singers of the era, Nicolo Grimaldi and Valentino Urbani. This was the first Italian opera composed specifically for the London stage. The work was well received, achieving a run, substantial for the time, of fifteen performances. Handel immediately became the most popular composer in London, but he left soon after the close of the opera season in June 1711 to take up an appointment in Hanover. Losses at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre continued, and Swiny fled abroad to escape his creditors. John James Heidegger took over the management of the theatre and, from 1719, began to extend the stage through arches into the houses to the south of the theatre. A &quot;Royal Academy of Music&quot; was formed by subscription from wealthy sponsors, including the Prince of Wales, to support Handel&#x27;s productions at the theatre. Under this sponsorship Handel conducted a series of more than twenty-five of his original operas, continuing until 1739. Handel was a partner in the management with Heidegger from 1729 to 1734, and he contributed incidental music for the theatre, including that for a revival of Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, opening on 14 January 1710.

On the accession of George I in 1714 the theatre was renamed the King&#x27;s Theatre (and remained so named during the succession of male monarchs who occupied the throne until 1837). The two patent theatres remained the only ones permitted to perform dramas unaccompanied by music in London, and lacking letters patent, the theatre remained associated with opera. In 1762 Johann Christian Bach travelled to London to premiere three operas at the theatre, including &quot;Orione&quot; on 19 February 1763. This established his reputation in England, and he became music master to Queen Charlotte.

===Sheridan===
In 1778 the lease for the theatre was transferred from James Brook to Thomas Harris, stage manager of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, and to the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan for £22,000. They paid for the remodelling of the interior by Robert Adam in the same year. In November 1778, &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot; reported that Harris and Sheridan had:

The expense of the improvements was not matched by the box office receipts, and the partnership dissolved; Sheridan took a mortgage on the theatre of £12,000 from the banker Henry Hoare to buy out his partner.

One member of the company, Giovanni Gallini, had made his début at the theatre in 1753 and had risen to the position of dancing master, gaining an international reputation. He had tried to buy Harris&#x27;s share but had been rebuffed. He now purchased the mortgage. Sheridan quickly became bankrupt after placing the financial affairs of the theatre in the hands of William Taylor, a lawyer. The next few years saw a struggle for control of the theatre and Taylor bought Sheridan&#x27;s interest in 1781. In 1782 the theatre was remodelled by Michael Novosielski, formerly a scene painter at the theatre. In May 1783 Taylor was arrested by his creditors, and a forced sale ensued, at which Harris purchased the lease and much of the effects. Further legal action transferred the interests in the theatre to a board of trustees, including Novosielski. The trustees acted with a flagrant disregard for the needs of the theatre or other creditors, seeking only to enrich themselves, and in August 1785 the Lord Chamberlain took over the running of the enterprise, in the interests of the creditors. Gallini, meanwhile, had become manager. In 1788 the Lord Chancellor observed &quot;that there appeared in all the proceedings respecting this business, a wish of distressing the property, and that it would probably be consumed in that very court to which ... [the interested parties] seemed to apply for relief&quot;. Performances suffered, with the box receipts taken by Novosielski, rather than given to Gallini to run the house. Money continued to be squandered on endless litigation or was misappropriated. Gallini tried to keep the theatre going, but he was forced to employ amateur performers. &quot;The World&quot; described a performance: &quot;... the Dance, if such it can be called was like the movements of heavy Cavalry. It was hissed very abundantly&quot;. On another occasion Gallini had to defend himself against a dissatisfied audience who charged the stage and destroyed the fittings, as the company ran for their lives.

===Fire===
The theatre burnt down on 17 June 1789 during evening rehearsals, and the dancers fled the building as beams fell on the stage. The fire had been deliberately set on the roof, and Gallini offered a reward of £300 for capture of the culprit. With the theatre destroyed, each group laid its own plans for a replacement. Gallini obtained a licence from the Lord Chamberlain to perform opera at the nearby Little Theatre, and he entered into a partnership with R. B. O&#x27;Reilly to obtain land in Leicester Fields for a new building, which would require another licence. The two quarrelled, and each planned to wrest control of the venture from the other. The authorities refused to grant either of them a patent for Leicester Fields, but O&#x27;Reilly was granted a licence for four years to present opera at the Oxford Street Pantheon (which burned to the ground in 1792). Meanwhile, Taylor reached an agreement with the creditors of the King&#x27;s Theatre and attempted to buy the remainder of the lease from Edward Vanbrugh, but this was now promised to O&#x27;Reilly. A further complication arose as the theatre needed to expand into adjacent land that now came into the possession of a Taylor supporter. The scene was set for a further war of attrition between the lessees, but at this point O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s first season at the Pantheon failed miserably, and he fled to Paris to avoid his creditors.

By 1720 Vanbrugh&#x27;s direct connection with the theatre had been terminated, but the leases and rents had been transferred to both his own family and that of his wife&#x27;s through a series of trusts and benefices. After the fire the Vanbrugh family&#x27;s long association with the theatre was terminated, and all their leases were surrendered by 1792.

== Second theatre: 1791–1867 ==

Taylor completed a new theatre on the site in 1791. According to the theatre historians Mander and Mitchenson: &quot;it was at the time the largest theatre in England; it was generally regarded as one of the most resplendent theatres in the world&quot;. Novosielski had again been chosen as architect for the theatre on an enlarged site; the building was described by Malcolm in 1807 as

The Lord Chamberlain, a supporter of O&#x27;Reilly, refused a performing licence to Taylor. The theatre opened on 26 March 1791 with a private performance of song and dance entertainment, but it was not allowed to open to the public. The new theatre was heavily indebted and spanned separate plots of land that were leased to Taylor by four different owners on differing terms. As a later manager of the theatre wrote, &quot;In the history of property, there has probably been no parallel instance wherein the legal labyrinth has been so difficult to thread.&quot; Meetings were held at Carlton House and Bedford House attempting to reconcile the parties. On 24 August 1792 a General Opera Trust Deed was signed by the parties. The general management of the theatre was to be entrusted to a committee of noblemen, appointed by the Prince of Wales, who would then appoint a general manager. Funds would be disbursed from the profits to compensate the creditors of both the King&#x27;s Theatre and the Pantheon. The committee never met, and management devolved to Taylor.

=== William Taylor ===
The first public performance of opera in the new house was on 26 January 1793, the dispute with the Lord Chamberlain over the licence having been settled. The King&#x27;s Theatre became the home of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane company while its theatre was being rebuilt.

From 1793 seven small houses at the east side of the theatre fronting on the Haymarket were demolished and replaced by a large concert room attached to the theatre. It was in this room that Joseph Haydn gave a series of concerts, in association with the impresario Johann Peter Salomon, on his second visit to London in 1794–95. For this second London season he conducted the last six of his 104 symphonies. The final three were premiered at the concert room of the King&#x27;s Theatre. During the performance of one of them, No. 102, a chandelier fell from the ceiling and crashed into the auditorium below. There were no serious injuries, and there were shouts of &quot;miracle, miracle&quot; from the audience.

With the departure of the Drury Lane company in 1794 the theatre returned to opera, hosting the first London performances of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; in 1806, &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; and &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; in 1811, and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; in 1816. Between 1816 and 1818, John Nash and George Repton made alterations to the façade and increased the capacity of the auditorium to 2,500. They also added a shopping arcade, called the Royal Opera Arcade, which has survived fires and renovations and still exists. It runs along the rear of the theatre. Between 1818 and 1820 the British premieres of Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s operas &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot;, &quot;Elisabetta, regina d&#x27;Inghilterra&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot;, &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; and &quot;Tancredi&quot; took place in the theatre.
In 1797 Taylor was elected as member of Parliament for Leominster, a position that gave him immunity from his creditors. When that parliament dissolved in 1802 he fled to France. Later he returned, and was member of Parliament for Barnstaple from 1806 to 1812 while continuing his association with the theatre.

=== John Ebers ===
John Ebers, a bookseller, took over the management of the theatre in 1821, and seven more London premieres of Rossini operas (&quot;La gazza ladra&quot;, &quot;Il turco in Italia&quot;, &quot;Mosè in Egitto&quot;, &quot;Otello&quot;, &quot;La donna del lago&quot;, &quot;Matilde di Shabran&quot; and &quot;Ricciardo e Zoraide&quot;) took place there in the following three years. Ebers sublet the theatre to Giambattista Benelli in 1824, and Rossini was invited to conduct, remaining for a five-month season, with his wife Isabella Colbran performing. Two more of his operas, &quot;Zelmira&quot; and &quot;Semiramide&quot;, received their British premieres during the season, but there was public complaint about Rossini&#x27;s failure to provide a new opera, as promised. Benelli had defaulted on his contract and absconded without paying either the composer or the artists, but this was not known to the London press and public, who blamed Rossini.

Ebers engaged Giuditta Pasta for the 1825 season, but he became involved in lawsuits which, combined with a large increase in the rent of the theatre, forced him into bankruptcy, after which he returned to his bookselling business.

=== Pierre François Laporte ===

In 1828 Ebers was succeeded as theatre manager by Pierre François Laporte, who held the position (with a brief gap in 1831–1833) until his death in 1841. Two of Rossini&#x27;s Paris operas (&quot;Le comte Ory&quot; and &quot;Le siège de Corinthe&quot;) had their British premieres at the theatre during this period, and Laporte was also the first to introduce the operas of Vincenzo Bellini (&quot;La sonnambula, Norma&quot; and &quot;I puritani&quot;) and Gaetano Donizetti (&quot;Anna Bolena, Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; and &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot;) to the British public. Under Laporte singers such as Giulia Grisi, Pauline Viardot, Giovanni Battista Rubini, Luigi Lablache and Mario made their London stage débuts at the theatre. Among the musical directors of this period was Nicolas Bochsa, the celebrated and eccentric French harpist. He was appointed in 1827 and remained for six years at this position. 

When Queen Victoria ascended the throne in 1837 the name of the theatre was changed to Her Majesty&#x27;s Italian Opera House. In the same year Samuel Phelps made his London début as Shylock in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; at the theatre, also playing in other Shakespearean plays there. In 1863 Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;Colombe&#x27;s Birthday&quot; played at the theatre. &quot;The Morning Post&quot; described it as &quot;a delicate wreath of poetic flowers&quot;, too subtle for theatregoers accustomed to coarser offerings, and it was not a success.

In 1841 disputes arose over Laporte&#x27;s decision to replace the baritone Antonio Tamburini with a new singer, Colletti. The audience stormed the stage, and the performers formed &quot;a revolutionary conspiracy&quot;. A London newspaper described the incident as &quot;one of the most disgraceful scenes that ever occurred within the walls of any theatre&quot;.

=== Benjamin Lumley ===

Laporte died suddenly, and Benjamin Lumley took over the management in 1842, introducing London audiences to Donizetti&#x27;s late operas, &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; and &quot;La fille du régiment&quot;. Initially, relations were good between Lumley and Michael Costa, the principal conductor at Her Majesty&#x27;s, but they later deteriorated. Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Ernani&quot;, and &quot;Nabucco&quot;, and &quot;I Lombardi&quot; received their British premieres in 1845–46, and Lumley commissioned &quot;I masnadieri&quot; from the composer. It received its world premiere on 22 July 1847, with the Swedish diva Jenny Lind in the star role of Amalia. The British premieres of two more Verdi operas, &quot;I due Foscari&quot; and &quot;Attila&quot;, followed in 1847–48. Lind&#x27;s success was so great that it became known as &quot;Lind mania&quot;, but other performers felt neglected, and disputes continued. In 1847 Costa finally transferred his opera company to the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden; the law allowing only the patent companies to perform straight plays had been repealed in 1843, and although opera continued to be an important part of the repertoire at Her Majesty&#x27;s, a wider range of productions was now possible.

Lind&#x27;s retirement from opera in 1849 was a blow to Lumley, but the appearance of the Cuban singer Donna Maria Martinez at the theatre in July 1850 was the subject of much attention from the press. She was dubbed &quot;the Black Malibran&quot; and was &quot;vehemently applauded and encouraged&quot;, but she did not prove a sustained draw, and the highlight of the 1850 season was the premiere of Halévy&#x27;s Shakespearean opera &quot;La Tempesta&quot;. The critics were moderately impressed by the music, though there was some regret that Mendelssohn had not lived to compose the work, as originally planned; the audiences were enthusiastic, and there was tumultuous applause for the composer, librettist, stars, conductor and impresario. 

Mander and Mitchenson describe 1851 as &quot;the last season of operatic prosperity for Her Majesty&#x27;s&quot;. The orchestra seceded to Covent Garden in 1852 and the theatre closed until 1856, when a fire shut down its rival. After the reopening of Her Majesty&#x27;s Lumley presented two more British premieres of Verdi operas: &quot;La traviata&quot; in 1856 and &quot;Luisa Miller&quot; in 1858.

===Ballet===
Ballet played an important part at Her Majesty&#x27;s in the mid-19th century. From the early 1830s until the late 1840s the theatre was known for staging romantic ballet. The celebrated ballet master Jules Perrot began staging ballet at Her Majesty&#x27;s in 1830. Lumley appointed him &quot;Premier Maître de Ballet&quot; (chief choreographer) to the theatre in 1842. The ballet historian Ivor Guest writes, &quot;probably never before or since has there been a more brilliant period in the history of the ballet than those years when [Perrot] was ballet-master at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre&quot;. Among the ballets he staged were &quot;Ondine, ou La Naïade&quot; (1843), &quot;La Esmeralda&quot; (1844), and &quot;Catarina, ou La Fille du Bandit&quot; (1846), as well as the celebrated divertissement &quot;Pas de Quatre&quot; (1845). Other ballet masters created works for the ballet of Her Majesty&#x27;s throughout the period of the romantic ballet, most notably Paul Taglioni (son of Filippo Taglioni), who staged ballets including &quot;Coralia, ou Le Chevalier inconstant&quot; (1847) and &quot;Electra&quot; (1849, the first production of a ballet to make use of electric lighting).

The Italian composer Cesare Pugni was appointed &quot;Composer of the Ballet Music&quot; to the theatre in 1843, a position created for him by Lumley. Between 1843 and 1850 he wrote the music for most of the new ballets presented at the theatre. Throughout the era of the romantic ballet the theatre presented performances by celebrated ballerinas, including Fanny Cerrito, Fanny Elssler, Lucile Grahn, Carlotta Grisi, Lola Montez and Marie Taglioni.

=== J. H. Mapleson ===

From 1862 to 1867 the theatre was managed by J. H. Mapleson. He presented Italian, French and German opera, including the British premieres of &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, &quot;Médée&quot;, &quot;Faust&quot;, &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot; and &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, and promoted such singers as Mario, Giulia Grisi, De Murska, Thérèse Tietjens, Antonio Giuglini, Charles Santley and Christine Nilsson.

On the night of 6 December 1867 the theatre was destroyed by fire, thought to have been caused by an overheated stove. Only the bare walls of the theatre remained, and most of the adjacent shops in Pall Mall, and the Clergy Club hotel in Charles Street (now called Charles II Street), suffered damage of varying severity. After the destruction of the theatre Mapleson took his company to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.

== Third theatre: 1868–1896 ==
A third building was constructed in 1868 at a cost of £50,000, within the shell of the old theatre, for Lord Dudley. It was designed by Charles Lee and Sons and their partner, William Pain, and built by George Trollope and Sons. The designers had taken over John Nash&#x27;s practice on his retirement. The new theatre was designed to be less susceptible to fire, with brick firewalls, iron roof trusses and Dennett&#x27;s patent gypsum-cement floors. The auditorium had four tiers, with a stage large enough for the greatest spectaculars. For opera, the theatre seated 1,890, and for plays, with the orchestra pit removed, 2,500. As a result of a dispute over the rent between Dudley and Mapleson, and a decline in the popularity of ballet, the theatre remained dark until 1874, when it was sold to a Revivalist Christian movement.

Mapleson returned to Her Majesty&#x27;s in 1877 and 1878, after a disastrous attempt to build a 2,000-seat National Opera House on a site subsequently used for the building of Scotland Yard. All the fittings of the theatre had been removed, including the seats, carpets and even the wallpaper. £6,000 was spent on fitting out the theatre, and on 28 April 1877 it returned to theatrical use with a revival of Bellini&#x27;s opera &quot;Norma&quot;. The London premiere of Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; was given at the theatre on 22 June 1878, and the house hosted the Carl Rosa Opera Company in seasons from 1879 to 1882.

Haverly&#x27;s United Mastodon Minstrels played a season in 1880; a dramatisation of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; was seen in 1882; and the first complete performances in England of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; were given at Her Majesty&#x27;s in 1882. The tetralogy was presented twice: the first cycle was well attended, the second less so. &quot;The Musical Times&quot; congratulated the impresario Angelo Neumann on his enterprise in staging the cycle, but regretfully predicted a substantial financial loss for the production.

Sarah Bernhardt appeared at the theatre in &quot;La dame aux camelias&quot; in 1886. Mapleson returned in 1887 and 1889, but &quot;The Times&quot; observed that his repertoire comprised &quot;works that had long ceased to attract a large public, the singers were exclusively of second-rate quality, and the standard of performance was extremely low&quot;. Mander and Mitchenson comment that in 1889 the house was even the scene of a boxing tournament. Over Christmas seasons pantomimes were staged; after one such – &quot;Cinderella&quot;, starring Minnie Palmer – the theatre closed in 1890. Its owners were insolvent and the courts ordered the sale of the building and its contents. One of the last things seen in the third theatre was another season by Bernhardt, in which she appeared as Joan of Arc in a play by Jules Barbier, and as Marguerite in a revival of &quot;La dame aux camelias&quot;. 

With the rapid advances in theatre technology made since the 1860s, the third theatre quickly became outmoded, and the sub-lease of the theatre, still held by the Dudley family, was due to expire in 1891. The Commissioners of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues (forerunners of the Crown Estate) desired the entire block on which the theatre stood to be rebuilt, except for the Royal Arcade, where the lease did not expire until 1912. Problems were encountered in obtaining all the buildings and in financing the scheme, but the theatre and surrounding buildings were demolished in 1892. When the demolition of the building was about to begin &quot;The Times&quot; commented:
== Fourth theatre: 1897–present ==

Plans were commissioned from the architect Charles J. Phipps for a theatre and a hotel. In February 1896 an agreement was reached with the actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree for the erection of the theatre at an estimated cost of £55,000. Provisional plans were submitted in March 1896 and approved in February 1897; meanwhile, on 16 July 1896 the foundation stone of the new theatre was laid. The theatre opened in April 1897. Phipps died the following month; the theatre was his last work. After the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, the theatre&#x27;s name reverted to His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre.

=== Architecture ===
The theatre was designed as a symmetrical pair with the Carlton Hotel and restaurant on the adjacent site. The frontage formed three parts, each of nine bays. The hotel occupied two parts, the theatre one, and the two buildings were unified by a cornice above the ground floor. The buildings rose to four storeys, with attic floors above, surmounted by large squared domes in a style inspired by the French Renaissance. The theatre has a Corinthian colonnade at the first floor, rising to the second, forming a loggia in front of the circle foyer. This is above a canopy over the main ground floor entrances. The theatre lies on an east–west axis. The stage at the western end was deep and wide, reputedly the first British stage to be flat, rather than raked.

The interior of the new theatre was designed by the consulting architect, W. H. Romaine-Walker, in a style drawing on that of the Royal Opera of Versailles by Gabriel. The stalls and pit were entered at ground level, with two partly cantilevered tiers above accommodating dress and family circles on the first level, and upper circle, amphitheatre and gallery on the tier above. In all, there were 1,319 seats. Contemporary opinion was critical of the project. Edwin Sachs wrote in his 1897 guide to theatres, &quot;The treatment is considered to be in the French Renaissance style and stone has been used throughout. The detail cannot, however, be termed satisfactory, nor does the exterior architecturally express the purpose of the building.&quot;

Later opinion of the theatre has been more favourable: English Heritage describes the building as both Phipps&#x27;s finest work and one of the best planned theatres in London. The building was Grade II* listed in January 1970. The adjacent hotel was severely damaged by bombing in the Second World War and was demolished in 1957–58, replaced by the new High Commission for New Zealand (New Zealand House), completed in 1963 (now, like the theatre, a Grade II listed building). The 200-year-old Royal Opera Arcade, built by Nash and Repton, is all that survives of the second theatre and is one of the earliest examples of a London arcade.

=== Performance ===

The current theatre opened on 28 April 1897. Tree built the theatre with profits from his tremendous success at the Haymarket Theatre, and he owned, managed and lived in the theatre from its construction until his death in 1917. For his personal use, he had a banqueting hall and living room installed in the massive, central, square French-style dome. 

The theatre opened with a dramatisation of Gilbert Parker&#x27;s &quot;The Seats of the Mighty&quot;. Adaptations of novels by Dickens, Tolstoy, and others formed a substantial part of the repertoire, along with classical works by Molière and others. Tree presented the world premiere of J. M. Synge&#x27;s &quot;The Tinker&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, and the British premiere of Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, in which he starred with Mrs Patrick Campbell, in 1914. Above all, Tree was known for his Shakespeare productions. His longest-running of these was &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, which had a record-breaking run of 254 consecutive performances from September 1910 to April 1911. His biographer B. A. Kachur writes: 
His Majesty&#x27;s no longer specialised in opera, but there were occasional operatic presentations in its early years, including seasons given by the conductor Thomas Beecham, in which the British premiere of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; was presented, as well as revivals – then rare – of Mozart&#x27;s operas, &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; and &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;.

In 1904 Tree founded the Academy of Dramatic Art (later RADA), which spent a year based in the theatre before moving in 1905 to Gower Street in Bloomsbury. Tree continued to take graduates of the Academy into his company at His Majesty&#x27;s, employing some forty actors in this way by 1911.
The facilities of the theatre lent themselves to the new genre of musical theatre, and Percy Fletcher was appointed musical director in 1915, a post he held for the next 17 years, until his death. &quot;Chu Chin Chow&quot; opened in 1916 and ran for a world record 2,235 performances (almost twice as long as the previous record for musical theatre – a record that it held until surpassed by &quot;Salad Days&quot;, which opened in 1954). Music and drama were combined in Basil Dean&#x27;s 1923 production of James Elroy Flecker&#x27;s verse play &quot;Hassan&quot;, with music by Frederick Delius, which ran for 281 performances.

George and Ira Gershwin&#x27;s musical &quot;Oh, Kay!&quot; had its London premiere at His Majesty&#x27;s on 21 September 1927, starring Gertrude Lawrence and John Kirby; with 213 performances it failed to equal the Broadway run of 256. Noël Coward&#x27;s operetta &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; enjoyed a run of 697 performances beginning on 18 July 1929. &quot;The Good Companions&quot;, a dramatisation by J. B. Priestley of his novel, premiered on 14 May 1931 and ran for 331 performances.

In the years after the Second World War, musicals continued to dominate at the theatre; they included transfers of the successful Broadway productions &quot;Follow the Girls&quot; (1945; 572 performances) and the Lerner and Loewe musicals &quot;Brigadoon&quot; (1949; 685 performances) and &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot; (1953; 477 performances). Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;West Side Story&quot; opened in December 1958 for a run of 1,040 performances, transferring from Broadway via the Manchester Opera House. 

The London premiere of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; was on 16 February 1967, starring Chaim Topol, and the production ran at Her Majesty&#x27;s for 2,030 performances. Forty years after the first stage adaptation of Priestley&#x27;s novel, André Previn&#x27;s musical version of &quot;The Good Companions&quot; premiered on 11 July 1974 and ran until 15 February 1975, followed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s collaboration, &quot;Jeeves&quot;, on 22 April 1975, which ran for just over a month, closing on 24 May.

John Cleese organised &quot;A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)&quot; as a benefit for Amnesty International at the theatre in 1976, and it was broadcast as &quot;Pleasure at Her Majesty&#x27;s&quot;. This was the first of &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Balls&quot;, organised by and starring such performers as Peter Cook, Graham Chapman, and Rowan Atkinson. The venue was also the setting for the popular ITV variety series &quot;Live from Her Majesty&#x27;s&quot;, which ran on television from 1983 to 1988. It was on this programme that Tommy Cooper collapsed and died on stage in 1984.
&quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; had its world premiere on 9 October 1986 at the theatre, winning the Olivier Award for Best New Musical; it featured Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, who won an Olivier award for his performance in the title role. The original Victorian stage machinery remains beneath the stage of the theatre; the designer, Maria Björnson, found a way to use it &quot;to show the Phantom travelling across the lake as if floating on a sea of mist and fire&quot;. &quot;Phantom&quot; is the second longest-running musical and third longest-running stage work in West End history. As of 2024, it is still playing at the theatre, and booking continues to 2025.

The theatre is one of forty featured in the 2012 DVD documentary series &quot;Great West End Theatres&quot;, presented by Donald Sinden.

===Capacity and ownership===
The theatre&#x27;s capacity is 1,216 seats on four levels. Really Useful Theatres Group purchased it in January 2000 with nine other London theatres formerly owned by the Stoll-Moss Group. Between 1990 and 1993, renovation and improvements were made by the H. L. M. and C. G. Twelves partnership. In 2014 Really Useful Theatres – now known as LW Theatres – split from the Really Useful Group and took ownership of the theatre. In conformity with the custom of matching the title of the theatre to the gender of the British monarch, the theatre once again became His Majesty&#x27;s in 2023, marking the coronation of Charles III.
