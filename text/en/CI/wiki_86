<text>Frederick II (; 25 April 1211 – 15 June 1246), known as Frederick the Quarrelsome (&quot;Friedrich der Streitbare&quot;), was Duke of Austria and Styria from 1230 until his death. He was the fifth and last Austrian duke from the House of Babenberg, since the former margraviate was elevated to a duchy by the 1156 &quot;Privilegium Minus&quot;. He was killed in the Battle of the Leitha River, leaving no male heirs.

==Family==
Born in Wiener Neustadt, Frederick was the second surviving son of the Babenberg duke Leopold VI of Austria and Theodora Angelina, a Byzantine princess. The death of his elder brother Henry in 1228 made him the only heir to the Austrian and Styrian duchies.

His first wife was Byzantine princess Eudokia Laskarina, (referred to as &quot;Sophia&quot;), a daughter of emperor Theodore I Laskaris and his first wife Anna Komnene Angelina. They were divorced by 1222. Frederick secondly married Agnes of Merania in 1229, an heiress of the extinct noble House of Andechs whose dowry included large possessions in Carniola and the Windic March.
 From 1232 Frederick styled himself &quot;Dominus Carniolae&quot; (&quot;Lord of Carniola&quot;). However, the marriage was dissolved due to childlessness in 1243.

==Reign==
Frederick succeeded his father in 1230. Proud of his Byzantine descent, the young duke soon was known as &quot;the Quarrelsome&quot; because of his harsh rule and frequent wars against his neighbors, primarily with Hungary, Bavaria and Bohemia. Even the Austrian Kuenring &quot;ministeriales&quot;, which had so far been faithful to the ruling house, started an insurgency as soon as his reign began.

According to the &quot;Weltchronik&quot; of Jans der Enikel, Frederick had gone to the court of Emperor Frederick II by his summon, leading a procession of 200 knights wearing the triband colors of Austria. When he approached the Emperor, he was enthusiastically invited—by both command and request of Emperor Frederick—to eat bread with him. The Duke refused, stating he brought his own gold. But the Emperor insisted without prevailing. Thus instead he ordered that no one in the town sell the Duke firewood for his kitchen. Duke Frederick instead sought a house to buy and when the Emperor learned of this, forbade it. Duke Frederick then instructed his marshal to go out late at night and buy some nuts so that his food could be prepared. Duke Frederick had impressed the Emperor so much that he allowed him the sale of firewood and whatever he wishes. Afterwards, the Duke asked to be shown the Emperor&#x27;s assassins, which he was allowed. They moved onto the town&#x27;s tower, which stood 50 cubics tall, and brought out two of his assassins. The Emperor then told one to jump down and without a thought, the man leapt and fell to his death. Immediately, Duke Frederick was impressed by the sheer loyalty of these men and the Emperor stopped the other man from jumping. The experience convinced the Duke of the Emperor&#x27;s power.

Most dangerous were his disputes with the Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick II in the course of the rebellion of the emperor&#x27;s son Henry (VII), husband of Frederick&#x27;s sister Margaret. Not only had the duke refused to appear at the 1232 Reichstag diet in Aquileia, appealing to the Austrian &quot;Privilegium Minus&quot; privileges, and displeased the emperor by picking quarrels with King Béla IV of Hungary, he furthermore seemed to be involved in his brother-in-law Henry&#x27;s conspiracy. When he again refused to attend the 1235 diet in Mainz, Emperor Frederick II finally ostracized him and gave permission to King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia to invade the Austrian lands. Vienna opened its gates for the united Bohemian and Bavarian forces and during the years of Frederick&#x27;s ban even became an imperial free city, where the emperor had his son Conrad IV elected King of the Romans in 1237. However, the expelled duke managed to maintain his position as the ruler of an Austrian rump state at his Wiener Neustadt residence. In the same year, Frederick enacted the &quot;Landrecht&quot; Law, which required all subjects to defend the country in the case of invasion.

In 1239, in a spectacular change in imperial politics, Duke Frederick became one of the emperor&#x27;s most important allies. In 1241, Duke Frederick was one of the very few Western European commanders who faced the Mongols when they invaded Austria. After the Mongols started pillaging Hungary and Croatia, King Bela IV asked the papacy and the Western European rulers for help. Duke Frederick sent a very small expeditionary force of knights to assist the Hungarians. He and his knights managed to defeat a small Mongolian raiding party during the initial stages of the Battle of Mohi, but they soon left after inter-conflicts with King Bela IV and the Cumans in the region. He would meet the Mongols again, this time in his own country. After the defeat of Hungary, the Mongols now set their sights on Vienna. A minor raiding squadron started pillaging Wiener Neustadt in Southern Vienna, but Duke Frederick together with his knights and foreign allies, defeated them and drove them out. The Austrians would again defeat the Mongols in the River March in Theben. Afterwards, the Mongols never again tried to invade Austria.

The conflict with Bohemia was settled by the engagement of his niece Gertrude of Babenberg with King Wenceslaus&#x27; eldest son Margrave Vladislaus of Moravia. Negotiations with the emperor about the elevation of Vienna to a bishopric and of Austria (including Styria) to a kingdom were initiated, however, on condition that the duke&#x27;s niece Gertrude now would have to marry the fifty-year-old emperor, who moreover had recently been banned by Pope Gregory IX and needed allies. In 1245 the terms were arranged, but the willful young girl, then in her late teens, refused to appear in the consummation ceremony at the diet of Verona. In the year before his death, Duke Frederick finally succeeded in gaining the rule over the March of Carniola from the Patriarchate of Aquileia, but upon his death it fell to the Carinthian duke Bernhard von Spanheim.

Duke Frederick&#x27;s ambitious plans were dashed when he died at the Battle of the Leitha River, in another border conflict he had picked with the Hungarian king Béla IV. He is buried at Heiligenkreuz Abbey.

==Legacy==

As the Austrian &quot;Privilegium Minus&quot; of 1156 also allowed women to inherit, Frederick&#x27;s sister Margaret and his niece Gertrude would have been entitled to the throne. Shortly after the death of her uncle, Gertrude first married her fiancé Vladislaus of Moravia, who nevertheless died in the next year, then Margrave Herman VI of Baden, who did not manage to maintain his position in Austria, and finally in 1252 Prince Roman Danylovich, a younger brother of Knyaz Lev I Rurik, son-in-law of the Hungarian king, who also ended in divorce in 1253.

In the same year the Bohemian Přemyslids made a second attempt to confirm their claims to the Austrian and Styrian duchies by arranging the marriage between Gertrude&#x27;s aunt Margaret of Babenberg and King Wenceslaus&#x27; son Ottokar II, more than twenty years her junior. Subsequently, Austria became a field of conflict between the Přemyslids and the Hungarian Árpád dynasty, in which Ottokar at first would prevail defeating King Béla at the 1260 Battle of Kressenbrunn, until finally being overthrown by the Habsburg king Rudolf I of Germany at the Battle on the Marchfeld in 1278.

As the last Babenberg duke, Frederick the Quarrelsome signifies the end of an era in the history of Austria, beginning with the enfeoffment of Margrave Leopold I in 976. With his overambitious plans, which were frequently foiled by his erratic character, he somewhat resembled his later Habsburg successor Duke Rudolf IV. According to the 18th century historian Chrysostomus Hanthaler, Frederick was the first Austrian duke utilizing the red-white-red coat of arms after his accession—an attempt to prevail against the reluctant local nobles and to stress his autonomy towards Emperor Frederick II. The triband is first documented in a seal on a deed issued on 30 November 1230, confirming the privileges of Lilienfeld Abbey. The medieval chronicler Jans der Enikel reports that the duke appeared in a red-white-red ceremonial dress at his 1232 accolade in the Vienna Schottenstift.

<text>The Dorset Downs are an area of chalk downland in the centre of the county Dorset in south west England. The downs are the most western part of a larger chalk formation which also includes (from west to east) Cranborne Chase, Salisbury Plain, Hampshire Downs, Chiltern Hills, North Downs and South Downs.

==Physical geography==
The Dorset Downs are bounded on the north, along the steep scarp face, by the Blackmore Vale, a large clay and limestone valley. On the east, the Downs were once, thousands of years ago, continuous with Cranborne Chase, but the River Stour now cuts a valley between them, which is the location of Blandford Forum and the eastern boundary of the downs. From the northern scarp face, the hills dip gently southwards before the chalk disappears beneath the Bagshot Beds which form the heathlands of the county, between Dorchester and Wareham. South of the River Frome, the chalk reappears in a narrower strip, forming coastal cliffs east of Weymouth and, further east, the steep ridge of the Purbeck Hills. This southerly strip of the visible chalk (sometimes referred to as the South Dorset Downs or South Dorset Ridgeway) continues westwards behind Weymouth, and rejoins the main body of the downs at their western extremity at Eggardon Hill. In the west the chalk dips down under marl.

Together with Cranborne Chase, the Dorset Downs have been designated as National Character Area 134 by Natural England, the UK Government&#x27;s advisor on the natural environment. In Dorset this area is bounded by the Dorset Heaths and Weymouth Lowlands to the south, the Marshwood and Powerstock Vales to the west and the Blackmore Vale to the north.

The main land uses on the downs are arable agriculture, woodland and calcareous grassland, a habitat which is growing as farmers are encouraged to set aside land with subsidies. Chalk is a rough rock and the Dorset Downs hold a large water table which acts as a reservoir of drinking water for much of the county. This property of chalk also means there are many seasonal rivers, called winterbournes, that flow depending upon the level of the water table.

== Hills ==
* Bulbarrow Hill (274 m), site of Rawlsbury camp and the highest hill in the Downs.
* Telegraph Hill (267 m)
* Lyscombe Hill (262 m)
* Watts Hill (261 m)
* Bell Hill (258 m)
* Eggardon Hill (252 m), also the western extremity of the South Dorset Downs
* Toller Down (252 m)
* Ball Hill (251 m)
* Dogbury Hill (248 m)
* Beaminster Down (244 m)
* Shillingstone Hill (223 m), a densely wooded scarp face with a large quarry.
* Rampisham Down (219 m) 
* Hambledon Hill (192 m) and Hod Hill (143 m), two outliers of Cranborne Chase, separated from the Downs by the River Stour.

== Fauna ==
The downs are the native home to the Dorset Down sheep.

==Places of interest==
* Blandford Forest
* Cerne valley, including Cerne Abbas Giant.
* Dorsetshire Gap, a steep valley.
* Milton Abbas, 18th-century planned estate village and museum.
* Minterne Magna, &quot;Rhododendron&quot; garden at Minterne House.

<text>The East European Plain (also called the Russian Plain, or historically the Sarmatic Plain) is a vast interior plain extending east of the North European Plain, and comprising several plateaus stretching roughly from 25 degrees longitude eastward. It includes Volhynian-Podolian Upland on its westernmost fringe, the Central Russian Upland, and, on the eastern border, encompasses the Volga Upland. The plain includes also a series of major river basins such as the Dnieper Lowland, the Oka–Don Lowland, and the Volga Basin. At the southeastern point of the East European Plain are the Caucasus and Crimean mountain ranges. Together with the North European Plain (covering much of Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and Poland), and covering the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), European Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, southeastern Romania, and, at its southernmost point, the Danubian Plain in Northern Bulgaria (including Ludogorie and Southern Dobruja), it constitutes the majority of the Great European Plain (European Plain), the greatest mountain-free part of the European landscape. The plain spans approximately and averages about in elevation. The highest point of the plain () is in the Bugulma-Belebey Upland, in the Eastern part of the plain, in the elevated area by the Ural Mountains (&quot;priyralie&quot;).

<doc id="1073882" wikidata="Q7402084" url="?curid=1073882" title="Saint Peter Port Harbour">
<text>Saint Peter Port Harbour is located in Saint Peter Port, Guernsey. It was a natural anchorage used by the Romans which has been changed into an artificial harbour that is now the island&#x27;s main port for passengers. Loose cargo, liquids and gas are shipped to and from St Sampson&#x27;s harbour.

Castle Cornet has formed the harbour main defence for centuries. The castle was formerly a tidal island, but since 1859 a breakwater has connected it to the enlarged harbour.

==History==

The earliest evidence of shipping was the discover of a wreck in 1982 in the entrance of the harbour, which has been named &quot;Asterix&quot;. It is thought to be a 3rd-century Roman cargo vessel and was probably at anchor or grounded when the fire broke out.

The first breakwater, from before the 13th century was a mole, made of loose stones, where the Albert Pier now stands. In 1605, a Royal Charter authorised a &quot;pettie Custume&quot; tax on imports to Guernsey to pay for harbour development.

The English Civil War saw the harbour in the firing line in 1643 between the Royalist held Castle Cornet and the Parliamentarian held town. Cannonballs fired from the castle caused some damage to the town.

In 1831 gas lamps replaced oil lamps on quays, in 1857 electric lights were demonstrated. The harbour piers were extended by 1864 to allow ships to berth at any state of the tide. Problems were experienced with many piers, quicksand, subsidence and bulges were often solved with piles and by reducing the weight through making problem piers hollow. Dredging in 1899 and removal of some rock from the harbour bed, improved services.

Since 1881 the harbour has housed the Saint Peter Port Lifeboat Station, originally in a building on the Castle Pier.

The First World War saw the establishment of a French seaplane base, on the pier close to Castle Cornet. The pilots flew on constant watch for German submarines.

On 28 June 1940, German commanders sent a squadron of bombers over the islands and bombed the harbours of Guernsey and Jersey. In St Peter Port some lorries lined up to unload tomatoes for export to England were mistaken by the reconnaissance for troop carriers. Forty-four islanders were killed in the raids. The BBC then broadcast the message that the islands had been declared &quot;open towns&quot;, after Prime Minister Winston Churchill refused to announce the demilitarisation through diplomatic channels, and later in the day reported the German bombing of the island.

The Second World War saw the town also bombed by Allied bombers which killed harbour workers and caused damage to the harbour, such as on 14 June 1944, having been identified by Cryptanalysis of the Enigma intercepts, which was confirmed with a solo photographic reconnaissance Spitfire from No. 541 Squadron RAF, German submarine U-275 was attacked by no less than 8 Hawker Typhoon strike attack aircraft of No. 263 Squadron RAF while tied up in harbour. No damage was caused to the submarine; escorting vessels were not so lucky, where the rockets hit a Dutch coaster M.V. Karel in the harbour. Many windows in town were shattered including most of those in the Town Church.

The Nazi German forces improved the defences of the harbour including building a number of steel and concrete bunkers and casemates, most of which are located on the Castle pier. One bunker was removed from the New Jetty after the war due to fears that weight may collapse the jetty. Considerable work has recently been undertaken strengthening the New Jetty. A workshop erected by the Germans on the Albert Pier was demolished in the 1970s.

During the mid 1980s the harbour was dredged to provide easier access for shipping, with the excavated aggregate pumped through pipes to reclaim the land currently used for the North Beach parking, between the harbour and the Queen Elizabeth II Marina.

==Harbour Facilities==

===Freight and Passengers===

A passenger terminal and customs facilities are located on St Julian&#x27;s Pier.

Facilities at the harbour include two ro-ro ramps for cars and lorries that travel on car/passenger ferries such as the 102m long trimaran &quot;Condor Liberation&quot; or freight/car/passenger traditional ferries such as the &quot;Commodore Clipper&quot;.


Two large cranes and a number of smaller ones facilitate the loading/unloading of containers.

===Piers===

====Albert Pier====

The southern arm of the original harbour going east from near the Town Church was originally a mole, referred to in 1275 by Edward I of England when it was mentioned as needing reconstruction, given permission to raise a local tax to cover the cost, little was done until a dry stone pier, was constructed by 1580. The pier was well built, standing 35 ft high and 360 ft long, paved with a parapet and still being in good condition in 1815. Until 1806 a roundhouse tower at the end of the pier had been used as a holding cell for prisoners who needed to be shipped by sea to Castle Cornet, a lighthouse was built on the remains of the roundhouse in 1831 before being demolished in 1860. Improved in 1861-63 with north return arm now at right angles. It was renamed in honour of Prince Albert who had died in 1861. A statue of Prince Albert, a copy of an original by Joseph Durham, was erected in 1863.

====North or Crown Pier====

The northern arm of the original harbour heads east from the Quay, with a retaining pier for the Careening Hard going north. Originally built from 1703 as a breakwater, gradually improved and by 1750 was completed as a dry construction with an arm heading south east.

The harbour quay was completed by the late 1770s, prior to that everything was landed on the beach, cattle still being made to swim ashore.

In 1838 the entrance to the old harbour was widened to make it 40 ft at the top and 68 ft at the bottom. In 1893 the pier was rebuilt to 220 ft length.
====St Julians Pier====

St Julian&#x27;s Pier is the pier running east from St Julian&#x27;s Avenue roundabout. The foundation stone for the pier being laid in 1853. The first weighbridge was built on the pier in 1861, later rebuilt in stone in 1892 and upgraded to 20-ton in 1923. Moving east along the pier you reach the Cambridge Berth (1909), the new Inter-Island Quay, the Ro-Ro ramps (1975), the New Jetty (1927) and finally the White Rock Pier with its Lo-Lo facilities.

====Castle Pier====

The Castle Pier was constructed in the 1850s to protect the southern side of the expanded harbour. Connecting the south esplanade with Castle Cornet to the east. There is a retaining wall for the Albert Marina, the Fish Quay built from the model yacht pond, a connecting bridge to Castle Cornet, and at the end the Castle Breakwater, authorised in 1854, completed in 1861, with its lighthouse completed 1868. The abattoir was completed and the Victoria Boat Pond, later called the &quot;Model Yacht Pond&quot;, was opened in 1887 for Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee. In the First World War a French seaplane base was established on the pier, next to the pond.

From 1931 to 1951 oil was imported at the Albert dock, the Germans building tunnels in 1942 to house fuel containers at La Vallette, the tunnels now form a museum.

====Fish Quay====

A purpose built quay built in 1987 with a reinforced concrete deck supported on piles with pontoons, built out from the Castle Pier to provide facilities for the small number of local fishing boats.

===Local yachts===

Two marinas are dedicated to local yachts and motor boats. The smaller original 1975 Albert Marina, located between the Castle and Albert piers and the newer Queen Elizabeth II Marina located north of the St Julian&#x27;s Pier which was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1989. Both marinas have retaining sills.

===Visiting yachts===

Visiting tourist yachts and motor vessels can tie up to pontoons inside the inner harbour, which has a fixed barrier to maintain water in the harbour at low tide, or may moor against outer harbour deep water pontoons. St Peter Port marina is the largest marina in the British Isles, it hosts over 10,500 visiting yachts every year.

===Cruise ships===

The island has become a regular destination for cruise ships with over 100 ships arriving between April and October and is the largest tender port for cruise liners in Europe.

The restricted size of the harbour will not allow cruise ships to enter resulting in the ships needing to anchor in the roads. The disembarkation of passengers, mainly using their own ships tenders was, until 2014 using a ro-ro ramp on the White Rock pier until an alternative pontoon and ramp were installed attached to the Albert Pier. Initially the ramp caused complaints as it was considered too steep to passengers to climb when tides were very low, in 2015 this was rectified with a longer ramp which reduced the gradient.

Businesses are developing for transporting and entertaining the 100,000+ annual visitors, with some queues being experienced on days when two large ships arrive on the same day.

==Memorials==

<doc id="1073898" wikidata="Q1075674" url="?curid=1073898" title="Clover (Clamp manga)">
<text>Clover (stylized in all caps) is a manga series created by Clamp, a creative team made up by Satsuki Igarashi, Nanase Ohkawa, Tsubaki Nekoi, and Mokona. The manga takes place in a dystopian future, where the government is out to control the &quot;Clovers&quot;, a race of children with special powers.

&quot;Clover&quot; was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Amie&quot; from 1997 until the magazine&#x27;s demise in 1999. Kodansha Comics released the entire series in English as one hardcover volume in 2020.

==Plot==
&quot;Clover&quot; is primarily about a young girl called , whose name was stated to be derived from the Chinese word for four (sì) since she is a &quot;4-leaf Clover&quot;. In the futuristic world that she inhabits, the military conducted a search for gifted children nicknamed &quot;Clovers&quot;, who seemingly have the magical ability to manipulate technology. Demonstrations of their powers include teleportation and summoning weapons from thin air.

Classified according to how powerful they are, the children were then tattooed with a symbol of the Clover Project, with the number of leaves on the Clover indicating their power. To date, Sue is the only &quot;4-leaf Clover&quot; discovered. Along with other &quot;Clovers&quot;, Sue was imprisoned to prevent her contact with other humans, as the government feared that she might develop feelings and be used as a weapon to jeopardize the country&#x27;s national security.

Being isolated from the rest of mankind, Sue craves for company, and as for her only wish, she asks to visit &quot;Fairy Park.&quot; Her escort is Kazuhiko, an ex-military soldier who has been forced to undertake the task.

==Development==
The manga was conceived as a four-part story. The first two volumes comprise part I and trace the main story in the present. The following two volumes are parts II and III, and are flashbacks which explain the history behind certain incidents. According to series head writer Nanase Ohkawa, two further books are needed to complete the story.

==Release==
&quot;Clover&quot; was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Amie&quot; from 1997 until the magazine&#x27;s demise in 1999, and remains unfinished. Kodansha collected the chapters into four volumes. The first was published on June 6, 1997; the final was released on August 9, 1999. Kodansha re-released the series in two volumes on July 17, 2008.

&quot;Clover&quot; was licensed for an English-language release in North America by Tokyopop. It published the series from May 15, 2001 to March 20, 2002, but let the series go out of print on May 2, 2005. Dark Horse Manga picked up the license, combining the series into one volume () in its original right-to-left format and releasing it on May 13, 2009.
The series is also licensed in French by Pika Édition, and in German by Carlsen Comics.

After Dark Horse Comics&#x27; license expired, Kodansha Comics licensed it and began releasing the series, combining into one hardcover volume in 2020.

===Volume list===



==Media==
A &quot;Clover&quot; animated music video based on the prologue chapters of the manga was produced by Bandai Visual and Madhouse Studios and shown in Japanese theaters before the &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; film in 1999. It is directed by Kitarō Kōsaka, with Nobuteru Yūki designing the characters and Ichiko Hashimoto composing the music. The short film was released to DVD as part of the &quot;Clamp in Wonderland&quot; collection on October 26, 2007.

Dark Horse Comics, who previously held the license for the distribution of the English North American edition of the manga, were in negotiations with Universal Studios for the rights to develop a film based upon the manga. However, as of 2022, nothing from this has materialized.

==Reception==
Rika Takahashi, from EX: The Online World of Manga, noted the work&#x27;s stark contrast with other, more positive CLAMP works such as Cardcaptor Sakura and Wish. She stated that it was a fast-pace drama similar to works such X and Tokyo Babylon. She commented on CLAMP&#x27;s choice of presenting the story in short sequences and in a style &quot;where the frames break out of the typical &#x27;grid&#x27;&quot; and to produce an experience of watching a movie on paper. She also commented that the typesetting of the sound effects helped create the overall cold mood unlike other CLAMP works. Furthermore, she praised the work for retaining a high detail of the art without being too dense.

Kisei from Tokidoki Journal praised &quot;Clover&quot; for having a sense of beauty due to its empty space and simplicity, which help give the manga and characters a mood of &quot;chilling isolation,&quot; a stark contrast from CLAMP&#x27;s previous works which Kisei said feature highly detailed pages that make reading difficult and &quot;cheerful bubbly&quot; female protagonists. Kisei further praised the work for, instead of defining the characters, using art to express their personalities and traits. Further praising it as a work that would draw both female and male audiences with its romance and military aspects, Kisei stated that the only flaw with the work was its high price.

Casey Brienza of Anime News Network remarks that the series is &quot;arguably the best artwork of CLAMP&#x27;s career&quot; and has &quot;gorgeous production values&quot; but that &quot;pretentious poetry conceals a thin plot and even thinner characterization.&quot;

A Publishers Weekly review felt that reading the series is like, &quot;looking into a dystopic future through one tiny, perfectly square frame.&quot; The same reviewer said that the character designs were &quot;magnificent&quot; and that, &quot;the tiny details on the clockwork birds and imaginative effects are stunning.&quot; The reviewer felt that though it was obviously an experimental work for CLAMP, that the series would be widely liked.

<doc id="1073903" wikidata="Q7309103" url="?curid=1073903" title="Regional Municipality of Ottawa–Carleton">
<text>The Regional Municipality of Ottawa–Carleton was a Regional Municipality and Census Division in Ontario, Canada, that existed between January 1, 1969, and January 1, 2001, and was primarily centred on the City of Ottawa. It was created in 1969 by restructuring Carleton County and annexing Cumberland Township from the United Counties of Prescott and Russell into the newly created Region of Ottawa–Carleton.

It was the second Regional Municipality to be created in Ontario after the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto. It served as an upper-tier level of municipal government, aggregating municipal services on a region-wide basis like the Counties and Regional Municipalities of Southern Ontario, and was the only upper-tier municipal government ever created in Eastern Ontario. The Regional Municipality was dissolved upon the creation of the amalgamated City of Ottawa on January 1, 2001.

==Constituent Municipalities==
The Regional Municipality originally consisted of the Cities of Ottawa and Eastview, the Villages of Rockcliffe Park, Richmond and Stittsville, and the Townships of Torbolton, Fitzroy, Huntley, March, Goulbourn, Nepean, Osgoode, Marlborough, North Gower, Gloucester and Cumberland. At the same time as the creation of the Region, the City of Eastview was renamed the City of Vanier.

===Chronology===
*In 1974
**The police villages of City View, Kenmore, Manotick, Metcalfe, North Gower, Osgoode Station, and St. Joseph d&#x27;Orleans were dissolved.
**Goulbourn Township annexed the villages of Richmond and Stittsville.
**The townships of Marlborough and North Gower merged to become Rideau Township.
**At the same time the Townships of Torbolton, Fitzroy and Huntley merged to become West Carleton Township.
*In 1978
**The township of March and parts of Goulbourn and Nepean townships became the city of Kanata.
**At the same time the township of Nepean became the city of Nepean.
*In 1981 the township of Gloucester became the city of Gloucester.
*In 1999 the township of Cumberland became the city of Cumberland.

==Purpose of regional government==
The region, known as an &quot;upper-tier&quot; level of municipal government, was created to manage municipal services that crossed municipal boundaries and were more efficiently provided to residents on a regional, as opposed to local, basis. Over time, more and more services were transferred from the &quot;lower-tier&quot; municipalities to the Region and, by the end of the 1990s, 85% of municipal services were delivered by the Region. This included mass transit, policing, arterial roads, sewage, water, social services, garbage collection and Regional planning. Periodical reorganization (e.g. rural townships acquiring city status, as in 1974 and 1978) did not impede the process.

However the constituent municipalities of the RMOC were unified in a single City of Ottawa in 2001 by the Fewer Municipal Politicians Act of Ontario (1999), by the government of Premier Mike Harris, re-elected promising a &quot;Common Sense Revolution.&quot; Several other Ontario conurbations were also unified under the Act, listed at. Ottawa thus became in sheer area one of the largest municipalities in Canada, roughly 65 kilometres by 32, much of this farmland, although 90 per cent of the population live in urban concentrations.

On formation in 1969, the RMOC was a Council of members selected by the municipal councils, who elected among themselves a Regional Chairman. In 1991, the Regional chairman was for the first time directly elected by the people of the Region, which municipal mayors earlier resisted, fearing the chairman would effectively become a &quot;super mayor&quot;. In 1994, Regional councillors were directly elected to represent Regional wards, rather than being appointed from the lower-tier municipal councils. Many of the new Regional wards crossed municipal boundaries, which in the eyes of many local residents undermined local or historical differences. Generally in Ontario regional government reforms of the 1990s were sometimes mistrusted as preparation for eventual creation of unified &quot;mega-cities&quot;, but this was not before 1999 a topic of local political anxiety in Ottawa-Carleton.

<text>Alfonso Daniel Manuel Rodríguez Castelao (30 January 1886 – 7 January 1950), commonly known as Castelao, was a Galician politician, writer, painter and doctor. He is one of the fathers of Galician nationalism, promoting Galician identity and culture, and was one of the main names behind the cultural movement &quot;Xeración Nós&quot;. He was also one of the founders and president of the Galicianist Party and had a great influence on the renovating group of Galician art known as &quot;Os renovadores&quot;. Castelao is considered to be the most important figure in Galician culture of the 20th century.

==Early life and youth (1886–1929)==
Alfonso Daniel Rodríguez Castelao was born on 30 January 1886 in the town of Rianxo, Galicia. He was the firstborn of Manuel Rodríguez Dios, a mariner who made sails for ships, and Joaquina Castelao Genme. On the day of his birth he was baptised at the parish church of Santa Comba with his maternal aunt and uncle, Pilara and Francisco Castelao, as godparents.
He spent his childhood and adolescence in Santa Rosa de Toay, Argentina. In 1900, the Rodríguez Castelao family returned to Rianxo. In 1908 he obtained his degree in medicine from the University of Santiago de Compostela. During his university years Rodríguez Castelao joined the &quot;tuna&quot;, with which he visited Portugal in a number of occasions. He passed his doctorate in Madrid in 1909, where he began to gain some popularity as a caricaturist and cartoon artist. In fact, Rodríguez Castelao often admitted he only studied medicine to please the wishes of his father. He rarely practiced medicine professionally despite having the credentials for it. He eventually settled down in Rianxo, where he joined the political movement &quot;Acción Gallega&quot; (&quot;Galician Action&quot;). As a caricaturist, Rodríguez Castelao focussed on the everyday in a humorous way, although after experiencing the Spanish Civil War, he turned to using his art to denounce the cruelties of Fascism in a collection of paintings. His paintings would also depict casual moments of Galician life and culture.

In 1916, he moved to Pontevedra, where he joined the &quot;Irmandades da Fala&quot; (&quot;Brotherhoods of the Language&quot;). Rodríguez Castelao developed an emotional attachment with Pontevedra and frequently claimed he wanted to be considered a native of that city; he even expressed a will to be buried there and not back in his original Rianxo or elsewhere. Also in 1916, he participated in the &quot;Asembleia Nazonalista de Lugo&quot; (&quot;Nationalist Assembly of Lugo&quot;), signing a declaration for the history of Galician nationalism.

In 1920, he starts publishing the magazine &quot;Nós&quot;, together with Vicente Risco and Otero Pedrayo. That same year he travelled through France, the Netherlands and Germany. In 1922, he wrote the novel &quot;Un ollo de vidro&quot; and in 1924 he joined the &quot;Seminário de Estudos Galegos&quot; (&quot;Seminar of Galician Studies&quot;) and founded the Pontevedra Polyphonic Choir; as he was an amateur musician). Two years, in 1926, he published &quot;Cousas&quot;. He travelled to Brittany in 1928 to study calvaries and publish &quot;As cruces de pedra na Bretaña&quot;. That is also the year when his only son dies at the age of 14.

==Political career (1930–1950)==
From 1930 Rodríguez Castelao&#x27;s political activism intensifies even further. His life and work always revolved around politics and his Galician nationalist ideas. In his book &quot;Sempre en Galiza&quot; he states that all his works, talent and efforts would always be used for the profit of the Galician cause.

In 1930, he founded the Galician Republican Federation at Lestrove Palace and participated in the meetings of the Galician Nationalist Republican Party and in the assembly for the Federal State of Galicia. The next year he published the book &quot;Nós&quot; and became the official representative of the Galicianist Party to the Cortes Generales. In 1934, he published &quot;Retrincos&quot;, &quot;Os dous de sempre&quot; and the a re-edition of &quot;Cousas&quot;.

He became a member of the Royal Galician Academy in 1933, and shortly after that, in 1935, he was forced into exile by the Spanish government to the Spanish city of Badajoz, in Extremadura, where he worked as a civil servant. It was then where he began to write what would become his key work, &quot;Sempre en Galiza&quot;. In 1936 he gained a seat at the Spanish parliament, this time representing the Popular Front coalition, which included the Galicianist Party.

The Spanish civil war began whilst Castelao was in Madrid presenting the results of the referendum for the Galician Statute of Autonomy, which had been approved by 98 per cent of voters, and in which Castelao had played a role, together with his personal friend Alexandre Bóveda. During the war he organised the Galician militias in collaboration with the Spanish Communist Party and declared his support to the government of the Spanish Republic. As the Nationalist troops advanced Castelao fled to Valencia – where he still had time to publish &quot;Galicia Martir&quot; and &quot;Atila en Galicia&quot; – and later moved to Barcelona.

In 1938, he was sent by the Spanish government to the Soviet Union, the United States and Cuba, in order to obtain support for the Republic. From New York City he cruised to Buenos Aires, where in 1941 he performed for the first time the play &quot;Os vellos non deben de namorarse&quot;, Castelao&#x27;s contribution to Galician theatre.

In 1944, while in Buenos Aires, he finished and published a work of Galician political theory: &quot;Sempre en Galiza&quot; (lit. &quot;Always in Galicia&quot;), which was in fact a compilation of three books (three parts) and a number of other texts. &quot;Sempre en Galiza&quot; has been considered one of the most advanced political texts of its time. Also in that year he became the first president of the &quot;Consello de Galiza&quot;, the Government of Galicia in exile. In 1945, together with Catalan and Basque intellectuals in exile, he founded the magazine &quot;Galeuzca&quot; as an evocation of the political alliance of 1933 between Galicia, Catalonia and the Basque Country. In 1946 he was appointed as minister without portfolio in the Spanish Republican government in exile led by José Giral, while living in Paris. In 1947, back in Buenos Aires and after being diagnosed with lung cancer, he published &quot;As cruces de pedra na Galiza&quot;.

Castelao died on 7 January 1950 at the hospital of the &quot;Centro Gallego &quot;in Buenos Aires. The Argentine Senate and the City of Buenos Aires erected monuments to honour him. Since then, most of his work has been translated and published into other languages. In 1984, Castelao&#x27;s remains were brought back to Galicia and he was buried at the &quot;Panteón de Galegos Ilustres&quot; (&quot;Pantheon of Illustrious Galicians&quot;), Bonaval, in the capital city of Santiago de Compostela.

==Political views==
Castelao was a Galician nationalist (heir of the early Galicianism), federalist, pacifist, progressive, and internationalist. He accepted the autonomy granted to Galicia by the Second Spanish Republic as a tool to construct a possible Galician State, in federation with other Iberian nations. He was also a convinced pro-European. He wrote in &quot;Sempre en Galiza&quot; that one of his dreams was to &quot;one day see the emergence of a &#x27;United States of Europe&#x27; &quot;.

At the end of his life, and as expressed in the final parts of &quot;Sempre en Galiza&quot;, Castelao became somewhat disappointed with the Spanish Republican politicians in exile, and began to discuss the advantages of a completely independent Galician State.

===Idea of Spain===

Castelao always used the term of &quot;Hespaña&quot; instead of &quot;España&quot;, taken directly from the old name Hispania. By using &quot;Hespaña&quot; he was in fact referring to the Iberian Peninsula as a whole, and not just to the country known as Spain. In fact, he would use the term &quot;España&quot; in a depreciative way, an example of the &quot;past&quot; and what &quot;should be avoided&quot;. It was his ideal that a federation of &quot;Iberian Nations&quot; should emerge to create this new &quot;Hespaña&quot;. For Rodríguez Castelao these nations were: Castile, Catalonia, the Basque Country, Portugal and Galicia. He also implied that apart from creating the political conditions for it, cultural conditions (education) should also be provided.

Castelao did not support the classical idea of Iberian Federalism, as this advocated for the union of the two Iberian States, Spain and Portugal as such, and not of what he considered to be the real five nations of Iberia. He pointed out that before these nations could federate the Spanish State should &quot;break up&quot; first, so all nations could pact entering the new federation on equal political terms, as free-states. He resented that Spain had a disproportionate influence from Castile, which was taking over the other nations and regions.

Then again, Castelao seemed to have gained a sympathy for the idea of full independence for Galicia in the last years of his life, as succinctly mentioned in &quot;Sempre in Galiza&quot; and in a number of late texts and letters.



==Language==
Although bilingual in Galician and Spanish, Castelao always wrote and published in Galician, with very rare exceptions. He was a keen defender of Galician culture and considered the language to be the key element of cohesion among the Galician people. In &quot;Sempre en Galiza&quot; he stated &quot;If we are Galician still that is by deed and grace of speaking our own language&quot;. Castelao often criticised the imposition of Spanish language in Galicia, and demanded for Galician to become an official language and thus the preferred language in the administration and education.

Castelao could, in a way, be considered a pre-reintegrationist as he claimed that Galician and Portuguese had not just a common origin, but also a &quot;common future&quot;. In his travels to Portugal, and sporadically to Brazil while residing in Argentina, Castelao was impressed with how easily he could use his native Galician in order to communicate freely with Portuguese speakers.

Nevertheless, Castelao never used Portuguese orthography in his writings, despite affirming that &quot;I hope that one day Galician and Portuguese will, gradually and naturally, merge&quot;. Indeed, Castelao&#x27;s political writings were addressed to a Galician audience mostly, hence he used a type of language and spelling that could be easily understood by all. He did make use of old Galician words, often common in Portuguese, as a way to progressively introduce them into colloquial speech; for example his preference for the term &quot;Galiza&quot; instead of &quot;Galicia&quot; for the name of the country.

<doc id="1073924" wikidata="Q253778" url="?curid=1073924" title="Margaret of Austria, Queen of Bohemia">
<text>Margaret of Austria (; – 29 October 1266), a member of the House of Babenberg, was German queen from 1225 until 1235, by her first marriage with King Henry (VII), and Queen of Bohemia from 1253 to 1260, by her second marriage with King Ottokar II.

==Biography==
Margaret was the eldest daughter of Duke Leopold VI of Austria (d. 1230) and his wife Theodora Angelina, a member of the Byzantine Imperial Angelus dynasty. Since 1198 Duke Leopold, according to the Georgenberg Pact, ruled over both the duchies of Austria and Styria. His court in Vienna became known as a centre of medieval Minnesang and he also played an important rule in the Empire&#x27;s policies, acting as an arbitrator in the struggle between the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II and Pope Gregory IX.

===First marriage===
In the Imperial City of Nuremberg, on 29 November 1225, the 21-year-old Margaret was married to the 14-year-old Henry, eldest son of Emperor Frederick II and elected King of the Romans since 1222. Frederick&#x27;s counsellor Archbishop Engelbert of Cologne had initially planned for a bride from the English royal Angevin dynasty, however, the attempt failed, as did Henry&#x27;s former engagement with the Přemyslid princess Agnes, daughter of King Ottokar I of Bohemia.

Margaret&#x27;s coronation as Queen of the Romans took place on 23 March 1227 in Aachen Cathedral. King Henry and Queen Margaret had two short-lived sons, Henry (died ca. 1242/1245) and Frederick (died ca. 1251/1252). In 1228, Henry took over the rule in the German kingdom and tried to limit the powers of the princes, thereby disturbing the Imperial policies of his father who made him pay homage under the threat of excommunication.

In 1235, Henry allied with the princely opposition and openly rebelled against the emperor, however, was defeated by his father&#x27;s forces and dethroned. Frederick had him confined in several castles in Apulia, where he died on 12 February 1242 after a fall from his horse, probably in an attempted suicide. In the meanwhile, his wife Margaret (who possibly never saw her husband again) retired to the Dominican monastery in Trier and in 1244 moved to Würzburg, where she lived in seclusion in St Marcus Abbey.

===Claim to Austria and Styria===
In 1246 Margaret&#x27;s brother Duke Frederick II of Austria, last scion of the Babenberg dynasty, died childless in the Battle of the Leitha River, leaving a succession crisis. The two principal claimants over the succession in the duchies of Austria and Styria were two women: Margaret (who, as the eldest sister of the late Duke, claimed proximity of blood) and her niece Gertrude, who claimed primogeniture, as the only daughter of Henry of Mödling, the eldest brother of the late Duke Frederick II, who had predeceased their father Duke Leopold VI.

As King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia wanted to take control over the duchies south of his realm, he arranged for the wedding of his eldest son and heir, Margrave Vladislaus III of Moravia, with Gertrude. The couple was even proclaimed Duke and Duchess of Austria, but Vladislaus died in the following year (1247). The next ruler of Austria was Gertrude&#x27;s second husband, Margrave Herman VI of Baden, who died in 1250, leaving Austria and Styria princeless again.

===Second marriage===

The Austrian aristocracy offered the government of the duchies to King Wenceslaus&#x27; second son and new heir apparent Ottokar II. However, one condition was imposed by the nobles: Ottokar could only take control of Austria and Styria if he married one of the Babenberg heiresses. Ottokar refused to marry his brother&#x27;s widow, such marriage being prohibited by the Book of Leviticus, and decided to marry Margaret, 26 years his senior. The ceremony took place on 11 February 1252 in the Castle Chapel (German: &quot;Burgkapelle&quot;) of Hainburg an der Donau.

Ottokar acquired the imperial privileges sealed with a Golden Bull on the basis of the &quot;Privilegium Minus&quot;, acknowledged by Emperor Frederick II, which legitimized his claim over Austria and Styria, since Margaret was the heiress of the last duke by proximity of blood. Thereby she transferred the government of the duchies to Austria and Styria to her husband. Pope Innocent IV, who had previously changed sides several times between Gertrude and Margaret, confirmed the lawful government of Ottokar over both duchies on 6 May 1252. Bohemian administrators ruled the duchies in his name.

One year later, on 23 September 1253, King Wenceslaus I died, and Ottokar and Margaret became King and Queen of Bohemia. Once he had obtained the Babenberg duchies, it was evident to Ottokar that Margaret, already 50 years old, would not bear children. The king tried to gain from the Pope the recognition of the illegitimate son whom he had with Agnes of Kuenring, one of Margaret&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting, as his lawful successor. After the Pope refused this, in 1260 Ottokar obtained the annulment of his marriage with Margaret.

===Later life===
While Ottokar married Kunigunda of Halych, a grand-daughter of King Béla IV of Hungary, the repudiated Queen Margaret left Bohemia and returned to her Austrian homeland. She took her residence in Krumau am Kamp, spending the winters in Krems. After the annulment she was called &quot;Romanorum quondam Regina&quot; (&quot;former Queen of the Romans&quot;); however, she maintained the title &quot;ducissa Austrie et Stirie&quot; (Duchess of Austria and Styria). In 1266 she changed her title to &quot;quondam filia Livpoldi illustris ducis Austrie et Stirie et Romanorum Regina&quot; as a reference to her father.

Prior to her death in Krumau, she chose Lilienfeld Abbey as her burial place, next to her father. The date of her death is controversial. Some sources state 1266, while others state 2/12 October 1267 as the real date. King Ottokar II kept Austria, Styria; he also acquired the Duchy of Carinthia with the March of Carniola in 1269, claiming to be the heir designated by Margaret in their divorce settlement. He even stood as a candidate for the Imperial Crown several times, until he was deposed by King Rudolf I of Germany in 1276 and killed in the Battle on the Marchfeld two years later.

<doc id="1073953" wikidata="Q5896426" url="?curid=1073953" title="Honky">
<text>Honky (also spelled honkey) is a racial slur which is used to refer to white people, predominantly heard in the United States. The first recorded use of &quot;honky&quot; in this context may date back to 1946.

==Etymology==
The exact origins of the word are generally unknown and postulations about the subject vary.

===Eastern European===
Honky may be a variant of &quot;hunky&quot;, which was a derivative of &quot;Bohunk&quot;, a slur for various Slavic and Hungarian immigrants who moved to America from the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the early 1900s.

===Wolof===
Honky may also derive from the term &quot;xonq nopp&quot; which, in the West African language Wolof, literally means &quot;red-eared person&quot;. The term may have originated with Wolof-speaking people brought to the U.S. It has been used by Black Americans as a pejorative for white people.

===Other===
Honky may have come from coal miners in Oak Hill, West Virginia. The miners were segregated; Blacks in one section, English-speaking whites in another. Foreigners who could not speak English, mostly whites, were separated from both groups into an area known as &quot;Hunk Hill&quot;. These male laborers were known as &quot;Hunkies&quot;.

The term may have begun in the meat packing plants of Chicago. According to Robert Hendrickson, author of the &quot;Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins&quot;, Black workers in Chicago meatpacking plants picked up the term from white workers and began applying it indiscriminately to all whites.

==Notable uses==

&quot;Honky&quot; was adopted as a pejorative in 1967 by black militants within Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) seeking a rebuttal for the term &quot;nigger&quot;. The Department of Defense stated in 1967 that National Chairman of the SNCC, H. Rap Brown, told a Black audience in Cambridge that &quot;You should burn that school down and then go take over the honkie&#x27;s school&quot; on June 24, 1967. Brown went on to say: &quot;[I]f America don&#x27;t come &#x27;round, we got to burn it down. You better get some guns, brother. The only thing the honky respects is a gun. You give me a gun and tell me to shoot my enemy, I might shoot Lady Bird.&quot;

&quot;Honky&quot; has occasionally been used even for white allies of African Americans, as seen in the 1968 trial of Black Panther Party member Huey Newton, when fellow Panther Eldridge Cleaver created pins for Newton&#x27;s white supporters stating &quot;Honkies for Huey&quot;.

&quot;Father of the Blues&quot; W. C. Handy wrote of &quot;Negroes and hunkies&quot; in his autobiography.

===Use in music===
In the 2012 rap song &quot;Thrift Shop&quot; by Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis ft. Wanz, &quot;Damn, that&#x27;s a cold ass honkey!&quot; is used in reference to Macklemore and his secondhand clothes. Eminem, who is also a white American rapper, uses the line &quot;He looked at me and said, &#x27;You gonna die, honkey!&#x27;&quot; in 1999&#x27;s &quot;Brain Damage.&quot; &quot;Play That Funky Music,&quot; a 1976 disco/funk hit by Wild Cherry about a rock band adapting to the rise of disco, substitutes &quot;honky&quot; for &quot;white boy&quot; in the final chorus of the uncensored version. The British band Hot Chocolate used &quot;honky&quot; and &quot;spook&quot; in their controversial 1973 hit single &quot;Brother Louie&quot; about an interracial relationship as the terms chosen by the respective fathers to slur their child&#x27;s newfound lover. 

Other uses of &quot;honky&quot; in music include &quot;Honky&quot; (an album by Melvins), &quot;Honky Reduction&quot; (an album by Agoraphobic Nosebleed), MC Honky (DJ stage persona), &quot;Honky Château&quot; (an album by Elton John, the first track on which is &quot;Honky Cat&quot;), &quot;Talkin&#x27; Honky Blues&quot; (an album by Buck 65), and &quot;Honky&quot; (an album by Keith Emerson). &quot;Honky&#x27;s Ladder&quot; is a 1996 EP by The Afghan Whigs. In 2022 Hank Williams Jr. released a blues album Rich White Honky Blues.

The Chicago style of polka music is also known as honky polka.

===Use in television and film===
&quot;Honky&quot; is a 1971 movie based on an interracial relationship, starring Brenda Sykes as Sheila Smith and John Neilson as Wayne &quot;Honky&quot; Devine. 

In a sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;), Chevy Chase and Richard Pryor used both &quot;nigger&quot; (Chase) and &quot;honky&quot; (Pryor) in reference to one another during a &quot;racist word association interview&quot;. During this period, Steve Martin (as musical guest and stand-up regular on &quot;SNL&quot;) performed a rendition of &quot;King Tut&quot; which contained the word &quot;honky&quot; in its lyrics.

On the TV series &quot;Barney Miller&quot;, Season 5, Episode 8, &quot;Loan Shark&quot;, Arthur Dietrich gives an etymology of the word &quot;honky&quot;, claiming it was &quot;coined by Blacks in the 1950s in reference to the nasal tone of Caucasians&quot;.

On the TV series &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, George Jefferson regularly referred to a white person as a honky (or whitey) as did Redd Foxx on &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;. This word would later be popularized in episodes of &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; by Robin Williams and Jonathan Winters.

<doc id="1073955" wikidata="Q1140272" url="?curid=1073955" title="Soul Food (film)">
<text>Soul Food is a 1997 American comedy-drama film written and directed by George Tillman Jr. in his major studio debut. Featuring an ensemble cast, the film stars Vanessa Williams, Vivica A. Fox, Nia Long, Michael Beach, Mekhi Phifer, Jeffrey D. Sams, Irma P. Hall, Gina Ravera and Brandon Hammond. The story centers on the trials of an extended Black-American family, held together by longstanding family traditions which begin to fade as serious problems take center stage.

Tillman based the family in the film on his own and &quot;Soul Food&quot; was widely acclaimed for presenting a more positive image of African-Americans than is typically seen in Hollywood films. In 2000, Showtime premiered a one-hour television series based upon the film. In 2015, it was announced that 20th Century Fox is planning a sequel for the film called &quot;More Soul Food&quot;, written by Tillman.

==Plot==
&quot;Soul Food,&quot; told through the eyes of 11-year-old Ahmad, follows the trials of the Joseph family, a close-knit Chicago family that gets together to have Sunday dinner every week, with plenty of soul food to go around. Mother (Big Mama) Joe has three daughters, who each have had varying success in life: oldest daughter Teri has become a successful lawyer but has a strained relationship with younger sister Maxine, Ahmad&#x27;s mother, who stole and eventually married Teri&#x27;s former boyfriend, Kenny. Teri is currently married to Miles, a lawyer who quits his job to pursue his dream of being an R&amp;B musician, which Teri doesn&#x27;t support. Youngest daughter Robin —nicknamed &quot;Bird&quot;—has just opened a barbershop/beauty parlor, and married Lem, an ex-convict.

Life becomes complicated when Mother Joe, the diabetic but wise and caring matriarch of the family and the glue that holds it together, suffers a debilitating stroke during an operation to amputate her leg and slips into a coma, dying shortly after sharing a last word of advice with Ahmad when she awakens five weeks later. Without her guidance, the family begins to fall apart in the interim. Teri takes in her troubled cousin Faith, who bonds with Miles over a love of the arts. The two are caught having sex by Teri, which later leads to a near-violent confrontation at Kenny and Maxine&#x27;s anniversary party when she furiously comes after the two with a knife. Meanwhile, Lem cannot find a job due to his criminal record, so Bird makes an uneasy deal with her former boyfriend Simuel St. James to get Lem a job. This leads to a heated confrontation between Lem and Bird when he finds out, and during their argument, Teri overhears and mistakenly believes Lem was physically threatening her sister. Teri hires her cousin Blimp to teach Lem a lesson, but when the two men fight, which ends with Lem pulling a gun, the police become involved and Lem is arrested on assault and illegal gun possession charges.

Realizing her mistake, Teri calls in a few favors to have Lem released and later apologizes to him. The fighting between Teri and Maxine soon causes the Sunday dinners to stop and the Joseph family tradition to be broken after forty years due to the ongoing tensions. Everything comes to a head when, after Teri decides to sell the Joseph family home rather than get stuck with most of her mother&#x27;s hospital bills, Maxine and Bird file an injunction to stop the sale, setting the stage for a major legal battle within the family. Throughout all this, Ahmad becomes worried about the state of his extended family and, following Big Mama&#x27;s passing conspires to find a way to bring them all back together.

Ahmad tells his relatives about a stash of money that Big Mama had hidden away some time ago but everyone dismisses him, believing it to be a myth. However, Ahmad manages to get everyone together for another Sunday dinner by promising them the whereabouts of the money. The dinner is uneasy as everyone starts confronting their issues, and eventually, they realize there is no money. Maxine chastises her son for lying, but Ahmad says tearfully that it was the only way to get everyone back together again, citing it as Big Mama&#x27;s dying wish. As Maxine comforts her son, the kitchen catches on fire due to Ahmad having accidentally left a towel on the stove, and they all work together to try and to put it out. Just as they finish putting the fire out, Uncle Pete, Big Mama&#x27;s brother, comes down with his television and drops it to reveal the money that Big Mama had hidden away.

Things start to go well for the family. Miles still comes by for Sunday dinner even though he and Teri are divorcing; Lem and Bird are expecting their first child; Teri and Maxine have made peace and the former opts to not sell the family house. Faith is finally becoming part of the family again and Uncle Pete, who never came out of his room, starts to join the family.

Halle Berry and Whitney Houston were both considered for the role of Teri. Regina King, Kenya Moore and Jada Pinkett Smith were all considered for the role of Bird. Vivica A. Fox auditioned for the role of Teri, but landed the role of Maxine instead. The character Miles (Michael Beach) plays keyboards in an R&amp;B group called &quot;Milestone&quot;; the vocalists of the group are portrayed by two sibling teams of professional R&amp;B performers: brothers K-Ci and Jo-Jo Hailey (of Jodeci and K-Ci &amp; JoJo); and Babyface and his brothers Kevon Edmonds and Melvin Edmonds (both of After 7).

==Production==
&quot;Soul Food&quot; was shot primarily on location in the Chicago area. A later Tillman-produced film, &quot;Barbershop,&quot; would also take place in and be shot on location in Chicago.

==Soundtrack==

A soundtrack containing R&amp;B and hip-hop was released on August 19, 1997 by LaFace Records. It peaked at #3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was eventually certified 2x Multi-Platinum for over 2 million copies sold.

==Reception==

&quot;Soul Food&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. It holds an 82% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 44 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Much like its titular cuisine, &quot;Soul Food&quot; blends a series of savory ingredients to offer warm, generous helpings of nourishment and comfort&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 68 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare grade of &quot;A+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars.
Godfrey Cheshire of &quot;Variety magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;Soul Food serves up family melodrama-cum-comedy that&#x27;s tasty and satisfying, if not particularly profound or original.&quot;
The film earned $43,700,855 during its original theatrical run. The film opened at #3 in its opening weekend at $11,197,897 behind &quot;The Peacemaker&#x27;s&quot; opening weekend and &quot;In &amp; Out&#x27;s&quot; second.

==Awards and nominations==

Williams and Fox were nominated for an Image Award for &quot;Outstanding Lead Actress in a Motion Picture&quot;; Williams won, while Hammond won for &quot;Outstanding Youth Actor/Actress&quot; and Hall won for &quot;Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture.&quot; Phifer and Hall both appeared in HBO&#x27;s 1999 adaptation of &quot;A Lesson Before Dying,&quot; the 1993 novel by Ernest J. Gaines. Hammond, Beach, and Sams all appeared in the 1995 film &quot;Waiting to Exhale,&quot; where Beach played the father of Hammond. Hall and Beach both appeared in the 1996 film &quot;A Family Thing.&quot; &quot;Soul Food&quot; spawned a follow-up cable television show on the Showtime network. &quot;Soul Food: The Series&quot; aired from 2000-2004 on Showtime and currently airs in reruns on TV One.

<text>Bilharz is a lunar impact crater that lies in the eastern part of the Mare Fecunditatis. It is the largest member of a close triple-crater formation with Atwood to the east and Naonobu to the northeast. To the southeast is the crater Langrenus.

The interior of this crater has been resurfaced by basaltic lava, leaving the floor flat, shallow, and nearly featureless with just a few very small sub-craters. There is no central peak at the midpoint. The outer rim remains circular and only slightly worn.

Prior to being named by the International Astronomical Union in 1976, this crater was identified as Langrenus F.

<doc id="1073960" wikidata="Q1499073" url="?curid=1073960" title="Tomato paste">
<text>Tomato paste is a thick paste made from tomatoes, which are cooked for several hours to reduce water content, straining out seeds and skins, and cooking the liquid again to reduce the base to a thick, rich concentrate. It is used to impart an intense tomato flavour to a variety of dishes, such as pasta, soups and braised meat. It is used as an ingredient in many world cuisines.

By contrast, tomato purée is a liquid with a thinner consistency than tomato paste, while tomato sauce is even thinner in consistency.

== History and traditions ==
Tomato paste is a traditional food ingredient used in many cuisines. One traditional practice was applied by spreading out a much-reduced tomato sauce on wooden boards that were set outdoors under the hot sun to dry the paste until it was thick enough, when it was scraped up and held together in a dense mass. Commercial production uses tomatoes with thick pericarp walls and lower overall moisture.

=== Regional differences ===
In the UK, &quot;tomato paste&quot; is also referred to as &quot;concentrate&quot;. In the US, &quot;tomato paste&quot; is simply concentrated tomato solids (no seeds or skin), sometimes with added sweetener (high fructose corn syrup), and with a standard of identity (in the Code of Federal Regulations, see 21 CFR 155.191). &quot;Tomato purée&quot; has a lower tomato soluble solids requirement, the cutoff being 24%. For comparison, typical fresh round tomatoes have a soluble solid content of 3.5–5.5% (refractometric Brix), while cherry tomatoes have double the amount.

== Uses ==
Tomato paste is added to dishes to impart an intense flavour, particularly the natural umami flavour found in tomatoes. Examples of dishes in which tomato paste may be commonly used include pasta sauces, soups, and braised meat. The paste is typically added early in the cooking process and sautéed to achieve caramelization.

Based on the manufacturing conditions, the paste can be the basis for making ketchup or reconstituted tomato juice:
* Hot break: heated to about , pectin is preserved, paste is thicker and can be used for ketchup
* Warm break: heated to about , colour is not preserved, but flavour is preserved
* Cold break: heated to about , colour and flavour are preserved, so it can be reconstituted into juice

<doc id="1073964" wikidata="Q1377863" url="?curid=1073964" title="European Higher Education Area">
<text>The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) was launched in March 2010, during the Budapest-Vienna Ministerial Conference, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Bologna Process.

As the main objective of the Bologna Process since its inception in 1999, the EHEA was meant to ensure more comparable, compatible and coherent higher education systems in Europe. Between 1999 and 2010, all the efforts of the Bologna Process members were targeted to creating the European Higher Education Area, which became reality with the Budapest-Vienna Declaration of March 2010. In order to join the EHEA, a country must sign and ratify the European Cultural Convention treaty.
Denmark was the first country outside the UK and the US to introduce the 3+2+3 system.

== General objectives ==
The key objectives are promoting the mobility of students and staff, the employability of graduates and the European dimension in higher education. Coping with the diversity of their national systems, the EHEA members agree to adopt:

* A common system of easily readable and comparable diplomas;
* A framework based mainly on three main cycles: bachelor, master, doctorate;
* A common quality assurance system.

== The main actions of the European Area ==

=== Student mobility and mutual recognition of diplomas ===
Student mobility implies a coherent system of studies and diplomas:

* The ECTS credit system facilitates the recognition of study periods between EHEA institutions. An academic year normally corresponds to the validation of 60 credits; one credit needs approximately 25 to 30 hours of student work (courses, projects, personal work, etc.).
* The European Qualifications Framework defines 3 main cycles (first cycle, second cycle and third cycle). Each cycle is defined by the number of credits required and the description of the learning outcomes and skills expected for each graduate:
** The first cycle (180 to 240 ECTS credits), generally leading to the bachelor&#x27;s degree.
** The second cycle (60 to 120 ECTS credits), generally leading to the master&#x27;s degree.
** The 3rd cycle, leading to the Doctorate degree.
* In 2018, a short cycle was introduced (90 to 120 ECTS).

=== Quality assurance ===
The European area does not aim to standardize national higher education systems, but to make them more readable and to build mutual trust between higher education institutions. The mutual recognition of diplomas is based, not on the comparison of the content of the programs, but on the definition and validation of the targeted learning outcomes. From its origin, the need for a common quality assurance system arose in the EHEA. The European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ENQA) was responsible for defining the standards and guidelines, which are broken down into 3 chapters:

* Internal quality assurance in institutions: each institution must have a policy and an internal organization of self-assessment and continuous improvement, implemented with all its stakeholders (students, staff, former graduates and representatives of society and employers).
* External quality assurance: institutions must submit their organization and results to external and independent evaluations (including accreditation agencies).
* Quality assurance of accreditation agencies: the agencies must act in full autonomy (in particular from public or private powers) to evaluate the institutions and their training, and to bring the results to the attention of the public.

=== European programs ===

==== Erasmus and Erasmus Mundus programs ====
The Erasmus and Erasmus Mundus Programs are initiatives of the European Union to promote the mobility of students and teachers. They therefore primarily concern the 27 countries of the Union, with which other countries such as Norway, Iceland and Turkey have joined forces. Strictly speaking, these are not programs of the European Area, but they largely contribute to its development.

==== European Universities initiative ====
In 2017, the European Union launched the European Universities initiative through the Erasmus+ programme, with &quot;the ambition to support at least 60 European Universities alliances involving more than 500 higher education institutions by mid-2024&quot;. The first 19 alliances were launched in 2019, followed by 24 in a second round in 2020, and further rounds in 2022, 2023 and 2024, leading to 64 European Universities alliances covering over 560 institutions across 35 European countries, including all 27 EU member states, . A further nine proposed alliances were awarded the &#x27;seal of excellence&#x27; quality label but not funded through Erasmus+. European University alliances also include over 2,000 associate partners, which can include higher education institutions from other (non-Erasmus+) EHEA countries as well as non-educational partners such as private sector companies and public authorities. 

In 2023, the European Commission announced over €3 million in funding to support universities from Ukraine and the western Balkans joining European Universities alliances as associate members, leading to almost 30 Ukrainian universities joining alliances in that round. However, the UK and Switzerland, which do not participate in Erasmus+, have only limited involvement as universities from those countries have to pay a membership fee and are limited to being associated partners.

<text>Ctesibius is a small lunar impact crater that is located near the equator, on the far side of the Moon. It is named after the ancient Greek-Egyptian inventor Ctesibius. It lies between the larger crater Abul Wáfa to the west and the slightly smaller Heron to the east.

The outer wall of Ctesibius is wide and sharp-edged, with little erosion. A low ridge is attached to the southern rim, and curves to the south-southeast. At the center of the relatively flat interior is a low ridge. Faint traces of ray material lies across the western floor and rim from Necho to the southeast.

<text>Kid Thomas (1896–1987), born Thomas Valentine, was an American jazz trumpeter and bandleader.

Kid Thomas was born in Reserve, Louisiana and came to New Orleans in his youth. In the early 1920s, he gained a reputation as a hot trumpet man. Starting in 1926 he led his own band, for decades based in the New Orleans suburb of Algiers, Louisiana. The band was long popular with local dancers.

Kid Thomas had perhaps the city&#x27;s longest lasting old-style traditional jazz dance band. Unlike many other musicians, Thomas was unaffected by the influence of Louis Armstrong and later developments of jazz, continuing to play in his distinctive hot, bluesy, sometimes percussive style. His style was that which is characterized often as, &quot;New Orleans Jazz&quot;, in order to differentiate it from the influences that arose from other parts of the country through the years. He was always open to playing the popular tunes of the day (even into the rock &amp; roll era) as he thought any good dance bandleader should do, but he played everything in a style of a New Orleans dance hall of the early 1920s.

Kid Thomas started attracting a wider following with his first recordings in the 1950s. His band played regularly at Preservation Hall from the 1960s through the 1980s. Kid Thomas also toured extensively for the Hall, including a Russian tour, and was often a guest at European clubs and festivals, working with various local bands as well as his own. During the 1960s Kid Thomas recorded extensively for the Jazz Crusade label both with his own band and with Big Bill Bissonnette&#x27;s Easy Riders Jazz Band. He made more than 20 tours with the Easy Riders in the U.S. Northeast.

In the mid 1980s, as Kid Thomas&#x27;s strength started to wane, Preservation Hall management brought in Wendell Brunious, at first as second trumpet. Brunious took over most of the trumpet playing in Kid Thomas&#x27;s final year or so, although Kid Thomas continued to lead the band and keep rhythm with a slap stick.

He died in 1987 and was buried at All Saints Catholic Church in Algiers, New Orleans.

<doc id="1073978" wikidata="Q1546127" url="?curid=1073978" title="Lisbon Recognition Convention">
<text>The Lisbon Recognition Convention, officially the Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education in the European Region, is an international convention of the Council of Europe elaborated together with the UNESCO. This is the main legal agreement on credential evaluation in Europe.

As of 2024, the convention has been ratified by all 47 member states of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. It has also been ratified by the Council of Europe non-member states Australia, Belarus, Canada, the Holy See, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and New Zealand. The United States has signed but not ratified the convention.

==Aims==
The Convention stipulates that degrees and periods of study must be recognised unless &quot;substantial differences&quot; can be proved by the institution that is charged with recognition. Students and graduates are guaranteed fair procedures under the convention.
It is named after Lisbon, Portugal, where it was signed in 1997, and entered into force on 1 February 1999 (or later in some countries, subject to ratification date).

==Convention bodies==
The convention established two bodies which oversee, promote and facilitate the implementation of the convention:
# the Committee of the convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education in the European Region, and
# the European Network of Information Centres on Academic Mobility and Recognition (the ENIC Network).

The committee is responsible for promoting the application of the convention and overseeing its implementation. To this end, it can adopt, by a majority of the Signatory Parties, recommendations, declarations, protocols and models of good practice to guide the competent authorities of the Parties. Before making its decisions, the Committee seeks the opinion of the ENIC Network. As for the ENIC Network, it upholds and assists the practical implementation of the convention by the competent national authorities.

==Bologna Process==
The Lisbon Recognition Convention is an important instrument for the Bologna Process which aims at creating the &quot;European higher education area&quot; by making academic degree standards and quality assurance standards more comparable and compatible throughout Europe.

==Historical background==
The possibility for students to study abroad has been recognised as an essential element of European integration since the foundation of the Council of Europe in 1949. Within the Council of Europe, several international treaties were elaborated in this field: starting with the right to education under Article 2 of the first Protocol of 1952 to the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention on the Equivalence of Diplomas leading to Admission to Universities was opened for signature in 1953, the European Convention on the Equivalence of Periods of University Study in 1956, the European Convention on the Academic Recognition of University Qualifications in 1959, the European Agreement on continued Payment of Scholarships to students studying abroad in 1969, and the European Convention on the General Equivalence of Periods of University Study in 1990.

In addition, under Article 2 of the Council of Europe&#x27;s European Cultural Convention of 1954, each Contracting Party shall, insofar as may be possible: encourage the study by its own nationals of the languages, history and civilisation of the other Contracting Parties and grant facilities to those Parties to promote such studies in its territory; and endeavour to promote the study of its language or languages, history and civilisation in the territory of the other Contracting Parties and grant facilities to the nationals of those Parties to pursue such studies in its territory.

<text>Heron is a small lunar impact crater that lies on the far side of the Moon, less than 20 kilometers from the equator. It lies between the slightly larger crater Ctesibius just to the west and Soddy a little farther to the east. Almost directly to the north is the prominent crater King.

This formation is an undistinguished, circular crater. The interior floor is relatively flat and featureless. There is a tiny craterlet along the eastern rim that has a slightly higher albedo than the remainder of the crater.

This crater is also called Hero in some references. It was named after 1st century BC Egyptian inventor Heron (or Hero) of Alexandria.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Heron.

<doc id="1074009" wikidata="Q4671282" url="?curid=1074009" title="Academic mobility">
<text>Academic mobility refers to students, teachers and researchers in higher education moving to another institution inside or outside of their own country to study or teach for a limited time.

The Bologna process regulates academic mobility within European higher education area.

Mobile students are usually divided into two groups: &quot;Free-movers&quot; are students who travel entirely on their own initiative, while &quot;programme students&quot; use exchange programmes at a department, faculty, institution, or national level (such as Erasmus, Nordplus or Fulbright). Nowadays, the traditional Erasmus exchange (which involves travelling) has been complemented with virtual mobility, or Virtual Erasmus, in which students from different countries may study together without leaving their home.

==Students==

===Background===
According to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the mobility of international students has significantly increased in the past four decades, from 250,000 in 1965 to approximately 3.7 million in 2011. These statistics show the academic mobility of international students that aim for a degree rather than short-term &quot;study abroad&quot; education. UNESCO suggests that there are over 2.7 million students studying in a country other than their origin country. The group of Asian students is the largest constituent part of all students who enrolled in the overseas schools. They make up 45 percent of total of international students in OECD countries and 52 percent of total in non-OECD countries.

===Barrier===

Most mobile students suffer from many barriers both in their lives and academic activities. For example, Sanchez, Fornerino and Zhang did a survey among 477 U.S., French and Chinese students who studied in their home countries. This survey suggests that the students from these three countries face or fear barriers such as family barriers, financial barriers, psychological barriers and social barriers. The psychological barriers relate to aspects such as homesickness or the fear of the new environment and the social barriers usually relate to friends and family. Different students are various in degree of these problem.

For the credit mobile students, they will meet some specific academic difficulties. A survey by Klahr and Ratti emphasizes the importance of the lack of recognition of periods abroad and credit transfer. Besides, insufficient knowledge of academic prerequisites and qualifications of various countries, differences in the structure of the academic term, disparities in the times at which examinations are taken, these are all common problem of credit mobile students when they engage in academic activities. Moreover, the lack of foreign language skills is considered as another big barrier to most of the mobile students, not only the credit mobile students.

Female mobile students have some particular barriers because of their gender role. The female mobile students, especially who are in older in age, are tied to a specific spatial context by private responsibilities. For example, partnering and children will have a great effect on the female&#x27;s academic mobility. Some findings from qualitative interviews with researchers from Bulgaria and Poland confirmed the great significance of personal and family relationships for female&#x27;s academic mobility, either as a barrier or as an incentive.

==Researchers==

Researchers are employed on casualised temporary contracts in some universities, which force them to relocate around every three years when funding streams change, typically to another country. Historically this was done just one for a &quot;postdoc&quot; research project, but modern funding now devotes far more money to contract research than teaching posts, and so most researchers now face a whole career of living in this way. This often leads to the breakup of their families and friends and sometimes to mental health problems.

With 57% of its researchers coming from other countries, Switzerland is the country with the world highest proportion of foreign researchers.
Canada, Australia, the United States, Sweden and the United Kingdom have between 30 and 50% of their researchers coming from foreign countries.

The Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Belgium and France have between 10 and 30% of their researchers coming from foreign countries.
Brazil, Spain, Japan, Italy and India have less than 10% of their researchers coming from foreign countries.

Switzerland and India are among the countries with the highest proportion of their researchers going to work in other countries.

<doc id="1074010" wikidata="Q12060410" url="?curid=1074010" title="Hollins University">
<text>Hollins University is a private university in Hollins, Virginia, United States. Founded in 1842 as Valley Union Seminary in the historical settlement of Botetourt Springs, it is one of the oldest institutions of higher education for women in the US.

Hollins enrolls about 800 undergraduate and graduate students. As Virginia&#x27;s first chartered women&#x27;s college, undergraduate programs are female-only. Men are admitted to the graduate-level programs.

Hollins is known for its undergraduate and graduate writing programs, whose alumni include Pulitzer Prize-winning author Annie Dillard, former U.S. poet laureate Natasha Trethewey, and poet Henry S. Taylor. Other prominent alumnae include sportswriter Mary Garber, 2006 Man Booker Prize winner Kiran Desai, physicist Mary K. Gaillard, &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; author Margaret Wise Brown, author Lee Smith, photographer Sally Mann, and Ellen Malcolm, founder of EMILY&#x27;s List.

==History==
The area where Hollins College developed was the site of Botetourt Springs. The area developed as a resort which operated from 1820 to 1841. It then became the site of a short-lived seminary, whose property and buildings were acquired by Valley Union Seminary.

===1842–1855: Valley Union Seminary and Charles Lewis Cocke===

The institution of higher learning that would become Hollins was first established in 1842 by the Reverend Joshua Bradley as the coeducational Valley Union Seminary. Bradley left in 1845 for Missouri, and in 1846, the seminary&#x27;s trustees hired a 25-year-old math instructor from Richmond named Charles Lewis Cocke to direct the institution. The same year, Cocke established the first school for enslaved people in the Roanoke area; many students at the school worked at the seminary. In 1851, Cocke abolished the men&#x27;s department of the institution, and in 1852, the school became a women&#x27;s college called the Roanoke Female Seminary. In 1855, Lynchburg residents John and Ann Halsey Hollins gave $5,000, and the school was renamed Hollins Institute. The Hollinses gave an additional $12,500 in gifts before their deaths in 1859 and 1864 respectively.

===Slaves and servants===
Before the Civil War, Hollins used the labor of enslaved people to build and maintain the grounds. In addition, many students brought &quot;servants&quot; with them who were likely slaves. After slavery was abolished, Hollins employed many formerly enslaved people, mostly women whose names were not recorded. Students were encouraged to ignore these workers in the college handbook during this era, and employees were forbidden from developing friendly relationships with women studying at Hollins.

===1855–1870s: Family institution===
As the head of Hollins, Cocke saw his students as a part of a family and himself as their father figure. His pedagogy was based upon the &quot;southern sensibility that a lady was to be trained to submit to the order of men&quot;. Though he thought women studying at Hollins were best confined to domestic duties, he still placed great value on intellectual excellence. Cocke considered the higher education of young women in the South to be his life&#x27;s calling; in 1857, he wrote that &quot;young women require the same thorough and rigid mental training as that afforded to young men&quot;. Hollins was known as a rigorous institution where degrees were not easily earned during Cocke&#x27;s tenure. Students at the school during this period remember the &quot;unbelieveably serious&quot; instruction and &quot;high standards&quot;. During this period, Hollins also pioneered several academic practices; it became the first school in the United States to begin a system of elective study, and it was the first to establish an English department under a full professor.

===1880s–1901===
The Hollins of Cocke&#x27;s ambitions was limited by region, as Cocke was interested in educating women only from Southern states. Because of this limited scope, Hollins struggled to &quot;professionalize&quot; in the 1880s and beyond. Its remote location far from the better respected and funded men&#x27;s institutions put Hollins in contrast with the Seven Sisters in the Northeast. Despite its academic rigor, Hollins and other southern women&#x27;s colleges were smaller and poorer than women&#x27;s college such as Smith College and Mount Holyoke in the north. However, Hollins saw its enrollment rise in the last two decades of the 19th century.

From 1846 until his death, Cocke did not take a stipulated salary from the institution so that the trustees could instead put the school&#x27;s income toward paying faculty and improving the grounds. In 1900, the board of trustees found themselves so thoroughly in debt to Cocke that the school was deeded to him and his family.

===1901–1932: Matty Cocke and accreditation===
Charles Lewis Cocke&#x27;s death in 1901 at the age of eighty-one was a grave moment for the Hollins Institute, but the transition to the leadership of his forty-five-year-old daughter Matty Cocke was smooth. &quot;Miss Matty,&quot; as she preferred to be called, was intent on preserving the &quot;genteel&quot; atmosphere her father had cultivated at Hollins. Though she was a &quot;charismatic leader&quot; and the first woman to head a college in Virginia, Miss Cocke was not interested in waging any battles for women&#x27;s education; indeed, she let her nephews, Joseph Turner and M. Estes Cocke, handle the school&#x27;s financial dealings entirely. Miss Cocke shared the opinion of President John McBryde of Sweet Briar Women&#x27;s College, who in 1907 decried the &quot;independence&quot; sought by Vassar and other members of the Seven Sisters and suggested instead that women&#x27;s education focus on &quot;grace [and] refinement&quot;. In 1911, the school was renamed Hollins College.

Because the Cocke family owned Hollins, the school could not raise an endowment through alumnae donations. Further stalling Hollins&#x27; prosperity was President Matty Cocke&#x27;s distaste for fundraising. Due to their financial limitations, Hollins was not able to hire high-quality faculty or assemble an up-to-date library or laboratory, making accreditation hard to achieve. This was not unusual for the time; as of 1916, only seven southern women&#x27;s college were certified by professional organizations as &quot;standard,&quot; while both Hollins and Sweet Briar were designated as &quot;approximate&quot;. The Cocke family agreed to turn over ownership if sufficient funds were raised in 1925, but the Depression slowed their efforts. A scathing 1930 letter from alumna Eudora Ramsay Richardson in the &quot;South Atlantic Quarterly&quot; indicted the American Association of University Women for regional bias. Richardson&#x27;s letter and prompting from the presidents of Mount Holyoke and Bryn Mawr sped up the accreditation process. The Cocke family turned the school over to a board of trustees and President Cocke tendered her resignation in 1932, as the school finally gained accreditation.

===1933–present===
Hollins was home to the first exhibition gallery in the Roanoke region in 1948. In 1950 when he was 31 years of age John R. Everett was elected President of Hollins College, a position he held until he resigned in 1960. One of the first writer-in-residence programs in America began at Hollins in 1959. Hollins was home to the first graduate program focusing on the writing and study of children&#x27;s literature, established in 1993. Hollins University Quadrangle is on the National Register of Historic Places.The institution was renamed Hollins College in 1911, and in 1998 it became Hollins University. Nancy Oliver Gray led Hollins from 2005 until she retired in 2017; that same year, Pareena Gupta Lawrence, an economist and an Asian-American immigrant, became Hollins&#x27;s twelfth president. 

In April 2019, the president directed the temporary removal of four volumes of the university yearbook from the library&#x27;s digital commons after the 2019 blackface controversy involving Virginia Governor Ralph Northam. The four volumes (1915, 1950, 1969, 1985) contained photographs of students wearing blackface. The university issued a statement saying access to the digitized yearbooks would be restored as soon as the university developed accompanying &quot;educational information regarding the history and practice of blackface to help all of us understand why it is a racist and prejudicial practice.&quot; The removal was criticized by the Society of American Archivists, the American Library Association&#x27;s Office of Intellectual Freedom, and the Virginia Library Association. The digitized volumes were still available on the Internet Archive, and all physical copies of the yearbooks were also available in the library. The Wyndham Robertson Library and the Working Group on Slavery issued a statement in response objecting to the decision, stating that, &quot;we cannot and do not support any erasure of institutional history, even if only temporarily&quot; and recommended that the affected yearbooks be made electronically accessible again along with a statement on the content. Access to the four digitized volumes was restored on April 9, less than one week after their removal along with the added educational content.

Mary Dana Hinton became the thirteenth president of Hollins University on August 1, 2020. She is the first African American president in the university&#x27;s history. 

==Campus==
The Hollins College Quadrangle consists of six contributing buildings. The earliest buildings were built for the Botetourt Springs resort which operated from 1820 to 1841 and then became a seminary. When it failed, the property and buildings were acquired for Valley Union Seminary.

The first built specifically for the new college is East Building, erected 1856–58 opposite the hotel building. The Main building was built in 1861 at the north end of the quadrangle, Bradley Chapel was erected in 1883 between the East and Main Buildings, the octagonal Botetourt Hall was built in 1890, and the Charles Cocke Memorial Library was built in 1908 at the south end of the quadrangle.

The main dorm of Hollins University was decorated and improved in the 19th century by local carpenter and woodworker Gustave A. Sedon.

Hollins College Quadrangle was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.
Founded in 2004, the Eleanor D. Wilson Museum, an art museum, is housed at the university.

==Housing==

There are nine residence halls on campus. Most first-years live in Tinker and Randolph in doubles. Sophomores and juniors generally live in West or in singles in Tinker and Randolph, and primarily seniors (with a few exceptions) live in Main, or the university apartments on campus. Housing choices are determined by a lottery number given after the housing deposit is paid in the spring; the lottery numbers are assigned randomly from within a preset range determined by class year.

All undergraduates are required to live on campus. The exceptions to this rule are Horizon (nontraditional) students, married students or those with children, those over the age of 23, or those whose official residence with parents or guardians is in the Roanoke Valley area.
==Traditions and folklore==

Hollins University has a number of beloved traditions, many of which have been observed for more than 100 years. Tinker Day is one of them, dating back to the 1880s. One day in October, after the first frost, classes are cancelled so that students, faculty, and staff can climb nearby Tinker Mountain while wearing colorful and silly costumes. After a lunch of fried chicken and Tinker Cake, the students and new faculty perform skits and sing songs before returning to campus. The exact date of the celebration is a closely held secret.

==Academics==
Hollins offers small classes with a 9:1 student-teacher ratio in a variety of majors. The most popular majors are English, psychology, studio art, business, and biology. Currently Hollins offers graduate programs in dance (M.F.A.), creative writing (M.F.A.), children&#x27;s literature (M.A., M.F.A.), liberal studies (M.A.L.S.), playwriting (M.F.A.), screenwriting and film studies (M.A., M.F.A.), and teaching (M.A.T.). , Hollins offers a graduate-level certificate in Children&#x27;s Book Illustration.

Hollins was one of the first colleges in the nation to establish a study abroad program, launching Hollins Abroad-Paris in 1955. Approximately half of Hollins students have an international learning experience. Hollins runs its own programs in London and Paris; non-Hollins students are free to apply to the Hollins Abroad-London and-Paris programs. Hollins students can also study through Hollins-sponsored programs in Argentina, Germany, Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Japan, Mexico, Spain, South Africa, and in various other countries through the School for Field Studies. Hollins also sponsors an annual service-learning project in Lucea, Jamaica.

===Curriculum===
A liberal arts school, Hollins has designed its own Education through Skills and Perspectives (ESP) general education requirement program. Rather than focusing on the usual math, science, English, and history booklist of required courses, Hollins requires each student to take a variety of skills classes (writing, oral communication, applied quantitative reasoning, and applied research techniques) and perspectives classes (aesthetic analysis, creative expression, ancient and/or medieval worlds, modern and/or contemporary worlds, social and cultural diversities, scientific inquiry, and global systems and languages). These requirements can be completed in as few as 8 courses but aim to help the students explore other fields of study while rounding out their basic understanding of the world.

Hollins offers majors in the fields of studio art, art history, biology, business, chemistry, classical studies, communication studies, dance, economics, English, environmental studies, film, French, gender and women&#x27;s studies, history, interdisciplinary studies, international studies, mathematics, music, philosophy, political science, psychology, public health, religious studies, sociology, Spanish, and theatre.

Other academic offerings include: arts management certificate, the Batten certificate in leadership studies, Hollins Outdoor Leadership certificate, education, first-year seminars, three-year accelerated degree program, pre-law, pre-med, pre-nursing, pre-vet, short term, and Horizon program for adult women.

===Writing program===
The graduate program in creative writing was founded by Louis D. Rubin, Jr., in 1960, but Hollins has offered classes in creative writing for even longer. In 2008 the Jackson Center for Creative Writing was established through a private donation from Susan Gager Jackson &#x27;68 and her husband, John Jackson, of Far Hills, New Jersey.

The Jackson Center for Creative Writing is home to Hollins&#x27; esteemed undergraduate and graduate writing programs, which have produced dozens of writers of national and international acclaim, including Lee Smith &#x27;67 and Pulitzer Prize winners Annie Dillard &#x27;67, M.A. &#x27;68; Henry S. Taylor M.A. &#x27;66; and Natasha Trethewey M.A. &#x27;91. Kiran Desai M.A. &#x27;94 won both the Man Booker Prize for Fiction and the National Book Critics Circle Award. The fiction of Madison Smartt Bell M.A. &#x27;81 has been recognized by a Strauss Living Award, and numerous other Hollins writers have received NEA, Guggenheim, and countless other grants and awards for their poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, contributing to the cultural life of the nation that is disproportionate to the program&#x27;s size. In fact, Hollins&#x27;s creative writing program has been called &quot;the most productive writing program in America&quot; by &quot;Creative Writing in America.&quot;

The campus has three literary magazines. &quot;Cargoes&quot;, which won the Undergraduate Literary Prize for content by the Association of Writers and Writing Programs in 2005, &quot;The Album&quot;, which is offered as a more alternative campus periodical, and &quot;Gravel&quot;, which focuses on student work centered around multicultural and diverse identities. R. H. W. Dillard, Cathryn Hankla, and Jeanne Larsen are among the writers who teach at Hollins.

==Athletics==
Hollins University athletics is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing throughout Virginia in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC) since the 1981–82 academic year.

Hollins competes in eight intercollegiate varsity sports: basketball, cross country, riding, soccer, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball. In the past Hollins has had programs in golf, fencing, and field hockey. The last year that the university had a golf program was in the 2017–18 academic year. The school also had a lacrosse program, but it was discontinued in 2023.

Hollins does not have a mascot, and the sports teams do not have an official nickname. In 1989, students voted against 100 mascot ideas.

As part of its Education through Skills and Perspectives (ESP) general education requirement program, two regular terms of physical education course work are required for graduation.

==Student body==
In October 2019, Hollins released a new policy regarding applicants and students who may identify as transgender. The new policy states &quot;Hollins accepts applications from individuals who consistently live and identify as women.&quot; Students who begin to transition from female to male while at Hollins are still eligible to earn their degree.

===Clubs and organizations===
Hollins has a number of organizations that are open to all students.

The university has a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.

Freya walks take place on nights of special events or issues. Members of this secret society walk at night to call attention to or celebrate current events. They wear black-hooded robes to protect their anonymity and carry candles to symbolize hope. Since 1903, Freya has sought to emphasize the notion that &quot;concern for the community is a creative and active force&quot;.

<doc id="1074011" wikidata="Q2941659" url="?curid=1074011" title="Communist Party of India (Maoist)">
<text>The Communist Party of India (Maoist) is a banned Maoist communist political party and militant organization in India which aims to overthrow the Republic of India through protracted people&#x27;s war. It was founded on 21 September 2004, through the merger of the CPIML People&#x27;s War and the MCCI. The party has been designated as a terrorist organisation in India under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act since 2009.

In 2006, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh referred to the Maoists as &quot;the single biggest internal security challenge&quot; for India, and said that the &quot;deprived and alienated sections of the population&quot; form the backbone of the Maoist movement in India. The government officials have declared that, in 2013, 76 districts in the country were affected by &quot;left wing extremism&quot;, with another 106 districts in ideological influence. In 2020, the activities of the party began to increase again in Telangana and other areas. Chhattisgarh is often affected by the party&#x27;s militant activities.

In 2024, the party faced a major setback when the government increased their counterinsurgency operations in states affected by the insurgency.

==History==
The Communist Party of India (Maoist) was founded on 21 September 2004, through the merger of the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) People&#x27;s War (People&#x27;s War Group), and the Maoist Communist Centre of India (MCCI). The high-level bi-lateral meetings between the two erstwhile parties started in February 2003 and continued for several months, entailing discussions on major questions concering their future political orientation. In the course of these, unity could be found and 5 Key Papers for the new, unified organisation were finalized and adopted: 

• “Hold High the Bright Red Banner of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism”, a primarily ideological document explaining the unified party&#x27;s understanding of the development and content of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. It forms the cornerstone of the party&#x27;s ideological-political principles and views.

• “Party Programme”, a concise 35-point outline of the party&#x27;s general political line, synthesized out of more than 30 years of experience of the MCCI and the PWG. It includes the Indian Revolution&#x27;s minimum and maximum programmes for establishing Socialism-Communism as to the Maoists.

• “Party Constitution”, the foremost political-organisational document laying down the Maoists&#x27; general programme, the rights and duties of their members, party discipline, organisational structure and how they acquire their funds for operations.

• “Strategy and Tactics of the Indian Revolution”, an elaborate class analysis of Indian society, followed up by &quot;the determination of the main blow&quot; of the CPI (Maoist)&#x27;s forces at its given stage, as well as the forms of struggle and organisation the Maoists see as appropriate for achieving their aim of &quot;New Democratic and Socialist Revolution&quot;. 

• “Political Resolution”, a detailed analysis of India&#x27;s Domestic Situation, as well as the International Situation, alongside its call for build the &quot;subjective forces&quot;, i.e. the communists&#x27; vanguard-capability, to utilize what they evaluated as an &quot;excellent revolutionary situation&quot;. 

The merger was first declared in a &quot;Unity Commune&quot; formed with extensive cultural programmes and security precautions which went on from early September to early October. Following that, the founding of the unified party was finally announced to the public on 14 October of the same year. In the course of the merger, a provisional central committee was constituted, with the erstwhile People&#x27;s War Group leader Muppala Lakshmana Rao, alias &quot;Ganapathi&quot;, as general secretary. Further, on May Day 2014, the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Naxalbari merged into the CPI (Maoist).

==Ideology==
The CPI (Maoist) observes that the Indian state is being &quot;run by a collaboration of imperialists, the comprador bourgeoisie and feudal lords.&quot; According to the South Asia Terrorism Portal, the two factions of the Party adhered to differing strands of communism prior to their 2004 merger, although &quot;both organizations shared their belief in the &#x27;annihilation of class enemies&#x27; and in extreme violence as a means to secure organizational goals.&quot; The People&#x27;s War Group (PWG) maintained a Marxist–Leninist stance, while the Maoist Communist Centre of India (MCCI) took a Maoist stance. After the merger, the PWG secretary of Andhra Pradesh announced that the newly formed CPI-Maoist would follow Marxism–Leninism–Maoism as its &quot;ideological basis guiding its thinking in all spheres of its activities.&quot; Included in this ideology is a commitment to &quot;protracted armed struggle&quot; to undermine and to seize power from the state. On May Day 2014, Ganapathy and Ajith (Secretary of the CPI (ML) Naxalbari) also issued a joint statement stating that &quot;the unified party would [continue to] take Marxism-Leninism-Maoism as its guiding ideology.&quot;

The ideology of the party is contained in a &quot;Party Programme.&quot; In the document, the Maoists denounce globalisation as a war on the people by market fundamentalists and the caste system as a form of social oppression. The CPI (Maoist) claim that they are conducting a &quot;people&#x27;s war&quot;, a strategic approach developed by Mao Zedong during the guerrilla warfare phase of the Chinese Communist Party. Their eventual objective is to install a &quot;people&#x27;s government&quot; via a New Democratic Revolution.

==Location and prominence==
CPI(Maoist) currently operates in the forest belt around central India in the states of Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Odisha. It is present even in remote regions of Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh, as well as in Bihar and the tribal-dominated areas in the borderlands of Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Odisha. The CPI (Maoist) aims to consolidate its power in this area and establish a Compact Revolutionary Zone from which to advance the people&#x27;s war in other parts of India. A 2005 &quot;Frontline&quot; cover story called the Bhamragad Taluka, where the Madia Gond Adivasis live, the heart of the Maoist-affected region in Maharashtra. Recently, the Indian government has claimed that in 2013, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal experienced [ideological] &quot;influence&quot; of &quot;Left Wing Extremism&quot;; while claiming that armed activity by the &quot;Left Wing&quot; extremists was noticed in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha and West Bengal.

==Organisation==
The current General Secretary of CPI (Maoist) is Nambala Keshava Rao &quot;alias&quot; Basavaraj. He was appointed after Muppala Lakshmana Rao, who uses the alias &quot;Ganapathy&quot;. The party hierarchy consists of the Regional Bureaus, which look after two or three states each, the State Committees, the Zonal Committees, the District Committees, and the &quot;dalams&quot; (armed squads). Communist writer Jan Myrdal noted that the CPI (Maoist) also organises events like &quot;The Leadership Training Programme&quot; to endure the forces of the state.

===Politburo===
As per the communist party policies the highest decision making body of the CPI (Maoist) is the Politburo, with thirteen or fourteen members, six of whom were killed or arrested between 2007 and 2010. Prashant Bose &quot;alias&quot; &quot;Kishan-da&quot; and Katakam Sudarshan &quot;alias&quot; Anand, are the two most prominent Politburo members of CPI (Maoist). B. Sudhakar &quot;alias&quot; &quot;Kiran&quot; is another Politburo member of CPI (Maoist). Shamsher Singh Sheri &quot;alias&quot; Karam Singh, who died of Cerebral Malaria-Jaundice on 30 October 2005, was also the party&#x27;s Politburo member. Between 2005 and 2011, the State captured several Politburo members of the party, which includes – Sushil Roy &quot;alias&quot; Som, Narayan Sanyal &quot;alias&quot; N. Prasad, Pramod Mishra, Amitabh Bagchi, Baccha Prasad Singh, Anukul Chandra Naskar and Akhilesh Yadav. Ashutosh Tudu and Anuj Thakur are another two of the arrested Politburo members of the party. Arvind Ji alias Deo Kumar Singh, a politburo member died in heart attack on 21, March 2018. Among those killed, Cherukuri Rajkumar &quot;alias&quot; &quot;Azad&quot; and Mallojula Koteswara Rao &quot;alias&quot; &quot;Kishenji&quot;, were two past members of the CPI (Maoist)&#x27;s Politburo. Politburo member Akkiraju Haragopal alias Ramkrishna died in October 2021 due to illness.

===Central Committee===
The Central Committee of the CPI (Maoist) takes command from the Politburo and passes on the information to its members, and has 32 members. During an interview in 2010, Anand told media personnels that out of the 45 members of the Central Committee of CPI (Maoist), 8 has been arrested and 22 has been killed by the agencies of the Indian government. Anuradha Ghandy, who died on 12 April 2008, was an eminent member of CPI (Maoist)&#x27;s Central Committee. Kadari Satyanarayan Reddy &quot;alias&quot; &quot;Kosa&quot;, Thippiri Tirupathi &quot;alias&quot; &quot;Devuji&quot;, Malla Raji Reddy and Mallujola Venugopal &quot;alias&quot; &quot;Bhupati&quot; are another three cadres and Central Committee members of the party. Madvi Hidma is the youngest Central Committee member of the party. As of 22 September 2011, nine of the Central Committee members were jailed, which includes – Moti Lal Soren, Vishnu, Varanasi Subramanyam, Shobha, Misir Besra, Jhantu Mukherjee, Vijay Kumar Arya. One more Central Committee member, Ravi Sharma, was also captured later. Ginugu Narsimha Reddy alias Jampanna surrendered to police in December 2017.

The CPI (Maoist) has a &quot;publication division&quot;. Besides volunteering as a Politburo member of the party, B. Sudhakar &quot;alias&quot; &quot;Kiran&quot; also works for its publication division.

===Military Commissions===
The Central Military Commission (CMC) is the main armed body of the CPI (Maoist), and it is constructed by its Central Committee. In addition to the CMC, the party has also raised state military commissions. The CMC is headed by Nambala Keshava Rao &quot;alias&quot; Basavaraj. Anand and Arvind Ji are another two members of the organisation&#x27;s CMC. Anuj Thakur is an arrested member of the CMC of the party. Kishenji and Chandramouli were also the members of the CPI (Maoist)&#x27;s CMC.

===Technical Committee===
Central Technical Committee (CTC) is given the responsibility of fabricating weapons and explosives. The Technical Committee consists of few selected members having special knowledge on science and research and works under the direct supervision of the Central Military Commission (CMC) of the Party. Sadanala Ramakrishna, a senior Maoist leader was the Secretary of the Committee who was arrested in February 2012 in Kolkata.

===Estimated strength===
The military wings of the founding organisations, the People&#x27;s Liberation Guerrilla Army (the military wing of the MCCI) and the People&#x27;s Guerrilla Army (the military wing of the PWG), also underwent a merger. The name of the unified military organisation is the People&#x27;s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA), and it is grouped into three sections — the Basic, the Secondary and the Main squad. All the PLGA members are volunteers and they do not receive any wages. During his stay in the guerrilla zones, Jan Myrdal noted that the female cadres of CPI (Maoist) constituted about 40% of its PLGA, and held numerous &quot;command positions&quot;; but currently, the female members comprises 60% of the Maoist cadres, and women commanders heads 20 of the 27 divisions of the guerrilla zones.

P.V. Ramana, of the Observer Research Foundation in Delhi, estimates the Naxilities&#x27; current strength at 9,000–10,000 armed fighters, with access to about 6,500 firearms. The analyses, as of September 2013, suggested that the estimated number of PLGA members has decreased from 10,000 − 12,000 to 8,000 − 9,000. But, Gautam Navlakha has suggested that the PLGA has strengthened over the past few years, and has mustered 12 companies and over 25 platoons and a supply platoon in 2013 as compared to 8 companies and 13 platoons of 2008. The People&#x27;s Militia which is armed with bows, arrows, and machetes is and is believed to logistically assist the PLGA is estimated to be around 38,000.

===Medical units===
The Maoists had structured &quot;medical units&quot; in the villages of Bastar, and the CPI (Maoist) operates &quot;mobile medical units.&quot; Rahul Pandita writes: 
Furthermore, the CPI (Maoist)&#x27;s medical services squads also move from village to village and provides &quot;basic medical training&quot; to selected young tribal people which enables them to identify frequently occurring diseases through their presages so that they can also distribute vaccines to the patients.

===Frontal organisations===
The frontal organisations of the party include the Radical Youth League, Rythu Coolie Sangham, Radical Students Union, Singareni Karmika Samakya, Viplava Karmika Samakhya, Porattam Kerala, Ayyankali pada Kerala, Njattuvela Kerala and All India Revolutionary Students Federation, Krantikari Adivasi Mahila Sangathan, and Chetna Natya Manch.

==Strategy==
===Governance tactics===
The &quot;organising principles&quot; of the Maoists are sketched out from the Chinese Communist Revolution and the Vietnam War. The CPI (Maoist) has organised Dandakaranya into ten divisions, each comprising three area committees; and every Area Committee is composed of several Janatana Sarkars (people&#x27;s governments). The party says that a Janatana Sarkar is established by the election procedure involving a group of villages, and has nine departments — agriculture, trade and industry, economic, justice, defence, health, public relations, education and culture, and jungle. The Janatana Sarkar provides education up to primary level in the subjects of mathematics, social science, politics, and Hindi, in the &quot;camp schools&quot; using the textbooks published by the party in Gondi. They also use DVDs to educate the children in the streams of science and history.

In their efforts to intimidate their political adversaries and consolidate control, the Maoists tax local villagers, extort businesses, abduct and kill &quot;class enemies&quot; such as government officials and police officers, and regulate the flow of aid and goods. To help fill their ranks, the Maoists force each family under their domain to supply one family member, and threaten those who resist with violence.

The organisation has been holding &quot;Public Courts&quot;, which have been described as kangaroo courts, against their opponents. These &quot;courts&quot; function in the areas under de facto Maoist control. The Maoists have also taken care to demolish government institutions under their &quot;de facto&quot; jurisdiction. They have also demolished railroad tracks and school buildings that are often used as temporary camps by security forces.

===Military strategies and tactics===
The CPI (Maoist) rejects &quot;engagement&quot; with what it terms as the &quot;prevailing bourgeois democracy&quot; and focuses on capturing political power through protracted armed struggle based on guerrilla warfare. This strategy entails building up bases in rural and remote areas and transforming them first into guerrilla zones, and then into &quot;liberated zones&quot;, in addition to encircling cities.

The military hardware used by Maoists, as indicated through a number of seizures, include RDX cable wires, gelignite sticks, detonators, country-made weapons, INSAS rifles, AK-47s, SLRs, and improvised explosive devices. The Maoists condemn the accusations that they manage arms through China, Myanmar and Bangladesh. On the subject, Ganapathy says, &quot;Our weapons are mainly country-made. All the modern weapons we have are mainly seized from the government armed forces when we attack them.&quot;

The CPI (Maoist)&#x27;s General Secretary says that they keep on appealing to the &quot;lower-level personnel&quot; in the paramilitary and police forces not to attack them, but rather &quot;join hands with the masses&quot; and &quot;consciously&quot; point their guns towards whom the Maoists view as &quot;real enemies.&quot; They further claims that &quot;only when the government forces come to attack us [Maoists] carrying guns do we attack them in self-defence.&quot; In Jharkhand, the police have also seized posters from various places which read, &quot;Policemen keep away from the green hunt and try to be friends of poor. Police jawan, do not obey orders of the senior officials, instead join the people&#x27;s army.&quot;

==Funding==
Some sources claim that the funding for the Maoists comes from abductions, extortion and by setting up unofficial administrations to collect taxes in rural areas where official government appears absent. Poppy cultivation is another suspected source of funding for Maoists in the Ghagra area of Gumla district in Jharkhand and in parts of Gumla, Kishanganj and Purnia districts in Bihar where security forces claim that opium fields are hidden among maize crops. Reports from Debagarh district in Odisha indicate that the Maoists also support hemp cultivation to help fund their activities.

==Legal status==
The party is regarded as a &quot;left-wing extremist entity&quot; and a terrorist outfit by the Indian government. Several of their members have been arrested under the now-defunct Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act. The group is officially banned by the state governments of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and Andhra Pradesh, among others. The party has protested these bans. The Indian government, led by the United Progressive Alliance, banned the CPI (Maoist) under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) as a terrorist organisation on 22 June 2009. On 22 June 2009, the central home ministry, keeping in mind the growing unlawful activities by the group, banned it under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Earlier, the union home minister, P. Chidambaram had asked the West Bengal Chief Minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, to ban the Maoists following the Lalgarh Violence. Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) and all its formations and front organisations have been banned by the Government of India.

==Controversies==
===Opposition===
The Party is regarded as a serious security threat by the Indian government. It says it will combine improved policing with socio-economic measures to defuse grievances that fuel the Maoist cause.
In 2005, Chhattisgarh State sponsored an anti-Maoist movement called the Salwa Judum. The group, which the BBC alleges is &quot;government backed&quot;, an allegation rejected by the Indian government has come under criticism for &quot;perpetrating atrocities and abuse against women&quot;, using child soldiers, burning people alive, and the looting of property and destruction of homes. These allegations were rejected by a fact-finding commission of the National Human Rights Commission of India, appointed by the Supreme Court of India, who determined that the Salwa Judum was a spontaneous reaction by tribes against Maoist atrocities perpetrated against them. The camps are guarded by police officers, paramilitary forces and child soldiers empowered with the official title &quot;special police officer&quot; (SPO).
However, on 5 July 2011, the Supreme Court of India declared the Salwa Judum as illegal and unconstitutional. The court directed the Chhattisgarh government to recover all the firearms given to the militia along with the ammunition and accessories. It also ordered the government to investigate all instances of alleged criminal activities of Salwa Judum. But, the state government did not abide by the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision. In August 2013, the Supreme Court of India asked the state government to explain that &quot;why its failure to execute the July 2011 order of disbanding the SPOs not considered as contempt of court.&quot;. In March 2019, a municipal school teacher, Yogendra Meshram was killed by the Maoists in Korchi, which was vehemently protested by locals. The Maoist leadership later apologized for the killing stating it to be a mistake and that Meshram was innocent wrongly suspected to be a police informer.

==International connections==
The CPI (Maoist) maintains dialogue with the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) who control most of Nepal in the Coordination Committee of Maoist Parties and Organisations of South Asia (CCOMPOSA), according to several intelligence sources and think tanks. These links are, however, denied by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist-Centre)

While under detention in June 2009, a suspected Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative indicated that the LeT and the CPI (Maoist) had attempted to co-ordinate activities in Jharkhand state. But, Ganapathy has denied any links between CPI (Maoist) and LeT, stating that the allegations are &quot;only mischievous, calculated propaganda by the police officials, bureaucrats and leaders of the reactionary political parties&quot; to malign the Maoists&#x27; image with the aim of labeling them as terrorists in order to justify &quot;their brutal terror campaign against Maoists and the people in the areas of armed agrarian struggle.&quot; Kishenji also criticised LeT for having &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;anti-people&quot; policies; though he said that the Maoists may consider backing up a few of their demands, if LeT will halt its &quot;terrorist acts&quot;.

Reports in 2010 indicate that the Communist Party of the Philippines, Southeast Asia&#x27;s longest-lived communist insurgent group, has been reported to have engaged in training activities for guerrilla warfare with Indian Maoists.

The Indian Maoists deny operational links with foreign groups, such as the Nepalese Maoists, but do claim comradeship. Some members of the Indian government accept this, while others argue that operational links do exist, with training coming from Sri-Lankan Maoists and small arms from China. China denies any suggestion that it supports foreign Maoist rebels, citing improvements in relations between India and China, including movement towards resolving their border disputes. Maoists in Nepal, India, and the Philippines are less reticent about their shared goals.

==Indian Government&#x27;s paramilitary offensive against the CPI (Maoist)==

In September 2009, an all-out offensive was launched by the Government of India&#x27;s paramilitary forces and the state&#x27;s police forces against the CPI (Maoist) is termed by the Indian media as the &quot;Operation Green Hunt&quot;.

On 3 January 2013, government issued a statement that it is deploying 10,000 more central paramilitary personnel in Bastar, Odisha and some parts of Jharkhand. On 8 June 2014, the Minister of Home Affairs officially approved the deployment of another 10,000 troops from the paramilitary forces to fight against the Maoists in Chhattisgarh. The count of personnel from State Armed Police Forces involved in counter-Maoism operations in the Red corridor is estimated to number around 200,000. Along with firearms, the armed forces&#x27; personnel use satellite phones, unmanned aerial vehicles and Air Force helicopters.

In 2011, the Indian Army while denying its direct role in the offensive operations accepted that it has been training the paramilitary personnel to fight against the Maoists, however, the Maoists have objected to the Army&#x27;s stationing in the Red corridor. On 30 May 2013, the Indian Air Force&#x27;s Air Chief Marshal declared that apart from the currently operating MI-17 helicopters, the Indian Force has decided to induce a unit of MI-17V5 helicopters to &quot;provide full support to anti-Naxal operations.&quot; In August 2014, the Ministry of Home Affairs had stated that 2,000 personnel from the Nagaland&#x27;s Indian Reserve Battalions (IRB) were deployed in counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations against the Maoists in Bastar.

Since the start of the operation: 2,266 Maoist militants have been killed, 10,181 have been arrested and 9,714 have surrendered.

==Notable attacks==

*On 12 June 2009, at least 29 members of the Indian Police were killed in an ambush attack by Maoist rebels in Rajnandgaon, 90 km (56 mi) from Raipur (India&#x27;s Chhattisgarh state).
*On 15 February 2010, several of the guerrilla commanders of CPI (Maoist), all of whom are believed to be female, killed 24 personnel of the Eastern Frontier Rifles at Silda in West Bengal. The attack was reportedly directed by Kishenji, and after the Maoist raid at the paramilitary camp, Kishenji addressed the news media saying, &quot;We have not started it (violence) and we will not stop it first. Let us see whether the central government is honest about a solution and we will definitely co–operate... This is the answer to Chidambaram&#x27;s &#x27;Operation Green Hunt&#x27; and unless the Centre stop this inhuman military operation, we are going to answer the Centre this way only.&quot;
*On 6 April 2010, the Maoists ambushed and killed 76 paramilitary personnel who fell into a trap laid by the lurking Maoists. The CPI (Maoist) described the incident as a &quot;direct consequence&quot; of the Operation Green Hunt stating that &quot;We have been surrounded by paramilitary battalions. They are setting fire to the forests and making adivasis (tribals) flee. In this situation, we have no other alternative (but to stage attacks).&quot;
*On 25 May 2013, the CPI (Maoist) ambushed a convoy of the Indian National Congress at Bastar, and killed 27 people including Mahendra Karma, Nand Kumar Patel and Vidya Charan Shukla. While regretting the death of a few &quot;innocent Congress [INC] functionaries&quot; during the incident, they hold the Bharatiya Janata Party and Indian National Congress&#x27; policies which they view as &quot;anti-people&quot; in nature, as directly responsible for the attack. Later, 14 Maoist who had allegedly participated in the ambush were gunned down in Odisha by the Special Operation Group with the assistance of Border Security Force.
*On 3 April 2021, twenty-two soldiers were killed in a Maoist ambush on the border of Bijapur and Sukma districts in southern Chhattisgarh. Those killed included 14 Chhattisgarh policemen and seven jawans of the CRPF, including six members of its elite CoBRA unit, specially trained to take on Maoist guerillas.
*On 4 January 2022, CPI (Maoist) attacked former BJP MLA of Manoharpur Gurucharan Nayak in West Singhbhum district of Jharkhand. Nayak escaped but the Maoists slit the throat of his two bodyguards, snatched their AK-47 rifles and fled. The two bodyguards died in the incident.
*On April 26 2023, 10 policemen and their driver belonging to the District Reserve Guard (DRG) of Chhattisgarh Police were killed in a IED attack by Maoists in Dantewada District, Chhattisgarh. The forces were attacked while returning from counterinsurgency operations in the area.

<text>The Swanage Railway is a railway branch line from near Wareham, Dorset to Swanage, Dorset, England, opened in 1885 and now operated as a heritage railway.

The independent company which built it was amalgamated with the larger London and South Western Railway in 1886. The passenger service was withdrawn in 1972, leaving a residual freight service over part of the line handling mineral traffic.

After the passenger closure, a heritage railway group revived part of the line; it too used the name &quot;Swanage Railway&quot; and now operates a line which follows the route of the former line from Wareham to Swanage with stops at Norden, Corfe Castle, Harman&#x27;s Cross and Herston Halt. It provides a regular park-and-ride service, normally steam-hauled, from Norden to the sea at Swanage including Corfe Castle village and ruins of Corfe Castle. In 2023, regular trains ran through from Wareham (with National Rail connections) to Swanage.

==Original railways==

===Early industry===
The Isle of Purbeck had extensive quarrying and ball clay activities before Victorian times; some of the clay was processed locally, but much of the mineral output was transported away for use elsewhere. Movement of heavy minerals was chiefly by coastal shipping, and in some cases simple tramways were built for movement within the quarries and to the various loading points situated within the natural Poole Harbour.

===By-passed by the main line===
The Southampton and Dorchester Railway opened its main line through Wareham in 1847; it was worked by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), and amalgamated with the LSWR in 1848. The new line gave the area a through railway connection to London, but it did not come close enough to influence the mineral traffic, which for the time being was mostly conveyed by coastal shipping, as before.

The building of the main line railway through Wareham encouraged several schemes to connect Swanage or the mineral workings in Purbeck, but they failed to gain the support they needed.

===Swanage Pier Tramway===
Stone was exported from Swanage by coastal shipping as before, having been quarried on, or mined in, the Isle of Purbeck. The actual loading of the vessels was primitive, and Captain Moorsom, chief engineer of the Southampton and Dorchester line, encouraged local promoters to found the &quot;Swanage Pier and Tramway Company&quot;, which obtained an authorising act of Parliament, the Swanage Pier Act 1859 (22 &amp; 23 Vict. c. lxxvii), on 8 August 1859. John Mowlem was prominent in generating local support. The scheme involved about of line, running on to the pier at Swanage, from which coastal vessels would be loaded directly.

In fact, only a short section was built, from the pier to an area on the sea front called &quot;The Bankers&quot; where stone blocks were prepared for transit. Horse traction only was used.

A second jetty, forming a fork, was added to the pier in 1896, to cater for the growing pleasure steamer passenger business, and the truncated tramway was re-gauged in about 1900 to the track gauge of 2 ft 6 in (750 mm). It was used for bunkering the pleasure steamers, but it fell into disuse at the end of the 1920s.

===Connecting to the main line===

A scheme for a branch line was successful: the &quot;Swanage Railway&quot; obtained an authorising act of Parliament, the (44 &amp; 45 Vict. c. clix), on 18 July 1881, with share capital of £90,000 and permitted debenture borrowings of £30,000. It was built under the supervision of consulting civil engineer W. R. Galbraith.

The line was opened on 20 May 1885 and was operated from the start by the LSWR. The branch diverged from the main line at Worgret Junction, over west of Wareham station; the branch was in length and single track. An extension from Swanage station to the pier tramway had been authorised by the Act, and would be built &quot;if required by the LSWR&quot;, but the larger company did not activate this requirement and the pier line was not proceeded with.

The branch intersected the pre-existing Furzebrook Railway, a narrow gauge industrial tramway concerned with conveying ball clay to a river wharf, and the Middlebere Plateway which conveyed the mineral to Poole Harbour; however the proprietors of those lines were slow to arrange interchange facilities with the Swanage Railway. There was one intermediate station, at Corfe Castle. Gradients were undulating, with a ruling gradient of 1 in 76 or 1 in 80, falling for from Worgret Junction and then rising to a summit at Furzebrook; falling again to Corfe Castle and rising to a summit about halfway to Swanage, and then falling.

The first train service consisted of five passenger trains each way and a daily goods train; the latter was amalgamated with the passenger service by the operation of mixed trains from 1 August 1885.

The Swanage Railway was amalgamated with the LSWR by an act of Parliament of 25 June 1886. This merely formalised the de facto position, as the LSWR had taken over Swanage Railway liabilities of £2,914 in 1881 and was effectively its paymaster from then.

The existing small Wareham station east of the level crossing was superseded by a larger station west of it, capable of acting as the junction interchange point. The new station was opened on 4 April 1887.

===The twentieth century===
In the first decade of the twentieth century, taking holidays at seaside resorts became a major pastime, and through trains from London were instituted in this period. The train service was gradually augmented; in the winter of 1931 there were thirteen daily passenger trains on the branch. The ball clay and other mineral workings on the Isle of Purbeck had not been connected to the branch at first, but by this time rail connections were made and the minerals were transported away by rail.

The railways of Great Britain were subject to the Railways Act 1922 by which most of them were &quot;grouped&quot;, and the LSWR became a constituent of the new Southern Railway. The Transport Act 1947 imposed further reorganisation, taking the railways into national ownership under British Railways in 1948.

In the period after 1945, the local trains on the branch were operated as push and pull trains. Through carriages from Weymouth trains were conveyed by some branch trains and if the branch engine was propelling the branch coaches, the attached main line coaches would be behind the locomotive, which was sandwiched.

In the 1960s, usage of rural branch lines declined rapidly as road transport for both goods and passengers improved. However, the line was not mentioned in the report &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot;, published in 1963, which recommended the closure of many such lines.

From 1966, steam traction was eliminated from the area, and the branch passenger service was operated by a diesel-electric multiple-unit set of BR Class 205. In 1969, a through train from London was operated on summer Saturdays, worked by a diesel locomotive.

In May 1967, the government announced passenger services to Swanage would end after a review of unprofitable branch lines. In late 1967, British Railways issued a notice that the Swanage line was to be closed by September 1968. However, due to opposition focused on the problems in providing a replacement bus service during the summer months, the closure was deferred. A Department of the Environment Inspector ruled that the line should remain open, but that decision was later overturned by the Secretary of State for the Environment.

The line closed to passenger services from 3 January 1972, this was standard phrasing which meant no trains ran on the &#x27;from&#x27; date. Because there was no winter Sunday service, the last trains actually ran on 1 January. Composed of two three-carriage 1957 British Railways diesel-electric multiple units No. 1110 and No. 1124, the last train left Wareham at 9.45pm bound for Swanage.

With 500 passengers on board, who had each purchased a specially printed British Rail Edmondson card ticket costing 50 pence for an adult and 25 pence for a child, the last train departed a gas-lit Swanage station platform at 10.15pm before passing through Corfe Castle at 10.24pm and pulling into Wareham at 10.40pm.

===Furzebrook===
At Furzebrook, the railway crossed the mineral tramway belonging to Pike Brothers, known as the Furzebrook Railway; the tramway was used for the transport of ball clay. No connection was made at first, and the Furzebrook line used the track gauge of 2 ft 8½ in (825 mm), but a transfer siding was later installed.

===Norden===
The Middlebere Plateway connected for transshipment purposes with the branch line at Norden; the plateway was operated by Benjamin Fayle and his successors. The location was used during World War II for separate War Department sidings in connection with rail mounted artillery guns.

===After passenger closure===
When the line closed to passengers, freight continued to operate from Furzebrook Sidings, where Pike Brothers dispatched clay.

In 1978, further sidings were installed at Furzebrook for the loading of crude oil from the Wytch Farm oilfield; the wells were distant, oil being brought to the site by pipeline. The sidings were adjacent to the clay trans-shipment site on the branch.

==Preservation==
In May 1972, the Swanage Railway Society was formed with the objective of restoring an all-the-year-round community railway service linking to the main line at Wareham, which would be &#x27;subsidised&#x27; by the operation of steam-hauled heritage trains during the holidays.

However, during the summer of 1972, BR hired contractors to lift the track between Swanage and Furzebrook sidings. Protests were orchestrated by the Society and an agreement between the Society and BR followed, leading to all the ballast being left in situ plus an extra of track at Furzebrook. The track from Furzebrook to the main-line junction at Worgret remained in use for ball clay traffic, later also serving the oilfield at Wytch Farm. BR had intended to sell the Swanage station site to a property developer, but, after the intervention of Evelyn King, the MP for South Dorset, at the Society&#x27;s request, it was offered to Swanage Town Council (STC).

At first, neither the Dorset County Council (DCC) nor the STC backed the Society&#x27;s plans to restore the railway. DCC planned to build a by-pass for Corfe Castle on the railway land, while STC started to demolish Swanage station. To break the impasse, the Railway Society formed two daughter organisations: the Swanage and Wareham Railway Group, composed of local residents prepared to lobby the local authorities, and the Southern Steam Group, to collect historic railway rolling stock and establish a museum of steam and railway technology. In 1975, after many interventions by local residents, the STC finally granted the Society limited facilities on the Swanage station site. In 1975, DCC acquired the railway land between the end of the line at Furzebrook and Northbrook Road bridge in Swanage, and undertook to &quot;give further consideration&quot; to routes for a Corfe Castle by-pass. The Society piloted a successful application by the Southern Steam Group to the Charity Commissioners for charitable status, and subsequently both the Society and the residents&#x27; group joined the new Southern Steam Trust.

===Restoration===
In 1979, a short line was re-opened the length of King George&#x27;s playing fields. This was extended, first to Herston Halt, and then to Harman&#x27;s Cross in 1988, neither of which had been stations previously. In 1995, the railway reopened from Swanage to Corfe Castle and onwards to Norden Park and Ride, another post-BR station. The reopening of the station at Corfe Castle was delayed until Norden was ready, as DCC had concerns about the effects of traffic on Corfe&#x27;s narrow main street (the A351 road between Wareham and Swanage). On 3 January 2002, the track was temporarily joined with the Furzebrook freight line at Motala and the Purbeck branch line was once again complete, thirty years to the day after it was closed.

===Motala and Worgret Junction===
On 8 September 2002, a brand new Virgin CrossCountry Class 220 &quot;Voyager&quot; diesel multiple unit, no. 220018, became the first mainline train to use the new temporary track, when it made a special journey to Swanage, where it was named &quot;Dorset Voyager&quot;. On 10 May 2007, the permanent connection with Network Rail network was used for the first time, allowing four ex-BR diesel locomotives running from Eastleigh Works to participate in the diesel gala and beer festival. They were later accompanied by a preserved four-carriage electric Class 423 unit provided by South West Trains.

The first public passenger service between Wareham and Swanage since 1972 was &quot;The Purbeck Pioneer&quot;, a 12-coach diesel-hauled railtour from on 1 April 2009, with a repeat service on 2 April 2009. The first public passenger-carrying steam service since 1967 was &quot;The Dorset Coast Express&quot; from London Victoria on Saturday 2 May 2009, which was hauled by a Southern Railway &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; class Bulleid Pacific locomotive number 34067 &quot;Tangmere&quot;. The first Swanage-to-Wareham steam service since 1967 was &quot;The Royal Wessex&quot; on Monday 4 May 2009, hauled by 34067 &quot;Tangmere&quot;.

===Operations===
Trains operate between Swanage and Norden Park &amp; Ride every weekend and Bank Holiday from January to the end of the year, and every day of the week from Easter to the end of October. Each year during December, the railway runs Santa Special services as a seasonal attraction. At summer peak times, trains operate up to every 40 minutes, which is one of the highest-frequency operations on a heritage railway in the UK.

As well as the main Society, other groups are based at the Railway. The Southern Catering Project Group has railway wagons stored on the railway.

The railway works at Herston, on the outskirts of Swanage, are not physically connected to the running line. Movements of locomotives for overhaul are carried out by road transporter as the Swanage Railway has been unable to reach agreement with local landowners to build a branch connection into Herston Works.

===Aims of the Society===
In addition to running the regular service between Swanage, Corfe Castle and Norden, these are:

*The restoration of the rail link between Swanage and Wareham and the re-establishment of a daily service to connect with main line trains. Recreating between Wareham and Swanage on selected dates, initially in 2017.
*The creation of a comprehensive historical record of steam railways and steam technology in Southern England.

===Norden – Wareham restoration===
There were no regular timetabled trains between Swanage and Wareham, as the rail service from Swanage operated only as far as Norden. The Society continued to work with Network Rail and the local authorities to identify suitable rolling stock and the infrastructure needed to enable regular services. In July 2010, DCC and Purbeck District councils voted to allocate up to £3 million over three years, to part-fund re-signalling work by Network Rail at Worgret Junction, which connects the Swanage branch to NR&#x27;s main line near Wareham. The upgrade enables scheduled train services to operate between Wareham, Corfe Castle and Swanage. Swanage Railway ran its first diesel-hauled passenger train into Wareham station on 13 June 2017, to mark the start of a two-year trial public service using diesel trains operating on 60 days during that summer. Trains with diesel locomotives at each end were used because of delays in the refurbishment of the diesel multiple units (DMUs) planned to operate the service; passenger loadings were good but the cost was uneconomic. In 2018, as the DMUs were still not ready, South Western Railway ran trains to Corfe Castle on summer Saturdays; these were noteworthy for their low price (£10 return from Salisbury and westwards, £5 from Weymouth and Wareham) and involving a record number of reversals for any scheduled service (4, at Yeovil Junction, Yeovil Pen Mill, Weymouth and Wareham). Due to industrial action, these ran on fewer Saturdays than intended. Periodically, railtours from other parts of the country operate over this section.

The Swanage Railway has won the annual Institution of Civil Engineers&#x27; (ICE) South West Engineering Award 2017 in ICE&#x27;s projects costing less than £1 million category. Part of the Swanage Railway&#x27;s &quot;Project Wareham&quot;, the £950,000 work took place over two years between Norden station and half-a-mile short of Worgret Junction: three miles of little-used former Network Rail line restored to a passenger-carrying standard, overgrown embankments and drains cleared, a quarter-mile-long embankment upgraded, and half-a-mile of new railway track laid. The £950,000 work also involved the installation of a level crossing across the Wytch Farm oil field access road near Norden station, and the creation of a nearby road-rail interchange for locomotives and carriages. The interchange construction involved the excavation of 2,500 cubic metres of earth that was recycled and used to extend a quarter-mile-long embankment near Furzebrook.

In 2021, the government announced that the line had been approved for additional funding as part of its &quot;Reverse Beeching&quot; proposals to restore lines closed by the Beeching Report (though the Swanage Railway was not included in the original report). Regular summer services were planned to start in 2022: however, they were then postponed to 2023. A four-day-a-week service has been announced to run between 4 April and 10 September 2023.

===Heritage Coach Project===
The railway has numerous heritage carriages and a project has been started to restore them. 4 out of the 11 are complete, with 1 currently being worked on:
*LSWR Ironclad Third Corridor No. 728 is awaiting restoration.
*SR Maunsell Open Third No. 1323 is awaiting restoration.
*SR Maunsell Open Third No. 1346 is operational, having entered traffic on 15 October 2022.
*SR Maunsell Open Third No. 1381 is operational, entering service on 16 July 2019.
*SR Maunsell Brake Third No. 2768 is awaiting restoration.
*SR Maunsell Brake Composite No. 6697 is awaiting restoration.
*SR Maunsell Brake Composite No. 6699 is awaiting restoration.
*BR Bulleid Brake Third No. 4365 is operational.
*BR Bulleid Brake Third No. 4366 is undergoing restoration.
*SR Bulleid Composite No. 5761 is operational.
*SR Bulleid Open Third (Restaurant) No. 1457 is currently in use as a workshop

===Water Tower Project===
Swanage Railway recovered a stone based LSWR water tower from Salisbury, and is currently relocating the tower to the South East side of Northbrook Road Bridge. It will also install a Spring Water Extraction System which will save money in the longer term because it is currently dependent on treated water from the mains which causes damage to the steam locomotive boilers.

<text>Elizabeth Parsons Ware Packard (28 December 1816 – 25 July 1897), also known as E.P.W. Packard, was an American advocate for the rights of women and people perceived to have insanity. She was wrongfully committed to an insane asylum by her husband, who claimed that she had been insane for more than three years. At her trial, however, a jury concluded that she was not insane after only seven minutes of deliberation. She later founded the Anti-Insane Asylum Society, campaigning for divorced women to retain custody of their children.

==Life==
Elizabeth Packard, born in Ware, Massachusetts, was the oldest of three children and the only daughter of Samuel and Lucy Ware. Samuel was a Congregational minister in the Connecticut Valley of the Ware Congregational Church from 1810 to 1826. She was educated at the Amherst Female Seminary, where she studied French, algebra, and the new classics, thanks to the &quot;adequate wealth&quot; of her parents. In 1835, at age 19, she was diagnosed with brain fever, a nineteenth-century term for an illness thought to be caused by a severe emotional upset. When the family physician failed to help her, Samuel Ware decided to admit her to Worcester State Hospital, with Dr. Samuel Woodard at the helm; he was highly regarded for patient care. On the admission papers, Samuel Ware wrote that she suffered from &quot;mental labor&quot; from her occupation as a teacher. She remained in the hospital for six weeks.

At the insistence of her parents, Ware married Calvinist minister Theophilus Packard, fourteen years her senior and said to be &quot;cold and domineering&quot;, on 21 May 1839. The couple had six children: Theophilus (b. 1842), Ira Ware (b. 1844), Samuel Ware (b. 1847), Elizabeth Ware (b. 1850), George Hastings (b. 1853), and Arthur Dwight (b. 1858). They lived in Western Massachusetts until September 1854. Beginning in 1857, after having lived in Ohio and Iowa for short periods, the family moved to Manteno, Illinois, and appeared to have a peaceful and uneventful marriage.

Theophilus, however, held quite decisive religious beliefs. After many years of marriage, Elizabeth Packard outwardly questioned her husband&#x27;s beliefs and began expressing opinions that were contrary to his. While the main subject of their dispute was religion, the couple also disagreed on methods of child rearing and managing family finances, as well as the morality of slavery, with Elizabeth defending abolitionist John Brown, which embarrassed Theophilus.

When Illinois opened its first hospital for the mentally ill in 1851, the state legislature passed a law that within two years of its passage was amended to require a public hearing before a person could be committed against their will, with the exception that a husband could have his wife committed without either a public hearing or her consent. In 1860, Theophilus Packard judged that his wife was &quot;slightly insane&quot;, a condition he attributed to &quot;excessive application of body and mind&quot;. He arranged for a doctor, J.W. Brown, to speak with her. The doctor pretended to be a sewing machine salesman. During their conversation, Elizabeth complained of her husband&#x27;s domination and his accusations to others that she was insane. Brown reported this conversation to Theophilus (along with the observation that Mrs. Packard &quot;exhibited a great dislike to me&quot;). Theophilus decided to have Elizabeth committed. She learned of this decision on June 18, 1860, when the county sheriff arrived at the Packard home to take her into custody.

Elizabeth Packard spent the next three years at the Jacksonville Insane Asylum in Jacksonville, Illinois (now the Jacksonville Developmental Center). She was regularly questioned by doctors, but refused to agree that she was insane or to change her religious views. In June 1863, due, in part, to pressure from her children, who wished her to be released, the doctors declared that she was incurable and discharged her. Upon her discharge, Theophilus locked her in the nursery of their home and nailed the windows shut. Elizabeth managed to drop a letter complaining of this treatment out of the window, which was delivered to her friend Sarah Haslett. Sarah Haslett in turn delivered the letter to Judge Charles Starr, who issued a writ of habeas corpus ordering Theophilus to bring Elizabeth to his chambers to discuss the matter. After being presented with Theophilus&#x27; evidence, Judge Starr scheduled a jury trial to allow a legal determination of Elizabeth&#x27;s sanity to take place.

==&quot;Packard v. Packard&quot;==
At the subsequent trial of &quot;Packard v. Packard&quot;, which lasted five days, Theophilus&#x27;s lawyers produced witnesses from his family who testified that Elizabeth had argued with her husband and tried to withdraw from his congregation. These witnesses concurred with Theophilus that this was a sign of insanity. The record from the Illinois State Hospital stating that Mrs. Packard&#x27;s condition was incurable was also entered into the court record.

Elizabeth&#x27;s lawyers, Stephen Moore and John W. Orr, responded by calling witnesses from the neighborhood who knew the Packards but were not members of Theophilus&#x27; church. These witnesses testified they never saw Elizabeth exhibit any signs of insanity, while discussing religion or otherwise. The final witness was Dr. Duncanson, who was both a physician and a theologian. Dr. Duncanson had interviewed Elizabeth and he testified that while not necessarily in agreement with all her religious beliefs, she was sane in his view, arguing that &quot;I do not call people insane because they differ with me. I pronounce her a sane woman and wish we had a nation of such women.&quot;

The jury deliberated for only seven minutes before deciding the case in Elizabeth&#x27;s favor. She was legally declared sane, and Judge Charles Starr, who had changed the trial from one about habeas corpus to one about sanity, issued an order that she should not be confined. As scholar Kathryn Burns-Howard described it, &quot;[while] we will never know Elizabeth&#x27;s true mental state or the details of her family life (...) soon after being discharged, she convinced a jury of her sanity.&quot;

==Life after the trial==
When Elizabeth Packard returned to the home she shared with her husband in Manteno, Illinois, she found that the night before her release, her husband had rented their home to another family, sold her furniture, had taken her money, notes, wardrobe and children, and had left the state. She appealed to the Supreme Courts of both Illinois and Massachusetts, to where her husband had taken her children, but had no legal recourse, as married women in these states at the time had no legal rights to their property or children (see Coverture). As such, the Anti-Insane Asylum Society was formed.

Packard did not return to her former life, but became a national celebrity, publishing &quot;an armload of books and criss-crossing the United States on a decades-long reform campaign&quot;, not only advocating for married women&#x27;s rights and freedom of speech, but speaking out against &quot;the power of insane asylums&quot;. She became what some scholars call &quot;a publicist and lobbyist for better insanity laws&quot;. As scholar Kathryn Burns-Howard has argued, Packard reinvented herself in this role, earning enough to support her children and even her estranged husband, from whom she remained separated for the rest of her life. Ultimately, moderate supporters of women&#x27;s rights in the northern United States embraced her. Some argued that in the midst of the Civil War that a country in the midst of freeing slaves should do the same for others who suffered from abusive husbands. Some argue that she seemed oblivious to her racial prejudice in arguing that White women had a &quot;moral and spiritual nature&quot; and suffered more &quot;spiritual agony&quot; than formerly enslaved African-Americans. Even so, others say that her story provided &quot;a stirring example of oppressed womanhood&quot; that others did not.

Packard petitioned the Illinois and Massachusetts legislatures, and in 1869 legislation was passed in those states allowing married women equal rights to property and custody of their children. Upon the passing of this legislation, Packard&#x27;s husband voluntarily ceded custody of their children back to her, and her children came to live with her in Chicago.

Packard realized how narrow her legal victory had been, and that the underlying social principles which had led to her confinement still existed. She founded the Anti-Insane Asylum Society and published several books, including &quot;Marital Power Exemplified, or Three Years Imprisonment for Religious Belief&quot; (1864), &quot;Great Disclosure of Spiritual Wickedness in High Places&quot; (1865), &quot;The Mystic Key or the Asylum Secret Unlocked&quot; (1866), and &quot;The Prisoners&#x27; Hidden Life, Or Insane Asylums Unveiled&quot; (1868). In 1867, the State of Illinois passed a &quot;Bill for the Protection of Personal Liberty&quot; which guaranteed that all people accused of insanity, including wives, had the right to a public hearing, as did Massachusetts.

Packard also saw similar laws passed in three other states. Even so, she was strongly attacked by medical professionals and anonymous citizens, unlike others such as Dorothea Dix, with her former doctor from the Jacksonville Insane Asylum, Dr. Andrew McFarland, who privately called her &quot;a sort of Joan D&#x27;Arc in the matter of stirring up the personal prejudices&quot;. As such, Elizabeth&#x27;s work on this front was &quot;broadly unappreciated&quot; while she was alive. She only received broader recognition, starting in the 1930s, by a well-known historian of mental illness, Albert Deutsch, and again in the 1960s from those who were &quot;attacking the medical model of insanity&quot;.

She died on July 25, 1897. In her obituary, &quot;The Inter Ocean&quot; described her as &quot;the reformer of insane asylum methods&quot;.

==Scholarship and legacy==
Scholars have written various books and articles about Elizabeth Packard. This has included articles by scholars Myra Samuels Himelhoch and Arthur H. Shaffer in 1979, Paul A. Lombardo in 1992, and Jennifer Rebecca Levinson in 2003. In 1991, Barbara Sapinsley wrote the first book which focused on Elizabeth Packard, entitled &quot;The Private War of Mrs. Packard&quot;. It was informed by Packard&#x27;s family in the late 1960s/early 1970s, and took 20 years to find a publisher. Linda V. Carlisle wrote another biography, published by University of Illinois Press in 2010, entitled &quot;Elizabeth Packard: A Noble Fight&quot;. In part, she focuses on individual legislation that Packard campaigned for and/or helped bring about. In 2021, Kate Moore wrote a detailed and highly researched story highlighting the character of kindness, service, and perseverance of Elizabeth Packard entitled &quot;The Woman They Could Not Silence: One Woman, Her Incredible Fight for Freedom, and the Men Who Tried to Make Her Disappear&quot;. Previously, in 2005, Barbara Hambly had referred to Elizabeth Packard, in some detail, in her novel on the insanity of Mary Todd Lincoln, entitled &quot;The Emancipator&#x27;s Wife: A Novel of Mary Todd Lincoln&quot;, since the 1867 law Packard advocated for required a jury trial for anyone who was &quot;committed to an insane asylum.&quot; Moore would later say that Packard was not mentally ill and was &quot;merely independent,&quot; and argued that people should &quot;take inspiration from women like Elizabeth.&quot; Troy Rondinone, a professor at Southern Connecticut State University, made a similar argument, arguing that people should remember &quot;Packard’s battle for women in the mental health care system.&quot;

Emily Mann wrote the play &quot;Mrs. Packard&quot;, which premiered in May 2007. In Mann&#x27;s play, Packard describes her life fully in the insane asylum; it is considered historically accurate.

On August 10, 2023, Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker renamed the mental health hospital in Springfield Illinois from Andrew McFarland Mental Health Center to the Elizabeth Packard Mental Health Center, in Packard&#x27;s honor.

<text>The Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis), also called the red jackal, the Simien jackal or Simien fox, is a canine native to the Ethiopian Highlands. In southeastern Ethiopia, it is also known as the horse jackal. It is similar to the coyote in size and build, and is distinguished by its long and narrow skull, and its red and white fur. Unlike most large canids, which are widespread, generalist feeders, the Ethiopian wolf is a highly specialised feeder of Afroalpine rodents with very specific habitat requirements. It is one of the world&#x27;s rarest canids, and Africa&#x27;s most endangered carnivore.

The species&#x27;s current range is limited to seven isolated mountain ranges at altitudes of 3,000–4,500 m, with the overall adult population estimated at 360–440 individuals in 2011, more than half of them in the Bale Mountains.

The Ethiopian wolf is listed as endangered by the IUCN, on account of its small numbers and fragmented range. Threats include increasing pressure from expanding human populations, resulting in habitat degradation through overgrazing, and disease transference and interbreeding from free-ranging dogs. Its conservation is headed by Oxford University&#x27;s Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme, which seeks to protect the wolves through vaccination and community outreach programs.

==Naming==
Alternative English names for the Ethiopian wolf include the red jackal, the Simenian fox, the Simien jackal, Ethiopian jackal, and Abyssinian wolf.

===Indigenous names===

==Historical account ==
The species was first scientifically described in 1835 by Eduard Rüppell, who provided a skull for the British Museum. European writers traveling in Ethiopia during the mid-19th century (then called Abyssinia by Europeans and Ze Etiyopia by its citizens), wrote that the animal&#x27;s skin was never worn by natives, as it was popularly believed that the wearer would die should any wolf hairs enter an open wound, while Charles Darwin hypothesised that the species gave rise to greyhounds. Since then, it was scarcely heard of in Europe up until the early 20th century, when several skins were shipped to England by Major Percy Powell-Cotton during his travels in Abyssinia.

The Ethiopian wolf was recognised as requiring protection in 1938, and received it in 1974. The first in-depth studies on the species occurred in the 1980s with the onset of the American-sponsored Bale Mountains Research Project. Ethiopian wolf populations in the Bale Mountains National Park were negatively affected by the political unrest of the Ethiopian Civil War, though the critical state of the species was revealed during the early 1990s after a combination of shooting and a severe rabies epidemic decimated most packs studied in the Web Valley and Sanetti Plateau. In response, the IUCN reclassified the species from endangered to critically endangered in 1994. The IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group advocated a three-front strategy of education, wolf population monitoring, and rabies control in domestic dogs. The establishment of the Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme in Bale soon followed in 1995 by Oxford University, in conjunction with the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority (EWCA).

Soon after, a further wolf population was discovered in the Central Highlands. Elsewhere, information on Ethiopian wolves remained scarce; although first described in 1835 as living in the Simien Mountains, the paucity of information stemming from that area indicated that the species was likely declining there, while reports from the Gojjam plateau were a century out of date. Wolves were recorded in the Arsi Mountains since the early 20th century, and in the Bale Mountains in the late 1950s. The status of the Ethiopian wolf was reassessed in the late 1990s, following improvements in travel conditions into northern Ethiopia. The surveys taken revealed local extinctions in Mount Choqa, Gojjam, and in every northern Afroalpine region where agriculture is well developed and human pressure acute. This revelation stressed the importance of the Bale Mountains wolf populations for the species&#x27; long-term survival, as well as the need to protect other surviving populations. A decade after the rabies outbreak, the Bale populations had fully recovered to pre-epizootic levels, prompting the species&#x27; downlisting to endangered in 2004, though it still remains the world&#x27;s rarest canid, and Africa&#x27;s most endangered carnivore.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The earliest known fossil of the Ethiopian wolf is known from the Melka Wakena paleoanthropological site-complex in the Southeastern Ethiopian Highlands. It is the right half of a mandible and dated to between 1.6 and 1.4 million years ago. The authors of this study state that the ancestors of the Ethiopian wolf arrived in Africa from Eurasia at the same time as the ancestors of the African wild dog approximately 1.8 million years ago. The Ethiopian wolf has survived numerous climatic changes in its Ethiopian highland habitat, with its range repeatedly expanding and contracting with glacial cycles.

In 1994, a mitochondrial DNA analysis showed a closer relationship to the gray wolf and the coyote than to other African canids, and &quot;C. simensis&quot; may be an evolutionary relic of a gray wolf-like ancestor&#x27;s past invasion of northern Africa from Eurasia.

:&quot;See further: Canis evolution&quot;

Due to the high density of rodents in their new Afroalpine habitat, the ancestors of the Ethiopian wolf gradually developed into specialised rodent hunters. This specialisation is reflected in the animal&#x27;s skull morphology, with its very elongated head, long jaw, and widely spaced teeth. During this period, the species likely attained its highest abundance, and had a relatively continuous distribution. This changed about 15,000 years ago with the onset of the current interglacial, which caused the species&#x27; Afroalpine habitat to fragment, thus isolating Ethiopian wolf populations from each other.

The Ethiopian wolf is one of five &quot;Canis&quot; species present in Africa, and is readily distinguishable from jackals by its larger size, relatively longer legs, distinct reddish coat, and white markings. John Edward Gray and Glover Morrill Allen originally classified the species under a separate genus, &quot;Simenia&quot;, and Oscar Neumann considered it to be &quot;only an exaggerated fox&quot;. Juliet Clutton-Brock refuted the separate genus in favour of placing the species in the genus &quot;Canis&quot;, upon noting cranial similarities with the side-striped jackal.

In 2015, a study of mitochondrial genome sequences and whole genome nuclear sequences of African and Eurasian canids indicated that extant wolf-like canids have colonised Africa from Eurasia at least five times throughout the Pliocene and Pleistocene, which is consistent with fossil evidence suggesting that much of African canid fauna diversity resulted from the immigration of Eurasian ancestors, likely coincident with Plio-Pleistocene climatic oscillations between arid and humid conditions. According to a phylogeny derived from nuclear sequences, the Eurasian golden jackal (&quot;Canis aureus&quot;) diverged from the wolf/coyote lineage 1.9 million years ago, and with mitochondrial genome sequences indicating the Ethiopian wolf diverged from this lineage slightly prior to that. Further studies on RAD sequences found instances of Ethiopian wolves hybridizing with African golden wolves.

===Admixture with other &quot;Canis&quot; species===
In 2018, whole genome sequencing was used to compare members of the genus &quot;Canis&quot;. The study supports the African golden wolf being distinct from the golden jackal, and with the Ethiopian wolf being genetically basal to both. There are two genetically distinct African golden wolf populations that exist in northwestern and eastern Africa. This suggests that Ethiopian wolves – or an extinct close relative – once had a much larger range within Africa to admix with other canids. There is evidence of gene flow between the eastern population and the Ethiopian wolf, which has led to the eastern population being distinct from the northwestern population. The common ancestor of both African golden wolf populations was a genetically admixed canid of 72% grey wolf and 28% Ethiopian wolf ancestry.

===Subspecies===
, two subspecies are recognised by &quot;Mammal Species of the World Volume Three&quot; (MSW3).
==Description==

The Ethiopian wolf is similar in size and build to North America&#x27;s coyote; it is larger than the black-backed jackal and side-striped jackals as well as the African wolf and has comparatively longer legs. Its skull is very flat, with a long facial region accounting for 58% of the skull&#x27;s total length. The ears are broad, pointed, and directed forward. The teeth, particularly the premolars, are small and widely spaced. The canine teeth measure 14–22 mm in length, while the carnassials are relatively small. The Ethiopian wolf has eight mammae, of which only six are functional. The front paws have five toes, including a dewclaw, while the hind paws have four. As is typical in the genus &quot;Canis&quot;, males are larger than females, having 20% greater body mass. Adults measure in body length, and in height. Adult males weigh , while females weigh .

The Ethiopian wolf has short guard hairs and thick underfur, which provides protection at temperatures as low as −15 °C. Its overall colour is ochre to rusty red, with dense whitish to pale ginger underfur. The fur of the throat, chest and underparts is white, with a distinct white band occurring around the sides of the neck. There is a sharp boundary between the red coat and white marks. The ears are thickly furred on the edges, though naked on the inside. The naked borders of the lips, the gums and palate are black. The lips, a small spot on the cheeks and an ascending crescent below the eyes are white. The thickly furred tail is white underneath, and has a black tip, though, unlike most other canids, there is no dark patch marking the supracaudal gland. It moults during the wet season (August–October), and there is no evident seasonal variation in coat colour, though the contrast between the red coat and white markings increases with age and social rank. Females tend to have paler coats than males. During the breeding season, the female&#x27;s coat turns yellow, becomes woolier, and the tail turns brownish, losing much of its hair.

Animals resulting from Ethiopian wolf-dog hybridisation tend to be more heavily built than pure wolves, and have shorter muzzles and different coat patterns.

==Behaviour==
===Social and territorial behaviours===
The Ethiopian wolf is a social animal, living in family groups containing up to 20 adults (individuals older than one year), though packs of six wolves are more common. Packs are formed by dispersing males and a few females, which with the exception of the breeding female, are reproductively suppressed. Each pack has a well-established hierarchy, with dominance and subordination displays being common. Upon dying, a breeding female can be replaced by a resident daughter, though this increases the risk of inbreeding. Such a risk is sometimes circumvented by multiple paternity and extra-pack matings. The dispersal of wolves from their packs is largely restricted by the scarcity of unoccupied habitat.

These packs live in communal territories, which encompass of land on average. In areas with little food, the species lives in pairs, sometimes accompanied by pups, and defends larger territories averaging . In the absence of disease, Ethiopian wolf territories are largely stable, but packs can expand whenever the opportunity arises, such as when another pack disappears. The size of each territory correlates with the abundance of rodents, the number of wolves in a pack, and the survival of pups. Ethiopian wolves rest together in the open at night, and congregate for greetings and border patrols at dawn, noon, and evening. They may shelter from rain under overhanging rocks and behind boulders. The species never sleeps in dens, and only uses them for nursing pups. When patrolling their territories, Ethiopian wolves regularly scent-mark, and interact aggressively and vocally with other packs. Such confrontations typically end with the retreat of the smaller group.

===Reproduction and development===
The mating season usually takes place between August and November. Courtship involves the breeding male following the female closely. The breeding female only accepts the advances of the breeding male, or males from other packs. The gestation period is 60–62 days, with pups being born between October and December. Pups are born toothless and with their eyes closed, and are covered in a charcoal-grey coat with a buff patch on the chest and abdomen. Litters consist of two to six pups, which emerge from their den after three weeks, when the dark coat is gradually replaced with the adult colouration. By the age of five weeks, the pups feed on a combination of milk and solid food, and become completely weaned off milk at the age of 10 weeks to six months. All members of the pack contribute to protecting and feeding the pups, with subordinate females sometimes assisting the dominant female by suckling them. Full growth and sexual maturity are attained at the age of two years. Cooperative breeding and pseudopregnancy have been observed in Ethiopian wolves.

Most females disperse from their natal pack at about two years of age, and some become &quot;floaters&quot; that may successfully immigrate into existing packs. Breeding pairs are most often unrelated to each other, suggesting that female-biased dispersal reduces inbreeding. Inbreeding is ordinarily avoided because it leads to a reduction in progeny fitness (inbreeding depression) due largely to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive alleles.

===Hunting behaviours===

Unlike most social carnivores, the Ethiopian wolf tends to forage and feed on small prey alone. It is most active during the day, the time when rodents are themselves most active, though they have been observed to hunt in groups when targeting mountain nyala calves. Major Percy-Cotton described the hunting behaviour of Ethiopian wolves as thus:

The technique described above is commonly used in hunting big-headed African mole-rats, with the level of effort varying from scratching lightly at the hole to totally destroying a set of burrows, leaving metre-high earth mounds.

Wolves in Bale have been observed to forage among cattle herds, a tactic thought to aid in ambushing rodents out of their holes by using the cattle to hide their presence. Ethiopian wolves have also been observed forming temporary associations with troops of grazing geladas. Solitary wolves hunt for rodents in the midst of the monkeys, ignoring juvenile monkeys, though these are similar in size to some of their prey. The monkeys, in turn, tolerate and largely ignore the wolves, although they take flight if they observe feral dogs, which sometimes prey on them. Within the troops, the wolves enjoy much higher success in capturing rodents than usual, perhaps because the monkeys&#x27; activities flush out the rodents, or because the presence of numerous larger animals makes it harder for rodents to spot a threat.

==Ecology==

===Habitat===

The Ethiopian wolf is restricted to isolated pockets of Afroalpine grasslands and heathlands inhabited by Afroalpine rodents. Its ideal habitat extends from above the tree line around 3,200 to 4,500 m, with some wolves inhabiting the Bale Mountains being present in montane grasslands at 3,000 m. Although specimens were collected in Gojjam and northwestern Shoa at 2,500 m in the early 20th century, no recent records exist of the species occurring below 3,000 m. In modern times, subsistence agriculture, which extends up to 3,700 m, has largely restricted the species to the highest peaks.

The Ethiopian wolf uses all Afroalpine habitats, but has a preference for open areas containing short herbaceous and grassland communities inhabited by rodents, which are most abundant along flat or gently sloping areas with poor drainage and deep soils. Prime wolf habitat in the Bale Mountains consists of short &quot;Alchemilla&quot; herbs and grasses, with low vegetation cover. Other favourable habitats consist of tussock grasslands, high-altitude scrubs rich in &quot;Helichrysum&quot;, and short grasslands growing in shallow soils. In its northern range, the wolf&#x27;s habitat is composed of plant communities characterised by a matrix of &quot;Festuca&quot; tussocks, &quot;Euryops&quot; bushes, and giant lobelias, all of which are favoured by the wolf&#x27;s rodent prey. Although marginal in importance, the ericaceous moorlands at 3,200–3,600 m in Simien may provide a refuge for wolves in highly disturbed areas.

===Diet===

In the Bale Mountains, the Ethiopian wolf&#x27;s primary prey are big-headed African mole-rats, though it also feeds on grass rats, black-clawed brush-furred rats, and highland hares. Other secondary prey species include vlei rats, yellow-spotted brush-furred rats, and occasionally goslings and eggs. Ethiopian wolves have twice been observed to feed on rock hyraxes, and mountain nyala calves. It will also prey on reedbuck calves. In areas where the big-headed African mole-rat is absent, the smaller Northeast African mole-rat is targeted. In the Simien Mountains, the Ethiopian wolf preys on Abyssinian grass rats. Undigested sedge leaves have occasionally been found in Ethiopian wolf stomachs. The sedge possibly is ingested for roughage or for parasite control. It has also been observed to consume nectar from the flowers of &quot;Kniphofia foliosa&quot;. The species may scavenge on carcasses, but is usually displaced by free-ranging dogs and African golden wolves. It typically poses no threat to livestock, with farmers often leaving herds in wolf-inhabited areas unattended.

==Range and populations==
Six current Ethiopian wolf populations are known. North of the Rift Valley, the species occurs in the Simien Mountains in Gondar, in the northern and southern Wollo highlands, and in Guassa Menz in north Shoa. It has recently become extinct in Gosh Meda in north Shoa and Mount Guna, and has not been reported in Mount Choqa for several decades. Southeast of the Rift Valley, it occurs in the Arsi and Bale Mountains.

==Threats==
The Ethiopian wolf has been considered rare since it was first recorded scientifically. The species likely has always been confined to Afroalpine habitats, so it was never widespread. In historical times, all of the Ethiopian wolf&#x27;s threats are both directly and indirectly human-induced, as the wolf&#x27;s highland habitat, with its high annual rainfall and rich fertile soils, is ideal for agricultural activities. Its proximate threats include habitat loss and fragmentation (subsistence agriculture, overgrazing, road construction, and livestock farming), diseases (primarily rabies and canine distemper), conflict with humans (poisoning, persecution, and road kills), and hybridisation with dogs.

===Disease===
Rabies outbreaks, stemming from infected dogs, have killed many Ethiopian wolves over the 1990s and 2000s. Two well-documented outbreaks in Bale, one in 1991 and another in 2008–2009, resulted in the die-off or disappearance of 75% of known animals. Both incidents prompted reactive vaccinations in 2003 and 2008–2009, respectively. Canine distemper is not necessarily fatal to wolves, though a recent increase in infection has occurred, with outbreaks of canine distemper having been detected in 2005–2006 in Bale and in 2010 across subpopulations.

===Habitat loss===
During the 1990s, wolf populations in Gosh Meda and Guguftu became extinct. In both cases, the extent of Afroalpine habitat above the limit of agriculture had been reduced to less than 20 km2. The EWCP team confirmed the extinction of a wolf population in Mt. Guna in 2011, whose numbers had been in single figures for several years. Habitat loss in the Ethiopian highlands is directly linked to agricultural expansion into Afroalpine areas. In the northern highlands, human density is among the highest in Africa, with 300 people per km2 in some localities, with almost all areas below 3,700 m having been converted into barley fields. Suitable areas of land below this limit are under some level of protection, such as Guassa-Menz and the Denkoro Reserve, or within the southern highlands, such as the Arsi and Bale Mountains. The most vulnerable wolf populations to habitat loss are those within relatively low-lying Afroalpine ranges, such as those in Aboi Gara and Delanta in North Wollo.

===Population fragmentation===
Some Ethiopian wolf populations, particularly those in North Wollo, show signs of high fragmentation, which is likely to increase with current rates of human expansion. The dangers posed by fragmentation include increased contact with humans, dogs, and livestock, and further risk of isolation and inbreeding in wolf populations. Although no evidence of inbreeding depression or reduced fitness exists, the extremely small wolf population sizes, particularly those north of the Rift Valley, raise concerns among conservationists. Elsewhere, the Bale populations are fairly continuous, while those in Simien can still interbreed through habitat corridors.

===Encroachment within protected areas===
In the Simien Mountains National Park, human and livestock populations are increasing by 2% annually, with further road construction allowing easy access to peasants into wolf home ranges; 3,171 people in 582 households were found to be living in the park and 1,477 outside the park in October 2005. Although the area of the park has since been expanded, further settlement stopped, and grazing restricted, effective enforcement may take years. , about 30,000 people live in 30 villages around and two within the park, including 4,650 cereal farmers, herders, woodcutters, and many others. In Bale there are numerous villages in and around the area, comprising over 8,500 households with more than 12,500 dogs. In 2007, the estimate of households within wolf habitat numbered 1,756. Because of the high number of dogs, the risk of infection in local wolf populations is high. Furthermore, intentional and unintentional brush fires are frequent in the ericaceous moorlands wolves inhabit.

===Overgrazing===

Although wolves in Bale have learned to use cattle to conceal their presence when hunting for rodents, the level of grazing in the area can adversely affect the vegetation available for the wolves&#x27; prey. Although no declines in wolf populations related to overgrazing have occurred, high grazing intensities are known to lead to soil erosion and vegetation deterioration in Afroalpine areas such as Delanta and Simien.

===Human persecution and disturbance===
Direct killings of wolves were more frequent during the Ethiopian Civil War, when firearms were more available. The extinction of wolves in Mt. Choqa was likely due to persecution. Although people living close to wolves in modern times believe that wolf populations are recovering, negative attitudes towards the species persist due to livestock predation. Wolves were largely unmolested by humans in Bale, as they were not considered threats to sheep and goats. However, they are perceived as threats to livestock elsewhere, with cases of retaliatory killings occurring in the Arsi Mountains. The Ethiopian wolf has not been recorded to be exploited for its fur, though in one case, wolf hides were used as saddle pads. It was once hunted by sportsmen, though this is now illegal. Vehicle collisions killed at least four wolves in the Sanetti Plateau since 1988, while two others were left with permanent limps. Similar accidents are a risk in areas where roads cut across wolf habitats, such as in Menz and Arsi.

===Hybridisation with dogs===
Management plans for hybridization with dogs involve sterilization of known hybrids. Incidences of Ethiopian wolf-dog hybridization have been recorded in Bale&#x27;s Web Valley. At least four hybrids were identified and sterilized in the area. Although hybridization has not been detected elsewhere, scientists are concerned that it could pose a threat to the wolf population&#x27;s genetic integrity, resulting in outbreeding depression or a reduction in fitness, though this does not appear to have taken place. Due to the female&#x27;s strong preference to avoid inbreeding, hybridization could be the result of not finding any males who are not close relatives outside of dogs.

===Competition with African golden wolves===
Encounters with African golden wolves (&quot;Canis lupaster&quot;) are usually agonistic, with Ethiopian wolves dominating African wolves if the latter enter their territories, and vice versa. Although African golden wolves are inefficient rodent hunters and thus not in direct competition with Ethiopian wolves, it is likely that heavy human persecution prevents the former from attaining numbers large enough to completely displace the latter.

==Conservation==
The Ethiopian wolf is not listed on the CITES appendices, though it is afforded full official protection under Ethiopia&#x27;s Wildlife Conservation Regulations of 1974, Schedule VI, with the killing of a wolf carrying a two-year jail sentence.

The species is present in several protected areas, including three areas in South Wollo (Bale Mountains National Park, Simien Mountains National Park, and Borena Sayint Regional Park), one in north Shoa (Guassa Community Conservation Area), and one in the Arsi Mountains National Park. Areas of suitable wolf habitat have recently increased to 87%, as a result of boundary extensions in Simien and the creation of the Arsi Mountains National Park.

Steps taken to ensure the survival of the Ethiopian wolf include dog vaccination campaigns in Bale, Menz, and Simien, sterilization programs for wolf-dog hybrids in Bale, rabies vaccination of wolves in parts of Bale, community and school education programs in Bale and Wollo, contributing to the running of national parks, and population monitoring and surveying. A 10-year national action plan was formed in February 2011.

The species&#x27; critical situation was first publicised by the Wildlife Conservation Society in 1983, with the Bale Mountains Research Project being established shortly after. This was followed by a detailed, four-year field study, which prompted the IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group to produce an action plan in 1997. The plan called for the education of people in wolf-inhabited areas, wolf population monitoring, and the stemming of rabies in dog populations. The Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme was formed in 1995 by Oxford University, with donors including the Born Free Foundation, Frankfurt Zoological Society, and the Wildlife Conservation Network.

The overall aim of the EWCP is to protect the wolf&#x27;s Afroalpine habitat in Bale, and establish additional conservation areas in Menz and Wollo. The EWCP carries out education campaigns for people outside the wolf&#x27;s range to improve dog husbandry and manage diseases within and around the park, as well as monitoring wolves in Bale, south and north Wollo. The program seeks to vaccinate up to 5,000 dogs a year to reduce rabies and distemper in wolf-inhabited areas.

In 2016, the Korean company Sooam Biotech was reported to be attempting to clone the Ethiopian wolf using dogs as surrogate mothers to help conserve the species.

<text>Stretford is a market town in Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, sited on flat ground between the River Mersey and the Manchester Ship Canal; the Bridgewater Canal bisects the town. The town is located south of Manchester, south of Salford and north-east of Altrincham. Stretford borders Chorlton-cum-Hardy to the east, Moss Side and Whalley Range to the south-east, Hulme to the north-east, Urmston to the west, Salford to the north and Sale to the south. In 2011 it had a population of 46,910.

Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, Stretford was an agricultural village in the 19th century; it was known locally as &quot;Porkhampton&quot;, due to the large number of pigs produced for the Manchester market. It was also an extensive market-gardening area, producing more than of vegetables each week for sale in Manchester by 1845. The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate, accelerated the industrialisation that had begun in the late 19th century. By 2001, less than one per cent of Stretford&#x27;s population was employed in agriculture.

Stretford has been the home of Manchester United Football Club since 1910 and of Lancashire County Cricket Club since 1864. Notable residents have included the industrialist, philanthropist and Manchester&#x27;s first multi-millionaire John Rylands, the suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, the painter L. S. Lowry, Smiths front-man Morrissey, Joy Division front-man Ian Curtis, pop singer Andy Gibb and Jay Kay of Jamiroquai.

==History==
The origin of the name Stretford is &quot;street&quot; (Old English &quot;strǣt&quot;) on a ford across the River Mersey. The principal road through Stretford, the A56 Chester Road, follows the line of the old Roman road from Deva Victrix (Chester) to Mamucium (Manchester), crossing the Mersey into Stretford at Crossford Bridge, built at the location of the ancient ford.

The earliest evidence of human occupation around Stretford comes from Neolithic stone axes found in the area, dating from about 2000 BC. Stretford was part of the land occupied by the Celtic Brigantes tribe before and during the Roman occupation, and lay on their border with the Cornovii on the southern side of the Mersey. By 1212, there were two manors in the area now called Stretford. The land in the south, close to the River Mersey, was held by Hamon de Mascy, while the land in the north, closer to the River Irwell, was held by Henry de Trafford. In about 1250, a later Hamon de Mascy gave the Stretford manor to his daughter, Margery. She in turn, in about 1260, granted Stretford to Richard de Trafford at a rent of one penny. The de Mascy family shortly afterwards released all rights to their lands in Stretford to Henry de Trafford, the Trafford family thus acquiring the whole of Stretford, since when the two manors descended together.

The de Trafford family leased out large parts of the land, much of it to tenants who farmed at subsistence levels. Although there is known to have been a papermill operating in 1765, the area remained largely rural until the early 20th-century development of Trafford Park in the Old Trafford district north of the town. Until then Stretford &quot;remained in the background of daily life in England&quot;, except for a brief cameo role during the Jacobite rising of 1745, when Crossford Bridge was destroyed to prevent a crossing by Bonnie Prince Charlie&#x27;s army during its abortive advance on London; the bridge was quickly rebuilt.

Until the 1820s one of Stretford&#x27;s main cottage industries was the hand-weaving of cotton. There were reported at one time to have been 302 handlooms operating in Stretford, providing employment for 780 workers, but by 1826 only four were still in use, as the mechanised cotton mills of nearby Manchester replaced handlooms. As Manchester continued to grow, it offered a good and easily accessible market for Stretford&#x27;s agricultural products, in particular rhubarb, once known locally as Stretford beef. By 1836 market gardening had become so extensive around Stretford that one writer described it as the &quot;garden of Lancashire&quot;; in 1845 more than 500 tons of vegetables were being produced for the Manchester market each week. Stretford also became well known for its pig market and the production of black puddings, leading to the village being given the nickname of Porkhampton. A local dish, known as Stretford goose, was made from pork stuffed with sage and onions. During the 1830s, between 800 and 1,000 pigs a week were being slaughtered for the Manchester market.

Situated on the border with Manchester, Stretford became a fashionable place to live in the mid-19th century. Large recreation areas were established, such as the Royal Botanical Gardens, opened in 1831. The gardens were sited in Old Trafford on the advice of scientist John Dalton, because the prevailing southwesterly wind kept the area clear of the city&#x27;s airborne pollution. In 1857, the gardens hosted the Art Treasures Exhibition, the largest art exhibition ever held in the United Kingdom. A purpose-built iron and glass building was constructed at a cost of £38,000 to house the 16,000 exhibits. The gardens were also chosen as a site for the Royal Jubilee Exhibition of 1887, celebrating Queen Victoria&#x27;s 50-year reign. The exhibition ran for more than six months and was attended by more than 4.75 million visitors. The gardens were converted into an entertainment resort in 1907, and hosted the first speedway meeting in Greater Manchester on 16 June 1928. There was also greyhound racing from 1930, and an athletics track. The complex was demolished in the late 1980s, and all that remains is the entrance gates, close to what is now the White City Retail Park. The gates were designated a Grade II listed structure in 1987. The gates are not in their original position but were dismantled and turned through ninety degrees when the White City Retail Park was built.

===Industrialisation===
The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town – the first planned industrial estate in the world – had a substantial effect on Stretford&#x27;s growth. The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.

During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United&#x27;s Old Trafford football ground, All Saints&#x27; Church, St Hilda&#x27;s Church, and the children&#x27;s library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.

Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&amp;Q store (originally constructed as a multi-lane Bowling Alley) in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period&#x27;s major artists in their prime. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Bob Marley, Elton John, Hawkwind, Yes, Chaka Khan, Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared. Tangerine Dream was the last band to perform at the Hardrock, on 19 October 1975. In more recent years, Lancashire Cricket Club&#x27;s Old Trafford ground, next door, has provided a concert venue for bands such as Oasis, Foo Fighters, The Cure, Radiohead, Coldplay, Arctic Monkeys and Pixies.

===Transport history===
Stretford&#x27;s growth was fuelled by the transport revolutions of the 18th and especially the 19th century: the Bridgewater Canal reached Stretford in 1761, and the railway in 1849. The completion of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJAR) in 1849, passing through Stretford, led to the population of the town nearly doubling in a decade, from 4,998 in 1851 to 8,757 by 1861.

Because Stretford is situated on the main A56 road between Chester and Manchester many travellers passed through the village, and as this traffic increased, more inns were built to provide travellers with stopping places. One of the earliest forms of public transport through Stretford was the stagecoach; the Angel Hotel, on the present day site of what used to be the Bass Drum public house, was one of the main stopping places for stagecoaches in Stretford, and the Trafford Arms was another. Horse-drawn omnibuses replaced the stagecoach service through Stretford in 1845. The Manchester Carriage Company&#x27;s tramway from Manchester to Stretford was built in 1879, terminating at the Old Cock Hotel on the A56 road, next to which a small depot was built to house the cars and horses. A 1900 timetable shows that trams left for Manchester every 10 minutes between 8:00 am and 10:15 pm. The horse-drawn trams were replaced with electric trams in 1902, and after the Second World War the trams were replaced by buses.

The MSJAR railway line through Stretford was electrified in 1931 and converted to light rail operation in 1992, when it became part of the Manchester Metrolink tram network. The first Metrolink tram through Stretford ran on 15 June 1992.

==Governance==

===Civic history===
Stretford was part of the ancient parish of Manchester, within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, a national scheme for dealing with the relief of the poor, Stretford joined the Chorlton Poor Law Union in 1837, one of three such unions in Manchester, before transferring to the Barton-upon-Irwell Poor Law Union in 1849. In 1867, Stretford Local Board of Health was established, assuming responsibility for the local government of the area in 1868. The board&#x27;s responsibilities included sanitation and the maintenance of the highways, and it had the authority to levy rates to pay for those services. The local board continued in that role until it was superseded by the creation of Stretford Urban District Council in 1894, as a result of the Local Government Act 1894.

Stretford Urban District became the Municipal Borough of Stretford in 1933, giving it borough status in the United Kingdom. Stretford Borough Council was granted its arms on 20 February 1933. The roses are the red roses of Lancashire, and the lion in the centre represents John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Above the lion are a crossed flail and scythe; the flail comes from the arms of the de Trafford family; the scythe is a reminder of the agricultural history of the area; the thunderbolts above represent the importance of electricity in Stretford&#x27;s industrial development. The boat at the bottom represents Stretford&#x27;s links to the sea via the Manchester Ship Canal.

In 1974, as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, the Municipal Borough of Stretford was abolished and Stretford has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, in Greater Manchester. Trafford Town Hall – previously Stretford Town Hall – is the administrative centre of Trafford.

===Political representation===
The constituency of Stretford was created in 1885, and existed until 1997, when it was replaced by the present constituency of Stretford and Urmston. Beverley Hughes was Labour MP during the New Labour government. Kate Green, a member of the Labour Party, became the MP at the 2010 General Election, with a majority of 8,935, representing 48.6% of the vote. She retained the seat at the 2017 General Election with an increased majority of 19,705, which represents 66.8% of the vote. The Conservatives took 27.0% of the vote, UKIP 2.2%, the Liberal Democrats 2.0%, the Green Party 1.3%, and the Christian Party 0.2%. Green resigned as MP in 2022 to replace Hughes as her role as Deputy Mayor of Greater Manchester, and the following by-election was won by Leader of Trafford Council Andrew Western, retaining the seat for Labour with an increased share of the vote.

Stretford is one of the four major urban areas in Trafford; the other three are Altrincham, Sale and Urmston. The area historically known as Stretford, between the River Irwell in the north and the River Mersey in the south, has since 2004 been divided between the Trafford local government wards of Clifford, Longford, Gorse Hill, and Stretford. Each ward is represented by three local councillors, giving Stretford 12 of the 63 seats on Trafford Council. The wards elect in thirds on a four yearly cycle. As of the 2014 local elections, all 12 councillors representing the Stretford area are members of the Labour Party.

==Geography==
Stretford occupies an area of , just north of the River Mersey, at (53.4466, −2.3086). The area is generally flat, sloping slightly southwards towards the river valley, and is approximately above sea level at its highest point. The most southerly part of Stretford lies within the flood plain of the River Mersey, and so has historically been prone to flooding. A great deal of flood mitigation work has been carried out in the Mersey Valley since the 1970s, with the stretch of the Mersey through Stretford canalised to speed up the passage of floodwater. Emergency floodbasins have also been constructed, Sale Water Park being a prominent local example, lying immediately to the south of Stretford.
Stretford comprises the local areas of Old Trafford, Firswood, Gorse Hill, and Trafford Park and represents the northeastern tip of Trafford. Its climate is generally temperate, with few extremes of temperature or weather. The mean temperature is slightly above average for the United Kingdom. Annual rainfall and average amount of sunshine are both slightly below the average for the UK.

Stretford&#x27;s built environment developed along the A56 road in two separate sections, corresponding to the original two manors. The area in the south, near to the border with Sale, grew around the church of St Matthew – an old alternative name for the town was Stretford St. Matthew. The northern part of Stretford was centred on Old Trafford, with undeveloped countryside separating them. During the 19th century, the sections merged.

The western terminus of the early medieval linear earthwork Nico Ditch is in Hough Moss, just to the east of Stretford; it was probably used as an administrative boundary and dates from the 8th or 9th century.

==Demography==
As at the 2011 UK census, the Stretford area wards of Clifford, Gorse Hill, Longford and Stretford had a total population of 46,910 and a population density of 8,907 persons per square mile (3,439 per km2).

Stretford residents had an average age of 36 years, younger than the 39.3 Trafford average. For every 100 females, there were 97.8 males. Of all residents, 42% were single (never married): in Trafford, 33% were single. Of the 19,209 households, 33% were one-person households, 56% were married couples with dependent children, and 15% were lone parents with dependent children. Of those aged 16–74 in Stretford, 23% had no academic qualifications, higher than the 18% in all of Trafford.

With 78% of residents born in the United Kingdom, there is a relatively high proportion of foreign-born residents reported. There is also a high proportion of non-white people, as 63% of residents were recorded as white. The largest minority group was Asian, at 21% of the population.

In 1931, 19% of Stretford&#x27;s population was middle class and 20% working class compared to 14% middle class and 36% working class nationally. The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers. By 1971, the middle class in Stretford had declined steadily to 15% whilst the working class had grown to 31% compared to 24% middle class and 26% working class nationally.

==Economy==

Until the end of the 19th century Stretford was a largely agricultural village. The development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town, beginning in the late 19th century, had a significant effect on Stretford&#x27;s subsequent development. At its peak in 1945 the park employed an estimated 75,000 workers; housing and other amenities had to be constructed on what had previously been agricultural land. Trafford Park is still a very significant source of employment, containing an estimated 1,400 companies and employing about 44,000 people.

The main shopping centre is Stretford Mall in the commercial centre of Stretford, previously known as Stretford Arndale. It was opened in 1969 and changed its name in 2003. It is still (as of 2022) referred to as the &quot;Stretford Arndale&quot; on local bus timetables and recorded announcements. Stretford Mall was built on the site of the original shopping centre in the former King Street. The Trafford Centre, a large shopping and leisure complex opened in September 1998, lies to the northwest of Stretford about away.
According to the 2011 UK census, the industry of employment of residents in Stretford was 17% retail and wholesale, 11% health and social work, 11% education, 7% manufacturing, 6% transport and storage, 6% public administration and defence, 6% professional, scientific and technical activities, 5% hotels and restaurants, 5% construction, 5% finance, 1% energy and water supply, 0.06% agriculture and 5% other. This is roughly in line with national figures, except for the town&#x27;s relatively low percentage of agricultural workers.

The 2011 census recorded the economic activity of residents aged 16–74 as 39.3% in full-time employment, 13.6% in part-time employment, 7.5% self-employed, 5.7% unemployed, 5.9% students, 9.5% retired, 5.6% looking after home or family, and 6.1% permanently sick or disabled. The 5.7% unemployment rate in Stretford was high compared with the national rate of 3.2%. According to the Office for National Statistics estimates, between April 2001 and March 2002 the average gross income of households in Stretford was £415 per week (£21,664 per year).
==Landmarks==

===Longford Cinema===

Longford Cinema, opposite Stretford Mall, on the eastern side of the A56 Chester Road, is perhaps the most visually striking building in the town. Designed by the architect Henry Elder, it was the height of Art Deco fashion when it was opened by the Mayor of Stretford in 1936. Its unusual &quot;cash register&quot; frontage was intended to symbolise the business aspect of show business.

The building incorporated many modern features, such as sound-proofing and under-seat heating, and it was also the first cinema in Britain to make use of concealed neon lighting. It had a seating capacity of 1,400 in the stalls and 600 in the circle, with a further 146 seats in the café area. When built, the cinema had a short pedestrian approach to the facade, which was removed when the A56 was widened. During the Second World War the building was used for concerts, including one given by a young Julie Andrews. It also played host to the Hallé Orchestra after the orchestra&#x27;s own home, the Free Trade Hall, was bombed and severely damaged during the Manchester Blitz of 1940.

After a change of ownership in 1950, the cinema was renamed the Stretford Essoldo. It continued to operate as a cinema until 1965, when it was converted into a bingo hall, which it remained until its closure in 1995. The building has been unused since then. It was designated a Grade II listed building in 1994.

In 2017 a proposal was put forward by Trafford Council to bring the Essoldo back into use as part of the new University Academy 92, to provide student amenities and other community facilities such as an enhanced library.

===Great Stone===

The Great Stone, which gave its name to the Great Stone Road, where it was located until being moved in 1925, is one of Stretford&#x27;s most easily overlooked landmarks. The stone is composed of millstone grit and was probably deposited as a glacial erratic. It is rectangular in shape, about wide, deep, and tall, with two deep rectangular slots cut into its upper surface.

Several suggestions have been made for the history of the Great Stone. There was a succession of plagues in Manchester from the 14th century onwards, and during the Great Plague of 1655–56 the holes in the top of the stone were filled with vinegar or holy water, through which coins were passed in the belief that would halt the spread of the disease. But the holes are probably too deep for that to have been the stone&#x27;s original purpose. It may have been a marker on the Roman road between Northwich and Manchester, or some kind of boundary marker. The Great Stone is also thought to have been the base of an Anglo-Saxon cross shaft. A local legend had it that the stone was slowly sinking into the earth, and that its ultimate disappearance would mark the end of the world.

When the Great Stone Road was widened in the late 19th century, the stone was moved back from the road slightly. In 1925, the stone was moved again, to its current location outside the North Lodge of Gorse Hill Park, about from its historical location. The stone is a Grade II listed structure.

===Cenotaph===

Stretford Cenotaph, opposite the Chester Road entrance to Gorse Hill Park, was built as a memorial to the 580 Stretford men who lost their lives in the First World War. Their names and regiments are listed on a large bronze plaque on the wall behind the cenotaph. It was formally unveiled in 1923, by the Earl of Derby, Secretary of State for War.

The cenotaph is high and wide at its base. It cost £2,000 to build, raised by public subscription and a donation from the Stretford Red Cross. The memorial bears the legend &quot;They died that we might live&quot; on one side, and &quot;In memory of the heroic dead&quot; on the other. It is a Grade II listed structure.

Stretford&#x27;s remembrance parade, which is made up of the Scouting, Girl Guiding and Boys Brigade divisions from the area as well as the cadets finishes here, in a semi-circle around the Cenotaph whilst the public and independent representatives stand on the main road which is closed for the occasion. The march goes from the Metro Club to the Cenotaph and back, with the Boys Brigade Band striking up the music for this event.

===Longford Park===
For more information, see Longford Park

===Stretford Public Hall===

Stretford Public Hall was built in 1878 by John Rylands. It was designed by N. Lofthouse and is on the western side of the A56 Chester Road, opposite the Longford Cinema. Stretford&#x27;s first public lending library was established in the building in 1883. On the death of Rylands in 1888, his widow placed the building at the disposal of the local authority for a nominal rent, and on her own death in 1908, the building was bought by Stretford Council for £5,000.

Public baths were built to the rear of the building, accessed via Cyprus Street. In 1940 the new Stretford Library was opened on King Street, and the public hall was rendered surplus. The building re-opened in March 1949 as the Stretford Civic Theatre, with a well-equipped stage for the use of local groups. After the Stretford Leisure Centre opened in 1983 now Stretford Sports Village, the Cyprus Street Baths wing fell into disuse, and was demolished. The remainder of the building began to fall into disrepair, despite being designated a Grade II listed structure in 1987, until Trafford Council refurbished and converted the hall to serve as council offices in the mid-1990s. It was re-opened in 1997, once again named Stretford Public Hall.

===Stretford Cemetery===
Stretford Cemetery was designed by John Shaw and opened in 1885. Its chapel is in the Decorated style, designed by architects Bellamy &amp; Hardy, and quite elaborate. On the western side is a memorial to the casualties of the Second World War and to the east a newer section of the cemetery.

===Trafford Town Hall===
Trafford Town Hall stands in a large site at the junction of Talbot Road and Warwick Road, directly opposite the Old Trafford Cricket Ground. Work on the building, designed by architects Bradshaw Gass &amp; Hope of Bolton, began on 21 August 1931.

The town hall officially came into use as Stretford Town Hall on the granting of Stretford&#x27;s charter, on 16 September 1933. In 1974, on the formation of the new Trafford Metropolitan Borough, Stretford Town Hall was adopted as the base for the new council and renamed Trafford Town Hall; it was designated a Grade II listed building in 2007.

===Union Church===
The Union Church was formed in 1862, with John Rylands as its patron; he laid the foundation stone of its building in Edge Lane, close to Longford Park&#x27;s southern entrance, in 1867. In the latter part of the 20th century the church was converted into office accommodation but by the early 21st century was standing empty. In 2012 it was restored to its original use a church having been bought by the Church of Christ – Iglesia ni Cristo.

==Transport==

Stretford Metrolink station is part of the Manchester Metrolink tram system and lies on the Altrincham to Bury line. Trams leave about every six minutes between 7:15 and 18:30, but every 12 minutes at other times of the day.

The nearest railway station is Trafford Park, on the Liverpool to Manchester line. Services are roughly every two hours in each direction, with extra services calling during the peak hours.

The Trafford Park Euroterminal rail freight terminal, opened in 1993, is in the Gorse Hill area of Stretford. It cost £11 million and has the capacity to deal with 100,000 containers a year. The containers are handled by two huge gantry cranes, the noise from which has led to complaints from some local residents.

The town has good access to the motorway network. Junction 7 of the M60 is just to the north of Stretford&#x27;s boundary with Sale and the A56 road gives easy access to the south, as well as to Manchester city centre in the other direction.

Cycle paths exist as part of the Trafford cycle initiative.

Manchester Airport, the busiest in the UK outside London, is about to the south of Stretford. Frequent bus and tram services can be taken to get there from Stretford, though taking the tram will require a change of services at Cornbrook.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Manchester on 95.1 FM, Heart North West on 105.4 FM, Smooth North West on 100.4 FM, Capital Manchester and Lancashire on 102.0 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Manchester &amp; The North West on 96.2 FM, and Wythenshawe FM, a community based station which broadcast on 97.2 FM and online.

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;The Stretford &amp; Urmston Messenger&quot;.

==Education==
Along with the rest of Trafford, Stretford maintains a selective education system assessed by the 11-plus examination.
The proportion of pupils leaving Stretford Grammar School with five or more GCSEs at grades A*–C in 2006, was 98.3%, compared to an average of 66.7% for all secondary schools in Trafford and a national UK average of 61.3%. The proportion of students from minority ethnic backgrounds, and for whom English is an additional language, is much higher than the average. Stretford Grammar was awarded specialist Science College status in September 2005. The school was assessed as &quot;good&quot; in its April 2015 Ofsted report.

Stretford High School Community Languages College, like Stretford Grammar, has a much higher proportion than the national average of pupils with a first language other than English, many of them being either asylum seekers or refugees. In 2004 Stretford High School was made subject to special measures, as it was considered not to be providing an adequate education for its pupils. Substantial improvement has taken place since then; the school was assessed as &quot;satisfactory&quot; in its November 2005 Ofsted report and was removed from special measures. Further improvements saw Stretford High School gain an &quot;outstanding&quot; assessment from Ofsted, following its February 2008 inspection. GCSE results also placed the school in the top 1% of schools in the country for adding value to its students.

Stretford also has the specialist Arts College, Lostock High School.

Plans to build a new university in the town, to be known as University Academy 92, were announced in September 2017. A branch of Lancaster University, it hopes to welcome the first of its anticipated 6500 students in September 2019. The campus is to be built on the Kelloggs headquarters site on Talbot Road, which has already been acquired by Trafford Council for £12 million.

==Religion==


The date of the first church to be built in Stretford is unrecorded, but in a lease dated 1413, land is described as lying next to a chapel. Many of the present day churches in the area were constructed during the late 19th and early 20th century, as the population of Stretford began to grow.

Methodism was a significant influence in 19th-century Stretford, but of the seventeen churches in the town today, only one is Methodist whereas five are Roman Catholic. The Catholic mission in Stretford was begun in 1859, in a small chapel on Herbert Street.

As at the 2011 UK census, 51% of Stretford residents reported themselves as being Christian, 18% as Muslim, and 3% as Sikh. No other religion was represented at higher than 1% of the population, with 20% reporting themselves as having no religion.

Stretford is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford, and the Anglican Diocese of Manchester.

There are two Grade II listed churches in Stretford: the Church of St Ann and the Church of St Matthew. St Ann&#x27;s is a Roman Catholic church, built in 1862–67 by E. W. Pugin for Sir Humphrey and Lady Annette de Trafford. It was officially opened by Bishop William Turner on 22 November 1863, and was consecrated in June 1867. Features include a historic organ built by Jardine &amp; Co (1867) and a good number of fine stained glass windows by Hardman &amp; Co of Birmingham. St Matthew&#x27;s church was built in 1842 by W. Hayley in the Gothic Revival style, with additional phases in 1869, 1906 and 1922.

==Sport==

Stretford has been the home of Manchester United Football Club since 1910, when the club moved to its present Old Trafford ground; the western end of the ground is still unofficially called the Stretford End.

Old Trafford was originally the home of Manchester Cricket Club, but became the home of Lancashire County Cricket Club in 1864 upon that club&#x27;s formation. The ground is on Talbot Road, Stretford, where it has been since 1856. Similar to its counterpart, one end of the Old Trafford cricket ground is called the Stretford End. It has been a Test venue since 1884 and has hosted three World Cup semi-finals. After the 2005 Ashes Test, when more than 20,000 fans had to be turned away, the decision was made to increase the ground&#x27;s capacity from 20,000 to 25,000. Initial plans included building a new stadium on the site of Trafford Town Hall, opposite the present ground. Trafford Council voted against the demolition of the town hall and instead, in 2007, signed an agreement jointly with Lancashire County Cricket Club, Ask Developments and Tesco, to redevelop the ground on its present site. The new cricket ground will be at the heart of a development that will also include business space, residential, retail, hotel and leisure facilities. More than £25 million is expected to be invested in the redevelopments at Old Trafford.

Stretford Stadium, adjoining Longford Park, is the home of Trafford Athletic Club. Trafford is one of the UK&#x27;s top athletic clubs, with more than 100 members having competed at international level.

The Stretford Sports Village, run by Trafford Community Leisure Trust, comprises two main centres: the original Stretford Leisure Centre, now called the &quot;Chester Centre&quot;, and the facility at Stretford High School called the &quot;Talbot Centre&quot;. The Stretford Sports Village is between Manchester United Football Club&#x27;s &quot;Old Trafford&quot; stadium and Lancashire County Cricket Club&#x27;s &quot;Old Trafford&quot; ground. The centres have a 25-metre main pool, a 20-metre children&#x27;s pool, four gyms, a table tennis room, twelve badminton courts, two five-a-side courts, a spinning studio, practice hall, training rooms, community room, a cafe, an outdoor full-size floodlight artificial turf pitch and a full-size grass pitch. Trafford Water Sports Centre lies just across Stretford&#x27;s southern border with Sale, about from Stretford town centre.

==Culture and cultural references==
Although Stretford town centre is busy during the day, there is very little in the way of a night-time economy. There are few restaurants and other entertainments except for a number of public houses and members-only social clubs. There are two public libraries: Greatstone Library, part of Stretford Sports Village, and Stretford Library, both run by Trafford Council.

The Stretford Pageant is an annual Rose Queen festival held on the last Saturday of June; the inaugural pageant was staged in 1919. There is a procession of decorated floats through the streets, collecting money for local charities and ending at Longford Park, where the Rose Queen is crowned. The tradition of the Rose Queen derives from an earlier event organised by St Peter&#x27;s Church from 1909 until the pageant began in 1919. Various other entertainments are provided in the park on the day of the pageant, such as a fun fair and a car boot sale. Stretford Pageant, along with similar events in other parts of Trafford, is under threat because of the council&#x27;s proposals to reduce funding and support for such events in the future.

&quot;The Stretford Wives&quot; is a television drama that was broadcast by the BBC in August 2002, watched by 5.7 million viewers. Written by Danny Brocklehurst, it is the story of three sisters living in Stretford, although most of the filming took place in nearby Salford. The programme received a mixed critical reception.

===Invention and discovery===
The Stretford process was developed at the North-Western Gas Board&#x27;s laboratories in Stretford during the 1940s. It was the first liquid phase oxidation process for removing hydrogen sulphide (H2S) from town gas to be commercially successful. Many Stretford plants were built worldwide.

==Public services==
Policing in Stretford is the responsibility of the Greater Manchester Police. The force&#x27;s &quot;M&quot; Division, responsible for policing in Trafford, is also based in Stretford, close to Trafford Town Hall.

Waste management is co-ordinated by the local authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority.

Healthcare is overseen by the NHS with hospitals nearby in Urmston and Wythenshawe. The nearest Ambulance Stations are located in Urmston and Sale.

Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) oversee the Fire and Rescue services in the area here. One of their 3 Fire Stations can be found in Stretford on Park Road, near the Trafford Centre and Kelloggs Factory.

==Notable people==

Perhaps fittingly for an area so close to Trafford Park, the world&#x27;s first planned industrial estate, one of the world&#x27;s first industrial espionage agents, John Holker, was born in Stretford, in 1719.

Two of Stretford&#x27;s famous residents were the suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst and the painter L. S. Lowry, who was born in Stretford in 1887. Manchester&#x27;s first multi-millionaire John Rylands and his wife Enriqueta Augustina Rylands lived at Longford Hall in Stretford during the later parts of their lives. The radical firebrand socialist, and later post-war politician Herschel Lewis Austin (1911–1974) served Stretford as a Labour Member of Parliament between 1945 and 1950.

Sir Walter Baldwin Spencer KCMG (1860–1929) a British-Australian biologist and anthropologist was born in Stretford, as were ABC&#x27;s lead singer Martin Fry, rock climber Derek Hersey and television actor John Comer, best known for his role as café owner Sid in the BBC sitcom &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;.

A number of Manchester United players, including some of those who died in the Munich air disaster of February 1958, lived in lodgings at 19 Gorse Avenue. A blue plaque was unveiled at the house by former lodger and Munich survivor Sir Bobby Charlton in recognition of the house&#x27;s association with Manchester United. The owner of the house during the 1950s was Margaret Watson, but by the time of the plaque&#x27;s unveiling more than 50 years later it was occupied by a different family.

The singer, songwriter and Jamiroquai lead vocalist Jason Kay (Jay Kay, Jason Luís Cheetham) was born in the town.

<text>The Keepers of the House is a 1964 novel by Shirley Ann Grau set in rural Alabama. It covers seven generations of the Howland family that lived in the same house and developed a community around themselves. Through these characters, the novel examines the long-established white families of the Deep South of the United States, their responses to changing social values and norms, and the hypocrisy of racism. In 1965, &quot;The Keepers of the House&quot; was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.

==Plot summary==

The first William Howland served in New Orleans and the South during the War of 1812. While returning home to Tennessee, he decided to settle in Mississippi Territory (now Alabama and Mississippi), overlooking a small river. He was later killed in a raid by Indians, likely Creek. Since then, a descendant of William Howland, most often a male named William, has lived in the house with his family and dominated affairs in Madison City and Wade County, which developed around Howland&#x27;s original settlement.

The fifth William Howland was the last man bearing the name to live in the house. His wife died young, leaving him with a young daughter, Abigail, and an infant son, William, who died a year after his mother. Abigail married an English professor who abandoned her with a child, also named Abigail, when he went off to fight in World War II. When she died, William Howland was left to take care of his granddaughter Abigail. He also brought Margaret, a new African-American housekeeper, to the house to live with him. Throughout the county, she was known as his mistress and the mother of his other children. What no one knew, however, was that William had secretly married Margaret to ensure that the children were legitimate. Once their children came of age, William Howland and Margaret sent them north so that they could pursue lives as Whites.

The secret of the marriage came out only after the younger Abigail was married to John Tolliver, an up-and-coming politician, who was running for governor. In the turbulent racist atmosphere of the South, Tolliver aligned himself with the Klan and made racist statements against Blacks. This infuriated Robert Howland, the eldest son of William and Margaret, who was living in obscurity in Seattle. He released the story of his origins to the press, crippling Tolliver&#x27;s campaign. Tolliver, who regarded Abigail as a trophy wife, declared that their marriage was over and headed north to his family.

Both William Howland and Margaret had died, but a mob gathered to vent its anger about the mixed marriage on Abigail and the Howland house. They kill the livestock and set fire to the barn, but Abigail succeeds in driving them away from the house with her grandfather&#x27;s shotguns. 

At the end of the book, Abigail takes her revenge on the people of Madison City. Over the past generations, her family had come to own most of the county, making her one of the richest people in the state. Over the course of a single day, she takes revenge on the locals for betraying her grandfather by shutting down the hotel and bringing most of the local economy to ruin. Once she has done that, she places a call to Robert, with the intention of informing his new family that his mother was Black.

==Major themes==
Race is explored as a major theme throughout the novel. Grau illustrates what she regards as hypocrisy among Southerners, whose purported beliefs about race sometimes conflict with their actions and/or statements. This dissonance is reflected in the character, John Tolliver, who is challenged about whether he believes the racist rhetoric he spouts.

==Reception==
Grau&#x27;s bitter condemnation of racist rhetoric, made at the height of campaigns of the Civil Rights Movement in Alabama, evoked a sharp public reaction against the author. When the book was first published, Grau was publicly attacked by the Ku Klux Klan, and a cross was burned on her lawn in Metairie, Louisiana, where she had long lived near New Orleans.

<text>William Jasper ( – October 9, 1779) was an American soldier in the Revolutionary War. He was a sergeant in the 2nd South Carolina Regiment.

Jasper distinguished himself in the defense of Fort Moultrie (then called Fort Sullivan) on June 28, 1776. When a shell from a British warship shot away the flagstaff, he recovered the South Carolina flag in the Battle of Sullivan&#x27;s Island, raised it on a temporary staff, and held it under fire until a new staff was installed. Governor John Rutledge gave his sword to Jasper in recognition of his bravery.

In 1779, Sergeant Jasper participated in the Siege of Savannah, led by General Lincoln, which failed to recapture Savannah, Georgia, from the British. He was mortally wounded during an assault on the British forces there.

Sgt. Jasper&#x27;s story is similar to that of Sgt. John Newton. Five states (Indiana, Missouri, Texas, Mississippi, and Georgia) have adjacent counties named Jasper and Newton, as these were remembered as a pair, due to the popularity of Parson Weems&#x27; memorializing early American history. Several other states have a Jasper County with a county seat of Newton, or vice versa.

==Early life==
The ancestry of William Jasper is disputed. Traditionally, Jasper has been identified of being of Irish descent born in the colonies. There is also another account which says he was a son of a Welsh immigrant. However, according to one account, William Jasper (named Johann Wilhelm Gasper at the time) came to America in 1767 on the ship &quot;Minerva&quot;. He and other immigrants hailed from Germany and landed in Philadelphia. He was 16 at the time, but he had decided that whatever the new land held, he would accept it with open arms.

He arrived in Philadelphia in the fall and was fed some warm soup and then put in a line to take an oath of allegiance and sign his name. When it was his turn, though, Jasper did not know how to read or write, so he could not even write his name on the list. He had to just put an X down where he should have put his name and next to it the colonist who had signed him in wrote John William Jasper. He then completed a few years of indentured servitude and moved south to find some land of his own.

William Jasper was motivated when he settled down in the South; he had left his girlfriend in Pennsylvania. To pay for her journey to come live with him, he joined the military; by this time, the colonists had already rebelled. Although the pay was not great, he soon became a sergeant, earning enough for Elizabeth to join him in Georgia, where they were soon married.

According to other accounts, William Jasper was the son of John Jasper, a Virginia blacksmith who had migrated to Union County, South Carolina during the early 1770s.

==Fort Sullivan==

Jasper was soon called to Sullivan&#x27;s Island to help protect Charles Towne (Charleston) Harbor. There, he served under Colonel William Moultrie, who was in charge of the defense of Charleston against the Royal Navy. A few days before the British were due to arrive, Colonel Moultrie decided to build a fort to protect the harbor. His officers were sent to local plantations to borrow their slaves to help with the creation of the fort. Soldiers, slaves, and volunteers banded together to chop down palmettos and use them in its construction.

Initially called Fort Sullivan, some time after the battle the fort was renamed to Fort Moultrie. The British arrived before the fort was finished, its whole back remaining incomplete. The Moultrie flag was raised over the structure, and a 10-hour siege began.

Low on ammunition, the 2nd South Carolina Regiment only fired when ships closed in on the fort. The flag, designed by Moultrie himself at the behest of the colonial government, was shot down, and fell to the bottom of the ditch on the outside of the fort. Leaping from an embrasure, Jasper recovered the flag, which he tied to a sponge staff (see the Cannon instruments section of the Cannon operation article) and replaced on the parapet, where he supported it until a permanent flag staff had been procured and installed. With this rallying point, the colonists held out until sunset, when the British fleet retreated. They did not succeed in taking Charleston until several years later.

Because of Jasper&#x27;s heroism, Governor John Rutledge presented him with his personal sword, and offered him a lieutenant&#x27;s commission. He did not accept the offer to become an officer, saying that he would only be an embarrassment since he could neither read nor write. He was also presented with two silk flags by Mrs. Susannah Elliott.

Battery Jasper, an extension of Fort Moultrie, was built in 1897 and named in his honor.

==Roving commission==

Colonel Moultrie gave him a roving commission to scour the country with a few men, gather information, and attack British forces and outposts. This commission was later renewed by Francis Marion and Benjamin Lincoln. During this period, Jasper liberated a group of American prisoners of war by overpowering their British guards, an incident which was subsequently exaggerated by the storyteller Parson Weems.

==Savannah==
Supposedly, at the Siege of Savannah, he received his death wound while fastening to the parapet the standard which had been presented to his regiment. His hold, however, never relaxed, and he bore the colors to a place of safety before he died.

<text>Massanutten Military Academy (MMA) is a coeducational military school for grades 8 through 12 and one academic postgraduate year, located in Woodstock, Virginia, United States.

==History==
===19th century===
Massanutten Military Academy, named for the nearby mountain, was established by the Virginia Classis of the Reformed Church in 1899. The school opened on September 12, 1899, with 40 students, half of whom were boarders.

===20th century===
From the beginning the school was coed, with the first graduating class in 1902 consisting of three boys and three girls. In 1905, the first of two significant events in the history of the school occurred: Howard J. Benchoff was appointed the school president. He stayed in that position for nearly five decades, to be succeeded for the next decade and a half by his son. Lantz Hall, the second structure on the academy grounds, was begun in 1907 and dedicated in 1909, to accommodate a growing student population.

During the early years of his stewardship Benchoff established several policies. The first was expanding the school size to include number of students, staff, buildings, and acreage. The second, as a result of an otherwise undocumented &quot;incident&quot;, was limiting the boarding department to boys beginning in 1910. The last policy, and the second significant event in the school&#x27;s early history, was adopting a military program. While the program was not implemented until 1917, early in his tenure Benchoff described the goal of a military program as &quot;to train the boys with a discipline that is valuable and give them that easy and graceful carriage which is an accomplishment in any gentleman&#x27;s claim to culture&quot;

In 1930, after receiving an application and inspecting the existing program, the U.S. War Department formally made the school a JROTC unit &quot;placing it on a par with the highest rated military schools in the country&quot;.

===21st century===
The school has a strong academic program with the graduating class of 2017, which consisted of 24 students, earning more than $2,000,000 in scholarships alone. The school also has a strong STEM Program that focuses on experiential learning. 
==Administration==
Kim Elshafie is the current head of school. She is the former dean of academics as well. The Commandant of Cadets is Lieutenant Colonel Lester Layman, U.S. Army (Ret.). The average enrollment is around 125 students. MMA is fully accredited by the Virginia Association of Independent Schools (VAIS) and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).

==Honor code==
As part of its mission the academy has a Cadet Honor Code patterned after the one at West Point. &quot;A cadet will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do.&quot; The Cadet Honor Council consists of juniors and seniors selected by the senior class and the faculty, as approved by the head of school. When a suspected honor code violation is reported, the Honor Council faculty advisers convene the council for a hearing at which the cadets involved are required to explain their conduct. The Honor Council recommends punishment and/or other measures appropriate to educate the Cadet Corps about the expectations of honorable behavior. Final approval lies with the head of school. Continued, repeated violations of the Honor Code may warrant dismissal from the academy.

==JROTC program==

MMA&#x27;s Army Junior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (JROTC) is consistently recognized as an Honor Unit with Distinction. Since 2011, MMA Cadets have qualified to compete in the JROTC Leadership and Academic Bowl (JLAB). Six times they have qualified for Level Two of the competition and three times they have qualified to compete at the national level. For the 2017 competition, MMA is placed in the top 24 programs in the nation and the #1 team in the 4th Brigade of Cadet Command.

<doc id="1074055" wikidata="Q3307596" url="?curid=1074055" title="British Rail Class 121">
<text>The British Rail Class 121 is a single-car double-ended diesel multiple unit. 16 driving motor vehicles were built from 1960, numbered 55020–55035. These were supplemented by ten single-ended trailer vehicles, numbered 56280–56289 (later renumbered 54280–54289). They have a top speed of , with slam-doors, and vacuum brakes. The driving motor vehicles were nicknamed &quot;Bubble Cars&quot; by some enthusiasts (a nickname endorsed and made official by final passenger service operator Chiltern Railways).

The Class 121 is Britain&#x27;s longest serving DMU, operating in passenger service for 57 years until 2017.

==British Railways service==

The Class 121 vehicles were introduced in 1960 for use on the Western Region of British Rail. They were used on various lightly used branch lines in Cornwall including the branch, the branch lines off the main line in the Thames Valley including the Greenford branch line, the Bridport branch line (closed 1975), and the Severn Beach line in Bristol. In 1978 all of the units were still allocated to Western Region depots.

Unlike the earlier (but similar) , which had a small destination indicator in the roof dome, Class 121 had a four-character headcode box in the roof dome, with the destination indicator inside the top of the centre cab window.

==Current operations==

Upon privatisation of Britain&#x27;s railways, the Class 121 fleet was only operated by one passenger company, namely Silverlink, with several more units in departmental duties with Railtrack. Since Chiltern Railways retired its final two units in May 2017, there have been no examples left in revenue-making service.

However, Network Rail operates one Class 121 for various departmental roles. This has been reclassified as a departmental unit. Duties include route learning, video surveying of track and sandite application. In addition, the unit has been specially repainted in old BR blue livery. The unit is based at Aylesbury and was jointly used by Chiltern Railways for route learning.

==Past operations==
===Silverlink===

Silverlink inherited a small fleet of four &quot;Bubble Cars&quot;. They were mainly used on the Marston Vale line from Bletchley to Bedford, as well as non-electrified lines in North London, such as the Gospel Oak to Barking line. The units replaced the previous fleet of and units, and were supplemented with a fleet of units cascaded from Thames Valley services.

The four units, nos. 55023/27/29/31, were based at Bletchley depot, where staff repainted set L123 (55023) into its original British Railways green livery. The others remained in obsolete Network SouthEast livery. In 1996, set L123 was withdrawn from traffic, and the other three were hired to Great Eastern for use on the Sudbury branch. These returned to Bletchley in 1997/98. Two of the units (121027 and 121029) were repainted into Silverlink&#x27;s purple and green livery, and the third (121031) was repainted into Network SouthEast livery. The three units also received names from withdrawn Class 117 units.
* 121027 - &quot;Bletchley TMD&quot;
* 121029 - &quot;Marston Vale&quot;
* 121031 - &quot;Leslie Crabbe&quot;

The units were replaced on Silverlink duties in 2001 by Class 150 &quot;Sprinter&quot; units which had been cascaded from Central Trains. The units have all since been transferred to departmental duties.

===Arriva Trains Wales===

In 2006, 121032 was purchased by Arriva Trains Wales for use on the Cardiff Bay Shuttle. The unit has been repainted into Arriva colours and was hauled to Wales in June 2006 to enter service in July. The unit finally entered service on 16 August 2006 but was withdrawn 3 days later due to a major problem with the engine. The unit re-entered service on the Cardiff Bay line on 14 September 2006. In March 2013, following further extensive periods out of traffic, 121032 was finally withdrawn from service, due to a terminal engine fault. It was subsequently transferred to sister company Chiltern Railways and moved to Aylesbury at the beginning of 2014 and was later sold into preservation at the Wensleydale Railway, moving north at the beginning of May 2015.

===Chiltern Railways===

In 2003, Chiltern Railways reintroduced &quot;Heritage&quot; diesel multiple units on its Aylesbury to Princes Risborough shuttle service. For this purpose, unit 121020 was purchased from Network Rail, and heavily refurbished to allow it to operate passenger services. It was repainted into Chiltern Railways blue livery. The introduction of this unit allowed the release of a &quot;Network Turbo&quot; unit. This unit has been fitted with secondary (magnetic) door locking and other safety features, and thus was exempt from 30 November 2005 deadline for the withdrawal of all Mark 1 vehicles. Electronic destination indicators and internal passenger information systems were recovered from &quot;Network Turbo&quot; 165 032 at refurbishment and fitted to this unit. The external exhaust pipes were rerouted through the brake van area.

In May 2011, a second &quot;Bubble Car&quot; was reintroduced to regular service. Unit 121034, previously based at Tyseley Loco Works, was (less extensively) refurbished for use by the Birmingham Railway Museum. It is painted in BR Green livery and was also used on Aylesbury to Princes Risborough services, when required.

Both units were additionally used on shuttles, as required, between Aylesbury and Quainton Road stations, on the occasion of events at the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre.

In March 2013, Chiltern Railways acquired 121032 from Arriva Trains Wales. It sold the unit for preservation in 2015.

Chiltern&#x27;s two final units were withdrawn from service on 19 May 2017, due to difficulties in obtaining spare parts given the age of the units, which were more than 50 years old. They were subsequently sold.

==Fleet details==
===Active units===
Remarkably, considering the age of the fleet, the oldest unit (55020) was also the final unit withdrawn alongside 55034, which remained in daily service until 2017, whilst the youngest vehicle (55035) was the first to be dismantled. As of July 2014, 55021 (960021) and 55030 (960013) have also been scrapped.

==Preservation==
Class 121s have proved popular for preservation on heritage railways.

==Order details==
== Model railways ==
A OO gauge model of the Class 121 was produced by Lima in 1998. The model was produced as unit 55035 in all-over rail blue livery and unit 55027 in Network SouthEast livery. In 2006, Hornby Railways launched its first version of the BR Class 121 in OO gauge. This model was produced in BR blue and BR green, using the Lima body mouldings that Hornby had acquired. Since 2017 Hornby have produced a basic representation of the prototype as part of their Railroad range in BR Green.

<doc id="1074060" wikidata="Q630263" url="?curid=1074060" title="King (crater)">
<text>King is a prominent lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, and can not be viewed directly from Earth. The crater was named after Arthur Scott King and Edward Skinner King in 1970. Prior to that, this crater was known as &quot;Crater 211&quot;. It forms a pair with Ibn Firnas, which is only slightly larger and is attached to the northeast rim of King. To the northwest is the crater Lobachevskiy, and Guyot is located an equal distance to the north-northwest.

==Description==
The outer rim of King is roughly circular but with a slightly irregular appearance, particularly at the northern end. The crater displays little appearance of wear. The inner walls are d, particularly along the eastern side. Within the walls is a somewhat uneven interior floor. The interior is irregular and ridged, particularly in the eastern half. The elongated, Y-shaped central rise is part of a ridge that runs to the southern rim.

Due to its prominent rays, King is mapped as part of the Copernican System.

===Sita crater===
A tiny crater near the east-southeastern inner wall has been officially given the Indian feminine name Sita by the IAU. It is located at selenographic coordinates 4.6° N, 120.8° E, and has a diameter of 2 kilometres.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to King.

King Y is to the north of King, and it is now a &quot;pool&quot; of impact melt, filled at the time of the King impact. The name &quot;Al-Tusi&quot; had been suggested for King Y, but this was not approved by the IAU. King J is a small crater to the southeast of King, and it is covered by King&#x27;s ejecta blanket.

==Mountain Peaks==

Several mountain peaks (&quot;Montes&quot;) within King crater have been named. The names were approved by the IAU in 1976.

<text>Balandin is a small crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. It lies within the large walled plain Gagarin, close to the eastern rim.

Balandin is circular with a somewhat unusual hummocky interior floor, similar to the nearby Kosberg, to Barbier F within Barbier, or to Van den Bos. It is adjacent to slightly smaller (unnamed) craters to the east and west.

<text>Samuel Finley Vinton (September 25, 1792 – May 11, 1862) was a member of the United States House of Representatives from Ohio from March 4, 1823 to March 3, 1837 and again from March 4, 1843 to March 3, 1851.

==Biography==
Born in South Hadley, Massachusetts, Vinton was the son of Abiatha and Sarah (Day) Vinton. He graduated from Williams College in 1814, paying his way through school by teaching. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in Connecticut in 1816. He then moved to southern Ohio and practiced law in Gallipolis. On August 18, 1824, he married Romaine Madeleine Bureau, daughter of John Peter Roman Bureau and Madeleine Françoise Charlotte Marret, in Gallia County, Ohio. She died in 1831, after the couple had had a son and a daughter, Madeleine Vinton Dahlgren.

After holding various local offices, he was elected to the Eighteenth Congress on a non-partisan ballot. Vinton was re-elected to the Nineteenth, Twentieth, Twenty-first, Twenty-second, Twenty Third and Twenty-fourth Congresses. In the Twenty-third Congress he was an Anti-Jacksonian Democrat and in the Twenty-fourth and succeeding Congresses he was a Whig.

He did not seek re-election in 1836, returning to Ohio to his successful practice of law. Whig Presidential elector in 1840 for Harrison/Tyler. However, he returned to Congress in 1843, again as a Whig. In his second service in Congress, he was a member of the Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth, Thirtieth, and Thirty-first Congresses. He was noted for his service on the Public Lands Committee, helping to create the United States Department of the Interior, and, as Thomas Ewing put it, had &quot;more influence in the House of Representatives, much more, than any other man in it.&quot; He was an authority on parliamentary procedure and in the Thirtieth Congress, he declined the Speakership but took the chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee instead.

President Millard Fillmore offered him the post of Secretary of the Interior, but he declined. He did not run for re-election in 1850, instead running for Governor of Ohio as a Whig in 1851. In 1853, he became president of the Cleveland and Toledo Railroad, retiring the next year to Washington, D.C.

In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln appointed him to appraise the value of slaves freed in the District of Columbia. He died in Washington that year and was buried in Gallipolis, Ohio.

He was a trustee of Ohio University from 1848 to 1862.

==Personal life==
His daughter, Madeleine Vinton Dahlgren was a writer. His son-in-law was Admiral John A. Dahlgren.

==Legacy==
Vinton County, Ohio and Vinton, Ohio are named for him.

<doc id="1074075" wikidata="Q16207168" url="?curid=1074075" title="Leigh Diffey">
<text>Leigh Diffey (born 3 March 1971) is an Australian-American auto racing and track and field commentator. He is best known for being the lead play-by-play announcer for much of NBC Sports&#x27; motorsports coverage, currently calling NASCAR Cup Series, IMSA sports car races for the network and AMA Supercross. Before this, he was the lead voice of NBC&#x27;s Formula One and IndyCar Series coverage. Diffey has also worked play-by-play for NBC&#x27;s coverage of the Summer and Winter Olympic Games, most notably becoming the network&#x27;s lead track and field sportscaster prior to the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

Diffey&#x27;s broadcasting career began by calling motorcycle races in his home country. His career has included stints with Network Ten in Australia and the BBC in the United Kingdom covering various forms of motorsport. In the United States, Diffey joined Speed Channel in 2003 before moving to NBC when Formula One&#x27;s US television rights were transferred to the network in 2013.

== Early career: Network Ten and BBC ==
Diffey grew up in Queensland, Australia, where he briefly raced motorcycles with his friend Daryl Beattie, who eventually became a professional motorcycle racer. Diffey worked as a physical education teacher at Ipswich Grammar School. Meanwhile, he began working in motorsports broadcasting; his first job came in 1990 at the age of 19, calling Ipswich Motorcycle Club racing at Tivoli Raceway. In 1995 he left his teacher job to pursue a full-time career in sports television.

After two years with the Australian Super Touring Championship broadcasting team for Network Ten, Diffey became the V8 Supercars lead announcer in 1997, partnering with Greg Rust, Barry Sheene, Bill Woods and Mark Oastler. He also covered the 12 Hours of Sebring, an event for he would call for a total of ten years.

Diffey moved to the United Kingdom in 2000, where he worked as the lead commentator of the Superbike World Championship and presented coverage of the World Rally Championship for the BBC, working alongside Steve Parrish and Suzi Perry.

== 2003–2012: Speed Channel and return to Network Ten ==
In 2001, Diffey moved to the US to cover the American-based open-wheel racing CART series, while still working for the BBC. Two years later in 2003, Diffey made a full-time move to the States when he was hired by Speed Channel, which later simply became &quot;Speed&quot;. At Speed, Diffey was the play-by-play announcer for the network&#x27;s coverage of the Speed World Challenge, the American Le Mans Series, the Rolex Sports Car Series, the Rolex Grand-Am Cup, the SCCA Trans-Am Series, and a regular anchor of &quot;The Speed Report&quot; and &quot;Speed Center&quot;. Diffey occasionally filled in for Speed commentator Bob Varsha during the network&#x27;s Formula One broadcasts. He also commentated selected rounds of the AMA Superbike and AMA Motocross Championships.

Diffey worked with Speed to call several sports car races during his tenure with the network, including the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. During this time, Diffey also worked with Network Ten in Australia as a regular host for the network&#x27;s nightly sports wrap, &quot;Sports Tonight&quot;. He also covered other two other sports for the Australian network: sailing, hosting coverage of the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, and golf, which he covered for five years. In 2011 alone, he covered no fewer than sixteen individual divisions of motorsport on Speed.

== 2013–present: NBC Sports ==

=== Motorsports ===

==== Formula One and IndyCar ====
In November 2012, NBC Sports announced that Diffey would join its network to become the play-by-play announcer for its broadcasts of both Formula One and IndyCar events starting in 2013. Diffey called the day of the announcement &quot;one of the best days of my life. People have been so complimentary.&quot; The announcement named David Hobbs and Steve Matchett as the analysts who would work alongside him for the Formula One broadcasts. In December 2015, Diffey, Hobbs and Matchett were given an Honorable Mention in a list of Best Broadcast Teams of the year published on the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; website SI.com.

On two occasions, Diffey covered both series on the same day. On 23 August 2015, he called the Belgian Grand Prix from NBC&#x27;s base in Stamford, Connecticut, before he and Matchett traveled to Pocono Raceway for the ABC Supply 500. Likewise, on 3 September 2017, Diffey called the Italian Grand Prix in Connecticut and then traveled to Watkins Glen International for the IndyCar Grand Prix at The Glen. Diffey&#x27;s open-wheel focus shifted solely to IndyCar in 2018 when the US Formula One television rights were transferred to ESPN and they chose to take commentary from Sky Sports insteading of making their own.

==== NASCAR ====
Diffey was one of several recurring co-hosts of &quot;NASCAR America&quot;, a weekday NBCSN program dedicated to NASCAR. While he had covered NASCAR practice and qualifying sessions with Speed, it was not until his tenure with NBC that he made his NASCAR debut as a play-by-play announcer for a race, covering the Xfinity Series (NXS) at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course on 15 August 2015. After calling the race, Diffey spoke of the experience as &quot;a thrill...I&#x27;ve been a NASCAR fan and dabbled in it, and for that to be my first race was something else.&quot; He also commentated the Richmond, Dover, and Kansas NXS races.

Diffey made his Sprint Cup Series broadcasting debut alongside Dale Jarrett at Homestead-Miami Speedway in 2015, leading NBCSN&#x27;s &quot;Hot Pass&quot; coverage of NASCAR&#x27;s championship race, which focused solely on the four drivers still eligible for the series championship. Diffey reprised this role with Parker Kligerman in the 2016 Homestead race, and again with Jarrett in 2017, 2018, and 2019.

In August 2017, Diffey served as the lead announcer for &quot;NASCAR on NBC&quot;″s primary coverage of the renamed Monster Energy Cup Series for two races (the I Love New York 355 at The Glen and the Pure Michigan 400), filling in for regular announcer Rick Allen who was working in London with NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2017 IAAF World Championships.

On 13 March 2024, it was reported that Diffey would replace Allen in NBC&#x27;s NASCAR Cup Series booth shortly after the 2024 Summer Olympics. &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; reported on 8 August that Diffey&#x27;s first race would be the Coke Zero Sugar 400 at Daytona International Speedway. Diffey was officially confirmed by NBC on 20 August as the network&#x27;s new play-by-play voice for the Cup Series. Consequently, Kevin Lee filled for him in the IndyCar booth for the rest of the year.

Diffey returned to sports car racing in 2019 as the lead announcer for NBC Sports&#x27; coverage of IMSA&#x27;s WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, beginning with the 2019 24 Hours of Daytona.

==== Motorcycles ====
Diffey began calling the AMA Supercross Championship in 2020, working play-by-play for NBC for the series along with Ralph Sheheen. 
Diffey took over the lead commentating role replacing Sheheen starting the 2021 season with Ricky Carmichael, Daniel Blair, and Will Christien.
He also served as a studio host for the network&#x27;s MotoGP and Moto2 coverage.

==== Global Rallycross ====
Diffey served as lead announcer for several events of NBCSN&#x27;s coverage of Red Bull Global Rallycross beginning with the opening event from Fort Lauderdale in the 2015 season. He continued to cover the series for the network until the series folded, doing play-by-play for the final round of the 2017 season from the Port of Los Angeles on 14 October.

==== Dakar Rally ====
Diffey served as the US announcer for the daily world feed highlight broadcast of the Dakar Rally on NBCSN.

=== Other sports ===
Diffey has worked on NBC&#x27;s coverage of the Olympic Games, covering luge, skeleton, and bobsled at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi. NBC executive Sam Flood had expressed interest in having him serve as an announcer outside of motorsports while negotiating his contract with the network, and he prepared Diffey for the Olympics by having him host the Penn Relays and the Luge World Cup. Diffey remarked of serving in the Olympics: &quot;Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine this is where my career would take me. Just working for NBC, that alone made my life. Now going to the Olympics for NBC? I just pinch myself as if to wonder is this really happening?&quot; He returned to the Olympics to cover rowing at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, and also called the same events he had in Sochi at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyongchang.

Beyond the Olympics, Diffey has covered rugby, anchoring studio coverage of Premiership Rugby and doing play-by-play for the Collegiate Rugby Championship. He also covered the Prefontaine Classic in 2018, as well as the 2019 World Athletics Championships.

In 2021, Diffey took over as the NBC track and field commentator, covering both the US Olympic trials and the 2020 Summer Olympics. 

At the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, Diffey botched the call of the men&#x27;s 100 metre final, hastily declaring Jamaican Kishane Thompson the winner in a photo finish which found American sprinter Noah Lyles officially winning the gold medal. Diffey took responsibility for the mistake in a social media post the following day, saying, &quot;My eyes [and] instinct told me Kishane Thompson won. Obviously, that wasn&#x27;t the case. I shouldn&#x27;t have been so bold to call it, but I genuinely thought he won. I got it wrong.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Diffey obtained his United States citizenship in 2011, explaining, &quot;This country has given me so much, and I felt I needed to give back. That&#x27;s why I accepted US citizenship. I&#x27;m Australian and I&#x27;m also American.&quot; A former resident of Charlotte, North Carolina, he currently resides in Connecticut with his wife and two children.

<doc id="1074080" wikidata="Q3868865" url="?curid=1074080" title="My Living Doll">
<text>My Living Doll is an American science-fiction sitcom starring Bob Cummings and Julie Newmar. The series was aired on CBS from September 27, 1964, to March 17, 1965. It was produced by Jack Chertok and filmed at Desilu studios by Jack Chertok Television Productions, in association with the CBS Television Network.

==Series background==
The series starred Bob Cummings as Dr. Bob McDonald, a psychiatrist. His friend Dr. Carl Miller (Henry Beckman), a scientist with the U.S. Air Force being transferred to Pakistan, shows Bob his latest invention: a lifelike android in the form of a sexy, Amazonian female, AF 709. Miller gives the prototype robot, also called Rhoda (Julie Newmar), to Bob. Bob is initially reluctant, but soon becomes intrigued by the experiment of educating this sophisticated but naive robot. The series&#x27; episodes center around Rhoda&#x27;s attempts to learn how human society works, and Bob&#x27;s attempts to teach Rhoda how to be &quot;the perfect woman&quot;, which he defines as one who &quot;does what she&#x27;s told&quot; and &quot;doesn&#x27;t talk back.&quot; He also strives to keep her identity secret by saying that she is Carl&#x27;s niece.

Rhoda also begins showing (or at least emulating) rudimentary emotions as the series progresses. For example, in the episode &quot;The Kleptomaniac&quot;, she displays a childlike, playful attitude. At one point McDonald notices this and utters, &quot;What a goofy robot!&quot;, to which Rhoda replies, beaming, &quot;The goofiest!&quot; At the conclusion of this episode, Rhoda giggles without prompting after pulling a plot-resolving prank on another character. Another episode, &quot;The Pool Shark&quot;, has Rhoda displaying apparent enjoyment in playing pool. The series does not explore whether these are truly learned behaviors or the result of programming, or if, in the fantasy context of the series, Rhoda is truly learning human emotion.

Other regular cast members included:
*Doris Dowling as Irene Adams, Bob&#x27;s sister, whom he asks to move in as his housekeeper and chaperone to keep his neighbors from thinking that something inappropriate is going on between Rhoda and him. She was dropped from the cast when Bob was transferred to Pakistan.
*Jack Mullaney as Peter Robinson, a lecherous colleague and neighbor of Bob&#x27;s who decides that Rhoda is the girl of his dreams. A regular supporting character in episodes 1-20, he learns the truth in the fifth-to-last episode, after Bob is transferred to Pakistan. As of episode 21, he becomes Rhoda&#x27;s guardian (and series co-lead).
*Nora Marlowe as Mrs. Moffat, Peter&#x27;s housekeeper. She was added to the cast when Peter became Rhoda&#x27;s guardian.

==Production==
The show was created by Jack Chertok based on the Pygmalion–Galatea myth. The series was unusual in that it was bought by the network without a formal pilot, at the request of CBS&#x27;s president James T. Aubrey, due to the success of Chertok&#x27;s series &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;. The show was announced in April 1964. Filming began at Desilu Studios in July 1964. Outdoor scenes for the opening episode (&quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot;) were filmed at Space Park under the pseudonym of &quot;Space Research Center&quot; (SRC). It was there in Redondo Beach, California that Rhoda was shown wandering off the campus, but was soon found by Dr. McDonald across the street at a drive-in named &quot;Phil&#x27;s Freeze&quot; in Manhattan Beach.

The series was developed with Julie Newmar in mind for the female lead. CBS had been looking for a vehicle for Newmar for two years, and found this to be the best project for her. Producers originally wanted Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. for the male lead, originally meant to be a &quot;straight&quot; role opposite Newmar. However, CBS also had Bob Cummings under contract, and overruled them to place Cummings in the series.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;, reviewing the show in September, said it:
===Cummings&#x27; departure===
Despite good reviews, early ratings were poor. The show was initially scheduled opposite NBC&#x27;s &quot;Bonanza&quot; on Sunday nights, but was shifted to Wednesdays in December in an attempt to improve ratings. This did not work, and in January, Cummings asked to be written out of the show after 21 episodes. CBS did not announce a replacement for him, indicating that they did not want to continue the series.

At the time, reportedly Cummings and Newmar were not getting along during production, with Newmar stating in a 1965 interview that Cummings had tried to teach her how to act, was unhappy that she appeared to be getting more press attention than he was, and was &quot;trying too desperately to hold on to his long-gone youth&quot;. However, this is denied by Newmar and show producer Howard Leeds in &quot;The Living Doll Story&quot;, a featurette included in the 2012 DVD release.

Another report said that Cummings was unhappy with the size of his role in comparison to Newmar&#x27;s.

In later years, Newmar said the trouble was Cummings&#x27; addiction to methamphetamine. She says this contributed to his erratic behavior on set, as well as his increasing depression and insecurity. He demanded that the show focus more on his character. CBS refused and Cummings left.

Cumming&#x27;s last appearance was in &quot;The Witness&quot;, the show&#x27;s 21st episode, which aired on 10 February 1965. The following week&#x27;s episode explained that his character had been transferred to Pakistan; the Peter character learns Rhoda&#x27;s secret and takes over the position of watching over her. This was the plot device for the last five episodes of the season, and the series was not renewed for a second season.

&quot;Filmink&quot; argued &quot;the concept pre-empted &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; but there are key differences which sink it (it’s far more mean-spirited than Jeannie, and the female lead has far less agency).&quot;

===Opening credits===
Two versions of the opening credits were created. The first version had Rhoda wearing short lingerie similar to a teddy; according to an interview with Newmar included on the DVD release, this version was rejected as being too risque, so a new version with Rhoda wearing a long dress (though a little suggestive of lingerie) was filmed. This latter version is the one used on the versions of the episodes that were broadcast and released to DVD; however, the unofficial circulation of several episodes used the teddy version of the credits.

==Episodes==

 Episode is lost.

==Home media==
On March 20, 2012, MPI Home Video released &quot;My Living Doll—The Official Collection, Volume 1&quot; on DVD in Region 1. The 2-disc set features 11 episodes of the series. The episodes featured on the DVD collection were created from 16mm prints of the show held by collectors, as the one known set of original 35mm negatives were destroyed in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. It is unknown if the remaining 15 episodes exist.

==In popular culture==
According to &quot;The Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang&quot;, &quot;My Living Doll&quot; is the source of the science fiction phrase &quot;Does not compute&quot; in popular culture.

&quot;My Living Doll&quot; producer Howard Leeds went on to create &quot;Small Wonder&quot;, a 1980s sitcom featuring a young girl robot named Vicki. He also employed composer George Greeley, who wrote the music for &quot;My Living Doll&quot;.

Leeds, when in the employ of Reg Grundy Productions Australia producing &quot;Chopper Squad&quot;, proposed and produced a new &quot;My Living Doll&quot; presentation pilot, &quot;Billion Dollar Baby&quot;, using an all-Australian cast.

In 2018, Jack Chertok Television Productions producer Peter Greenwood apparently had posts on his LinkedIn account stating that he had begun active development of a new &quot;My Living Doll&quot; limited series; his account also featured a bound set of the original series scripts as part of the post. The posts may also have stated that the reboot &quot;would be more in tune with present-day morals and would change a great deal of the format to highlight the character, based on the current need for positive, intelligent and meaningful female role models.&quot;

It has been speculated that the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; character Seven of Nine&#x27;s name is a homage to Rhoda&#x27;s original designation as AF 709.

<text>Raymond Burke (né Barrois; 6 June 1904 – 21 March 1986) was an American jazz clarinetist.

==Biography==
Raymond Burke was born Raymond Barrois on June 6, 1904, in New Orleans, Louisiana. He gave few interviews and believed the life of a musician had little to do with his music.

He was polite, albeit eccentric. He had wavy hair, a thin mustache, and dressed conservatively. He spoke with a thick New Orleans accent and used colorful regional vocabulary, which some found confusing. He did not drink, smoke, or gamble. He is portrayed as unpretentious.

Burke rarely left the city except for out-of-town gigs or tours with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band later in life. His friend and jazz enthusiast Al Rose said Burke spent no more than ten weeks outside of New Orleans. Burke was the nephew of Jules Cassard, a jazz trombonist who played with the Reliance Brass Band, and the cousin of Dixieland musician Harold Peterson.

Burke said that his first instrument was a flute he carved from a fishing pole. He then played the tin whistle, kazoo, and clarinet. His first job in music came in 1913 when he panhandled on the kazoo with future New Orleans Rhythm Kings drummer Leo Adde who played percussion on a cigar box.

In the 1930s Burke played with The Henry Belas Orchestra (trumpeter Henry Belas, trombonist Al Moore, drummer Joe Stephens, and pianist &quot;PeeWee&quot;); The Melon Pickers (guitarist Henry Walde, bassist John Bell, drummer Al Doria, trumpeter Bill Nauin, and pianist Julius Chevez.) Burke also spent a short period of time in Kansas City for a musical job, but soon returned.

In the 1940s and &#x27;50s he played with Alvin Alcorn, Sharkey Bonano, and frequently in a trio with pianist Jeff Riddick and bassist Sherwood Mangiapane. In the 1960s and 70s Burke he played with Preservation Hall musicians.

==Rabais Shop==
According to his colleagues, Burke&#x27;s only non-musical form of employment was the management of a &quot;Rabais&quot; shop at 906 Bourbon Street. According to friend Al Rose, a Rabais shop is &quot;not as high flown as an antique store nor as disreputable as a junk Shop&quot; It is a personal collection that the owner makes semi-available to the public for sale. Burke&#x27;s shop was in a residential section of Bourbon Street which had light pedestrian traffic and generated very little business. It lacked furniture, except for one wooden stool where Burke sat, and it also lacked electricity, ensuring that the shop closed at sundown.

The shop was filled with old jazz records, historical memorabilia, musical instruments and equipment, books, magazines, and a collection of sheet music. Being dark and cluttered on the inside, the store was not made for browsing. Rather, if a patron had a specific request, Burke would recall whether he had the object in stock, and if so, would have to find it in the collection. Al Rose claims that the store averaged about two dollars of income per day. However, he also argues that the store had another, more musically important purpose. Throughout the work day (from 1pm to sundown) musicians would seek Burke at the Rabais to play with him. These sessions were informal and unattended, consisting of Burke&#x27;s clarinet and whatever instrument the player(s) had brought. By the end of any given day, Rose estimates that up to a dozen musicians would have stopped by to play with Burke. Among these men were amateurs as well as distinguished musical talent.

==Popularity==
While Burke was an active musician for most of his life, he did not achieve mainstream popularity or commercial success. He was known for playing modestly, and in large ensembles his clarinet could easily be overpowered. Burke also refused to let contemporary music influence his sound for commercial reasons, and played in what many considered an outdated style. Another possible factor in Burke&#x27;s obscurity is his association with &quot;Second Line&quot; jazz. Although the term has several different meanings, it has been used to differentiate white musicians who played New Orleans Style jazz from black or Creole musicians. Since New Orleans jazz is typically associated with the African American population in that city, &quot;Second Line&quot; can be used negatively to refer to white musicians who have imitated and simplified this style. Thus, Charles Suhor argues that Burke, as well as other talented white New Orleans Jazz musicians, was neglected throughout much of his early career and not taken seriously.

According to John Steiner, 1939 was an important year for the discovery of Burke&#x27;s music, as well as for other relatively low key jazz musicians. This year marked the availability of cheap, portable recorders. Jazz enthusiasts would bring these devices to local jam sessions and record their favorite musicians. Among these collectors, recordings were passed around, and Burke&#x27;s audience increased gradually over the next two decades. As a result, Burke became especially popular with jazz insiders rather than the public. According to Steiner, jazz enthusiasts feared that Burke could become another forgotten jazz great, similar to Buddy Bolden, and so attempted to spread his music.

==Style characteristics==
Raymond Burke played in the Dixieland style. According to Charles Suhor, Dixieland is characterized by &quot;more conventional tones of wind instruments, rejection of rapid vibratos, greater instrumental facility, and considerable attention to solos, which are routinely &#x27;passed around&#x27; in between opening and closing ensemble choruses.&quot; Burke&#x27;s repertoire consisted primarily of old standards.

&quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer, John S. Wilson claimed that Burke &quot;used mellow, woodsy lower notes to build delightfully catchy little phrases and runs.&quot;He also noted that Burke would wriggle around in his seat while playing, and that, during solos, he would play from a strange, semi-crouched position. He also commended Burke&#x27;s &quot;unhurried&quot; approach. Although Dixieland is often assumed to be a campy imitation of past music, Wilson notes that Burke does not depend on musical stereotypes or clichés. Al Rose also claims that although Burke&#x27;s music was traditional it wasn&#x27;t nostalgic. Instead of imitating the musical style of 1920s jazz, Rose felt that Burke remained an innovative musician who happened to work through that particular style of music.

A concert in 1965 exemplified many of his musical characteristics. This concert brought Burke together with Chicago style pianist Art Hodes. Although the reviewer claims that the group was prone to &quot;ragged endings&quot; and occasional uncertainty and hesitation, he applauds Burke&#x27;s ability to play with Hodes and feed off his spontaneity. The reviewer notes Burke&#x27;s economic solo lines and argues that he was a master of spreading out musical ideas. The review asserts that Burke had an excellent handling of the lower register of the clarinet, known as the chalumeau register. Burke would often begin a solo line with an unexpected high note, then proceed down in pitch until he reached this register.

Even within the Dixieland style, Burke&#x27;s playing was viewed as eccentric. Al Rose claimed that, &quot;He just doesn&#x27;t play a clarinet part! The tourist expects to hear the really conventional harmony, and Raymond just won&#x27;t stick to it. He&#x27;s got all that ingenious counterpoint on his mind—and you know, if it&#x27;s on his mind, he blows it!&quot;

He refused to play music which he deemed too fast or too slow. He believed that playing music at a fast tempo was showing off and distracted the audience. On the other hand, he also insisted that jazz shouldn&#x27;t be played too slow, claiming that &quot;the blues ain&#x27;t funeral music.

Unlike many musicians who became associated with the New Orleans style, he did not flutter or play in an uncontrolled way. He would not sacrifice tone for a crowd-pleasing effect. He was known to stop during a performance and walk offstage if he felt one of his bandmates was pandering to the audience.

==Preservation Hall==
Preservation Hall was a concert space established in the 1960s which became the center of a revival in New Orleans jazz. In 1961, Icon Records executive Grayson Mills traveled to New Orleans in order to record veteran jazz musicians. Because many of these players were elderly, Mills conceived of Preservation Hall as a place to practice and gain back their skills in front of an audience. Preservation Hall was designed solely for listening to the musicians. The Hall served no food or drinks, had only a few rows of benches for seating, and lacked a dance floor. Donation was the only source of revenue for the club, as admittance was free. Mills hoped that, if the musicians were not worried about appealing to tourists or needy club owners, they would regain their creativity. He became a regular Preservation Hall musician for the rest of his life.

In the mid 1960s, Allan Jaffe assumed management of Preservation Hall and expanded its operations. To ensure the financial survival of the Hall during low tourist seasons, Jaffe began looking at alternative ways for Preservation Hall to maintain an income. He began managing numerous &quot;Preservation Hall Bands&quot;, negotiating recording contracts, and sending groups on international tours, even sending Burke to the Soviet Union in 1979.

==Influence==
According to Al Rose, although Burke is admired by jazz musicians and fans, he has had no influence. Because Dixieland is sometimes considered outdated, there are few players who approach it with the same creativity as Burke. Furthermore, his playing was considered eccentric even within the Dixieland style. For instance, in a &quot;Second Line&quot; magazine article, Rose recalls suggesting to musician George Girard that he adopt Burke into his band. His response was, &quot;Man, that would be plain heaven, but if I had him i&#x27;d still need a clarinet player.&quot;

<text>Naonobu is a small lunar impact crater named after Japanese mathematician Ajima Naonobu. It is located on the eastern Mare Fecunditatis, to the northwest of the prominent crater Langrenus, and it forms a triple-crater formation with the adjacent Atwood to the south and Bilharz just to the southwest. Naonobu and Atwood are separated by only a few kilometres.

The interior of this crater has been flooded with basaltic lava, leaving a relatively flat interior and a reduced outer rim. There is no central peak, but a small crater lies just to the southwest of the midpoint. A similar crater lies across the western interior of the rim.

This crater was previously designated Langrenus B before being renamed by the IAU in 1976.

<text>World Triathlon, previously known as the International Triathlon Union (ITU), is the international governing body for the multi-sport disciplines of triathlon, duathlon, aquathlon and other nonstandard variations. It is recognised as the international federation for the sport of triathlon and its derivatives by the International Olympic Committee, and it organises Olympic triathlon events on behalf of the IOC.

In addition to regulating and setting the rules of the sport, World Triathlon organises the top level international race series the World Triathlon Championship Series and the ITU Triathlon World Cup. Starting in 2024, World Triathlon also sanctions and recognises a World Championship Tour of Long-Distance Triathlon organised by the Professional Triathletes Organisation. World Triathlon does not have an official relationship with the other three major commercial triathlon circuits, Ironman Triathlon, XTERRA Triathlon or Super League Triathlon.

Additionally, World Triathlon regulated, sanctions and organizes official sprint distance and team relay triathlon championships, as wel as Aquathlon (run-swim-run), Duathlon (run-bike-run) and Winter triathlon championships.

World Triathlon is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland

== History ==

Versions of swim bike run multi-sports existed in the 1920s, but it wasn&#x27;t until the term triathlon was coined in 1974 in San Diego that triathlon exploded in popularity. This rapid development drew the attention of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which initiated a discussion in 1988 to include it in the Olympic Games program. The then IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch held a meeting in Stockholm, Sweden, with the intention of making triathlon an Olympic sport as soon as possible. At that meeting Canadian Les McDonald was selected as President to a working committee for triathlon, while Sweden&#x27;s Sture Jonasson was elected as Secretary.

World Triathlon was founded as the International Triathlon Union (ITU) one year later, on April 1, 1989, at the first ITU Congress in Avignon, France. A total of 30 National Federations attended the initial Congress and preparations were made for the sport&#x27;s first World Championships to be held in Avignon in August 1989. At this meeting the Olympic distance (later renamed to standard) was set at a 1.5-km swim, 40-km bike and 10-km run the distances were chosen as they were already present at the Olympics for each discipline individually. More than 800 athletes representing 40 countries competed in the first World Championships, and Canada&#x27;s Les McDonald was elected as ITU&#x27;s first president in 1989.

ITU began the World Cup series in 1991, staging 11 races in eight countries. Triathlon was officially added to the Olympic Programme by the IOC at its Congress in Paris in 1994. Triathlon made its Olympic debut at the 2000 Games in Sydney.

Since its inception World Triathlon has maintained its headquarters in Vancouver, Canada until January 1, 2014 when it moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, home of the IOC and many international sporting bodies.

Spain&#x27;s Marisol Casado was elected as World Triathlon&#x27;s second president in November 2008. She became an IOC member in February 2010 at the 122nd IOC Session in World Triathlon&#x27;s hometown of Vancouver. She was re-elected for a new four-year term in October 2012. The Canadian Loreen Barnett maintains its general secretary 3, with Sarah Springman named 1st vice-president and honorary member of the World Federation, hence in 2012 it was the only worldwide federation of an Olympic sport with an all-female management. In December 2016, Casado was re-elected for a third term as president of the International Federation at the 29th Congress held in Madrid 6.

In 2009 the International Triathlon Federation reorganised its top level competitions changing the World championship to the World Triathlon Series, an eight-stage competition circuit in eight countries, and relegated the world cup down to a second tier series below the world series with less prize money and world ranking points. It also organizes a series of world competitions at different distances from chained sports derived from the triathlon it manages, such as duathlon, aquathlon, cross-triathlon, winter triathlon and paratriathlon.

In June 2017, following the renewal of the federal application, the International Olympic Committee included a third triathlon event on the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, the mixed team relay. With the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s short-distance triathlon events, three triathlon events offer Olympic titles to triathletes. By joining other sports who practice these forms of mixed events, this approach within the scope of the promotion of equality policies between men and women triathletes supported by the international federation.

In September 2017, World Triathlon announced the death of its founding and honorary President, Les McDonald, at the age of 84. He was awarded the Order of Canada in 2013 for service to the nation and inducted into its &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; in 2014 for his work for triathlon.

In October 2020, the ITU officially adopted the name World Triathlon.

==International structure==
World Triathlon is structured into 5 continental regions, through which 172 national federations (the governing body of triathlon in each country) are affiliated to World Triathlon. Each region offers a Continental Championship and Continental Cup Series.

: Asia Triathlon representing 35 national federations
: Africa Triathlon representing 37 national federations
: Europe Triathlon representing 46 national federations
: Americas Triathlon representing 40 national federations
: Oceania Triathlon representing 14 national federations

In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Europe Triathlon said that it strongly supported the decision of the International Olympic Committee and World Triathlon to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from organised European events, and to not organise international events in Russia or Belarus.

==Development==
World Triathlon has an ongoing effort to develop the sport especially outside of Europe and English speaking countries. One method is through development grants such as the recent one to the African Triathlon Union, with most of the money to national federations allowing for support of organize events, as well as funding for athlete, coach and Technical Officials courses. Another is athlete scholarships to be given to young athletes that have shown talent but who need more support than their developing National Federation can give, allowing them to perform at an international level, the end goal of these scholarships is the athletes performing for their county at the Olympic games. One global development is the introduction of certifications for coaching and technical officials meaning that important events will be contested at the high level.

==Ranking system==
World Triathlon publishes and maintains the World Rankings for the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competitions in both short and long course for triathlon and duathlon as well as aquathlon and winter triathlon races it also has a ranking for the national teams mixed relay. Each ranking has a slightly different point system but all are calculated via a rolling calendar, by taking a set number of the highest scoring results from the previous 52 weeks and adding them to a set number of the highest scoring results from the 53 to 104 weeks previous. Each races maximum score is decided by the ITU&#x27;s ranking criteria and then the athlete who comes first will earn that many points with each following athlete earning 7.5% less point than the athlete before them.

==Championships==
In its founding year World Triathlon only ran the World triathlon championship, the following year it also began hosting the duathlon world championship. In 1991 the ITU started hosting a series of triathlon races as the triathlon World Cup. The distances chosen for the World championship and World Cup races were 1,500m swimming, 40 km of bike and 10 km of running, these parameters were chosen from existing distances in swimming, cycling and running disciplines in the Olympic Games. This triathlon distance has become known as the standard distance in the world of triathlon. In 1994 to have a long-distance championship similar to Ironman Triathlon events but hosted by the sports governing body the Long Distance Triathlon World Championships was founded and in 1997 parity was brought to duathlon with the Long Distance Duathlon World Championships. Also in 1997 the first Winter Triathlon World Championships was held giving the sport of winter triathlons its own world championship. Then in 1998 the Aquathlon World Championships were inaugurated, giving aquathlon its own world championship. In 2009 the Triathlon Mixed Relay World Championships was held to organise an elite-level international relay. The most recently created tournament is the Cross Triathlon World Championships; similar to how long-distance world championships were introduced to mirror the well known Ironman events, it was created to allow the sports governing body to have a world championship instead of XTERRA Triathlon. Both Ironman and XTERRA also operate &#x27;world championship&#x27; events.

The world championship events organised by World Triathlon include:

<text>Spoon bending is the deformation of objects, especially metal cutlery, purportedly by paranormal means. It is a common theme for magic tricks, which use a variety of methods to produce the effect. Performers commonly use misdirection to draw their audience&#x27;s attention away while the spoon is manually bent. Another method uses a metal spoon that has been prepared by repeatedly bending the spoon back and forth, weakening the material. Applying light pressure will then cause it to bend or break.

Spoon bending attracted considerable media attention in the 1970s when a number of individuals claimed to have the ability to cause such effects by psychic means. The most famous was Uri Geller, who performed on television bending metal spoons, keys, and other objects. Geller&#x27;s performances were revealed to be tricks due to the work of magician and investigator James Randi and others.

Despite hundreds of experiments by parapsychologists to determine whether spoon bending is a genuine psychic phenomenon, spoon bending by psychic powers has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the scientific community.

==History==
Spoon bending was popularized in the 1970s by magician and self-described psychic Uri Geller, who claimed to have paranormal powers and appeared on television performing purportedly psychokinetic feats such as causing spoons, nails, and keys to bend using the power of his mind. Geller&#x27;s actual methods were revealed to be trickery largely due to the work of magician and investigator James Randi. 

While many individuals have claimed the paranormal or psychokinetic ability to bend spoons or manipulate other objects, spoon bending by psychic powers has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the scientific community. Randi offered a prize of one million dollars to any person who was able to demonstrate paranormal abilities, such as spoon bending.

===Scientific testing===
Parapsychologists have conducted hundreds of experiments to determine whether spoon bending is a genuine psychic phenomenon.
Physicist John Hasted believed that children could paranormally bend paper clips inside a glass sphere, provided the sphere had a hole in it and they were allowed to take the sphere into a room unobserved. Science writer and skeptic Martin Gardner wrote that Hasted was incapable of devising simple controls such as videotaping the children secretly. Stephen North, a British psychic, was tested by Hasted in the late 1970s. Hasted claimed North had the psychokinetic ability to bend spoons and teleport objects in and out of sealed containers. According to James Randi, during a test conducted by Hasted at Birkbeck College, North was observed to have bent a metal sample with his bare hands. North was tested in Grenoble on 19 December 1977 in scientific conditions and the results were negative.

Jean-Pierre Girard, a French psychic, has claimed he can bend metal bars by psychokinesis. Girard was tested in the 1970s but failed to produce any paranormal effects in scientifically controlled conditions. He was tested on January 19, 1977 during a two-hour experiment in a Paris laboratory. The experiment was directed by physicist Yves Farge with a magician also present. All of the experiments were negative as Girard failed to make any of the objects move paranormally. He failed two tests in Grenoble in June 1977 with Randi. He was also tested on September 24, 1977 at a laboratory at the Nuclear Research Centre. Girard failed to bend any bars or change the structure of the metals. Other experiments into spoon bending were also negative and witnesses described his feats as fraudulent. Girard later admitted that he would sometimes cheat to avoid disappointing the public but insisted he still had genuine psychic power. Magicians and scientists have written that he produced all his alleged psychokinetic feats through fraudulent means.

Between 1979 and 1981, the McDonnell Laboratory for Psychical Research at Washington University reported a series of experiments they named Project Alpha, in which two teenaged male subjects had demonstrated psychokinesis phenomena, including metal-bending and causing images to appear on film, under less than stringent laboratory conditions. Randi eventually revealed that the subjects were two of his associates, amateur conjurers Steve Shaw and Michael Edwards. The pair had created the effects by standard trickery, but the researchers, being unfamiliar with magic techniques, interpreted them as proof of psychokinesis.

John Taylor had tested children in metal bending. According to Gardner, the controls were inadequate as the children would put paper clips in their pockets and later take one out twisted or be left with metal rods unobserved. Randi managed to bend an aluminum bar when Taylor was not looking and scratch on it &quot;Bent by Randi&quot;. In other experiments, two scientists from the University of Bath examined metal bending with children in a room which was secretly being videotaped through a one-way mirror. The film revealed that the children bent the objects with their hands and feet. Due to the evidence of trickery, Taylor concluded metal bending had no paranormal basis.

In an experimental study (Wiseman and Greening, 2005) two groups of participants were shown a videotape in which a fake psychic placed a bent key on a table. Participants in the first group heard the fake psychic suggest that the key was continuing to bend when it had remained stationary, while those in the second group did not. The results revealed that participants from the first group reported significantly more movement of the key than the second group.
The findings were replicated in another study. The experiments had demonstrated that &quot;testimony for PKMB [psychokinetic metal bending] after effects can be created by verbal suggestion, and therefore the testimony from individuals who have observed allegedly genuine demonstrations of such effects should not be seen as strong evidence in support of the paranormal&quot;.

==Methods==
Stage magicians use several methods of creating the illusion of a spoon bending spontaneously. Most common is the practice of misdirection, an underlying principle of many stage magic tricks; 
the performer draws the audience&#x27;s attention away from the spoon for the brief moment during which the spoon is manually bent. The magician then gradually reveals the bend.
At a 1998 Skeptics Society conference, investigator James Randi showed clips of Geller appearing on the Italian television channel Rai 3 and the BBC programme &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot;, in which he apparently manually bent various metal objects before displaying them to his audience.

When a spoon is physically bent or broken, it is usually at the point where the object would be easiest to bend by hand. The typical bend, where the bowl meets the handle, requires relatively little force. 
Another method uses a metal spoon that has been prepared by repeatedly bending the spoon back and forth, weakening the material. Applying light pressure will then cause it to bend or break. The magician then holds together the two halves of the spoon as if it were unbroken, then slowly relaxes their grip, making the spoon appear to bend before splitting in two.

If a magician has control over the viewing angle, the trick can be done by using a spoon that is already bent at the start of the trick. The spoon is initially held with the bend along the viewing angle, making it invisible. The magician then turns the spoon slowly to reveal the bend. The magician Ben Harris published step-by-step photographs and text showing how to bend keys and cutlery by trick methods.
Some novelty or magic shops sell self-bending spoons (utilizing the physical properties of 
a shape-memory alloy) which can be used by amateur and stage magicians to demonstrate &quot;psychic&quot; powers or as a practical joke. Such &quot;self-bending&quot; spoons will bend themselves when used to stir tea, coffee, or any other warm liquid, or even when warmed by body heat.
Simply holding a spoon by its neck and rapidly whirling it back and forth can also create the illusion that the spoon is bending, due to the way that the human eye perceives the rocking motion.

<text>Heinz Leymann (17 July 1932 – 26 January 1999) was a Swedish academic, famous for his studies on mobbing among humans. He held a degree in pedagogical psychology, and another one in psychiatry and worked as a psychologist. He was a professor at Umeå University.

== Academic background ==
Born in 1932 in Wolfenbüttel, Germany, Leymann, became a Swedish citizen in the mid-1950s, and was awarded his PhD in pedagogical psychology from Stockholm University in 1978. He then went on to get another research doctorate (&quot;doktor i medicinsk vetenskap&quot;, &quot;doctor of medical science,&quot; typically translated into English as PhD) in psychiatry in 1990 from Umeå University. Somewhat unusually, his doctorate in psychiatry was based on his clinical background as a psychologist; he did not go through medical training.

== Leymann&#x27;s work on mobbing ==
Leymann pioneered research into mobbing in the 1980s. His initial research in the area was based on detailed case studies of a number of nurses who had committed or tried to commit suicide due to events at the workplace. He developed the Leymann Inventory of Psychological Terror (LIPT), a questionnaire of 45 mobbing actions.

Although he preferred the term bullying in the context of school children, some have come to regard mobbing as a form of group bullying. As professor and practicing psychologist, Leymann also noted one of the side-effects of mobbing is post-traumatic stress disorder and is frequently misdiagnosed.

Among researchers who have built on Leymann&#x27;s work are: 
* Davenport, Schwartz &amp; Elliott
* Hecker
* Shallcross, Ramsay &amp; Barker
* Westhues
* Zapf &amp; Einarsen

<text>Tolansky is a small, circular lunar impact crater that is located due south of the crater Parry on the Mare Cognitum. The formation is symmetric, with a light-hued outer rim and a darker interior floor. A rille belonging to the Rimae Parry almost connects with the north-northwestern rim of Tolansky.

It was named after British physicist Samuel Tolansky. It was formerly known as Parry A, prior to its current name being approved by the IAU in 1976.

<text>Queen Rocks is a compilation album by the British rock band Queen, released on 3 November 1997.

==Content==
The compilation is unique to the Queen catalogue, as it deliberately does not follow the standard &quot;greatest hits&quot; collection format and focuses on songs from Queen&#x27;s heavier side. Some hits are present (&quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, &quot;I Want It All&quot; and &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;), while other tracks included were never released as singles anywhere (&quot;Put Out the Fire&quot;, &quot;Tear It Up&quot; and &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot;).

The album also contains a remake of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Live With You&quot;, with a much louder and heavier guitar and more aggressive drumming, and one new track, &quot;No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)&quot;, which is a gentle ballad. The latter began life as a track for Brian May&#x27;s solo album &quot;Another World&quot; (1998); the remaining members chose to record it as a bookend for their career as Queen. It was the last original studio recording from the 1990s featuring Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon and is among the few Queen songs not to feature lead singer Freddie Mercury (other examples include &quot;Good Company&quot; and &quot;Sleeping on the Sidewalk&quot;).

<doc id="1074124" wikidata="Q6589581" url="?curid=1074124" title="Vesalius (crater)">
<text>Vesalius is a lunar impact crater that lies on the far side of the Moon, less than 100 kilometers south of the lunar equator. It was named after Flemish anatomist and physician Andreas Vesalius. Just to the northwest is the slightly smaller crater Buisson. Farther to the west-southwest lies the prominent crater Einthoven.

The outer rim of Vesalius is generally circular but somewhat irregular. There is an outward bulge at the southern extremity and a low rim at the northern end. The inner wall displays some slight . On the interior floor the central peak is offset to the north, suggesting that the crater was formed by a low-angle impact.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Vesalius. The name &quot;Eskola&quot; was proposed for Vesalius M crater, and it is shown as such in some publications, but the name was not approved by the IAU.

<text>Catherine Elizabeth Moran ( ; born 5 April 1975) is an English journalist, broadcaster, and author at &quot;The Times&quot;, where she writes two columns a week: one for the Saturday Magazine, and the satirical Friday column &quot;Celebrity Watch&quot;.

Moran was named British Press Awards (BPA) Columnist of the Year for 2010, and both BPA Critic of the Year 2011 and Interviewer of the Year 2011. In 2012, she was named Columnist of the Year by the London Press Club, and Culture Commentator at the Comment Awards in 2013.

==Early life==
Moran was born in Brighton, the eldest of eight children; she has four sisters and three brothers. She has described her father, who is of Irish extraction, as a &quot;psychedelic rock pioneer&quot; drummer who &quot;did session work with many well-known bands in the Sixties&quot; later &quot;confined to the sofa by osteoarthritis&quot;. Moran lived in a three-bedroom council house in Wolverhampton with her parents and siblings, an experience she described as akin to &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;.

Moran attended Springdale Junior School and was then educated at home from the age of 11, having attended Wolverhampton Girls&#x27; High School for only three weeks. She and her siblings received no formal education from their parents; the local council allowed this, as home education is legal in England. Moreover, according to Ms Moran, they were &quot;the only hippies in Wolverhampton&quot;. The children frequently occupied their time with simple games, such as throwing mud at their house. Moran describes her childhood as happy, but revealed she left home as soon as she was able to do so at the age of 18.

==Journalism and writing career==

Throughout her adolescence, Moran was certain that she would pursue a career as a writer. At the age of 13 in October 1988 she won a Dillons young readers&#x27; contest for an essay on &quot;Why I Like Books&quot; and was awarded £250 of book tokens. At the age of 15, she won &quot;The Observer&quot;&#x27;s Young Reporter of the Year. She began her career as a journalist for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, the weekly music publication, at the age of 16. Moran also wrote a novel called &quot;The Chronicles of Narmo&quot; at the age of 16, inspired by having been part of a home-schooled family.

In 1992, she launched her television career, hosting the Channel 4 music show &quot;Naked City&quot;, which ran for two series and featured a number of then up-and-coming British bands such as Blur, Manic Street Preachers and the Boo Radleys.

Moran&#x27;s upbringing inspired her TV drama/comedy series, &quot;Raised by Wolves&quot;, which began airing in the UK on Channel 4 in December 2013.

In July 2012, Moran became a Fellow of the University of Aberystwyth. In April 2014, she was named as one of Britain&#x27;s most influential women in the BBC &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; power list 2014.

Moran&#x27;s semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;How to Build a Girl&quot;, is set in Wolverhampton in the early 1990s. It is the first of a planned trilogy, to be followed by &quot;How to Be Famous&quot;, and concluding with &quot;How To Change The World&quot;. Moran co-wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of the same name alongside John Niven. She also served as an executive producer on the film, directed by Coky Giedroyc, and starring Beanie Feldstein, Alfie Allen, Paddy Considine and Sarah Solemani.

==Feminism==

Moran recalls becoming a feminist after reading &quot;The Female Eunuch&quot; as a child.

In 2011, Ebury Press published Moran&#x27;s book &quot;How to Be a Woman&quot; in the UK, which details her early life including her views on feminism. As of July 2012, it had sold over 400,000 copies in 16 countries. In September 2020 Ebury Press published its sequel, &quot;More Than a Woman&quot;, which explores middle age.

==Twitter==

In August 2013, she organised a 24-hour boycott of Twitter in protest against the organisation&#x27;s perceived failure to deal adequately with offensive content posted, sometimes anonymously, on public figures&#x27; Twitter feeds.

In 2014, her Twitter feed became a controversial addition to the list of English A-Level set texts. In June 2014 the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism reported she was the most influential British journalist on Twitter.

==Personal life==
In December 1999, Moran married &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27; rock critic Peter Paphides in Coventry; they have two daughters, born in 2001 and 2003.

<text>The Salt Lake City and County Building, usually called the &quot;City-County Building&quot;, is the seat of government for Salt Lake City, Utah. The historic landmark formerly housed offices for Salt Lake County government as well, hence the name.

== History ==
The building was originally constructed by free masons between 1891 and 1894 to house offices for the city and county of Salt Lake and replace the Salt Lake City Council Hall and Salt Lake County Courthouse, both erected in the 1860s.

Construction of the building was riddled with controversy. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the City and County Building was the symbol of non-Mormon citizens&#x27; open defiance of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It was designed to rival the Salt Lake Temple as the city&#x27;s architectural centerpiece. It is even thought that the building&#x27;s clock tower and statues were designed to mimic the temple&#x27;s spires and statue of the angel Moroni. Ironically, the building was originally the 1880s brainchild of the Church-backed &quot;People&#x27;s Party.&quot; When the non-Mormon &quot;Liberal Party&quot; was campaigning for city government, they deemed the proposed &quot;joint building&quot; an example of the Church&#x27;s extravagance and wastefulness. In a reversal of stance, the Liberals decided to go ahead with the building when they finally gained power in 1890. Construction began in February on State Street at about 100 South.
For nebulous reasons, construction was halted that November after only the foundation had been laid. The mostly non-Mormon city council questioned the buildings plans which had been completed during the People&#x27;s Party reign, and wavered on how to proceed. The &quot;Deseret News&quot; complained that the Liberals were wasting taxpayer money. Ultimately, the original plans and site for the building were scrapped and the whole project was moved to the building&#x27;s current location at Washington Square. The &quot;Deseret News&quot; claimed this move served the City Council, which owned property around the site and would profit from increased land values. Nonetheless construction on new plans began by late 1891. The cornerstone was laid July 25, 1892. Mormon president Wilford Woodruff&#x27;s journals reported his attendance at the building&#x27;s dedication on Dec, 28 1894.

The architectural firm of Monheim, Bird, and Proudfoot designed the Richardsonian Romanesque building (Olpin et al., 2005). Henry Monheim (a local architect since the 1870s), George Washington Bird (1854-1950; from Wichita, Kansas and William Thomas Proudfoot (1860-1928; also of Wichita) established the firm in 1891 specifically to design the building. Their firm won a building design contest against fourteen other submissions. However, &quot;The Salt Lake Herald&quot;—another LDS-backed paper—claimed that the competition was a &quot;pretentious fraud.&quot; Monheim, a Prussian immigrant, died one year into construction. Bird and Proudfoot moved to Philadelphia and Chicago respectively by 1896, so the City-County Building was their firm&#x27;s only output.

The building was monstrously over budget. Estimated by the firm at $350,000, the winning contractor bid $377,978, but by the building&#x27;s dedication on December 28, 1894, it had cost nearly $900,000. Complicating matters was the Panic of 1893 which cut Salt Lake City and County revenues nearly in half. As a result of this, plans for large stained glass windows for the building were discarded.

Although now used exclusively by Salt Lake City government, the building originally served many functions. Salt Lake County offices called the structure home until the 1980s when the County elected to build a new complex at 2100 South and State Street.

The building served as Utah&#x27;s Capitol from when statehood was granted in 1896 until the present Utah State Capitol was completed in 1915. The Salt Lake City and County building also housed Salt Lake&#x27;s first public library and contained courtrooms, including one that condemned organizer Joe Hill to death amid international attention in 1914.

At the conclusion of a few years of exhaustive renovation and remodeling of the building, and with an eye toward historical accuracy, the building was reopened in 1989. This was done in concert with a seismic upgrade called base isolation that placed the weak sandstone structure on a foundation of steel and rubber to better protect it from earthquake damage.

In March of 2020, the building was shuttered after a 5.7-magnitude earthquake that shook the Wasatch Front. However, thanks to the base isolation invested in decades ago, the repairs needed were minimal. The building was reopened to the public in November of 2021.

== Features ==

The Salt Lake City and County Building&#x27;s central clock tower is topped with a statue of Columbia and rises 256 feet (78 m) from the ground. The building&#x27;s primary axis runs north-south, and large entrances mark each cardinal direction. On the south wing (over the Mayor&#x27;s office) is a bronze statue of the goddess Justice. Originally, the building had statues depicting Commerce, Liberty, Justice, and Columbia, but the others were removed following a 1934 earthquake. Columbia and the other missing statues were replaced on top of the building when it was renovated in 1989.
The building&#x27;s surface is elaborately carved from the gray Utah Kyune sandstone it&#x27;s made of. To the right of the entrance on the south side is the face of Father DeSmet, a Jesuit priest who preached to Native Americans and had contact with the Latter-day Saints before and after they traveled to Utah. To the left is the Spanish conquistador García López de Cárdenas who explored Southern Utah by 1540. Above the granite columns on the east and west sides of the building are carvings of pioneer women. Between the portal and balcony are portraits of Chief Joseph and Chief Wakara and Jim Bridger. Above the west entrance left-to-right are R. N. Baskin, mayor of Salt Lake City in 1892-1895, Jedediah M. Grant, Salt Lake&#x27;s first mayor in 1851-1857, and Jacob B. Blair Salt Lake County&#x27;s probate judge in 1892-1895. The north side features a depiction of the Domínguez–Escalante expedition which entered Utah in 1776 and named many of the state&#x27;s physical features. Gargoyles, eagles, sea monsters, beehives, Masonic icons, suns, and other symbols dot the building&#x27;s rich exterior.

Walter Baird and Oswald Lendi carved most of the building&#x27;s features. Lendi, a French sculptor, whimsically carved his face between the words &quot;City&quot; and &quot;Hall&quot; above the north entrance.

The building has five floors and over one hundred rooms. Onyx lines the hall of each lavishly decorated floor. The third floor houses the mayor&#x27;s office in the south wing and the city council chambers in the north. The council meeting room features an 1865 life-sized portrait of Brigham Young. Portraits of the city&#x27;s past mayors up to and including Ross &quot;Rocky&quot; Anderson line the corridor between these offices. The third floor features an exhibit commemorating the 2002 Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City.

Around the time of the 2002 Salt Lake Olympics, and for a limited time, an electric display depicting the Olympic rings was allowed to be displayed on four sides of the central tower of the City and County building. The Olympic display has since been removed from the building.

== Washington Square ==

The City-County Building sits between State Street, Second East, Fourth South, and Fifth South in Salt Lake City, a block called &quot;Washington Square.&quot; Named for George Washington, the block is the site of the original 1847 Mormon pioneers&#x27; camp in Salt Lake City.

<text>In differential geometry, the Cotton tensor on a (pseudo)-Riemannian manifold of dimension &quot;n&quot; is a third-order tensor concomitant of the metric. The vanishing of the Cotton tensor for is necessary and sufficient condition for the manifold to be locally conformally flat. By contrast, in dimensions ,
the vanishing of the Cotton tensor is necessary but not sufficient for the metric to be conformally flat; instead, the corresponding necessary and sufficient condition in these higher dimensions is the vanishing of the Weyl tensor, while the Cotton tensor just becomes a constant times 
the divergence of the Weyl tensor. For the Cotton tensor is identically zero. The concept is named after Émile Cotton.

The proof of the classical result that for the vanishing of the Cotton tensor is equivalent to the metric being conformally flat is given by Eisenhart using a standard integrability argument. This tensor density is uniquely characterized by its conformal properties coupled with the demand that it be differentiable for arbitrary metrics, as shown by .

Recently, the study of three-dimensional spaces is becoming of great interest, because the Cotton tensor restricts the relation between the Ricci tensor and the energy–momentum tensor of matter in the Einstein equations and plays an important role in the Hamiltonian formalism of general relativity.

== Definition ==

In coordinates, and denoting the Ricci tensor by &quot;R&quot;&quot;ij&quot; and the scalar curvature by &quot;R&quot;, the components of the Cotton tensor are

:formula_1

The Cotton tensor can be regarded as a vector valued 2-form, and for &quot;n&quot; = 3 one can use the Hodge star operator to convert this into a second order trace free tensor density

:formula_2

sometimes called the &quot;Cotton–York tensor&quot;.

==Properties==

===Conformal rescaling===
Under conformal rescaling of the metric formula_3 for some scalar function formula_4. We see that the Christoffel symbols transform as

:formula_5

where formula_6 is the tensor

:formula_7

The Riemann curvature tensor transforms as

:formula_8

In formula_9-dimensional manifolds, we obtain the Ricci tensor by contracting the transformed Riemann tensor to see it transform as

:formula_10

Similarly the Ricci scalar transforms as

:formula_11

Combining all these facts together permits us to conclude the Cotton-York tensor transforms as

:formula_12

or using coordinate independent language as

:formula_13

where the gradient is contracted with the Weyl tensor &quot;W&quot;.

===Symmetries===
The Cotton tensor has the following symmetries:

:formula_14

and therefore

:formula_15

In addition the Bianchi formula for the Weyl tensor can be rewritten as

:formula_16

where formula_17 is the positive divergence in the first component of &quot;W&quot;.

<text>Hurstpierpoint is a village in the Mid Sussex district, in the county of West Sussex, England, southwest of Burgess Hill, and west of Hassocks railway station. It sits in the civil parish of Hurstpierpoint and Sayers Common which has an area of 2029.88 ha and a population of 7,112.

The village was once chiefly one long street running east and west and most of the buildings in it are of the 18th century or later. The late 20th Century and early 21st Century saw Hurstpierpoint expanding greatly with new homes built north, east and west of the village.

Hurstpierpoint hosts the Hurst Festival which takes place every summer and has an active Scouts and Guides Groups.

Established in 1962, the Hurstpierpoint Society is a village organization with over 1,300 members, dedicated to enhancing and safeguarding the village surroundings and examining local planning proposals. 

==Geography==
The village is built on a sandstone ridge, above sea level, running east and west across the parish, on the road from Lewes to Albourne. This is crossed in the centre of the village by Cuckfield Road which goes north to Cuckfield. Hurstpierpoint is located close to the A23.

== History ==
The Hurstpierpoint manor held all the land in a giant parish. Before the Norman Conquest it was owned by Earl Godwin. The settlement was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. After the Conquest, it was held by the de Pierpoints for many centuries.

There were twin Parks at Hurstpierpoint through the later Middle Ages, Little Park north of the Greensand ridge and Danny, or Great Park () to its south. Danny Park was made by enclosing existing woodland in the early 13th century. It remained a special place right up until the 1970s, particularly for its many ancient elms, which formed an avenue northwards from the house.

The name &quot;Hurstpierpoint&quot; derives from two sources. The first source is &#x27;Hurst&#x27;, the Saxon name for a wooded hill. The hill woodland is likely to have been on the shadier, northern side of the greensand ridge, for the sunny south side is partially on the Lower Greensand which is an area that early farmers would have settled for the fertile ground, for example at Wanbarrow, Washbrooks, Tott Farm and Bedlam Street. The second source is de Pierpoint family who were early owners of the property. Throughout the centuries there have been several variants on the Hurstpierpoint name e.g. Herst (11th century); Herstperpunt (14th century); Perpondesherst (15th century).

In 1971 the civil parish had a population of 5355. On 1 April 2000 the parish was abolished to form &quot;Hurstpierpoint and Sayers Common&quot;, part also went to Albourne and Burgess Hill.

== Notable buildings and areas ==

The greensand ridge from Hurstpierpoint to Ditchling, is tracked by both the modern B2116 road, and the Roman Greensand Way whose camber is still visible at Randolphs Farm () and at Danny&#x27;s Sandy Field ().

Despite being sandwiched between Hassocks and the ever growing Burgess Hill to the east and the London to Brighton A23 road to the west, Hurstpierpoint is in an attractive setting. To the south are the South Downs and the impressive Wolstonbury Hill. Between the village and the Hill is Danny Park and the Danny Woods. To the north of Hurstpierpoint is a waterland geography which is centred around the Herrings Stream.

There are five churches in the village which are St George&#x27;s (not in use), Hurstpierpoint Methodist Church, Hurstpierpoint Good News Church and St Luke&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, which was closed in December 2019 and the Holy Trinity parish church.

=== Holy Trinity ===

The parish church was a Norman church, but was largely rebuilt from the designs of Sir Charles Barry in 1843–5, who was famous for designing the Houses of Parliament. In 1854, the north chapel was added, in 1874 the south chapel and the north transept has been fitted up as a chapel in memory of those who died in the War of 1914–18. A number of funeral monuments and fittings were preserved from the old church. The font is probably from the 13th century, but the heavy round bowl has been reworked and painted. In the east window of the south chapel are set fifteen medallions of German or Flemish glass of the 16th and 17th centuries. In the south chapel is a much weathered recumbent effigy from 1260 of a cross-legged knight in chain armour, and at the west end of the north aisle is a much mutilated effigy of a knight from 1340. In the churchyard by the west wall are five tapering coffin lids from the 12th or 13th century, with hollow chamfered edges. One shows faint traces of a raised cross. The pavement outside the west doorway has about 150 inlaid slip tiles from the late 13th or early 14th century, which are suffering from wear.

===Danny House===
Danny House () is an extravagant Elizabethan building. It is built of warm brick with a sunny Queen Anne south face and an E-faced eastern front with mullioned stone windows rising to the full height of the building and flooding the Great Hall behind in morning light.

Elms once lined the drive to the House, but are now gone as a result of Dutch elm disease.

Danny Lake and Pondtail Wood () that embraces it have been restored in recent times. The wood has bluebells, anemones and primroses.

===Herrings Stream===

The Herrings Stream is a tributary of the eastern River Adur and runs to the north of Hurstpierpoint. Walking from Cobb&#x27;s Mill () east to Eylesford Bridge (on the A273) reveals wetlands that passes many bridges and lost fordings including Cobbsmill Bridge, Gold Bridge (as in marsh marigold, kingcups), Stalker Bridge, Danworthbrook Bridge, Ruckford and Eylesford Bridge. A kilometre from Cobb&#x27;s Mill to Stalker Bridge (where the Cuckfield Road crosses) you can walk alongside the running mill leat, with its sticklebacks, emperor dragonflies, grey wagtails, banded demoiselles and house martins. Upstream of Ruckford and Hammond&#x27;s Mills the leats no longer function, but can still be made out.

East of Ruckford Mill there is a wooded lily pond () with clear water and much hornwort and curled pondweed. Between Ruckford Mill and Locks Manor are two well managed archaic flower meadows, e.g. (). Between Danworth and Kent&#x27;s Farms the river meanders, and in some places little brook meadows survive. At other points they have been incorporated into larger fields.

=== Local woods ===

On the northeastern edge of Hurstpierpoint there are still two ancient woods. Tilley&#x27;s Copse () is a bluebell wood, with crab apple, wych elm, gean, midland thorn and hornbeam. The Wilderness, just to the south (), is a damper place.

On the Gault Clay, south of Hurstpierpoint and Hassocks, are a cluster of ancient woods centred on the Elizabethan mansion of Danny, which have mostly escaped coniferisation and heavy recreational damage. They are damp places, with lovely spring wildflower displays.

Stalkers (), Randolph&#x27;s Copse () and Foxhole Shaw () are rich and interesting at all times of year. Twenty ancient woodland flowers have been counted in Randolph&#x27;s Copse, including lesser butterfly and early purple orchids, ransoms and guelder rose. There is also ragged robin and betony. White admiral and silver-washed fritillary butterflies have been recorded here. There can be orange waxcaps on the narrowing rides of Foxhole Shaw.

Old Wood (), next to Danny, has been damaged by the whims of past big house owners, with heavy planting of non-local species, including lots of horse chestnut and both large leaved and common lime. The Gill () is a coppiced ash wood east of New Way Lane.

== Education ==
St Lawrence Church of England Primary School is located close to the centre of the village and is for children 4 to 11 years of age. Also located in the village is the public school, Hurstpierpoint College, to be found to the north-east of the village, and the pre-school, next to the Primary School, for children 2 to 5 years of age.

== St Lawrence Fair ==
Every July the St Lawrence Fair takes place in Hurstpierpoint. The fair was granted a royal charter in 1313 and is still an important event in the life of the village. The fair takes place on the first Saturday in July and begins with a procession of floats through the high street. These are made by groups such as playschools, primary schools, scouts and brownies and have a different theme each year. Other popular events of the day are the family fun run and the tug-o-war where the local pubs battle it out for a barrel of beer. In 2007 and 2008 it was won by the White Horse of Albourne Road. The fair is home to Harris fun fair and usually has a chair-o-plane amongst its rides as well as different stalls such as a coconut shy. Charities and businesses from around the area place stalls, tombolas and raffles around the centre, and on the other side is the beer tent and pig roast.

== Sport ==
Hurstpierpoint is the home of Hurstpierpoint F.C., who play in the Mid Sussex Football League. The club was formed in 1886, originally playing in the grounds of Danny House. The side is known for signing Premier League record appearance holder and former Aston Villa, Manchester City, Everton and West Bromwich Albion defensive midfielder Gareth Barry in July 2024.

Hurstpierpoint Colts FC is an FA Affiliated youth football club. The club plays in the Horsham &amp; District Youth Football League and Crawley &amp; District Youth Football League. Youth matches are played at various venues: Fairfield Recreation Ground, Court Bushes Football Fields and Berrylands Playing Fields.

==Notable people==
James Hannington (1847–1885), Anglican missionary and martyr, was born here and served as curate-in-charge at St George&#x27;s, Hurstpierpoint. He was the first Anglican bishop of East Africa.

A notable local resident was Jimmy Hill, former &quot;Match of the Day&quot; presenter and football player, manager and chairman, who was generous of his time for local events, clubs and societies until his death on 19 December 2015 aged 87. Greta Scacchi also lived in the village until 2011 when a dispute with a neighbour led her to leave. The agricultural chemist Sir John Saint (1898–1987) lived at Selwyn in St George&#x27;s Lane. The Olympic runner Frank Salvat also lived there until his death in 2013, and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion winger Kazenga LuaLua lived in the village. Likewise, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion centre back and captain Lewis Dunk has lived in Hurstpierpoint since 2016. The village was home to the geologist and authority on mollusca Robert Ashington Bullen (1850–1912) for a period. William Walcot RE (1874–1943), architect, graphic artist and etcher, notable as a practitioner of refined Art Nouveau in Moscow, committed suicide at Hurstpierpoint.

Haydn Gwynne was born on 21 March 1957 in Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, to Rosamond (née Dobson) and Guy Thomas Haydn Gwynne (1915–1994).[1]

Stand-up comedian and presenter Glenn Moore grew up in the village. Journalist Emily Morgan lived in the village.

<text>Philip Reeve (born 28 February 1966) is an English author and illustrator of children&#x27;s books, primarily known for the 2001 book &quot;Mortal Engines&quot; and its sequels (the 2001 to 2006 &quot;Mortal Engines Quartet&quot;). His 2007 novel, &quot;Here Lies Arthur&quot;, based on the legendary King Arthur, won the Carnegie Medal.

==Biography==
Born on 28 February 1966 in Brighton, Reeve studied illustration, first at Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology (CCAT – now Anglia Ruskin University), where he contributed a comic strip to the Student Union magazine, and later at Brighton Polytechnic (now the University of Brighton). Before becoming an illustrator he worked at a bookshop in Brighton for several years. During his student years and for a few years afterwards he wrote for and performed in comedy sketch shows with a variety of collaborators under various group names, among them The Charles Atlas Sisters. He lives on Dartmoor with his wife Sarah and their son Sam.

With Brian Mitchell, Reeve is the author of a 1998 dystopian comic musical, &quot;The Ministry of Biscuits&quot;. &quot;Stop! Think before you eat that biscuit! Is it in any way fancy? If so, then you are a criminal! In Post-War London, The Ministry of Biscuits casts its sinister shadow over every tea-time and elevenses in the land. Established to &#x27;control biscuits, and to control the idea of biscuits&#x27;, it prohibits decadent sweetmeats, such as the Gypsy Cream.&quot; This was performed at the Pavilion Theatre, Brighton, the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford, and the 1999 Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It underwent a revival in 2005 at the Sallis Benney Theatre, Brighton, and began playing at Brighton&#x27;s Lantern Theatre in November 2017. It has also toured to various other locations throughout the United Kingdom.

Reeve provided cartoons for books, including those in the &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; and &quot;Murderous Maths&quot; series. He wrote the Buster Bayliss series of books for young readers, which includes &quot;Night of the Living Veg&quot;, &quot;The Big Freeze&quot;, &quot;Day of the Hamster&quot;, and &quot;Custardfinger&quot;. He is the author and illustrator of a Dead Famous non-fiction book: &quot;Horatio Nelson and His Victory&quot;.

Reeve&#x27;s first book for older readers was &quot;Mortal Engines&quot;, which won the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize in age category 9–11 years and made the Whitbread Book Award shortlist. &quot;Mortal Engines&quot; is the first book in a series sometimes called the &quot;Mortal Engines Quartet&quot; (2001–2006), which includes &quot;Predator&#x27;s Gold&quot;, &quot;Infernal Devices&quot; and &quot;A Darkling Plain&quot;. The books feature two young adventurers, Tom Natsworthy and Hester Shaw, living in a lawless post-apocalyptic world inhabited by moving cities. For the fourth volume, Reeve won the once-in-a-lifetime 2006 Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize, judged by a panel of British children&#x27;s writers.

Reeve spent more than ten years on &quot;Mortal Engines&quot;, coming up with ideas in 1989 or 1990, leading to publication in 2001. He was working on it part-time between illustration jobs, but as he became sure he could complete such a project, he cut down his illustration work and devoted more time to writing.

The 2007 novel &quot;Here Lies Arthur&quot; is an alternative version of the Arthurian legend. Reeve and &quot;Arthur&quot; won the annual Carnegie Medal from the British librarians, recognizing the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book published in the UK.

The &quot;Larklight&quot; trilogy (2006–2008) is steampunk set in outer space. The first book &quot;Larklight&quot; was being developed as a film by the Indian director Shekhar Kapur, but he is no longer involved. Reeve professes that when planning out a novel, &quot;I see it as a film that I run in my head, and I just keep running alternative versions of it until I come up with a cut I like. The future of the film is now in the hands of the Swedish director Tomas Alfredson.

Reeve began a series of &quot;Mortal Engines&quot; prequels with &quot;Fever Crumb&quot; (Scholastic UK, 2009). The first was one of eight finalists for the 2010 Carnegie Medal. In March 2020 Reeve said he did not intend to finish or publish a fourth book in the Fever Crumb series, as too much time had passed, thereby forgoing the world of &quot;Mortal Engines&quot;.

In 2013, Reeve had his first co-authored, highly illustrated book with British-American writer-illustrator Sarah McIntyre published by Oxford University Press: &quot;Oliver and the Seawigs&quot;. This went on to win the UKLA Award. Their third book, &quot;Pugs of the Frozen North&quot;, won an Independent Bookshop Week children&#x27;s book award. The pair have a contract with the same publisher for a series of four more books, beginning with &quot;The Legend of Kevin&quot;.

In 2018, Reeve praised the 2018 &quot;Mortal Engines&quot; film adaptation, saying the director, Christian Rivers, had &quot;done a fantastic job – a huge, visually awesome action movie with perfect pace and a genuine emotional core... There are many changes to the characters, world, and story, but it&#x27;s still fundamentally the same thing.&quot; In the &quot;Reevening&quot; in March 2020, he acknowledged the film&#x27;s shortcomings, but thoughts of the filmmakers liking the books led him to welcome the US-New Zealand two-hour film co-production as the best &quot;you could hope for [in your lifetime]&quot;. On November 18, 2020, upon asked whether &quot;Mortal Engines&quot; would be rebooted for the television screens, he responded that, while that would be nice, it seemed unlikely.

==Writing methods==
Reeve claims not to be a methodical writer. He plans nothing at all, usually starting with an opening image, a closing image, and a few vague notions for the things that happen in between. This leads to thousands of words of rough draft material being abandoned – even entire novels, such as with &quot;Fever Crumb&quot; and &quot;Mortal Engines&quot;. However, he takes ideas from these abandoned drafts to build the final version. It usually takes him a year to move a novel from first idea to publication – six months actively writing it, the rest editing and thinking.

<text>Hermione Ferdinanda Gingold (; 9 December 189724 May 1987) was an English actress known for her sharp-tongued, eccentric character. Her signature drawling, deep voice was a result of nodules on her vocal cords she developed in the 1920s and early 1930s.

After success as a child actress, she established a stage career spanning comedy, drama, experimental theatre, and radio broadcasting. Finding her milieu in revue, she played from the 1930s to the 1950s, co-starring several times with the English actress Hermione Baddeley. Later she played formidable elders in the film and stage musicals &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958), &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot; (1958), &quot;The Music Man&quot; (1962), and &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; (1977).

From the early 1950s, Gingold lived and made her career mostly in the U.S. Her American stage work ranged from &quot;John Murray Anderson&#x27;s Almanac&quot; (1953) to &quot;Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma&#x27;s Hung You in the Closet and I&#x27;m Feelin&#x27; So Sad&quot; (1963), the latter of which she played in London. She became a well-known guest on television talk shows. She made appearances in revues and toured in plays and musicals until an accident ended her performing career in 1977.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Hermione Ferdinanda Gingold was born in Carlton Hill, Maida Vale, London, the elder daughter of a prosperous Austrian-born Jewish stockbroker, James Gingold, and his wife, Kate Frances (née Walter). Her paternal grandparents were the Ottoman-born British subject, Moritz &quot;Maurice&quot; Gingold, a London stockbroker, and his Austrian-born wife, Hermine, after whom Hermione was named (Gingold mentions in her autobiography that her mother might have got &#x27;Hermione&#x27; from Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, which she was reading shortly before her birth). On her father&#x27;s side, she was descended from Solomon Sulzer, a synagogue cantor and Jewish liturgical composer in Vienna. James felt that religion was something children needed to decide on for themselves, and Gingold grew up with no particular religious beliefs.

Gingold&#x27;s professional début was in 1908 when she had just turned 11. She played the herald in Herbert Beerbohm Tree&#x27;s production of &quot;Pinkie and the Fairies&quot; by W. Graham Robertson, in a cast including Ellen Terry, Frederick Volpe, Marie Löhr and Viola Tree. She was promoted to the leading role of Pinkie for a provincial tour. Tree cast her as Falstaff&#x27;s page, Robin, in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;. She attended Rosina Filippi&#x27;s stage school in London. In 1911, she was cast in the original production of &quot;Where the Rainbow Ends&quot; which opened to very good reviews on 21 December 1911.

On 10 December 1912, the day after her 15th birthday, Gingold played Cassandra in William Poel&#x27;s production of &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; at the King&#x27;s Hall, Covent Garden, with Esmé Percy as Troilus and Edith Evans as Cressida. The following year she appeared in a musical production, &quot;The Marriage Market&quot;, in a small role in a cast that included Tom Walls, W H Berry, and Gertie Millar. In 1914, she played Jessica in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; at The Old Vic. In 1918, Gingold married the publisher Michael Joseph, with whom she had two sons, the younger of whom, Stephen, became a pioneer of theatre in the round in Britain.

===1920 to 1948===
Gingold&#x27;s adult stage career was slow to take off. She played Liza in &quot;If&quot; at the Ambassador&#x27;s in May 1921, and the Old Woman in Ben Travers&#x27;s farcical comedy &quot;The Dippers&quot; produced by Sir Charles Hawtrey at the Criterion in August 1922.

In 1926 Gingold was divorced from Joseph. Later in the same year she married the writer and lyricist Eric Maschwitz, whom she divorced in 1945. She underwent a vocal crisis in the late 1920s and early 1930s: she had hitherto described herself as &quot;Shakespearian and soprano&quot; but nodules on her vocal cords brought a drastic drop in pitch, about which she commented, &quot;One morning it was Mozart and the next &#x27;Old Man River&#x27;&quot;. The critic J. C. Trewin described her voice as &quot;powdered glass in deep syrup&quot;. During this period she broadcast frequently for the BBC and established herself at the experimental theatre-club the Gate Theatre Studio in London, first as a serious actress and later in the genre for which she became famous, revue. According to &quot;The Times&quot; it was in &quot;Spread It Abroad&quot; (1936) a revue at another theatre, the Saville, with material by Herbert Farjeon that she found her milieu.

In the 10 years from 1938, Gingold concentrated on revues, appearing in nine productions in the West End. The first four were &quot;The Gate Revue&quot; (transferred from the Gate to the Ambassadors, 1939), &quot;Swinging the Gate&quot; (1940), &quot;Rise Above It&quot; (1941) and &quot;Sky High&quot; (1942). During this period, she and Hermione Baddeley established a stage partnership that &quot;The Times&quot; called &quot;briskly sustained mock-rivalry&quot;. Their names were often linked for this reason, although they only ever appeared in three shows together. In June 1943, she opened in a &quot;Sweet and Low&quot;, which was revised and refreshed over a run of almost six years, first as &quot;Sweeter and Lower&quot; and then &quot;Sweetest and Lowest&quot;. In her sketches, she tended, as Alan Melville recalled, to portray &quot;grotesque and usually unfortunate ladies of dubious age and occasionally, morals; the unhappy female painted by Picasso who found herself lumbered with an extra limb or two … the even less fortunate female who, after years of playing the cello in Palm Court orchestras, ended up bow-legged beyond belief&quot;. In a biographical sketch, Ned Sherrin wrote &quot;Gingold became a special attraction for American soldiers and &#x27;Thanks, Yanks&#x27; was one of her most appropriate numbers. During the astringent, name-dropping &#x27;Sweet&#x27; series, she played 1,676 performances, before 800,000 people, negotiating 17,010 costume changes&quot;.

===Postwar===

Gingold&#x27;s first new revue after the war was &quot;Slings and Arrows&quot; at the Comedy in 1948. She was praised, but the material was judged inferior to that of her earlier shows.

Gingold and Baddeley co-starred in a Noël Coward double bill in November 1949, presenting &quot;Fumed Oak&quot; and &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;. Reviews were poor, and Coward thought the performances crude and overdone, but the production was a box-office success, running until August the following year. She cited working in interior decoration and collecting china as her hobbies in 1951.
She appeared in cameo roles in British films, of which Sherrin singles out &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; (1952), in which she played the formidable schoolmistress, Miss Tompkins. Gingold became well known to BBC radio audiences in &quot;Mrs Doom&#x27;s Diary&quot; in the weekly show &quot;Home at Eight&quot;; this was a parody of the radio soap opera &quot;Mrs Dale&#x27;s Diary&quot; in the manner of the Addams Family with Gingold as Drusilla Doom and Alfred Marks as her sepulchral husband.

Between 1951 and 1969 Gingold worked mostly in the US. Her first engagement there was at the Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts in &quot;It&#x27;s About Time,&quot; a revue that incorporated some of her London material. In December 1953, she opened in &quot;John Murray Anderson&#x27;s Almanac&quot; which made her an instant Broadway success and for which she won the Donaldson Award in 1954. She also became a regular guest on talk shows. Her jazz cabaret album &quot;la gingold&quot;, with musical direction by Buster Davis, was released in 1956.

She continued making films, playing a London &quot;sporting lady&quot; in &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956), and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the 1958 film &quot;Gigi&quot;. In the film, she sang &quot;I Remember It Well&quot; with Maurice Chevalier. She said &quot;It was my first American film, and I was very nervous.&quot; Chevalier put her at ease. &quot;I had to sing, and I hadn&#x27;t got a great voice, but with him, I felt the greatest prima donna in the world.&quot; Gingold followed this with another hit film &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot;, also 1958. She played the haughty Eulalie Mackecknie Shinn in &quot;The Music Man&quot; (1962), starring Robert Preston and Shirley Jones.

In October 1963, Gingold opened in Arthur Kopit&#x27;s &quot;Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma&#x27;s Hung You in the Closet and I&#x27;m Feelin&#x27; So Sad&quot;, playing a monstrously possessive mother driving her son crazy. She played the role in the London production in 1965. Reviewing the latter, and noting that the first night had been greeted with cheering at the end, the critic Philip Hope-Wallace wrote:

===Last years===

In 1969, she co-starred in &quot;Winter of the Witch&quot;, a film made for the Learning Corporation of America. It was based on Wende and Harry Devlin&#x27;s &quot;Old Black Witch!&quot; picturebook. The film is narrated by Burgess Meredith. Gingold played a gloomy, bad witch who becomes a good witch when a young boy and his mother move into her house. She cooks magic pancakes that make people happy and the three of them turn their living room into a successful pancake parlor. The witch tells the boy that she became good because people are already scared nowadays, and that she will go on being good until everyone is happy and they need her to scare them again.

In 1972, she was among the guests in David Winters&#x27; musical television special &quot;The Special London Bridge Special&quot;, starring Tom Jones, and Jennifer O&#x27;Neill.

Gingold was a member of the original 1973 Broadway cast of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; in the role of the elderly Mme. Armfeldt. Clive Barnes wrote &quot;Hermione Gingold is immeasurably grande dame as the almost Proustian hostess (I haven&#x27;t loved her so much since she sang about the Borgia orgies 30 years ago).&quot; When the production transferred to London in 1975, Gingold reprised the role, and later played it in the film version of the musical (1977).

At the age of 77, Gingold made her operatic début, joining the San Francisco Opera to play the spoken role of the Duchess of Crackenthorp in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;La fille du régiment&quot; in 1975. In 1977, she took over the narrator&#x27;s role in &quot;Side by Side by Sondheim&quot; on Broadway. After the New York run, the show toured the U.S. In Kansas City, Gingold suffered an accident that broke her knee and dislocated her arm; these injuries brought her performing career to an end. Still, she appeared in a 1980s Goya commercial for its drink Coca Goya Colada, shaking the two cans like maracas.

===Death===
Gingold died from heart problems and pneumonia at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan on 24 May 1987, aged 89. She is interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

==Legacy==
Gingold&#x27;s autobiography &quot;How to Grow Old Disgracefully&quot; was posthumously compiled in 1988. During her lifetime Gingold published three books of memoir and anecdotes: 
* &quot;The World Is Square&quot; (1946)
* &quot;My Own Unaided Work&quot; (1952)
* &quot;Sirens Should Be Seen and Not Heard&quot; (1963)

She wrote the play &quot;Abracadabra&quot; and contributed original material to the many revues in which she performed.

Gingold Theatrical Group in New York is named in her honor. Founded by David Staller in 2006, the company promotes the humanitarian ideals of activist playwright George Bernard Shaw.

<text>The World Triathlon Corporation (WTC) is a sports event promotion company owned by conglomerate Advance Publications, that produces the Ironman Triathlon, Ironman 70.3, the 5150 series of triathlon races, and other sports events.

== History ==
In December, 1989, Dr. James P. Gills and David Voth acquired and purchased the Hawaii Triathlon Corporation, owner of the Ironman Brand, for $3 million from Valerie Silk. Voth was the CEO from 1989 to 1993 followed by David Yates then Lew Friedland in the CEO role. With the Ironman brand, Gills and Voth established the World Triathlon Corporation with the intention of furthering the sport of triathlon and building a multi media and global brand presence. By increasing prize money for both male and female triathletes and developing the Ironman World Series including new associated and licensed IronMan races, IronMan was launched into the mainstream of sports. Ben Fertic, formerly Vice President of Information Systems, joined WTC in 2000 and was involved in the business operations and day-to-day decision making for WTC. Fertic became CEO of WTC in 2004.

During Fertic&#x27;s tenure as VP, he created Ironman Live, an online presence of Ironman Triathlon, and transformed WTC into an event production company. In 2007, WTC undertook expansion in producing Ironman events internally, with the inaugural Ironman Louisville. This followed the launch of Ironman 70.3 events in Boise, Idaho, and Providence, Rhode Island.

In 2008, World Triathlon Corporation was purchased by Providence Equity Securities for $85 million. Providence Equity is a private equity firm, of whom one board member is an Ironman athlete. CEO Ben Fertic remained at the helm of the business. The following year, in early in 2009, WTC announced the acquisition of Ironman events based in the United States, from North America Sports, a company founded by Canadian Graham Fraser. Employees from North America Sports were expected to remain and manage these events, which included Ironman Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Lake Placid, Wisconsin, Florida, Arizona, Ironman 70.3 California, and Ironman 70.3 Florida.

On May 31, 2011, WTC announced that Andrew Messick, who was previously the president AEG, would become CEO of the World Triathlon Corporation. Fertic would continue in his role in serving on the Board of Directors as well as serving in a newly created president position. Messick, who is an Ironman triathlon finisher himself, helped build and direct, among other things, the Tour of California cycling event.

===Dalian Wanda Group (2015–2020)===
In Fall 2015, World Triathlon Corporation and the Ironman brand were acquired by Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group. Wanda Group reached an agreement to purchase 100% of equity for $650 million and the assumption of debt from former owners Providence Equity Partners. Ironman had been in the hands of Providence for seven successful years after they purchased it in 2008. A source for the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; estimated that the WTC is valued at roughly $900 million and represents a quadrupling of Providence&#x27;s investment in the WTC.

A Wanda Group press release stated that the World Triathlon Corporation&#x27;s gross revenue has risen at a compounded average growth rate of 40% for four years straight. Net profit has grown at 40% a year. Wanda Group has announced plans to bring Ironman races to China in the future, citing the events have been hosted in over 20 countries worldwide but none yet in China. This was inspired by the success of other Ironman races in Asia, like those in Taiwan, Korea, and Japan.

Dalian Wanda acquired Competitor Group (operator of the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Marathon Series) in 2017; it became a subsidiary of the Ironman Group.

===Advance (2020–)===
On March 26, 2020, Advance Publications announced that it would acquire The Ironman group from the Dalian Wanda Group, with Orkila as a co-investor in the company. As part of the deal, Wanda would operate the events in China under a license agreement. On July 21, 2020, the sale was completed.

==Event acquisitions==
In addition to the North American Sports acquisition in 2009 WTC has acquired several other event management companies and races.

In February 2012 WTC purchased USM Events, owners of Australian triathlons in Geelong, Mooloolaba, and Noosa, as well as the Sydney World Triathlon Series (WTS) race. USM Events also owned and produced a full Ironman distance race in Cairns, Australia called Challenge Cairns. Challenge, a rival to the Ironman brand, did not wish to have WTC running one of the Challenge family of races. As a result, Challenge terminated its contract with USM and Challenge Cairns subsequently became Ironman Cairns. The purchase of USM Events expands WTC&#x27;s Asia-Pacific triathlon market. The purchase would have placed WTC into International Triathlon Union racing with the Sydney WTS race, but government officials in New South Wales took the option of not extending an agreement to continue staging the Sydney event due to the ongoing logistical and financial investment required.

In June 2013, WTC purchased YWC Sports, a private company that organizes triathlons and endurance sport events in Denmark. YWC Sports was contracted by the Challenge Family to produce the long-distance triathlon races Challenge Copenhagen and Challenge Aarhus. However, Challenge Family CEO Felix Walchshöfer did not wish to have WTC produce a Challenge licensed event and therefore terminated YWC&#x27;s agreement stating that the sale to WTC constituted a breach of contract. As a result, the Challenge Copenhagen race, which was scheduled to race in August 2013, would be rebranded as Ironman Copenhagen and 50 qualifying spots would be offered up for the 2013 Ironman World Championships. Challenge Aarhus was replaced by Ironman 70.3 Aarhus and debuted in June 2014.

In January 2016 WTC acquired Lagardère Group&#x27;s endurance sports division. Lagardère was owners of ITU World Triathlon Series races in Hamburg, Abu Dhabi, Kapstadt, Leeds, and Stockholm. The acquisition also greatly expanded WTC&#x27;s portfolio beyond triathlon adding several cycling events like Cyclassics Hamburg, Velothon Berlin, Velothon Wales, Velothon Copenhagen, Velothon Stockholm, Velothon Stuttgart as well as several running events like the Hamburg Marathon, Hawkes Bay International Marathon, Marathon de Bordeaux, Queenstown Marathon, Music Runs in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Sweden and South Africa and several multisport events.

==Event and product licensing==
WTC holds the rights to use the name &quot;Ironman&quot; for marketing purposes in association with contests consisting of swimming, biking, and running; which is used to license triathlon events around the world. This part is part of the licensing agreement both Marvel and WTC to not use the &quot;Iron Man&quot; and &quot;Ironman&quot; trademarks in ways that would suggest an association with the other or cause brand confusion. The first events to take on Ironman licensing include events in Canada, New Zealand and Australia, all of which formed in the 1980s. Since then, Ironman event licensing has gone global, with the creation of the Ironman 70.3 series in 2005 and the 5150 series beginning in 2011.

The WTC licenses the Ironman and Ironman Triathlon logo and other related marks to various corporations for use in their product lines. An example is the licensing to Timex Group USA of the Ironman Triathlon logo for use in the Timex Ironman watch line that includes the Timex Ironman Datalink series of GPS type watches.

==Former business ventures==

===&quot;LAVA&quot; magazine===
In March 2010, World Triathlon Corporation announced the start of a triathlon publication called &quot;LAVA&quot; magazine. At its conception, the magazine was published by John Duke, former publisher of &quot;Triathlete Magazine&quot; and then Vice President of Global Sales and Media for WTC. &quot;LAVA&quot; built its initial subscription base from United States athletes who had entered in an Ironman branded event in 2010. The magazine produces 9 issues per year. The &quot;Lava&quot; name is in reference to the Hawaiian Island that the Ironman Championship is held on each year.

The magazine was started under former World Triathlon Corporation CEO Ben Fertic. Under CEO Andrew Messick, WTC sought to focus solely on the Ironman brand of races and move away from publishing. In May 2012, WTC sold &quot;LAVA&quot; to a group of investors that included &quot;LAVA&quot; publisher John Duke, Active.com&#x27;s CEO Dave Alberga and president Matt Landa, as well as former hedge fund manager Matthew Michelsen. Additionally, as part of the sale, Heather Gordon became the new publisher. The sale also coincided with the end of a two-year ban that prevented &quot;LAVA&quot; from being sold on the newsstand for two years. That ban was the result of a dispute and settlement between Duke&#x27;s previous employer &quot;Triathlete Magazine&quot;, its parent Competitor Group, Inc., and WTC. After the sale &quot;LAVA&quot; will receive a preferred relationship with WTC as the official publication of Ironman, which will grant the magazine unique access to Ironman consumers.

===Ironman Access===
On October 27, 2010, World Triathlon Corporation put out a press release announcing the creation of an athlete membership program called Ironman Access. This program was to offer advanced registration to its Ironman events before entries would be open for registration to the general public. Advance race registration for members of Ironman Access would be open one week prior to the event&#x27;s general entry registration date. Members of this program would also receive a number of other benefits, such as a free subscription to its &quot;LAVA&quot; magazine and discounts at its shopironman.com website. The cost of membership into the Ironman Access program was US$1,000. However, a day later, in response to comments the WTC received via email and from comments received through Facebook, Ben Fertic, then CEO of WTC, appeared in an online video announcing that Ironman Access program would be rescinded, stating: &quot;If you guys think we&#x27;re wrong, we&#x27;re wrong.&quot;
 As explained in the video by Fertic, the purpose of the program was to free up 2,500 to 3,000 entry slots that go unused by individuals who sign up for multiple Ironman events.

<doc id="1074167" wikidata="Q4731537" url="?curid=1074167" title="Allen Bestwick">
<text>Allen Bestwick (born September 24, 1961) is an American sportscaster. Known for his work covering NASCAR for NBC and ESPN, he is the lead track announcer at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and lead broadcaster for the Superstar Racing Experience racing series. He is the lead play-by-play voice for University of Connecticut women&#x27;s basketball telecasts for SNY.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Bestwick was born in Newport, Rhode Island. His broadcasting career began at the age of 15, when he did on-air work for his high school radio station in Coventry, Rhode Island. Bestwick began announcing auto racing at age 16, when he called the action at Seekonk Speedway, where his father raced.

He then was hired by Charlie Roberts, founder of MotorNet in New Jersey, to be the radio network&#x27;s Director of Affiliates and Associate Producer.

In 1985, Bestwick joined Motor Racing Network (MRN) as a race reporter and eventually became co-lead announcer with Joe Moore and Barney Hall. While still employed at MRN, Bestwick took over for Ken Squier as TBS&#x27; lead NASCAR commentator for its abbreviated schedule.

===NBC Sports and Turner Sports===
Bestwick joined NBC in 1999 as its lap-by-lap commentator for its lone race, the Pennzoil 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. When NBC acquired rights to the second half of the NASCAR season, Bestwick was joined by Benny Parsons and Wally Dallenbach Jr. as the network&#x27;s full-time broadcast team. Bestwick also continued to work for Turner Sports, as TNT served as NBC&#x27;s broadcast partner on cable.

In 2005, Bestwick and Bill Weber switched positions on the broadcast. Bestwick took Weber&#x27;s position as lead pit reporter while Weber, who had substituted for Bestwick for two races in 2004 as he recuperated from a broken leg, moved to the booth. Bestwick substituted for Weber from 2005 to 2006 at Standalone Busch Series races.

Also in 2005, Bestwick made a cameo appearance as himself, being the lead announcer, in the movie &quot;&quot;. During his tenure at NBC, Bestwick also called Arena football games, as well as other minor duties.

After NBC lost rights to NASCAR following the 2006 season, Bestwick decided to leave the network after seven years. Despite TNT retaining its NASCAR rights in the new contract that was signed, Bestwick opted not to stay with them and instead signed on with ESPN.

===ESPN===
For 2007, Bestwick joined the &quot;NASCAR on ESPN&quot; package as lead pit reporter, as well as occasionally being race coverage host and play-by-play announcer on Nationwide Series races, and occasional &quot;NASCAR Now&quot; hosting duties. In 2008, he was moved up to full-time race coverage host and hosts a weekly Monday roundtable edition of &quot;NASCAR Now&quot;. As lead pit reporter, from 2008 to 2010, he also hosted &quot;NASCAR Countdown&quot;.

On July 20, 2011, it was announced that Bestwick would replace Marty Reid for the 17 Sprint Cup races hosted by ESPN alongside Dale Jarrett and Andy Petree. Nicole Briscoe would replace him as host of NASCAR Countdown alongside Rusty Wallace and Brad Daugherty. Bestwick replaced Marty Reid as play-by-play announcer for the Sprint Cup Series races starting at the Brickyard 400, returning him to the position for the first time since 2004. Bestwick also called the Nationwide Series for the remainder of the 2013 season after Reid was fired from ESPN.

With the end of ESPN&#x27;s NASCAR coverage after the 2014 season, Bestwick became the lead announcer for ESPN&#x27;s broadcasts of IndyCar races for ABC beginning in 2014, also replacing Reid. Bestwick also began to perform play-by-play duties for non-racing events, including college football.

On Halloween night in 2015, Bestwick called the Miami-Duke college football game, when Miami was down 27–24 with 6 seconds in the game and won the game on a controversial kickoff return touchdown after lateraling the ball eight times.
Taken short... lateral... they practiced that on Wednesday. Time&#x27;s going to expire on the game, so this either goes or this doesn&#x27;t. Ball&#x27;s still alive! It&#x27;s got to be a backwards lateral! Get behind it... still alive. They&#x27;ve got blockers, they&#x27;ve got blockers! They&#x27;ve got a lane! 40 yard line! &quot;No black shirts between the goal line! CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT YOU JUST SAW?!?!&quot;

On April 28, 2017, Bestwick confirmed that he was being released by ESPN after the 2017 IndyCar double-header Detroit Grand Prix and would call his last Indy 500. However, in February 2018, ESPN announced that they would be bringing Bestwick back to call the Indy 500 in 2018.

In 2023, the Superstar Racing Experience signed a deal with ESPN to broadcast the 2023 season on their channels with Allen Bestwick returning as play by play commentator for the broadcasts.

===CBS===

On April 14, 2021, it was announced that Bestwick will be the playbyplay commentator for the Superstar Racing Experience (SRX) racing series for CBS starting in 2021. Bestwick also did PA work for IMS during the Month of May the same year in addition to the NASCAR-IndyCar doubleheader weekend in August.

In the summer and autumn of 2022, Bestwick was a sideline reporter during the inaugural season of the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) Team Series.

<text>Moyra Caldecott (1 June 1927 – 23 May 2015) was a British author of historical fiction, fantasy, science fiction and non-fiction. Her works include &quot;Guardians of the Tall Stones&quot; and &quot;The Egyptian Sequence&quot;.

She was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and moved to London in 1951. She married Oliver Caldecott and raised three children. She had degrees in English and Philosophy and an M.A. in English Literature.

In 2000, she became one of the earliest proponents of commercial e-books when she contracted with Mushroom eBooks to re-publish most of her titles in electronic formats.

She had a reputation as a novelist who wrote as vividly about the adventures and experiences to be encountered in the inner realms of the human consciousness as she did about those in the outer physical world. To Moyra, reality was multidimensional.

In her later years she suffered from progressive aphasia. She died peacefully on 23 May 2015, aged 87.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===

Moyra was born in Pretoria, South Africa, on 1 June 1927 to Jessica Florence (Harris) and Frederick Stanley Brown. Moyra studied at Natal University, obtaining degrees in English Literature and Philosophy and a Master&#x27;s in English Literature. In 1950, she moved to Cape Town and became a lecturer at the university there, where she met Oliver Caldecott, an anti-apartheid campaigner. In 1951, they moved to the UK and married in London. Once settled, she took evening classes in geology, religious studies, mythology, archaeology, Egyptian hieroglyphics and pottery. She also took up watercolour painting, pottery, batik making and the creation of stained glass.

===Writing===

Moyra Caldecott had written since childhood, but first gained attention as a poet. Her work was published in various poetry anthologies throughout the 1950s and &#x27;60s. She became Secretary to the acclaimed Dulwich Poetry Group in the 1960s. Plays of hers were performed on radio, but it was not until she started writing novels in her late 40s, that her career took off. She went on to see more than 30 books published.

Her best known work is the &quot;Guardians of the Tall Stones Trilogy&quot;. Set in Bronze Age Britain, it was inspired by a vivid experience she had in Dyce Stone circle in Scotland, and the world heritage site of Avebury in Wiltshire. For many years this trilogy was required reading for various tour groups visiting the sacred sites of Britain from America, and has been in print continuously since 1977.

Another well-received trilogy, about the rise, fall and rise again of the ancient Egyptian priests of Amun, focused on Akhenaten and Hatshepsut. As a result of these books, she was invited by the pop star Tina Turner to act as a personal guide to the ancient sites of Egypt – an experience that Moyra spoke of with great fondness.

Although fascinated by prehistory and the Celts, Moyra was also knowledgeable about other traditions and devoted the major portion of her life to collecting and examining myths and legends across the world. She followed Jung and Joseph Campbell in believing myths and legends are not &quot;just&quot; stories but actually deep and meaningful expressions of the universal and eternal in the human psyche.

Moyra Caldecott&#x27;s non-fiction titles include: &quot;Crystal Legends, Myths of the Sacred Tree, Women in Celtic Myth, and Mythical Journeys, Legendary Quests.&quot;

===Family===

Her husband, Oliver Z. S. Caldecott, son of South African artists Harry Stratford Caldecott and Florence Josephine Zerffi, was a fierce and outspoken opponent of apartheid. He fled South Africa during a crackdown on the movement and moved to London, where he continued his political campaigning. He became first an editor for Readers Union and later Chief Editor of Fiction at Penguin Books during the 1960s. After the death of Sir Allen Lane, Caldecott left Penguin to start his own publishing house, Wildwood House, in the 1970s. Throughout his publishing career, he also painted and exhibited widely.

In 1987, with Oliver&#x27;s health failing, the Caldecotts moved to Bath, a city whose Romano-British heritage Moyra wrote about in two of her novels, &quot;The Winged Man&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Waters of Sul&quot; (1997). She was also a founder member of the (now dormant) Bladud Society, dedicated to raising awareness of Bath&#x27;s Celtic heritage, and in her later years she liked to perform her visionary poetry at local open mic events in the city.

She was made an honorary bard of Bath in 2005 and a memoir of her life, &quot;Multi-Dimensional Life&quot;, was published on her 80th birthday by the Bath-based firm Mushroom Books.

===Children===

Stratford Caldecott (26 November 1953 – 17 July 2014) was an author, editor, publisher, and blogger. His books include &quot;Radiance of Being,&quot; &quot;Beauty for Truth&#x27;s Sake&quot;, &quot;All Things Made New&quot;, and &quot;Not as the World Gives&quot;.

Julian Caldecott (born 2 August 1956) is an author, ecologist and blogger. His books include &quot;Hunting and Wildlife Management in Sarawak, Designing Conservation Projects, Water: The Causes, Costs and Future of a Global Crisis, Aid Performance and Climate Change&quot;, and (as co-editor) &quot;World Atlas of Great Apes and their Conservation&quot;.

Rachel Caldecott (born 1 August 1960) is a novelist, craftswoman, illustrator, human rights activist and blogger. Her books include &quot;Lodève – A Fast Guide to its History&quot;, &quot;The Panopticon Experiment (Book One of the Siklus Series)&quot;, and the humorous memoir &quot;Blown Out of Proportion: Misadventures of a Glassblower in France&quot;.

<doc id="1074182" wikidata="Q4850213" url="?curid=1074182" title="Balboa Stadium">
<text>Balboa Stadium is an outdoor stadium in San Diego, California, adjacent to San Diego High School and Balboa Park. Owned by the City of San Diego, it is leased to San Diego Unified School District. The stadium is used for local athletics and high school events. It has been the home of the San Diego High School Cavers athletic teams since it opened in 1915.

The original stadium was built in 1914 as part of the 1915 Panama–California Exposition with a capacity of 15,000. The stadium expanded in the 1960s to a capacity of 34,000. Due to seismic safety concerns, it was demolished in the 1970s and a smaller venue with a 3,000-seat capacity was built, opening in 1978. Most of the original stadium&#x27;s distinguishing architectural features were removed.

The stadium hosted the San Diego State Aztecs football team from 1921 to 1935. It also hosted the San Diego Chargers of the National Football League (NFL) from 1961 to 1966. Additionally, the stadium hosted various bowl games, including the San Diego East-West Christmas Classic from 1921 to 1922, the Harbor Bowl from 1947 to 1949, and the Poinsettia Bowl from 1952 to 1955.

==Earlier uses==

The original stadium was built in 1914 as part of the 1915 Panama–California Exposition, also in Balboa Park, with a capacity of 15,000. A horseshoe design that opened to the south, it was designed by the Quayle Brothers architectural firm and originally called City Stadium. On May 31, 1915, the stadium was dedicated and around 20,000 people came to watch track and field events. Since 1915, it has been the home field of the San Diego High School Cavers athletic teams.

Auto racing took place on a quarter-mile dirt track in Balboa Stadium from about 1937 through July 4, 1961, when the racing stopped so the facility could be used for pro football. Balboa Stadium was one of the hotbeds of midget racing starting in about 1937 until the early 1950s (except for the war years). When interest in midget racing started waning, jalopies became popular. The San Diego Racing Association was formed in 1953 and started sanctioning the racing. By 1958, the San Diego Racing Assn had transformed from a jalopy association to a sleeker modified sportsman (the forerunners of today&#x27;s super modifieds). Jalopy champions of the SDRA at Balboa included Glen Hoagland (1953), Jim Wood (1954), Jack Krogh (1955), Harris Mills (1956), Don Ray (1957), and Mondo Iavelli (1958). Don Thomas (1957) was the inaugural modified champion with Art Pratt being a three time titlest (1958 - 1959 - 1960). Rip Erikson took the honors in the 1961 season that was split between Balboa Stadium and Cajon Speedway. Also holding events at Balboa Stadium during the 1950s were occasional visits by the URA midgets and the NASCAR Pacific Coast Late Models. During the 1950s it was not unusual for more than 10,000 fans to attend a weekly show at Balboa.

The stadium also hosted local amateur and professional baseball contests in the period prior to the establishment of the Pacific Coast League Padres in 1936. Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Ty Cobb, and Satchel Paige played in Balboa Stadium.

College football&#x27;s Harbor Bowl was held there from 1947 to 1949. The San Diego East-West Christmas Classic was held there in 1921 and 1922. From 1952 through 1955, the stadium hosted the Poinsettia Bowl, contested between armed services football teams.

The stadium has been the site of famous races in track and field. In 1965, high-schooler Jim Ryun from Kansas beat world-record holder and reigning 1500 m Olympic champion Peter Snell of New Zealand in a mile race in 3:55.3 on June 27, an American high school record that stood for 42 years. A year later, Tim Danielson from San Diego area Chula Vista High School ran 3:59.4 in the same stadium to become only the second high school runner to run a sub-4:00 mile. Only three high school runners have managed to break that barrier since (Marty Liquori in 1967, Alan Webb in 2001, and Lukas Verzbicas in 2011). Fifty years after Ryun first broke the 4 minute mile, the stadium hosted a &quot;Festival of Miles&quot; featuring a return of Ryun.

The first two major meets of the developing age division of Masters athletics were held in Balboa Stadium, July 19–20, 1968, and July 3–6, 1969.

During the mid to late 1950s, a huge musical production, &quot;The California Story&quot;, was put on in Balboa Stadium as part of the Fiesta del Pacifico celebration. The extravaganza featured a cast of 1,300 people, including a symphony orchestra and a 150-voice choir. Performances were directed by Meredith Willson, who also contributed music and lyrics. The production followed the history of California from the arrival of Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo in 1540 through the early 20th century. It was billed as &quot;the biggest non-movie spectacle ever produced anywhere.&quot;

==San Diego Chargers==
To accommodate the American Football League&#x27;s Chargers, which moved from Los Angeles, the seating capacity was increased from 23,000 to 34,000 by adding an upper deck in May. It was their home for six years, through the 1966 season.

Balboa Stadium witnessed the Chargers&#x27; glory years in the American Football League, which featured such players as John Hadl, Lance Alworth, Jack Kemp, Keith Lincoln, and Ernie Ladd, and hosted the 1961, 1963, and 1965 AFL championship games (1W, 2L), as well as the 1961, 1962, and 1963 AFL All-Star games. In their six seasons here, head coach Sid Gillman&#x27;s club had a home record of winning four Western Division titles and one league crown (1963).

In 1967, the Chargers left Balboa for the new San Diego Stadium (later known by multiple other names) in Mission Valley, where the club&#x27;s glory slowed and the titles stopped (although they did win several AFC Western Division titles) until they won the AFC championship in 1994; the Chargers returned to Los Angeles in 2017.

==Concerts==
The stadium was used for popular music concerts and other public gatherings through the 1960s and 1970s. On August 28, 1965, the Beatles performed at the stadium during their second North American tour. The Doors&#x27; concert at Balboa with Ike &amp; Tina Turner on October 26, 1969 was canceled by the city council due to Jim Morrison&#x27;s arrest for indecent exposure earlier that year.

Notable musicians and signers who have performed at the stadium include Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, the Doobie Brothers, Linda Ronstadt, the Eagles, Led Zeppelin, Peter Frampton, Yes, Jethro Tull, Robin Trower, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Steely Dan, Chicago, Jefferson Airplane, Santana and Fleetwood Mac.

==Notable events==

On September 19, 1919, President Woodrow Wilson spoke in front of over 50,000 people in Balboa Stadium in support of the creation of the League of Nations. This was the first presidential speech to use an electronic voice amplification system. This system was invented by Edwin S. Pridham and Peter L. Jensen. They called their invention the &quot;Magnavox&quot; (&quot;Great Voice&quot;) moving coil device. The two would go on to found the Magnavox company.

On September 21, 1927, Charles Lindbergh visited San Diego, where the Spirit of St. Louis was built by Ryan Aeronautical, and was greeted with a hero&#x27;s welcome at the stadium. With over 60,000 in attendance (10,000 more than President Wilson) he performed a low-level fly over at 100 feet, dipping his aircraft&#x27;s wings and circling the stadium 8 times. He landed and was then paraded through the city to the stadium where the crowd had to be held back by 650 U.S. Marines.

On December 7, 1941, a Navy vs. Marines football game was interrupted at halftime by news of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The game was never finished.

The stadium was also the site of the first match of the NASL Final 1968.

On March 24, 1976, the San Diego Jaws played the Pelé led New York Cosmos in front of 18,128 people to a 1–1 draw.

==Modern stadium==

The original stadium was demolished in the 1970s due to concerns about its stability during an earthquake, and was rebuilt in 1978 with a much smaller seating capacity than when it housed the Chargers. Most of its distinguishing architectural features were removed. The remaining seating is made up of simple concrete bleachers, which also form the walls of the canyon the field is built in.

San Diego&#x27;s largest and oldest running club, the San Diego Track Club also calls Balboa Stadium its home. It is used by San Diego High School for local high school sporting and other events. During the 1990s and the 2000s, it was also used as the home field (for football only) by St. Augustine High School and San Diego City College.

Balboa Stadium is the site of the annual &quot;Stand Down&quot; program, an outreach to provide services to needy and homeless military veterans, sponsored by the Veterans Village of San Diego.

An article in the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; on November 27, 2006, highlighted the stadium&#x27;s state of disrepair. Artificial turf installed in 2001 was torn and rippling, and the track surrounding the field had dangerous depressions thought to be able to cause injury to runners. Both the turf and the track have since been completely renovated.

<text>Rick Benjamin (born October 22, 1952, in Danbury, Connecticut) is a motorsports journalist. He was Speed Channel&#x27;s voice of the USAR Hooters Pro Cup Series, and was the voice of Champ Car racing for HDNet from 2004 until the end of the final season of Champ Car in 2007.

Benjamin was a local news reporter from 1976 until 1996, being a television anchorman and managing editor for markets as diverse as Knoxville, Tennessee (where his youngest son&#x27;s birth was announced on-air); KSAT-TV in San Antonio, Texas; the Nebraska Television Network in Kearney, Nebraska; KWQC in the Quad Cities of Iowa and Illinois; Toledo, Ohio; and Roanoke, Virginia. He was also the news director for Waterbury, CT&#x27;s WATR.

Benjamin also did work for Mizlou Television Network for their NASCAR coverage, and for SportsChannel in 1990 when they aired Busch Grand National races, using the pseudonym Ron Williams.

When The Nashville Network bought 50% of Ken Squier and Fred Rheinstein&#x27;s World Sports Enterprises, and shifted production of TNN&#x27;s popular &quot;RaceDay&quot; from Patterson International to the network&#x27;s own in-house operation, located inside the industrial park of Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway, Benjamin was named anchor of the network&#x27;s RaceDay in 1995, anchoring the show until MTV shut down the entire CBS Charlotte operation in November 2000.

Benjamin is responsible for the &quot;rebranding&quot; of CART into Champ Cars, as during the CART-IRL dispute, Benjamin began using the term &quot;Champ Car,&quot; an old term used in USAC during the Marlboro Championship Trail, to refer to the CART formula in 1997, on RaceDay after the rival Indy Racing League switched to a normally aspirated formula. The show used the term, which CART began using in 1998 after Federal Express took over sponsorship of the series from PPG Industries, and the new &quot;Champ Car&quot; term was a reference to the FedEx Championship Series. Since 2004, he has been the lead announcer for the series, which has gone out on Spike TV, CBS, NBC, Speed Channel &amp; in 2007 returning to the networks of ESPN &amp; ABC for the first time since 2001.

Benjamin was one of the first on-air personalities at Speed when it was launched as SpeedVision in 1996. He is a former &quot;SpeedNews&quot; anchor.

Benjamin is also frequently a backup news anchor at Charlotte radio station WBT, where he has some duties with the Carolina Panthers pre and post game shows, and has used his experience in the news media to form Visioncast, where his group teaches drivers, crewmen, and corporate representatives to face the media.

Benjamin formerly co-hosted Tradin&#x27; Paint with Danny &quot;Chocolate&quot; Myers on Sirius Satellite Radio&#x27;s NASCAR channel 90. He was succeeded by Jim Noble.

Benjamin also appeared in the movie &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot;, starring Will Ferrell.

<doc id="1074204" wikidata="Q7727013" url="?curid=1074204" title="The Common Man">
<text>The Common Man is a cartoon character created by Indian author and cartoonist R. K. Laxman. For over a half of a century, the Common Man has represented the hopes, aspirations, troubles and perhaps even foibles of the average Indian, through a daily comic strip, &quot;You Said It&quot; in &quot;The Times of India&quot;. The comic was started in 1951.

When Laxman began to draw cartoons in &quot;The Times of India&quot;, he attempted to represent different states and cultures in India. In the rush to meet deadlines, he began to draw fewer and fewer background characters, until finally he found only one remaining—the now-familiar Common Man. The Common Man generally acts as a silent witness to all the action in the comic. According to anthropologist Ritu Gairola Khanduri, &quot;Clad in a dhoti and a plaid jacket, the puzzled Common Man is no dupe: his sharp observations miss no detail of the political circus.&quot;

==Other depictions==
*The Common Man featured in a commemorative postage stamp released by the Indian Postal Service on the 150th anniversary of the &quot;Times of India&quot; in 1988. It became one of the most recognised feature on &quot;The Times of India&quot; the largest-circulation English language daily broadsheet newspaper in the world.
*On 24 October 2015, Google featured the Common Man on a Google Doodle to honour R. K. Laxman on the occasion of his 94th birthday.
*The Common Man was the mascot for the low budget airline Air Deccan.
*The character was adapted into the Indian television series &quot;Wagle Ki Duniya&quot; on DD National and &quot;R K Laxman Ki Duniya&quot; on SAB TV.
*Salman Rushdie, who grew up in Bombay on a daily fare of Laxman&#x27;s pocket cartoons, mentions the Common Man in two of his books—his 1995 novel &quot;The Moor&#x27;s Last Sigh&quot; and his 2012 autobiography, Joseph Anton.

===Statues===

*An 8.2 feet high bronze statue of &quot;The Common Man&quot; has been erected at the Symbiosis Institute, Pune in front of its Vishwabhavan building. The Common Man has a wisp of white hair that is perpetually standing, leaving him with a bewildered look. 
* A statue of The Common Man, created by the sculptor Suresh Sakpal, was installed in 2007 along the sea face on Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan road, Worli seaface, Mumbai.
* A statue of The Common Man is erected at the entrance of R. K. Laxman Museum at  Balewadi, Pune.

<doc id="1074205" wikidata="Q2247576" url="?curid=1074205" title="Vegetarian nutrition">
<text>Vegetarian nutrition is the set of health-related challenges and advantages of vegetarian diets.

Appropriately planned vegetarian diets are healthful and nutritionally adequate for all stages of the human life cycle, including during pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence. However, vegetarian diets deficient in vitamin B12 or calories may compromise children&#x27;s health and development. The UK National Health Service recommends that vegetarian diets should also follow the general recommendations for healthy diets, such as low fat, salt and sugar intakes and 5 fruits or vegetables a day. Qatar&#x27;s public health ministry states, &quot;One cannot be a healthy vegetarian by going to a fast food restaurant and ordering french fries and soda!&quot;.

Vegetarian diets tend to be rich in carbohydrates, omega-6 fatty acids, dietary fibre, carotenoids, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, potassium and magnesium. They are possibly low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and animal protein.

== Critical nutrients ==

=== Protein ===

Despite the long-standing, widespread belief that vegetarians must consume grains and beans within a short time to make a &quot;complete protein&quot; that contains all 9 essential amino acids that must be supplied through diet, this has never been substantiated by research. The protein-combining theory was brought to popular attention after being promoted in Frances Moore Lappé&#x27;s 1971 bestselling book &quot;Diet for a Small Planet&quot;. In later editions of the book, starting in 1981, Lappé withdrew her contention that &quot;protein combining&quot; is necessary.

Plant foods rich in protein include soy beans and soy products such as tofu, veggie burgers, and soy milk; other legumes; nuts and seeds; and cereal grains.

=== Vitamin B12 ===
Vitamin B12 deficiency can be extremely serious and lead to megaloblastic anemia, nerve degeneration and irreversible neurological damage.

Vegetarians may get vitamin B12 from eggs and dairy products (milk, cheese, etc.); for some, this is adequate, while others may still remain B12-deficient. More broadly, according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, even the form of vitamin B12 sourced from animal products is protein-bound and not as easily digested as supplements, especially as people age, and therefore B12 supplementation is recommended for everyone over the age of 50. Pregnant and lactating vegetarian mothersand breastfed infants if the vegetarian mother&#x27;s diet is not supplementedshould also use supplements, whether B12-pills, B12-injections, or B12-fortified foods, if they don&#x27;t get adequate vitamin B12 from animal products like eggs or dairy.

Generally, humans need 2.4 to 3 micrograms of vitamin B12 each day. There are cases to suggest that vegetarians and vegans who are not taking vitamin B12 supplements or food fortified with B12 do not consume sufficient servings of B12 and have abnormally low blood concentrations of vitamin B12. This is because, unless fortified, plant foods do not contain reliable amounts of active vitamin B12.

It is essential, therefore, that vegetarians consume adequate amounts of dietary supplements or foods that have been fortified with B12, such as vegetable stock, veggie burger mixes, textured vegetable protein, soy milks, vegetable and sunflower margarines, and breakfast cereals. B12 used in these foods or supplements is typically grown from vegan sources (such as bacteria). Soybeans and barley seeds from plants grown in soils amended either with cow dung (which is rich in B12) or with pure B12 had a higher B12 content than those grown without this supplementation.

=== Omega-3 fatty acids ===
Vegetarian diets can be low in omega-3 fatty acids (O3FAs). Major vegetarian O3FA sources include algae, hempseeds and hempseed oil, walnuts, flaxseeds and flaxseed oil, olive oil, canola oil, avocado, and chia seeds.

A potential problem is that vegetarian diets lacking eggs or generous amounts of edible seaweed generally lack a direct source of long-chain O3FAs such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Vegetarian diets may also have a high ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to O3FAs, which inhibits the conversion of short-chain fatty acids such as alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in most vegetarian O3FA sources, to EPA and DHA. Short-term supplemental ALA has been shown to increase EPA levels but not DHA levels, suggesting poor conversion of the intermediary EPA to DHA. To remedy this, DHA and EPA supplements derived from microalgae are available.

A 2022 review found that microalgal oil supplementation is consistent in increasing DHA and EPA levels, whilst high dose flaxseed or echium seed oil supplements provide no increase despite significant increases in ALA levels.

===Calcium===

In general, lacto-ovo-vegetarians have a relatively high intake of calcium that meet or exceed calcium recommendations. 

A 2022 review found no significant difference in calcium intake between vegetarians and omnivores. Vegetarians can obtain calcium from dairy products, calcium-fortified plant milks, almonds, figs, oranges, calcium-set tofu as well as low-oxalate vegetables such as bok choy, kale and turnip greens.

Compared with omnivores, vegetarians tend to have a lower bone mineral density (BMD) but not a higher fracture rate.

=== Iron ===

Vegetarians are more likely to have lower iron stores compared with non-vegetarians and have a higher risk of iron deficiency anemia. Lacto-ovo-vegetarians that overly rely on dairy consumption may lead to an elevated calcium intake which can affect iron absorption.

The recommended iron intake for vegetarians is 180% that of nonvegetarians due to the bioavailability of non-heme iron. Although a lower &quot;percentage&quot; of non-heme iron is absorbed by the body, greater total &quot;amounts&quot; of non-heme iron are concentrated in many non-meat sources of iron, and therefore breakfast cereals, eggs, nuts, seeds, and legumes (including soy foods, peas, beans, chickpeas, and lentils) are significant sources of iron, and a well-planned vegetarian diet should not lead to iron deficiency.

Non-heme iron is more sensitive to both &quot;inhibitors&quot; and &quot;enhancers&quot; of iron absorption: Vitamin C is an iron absorption enhancer; the main inhibitors for most people are phytates (e.g. legumes and cereal grains), but other inhibitors include tannins (from tea and wine), calcium, and polyphenols.

Iron is an integral part in the chemical structure of many proteins and enzymes, which maintain good health. In humans, iron is an essential component of proteins involved in the transport of oxygen of red blood cells. Iron also helps regulate cell growth and cellular differentiation.

=== Zinc ===
A 2013 review found that zinc intake and serum zinc concentrations were significantly lower in populations that follow vegetarian diets compared with non-vegetarians.

Phytates in many whole grains, and dietary fiber in many plant foods may interfere with zinc absorption, and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects. Vegetarians may need more than the US Recommended Daily Allowance of 15 mg of zinc each day to compensate if their diet is high in phytates. Major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans, edible seaweed, fortified breakfast cereals, soy products, nuts, peas, and seeds.

=== Iodine ===

One study reported a &quot;potential danger of [iodine] (I) deficiency disorders due to strict forms of vegetarian nutrition, especially when fruits and vegetables grown in soils with low [iodine] levels are ingested.&quot; Iodine, however, is usually supplied by iodized salt and other sources in first world countries. Other significant vegetarian sources of iodine include edible seaweed and bread made with dough conditioners.

==Health effects==

Evidence suggests that vegetarian diets have beneficial effects on blood lipids and that vegetarians have a reduced risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

<doc id="1074215" wikidata="Q634756" url="?curid=1074215" title="Franchi SPAS-12">
<text>The Franchi SPAS-12 is a combat shotgun manufactured by Italian firearms company Franchi from 1979 to 2000. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS-12 was sold to military and police users worldwide, as well as on the civilian market.

The appearance and intended purpose of the SPAS-12 initially led to its &quot;military&quot; designation as a combat shotgun. The SPAS-12 was designed from the ground up as a rugged military shotgun, and it was named the Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun. In 1990, Franchi renamed the shotgun the Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun, which allowed continued sales to the United States as a limited-magazine-capacity, fixed-stock model until 1994. Following the United States Federal Assault Weapons Ban, imports of SPAS-12 shotguns to the United States were stopped. In September 2004 the ban expired, but Franchi ended production of the SPAS-12 in 2000 to focus on the manufacturing of the SPAS-15 model. The SPAS-12&#x27;s factory retail price in its final year was 1,500 averaged for its final sales outside the United States to non-restricted countries.

==Design==

The SPAS-12 was designed to function primarily in semi-automatic mode, with the pump-action mode used to reliably fire low-pressure ammunition such as tear gas rounds or less-lethal bean bags. The firing mode is switched by depressing the button under the fore-grip and also sliding it forwards or backwards until it clicks into position allowing the rotating sleeve to open or close the two gas ports.

The semi-automatic mode functions with a short-stroke gas piston system. When a shell is fired, the pressure makes the bolt move rearward but the bolt will stop before opening as it deploys a single top locking lug. The gas vents into the barrel and the gas port is located towards the end of the barrel. From the gas port, the gas vents downwards into the gas block where it pushes the piston rearward. Because of the presence of the magazine tube and to avoid the use of a top-mounted gas system, the gas block and the piston are annular, along with the piston spring they enclose the magazine tube. Once operated, the piston drives 2 symmetrical thin sprung operating rods located in the corners formed by the barrel and the magazine tube. As the rods push the bolt carrier rearward, it disengages the locking lug and drives the bolt rearward, allowing the system to cycle.

The SPAS-12 has a magazine cut-off feature, which prevents the magazine from releasing a new round when the action is cycled. This allows the operator to load a different type of round into the chamber without first unloading the chambered round, and the second that would otherwise subsequently be released from the magazine. 

A unique feature of the folding-stock variants is the butt hook. With the stock extended, the hook can be pushed in and turned 90 degrees to the left or right, to fit under the user&#x27;s forearm. This is to enable the shotgun to be fired with one hand; e.g. while abseiling/rappelling, or from a vehicle window while driving. The hook can be released from the buttplate completely by turning 180 degrees.

SPAS-12 models feature two safeties: (i) a lever style or push button style safety, and (ii) a &quot;quick employment safety&quot;. Lever safeties were recalled by Franchi and were replaced through the importer American Arms in the early 1990s. There are two types of push-button safeties. The earliest version would release the hammer on a safe up to 1/4in. of travel when the trigger was depressed; this would cause a lockup of the action that would require the user to re-lock the bolt assembly to the rear to reset the hammer and then reload the chamber. The later version installed a detent and machined hole in the trigger group frame to prevent an action lock; the detent would prevent the hammer from engaging when the trigger was depressed and would prevent an action lock from occurring. The quick employment safety, which is on the left side of the trigger guard, disconnects the trigger when put into safe mode. The quick employment safety can be disengaged with the trigger finger when ready to fire and is intended for competition or tactical use. A third safety type, a pistol grip safety similar to the later-developed SPAS-15, is known to have been developed by Franchi for the SPAS-12, however, the pistol grip safety was not offered for sale to the general public.

A B-Square rail mount for optics was available for a short time in the 1990s as an aftermarket accessory.

The barrel of the SPAS-12 was externally threaded to accept a variety of attachments. The barrel is cylinder bored and spreads a normal shot charge to about 900mm at 40 meters.

There are four different magazine extension tubes manufactured for the SPAS-12:
# The 5-shell was designed for the 18&quot; barrel.
# The 6-shell was designed for restriction on the standard 21.5&quot; Sporting Purpose model.
# The 7-shell was designed for the 19&quot; barrel.
# The 8-shell was designed for the 21.5 Special purpose model.

Many choke types original and aftermarket exist for the SPAS-12. A 44 mm grenade launcher was used by France for explosive grenades capable of a range of 150 meters. A factory shot diverter that spreads shot vertically or horizontally was originally included with earlier model SPAS-12s. There are many known reproduction diverters.

==SPAS-12, SAS-12 and LAW-12 model differences==

Four different stock styles exist. The first version of the SPAS-12 was manufactured with a wooden detachable stock and a standard grip. Later models included the folding metal stock with a hook. After the United States imposed import restrictions on the SPAS-12 in 1989, a version was released in 1990 with the synthetic hollow fixed stock and a six-shell capacity to comply with federal regulations for sporting purposes.

Four different factory barrels were manufactured for the SPAS-12.
# (Very rare) &quot;shorty&quot; made for law enforcement/military and originally distributed mainly in France. This is the only known model to receive the pistol grip safety.
# (Very rare) found scattered on very few of the 1983 &quot;AL&quot; proofed SPAS-12 shotguns. These were originally made for law enforcement/military applications.
# (Common to the United Kingdom) as a one-piece barrel converted to a UK-legal barrel. This barrel adds a choke tube brazed or silver-soldered in place.
# (Most common) The standard with sight blade muzzle ended on the barrel for the special purpose model or the pushed back sight blade with brazed extension for the sporting purpose model.

The Franchi SPAS-12 came equipped with a non-adjustable circular aperture rear sight and a large, non-adjustable blade foresight integrated into the barrel. The LAW-12 was semi-automatic only and the SAS-12 was a pump-action only. These three &quot;sister&quot; shotguns accepted all SPAS-12 components, notably trigger groups, barrel threaded attachments and stocks. The various magazine extension tubes of the LAW-12 and SAS-12 were never designed to be interchangeable with the SPAS-12 as this would cause issues with the gas selector switch moving from auto to pump-action on the SPAS-12 model. The extensions have been known to spin off the front of the SPAS-12 during cycling if the extension was not tapered for the SPAS-12 retaining pin.

The pump-action Franchi SAS-12 could accept 3&quot; shells but it did not have a bolt handle cut in the bolt body. The SPAS and LAW could only accept 2&quot; shells. The SAS-12 has a barrel length of , an overall length of , a weight of and a capacity of 8 rounds in the magazine + 1 in the chamber.

The semi-automatic-only Franchi LAW-12 Model was also restricted by importation in 1989 and banned in 1994 with the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. The LAW-12 has a barrel length of , a weight of and a capacity of 8 rounds in the magazine + 1 in the chamber. The model was known to have been imported with all stock styles used on the Franchi SPAS-12. The LAW-12 models were more common with police sales as an alternative to the more expensive SPAS-12 for departments throughout the United States. The LAW-12 model was notably lighter – – than the SPAS-12 and still maintained the same tube capacity of 8+1 shells. LAW-12 gas pistons were designed as two pieces; unlike the one-piece design of the SPAS-12, they are not interchangeable. The LAW-12 was discontinued by Franchi shortly before the SPAS-12 was discontinued in 2000.

==US market==
===Importers===

In the United States, there were two importers of SPAS-12 shotguns. Importation of the SPAS-12 into the United States began in 1982 and ended in 1989 under F.I.E. Corp. In 1989, F.I.E. suffered from major losses in sales due to the president&#x27;s importation ban, which was a reinterpretation of 18 U.S.C. 925(d)(3) that required firearms to have a &quot;sporting purpose&quot; in order to be imported.

In 1990 American Arms incorporated purchased all remaining inventories of parts and SPAS-12 shotguns from the now-bankrupt F.I.E Corp and began the re-importation of the Franchi SPAS-12 as the (Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun) under newly approved restrictions until 1994. The ATF allowed the importation of a SPAS-12 variant from American Arms because its size, weight, bulk and modified configuration were such that it was particularly suitable for traditional shooting sports.

The SPAS-12 was tested by the U.S. Coast Guard and showed promising results but again was not considered cost-effective for a contract over other available suppliers. The Assault Weapons Ban of September 1994 caused American Arms to stop the importation of the SPAS-12 with major losses of sales due to the legal restrictions invoked by the U.S. Assault Weapons Ban.

Both importers placed numerous additional orders for the SPAS-12 that were never complete due to U.S. restrictions throughout importation. This was the reason for such few numbers of shotguns imported into the United States.

===Legality===

In the United States, between September 1994 and September 2004, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban prohibited the transfer and possession of SPAS-12 shotguns manufactured after 13 September 1994. The ban sunset on 13 September 2004 and is no longer in force. However, some U.S. States and territories currently maintain similar bans, including California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York.

==Notes==
:The push-button cross bolt safety has also been known to fail and release the hammer when depressing the trigger on the safe and it is recommended that the secondary Quick Employment Safety (lever tab on the left side of the trigger) is used on both the newer and older style trigger groups in place of the lever or cross bolt safety&#x27;s to prevent accidental discharge.
:The LAW-12 and SAS-12 models were known to have no import markings on the receiver but are actually marked by the importer on the barrel itself.

<doc id="1074239" wikidata="Q429342" url="?curid=1074239" title="Duke of Teck">
<text>Duke of Teck () is a title which was created twice in Germanic lands. It was first borne from 1187 to 1439 by the head of a cadet line of the German ducal House of Zähringen, known as the &quot;first House of Teck&quot;. The seat of this territory was Castle Teck in the Duchy of Swabia (from 1512 part of the County of Württemberg).

The title was recreated in 1871 by King Charles I of Württemberg for his cousin Francis, who as the product of a morganatic marriage did not have a right to titles of nobility as a member of the House of Württemberg. His descendants settled in the United Kingdom and married into the British royal family.

==The first House of Teck==
Adalbert I, son of Conrad I, Duke of Zähringen, inherited his father&#x27;s Swabian possessions around Teck Castle between Kirchheim and Owen. After the death of his brother Berthold IV in 1186, Adalbert adopted the title of &quot;Duke of Teck&quot;. His descendant, Conrad II, became a candidate for the election as king of the Romans upon the death of King Rudolf I in 1291, but was slain the following year, probably by agents of his opponent Siegfried of Westerburg, Archbishop of Cologne.

In the 13th century, the family divided into the lines of Teck-Oberndorf and Teck-Owen. The dukes of Teck-Oberndorf died out in 1363 and Frederick of Teck-Owen sold their possessions to the counts of Hohenberg. In 1365, the dukes of Teck-Owen came into the possession of Mindelheim but had to sell their lands around Castle Teck to the counts of Württemberg in 1381. The last member of that line, Louis of Teck, Patriarch of Aquileia from 1412, died in 1439.

In 1495, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I elevated Count Eberhard von Württemberg to the status of reigning duke (&quot;herzog&quot;) of Württemberg, also granting him the defunct title of &quot;Duke of Teck&quot;. However, the title was not borne independently by any member or branch of that dynasty. Eventually, in 1806, the dignity was renounced by Frederick upon his elevation as king.

==The Teck branch of the Württembergs==

Duke Alexander of Württemberg (1804–1885), an Austrian major-general and cadet of the dynasty that had become kings of Württemberg in 1806, established a non-dynastic line of dukes of Teck by virtue of his morganatic marriage in 1835 with a Hungarian noblewoman, Countess Claudine Rhédey von Kis-Rhéde (1812–1841). Their son, excluded from succession to the throne of Württemberg, was born Count Francis von Hohenstein (1837–1900), sharing the title his mother was granted by Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria on 16 May 1835, two weeks after the couple married in Vienna.

In 1863, King William I of Württemberg raised Francis in rank to &quot;Prince (&quot;Fürst&quot;) of Teck&quot; with the style Serene Highness (&quot;Durchlaucht&quot;), heritable by all his male-line descendants. In 1866, Francis married Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, a member of the British royal family and granddaughter of King George III. As the couple had to live on Mary&#x27;s parliamentary annuity, the prince having inherited little income, they lived mostly in England—first at Kensington Palace (where their children were born) and later at Royal Lodge in Surrey, both residences lent them by Queen Victoria.

In 1871, King Charles I of Württemberg granted Francis the new (and, within the German nobility, higher) title of &quot;Duke (&quot;Herzog&quot;) of Teck&quot;, heritable by male-line primogeniture. In 1887, Queen Victoria granted the Duke of Teck the British style of &quot;Highness&quot; on a non-hereditary basis.

In 1893, Francis&#x27; daughter, Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, married Prince George, Duke of York, who later reigned as King George V. When the first duke of Teck died in 1900, the title passed to his eldest son, Prince Adolphus of Teck. King George V granted the second duke of Teck, his brother-in-law, the personal style of &quot;Highness&quot; in 1911.

The title existed until the First World War, when anti-German sentiment in the United Kingdom prompted the British monarch to adopt a non-German surname and relinquish all German titles on behalf of himself and those of his family members domiciled in his realms, including the Tecks. The Duke of Teck thus renounced, in July 1917, his German titles of prince and duke in the Kingdom of Württemberg, as well as the styles of &quot;Highness&quot; and &quot;Serene Highness&quot;. Adolphus, along with his brother, Prince Alexander of Teck, assumed the name &quot;Cambridge&quot;, which had been borne as a territorial designation by their maternal grandfather, Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge.

On 16 July 1917, Adolphus was created as &quot;Marquess of Cambridge&quot;, &quot;Earl of Eltham&quot; and &quot;Viscount Northallerton&quot; in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His elder son took the courtesy title of &quot;Earl of Eltham&quot;. His younger children became &quot;Lord/Lady (Christian name) Cambridge&quot;, as children of a marquess. Adolphus&#x27;s younger brother, Alexander, who had married Princess Alice of Albany in 1904, was simultaneously created &quot;Earl of Athlone&quot; and &quot;Viscount Trematon&quot;. Their son Prince Rupert of Teck (1907–1928), who also took the surname of Cambridge and was known by the courtesy title of &quot;Viscount Trematon&quot;, was one of the descendants of Queen Victoria who suffered from haemophilia, along with the crown princes Alexei of Russia and Alfonso of Spain.

The last male-line descendant of the first duke of Teck was his grandson George Cambridge, 2nd Marquess of Cambridge. He died in 1981 and the marquessate of Cambridge became extinct.

<text>Peter David Windsor (born 11 April 1952) is a Formula One journalist, and former Formula One team and sponsorship manager.

==Career==
Windsor started his journalism career at the monthly magazine &quot;Competition Car&quot;. He was the motorsport editor for the British weekly magazine &quot;Autocar&quot; from the late 1970s until 1985.

===Formula One===
In 1985, Windsor became sponsorship manager at Williams for four years. He then worked as general manager for Ferrari&#x27;s UK base in 1989, only to return to Williams as team manager in 1991.

Windsor was Grand Prix Editor of the &quot;F1 Racing&quot; magazine from 1997 to 2009, and as of 2014, was the current senior columnist and feature writer on &quot;The Racer&#x27;s Edge&quot; section.

For several seasons Windsor was also the moderator for Formula One&#x27;s post-qualifying and post-race press conferences. He handed the interviewer&#x27;s microphone to James Allen from the 2009 British Grand Prix due to a concern over a potential or perceived conflict of interest as a future team boss; but returned to the interview room at the 2009 Italian Grand Prix. 

On 4 February 2009, it was reported Windsor and engineer/designer Ken Anderson were to head an American entrant into the 2010 Formula One season called US F1 Team. Their application was formally accepted by the FIA on 12 June 2009. Windsor&#x27;s role would involve team management and driver development and selection. However, in March 2010, US F1 ceased operations. On 25 June 2010 the FIA officially banned US F1 from any further participation in the sport, and the World Motor Sport Council fined them €309,000 for failing to meet their commitments for the 2010 race season.

==Personal life==
Shortly before the start of the 1986 season, Windsor was in an automobile accident when the car he was riding in with Frank Williams crashed on the way from the Paul Ricard Circuit in southern France to the Nice airport, causing Windsor minor injuries but leaving Williams, who was driving, paralysed.

<doc id="1074247" wikidata="Q503524" url="?curid=1074247" title="James Ross (Pennsylvania politician)">
<text>James Ross (July 12, 1762November 27, 1847) was an American politician and lawyer who represented Pennsylvania in the United States Senate from 1794 to 1803. During his tenure, he served as president pro tempore of the United States Senate from March to December 1799.

==Biography==
Born near Delta, York County, Pennsylvania, he was the son of Joseph and Jane (Graham) Ross. At eighteen, after having received a classical education, he moved to Canonsburg, Pennsylvania and taught at what would become Washington and Jefferson College. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1784 focusing on land law. A Federalist, he was a member of the convention that drafted a new constitution for Pennsylvania in 1789–1790. In 1791 Ross was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

President George Washington appointed him to negotiate with the rebels of the Whiskey Rebellion, successfully defusing the situation without violence. On April 1, 1794, the Pennsylvania legislature elected him to the United States Senate to replace Albert Gallatin, who was removed by the legislature. There, he authored a new law for the public lands and fought President Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s administration. He was elected to a second term in the Senate in 1797.

In 1800, with the 1800 Presidential Election on the horizon, Ross introduced a controversial bill whereby, after the electoral votes were counted in Congress, the ballots would be turned over to a committee chaired by the Chief Justice and consisting of twelve members, six from each house of Congress. The committee, acting behind closed doors, would be able to discard electoral votes deemed fraudulent after investigation. A group of horrified Republican Senators leaked the bill to arch-Republican Philadelphia printer William Duane, who published the contents in his &quot;Aurora&quot; on February 19, 1800. The Federalists quickly dropped the bill.

On January 15, 1803, amidst the controversies over Spain&#x27;s revocation of the American right of deposit at New Orleans and French acquisition of Louisiana, Ross moved to afford Jefferson the ability to raise 50,000 troops to seize New Orleans. Jefferson did not want to have to use these troops, but the motion gave United States Minister to France Robert R. Livingston leverage in his negotiations, which resulted in the Louisiana Purchase.

He ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Pennsylvania in 1799, 1802, and 1808.

During the late 1810s he is listed as the Pittsburgh City Council President.

He died in Allegheny, which is now part of Pittsburgh. Ross Street in Downtown Pittsburgh (bordering the Pittsburgh City-County Building and the Allegheny County Courthouse), the Pittsburgh suburb of Ross Township, the Fox Chapel borough street James Ross Place, and Ross County, Ohio, are named in his honor.

<text>Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP; , ), previously known as the &quot;Karuna Group&quot;, is a political party in Sri Lanka. It was formed by Karuna Amman (Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan), a former leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, after he defected from the organization in 2004. Initially a paramilitary group that helped the Sri Lankan Government fight the Tamil Tigers, the TMVP was registered as a political party in 2007. Under deputy leader Pillayan (Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan), they contested their first provincial elections in 2008, winning a majority in the Eastern Provincial Council. Members of the TMVP continued to carry arms at least until 2008 under the auspices of the Sri Lankan government, which they claim are for their own safety from the Tamil Tigers, who carry out repeated attacks against them. The group is believed to be working with the Sri Lankan Army. They have been accused of human rights violation by local and international human rights organization. 

After entering democratic elections the party aligned with the ruling UPFA and in 2020 it aligned with the SLPP and managed to gain a seat from Batticaloa with Pillayan winning the highest preferential votes while the party came second in the district. In 2024 presidential elections elections Pillayan pledged support to Ranil Wickremesinghe. The TMVP failed to win any seats in the 2024 general election.

==History==
The break-up between the LTTE and the Batticaloa-based Karuna group occurred in March 2004. Karuna and others felt that Prabhakaran had become a dictator of a state that used Northern Tamils to oppress the Eastern Tamils and that Eastern Tamils were not given due recognition for &quot;laying down their lives in disproportionate numbers for the northern leadership&quot;. Together with Indian-based Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front, TVMP has formed Tamileela Iykkiya Viduthalai Munnani as a united front. The purported aim and the motive of the party are to safeguard the rights of Tamils within the Eastern Province.

The president of TMVP was Kumaraswamy Nandagopan until he was assassinated in November 2008 and the general secretary G.E. Gnanarajah. The third in command is Mangalan Master.

Since its formation, the group worked with the Sri Lankan Army to combat the Tamil Tigers. They have been accused of using children to combat the LTTE and have allegedly committed human rights violations in the East of the island. The TMVP, in conjunction with the Government of Sri Lanka on December 1, 2008 signed an action plan stating that they would cease the recruitment of child soldiers and that they would also release from combat all child soldiers.

==Internal affairs==
===Internal struggles===
The TMVP has been affected by internal struggles between Colonel Karuna and Pillaiyan. Small skirmishes broke out between the Pillaiyan and Karuna factions with some fatalities in May 2007, October 2007, and in May 2008. However, Dheeban the Trincomalee district leader of the TMVP, denied a split claiming &quot;the split between Karuna and Pillaiyan is a mere media fabrication&quot;.

In mid-October 2008, Karuna cadres ransacked the office of Pillaiyan, leading to government consternation and intervention. That same week, the Karuna faction took over the &quot;Thamil Alai&quot; newspaper, the organ of the TMVP, which had been run by Pillaiyan in Karuna&#x27;s absence. However in late October, Karuna &quot;made it a point to emphasise that there were no differences between them&quot;. Due to the internecine feuds between varying factions of the TMVP, the Government of Sri Lanka has decided it would begin the disarmament of the feuding groups in early 2009. As tensions flared up in late 2009, the government began putting restrictions on the placement of TMVP political signs in cities of the East of Sri Lanka.

===Proposed name change===
&quot;Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Koddani&quot; (Koodani meaning alliance) is a new Tamil political party in Sri Lanka that has been proposed by Colonel Karuna, as either a splinter group of, or a new name for the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal. However, Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan has denied that this has proposed, stating &quot;When I met him (Karuna) and asked about this, he said that there was no such thing&quot;. The name change has been floated around because Karuna and related figures feel the word &quot;Puligal&quot; meaning Tiger, implies association with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The TMVP 11 member politburo is currently deliberating on the issue, with Karuna threatening to start the new party if it is not approved. However Karuna spokesman D. Kamalanathan denied both that a name change would take place and that there was a rift within the party, attributing the rumours to those against the TMVP.

==Human rights violations==
===General rights violations===
The group has been accused by the Human rights organizations Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International of recruiting children, torture, assassinations and engaging in extortion in its war against the LTTE. Human Rights Watch claimed that from June 2006 to December 2006 they have forcefully recruited several hundred children. The TMVP has also been accused of being involved in kidnappings for ransom of wealthy, predominantly Tamil, businessmen to raise money in Colombo and other towns. Some businessmen were allegedly killed because their family could not pay the ransom. Media has reported that these abductions were linked to the Security forces in these abductions, either directly facilitating them or providing a cover and not taking any action against them. One such abducted man alleged that while he was being transported, from his workplace in Colombo, his abduction vehicle came across Army checkpoints but was not rescued.

In 2006, the Tamil Human Rights group UTHR also accused the TMVP of taking part in death squad activity against civilians.

===Connection with the Sri Lankan State===
The group is also believed to be actively working with the Sri Lankan Army. According to Human Rights Watch in one incident, the children who were abducted by the TMVP cadres were being held in a store across a Sri Lankan military camp. The parents of the abducted children pleaded with the military but no actions were taken. It was reported that two army men talked to the TMVP cadres and then walked away 
. Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch said, “The government is fully aware of the abductions but allows them to happen because it’s eager for an ally against the Tamil Tigers”. The Human Rights Watch further added that it would be impossible to transport abducted children without the complicity of the Sri Lankan Army. In addition, civilians claimed seeing many TMVP cadres at Army checkpoints and claimed that they checked ID&#x27;s of the people. The Human Rights Watch further claimed that they saw a top Karuna Eastern commander riding atop an army personnel carrier. They also claimed that Armed Karuna cadre openly roamed the streets in Batticaloa district in sight of security forces, and in some cases they jointly patrolled with the police. According to UTHR, a local Human rights organization, two children who escaped from the TMVP later surrendered to the Sri Lankan Army. The children were taken back to the TMVP camp allegedly by the Sri Lankan Army and was later beaten to death. Another such incident happened in Trincomalee where the abducted children by the TMVP were taken to a Sri Lankan Navy check point. Soon the Sri Lankan Navy personnel came on motorcycles and escorted the Karuna men and their abducted children to the TMVP office. TMVP has also been alleged to have killed INGO workers. Ragunathan Ramalingam, a worker for the International INGO (World Concern), was asked to come to a Navy checkpoint. He was allegedly shot dead when he reached the check point. SLMM claimed that they saw TMVP pass through a checkpoint unchecked. It claimed that a white van, belonging to TMVP cadres, was transporting two 15-year-old boys and four armed civilians passed through an Army check point unchecked. However, the police maintained that they were instructed to check all vehicles and arrest any armed civilians.

The Batticaloa town was the only local council that TMVP contested under the banner of ruling United People&#x27;s Freedom Alliance.

The largest Tamil party Tamil National Alliance totally boycotting these polls. United National party (UNP) also boycotted the polls by telling candidates not to run but some UNP candidates names&#x27; showed up on the voting list. Both groups claim unfair elections took place. TNA claimed it wasn&#x27;t safe for them to operate in the east because the TMVP group was armed. TMVP threatened TNA MP&#x27;s and also captured alive family members of TNA MP prior to the elections. The BBC News reported that unnamed human rights groups claimed TMVP used violence before the election and therefore the elections were &quot;tainted&quot;. Independent candidate Rasiah Thurairatnam claimed that people voted out of fear for the TMVP.

<text>Ynglingatal or Ynglinga tal (Old Norse: &#x27;Enumeration of the Ynglingar&#x27;) is a Skaldic poem cited by Snorri Sturluson in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, the first saga of Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. Þjóðólfr of Hvinir (Thjodolf), who was a poet for Harald Fairhair (r. 872–930), is traditionally credited with its authorship. Snorri quotes frequently from this poem and cites it as one of the sources of the saga. The composition of the poem is dated to the 9th century.

The poem lists the partly mythical and partly historical ancient Swedish kings; twenty-seven of whom are mentioned in the poem, along with details about their deaths and burial places. The title &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; alludes to Yngling, who had the name Yngve-Frey—another name for Frey, the god who was worshipped in Sweden. Yngling allegedly descended from Frey&#x27;s son Fjölnir. Snorri portrayed Harald Fairhair as a descendant of the Ynglings. The poem was written on behalf of Ragnvald the Mountain-High, a cousin of King Harald Fairhair, and its last stanza is about Ragnvald.

==Verse forms and text history==

Ynglingatal is composed in &quot;kviðuháttr&quot; (modern Norwegian &quot;kviduhått&quot;); this genealogical verse form is also used in &quot;Son loss&quot; (Sonatorrek) in Egils saga. In this form of verse, the lines alternate between three and four syllables—the first line has three syllables, the next has four, the next three, and so on. For example:
:Ok Vísburs 
:vilja byrði 
:sævar niðr 
:svelgja knátti, [...]

:‘And the kinsman of the sea [FIRE] swallowed the ship of the will [BREAST] of Vísburr [...]’

&quot;Ynglingatal&quot; has also makes extensive use of acquaintance, such as rewriting and metaphors that give life to the poem, which otherwise contains much litany.

The Icelandic philologist Finnur Jónsson believed the eight-line stanza defines &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;&#x27;s structure, while Walter Akerlund believed the four-line helming—the half-stanza as in the example above—defines the poem&#x27;s structure. Akerlund has also said the bard Thjodolf learned the verse-form &quot;kviðuháttr&quot; by studying the Rök runestone in present-day Sweden, which dates from around the year 800.

=== The Ynglings in other sources ===
&quot;Ynglingatal&quot; is preserved in its entirety in Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, which Snorri wrote based on the poem. In the saga, Snorri expanded his text by quoting from the poem in addition to his own text. A stanza from &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; is also quoted in Þáttr Ólafs Geirstaða Alfs. Stories that build on the poem are found in the Norwegian history, &quot;Historia Norvegiæ&quot;, which was written in Latin in the late 1100s, and in the short saga &quot;Af Upplendinga konungum&quot; (About the upplander-kings). &quot;Ynglingtal&quot; is also indirectly preserved as a list of names in &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; from the early 1100s. A few of the characters in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; are also mentioned in the Old English poem Beowulf.

== About the author ==
According to Snorri, &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; was composed by the scald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir, who was from Kvinesdal in what is now Vest-Agder, Norway. In the preamble to the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, Snorri writes that Thjodolf, in addition to composing the poem &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, was poet at Harald Fairhair&#x27;s &quot;hird&quot; (royal retinue).

Thjodolf also appears in the Saga of Harald Fairhair, in the mythical story of Harald and the Sami girl Snæfrithr Svásadottir, who cursed Harald to marry her. According to the saga, Harald and Snøfrid had four sons but Harald sent them away when he woke up from the curse. Thjodolf raised one of these sons, Gudrod Ljome. When Thjodolf learned Harald had disowned his sons, he sided with the boys and said to Harald, &quot;They probably would have liked better ancestry, if you had given them that&quot;. The saga contains no information about Thjodolf being Harald&#x27;s scald; that is only mentioned in Snorri&#x27;s preamble. In the saga he is only referred to as a friend of Harald and as the son whom Godred fostered. Snorri also quotes several other poems of Thjodolf in Harald Fairhair&#x27;s saga.

The historian Claus Krag proposes that the connection between Harald Fairhair and Thjodolf was constructed by Snorri, probably because Thjodolf would have been an important person in the development of scaldic art, while according to tradition, Harald was Norway&#x27;s first national king. To create a connection between them would thus enhance both their reputations. According to Finnur Jonsson, Thjodolf was Harald&#x27;s scald without dwelling much on the subject. Finnur said Thjodolf was not a hird scald, but a scald who mostly stayed home on the farm, where in another saga we meet Thjodolf&#x27;s grandson. Snorri mentions a man named Torgrim from Kvine, &quot;son&quot; to Thjodolf in the Olav Tryggvasson saga. Beyond this there are no more references to Thjodolf in the sagas in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. Snorri wrote the preamble and the saga in the 1220s, over 300 years after Thjodolf should have lived, so any information about him is uncertain.

== Author myth and royal ideology ==
According to the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, Fjolne, the first king described in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, was the son of the god Frey and a giantess named Gerd. The actual poem mentions nothing about this, but since it only survives in citation it may have been mentioned in a lost verse. Frey, the great fertility god in the Nordic countries, entered into a sacred wedding (&quot;Hiero Gamos&quot;) with Gerd, which is retold in the poem &quot;Skírnismál&quot;. The mythological purpose of the holy wedding is to bear a child who is the child of both the parents but is neither god or giant but something completely different that will be the first of a &quot;new&quot; species; a new royal family. With effort and tensions from this, the king, who has high status, is valued above all other people. The author of the myth gives the king a special destiny as the main symbol within the ruling ideology in the Norse-thought universe.

Both major ruling families in Norway, the Ynglings and Earls of Lade, legitimized their statuses by using a wedding myth. Just as Yngling had their legitimacy reinterpreted in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, the &quot;Ladejarlsætt&quot; got its equivalent in the poem &quot;Háleygjatal&quot;, which was written by the Norwegian poet Eyvindr skáldaspillir at the end of the 900s. In Háleygjatal it is Odin and the giantess Skade were of mythological origin, and their son Sæming is the ancestor of Hákon jarl. Both poems were thus used as genealogies and served as mythological propaganda, poetry, and grounds for alliances.

According to religious historian Gro Steinsland, the myth also has an erotic element and is thus a fertility myth that tells of the relationship between the ruler and his &quot;territory&quot;; the scalds describe the land as a sexual, longing giantess who rested in the earl&#x27;s arms. The prince guarantees growth and prosperity in their territory. There may have been a special connection between the king and the fertility goddess in times of crisis he was sacrificed to her. This is seen in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; where Swedes sacrificed King Domalde after a prolonged famine. This is illustrated in Carl Larsson&#x27;s controversial monumental picture &quot;Midvinterblot&quot;, but there are no other sources supporting the sacrificing of a king.

== Content ==
&quot;Ynglingatal&quot; consists of 27 stanzas and a litany of different kings and how they died. It starts with Fjölnir, who according to the Ynglinga saga was the son of Frey. This relationship is not mentioned in the actual poem. Fjolne drowned in a mead tub. The poem continues with his son Sveigðir, who followed a dwarf into a rock and never came out again. Then comes Sveigde&#x27;s son Vanlande, who was strangled by a mare. Vanlande&#x27;s son Visbur was burned alive and his son Domalde was sacrificed by the Swedish chiefs to get a good year&#x27;s harvest. Domalde had his son Domar, who died of illness in Uppsala. Domar&#x27;s son Dyggve also died of illness, and his son Dag the Wise was killed by a slave with a pitchfork when he was out to avenge the death of a sparrow. Dag&#x27;s son Agne was hung by his wife Skjålv, and Agne&#x27;s sons Alaric and Eric killed each other with a bridle when they were out riding. Their sons Yngve and Alf killed each other after being incited by Alf&#x27;s wife Bera.

The poem continues with varying degrees of mythical ways to die. Eventually the Yngling kings walked through the woods from the Svea kingdom to Norway. Here there is a clear break in the series and it is possible Thjodolf is linked here to the Norwegian seed in the Swedish genealogies to provide the Norwegian kings with a divine origin and thus greater legitimacy. The first breeding of the kings of Norway was supposed to have been Halfdan Hvitbeinn, who died in his bed at Toten. According to the poem, his son Eystein was killed on a ship; he was beaten by the boat&#x27;s vessel and fell into the sea. Eystein&#x27;s son Halfdan died in his bed in Borre, where he was buried. Halfdan&#x27;s son Gudrød was killed by the servant of his wife Åsa. The poem ends with Halfdan&#x27;s son Olaf Geirstad-Alf and grandson Ragnvald Heidumhære. Tjodolv dedicated &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; to Ragnvald. The last stanza reads:

: ‘I know that nickname to be the best under the blue sky that a king might have, that Rǫgnvaldr, the steerer of the carriage [RULER], is called ‘High with Honours’.’

According to Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Ynglinga Saga&quot;, Harald Fairhair&#x27;s father Halfdan the Black was the half-brother of Olav Geirstadalv and Harald, and was thus Ragnvald&#x27;s cousin, but neither Harald nor his father Halfdan are mentioned in the poem, so this is probably an attempt by Snorri and other writers to make Harald look more royal. It may have been the Icelandic poet Ari Þorgilsson who constructed the genealogy of the Ynglings and connected Harald Fairhair&#x27;s seed to Ynglingatal. Snorri later developed this to the Ynglinga Saga.

== Debate on the dating ==
The content of Ynglingatal has been interpreted and discussed, mostly during the National Romantic period of the 1800s. Norwegian historians Rudolf Keyser and Peter Andreas Munch held the traditional dating to the late 800s. The same applies to the historian Gustav Storm and the Icelandic philologist Finnur Jonsson. Around the time of World War I, saga literature was subjected to much criticism as a historical source, in Sweden by the brothers Lauritz and Curt Weibull, and in Norway by Halvdan Koht and Edvard Bull. In 1908, German philologist Gustav Neckel said Ynglingatal had to be a construction from the 1100s; Norwegian historian Claus Krag also said this in his book &quot;Ynglingatal and Yngling Saga. A study of historical sources&quot;, and joins Neckel&#x27;s hypothesis.

=== The late hypothesis ===

Claus Krag claimed in 1990 that &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; origin should be dated to the 1100s and that it was based on other royal lists. In a research project during the 1980s Krag&#x27;s attempt to justify the doubt regarding &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; age began to take shape, disregarding the traditional, uncritical acceptance. Krag studied the Yngling tradition&#x27;s place in folklore and the Yngling&#x27;s genealogy in relation to other European royal genealogies and scholarly genealogical works in Iceland.

As an argument, Krag proposed that the first four kings&#x27; deaths represent the cosmology of Greek philosopher Empedocles, with the four classical elements Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, and thus that a euhemeristic vision influenced the description of the first few generations. Krag&#x27;s hypothesis has received serious criticism on several points, and so far &quot;a convincing case has not been made against the authenticity of the poem as a ninth-century creation&quot;.

=== The early dating===

Krag&#x27;s late dating has been challenged. If the saga is a late work of propaganda, it should reasonably have been concluded with Norwegian king Harald Fairhair and not by his largely unknown cousin Ragnvald Heidrumhære, whose meaning seems otherwise to have been lost after 1000. There are places and names in the poem that archeology has shown to have had great importance until the Viking Age, but not later, and thus should not have been stated in a more recent saga. Archeologist Dagfinn Skre is an advocate for these arguments.

According to Swedish researcher Olof Sundquist, Krag bypasses clear signs of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; on a tradition of Swedish area visible in kenning, place names and personal names. Cultural phenomena such as a king who goes to holy places and the memory of a warrior elite can point to ancient human migrations. Sundquist posits the theory that Thjodolf from Kvine composed his works in the 900s and based them on an extant tradition. He also said Empedocles&#x27; cosmology can hardly be argued as evidence of late dating; in that case it would be influenced by Britannia or Franks.

The fact Snorri has reproduced the poem suggests he would probably have known about any falsification a century earlier and refrained from reproducing the erroneous text. &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; also inspired Eyvindr skáldaspillir&#x27;s &quot;Háleygjatal&quot;, which demonstrably was written in the late 900s.

Another argument for early dating comes from the Icelandic philologist Bergsveinn Birgisson, whose doctoral thesis said &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; is not supposed to be a praising poem but an entertainment poem and a warning. He asserts this partly based on the grotesque and often ridiculous ways the kings in the poem die—they often appear to be dishonorable, which is clearly in breach of customs of the praising poem. Bergsveinn says the poem is old but the meaning of the praising poem is constructed by Snorri and other scholars of the Middle Ages. He also says &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; was not originally a genealogy, but is about different families. According to Bergsveinn, the perception or construction of the poem as genealogy originates from the High Middle Ages.

=== A middle ground ===
Swedish archeologist Svante Norr argues for an intermediate position for dating &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;. He said it is neither an authentic poem of the Viking Age nor a text from the Middle Ages. Norr accepts the traditional dating of poems &quot;origin&quot;, but says the poem was sung for the more than 300 years until it was written down gradually, and must have undergone major changes to fit it into contemporaneous social conditions. According to Norr, genealogical poems cannot be used as historical sources because they depend on extant ideological, political and social conditions. He says the poem must be viewed as a development and a result of a long process of change. The Norwegian archaeologist Bjørn Myhre joins largely to Norr&#x27;s standpoint.

== Yngling ==
The meaning of term &quot;yngling&quot; is usually interpreted as &quot;descendants of Yngve&quot;, but as in modern Nordic, it can also mean &quot;young man&quot;. In skaldic poems, the word &quot;yngling&quot; is only used in the singular; only in the sagas has it has been used in the plural &quot;Ynglings&quot;; thus the ynglings of the poem cannot be defined as one family. The term may be a kenning, a euphemism, for the prince or king and not something connected with a particular family. Bergsveinn Birgisson says &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; is not a genealogy, but a poem about people from different clans. Not all sources agree; in &quot;Historia Norvegiæ&quot;, &quot;About Uplanders kings&quot; and &quot;Íslendingabók&quot;, several of the kings of other names than in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; or are said to live on or be buried elsewhere. Finnur Jonsson said the various descriptions stem from the kings mentioned in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;; all have different traditions handed down by word of mouth. He said Thjodolf&#x27;s poem is an attempt at a synthesis of different oral traditions about different kings.

===Euhemerism===
According to Snorri, the Yngling stemmed from the gods Yngve-Frey and Odin. This kinship, a euhemerism, is not left in the poem; only Snorri&#x27;s words support this. Finnur Jonsson said he thought this song originally contained several verses and started with Yngve. Religion historian Walter Baetke said &quot;Yngligatal&quot; was free of euhemerism—the notion of lineage of gods was added in the Christian era. Claus Krag said the first kings of the poem are historicized gods, and that the hypothesis of lost stanzas may be rejected.

===Historical accuracy===
Opinions differ on whether breedings were historical figures. If all the kings in this poem really existed, the first of them must have lived in the Migration Period. It is usually only the &quot;Norwegian&quot; part of Ynglings—from Halfdan Hvitbeinn—that scientists have tried to prove or disprove were real, historical persons. They partly reasoned that people in Norse times kept track of their genus for six generations, thus it is possible to follow Harald Fairhair&#x27;s ancestors back to Halfdan Hvitbeinn. Norwegian historians and archeologists have traditionally held the Norwegian Ynglings to be historical people.

Because of problems with dating, it is problematic to work out when these people might have lived. Are Frode, in the 1100s, was probably the first person who tried to convert the dates from relative time stamps to absolute chronological dates on the basis of Jesus&#x27; birth; the reckoning began to be used during the Middle Ages and is still in use. Are dated Harald Fairhair&#x27;s birth to 848, and until the 1920s historians used Are&#x27;s reckoning to calculate the composition time stamp for different people and events. In 1921 historian Halvdan Koht introduced generation counting and his method became the dominant one. In 1964, Icelandic historian Ólafía Einarsdóttir found the old Icelandic reckoning more accurate; with adjustments this has since been the most commonly used approach.

Traditionally, historians have attributed great source value to scaldic poems because of the tight form that made them easier to remember than narratives. If &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; is really from the late 800s, recent events would be relatively close in time to the scald, and there is a high likelihood the poem renders information about real people and events. Nevertheless, there is a distance of 500 years from Halfdan Hvitbeinn to Snorri, and 250 years from the poem&#x27;s composition to the time Snorri wrote it down. Whether the original poem is preserved is uncertain. If &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; is younger, perhaps dating from the end of the 1100s as Krag says, its value as a source of real events shrinks further. According to Fidjestøl, the scald&#x27;s main task was to express the Kingdom&#x27;s official ideology, not necessarily render the facts.

Archeologists, particularly Anton Wilhelm Brøgger in the early 1900s, have made many attempts to &quot;place&quot; the various youth kings and their wives in barrows in Vestfold. The most famous examples are the Queen Åsa in Oseberghaugen outside Tønsberg and Olaf Geirstad-Alf in Gokstadhaugen outside Sandefjord. In addition, archeologists have said the remains of Eystein Halfdansson, Halfdan the Mild, Gudrød the Hunter, and Halfdan the Black are located at Borrehaugene outside Horten. When the issue of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;″s value as a source and recent archeological methods including C14 dating and dendrochronology are taken into account, finding out who was buried in the various barrows on the basis of information in this poem is at best educated guessing.

=== Yngling as common European tradition ===
In 1943, Danish historian Niels Lukmann said the Nordic folklore tradition, of which Yngling is a part, originated from the migration period and that people have historically not been Nordic figures. According to Lukmann, poems and legends about the Danish clans Scylding and Skilfings, which have much in common with the Ynglings, are part of a tradition from the migration period that really dealt with Huns and Heruli kings, and which has gradually evolved into legends known from the Norse period. Krag says this also fits with the Ynglings and he argues for many similarities in names, people and events.

<text>In Japanese folklore, the , literally translating to &quot;child of hammer&quot;, is a snake-like being. The name &quot;tsuchinoko&quot; is prevalent in Western Japan, including Kansai and Shikoku; the creature is known as in Northeastern Japan.

==Description==
Tsuchinoko are described as being between in length, similar in appearance to a snake, but with a central girth that is much wider than its head or tail, and as having fangs and venom similar to that of a viper. Some accounts also describe the tsuchinoko as being able to jump up to in distance followed immediately by a second jump while still in the air.

According to legend, some tsuchinoko have the ability to speak and a propensity for lying, and they are also said to have a taste for alcohol. Legend records that it will sometimes swallow its own tail so that it can roll like a wheel, similarly to the &quot;hoop snake&quot; of American legend.

==Sightings==
In the late 1980s, a wave of purported sightings of the tsuchinoko was reported across Japan, primarily in the village of Shimokitayama in Nara Prefecture. In 1988, Kazuo Nozaki, a member of Shimokitayama&#x27;s village council, launched a &quot;Tsuchinoko Expedition&quot; to find the creature, which offered 1 million yen ($7,800 at the time) for its live capture and 300,000 yen for a sample of its skin. The expedition was joined by around 200 people from across the country and lasted until the beginning of the Japanese asset price bubble collapse in 1990 without finding evidence of its existence. To commemorate the event, the Shimokitayama Tsuchinoko Park was established in 2023.

=== Tohoku region===
In a mountain close to Lake Towada, sighting of a 30cm creature with similar shape to Tsuchinoko was reported. In 1 April, 2007, a Tsuchinoko-shaped dead body of a snake from a dried grass in a farm located in Ōkura was found.

==Search efforts and bounties==
This is a list of municipalities and companies offering rewards for capturing Tsuchinoko, including those who ended the bounties.
*Chikusa, Hyogo - 2 million yen (bounty ended after merging into Shisō.) 
*Yoshii, Okayama - 20,000,000 yen

<doc id="1074264" wikidata="Q1929014" url="?curid=1074264" title="Glycemic load">
<text>The glycemic load (GL) of food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise a person&#x27;s blood glucose level after it is eaten. One unit of glycemic load approximates the effect of eating one gram of glucose. Glycemic load accounts for how much carbohydrate is in the food and how much each gram of carbohydrate in the food raises blood glucose levels. Glycemic load is based on the glycemic index (GI), and is calculated by multiplying the weight of available carbohydrate in the food (in grams) by the food&#x27;s glycemic index, and then dividing by 100.

==Description==
Glycemic load estimates the impact of carbohydrate intake using the glycemic index while taking into account the amount of carbohydrates that are eaten in a serving. GL is a GI-weighted measure of carbohydrate content. For instance, watermelon has a high GI, but a typical serving of watermelon does not contain many carbohydrates, so the glycemic load of eating it is low. Whereas glycemic index is defined for each type of food, glycemic load can be calculated for any size serving of a food, an entire meal, or an entire day&#x27;s meals.

Glycemic load of a 100 g serving of food can be calculated as its carbohydrate content measured in grams (g), multiplied by the food&#x27;s GI, and divided by 100. For example, watermelon has a GI of 72. A 100 g serving of watermelon has 5 g of available carbohydrates (it contains a lot of water), making the calculation (5 × 72)/100=3.6, so the GL is 3.6. A food with a GI of 90 and 8 g of available carbohydrates has a GL of 7.2 (8 × 90/100=7.2), while a food with a GI of just 6 and with 120 g of carbohydrate also has a GL of 7.2 (120 × 6/100=7.2).

For one serving of a food, a GL of 20 or greater is considered high, a GL of 11–19 is considered medium, and a GL of 10 or less is considered low. Foods that have a low GL in a typical serving size almost always have a low GI. Foods with an intermediate or high GL in a typical serving size range from a very low to very high GI.

One 2007 study has questioned the value of using glycemic load as a basis for weight-loss programmes. Das et al. conducted a study on 36 healthy, overweight adults, using a randomised test to measure the efficacy of two diets, one with a high glycemic load and one with a low GL. The study concluded that there is no statistically significant difference between the outcome of the two diets.

Glycemic load appears to be a significant factor in dietary programs targeting metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and weight loss; studies have shown that sustained spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels may lead to increased diabetes risk. The Shanghai Women&#x27;s Health Study concluded that women whose diets had the highest glycemic index were 21 percent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than women whose diets had the lowest glycemic index. Similar findings were reported in the Black Women&#x27;s Health Study. A diet program that manages the glycemic load aims to avoid sustained blood-sugar spikes and can help avoid onset of type 2 diabetes. For diabetics, glycemic load is a highly recommended tool for managing blood sugar.

The data on GI and GL listed in this article is from the University of Sydney (Human Nutrition Unit) GI database.

The GI was invented in 1981 by Dr Thomas Wolever and Dr David Jenkins at the University of Toronto and is a measure of how quickly a food containing 25 or 50 g of carbohydrate raises blood-glucose levels. Because some foods typically have a low carbohydrate content, Harvard researchers created the GL, which takes into account the amount of carbohydrates in a given serving of a food and so provides a more useful measure. Liu et al. were the first to show that based on their calculation, the glycemic load of a specific food—calculated as the product of that food&#x27;s carbohydrate content and its glycemic index value—has direct physiologic meaning in that each unit can be interpreted as the equivalent of 1 g carbohydrate from white bread (or glucose depending on the reference used in determining the glycemic index). It became immediately apparent that such direct physiological quantification of glycemic load would allow patients with diabetes to do &quot;glycemic load&quot; counting as opposed to the conventional &quot;carbohydrate counting&quot; for monitoring the glycemic effect of foods. The concept of glycemic load addresses the concern about rating foods as good or bad solely on the basis of their glycemic index. For example, although the glycemic index for carrots is 19 raw and 47 boiled, the glycemic load for one serving of carrots is small because the amount of carbohydrate in one serving of carrots is minimal (≈7 g carbohydrate). Indeed, ≈700 g carrots (which provides 50 g carbohydrate) must be eaten to produce an incremental glucose response of bread (50-95)

==List of foods and their glycemic load for a 100 g serving==
:&quot;All numeric values provided in the table are approximate. Note that 100 g may not represent a typical serving size. For example, a typical rice serving would be 150–200 g with a corresponding increase in GL, whilst a banana may weigh more than 100 g. Reference tables which give GL by typical serving size will show different values.&quot;

<text>Þjóðólfr ór Hvini (; anglicized as Thjódólf of Hvinir or Thiodolf; fl. late 9th–early 10th c. AD), was a Norwegian skald, said to have been one of the court-poets of the Norwegian king Harald Fairhair. His name suggests that he was from the region of Hvinir (Kvinesdal). Two skaldic poems, &quot;Haustlǫng&quot; (Autumn-long) and &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; (Enumeration of the Ynglingar), are generally attributed to him. 

==Saga account==

According to Heimskringla, he fostered Harald&#x27;s sons Sigurd Hrisi, Halfdan Long-Leg, Gudröd the Radiant, Ragnvald Rettilbein.

== Works ==
Both &quot;Haustlǫng&quot; and &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; are ascribed to Þjóðólfr of Hvinir from a relatively early period. They were preserved, along with some of his other verses, by the 13th-century Icelandic writer Snorri Sturluson in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. A third poem, &quot;Hrafnsmál&quot;, is also attributed to him by Snorri, although scholars rather think that it was composed by another of Harald Fairhair&#x27;s court-poets named Þórbjǫrn Hornklofi.

Þjóðólfr composed &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; for Ragnvald Heidumhære, a chieftain from Vestfold (Oslofjord). The poem tells about the lives of the Ynglingar, a dynasty of kings from Uppsala, and forms the basis for Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;.

What we have preserved of &quot;Haustlǫng&quot; is centred on two mythological scenes: Loki&#x27;s betraying of Iðunn, the Æsir&#x27;s &quot;old-age cure&quot;, which was snatched from them by the jǫtunn Þjazi in eagle form; and Thor&#x27;s victorious combat against the strongest of the jǫtnar, Hrungnir. If &quot;Haustlǫng&quot; was composed in emulation of Bragi inn gamli&#x27;s &quot;Ragnarsdrápa&quot;, as seems likely, then it will have had two further episodes.

In 1989, the school&#x27;s higher education program was accredited by the Council of Higher Education of Puerto Rico on August 18, 1989.

The university is sponsored by and affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and is situated within of mountainous land with a view of the Atlantic Ocean. AAU offers undergraduate studies in arts and sciences, and graduate studies in arts.

Antillean Adventist University has its roots in Cuba of the early 1900s. After a disrupted educational attempt in 1911, the school became established in 1923. In 1939, the Inter-American Division of Seventh-day Adventists decided to move the campus to Santa Clara from Bartle, Oriente Province and to upgrade the institution to that of a junior college. It was the only educational institution in the Antillian Union which offered courses in Spanish above the primary grades. At the time, the Antillian Union of Seventh-day Adventists included the Bahamas, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Haiti, and Jamaica.

===The Battle of Santa Clara===
The Cuban Revolution&#x27;s decisive Battle of Santa Clara in December 1958, took place within a few miles of Antillian College. Walter J. Brown, then president of the college, provided an eyewitness account for the Adventist flagship journal, the &quot;Review and Herald&quot;. The battle took place in the last days of December, 1958. Bombing had destroyed transportation routes causing two hundred of the college&#x27;s students to remain on campus during the Christmas season. Across the road from the college was Central University.

On Saturday, December 27, the college cancelled all their many activities off campus. Special prayers were offered for protection and the return of peace to the nation. Around midnight, Saturday night, two barbudos from Ernesto (Che) Guevara column were posted to guard the college&#x27;s building. Others had taken over the university across the highway from them. The college folk went to see these famous &quot;men from the hills.&quot; The two bearded and armed barbudos were very tired, yet confident of their cause. They soon discovered that the college folk were not hostile to them. Charles R. Taylor, of the Bible department, obtained a sleeping bag. The two soldiers took turns sleeping in it. The college folk went to the university entrance. There they found a large number of rebels. The rebels were tired and hungry but friendly. They were offered cold milk from the college dairy, for which they expressed their gratitude. 
Brown further recounted, &quot;We walked to the university campus and there found the commander, Dr. Ernesto (Che) Guevara (who had previously been befriended by Adventist), with an assistant looking over the map of the city. He soon came over and spoke with us, requesting the school to provide food for doctors, nurses, and others who might be coming through during the next few days. When we indicated that we had a problem in obtaining milk and food, he indicated that we were now in the Free Territory of Cuba, and that the rebel soldiers would see to it that we received all that was necessary... At noon of that first day, about one hundred men came in for dinner. Mrs. Pena, our acting matron, had them sit at the tables. Then she explained the procedure in our cafeteria, adding that it is our custom always to ask God to bless the food before we begin to eat. She asked Mr. Santos, our food-factory manager, to pray. As he started, the rebels, who had been sitting down, stood up, turned in Mr. Santos&#x27; direction, and stood in complete silence during the prayer.&quot;

On Wednesday, December 31, the Battle came to the college. They watched a bomber swoop past the university and heard a plane head for the college. It dropped its bomb on College land. For just over an hour planes made machine-gun attacks on the campus. 
The girls, several teachers, and the rebels who had been eating in the dining room, found protection in the laundry located in the girls&#x27; dorm basement. The boys 
fled to the shower rooms in the basement of their dorm. Married families and teachers hid in the lower floor of the new industrial building. Still other students and faculty members, together with some rebels, crowded into the hallways under the reinforced concrete floor of the new library.

The farm manager was on horseback bringing in the cows for milking. A plane went after him. His assistant and a student were out in the field plowing. Because of their tractor&#x27;s noise they did not realize that they were being machine-gunned until after the plane had roared by. Professor Taylor was having his own private devotions in a bamboo grove when he saw a plane head for him. He jumped into a nearby ditch. When the plane persisted in its aim, he swam up the creek, with only his head above water, and remained so until the shooting was over. Everyone prayed. There were no injuries among the people, or the animals. That night the government fell and Castro had won. The rebel doctors and troops were still with them on Thursday, January 1, 1959. One hundred and eighty ate supper with them that night.

A few days later, in a celebration across the road at the university, the college&#x27;s choir took part. (Che) Guevara came and the new premier, Fidel Castro, also was in the audience.
===Move to Puerto Rico===
On New Year&#x27;s Day, 1959, it seemed that the college would be able to continue on with its program in Cuba as the new Cuban leadership allowed it to operate with no restrictions. However, three years later after all other religious institutions had been closed or severely restricted, the new Cuban government closed the school, December 15, 1961. For the 1961–1962 school year, Antillian College had two campuses; one in Cuba, the other in Puerto Rico. By March, 1962, the Cuban government allowed a seminary to continue operating on the Cuban campus. The Puerto Rican campus experienced some rapid growth as the flow of students for the new school year shifted to that school.

===History since 1961===
Antillean Adventist University celebrated 60 years of its founding in a rebranding ceremony on Wednesday, November 17, 2021, where it presented its new official name: Antillean University.

<doc id="1074291" wikidata="Q1265808" url="?curid=1074291" title="Dungloe">
<text>An Clochán Liath, known in English as Dungloe (sometimes misspelled as Dunglow; ), is a town on the west coast of County Donegal in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland. It is the main town in The Rosses and the largest in the Donegal &quot;Gaeltacht&quot;. Dungloe developed as a town in the middle of the 18th century, and now serves as the administrative and retail centre for the west of County Donegal, and in particular The Rosses, with the only mainland secondary school for the area.

==Name==
There is a river at the bottom of the town and years ago the only crossing was over a grey granite slab lying in the riverbed, hence the Irish name of the town, &quot;An Clochán Liath&quot;, which means &quot;the grey stepping-stone&quot;. The bridge was built in 1782.

The name &quot;An Clochán Liath&quot; was formerly anglicised as &quot;Cloghanlea&quot;. The name &quot;Dungloe&quot; or &quot;Dunglow&quot; is believed to come from the Irish &quot;Dún gCloiche&quot;. This name came into common English usage in the later years of the 18th century when the monthly fair, formerly held at &quot;Dún gCloiche&quot; (five miles north of the nascent town) was transferred to &quot;An Clochán Liath&quot;. In time the name of the fair and that of the town were subsumed. Today, &quot;An Clochán Liath&quot; is the only officially recognised name of the town.

==Irish language==
The &quot;Comprehensive Linguistic Survey of the Gaeltacht&quot; (revised) found that only 21.4% of the population of the area spoke Irish on a daily basis.
Despite being officially within the &quot;Gaeltacht&quot;, Irish is not the everyday language of the majority of residents. Just over one-fifth of the population are daily Irish speakers. Nevertheless, there are Irish-speaking areas outside the town and Irish is to be heard regularly in the town.

==Administration==
Dungloe is home to the Dungloe District Court, which covers the west and south-west areas of County Donegal. The local council offices are situated in the Public Services Centre on the Gweedore Road, including an Intreo centre, Citizens Information centre and Donegal County Council office.

There is a Garda station, Donegal County Council office, and a fire station, located on the Main Street.. Also, there are several convenience stores, supermarkets, cafes, pubs and restaurants. The town is the headquarters of The Rosses&#x27; indigenous supermarket chain, The Cope.
The Dungloe Community Hospital campus also contains a hospital, mental health services and a day centre for the elderly.

A visitor centre to Daniel O&#x27;Donnell was opened in 2012 in the town&#x27;s former National Irish Bank building. The visitor centre closed in 2019. 

==Tourism==

The town attracts tourists during July and August when the annual Mary From Dungloe International Festival takes place. It was founded in the 1960s and it has attracted &#x27;special guests&#x27; over the years including Daniel O&#x27;Donnell, Cliff Richard, Gay Byrne and Sharon Shannon. Dungloe Bay and its surrounding hills have also attracted tourists to Dungloe. There is also a festival dedicated to the socialist writer Peadar O&#x27;Donnell in Dungloe each autumn. A little to the north of the town is the site of the ancient church of Templecrone.

==Transport==
The town is serviced by a regional Bus Éireann route and several TFI Local Link routes, as well as a number of private bus companies, both of which provide a link to national Bus Éireann routes through Donegal Town and Letterkenny, and to the north of the county and Derry also.

In 1903, the town was linked, through Dungloe railway station, to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway. However, the station was closed on 3 June 1940 as part of a process that saw the closure of all railways in the county. The company continued to provide coach services to the town via the Lough Swilly Bus Company in the aftermath of the closure of the railways, however this ended in April 2014.

==Religion and popular culture ==

By the standards of a rural &quot;Gaeltacht&quot; area, Dungloe has a significant Protestant minority, many of whom are Presbyterian. This is a result of the Plantation of Ulster in the seventeenth century. However, the town has a large Catholic majority.

Dungloe is mentioned in FX series &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; as the source of the motorcycle club&#x27;s weapons from the True IRA, a fictional representation of the Real IRA.

<text>Alfred Hermann Traeger (2 August 1895 – 31 July 1980), known as Alf Traeger, was an Australian engineer and inventor, chiefly known for the development of the pedal radio used by both the School of the Air and by the Royal Flying Doctor Service.

==Early life and education==
Traeger was born at Glenlee, near Dimboola, Victoria, and raised near and in Adelaide, South Australia, the son of South Australian-born parents. His paternal grandparents had been German migrants to the young colony in 1848.

Traeger attended Balaklava Public School, about north of Adelaide, then Martin Luther School in Flinders Street, Adelaide, followed by two years at Adelaide Technical High School (now Glenunga International High School). From 1912, aged 16, he spent three years at the South Australian School of Mines and Industries, studying mechanical and electrical engineering, earning an Associate Diploma.

At the age of 12, he built a telephone from the farmhouse to a shed, making all of the components himself. He had built his own radio transmitter before graduation from college.

==Early career==
He first worked for the Metropolitan Tramways Trust and the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department, but his application to join the Australian Flying Corps in World War I was refused.

Around 1923 Traeger joined Hannan Bros, repairing motor vehicle generators and other electrical goods. He developed an interest in radio, and obtained an amateur radio operator&#x27;s licence and built his first pedal transmitter-receiver.

== Inventions and business success ==
He was instrumental in the establishment and early success of the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia. During the 1920s, he was contacted by Rev John Flynn to assist in experiments which were to enable remote families access to medical treatment by using radio equipment, on the way to setting up his Australian Inland Mission Aerial Medical Service. From 1926 Traeger worked for Flynn. Northern Territory radio experiments and the first official flight for the service took place in 1928. 

Traeger returned to Adelaide and worked on a transceiver for the network, which had to be small, cheap, durable and easy to operate. He found that a person could drive the generator using bicycle pedals, and he built his transceiver into a box. His famous &quot;pedal wireless&quot; was a pedal-operated generator which provided power for a transceiver. He divided his time between his workshop and the outback, where he also taught radio operating and Morse code.

The first pedal sets were introduced in Queensland in 1929, which had an immediate impact on the isolation felt by people living in remote places. In 1933 Traeger invented a typewriter Morse keyboard as an accessory to the pedal sets, widely used before the invention of telephony. Over time, emergency call systems linked country-dwellers with hospitals, and sets were used by the School of the Air, doctors, ambulances, councils, taxis, airlines and ships.

His first workshop was in the eastern suburb of Kensington Gardens, in 1937 moving to a larger premises at 11 Dudley Road, Marryatville, where it continued to function until his death in 1980.

Traeger&#x27;s invention, along with the ideas and drive of educator Adelaide Miethke, were pivotal in the development of the School of the Air.

He made subsequent refinements to this system: an alphanumeric keyboard was developed which enabled unskilled operators to type their message in plain language, and later developed a voice-capable transceiver. He was assisted by his younger brother, Johann Gustav Traeger, and his father, Johann Hermann Traeger.

The Traeger Transceivers company was founded, and radios were exported to a number of countries: in 1962 pedal sets were sold to Nigeria; in 1970 an educational radio network was sold to Canada. Traeger continued inventing: he designed a turbine-driven car and used solar power to convert salt water to fresh water.

==Family and later life==

He married Olga Emilie Schodde on 11 November 1937, who died in 1948, after the couple had two daughters. On 2 August 1956 he married a young widow, Joyce Edna Mibus, née Traeger (no relation), with whom he had a son and another two daughters.

He died on 31 July 1980 in the eastern suburb of Rosslyn Park and was buried in Centennial Park Cemetery.

==Honours and legacy==
Traeger was awarded an OBE in 1944.

At the Traeger Park sports field in Alice Springs, a plaque and the Royal Flying Doctor Service aeroplane commemorate him.

The electoral district of Traeger (a vast rural and remote electorate created in the 2017 Queensland state electoral redistribution) was named after him in recognition of the significant contribution he made to people living in remote and rural areas in Queensland.

A plaque marks the site of the Traeger workshop at 11 Dudley Road, Marryatville, commissioned by the Kensington &amp; Norwood Historical Society in 1998.

In 1999, the Wakefield Regional Council in South Australia commissioned a sundial and plaque to be placed at the southern entrance to Balaklava. Funding for the project came from the History Trust of South Australia, Wireless Institute of Australia, the 4WD enthusiasts&#x27; associations and the council. The memorial was unveiled on Australia Day, with his widow Joyce Traeger and other family members in attendance.

In 1999, the model of the transceiver known the &quot;Traeger Scout&quot; was still in production, with little change to its design except for the colour of the case since the first model produced. Following the closure of Traeger Transceivers, the model was continued as the &quot;Tracker Scout&quot;, made in Adelaide by Tracker Communications; after they closed, Scout Communications (part of Oz Electronics Manufacturing) in Brisbane continued manufacture.

The Traeger Emergency Roadstrip is on the Stuart Highway in Far North of South Australia.

<doc id="1074340" wikidata="Q2558399" url="?curid=1074340" title="Fontmell Magna">
<text>Fontmell Magna is a village and civil parish in Dorset, England. It is situated in the Blackmore Vale, close to the chalk hills of Cranborne Chase, on the A350 road south of Shaftesbury and north of Blandford Forum. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 734.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Fontmell&quot; is first attested in a fifteenth-century copy of charters from between 871 and 877, as &quot;Funtemel&quot;, and 932, as &quot;Funtmel&quot; and &quot;Funtemel&quot;. It then appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Fontemale&quot;. This name comes from the Common Brittonic words that survive in modern Welsh as (&quot;spring&quot;) and (&quot;bare&quot;); thus it once meant &quot;spring by the bare [hill]&quot;. The name is first attested with the addition of the Latin word (&quot;great&quot;) in 1391, as &quot;Magnam Funtemell&quot;, to distinguish the settlement from Fontmell Parva (&quot;Little Fontmell&quot;, first attested in 1250 as &quot;Parva Funtemel&quot;), which is a few miles southwest in Child Okeford parish.

==History==
Evidence of early human presence occurs in the east and northeast of the parish in the form of earthworks on the chalk hills: these consist of three cross-dykes, a barrow and a mound that is also possibly a barrow.

In 932, King Æthelstan granted an estate at Fontmell to the nuns of Shaftesbury Abbey under the condition that they would sing 50 psalms after Prime and offer masses at Terce, for the king&#x27;s intention.

Of settlements existing within the parish today, the earliest is the main village, which originated before the Norman Conquest. The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded that &quot;Fontemale&quot; was in Sixpenny Hundred; it had 3 mills, 68 households, and the estate&#x27;s lord and tenant-in-chief was Shaftesbury Abbey. A land survey made by the abbey in about 1130–35 shows that the Fontmell Magna estate had 65 tenants, of whom 41 were villeins, each holding between half and one yardland, and the rest were cottagers, each with about four acres. The number of mills had increased to four. A second survey made in about 1170–80 shows the population had increased to 80 tenants, of whom 55 were villeins.

To the west of the main village, the hamlet of Bedchester is also of pre-Conquest origin, though the settlement furthest west in the parish, Hartgrove, wasn&#x27;t recorded before 1254. Hill Farm, over the chalk hills in the east of the parish, first appears in records in 1333.

==Governance==
For local government purposes, since 1 April 2019, the village comes under the unitary authority of Dorset Council.

Fontmell Magna is in The Beacon electoral ward, which extends to Cann in the north, Sutton Waldron in the south and Guy&#x27;s Marsh in the west. The ward, which had a population of 2,277 in the 2011 census, is part of the constituency of North Dorset, and is currently represented in the UK parliament by the Conservative Simon Hoare.

==Geography==
The parish covers and extends from the dip slope of Cranborne Chase in the east, to the area around the settlement of Hartgrove in the Blackmore Vale in the west. From west to east the underlying geology comprises Kimmeridge clay around Hartgrove, a ridge of Lower Greensand east of the Twyford Brook, Gault and Upper Greensand from the valley of the Fontmell Brook eastwards, and then the high chalk escarpment of Cranborne Chase. The chalk hill just outside the village to the east, Fontmell Down, is a nature reserve.

===Climate===
The Met Office has a climate station at Fontmell Magna. Between 1981 and 2010 it recorded an average of of rain per annum, and average temperatures between in January, and in July.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census Fontmell Magna civil parish had 334 dwellings, 319 households and a population of 734.

The population of the parish in the censuses between 1921 and 2011 is shown in the table below:

==Notable buildings==
There are 45 structures within Fontmell Magna civil parish that have been listed by Historic England for their architectural or historical interest. There are no structures listed as Grade I – the designation of highest significance – but the parish church is designated as Grade II*. All the other listings are Grade II. In 1906 Sir Frederick Treves described the church as &quot;one of the handsomest in Dorsetshire&quot;.

==Notable residents==
Lieutenant Philip Salkeld V.C., who was awarded the Victoria Cross for his role in blowing open the Kashmir Gate in Delhi, India, in 1857, was born and grew up in Fontmell Magna, where his father was the rector.

In 1930, art collector Lord Ivor Spencer-Churchill bought the Springhead estate near Fontmell Magna. In 1934, writer and rural revivalist Rolf Gardiner and his wife Marabel bought a cottage on the estate, which they farmed. Gardiner was active in Dorset society, becoming a member of Dorset County Council between 1937–1946, High Sheriff of Dorset 1967–68, President of the Dorset Federation of Young Farmers Clubs 1944–46, a Chairman and then President of the Dorset branch of the Council for the Protection of Rural England between 1957-1972 as well as other rural and landscape committees and working parties.

The Gardiners&#x27; son, orchestral conductor Sir John Eliot Gardiner CBE FKC, was born in Fontmell Magna in 1943.

The village was also home to cinematographer Oswald Morris (1915–2014) in the last twenty years of his life.

<doc id="1074344" wikidata="Q1009428" url="?curid=1074344" title="Drymen">
<text>Drymen (; from ) is a village in the Stirling district of central Scotland. Once a popular stopping place for cattle drovers, it is now favored by visiting tourists given its location near Loch Lomond. The village is centred around a village green, which is an unusual feature in Scottish villages but more common in other parts of the United Kingdom.

==Location==
Drymen is located west of the Campsie Fells and enjoys views to Dumgoyne on the east and to Loch Lomond on the west. The Queen Elizabeth Forest reaches down to the village edge, and the whole area is part of the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park (the first national park in Scotland).

==History==
There is remains of a medieval motte-and-bailey castle in the village.

In the 18th and 19th centuries Drymen was used as a stopover point for Highland cattle drovers as they made their way to and from markets in central Scotland.

One mile from Drymen is the ruins of the country house Buchanan Castle, owned by the Duke of Montrose, which was also used as a hospital in World War II, and which housed Nazi senior officer Rudolf Hess. At one time the estate was also home to the seat of Clan Graham.

The Clachan Inn, which was first licensed in 1734 claims to be one of the oldest pubs in Scotland. The first licensee of the inn is said to be Rob Roy MacGregor&#x27;s sister Mistress Gow.

==Village today==
Despite the growth in the numbers of villagers commuting to Glasgow to work, there remains an agricultural tradition in the area. Every year, in early summer, an agricultural show is held in the fields around the Endrick Water.

It is often used as an overnight stop for hikers on the West Highland Way, and forms the western end of the Rob Roy Way. There are a couple of pubs and a walkers&#x27; shop.

In 2019 planning permission was given for a residential development for over eighty new homes. As part of the development a financial contribution was made for improvements for the local primary school to increase its capacity.

== Notable people ==

* Duncan Macfarlan, minister of Drymen church and principal of the University of Glasgow.
* Catherine Roy, decorated World War I military nurse.
* Billy Connolly, lived in the village during the 1970s.

<text>Pigge or Lapigge is a village in the Italian province of Perugia in east central Umbria, stretching from the plain of the Clitunno river up the lower SW flank of Mt. Serano, at 297 m above sea-level. It is a &quot;frazione&quot; of the &quot;comune&quot; of Trevi, which is 3 km NNW. Its population was 463 in 2003.

==History and main sights==
Until at least the middle of the 20th century, the town&#x27;s name was regularly &quot;Lapigge&quot;, still the technically correct form but rapidly falling out by apocope of a perceived article &quot;la&quot; (&quot;the&quot;). The origin of the toponym is in fact &quot;*Lapidie&quot;, from a stone bridge (Latin: &quot;pons lapideus&quot;) which in Roman times carried the Via Flaminia over the Clitumnus river.

Lapigge&#x27;s oldest church is that of the former convent of S. Arcangelo, already mentioned in 1177 as a dependency of San Pietro in Bovara, but suspected by scholars to be considerably older, probably of the Lombard period. It has been much reworked over the centuries; over the main altar a fresco of the Umbrian school can be seen, depicting the Madonna and Child, attributed to Bartolomeo da Miranda. In 1646, an apparition of the Virgin Mary launched the church as a Marian sanctuary; the elegant Baroque belfry and the adjacent cloister date from the 17th century.

The church of S. Bernardino is a small single-apsed building in the Romanesque style, much reworked in the 17th and 18th centuries, with remains of a fresco of the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; dated 1575.

The single-room hexagonal church of S. Maria del Ponte in the lower part of town, though in its present form dating to the 16th century and reworked in the 18th, replaces a medieval church; a medieval church of S. Bartolomeo has also disappeared.

==Transportation==
The main highway bypasses the village.

The nearest train station is at Trevi, Umbria.
