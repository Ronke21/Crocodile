<text>An oxygen sensor (or lambda sensor, where lambda refers to air–fuel equivalence ratio, usually denoted by λ) or probe or , is an electronic device that measures the proportion of oxygen (O2) in the gas or liquid being analyzed.

It was developed by Robert Bosch GmbH during the late 1960s under the supervision of Günter Bauman. The original sensing element is made with a thimble-shaped zirconia ceramic coated on both the exhaust and reference sides with a thin layer of platinum and comes in both heated and unheated forms. The planar-style sensor entered the market in 1990 and significantly reduced the mass of the ceramic sensing element, as well as incorporating the heater within the ceramic structure. This resulted in a sensor that started sooner and responded faster.

The most common application is to measure the exhaust-gas concentration of oxygen for internal combustion engines in automobiles and other vehicles in order to calculate and, if required, dynamically adjust the air-fuel ratio so that catalytic converters can work optimally, and also determine whether the converter is performing properly or not. An oxygen sensor will typically generate up to about 0.9 volts when the fuel mixture is rich and there is little unburned oxygen in the exhaust.

Scientists use oxygen sensors to measure respiration or production of oxygen and use a different approach. Oxygen sensors are used in oxygen analyzers, which find extensive use in medical applications such as anesthesia monitors, respirators and oxygen concentrators.

Divers use oxygen sensors (and often call them ppO2 sensors) to measure the partial pressure of oxygen in their breathing gas. Open circuit scuba divers test the gas before diving as the mixture remains unchanged during the dive and partial pressure changes due to pressure are simply predictable, while mixed gas rebreather divers must monitor the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing loop throughout the dive, as it changes and must be controlled to stay within acceptable bounds.

Oxygen sensors are also used in hypoxic air fire prevention systems to continuously monitor the oxygen concentration inside the protected volumes.

There are many different ways of measuring oxygen. These include technologies such as zirconia, electrochemical (also known as galvanic), infrared, ultrasonic, paramagnetic, and very recently, laser methods.

==Automotive applications==
Automotive oxygen sensors, colloquially known as O2 (&quot;ō two&quot;) sensors, make modern electronic fuel injection and emission control possible. They help determine, in real time, whether the air–fuel ratio of a combustion engine is rich or lean. Since oxygen sensors are located in the exhaust stream, they do not directly measure the air or the fuel entering the engine, but when information from oxygen sensors is coupled with information from other sources, it can be used to indirectly determine the air–fuel ratio. Closed-loop feedback-controlled fuel injection varies the fuel injector output according to real-time sensor data rather than operating with a predetermined (open-loop) fuel map. In addition to enabling electronic fuel injection to work efficiently, this emissions control technique can reduce the amounts of both unburnt fuel and oxides of nitrogen entering the atmosphere. Unburnt fuel is pollution in the form of air-borne hydrocarbons, while oxides of nitrogen (NO&quot;x&quot; gases) are a result of combustion chamber temperatures exceeding 1300 kelvins, due to excess air in the fuel mixture thereby contributing to smog and acid rain. Volvo was the first automobile manufacturer to employ this technology in the late 1970s, along with the three-way catalyst used in the catalytic converter.

The sensor does not actually measure oxygen concentration, but rather the difference between the amount of oxygen in the exhaust gas and the amount of oxygen in the air. Rich mixture causes an oxygen demand. This demand causes the voltage output to rise, due to transportation of oxygen ions through the sensor layer. Lean mixture causes low voltage, since there is an oxygen excess.

Modern spark-ignited combustion engines use oxygen sensors and catalytic converters in order to reduce exhaust emissions. Information on oxygen concentration is sent to the engine management computer or engine control unit (ECU), which adjusts the amount of fuel injected into the engine to compensate for excess air or excess fuel. The ECU attempts to maintain, on average, a certain air-fuel ratio by interpreting the information gained from the oxygen sensor. The primary goal is a compromise between power, fuel economy, and emissions, and in most cases is achieved by an air–fuel ratio close to stoichiometric. For spark-ignition engines (such as those that burn gasoline or autogas / liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), as opposed to diesel), the three types of emissions modern systems are concerned with are: hydrocarbons (which are released when the fuel is not burnt completely, such as when misfiring or running rich), carbon monoxide (which is the result of running slightly rich) and NO&quot;x&quot; (which dominate when the mixture is lean). Failure of these sensors, either through normal aging, the use of leaded fuels, or fuel contaminated with silicones or silicates, for example, can lead to damage of an automobile&#x27;s catalytic converter and expensive repairs.

Tampering with or modifying the signal that the oxygen sensor sends to the engine computer can be detrimental to emissions control and can even damage the vehicle. When the engine is under low-load conditions (such as when accelerating very gently or maintaining a constant speed), it is operating in &quot;closed-loop mode&quot;. This refers to a feedback loop between the ECU and the oxygen sensor(s) in which the ECU adjusts the quantity of fuel and expects to see a resulting change in the response of the oxygen sensor. This loop forces the engine to operate both slightly lean and slightly rich on successive loops, as it attempts to maintain a mostly stoichiometric ratio on average. If modifications cause the engine to run moderately lean, there will be a slight increase in fuel efficiency, sometimes at the expense of increased NO&quot;x&quot; emissions, much higher exhaust gas temperatures, and sometimes a slight increase in power that can quickly turn into misfires and a drastic loss of power, as well as potential engine and catalytic-converter (due to the misfires) damage, at ultra-lean air–fuel ratios. If modifications cause the engine to run rich, then there will be a slight increase in power to a point (after which the engine starts flooding from too much unburned fuel), but at the cost of decreased fuel efficiency, and an increase in unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust, which causes overheating of the catalytic converter. Prolonged operation at rich mixtures can cause catastrophic failure of the catalytic converter (see backfire). The ECU also controls the spark engine timing along with the fuel-injector pulse width, so modifications that cause the engine to operate either too lean or too rich may result in inefficient fuel consumption whenever fuel is ignited too soon or too late in the combustion cycle.

When an internal combustion engine is under high load (e.g. wide open throttle), the output of the oxygen sensor is ignored, and the ECU automatically enriches the mixture to protect the engine, as misfires under load are much more likely to cause damage. This is referred to as an engine running in &quot;open-loop mode&quot;. Any changes in the sensor output will be ignored in this state. In many cars (with the exception of some turbocharged models), inputs from the air flow meter are also ignored, as they might otherwise lower engine performance due to the mixture being too rich or too lean, and increase the risk of engine damage due to detonation if the mixture is too lean.

===Function of an O2 sensor===
O2 sensors provide feedback to an engine computer (ECU). Where applicable, gasoline, propane, and natural gas engines are fitted with three-way catalysts to comply with on road vehicle emissions legislation. Using the O2 sensor signal, the ECU can operate the engine with an air–fuel ratio very close to 14.7:1, which is the ideal operating mixture for a three way catalyst to be effective. Robert Bosch GmbH introduced the first automotive lambda sensor in 1976, and it was first used by Volvo and Saab in that year. The sensors were introduced in the US from about 1979 and were required on all models of cars in many countries in Europe in 1993.

===The probe===

The sensor element is a ceramic cylinder plated inside and outside with porous platinum electrodes; the whole assembly is protected by a metal gauze. It operates by measuring the difference in oxygen between the exhaust gas and the external air and generates a voltage or changes its resistance depending on the difference between the two.

The sensors only begin to work effectively when heated to approximately 316 °C (600 °F), so most newer lambda probes have heating elements encased in the ceramic that bring the ceramic tip up to temperature quickly. Older probes, without heating elements, would eventually be heated by the exhaust, but there is a time lag between when the engine is started and when the components in the exhaust system come to a thermal equilibrium. The length of time required for the exhaust gases to bring the probe to temperature depends on the temperature of the ambient air and the geometry of the exhaust system. Without a heater, the process may take several minutes. There are pollution problems that are attributed to this slow start-up process, including a similar problem with the working temperature of a catalytic converter.

The probe typically has four wires attached to it: two for the lambda output, and two for the heater power, although some automakers use the metal case as ground for the sensor element signal, resulting in three wires. Earlier non-electrically-heated sensors had one or two wires.

===Operation of the probe===

====Zirconia sensor====

The zirconium dioxide, or zirconia, lambda sensor is based on a solid-state electrochemical fuel cell called the Nernst cell. Its two electrodes provide an output voltage corresponding to the quantity of oxygen in the exhaust relative to that in the atmosphere.

An output voltage of 0.2 V (200 mV) DC represents a &quot;lean mixture&quot; of fuel and oxygen, where the amount of oxygen entering the cylinder is sufficient to fully oxidize the carbon monoxide (CO), produced in burning the air and fuel, into carbon dioxide (CO2). An output voltage of 0.8 V (800 mV) DC represents a &quot;rich mixture&quot;, which is high in unburned fuel and low in remaining oxygen. The ideal setpoint is approximately 0.45 V (450 mV) DC. This is where the quantities of air and fuel are in the optimal ratio, which is ~0.5% lean of the stoichiometric point, such that the exhaust output contains minimal carbon monoxide.

The voltage produced by the sensor is nonlinear with respect to oxygen concentration. The sensor is most sensitive near the stoichiometric point (where λ = 1) and less sensitive when either very lean or very rich.

The ECU is a control system that uses feedback from the sensor to adjust the fuel/air mixture. As in all control systems, the time constant of the sensor is important; the ability of the ECU to control the fuel–air ratio depends upon the response time of the sensor. An aging or fouled sensor tends to have a slower response time, which can degrade system performance. The shorter the time period, the higher the so-called &quot;cross count&quot; and the more responsive the system.

The sensor has a rugged stainless-steel construction internally and externally. Due to this the sensor has a high resistance to corrosion, allowing it to be used effectively in aggressive environments with high temperature/pressure.

The zirconia sensor is of the &quot;narrow-band&quot; type, referring to the narrow range of fuel/air ratios to which it responds.

====Wideband zirconia sensor====

A variation on the zirconia sensor, called the &quot;wideband&quot; sensor, was introduced by NTK in 1992 and has been widely used for car engine management systems in order to meet the ever-increasing demands for better fuel economy, lower emissions and better engine performance at the same time. It is based on a planar zirconia element, but also incorporates an electrochemical gas pump. An electronic circuit containing a feedback loop controls the gas-pump current to keep the output of the electrochemical cell constant, so that the pump current directly indicates the oxygen content of the exhaust gas. This sensor eliminates the lean–rich cycling inherent in narrow-band sensors, allowing the control unit to adjust the fuel delivery and ignition timing of the engine much more rapidly. In the automotive industry this sensor is also called a &quot;UEGO&quot; (universal exhaust-gas oxygen) sensor. UEGO sensors are also commonly used in aftermarket dyno tuning and high-performance driver air–fuel display equipment. The wideband zirconia sensor is used in stratified fuel injection systems and can now also be used in diesel engines to satisfy the upcoming EURO and ULEV emission limits.

Wideband sensors have three elements:
# ion oxygen pump,
# narrowband zirconia sensor,
# heating element.

The wiring diagram for the wideband sensor typically has six wires:
# resistive heating element,
# resistive heating element,
# sensor,
# pump,
# calibration resistor,
# common.

====Titania sensor====

A less common type of narrow-band lambda sensor has a ceramic element made of titania (titanium dioxide). This type does not generate its own voltage, but changes its electrical resistance in response to the oxygen concentration. The resistance of the titania is a function of the oxygen partial pressure and the temperature. Therefore, some sensors are used with a gas-temperature sensor to compensate for the resistance change due to temperature. The resistance value at any temperature is about 1/1000 the change in oxygen concentration. Luckily, at λ = 1, there is a large change of oxygen, so the resistance change is typically 1000 times between rich and lean, depending on the temperature.

As titania is an N-type semiconductor with a structure TiO2−&quot;x&quot;, the &quot;x&quot; defects in the crystal lattice conduct the charge. So, for fuel-rich exhaust (lower oxygen concentration) the resistance is low, and for fuel-lean exhaust (higher oxygen concentration) the resistance is high. The control unit feeds the sensor with a small electric current and measures the resulting voltage drop across the sensor, which varies from nearly 0 volts to about 5 volts. Like the zirconia sensor, this type is nonlinear, such that it is sometimes simplistically described as a binary indicator, reading either &quot;rich&quot; or &quot;lean&quot;. Titania sensors are more expensive than zirconia sensors, but they also respond faster.

In automotive applications the titania sensor, unlike the zirconia sensor, does not require a reference sample of atmospheric air to operate properly. This makes the sensor assembly easier to design against water contamination. While most automotive sensors are submersible, zirconia-based sensors require a very small supply of reference air from the atmosphere. In theory, the sensor wire harness and connector are sealed. Air that leaches through the wire harness to the sensor is assumed to come from an open point in the harness – usually the ECU, which is housed in an enclosed space like the trunk or vehicle interior.

===Location of the probe in a system===
The probe is typically screwed into a threaded hole in the exhaust system, located after the branch manifold of the exhaust system combines and before the catalytic converter. New vehicles are required to have a sensor before and after the exhaust catalyst to meet U.S. regulations requiring that all emissions components be monitored for failure. Pre- and post-catalyst signals are monitored to determine catalyst efficiency, and if the converter is not performing as expected, an alert gets reported to the user through on-board diagnostics systems by, for example, lighting up an indicator in the vehicle&#x27;s dashboard. Additionally, some catalyst systems require brief cycles of lean (oxygen-containing) gas to load the catalyst and promote additional oxidation reduction of undesirable exhaust components.

===Sensor surveillance===
The air–fuel ratio and naturally, the status of the sensor, can be monitored by means of using an air–fuel ratio meter that displays the output voltage of the sensor.

===Sensor failures===
Normally, the lifetime of an unheated sensor is about 30,000 to 50,000 miles (50,000 to 80,000 km). Heated sensor lifetime is typically 100,000 miles (160,000 km). Failure of an unheated sensor is usually caused by the buildup of soot on the ceramic element, which lengthens its response time and may cause total loss of ability to sense oxygen. For heated sensors, normal deposits are burned off during operation, and failure occurs due to catalyst depletion. The probe then tends to report lean mixture, the ECU enriches the mixture, the exhaust gets rich with carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, and the fuel economy worsens.

Leaded gasoline contaminates the oxygen sensors and catalytic converters. Most oxygen sensors are rated for some service life in the presence of leaded gasoline, but sensor life will be shortened to as little as , depending on the lead concentration. Lead-damaged sensors typically have their tips discolored light rusty.

Another common cause of premature failure of lambda probes is contamination of fuel with silicones (used in some sealings and greases) or silicates (used as corrosion inhibitors in some antifreezes). In this case, the deposits on the sensor are colored between shiny white and grainy light gray.

Leaks of oil into the engine may cover the probe tip with an oily black deposit, with associated loss of response.

An overly rich mixture causes buildup of black powdery deposit on the probe. This may be caused by failure of the probe itself, or by a problem elsewhere in the fuel-rationing system.

Applying an external voltage to the zirconia sensors, e.g. by checking them with some types of ohmmeter, may damage them.

Some sensors have an air inlet to the sensor in the lead, so contamination from the lead caused by water or oil leaks can be sucked into the sensor and cause failure.

Symptoms of a failing oxygen sensor includes:
* sensor light on dash indicates problem,
* increased tailpipe emissions,
* increased fuel consumption,
* hesitation on acceleration,
* stalling,
* rough idling.

==Diving applications==

The type of oxygen sensor used in most underwater diving applications is the electro-galvanic oxygen sensor, a type of fuel cell, which is sometimes called an oxygen analyser or ppO2 meter. They are used to measure the oxygen concentration of breathing gas mixes such as nitrox and trimix. They are also used within the oxygen control mechanisms of closed-circuit rebreathers to keep the partial pressure of oxygen within safe limits. and to monitor the oxygen content of the breathing gas in saturation diving systems and of surface supplied mixed gas. This type of sensor operates by measuring the voltage generated by a small electro-galvanic fuel cell.

==Scientific and production applications==

===Soil respiration===
In soil respiration studies oxygen sensors can be used in conjunction with carbon dioxide sensors to help improve the characterization of soil respiration. Typically, soil oxygen sensors use a galvanic cell to produce a current flow that is proportional to the oxygen concentration being measured. These sensors are buried at various depths to monitor oxygen depletion over time, which is then used to predict soil respiration rates. Generally, these soil sensors are equipped with a built-in heater to prevent condensation from forming on the permeable membrane, as relative humidity can reach 100% in soil.

===Marine biology===
In marine biology or limnology, oxygen measurements are usually done in order to measure respiration of a community or an organism, but have also been used to measure primary production of algae. The traditional way of measuring oxygen concentration in a water sample has been to use wet chemistry techniques e.g. the Winkler titration method. There are however commercially available oxygen sensors that measure the oxygen concentration in liquids with great accuracy. There are two types of oxygen sensors available: electrodes (electrochemical sensors) and optodes (optical sensors).

===Brewing===
In breweries, dissolved oxygen is measured at multiple places within a beer production operation, from DO (dissolved oxygen) control at wort aeration, to measurement with a trace oxygen sensor (low-PPB; low-parts per billion) at the filling line. These measurements are either taken with an in-line dissolved oxygen sensor or a portable dissolved oxygen meter.

===Pharmaceutical production===
Oxygen sensors play a critical role in the production of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients made in a bioreactor by cell culture or fermentation. Because oxygen is important in cellular respiration, the oxygen sensor provides a critical measurement to ensure that cells in the bioreactor are getting the oxygen needed to maximize production. The accuracy of the oxygen sensor is critical, as a lack of oxygen negatively impacts productivity and excess oxygen can lead to changes in cell metabolism. In bioreactors, oxygen sensors can be installed vertically or at an angle. For vertical installations, angled-tip oxygen sensors help to provide accurate readings.

==Oxygen sensor technologies==

===Electrodes===
The Clark-type electrode is the most used oxygen sensor for measuring oxygen dissolved in a liquid. The basic principle is that there is a cathode and an anode submersed in an electrolyte. Oxygen enters the sensor through a permeable membrane by diffusion and is reduced at the cathode, creating a measurable electric current.

There is a linear relationship between the oxygen concentration and the electric current. With a two-point calibration (0% and 100% air saturation), it is possible to measure oxygen in the sample.

One drawback to this approach is that oxygen is consumed during the measurement with a rate equal to the diffusion in the sensor. This means that the sensor must be stirred in order to get the correct measurement and avoid stagnant water. With an increasing sensor size, the oxygen consumption increases and so does the stirring sensitivity. In large sensors there tend to also be a drift in the signal over time due to consumption of the electrolyte.
However, Clark-type sensors can be made very small with a tip size of 10 μm. The oxygen consumption of such a microsensor is so small that it is practically insensitive to stirring and can be used in stagnant media such as sediments or inside plant tissue.

===Optodes===
An oxygen optode is a sensor based on optical measurement of the oxygen concentration. A chemical film is glued to the tip of an optical cable, and the fluorescence properties of this film depend on the oxygen concentration. Fluorescence is at a maximum when there is no oxygen present. The higher the concentration of oxygen, the shorter the lifetime of the fluorescence. When an O2 molecule comes along, it collides with the film, and this quenches the photoluminescence. In a given oxygen concentration there will be a specific number of O2 molecules colliding with the film at any given time, and the fluorescence properties will be stable.

The signal (fluorescence) to oxygen ratio is not linear, and an optode is most sensitive at low oxygen concentration. That is, the sensitivity decreases as oxygen concentration increases, following the Stern–Volmer relationship. The optode sensors can, however, work in the whole region 0% to 100% oxygen saturation in water, and the calibration is done the same way as with the Clark-type sensor. No oxygen is consumed, and hence the sensor is insensitive to stirring, but the signal will stabilize more quickly if the sensor is stirred after being put in the sample. These type of electrode sensors can be used for in situ and real-time monitoring of oxygen production in water-splitting reactions. The platinized electrodes can accomplish the real-time monitoring of hydrogen production in water-splitting device.

Planar optodes are used to detect the spatial distribution of oxygen concentrations in a platinized foil. Based on the same principle than optode probes, a digital camera is used to capture fluorescence intensities over a specific area.

<text>Open University Malaysia, abbreviated as OUM, is the 7th private university in Malaysia. It is owned by Multimedia Technology Enhancement Operations (METEOR) Sdn. Bhd, a consortium of 11 Malaysian public universities.

The main campus is located at Menara OUM, Kelana Centre Point, Kelana Jaya, Selangor. Additionally, there are more than 30 learning centres throughout Malaysia, out of which 10 are regional learning centres.

== History ==

During the 1990s a rising delivery method gaining popularity and frequently discussed was the Open and Distance Education concept. There was a need to democratise education, paving the way for a wider population to have access to education at an affordable price. Consequently, in August 1999, the Minister of Education called upon Multimedia Technology Enhancement Operations Sdn. Bhd. (METEOR) to establish an open university in Malaysia. METEOR was headed by Tan Sri Dr Abdullah Sanusi Ahmad, who later on became the first Vice-Chancellor of Open University Malaysia. The action taken by the Minister of Education, Dato&#x27; Seri Najib Tun Razak, resulted in the founding of Open University Malaysia (OUM) in August 2000. 

OUM initially opened to 753 learners in 2001 as the first open and distance learning university in the country. OUM was officially launched by the then Prime Minister YAB Dato Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad on August 26, 2002. More than two decades later in 2023, OUM had about 30,000 active students and produced more than 103,000 graduates. In the same year, QS Stars had assessed OUM&#x27;s online learning for three years and granted OUM a 5-Star rating .

== Chancellors ==
Currently, the vice-chancellor of OUM is Prof Dr Ahmad Izanee Awang. The first chancellor was the late Endon Mahmood (the wife of fifth Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi) who was appointed on 16 December 2004. On 8 December 2007, Jeanne Abdullah was appointed as the new chancellor of OUM. The current pro-chancellor is Tan Sri Azman Hashim who is also the executive chairman of Arab-Malaysian Corporation Berhad.

<text>Chlumec nad Cidlinou (; ) is a town in Hradec Králové District in the Hradec Králové Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 5,600 inhabitants.

==Administrative division==
Chlumec nad Cidlinou consists of seven municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Chlumec nad Cidlinou I (733)
*Chlumec nad Cidlinou II (221)
*Chlumec nad Cidlinou III (1,171)
*Chlumec nad Cidlinou IV (2,932)
*Kladruby (207)
*Lučice (172)
*Pamětník (116)
==Etymology==
The town&#x27;s name Chlumec is derived from the old Czech word &quot;chlum&quot;, which meant a hill covered with forest.

==Geography==

Chlumec nad Cidlinou is located about west of Hradec Králové. It lies in a flat landscape of the East Elbe Table. The highest point is at above sea level. The town is situated at the confluence of the Cidlina and Bystřice rivers. There are several fishponds in the municipal territory, especially north of the town. The largest of them is Chlumecký.

The nearest neighbourhood is surrounded by gardens and after it the town is sometimes nicknamed &quot;Town in gardens&quot;.

==History==
The first written mention of Chlumec is from 1235 in a deed of King Wenceslaus I. It was located on a trade route from Prague to Kłodzko Land. The village of Lučice, part of Chlumec nad Cidlinou, was first mentioned in 1110.

The Sternberg family owned Chlumec until 1393. During the first half of the 15th century, it belonged to the lords of Bergov, who had built a water castle here. After it belonged to the various nobles and changed owners several times, it was acquired by the Pernštejn family in 1521. During their rule, the estate grew significantly and prospered. The castle was fortified and new Church of Saint Ursula was built. In these times Chlumec was promoted to a town. In 1547, the Chlumec estate was bought by the royal chamber.

From 1611, Chlumec belonged to the Kinsky family. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town was conquered and looted repeatedly. It was badly damaged and the castle was destroyed. After several fires, the castle was not renewed and new aristocratic residence was built – the Karlova Koruna Chateau. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the town recovered and crafts flourished.

The town developed rapidly before World War I. Several public buildings were built, including the impressive Neo-Renaissance school.

==Demographics==
==Transport==
The D11 motorway runs south of the town.

Chlumec nad Cidlinou is located on the interregional railway line Prague–Trutnov. It is also the starting point of the lines to Hradec Králové and to Městec Králové.

==Sights==
The Karlova Koruna Chateau is the most notable landmark of the town. It was built for František Ferdinand Kinsky between 1721 and 1723 with the basic architectural design drafted by Jan Santini Aichel and with the participation in the building process of František Maxmilián Kaňka. The chateau is surrounded by a castle park. The castle chapel in the park is Chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary which was built in 1741–1745.

The Church of the Holy Trinity is the oldest monument in the town. According to the foundation stone, it was built in 1134. The first written mention is from 1358. Until the early 20th century, it was a cemetery church. The building has a flat ceiling with a triangular presbytery and a wooden prismatic tower. An interior figuration came from the 17th century. Around outer presbytery walls there are placed Empire styled tombs from around 1800. The church was rebuilt many times and today it is considered a styleless construction. The Zubatovská Chapel is a Neoclassical chapel from 1836–1842 is located in the former cemetery, which is today a municipal park.

Church of Saint Ursula was built in 1536–1543. It mixes late Gothic and Renaissance styles. Today&#x27;s appearance is the result of repairs after three fires in the 17th century. The interior is in the Rococo style after the fire in 1774.

<text>Androtion (; before 405after 346 BC), was a Greek orator, and one of the leading politicians of his time. He was born between 415 and 405 BC, the son of Andron, who was a member of the Four Hundred and an associate of Theramenes. Androtion was probably Andron&#x27;s first son, and seems to have inherited his fortune. In the late 390s or early 380s BC, he studied under Isocrates. He may have been the author of a work on agriculture which survives in fragmentary form.

Androtion began his political career not long before 385, and the first position we can place him as holding is that of epistates, some time in the 370s BC. Androtion held various other positions during his career, including governing Arkesine on Amorgos for at least two years up to 357–6, and being a member of the boule in 356/5 BC.

In 355–4, Androtion was brought to trial by Euktemon and Diodorus, accused of illegally proposing a crown be awarded to the Council of Five Hundred at the end of its term of office. The prosecution speech, composed by Demosthenes, survives as speech &quot;Against Androtion&quot;, and it is a major source of information about his career up to this point. Androtion was acquitted, and was appointed as an ambassador to Mausolus, the ruler of Caria.

He is said to have gone into exile at Megara, and to have composed an &quot;Atthis&quot;, or annalistic account of Attica from the earliest times to his own days (&quot;Pausanias&quot; vi. 7; x. 8). It is disputed whether the annalist and orator are identical. Professor Gaetano De Sanctis (in &quot;L&#x27;Attide di Androzione e un papiro di Oxyrhynchos&quot;, Turin, 1908) attributes to Androtion, the Atthidographer, a 4th-century historical fragment, discovered by B. P. Grenfell and A. S. Hunt (&quot;Oxyrhynchus Papyri&quot;, vol. v.). Strong arguments against this view are set forth by E. M. Walker in the &quot;Classical Review&quot;, May 1908.

<text>Sidalcea oregana&quot; var. &quot;calva, the Wenatchee Mountains checker-mallow, is a very rare flowering plant variety that occurs only in five locations in the Wenatchee Mountains of Chelan County, Washington, United States. The plant has been placed on the Endangered species list. As of 2004, the population of the species was 11,000 individual plants.

&quot;Sidalcea oregana&quot; var. &quot;calva&quot; is a perennial herb in the mallow family Malvaceae. The species has a stout taproot that branches at the rootcrown and gives rise to several stems that are 20 to 150 centimeters (8 to 60 inches) tall. Plant stems vary from glabrous (lacking hairs and glands) to pubescent (hairy) or stellate (with star-shaped hairs) below and are finely stellate above. The leaves are somewhat thick and fleshy with long petioles (leaf stalks). The leaves are dimorphic (have two forms) with the lower (basal) leaves having more shallow lobes. The flowers have light- to deep pink petals 1 to 2 centimeters (0.4 to 0.8 inch) long. The flowers are borne on stalks ranging from 1 to 10 millimeters (0.04 to 0.4 inch) in length. The calyx (outer whorl of floral parts) ranges from uniformly finely stellate to bristly with a mixture of longer, simple to four-rayed, spreading hairs sometimes as long as 2.5 to 3 millimeters (0.1 to 0.12 inch).

The inflorescence (arrangement of the flowers) consists of one to several loosely flowered racemes (stalked flowers arranged along a single stem) &quot;S. oregana&quot; var. &quot;calva&quot; is similar in appearance to &quot;S. oregana&quot; var. &quot;procera&quot;, which occurs in the same geographic region. &quot;S. oregana&quot; var. &quot;calva&quot; can be distinguished from var. &quot;procera&quot; by the presence of the hairs on the margins of the calyx lobes and by its large, somewhat fleshy, basal leaves, which are smooth to the touch on both surfaces.

The historical range covered an area of approximately 17.7 by 4.8 kilometers (11 by 3 miles), extending south-southeasterly from Leavenworth, Washington, to the area now known as Camas Meadows. Most of the historical records of this species are based upon occurrences in the Icicle and Peshastin Creek watersheds.

<text>The Mana Māori Movement was a New Zealand political party. It advocated on behalf of the Māori people. It was founded by Eva Rickard, a Māori activist. Rickard was originally a member of Mana Motuhake, another Māori party, but quit when Mana Motuhake joined the Alliance (a broad left-wing coalition). Rickard, believing that an independent Māori party was needed, founded Mana Māori in 1993.

The party contested the with 18 list candidates, and got 4070 votes (0.20%).

Rickard&#x27;s daughter, Angeline Greensill later took over co-leadership of the Mana Māori Movement, the largest wholly Māori party contesting the 2002 New Zealand general election, and incorporated the smaller Te Tawharau and Piri Wiri Tua parties, but did not win any seats. The party received only 4,980 votes (0.25%) in 2002. The emergence of the new Māori Party, founded by sitting MP Tariana Turia, prompted the transfer of support from Mana Māori, and Greensill agreed to temporarily recess the party which was officially deregistered in 2005.

Greensill stood twice for the Māori Party before later joining the breakaway Mana Movement.

<text>Andújar () is a Spanish municipality of 38,539 people (2005) in the province of Jaén, in Andalusia. The municipality is divided by the Guadalquivir River. The northern part of the municipality is where the Natural Park of the Sierra de Andújar is situated. To the south are agricultural fields and countryside. The city proper located on the right bank of the Guadalquivir and the Madrid-Córdoba railway. In the past, Andújar was widely known for its porous earthenware jars, called &quot;alcarrazas&quot; or &quot;botijos&quot;, which keep water cool in the hottest weather, and were manufactured from a whitish clay found in the neighbourhood.

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===
Paleolithic artifacts have been found in the area, associated with the Acheulean Culture, but it is during the Neolithic Age when the area became increasingly populated, with agriculture being developed in the fertile land, and mining activities beginning in the Sierra Morena. 
According to archaeological studies, the first people who inhabited the area where the Oretani, an Iberian people, who founded in the area the town of Isturgi, today occupied by the hamlet of Los Villares de Andújar.

Isturgi should not be identified with the ancient town of Illiturgis, which was situated on the hill called Máquiz (Mengíbar). Nevertheless, &quot;iliturgitano&quot; is used to describe an inhabitant of Andújar. Isturgi had contact with various peoples: Turdetani, Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, and other towns, such as &quot;Obulco&quot; (Porcuna) and Castulo. 
During the times of the Roman Empire, the &quot;Municipium Isturgi Triumphale&quot; was part of the province of Hispania Ulterior and then Hispania Baetica and the area known as the &quot;Conventus Cordubensis&quot;. It flourished due to its production of Terra sigillata and its location on the Guadalquivir. After the fall of the Roman Empire, it existed as a Visigothic town named &quot;Sturgi&quot;. But with the invasion of the Moors in the 8th century, the population fled to what are now the actual limits of the town of Andújar, where they may have already existed an Ibero-Roman settlement.

=== Medieval era ===
In 711 AD, after the Battle of Guadalete, the entire region became part of Al-Andalus, and the town of Andújar first became known as &quot;Anduyar&quot; during the emirate of Muhammad I of Córdoba (853). The city was fortified by the Almohads during the 12th century. In 1225, the Muslim king of Baeza handed over the castles of Jaén, Andújar and Martos, to Ferdinand III of Castile, although some scholars believe the transfer occurred at a different time, especially as the siege of Jaen in 1225 was unsuccessful and was thus still in Muslim hands in this year. Ferdinand was entrusted with the fortresses, and control was given to Álvaro Pérez de Castro, with the area occupied by troops from the military orders of Santiago and Calatrava.
Andújar became a rendezvous point for Christian troops and armies who fought south of the Sierra Morena. The Muslim inhabitants of Andújar, Martos, and Baeza abandoned these towns at the end of 1226.

In 1227, the first Christian inhabitants arrived at Baeza, Andújar and Martos, although some sources indicate that the repopulation of Andújar did not occur until 1228. In 1467, the title of City was granted to Andújar by Henry IV of Castile.

=== Modern times ===
During the Napoleonic Wars, the city was occupied by French troops in 1808. General Pierre Dupont de l&#x27;Étang, after conquering Córdoba, established his HQ at Andújar. From Andújar Dupont sent troops to Bailén, where he lost the battle there. After this battle, the capitulations were signed at Andújar in the Palace of Gracia Real. 
In 1835, the first Junta de Soberanía Central de Andalucía (&quot;Junta of Central Sovereignty of Andalusia&quot;) was established at Andújar; it is considered the pioneer of the autonomist movement in Andalusia. In 1873, Andújar was declared a federal canton.

During the Spanish Civil War, Republican forces besieged a Nationalist force, led by Captain Santiago Cortés González, that had taken refuge in the Sanctuary of the Virgen de la Cabeza. The Siege of Santuario de Nuestra Señora de la Cabeza lasted one year.

==Climate==
Andújar has a Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) with very hot, dry summers and mild wet winters. Located in the east of the Guadalquivir valley, it has winters very similar to those observed in Córdoba and colder than in Seville due to its location further inland. Summers are extremely hot, often with average highs exceeding for the period 1981-2010. Andújar, together with the municipalities of Montoro and Marmolejo, appear to have, on average, the highest average maximum temperatures in Europe during the summer.

== Local holidays and customs ==
Its Christian patron saints are the Virgen de la Cabeza and St. Euphrasius of Illiturgis.

The most well-known local holiday is the Pilgrimage of the Virgen de la Cabeza, celebrated on the last Sunday of the month of April. During this pilgrimage, the faithful visit the sanctuary on the hill of the Cabezo. The local legend states that on the night of August 12, 1227, a shepherd from Colomera named Juan Alonso de Rivas was watching over the livestock belonging to a neighbor from Arjona when he began to see strange lights at the top of a hill. He also heard the incessant sounds of a bell. He climbed the hill and there found the image of the Virgen de la Cabeza.

A local fair (&quot;feria&quot;) is also celebrated in September, associated with cattle-raising, but this aspect has diminished in recent years. Despite this, the fair still features stands and booths erected for the sale of cattle and livestock.

== Sports ==

The local football (soccer) team is the 80-year-old Club Deportivo Iliturgi, in the third division of the national soccer league. In futsal, the local team is Andújar Fútbol Sala, which is in the First National Division A.

In September 2008, the Paralympic swimmer Miguel Ángel Martínez Tajuelo was the first native of the city to participate in these games, attending the Paralympic Games in Beijing 2008. He won 3 Paralympic awards in the 100 meter race (5th), 50-meter race (6th) and 50 meter backstroke (5th).

<doc id="1063587" wikidata="Q2545722" url="?curid=1063587" title="Persian blue">
<text>Persian blue comes in three major tones: Persian blue proper: a bright medium blue; medium Persian blue (a medium slightly grayish blue that is slightly indigoish); and a kind of dark blue which is referred to as Persian indigo, dark Persian blue, or regimental, that is much closer to the web color indigo.

Other colors associated with Persia include Persian pink, Persian rose, Persian red, Persian orange and Persian green.

==Persian blue==
The color Persian blue is named from the blue color of some Persian pottery and the color of tiles used in and on mosques and palaces in Iran and in other places in the Middle East. &quot;Persian blue&quot; is a representation of the color of the mineral lapis lazuli which comes from Persia and Afghanistan. The color azure is also named after the mineral lapis lazuli.

The first recorded use of &quot;Persian blue&quot; as a color name in English was in 1669.
==Variations==
===Medium Persian blue===
The medium tone of Persian blue shown at right is the color called &quot;Persian blue&quot; in color sample #178 of the ISCC-NBS color list.

===Persian indigo===
The color Persian indigo is displayed at right. Another name for this color is regimental because in the 19th century it was commonly used by many nations for navy uniforms, though it is seldom used in modern times.

&quot;Persian indigo&quot; is named for an association with a product from Persia: Persian cloth dyed with indigo.

The first recorded use of &quot;regimental&quot; (the original name for the color now called Persian indigo) as a color name in English was in 1912.
==In human culture==
Architecture
* Many mosques in Iran, such as the enormous Shah Mosque in Isfahan, have interiors that are faced with tiles that are &quot;Persian blue&quot; or close variations of it.

Military
* The color &quot;Persian indigo&quot;, which as noted above was originally called &quot;regimental&quot;, was called by that name because it used to be the color of the navy uniforms of a number of different nations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries due to the fact that it was easy and inexpensive to use indigo dye to dye navy uniforms.

New Age Metaphysics
* The metaphysical books (on topics such as the seven rays) written by the New Age Prophetess Alice A. Bailey (which she claimed to have channeled from the ascended master Djwal Khul), published by the Lucis Trust and called by her followers the &quot;Alice A. Bailey material&quot;, in earlier editions up to and including the 1970s were originally bound in matte &quot;medium Persian blue&quot;, but since the 1980s, they have been bound in glossy &quot;Persian blue&quot;.

Persian carpets
* When blue Persian carpets are produced in Iran, &quot;medium Persian blue&quot; is one of the most commonly used tones of blue.

<doc id="1063592" wikidata="Q5666605" url="?curid=1063592" title="Harrow football">
<text>Harrow football is a code of football played between two teams of eleven players, each attempting to win by scoring more bases (goals) than their opponent. Harrow Football is played predominantly with the feet, but players may use any part of their body including, in certain circumstances, their hands and arms to propel the ball. The leather ball is shaped like a giant pork pie, about 18 inches in diameter and deep. It tends to soak up mud and water and become extremely heavy. It is believed to be ancestral to other football codes including Association football and possibly Australian rules football.

The oldest surviving rules for Harrow football were drawn up in 1858, though it is likely to have been played exclusively at Harrow School earlier than this, both between teams of boys currently at the school and between boys at the school and old boys. The school now also play a small number of exhibition games against non-Harrow or Old Harrovian opposition. This includes games against Eton, Sunningdale Prep School Masters, Mossbourne Academy, Hatch End High School and The John Lyon School.

== Nature of the game ==
Two teams of equally numbered players each compete to get a ball (itself known as a football) into the other team&#x27;s goal, thereby scoring a base. The team which has scored the most bases at the conclusion of the game is the winner; if both teams have an equal number of bases then the game is a draw. Players mainly use their feet to move the ball around, and in general they may use any part of their bodies other than their hands or arms. But they can catch the ball with their hands if it has not touched the ground since it was kicked, and the kick was not a forward pass from a fellow team member.

In typical game play, players attempt to move towards a base through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling (running with the ball close to their feet), by passing the ball from teammate to teammate and by taking shots at the base. Opposition players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent who controls the ball. Tackling usually means barging a player on the opposing side. Barging must be done with the shoulder and must not be from directly behind the opponent as to hit their back. You are permitted to tackle even if the opponent is not in possession of the ball.

Harrow Football is generally a free-flowing game with the ball in play at all times except when it has left the field of play over a boundary line, or play has been stopped by the referee. When play has been stopped, it recommences with a specified restart (see below).

== The Laws of the Game ==
===Overview of the Laws===
The Laws of Harrow football are often framed in broad terms, which allows flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. There is no definitive guide and arguments over more obscure laws on the sidelines often result because of this.

=== Players and equipment ===
Teams consist of equal numbers of players (excluding substitutes). There is no upper limit to the number of players, although it is most common to field eleven players in inter-house and other organised matches. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team (this is usually seven). There are a variety of positions in which the players are strategically placed, though these positions are not defined or required by the Laws. The positions are usually the backs (also referred to as the threes on account of their number), the forwards and the wings. There are two wings on each wing to facilitate the giving of &quot;yards&quot;. The backs pivot on the centre back depending on the position of the ball - hence the graceful alignment referred to in the Harrow Song &quot;Yards&quot;. The forwards are often four in number and are the powerhouse which clears the way to allow the ball to be taken forward.

The basic equipment players are required to wear includes a shirt (usually the colour of a Harrow School boarding house or the official Harrow School colour), shorts, socks and footwear. Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player (including jewellery).

A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game.

=== Officials ===
A game is ideally presided over by two umpires, whose decisions regarding facts connected with play are final. Each umpire carries a Yard Stick: a wooden stick used to mark the place from which yards are taken. Games were traditionally umpired by each House providing one umpire each. However, nowadays umpiring is undertaken by Beaks (Harrow Masters), House Masters and senior boys.

=== Playing field ===
Harrow Football is usually played on a pitch similar to rugby or association football pitch. The pitch can be muddy, wet, and even waterlogged. It is usually 100–130 yards (90–120m) in length by 50–100 yards (45–90m) in width. The pitch must be rectangular, with the length (touch lines) longer than the width (goal lines).

On the goal line at each end of the field is a &#x27;base&#x27; which looks like rugby posts with their crossbar removed so a base may be scored at any point through them. The inner edges of the base posts must be apart.

The field has no other field markings, except for a half-way line which spans the width of the pitch and is equidistant from each goal line.

=== Duration ===
A standard Harrow football match consists of two periods (known as halves) of 40 minutes each. There is usually a 15-minute break between halves, known as half time. The end of the match is known as full-time.

=== Boshing ===
Boshing is the form of tackle used in Harrow Football. It is performed by a member of either the defensive or the offensive side, and its use is warranted by being within a reasonable distance from the ball. To perform a bosh, a member of one side shoulder barges a member of the opposition. There are several limitations to the bosh, as the bosher may not raise his arms or use his elbows, and it must be performed from either the front or the side (not behind). Any breach of these rules results in a Foul.

=== Starts and re-starts ===
Each playing period in Harrow football commences with a kick-off, which is a set kick from the centre by one team. The person kicking the ball does so by dropping it from his hands. At the kick-off all players are required to be in their half of the field until the ball is kicked. Kick-offs are also used to restart play following a base, though the team kicking off also has the option of dribbling the ball rather than kicking it.

Teams alternate taking the kick-off after each base, regardless of which team scored the base. The only exception is after half time, when the team who did not kick-off at the beginning of the match takes the kick.

From the initial kick-off of a period until the end of that period, the ball is &quot;in play&quot; at all times until the end of the playing period, except when the ball leaves the field of play or play is stopped by one of the umpires; in these cases play is restarted by one of the following five methods:
* Kick-off: following a base, or to begin each period of play.
* Throw-in: when the ball has wholly crossed the touchline; awarded to opposing team to that which last touched the ball. Ball may be thrown with one hand (and usually is, due to its weight). The receiving players usually &#x27;head&#x27; or &#x27;shoulder&#x27; it on from the throw.
* Base kick: when the ball has wholly crossed the base line without a base having been scored and having last been touched by an attacker; awarded to defending team. Taken from the baseline.
* Corner throw: when the ball has wholly crossed the base line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a defender; awarded to attacking team. The ball is thrown in from the point where the ball crossed the baseline. There is a formation similar to that of a &#x27;line-out&#x27; in rugby allowed, with any number of players allowed in the line, so long as the opposing team supplies an equal number of players. There are no requirements as to how far the ball needs to be thrown, but the players must stand three yards or more from the base line to receive the ball.
* Yards: when the ball has been caught by a player either from the foot of an opposing player or from the foot of a team player who is playing back into their own half; awarded to the team whose member caught the ball. The umpire places their Yardstick on the pitch at the point that Yards is called. The player who caught the ball may take any length of run up, but may only take three strides after the yardstick has been reached. After this, they may take a shot at goal or kick the ball up and back to another player on their team (known as a &#x27;transfer&#x27;). Yards can be called by the second player, but no strides may be taken unless the original player took none. For these kicks, the opposing team must stand no closer than ten yards &quot;in front&quot; of the kicker and may only build a wall with one or two players. Scoring a base without yards is possible but very difficult due to the muddy conditions the game is played in.

===Fouls and misconduct===
A &quot;foul&quot; occurs when a player commits a specific offence against an opponent, for example handling the ball, tripping an opponent, barging an opponent in the back, pulling at an opponent&#x27;s shirt, etc., are punishable by a free kick depending on where the offence occurred.

&quot;Misconduct&quot; may occur at any time, and need not be against an opponent. Whilst the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of &quot;unsporting behaviour&quot; may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences.

=== Offside ===
A player is deemed to be offside when they are positioned in front of the direction of play. When passing, the ball must either go backwards, or be kicked forwards and run onto from behind, similar to rugby. When a player is offside, other players will sometimes yell &quot;you&#x27;re off.&quot;

== Competitions ==
Harrow football is played between teams consisting of boys from each Harrow School boarding house between January and April each year. During the same period there are often matches between a school team and various teams consisting of old boys. In February each year, there are organised matches between teams from each school boarding house and old boys as part of the Harrow School Founders Day celebrations. Games are also played against the University of Newcastle.

== Names of the game ==
Harrow football is commonly known as footer within the bounds of Harrow School.

== Harrow Football in school songs ==
A number of Harrow Songs celebrate Harrow football, possibly more than the songs celebrating any other aspect of school life. They range from the well known &quot;Yards&quot; to less accessible songs such as &quot;Plump-a-Lump&quot;.

<doc id="1063599" wikidata="Q5250235" url="?curid=1063599" title="Deep Listening Band">
<text>The Deep Listening Band (DLB) was founded in 1988 by Pauline Oliveros (accordion, &quot;expanded instrument system&quot;, composition), Stuart Dempster (trombone, didjeridu, composition) and Panaiotis (vocals, electronics, composer). David Gamper (keyboards, electronics) replaced Panaiotis in 1990.

The band is named after Oliveros&#x27; term, concept, program and registered servicemark of the Deep Listening Institute, Ltd., Deep Listening, and specializes in performing and recording in resonant or reverberant spaces such as cathedrals and huge underground cisterns including the Fort Worden Cistern which has a 45-second reverberation time.

==Milestones and collaborations==
Deep Listening Band recorded its first, self titled album at Fort Worden Cistern in Port Townsend, WA on October 8, 1988. Al Swanson is credited with the on location recording, while Swanson and Dempster collaborated in editing the recording in December 1988. The initial name &quot;The Deep Listening Band&quot; and the corresponding initialism &quot;DLB&quot; were coined during the winter of 1988/1989. In 1991 the name became &quot;Deep Listening Band&quot;, without a &quot;The&quot;.

DLB collaborated with Ellen Fullman and her Long String Instrument resulting in the &quot;Suspended Music&quot; release by Periplum Records in 1993. The band also performed, recorded, and released a trope on John Cage&#x27;s &quot;4&#x27;33&quot;&quot;. &quot;Non Stop Flight&quot;, a 70-minute excerpt from the 4 hours and 33&#x27; trope recorded in September 1996 at the Mills College concert hall, was released by Music &amp; Arts. &quot;Unquenchable Fire&quot; with the Joe McPhee Quartet, inspired by the novel of the same name, was released on the Deep Listening Label in 2003. The same year saw the release &quot;Deep Time&quot; featuring Swiss experimental percussionist Fritz Hauser as special guest.

In 2008 DLB celebrated 20 years with a series of events beginning in August at Bard College as part of New Albion Records’ 25th Anniversary. The bands anniversary celebrations culminated in a performance on October 24, 2008 at Roulette (Location 1) in NYC. On the same day Taiga Records released the double LP &quot;Then &amp; Now, Now &amp; Then&quot;, a compilation of mostly unreleased recording excerpts from 1990 to 2006. The performance at Roulette and the performance at Big Twig Studio in the Catskills on the following day were presented as part of IONE’s 13th Annual Dream Festival.

While 2011 was a highly productive year for DLB, it also marked the tragic loss of long time band member David Gamper in September. Supported by Matt Turner (e-cello), Rebecca Salzer, Jeff Wallace (movement), members of IGLU (Improvisation Group at Lawrence University), Larry Darling (sound) and Jillian Johnson (administration) DLB dedicated the October 29, 2011 performance at Lawrence University in Appleton, WI to the memory of David Gamper. As a tribute to Gamper DLB released three albums featuring the long time trio Dempster, Gamper and Oliveros: &quot;Octagonal Polyphony&quot; (Important Records, vinyl), &quot;Great Howl at Town Hall&quot; (Important Records, CD) and &quot;Needle Drop Jungle&quot; (Taiga Records, vinyl).

The band celebrated its 25th anniversary with a weeklong residency culminating in a concert at the Dunrobin Sonic Gym in Ontario, Canada in October 2013. On this occasion the band employed the Cistern Simulation Technology, a simulation of the Fort Worden Cistern acoustics, developed by Jonas Braasch, Director of the Center for Cognition, Communication, and Culture at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Both residency and concert featured founding members Pauline Oliveros and Stuart Dempster as well as special guests Jonas Braasch (saxophone), Jesse Stewart (percussion, sonic artifacts) and Johannes Welsch (gongs). The concert, which opened with an invocation by IONE (author, playwright, director), was recorded by Braasch and Welsch, and released by Deep Listening as &quot;Dunrobin Sonic Gems&quot; on October 8, 2014, marking the 26th anniversary of the seminal Fort Worden Cistern recording. On this occasion DLB also released &quot;Johina&quot;, an excerpt from the soundcheck preceding the concert, as a standalone composition for download.

<text>Richard M. Murphy (born December 16, 1942) is an American politician who served as the 33rd mayor of San Diego from 2000 to 2005. He is a member of the Republican Party.

==Early life and education==
Murphy was born in 1942 in Oak Park, Illinois. He was captain of the varsity basketball team and Senior Class President of Proviso West High School in its first graduating class in 1961. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Illinois with a degree in economics and served as president of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. He received his Master of Business Administration from Harvard University and his Doctor of Jurisprudence degree from Stanford University.

Murphy served as an officer in the U.S. Army, in the Pentagon and the White House as a military aide to the Nixon administration. In the early 1970s he moved to San Diego, where he was Marketing Director for Bank of America, and an attorney at the law firm of Luce, Forward, Hamilton &amp; Scripps. In 1980, he was elected to the San Diego City Council, and served from 1981 through 1985 helping create Mission Trails Regional Park. In 1985, he was appointed municipal court judge by Governor George Deukmejian. In 1989, the governor elevated him to superior court judge where he served for more than a decade.

==Mayor==

Murphy was first elected mayor in November 2000. His election was a long shot against Ron Roberts, who had the support of the business community. He campaigned on providing &quot;Leadership With 2020 Vision&quot;—a promise to set forth a clear long term vision for the city and to provide the leadership to implement that vision. Murphy had previously served one term on the San Diego City Council representing the Seventh District. While elections for municipal offices in California are non-partisan, he is a registered Republican.

During his first term in office, Murphy set ten goals for the city and had success in accomplishing many of them. The most significant included establishing the city&#x27;s first ethics commission, completing construction of a new downtown ballpark for the San Diego Padres baseball team, forming the San Diego Regional Airport Authority, creating the San Diego River Conservancy, building the Veterans Memorial Garden in Balboa Park, jump starting plans for a new central library, and implementing a plan to underground all overhead utility lines in the city.

Murphy ran for a second term in 2004 again against Ron Roberts. His re-election campaign saw controversy with a last minute write-in candidate, Donna Frye, a member of the San Diego City Council. A number of voters did not follow the proper procedure for supporting a write-in candidate, either misspelling the name of Donna Frye (usually as &quot;Donna Fry&quot;) or writing her name in the blank but neglecting to fill in the corresponding bubble to indicate their preference. After a legal imbroglio involving three (unsuccessful) lawsuits, these votes were ultimately not counted, resulting in Murphy winning the official tally by approximately 2,000 votes.

During Murphy&#x27;s second term, the city faced serious fiscal problems from years of financial mismanagement by past city governments, problems including an underfunded pension program and a series of credit-score downgrades. Facing mounting criticism over his controversial election victory and failure to adequately address the pension underfunding problem, Murphy announced his plans to resign as Mayor and resigned July 15, 2005. Murphy has written a book about his experiences as mayor entitled &quot;San Diego&#x27;s Judge Mayor: How Murphy&#x27;s Law Blindsided Leadership with 2020 Vision&quot; Sunbelt Publications San Diego.

<text>Dominique Anel ( – ), French surgeon, was born at Toulouse. Anel was a pupil of well-known French surgeons J. L. Petit (1674-1750) and Georges Mareschal (1658-1736).
After studying at Montpellier and Paris, he served as surgeon-major in the French army in Alsace; then after two years at Vienna he went to Italy and served in the Austrian army. In 1710 he was teaching surgery in Rouen, whence he went to Genoa, and in 1716 he was practising in Paris.

In military, Anel’s job was to clean soldiers’ wounds at the battle fields. He invented a small suction syringe which was used to remove much of the dirt and infection. This prevented the professional ‘suckers’ who followed the armies at that time to offer lip-service for money. Anel’s syringe survived with modification for 250 years. This became the forerunner of modern aspirator. Based on this unique design, hypodermic syringes were ultimately improved.
Anel was celebrated for his successful surgical treatment of &quot;fistula lacrymalis&quot;, and while at Genoa invented for use in connection with the operation the fine-pointed syringe known by his name. In 1713, Anel became famous after he treated the Duchess of Savoy for lacrimal fistulae in a period of ten days.

His daughter was Marie-Angélique Anel Le Rebours, the first woman to write a book and manual about breastfeeding.

<text>Tulipa pulchella (syn. &quot;Tulipa humilis&quot; ) is a dwarf species of flowering plant in the family Liliaceae, native to Iran and Turkey. It grows from a bulb 1–2 cm diameter, which produces a flowering stem up to 20 cm tall. The leaves are glaucous-green, 10–15 cm long. The flowers are reddish-purple, with six tepals 3 cm long and 1.5 cm broad.

==Cultivation==
In the early 19th century it was introduced to Europe, where a small number of cultivars are grown as ornamental plants in gardens. These include &#x27;Persian Pearl&#x27; (purple inside, red outside), &#x27;Eastern Star&#x27; (magenta with yellow base), and &#x27;Obalisque&#x27; (red inside, purple out). Varieties include &quot;var. violacea&quot; (purple with black base).

<text>Patoka Lake is the second largest reservoir in the U.S. state of Indiana (after Monroe Lake) and is spread across Dubois, Crawford, and Orange counties in Southern Indiana.

==Lake==
Created as a joint effort between the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the lake is one of eight such reservoirs built in the state to provide a secure water supply and as a method of flood control. The lake covers 8,800 surface acres (36 km²) of water in the summer.Maximum depth is 52 ft.

The lake was created by damming the Patoka River about above its mouth with the Patoka Lake Dam, a high rockfill earthen dam that was completed in 1978. The lake is fed by several smaller tributaries including Allen Creek, Painter Creek, and Ritter Creek. After the lake was created several parks and nature preserves were established around it totaling . The lake and dam is still managed by a cooperative management team of the Army Corps of Engineers and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.

Patoka Lake is a great place for photography, as it is inhabited by migrating birds, a large variety of fish and beautiful lake shores. The lake has been heavily stocked with bass, bluegill, catfish, redear, crappie, and walleye. Other facilities include an archery range, boat ramps, a cross-country skiing course, fishing areas (including ice fishing), a disc golf course, trails for hiking and bicycling, hunting areas, interpretive and recreational programs, star parties, picnic shelters, swimming areas, and waterskiing zones. The lake also hosts a large campground with over 500 camping sites.

Patoka Lake has been very beneficial to the surrounding community and the state of Indiana. The lake has generated over $19.4 million in revenue and visitor expenditures in 2005 and has so far prevented over $88 million in flood damage. In 2006 the lake saw 648,738 visitors who provide jobs for 197 local residents.

<text>A wide character is a computer character datatype that generally has a size greater than the traditional 8-bit character. The increased datatype size allows for the use of larger coded character sets.

==History==
During the 1960s, mainframe and mini-computer manufacturers began to standardize around the 8-bit byte as their smallest datatype. The 7-bit ASCII character set became the industry standard method for encoding alphanumeric characters for teletype machines and computer terminals. The extra bit was used for parity, to ensure the integrity of data storage and transmission. As a result, the 8-bit byte became the de facto datatype for computer systems storing ASCII characters in memory.

Later, computer manufacturers began to make use of the spare bit to extend the ASCII character set beyond its limited set of English alphabet characters. 8-bit extensions such as IBM code page 37, PETSCII and ISO 8859 became commonplace, offering terminal support for Greek, Cyrillic, and many others. However, such extensions were still limited in that they were region specific and often could not be used in tandem. Special conversion routines had to be used to convert from one character set to another, often resulting in destructive translation when no equivalent character existed in the target set.

In 1989, the International Organization for Standardization began work on the Universal Character Set (UCS), a multilingual character set that could be encoded using either a 16-bit (2-byte) or 32-bit (4-byte) value. These larger values required the use of a datatype larger than 8-bits to store the new character values in memory. Thus the term wide character was used to differentiate them from traditional 8-bit character datatypes.

==Relation to UCS and Unicode==
A wide character refers to the size of the datatype in memory. It does not state how each value in a character set is defined. Those values are instead defined using character sets, with UCS and Unicode simply being two common character sets that encode more characters than an 8-bit wide numeric value (255 total) would allow.

==Relation to multibyte characters==
Just as earlier data transmission systems suffered from the lack of an 8-bit clean data path, modern transmission systems often lack support for 16-bit or 32-bit data paths for character data. This has led to character encoding systems such as UTF-8 that can use multiple bytes to encode a value that is too large for a single 8-bit symbol.

The C standard distinguishes between &quot;multibyte&quot; encodings of characters, which use a fixed or variable number of bytes to represent each character (primarily used in source code and external files), from &quot;wide characters&quot;, which are run-time representations of characters in single objects (typically, greater than 8 bits).

==Size of a wide character==
Early adoption of UCS-2 (&quot;Unicode 1.0&quot;) led to common use of UTF-16 in a number of platforms, most notably Microsoft Windows, .NET and Java. In these systems, it is common to have a &quot;wide character&quot; ( in C/C++; in Java) type of 16-bits. These types do not always map directly to one &quot;character&quot;, as surrogate pairs are required to store the full range of Unicode (1996, Unicode 2.0).

Unix-like generally use a 32-bit to fit the 21-bit Unicode code point, as C90 prescribed.

The size of a wide character type does not dictate what kind of text encodings a system can process, as conversions are available. (Old conversion code commonly overlook surrogates, however.) The historical circumstances of their adoption does also decide what types of encoding they &quot;prefer&quot;. A system influenced by Unicode 1.0, such as Windows, tends to mainly use &quot;wide strings&quot; made out of wide character units. Other systems such as the Unix-likes, however, tend to retain the 8-bit &quot;narrow string&quot; convention, using a multibyte encoding (almost universally UTF-8) to handle &quot;wide&quot; characters.

==Programming specifics==

===C/C++===
The C and C++ standard libraries include a number of facilities for dealing with wide characters and strings composed of them. The wide characters are defined using datatype codice_1, which in the original C90 standard was defined as

: &quot;an integral type whose range of values can represent distinct codes for all members of the largest extended character set specified among the supported locales&quot; (ISO 9899:1990 §4.1.5)

Both C and C++ introduced fixed-size character types codice_2 and codice_3 in the 2011 revisions of their respective standards to provide unambiguous representation of 16-bit and 32-bit Unicode transformation formats, leaving codice_1 implementation-defined. The ISO/IEC 10646:2003 Unicode standard 4.0 says that:

:&quot;The width of codice_1 is compiler-specific and can be as small as 8 bits. Consequently, programs that need to be portable across any C or C++ compiler should not use codice_1 for storing Unicode text. The codice_1 type is intended for storing compiler-defined wide characters, which may be Unicode characters in some compilers.&quot;

===Python===
According to Python 2.7&#x27;s documentation, the language sometimes uses codice_1 as the basis for its character type codice_9. It depends on whether codice_1 is &quot;compatible with the chosen Python Unicode build variant&quot; on that system. This distinction has been deprecated since Python 3.3, which introduced a flexibly-sized UCS1/2/4 storage for strings and formally aliased to codice_1. Since Python 3.12 use of codice_1, i.e. the codice_9 typedef, for Python strings (wstr in implementation) has been dropped and still as before an &quot;UTF-8 representation is created on demand and cached in the Unicode object.&quot;

<doc id="1063615" wikidata="Q7136153" url="?curid=1063615" title="Parathyroidectomy">
<text>Parathyroidectomy is the surgical removal of one or more of the (usually) four parathyroid glands. This procedure is used to remove an adenoma or hyperplasia of these glands when they are producing excessive parathyroid hormone (PTH): hyperparathyroidism. The glands are usually four in number and located adjacent to the posterior surface of the thyroid gland, but their exact location is variable. When an elevated PTH level is found, a sestamibi scan or an ultrasound may be performed in order to confirm the presence and location of abnormal parathyroid tissue.

==Indications==
The main indication for parathyroidectomy is primary hyperparathyroidism, a condition in which one or more of the parathyroid glands produce excessive parathyroid hormone. Not all cases of primary hyperparathyroidism require surgery, but it is recommended if the condition causes significant symptoms or if it affects the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis) or bone health (osteoporosis), and also in people under 50 even if they do not have symptoms. It is not always possible to anticipate if a parathyroid tumor is malignant (i.e. capable of invading other tissues or spreading elsewhere). Any suspicion of parathyroid carcinoma is therefore also an indication for surgery.

Parathyroidectomy may also be required in secondary hyperparathyroidism. This situation arises mainly in people with severe chronic kidney disease in which the parathyroid glands are overactive to compensate for the low calcium and vitamin D levels often present in CKD. In many cases, the parathyroid hormone production improves when these abnormalities are treated with medication. A small proportion, however, have persistently raised hormone levels six months after treatment has started, thought to be autonomous production of hormone by the glands and loss of feedback mechanisms. In this situation surgical parathyroidectomy may be required, especially if calcium and phosphate levels remain elevated, there is calcium deposition in the wall of blood vessels (calciphylaxis in severe cases) or there is worsening bone disease. In people on dialysis, parathyroidectomy can improve their survival. It does appear that the procedure may be underused.

==Procedure==
The operation requires a general anesthetic (unconscious and pain free) or a local anesthetic (pain free). The surgeon makes an incision around an inch long in the neck just under the larynx (Adam&#x27;s apple), and locates the offending parathyroid glands. Preoperative testing using sestamibi scanning can help identify the location of glands. It can also be used to limit the extent of surgical exploration when used in conjunction with intraoperative PTH hormone monitoring. The particular problem or disease process will determine how many of the parathyroid glands are removed. Some parathyroid tissue must be left in place to help prevent hypoparathyroidism.

Recovery after the operation tends to be swift. The PTH level is back to normal within 10–15 minutes, and can be confirmed by intraoperative rapid assessment during the operation. However, the remaining parathyroid glands may take hours to several weeks to return to their normal functioning levels (as they may have become dormant). Calcium supplements are therefore often required to prevent symptoms of hypocalcemia and to restore lost bone mass.

The patient is placed in a semi-Fowler position and the neck is extended. An abbreviated Kocher incision is made and the platysma muscle is dissected horizontally. The strap muscles are released off of the thyroid gland. Then the thyroid gland is mobilized and the parathyroid arterial blood supply is suture ligated. The entire parathyroid adenoma is identified and dissected out. Intraoperative PTH monitoring can begin at this time and will show falling PTH levels if the entire adenoma has been resected.

==Complications==
While mild hypocalcemia is common after partial parathyroidectomy, some people experience persistently prolonged low calcium levels. This is called hungry bone syndrome. Despite the reactivation of unresected parathyroid glands producing normal to elevated levels of PTH, serum calcium continues to be low. The balance between calcium influx and efflux within the bone continues to be disrupted, favoring the former. The bone is said to be &quot;hungry&quot; as it consumes minerals without regard to PTH; calcium, magnesium, and phosphate continue to be deposited into the bones, resulting in hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia. Prolonged calcium supplementation may be required. Hungry bone syndrome is particularly common in people who are on long-term regular dialysis.

<text>The New Zealand Liberal Party founded in 1991 (not to be confused with the original Liberal Party or the 1962 Liberal Party) was a splinter group of the National Party.

==History==
===Origins===
The Liberal Party was founded by Gilbert Myles and Hamish MacIntyre, two dissident National MPs. Myles and McIntyre were opponents of the economic reforms (dubbed &quot;Ruthanasia&quot;) promoted by Minister of Finance Ruth Richardson, believing that they were harmful to society. As a result of their objections, Myles and McIntyre fell out with their National Party colleagues, and eventually decided to break away. After a short time as independents, they established the Liberal Party.

At its launch the party predicted it would win &quot;six or seven seats&quot; at the next election and hold the balance of power. Myles and MacIntyre also stated that they were anticipating a third National MP would soon join. They were careful not to mention a name, but media quickly identified Cam Campion as the MP inferred. Campion was interviewed and stated that he had not given up on National just yet and was still &quot;flat out&quot; trying to change National&#x27;s policy direction.

The party&#x27;s membership was made up of erstwhile National supporters as well as active members who resigned from National to join the Liberals. Prominent members of the party organisation also left including two members of National&#x27;s Auckland divisional council in October 1991. Judith Surgenor (chair of National&#x27;s electorate committee) and Larry Belshaw (electorate committee secretary and 1990 candidate for ) both resigned to join the Liberal Party citing dissatisfaction with the policies of the National government. In November another former National Party divisional councillor Malcolm Wright was chosen as the president of the party.

===Alliance membership===
The new organisation was plagued by organisational difficulties, and neither Myles not MacIntyre — both first-term MPs — had much political experience. Not long after the party was established, Myles and McIntyre opted to join the Liberals with the newly formed Alliance party. Although the Alliance was considerably more left-wing than the Liberals, it was emerging as the most significant political group to oppose Ruth Richardson&#x27;s policies — the leader of the Alliance, Jim Anderton, had quit his own Labour Party out of opposition to Roger Douglas, an ideological ally of Richardson. Liberal politician Sue Corbett, an Auckland City Councillor, was the Alliance candidate for Mayor of Auckland City, running a high-profile campaign at the 1992 local body elections. Corbett ultimately lost to incumbent mayor Les Mills.

In 1993, however, a more prominent dissident within the National Party, Winston Peters, also quit. Although it was briefly considered that a pact might be formed between the Alliance and Peters, the two proved incompatible, and Peters established the New Zealand First party. At the time when Myles and McIntyre had split from National, they had entertained hopes that Peters (and possibly Michael Laws or Cam Campion) would join them, and were therefore disappointed at the failure of talks between Peters and the Alliance. The possibility of leaving the Alliance and merging with New Zealand First was discussed, but deep divisions emerged within the party about this possibility. In the end, Myles (along with party president Malcolm Wright and central regional chairman Trevor Jans) opted to leave the Liberals and join New Zealand First. MacIntyre remained with the Liberals for some time afterwards but he was defeated in 1993 and did not enter Parliament again and following the 1996 election where he was a list candidate for the Alliance, he then retired from politics becoming a company director.

===Disbandment===
In 1996, leadership of the Liberals fell to Frank Grover, who had been elected to Parliament as an Alliance list MP in the 1996 election. Grover, the party president, defeated Corbett for the Liberal leadership. In 1998 the party had declined to just over 100 members and was eventually dissolved, with its sole MP and remaining members simply becoming members of the Alliance as a whole. This was preceded by the Alliance changing its constitution in November 1997 to make it obligatory for constituent member parties have at least 500 members. The Liberal Party had well over this number at the time Myles defected to New Zealand First in 1993, but swathes of members joined him leaving the party membership decimated. MacIntyre supported the decision but was &quot;a little sad&quot; to see the party wind up but said it was &quot;by far the most realistic option&quot;.

Grover himself eventually rejected the Alliance, and shortly before the 1999 election, defected to the Christian Heritage Party, giving it its first seat in Parliament. He did not secure re-election, however.

<text>Jovito Reyes Salonga, KGCR (; June 22, 1920 – March 10, 2016) also called &quot;Ka Jovy,&quot; was a Filipino politician and lawyer, as well as a leading opposition leader during the regime of Ferdinand Marcos from the declaration of martial law in 1972 until the People Power Revolution in 1986, which removed Marcos from power. Salonga was the 14th president of the Senate of the Philippines, serving from 1987 to 1992.

==Early life and education==
Jovito Salonga was born in poverty in Pasig on June 22, 1920. His father was a Presbyterian pastor, Esteban Salonga and his mother, Bernardita &quot;Dinang&quot; Reyes, was a market vendor. His parents married in 1904. Jovito Salonga, the youngest of five brothers, worked his way through college and law school as a proofreader in the publishing firm of his eldest brother, Isayas. He spent time shoe-shining and selling newspapers in the streets of Pasig. Salonga graduated at Pasig Elementary School. During his senior year at the College of Law at the University of the Philippines (U.P.) in Manila, he quit his job to prepare for the bar exam. Due to the beginning of World War II, he postponed taking the Philippine Bar Examination until 1944, when he and Jose W. Diokno, a future ally in the Senate and during martial law, both topped the bar with a then-record grade point average of 95.3%.

===World War II hero===
A few months after the Japanese invasion in December 1941, Salonga went underground and engaged in anti-Japanese activities. In April 1942, he was captured and tortured by the Japanese Military Police in Pasig in the presence of his aging father. He was transferred to Fort Santiago and several other prisons where he was subjected to further persecution. On June 11, 1942, he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor by the Japanese and incarcerated at the New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa, but was pardoned on the Foundation Day of Japan (Kigen Setsu) in 1943.

===American education===
After passing the bar, he went back to the U.P. College of Law where he earned an LL.B in 1946. He traveled to the U.S. when he won a scholarship to attend Harvard for his master&#x27;s degree. Recommended by Harvard professor Manley Hudson to Yale Law School, he was awarded a fellowship at Yale University where he earned a Doctor of Juridical Science (SJD) in 1949. He however turned down their offer of a faculty position because he felt he should participate in his country&#x27;s post-war reconstruction. He was honored with the Ambrose Gherini Prize for writing the best paper in international law. At Yale, he met Jose B. Laurel, son of wartime President Jose P. Laurel, who later became his law partner in the Philippines. In February 1948, he married Lydia Busuego in Cambridge, Massachusetts who gave birth to their first son, Esteban Fernando Salonga, among other children.

Salonga returned to the Philippines to pursue teaching and the practice of law. He authored several books on corporate law and international law, and was appointed Dean of the Far Eastern University Institute of Law in 1956. His student and later associate was future Chief Justice Artemio Panganiban, who said the three finest lawyers in history were Salonga, fellow ally Sen. Diokno, and future Chief Justice Claudio Ong Teehankee. On December 16, 1988, Arizona State University selected him to receive an honorary degree.

Central Philippine University and Silliman University, which were founded by Protestant Americans, conferred him with honorary degrees.

==Political career (1961–1987)==

===House of Representatives===
In 1960, he was persuaded by Vice President Diosdado Macapagal, then president of the Liberal Party (LP), one of the two dominant political parties in the Philippines at the time, to run for Congress in the second district of Rizal, where two political dynasties dominated the bureaucracy. Salonga helped build the party from the grassroots, largely with the support of disgruntled young people who responded to the issues he raised, particularly the entrenchment of the political ruling class and their families in seats of governments, a major cause of disenchantment among the masses. In the November 1961 elections, he bested his two opponents by an overwhelming margin.

Shortly after his election, he tangled with one of the best debaters of the opposing party, the Nacionalista Party (NP), on the issue of proportional representation in various committees. He also composed a seminal article, published and editorialized in various papers, on the Philippines&#x27; territorial claim to North Borneo (Sabah). With the election of Cornelio Villareal (LP, Capiz) as Speaker of the House, Salonga was appointed to the chairmanship of the prestigious Committee on Good Government and led the committee in conducting inquires in aid of legislation relentlessly about the prevailing graft and corruption in the government and recommended filing of charges against some government officials and employees. In June 1962, President Macapagal filed the Philippine petition against Malaysia&#x27;s alleged illegal expropriation of North Borneo. Salonga was appointed to head the delegation in the January 1963 London negotiations. 

===Senate===
After one term, Salonga was chosen to run for Senate under the LP banner in the 1965 elections. Despite limited financial resources and the victory of NP candidate Marcos as president, Salonga was elected senator, garnering the most votes. In 1967, he was Benigno Aquino Jr.&#x27;s chief lawyer in the underage lawsuit filed against the latter by President Marcos. Largely through Salonga&#x27;s skills in jurisprudence, Aquino won his case before the Commission on Elections. Subsequently, Marcos&#x27; appeals to the Supreme Court and Senate Electoral Tribunal were overturned, granting a final victory to Salonga and Aquino. For his well-documented exposés against the Marcos administration, Salonga was hailed as the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Fiscalizer&quot; by the Philippines Free Press in 1968. 

He ran for re-election in 1971. Along with some members of the Liberal Party, he was critically injured on the August 21 bombing of his party&#x27;s proclamation rally at Plaza Miranda. His doctors&#x27; prognoses were grim—he was not expected to live. He survived, however, with impaired eyesight and hearing, and more than a hundred tiny pieces of shrapnel in his body. He topped the senatorial race for the second time. 

He returned to the political arena and embarked on a successful law career. He protested martial law and was unjustly arrested. After his release from military custody, he was offered a visiting scholarship at Yale, where he engaged in the revision of his book on international law. He completed his book on the Marcos years, which included a program for a new democratic Philippines. 

===Martial law years===

The imposition of martial law in September 1972 was the catalyst that radicalized hundreds of oppositionists and the pretext to arrest and imprison many of them, including moderate ones. Salonga openly and vigorously opposed it, and he and his law partners, future Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordoñez and future Chief Justice Pedro L. Yap, defended many cases of well-known political prisoners as well as obscure detainees, most of them on a pro bono basis.

In October 1980, after the bombing of the Philippine International Convention Center, Marcos again ordered Salonga&#x27;s arrest; this time he was detained at Fort Bonifacio without any formal charges and investigation. He was allowed to leave with his wife for the U.S. in March 1981, to attend several international conferences and undergo medical procedures. Right after their departure, subversion charges—supposedly a well-known Marcos tactic to scare off his enemies from ever returning—were filed against him. Jovito and Lydia Salonga lived in self-exile in Hawaii, then moved to Encino, California, where he was visited by many opposition leaders, including Ninoy Aquino. It was here where, at the request of LP President Gerry Roxas, Salonga wrote the party&#x27;s
&quot;Vision and Program of Government&quot;. After Roxas&#x27; death in April 1982, Salonga was elected acting president of the Liberal Party. Salonga then became one of the candidates for president against Marcos, competing against the two UNIDO leaders Doy Laurel and Eva Estrada-Kalaw, with all three eventually agreeing to settle with Corazon Aquino as the main candidate, who defeated Marcos in the 1986 election.

===EDSA People Power===
The assassination of Benigno &quot;Ninoy&quot; Aquino, Jr. in August 1983 prompted Salonga to return to the Philippines on January 21, 1985, to help resuscitate his party and unite democratic opposition. A month later, the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed subversion charges against him. He was elected president of the Liberal Party.

===PCGG chairman===
Shortly after the EDSA Revolution, President Corazon Aquino, Aquino&#x27;s widow, appointed Salonga Chair of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), which was tasked with investigating and recovering the alleged ill-gotten wealth of Marcos and cronies.

As chairman of the Commission on Good Government, he &quot;filed and perfected&quot; the government&#x27;s claim to the Marcos Swiss deposits through the Swiss lawyers dr. Salvioni, dr. Fontanet and Leuenberger. His unwavering pursuit of the Marcos ill-gotten wealth was, in one senator&#x27;s words, the &quot;moral equivalent of a war&quot;. His efforts were rewarded when the government sequestrated Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr.&#x27;s firms including 93% shares of the United Coconut Planters Bank and 27% shares of the San Miguel Corporation. 

In 2000, the Swiss federal Court, after 14 years of litigation, decided to forfeit the corrupt Marcos funds received by the Swiss Credit bank in Zurich, and delivered to the nation&#x27;s government more than US$680,000,000. The commission also petitioned to expropriate several real estate properties and several of the nation&#x27;s largest corporations that the Philippine government claim were bought through blackmail or money the Marcos family allegedly plundered from the Treasury. 

==Senate presidency (1987–1992)==

After his one-year stint in the PCGG, he was drafted to run for the senate in the 1987 elections. For the third time, he won the number one spot in the senatorial race. He was subsequently elected as Senate President due to his colleagues&#x27; respect for his long standing career as lawyer, lawmaker and defender of human rights.

===Legislation===
Elected as Senate President by his peers, and as Senator by the people, Salonga authored three major legislative measures: the &quot;Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees (R.A. 6713)&quot;, the &quot;Anti-Coup d&#x27;état Act (R.A. 6968)&quot;, and the &quot;Anti-Plunder Law (R.A. 7080)&quot;. In April 1990, he was conferred a Doctor of Laws degree, honoris causa, by the University of the Philippines &quot;for his brilliant career as &quot;&quot;an eminent political figure... for his unwavering, courageous stand against injustice, oppression, and dictatorship ... and for his sterling personal qualities of decency, humility, industry and moderation&quot;.

Salonga, despite limited means, won three senatorial elections, garnering the largest number of votes under three different administrations: that of Diosdado Macapagal, Ferdinand Marcos and Corazon Aquino. He has successfully legislated the State Scholarship Law, the Disclosure of Interest Act, the Magna Carta for Public School Teachers, the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees, and the Act Defining and Penalizing the Crime of Plunder.

=== Rejection of the Phil–U.S. Bases Treaty ===
In September 1991, Salonga personally organized the group of 12 senators called &quot;The Magnificent Twelve&quot; in rejecting the R.P.-U.S. Bases Treaty. Salonga gave the vote that broke the tie stating in his speech that awards did not mean that much to him anymore.

===Removal as Senate President===
In December 1991, he was ousted from his position as President of the Senate on the charge that he was using his post to boost his chances of becoming the President of the Philippines in the 1992 election in which he is a candidate, that he was obstructing the priority legislative measures of the Aquino administration, and that he was neglecting the administration the Senate, and was succeeded by Senator Neptali A. Gonzales, Sr. who served as Senate President on January 1, 1992, following a transition of leadership agreement with Salonga. Due to the agreement, Salonga remained as Senate President until December 31, 1991. Incidentally, like Salonga, Senator Gonzales also served as Dean of the Far Eastern University Institute of Law.

===1992 presidential election===
He then launched a bid for the presidency in 1992, running under the Liberal Party with PDP–Laban&#x27;s Aquilino Pimentel Jr. running for vice president, but he lost (finishing sixth in a seven-person race in the official tally) despite the resounding support of students from various colleges and universities. 

==Post-Senate presidency==

===Activities===
After his retirement from government service, he continued work in public service through &quot;Kilosbayan&quot; (People Action), a forum for raising political consciousness and citizens&#x27; participation in governance; the &quot;Bantayog ng mga Bayani Foundation&quot; (Heroes&#x27; Memorial), a private entity that honors the nation&#x27;s martyrs and heroes for their sacrifices during martial law; and &quot;Bantay Katarungan&quot; (Sentinel of Justice), an organization that seeks to improve the administration of justice in the Philippines through the systematic monitoring of courts and quasi-judicial agencies by selected students from leading law schools.

On September 14, 2007, Salonga resigned as member of a minor fraternity in the University of the Philippines, Diliman. They are the so-called Sigma Rho fraternity. Salonga resigned after their crime and implication in the hazing death of University of the Philippines, Diliman student, 20-year-old Cris Mendez. Salonga joined Sigma Rho in the 1940s. Salonga stated the reason for his resignation to be &quot;because of recent events in which Sigma Rho has been involved.&quot; The NBI issued subpoenas to the Sigma Rho fraternity, but none of its members admitted responsibility for the brutal murder or shed light on the truth. Mendez suffered &quot;bruises all over his body, particularly on the back of his arms and thighs.&quot; On September 17, 2007, the &quot;Grand Archon Emeritus&quot; (leading alumnus of this Sigma Rho fraternity) attempted to save face by demanding an apology from Salonga over remarks against the fraternity. Their lawyer Tony Meer, a fellow member concocted a rouse to distract the public and stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t think its fair to us. I think he owes us an apology.&quot; The requested apology was never bestowed on them. Meanwhile, the media, historians, and experts, including columnist and Sigma Kappa Pi Alumni President Jarius Bondoc praised Salonga for doing the right thing by rejecting this syndicate.

The Chair of Bantay Katarungan is former Secretary of Justice Sedfrey Ordoñez, who had been Salonga&#x27;s law partner for over three decades. Salonga was a founder/adviser. Salonga remained active as a speaker, denouncing the moral and social ills in Philippine society. Since ending his political career in 1992, Salonga has been delivering lectures at such eminent universities such as the University of the Philippines, Ateneo, Universidad de Santo Tomas, De La Salle University, and F.E.U. He teaches regularly at the Lyceum of the Philippines where he holds the Jose P. Laurel Chair on Law, Government and Public Policy. He likewise launched the Dr. Jovito Salonga Center for Law and Development at the Silliman University College of Law to pioneer and develop what the law center calls as &quot;Transformative Law&quot; – &quot;the study and application of law to transform society, shape policies through advocacy, legal education, research, training, and service learning&quot;.

Salonga was president of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP) Constitutional Convention which took place September 1993 at Ellinwood-Malate Church in Manila. Always the nationalist, he persuaded the delegates to agree that the Filipino language text had equal weight to the English text. During the caucus, he was a calming influence and ran the assembly with a firm and fair hand.

Salonga wrote President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to warn her that the May 14, 2007, elections could turn out to be as &quot;violent and fraudulent&quot; as the Marcos-era polls. In an open letter to Secretary Eduardo Ermita, he stated that he saw Marcos in Arroyo, Ver in Esperon, but was rebuffed. Arroyo rejected the concerns raised in Salonga&#x27;s letter which mentioned that her decision to call out the military to help stop election violence and killings would make the May 14 polls similar to the violence- and fraud-tainted elections during the Marcos regime.

Salonga branded the government&#x27;s move to hand back an American citizen accused of rape, to the United States authorities as &quot;a raw deal and a midnight transaction&quot;, whose victims were &quot;Nicole&quot; (the rape victim) and the country&#x27;s justice system. Salonga claimed that a raw deal was done against &quot;Nicole&quot; and the judicial process by Judge Benjamin Pozon and the Court of Appeals under pressure from George W. Bush&#x27;s government.

Senator Joker P. Arroyo paid him the highest tribute when he said: &quot;Some people make history, others write it. But there is a rare handful who, in writing-and in speaking-make history. These are the ones who illuminate the issues, and in so doing move men to answer them with noble actions ... In our country there was Claro M. Recto. But if you consider the wealth of historical events surrounding a particular personality who shaped and even generated these events by his words, Jovito Salonga stands virtually alone.&quot; 

On August 15, 2007, Salonga&#x27;s book &quot;Not by Power or Wealth Alone&quot; was published.

On August 24, 2007, Salonga&#x27;s &quot;Bantayog ng mga Bayani Foundation&quot; launched a commemorative 200-page book,
&quot;Bantayog ng mga Bayani&quot; (Monument of Heroes) at the Bantayog Memorial Center on Quezon Avenue corner EDSA to honor heroes, 160 Filipino student and community activists, priests, nuns, journalists, lawyers, Supreme Court justices and an Italian priest Tulio Favali, who was murdered in 1985 by a military-backed fanatic cult.

===Honors and recognition===

Salonga received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for government service on August 31, 2007. He was honored for &quot;the exemplary integrity and substance of his long public career in service to democracy and good government in the Philippines&quot;. Other awardees included Kim Sun Tae of Korea, Mahabir Pun of Nepal, Tang Xiyang of China, Palagummi Sainath of India, Chen Guangcheng and Chung To, both of China. At least 256 Asian people have won the award in various categories since its founding in 1957. Each awardee receives a certificate, a medallion and an undisclosed cash prize. Salonga was one of the 7 Asian awardees, from China, India, South Korea, Nepal and the Philippines. He also received the prestigious Ka Pepe Diokno Human Rights Award, the premier national human rights award on February 26, 2010. Jovito Salonga was also conferred the Order of the Knights of Rizal with the highest rank, Knight Grand Cross of Rizal (KGCR).

==Personal life==
His spouse was Lydia Busuego whom he married in 1948, who died due to complications from diabetes on April 20, 2010, she was 88. Salonga&#x27;s children are Patricia, Victoria Regina, Ricardo, Esteban Fernando, and Eduardo.

==Final years and legacy==
Salonga died on March 10, 2016, due to cardiac arrest at the Philippine Heart Center in Quezon City.

Salonga has been called by his nephew Rene Saguisag (Saguisag used to call him Uncle Jovy though Salonga is actually the second cousin once removed of Saguisag, as his paternal grandmother Talia Saguisag is the first cousin of Salonga&#x27;s mother &quot;Dinang&quot; Reyes) as the finest statesman or the best president we never had, while Joker Arroyo called him the most important historical figure who influenced the nation by his words alone. Bantayog ng mga Bayani renamed its main building in its compound as the Sen. Jovito R. Salonga Building. It houses the museum, amphitheater, and the office. While Silliman University&#x27;s law school houses the Dr. Jovito R. Salonga Center for Law and Development.

Subic Naval Base has the Inang Laya Monument which shows plaques that feature handprints of the twelve senators who voted to end the military bases agreement, with Salonga&#x27;s famous speech that broke the tie included in the plaque.

In 2022, Mayor Vico Sotto of Pasig, who called Salonga his biggest hero, named the Pasig Elementary School building the Jovito R. Salonga Building.

<text>Woolworths was a British high-street variety retail chain and conglomerate. At its height, it operated as Woolworths Group PLC, which included other companies such as the entertainment distributor Entertainment UK, and book and resource distributor Bertram Books.

The Woolworths chain was originally a division of the American F. W. Woolworth Company until its sale in the early 1980s, it had more than 800 shops in the UK prior to closure. Woolworths sold many goods and had its own Ladybird children&#x27;s clothing range, WorthIt! value range and Chad Valley toys. They were also well known for selling pick &#x27;n&#x27; mix sweets. It was sometimes referred to as &quot;Woolies&quot; by the UK media, the general public, and occasionally in its own television adverts. The British company also owned and operated divisions in the Republic of Ireland which closed in 1984, and Cyprus which was sold in 1985.

On 26 November 2008, trading of shares in Woolworths Group was suspended, and its Woolworths and Entertainment UK subsidiaries entered administration. Deloitte closed all 807 Woolworths shops between 27 December 2008 and 6 January 2009, resulting in 27,000 job losses. Woolworths Group plc entered administration on 27 January 2009, and it was officially dissolved on 13 October 2015. The collapse of Woolworths was a symbol of the credit crunch and financial turmoil in the United Kingdom at the end of 2008.

In February 2009, Shop Direct Group (later known as The Very Group) purchased the Woolworths brand and website, which continued as an online-only business, until its closure in June 2015 when it was merged into Very.co.uk. 

In July 2021, the former German division of the F.W. Woolworth Company, Woolworth Deutschland, acquired the British and Irish Woolworths brand and website from The Very Group for an undisclosed sum. In January 2024, Woolworth Deutschland&#x27;s chief executive told BBC News that the UK was on his &quot;bucket list&quot; of destinations for international expansion.

==History==
===Establishment of the business===

The British branch of the F. W. Woolworth Company, which had been founded in Pennsylvania, F. W. Woolworth &amp; Co. Ltd, was founded by Frank Woolworth in Liverpool, England, on 5 November 1909. Frank Woolworth had ancestry in Woolley, Cambridgeshire— Frank claimed he had traced his ancestry through the Founding Fathers of the district to a small &quot;farm in middle England&quot;. When Frank eventually travelled to England in 1890, he docked in Liverpool and travelled by train to Stoke-on-Trent for the purchase of china and glassware for Woolworth&#x27;s ranges, but also noted his love of England in his diary and his aspirations for bringing the Woolworth name to England:

During the buying trip, Woolworth met a young clerk, William Lawrence Stephenson, who was recommended to him by John Wanamaker. Wanamaker had established a large chain of department stores across the United States and was one of Woolworth&#x27;s heroes. Stephenson was invited to London to meet Woolworth again, and was offered the job as director of the new company, which he accepted.

After the idea for the creation of the British business, Frank Woolworth had offered invitations to shope managers in the United States to establish shops in the UK and had only received offers to take positions at the time of his illness in March 1909 from Fred Woolworth of the Sixth Avenue and Samuel Balfour of the 14th Street shops in New York City. After these initial offers, Byron Miller, a superintendent in a Boston shop, also offered his assistance and set sail with the other volunteers on the steam boat &quot;Kaiserin Auguste Victoria&quot; on 29 May 1909 for England from Hoboken.

Frank Woolworth expected other members of staff to admire the volunteers in establishing FW Woolworth &amp; Co in Britain. However, Carson C. Peck, vice president and general manager of the company, had reservations with enlisting staff members to travel to Britain, questioning whether Woolworth had indeed created the new business adventure following a dream, or due to his dissatisfaction with the current condition of the American branch.

Peck also asked those who were willing to volunteer to reconsider their decision, claiming that those who had volunteered were unaware of the uncertainty and risks involved and that some were only tentatively willing to engage in Woolworth&#x27;s new endeavour: His concerns mainly centred on the fact that the majority of the managers who followed the decision did so out of loyalty to Woolworth, and that moving such a valuable resource already established in the United States to what was a financially unproven &quot;Little Infant&quot; in the UK would have a detrimental effect upon the &quot;Bread and Butter&quot; of the Company.

===1900s-1910s===
Despite reservations such as Peck&#x27;s, the decision to launch in the United Kingdom went ahead as previously planned by Woolworth. He considered several locations for the first shops, together with future possible sites. The chosen location for the first shop was 25-25A Church Street and 8 Williamson Street in the centre of Liverpool (the street addresses of the different entrances). It opened on 5 November 1909 with a performance by a full orchestra, circus acts and fireworks.

As a means of adherence to American trading tradition, only viewing of items was allowed on the first day of the shop&#x27;s opening. This included guests being given complementary tea while being entertained by a traditional brass band in the refreshment room. The event was reported positively by the local newspaper, &quot;the Liverpool Courier&quot;, which praised the decor of the shops along with the value and range of items on sale.

Despite local press praise, British national newspaper the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; likened Frank Woolworth to American showman P. T. Barnum and claimed that the location had been decided as part of a contingency plan in the event of failure so as to facilitate escape from any financial liability. Despite these reservations, the shop proved to be a success; large queues outside and low priced 3d. and 6d. (&quot;threepenny and sixpenny&quot;) items leading to it being almost stripped bare of goods before the end of the first day of trading and being attributed to mass purchased mass-produced foreign and local goods.

The business expanded into Ireland, opening a shop on Grafton Street in Dublin on 23 April 1914 Plans and one on High Street in Belfast on 6 November 1915.

At the onset of the First World War, F.W. Woolworth &amp; Co. had 40 shops in Great Britain and Ireland located in most major cities - from which a total of 57 staff including shop managers had enlisted; the majority of whom did not return after the end of the war in 1918. Despite American staff again offering their services to the Woolworths branches in Britain, remaining staff increased their efforts to cope with the lack of staff members throughout the war with several staff members being promoted to managerial positions.

Shops in the United States, which were then stocking ranges also present in British shops, were dependent upon European manufacturers which had adopted newer production methods than their American counterparts. 

===1920s-1930s===

After the First World War, the company continued to expand with the opening of further branches. By 1923 there were 130 branches, and William Lawrence Stephenson (1880–1963) became managing director. He implemented a strategy of major expansion, with the company buying or building freehold properties. Many of the shops had distinctive faience tiled art deco frontages. The expansion was funded entirely out of earnings and without any borrowing or further capitalisation. The 400th branch, at Southport, Lancashire, opened on 12 July 1930, and the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1931. The US parent company reduced its holding in the company to 51.7% at that time. In 1934, the 600th shop was opened, in Wallington in Surrey.

===1940s-1950s===

Expansion was effectively suspended between 1940 and 1950, owing to the Second World War and post-war restrictions, but then resumed. The 800th branch, at Wilton Road, Victoria, London, opened in September 1953.

A shop was opened in Kingston in Jamaica in 1954. This was followed in 1959 by one in Salisbury in Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe); its layout was based on that of a shop in Guildford. Woolworth also operated shops in Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago and the West Indies.

On 22 May 1958, the 1000th branch (known as &quot;Portslade&quot; to distinguish it from the existing Hove branch) opened in Boundary Road, Hove. The peak of 1,141 branches was reached in the late 1960s. From then until the US parent sold out in 1982, a number of branches were closed and sold, and at the time that ownership shifted to the UK, there were about 1,000 branches.

===1960s-1970s===

Woolworths tried the large out-of-town or hypermarket format in the 1960s with the Woolco shops. While some of these were closed, the majority were sold to the Dee Corporation in the early 1980s and reopened as Gateway hypermarkets, later being taken over by Asda.

One of Woolworths&#x27; flagship locations, on Briggate in Leeds, suffered a major fire in 1969. The shop, which opened in 1913, was spread over four floors and sustained extensive damage, requiring a total refit. The shop was not open to the public at the time and the building was evacuated, avoiding fatalities, although some staff suffered minor injuries. It took several hours for the fire to be fully extinguished.

===1980s-1990s===
In 1982, the British Woolworths and its sister chain B&amp;Q were acquired by Paternoster Stores Ltd, the forerunner of Kingfisher plc. Woolworths Group plc was formed by the demerger of Kingfisher&#x27;s general merchandise business, and began trading as a listed company on the London Stock Exchange on 28 August 2003, using the symbol WLW.

In October 1984, the Woolworths shops in the Republic of Ireland were closed. In August 1996, market research was undertaken by Woolworths investigating opportunities to re-enter the Republic of Ireland market. About 32 potential locations were identified that could support a Woolworths location. However, the project did not proceed beyond the market research phase.
During the 1980s, management rationalised merchandise lines into clearly defined categories: entertainment, home, children (toys and clothing) and confectionery. Many Woolworths branches were downsized during this time. Older branches in major cities were sometimes almost as large as the major department stores nearby. In 1987, for example, Woolworths left its five-floor branch on Briggate in Leeds (now occupied by House of Fraser), which it had occupied since 1913, and kept only its smaller single-level branch in the Merrion Centre. This was in an area of the city centre which had less pedestrian traffic, of shoppers who were generally on a lower budget.

Woolworths did have several smaller outlets during the 1990s which sold music and confectionery. Smaller outlets with a similar format were also tried at the Sheffield Meadowhall Shopping Centre, but closed in 2003; the Manchester Music and Video shop was superseded by a larger MVC shop, owned by Woolworths Group.

In the late 1990s, the management extended the Woolworths brand into other retail formats and alternative channels to accelerate growth by taking advantage of changing retail trends. Some larger-format shops were opened under the Big W brand, similar to Wal-Mart in the US. Although it was successful at the beginning, the format failed to catch on; the original plan had relied upon leveraging the involvement of other Kingfisher group retailers, but following the de-merger this was no longer possible.

===2000s-2010s===

Following a period of losses, Woolworths confirmed in 2004 it would abandon the Big W concept. The group sold seven of the 21 Big W shops in 2005 to Tesco and Asda. The gross internal floor area of the remaining sites was reduced to an optimum trading size of around 40,000 to . Following this, they were rebranded as Woolworths Out of Town shops.

The newly independent Woolworths faced severe competitive and financial pressures. The market for physical copies of music, one of Woolworths&#x27; main money spinners, shrank in the early 21st century; specialist music chains such as Our Price collapsed. The major supermarket chains expanded into many of Woolworths&#x27; product areas, and the fast-expanding Wilkinson challenged it directly on the high street.

Woolworths did not generally follow the trend started in the 1980s of opening shops at out-of-town relocations. One of its few out-of-town shops opened at Dudley&#x27;s Merry Hill Shopping Centre in 1989, but this closed within a few years due to disappointing trade.
In an attempt to raise the group&#x27;s corporate profile under the chairmanship of Gerald Corbett, Woolworths sponsored a show garden at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show in 2004. Designed by a group of graduate students from Pickard School of Garden Design, the contemporary-formal style garden was awarded a silver medal.
In the middle of 2006 the business launched an in-store collection service for items ordered on their website or in-store, to complement the already established in-store ordering system. In late September 2006, the Big Red Book was launched, to compete directly with the Argos catalogue.

Woolworths launched the &quot;WorthIt!&quot; brand as a value range in 2007. The first advertising campaign for the brand aired on 15 June 2007 and introduced the characters of Wooly the sheep and Worth the sheepdog. Further advertising campaigns featured celebrities such as Rolf Harris, Jackie Chan and Kelly Osbourne. The brand covered a wide variety of products including confectionery, electricals, alcohol, jewellery, perfumes and clothing.

Woolworths had a strongly unionised workforce, with shop stewards such as Paul Thompson of Unite (formerly the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union) particularly active in the north of the UK.

In July 2008, the board rejected a bid from Iceland founder Malcolm Walker to buy Woolworths&#x27; 819 shops for £50m. Walker&#x27;s bid did not include Entertainment UK or the stake in 2 Entertain, and also avoided taking on Woolworths&#x27; debt and pension liabilities.

On 12 August 2008, Woolworths Group announced the appointment of Steve Johnson, former chief executive officer of Focus DIY, to the post of chief executive. He replaced Trevor Bish-Jones, who had left in June. Woolworths scrapped its interim dividend in September 2008, after it announced a pre-tax loss of £99.7m for the six months to 2 August. At the same time, Johnson outlined a possible turnaround plan to sell 120 shops, axe a quarter of its products, reduce web operations and cut jobs.

At that time, the retailer&#x27;s largest shareholder was Iranian property developer Ardeshir Naghshineh, with a 10.2% stake. A consortium led by Icelandic investor Baugur, called Unity owned a 10% stake in Woolworths. In October 2008 Sir Alan Sugar, founder of electronics firm Amstrad, increased his stake in Woolworths to around 4%. Theo Paphitis, owner of stationery retailer Ryman, also stated his interest in the company.

The 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession reduced availability of credit and consumer spending.
On 19 November 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that the Woolworths&#x27; retail business was a target for restructuring specialist Hilco UK, who would buy the retail arm for a nominal £1; this was confirmed the same day. The deal would have left Woolworths Group with its profitable distribution and publishing businesses and a reduced debt load. Ardeshir Naghshineh criticised the plan, recommending instead that the company sell some of the shops to raise more funds.

The group&#x27;s banks, GMAC and Burdale, rejected the deal and recalled their loans, forcing the group to place the retail business and Entertainment UK into administration. On 26 November 2008, the trading of shares in Woolworths PLC was suspended, and Neville Kahn, Dan Butters and Nick Dargan of Deloitte were appointed joint administrators. When the company entered administration it had a debt of £385 million. The administrators announced that they were aiming to keep the company as a going concern over the crucial Christmas period, although analysts feared that any heavy discounting would create a domino effect and drag down other high street retailers. Deloitte later announced they had received &quot;substantial interest&quot; in Woolworths.

When news of Woolworths&#x27; entry into administration was widely publicised, National Lottery operator Camelot immediately suspended Woolworths from selling their lottery tickets and scratch cards, as well as preventing claimants from redeeming prizes at the shops.

On 5 December 2008, Woolworths recorded their greatest single day takings of £27 million, and axed 450 head office and support staff jobs. A closing-down sale started on 11 December.
On 17 December 2008, administrators announced that all 807 Woolworths locations would close by 5 January 2009 (later changed to 6 January), with 27,000 job losses. Deloitte&#x27;s Neville Kahn also said that it was unclear how much of Woolworths&#x27; debt would be paid. In the last few days of trading discounts of up to 90% were offered, and a number of shops sold all of their stock, many selling all of their fixtures and fittings too.

The shops were closed in phases, and the final two closing days were moved back a day to try to sell more of the remaining stock and to ease logistics of closing.

* 207 shops closed on 27 December 2008
* 37 closed on 29 December
* 164 closed on 30 December
* 200 closed on 3 January 2009
* remaining shops (199) closed on 6 January 2009

The former chief executive of Kingfisher, Woolworths&#x27; former parent company, and Ardeshir Naghshineh, a major shareholder of Woolworths, criticised the closures.

On 19 January 2009, the owner, Woolworths Group, announced its intention to also enter administration, as it could no longer pay its debts. The application was heard by the High Court on 27 January, and Woolworths Group PLC entered administration.

The trade unions complained of the collective redundancies and they started various legal actions before the UK tribunals based on the absence of proper consultation of the employee representatives. The UK Court of Appeal referred the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union which partially disagreed with the unions by an important decision of 30 April 2015.

===2020s===

In October 2020, an unverified Twitter account named @UKWoolworths announced that Woolworths UK was planning to relaunch. The announcement was reported by dozens of mainstream British websites, including MailOnline and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. Within hours the Very Group, the owner of the Woolworths brand, confirmed that the account was a hoax. The stunt was perpetrated by a teenage student, Luke Castle, who claimed to have run it as an experiment &quot;testing the brand loyalty of the British public&quot;.

In January 2024, it was announced that Woolworths may make a return 15 years after it closed, when the German company announced its expansion throughout Europe and the UK was one of its high priorites and this looks more likely, following the closure of Wilko just a year earlier in the UK.

==Aftermath of insolvency in the UK==

===Former shops===

The administrators announced on 10 December 2008, that they were having difficulty selling the company as a going concern, and as a result some shops might close before the end of the month. Talks were still progressing to sell individual shops and leases to a number of retailers, said to include the supermarket chains Morrisons, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury&#x27;s, The Co-operative Group and Poundland.

In December 2008, Woolworths executive Tony Page and former UBS banker Gareth Thomas were trying to raise around £30,000,000 to relaunch the brand after closure with a chain of 125 shops. However, a deal could not be met in time. The government was also asked in a final attempt to make the deal but without success.

Then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown noted that the government had considered saving Woolworths, but they concluded that it was a &quot;financially unviable&quot; business.

The supermarket chain Iceland bought 51 of the shops on 9 January 2009 for an undisclosed sum. Baugur, one of the major shareholders of Woolworths, partly owns Iceland, and Baugur UK itself entered administration in February. A further five former shops in Wales were bought by The Original Factory Shop in April 2009. Across the UK, shops were sporadically replaced by other retailers such as Next, Boyes, Boots, Primark, TK Maxx, Home Bargains, and W H Smith.

In August 2010, the BBC reported that over 300 (i.e., approximately 40%) of former Woolworths outlets remained empty, and that the largest group now using former Woolworths shops were discount retailers - such as Poundland. By January 2012, it was reported that there were still 105 empty former Woolworths shops, and a further 68 had been demolished.

===Alworths===
According to press reports on 17 February 2009, Tony Page and Gareth Thomas were planning to open a chain of shops adopting the Woolworths format, but under a different name. A shop opened under the Alworths name on 5 November 2009 in Didcot, on the site of a former Woolworths shop, without the involvement of Page or Thomas. By January 2011, 18 shops had been opened, although in April the company also entered administration and closed.

===Wellworths===
The Woolworths shop in Dorchester, Dorset was reopened as an independent business named &quot;Wellworths&quot; by the shop manager Claire Robertson. It was officially opened by BBC Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans on 11 March 2009. It was later renamed &quot;Wellchester&quot;.

Wellchester ceased trading in August 2012, after Robertson left to set up her own retail consultancy business.

===Woolworths.co.uk===

The Woolworths brand and domain was bought by Shop Direct Group, owned by Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay, on 2 February 2009. &quot;The Times&quot; estimated that they would have paid between £5 million and £10 million for the brand. Woolworths also launched an Easter egg website, called &quot;Woolies Wonderland&quot;, for Easter 2009. The company announced it would relaunch Woolworths as an online retailer. The website was launched on 26 June 2009. It has been closed since June 2015.

==Incidents==
===Disasters===
====New Cross, London====
Many branches of Woolworths suffered severe bomb damage and even destruction during the Luftwaffe attacks in the early part of the Second World War. However it was towards the end of the war that the largest civilian loss of life due to direct enemy fire in Britain during the conflict occurred when, at lunchtime on 25 November 1944, a German V-2 rocket fell on a packed Woolworths shop in New Cross Road, killing 168 people (including 15 children), injuring 122 others and razing the building to the ground. The neighbouring London Co-operative Society shop was also demolished in the attack. The shop was especially busy as news of a delivery of hard-to-obtain saucepans generated huge crowds, many of whom were queueing outside at the time of the rocket&#x27;s impact.

Planning and economic restrictions after the war meant Woolworths did not build a replacement shop on the site until 1960; this closed in 1984. It was reported that some employees there felt the building was haunted.

Lewisham Council and Woolworths erected a plaque on the site commemorating those who died that day. There is now an Iceland supermarket on the site.

===Fire safety===
During the period from 1971 to 1981 a series of fires occurred in Woolworths premises which brought into sharp focus the company&#x27;s complacent attitude towards fire safety, a policy which culminated in a number of fatalities.

====Central Warehouse, Rochdale====
On 6 May 1971, a fire broke out at the main distribution depot at Rochdale, Lancashire. The site was split into three sections, along with an administration block that housed the company’s new mainframe computer system and all stock and accounting records. The fire soon spread owing to the failure of the sprinkler system; this led to administration staff frantically dis-assembling the computer and passing parts of it, along with stock cards and other records, out of windows onto waiting lorries.

Over 100 fire fighters attended the blaze and they managed to save two-thirds of the building with no loss of life. The resultant insurance payout of £3m was the highest of its kind in the north-west of England at that time.

====High Street, Colchester====
On 2 October 1973, a fire broke out in the storeroom of the shop at 40-50 High Street, Colchester. The blaze soon spread to the rest of the shop and the building was totally destroyed. Although all customers and staff were evacuated, subsequent findings blamed a lack of a sprinkler system (which was not, and still is not, a legal requirement) and poor procedures in place for staff to deal with fires and evacuations.

====Central Manchester====
A fire erupted just after 1pm on 8 May 1979 at the Manchester shop opposite Piccadilly Gardens, said at the time to be the largest Woolworths in Europe, with six floors plus two basement levels. The fire, which started in the second floor furnishing department, killed nine shoppers and one member of staff, of whom three were found just six feet away from an exit with another three bodies nearby. Of the 12 calls made to the fire service that day, none came from the shop itself. It is believed that the fire was started by a damaged electrical cable, which had furniture stacked in front of it. An inquiry showed that, although the shop&#x27;s fire precautions met all legal requirements, the spread of the fire and the high number of casualties were in part due to the absence of measures such as a fire sprinkler system to stop the spread of the fire from the furniture department, and the use of polyurethane foam in the furnishings, a material which is highly inflammable and highly toxic, but cheap and, at that time, legal in furniture. This finding would have consequences for later safety legislation.

The second floor was gutted by the fire, while the third floor suffered severe smoke damage; the ground, first and second floors all received extensive water damage when the fire was extinguished. Due to the loss of life and devastation to the Manchester shop, the Fire Research Station conducted a number of tests to develop sprinkler systems that could handle a similar large department store fire. However, there is still no legal requirement for United Kingdom retailers to have a sprinkler system in place, with many preferring to focus on evacuation procedures rather than fire containment. The catastrophe also resulted in modifications to the Fire Precautions Act and was among the factors that led to the ban on the use of polyurethane foam in home furnishings (a long-time concern of the fire service) forcing furniture manufacturers to develop new fabrics and materials for sofas and other items.

The fire brought graphic images into the public consciousness (including footage of female office staff trapped behind barred windows on the top floor) due to the shop&#x27;s location next to the then studios of BBC Manchester (above the National Westminster Bank) and near to those of Granada Television, the offices of the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; and the northern offices of several national newspapers.

The disaster has become a significant object of study for academics interested in the behaviour of people in emergency situations, after research showed a number of customers (predominately in the public restaurant area) refused to leave despite the sounding of alarms, requests from staff and even the smell and visibility of smoke; some even continued to queue at an abandoned check-out. The majority of those who perished were in this area.

The shop was re-opened, but closed in 1986. The site became an amusement arcade for many years, until the building owners evicted the tenants in favour of a building renovation to house a 157-room Travelodge hotel, a Morrisons convenience shop, and Zizzi and Nando&#x27;s restaurants.

====Worcester====
On 1 October 1979, the Woolworths shop located in Worcester&#x27;s High Street was severely damaged in a large fire. There were no casualties but the shop remained closed for several months until it re-opened in 1980. It was later discovered that the fire was purposely started by a disgruntled staff member, and was worsened by the fact there was no sprinkler system.

====Wimbledon Broadway====
In 1981, a fire was discovered in a storeroom at the shop in Wimbledon. Better staff training as a result of the Manchester fire led to a successful evacuation, but the building was totally destroyed by the blaze. A firefighter was killed when he and two colleagues became trapped when the upper levels of the building collapsed.

As a result of the damage caused to the reputation of the business by these events, the American parent owners decided to sell the British operation to Paternoster Stores, which was eventually renamed Kingfisher. The company actively promoted the use of smoke detectors after these fires, a policy which helped increase their usage and reduce their cost.

===Terrorism===
As a result of the targeting of high-profile British businesses in Northern Ireland by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during The Troubles, a number of Woolworth shops suffered significant damage.

====High Street, Belfast====
This was the flagship Woolworths shop in Northern Ireland. It suffered a series of incendiary attacks, with one such attack in 1972 gutting the shop. Owing to telephoned warnings, no-one was killed in any of these attacks.

====Bognor Regis Incident====
On the 3rd of August 1994, two bombs were planted in bags placed on bicycles outside Woolworths shop. The Bognor Regis bomb detonated damaging shops but resulted in no casualties, the Brighton bomb was located and defuzed. The one in Bognor Regis was hidden in the pannier of a bicycle and locked to a post outside the Woolworths shop, London Road. 15 shops were damaged after it exploded at closing time around 5:57 pm, littering the street with glass.

The Bognor Regis incident prompted a security alert along the south coast seaside resorts and the Brighton bike bomb was subsequently located. The Brighton bike bomb pannier contained 2.5kg of Semtex explosive along with an IRA Time Power Unit (TPU).

==== Bangor, County Down ====
Woolworths&#x27; shop at 18/22 Main Street, Bangor, County Down, Northern Ireland (Shop No. 380) was targeted by terrorists on 30 March 1974 as part of co-ordinated incendiary bomb attack on the town centre.

At 5pm, a telephone warning was received that 15 incendiary devices had been placed in the town centre and were due to explode in 30 minutes. Immediate and successful efforts were made by the police to evacuate the commercial centre of the town, however there was inadequate time to prevent the devices from exploding. The Woolworths shop was badly damaged after a device exploded on the sales floor. A policeman suffered concussion after he was blown off his feet by the blast from the device, and a female civilian was cut by flying debris.

Other shops targeted in the attack included the town&#x27;s Co-operative Department Store and FA Wellworth Department Store. The town&#x27;s Woolworths shop was demolished after the attack. A new shop was built on the same site, which reopened in the mid 1970s.

The rebuilt shop suffered minor damage after a 200 lb car bomb exploded a short distance away, near the town&#x27;s FA Wellworth&#x27;s shop on the evening of 21 October 1992. Nobody was injured in the explosion, which occurred after most shops in the town centre had closed for the day. However, significant damage was caused to the entrance area of the Woolworths&#x27; shop, with windows being blown out, the porch roof being destroyed and a small quantity of stock toward the front of the shop being damaged. Additionally, minor structural damage was caused to the shop&#x27;s storeroom with two internal portioning walls adjacent to the generator room and fixtures having to be rebuilt. The shop recommenced trading on 23 October 1992.

==Music==

Woolworths was for many years a leader in the UK music industry. In the 1950s and well into the 1960s, Woolworths issued recordings available only via its shops on its own label Embassy Records, produced and manufactured by Oriole Records. These releases were double-sided singles featuring two cover versions of current hit singles sold at a much cheaper price. This venture was very successful at the time, but was eventually killed off when other record companies started to issue compilation albums. However, Woolworths remained in the music business selling a wide range of singles and albums, and remained the UK&#x27;s biggest music retailer well into the 1990s. Even successful nationwide music specialist shops such as Virgin Megastores and HMV did not overtake Woolworths during this time. They later suffered from strong competition in this field from the large supermarket chains Tesco and Asda.

==Cafés==
In the early days many Woolworths locations had cafés. However, as the years went on and many larger shops were either closed or downscaled, fewer had cafés. When the shops finally ceased trading in 2008/9, only around 10% of them had cafés. These were usually located at the back of the shops or, when a shop had a second sales floor, they were located either in the basement or upstairs on the first floor. They sold the usual range of hot and cold drinks, with hot food available, including breakfasts and lunch-time meals.

==Subsidiaries==
===Entertainment UK===

Entertainment UK (EUK) was founded as Record Merchandisers Limited in 1966 by EMI Music Publishing to distribute music to non-specialist retailers. It later became a joint venture between a number of record companies. Woolworths became Entertainment UK&#x27;s largest customer and in 1986 Record Merchandisers Limited was acquired by Kingfisher plc. Record Merchandisers was renamed Entertainment UK in 1988.

EUK became the property of Woolworths Group plc after the de-merger from Kingfisher in 2001. In 2006, Woolworths Group acquired Total Home Entertainment Distribution Limited (THE) and combined it with EUK. In November 2007 the company acquired the book wholesaler and distributor Bertram Books.

EUK was the main supplier of Zavvi under an exclusive supply deal. As a result of EUK entering into administration, on 24 December the music retailer was also forced into administration as it was unable to source stock on favourable terms direct from suppliers. Zavvi later closed entirely, but still continues to this day as an online retailer.

===Streets Online===

Streets Online, founded in 1996 by Stephen Cole, was one of the pioneers of online retailing in the UK. The company was the name behind the online bookseller Alphabetstreet and music site Audiostreet. 85% of the company was bought out by the Kingfisher Group in 2000 for £15.7 million, and then became part of the Woolworths Group with its de-merger in 2001. It then became responsible for the web operations of MVC and Tesco. When Kingfisher bought this 85%, the remaining 15% was owned by Sky New Media Ventures (part of BSkyB). In 2003 the company headquarters was moved to the EUK site in Hayes.

===2 Entertain===

2 Entertain was established in September 2004 as a joint venture between the Woolworths Group, and BBC Worldwide. It combined the group&#x27;s former video publishing, music publishing and video production business (Video Collection International) with BBC Worldwide&#x27;s former video publishing business (BBC Video), BBC Worldwide would hold 60%, while the Woolworths Group would hold 40%, additionally, both BBC Worldwide and Woolworths Group wanted 2 Entertain to better compete with the major studios. After negotiations with Woolworth Group&#x27;s administrators, BBC Worldwide purchased Woolworths&#x27; 40% stake in 2 Entertain in March 2010 for £17 million, taking full ownership of the company and would eventually be renamed BBC Studios Home Entertainment (although 2 Entertain is still the legal name of the company).

==Brands==
===Winfield===
The Winfield brand was launched by Woolworths in 1963 and continued until the 1980s. Goods sold under the brand included household cleaners, groceries, kitchenware, perfumes and other ranges such as fishing tackle.

===Chad Valley===

Chad Valley was launched in 1991 to create an own label range of merchandise. The Chad Valley brand name, which has been in existence since 1860, is used on a range of toys and games suitable for children under 8 years old. Home Retail Group, then the parent company of Argos and Homebase, purchased the brand for £5 million on 20 January 2009. Chad Valley first appeared exclusively in the Autumn/Winter 2009 Argos catalogue.

===Ladybird===

Ladybird was a brand of children&#x27;s wear for children aged 0–10 years which was sold exclusively in Woolworths. Before the collapse of the Woolworths chain it was ranked third overall in the childrenswear market, with a market share of 5%. Woolworths purchased rights to the Ladybird brand in 1984, purchasing it outright from Coats Viyella in 2001. The brand has a history which dates back to a trading partnership beginning in 1934 between the original firm Adolf Pasold &amp; Son and Woolworths. On 1 February 2009, Shop Direct Group purchased the brand and whole rights from the administrators.

<doc id="1063647" wikidata="Q1051638" url="?curid=1063647" title="90 nm process">
<text>The 90 nm process refers to the technology used in semiconductor manufacturing to create integrated circuits with a minimum feature size of 90 nanometers. It was an advancement over the previous 130 nm process. Eventually, it was succeeded by smaller process nodes, such as the 65 nm, 45 nm, and 32 nm processes.

It was commercialized by the 2003–2005 timeframe, by semiconductor companies including Toshiba, Sony, Samsung, IBM, Intel, Fujitsu, TSMC, Elpida, AMD, Infineon, Texas Instruments and Micron Technology.

The origin of the 90 nm value is historical; it reflects a trend of 70% scaling every 2–3 years. The naming is formally determined by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS).

The 300 mm wafer size became mainstream at the 90 nm node. The previous wafer size was 200 mm diameter.

The 193 nm wavelength was introduced by many (but not all) companies for lithography of critical layers mainly during the 90 nm node. Yield issues associated with this transition (due to the use of new photoresists) were reflected in the high costs associated with this transition.

Since at least 1997, &quot;process nodes&quot; have been named purely on a marketing basis, and have no relation to the dimensions on the integrated circuit; neither gate length, metal pitch or gate pitch on a &quot;90nm&quot; device is ninety nanometers. 

==History==
A 90nm silicon MOSFET was fabricated by Iranian engineer Ghavam Shahidi (later IBM director) with D.A. Antoniadis and H.I. Smith at MIT in 1988. The device was fabricated using X-ray lithography.

Toshiba, Sony and Samsung developed a 90nm process during 20012002, before being introduced in 2002 for Toshiba&#x27;s eDRAM and Samsung&#x27;s 2Gb NAND flash memory. IBM demonstrated a 90nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS process, with development led by Shahidi, in 2002. The same year, Intel demonstrated a 90nm strained-silicon process. Fujitsu commercially introduced its 90nm process in 2003 followed by TSMC in 2004.

Gurtej Singh Sandhu of Micron Technology initiated the development of atomic layer deposition high-k films for DRAM memory devices. This helped drive cost-effective implementation of semiconductor memory, starting with 90nm node DRAM. 

Intel&#x27;s 90nm process has a transistor density of 1.45 million transistors per square milimeter (MTr/mm2).

* Use of KrF (248 nm) lithography with optical proximity correction
* 512 Mbit
* 1.8 V operation
* Derivative of earlier 110 nm and 100 nm processes

<text>Angary (&#x27;; &quot;; &quot;; from the [[Ancient Greek]] ,&#x27;, &quot;the office of an (courier or messenger)&quot;) is the right of a belligerent (most commonly, a government or other party in conflict) to seize and use, for the purposes of war or to prevent the enemy from doing so, any kind of property on belligerent territory - including what may belong to subjects or citizens of a neutral state.

Article 53 of the regulations respecting &quot;the Laws and Customs of War on Land&quot;, annexed to the Hague Convention of 1899 on the same subject, provides that railway plant, land telegraphs, telephones, steamers and other ships (other than such as are governed by maritime law), though belonging to companies or private persons, may be used for military operations but &quot;must be restored at the conclusion of peace and indemnities paid for them&quot;. Article 54 adds that &quot;the plant of railways coming from neutral states, whether the property of those states or of companies or private persons, shall be sent back to them as soon as possible.&quot;

The articles seem to sanction the right of angary against neutral property and to limit it as against both belligerent and neutral property. It may be considered, however, that the right to use implies as wide a range of contingencies as the &quot;necessity of war&quot; can be made to cover.

<text>The Rossby parameter (or simply beta formula_1) is a number used in geophysics and meteorology which arises due to the meridional variation of the Coriolis force caused by the spherical shape of the Earth. It is important in the generation of Rossby waves. The Rossby parameter formula_1 is given by

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the Coriolis parameter, formula_5 is the latitude, formula_6 is the angular speed of the Earth&#x27;s rotation, and formula_7 is the mean radius of the Earth. Although both involve Coriolis effects, the Rossby parameter describes the &quot;variation&quot; of the effects with latitude (hence the latitudinal derivative), and should not be confused with the Rossby number.

<doc id="1063661" wikidata="Q141581" url="?curid=1063661" title="EDIFACT">
<text>United Nations/Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport (UN/EDIFACT) is an international standard for electronic data interchange (EDI) developed for the United Nations and approved and published by UNECE, the UN Economic Commission for Europe.

In 1987, following the convergence of the UN and US/ANSI syntax proposals, the UN/EDIFACT Syntax Rules were approved as the ISO standard ISO 9735 by the International Organization for Standardization.

The EDIFACT standard provides:
* a set of syntax rules to structure data
* an interactive exchange protocol (I-EDI)
* standard messages which allow multi-country and multi-industry exchange

The work of maintenance and further development of this standard is done through the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) under the UN Economic Commission for Europe, in the Finance Domain working group UN CEFACT TBG5.

== Example ==
See below for an example of an EDIFACT message used to answer a flight ticket (FRA-JFK-MIA) availability request:

The UNA segment is optional. If present, it specifies the special characters that are to be used to interpret the remainder of the message. There are six characters following codice_1 in this order:
* component data element separator ( in this sample)
* data element separator ( in this sample)
* decimal mark ( in this sample)
* release character ( in this sample)
* reserved, must be a space
* segment terminator ( in this sample)

With the exception of the decimal mark (see below), the special characters in the sample UNA segment above are also the default values.

The component data element separator and data element separator are the &quot;first level&quot; and &quot;second level&quot; separators of data elements within a message segment. Referring to them as + and : for brevity, the + separates top-level or composite data elements, and : separates second-level data elements nested within composite data elements. Trailing empty (or null) data elements and their leading separators are omitted to reduce message size.

The decimal mark is used to separate the integer from the fractional part of non-integer numbers. The optional nature of the UNA segment and the initial choice of the comma (&quot;) as the default decimal mark provide a source of common confusion. Versions 1 through 3 of the ISO 9735 syntax rules specify the comma as the default; version 4 states that the decimal mark position in the UNA segment is to be ignored and that the comma and the dot (&quot;) may be used indifferently in numeric data values. The UNB segment indicates which version of the syntax rules is in effect.

Release character (analogous to the in regular expressions) is used as a prefix to remove special meaning from the separator, segment termination, and release characters when they are used as plain text (&quot;Escape character&quot; is the equivalent North American term).

Segment terminator indicates the end of a message segment.

Note: The line breaks after each segment in this example have been added for readability. There are typically no line breaks in EDI data.

- This is the message header segment which is required at the start of every message. This code specifies that the message name and version is PAORES 93 revision 1 and it was defined by the organisation IA (IATA).

codice_2 - This is an &quot;Interactive Free Text&quot; segment containing the text &quot;NO MORE FLIGHTS&quot;.

codice_3 - This is the message trailer segment. It indicated that the message sent contains 13 segments.

== Structure ==
EDIFACT has a hierarchical structure where the top level is referred to as an &quot;interchange&quot;, and lower levels contain multiple &quot;messages&quot; which consist of &quot;segments&quot;, which in turn consist of &quot;composites&quot;. The final iteration is an &quot;element&quot; which is derived from the United Nations Trade Data Element Directory (UNTDED); these are normalized throughout the EDIFACT standard.

A group or segment can be mandatory (M) or conditional (C) and can be specified to repeat. 
For example :
 - C99 indicates between 0 and 99 repetitions of a segment or group
 - M99 signifies between 1 and 99 repetitions of a segment or group

A group, like a message, is a sequence of segments or groups. The first segment or group beneath a group must be mandatory, and the group should be made conditional if the logic of the situation demands it.

 |_Service String Advice UNA Optional

<doc id="1063664" wikidata="Q3564112" url="?curid=1063664" title="Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network">
<text>The Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunications Network (AFTN) is a worldwide system of aeronautical fixed circuits provided, as part of the Aeronautical Fixed Service, for the exchange of messages and/or digital data between aeronautical fixed stations having the same or compatible communications characteristics. AFTN comprises aviation entities including: ANS (Air Navigation Services) providers, aviation service providers, airport authorities and government agencies, to name a few. It exchanges vital information for aircraft operations such as distress messages, urgency messages, flight safety messages, meteorological messages, flight regularity messages and aeronautical administrative messages.

== Communications infrastructure ==
The original AFTN infrastructure consisted of landline teleprinter links between the major centers. Some long distance and international links were based on duplex radioteletype transmissions and leased lines. When it upgraded to CIDIN (Common ICAO Data Interchange Network), it was upgraded to X.25 links at much higher data rates. As the Aeronautical Message Handling System (AMHS) comes online over the next decade, it will switch to X.400 links, with either dedicated lines or tunneled through IP.

IWXXM messages are lengthy and contain characters not supported by AFTN, so cannot use AFTN equipment. IWXXM requires the use of AMHS for international exchange.

== AFTN Station address format==
An AFTN address is an eight-letter-group composed of a four-letter ICAO Location Indicator plus a three-letter-group identifying an organization or service addressed and an additional letter. 
The additional letter represents a department, division or process within the organization/function addressed. The letter &quot;X&quot; is used to complete the address when an explicit identification of the department, division or process is not required.
For instance: LEBBYNY.

Location Indicator - A four-letter code group formulated in accordance with rules prescribed by ICAO and assigned to the location of an aeronautical fixed station. In the ICAO DOC7910, location indicators that are assigned to locations to which messages can not be addressed over the AFTN are identified by an asterisk(*)

The four-letter Location Indicators are listed in ICAO Doc 7910 — Location Indicators. The three-letter designators are listed in ICAO Doc 8585 — Designators for Aircraft Operating Agencies, Aeronautical Authorities and Services.

Every &quot;location&quot; (airport or other facility) with a connection to the &quot;AFS&quot; is assigned a unique four letter code (the &quot;aeronautical location indicator&quot;) by ICAO. The first letter or two letters indicate the country and the remaining two or three letters the specific location. For instance the letter K is the first letter of the four letter ICAO address location within the continental United States. The first letter for a Canadian aerodrome, or airport address, is C. Southern Europe codes begin with L, and specifically codes in Spain with LE. For example, New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy airport is KJFK while Goose Bay Canada&#x27;s airport is identified as CYYR and Bilbao in Spain as LEBB.

Some irregular four-letter codes, not assigned by ICAO, do exist and appear usually in meteorological reports.

Examples for some common three-letter-groups used in AFTN addresses in order to identify an organization or service:
:Therefore the address &quot;LEBBYNYX&quot; indicates the NOTAM office of Bilbao Airport, Spain.

== AFTN Message Format ==
The message format of AFTN messages is defined in ICAO Annex 10 Aeronautical Telecommunications Volume II.

AFTN messages consist of a Heading, the Message Text and a message Ending.

The message Heading comprises a Heading Line, the Address and the Origin. The Heading Line comprises the Start-of-Message Signal which is the four characters ZCZC, the Transmission Identification, an Additional Service Indication (if necessary) and a Spacing Signal.

The AFTN Address comprises Alignment Functions, a two-letter Priority Indicator depending on the message category and an eight-letter group (Addressee Indicator). The first four letters of the eight-letter group is a Location Indicator indicating the place of destination. The following three-letter group indicates the organization or function addressed (for instance aeronautical authority, service or aircraft operating agency). The last letter of the eight-letter represents a department, division or process within the organization/function addressed.

The Origin consists of message Filing Time (six-digit date-time-group), the Originator Indicator (eight-letter group) identifying the message originator, a Priority Alarm (used only in teletypewriter operation for Distress Messages) and Alignment Functions.

The Message Text ends with the End-of-Message Signal, which is the four characters NNNN. The Ending itself comprises twelve letter shift signals which represent also a Message-Separation Signal.
The AFTN system is backwards compatible with older transmission technology as many member states do not upgrade their AFTN centers fast enough. The message format betrays the extensive use of radioteletype links in the past. A typical message would look like:

 ZCZC LAA005 12032000
 DD OPKCZQZX
 120900 OPSTZQZX
 MESSAGE TEXT
 NNNN

Explanations:
* The first three lines in the example AFTN message above represent the Heading of the message.
* &quot;ZCZC LAA005 12032000&quot; is the Heading Line in which &quot;ZCZC&quot; is the Start-of-Message Signal. The &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;C&quot; characters do not normally occur together in standard text and provide a unique character pattern for automating the identification of the beginning of a message. &quot;LAA005&quot; refers to the Transmission Identification and &quot;12032000&quot; is an Additional Service Indication.
* The second line &quot;DD OPKCZQZX&quot; is the Address of the message. &quot;DD&quot; represents the Priority Indicator for the message category(an Urgency Message in this cases). &quot;OPKCZQZX&quot; is the eight-letter group identifying the addressee. &quot;OPKC&quot; refers to Karachi/Jinnah Intl, Pakistan. &quot;ZQZ&quot; refers to a Centre in Charge of Flight Information Region or Upper Flight Information Region&#x27;. In other words, the addressee is Karachi Area Control Centre or Karachi Flight Information Centre. The last character &quot;X&quot; indicates that an explicit identification of the organization or function addressed is not required. So the &quot;X&quot; is just used to complete the originator address.
* The third line &quot;120900 OPSTZQZX&quot; represents the Origin of the message. &quot;120900&quot; refers to the date-time-group and means the twelfth day of the month at time 09 o&#x27;clock UTC. &quot;OPSTZQZX&quot; is the originator of the message where &quot;OPSTZQZX&quot; refers to Area Control Centre or Flight Information Centre at Sialkot, Pakistan.
* The example does not give an explicit &quot;MESSAGE TEXT&quot;. In reality the contents of the message is included here.
* The Ending of the message is indicated by &quot;NNNN&quot; which is the End-of-Message Signal that also has a character pattern that is not found in standard text.
* The Alignment Functions and letter shift signals mentioned above are not visible in AFTN messages.

The message routing is easily automated by general purpose computers. Teleprinter communication with airline operators is sometimes maintained by having a connection to the IATA Type B messaging networks which use a 7 character address. The whole communications system is still rooted in the &#x27;official&#x27; nature of radioteletypes.

The older tape stations (and perhaps newer ones) also included a bell that could be rung by using a set character code. The purpose of the bell was to allow the sender to alert the receiving operator of a high priority message such as an SS message. It was also possible to insert spacing between bell rings. With care and persistence, one could compose a musical tune to play to far distant stations. Jingle bells was a favourite. A particularly clever &#x27;author&#x27; could combine the tune with an image such as a Christmas tree. The skill for this was often learnt on those long night watches when little traffic was in the air.

Other airport required reports are also transmitted through the AFTN, on daily and hourly intervals like flight plans, NOTAMs (notices to airmen), and AIRADs (Airfield Advisories).

== Message Categories ==
Via the AFTN the following message categories are submitted:
* distress messages;
* urgency messages;
* flight safety messages;
* meteorological messages;
* flight regularity messages;
* aeronautical information services (AIS) messages;
* aeronautical administrative messages;
* service messages.

== Priority Indicators ==
Priority Indicators consist of two letters SS, DD, FF, GG and KK. They are assigned depending on the messages category as follows:
* Priority Indicator SS for Distress Messages
* Priority Indicator DD for Urgency Messages
* Priority Indicator FF for Flight Safety Messages
* Priority Indicator GG for Meteorological Messages, Flight Regularity Messages and Aeronautical Information Services Messages
* Priority Indicator KK for Aeronautical Administrative Messages
* Priority Indicator used for Service Messages are assigned as considered appropriate by the originator, but most likely &quot;KK&quot; is used

== Order of Priority ==
The Priority Indicator is used to transmit AFTN messages according to their Order of Priority. So messages with Priority Indicator &quot;SS&quot; have the highest transmission priority. Messages with Priority Indicator &quot;DD&quot; and &quot;FF&quot; have the second highest transmission priority and the remaining messages with Priority Indicator &quot;GG&quot; and &quot;KK&quot; the lowest.

<text>Jill Ker Conway (9 October 1934 – 1 June 2018) was an Australian-American scholar and author. Well known for her autobiographies, in particular her first memoir, &quot;The Road from Coorain&quot;, she also was Smith College&#x27;s first woman president (1975–1985) and most recently served as a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 2004 she was designated a Women&#x27;s History Month Honoree by the National Women&#x27;s History Project. She was a recipient of the National Humanities Medal.

==Biography==
Ker Conway was born in Hillston, New South Wales, in the outback of Australia. Together with her two brothers, Ker Conway was raised in near-total isolation on a family-owned tract of land called Coorain (the Aboriginal word for &quot;windy place&quot;), which eventually grew to encompass . On Coorain, she lived a lonely life, and grew up without playmates except for her brothers. In her early years, she was schooled entirely by her mother, with the aid of correspondence class material for her primary school and early grade school education.

Ker Conway spent her youth working the sheep station; by age seven, she was an important member of the workforce, helping with such activities as herding and tending the sheep, checking the perimeter fences and transporting heavy farm supplies. The farm prospered until it was crippled by a drought that lasted seven years. This and her father&#x27;s worsening health put an increasing burden on her shoulders. When she was eleven, her father drowned in a diving accident while trying to extend the farm&#x27;s water piping.

Initially Jill Ker Conway&#x27;s mother, a nurse by profession, refused to leave Coorain. But after three more years of drought, she was compelled to move Jill and her brothers to Sydney, where the children attended school.

Ker Conway found the local state school a rough environment. The British manners and accent ingrained by her parents clashed with her peers&#x27; Australian habits, provoking and . This resulted in her mother enrolling her at Abbotsleigh, a private girls school, where Ker Conway found intellectual challenge and social acceptance. After finishing her education at Abbotsleigh, she enrolled at the University of Sydney, where she studied History and English and graduated with honours in 1958. Upon graduation, Ker Conway sought a trainee post in the Department of External Affairs, but the all-male committee turned down her application.

After this setback, she travelled through Europe with her now emotionally volatile mother. In 1960, she decided to strike out on her own and move to the United States. At age 25, she was accepted into the history program of Harvard University&#x27;s Radcliffe College, where she devoted her studies to women&#x27;s history, not yet an established historical discipline, and wrote her dissertation on Jane Addams and the establishment of Hull House. Her interest in Addams and Hull House was sparked by her neighbor and friend, former Librarian of Congress, Archibald Macleish. At Harvard, she also assisted a Canadian professor, John Conway, who was her husband from 1962 until his death in 1995. Ker Conway received her Ph.D. at Harvard in 1969 and taught at the University of Toronto from 1964 to 1975. Her book &quot;True North&quot; details her life in Toronto.

From 1975 to 1985, Ker Conway was the president of Smith College. After 1985, she was a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She received thirty-eight honorary degrees and awards from North American and Australian colleges, universities and women&#x27;s organizations.

Throughout her career, Ker Conway served as director on a variety of corporate boards. These include stints of more than a decade on the boards of Nike, Colgate-Palmolive, and Merrill Lynch. Ker Conway was also the first female Chairman of Lendlease.

After 2011, Ker Conway served as the Board Chair of Community Solutions. It is a non-profit organization with a focus on homelessness and related issues, based in New York City.

Conway died on 1 June 2018 at her home in Boston at the age of 83.

==President of Smith College==

In 1975, Ker Conway became the first female president of Smith College, the largest women&#x27;s college in the United States. Located in Northampton, Massachusetts, Smith, a private liberal arts college, is the only women&#x27;s college in the U.S. to grant its own degrees in engineering.

Ker Conway launched the Ada Comstock Scholars program, initially proposed by her predecessor Thomas Mendenhall. This program allows non-traditional students, many with work and family obligations, to study full or part-time, depending on their family and work schedules. These women can take classes for a bachelor&#x27;s degree over a longer period of time. Conway House, dedicated in 2006, a residence for Ada Comstock Scholars was named in honor of Ker Conway.

One of Ker Conway&#x27;s more notable accomplishments is a program she initiated to help Ada Comstock Scholars on welfare. At the time, many students who were also welfare mothers were not pursuing higher education, as accepting a scholarship would cause them to lose their welfare benefits. The mothers were forced to choose between supporting their children or furthering their education. By not giving them scholarships but paying their rent instead, Ker Conway circumvented the state&#x27;s system. She also gave the students access to an account at local stores, access to physicians and so on. ABC&#x27;s Good Morning America profiled graduates of the program, giving it national exposure. Eventually the state of Massachusetts, convinced about the importance of the program, changed its welfare system so that scholarship students wouldn&#x27;t lose their benefits.

She also led the creation of the Smith Management Program (now called Smith Executive Education) and the Project on Women and Social Change. She worked to expand the curriculum leading to the development of programs in women&#x27;s studies, comparative literature, and engineering. Conway took a keen interest in fundraising and under her presidency the endowment nearly tripled from $82 million to $222 million. These efforts enabled several large-scale projects including the construction of the Ainsworth Gymnasium, and expansion of the Neilson Library. The Career Development Office was also expanded under her tenure to better educate alumnae about career opportunities and graduate training.

In 1975, Jill Ker Conway was named by &quot;Time&quot; as a Woman of the Year.

==&quot;The Road from Coorain&quot;==
Ker Conway started writing her first memoir after leaving Smith College, during her period at MIT. &quot;The Road from Coorain&quot; was published in 1989 () and details her early life, from Coorain in Australia to Harvard in the United States.

The book begins with her early childhood at the remote sheep station Coorain near Mossgiel, New South Wales. Ker Conway writes about her teenage years in Sydney and especially her education at the University of Sydney, where university studies were open to women but the culture was focused heavily on the men. She describes her intellectual development and later her feelings when she realizes that there is a bias against women; based upon her sex, she is denied a traineeship at the Australian foreign service.

In 2001, Chapman Pictures produced a television film, &quot;The Road from Coorain&quot;, featuring Katherine Slattery as the grown-up Jill and Juliet Stevenson as her mother.

<text>The Chartered Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors (CIEHF – formerly The Ergonomics Society) is a United Kingdom-based professional society for ergonomists, human factors specialists, and those involved in user-centred design.

==History==
The Ergonomics Society was officially created on 17 September 1949 at a meeting of a number of academics at the Admiralty in London. Among the founding members were Frederic Bartlett, Donald Broadbent, W. E. Hick, Alan Welford, and J. S. Weiner.

In 1957 it started to publish the periodical journal &quot;Ergonomics&quot;. In partnership with Taylor &amp; Francis and Elsevier, the Institute currently publishes six journals: &quot;Ergonomics&quot;, &quot;Applied Ergonomics&quot;, &quot;Behaviour and Information Technology&quot;, &quot;Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science&quot;, &quot;Injury Control and Safety Promotion&quot; and the &quot;Journal of Sports Sciences&quot;.

In 2014, by a Privy Council Order, Elizabeth II granted a Royal Charter to the Institute, leading to a change of name, to the Chartered Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors.

In October 2019 the Institute announced the appointment of its new CEO, Noorzaman Rashid.

==Activities==
The CIEHF makes a number of awards for accomplishments in ergonomics and human factors including the President&#x27;s Medal and the Sir Frederic Bartlett Award for major contributions to ergonomics.

The Institute has a number Special Interest Groups (SIGs) for: Driving Ergonomics, Human-Computer Interaction, Healthcare Ergonomics, Sports Ergonomics, Nuclear Ergonomics, Occupational Safety and Motorcycle Ergonomics.

The CIEHF has its offices in Loughborough. By the end of 2013 there were 1700 members and at the end of 2014 the Institute had 294 members who were eligible for Chartered status, with many more about to become so. At the 2014 Conference, held at the Grand Harbour Hotel in Southampton, Professor Roger Haslam from Loughborough University was inaugurated as the new president of IEHF, taking over the role from Dr Richard Graveling. Professor Sarah Sharples, from the University of Nottingham and the Human Factors Research Group was also appointed as President Elect.

In 2008, to mark the journal&#x27;s 50th year of publication, a special issue of &quot;Ergonomics&quot; (Volume 51, Number 1) was published, guest edited by Neville A. Stanton and Rob Stammers, covering the history of the society and including a re-print of the Ergonomics Research Society lecture given by Sir Frederick Bartlett in 1962.

The CIEHF has worked in partnership with other organisations and the UK Government to establish the Occupational Health &amp; Safety Consultant Register.

<text>The desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) is a species of locust, a periodically swarming, short-horned grasshopper in the family Acrididae. They are found primarily in the deserts and dry areas of northern and eastern Africa, Arabia, and southwest Asia. During population surge years, they may extend north into parts of Southern Europe, south into Eastern Africa, and east in northern India. The desert locust shows periodic changes in its body form and can change in response to environmental conditions, over several generations, from a solitary, shorter-winged, highly fecund, non-migratory form to a gregarious, long-winged, and migratory phase in which they may travel long distances into new areas. In some years, they may thus form locust plagues, invading new areas, where they may consume all vegetation including crops, and at other times, they may live unnoticed in small numbers.

During plague years, desert locusts can cause widespread damage to crops, as they are highly mobile and feed on large quantities of any kind of green vegetation, including crops, pasture, and fodder. A typical swarm can be made up of and fly in the direction of the prevailing wind, up to in one day. Even a very small, locust swarm can eat the same amount of food in a day as about 35,000 people.

As an international transboundary pest that threatens agricultural production and livelihoods in many countries in Africa, the Near East, and southwest Asia, their populations have been routinely monitored through a collaborative effort between countries and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Desert Locust Information Service (DLIS), which provides global and national assessments, forecasts, and early warning to affected countries and the international community. The desert locust&#x27;s migratory nature and capacity for rapid population growth present major challenges for control, particularly in remote semiarid areas, which characterize much of their range.

Locusts differ from other grasshoppers in their ability to change from a solitary living form into gregarious, highly mobile, adult swarms and hopper bands, as their numbers and densities increase. They exist in different states known as recessions (with low and intermediate numbers), rising to local outbreaks and regional upsurges with increasingly high densities, to plagues consisting of numerous swarms. They have two to five generations per year. The desert locust risk increases with a one-to-two-year continuum of favourable weather (greater frequency of rains) and habitats that support population increases leading to upsurges and plagues.

The desert locust is potentially the most dangerous of the locust pests because of the ability of swarms to fly rapidly across great distances. The major desert locust upsurge in 2004–05 caused significant crop losses in West Africa and diminished food security in the region. The 2019–2021 upsurge caused similar losses in northeast Africa, the Near East, and southwest Asia.

== Taxonomy ==
The desert locust is a species of orthopteran in the family Acrididae, subfamily Cyrtacanthacridinae. There are two subspecies, one called &quot;Schistocerca gregaria gregaria&quot;, the better known and of huge economic importance, located north of the equator, and the other, &quot;Schistocerca gregaria flaviventris&quot;, which has a smaller range in south-west Africa and is of less economic importance, although outbreaks have been observed in the past.

== Description ==

The genus &quot;Schistocerca&quot; consists of more than 30 species, distributed in Africa, Asia, and North and South America, and many species are difficult to identify due to the presence of variable morphs. It is the only genus within the Cyrtacanthacridinae that occurs in both the New and Old World. Most species have the fastigium deflexed and lack lateral carinae on the pronotum. The hind tibiae have smooth margins with numerous spines, but have no apical spine on the outer margin. The second tarsal segment is half as long as the first. Males in the genus have broad anal cerci and a split subgenital plate. The genus is thought to have originated in Africa and then speciated in the New World after a dispersal event that took place 6 to 7 million years ago.

The morphology and colour of &quot;Schistocerca gregaria&quot; differ depending on whether individuals are solitary (or &quot;solitaria&quot; morph) or gregarious(or &quot;gregaria&quot; morph).

Morphology - Adults: solitary female 6-9 cm long; male 4.5-6 cm; gregarious female 5-6 cm long; male 4.5-5 cm. Prosternal tubercle straight, blunt and slightly sloping backwards. Male subgenital plate bilobed, cerci flat and blunt. Elytra marked with large irregular spots. Pronotum not crested, narrower and saddle-shaped in the gregarious phase. The eyes are striated. The number of striae increases after each moult. Striations are only clearly visible in solitary individuals.

Coloration - Nymph: Solitary nymphs are greenish or pale beige and may go through six instars. Gregarious nymphs are typically yellow, with a black head and pronotum, black lateral stripes on the abdomen and pass through five instars. First instar gregarious nymphs are almost entirely black. Adults: Immature solitary adults are sandy, pale grey or beige in colour; this colouration evolves to pale yellow in mature male adults and to pale beige with brown patterns in mature females. Immature gregarious adults are pink/reddish in colour, changing to bright yellow in mature males; in mature females the yellow is less bright, mainly on the upper parts of the body, with the lower parts being more of a pale beige. The hindwings are transparent or light yellow.

==Lifecycle==
The lifecycle of the desert locust consists of three stages, the egg, the nymph known as a hopper, and the winged adult. Copulation takes place when a mature male hops onto the back of a mature female and grips her body with his legs. Sperm is transferred from the tip of his abdomen to the tip of hers, where it is stored. The process takes several hours and one insemination is sufficient for a number of batches of eggs.

The female locust then seeks suitable soft soil in which to lay her eggs. It needs to be the right temperature and degree of dampness and be in close proximity to other egg-laying females. She probes the soil with her abdomen and digs a hole into which an egg pod containing up to 100 eggs is deposited. The egg pod is long and the lower end is about below the surface of the ground. The eggs are surrounded by foam and this hardens into a membrane and plugs the hole above the egg pod. The eggs absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. The incubation period before the eggs hatch may be two weeks, or much longer, depending on the temperature.
The newly hatched nymph soon begins to feed, and if it is a gregarious individual, is attracted to other hoppers and they group together. As it grows, it needs to moult (shed its exoskeleton). Its hard cuticle splits and its body expands, while the new exoskeleton is still soft. The stages between moulting are called instars and the desert locust nymph undergoes five moults before becoming a winged adult. Immature and mature individuals in the gregarious phase form bands that feed, bask, and move as cohesive units, while solitary-phase individuals do not seek conspecifics.

After the imaginal moult, the young adult is initially soft with drooping wings, but within a few days, the cuticle hardens and haemolymph is pumped into the wings, stiffening them. 

Maturation can occur in 2–4 weeks when the food supply and weather conditions are suitable but may take as long as 6 months when they are less ideal. Males start maturing first and give off an odour that stimulates maturation in the females. On maturing, the insects turn yellow and the abdomens of the females start swelling with developing eggs.

==Ecology and swarming==

Desert locusts have a solitary phase and a gregarious phase, a type of polyphenism. Solitary locusts nymphs and adults can behave gregariously within a few hours of being placed in a crowded situation, while gregarious locusts need one or more generations to become solitary when reared in isolation. Differences in morphology and behaviour are seen between the two phases. In the solitary phase, the hoppers do not group together into bands but move about independently. Their colouring in the later instars tends to be greenish or brownish to match the colour of their surrounding vegetation. The adults fly at night and are also coloured so as to blend into their surroundings, the immature adults being grey or beige and the mature adults being a pale yellowish colour. In the gregarious phase, the hoppers bunch together and in the later instars develop a bold colouring with black markings on a yellow background. The immatures are pink and the mature adults are bright yellow and fly during the day in dense swarms.

The change from an innocuous solitary insect to a voracious gregarious one normally follows a period of drought, when rain falls and vegetation flushes occur in major desert locust breeding locations. The population builds up rapidly and the competition for food increases. As hoppers get more crowded, the close physical contact causes the insects&#x27; hind legs to bump against one another. This stimulus triggers a cascade of metabolic and behavioral changes that causes the insects to transform from the solitary to the gregarious phase. When the hoppers become gregarious, their colouration changes from largely green to yellow and black, and the adults change from brown to pink (immature) or yellow (mature). Their bodies become shorter, and they give off a pheromone that causes them to be attracted to each other, enhancing hopper band and subsequently swarm formation. The nymphal pheromone is different from the adult one. When exposed to the adult pheromone, hoppers become confused and disoriented, because they can apparently no longer &quot;smell&quot; each other, though the visual and tactile stimuli remain. After a few days, the hopper bands disintegrate and those that escape predation become solitary again. 

During quiet periods, called recessions, desert locusts are confined to a belt that extends from Mauritania through the Sahara Desert in northern Africa, across the Arabian Peninsula, and into northwest India. Under optimal ecological and climatic conditions, several successive generations can occur, causing swarms to form and invade countries on all sides of the recession area, as far north as Spain and Russia, as far south as Nigeria and Kenya, and as far east as India and southwest Asia. As many as 60 countries can be affected within an area of , or about 20% of the Earth&#x27;s land surface.

Locust swarms fly with the wind at roughly the speed of the wind. They can cover from in a day, and fly up to about above sea level (the temperature becomes too cold at higher altitudes). Therefore, swarms cannot cross tall mountain ranges such as the Atlas, the Hindu Kush, or the Himalayas. They do not venture into the rain forests of Africa nor into central Europe. However, locust adults and swarms regularly cross the Red Sea between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and are even reported to have crossed the Atlantic Ocean from Africa to the Caribbean in 10 days during the 1987–89 plague. A single swarm can cover up to and can contain between (a total of around 50 to 100 billion locusts per swarm, representing , considering an average mass of 2 g per locust). The locust can live between 3 and 6 months, and a 10- to 16-fold increase in locust numbers occurs from one generation to the next.

== Impacts of the desert locust ==

=== Economic impact ===
The desert locust is probably the oldest and most dangerous migratory pest in the world. The scale of the invasions and destruction they cause is due to their exceptional gregarious nature, their mobility, the voracity and size of their hopper bands and swarms. Desert locust invasions can be absolutely devastating and have serious repercussions on national and regional food security and on the livelihoods of affected rural communities, particularly the poorest. Added to this damage is the cost of control operations implemented to protect crops, which also help to stop the spread of the invasion, which could otherwise continue for many years and over larger areas. Furthermore, the damage is not limited to crops, but must also include the multiple social and environmental consequences of invasions, which are now better understood and taken into account, even if they are difficult to estimate.

Desert locusts consume an estimated equivalent of their body weight () each day in green vegetation. They are polyphagous and feed on leaves, shoots, flowers, fruit, seeds, stems, and bark. Nearly all crops and noncrop plants are eaten, including pearl millet, maize, sorghum, barley, rice, pasture grasses, sugarcane, cotton, fruit trees, date palms, banana plants, vegetables, and weeds.
Crop loss from locusts was noted in the Bible and Qur&#x27;an; these insects have been documented as contributing to the severity of a number of Ethiopian famines. Since the early 20th century, desert locust plagues occurred in 1926–1934, 1940–1948, 1949–1963, 1967–1969, 1987–1989, 2003–2005, and 2019–2020. In March–October 1915, a plague of locusts stripped Ottoman Palestine of almost all vegetation. The significant crop loss caused by swarming desert locusts exacerbates problems of food shortage, and is a threat to food security.

=== Environmental impact ===
Desert locust control still relies mainly on chemical pesticides. In the event of an invasion, control operations are of such magnitude that the products used can have serious side effects on human health, the environment, non-target organisms and biodiversity. These side effects are increasingly well known. Correct application of the preventive strategy recommended by the FAO and the use of good treatment practices that are more respectful of people and the environment can limit the negative impacts of these large-scale sprayings.

=== Social impact ===
The external social costs to the local human population during desert locust outbreaks can be enormous, but difficult to estimate. Crop and pasture losses can lead to severe food shortages and a large imbalance in food rations, large price fluctuations in markets, insufficient availability of grazing areas, the sale of animals at very low prices to meet household subsistence needs and to buy feed for remaining animals, early transhumance of herds and high tensions between transhumant herders and local farmers, and significant human migration to urban areas (sometimes fatal for the elderly, the weak and young children). Other economic consequences can occur during harvest, as cereals can be contaminated with insect parts and downgraded to feed grains that are sold at a lower price. In addition, the negative income shock can have a long-term impact on the educational outcomes of children living in rural areas.

=== Beneficial impact ===
The potential benefits of locust swarms are seldom acknowledged. However, locusts are not all bad, as the biomass of locust individuals contributes greatly to ecosystem processes in case of an invasion. Locust frass and cadavers are rich in nutrients which are transferred to the soil via decomposition by micro-organisms and fungi, absorbed by plants, increasing net ecosystem productivity and ecosystem nutrient cycling through rapid mineralization rates of nitrogen and carbon.

==Early warning and preventive control==
Early warning and preventive control is the strategy adopted by locust-affected countries in Africa and Asia to try to stop locust plagues from developing and spreading. In the 1920s-1930s, locust control became a major field for international cooperation. The International Agricultural Institute developed several programmes aimed at exchanging data about the desert locust and international conferences were held in the 1930s: Rome in 1931, Paris in 1932, London in 1934, Cairo in 1936, and Brussels in 1938. Colonial empires were heavily involved in these attempts to control locust pests, which affected heavily the Middle East and parts of Africa. The USSR also used locust control as a way to expand its influence in the Middle East and Central Asia.

FAO&#x27;s Desert Locust Information Service (DLIS) in Rome monitors the weather, ecological conditions, and the locust situation on a daily basis. DLIS receives results of survey and control operations carried out by national teams in affected countries. The teams use a variety of innovative digital devices, such as eLocust3, to collect, record and transmit standardized data in real-time to their national locust centres for decision-making. This data is automatically integrated into SWARMS, the global monitoring and early warning system operated by DLIS. Within this system, the field data are combined with the latest satellite imagery to actively monitor rainfall, vegetation and soil moisture conditions in the locust breeding area from West Africa to India. This is supplemented by sub-seasonal and seasonal temperature and rainfall predictions up to six months in advance as well as other weather forecasts and data from NOAA and ECMWF. Models are used to estimate egg and hopper development rates and swarm trajectories (NOAA HYSPLIT) and dispersion (UK Met Office NAME). DLIS uses a custom GIS to analyze the field data, satellite imagery, weather predictions and model results to assess the current situation and forecast the timing, scale, and location of breeding and migration up to six weeks in advance. The situation assessments and forecasts are published in monthly locust bulletins that date back to the 1970s. These are supplemented by warnings and alerts to affected countries and the international community. This information is available on the FAO Locust Watch website. DLIS continuously adopts the latest technologies as innovative tools, including drones, to improve monitoring and early warning. FAO also provides information and training to affected countries and coordinates funding from donor agencies in case of major upsurges and plagues.

The desert locust is a difficult pest to control, and control measures are further compounded by the large and often remote areas () where locusts can be found. Undeveloped basic infrastructure in some affected countries, limited resources for locust monitoring and control, and political turmoil within and between affected countries further reduce the capacity of a country to undertake the necessary monitoring and control activities.

At present, the primary method of controlling desert locust infestations is with insecticides applied in small, concentrated doses by vehicle-mounted and aerial sprayers at ultra-low volume rates of application. The insecticide is acquired by the insect directly, meaning that control must be precise. Control is undertaken by government agencies in locust-affected countries or by specialized regional aerial organizations such as the Desert Locust Control Organization for East Africa (DLCO-EA).

The desert locust has natural enemies such as predatory wasps and flies, parasitoid wasps, predatory beetle larvae, birds, and reptiles. These may be effective at keeping solitary populations in check but are of limited effects against gregarious desert locusts because of the enormous numbers of insects in the swarms and hopper bands.

Farmers often try mechanical means of killing locusts, such as digging trenches and burying hopper bands, but this is very labour-intensive and is difficult to undertake when large infestations are scattered over a wide area. Farmers also try to scare locust swarms away from their fields by making noise, burning tires, or other methods. This tends to shift the problem to neighbouring farms, and locust swarms can easily return to reinfest previously visited fields.

==Biopesticides==
Biopesticides include fungi, bacteria, neem extract, and pheromones. The effectiveness of many biopesticides equals that of conventional chemical pesticides, but two distinct differences exist. Biopesticides in general take longer to kill insects, plant diseases, or weeds, usually between 2 and 10 days.

The two types of biopesticides are biochemical and microbial. Biochemical pesticides are similar to naturally occurring chemicals and are nontoxic, such as insect pheromones used to locate mates, while microbial biopesticides, come from bacteria, fungi, algae, or viruses that either occur naturally or are genetically altered. Entomopathogenic fungi generally suppress pests by mycosis - causing a disease that is specific to the insect.

Biological control products have been under development since the late 1990s; Green Muscle and NOVACRID are based on a naturally occurring entomopathogenic fungus, &quot;Metarhizium acridum&quot;. Species of &quot;Metarhizium&quot; are widespread throughout the world, infecting many groups of insects, but pose low risk to humans, other mammals, and birds. The species &quot;M. acridum&quot; has specialised in short-horned grasshoppers, to which these locusts belong, so has been chosen as the active ingredient of the product.

The product is available in Australia under the name Green Guard and in Africa, it used to be available as Green Muscle. However, since Green Muscle seems to have disappeared from the market, another product, NOVACRID, was developed for Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East. These products are applied in the same way as chemical insecticides, but do not kill as quickly. At recommended doses, the fungus can take up to two weeks to kill up to 90% of the locusts. For that reason, it is recommended for use mainly against hoppers, the wingless early stages of locusts. These are mostly found in the desert, far from cropping areas, where the delay in death does not result in damage. The advantage of the product is that it affects only grasshoppers and locusts, which makes it much safer than chemical insecticides. Specifically, it allows the natural enemies of locusts and grasshoppers to continue preying upon them. These include birds, parasitoid and predatory wasps, parasitoid flies, and certain species of beetles. Though natural enemies cannot prevent plagues, they can limit the frequency of outbreaks and contribute to their control. Biopesticides are also safer to use in environmentally sensitive areas such as national parks or near rivers and other water bodies.

Green Muscle was developed under the LUBILOSA programme, which was initiated in 1989 in response to environmental concerns over the heavy use of chemical insecticides to control locusts and grasshoppers during the 1987-89 plague. The project focused on the use of beneficial disease-causing microorganisms (pathogens) as biological control agents for grasshoppers and locusts. These insects were considered too mobile and too fecund for their numbers to be curbed by classical biological control. Pathogens bear a distinct advantage in that many can be produced in artificial culture in large quantities and be used with ubiquitous spraying equipment. Entomopathogenic fungi were traditionally regarded as needing humid conditions to be effective. However, the LUBILOSA programme devised a method to overcome this by spraying fungal spores in an oil formulation. Even under desert conditions, Green Muscle can be used to kill locusts and other acridid pests, such as the Senegalese grasshopper. During trials in Algeria and Mauritania in 2005 and 2006, various natural enemies, but especially birds, were abundant enough to eliminate treated hopper bands in about a week, because the diseased hoppers became sluggish and easy to catch.

==Desert locust plagues and upsurges==
In the 1900s, there were six major desert locust plagues, one of which lasted almost 13years.
===1915 Ottoman Syria locust infestation===

From March to October 1915, swarms of locusts stripped areas in and around Palestine, Mount Lebanon and Syria of almost all vegetation. This infestation seriously compromised the already-depleted food supply of the region and sharpened the misery of all Jerusalemites.

===1960s to present===
Since the early 1960s, there have been two desert locust plagues (1967-1968 and 1986-1989) and six desert locust upsurges (1972-1974, 1992-1994, 1994-1996, 2004-2005, 1996-1998, and 2019-2021).

===2004–2005 upsurge (West Africa)===

From October 2003 to May 2005, West Africa faced the largest and most numerous desert locust infestations in 15 years. The upsurge started as small, independent outbreaks that developed in Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and Sudan in the autumn of 2003. Two days of unusually heavy rains that stretched from Dakar, Senegal, to Morocco in October allowed breeding conditions to remain favourable for the next 6 months and the desert locusts rapidly increased. Lack of rain and cold temperatures in the winter breeding area of northwest Africa in early 2005 slowed the development of the locusts and allowed the locust control agencies to stop the cycle. During the upsurge, nearly were treated by ground and aerial operations in 23 countries. The costs of fighting this upsurge have been estimated by the FAO to have exceeded US$400 million, and harvest losses were valued at up to US$2.5 billion, which had disastrous effects on food security in West Africa. The countries affected by the 2004-2005 upsurge were Algeria, Burkina Faso, the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Chad, Egypt, Ethiopia, the Gambia, Greece, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sudan, Syria, and Tunisia.

===2019–2021 desert locust upsurge===

In May 2018, Cyclone Mekunu brought unprecedented rainfall to the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Peninsula that was followed by Cyclone Luban that brought heavy rains again to the same area in October. This allowed conditions to be favourable for three generations of breeding, which caused an estimated 8,000-fold increase in Desert Locust numbers that went unchecked because the area was so remote it could not be accessed by national locust teams.

In early 2019, waves of swarms migrated from this remote and inaccessible area north to the interior of Saudi Arabia and southern Iran, and southwest to the interior of Yemen. Both areas received good rains, including heavy flooding in southwest Iran (the worst in 50 years), that allowed another two generations of breeding to take place. While control operations were mounted against the northern movement and subsequent breeding, very little could be done in Yemen due to the ongoing conflict. As a result, new swarms formed that crossed the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden and invaded the Horn of Africa, specifically northeast Ethiopia and northern Somalia in June 2019. Again, good rains allowed further breeding during the summer, followed by another generation of widespread breeding during the autumn in eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia, which was exacerbated by the unusually late occurring Cyclone Pawan in northeast Somalia in early December. The swarms that subsequently formed invaded Kenya in late December 2019 and spread throughout the country where they bred in between the rainy seasons because of unusual rainfall. Kenya had only witnessed swarm invasions twice in the past 75 years (1955 and 2007). Some swarms also invaded Uganda, South Sudan, Tanzania and one small swarm reached northeast D.R. Congo, the first time since 1945.

The situation improved in Kenya and elsewhere by the summer of 2020 due to large-scale aerial control operations, made available by generous assistance from international partners. Nevertheless, food security and livelihoods were impacted throughout the region. Despite the control efforts, good rains continued to fall and breeding occurred again during the summer and autumn in Ethiopia and Somalia that led to another invasion of Kenya in December 2020, which was eventually brought under control by spring 2021. Again, unexpected rains fell in late April and early May, this time further north that allowed substantial breeding to occur in eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia in May and June 2021. New swarms formed in June and July that moved to northeast Ethiopia for a generation of breeding that could not be addressed due to conflict and insecurity, which prolonged the upsurge in the Horn of Africa. The upsurge was finally brought under control by early 2022 as a result of successful and intensive control operations in northern Somalia and poor rainfall. there are no locust crises anywhere in the world but swarms are expected in October in the Sahel, Yemen and on the India–Pakistan border.

In southwest Asia, the upsurge was brought under control much earlier because of a massive effort undertaken by India and Pakistan along both sides of their common border during the summer of 2020 that followed from earlier control operations during the spring of 2019 and 2020 by Iran and during the summer of 2019 by Pakistan and India. In June 2020, Cyclone Nisarga helped spread swarms across the northern states of India where a few reached the Himalayan foothills in Nepal.

In response to the upsurge, the Director-General of FAO declared a Level 3 corporate-wide emergency, the highest level in the UN system, on 17 January 2020 and appealed for immediate international assistance to rapidly upscale monitoring and control activities in the Horn of Africa. One month later, Somalia declared a state of emergency. Similarly, Pakistan also declared a state of emergency. The UN continued to warn that the Horn of Africa was facing a dangerous situation.

Fortunately, the international community responded quickly and generously despite other urgent situations such as COVID-19, and the $230 million appeal by FAO was fully funded. This allowed ground and aerial operations to treat of desert locust in the Horn of Africa and Yemen in 2020 and 2021. Up to 20 aircraft were deployed simultaneously, supported by hundreds of ground teams, and more than 1.4 million locations were surveyed. These collective efforts averted of crop losses, saved of milk production, and secured food for nearly 47 million people. The commercial value of the cereal and milk loss averted is estimated at $1.77 billion.

FAO&#x27;s Locust Watch contains the latest situation and forecasts as well as a full, detailed description of the recent upsurge.

== Pheromones ==
The swarming pheromone guaiacol is produced in the gut of desert locusts by the breakdown of plant material. This process is undertaken by the gut bacterium &quot;Pantoea&quot; (&quot;Enterobacter&quot;) &quot;agglomerans&quot;. Guaiacol is one of the main components of the pheromones that cause locust swarming. Pheromones also accelerate &quot;S. gregaria&quot; development. Mahamat &quot;et al.&quot;, 1993 find that an undifferentiated mix of several volatiles derived from the males of the species (including guaiacol) speed up the maturation process of both immature males and females.

== In research ==
&quot;S. gregaria&quot; was one of the organisms examined by McNeill and Hoyle 1967 and found to have thinner muscle filaments than those before found. This contributed greatly to the development of the sliding filament theory.

Westerman showed that exposure of &quot;S. gregaria&quot; males to a dose of X-rays during the S-phase (DNA synthesis phase) of spermatogonial mitoses and during the early stages of meiosis (leptotene-early zygotene stages) caused a significant increase in chiasmata frequency when scored at the later stages (diplotene-diakinesis stages) of meiosis. These results indicated that the formation of chiasmata is not an isolated event but the end product of an interrelated series of processes initiated at some earlier stage of meiosis.

== In culture ==
Given the long history of desert locust, it is to be expected that references of the world&#x27;s most dangerous migratory pest have crept into popular film and literature as well as many of the world&#x27;s religions.

===Film===
Owing to the destructive habits of locusts, they have been a representation of famine in many Middle Eastern cultures, and are seen in the movies &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Bible&quot; (1966).

===Religious books===
This species has been identified as one of the kosher species of locusts mentioned in Leviticus 11:22 by several rabbinical authorities among Middle Eastern Jewish communities.

<text>Graeme Ernest Lee (born 1 September 1935) is a former New Zealand politician. Originally a National Party MP, he broke away to found the Christian Democrat Party.

==Early life and family==
Lee was born in Paeroa on 1 September 1935, the son of Ernest Walter Lee and Muriel Myrtle Lee (née Weight). His father was a builder, and later served as mayor of Paeroa from 1959.

==Member of Parliament==


Lee was first elected to Parliament in the 1981 election, winning the seat of Hauraki as the National candidate. Lee replaced Leo Schultz, a prominent National MP. He retained his seat from then until the 1996 election, although a change of electoral boundaries resulted in the seat which covered the Thames-Coromandel district being renamed Coromandel in 1996.

Lee, a principally conservative member of the National Party caucus would later come to believe that the National Party was drifting away from conservatism, but initially resolved to fight the shift from within the party. After a three year period as a Cabinet Minister in the Bolger government, Lee resigned from the National Party in 1993.

Lee had a reputation as one of the more conservative MPs in Parliament, and was particularly active in opposing Fran Wilde&#x27;s homosexual law reform bill.

==Christian Democrats==
At first, it was thought likely that Lee would join the Christian Heritage Party, but talks between Lee and Christian Heritage broke down. An important issue was that of &quot;confessionalism&quot;: Lee, while strongly believing in Christian teachings as a basis for morality, believed that anyone who shared the proper principles should be allowed to contribute, even if they were not actually Christian. The Christian Heritage Party, being strongly confessionalist, rejected this, saying that it was only logical that a Christian party should bar non-Christians from membership. This issue, as well as a number of smaller points, caused Lee to turn away from Christian Heritage and establish his own party in 1994. Lee initially called his group the United Progressive Party, but in 1995, it was relaunched as the Christian Democrats.

Sporadic talks with Christian Heritage continued, with many Christian activists putting pressure on both sides to unify. Eventually, in late 1995, the Christian Coalition was established. In the 1996 election, however, the Coalition narrowly missed out on entering Parliament. It later collapsed amid many accusations and recriminations.

In the 1997 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Lee was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for public services.

Lee had told his family that if he failed to remain in Parliament, he would retire from politics. After his departure from politics, he became involved as CEO for the Christian housing provider Habitat for Humanity and wrote an autobiography about his religious views and political life within the National and Christian Democrat parties, as well as his ongoing political stance. For his current organisational affiliation, see concluding paragraph and links section.

The party then renamed itself Future New Zealand and contested the 1999 elections. It later merged with Peter Dunne&#x27;s United Party to form United Future New Zealand in 2000. The party received 8 seats at the 2002 election. However, most New Zealanders realised that this was merely a cosmetic change during the 47th New Zealand Parliament, with most of the caucus professing either fundamentalist Protestant or conservative Catholic religious beliefs.

==Later years==
Graeme Lee was a minister at Auckland&#x27;s Greenlane Christian Centre for a brief period of time, and was also one of the co-ordinators of Vision New Zealand, a national evangelical/ecumentalist umbrella group. Subsequently, Lee was involved in organising the New Zealand itinerary of an American televangelist, Greg Laurie, in 2011.

He has been leading the New Zealand branch of Christians for Israel, a Christian Zionist group.

His daughter, Denise Krum, stood for United Future in the 2008 general election. However, UFNZ Leader Peter Dunne was the only UFNZ MP returned to Parliament, due to his anchoring constituency seat. Krum joined the National Party in 2009, becoming a deputy chair of the Northern Region. She unsuccessfully applied to become National Party candidate for the Epsom electorate, but became a National Party List MP candidate at the 2011 New Zealand general election. However, she was ranked at 69 on the National Party list and consequently did not enter Parliament. Krum later ran successfully for the Auckland Council and was elected Councillor in 2013 for the Maungakiekie-Tamaki Ward.

<text>Greg Sage (born October 21, 1951) is an American songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist, regarded as an important influence on many punk rock and post-punk artists. Sage is best known as the principal songwriter and vocalist/guitarist of the influential Portland, Oregon-based band Wipers.

==Early years==
Greg Sage was born in Portland, Oregon, on October 21, 1951. His involvement with music began with cutting records at home as an adolescent, due to his father being involved in the broadcast industry. Sage’s first instrument was bass guitar, because of the low tones that made larger grooves in the vinyl records due to slower modulations. Basses were harder to find and much more expensive when Sage was in grade school, so he used guitar instead.

Sage has been involved in music professionally since the age of 17, when he worked on a full-length album by the professional wrestler Beauregarde (&quot;Beauregard&quot;, 1971; re-released 2004). After several years of playing and recording guitar, Sage founded Wipers in Portland in 1977.

The mood of Sage&#x27;s lyrics is frequently dark, and rife with references to confusion and severe alienation. His song structures often take unexpected turns and are typified by fractured melodic passages punctuated by massive, intricate guitar parts, and use of heavy distortion. He usually plays on a 1969 left-handed Gibson SG with attached Bigsby tremolo.

==Wipers==

In 1977, Sage founded the Wipers. The name was inspired by a job he had picked up cleaning windows at a movie theatre; the crystal clear transparency of the glass was what he realized he wanted to emulate with his music. 
Its inception was at first an exclusive recording project. Then Sage planned to record 15 LPs in 10 years without touring or promoting. He believed it would be possible to avoid live shows, press, pictures and interviews, and this – coupled with the mystique of his unorthodox music – would encourage a deeper, more imaginative engagement with the recordings.

In 1979, Sage established his own record label, Trap, and asked several Portland punk bands to record singles. Some of those early bands were The Stiphnoyds, The Neo Boys and Sado Nation. Sage later re-released some of the material on a compilation record entitled &quot;The History Of Portland Punk&quot;.

==Solo career==
Since the demise of Wipers, Sage has also recorded several albums as a solo musician and operates his own label, Zeno Records, based in Phoenix, Arizona, where he currently resides.

<doc id="1063696" wikidata="Q2408452" url="?curid=1063696" title="Red River Valley">
<text>The Red River Valley is a region in central North America that is drained by the Red River of the North; it is part of both Canada and the United States. Forming the border between Minnesota and North Dakota when these territories were admitted as states in the United States, this fertile valley has been important to the economies of these states and to Manitoba, Canada.

The population centers of Moorhead, Minnesota; Fargo and Grand Forks, North Dakota; and Winnipeg, Manitoba, developed in the valley as settlement by ethnic Europeans increased in the late nineteenth century. Completion of major railroads, availability of cheap lands, and forceful removal of Indigenous people as well as a subsequent refusal to recognize Indigenous land claims attracted many new settlers. Some developed large-scale agricultural operations known as bonanza farms, which concentrated on wheat commodity crops.

Paleogeographic Lake Agassiz laid down the Red River Valley Silts. The river flows north through a wide ancient lake plain to Lake Winnipeg. The geography and seasonal conditions can produce devastating floods, with several recorded since the mid-20th century.

== Indigenous population ==
The valley was long an area of habitation by various indigenous cultures, including the historic Ojibwe and Métis peoples. The Métis Nation, which originated largely in the Red River Valley and organized politically in the 19th century, radiating outwards from the Red River Settlement (now Winnipeg). Descendants of this community are known as the Red River Métis.

==Early European settlement==

French fur traders had relations with First Nations and Native Americans throughout the Great Lakes region. They often lived with the tribes and married or had relations with native women. By the mid-17th century, the Métis, descendants of these Frenchmen and Cree tribes people (in addition to other First Nations peoples), settled in the Red River valley. The Métis established an ethnicity and culture, as many continued a tradition as hunters and traders involved in the fur trade. They were also farmers in this area.

The British took over French territory east of the Mississippi River following its victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War. In the early 19th century, the lucrative fur trade attracted continuing interest, and Lord Selkirk established the Red River Colony. In 1803 the United States acquired former French territory west of the Mississippi River in the Louisiana Purchase from France. This included some of the Red River Valley.

==U.S. geographical importance==
The U.S. government uses the term &quot;Red River Valley&quot; generally to describe the sections of northwestern Minnesota and eastern North Dakota to which it secured title following the Anglo-American Convention of 1818 that settled the northern boundary of the US and Canada.
This land became part as the second article of the 1818 treaty declared the 49th parallel to be the official border between the U.S. and Canada up to the Rocky Mountains. (This borderline was extended to the Pacific Ocean in 1846 under the Oregon Treaty.) The land acquired under the treaty had an area of , comprising 1.3 percent of total U.S. land area. Centered on the Red River of the North, these lands had previously been under the control of Great Britain.

West of the Red River Valley, the territory of the Louisiana Purchase, which the US acquired from France, extends north of the 49th parallel. The US ceded this to Britain in exchange for gaining the Red River Valley. These northernmost parts of the Louisiana Purchase are one of the few North American territories ever ceded by the United States to a foreign power.
==Prone to flooding==

Four factors make the Red River Valley prone to flooding (the factors are related to physical geography):
&quot;Synchrony of Discharge with Spring Thaw:&quot; The Red River flows northward. The spring thaw also proceeds gradually northward. As a result, runoff from the southern portion of the valley gradually joins the fresh melt-off waters from northerly areas along the Red River. In the northern part of the Valley, this can result in devastating floods if the effects occur at the same time. 
&quot;Ice Jams:&quot; These are also produced because of the northward-flowing river system. Ice is moving from the southern Valley and freshly-broken ice is moving from the central and northern Valley. These two meet steadily; as a result, ice concentration in this system builds and causes delay of water flow.
&quot;Glacial Lake Plain:&quot; The floor of Glacial Lake Agassiz is one of the flattest expanses of land in the world. Here, the Red River has cut a shallow, winding valley. As a result of this, when the river floods on this plain, a devastating event can occur. The areal coverage of the waters can become dramatic. Being approximately 9,300 years old, the Red River has not yet carved a large valley-floodplain systems on the surrounding geography. Thus, the large lake plain becomes the floodplain to the Red River. The Lake Agassiz glacial lake plain extends around 100 miles from east to west, end to end, between northeastern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota.
&quot;Decrease in Gradient Downstream:&quot; The gradient, or slope, of the Red River averages 5 inches per mile of length. In the region of Drayton-Pembina, the gradient is only 1.5 inches per mile. The water tends to pool in this area during flood season. The region can become a massive, shallow lake.

<text>Jonas Quinn is a fictional character in the Canadian-American television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, a science fiction show about a military team exploring the galaxy via a network of alien transportation devices. Played by Corin Nemec, Jonas is introduced in the season 5 episode &quot;Meridian.&quot; Jonas fills Daniel Jackson&#x27;s empty spot on the SG-1 team in season 6 and the beginning of season 7, and last appears in the mid-season 7 episode &quot;Fallout&quot;.

Nemec&#x27;s character replaced Daniel Jackson (portrayed by Michael Shanks) during season 6 after Shanks had left the show amid controversy after season 5. The producers based Jonas&#x27; motivation to join Stargate Command on his momentary reluctance to actively prevent Daniel&#x27;s death, and his feelings of responsibility afterwards. Jonas was slowly integrated into the story in a prolonged transition stage over the first half of season 6. Nemec was open to continue playing Jonas Quinn after season 6, but a new contract was reached with Michael Shanks for Daniel to return in season 7. The role of Jonas was reduced to recurring status in season 7.

==Role in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;==
=== Character arc ===
Jonas Quinn is introduced in the season 5 episode &quot;Meridian&quot; as a scientist of the human nation of Kelowna on Langara, a planet with an industrial level comparable to Earth of the 1940s, and that is also locked in a cold war with two rival states. He is an exceptionally quick learner, which becomes useful in memorizing SG mission reports and earth culture. The Kelownans are experimenting with naqahdriah (an unstable but extremely powerful native element related to naqahdah) to build a bomb against their two rival nations, Terrania and the Andari Federation. Jonas is present when SG-1 team member Daniel Jackson gets radiation-poisoned with naqahdriah in an attempt to prevent a catastrophe in Kelowna, but when the Kelownan leaders respond with indifference to Daniel&#x27;s imminent death and glee with regards to the destructive power of the naqahdriah, Jonas steals a small amount of naqahdriah and offers it to Earth for more peaceful uses. Still wracked by guilt in the season 6 premiere &quot;Redemption&quot; over his hesitation to step in, Jonas helps Major Samantha Carter find a solution to save Earth from an attack by the Goa&#x27;uld Anubis. Although Colonel Jack O&#x27;Neill is reluctant to add a new fourth member to SG-1, he allows Jonas to join the team, partly to prevent a Russian from being assigned.

After several missions with SG-1, Jonas is confronted with his past in &quot;Shadow Play&quot; and learns more of the effects of naqahdriah on people. In &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, the Goa&#x27;uld Nirrti learns via an Ancient DNA Resequencer that Jonas is different from other humans, but she is killed before this is further investigated. In &quot;Prophecy&quot;, Nirrti&#x27;s experiments cause clairvoyant visions in Jonas, and the doctors remove a potentially lethal tumor from his brain. After SG-1 finds the de-ascended Daniel on another planet in the season 7 premiere &quot;Fallen&quot;/&quot;Homecoming&quot;, Jonas and Daniel join forces and succeed in driving Anubis away from Kelowna. The three Langaran nations agree to meet for peace talks for the greater good of the planet, and Jonas decides to become a peace negotiator for his people. While Jonas returns to his planet, Daniel rejoins SG-1. Jonas last appears in season 7&#x27;s &quot;Fallout&quot; to ask Earth for help saving his homeworld from the destructive powers of naqahdriah in the planet&#x27;s core. Season 10&#x27;s &quot;Counterstrike&quot; mentions that the Ori conquered Langara, Jonas&#x27;s homeworld. Langara&#x27;s story arc is resumed in &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;″s &quot;Seizure&quot;, where Earth eventually agrees to protect Langara from the Lucian Alliance, while the Langarans remove the Stargate from their facility.

===Characterization and relationships===
After Daniel&#x27;s death and Jonas&#x27; subsequent move to Earth, Major Carter is the SG-1 team member around whom Jonas Quinn feels most comfortable. Nevertheless, Amanda Tapping (Carter) felt that &quot;there is a hesitancy on [Carter]&#x27;s part to be too familiar with Jonas [or] make this big emotional investment&quot; in him because he is not Daniel. Jonas hopes that Carter and the alien SG-1 member Teal&#x27;c can persuade Colonel O&#x27;Neill to give him a chance to prove himself worthy of a place on the SG-1 team, but according to Richard Dean Anderson (O&#x27;Neill), &quot;O&#x27;Neill feels that Jonas is directly responsible for the demise or at least the damaging of Daniel Jackson [and thus] harbors some resentment towards Jonas&quot;. Although O&#x27;Neill is suspicious of aliens in general (except of Teal&#x27;c), O&#x27;Neill begins to accept Jonas at the end of &quot;Redemption&quot; yet finds it hard to ever significantly warm up to Jonas, something which Nemec felt &quot;makes things much more interesting&quot;. Tapping added that Jonas inadvertently brings the three remaining SG-1 members closer together again. Jonas&#x27;s &quot;easy-going nature&quot; later helps him to also establish relationships with the supporting characters Dr. Janet Fraiser and General George Hammond, whom Nemec regarded &quot;very much [as] a father figure in Jonas&#x27;s eyes&quot;.

==Conceptual history==
When actor Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) announced his decision to leave &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; at the end of season 5 for concerns over being under-utilized, the Sci Fi Channel wanted to fill the void with a new character for season 6. Corin Nemec happened to be at the courtyard of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s Santa Monica offices rehearsing audition dialog for an independent film when some casting agents recognized him from previous projects. They briefly mentioned &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; to him and informed Nemec&#x27;s manager of their strong interest in him the same afternoon. Although Nemec was familiar with the &quot;Stargate&quot; film, he had never watched the television show and was sent videotapes to familiarize himself with the series. Nemec was cast for the penultimate season 5 episode &quot;Meridian&quot; after several more meetings, but both sides agreed to await the character&#x27;s look on film before deciding on a long-term involvement.

Producer Brad Wright announced in September 2001 that an actor had been cast and that the new character would be someone whom fans would recognize. An MGM Sci-Fi newsletter revealed Corin Nemec to play the role of Liander Quinn in &quot;Meridian&quot; in November 2001, fueling fan speculation of the identity of the new character. Soon afterwards, producer Joseph Mallozzi revealed that Nemec&#x27;s character appears in the first five episodes of season 6. Meanwhile, Nemec started to work out six days a week in-between seasons and gained about to look bigger around the tall &quot;SG-1&quot; cast.

Mallozzi stated before the airing of season 6 that &quot;Jonas will bring a unique alien perspective and ability to the team [that] will allow him to contribute in areas of expertise usually owned by [Carter] and Daniel.&quot; Brad Wright hoped that &quot;what Corin, as Jonas, will bring to the show is a renewed sense of amazement&quot; of traveling around the galaxy although older characters have grown accustomed to it. The season 6 opening two-parter &quot;Redemption&quot; intended to establish Jonas as a team player who can contribute ideas, although writer Robert C. Cooper felt the need to acknowledge and not &quot;trivialize what the [Daniel Jackson] character meant to the team and to the show for five seasons&quot;. The writers incorporated the initial viewer resistance to the change by making O&#x27;Neill the most resistant to Jonas&#x27; presence, allowing viewers to grieve Daniel and gradually come to terms with his absence. The producers based Jonas&#x27; motivation to join SG-1 on his former reluctance to shut off the machine that indirectly killed Daniel, and his feelings of responsibility for Daniel&#x27;s death. Jonas was slowly integrated into the story in a prolonged transition stage over the first half of season 6.

Nemec was open to continue playing Jonas Quinn after season 6 or in a feature film or a spin-off series, but a new contract was reached with Michael Shanks for Daniel to return in season 7. The role of Jonas was therefore reduced to recurring status in season 7. Nemec welcomed the producers&#x27; openness for story pitches and offered several story ideas. He wrote the mid-season-7 episode &quot;Fallout&quot; and considered pitching more stories afterwards, but he became busy with other projects. Jonas is seldom mentioned in the series after this point but after Season 10&#x27;s &quot;Counterstrike&quot; stated that the Ori conquered Jonas&#x27; homeworld, &quot;Stargate&quot; producer Joseph Mallozzi said in his blog that &quot;in [his] mind, Jonas went underground and is still alive somewhere, resisting the Ori army.&quot;

==Reception==
The audience reception of Jonas Quinn was sparked with controversy over Michael Shanks&#x27; departure from the show. When rumors began late in 2001 that Showtime would also not be renewing &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; after its fifth season, panicking fans rallied to save the show and Daniel&#x27;s character, starting massive write-in campaigns and setting up websites such as the &quot;Save Daniel Jackson&quot; site. The SciFi Channel eventually ordered a sixth season of the show, but the character of Jonas continued to be distrusted by loyal fans, who were concerned that Daniel&#x27;s death might cause the SG-1 team to lose its moral compass. Robert C. Cooper summarized that &quot;there&#x27;s been quite a bit of ire directed by fans towards Daniel&#x27;s replacement&quot; after the airing of &quot;Meridian&quot;, but he hoped that the character would grow on fans eventually. Producer Joseph Mallozzi claimed at the beginning of season 6 to still get the &quot;odd incoherent rambling death threat passed along to me from the [Save Daniel Jackson] site&quot;.

Amanda Tapping admitted that it had been easier to establish relationships with her co-stars at the beginning of the series, comparing Nemec&#x27;s situation to &quot;being the new kid in school; we&#x27;re still trying to make [Corin] comfortable, but it&#x27;s not the same&quot;. Nevertheless, the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; actors and producers complimented Corin Nemec and the character. Richard Dean Anderson was impressed with Nemec&#x27;s performance in &quot;Meridian&quot;, saying &quot;he really struck me as a bright guy, very respectful of the dynamic of the set, but with an awareness of what he wanted to bring.&quot; Don S. Davis (General Hammond) noted during the filming of season 6 that &quot;Corin is a wonderful [and well-liked] young man with a tremendous personality and he&#x27;s had a great deal of experience in the business&quot;, agreeing with writer Robert C. Cooper that Nemec had done a &quot;fine&quot; and &quot;wonderful&quot; job.

&quot;TV Zone&quot;″s Jan Vincent-Rudzki expected Jonas to be &quot;pushed out of the way&quot; in season 7&#x27;s &quot;Fallen&quot;/&quot;Homecoming&quot;, but considered the character&#x27;s departure as &quot;keeping with previous events&quot; and &quot;quite plausible&quot;. The writers&#x27; decision to team up Jonas with Daniel for a significant part of the two-part episode &quot;gives credence to Jonas&#x27;s exit&quot;, although &quot;it&#x27;s a great shame that this new &#x27;partnership&#x27; couldn&#x27;t have continued&quot; since &quot;the two [characters] worked so well together&quot;. Nemec stated in a 2008 interview that &quot;the initial backlash from a very small core, outspoken group of the fandom had a bit of a volatile reaction to it, which is totally natural... I&#x27;d say 95-plus percent of the fan base grew to like the character and accepted the character overall. Especially by the time season 6 ended, I think people were pretty much, &#x27;Eh, OK — I&#x27;m cool with that.&#x27; For the most part.&quot;

<text>Karlova Koruna () is a château in the town of Chlumec nad Cidlinou in the Czech Republic.

==History==
The château was built for František Ferdinand Kinský in 1721–23.
Construction was completed in time for King Charles VI&#x27;s coronation. František Ferdinand Kinský invited the king to the château and named the castle after the king (Karlova Koruna means &quot;Charles&#x27; crown&quot; in English).
Originally, there was a stronghold as nobleman seat in Chlumec nad Cidlinou town, and the first mention in a source-books is from 1424 when the stronghold was conquered by the warrior Boček of Poděbrady. In the beginning of the 16th century a new renaissance fortification was built. The Kinský family obtained this property in the beginning of the 17th century and kept it till 1948. It was returned to the family after 1990. The High Chancellor of Bohemian Kingdom count František Ferdinand Kinský (1668 – 1741) decided to convert the building into a folly corresponding to the reputation of his noble family. Some of the best architects and master builders of that times – Jan Blažej Santini-Aichel and František Maxmilián Kaňka – were engaged to create this work of art. As a dedication, this new pleasure house was named after emperor Karel VI. who visited Chlumec in September 1723 while returning from his coronation in Prague. In the middle of the 17th century the Kinský family began to use this folly more often. That is why the property was enlarged – detached administrative and accommodation wings were newly built. The hyppodrome, where the Chlumec peasants of well-known uprising were imprisoned in 1775, also grew up in this time.

==Architecture==
The basic architectural design was drafted by Santini-Aichel. The details and participation in the building process can be attributed to Kaňka. The manor&#x27;s design reveals one of the most noteworthy manor dispositions created in the Czech lands. The central high cylindrical body of the building is occupied by a three storied main hall to which 3 wings are connected. Due to this the manor does not need passages and its external appearance changes as the observer walks around it.
The architecture of the chateau reflects the charisma and unique craft of Santini-Aichel and Kaňka. This is best demonstrated on a horizontal projection – three cubes are projecting from surmounting central cylinder. All views of the chateau are similar – opening wings extend from high central mass. The whole building is decorated by a light bossage, a simple string course, a weathering and a cornice. There are also soprafenstras. Three layered gables (one on each side) are above the cornice. Due to this combination of dynamical design and modest decoration is Karlova Koruna chateau considered to be one of the best Santini-Aichl&#x27;s structure.

The stately staircase is situated on the north side. It is half-covered in buttress and leads into the first floor. In a ground-floor, the main central space is conceived as a sala terrena divided by six columns. The ceremonial Marble hall lined with Ionian demi-columns and gallery occupies the first and the second floor of the building. From this central cylinder the three lower wings run out. In these three square-shaped parts dwelling spaces, receiving rooms, parlours and cabinets are situated.

Every wing has its own mansard. The mansard of the central part is constructed as a cone and octahedral spire.

==Inspirations==
According to Mojmír Horyna the building was designed as a „radius centrally planned building“, the type Santini-Aichel had applied to sacral buildings in Panenské Břežany, Ostrov u Stříbra and Zelená Hora, and now newly used to create profane building. Santini-Aichel was probably influenced by Gian Lorenzo Bernini&#x27;s studies of using centrally planned building for designing profane architecture. The influence of Austrian architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach is also clear.

==Reconstructions==
In the last years of the 19th century the chateau was rebuilt. Between 1908 – 1909 outbuildings were reconstructed according to the plans of Friedrich Ohmann. Master builder Josef Blecha jr. and architect Ludvík Lábler carried out another great re-adjustment between 1927 – 1928.
After a fire in 1943 the chateau was repaired by SÚRPMO office in 1967. After 1990 the property was restituted to the Kinský family.

==Surroundings==
The Karlova Koruna chateau, situated on the top of small hill, was created as point de vue of the neighbouring park. Many remarkable species grow there – e.g. European black pine (Pinus nigra) or Turkish hazel (Corylus colurna).
Santini-Aichel also designed nearby chapel of Saint John the Baptist (earlier The chapel of Annunciation). This hexagonal-shaped building used to serve as a family sepulchre.
In early 19th century orangery designed by Kinský&#x27;s master builder Heinrich Koch in Empire style was built.

<text>Gidea Park railway station is on the Great Eastern Main Line, serving the neighbourhood of Gidea Park in Romford, located in the London Borough of Havering, east London. It is down the line from London Liverpool Street and is situated between Romford and Harold Wood. Its three-letter station code is GDP and it is in Travelcard zone 6. The station is managed and served by the Elizabeth line.

==History==
The station, constructed in a cutting, was opened as Squirrels Heath &amp; Gidea Park on 1 December 1910 by the Great Eastern Railway on that company&#x27;s main line out of London Liverpool Street. The station consisted of two island platforms with access via a footbridge, giving four platform faces despite the line being of two tracks beyond the station environs. The station signal box was elevated on a set of girders spanning the two central tracks, and there was a goods shed and coal staithes at the country end of the station on the south side of the line controlled by an additional signal box. Immediately beyond the goods facilities was the building known as the &quot;Romford Factory&quot; which had been the original locomotive works for the Eastern Counties Railway from 1843 until the opening of Stratford Works in 1847, and remained in use by the railway working on the manufacture and repair of canvas wagon sheets. The line through Romford and Gidea Park as far as Shenfield was quadrupled in 1930 to provide increased capacity and additional carriage sidings were added on the north side of the line opposite the goods facilities as part of these works. The order of words in the station name was switched to Gidea Park &amp; Squirrels Heath in late 1913 and the &quot;Squirrels Heath&quot; suffix was dropped by British Rail in February 1969.

=== Accidents and incidents ===
On 2 January 1947, in darkness and dense fog, an express train from London to , hauled by LNER Class B17 4-6-0 No. 1602 &quot;Walsingham&quot;, passed a signal at danger and collided with a stopping service bound for as it started to depart from Gidea Park on the country-bound main line. The Peterborough train was travelling at an estimated 30 to 35 mph on impact, which destroyed the rear three coaches of the Southend train. Seven people were killed in the crash and 45 were hospitalised. Two of the four lines through the station were reopened within two hours, and the other two followed the next day.
===Elizabeth line===
In 2017, new trains began entering service as Crossrail partially opened under the TfL Rail brand. The platforms at Gidea Park were extended from their current length of to accommodate the new Crossrail trains which are over long once extended to nine carriages. New lifts, signage, help points, customer information screens and CCTV were installed and the footbridge and carriage-sidings refurbished. Elizabeth line services began on 24 May 2022 and through services to Paddington commenced on 6 November 2022.

==Design==
The station has step-free access to all platforms and is accessibility classification category A.

==Services==
All services at Gidea Park are operated by the Elizabeth line using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 8 tph to of which 2 continue to 
* 8 tph to 

During the peak hours, the station is served by a number of additional services to and from London Liverpool Street that start and terminate at Gidea Park. These services do not call at .

On Sundays, the service to and from Shenfield is reduced to 4 tph, with alternating services starting and terminating at Gidea Park.


==Connections==

<doc id="1063719" wikidata="Q7756017" url="?curid=1063719" title="The Paper Chase (band)">
<text>The Paper Chase (stylized as &quot;the pAper chAse&quot;) was an American alternative rock band formed in 1998 by producer/engineer John Congleton in Dallas, Texas, who were signed to Kill Rock Stars and Southern Records. Their albums &quot;God Bless Your Black Heart&quot; and &quot;Now You Are One of Us&quot; have been released on vinyl by the Austrian label Trost Records. The Paper Chase produced a combination of discordant melody and jagged noise pop, described by Allmusic as &quot;a jagged structure of avant-garde jazz, noise, indie, and punk&quot;.

==History==
Congleton wrote and produced all of the material, with a few exceptions: Bobby Weaver co-wrote &quot;A Face That Could Launch a Thousand Ships&quot; and &quot;Off with Their Heads&quot; from the album &quot;Young Bodies Heal Quickly, You Know&quot;. Mike Sanger co-wrote &quot;Throw Your Body on the Apparatus&quot;, and Elliot Figg co-wrote &quot;When You Least Expect It,&quot; both from the aforementioned album.

Their next project would have been a two-part album centered on natural disasters. The first half, entitled &quot;Someday This Could All Be Yours (vol. 1 The Calamities)&quot; was released on May 26, 2009 through Kill Rock Stars Records, though the second part has remained unreleased since the band&#x27;s dissolution.

<text>The First English Civil War took place in England and Wales from 1642 to 1646, and forms part of the 1639 to 1653 Wars of the Three Kingdoms. An estimated 15% to 20% of adult males in England and Wales served in the military at some point between 1639 and 1653, while around 4% of the total population died from war-related causes. These figures illustrate the widespread impact of the conflict on society, and the bitterness it engendered as a result.

Conflict over the role of Parliament and religious practice dated from the accession of James VI and I in 1603. These tensions culminated in the imposition of Personal Rule in 1629 by his son, Charles I, who recalled Parliament in April and November 1640. He hoped by doing so to obtain funding that would enable him to reverse his defeat by Scots Covenanters in the Bishops&#x27; Wars, but in return Parliament demanded a greater share in government than he was willing to concede.

In its early stages, the vast majority on both sides supported the institution of monarchy, but disagreed on who held ultimate authority. Royalists generally argued both Parliament and the Church of England were subordinate to the king, while most of their Parliamentarian opponents claimed his supremacy did not extend to religion, and wanted a form of constitutional monarchy. When it came to choosing sides, however, individual choices were heavily influenced by religious belief or personal loyalty. Horrified at the devastation inflicted on Europe by the Thirty Years War, many tried to remain neutral, or took up arms with great reluctance.

When fighting began in August 1642, both sides believed it would be settled by a single battle, but it soon became clear this was not the case. Royalist successes in 1643 led to an alliance between Parliament and the Scots, who won a series of battles in 1644, the most significant being the Battle of Marston Moor. Alleged failures to exploit these successes led Parliament in February 1645 to set up the New Model Army, the first centrally funded and professional military force in England, whose success at Naseby in June 1645 proved decisive. The war ended with victory for the Parliamentarian alliance in June 1646 and Charles in custody. However, his refusal to agree to concessions, combined with divisions among his opponents, led to the Second English Civil War in 1648, followed by his execution in January 1649.

==Overview==
The 1642 to 1646 First English Civil War is one of a series of civil wars fought between 1639 and 1653 in England and Wales, along with the separate kingdoms of Scotland and Ireland. Known collectively as the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, others include the 1639 and 1640 Bishops&#x27; Wars, 1641 to 1653 Irish Confederate Wars, 1648 Second English Civil War, 1649 to 1653 Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, and 1650 to 1652 Anglo-Scottish War, previously known as the Third English Civil War. The First and Second English Civil Wars are sometimes grouped together as the 1642 to 1648 English Civil War. 

The underlying cause of the war in England was a long-running struggle for political and religious control between the monarchy and Parliament that began when James VI and I became king in 1603. The issues arising re-surfaced after the 1660 Stuart Restoration, and were arguably only resolved by the 1688 Glorious Revolution. American historians like Kevin Phillips have identified many similarities between the principles at stake in 1642, and those which led to the American Revolution in 1776.

==Royalist or Parliamentarian==
A simple division of the opposing parties into Royalist Cavaliers and Parliamentarian Roundheads is a perspective that is now accepted as outdated, but which still informs modern perceptions. These are also influenced by the complex historical reputation of Oliver Cromwell, particularly in Ireland. The installation of his statue outside the Houses of Parliament was approved in 1856, but not carried out until 1895, with most of the funds supplied by Prime Minister Lord Rosebery. In 2004, a group of MPs unsuccessfully proposed a motion to have it melted down, and the debate continues.

However, individual motives for choosing a side were complex, and there were wide areas of alignment between Royalists and Parliamentarians. Many tried to remain neutral, or participated with extreme reluctance, while others fought on both sides at different points. Historian Tim Harris suggests that by 1640, most agreed attempts by Charles to govern without Parliament had gone too far. After the Grand Remonstrance was submitted in late 1641, moderates like Edward Hyde created a Royalist political faction, arguing Parliament was trying to alter the balance too much the other way.

Both sides claimed they were seeking to restore the &quot;ancient constitution&quot;. For many supporters of Parliament, Stuart concepts of the divine right of kings and absolutism brought in by James VI and I in 1603 were &quot;innovations&quot; that had undermined &quot;traditional&quot; English freedoms and rights. However, there were different views on the nature of these &quot;rights&quot;. This caused divisions within Parliament as the war progressed, since not everyone agreed on what they were seeking to restore, or even if it were desirable.

Most Parliamentarians went to war in 1642 not to depose the king but regulate his powers, while only a tiny minority sought to abolish the monarchy altogether. John Pym, Parliamentarian leader in the Commons, was one of the few who believed forcing Charles to abdicate might be the only option, since past experience showed he would not keep commitments he considered forced on him. Examples included his annulment of the 1628 Petition of Right, and the recent Bishops Wars, when he agreed peace terms with the Scots in 1639 only to provide time to plan another military campaign in 1640. These doubts were confirmed when he and his wife Henrietta Maria repeatedly told foreign ambassadors any concessions made to Parliament were temporary, and would be retrieved by force.

Charles&#x27; credibility mattered because regardless of religion or political belief, the vast majority in all three kingdoms believed a &#x27;well-ordered&#x27; monarchy was divinely mandated. His opponents argued that if Charles would not obey his own laws or keep his promises, this presented a threat to the state which required either forcing him to do so, or deposing him in favour of his eldest son. Where they disagreed was what &#x27;well-ordered&#x27; meant, particularly in terms of the role of Parliament, and control of the church. Both issues were linked, because in the 17th century &#x27;true religion&#x27; and &#x27;good government&#x27; were seen as mutually dependent. In general, Royalists supported a Church of England governed by bishops, appointed by, and answerable to, the king, while most Parliamentarians believed he was answerable to the leaders of the church, appointed by their congregations. 

Another common misperception is that &quot;Roundhead&quot; was interchangeable with &quot;Puritan&quot;. In reality, this term applied to anyone who wanted to &quot;purify&quot; the Church of England of &quot;Papist&quot; practices, and covered a wide range of views. Although the majority supported Parliament, some prominent Puritans like Sir William Savile backed Charles out of personal loyalty. Conversely, many Royalists objected to Laudianism, and opposed the appointment of Catholics to senior positions, while attempts to integrate Irish Catholic troops in 1643 caused some regiments to mutiny. Parliamentarians were divided between Presbyterians like Pym who wanted to reform the Church of England, and religious Independents who rejected any form of established church and wanted it abolished. They included Congregationalists like Cromwell and Baptists, who were especially well represented in the New Model Army. 

Later in the war, conflicting religious and political aims resulted in the emergence within Parliament of a middle party of &quot;Independent Royalists&quot;. These were generally religious radicals but social conservatives, led by William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele, his son Nathaniel Fiennes, and Nathaniel Rich. They were distinguished from Royalists in believing Charles had to be defeated militarily, and from moderate Presbyterians by their fervent opposition to state-mandated religion. After Parliament&#x27;s victory in 1646, this group supported the Treaty of Newport, and a &quot;balanced&quot; political solution that would leave Charles on the throne. Its members avoided participation in his trial and execution, although they did not speak against it. 

While Puritans were the most visible in opposing Laudian reforms and demanding the removal of bishops from the Church of England, their objections were shared by many Royalists, such as George Morley and Sir Edmund Verney. One reason was that bishops held a variety of non-religious roles which impacted all levels of society; they acted as state censors, who were able to ban sermons and writings, while ordinary people could be tried by church courts for crimes including blasphemy, heresy, fornication and other &#x27;sins of the flesh&#x27;, as well as matrimonial or inheritance disputes. As members of the House of Lords, bishops often blocked legislation opposed by the Crown; their ousting from Parliament by the Clergy Act 1640 was a major step on the road to war, since it meant Charles could no longer prevent passage of legislation that he opposed. 

Their removal temporarily ended censorship, and especially in London led to an explosion in the printing of pamphlets, books and sermons, many advocating radical religious and political ideas. Even before 1642, such radicalism concerned conservative Parliamentarians like Denzil Holles. As the war progressed, both they and their Scottish Covenanter allies came to see the Independents and New Model Army as more dangerous than the Royalists and formed the &quot;Peace Party&quot;, seeking a negotiated end to the fighting. An alliance between Royalists and these two groups led to the Second English Civil War in 1648. 

Lastly, in 1642 England and Wales were part of a highly structured, socially conservative and peaceful society, while the devastation caused by the Thirty Years War in Europe meant many wanted to avoid conflict at any cost. Choice of sides was often driven by personal relationships or loyalties, and in the early stages there were numerous examples of armed neutrality, or local truces, designed to force the two sides to negotiate.

==1642==
Over the winter of 1641 to 1642, many towns strengthened their defences, and purchased weapons, although not necessarily due to fears of civil war. Lurid details of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 meant many were more concerned by reports of a planned Catholic invasion. Both sides supported raising troops to suppress the rising, but alleged Royalist conspiracies to use them against Parliament meant neither trusted the other with their control. When Charles left London after failing to arrest the Five Members in January 1642, he handed Parliament control of the largest city, port and commercial centre in England, its biggest weapons store in the Tower of London, and best equipped local militia, or trained bands.

Founded in 1572, these were organised by county, controlled by lord-lieutenants appointed by the king, and constituted the only permanent military force in the country. The muster roll of February 1638 shows wide variations in size, equipment and training; Yorkshire had the largest, with 12,000 men, followed by London with 8,000, later increased to 20,000. &#x27;Royalist&#x27; counties like Shropshire or Glamorgan had fewer than 500 men.

In March 1642, Parliament approved the Militia Ordinance, claiming control of the trained bands; Charles responded with his own Commissions of Array. More important than the men were the local arsenals, with Parliament holding the two largest in London, and Hull. These belonged to the local community, who often resisted attempts to remove them, by either side. In Royalist Cheshire, the towns of Nantwich, Knutsford and Chester declared a state of armed neutrality, and excluded both parties.

Ports were vital for access to internal and external waterways, the primary method of importing and transporting bulk supplies until the advent of railways in the 19th century. Most of the Royal Navy declared for Parliament, allowing them to protect the trade routes vital to the London merchant community, block Royalist imports and resupply isolated Parliamentarian garrisons. It also made other countries wary of antagonising one of the strongest navies in Europe by providing support to their opponents. By September, forces loyal to Parliament held every major port in England apart from Newcastle, which prevented Royalist areas in Wales and South West and North East England from supporting each other. In February 1642, Charles sent his wife, Henrietta Maria, to the Hague to raise money and purchase weapons; lack of a secure port delayed her return until February 1643, and even then, she narrowly escaped capture.

On 1 June 1642, Parliament approved a list of proposals known as the Nineteen Propositions, which would give them control over ministerial appointments, the army and management of the Royal household, including the education and marriage of his children. These were presented to Charles at Newmarket, who angrily rejected them without further discussion. He was later persuaded to issue a more conciliatory answer, whose objective was primarily to appeal to moderates by placing blame for what now seemed an inevitable military conflict on Pym and his followers. Drafted by Hyde, this response has been seen as the origin of &quot;mixed&quot; or constitutional monarchy, although whether Charles himself genuinely believed in it is debatable.

Both sides expected a single battle and quick victory; for the Royalists, this meant capturing London, for Parliament, &#x27;rescuing&#x27; the king from his &#x27;evil counsellors&#x27;. After failing to capture Hull in July, Charles left York for Nottingham, chosen for its proximity to Royalist areas in the Midlands and Northern Wales. Particularly in the early stages of the conflict, locally raised troops were reluctant to serve outside their own county, and most of those recruited in Yorkshire refused to accompany him. On 22 August, Charles formally declared war on Parliamentarian &#x27;rebels&#x27;, but by early September his army still numbered less than 2,500, with much of England hoping to remain neutral. 

In contrast, financing from the London mercantile community and weapons from the Tower enabled Parliament to recruit and equip an army of 20,000, commanded by the Presbyterian Earl of Essex, who left London on 3 September for Northampton. Charles relocated to Shrewsbury, further away from London but a key Royalist recruitment centre throughout the war. When Essex learned of this, he marched on Worcester, where the first major encounter of the war took place at Powick Bridge on 23 September. A relatively minor Royalist victory, it established the reputation of Prince Rupert, whose cavalry gained a psychological edge over their Parliamentarian opponents.

The Royalist army now numbered around 15,000, although much of the infantry were armed with clubs or scythes; while better equipped, the forces of Parliament were half-trained, poorly disciplined, and their logistics inadequate. When Charles headed for London, Essex tried to block his route, and on 23 October, the two armies fought a bloody, chaotic, and indecisive battle at Edgehill. Essex continued retreating towards London; after an inconclusive encounter on 16 November at Turnham Green, west of London, operations ended for the winter. The Royalists withdrew to Oxford, which became their capital for the rest of the war. Elsewhere, Sir William Waller secured the south-east for Parliament; in December, Lord Wilmot captured Marlborough, opening communications between Oxford, and Royalist forces based at Launceston, in Cornwall.

==1643==
The events of 1642 showed the need to plan for a lengthy conflict. For the Royalists, this meant fortifying their new capital in Oxford, and connecting areas of support in England and Wales; Parliament focused on consolidating control of the areas they already held. Although peace talks were held, both parties continued to negotiate for Scottish and Irish support. Charles sought to end the war in Ireland, which would enable him to transfer troops from the Royal Irish Army to England.

Fighting continued during the winter in Yorkshire, where the Royalist Duke of Newcastle tried to secure a landing place for an arms shipment from the Dutch Republic. With insufficient troops to hold the entire area, his task was further complicated by Parliamentarian forces under Lord Fairfax and his son Thomas, which retained key towns like Hull and Leeds. Along with Henrietta Maria, the weapons convoy finally managed to land at Bridlington in late February; on 4 June she left York escorted by 5,000 cavalry, arriving in Oxford in mid-July.

In the south-west, Royalist commander Sir Ralph Hopton secured Cornwall with victory at Braddock Down in January. In June, he advanced into Wiltshire, inflicting a serious defeat on Waller&#x27;s &#x27;Army of the Southern Association&#x27; at Roundway Down on 13 July. Arguably the most comprehensive Royalist victory of the war, it isolated Parliament&#x27;s garrisons in the west and Prince Rupert stormed Bristol on 26 July. This gave the Royalists control of the second largest city in Britain and landing point for reinforcements from Ireland.

By late August, the Parliamentarian cause was close to collapse but was saved by Pym&#x27;s leadership and determination, which resulted in important reforms. Both sides struggled to properly supply troops fighting outside their home regions and Parliament agreed steps to mitigate the problem. Seeing an opportunity to force Parliamentary moderates into a negotiated peace, in September the Royalists agreed a new three-part offensive. After taking Gloucester, Prince Rupert would advance on London, while Newcastle would tie down the Eastern Association army by advancing into East Anglia and Lincolnshire. Finally, Hopton would march into Hampshire and Sussex, threatening London from the south, and closing the iron foundries that were Parliament&#x27;s main source of armaments.

However, Essex forced Prince Rupert to retreat from Gloucester, then checked his advance on London at Newbury on 20 September. Although Hopton reached Winchester, Waller prevented him making further progress; in October, Newcastle abandoned the second siege of Hull, while victory at Winceby secured eastern England for Parliament. Royalist failure ended any chance of concluding the war in the near future, leading both sides to step up the search for allies.

In September, the Marquess of Ormond, Royalist Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, agreed a truce with the Catholic Confederation. The &quot;Cessation&quot; meant troops could be sent to England, but it cost Charles the support of many Irish Protestants, especially in Munster. At the same time, details emerged of the &quot;Antrim scheme&quot;, an alleged plan to use 20,000 Irish troops to recapture southern Scotland for Charles. Although highly impractical, the Covenanter government now broke off negotiations with the Royalists. Shortly thereafter, they signed the Solemn League and Covenant with Parliament, which provided Scottish military support in return for subsidies. Parliament also agreed to create the Westminster Assembly, whose purpose was to set up a single, Presbyterian church for England and Scotland. This in turn caused divisions with those Parliamentarians who preferred a separate Church of England, as well as religious Independents who opposed any state religion.

==1644==


The Solemn League created a Committee of Both Kingdoms to co-ordinate strategy in all three war zones, England, Scotland and Ireland, although Pym&#x27;s death in December 1643 deprived Parliament of their most important leader. The Scots under Leven were ordered to take Newcastle, securing coal supplies for London, and closing the major import point for Royalist war supplies. He besieged the town in early February, but made little progress, observed by the Earl of Newcastle from his base in Durham.

On 29 March, Waller ended the offensive in Southern England by defeating Hopton at Cheriton, then joined Essex to threaten Oxford. Two weeks later, the Earl of Manchester defeated a Royalist force at Selby, forcing Newcastle to leave Durham and garrison York. The city was besieged by the Scots, Sir Thomas Fairfax, and Manchester&#x27;s Army of the Eastern Association.

In May, Prince Rupert left Shrewsbury, and marched north, capturing Liverpool and Bolton en route. To avoid being shut up in Oxford, a field army nominally commanded by Charles retreated to Worcester; Essex ordered Waller to remain there, while he went west to relieve the siege of Lyme Regis. On 29 June, Waller clashed with Charles at Cropredy Bridge; although losses were minimal, his men were demoralised, and the army disintegrated, allowing Charles to pursue Essex into the West Country.

On the same day, Prince Rupert arrived at Knaresborough, 30 kilometres from York, to find himself facing a superior force. In the largest battle of the war on 2 July, the two armies met at Marston Moor, a decisive Royalist defeat that lost them the North. York surrendered on 16 July, and the Earl of Newcastle went into exile.

Essex forced the Royalists to abandon Lyme Regis, then continued into Cornwall, ignoring orders to return to London. In September, his army was trapped at Lostwithiel; 5,000 infantry were forced to surrender, although Essex and the cavalry escaped. At Second Newbury on 27 October, the Royalists lifted the siege of Donnington Castle, and Charles re-entered Oxford.

In military terms, by the end of 1644 the Royalists had recovered from the disaster at Marston Moor; of greater concern was their ability to finance the war. Unlike Parliament, which could levy taxes on imports and exports through London and other commercial centres, the Royalists simply took supplies from the areas they controlled. This led to the creation of Clubmen, or local self-defence associations; they opposed confiscations by either party, but were a bigger issue in Royalist areas like Cornwall and Hertfordshire.

The deaths of John Pym and John Hampden in 1643 removed a unifying force within Parliament, and deepened divisions. Supported by the Scots, the &#x27;Peace Party&#x27; were concerned by political radicals like the Levellers, and wanted an immediate, negotiated settlement. The &#x27;War Party&#x27; fundamentally mistrusted Charles, and saw military victory as the only way to secure their objectives. Many were religious Independents who opposed any state church, and strongly objected to Scottish demands for a unified, Presbyterian church of England and Scotland; Oliver Cromwell claimed he would fight, rather than accept such an outcome.

Failure to exploit Marston Moor, Essex&#x27; capitulation at Lostwithiel, and Manchester&#x27;s alleged unwillingness to fight at Newbury led to claims some senior commanders were not committed to victory. Accusations against Manchester and Essex in particular were not confined to Cromwell, but shared by some Presbyterians, including Waller. In December, Sir Henry Vane introduced the Self-denying Ordinance, requiring any military officers who also sat in Parliament to resign one office or the other. Manchester and Essex were automatically removed, since they could not resign their titles, although they could be re-appointed, &#x27;if Parliament approved.&#x27;

It also led to the creation of the New Model Army, a centralised, professional force, able and willing to operate wherever needed. Many of its recruits had served with Cromwell in the Eastern Association, or shared his views, and opponents viewed the New Model with suspicion from the outset. To offset this, they appointed the moderates Fairfax and Philip Skippon as Commander-in-Chief and head of the infantry respectively, as well as retaining some regional forces. These included the Northern and Western Associations, plus those serving in Cheshire and South Wales, all commanded by supporters of the Presbyterian faction in Parliament. Although he remained an MP, Cromwell was given command of the cavalry, under a &#x27;temporary&#x27; three-month commission, constantly renewed.

==1645==
In January, representatives of both sides met at Uxbridge to discuss peace terms, but talks ended without agreement in February. Failure strengthened the pro-war parties, since it was clear Charles would never make concessions voluntarily, while divisions among their opponents encouraged the Royalists to continue fighting. In early 1645, the Royalists still controlled most of the West Country, Wales, and counties along the English border, despite losing their key supply base at Shrewsbury in February. Lord Goring&#x27;s Western Army made another attempt on Portsmouth and Farnham; although he was forced to retreat, it showed Parliament could not assume this area was secure, while Montrose&#x27;s Highland Campaign opened another front in the war.

On 31 May, Prince Rupert stormed Leicester; in response, Fairfax and the New Model Army abandoned their blockade of Oxford, and on 14 June, won a decisive victory at Naseby. Defeat cost the Royalists their most formidable field army, along with their artillery train, stores, and Charles&#x27; personal baggage. This included his private correspondence, detailing efforts to gain support from the Irish Catholic Confederation, the Papacy and France. Published by Parliament in a pamphlet entitled &quot;The King&#x27;s Cabinet Opened&quot;, it seriously damaged his reputation.

After Naseby, Royalist strategy was to preserve their positions in Western England and Wales, while their cavalry went north to link up with Montrose in Scotland. Charles also hoped the Irish Catholic Confederation would supply him with an army of 10,000, that would land in Bristol and combine with Lord Goring to smash the New Model. Such hopes were illusory, and the only result was to deepen divisions among the Royalist leadership, many of whom viewed the proposed use of Catholic Irish troops in England with as much horror as their Parliamentarian opponents. Concerned by the wider implications of Royalist defeat and urged on by Henrietta Maria, French chief minister Cardinal Mazarin looked for ways to restore Charles with minimal French intervention. Talks were held between his representative, Jean de Montereul, and Lord Lothian, a senior Covenanter who was deeply suspicious of Cromwell and the Independents, but these discussions ultimately went nowhere.

Prince Rupert was sent to supervise the defence of Bristol and the West, while Charles made his way to Raglan Castle, then headed for the Scottish border. He reached as far north as Doncaster in Yorkshire, before retreating to Oxford in the face of superior Parliamentarian forces. In July, Fairfax lifted the siege of Taunton; a few days later at Langport, he destroyed Lord Goring&#x27;s Western Army, the last significant Royalist field force. At the end of August, Charles left Oxford to relieve Hereford, which was besieged by the Covenanter army; as he approached, Leven was ordered to return to Scotland, following Montrose&#x27;s victory at Kilsyth. The king moved onto Chester, where he learned Prince Rupert had surrendered Bristol on 10 September. Shocked by the loss, Charles dismissed his nephew.

While one detachment from the New Model under Colonel Rainsborough secured Berkeley Castle, another under Cromwell captured Royalist strongholds at Basing House and Winchester. Having secured his rear, Fairfax began reducing remaining positions in the west; by now, Clubmen militia in Hampshire and Dorset were as big an issue as the Royalist army. When his remaining cavalry were scattered at Rowton Heath on 24 September, Charles abandoned attempts to reach Scotland and returned to Newark. On 13 October, he learned of Montrose&#x27;s defeat at Philiphaugh a month earlier, ending plans for taking the war into Scotland. The loss of Carmarthen and Chepstow in South Wales cut connections with Royalist supporters in Ireland (see Map) and Charles made his way back to Oxford, where he spent the winter besieged by the New Model.

==1646==
Following the fall of Hereford in December 1645, the Royalists held only Devon, Cornwall, North Wales, and isolated garrisons in Exeter, Oxford, Newark, and Scarborough Castle. Chester surrendered in February, after which the Northern Association Army joined the Covenanters besieging Newark. Hopton replaced Lord Goring as commander of the Western Army, and attempted to relieve Exeter. Defeated by the New Model at Torrington on 16 February, he surrendered at Truro on 12 March.

The last pitched battle of the war took place at Stow-on-the-Wold on 21 March, when 3,000 Royalists were dispersed by Parliamentary forces. With the end of the war in sight, Parliament issued a proclamation, allowing favourable terms for any Royalists who &#x27;compounded&#x27; prior to 1 May. Those whose estates had been confiscated could regain them on payment of a fine, which was calculated on the value of their lands, and level of support; many took advantage of this.

After capturing Exeter and Barnstaple in April, the New Model marched on Oxford; on 27 April, Charles left the city in disguise, accompanied by two others. Parliament learned of his escape on the 29th, but for over a week had no idea where he was. On 6 May, they received a letter from David Leslie, the Scottish commander at Newark, announcing he had Charles in custody. Newark surrendered the same day, and the Scots went north to Newcastle, taking the king with them. This led to furious objections from Parliament, who approved a resolution ordering the Scots to leave England immediately.

After lengthy negotiations, Oxford capitulated on 24 June; the garrison received passes to return home, and Prince Rupert and his brother, Prince Maurice, were ordered to leave England. Wallingford Castle surrendered on 27 July, then the remaining Royalist strongholds, although Harlech Castle in Wales held out until 13 March 1647.

==Aftermath==
In 1642, many Parliamentarians assumed military defeat would force Charles to agree to terms, which proved a fundamental misunderstanding of his character. When Prince Rupert told him in August 1645 that the war could no longer be won, Charles responded that while this may have been an accurate assessment of the military situation, &#x27;God will not suffer rebels and traitors to prosper&#x27;. This deeply-held conviction meant he refused to agree to any substantial concessions, frustrating both allies and opponents.

Although Charles correctly assumed widespread support for the institution of monarchy made his position extremely strong, he failed to appreciate the impact of his constant prevarications, both before and during the war. He made peace with the Scots in 1639, then raised an army against them in 1640, while his actions prior to March 1642 convinced Parliament he would not keep his promises, and that any money they supplied to him would be employed against them. At various points in the period following Royalist defeat in 1646, he was negotiating separately with the Irish Confederation, the English Independents, the Covenanters, English Presbyterians, France, and the Papacy.

The result was the creation of a powerful faction who believed Charles would never voluntarily agree to a suitable political settlement, and whose control of the New Model Army gave them the ability to impose one. Often grouped together as &#x27;Independents&#x27;, the reality was far more fluid; Sir Thomas Fairfax was a Presbyterian, who fought for Charles in 1639, and refused to participate in his execution, while even Cromwell initially viewed him with great respect. William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele, and his sons Nathaniel and John, are examples of those supported the Independents out of religious conviction, but wanted Charles to retain his throne.

Charles continued to stall, to the increasing frustration of all parties, especially members of the New Model, many of whom had not been paid for over a year and wanted to go home. By March 1647, these arrears amounted to some £2.5 million, an enormous sum for the period, and moderates in Parliament led by Denzil Holles decided to remove the threat by sending the army to Ireland. Importantly, only those who agreed to go would receive their arrears, and when regimental representatives, or Agitators, demanded full payment for all in advance, Parliament disbanded the New Model, which refused to be dissolved. Although both Cromwell and Fairfax were disturbed by the radicalism displayed by parts of the army in the Putney Debates, they supported them against Parliament over the issue of pay. These tensions contributed to the outbreak of the Second English Civil War in 1648.

<text>Yosef Hayim (1 September 1835 – 30 August 1909) (Iraqi Hebrew: Yoseph Ḥayyim; ; or Yosef Chaim) was a leading Baghdadi &quot;hakham&quot; (Sephardi rabbi), authority on &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law), and Master Kabbalist. He is best known as author of the work on &quot;halakha&quot; Ben Ish Ḥai () (&quot;Son of Man (who) Lives&quot;), a collection of the laws of everyday life interspersed with mystical insights and customs, addressed to the masses and arranged by the weekly Torah portion.

==Biography==
Hayim initially studied in his father&#x27;s library, and, at the age of 10, he left the beth midrash and began to study with his uncle, David Hai Ben Meir, who later founded the &quot;Shoshanim LeDavid&quot; yeshiva in Jerusalem. In 1851, he married Rachel, the niece of Abdallah Somekh, his prime mentor, with whom he had a daughter and two sons.

When Hayim was only twenty-five years old, his father died. Despite his youth, the Jews of Baghdad accepted him to fill his father&#x27;s place as the leading rabbinic scholar of Baghdad, though he never filled the official position of &quot;Hakham Bashi. &quot;The Sephardic Porat Yosef Yeshiva in Jerusalem was founded on his advice by Joseph Shalom, of Calcutta, India—one of Hayim&#x27;s patrons.

Hayim clashed with the reformist Bavarian Jewish scholar Jacob Obermeyer, who lived in Baghdad from 1869 to 1880, and Hayyim excommunicated him. Part of the contention was due to Obermeyer and Hayim&#x27;s conflicting views on promotion of the &quot;Zohar&quot;.

==Works==
The Ben Ish Hai () is a standard reference in some Sephardi homes (functioning as &quot;a Sephardi Kitzur Shulchan Aruch&quot;) and is widely studied in Sephardi yeshivot. Due to the popularity of this book, Hakham Yosef Hayim came to be known as Ben Ish Hai. The book is a collection of homilies he gave over two years discussing the weekly parsha or Torah portion. Each chapter begins with a mystical discussion, usually explaining how a Kabbalistic interpretation of a certain verse relates to particular halakha, and then continuing to expound on that halakha with definitive rulings.

Hakham Yosef Hayim authored over thirty other works, and there are many published Iraqi rite siddurim (prayer books) based on his rulings, which are widely used by Sephardi Jews. Amongst the best known of his works are:

*&quot;Me-Kabtziel&quot; (Miqqabṣiʾel): an esoteric exposition of Jewish law providing a more detailed explanation of the reasoning underlying certain decisions. It has been speculated that Yosef Hayim&#x27;s insistence on having all his works printed in the Jerusalem Sanjak prevented this essential work from being published.
*&quot;Ben Yehoyada&quot; (&quot;Ben Yəhoyadaʻ&quot;) and &quot;Benayahou&quot;: his commentary on the Talmud, considered a basic resource in understanding the Aggada (narrative sections of the Talmud).
*The responsum () &quot;Rav Pe&#x27;alim&quot; (&quot;Rab Pəʻalim&quot;) and &quot;Torah Lishmah&quot;.
* (reprinted in 1994) 

The names &quot;Ben Ish Hai&quot;, &quot;Me-Kabtziel&quot;, &quot;Rav Pe&#x27;alim&quot; and &quot;Ben Yehoyada&quot; derive from 2 Samuel 23:20. He chose these names because he claimed to have been a reincarnation of Benayahu ben Yehoyada, described as &quot;Ben Ish Hayil&quot; &quot;son of a valiant man&quot;; the man in whose merit, it is said, both the first and second Temple in Jerusalem stood.

Yosef Hayim was also noted for his stories and parables. Some are scattered through his halakhic works, but have since been collected and published separately; others were published as separate works in his lifetime, as an alternative to the European-inspired secular literature that was becoming popular at the time. His Qânûn-un-Nisâ (قانون النساء) is a book filled with parables concerning self-improvement. The book, directed towards, but not limited to women, is rare since it was composed in Baghdad Jewish Arabic. It was last published in Israel in the 1940s.

<text>Power Line is an American conservative or right-leaning political blog, founded in May 2002. Its posts were originally written by three lawyers who attended Dartmouth College together, namely John H. Hinderaker, Scott W. Johnson, and Paul Mirengoff. Contributors initially wrote under pen names; John Hinderaker, for example, wrote as &quot;Hindrocket.&quot; The site is published by Joseph Malchow, also a Dartmouth graduate.

The site gained recognition for its role in covering the Killian documents story that aired during the 2004 Presidential campaign about forged documents relating to President George W. Bush&#x27;s term of service in the Texas Air National Guard.

==History==
Scott Johnson and John Hinderaker had been actively publishing op-eds, magazine articles and research articles for about a decade. On the weekend of Memorial Day, 2002, Hinderaker invited Johnson to start publishing on the Power Line site he had recently created. Johnson credited Hugh Hewitt&#x27;s radio broacasts as being the &quot;first big break and recognition&quot; the site received.

In 2004, Power Line was named &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s first-ever &quot;Blog of the Year&quot;.
When AOL added blogs to their news website in 2007, Power Line was one of the five blogs included. A 2007 memo from the National Republican Senatorial Committee described Power Line as one of the five best-read national conservative blogs. That same year, &quot;Forbes&quot; recognised Hinderaker as the #19th &quot;biggest and brightest star on the web&quot; on the strength of Powerline&#x27;s work on Rathergate.

In 2009, CBS News described Powerline as &quot;a prominent conservative blog.&quot; In 2014, CBS News reported the site had half a million readers and eight million page views.

== Contributors ==
The main contributors to Power Line are John H. Hinderaker, Scott W. Johnson, Steven F. Hayward, and Lloyd Billingsley. Susan Vass, writing under the name &quot;Ammo Grrrll&quot;, contributes a humor column to the site every Friday.

== Rathergate ==
Power Line gained widespread recognition during the 2004 Killian documents controversy relating to a CBS report on George W. Bush&#x27;s service in the Texas Air National Guard, starting with a post entitled &quot;The Sixty-First Minute&quot;; Powerline is credited with helping break the story. Conservatives (including Power Line, National Review Online and Little Green Footballs) referred to the controversy as &quot;Rathergate&quot;. The blogs and their readers questioned the authenticity of the documents, presenting hints of supposed forgery. After noting that the alleged documents used a proportional font, Power Line helped advance the story, triggering coverage by mainstream media outlets. Dan Rather apologized and resigned from the CBS anchor chair.

<doc id="1063752" wikidata="Q420571" url="?curid=1063752" title="Ticlopidine">
<text>Ticlopidine, sold under the brand name Ticlid, is a medication used to reduce the risk of thrombotic strokes. It is an antiplatelet drug in the thienopyridine family which is an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitor. Research initially showed that it was useful for preventing strokes and coronary stent occlusions. However, because of its rare but serious side effects of neutropenia and thrombotic microangiopathy it was primarily used in patients in whom aspirin was not tolerated, or in whom dual antiplatelet therapy was desirable. With the advent of newer and safer antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel and ticagrelor, its use remained limited.
It was patented in 1973 and approved for medical use in 1978.

== Medical uses ==

Ticlopidine is indicated for the prevention of strokes and when combined with aspirin, for people with a new coronary stent to prevent closure.

=== Stroke ===
Ticlopidine is considered a second-line option for the prevention of thrombotic strokes among patients who have previously had a stroke or TIA. Studies have shown that it is superior to aspirin in the prevention of death or future strokes. However, it also has more frequent and serious side effects compared to aspirin, so it is reserved for those patients that cannot take aspirin.

=== Heart disease ===
When a patient needs to have a stent placed in one of the vessels around their heart, it is important that that stent stay open to keep blood flowing to the heart. Therefore, patients with stents must take medications after the procedure to help maintain that blood flow. Ticlopidine, taken together with aspirin, is FDA approved for this purpose, and in studies it has been shown to work better than aspirin alone or aspirin with an anticoagulant. However, ticlopidine’s serious side effects make it less useful than its cousin, clopidogrel. Current recommendations no longer recommend ticlopidine’s use.

== Contraindications ==
The use of ticlopidine is contraindicated in anyone with:
* Increased risk of bleeding (i.e. frequent falls, gastrointestinal bleeds)
* History of hematological disease
* Severe liver disease
* History of allergic reaction to ticlopidine or any thienopyridine drug such as clopidogrel
Because of the increased risk of bleeding, patients taking ticlopidine should discontinue the medication 10–14 days before surgery.

== Adverse effects ==
The most serious side effects associated with ticlopidine are those that affect the blood cells, although these life-threatening complications are relatively rare. The most common side effects include:
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Dyspepsia
* Rash
* Abdominal pain
Ticlopidine may also cause an increase in cholesterol, triglycerides, liver enzymes, and bleeding.

=== Hematological ===
Use of ticlopidine has been associated with neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and aplastic anemia. Because of this risk, patients who are started on ticlopidine are typically monitored with blood tests to test their cell counts every two weeks for the first three months.

=== Pregnancy and lactation ===
Ticlopidine is a FDA pregnancy risk category B. There have been no studies done in humans. Studies in rats show that high drug levels could cause toxicity in both mother and fetus, but there are no known birth defects associated with its use.

There have been no studies to test whether ticlopidine goes into breast milk. Studies in rats have shown that it is passed in rats’ milk.

== Interactions ==
Ticlopidine interacts with several classes of medications. It increases the antiplatelet effects of aspirin and other NSAIDs. Taking ticlopidine at the same time as antacids decreases the absorption of ticlopidine. Ticlopidine inhibits liver CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 and thus can affect blood levels of medications metabolized by these systems.

== Mechanism of action ==
Ticlopidine is a tetrahydro-thienopyridine which, when metabolized by the body, irreversibly blocks the P2Y12 component of the ADP receptor on the surface of platelets. Without ADP, fibrinogen does not bind to the platelet surface, preventing platelets from sticking to each other. By interfering with platelet function, ticlopidine prevents clots from forming on the inside of blood vessels. Anti-platelet effects start within 2 days and reach their maximum by 6 days of therapy. Ticlopidine’s effects persist for 3 days after discontinuing ticlopidine although it may take 1–2 weeks for platelet function to return to normal, as the medication affects platelets irreversibly. Therefore, new platelets must be formed before platelet function normalizes.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Ticlopidine is ingested orally with 80% bioavailability with rapid absorption. Even higher absorption can occur if ticlopidine is taken with food. It is metabolized by the liver with both renal and fecal elimination. Clearance is nonlinear and varies with repeated dosing. After the first dose the half life is 12.6 hours, but with repeated dosing the maximum half life is 4–5 days. Clearance is also slower in the elderly. The drug is 98% reversibly bound to proteins.

== Chemical properties ==
Ticlopidine&#x27;s systemic name is 5-[(2-chlorophenyl)methyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-&quot;c&quot;]pyridine. Its molecular weight is 263.786 g/mol. It is a white crystalline solid. It is soluble in water and methanol and somewhat soluble in methylene chloride, ethanol, and acetone. It self-buffers in water to a pH of 3.6.

== History ==
Ticlopidine was discovered in the 1970s in France by a team led by Fernand Eloy and including Jean-Pierre Maffrand at Castaigne SA that was trying to discover a new anti-inflammatory medication. Pharmacology developers noted that this new compound had strong anti-platelet properties. Castaigne was acquired by Sanofi in 1973. Starting in 1978 the drug was marketed in France under the brand name Ticlid for people at high risk for thrombotic events, who had just come out of heart surgery, were undergoing hemodialysis, had peripheral vascular disease, or who were otherwise at risk for strokes and ischemic heart disease.

Ticlopidine was brought to market in the US by Syntex, which got the drug approved in 1991. Syntex was acquired by the Roche group in 1994. The first generic ticlopidine hydrochloride was FDA approved in 1999. As of April 2015, Roche, Caraco, Sandoz, Par, Major, Apotex, and Teva had discontinued generic ticlopidine and no ticlopidine preparations were available in the US.

==Research ==
Soon after its release, studies regarding ticlopidine found it had the potential to be helpful for other diseases including peripheral vascular disease, diabetic retinopathy, and sickle cell disease. However, none had enough evidence for FDA approval. Due to the blood cell side effects associated with ticlopidine, researchers for treatments for these conditions have turned to other avenues.

<doc id="1063753" wikidata="Q419374" url="?curid=1063753" title="Dipyridamole">
<text>Dipyridamole (trademarked as Persantine and others) is an antiplatelet drug of the nucleoside transport inhibitor and PDE3 inhibitor class that inhibits blood clot formation when given chronically and causes blood vessel dilation when given at high doses over a short time.

==Medical uses==
* Dipyridamole is used to dilate blood vessels in people with peripheral arterial disease and coronary artery disease.
* Dipyridamole has been shown to lower pulmonary hypertension without significant drop of systemic blood pressure.
* It inhibits proliferation of smooth muscle cells in vivo and modestly increases unassisted patency of synthetic arteriovenous hemodialysis grafts.
* Cyclic adenosine monophosphate impairs platelet aggregation and also causes arteriolar smooth muscle relaxation. Chronic therapy did not show significant drop of systemic blood pressure.
* It inhibits the replication of mengovirus RNA.
* It can be used for myocardial stress testing as an alternative to exercise-induced stress methods such as treadmills.

===Stroke===
A combination of dipyridamole and aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid/dipyridamole) is FDA-approved for the secondary prevention of stroke and has a bleeding risk equal to that of aspirin use alone. Dipyridamole absorption is pH-dependent and concomitant treatment with gastric acid suppressors (such as a proton pump inhibitor) will inhibit the absorption of liquid and plain tablets.

However, it is not licensed as monotherapy for stroke prophylaxis, although a Cochrane review suggested that dipyridamole may reduce the risk of further vascular events in patients presenting after cerebral ischemia.

A triple therapy of aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole has been investigated, but this combination led to an increase in adverse bleeding events.

== Drug interactions ==
Due to its action as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, dipyridamole is likely to potentiate the effects of adenosine. This occurs by blocking the nucleoside transporter (ENT1) through which adenosine enters erythrocyte and endothelial cells.

According to Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland 2016 guidelines, dipyridamole is considered to not cause risk of bleeding when receiving neuroaxial anaesthesia and deep nerve blocks. It does not therefore require cessation prior to anaesthesia with these techniques, and can continue to be taken with nerve block catheters in place.

==Overdose==
Dipyridamole overdose can be treated with aminophylline or caffeine which reverses its dilating effect on the blood vessels. Symptomatic treatment is recommended, possibly including a vasopressor drug. Gastric lavage should be considered. Since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit.

==Mechanisms of action==
Dipyridamole has two known effects, acting via different mechanisms of action:
* Dipyridamole inhibits the phosphodiesterase enzymes that normally break down cAMP (increasing cellular cAMP levels and blocking the platelet aggregation, response to ADP) and/or cGMP.
* Dipyridamole inhibits the cellular reuptake of adenosine into platelets, red blood cells, and endothelial cells, leading to increased extracellular concentrations of adenosine.

<doc id="1063759" wikidata="Q1754827" url="?curid=1063759" title="Socialism and Liberty Party">
<text>The Socialism and Liberty Party (, ; PSOL ) is a left-wing political party in Brazil. The party describes itself as socialist and democratic.

The party leader is Juliano Medeiros and the federal deputies Ivan Valente, Talíria Petrone, Sâmia Bomfim, Fernanda Melchionna, Glauber Braga, Luiza Erundina, Erika Hilton, Chico Alencar, Célia Xakriabá, Guilherme Boulos, Pastor Henrique Vieira, Tarcísio Motta and Luciene Cavalcante, besides the mayor of Belém Edmilson Rodrigues and the minister of the Native People Sônia Guajajara, with a number of well-known Brazilian left-wing leaders and intellectuals, such as , Hamilton Assis, Michael Löwy, Luciana Genro, Vladimir Safatle, , , , , João Machado, and others.

PSOL was formed after Heloísa Helena, Luciana Genro, Babá and João Fontes were expelled from the Workers&#x27; Party after voting against the pension reform proposed by Lula. They opposed the decisions of Lula&#x27;s government, considering them to be too conservative, and the Workers&#x27; Party alliances with controversial right-wing politicians, such as the former presidents José Sarney and Fernando Collor.

After collecting more than 438,000 signatures, PSOL became Brazil&#x27;s 29th officially recognized political party, the first to do so by this method.

==Ideology and support==
The ideology of the party varies between the left and the far left. The programmatic elements found in the party are related to socialism, anti-capitalism, and anti-imperialism. There are Marxist, Trotskyist, eco-socialist, and labor unionism tendencies within the party. Among other things, the party program includes the reduction of working hours, agrarian and urban reform, increased spending on health, education and infrastructure, and a break with the International Monetary Fund. It also seeks to decriminalize abortion. Because it is a party formed by trends that possess the political spectrum of the left in common, they represent distinct divisions in question of origin, geographical location and composition of its leaderships. The formation of tendencies provided for in the party statute can be freely organized without direct interference from the party leadership, allowing autonomy of intra-party groups, provided they follow the political prerogatives of the party&#x27;s statute and program.

===Internal tendencies===
PSOL also allows certain unregistered political parties to launch candidates through its TSE registry number. These organizations, however, cannot participate in the party&#x27;s congresses. This is some organization that used PSOL electoral legend in some moment:
==Members of the National Congress==
&quot;As of October 2023.&quot;
===Federal Deputies===
===State Deputies===
===Mayors===
Clécio Luís, Mayor of Macapá, left the party to join Sustainability Network.

==Elections==
===2006===
PSOL launched Heloísa Helena to run for president in 2006 elections. The vice-presidential candidate was intellectual . The party ran in a left-wing ticket along with two other parties: Trotskyist United Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSTU) and Marxist–Leninist Brazilian Communist Party (PCB).

The alliance was extended to gubernatorial elections. In Minas Gerais, for instance, Vanessa Portugal, from the PSTU, ran for governor with PSOL&#x27;s support, although not with PCB&#x27;s. Prominent PSOL gubernatorial candidates were Plínio de Arruda Sampaio in São Paulo, in Rio de Janeiro and Roberto Robaina in Rio Grande do Sul. However, they were all defeated.

Heloísa Helena finished the presidential race in the third place, receiving 6.5 million votes throughout the country (6.85% of the valid votes). Three federal deputies, Luciana Genro, Chico Alencar and Ivan Valente, managed to get re-elected.

===2010===
In the 2010 candidate for presidential election Plínio de Arruda Sampaio received 888.000 votes (0.87%). Plinio presented an agrarian reform project in 1964 when he was federal deputy, but the 1964 Military Coup ended the project and Plinio lost his mandate. Although he received very few votes Plinio became famous after the elections because he was qualified as an anti-candidate.

PSOL elected three deputies again, Chico Alencar, Ivan Valente and Jean Wyllys.

Toninho do PSOL from Federal District got the best gubernatorial result. He finished in third place with 14.25%.

===2012===
In 2012 PSOL got its best results so far. Clecio Luis and Gelsimar Gonzaga were elected mayors in Macapá, Amapá&#x27;s state capital, and Itaocara.

In the northern second largest city Belém and in Rio de Janeiro, PSOL finished second and elected four city councillors – the second largest group in those councils. In Belem Edmilson Rodrigues got 43.39% and in Rio de Janeiro Marcelo Freixo got 28.15%, almost 1 million votes.

Other places like São Paulo, Fortaleza, Campinas, Belo Horizonte, Curitiba, Salvador, Natal, Florianópolis, Niterói, São Gonçalo and Pelotas, PSOL got respectable results in 2012, 49 city councillors from PSOL were elected.

===2014===
PSOL initially nominated Randolfe Rodrigues, the Senator for Amapá, as their candidate for President in 2014, with former federal deputy and party co-founder Luciana Genro as his running mate. Federal deputy Chico Alencar of Rio de Janeiro and attorney also ran for the party&#x27;s nomination. However, he was replaced at the top of the ticket by Genro, a member of the Left Socialist Movement faction. She got 1,612,186 votes finishing in 4th place.

Genro&#x27;s campaign received the support of important Brazilian intellectuals and celebrities. These included like Chico de Oliveira, Rogério Arantes, Vladimir Safatle, Michel Löwy, Gregorio Duvivier, Valesca Popozuda, Zélia Duncan, Karina Buhr, Clara Averbuck, Marina Lima, Juca Kfouri, Preta Gil, Laerte Coutinho, Marcelo Yuka and the international popstar Jessica Sutta. Her candidacy was well-regarded in the LGBT community.

PSOL elected 5 federal deputies and 12 state deputies. Marcelo Freixo (RJ) received the highest vote for a state deputy in Brazil with 350,408 votes. Carlos Giannazi was the leftist most voted in São Paulo with 164,929 votes.

Gubernatorial candidates Tarcísio Motta (RJ) with 8.92% (14.62% in city of Rio Janeiro) and Robério Paulino (RN) with 8.74% (22.45% in capital Natal) got excellent results. Senate candidate Heloísa Helena (AL) got 31.86%, but she lost the election to former Brazilian president Fernando Collor de Mello, who was impeached.

===2018===
In 2018, PSOL chose prolific labor leader Guilherme Boulos as their nominee for the presidency. Boulos&#x27;s close affiliation with former President Lula led to concern that his nomination would erode PSOL&#x27;s distinct identity. It was alleged that party leadership pushed Boulos at the expense of other pre-candidates for the party&#x27;s nomination, including economist (and son of 2010 presidential nominee Plínio de Arruda Sampaio) Plínio de Arruda Sampaio Jr., activist and educator Hamilton Assis, and academic Nildo Ouriques. Indigenous leader Sônia Guajajara, who initially sought the party&#x27;s nomination, was chosen to serve as his vice presidential running mate.

===2022===
On 30 April, PSOL made official its support for the pre-candidacy of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) for the presidency. The party approved its support during electoral conference. On the 7 May, PT made official the pre-candidacy of ex-president Lula and ex-governor of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin (PSB) to run for president. In June, a group of PSOL affiliates created a dissident movement of the party in protest against the support to the pre-candidacy of former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) and former governor Geraldo Alckmin (PSB) for the presidency.

<doc id="1063761" wikidata="Q2634813" url="?curid=1063761" title="Jonathan Clements">
<text>Jonathan Michael Clements (born 9 July 1971) is a British author and scriptwriter. His non-fiction works include biographies of Confucius, Koxinga and Qin Shi Huang, as well as monthly opinion columns for &quot;Neo&quot; magazine. He is also the co-author of encyclopedias of anime and Japanese television dramas.

== Background ==
Clements speaks both Chinese and Japanese, and many of his works relate to East Asia. He wrote his Master&#x27;s degree at the University of Stirling on manga and anime exports, predicting the rise of several trends in the international industry including back-to-front printing, direct American investment in anime, and the proliferation of attempts to substitute non-Japanese products. Subsequently, he translated over 70 anime and manga works for British distributors, and worked as a voice director and actor. He wrote his PhD at the University of Wales on the industrial history of Japanese animation, later published by the British Film Institute as &quot;Anime: A History&quot;.

He served two years at Titan Books in London as the editor of &quot;Manga Max&quot; magazine, an experience he would later fictionalise as the Judge Dredd adventure &quot;Trapped on Titan&quot;. In 2000, he received the Japan Festival Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Understanding of Japanese Culture, specifically for his work on &quot;Manga Max&quot;.

== Broadcast work ==
Shortly after leaving the editorship of &quot;Manga Max&quot; magazine, he became a presenter on the Sci-Fi Channel&#x27;s Japan-themed magazine show &quot;Saiko Exciting&quot;. He has been a consultant and talking head on numerous TV shows, including &quot;New Secrets of the Terracotta Warriors&quot; (Channel 4), &quot;Koxinga: Sailing into History&quot; (National Geographic), &quot;China&#x27;s Jade Empire&quot; (Channel 4), and &quot;Chinese Chariot Revealed&quot; (PBS). In 2016, he became the presenter of three seasons of &quot;Route Awakening&quot; (National Geographic Asia), a series investigating the origins of several key Chinese cultural icons.

In 2019, he appeared on &quot;Christmas University Challenge&quot; as a member of the winning Leeds University team, alongside Henry Gee and Timothy Allen, captained by Richard Coles.

== Script work ==
Although Clements has written a couple of novels, much of his fiction work is CD audio drama or radio under the auspices of Big Finish Productions, including the &quot;Strontium Dog&quot; series, starring Simon Pegg, and the Doctor Who spin-off &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, starring David Warner and David Tennant.

His most famous work, &quot;Schoolgirl Milky Crisis&quot;, was the name for a fictional TV series that Clements often used in his &quot;Newtype USA&quot; columns in order to avoid breaking various non-disclosure agreements regarding real titles that he had worked on as a writer, director or translator. The name was later used as the title to a collection of Clements&#x27;s articles and speeches.

== Books ==
Clements&#x27;s many non-fiction publications, on subjects ranging from the history of the Vikings to the life of Chairman Mao Tse-tung, serve as research for his fiction.

<doc id="1063762" wikidata="Q76583" url="?curid=1063762" title="Eugen Dühring">
<text>Eugen Karl Dühring (; 12 January 1833 – 21 September 1921) was an antisemitic, positivist and socialist German philosopher and economist who was a strong critic of Marxism.

== Life and works ==
Dühring was born in Berlin, Prussia. After a legal education he practised law in Berlin until 1859. A weakness of the eyes, ending in total blindness, led him to take up the studies with which his name is now connected. In 1864, he became docent of the University of Berlin, but, in consequence of a quarrel with the professoriate, was deprived of his licence to teach in 1874.

Among his works are (1865); (1865); (1865); (1869); (1872), one of his most successful works; (1873); (1875), entitled in a later edition ; (1878); and (1883). He also published (1881, &quot;The Jewish Question as a Racial, Moral, and Cultural Question&quot;).

He published his autobiography in 1882 under the title ; the mention of (&#x27;enemies&#x27;) is characteristic. Dühring&#x27;s philosophy claims to be emphatically the philosophy of reality. He is passionate in his denunciation of everything which, like mysticism, tries to veil reality. He is, in the words of historian Carlton J. H. Hayes &quot;almost Lucretian in his anger against religion&quot; which would withdraw the secret of the universe from our direct gaze. His substitute for religion is a doctrine in many points akin to Auguste Comte and Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach, the former of whom he resembles in his sentimentalism.

Dühring&#x27;s economic views are said to derive largely from those of Friedrich List. On other matters, particularly their attitudes toward Jews, the two men held very different opinions.

== Thought ==
He was &quot;deeply&quot; influenced by Schopenhauer throughout his career. Dühring&#x27;s opinions changed considerably after his first appearance as a writer. His earlier work, (&quot;Natural Dialectics&quot;), is entirely in the spirit of critical philosophy. Later, in his movement towards positivism, beginning with the publication of (&quot;Critical History of Philosophy&quot;), he rejects Immanuel Kant&#x27;s separation of phenomenon from noumenon and claims that our intellect is capable of grasping the whole reality. This adequacy of thought to things is because the universe contains but one reality, i.e. matter. It is to matter that we must look for the explanation both of conscious and of physical states. But matter is not, in his system, to be understood with the common meaning, but with a deeper sense as the substratum of all conscious and physical existence; and thus the laws of being are identified with the laws of thought. In this idealistic system Dühring finds room for teleology. The end of nature, he holds, is the production of a race of conscious beings. From his belief in teleology he is not deterred by the enigma of pain. As a determined optimist, he asserts that pain exists to throw pleasure into conscious relief.

In ethics, Dühring follows Auguste Comte in making sympathy the foundation of morality. In political philosophy, he teaches an ethical communism and attacks Herbert Spencer&#x27;s principle of Social Darwinism. In economics, he is best known by his vindication of the American writer H. C. Carey, who attracts him both by his theory of value, which suggests an ultimate harmony of the interests of capitalists and labourers; and also by his doctrine of national political economy, which advocates protection on the ground that the morals and culture of a people are promoted by having its whole system of industry complete within its own borders. His patriotism is fervent, but narrow and exclusive. He idolized Frederick the Great, and denounced Jews, Greeks, and the cosmopolitan Goethe. His writing has been characterized as clear and incisive, &quot;though disfigured by arrogance and ill-temper, failings which may be extenuated on the ground of his physical affliction&quot;.

Throughout his life, Dühring was a vehement antisemite and was one of the first proponents of racial antisemitism in Germany. In 1881 Dühring&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Die Judenfrage als Racen-, Sitten- und Culturfrage (The Jewish Question as a Question of Race, Morals and Culture)&quot; was published. It was a pseudo-scientific attempt to give antisemitism as a political movement a biological, historical, and philosophical foundation. He described the &quot;Jewish question&quot; similarly to Wilhelm Marr, as an expression of an irresolvable racial antagonism, and openly advocated for the &quot;murder and extermination&quot; of Jews as a solution to the Jewish question.

== Legacy ==

He is chiefly remembered among English-speakers because of Engels&#x27; criticism of his views in : Herr Eugen Dühring&#x27;s Revolution in Science. Engels wrote his in opposition to Dühring&#x27;s ideas, which had found some disciples among the German Social Democrats. He is also the most prominent representative of the socialism of that era attacked by Nietzsche in his later works. Most of Dühring&#x27;s work remains unavailable in English, aside from his work on the Jewish question. Dühring&#x27;s writing on the Jewish question influenced later antisemites and racist thinkers such as Theodor Fritsch&quot;,&quot; Houston Stewart Chamberlain and Georg von Schönerer. Through this legacy, Dühring&#x27;s antisemitic views later found their way into the racial doctrines of Nazism. 

Friedrich Nietzsche heavily criticized Dühring&#x27;s opinions on morality in his work On the Genealogy of Morality:

I again remind readers who have ears to hear of that apostle of revenge from Berlin, Eugen Dühring, who makes the most indecent and disgusting use of moral clap-trap of anyone in Germany today: Dühring, today&#x27;s biggest loudmouth of morality, even amongst his kind, the anti-Semites.

&quot;Heroic materialism&quot; characterised Dühring&#x27;s philosophy. He attacked capitalism, Marxism, and organised Christianity and Judaism. Many scholars believe that Dühring&#x27;s invention of a modern-sounding antisemitism helped persuade Theodor Herzl that Zionism was the only answer:

<doc id="1063775" wikidata="Q1395356" url="?curid=1063775" title="Leonel Brizola">
<text>Leonel de Moura Brizola (22 January 1922 – 21 June 2004) was a Brazilian politician. Launched into politics by Brazilian president Getúlio Vargas in the 1930–1950s, Brizola was the only politician to serve as elected governor of two Brazilian states. An engineer by training, Brizola organized the youth wing of the Brazilian Labour Party and served as state representative for Rio Grande do Sul and mayor of its capital, Porto Alegre. 

In 1958 he was elected governor of Rio Grande do Sul and subsequently played a major role in thwarting a first coup attempt by sectors of the armed forces, who wished to prevent João Goulart from assuming the presidency following the resignation of Jânio Quadros in August 1961, under allegations of communist ties. Three years later, facing the 1964 Brazilian coup d&#x27;état that went on to install the Brazilian military dictatorship, Brizola called on the democratic forces to resist, but Goulart did not want to risk a civil war, and Brizola was exiled in Uruguay.

One of the few Brazilian major political figures able to overcome the dictatorship&#x27;s twenty-years ban on his political activity, Brizola returned to Brazil in 1979, but failed in his bid to take control of the reemerging Brazilian Labour Party as the military government instead conceded it to Ivete Vargas. Brizola founded the Democratic Labour Party on a democratic socialist, nationalist and populist platform descended from Getúlio Vargas&#x27; own labour legacy, promoted as an ideology he called &quot;socialismo moreno&quot; (&quot;tanned socialism&quot;), a non-Marxist, Christian and markedly Brazilian left-wing political agenda for a post-Cold War setting. 

In 1982 and 1990 Brizola was elected governor of Rio de Janeiro, after a failed 1989 bid for the presidency, in which he narrowly finished third, after Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In the 1990s, Brizola disputed for preeminence in the Brazilian left with future president Lula Workers&#x27; Party, later briefly integrating Lula&#x27;s government in the early 2000s. He was also vice-president of the Socialist International and served as Honorary President of that organization from October 2003 until his death in June 2004. Known for his sharp, energetic rhetoric and frank, direct style, Brizola is considered one of the most important historic figures of the Brazilian left.

== Early life and rise to prominence (1922–1964) ==

Brizola&#x27;s father José Brizola was a small-scale farmer who was killed when fighting as a volunteer in 1923 in a local civil war for the rebel leader Assis Brasil against Rio Grande do Sul&#x27;s governor Borges de Medeiros. Brizola was named Itagiba, but early in life he adopted the alias Leonel, which he took from the rebel warlord Leonel Rocha who had commanded the cavalry column in which José Brizola served. Brizola left his mother&#x27;s house at the age of eleven; he worked in Passo Fundo and Carazinho as a newspaper deliverer, shoeshiner and at other occasional jobs. Aided by the family of a Methodist minister, he received a scholarship that allowed him to complete high school in Porto Alegre and enter college. 

He graduated with a degree in engineering but never worked in that trade. Still as an undergraduate, he entered professional politics in his early twenties, joining the youth organization of the Brazilian Labor Party (&quot;Partido Trabalhista Brasileiro&quot; (PTB)) in 1945. In 1946 an undergraduate, he was elected to the Rio Grande State Legislature. The Labor Party had been created in order to offer political support for former president Getúlio Vargas among the working classes, and Brizola, who was busy with creating party organizations across Rio Grande do Sul, at the time developed ties to the Vargas family through his personal friendship with Vargas&#x27;s son Maneco as well as with Vargas&#x27;s brother Espartaco, such friendships opening his way to make friends with Vargas himself, who was in internal exile after having been toppled from power in late 1945. As a member of the State Legislature, Brizola made a speech from the tribune in which he launched nationwide the candidacy of Vargas to the incoming 1950 presidential elections.

In 1950, Brizola married Neusa Goulart—João Goulart&#x27;s sister—and had Vargas as his best man. Through this marriage, Brizola became a wealthy landowner and a regional leader of the PTB. After Vargas&#x27;s 1954 suicide during his second presidential term, Brizola inherited the undisputed regional leadership of his party while his brother-in-law ruled the PTB national caucus. Both perpetuated Vargas&#x27; populist tradition; in Brizola&#x27;s case, the practice of a direct personal link between charismatic leader and the general public. In quick succession, Brizola filled various positions, being a member of the Rio Grande State Legislature for two terms (and as such leader for the PTB), State Secretary for Public Works, (interim) Federal Congressman for Rio Grande in 1955 and Mayor of Porto Alegre from 1956 to 1958. In 1958 he would resign from his mayoralty in order to present himself as a contender at the elections for State Governor. From a regional leadership, Brizola would then ascend, during the presidency of Goulart (1961–1964) to the role of an important national supporter of his brother-in-law; first as governor and later as a deputy in the National Congress of Brazil.

As governor of Rio Grande do Sul (1959–63), Brizola rose to prominence for his social policies that included the quick building of public schools in poor neighborhoods across the state (&quot;brizoletas&quot;). He supported policies directed towards improving the conditions of small-scale, autonomous farmers and landless rural workers, and the sponsorship of the creation of the corporation MASTER (Rio Grande Landless Rural Workers Movement).

Brizola gained nationwide attention by acting in defense of democracy and Goulart&#x27;s rights as president. When Jânio Quadros resigned from the presidency in August 1961, the Brazilian military ministers in the Cabinet tried to prevent Vice-President Goulart from becoming president on the grounds of his alleged ties with the Communist movement. After winning support from local army commander general Machado Lopes, Brizola forged the &quot;cadeia da legalidade&quot; (legality broadcast) from a pool of radio stations in Rio Grande do Sul, which issued a nationwide call from the Piratini Palace denouncing the intentions behind the Cabinet ministers&#x27; actions and encouraging common citizens to protest in the streets. Brizola surrendered the State Police Force to the regional army command and began organizing paramilitary Committees of Democratic Resistance, and considered handing out firearms to civilians. After twelve days of impending civil war, the attempted coup failed and Goulart was inaugurated as president.

===Nationalizations of industrial utilities in Rio Grande and Cold War politics===

Brizola gained international attention for his nationalist policies; as governor he developed his plan for quick industrialization of the state, a program for the constitution of state-owned industrial utilities, that led him to nationalize American public utilities trusts&#x27; assets in Rio Grande, such as ITT and Electric Bond &amp; Share (local branch of American &amp; Foreign Power Company (Amforp for short), itself owned by the holding Electric Bond and Share Company ).

At the time as well as later, many scholars believed such nationalizations to express socialist policy. However, the reason offered by Brizola for the nationalization - in fact almost an expropriation, as the compensation given was of only one monetary unit, pending settlement by a Brazilian court- was simply that both American enterprises, although profiting from previously existing infrastructures, nevertheless supplied limited quantities of utilities at the highest possible rates to final consumers and reinvested a tiny fraction of their profits, the remaining &quot;excess&quot; profits being &quot;repatriated&quot;.Therefore, these foreign contractors were considered by Brizola as unreliable for playing a role as tools in a longterm blueprint for industrialization. Earlier, Brizola had offered ITT to participate in a new mixed, state-private ownership telephone company, which would be financed through the selling of new shares to the State of Rio Grande as well as to the general public - in this new company, ITT would remain with a 25% share. As Leacock writes, this proposal probably failed because ITT CEOs didn&#x27;t want to participate in a joint venture they would not control. That Brizola&#x27;s avowedly reasons corresponded to his actual goals is supported by a later American scholar, who considers that Brizola&#x27;s administration, albeit &quot;marred&quot; by these &quot;controversial&quot; nationalizations, was nevertheless &quot;vigorous and constructive&quot;. Other American scholar remembers that the same rightist military government that would later exile Brizola found it necessary to nationalize the &quot;entire&quot; Brazilian telecommunications system in other to develop necessary infrastructures.

Of the two major American contractors involved in Brizola&#x27;s nationalization, Amforp was far more accommodating; it had been operating at a loss in Brazil and was confident of striking a deal with the Federal government -i.e. Goulart - in order to close its Brazilian operation. ITT had been also operating at a loss; nevertheless, as it had already been taken by surprise by the expropriation of its property in Cuba by Fidel Castro, the nationalization of its Brazilian operation - no matter how unprofitable - was seem by it as something that could set a precedent to the whole of Latin America.Therefore, the fact that ITT decided to enlist for support from Washington

The Brizola nationalizations became headline news in the American press when the John F. Kennedy administration was trying to counter the &quot;Communist infiltration&quot; in Brazil by striking a deal with Goulart that included U.S. financial aid to the Brazilian federal government. In this context, Brizola&#x27;s actions became a diplomatic embarrassment, which turned Brizola&#x27;s State government into an intended target of the Hickenlooper Amendment. Goulart gave in to American pressure on the issue, accepting to pay what the Left considered excessive compensations to both ITT &amp; Amforp in exchange for financial aid, Brizola presented his in-law as a defector from the nationalist cause.

Through his domestic and foreign politics, Brizola became a major player in Brazilian politics, eventually developing presidential aspirations he could not legally fulfill at the time; Brazilian law did not allow close relatives of the acting President to stand for the following term of office. Between 1961 and 1964, Brizola acted as the radical wing of the independent left, where he pressured the office for an agenda of radical social and political reforms and for a change in the electoral legislation that allowed for his presidential candidacy in 1965. He was seen as personally authoritarian and quarrelsome, and capable of dealing with his enemies using physical aggression; for example he hit rightwing journalist David Nasser at Rio de Janeiro airport. Brizola acted as an adventurer in the political game around the Goulart government, being feared and hated by the political moderate Left and Right. This role was especially visible when Brizola moved his constituency from Rio Grande do Sul to a national political center, winning a landslide victory (269,384 ballots or a quarter of the State&#x27;s electorate) in the 1962 election to Congress as a representative for the State of Guanabara—the Rio de Janeiro municipality reorganized as a city-state after the national capital had been moved to Brasilia. A layer of lore quickly developed around Brizola&#x27;s efforts to &quot;steal&quot; his brother-in-law&#x27;s Goulart &quot;political thunder&quot;.

===Radical leadership and friction with Goulart (1963–1964)===
Goulart had been sworn as President in 1961 by means of a compromise, in which he was head of State in a parliamentary system. On 6 January 1963, however, a plebiscite scheduled earlier restored Goulart to the position of head of government and extinguished the cabinet. At the same time, in a move to vye with Goulart for political leadership, Brizola started a weekly Friday talkshow on the Rio radio broadcast Mayrink Veiga that was owned by Congressman from São Paulo State Miguel Leuzzi, which he used to broadcast nationwide, and planned to constitute a network of political cells composed of small groups of armed men; the &quot;elevensome&quot; &quot;Grupos de Onze&quot;—paramilitary parties modeled on a soccer team. These were supposed to act as grassroots organizations that would &quot;defend and diffuse&quot; the chief points of a reformist agenda that would have to be achieved &quot;by hook or by crook&quot; (&quot;na lei ou na marra&quot;). Brizola&#x27;s using of metaphors from the world of soccer was one of the instances of his apt rhetoric, that rendered him at the time a master of the broadcasts. So apt, actually, as to make the whole of contemporary political specter to fear his bid at preeminence: in the words of a contemporary journalist, &quot;Brizola was willing to pay any price to retain the ball&quot; (&quot;ser o dono da bola&quot;).

Brizola&#x27;s posturing and rhetoric seemed to justify the classification developed by Goulart&#x27;s Foreign Minister and leader of the moderate left, San Tiago Dantas: Brizola was a paragon of a &quot;negative left&quot; which, in its uncompromising, ideological defense of social reform, forsook any compromise with democratic institutions. Dantas&#x27; aversion to Brizola was reciprocated: Dantas and Goulart&#x27;s War Minister General Amaury Kruel and Commerce Minister Antônio Balbino formed an &quot;anti-reformist tripod&quot; of &quot;traitors to the national interests&quot;. Dantas, who negotiated the 1963 U.S.-Brazil financial agreement, had been received in Washington &quot;more like a head of state than a minister of finance&quot;, and expected to be greeted at his homecoming &quot;with appreciation if not fanfare&quot;; a hope Brizola quickly dashed with &quot;venomous attacks&quot;.

Notwithstanding his alleged radicalism, Brizola was not an ideologue or doctrinaire. Generally, he stood for an extreme Left Nationalism; land reform, extension of the franchise for illiterates and NCOs; and for tight controls over foreign investment that caused the American ambassador to Brazil, Lincoln Gordon, to dislike Brizola and compare his propaganda techniques with those of Joseph Goebbels; a mood mirrored by most of contemporary American media. Many contemporary American intellectuals also disliked Brizola; John dos Passos said Brizola tried to &quot;starve&quot; Rio de Janeiro by retaining rice consignments from Rio Grande do Sul during his governorship.

In late 1963, after the failure of a conservative plan of economic adjustment (&quot;Plano Trienal&quot;) devised by the Ministry of Planning Celso Furtado, Brizola involved himself in a bid for power by toppling Goulart&#x27;s economically conservative Minister of Finance Carvalho Pinto to take the post himself. Brizola wanted to foster his radical agenda, saying, &quot;if we want to make a revolution, we must have the key to the safe&quot;. Brizola&#x27;s bid for the Ministry failed; the post was given to an unpolitical Banco do Brasil CEO. This helped radicalize contemporaneous Brazilian political life; the country&#x27;s most politically conservative newspaper &quot;O Globo&quot; said it was as though &quot;the task of putting down the fire fell to the chief arsonist&quot;. During late 1963 and early 1964, a division between Brizola and his brother-in-law opened; Brizola became convinced that Goulart intended to stage a coup backed by loyalist military commanders, to stop the ongoing process of political radicalization, and that the only way to pre-empt Goulart&#x27;s move was a grassroots revolutionary movement.

According to many authors, Brizola&#x27;s uncompromising radicalism denied his brother-in-law&#x27;s government the ability to &quot;compromise and conciliate&quot; and to adopt a feasible reformist agenda. According to American scholar Alfred Stepan, Brizola&#x27;s &quot;rhetoric of resentment&quot; gained Goulart a few supporters, but also many powerful and strategically located foes - as was the case when Brizola, out of a public rostrum, called a commanding general, to his face, a &quot;gorilla&quot;. Some say Brizola&#x27;s reasons for this were egotistical; according to Rose, &quot;Leonel Brizola was concerned only with Leonel Brizola&quot;. Other authors say Brizola advocated a reformist agenda centered on concrete issues (land reform, extension of the franchise, foreign capital controls), whose acceptance was regarded as unbearable and indigestible by the ruling classes and their international allies, and whose deployment was foreign to the contemporaneous political system. In a March 1964 State Department telegram sent to the American ambassador in Brazil, U.S. support of the incoming military coup was equated with denying Goulart and Brizola a position of democratic legitimacy that allowed them to adopt their &quot;extremist&quot; plans. Some earlier American policymakers had expressed their repugnance at the prospect of supporting Goulart&#x27;s agenda of reforms as &quot;an attempt to force the US to finance an inimical regime&quot;. According to José Murilo de Carvalho, Brizola&#x27;s aggressive stance towards the reforming process was more coherent than Goulart&#x27;s, who supported a reformist agenda but eschewed the necessary use of force to foster it. Goulart&#x27;s ambivalence towards his in-law did not win him any international support: U.S. Ambassador Lincoln Gordon regarded Goulart as an opportunist who was &quot;mesmerized&quot; by Brizola.

==Exile and return (1964–1979)==
In April 1964, a coup d&#x27;état overthrew Goulart. Brizola was the only political leader to support for the president, sheltering him in Porto Alegre and hoping a bid to rouse the local army units towards the restoration of the toppled régime could be made. Brizola engaged himself in schemes to confront the military putschists, including giving a fiery public speech at the Porto Alegre City Hall, exhorting army NCOs to &quot;occupy barracks and arrest the generals&quot;, which earned him the lasting hatred of the dictatorship&#x27;s military commanders. After an unsuccessful month in Rio Grande, Brizola fled in early May 1964 to Uruguay, where Goulart was already in exile after offering little support to Brizola&#x27;s attempts at armed resistance.

As a political loner during his early Uruguayan exile, Brizola eventually preferred insurrectionist politics to reformism, and appeared to be a belated revolutionary leader. In early 1965, a group of Brizola&#x27;s sympathizers—mostly Army NCOs— tried and failed to articulate a theater of guerrilla warfare in the Eastern Brazilian mountains around Caparaó, which was only underground military training that was suppressed without incident. Another group of &quot;Brizolista&quot; guerrillas dispersed after a shoot-out with the army in Southern Brazil. This event raised suspicions about Brizola&#x27;s mis-management of funds offered to him by Fidel Castro. Except for this episode, Brizola spent the first ten years of the Brazilian military dictatorship mostly alone in Uruguay, where he managed his wife&#x27;s landed property and kept abreast of domestic news from various opposition movements in Brazil. He rejected attempts at being recruited into the &quot;Frente Ampla&quot; (Broad Front), a mid-1960s informal caucus of pre-dictatorship leaders intent on pressuring for re-democratization, which included Carlos Lacerda and Juscelino Kubitschek. Brizola broke the few remaining ties with his brother-in-law and fellow exile, João Goulart, over the attempted recruitment.

===U.S. rescue from Uruguay, exile in the U.S. and Europe (1977–1979)===

Since the beginning of his exile, Brizola had been closely watched by Brazilian intelligence, who pressured the Uruguayan government on a regular basis. In the late 1970s, nevertheless, the emergence of a military dictatorship in Uruguay allowed the Brazilian government to work together with the Uruguayan military to seize Brizola as part of Operation Condor, the cooperation between Latin American dictatorships for hounding leftist opponents.

Until the late 1970s, American intelligence had helped the efforts of the Latin American dictatorships to keep a check on Brizola: the 1960s Brazilian ambassador in Uruguay was later outed by Philip Agee as a CIA operative. Brizola may have survived his exile because US Latin American policy had meanwhile changed, with the efforts of the Jimmy Carter administration to curb human rights abuses. This intervention, for which Brizola held a lifelong gratitude to Carter. amounted to a sharp change in Brizola&#x27;s politics, to the immediate disapproval of his leftist friends: the filmmaker Glauber Rocha said Brizola had made friends with &quot;Carter, the Van Johnson of politics&quot;.

Between late 1976 and early 1977, the fact that all three most prominent members of the &quot;Frente Ampla&quot; - Juscelino Kubitscheck, João Goulart himself and Carlos Lacerda - had all died in succession and in somewhat mysterious circumstances, made Brizola feel increasingly threatened in Uruguay. Faced with impending withdrawal of his asylum, he sought the American Embassy In Uruguay, where he held talks with political counselor John Youle. Youle, over the opposition of Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Terence Todman, granted Brizola a transit visa that allowed Brizola, who in mid-1977 was deported from Uruguay for alleged &quot;violations of norms of political asylum&quot;, to travel to—and eventually be given immediate asylum in—the United States.

Brizola&#x27;s rescue from Uruguay is acknowledged as one of the successes of Carter&#x27;s Human Rights rhetoric. It was typical of Brizola&#x27;s political pragmatism and was shunned, again, by Glauber Rocha as &quot;a demonstration of cultural colonization&quot;. After his rescue by Carter, Brizola would not directly oppose American policies towards Brazil, contenting himself with denouncing vague &quot;international losses&quot; incurred by Brazil through unfair terms of exchange imposed by multinational corporations.

According to recent declassified Brazilian diplomatic documents, on 20 September 1977, on the way to the U.S., Brizola and his wife went to Buenos Aires, a dangerous place for Latin American exiles. The Brizolas were followed by American CIA agents and stayed overnight in a CIA safe house and boarded a nonstop flight to New York City on 22 September. Shortly after arriving in New York, Brizola met with U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy, who helped gain Brizola permission to stay in the U.S. for six months. From a suite at the Roosevelt Hotel, Brizola profited from his American stay by organizing a network of contacts with Brazilian exiles and American academics interested in ending military rule in Brazil.

Later, Brizola moved to Portugal, where, through Mario Soares, he approached the Socialist International leadership and sided with a Social-Democratic, reformist plan for post-dictatorship Brazil. During his time in the U.S., Brizola was contacted by Afro-Brazilian activist Abdias do Nascimento, and became acquainted with identity politics, which would influence his post-dictatorship career. In a political manifesto launched in Lisbon—the &quot;Charter of Lisbon&quot; that stated his intention of re-founding a Labor Party in Brazil—Brizola adhered to race politics by stating that Blacks and Native Brazilians suffered from more unjust and painful forms of exploitation than regular class exploitation and needed special measures that addressed their plights. Other identity groups were sought for special attention; Northeastern Brazilians, marginalized children and females in general— which made the intended party appear to be vying for mass appeal rather than a core trade unionist base. That was a break with the usual introspection of Brazilian party politics, although Brizola remained attached to the &quot;quintessentially Brazilian&quot; Vargoist tradition.

In the late 1970s. the Brazilian military dictatorship was waning; in 1978, passports were quietly given to prominent political exiles but Brizola, alongside a core group of alleged radicals described as &quot;public enemy number one&quot;, remained blacklisted and was refused the right of return. In 1979, after a general amnesty, his exile came to an end.

==Late &quot;Brizolismo&quot; (1979–1989)==

Brizola returned to Brazil with the intention of restoring the Brazilian Labour Party as a radical, nationalist, left-wing, mass movement and as a confederacy of historical Getulist leaders. He was hampered in this by the emergence of new grassroots movements, such as the new trade unionism centered around the São Paulo metalworkers and their leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and the Catholic grassroots organizations of the rural poor spawned by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (CNBB). Brizola was denied the right to use the historical name of the Brazilian Labour Party, previously conceded to a rival group centered around a military dictatorship-friendly figure, Congresswoman Ivete Vargas—the grand-niece of Getúlio Vargas. Instead, Brizola
founded an entirely new party, the Democratic Labour Party (Partido Democrático Trabalhista, PDT). The party joined the Socialist International in 1986, and since then the party symbol has been the fist and rose, the emblem of the SI and of a number of its member parties.

Brizola quickly restored his political prominence in Rio Grande do Sul and gained political pre-eminence in the State of Rio de Janeiro, where he sought a new basis of political support. Instead of associating himself with the organized working class—either by means of corporatist trade unionism or by vying with Lula and the WP for the support of the new trade unionism—Brizola sought a basis of support among the unorganized urban poor by means of an ideological tie-in between traditional radical nationalism and a charismatic lumpen-friendly populism, in what one scholar called &quot;the aesthetics of the ugly&quot;. For his opponents, Brizola and his &quot;Brizolismo&quot; stood for shady deals with the &quot;dangerous&quot;, resentful, &quot;overrebellious&quot; underclasses; for his supporters, they stood for the paternalistic empowerment of the destitute—the lowest, least organized and poorest of the working classes. According to Sento Sé, &quot;Politics, from a &quot;Brizolista&quot; viewpoint, is above all to assume a radical option for the poor and the meek&quot;.

Brizola shunned the class-based, corporatist character of his early populism and adopted a Christian rhetoric of friendship to the people in general—akin to the Russian narodniks than to classical Latin American populism. This new radical populism was seen as a threat to more orderly, liberal-democratic politics. It suffered from a lacking mastery of less personal mass politics techniques and required Brizola&#x27;s charismatic and personal leadership of Brizola to function effectively. In Brizola&#x27;s absence—or that of his persona—the PDT could not become a contender to power, hampering its development on the national level.

In 1982, Brizola stood for governor of the State of Rio de Janeiro in the first free, direct, gubernatorial elections in that state since 1965. He ran a ticket of candidates for Congress that tried to compensate for his party&#x27;s lack of cadres by offering a roster of people with no previous ties to professional politics, such as the Native Brazilian leader Mário Juruna, the singer Agnaldo Timóteo, and a sizeable number of Afro-Brazilian activists. He was aware that this last foray into race politics contradicted his previous, more conventionally radical policies. Brizola nicknamed his ideology &quot;Socialismo Moreno&quot; (&quot;Socialism of Color&quot; or &quot;mixed-race socialism&quot;). Brizola centered his personal campaign on issues such as education and public security, offering a candidacy that had clear, oppositional overtones and proposed to upheld the Vargoist legacy. By developing a nucleus of combative militants around himself—the so-called &quot;Brizolândia&quot;—Brizola led a campaign that melded violent confrontations and street brawls with a paradoxically festive mood, expressed by the motto &quot;Brizola na cabeça&quot;—a pun between &quot;Brizola at the head of the ticket&quot; and &quot;High on Brizola&quot;, &quot;brisola&quot; being a contemporary slang for a small parcel of cocaine.

To have his victory in the 1982 elections acknowledged, Brizola had to publicly denounce what the paper &quot;Jornal do Brasil&quot; described as an attempt at fraudulent accounting of the ballots by the private contractor Proconsult—a computer engineering firm owned by former military intelligence operatives—contracted by the electoral court to offer speedy electoral statistics. During the early ballot-counting process, Proconsult repeatedly supplied media with communiqués offering belated voting statistics from rural areas, where Brizola was at a disadvantage, which were immediately echoed by TV Globo. By denouncing this alleged fraud at press conferences, interviews, and public statements—which included a discussion with Globo CEO Armando Nogueira on live television— Brizola pre-empted the scheme of any chance of success, as official ballot numbers eventually gave him the lead.

Brizola then proceeded to keep and expanded his nationwide political visibility during his controversial first term as governor of Rio (1983–1987). He developed his early education policies on a grander scale with an ambitious programme of construction of large high-school buildings, the so-called CIEPs (&quot;Integrated Centers for Public Education&quot;) whose architect was Oscar Niemeyer. The schools were intended to be open all day, providing food and recreational activities to students. Brizola also developed policies for providing public services and recognized housing property for dwellers in shanty towns. Brizola opposed policies for shantytowns based on forcible resettlement to housing projects, and instead proposed—in the words of his chief adviser Darcy Ribeiro, that &quot;shanty towns are not part of the problem, but part of the solution&quot; - a &quot;bizarre&quot; solution, but nevertheless one that &quot;allowed shanty people to be near to their working places and live as a regular human community&quot;. Therefore, once property rights were acknowledged and basic infrastructure provided, it was up to the shanty town dwellers to find solutions to house-building problems.

Brizola also adopted a radical new policy for police action in the poor suburbs and favelas in the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area. Alleging old relations and modus operandi were founded on repression, conflict and disrespect, he ordered the state police to refrain from random raids in favelas and repressed the activities of vigilante death squads that included policemen on leave. The right opposed these policies, saying they made slums an open territory for organized crime represented by huge gangs like Comando Vermelho (&quot;Red Command&quot;), by means of a conflation between common criminality and leftism. It was alleged that gangs had originated through the association of convicted petty criminals and leftist political prisoners in the 1970s. Other scholars argue that this &quot;politicization&quot; of common crime had been the work of the military dictatorship, which, by incarcerating together common criminals and political prisoners, offered the former the opportunity to mimic the organization strategies of underground resistance groups.

Brizola&#x27;s policies included porkbarrel, poor management, personalism, wild spending of public funds, and displaying a tendency at opportunistic, short term solutions. They prepared him for the political gravitas required for running for president in 1989.

Amid the economic crisis and rampant inflation of 1980s Brazil, many conservative observers took Brizola as chief radical bogey—a throwback to 1960s populism. Brizola, as the left in general at the time, sought an accommodation with ruling elites by avoiding taking a firm position on issues such as land reform and nationalization of private banking systems, therefore qualifying for taking power through elections. From the viewpoint of mass electoral politics, it was during the 1989 presidential election Brizola&#x27;s charismatic leadership exposed its shortcomings when he finished the first run third, losing the second position that would have qualified him for a runoff, by a narrow margin to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, whose Workers&#x27; Party had the cadres, the professional activism and the penetration of the organized social movements that Brizola&#x27;s lacked. Fernando Collor de Mello was eventually elected in the runoff. Brizola carried the first-round elections regionally, winning huge majorities in Rio Grande do Sul and in Rio de Janeiro State, but only received 1.4% of the votes from São Paulo state. Lula used his stronghold in the most industrialized areas of the Southeast as a springboard and gathered new voters in the Northeast, where Brizola was practically a no-show candidate. Lula won the right to stand against Collor in the runoff elections, surpassing Brizola by a mere 0.6% of the electorate.

Brizola was a staunch supporter of Lula&#x27;s candidacy in the 1989 run-off elections, which he justified with a declaration before PDT cronies that became part of Brazilian political lore: &quot;I will be candid: a politician from the old school, Senator Pinheiro Machado once said that politics is the art of swallowing toads (&quot;engolir sapo&quot;). Wouldn&#x27;t that be fascinating to force-feed Brazilian élites and having them to swallow the Bearded Toad, Lula?&quot; Brizola&#x27;s support was crucial in increasing votes for Lula in Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul, where Lula passed from a first round 12.2% in Rio de Janeiro and 6.7% in Rio Grande to a second round 72.9% in Rio and 68.7% in Rio Grande.

==Political decline and death (1989–2004)==
After the 1989 election there were still chances Brizola could achieve his dream of winning the Presidency if he could overcome his party&#x27;s lack of national penetration. Some of his advisers proposed him a candidacy to the Senate in the ensuing 1990 elections, which could offer him national highlights. Brizola refused, preferring to present himself as a candidate to the gubernatorial elections in the same year, winning a second term as Governor of Rio de Janeiro by a first-round majority of 60.88% of all valid ballots. Brizola&#x27;s second term as Rio&#x27;s governor was a political failure, marked by instances of disorganized management caused by Brizola&#x27;s ultra-centralism and distaste for proper bureaucratic procedure and the support Brizola eventually offered to the Collor administration in exchange for funds for public works. Brizola was charged with collaborating with the embezzlement schemes that led to Collor&#x27;s 1992 impeachment.

Bereft of national support and forsaken by close associates such as Cesar Maia and Anthony Garotinho, who abandoned Brizola for the sake of their personal careers, Brizola again ran for president on the PDT&#x27;s ticket, amid the success of Minister of Finance and presidential candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso&#x27;s anti-inflation Plano Real. The 1994 presidential elections were a failure for Brizola, who scored fifth place. Cardoso was elected in the first round by an absolute majority. It was the end of &quot;Brizolismo&quot; as a national political force; some weeks before the election, a kiosk in downtown Rio de Janeiro where &quot;Brizolandia&quot; cronies met was demolished by City Hall officers and was never rebuilt. During Cardoso&#x27;s first term, Brizola remained a critic of his neoliberal policies of privatization of public companies, saying in 1995, &quot;if there is no civil reaction to privatization, there will be a military one&quot;. When Cardoso ran for re-election four years later, Brizola contented himself with a vice presidential candidacy on Lula&#x27;s ticket, and both lost to Cardoso.

In his final years, Brizola&#x27;s fractured relationship with Lula and the Workers&#x27; Party changed; he refused to support them in the first round of the 2002 presidential election, supporting instead the candidacy of Ciro Gomes for president, while contesting a seat in the Senate. Gomes finished third, Lula was elected president, and Brizola lost his bid for the Senate, bringing an end to his regional force. Brizola supported Lula in the second round of the 2002 election, therefore qualifying for joining with other pre-eminent political figures. He came to be regarded as a veteran of leftist popularism and a secondary character in his last two years. Despite supporting Lula at some periods during his first term, at his last public appearances, Brizola criticized him for what he termed neoliberalist policies and for neglecting traditional left-wing and workers&#x27; struggles. Brizola&#x27;s late comments on Lula took on a personal character. During May 2004, he was one of the sources for a Larry Rohter story on Lula&#x27;s alleged alcoholism; he told a &quot;New York Times&quot; correspondent about having advised Lula &quot;to get hold of this thing and control it&quot;.

Brizola died on 21 June 2004, after a heart attack. He planned to run for the presidency in 2006 and, although ailing, had just received his former associate Anthony Garotinho and his wife Rosinha Garotinho the day before.

On 29 December 2015, a congressional bill was approved by President Dilma Rousseff inscribing Brizola&#x27;s name in the Book of Heroes of the Motherland, the official registry of all deceased Brazilians &quot;who offered their lives to the Motherland, her defense and building, with exceptional commitment and heroism&quot;.

<text>Nelson de la Rosa Martínez (September 6, 1968 – October 22, 2006), Mahow, was a Dominican actor and one of the shortest men of the 20th and 21st centuries. Nelson measured 71 centimeters tall (about 2 feet 4 inches). His stature was caused by Seckel syndrome.

==Acting career==
De la Rosa starred in the 1987 feature Italian horror film made in Dominican Republic called &quot;Ratman&quot;. During the 1990s Nelson continued his path to international success by becoming a staple guest at Venevision&#x27;s television show &quot;Súper Sábado Sensacional&quot; in Venezuela, and, later on, he would be invited as a guest to Don Francisco&#x27;s show, &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot;, and to other Univision shows. His popularity took him to other Hispanic countries such as Argentina, where he featured several times in Susana Giménez show, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Spain and others. He married, and had a son.

He had a minor role in the poorly received remake &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot;, where he shared scenes with Marlon Brando, among others. This role is said to be the inspiration for the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; movie character Mini-Me, as well as Kevin who accompanies Dr. Alphonse Mephesto in &quot;South Park&quot;. Another very popular appearance was in the video for the song &quot;Coolo&quot; by the Argentine hip hop group Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas. De la Rosa had been approached by many American media operators and television shows, such as ESPN and others, for a feature about his life. So far, however, no plans to film a documentary about him have been completed.

==Life==
De la Rosa befriended then Boston Red Sox pitcher and fellow Dominican, Pedro Martínez, who began to take de la Rosa to playoff games as a good luck charm during the 2004 MLB playoffs.

He was a main attraction in the &quot;Hermanos Mazzini&quot; and &quot;Las Águilas Humanas&quot; circuses, which marketed him as the Guinness World Record-holder for world&#x27;s smallest man at 54 cm (21.25 inches), though this organization does not endorse this claim.

==Death==
He died at the age of 38, October 22, 2006, in Providence, Rhode Island, USA, reportedly from heart failure. He is survived by his wife, Jennifer De Leonel, and son who was 9. His remains were transferred to the Dominican Republic, and buried in the Cristo Redentor cemetery.

<text>The 101 Forward Control or Land Rover 101FC was a light utility vehicle produced by Land Rover for the British Army. It was not available to the public off the production line, but was as military surplus.

==History==
The vehicle was primarily produced to meet the Army&#x27;s requirement for a gun tractor, and was designed to tow a field gun (the L118 Light Gun) with a ton of ammunition and other equipment in the rear load space, giving it the alternative name of the &quot;Land Rover One Tonne&quot;. The vehicle was designed to be easily transported by air; the positioning of the 3.5 litre Rover V8 engine beneath and to the rear of the cab eliminates the bonnet at the front, making the vehicle more or less cuboid thus reducing unused space in transport aircraft. Of concern was the payload and limited stability, particularly when crossing an incline.

The official name of 101 Forward Control is derived from the vehicle&#x27;s wheelbase, and the position of the driver, above and slightly in front of the front wheels which used a fairly large 9.00 × 16 inch tyre. To facilitate entry into the cab, the wheels carry a flange around the centre of the wheel with an embossed tread pattern as a step for the crew, named a wheel-step. This unusual feature was also used for many years on the Mercedes Unimog S404.

Development of the 101FC started in 1967, with a design team led by Norman Busby (14 October 1931 – 30 June 2005). Production took place between 1972 and 1978. In common practice of the armed forces, many vehicles were not used for some years and it is not unheard of for military vehicle enthusiasts to pick up these vehicles after only a few thousand miles service. All the vehicles produced at the Land Rover factory at Lode Lane, Solihull were soft top (&quot;rag top&quot;) General Service (GS) gun tractors, although later on many were rebuilt with hard-top ambulance bodies and as radio communication trucks. A rare variant is the electronic warfare Vampire body. It is thought that only 21 of these were produced and less than half of these survive today. One was destroyed in the Buncefield Oil Terminal Fire.

The 101FC also served with the RAF Regiment. Two 101s were allocated to each Rapier Missile set up. The British RAF Rapier system used three Land Rovers in deployment: a 24V winch-fitted 101 Firing Unit Tractor (FUT) to tow the launch trailer, loaded with four Rapier missiles, guidance equipment and radio; a 12V winch-fitted 101 Tracking Radar Tractor (TRT) to tow the Blindfire Radar trailer, also loaded with four Rapier missiles and guidance equipment; and a 109 Land Rover to tow a reload trailer with 9 Rapier missiles and loaded with the unit&#x27;s other supplies and kit.

The 101FC also served in an ambulance role, with ambulance bodywork built by Marshall of Cambridge. The 101FC was manufactured in both left and right hand drive with either 12 or 24 volt electrical systems.

Some 101FCs were produced with a PTO powered Nokken capstan winch mounted on the chassis at the centre of the vehicle, allowing winching from either the front or rear. Another variation on a small number of pre-production vehicles was the addition of a trailer with an axle driven from the PTO, creating a 6x6 vehicle, this adaptation was abandoned before full production when it was discovered that the trailer had a propensity to push the vehicle onto its side when driven over rough terrain.

On 5 September 1979 an open 101FC of the Life Guards Regiment carried the coffin of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma from his funeral at Westminster Abbey to Waterloo Station

===Replacement===
By the late 1990s, the 101s were decommissioned by the MoD and were replaced with Defenders and Pinzgauer vehicles. Many 101s have entered into private ownership and there is a thriving owners club supporting these sourcing spares and providing technical support. The club also keeps a register of known surviving vehicles throughout the world.

A prototype 101 was built based on a recovery vehicle. Only one of these is known to be in existence, at the Heritage Motor Centre in Gaydon, Warwickshire.

==Australia==
The Australian Army acquired fifty 101 vehicles, which were used to tow Rapier missile carriers. These 101s were disposed of and some of these remain in private hands.

== Use in film ==
Thirty-one 101s were converted by Land Rover with styled bodyshells for the 1995 Sylvester Stallone film &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;. Land Rover is supposedly the world&#x27;s only surviving ground vehicle manufacturer in 2139 when the film is set, and the green oval logo can be seen on the side of the vehicles, known as &quot;City CABs&quot;.
Several of these prop vehicles still exist in driveable condition and these can be seen at Land Rover events.

== Custom Versions ==
During the 1990s Malcolm Whitbread of Whitbread Offroad 4x4 obtained four examples of the 101. Three were right-hand drive, one was left-hand drive. The right-hand drive examples were extensively modified for trails or rally use. Modifications included conversion to a coil spring suspension system based on the Range Rover configuration of the time. Disc brakes were also fitted. 
The left-hand drive example (UK registration GDP252V) was reconstructed with a hand-built custom chassis as a completely new vehicle. 15” wheels and power-assisted steering were included in the construction. GDP252V was the only left-hand drive Land Rover 101 Forward Control to be registered as a new vehicle.

<text>The Mercy Brown vampire incident occurred in Rhode Island, US, in 1892. It is one of the best documented cases of the exhumation of a corpse in order to perform rituals to banish an undead manifestation. The incident was part of the wider New England vampire panic.

Several cases of consumption (tuberculosis) occurred in the family of George and Mary Brown in Exeter, Rhode Island. Friends and neighbors believed that this was due to the influence of the undead. An attempt was made to remediate. Mercy Brown died in January 1892 at the age of 19.

==History==
In Exeter, Rhode Island, several members of George and Mary Brown&#x27;s family suffered a sequence of tuberculosis infections in the final two decades of the 19th century. Tuberculosis was called &quot;consumption&quot; at the time, and was a devastating and much-feared disease.

The mother, Mary Eliza, was the first to die of the disease, followed in 1884 by their eldest daughter, Mary Olive, according to her grave stone. In 1891, daughter Mercy and son Edwin also contracted the disease. Friends and neighbors of the family believed that one of the dead family members was a vampire, although they did not use that name, and had caused Edwin&#x27;s illness. This was in accordance with threads of contemporary folklore, which linked multiple deaths in one family to undead activity. Consumption was a poorly understood condition at the time and the subject of much superstition.

George Brown was persuaded to give permission to exhume several bodies of his family members. Villagers, the local doctor, and a newspaper reporter exhumed the bodies on March 17, 1892. The bodies of both Mary and Mary Olive exhibited the expected level of decomposition, so they were thought not to be the cause. However, the corpse of a daughter, Mercy, exhibited almost no decomposition, and still had blood in the heart. This was taken as a sign that the young woman was undead and the agent of young Edwin&#x27;s condition. Her lack of decomposition was more likely due to her body being stored in freezer-like conditions in an above-ground crypt during the two months following her death.

As superstition dictated, Mercy&#x27;s heart and liver were burned, and the ashes were mixed with water to create a and was given to the sick Edwin to drink, as an effort to resolve his illness and stop the influence of the undead. The young man died two months later. What remained of Mercy&#x27;s body was buried in the cemetery of the Baptist Church in Exeter after being desecrated.

In the end, the father, George Brown, was one of very few never to contract tuberculosis, living until 1922, just long enough to see bacteriologists Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin discover the BCG vaccine which is used to reduce risk of severe tuberculosis.

==Trivia==
The Mercy Brown incident was the inspiration for Caitlín R. Kiernan&#x27;s short story &quot;So Runs the World Away&quot;, which makes explicit reference to the affair. It has also been suggested by scholars that Bram Stoker, the author of the novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, knew about the Mercy Brown case through newspaper articles and based the novel&#x27;s character Lucy Westenra upon her. It is also referred to in H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Shunned House&quot;. Mercy Brown&#x27;s story was the inspiration for the young adult novel &quot;Mercy: The Last New England Vampire&quot; by Sarah L. Thomson. An account of the events as told by the remaining descendants of Mercy is available in Michael E. Bell&#x27;s &quot;Food for the Dead: On the Trail of New England&#x27;s Vampires&quot;.

The Mercy Brown story was the main subject of the first episode of the &quot;Lore&quot; podcast in 2015, as well as the first episode of the television adaptation of the same title in 2017.

The &quot;MonsterQuest&quot; episode &quot;Vampires In America&quot; investigated the Mercy Brown case and used it as a reference in the investigation.

American rock band Clutch has a song titled &quot;Mercy Brown&quot; on their 2022 album &quot;Sunrise on Slaughter Beach&quot;.

The story of Mercy Brown is also prominently featured in Paul Tremblay&#x27;s novel &quot;The Pallbearer&#x27;s Club.&quot;

<doc id="1063792" wikidata="Q1653985" url="?curid=1063792" title="Albert Heijn">
<text>Albert Heijn (), often abbreviated to AH () and informally to Appie (), is the largest supermarket chain in the Netherlands with a market share of 34.8% in 2020. It was founded in 1887, and has been part of Ahold Delhaize since 2016.

==History==
The chain was founded on 27 May 1887, when Albert Heijn bought a grocery store from his father Jan Heijn in Oostzaan. In the following years, Heijn opened other locations in several cities and in 1899, he opened a central warehouse in Zaandam.

From 1895, Heijn started roasting his own brand of coffee in a laundry room in his Oostzaan location and in 1910, several other self-produced items were added, including confectionery, cakes and pastry. Until 1913, these products were produced in an old town house in Zaandam, but the company built a professional factory on this spot in 1913.

In 1920, all enterprises were combined in the &quot;Maatschappij tot Exploitatie der Fabrieken en Handelszaken&quot; (Lit. &quot;Society for the Exploitation of Factories and Businesses&quot;). Anton Jurgens, one of the founders of Unilever, took a 50% share in the new company. These shares were bought back by the Heijn family in 1927. On 29 April 1920, Albert Heijn transferred control of the company to his sons Gerrit Heijn and Jan Heijn, and his son-in-law Johan Hille. Albert Heijn stayed on as president of the board.

Albert Heijn Sr. benefited from the industrialization that brought prosperity through fixed wages for factory workers and a new group of rich people. Eating habits changed: less in quantity but more and other types of items. Due to the rise of manufacturers and prepackaged items, indigenous and exclusive products came within reach.

The chain went public in 1948, and underwent two major changes in the 1950s. The first change was in 1952, with the introduction of their first self-service store and the second change was in 1955, with the opening of their first supermarket.

The chain could become the largest within the Netherlands via several acquisitions. Notable (partial) acquisitions were Van Amerongen (1950), Simon de Wit (1972) and C1000 (2008 and parts in 2012).

Ahold NV was founded on August 27, 1973 and Albert Heijn became part of it. The new construction made it easier for Albert Heijn&#x27;s new parent company to enter the foreign market. In October of the same year, Etos was acquired, a number of stores were converted into Albert Heijn and the rest continued as a drugstore within Ahold.

At the beginning of 2003, Albert Heijn saw its market share fall sharply: 22.8 percent against 24.7 percent a year earlier. In order to win back customers and leave the expensive image behind, Albert Heijn decided to start a large-scale price reduction in the same year. The chain permanently reduced the price of thousands of items every so often.

At the end of 2006, managing director Dick Boer announced that Albert Heijn would stop lowering prices. The price difference with the competitors was successfully reduced by many percent. The market share was almost 30 percent at the end of 2006. 

In 2007, the company crossed the ocean with the opening of a franchise store in Curaçao. This shop remained open until 2016, when it was changed to a different brand. The company entered the Belgian market in 2011, with the opening of a store in Brasschaat. Despite the merger of Ahold and Delhaize, Albert Heijn and Delhaize both remained active in Belgium. Currently Albert Heijn has 60 stores. After Curaçao and Belgium the company entered the German market with their AH To Go formula. This venture ended in 2018.

===Simon de Wit===
Simon de Wit was a large family-owned chain of supermarkets in the Netherlands. The company was founded by Simon de Wit (1852–1934), who after his father&#x27;s death in 1867 started a grocery store from his parental house in Wormerveer. In 1888 he opened the first branch in Amsterdam and by 1900 he ran stores at 30 different locations and owned a central warehouse in Zaandam.

In 1954 the opening of the 150th store was celebrated. In 1970, when Simon de Wit&#x27;s grandson Simon was in charge, a fire destroyed the central warehouse in Zaandam. Soon after, Albert Heijn, which also originated in the Zaanstreek, showed interest in a takeover and in 1973 Simon de Wit merged with Albert Heijn, with all employees retaining their jobs. All remaining shops took on the name of the latter.

== Format ==

=== Albert Heijn ===

This format is most used throughout the Netherlands and Belgium and is their regular store format. Since 2018, the company began to roll out the concept &quot;Echt Vers (Really Fresh)&quot; in which the stores would be remodelled to offer 10–15% more fresh produce.

Albert Heijn also distinguishes itself by the steadily growing range of organic and ecological products, reducing the use of plastics and investing in sustainable construction and transport. The expansion of the sustainable range was brought under the umbrella brand &quot;Puur &amp; Eerlijk&quot; in 2009, under the leadership of Dick Boer, with adjustments to stricter certification and change of packaging. The retail chain is also committed to reducing food waste.

=== AH To Go ===

In 1999, the chain developed a new format for a convenience store on request of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen, the railway company would become a franchisee and opened the first store on Station Den Bosch. The format got its current name in 2001, and specialises in products that customers need on their commute.

Since 2019, the company is testing a new version of the format without staff and cash registers. The customer scans their debit card and cameras register the customer and the items that are picked, after the customer leaves the right amount is deducted from their account. The new concept and technology was tested in a mobile unit that has been placed at the headquarters of Ahold Delhaize and Schiphol.

Since 2002, the company operates several hypermarkets with a larger variety of products in both food and non-food. Within the store there are also several chefs preparing take-away. This kind of store usually occupies the whole floor.

=== Albert Heijn Online ===
The company started testing delivery in 1999, with the Albert Heijn Thuisservice, which was renamed Albert.nl in 2001. Via this channel customers could purchase their groceries, but also products from sister-companies Etos and Gall &amp; Gall. The Albert brand was discontinued in 2014, and the delivery service was integrated in the Albert Heijn brand.

== Organisation and brand value ==
Since 1899, the chain is headquartered in Zaandam, their parent company is also located here. The chain operates six distribution centres in Nieuwegein, Geldermalsen, Zaandam, Tilburg, Pijnacker and Zwolle. In addition to an ever-growing impressive number of stores - both franchise and in-house - the chain also operates seven &quot;Home Shop Centers&quot; in Almere, Eindhoven, Rotterdam, De Meern, Amsterdam, Oosterhout and Bleiswijk.

The brand value of Albert Heijn was 866 million dollars in 2014, according to Trademark Office Interbrand. This put Albert Heijn in 26th place in the European brand values top 50.

<text>Categorical logic is the branch of mathematics in which tools and concepts from category theory are applied to the study of mathematical logic. It is also notable for its connections to theoretical computer science. 
In broad terms, categorical logic represents both syntax and semantics by a category, and an interpretation by a functor. The categorical framework provides a rich conceptual background for logical and type-theoretic constructions. The subject has been recognisable in these terms since around 1970.

== Overview ==

There are three important themes in the categorical approach to logic:
;Categorical semantics: Categorical logic introduces the notion of &quot;structure valued in a category&quot; C with the classical model theoretic notion of a structure appearing in the particular case where C is the category of sets and functions. This notion has proven useful when the set-theoretic notion of a model lacks generality and/or is inconvenient. R.A.G. Seely&#x27;s modeling of various impredicative theories, such as System F, is an example of the usefulness of categorical semantics.

:It was found that the connectives of pre-categorical logic were more clearly understood using the concept of adjoint functor, and that the quantifiers were also best understood using adjoint functors.

;Internal languages: This can be seen as a formalization and generalization of proof by diagram chasing. One defines a suitable internal language naming relevant constituents of a category, and then applies categorical semantics to turn assertions in a logic over the internal language into corresponding categorical statements. This has been most successful in the theory of toposes, where the internal language of a topos together with the semantics of intuitionistic higher-order logic in a topos enables one to reason about the objects and morphisms of a topos as if they were sets and functions. This has been successful in dealing with toposes that have &quot;sets&quot; with properties incompatible with classical logic. A prime example is Dana Scott&#x27;s model of untyped lambda calculus in terms of objects that retract onto their own function space. Another is the Moggi–Hyland model of system F by an internal full subcategory of the effective topos of Martin Hyland.

;Term model constructions: In many cases, the categorical semantics of a logic provide a basis for establishing a correspondence between theories in the logic and instances of an appropriate kind of category. A classic example is the correspondence between theories of βη-equational logic over simply typed lambda calculus and Cartesian closed categories. Categories arising from theories via term model constructions can usually be characterized up to equivalence by a suitable universal property. This has enabled proofs of meta-theoretical properties of some logics by means of an appropriate categorical algebra. For instance, Freyd gave a proof of the disjunction and existence properties of intuitionistic logic this way.

These three themes are related. The categorical semantics of a logic consists in describing a category of structured categories that is related to the category of theories in that logic by an adjunction, where the two functors in the adjunction give the internal language of a structured category on the one hand, and the term model of a theory on the other.

<text>Vathek (alternatively titled Vathek, an Arabian Tale or The History of the Caliph Vathek) is a Gothic novel written by William Beckford. It was composed in French beginning in 1782, and then translated into English by Reverend Samuel Henley in which form it was first published in 1786 without Beckford&#x27;s name as &quot;An Arabian Tale, From an Unpublished Manuscript&quot;, claiming to be translated directly from Arabic. The first French edition, titled simply as &quot;Vathek&quot;, was published in December 1786 (postdated 1787). During the twentieth century some editions include &quot;The Episodes of Vathek&quot; (&quot;Vathek et ses épisodes&quot;), three related tales intended by Beckford to be so incorporated, but omitted from the original edition and published separately long after his death.

== Plot summary ==
Vathek, the ninth caliph of the Abassides, ascended to the throne at an early age. He is a fickle and depraved tyrant, known for his unquenchable thirst for knowledge, and often invites scholars to converse with him. If he fails to convince the scholar of his points of view, he attempts a bribe; if this does not work, he sends the scholar to prison. To better study astronomy, he builds an observation tower with 11,000 steps. Prophet Muhammad observes Vathek from the seventh heaven, but decides not to punish him, believing that the decadent caliph will bring about his destruction.

A hideous stranger whom Vathek calls &quot;Giaour&quot; arrives in Samarra, claiming to be a merchant from India selling Vathek magical treasures, but refuses to reveal their origin, causing Vathek to throw him in prison. The next day, he discovers that the merchant has escaped and his prison guards are dead. Depressed, Vathek loses his appetite and falls into a drunken stupor. His Greek mother Carathis, a practitioner of Zarathustrianism, arrives to comfort him.

Vathek develops an insatiable thirst, which the giaour later cures and the two men return to Samarra. At court, Vathek makes a fool of himself trying to out-drink the Giaour, and to out-eat him; when he sits upon the throne to administer justice, he does so haphazardly. His prime vizier rescues him from disgrace by whispering that Carathis had read a message in the stars foretelling a great evil to befall him. When Vathek confronts the giaour, he is met with laughter, enraging Vathek who kicks him. The giaour is transformed into a ball and Vathek compels everyone in the palace to kick it. Then Vathek has the whole town kick the giaour into a remote valley. Vathek stays in the area and eventually hears Giaour&#x27;s voice telling him that if he worships the Giaour and the jinns of the earth, and renounces the teachings of Islam, he will bring Vathek great knowledge and the keys to the &quot;Palace of Underground Fire&quot; where Soliman Ben Daoud controls the talismans that rule over the world.

Vathek agrees and proceeds with the ritual that the giaour demands: to sacrifice fifty of the city&#x27;s children. In return, Vathek will receive a key of great power. Vathek holds a &quot;competition&quot; among the children of the nobles, declaring that the winners will receive precious gifts. As the children approach Vathek for the competition, he throws them inside an ebony portal where the giaour feasts upon their blood. This enrages the residents of Samarra, and accuse him of murdering their children. Carathis pleads with Morakanabad to help save Vathek&#x27;s life; the vizier complies and calms the crowd.

Vathek grows impatient with the giaour, and Carathis advises him to fulfill the pact and sacrifice to the jinn of the earth. Carathis helps him prepare the sacrifice: she and her son climb to the top of the tower and mix oils to create an explosion of light. The people of Samarra mistake the smoke rising from the tower for fire and rush to help the caliph, only to be burned alive as Carathis sacrifices them to the jinn. Carathis performs another ritual and learns that for Vathek to claim his reward, he must go to Istakhr.

Vathek sets off with his wives and servants, placing the city in the care of Morakanabad and Carathis. Eventually, they reach the mountains where Islamic dwarves reside. He stays with them and meets their Emir named Fakreddin, and the Emir&#x27;s beautiful daughter Nouronihar. Vathek wants to marry her, but she is already in love with and promised to her effeminate cousin Gulchenrouz. The Emir and his servants plan to safeguard Nouronihar and Gulchenrouz by drugging them and hiding them in a valley by a lake. The plan succeeds temporarily, but when they awake in the valley, they believe they have died and are in purgatory. Nouronihar grows curious and wants to explore the area. Beyond the valley, she encounters Vathek, who seduces her.

In Samarra, Carathis can discover no news of her son from reading the stars. Vathek&#x27;s favorite wife, the sultana Dilara, writes to Carathis, informing her that her son has broken the condition of the giaour&#x27;s contract, by accepting Fakreddin&#x27;s hospitality on the way to Istakhr. She asks him to drown Nouronihar, but Vathek refuses. Carathis then decides to sacrifice Gulchenrouz, but before she can catch him, Gulchenrouz jumps into the arms of a jinn who protects him. That night, Carathis hears that Motavakel, Vathek&#x27;s brother, is planning to lead a revolt against Morakanabad. Vathek continues on his journey, reaches Roknabad, and degrades and humiliates its citizens for his pleasure.

A jinn asks Mohammed for permission to try to save Vathek from his eternal damnation, to which he agrees. He takes the form of a saintly shepherd who plays the flute to make men realize their sins. The shepherd asks Vathek if he is done sinning, warns Vathek about the fallen angel Iblis. The shepherd begs Vathek to renounce his wickedness and return to Islam, lest he be eternally damned. In his pride, Vathek rejects the offer and declares that he renounces Islam.

Vathek reaches Istakhr, where the giaour opens the gates, and Vathek and Nouronihar step through into a place of gold. The Giaour leads them to Iblis, who tells them that they may enjoy whatever his empire holds. Vathek asks to be taken to the talismans that govern the world. There, Soliman tells Vathek that he had once been a great king, but was seduced by a Jinn and received the power to make everyone in the world do his bidding. But because of this, Soliman is destined to suffer in hell for a finite but vast period. The other inmates must suffer the fire in their hearts for all eternity. Vathek requests the giaour to release him, saying he will relinquish all he was offered, but the giaour refuses. He tells Vathek to enjoy his omnipotence while it lasts, for in a few days he will be tormented.

Vathek and Nouronihar become increasingly discontented with the palace of flames. Vathek orders an ifrit to fetch Carathis from the castle. While the ifrit is bringing Carathis, Vathek meets some people who are, like him, awaiting the execution of their sentences of eternal suffering. Three relate to Vathek how they got to Iblis&#x27; domain. When Carathis arrives, he warns her of what happens to those who enter Iblis&#x27; domain, but Carathis takes the talismans of earthly power from Soliman regardless. She gathers the Jinns and tries to overthrow one of the Solimans, but Iblis decrees &quot;It is time.&quot; Carathis, Vathek, Nouronihar, and the other denizens of hell lose &quot;the most precious gift granted by heaven – HOPE&quot;. They all sink into a state of complete apathy, and an eternal fire begins to burn within them.

== Characters ==

;Vathek: Ninth Caliph of the Abassides, who ascended to the throne at an early age. His figure was pleasing and majestic, but when angry, his eyes became so terrible that &quot;the wretch on whom it was fixed instantly fell backwards and sometimes expired&quot; (1). He was addicted to women and pleasures of the flesh, so he ordered five palaces to be built: the five palaces of the senses. Although he was an eccentric man, he was learned in the ways of science, physics, and astrology. His chief sin, gluttony, paved the path of his damnation.

;Giaour: His name means &quot;blasphemer&quot; and &quot;infidel&quot;. He claims to be an Indian merchant, but in actuality he is a Jinn who works for the arch-demon Eblis. He guides Vathek and gives him instructions on how to reach the palace of fire.

;Carathis: Vathek&#x27;s mother. She is a Greek woman who is well versed in science, astrology, and occult magic. She teaches all of her skills to Vathek, and convinces him to embark on his quest for power which eventually leads to his damnation. When arriving in hell, Carathis runs amok, exploring the palace, discovering its hidden secrets, and even tries to stage a rebellion. However, once her own punishment is enacted, she too loses all hope and is consumed by her guilt.

;Emir Fakreddin: Vathek&#x27;s host during his travels. He offers Vathek a place to stay and rest. He is deeply religious. Vathek betrays his hospitality by seducing his daughter.

;Nouronihar: The Emir&#x27;s daughter, a beautiful girl who is promised to Gulchenrouz, but is seduced by Vathek and joins him in his road to damnation.

;Gulchenrouz: A beautiful young man with feminine features. He is the Emir&#x27;s nephew. Due to his innocence, he is rescued from Carathis&#x27;s hands and is allowed to live in eternal youth in a palace above the clouds.

;Bababalouk: Head of Vathek&#x27;s eunuchs. He is cunning and acts as a steward on Vathek&#x27;s journey.

;Morakanabad: Vathek&#x27;s loyal and unsuspecting vizier.

;Sutlememe: The Emir&#x27;s head eunuch who serves as a caretaker for Nouronihar and Gulchenrouz.

;Dilara: Vathek&#x27;s favourite wife.

== Terms used from history and mythology, as named in the work ==
* Afrit – described as a creature comparable to the Lamia and Medusa, depicted as the cruelest type of demon (&quot;div&quot;) in Vathek.
* Balkis (Balkis in &quot;Vathek&quot;) (, ; , ; ( ); , – the woman ruler of the ancient kingdom of Sheba eferred to in Habeshan history, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the Qur&#x27;an. She is mentioned (unnamed) in the Bible in the Books of Kings and Book of Chronicles as a great queen who seeks out Solomon to learn if the tales of his wisdom are true. She is also mentioned in Jewish legends as a queen with a great love for learning, in African tales as &quot;the queen of Egypt and Ethiopia&quot;, and in Muslim tradition as Balkis, a great queen of a nation that worshiped the sun who later converted to Solomon&#x27;s god. The Roman historian Josephus calls her Nicaule. She is thought to have been born on 5 January, sometime in the 10th century BC. The character was modelled on Iblis or Azazil and from Satan in John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&#x27;s&quot; Satan (1667 and 1674; see Fallen angel).
* Dive – an evil creature, a demon.
* Eunuch – an emasculated man; the term usually refers to those emasculated to perform a specific social function.
* Khalif (Caliph in &quot;Vathek&quot;) (from Arabic خلافة khilāfa) – the head of state in a caliphate, and the title for the leader of the Islamic Ummah, or global Islamic nation. It is a transliterated version of the Arabic word خليفة Khalīfah which means &quot;successor&quot; or &quot;representative&quot;. The early leaders of the Muslim nation following Muhammad&#x27;s (570–632) death were called &quot;Khalifat ar-rasul Allah,&quot; meaning political successor.

* Mount Qaf – a legencary mountain surrounding the Earth.
* Simurgh – a wise and miraculous bird, friendly towards &quot;the sons of Adam&quot; and an enemy to the &quot;divs&quot;.

=== Setting ===
Architecture is used to illustrate certain elements of Vathek&#x27;s character and to warn of the dangers of over-reaching. Vathek&#x27;s hedonism and devotion to pleasure are reflected in the pleasure wings he adds on to his castle, each with the express purpose of satisfying a different sense. He builds a tall tower in order to further his quest for knowledge. This tower stands for Vathek&#x27;s pride and desire for a power beyond the reach of humans. He is later warned that he must destroy the tower and return to Islam, or risk dire consequences. Vathek&#x27;s pride wins out, and in the end his quest for power and knowledge ends with him confined to hell.

== Literary significance and criticism ==
Lord Byron cited &quot;Vathek&quot; as a source for his poem &quot;The Giaour&quot;. In &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;, Byron also calls Vathek &quot;England&#x27;s wealthiest son&quot;. Other Romantic poets wrote works with a Middle Eastern setting inspired by &quot;Vathek&quot;, including Robert Southey&#x27;s &quot;Thalaba the Destroyer&quot; (1801) and Thomas Moore&#x27;s &quot;Lalla-Rookh&quot; (1817). John Keats&#x27;s vision of the Underworld in &quot;Endymion&quot; (1818) is indebted to the novel.

Edgar Allan Poe mentions the infernal terrace seen by Vathek in &quot;Landor&#x27;s Cottage&quot;. Stéphane Mallarmé, who translated Poe&#x27;s poems into French, inspired by this reference in &quot;Landor&#x27;s Cottage,&quot; had &quot;Vathek&quot; reprinted in its original French, for which edition he also supplied a preface. In his book &quot;English Prose Style&quot;, Herbert Read cited &quot;Vathek&quot; as &quot;one of the best fantasies in the language&quot;.

H. P. Lovecraft also cited &quot;Vathek&quot; as the inspiration for his unfinished novel &quot;Azathoth&quot;. &quot;Vathek&quot; is also believed to have been a model for Lovecraft&#x27;s completed novel &quot;The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot;.

American fantasy author Clark Ashton Smith greatly admired &quot;Vathek&quot;. Smith later wrote &quot;The Third Episode of Vathek&quot;, the completion of a fragment by Beckford that was entitled &quot;The Story of the Princess Zulkaïs and the Prince Kalilah&quot;. &quot;The Third Episode of Vathek&quot; was published in R. H. Barlow&#x27;s fanzine &quot;Leaves&quot; in 1937, and later in Smith&#x27;s 1960 collection &quot;The Abominations of Yondo&quot;.

&quot;Vathek&quot; has been well received by historians of the fantasy genre; Les Daniels stated &quot;Vathek&quot; was &quot;a unique and delightful book&quot;. Daniels argued &quot;Vathek&quot; had little in common with the other &quot;Gothic&quot; novels; &quot;Beckford&#x27;s luxuriant imagery and sly humour create a mood totally antithetical to that suggested by the grey castles and black deeds of medieval Europe&quot;. Franz Rottensteiner calls the novel &quot;a marvellous story, the creation of an erratic but powerful imagination, which brilliantly evokes the mystery and wonder associated with the Orient&quot; and Brian Stableford has praised the work as the &quot;classic novel &quot;Vathek&quot;—a feverish and gleefully perverse decadent/Arabian fantasy&quot;.

== Major allusions to &quot;Vathek&quot; ==
* &quot;Vathek&quot;, a symphonic poem written in 1913, composed by Luís de Freitas Branco, was inspired by this novel.
* Another symphonic poem by the same title came from Horatio Parker in 1903.
* The Spanish musician Luis Delgado has published an album called &quot;Vathek&quot; (1982), inspired by the literary work.

<text>Requiem for a Dream is a 1978 novel by American writer Hubert Selby Jr. that concerns four New Yorkers whose lives spiral out of control as they succumb to their addictions.

==Plot==
This story follows the lives of Sara Goldfarb, her son Harry, his girlfriend Marion Kleinmitz, and his best friend Tyrone C. Love, who are all searching for the key to their dreams in their own ways. In the process, they fall into devastating lives of addiction. Harry and Marion are in love and want to open their own business; their friend Tyrone wants to escape life in the ghetto. To achieve these dreams, they buy a large amount of heroin, planning to get rich by selling it.

Sara, Harry&#x27;s lonely widowed mother, dreams of being on television. When a phone call from a game show casting company gets her hopes up, she goes to a doctor, who gives her diet pills to lose weight. She spends the next few months on the pills, wanting desperately to look thin on TV and fit into a red dress from her younger days. However, the casting company does not notify her about the details of her show. She becomes addicted to the diet pills and eventually develops amphetamine psychosis after her life continues to go downhill. She eventually ends up in a mental institution, where she undergoes electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

Harry, Marion, and Tyrone become addicted to their own product. Eventually, when heroin becomes scarce, they turn on each other, each hiding the drugs they obtain from the others. On their way to Miami, Harry and Tyrone are arrested, convicted, and sentenced to jail. Harry&#x27;s arm has become infected from repeated injections, and has to be amputated. Left alone, Marion becomes a prostitute to support her addiction. In jail, Tyrone faces frequent abuse from the guards due to his race.

==Film adaptation==

The novel was later adapted into a critically acclaimed eponymous film, released in 2000. The film was directed by Darren Aronofsky and stars Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans and Ellen Burstyn. Burstyn was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as Sara.

<doc id="1063807" wikidata="Q863679" url="?curid=1063807" title="Chinoiserie">
<text> (, ; loanword from French &quot;&quot;, from &quot;&quot;, &quot;Chinese&quot;; ) is the European interpretation and imitation of Chinese and other Sinosphere artistic traditions, especially in the decorative arts, garden design, architecture, literature, theatre, and music. The aesthetic of chinoiserie has been expressed in different ways depending on the region. It is related to the broader current of Orientalism, which studied Far East cultures from a historical, philological, anthropological, philosophical, and religious point of view. First appearing in the 17th century, this trend was popularized in the 18th century due to the rise in trade with China (during the High Qing era) and the rest of East Asia.

As a style, chinoiserie is related to the Rococo style. Both styles are characterized by exuberant decoration, asymmetry, a focus on materials, and stylized nature and subject matter that focuses on leisure and pleasure. Chinoiserie focuses on subjects that were thought by Europeans to be typical of Chinese culture.

== History ==
Chinoiserie entered European art and decoration in the mid-to-late 17th century; the work of Athanasius Kircher influenced the study of Orientalism. The popularity of chinoiserie peaked around the middle of the 18th century when it was associated with the Rococo style and with works by François Boucher, Thomas Chippendale, and Jean-Baptist Pillement. It was also popularized by the influx of Chinese and Indian goods brought annually to Europe aboard English, Dutch, French, and Swedish East India Companies. There was a revival of popularity for chinoiserie in Europe and the United States from the mid-19th century through the 1920s, and today in elite interior design and fashion.
Though usually understood as a European style, chinoiserie was a global phenomenon. Local versions of chinoiserie were developed in India, Japan, Iran, and particularly Latin America. Through the Manila galleon trade, Spanish traders brought large amounts of Chinese porcelain, lacquer, textiles, and spices from Chinese merchants based in Manila to New Spanish markets in Acapulco, Panama, and Lima. Those products then inspired local artists and artisans such as ceramicists making Talavera pottery at Puebla de Los Angeles.

Chinoiserie had some parallel in &quot;occidenterie&quot;, which was Western styled goods produced in 18th century China for Chinese consumers. Although this was a notable interest of the Kangxi Emperor and Qianlong Emperor, as shown by the architecture of Xiyang Lou, it was not restricted only to the court. &quot;Occidenterie&quot; artifacts and art were accessible to a wider variety of consumers, as they were domestically produced.

== Popularization ==
There were many reasons why chinoiserie gained such popularity in Europe in the 18th century. Europeans had a fascination with Asia due to their increased, but still restricted, access to new cultures through expanded trade with East Asia, especially China. The &#x27;China&#x27; indicated in the term &#x27;chinoiserie&#x27; represented in European people&#x27;s mind a wider region of the globe that could embrace China itself, but also Japan, Korea, South-East Asia, India or even Persia. In art, the style of &quot;the Orient&quot; was considered a source of inspiration; the atmosphere rich in images and the harmonic designs of the oriental style reflected the picture of an ideal world, from which to draw ideas in order to reshape one&#x27;s own culture. For this reason the style of chinoiserie is to be regarded as an important result of the exchange between the West and the East. During the 19th century, and especially in its latter period, the style of chinoiserie was assimilated under the generic definition of exoticism. 
Even though the root of the word &#x27;chinoiserie&#x27; is &#x27;Chine&#x27; (China), the Europeans of the 17th and 18th centuries did not have a clear conceptualization of how China was in reality. Often terms like &#x27;Orient&#x27;, &#x27;Far East&#x27; or &#x27;China&#x27; were all equally used to signify the region of Eastern Asia that had proper Chinese culture as a major representative, but the meaning of the term could change according to different contexts. Sir William Chambers for example, in his oeuvre A Dissertation on Oriental Gardening of 1772, generically addresses China as the &#x27;Orient&#x27;. In the financial records of Louis XIV during the 17th and 18th centuries were already registered expressions like &#x27;façon de la Chine&#x27;, Chinese manner, or &#x27;à la chinoise&#x27;, made in the Chinese way. In the 19th century the term &#x27;chinoiserie&#x27; appeared for the first time in French literature. In the novel &quot;L&#x27;Interdiction&quot; published in 1836, Honoré de Balzac used chinoiserie to refer to the craftworks made in the Chinese style. From this moment on the term gained momentum and started being used more frequently to mean objects produced in the Chinese style but sometimes also to indicate graceful objects of small dimension or of scarce account. In 1878 &#x27;chinoiserie&#x27; entered formally in the &quot;Dictionnaire de l&#x27;Académie&quot;.
After the spread of Marco Polo&#x27;s narrations, the knowledge of China held by the Europeans continued to derive essentially from reports made by merchants and diplomatic envoys. Dating from the latter half of the 17th century a relevant role in this exchange of information was then taken up by the Jesuits, whose continual gathering of missionary intelligence and language transcription gave the European public a new deeper insight of the Chinese empire and its culture.

While Europeans frequently held inaccurate ideas about East Asia, this did not necessarily preclude their fascination and respect. In particular, the Chinese who had &quot;exquisitely finished art... [and] whose court ceremonial was even more elaborate than that of Versailles&quot; were viewed as highly civilized. According to Voltaire in his &quot;Art de la Chine&quot;, &quot;The fact remains that four thousand years ago, when we did not know how to read, they [the Chinese] knew everything essentially useful of which we boast today.&quot; Moreover, Indian philosophy was increasingly admired by philosophers such as Arthur Schopenhauer, who regarded the Upanishads as the &quot;production of the highest human wisdom&quot; and &quot;the most profitable and elevating reading which...is possible in the world.&quot;

Chinoiserie was not universally popular. Some critics saw the style as &quot;…a retreat from reason and taste and a descent into a morally ambiguous world based on hedonism, sensation and values perceived to be feminine.&quot; It was viewed as lacking the logic and reason upon which Antique art had been founded. Architect and author Robert Morris claimed that it &quot;…consisted of mere whims and chimera, without rules or order, it requires no fertility of genius to put into execution.&quot; Those with a more archaeological view of the East, considered the chinoiserie style, with its distortions and whimsical approach, to be a mockery of the actual Chinese art and architecture. Finally, still others believed that an interest in chinoiserie indicated a pervading &quot;cultural confusion&quot; in European society.

== Persistence after the 18th century ==
Chinoiserie persisted into the 19th and 20th centuries but declined in popularity. There was a notable loss of interest in Chinese-inspired décor after the death in 1830 of King George IV, a great proponent of the style. The First Opium War of 1839–1842 between Britain and China disrupted trade and caused a further decline of interest in the Oriental. China closed its doors to exports and imports and for many people chinoiserie became a fashion of the past.

As British-Chinese relations stabilized towards the end of the 19th century, there was a revival of interest in chinoiserie. Prince Albert, for example, reallocated many chinoiserie works from George IV&#x27;s Royal Pavilion at Brighton to the more accessible Buckingham Palace. Chinoiserie served to remind Britain of its former colonial glory that was rapidly fading with the modern era.

== Chinese porcelain ==
From the Renaissance to the 18th century Western designers attempted to imitate the technical sophistication of Chinese export porcelain (and for that matter Japanese export porcelain – Europeans were generally vague as the origin of &quot;oriental&quot; imports), with only partial success. One of the earliest successful attempts, for instance, was the Medici porcelain manufactured in Florence during the late-16th century, as the Casino of San Marco remained open from 1575 to 1587. Despite never being commercial in nature, the next major attempt to replicate Chinese porcelain was the soft-paste manufactory at Rouen in 1673, with Edme Poterat, widely reputed as creator of the French soft-paste pottery tradition, opening his own factory in 1647. Efforts were eventually made to imitate hard-paste porcelain, which were held in high regard. As such, the direct imitation of Chinese designs in faience began in the late 17th century, was carried into European porcelain production, most naturally in tea wares, and peaked in the wave of rococo chinoiserie (c. 1740–1770).

Earliest hints of chinoiserie appear in the early 17th century, in the arts of the nations with active East India Companies, Holland and England, then by the mid-17th century, in Portugal as well. Tin-glazed pottery (see &quot;delftware&quot;) made at Delft and other Dutch towns adopted genuine blue-and-white Ming decoration from the early 17th century. After a book by Johan Nieuhof was published the 150 pictures encouraged chinoiserie, and became especially popular in the 18th century. Early ceramic wares in Meissen porcelain and other factories naturally imitated Chinese designs, though the shapes for &quot;useful wares&quot;, table and tea wares, typically remained Western, often based on shapes in silver. Decorative wares such as vases followed Chinese shapes.

== Painting ==
The ideas of the decorative and pictorial arts of the East permeated the European and American arts and craft scene. For example, in the United States, &quot;by the mid-18th century, Charleston had imported an impressive array of Asian export luxury goods [such as]...paintings.&quot; The aspects of Chinese painting that were integrated into European and American visual arts include asymmetrical compositions, lighthearted subject matter and a general sense of capriciousness.

William Alexander (1767–1816), a British painter, illustrator and engraver who travelled to the East Asia and China in the 18th century, was directly influenced by the culture and landscape he saw in the East. He presented an idealized, romanticized depiction of Chinese culture, but he was influenced by &quot;pre-established visual signs.&quot; While the chinoiserie landscapes that Alexander depicted accurately reflected the landscape of China, &quot;paradoxically, it is this imitation and repetition of the iconic signs of China that negate the very possibility of authenticity, and render them into stereotypes.&quot; The depiction of China and East Asia in European and American painting was dependent on the understanding of the East by Western preconceptions, rather than representations of Eastern culture as it actually was.

== Interior design ==
 
Various European monarchs, such as Louis XV of France, gave special favor to chinoiserie, as it blended well with the rococo style. Entire rooms, such as those at Château de Chantilly, were painted with chinoiserie compositions, and artists such as Antoine Watteau and others brought expert craftsmanship to the style. Central European palaces like the Castle of Wörlitz or the Castle of Pillnitz all include rooms decorated with Chinese features, while in the palace of Sanssouci at Potsdam features a Dragon House (Das Drachenhaus) and the Chinese House (Das Chinesische Haus). Pleasure pavilions in &quot;Chinese taste&quot; appeared in the formal parterres of late Baroque and Rococo German and Russian palaces, and in tile panels at Aranjuez near Madrid. Chinese Villages were built in the mountainous park of Wilhelmshöhe near Kassel, Germany; in Drottningholm, Sweden and Tsarskoe Selo, Russia. Thomas Chippendale&#x27;s mahogany tea tables and china cabinets, especially, were embellished with fretwork glazing and railings, &quot;c.&quot; 1753–70, but sober &quot;homages&quot; to early Qing scholars&#x27; furnishings were also naturalized, as the &quot;tang&quot; evolved into a mid-Georgian side table and squared slat-back armchairs suited English gentlemen as well as Chinese scholars. Not every adaptation of Chinese design principles falls within mainstream chinoiserie. Chinoiserie media included &quot;japanned&quot; ware imitations of lacquer and painted tin (tôle) ware that imitated japanning, early painted wallpapers in sheets, after engravings by Jean-Baptiste Pillement, and ceramic figurines and table ornaments.

In the 17th and 18th centuries Europeans began to manufacture furniture that imitated Chinese lacquer furniture. It was frequently decorated with ebony and ivory or Chinese motifs such as pagodas. Thomas Chippendale helped to popularize the production of chinoiserie furniture with the publication of his design book &quot;The Gentleman and Cabinet-maker&#x27;s Director: Being a large Collection of the Most Elegant and Useful Designs of Household Furniture, In the Most Fashionable Taste.&quot; His designs provided a guide for intricate chinoiserie furniture and its decoration. His chairs and cabinets were often decorated with scenes of colorful birds, flowers, or images of exotic imaginary places. The compositions of this decoration were often asymmetrical.

The increased use of wallpaper in European homes in the 18th century also reflects the general fascination with chinoiserie motifs. With the rise of the villa and a growing taste for sunlit interiors, the popularity of wallpaper grew. The demand for wallpaper created by Chinese artists began first with European aristocrats between 1740 and 1790. The luxurious wallpaper available to them would have been unique, handmade, and expensive. Later wallpaper with chinoiserie motifs became accessible to the middle class when it could be printed and thus produced in a range of grades and prices.

The patterns on chinoiserie wallpaper are similar to the pagodas, floral designs, and exotic imaginary scenes found on chinoiserie furniture and porcelain. Like chinoiserie furniture and other decorative art forms, chinoiserie wallpaper was typically placed in bedrooms, closets, and other private rooms of a house. The patterns on wallpaper were expected to complement the decorative objects and furniture in a room, creating a complementary backdrop.

== Architecture and gardens ==
European understanding of Chinese and East Asian garden design is exemplified by the use of the word &quot;Sharawadgi&quot;, understood as beauty, without order that takes the form of an aesthetically pleasing irregularity in landscape design. The word traveled together with imported lacquer ware from Japan where &quot;shara&#x27;aji&quot; was an idiom in appraisal of design in decorative arts. Sir William Temple (1628–1699), referring to such artwork, introduces the term sharawadgi in his essay &quot;Upon the Gardens of Epicurus&quot; written in 1685 and published in 1690. Under Temple&#x27;s influence European gardeners and landscape designers used the concept of sharawadgi to create gardens that were believed to reflect the asymmetry and naturalism present in the gardens of the East.

These gardens often contain various fragrant plants, flowers and trees, decorative rocks, ponds or lake with fish, and twisting pathways. They are frequently enclosed by a wall. Architectural features placed in these gardens often include pagodas, ceremonial halls used for celebrations or holidays, pavilions with flowers and seasonal elements.

Landscapes such as London&#x27;s Kew Gardens show distinct Chinese influence in architecture. The monumental 163-foot Great Pagoda in the centre of the gardens, designed and built by William Chambers, exhibits strong English architectural elements, resulting in a product of combined cultures (Bald, 290). A replica of it was built in Munich&#x27;s Englischer Garten, while the Chinese Garden of Oranienbaum includes another pagoda and also a Chinese teahouse. Though the rise of a more serious approach in Neoclassicism from the 1770s onward tended to replace Oriental inspired designs, at the height of Regency &quot;Grecian&quot; furnishings, the Prince Regent came down with a case of Brighton Pavilion, and Chamberlain&#x27;s Worcester china manufactory imitated &quot;Imari&quot; wares. While classical styles reigned in the parade rooms, upscale houses, from Badminton House (where the &quot;Chinese Bedroom&quot; was furnished by William and John Linnell, ca 1754) and Nostell Priory to Casa Loma in Toronto, sometimes featured an entire guest room decorated in the chinoiserie style, complete with Chinese-styled bed, phoenix-themed wallpaper, and china. Later exoticism added imaginary Turkish themes, where a &quot;diwan&quot; became a sofa.

== Tea ==

One of the things that contributed to the popularity of chinoiserie was the 18th-century vogue for tea drinking. The feminine and domestic culture of drinking tea required an appropriate &quot;chinoiserie mise en scène&quot;. According to Beevers, &quot;Tea drinking was a fundamental part of polite society; much of the interest in both Chinese export wares and chinoiserie rose from the desire to create appropriate settings for the ritual of tea drinking.&quot; After 1750, England was importing 10 million pounds of tea annually, demonstrating how widespread this practice was. The taste for chinoiserie porcelain, both export wares and European imitations, and tea drinking was more associated with women than men. A number of aristocratic and socially important women were famous collectors of chinoiserie porcelain, among them Queen Mary II, Queen Anne, Henrietta Howard, and the Duchess of Queensbury, all socially important women. This is significant because their homes served as examples of good taste and sociability. A single historical incident in which there was a &quot;keen competition between Margaret, 2nd Duchess of Portland, and Elizabeth, Countess of Ilchester, for a Japanese blue and white plate,&quot; shows how wealthy female consumers asserted their purchasing power and their need to play a role in creating the prevailing vogue.

== Fashion ==
The term is also used in the fashion industry to describe &quot;designs in textiles, fashion, and the decorative arts that derive from Chinese styles&quot;. Since the 17th century, Chinese arts and aesthetic were sources of inspiration to artists and creators, and fashion designers when goods from oriental countries were widely seen for the first time in Western Europe.

In the 18th century and throughout the 19th century, chinoiserie fashion was especially celebrated in France, and the origin of most Chinese-inspired fashion was French during this period. Chinoiserie had also inspired designers such as Mariano Fortuny, the Callot Soeurs, and Jean Paquin. 
In the early 20th century, European and fashion designers would use China and other countries outside of the Eurocentric-fashion world to seek inspiration; &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine also acknowledged that China had contributed to the aesthetic inspiration to global fashion. Chinese motifs grew popular in European fashion during this period. China and the Chinese people also supplied the materials and aesthetics to American fashion. Original Chinese fashion also influenced various designs and styles of deshabille. 

There was also a fashion trend for day-wear jackets and coats to be cut in styles which would suggest various Chinese items as was published the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; in June 1913, where the garments displayed showed influences of the Qing dynasty mandarin court gown (especially the bufu), the jiaoling ruqun, kanjia, mamianqun, yunjian, yaoqun (short waist-skirt), piling (collar), as well as traditional Chinese embroideries, and traditional Chinese Lào zi, pankou, high collars, etc.

According to the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; of June 1913, volume 30, issue 6:

== Music ==
Western approximations of Chinese and oriental music first began to be used in the mid-17th century in operas such as Purcell&#x27;s &quot;The Fairy-Queen&quot; (1692) and Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Le cinesi&quot; (1754). Jean-Jacques Rousseau included what he claimed was an authentic Chinese melody, the &quot;air chinois&quot;, in his 1768 &quot;Dictionary of Music&quot;, and it was re-used by Weber in his &quot;Overtura cinesa&quot; (1804). Offenbach&#x27;s satirical one-act operetta &quot;Ba-ta-clan&quot; (1855) was a big success in Paris. The 1889 Paris World Fair played a significant role in bringing world music to the attention of modern Western composers.

In the early 20th century French composers responded to the West&#x27;s then utopian, nostalgic view of Chinese landscape and culture in pieces such as &quot;Pagodas&quot; (Debussy, 1903). There followed three major 20th century examples of musical chinoiserie: Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; (1908), Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Nightingale&quot; (1914), and Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot; (1926). 

Other notable pieces include Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &#x27;Chinese Dance&#x27; (from Act Two of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; 1892), Ravel&#x27;s &#x27;Laideronnette, impératrice des pagodes&#x27; (from &quot;Ma mère l&#x27;Oye&quot;, 1910), the &quot;Chinese Symphony&quot; (1914) by Bernard van Dieren, and the light music orchestral fantasy &quot;In a Chinese Temple Garden&quot; by Albert Ketelbey (1923). 
In Britain, many 20th century song composers set English translations of Chinese poetry (by orientalists such as Launcelot Cranmer-Byng, Herbert Giles, Edward Powys Mathers and Arthur Waley) to music, including Benjamin Britten in his cycle &quot;Songs from the Chinese&quot; for high voice and guitar (1957). More recent operatic examples include &quot;A Night at the Chinese Opera&quot; (Judith Weir, 1987) and &quot;Nixon in China&quot; (John Adams, 1987).

The influence of Chinese and East Asian music has also been evident in popular music, from musical comedy (&quot;The Geisha&quot;, 1896, &quot;A Chinese Honeymoon&quot;, 1899, &quot;Chu Chin Chow&quot;, 1916), Tin Pan Alley (&quot;Limehouse Nights&quot; by George Gershwin, 1920), Broadway musicals and jazz (&quot;The King and I&quot;, 1951, &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;, 1958, &#x27;Chinoiserie&#x27; by Duke Ellington, 1971) through to modern rock music (&quot;China Girl&quot; by David Bowie, 1976 and many more). These pieces often incorporate Western cultural shorthand clichés of Chinese musical style, such as the oriental riff, making use of the pentatonic scale, often harmonized with open parallel fourths.

== Literary criticism ==
The term is also used in literary criticism. The so-called &#x27;Mandarin style&#x27; &quot;is beloved by literary pundits, by those who would make the written word as unlike as possible to the spoken one&quot;. Critics also describe a mannered &quot;Chinese-esque&quot; style of writing, such as that employed by Ernest Bramah in his Kai Lung stories, Barry Hughart in his &quot;Master Li &amp; Number Ten Ox&quot; novels and Stephen Marley in his Chia Black Dragon series.

<doc id="1063808" wikidata="Q293265" url="?curid=1063808" title="Penny Fuller">
<text>Penny Fuller is an American actress. She received two Tony Award nominations for her performances on Broadway stage: for &quot;Applause&quot; (1970), and &quot;The Dinner Party&quot; (2001). For her television performances, Fuller received six Emmy Award nominations, winning once, in 1982, for playing Madge Kendal in &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;.

==Early life and family==
Fuller was born in Durham, North Carolina. She attended Lumberton High School and Northwestern University, where her teachers included Alvina Krause.

==Career==
Fuller moved to New York City, and in 1960 appeared at the East 74th Street Theater in George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Oh, Kay!&quot;, with Linda Lavin and Marti Stevens. She made her Broadway debut in &quot;The Moon Besieged&quot; (1962); she appeared as a replacement in the original productions of &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; (1963) and &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1966).

After a handful of Shakespearean productions, Fuller gained notice on Broadway for her portrayal of the outwardly sweet but subtly undermining Eve Harrington in &quot;Applause&quot; (1970–1972), the musical version of &quot;All About Eve&quot; with Lauren Bacall as Margo Channing. She started in Richard Rodgers&#x27; 1976 flop about Henry VIII, &quot;Rex&quot;, in which she appeared opposite Nicol Williamson and Glenn Close. Fuller continued to work in musicals, including the original production of William Finn&#x27;s &quot;A New Brain&quot; and a 1999 revival of Rodgers&#x27; &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz?&quot; at New Jersey&#x27;s George Street Playhouse. In later years, Fuller was also on Broadway in the original productions of Wendy Wasserstein&#x27;s &quot;An American Daughter&quot; (1997) and Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Dinner Party&quot; (2000); she was Tony-nominated for the latter. Off-Broadway appearances have included &quot;Three Viewings&quot; (1995) and Nicky Silver&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful Child&quot;. Most recently, appeared as the Old Lady/Blair Daniels in the 2017 revival of &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot; and as the Dowager Empress in &quot;Anastasia&quot;.

Fuller has extensive television work to her credit, including an Emmy-winning performance as Mrs. Kendal in the TV version of Bernard Pomerance&#x27;s play &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1982) and &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1984) by Tennessee Williams, in which she played Mae (a.k.a. Sister Woman). In 1992 she played Nancy McKeon&#x27;s mother Ruth Benson in the CBS movie &quot;Baby Snatcher&quot;.

Fuller portrayed Amanda Harding in the ABC crime drama &quot;Fortune Dane&quot; (1986). She also appeared in dozens of other TV series, including &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; (1964), &quot;Love, American Style&quot; (1969), &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; (1972), &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; (1972), &quot;Banacek&quot; (1973), &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; (1974), &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; (1975), &quot;Family&quot; (1977), &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot; (1979 and 1981), &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; (1983), &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (1983 and 1985), &quot;Matlock&quot; (1988), &quot;L.A. Law&quot; (1988), &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; (1988 and 1993), &quot;China Beach&quot; (1989–90), &quot;Columbo&quot; (1990), &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; (1992), &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; (1994), &quot;Mad About You&quot; (1994–95), &quot;Melrose Place&quot; (1994–95), &quot;ER&quot; (1995), &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (1998) and &quot;Judging Amy&quot; (2002 and 2005).

Her film work includes &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1993).

<doc id="1063810" wikidata="Q7033747" url="?curid=1063810" title="Night service (public transport)">
<text>Night service, sometimes also known as owl service, is a mode of public transport service operated during the night hours. As an intermediate approach – between providing full service around the clock and stopping services altogether – it provides more limited service during times of lower passenger volume, saving resources and allowing for maintenance on primary transportation systems. They typically offer fewer routes and less frequent service. Night-based services may be differently branded compared to daytime services. Examples are London and Chicago, where overnight buses are prefixed with an &quot;N&quot; for &quot;night&quot;. Another common way to distinguish night services from their daytime counterparts is dark-colored line numbers. Some cities apply a different fare structure for night services from their daytime services.

==Characteristics==

24-hour, continuous rapid transit operation is practiced in some cities, most notably the subway in New York City, which essentially renders night services unneeded. Many of New York City&#x27;s buses also have 24-hour operation; and around the world, night services may be provided by virtue of 24-hour services on daytime routes, as does Berlin on its &quot;Metrotram&quot; routes.

Where it exists, night service is generally much more limited in geographic coverage than daytime services, with fewer lines and perhaps routes over different paths from daytime services; routes serving more stops than during the daytime; or the night terminus may be in a different place. Networks may run longer routes than daytime services, sometimes combining two or more daytime routes, which may use interchanges to reach the same outlying districts. Night services usually also run less frequently. For example, according to the New York City Transit Authority&#x27;s Service Guidelines Manual, New York City buses are required to operate at least every 30 minutes all times except late nights. Local bus frequencies during late night times (defined as 1a.m. – 5a.m.) are required to operate at least every 60 minutes.

Because of much longer intervals between services than during the day, night routes often offer guaranteed transfers to other lines or transit modes (such as regional and intercity rail). To ease planning, many cities use a central hub where all lines converge at a specific time. This makes the line map of many night services look like a wheel with radial lines to the center and some additional lines connecting the outer ends (or running along a ring road outside of the city center). For example, many London night bus routes converge on Trafalgar Square.

Buses are identified by a number that refers to the bus route and a destination on its front sign. Also a &quot;BRS&quot; number that indicates which bus points the bus stops at. Due to the enormous number of buses running in Rio, the bus points are classified by a BRS number (from 1 to 6) and different buses stop at different bus points with the same BRS number.

**&quot;Old Woman&quot; (1916): &quot;The owl-car clatters along, dogged by the echo...&quot; 
**&quot;Blue Island Intersection&quot; (1922): &quot;The owl car blutters along in a sleep-walk.&quot; 
**&quot;Nights Nothings Again&quot; (1922): &quot;A taxi whizzes by, an owl car clutters, passengers yawn reading street signs...&quot;
*In act II, scene 2 of the Tennessee Williams play &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1947), Mitch tells Blanche how he&#x27;ll get home: &quot;I&#x27;ll walk over to Bourbon and catch an owl-car.&quot;
*The 1997 Swedish film &quot;Nattbuss 807&quot; depicts an incident in a night bus.

<text>Leon Paweł Teodor Marchlewski (: ; 15 December 1869 – 16 January 1946) was a Polish chemist, the first Director and Honorary Member of the Polish Chemical Society. He was one of the founders in the field of chlorophyll chemistry and a precursor of clinical chemistry. 

==Life and career==
He was born in 1869 in Włocławek, Congress Poland to father Józef Marchlewski, a merchant, and mother Emilia (&quot;née&quot; Rückersfeldt), a governess. His older brother was the communist activist Julian Marchlewski.

In 1888, he went to Zürich and studied chemistry at the ETH Zurich. In 1890, he became an assistant to Professor Georg Lunge. After two years, he earned his doctoral degree. He subsequently went to Kersel near Manchester where he became an assistant of Edward Schunck. In this period he collaborated with Marceli Nencki and conducted research on the chemical affinity of dyes of the animal and plant world.

Between 1896 and 1897, he was on a scientific scholarship granted for his research in the field of organic chemistry from the Kraków-based Academy of Learning (Polish: &quot;Akademia Umiejętności&quot;, AU). He also taught organic chemistry at the Institute of Science and Technology of the University of Manchester.

In 1900, he returned to Poland and obtained his habilitation on the basis of his thesis &quot;Die Chemie des Chlorophylls&quot; and lecture titled &quot;Dzisiejszy stan teoryi tautomeryi&quot;. In the years 1900–1906, he worked as a senior inspector at the General Department of Food Research in Kraków headed by Odo Bujwid. He also became a professor at the Jagiellonian University and served as the university&#x27;s rector between 1926–1927 and 1927–1928. From 1906 to 1939 he was Head of the Institute of Medicinal Chemistry. 

In 1917–1919, he established the National Scientific Institute of Agricultural Economy in Puławy. He was the first director of the Polish Chemical Society and served as the first director of YMCA in Poland.

His scientific work mostly focused on the areas of organic, inorganic and analytic chemistry as well as biochemistry. His scientific achievements include research on chlorophyll and the blood pigment hemoglobin, which demonstrated the similarity of chemical structures in plants and animals, indicating a common origin. 

He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1913 and 1914.

The illustration on the right is of his diplomatic passport he used in 1927 to attend an international conference on chemistry in Paris.

Marchlewski was also a long-time political activist in the Polish peasant movement. In December 1945, he became a member of the National Council, representing the Polish People&#x27;s Party. He died several days later and was buried at the Rakowicki Cemetery.

==Honours==
*Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (1925) 
*Gold Cross of Merit (1936)

<text>Władysław Natanson (1864–1937) was a Polish physicist.

==Life==
He came from a Jewish family of bankers, being the grandson of Samuel Natanson (1795–1879), the son of Ludwik Natanson (1821–1896), a physician, and Natalia Epstein. His brother was the industrialist Edward Natanson (1861–1940), father of physicist Ludwik Karol Natanson (1905–1992).

Natanson was head of Theoretical Physics at Kraków University from 1899 to 1935.

He published a series of papers on thermodynamically irreversible processes, gaining him recognition in the rapidly growing field. He was the first to consider the distinguishability of energy quanta in the statistical analysis of elementary processes, a precursor of the concept of quantum indistinguishability. He discovered a quantum statistics, rediscovered 11 years later by Satyendra Nath Bose and generalized by Albert Einstein though his derivation was not in terms of einstein&#x27;s light quanta aka photons – the Bose–Einstein statistics.

<text>Walter Michael Golaski (12 August 1913 – 22 September 1996) was an American Mechanical-Bio-Medical Engineer best known for developing Dense Knit Dacron Vascular Prostheses, which were the first practical artificial blood vessel replacements. Golaski died near Philadelphia in 1996 at the age of 83.

==Early life and education==
Golaski was born in Torrington, Connecticut in 1913 to Paul (né Golaszewski) and Helena (née Kulesza). His parents emigrated to the United States in 1906 from &quot;Golasie&quot;, a village in Poland. He had 5 siblings: Stephina, Tessie, Edmond, Edward, and Julius. At 16, during the Great Depression, he took a job as a needle mechanic at the Torrington Company, a knitting needle manufacturer, where he soon developed new ideas for the automatic needle manufacturing industry. In 1939, Torrington transferred him to Philadelphia and promoted him to manager, and he enrolled in Drexel University&#x27;s Mechanical Engineering evening school. He graduated in 1946; Drexel later honored him with many alumni awards.

==Inventions==
In 1940, Golaski developed a process for rebuilding hosiery machines to enable the knitting industry to make the switch from silk to nylon. In 1945 he opened the Bearing Products Company and with the profits later in 1956 bought and reorganized the Overbrook Knitting Corporation in order to convert existing machinery to produce full fashioned knitted sweaters. He was granted 10 American, 1 British and 2 Canadian patents.

Golaski is best known for the product he developed next, the densely knit Dacron arteries, which he sold through his company Golaski Laboratories. Until this invention, the available replacement blood vessels were stiff, woven, and not sufficiently porous. The Golaski graft offered patients longer life expectancy than any other on the market.

Golaski&#x27;s business flourished after his invention. He served as Chairman of the Kosciuszko Foundation, in &quot;which [he] encouraged the exchange of students and scholars between the United States and Poland.&quot; He helped show Poland in a positive light to America in that &quot;Americans of all ethnic backgrounds were encouraged to participate in the Foundation&#x27;s programs and experience Polish culture directly.&quot; 

==Personal life==
In 1942, Golaski married Helene Dolores Ambrose, (1915-1968). They had a daughter, Michelle Starr Helen. In her memory, he donated a painting, Young Lady at the Fireplace (Wladyslaw Czachorski, 1882) to the Kosciusko Foundation. He later married Alexandra Budna Golaski with whom he had three children, Alexandra, Johnpaul, and Edmund. His son, Johnpaul is a freelance sound mixer for the film industry.

== Legacy ==
On May 17, 2014, a historical marker was erected on Lancaster Walk in honor of Golaski, commemorating his achievement in medical engineering,

<doc id="1063878" wikidata="Q1269413" url="?curid=1063878" title="No. 303 Squadron RAF">
<text>No. 303 Squadron RAF, also known as the 303rd &quot;Tadeusz Kościuszko Warsaw&quot; Fighter Squadron, was one of two Polish squadrons that fought during the Battle of Britain along with No. 302 Squadron, of 16 total Polish squadrons during the Second World War. Flying Hawker Hurricanes, the squadron claimed the largest number of aircraft shot down of the 66 Allied fighter squadrons engaged in the Battle of Britain, even though it joined the fray two months after the battle had begun.

No. 303 Squadron RAF was formed in July 1940 in Blackpool, England before deployment to RAF Northolt on 2 August as part of an agreement between the Polish Government in Exile and the United Kingdom. It was disbanded in December 1946.

&quot;Had it not been for the magnificent material contributed by the Polish squadrons and their unsurpassed gallantry,&quot; wrote Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding, head of RAF Fighter Command, &quot;I hesitate to say that the outcome of the Battle (of Britain) would have been the same.&quot; 

==History==
No. 303 Squadron was based at RAF Northolt from 2 August 1940, and became operational on 31 August. Its initial cadre was 13 Officer and 8 NCO pilots and 135 Polish ground staff. At the outset, serving RAF officers were appointed to serve as CO (S/Ldr RG Kellett) and Flight Commanders (F/Lt JA Kent and F/Lt AS Forbes) alongside the Poles, as the Polish pilots were unfamiliar with RAF Fighter Command language, procedures and training.

The nickname chosen by the squadron was in honour of the famous 18th century Polish general Tadeusz Kościuszko. No. 303 Squadron was also linked to the original 1919 Kościuszko Escadrille through personnel that had served in that squadron. Later, further air force units from this unit were renamed the 7th, 121st and 111th Escadrilles of the Polish Air Force.

===Battle of Britain August–October 1940===
During the Battle of Britain, No. 303 Squadron was equipped with Hawker Hurricane fighter aircraft. Manned by experienced veterans, equipped with a fighter plane on a technical par with most of its opponents, and expertly backed by the well-established RAF command, communication, and logistics infrastructure, the squadron was able to become an effective fighting force during the Battle. After a period of training, the squadron was scrambled for the first time on 24 August 1940, although it did not come into contact with any enemy aircraft on this occasion. On 30 August 1940, the squadron scored its first victory while still officially non-operational, when a German Messerschmitt Bf 110 of 4./ZG 76 (initially incorrectly recorded as a Dornier Do 17) was shot down by F/O Ludwik Paszkiewicz during a training flight. The wreck was excavated in 1982. After S/L Kellett&#x27;s personal recommendation, the squadron was declared operational next day by No. 11 Group RAF.

On 31 August 1940, the squadron was scrambled in the late afternoon on its first operational sortie. In a dogfight over Kent, &quot;A&quot; Flight claimed four confirmed and two probable victories over Messerschmitt Bf 109s, possibly of LG 2. Claimants were S/Ldr Kellet, F/O Henneberg, P/O Ferić and Sgt. Karubin.

During 2 September 1940, the squadron was scrambled three times. On the last scramble, P/O Ferić shot down a Bf 109 and then made a forced landing near Dover while former Czechoslovak Air Force pilot Sgt. Josef František claimed a Bf 110. The following day over Dover, František claimed his second victory; with a total of 17 victories, he became one of the top-scoring Allied fighter pilots during the Battle of Britain. On 5 September, nine No. 303 Hurricanes intercepted a German bombing formation escorted by Bf 109s, with the Poles claiming five Bf 109s and three Junkers Ju 88s for one loss: P/O Łapkowski, who bailed out wounded.

On 6 September 1940, nine Hurricanes were scrambled towards incoming bomber formations. However, during the climb, they were bounced by Bf 109s of III./JG 27. S/Ldr Kellet and F/Lt Forbes both force-landed and were wounded slightly, while Sgt Karubin bailed out wounded, S/Ldr Krasnodębski was severely burned, and three other Hurricanes were damaged. The squadron claimed five Bf 109s (of JG 27 and JG 52), a Do 17 and a Heinkel He 111. F/O Witold Urbanowicz was appointed as acting Squadron Leader.

On 7 September 1940, the German air offensive switched to the London docks. No. 303 Squadron was successfully vectored towards the incoming bomber streams and claimed 12 Do 17s and two Bf 109s, with P/O Zumbach, P/O Ferić, Sgt. Szaposznikow and Sgt. Wójtowicz all scoring double victories. P/O Daszewski was shot down and seriously wounded, while F/O Pisarek bailed out. His Hurricane crashed in a back garden of a house in Loughton, killing a family of three in their shelter. Two other aircraft were damaged. On 9 September 1940, 12 Hurricanes were scrambled and two claims made over Bf 109s by Zumbach (both of JG 53) and one by František – a Bf 109 of 7./JG 27 – who also claimed a He 111 of KG 53 as a &quot;probable&quot;, while a Bf 110 was shot down by F/L Kent. Sgt. Kazimierz Wünsche had to bail out with burns over Beachy Head, and Sgt. František crash-landed.

At 16:00 hours on 11 September 1940, the squadron attacked a bomber formation south of London. F/O Cebrzyński was fatally wounded by return fire, and Sgt. Wójtowicz shot down two Messerschmitt Bf 110s before being shot down and killed. The pilots claimed two Bf 110s, one Bf 109, three Do 17s, and four He 111s.

In the massed dogfights over London on 15 September 1940, the squadron was heavily involved, with nine Hurricanes led by F/Lt Kent intercepting a German raid in mid-morning. Nine kills were claimed: six Bf 109s, one Bf 110 and two Do 17s. In the afternoon, a flight formation led by S/Ldr Kellet claimed four victories, while the five-strong &quot;B&quot; Flight led by F/O Urbanowicz, claimed two Do 17s, for two Polish pilots shot down (Sgt. Brzezowski killed, Sgt Andruszków bailed out while P/O Łokuciewski was wounded in the leg, returning to base safely). During the day, No. 303 Squadron claimed 15 victories.

On the afternoon of 26 September 1940, No. 303 Squadron was scrambled towards a large enemy raid over Hampshire, with the Poles claiming 13 victories for three Hurricanes damaged (actual &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; losses were nine in total). There was further intense fighting on 27 September 1940, with 11 Hurricanes engaged by massed escorts to a KG 77 30-bomber formation. The squadron claimed 15 victories: six Bf 109s, two Bf 110s of LG 1, four &quot;He 111s&quot; (probably Ju 88s) and three Ju 88s. F/O Paszkiewicz and Sgt Andruszków were killed. F/O Żak was wounded and bailed out over Horsham; four Hurricanes were lost in total. Just six aircraft were serviceable during the afternoon, engaging a raid of 15 Ju 88s. Two bombers were brought down before the escort intervened, and a Bf 109 was also claimed. F/O Urbanowicz claimed four German aircraft during the day. On 30 September 1940, F/O Urbanowicz once again claimed four victories, while a Do 17 was brought down by P/O. Radomski, who bailed out, as did Sgt. Bełc, while Sgt. Karubin claimed a Bf 109.

On 5 October 1940, Polish pilots claimed five Bf 110s and four Bf 109s, though P/O Wojciech Januszewicz was killed. (&quot;Erprobungsgruppe 210&quot; lost two Bf 110s &quot;Jabos&quot; and JG 3 and JG 53, a Bf 109 each). A fight over the Thames Estuary on 7 October saw claims for three Bf 109s of LG 2. On 8 October, Czech ace Josef František died in an air crash. He was the highest-scoring pilot of 303 Squadron and the fourth-highest scoring ace in the Battle of Britain, with 17 claims. On 11 October 1940, the squadron was transferred for a rest to Leconfield in No. 12 Group, ending its participation in the Battle of Britain.

No. 303 Squadron claimed the largest number of aircraft shot down of the 66 Allied fighter squadrons engaged in the Battle of Britain, even though it joined the fray two months after the battle had begun.

Its success in combat can be mainly attributed to the years of extensive and rigorous pre-war training many of the long-serving Polish veterans had received in their homeland, far more than many of their younger and inexperienced RAF comrades then being thrown into the fray, as well as the many kills credited to the non-Polish pilots in the squadron. Tactics and skill also played a role; on one occasion, No. 303&#x27;s Sgt Stanislaw Karubin resorted to extreme tactics to bring down a German fighter: following a prolonged air battle, Karubin was chasing a German fighter at treetop level. As he closed in on the tail of the German fighter, Karubin realised that his Hurricane had run out of ammunition. Rather than turning back to base, he closed the distance and climbed right above the German fighter. The German pilot was so shocked to see the underside of the Hurricane within arm&#x27;s reach of his cockpit that he instinctively reduced his altitude to avoid a collision and crashed into the ground.
At the time it was withdrawn from battle for a rest on 11 October 1940, the squadron had claimed 126 kills in six weeks. Relative to enemy aircraft downed, Polish losses were small with 18 Hurricanes lost, seven pilots killed and five badly wounded. 
303 Squadron was one of the top fighter units in the battle and the best Hurricane-equipped one.
It also had the highest kill-to-loss ratio, 2.8:1. However, J. Alcorn was not able to attribute 30 aircraft shot down to any particular unit, and according to Jerzy Cynk and other Polish historians, the actual number of victories for No. 303 Squadron was about 55–60. According to Polish historian Jacek Kutzner, the verified number of kills of 303 Squadron is around 58.8, which would still place it above all other squadrons for verified kills. This is presented by Kutzner&#x27;s chart, which shows Polish confirmed kills (left column), confirmed kills of all Allied squadrons, including Polish (central column) and real German losses on each day when No. 303 Squadron was involved in air combat (right column). In its first seven days of combat, the squadron claimed nearly 40 enemy aircraft.

===War over Europe 1941===

By 1941, the immediate threat to the UK was over and RAF Fighter Command formulated more offensive fighter operations over occupied Europe. One of these was codenamed &quot;Rhubarb&quot;, improvised low-level strafing attacks against opportunist targets on the ground. No. 303 flew its first &quot;Rhubarb&quot;&#x27; sorties on 22 January 1941. Six Hurricanes led by F/L Henneberg attacked 1./JG 26&#x27;s airfield at Crecy, killing one ground crewman and destroying two Bf 109s, also wounding a pilot.

In late January 1941, the squadron converted to the Supermarine Spitfire Mk I. In February, the unit participated in the first fighter offensive sweeps, usually escorting a small number of light bombers.

In early April 1941, No. 306 (Polish) Squadron arrived at Northolt, and with No. 303 formed No. 1 Polish Fighter Wing. No. 601 Squadron RAF, also stationed at Northolt, complemented the two Polish units. The Wing was commanded by W/C Johnny Kent with W/C Urbanowicz. On 12 April 1941, six No. 303 Spitfires led by S/L Henneberg carried out a series of strafing attacks on German airfields. S/L Henneberg&#x27;s Spitfire IIa (P8029) was hit by flak and the pilot had to ditch in the channel; despite an intensive search and rescue operation, he was never found. On 11 April 1941, F/L Kustrzyński shot down a Bf 109 during a rhubarb over France.

On 16 April 1941, the Polish Wing flew its first &quot;Circus&quot; escort operation. Engaged by Bf 109s, two Poles were lost: P/O Waszkiewicz and P/O Mierzwa. On 18 June 1941, No. 303 pilots claimed four Bf 109s without loss; two to P/O Drobiński, as RAF Fighter Command claimed 10 destroyed (The Jagdwaffe suffered no losses). On 21 June, Drobiński badly damaged the Bf 109F-2 of &quot;Oberst&quot; Adolf Galland, CO of JG 26, who made a forced landing at Calais, while W/C Kent downed Fw. Hegenauer (Galland&#x27;s wingman).

On 22 June 1941, Fighter Command optimistically claimed 29 fighters shot down, No. 303 claiming six of these, two to S/L Lapkowski (JG 2 and JG 26 actually lost three aircraft). On 23 June 1941, No. 303 flew two full strength escort missions over France, and against 9./ JG 2 claimed five fighters destroyed. P/O &#x27;Mike&#x27; Bolesław Gładych claimed three confirmed but was wounded and managed to crash land in the UK. JG 2 lost six Bf 109s and four pilots. On 28 June, No. 303 claimed another four Bf 109s, although P/O J. Bondar was shot down and killed by &quot;Uzz.&quot; Babenz, 3./JG 26. Fighter Command claimed six kills (JG 26 lost two, with three more badly damaged).

On 2 July 1941, No. 1 Polish Wing, with No. 303, engaged some 60 Bf 109s over Lille. No. 303 claimed four kills, (JG 2 lost three Bf 109s), but the squadron lost S/L Łapkowski killed, while Sgt Górecki had to bail out and was rescued from the channel. Command passed to S/L Arentowicz, who himself was shot down and killed just six days later. He was replaced by F/L Jankiewicz. After five months of operations, No. 303 was rested on 13 July, moving to Speke near Liverpool, in 9 Group, Fighter Command.

On 7 October 1941, the squadron returned to Northolt and re-equipped with the Spitfire Mk Vb. Its opponents now included the formidable Focke-Wulf Fw 190, and on 13 October camera gun film from a No. 303 pilot gave the RAF the first photographic evidence of the new fighter. As winter approached, poor weather reduced operations significantly. However, on 24 October, No. 303 claimed four fighters shot down over Gravelines.

During combat operations throughout 1941, No. 303 Squadron claimed some 46 enemy aircraft destroyed, seven probably destroyed and four damaged, for a loss of nine pilots (including three Commanding Officers). Some 20 Spitfires were written off or lost in action.

===1942===

After a quiet start to the year, on 12 February 1942, No. 303 Squadron participated in the RAF&#x27;s offensive response to the &#x27;Channel Dash&#x27; of the German battleships &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot;. Led by W/C Rolski, the Polish Wing flew several sorties in bad weather.

On 13 March 1942, the Squadron lost F/Lt W Łokuciewski, shot down by JG 26 and taken prisoner, and on 4 April F/L Daszewski (killed) and F/L Kustrzyński (POW) were lost over Saint-Omer having shot down two Fw 190 fighters. F/L Kustrzyński was taken prisoner while still sitting in the cockpit of his crash-landed Spitfire because his back was badly injured and he could not move. He was later transferred to Colditz Castle POW camp and ultimately to Stalag Luft III Sagan for continually trying to escape. He finally made a successful escape with RAF fighter ace, W/C Robert Stanford Tuck, and they were repatriated back to Britain by Russian military authorities who found them after they had walked across Poland following their escape.

During the spring of 1942, the frequency of offensive sorties increased and by May, No. 303 flew over the Channel daily, in numerous &quot;Circus&quot; escort missions and fighter sweeps. It engaged German fighters on numerous occasions, although JG 2 and JG 26, the main fighter units against Fighter Command, took an increasing toll utilising the superior Fw 190A. In early June, the unit flew sixteen squadron-strength sorties, in addition to numerous air-sea rescue, interception and convoy escort missions. On 5 June 1942, the squadron engaged Fw 190 fighters and claimed three for no loss. The squadron was rested on 15 June, relocating to Kirton in Lindsey in Lincolnshire.

On 15 August 1942, the squadron temporarily moved to Redhill near London in preparation of the Allied raid on Dieppe (Operation Jubilee). No. 303 was to fly with No. 317 Polish Fighter Squadron and four other squadrons. Covering the naval and ground forces, No. 303 Squadron claimed the highest number of aircraft shot down of all Allied squadrons participating. No. 303 then returned to Kirton in Lindsey, where it remained until March 1943.

No. 303 Squadron claimed 21 enemy aircraft destroyed in 1942, losing 10 pilots: four killed in action, two in accidents and four taken prisoner.

===1943===
In early June 1943, the unit returned once again to Northolt, and No. 1 Polish Wing. The squadron converted to the new Spitfire Mk IX and in June resumed operations. On 9 June 1943, F/O Śliwinski claimed the unit&#x27;s 200th victory, a Fw 190. On 14 June 1943, Sgt. Pilot Józef Dąbrowski died on an interception practice when his aircraft crashed into the ground at Islington Cemetery, Finchley. On 24 June, both P/O Karcmarz and P/O Kobyliński were downed by 10./JG 26 pilots and made POWs.

In July 1943, S/L Falkowski replaced S/L Bieńkowski. On 6 July, the squadron, led by F/L Majewski and with No. 316 Squadron over Amiens, fought a prolonged dogfight with Fw 190s with No. 303 claiming three German fighters from JG 2 and JG 27 without loss. By this time, much of No. 303&#x27;s work was escort missions for the increasing numbers of United States Army Air Forces Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber missions over Europe. During escort cover for the ill-fated Schweinfurt mission on 17 August 1943, No. 303 claimed a further three fighters downed. On a 6 September &quot;Ramrod&quot; mission, the squadron claimed another six fighters destroyed.

On 12 November 1943, the unit was posted to RAF Ballyhalbert in Northern Ireland and soon after S/L Koc assumed command. The squadron flew convoy patrols and carried out operational training. By the end of 1943, No. 303 Squadron had claimed 203 enemy aircraft destroyed, 40 probables, and 25 damaged.

===1944===
In April 1944, the squadron moved to the advanced landing ground at Horne, 30 miles south of London and joined No 142 Fighter Wing. The unit began flying escort sorties for bombing missions against V-1 flying bomb facilities. On 21 May the squadron strafed targets near Lille losing two pilots: F/O Brzeski and Sgt Kempka were shot down and taken prisoner. Next day Sgt Bartkowiak was also lost though he evaded capture and returned to the unit four months later.

For Operation Overlord (the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944) the squadron was equipped with the Spitfire V LF operating from a temporary airfield at Horne, Surrey as part of Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB), though under the operational control of RAF Second Tactical Air Force. On D-Day, 303 flew several times over the landing beaches. After D-Day, the squadron remained with ADGB. With the commencement of the V-1 offensive on London, on 19 June 1944, No. 303 moved to RAF Westhampnett and then to RAF Merston. In June, F/S Chudek (nine kills) was shot down and killed. On 18 July, the unit went back to Westhampnett and received new Spitfire Mk IXs. Any Luftwaffe fighter opposition now remained largely absent from the Squadron&#x27;s sphere of operations, but flak defences still took a toll. On 26 September S/L Drobinski replaced S/L Koc, and No. 303 continued using its Spitfires on various ground attack missions on V-1 and V-2 launch sites located in the Netherlands.

===1945===
In 1945, 303 Squadron moved to RAF Coltishall in Norfolk, East Anglia, for operations over the Netherlands. During 1945, 303 Squadron continued to operate over the Netherlands. On 3 April, the squadron joined 133 Squadron at Andrews Field, and was re-equipped with the North American Mustang Mk. IV. On 25 April 1945, 303 Squadron made its last wartime operational sortie, escorting Avro Lancasters in a raid on Berchtesgaden.

===Postwar===
No. 303 Squadron was the most effective Polish RAF squadron during the Second World War. Some sources state that its pilots were invited to the London Victory Parade of 1946, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that it was the only representative of the Polish Armed Forces in the West. The invitation was refused because no other Polish units were invited. However, according to other sources No. 303 Squadron was not invited and so could not have refused the invitation. After the end of the war, squadron morale decreased due to the treatment of Poland by the Allies (Western betrayal of Poland), and the squadron was eventually disbanded in December 1946. After the war, they were honoured by the erection of the Polish War Memorial in West London, listing the names of all Polish pilots who served in the RAF.

In 2022, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine for a second time, the number &quot;303&quot; was chosen by a group of Polish internet activists to name their Squad 303 which sends anti-war messages to individual Russians.

==In popular culture==
The squadron was the subject of the 1942 book &quot;Squadron 303&quot;, written by the Polish writer Arkady Fiedler, which is considered the most popular among this writer&#x27;s many works and has sold over 1.5 million copies.

Because the book was published during the war, in order to protect the Polish airmen and their families remaining in occupied Poland from German reprisals, Fiedler used pseudonyms for the airmen of 303 Squadron. This practice was mandated in a memo regarding confidential information issued by the Air Ministry dated Oct. 14, 1949. In connection with the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in 2010, a new English translation was commissioned by publisher Aquila Polonica at the request of Fiedler&#x27;s son. 303 Squadron: The Legendary Battle of Britain Fighter Squadron is the first new English-language edition of Dywizjon 303 since 1942, and for the first time in English identifies the pilots by their true names.

In 2010, the squadron&#x27;s involvement in the Battle of Britain was featured in the dramatised documentary &quot;The Polish Battle of Britain&quot; produced by Hardy Pictures for the Channel 4 series &quot;Bloody Foreigners&quot;. Channel Four also made a game called &quot;Battle of Britain: 303 Squadron&quot;.

303 Squadron was the subject of the 2018 films &quot;Hurricane&quot; and &quot;303 Squadron&quot;.

303 Squadron is referenced in the first chorus of the Sabaton song Aces in Exile.

Museum 303 in Napoleon, Silesia Province, Poland is dedicated to No. 303 Squadron.

<text>XEDIT is a visual editor for VM/CMS using block mode IBM 3270 terminals. (Line-mode terminals are also supported.)


XEDIT is much more line-oriented than modern PC and Unix editors. For example, XEDIT supports automatic line numbers, and many of the commands operate on blocks of lines. A pair of features allows selective line and column editing. The &quot;ALL&quot; command, for example, hides all lines not matching the described pattern, and the COL (Column) command allows hiding those columns not specified. Hence changing, for example, the word NO as it appears only in columns 24 thru 28, to YES, and only on lines with the word FLEXIBLE, is doable.

Another feature is a &quot;command line&quot; which allows the user to type arbitrary editor commands. Because IBM 3270 terminals do not transmit data to the computer until certain special keys are pressed [such as , a program function key (PFK), or a program access key (PAK)], XEDIT is less interactive than many PC and Unix editors. For example, continuous spell-checking as the user types is problematic.

==Typical screen layout==

 MOHICANS SCRIPT A1 V 132 Trunc=132 Size=10 Line=10 Col=1 Alt=10
XEDIT:
===== Last of the Mohicans
===== .sp
===== It was a feature peculiar to the colonial wars of North America,
===== that the toils and dangers of the wilderness were to be encountered
===== before the adverse hosts could meet.
===== A wide and apparently an impervious boundary of forests severed
===== the possessions of the hostile provinces of France and England.
===== The hardy colonist, and the trained European who fought at his
===== side, frequently expended months in struggling against the rapids
===== of the streams, or in effecting the rugged passes of the mountains
|...+...1...+...2...+...3...+...4...+...5...+...6...+...7...
===== * * * End of File * * *
 X E D I T 1 File
Notable features of the screen layout:
*The top line provides details about line format where:
**   is the filename
**   is the filetype
**   is the filemode (default, indicating which disk the file is on)
**   is the record format (RECFM) which can be Fixed or Variable
**   is the length of the records (for V, maximum length is 65535)
**   indicates changes beyond 132 columns will be ignored
**   denotes total number of lines in file
**   denotes the current line
**   denotes the current column
**   indicates that ten changes have been made while XEDITing
*The equal signs codice_1 at the beginning of the lines provide space for line numbers if desired, and a place to enter XEDIT prefix commands that may operate on blocks of lines.
*The line beginning |...+ is a ruler that e.g. might show tabulator positions.
*The following line marks end-of-file, appearing in XEDIT as if it followed the last actual line of the file.
*The next-to-bottom line showing codice_2 is a command line for entering XEDIT or system (CP/CMS) commands or macros.
*There is no mouse pointer because most IBM 3270 terminals did not have mice.
*Most IBM 3270 terminals had 12 or 24 program function keys (PFKs) (and also two or three program assist keys), to which XEDIT commands or macros could be assigned.
*XEDIT commands can be used to change the screen appearance. Some examples include:
**Moving the position of (or eliminating) the command line
**Moving the position of (or eliminating) the TABS marker line
**Moving the position of (or eliminating) the PREFIX lines
**Changing the prefix line from equal signs (codice_1) to line numbers (nnnnn)
**Defining whether or not TAB characters are to be expanded
**Defining which lines are to be displayed by scope (SELECT)
**Showing the data on a display screen or in typewriter mode
**Specifying text line(s) to be displayed on the screen (RESERVED)
**Eliminating the TOFEOF lines ( and )
**Displaying (or eliminating) SHADOW lines (indications that lines are not being displayed)
**Displaying (or eliminating) the SCALE line (a scale or ruler to assist editing)
**Changing the background and foreground colors used for the different portions of the screen
**Defining what lines are to be displayed (RANGE)
**Defining what columns are to be displayed (and also, if in hexadecimal, text, or both)
**Defining multiple XEDIT screens [sizes, location (over/under, side by side, combinations)]

==Macro language==
XEDIT macros (scripts) can be written in Rexx, ooRexx, EXEC 2, or EXEC.
XEDIT exposes the majority of its internal state to the macro environment, allowing macros to easily read and set internal variables that control its operation.

===KEXX===
KEDIT 5 for DOS and OS/2 supports an external Rexx interpreter (native OS/2 Rexx or Quercus Rexx, for DOS only Quercus Rexx replacing the older Mansfield Rexx) and its own rather limited KEXX subset. KEDITW 1.6.1 for Windows supports only its own internal KEXX 5.62 version of the Rexx language. Macros can be arranged in the codice_4 file format.

==History==
XEDIT was written by IBM employee Xavier de Lamberterie and was first released in 1980.
Its predecessor was EDIT SP (SP is an initialism for &quot;System Product&quot; used by IBM). Other key influences were EDIT, the older editor for CMS, and EDGAR, an IBM Program Product editor for CMS. XEDIT supported many of the EDGAR commands, SOS (Screen Output Simulation) being a major one. XEDIT also supported EXEC 2, the predecessor of Rexx.

==PC and Unix adaptations==

When PCs and Unix computers began to supplant IBM 3270 terminals, some users wanted text editors that resembled the XEDIT they were accustomed to. To fill this need, several developers provided similar programs:

===KEDIT===

KEDIT by Mansfield Software Group, Inc., was the first XEDIT clone. Although originally released in 1983, the first major release was version 3.53 for DOS, released in 1985. By 1990, KEDIT 4.0 had a version supporting OS/2, and included the ALL command.

The last version for DOS and OS/2 was KEDIT 5.0p4. KeditW (for Windows) is at version 1.6.1 dated December 2012. Some earlier Windows versions were:
* Release being 1.5 service level 3, dated January 1998
* Version 1.6, dated December 2007 

KEDIT 1.6 supports syntax highlighting for various languages including C#, COBOL, FORTRAN, HTML, Java, Pascal, and xBase defined in the codice_5 file format.

KEDIT supports a built-in Rexx-subset called KEXX. Mansfield Software created the first non-IBM implementation of Rexx (&quot;Personal Rexx&quot;) in 1985.

In December 2012 Mansfield Software released 1.6.1 to provide compatibility with Windows 8 and extended support to at least June . These 32bit versions work also in the 64bit versions of Windows 7 and Vista, but do not directly support Unicode. As of December 2022, Kedit supports Windows 10 and 11 too, and Mansfield promises email support until at least June 2024.

===SEDIT===
SEDIT (first released in 1989) is another implementation on both Windows and Unix, which supports a variant of Rexx language called S/REXX (announced in 1994).

===THE (The Hessling Editor)===
The Hessling Editor (THE) is an open source text editor first released in , released under the GPL-2.0-or-later license, and available for many operating systems including QNX, OS/2, DOS, BeOS, Amiga, Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP and most or all POSIX Unix platforms (as a program for text-mode or native X11). THE is a derivation of the IBM Mainframe VM/CMS editor XEDIT that includes support for versions of the REXX scripting language, and takes some features from KEDIT. THE was written in C with PDCurses also required for some platforms. A REXX interpreter such as Regina is also required for THE&#x27;s REXX macro capability.

THE&#x27;s author, Mark Hessling, discussed at the 1993 REXX conference in La Jolla, California why he created a new multi-platform text editor.

<text>A visual editor is computer software for editing text files using a textual or graphical user interface that normally renders the content (text) in accordance with embedded markup code, e.g., HTML, Wikitext, rather than displaying the raw text. Edits made to the page appear in , correctly formatted, and are often referred to as WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). It is common for the software to permit switching to source-code editor mode so that the original source code can be viewed or modified.

By definition, all visual editors require a refreshable display device. However, some editors using such devices, e.g., BRIEF, ISPF, gVim, KEDIT, THE, XEDIT, are not visual editors.

<text>Hilary Koprowski (5 December 191611 April 2013) was a Polish virologist and immunologist active in the United States who demonstrated the world&#x27;s first effective live polio vaccine. He authored or co-authored over 875 scientific papers and co-edited several scientific journals.

Koprowski received many academic honors and national decorations, including the Belgian Order of the Lion, the French Order of Merit and Legion of Honour, Finland&#x27;s Order of the Lion, and the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland.

Koprowski was the target of accusations in the press related to the &quot;oral polio vaccine AIDS hypothesis&quot;, which posited that the AIDS pandemic originated from live polio vaccines such as Koprowski&#x27;s. This allegation was refuted by evidence showing that the human immunodeficiency virus was introduced to humans before his polio-vaccine trials were conducted in Africa. The case was settled out of court with a formal apology from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

==Life==
Hilary Koprowski was born in Warsaw to an educated, assimilated Jewish family. His parents met in 1906 when Paweł Koprowski (1882–1957) was serving in the Imperial Russian Army, and moved to Warsaw soon after their marriage in 1912. His mother Sonia (née Berland; 1883–1967), was a dentist from Berdichev. Hilary Koprowski attended Warsaw&#x27;s Mikołaj Rej Secondary School, and from age twelve he took piano lessons at the Warsaw Conservatory. He received a medical degree from Warsaw University in 1939. He also received music degrees from the Warsaw Conservatory and, in 1940, from the Santa Cecilia Conservatory in Rome. He adopted scientific research as his life&#x27;s work, but never gave up music and composed several musical works. In July 1938, while in medical school, Koprowski married Irena Grasberg.

In 1939, after Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland, Koprowski and his wife, likewise a physician, fled the country, using Koprowski family business connections in Manchester, England. Hilary went to Rome, where he spent a year studying piano at the Santa Cecilia Conservatory; while Irena went to France, where she gave birth to their first child, Claude Koprowski, and worked as an attending physician at a psychiatric hospital.

As the invasion of France loomed in 1940, Irena and the infant escaped from France via Spain and Portugal —where the Koprowski family reunited — to Brazil, where Koprowski worked in Rio de Janeiro for the Rockefeller Foundation. His field of research for several years was finding a live-virus vaccine against yellow fever. After World War II the Koprowskis settled in Pearl River, New York, where Hilary was hired as a researcher for Lederle Laboratories, the pharmaceutical division of American Cyanamid. Here he began his polio experiments, which ultimately led to the creation of the first oral polio vaccine. Koprowski served as director of the Wistar Institute, 1957–91, during which period Wistar achieved international recognition for its vaccine research and became a National Cancer Institute Cancer Center.

Koprowski died on April 11, 2013, aged 96, in Wynnewood, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, of pneumonia. He and his wife are buried at West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Southlawn Section, Lot 782, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

Hilary Koprowski and his late wife had two sons. Their first child Claude (born in Paris, 1940), who died in 2020, was a retired physician. Their second son, Christopher (born 1951) is a retired physician certified in two specialties, neurology and radio-oncology. He is also the former chair of the department of radiation oncology at Christiana Hospital in Delaware.

==Polio vaccine==
While at Lederle Laboratories, Koprowski created an early polio vaccine, based on an orally administered attenuated polio virus. In researching a potential polio vaccine, he had focused on live viruses that were attenuated (rendered non-virulent) rather than on killed viruses (the latter became the basis for the injected vaccine subsequently developed by Jonas Salk).

Koprowski viewed the live vaccine as more powerful, since it entered the intestinal tract directly and could provide lifelong immunity, whereas the Salk vaccine required booster shots. Also, administering a vaccine by mouth is easy, whereas an injection requires medical facilities and is more expensive.

Koprowski developed his polio vaccine by attenuating the virus in brain cells of a cotton rat, &quot;Sigmodon hispidus&quot;, a New World species that is susceptible to polio. He administered the vaccine to himself in January 1948 and, on 27 February 1950, to 20 children at Letchworth Village, a home for disabled persons in Rockland County, New York. Seventeen of the 20 children developed antibodies to polio virus — the other three apparently already had antibodies — and none of the children developed complications. Within 10 years, the vaccine was being used on four continents.

Albert Sabin&#x27;s early work with attenuated-live-virus polio vaccine was developed from attenuated polio virus that Sabin had received from Koprowski.

==Rabies vaccine==
In addition to his work on the polio vaccine, Koprowski (along with Stanley Plotkin and Tadeusz Wiktor) did significant work on an improved vaccine against rabies. The group developed the HDCV rabies vaccine in the 1960s at the Wistar Institute. It was licensed for use in the United States in 1980.

==Affiliations==
Koprowski was president of Biotechnology Foundation Laboratories, Inc, and head of the Center for Neurovirology at Thomas Jefferson University. In 2006 he was awarded a record 50th grant from the National Institutes of Health. He authored or co-authored over 875 scientific papers and co-edited several scientific journals. He served as a consultant to the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization.

==Honors and legacy==
Koprowski received many honorary degrees, academic honors, and national decorations, including the Order of the Lion from the King of Belgium, the French Order of Merit for Research and Invention, a Fulbright Scholarship, and appointment as Alexander von Humboldt Professor at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry in Munich. In 1989 he received the San Marino Award for Medicine and the Nicolaus Copernicus Medal of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw.

Koprowski received numerous honors in Philadelphia, including the Philadelphia Cancer Research Award, the John Scott Award and, in May 1990, the most prestigious honor of his home city, the Philadelphia Award. He was a Fellow of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, which in 1959 presented him with its Alvarenga Prize.

Koprowski was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America. He held foreign membership in the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts, the Polish Academy of Sciences, the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, and the Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters.

On June 3, 1983, Koprowski received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Medicine at Uppsala University, Sweden.

On 22 March 1995, Koprowski was made a Commander of Finland&#x27;s Order of the Lion by Finland&#x27;s president. On 13 March 1997 he received the Legion d&#x27;Honneur from the French government. On 29 September 1998 he was presented by Poland&#x27;s president with the Grand Cross of Poland&#x27;s Order of Merit.

On 25 February 2000 Koprowski was honored with a reception at Philadelphia&#x27;s Thomas Jefferson University celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first administration of his oral polio vaccine. At the reception, he received commendations from the United States Senate, the Pennsylvania Senate, and Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge.

On 13 September 2004, Koprowski was presented with the Pioneer in NeuroVirology Award by the International Society for NeuroVirology at the 6th International Symposium on NeuroVirology held in Sardinia. On 1 May 2007, Koprowski was awarded the Albert Sabin Gold Medal by the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Baltimore, Maryland.

In 2014 Drexel University established the Hilary Koprowski Prize in Neurovirology in honor of Dr. Koprowski&#x27;s contributions to the field of neurovirology. The prize is awarded annually in conjunction with the International Symposium on Molecular Medicine and Infectious Disease, which is sponsored by the Institute for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Disease (IMMID) within the Drexel University College of Medicine. During the Symposium, the prize recipient is asked to deliver an honorary lecture.

==AIDS accusation==
British journalist Edward Hooper publicized a hypothesis that Koprowski&#x27;s research into a polio vaccine in the Belgian Congo in the late 1950s might have caused AIDS.

The OPV AIDS hypothesis has, however, been rejected by the medical community and is contradicted by at least one article in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, which claims the HIV-1 group M virus originated in Africa 30 years before the OPV trials were conducted. The journal &quot;Science&quot; refuted Hooper&#x27;s claims, writing: &quot;[I]t can be stated with almost complete certainty that the large polio vaccine trial... was not the origin of AIDS.&quot;

Koprowski rejected the claim, based on his own analysis. In a separate court case, he won a regretful clarification, and a symbolic award of $1 in damages, in a defamation suit against &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which had published an article repeating similar false allegations. A concurrent defamation lawsuit that Koprowski brought against the Associated Press was settled several years later; the settlement&#x27;s terms were not publicly disclosed.

Koprowski&#x27;s original reports from 1960 to 1961 detailing part of his vaccination campaign in the Belgian Congo are available online from the World Health Organization.

<doc id="1063892" wikidata="Q1495884" url="?curid=1063892" title="Gatwick Airport railway station">
<text>Gatwick Airport railway station is on the Brighton Main Line in West Sussex, England. It serves Gatwick Airport, down the line from via . The platforms are about to the east of the airport&#x27;s South Terminal, with the ticket office above the platforms and station entrances and exits directly connected to the terminal. The station is also connected to the airport&#x27;s North Terminal by the Airport Shuttle people-mover. Gatwick Airport is the busiest station in South East England region (which excludes London) as of the 2023-24 usage statistics. There have been two stations at Gatwick, sited about from each other. It is the busiest station in both West Sussex and South East England, and the sixth busiest station in the UK outside of London.

The first railway station, &quot;Gatwick&quot;, opened in September 1891. In 1946, it was renamed &quot;Gatwick Racecourse&quot;, to reflect its association with the neighbouring Gatwick Racecourse, but fell out of use for a decade after the opening of Tinsley Green station, which was renamed &quot;Gatwick Airport&quot; in September 1935. The stations had a reversal of fortunes in the 1950s as a result of a government decision to expand and develop the Beehive airport terminal into London&#x27;s second airport. Gatwick Racecourse station was rebuilt to serve Gatwick Airport, and is integrated into its terminal. On 27 May 1958, the rebuilt station, which took over the name &quot;Gatwick Airport&quot;, was opened in conjunction with a regular train service; and services to Tinsley Green were discontinued. This made Gatwick Airport railway station the first in the UK to directly serve an airport.

Train services are provided by Southern, Gatwick Express, Thameslink and Great Western Railway. When viewed from the air (or in satellite imagery), the station&#x27;s British Rail logo etched on the roof is visible. Between late 2010 and early 2014, new facilities were built at the station, among them platform 7; infrastructure was renewed and the concourse was refurbished. The station was one of 18 managed by Network Rail, but, in 2012, management was transferred to Southern. In May 2018, the station was named as the second-least popular major station in the UK.

==History==
===Gatwick/Gatwick Racecourse Station===
In September 1891, &quot;Gatwick station&quot; was constructed on the present site to serve Gatwick Racecourse, but operated only on race days. The facilities included passing loops and sidings, which enabled race trains to be held without impeding regular traffic on the Brighton Main Line. During the First World War, the sidings were extended to accommodate munitions trains heading for Newhaven.

In 1946, Gatwick station was renamed &quot;Gatwick Racecourse&quot; until 1958. The station had fallen out of regular use after the opening of nearby &quot;Tinsley Green/Gatwick Airport Station&quot;. In the early 1950s, the airport was expanded over land formerly occupied by the racecourse, and it was decided to rebuild the station. The station was integrated into the airport terminal via an upper level concourse designed by British Rail Southern Region. On 27 May 1958, the rebuilt station, &quot;Gatwick Airport&quot;, opened with a regular train service.

===Tinsley Green/Gatwick Airport Station===

On 30 September 1935 Tinsley Green station was opened south of the present station. Within a year it was renamed &quot;Gatwick Airport&quot;, following the completion of the Beehive airport terminal, which had a direct subway connection to the station. In 1940, the airport was requisitioned by the Royal Air Force (RAF) for military use. In 1952, the government decided to expand the airport as London&#x27;s second airport. The station continued in operation until 27 May 1958 when the new Gatwick Airport station (above) opened. The old station was later demolished. The only visible remains of the old station are sections of the former up slow line platform and sections of the subway between the station and the original terminal building.

===Present station===
The 1958 facilities included a parcels office beneath the main concourse, lifts and a corridor on the south side of the overbridge, separated from the passenger corridor by a glazed partition. To accommodate trains of up to 12-carriage lengths, the three old Racecourse island platforms were raised by and extended to the north by about , except for the very long westernmost platform, which was reduced from the south. The ticket office on the main concourse of the station was able to handle 670 separate issues of Edmondson tickets from its Bellmatic equipment. The signalbox was retained on the centre platform. In the 1980s, the station was refurbished. The station had six platforms immediately beneath the airport&#x27;s South Terminal.

The ticket office is staffed for ticket sales and enquiries, supplemented by ticket machines capable of handling online bookings usually available on a round-the-clock basis. Automated teller machines, payphones and e-mail access points are installed on the main concourse. There are coin-operated trolleys for luggage and a left luggage facility. On-site food and drink outlets are present. Toilets are available and baby changing facilities and additional toilets can be found in the adjacent South Terminal. There is no car parking facility. Transport for London&#x27;s (TfL) Oyster cards and contactless cards are accepted for travel at the station.

==Redevelopment==
On 13 October 2010, a £53 million redevelopment programme was announced to provide another platform capable of accommodating 12-car trains, refurbishment of the concourse, and track and signal upgrades. Escalators and lifts were provided for platforms 5 and 6, replacing a staircase to achieve improved circulation. The redevelopment provided improved capacity and flexibility on the Brighton Main Line. The project was jointly financed by Network Rail, who contributed £44.9 million, and Gatwick Airport who provided £7.9 million. Construction was structured so as not to negatively affect the 2012 Summer Paralympics, which was hosted in London.

By 3 February 2014, completion was marked by a ceremony officiated by Minister of State for Transport Baroness Kramer, who formally opened the new platform. Constructed by VolkerFitzpatrick, platform 7 is served by a loop from the down fast line and used by services which formerly used at platform 5. VolkerFitzpatrick were responsible for track and signalling modifications. This has allowed platforms 5 and 6 to be dedicated to Gatwick Express services, thereby eliminating previous conflicts with slower services when they crossed to platforms 1 and 2. The project was finished on schedule and budget, despite extreme weather conditions during the winter of 2013/2014.

In 2014, Baroness Kramer announced that the government had committed £50 million towards further improvements. A scheme for further improvements, estimated to cost around £120 million, was announced by Network Rail. In April 2018, Network Rail submitted a planning application for modernising the station; doubling the size of the concourse, widening two platforms, and improving connections to the airport terminal. It was done in partnership with Gatwick Airport authorities, the Coast to Capital local enterprise partnership and the Department for Transport. The expansion is an element of a five-year programme, costed at £1.11 billion, announced by Gatwick Airport in early 2018.

Construction on the new concourse began in November 2020. The refurbished station opened on 21 November 2023.

<doc id="1063895" wikidata="Q5684363" url="?curid=1063895" title="Hawaii Republican Party">
<text>The Hawaii Republican Party (HRP; ) is the affiliate of the Republican Party (GOP) in Hawaii, headquartered in Honolulu. The party was strong during Hawaii&#x27;s territorial days, but following the Hawaii Democratic Revolution of 1954 the Democratic Party came to dominate Hawaii. The party currently has little power and is the weakest state affiliate of the national Republican Party; it controls none of Hawaii&#x27;s statewide or federal elected offices and has the least presence in the state legislature of any state Republican party.

==History==
===Republic===

Following the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom and the creation of the Republic of Hawaii, the American Union Party was created and as the Republic of Hawaii was a &quot;de facto&quot; one-party state, it faced virtually no opposition. On October 13, 1894, the American Union Party held its first convention, where it established the party&#x27;s organization, created a platform, and nominated candidates for the 1894 elections. The party&#x27;s official stance was in favor of annexation by the United States, although as the only legal party, anti-annexation factions were present within the party.

===Territorial===

After Hawaii was annexed on July 12, 1898, the majority of the American Union Party&#x27;s members created the Hawaii Republican Party. On March 10, 1899, members of the American Union Party and former leaders of the Republic held a meeting where they decided to postpone the organization of a Republican Party and the creation of an auxiliary party organization.

On May 2, 1900, around one hundred men organized the Republican Party affiliate in Hawaii. The first Republican Convention was held on May 30, 1900. Temporary officers were selected, a platform was created, and delegates were chosen to send to the Republican National Convention in June.

Although a Democratic affiliate existed in the territory, it held little influence, while the pro-Native Hawaiian Home Rule Party emerged as the main opposition. In 1900, the Home Rule Party took control of the territorial legislature and its leader, Robert William Wilcox, was elected as Hawaii&#x27;s non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives. Prior to the 1902 election, the Reform Party merged into the Hawaii Republican Party. The Home Rule Party split when Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole left its convention on July 10 to form the Hui Kuokoa Party. Shortly afterward he joined the Republicans. In the following elections, the Republicans defeated Wilcox by running Prince Kalanianaʻole, taking control of the legislature with 26 of the 36 seats. Following this defeat, the Home Rule Party existed in a weakened form until 1912, when it fused with the Republicans. The Republican Party led the so-called &quot;Haole-Hawaiian Alliance,&quot; with uninterrupted Legislative majorities until Democrats took control of the Legislature in 1954.

The Democratic Party of Hawaii was reorganized in 1902, but did not become influential until the 1920s, when it won multiple Honolulu mayoral elections and elected William Paul Jarrett as delegate to the House of Representatives. However, the Republican party retook the delegation to the House through the 1930s and 1940s, due to support from the Big Five sugar producers. A seminal moment in Hawaiian history, the power of the Big Five was weakened by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which lead to unionization on Hawaii&#x27;s sugar plantations and ultimately the Democratic Revolution of 1954. In elections that year, the Republicans lost control of the territorial legislature for the first time since 1900, as the Democratic affiliate won nine of the fifteen territorial senate seats and twenty two of the thirty territorial house seats. The Democrats retained control of the legislature in the 1956 elections, before the Republicans retook control of the senate in 1958.

===Statehood===

On May 16, 1959, the affiliate held its first state convention where most of the officer positions went uncontested except for national committeewoman and where the candidates for the upcoming federal and state special elections. In the gubernatorial election incumbent Territorial Governor and Republican William F. Quinn won by 4,139 votes; in the Senate special elections Republican Hiram Fong won by 9,514 votes while Wilfred Tsukiyama was narrowly defeated by 4,577 votes; and Republicans lost the House in a landslide.

In the 1998 gubernatorial election, Maui Mayor Linda Lingle won the Republican nomination and used dissatisfaction with Governor Ben Cayetano&#x27;s handling of the economy to propel her campaign. She polled above Cayetano. However, allegations that Lingle was a lesbian and her decision as mayor to require state employees to work on Christmas Eve hurt her. In the general election she lost by 5,254 votes. However, her gubernatorial campaign was the most successful since Randolph Crossley in 1966.

In 1999, Lingle and many of her supporters took over leadership positions in the party. Lingle defeated James Kuroiwa Jr., who was aligned with the party&#x27;s conservative wing and was pro-life, to become chairwoman with 325 to 63 votes.

In the 2002 gubernatorial election, the Democratic party had a contentious primary where Mazie Hirono defeated Ed Case by 2,000 votes. Hirono&#x27;s campaign was later hurt by corruption allegations that allowed Lingle to narrowly win the election, becoming the first Republican governor since 1962. She won reelection in 2006 and became the only multi-term popularly elected Republican governor in Hawaii history.

Leading into the 2004 presidential election, multiple polls showed George W. Bush performing well in Hawaii and the party made a push to win a House majority or at least enough to prevent veto overrides. However, the Bush campaign later decreased its efforts in Hawaii and Republicans instead lost five seats, despite Bush taking 45% of the votes, the closet the Republicans had come to winning the state in a presidential election since Ronald Reagan&#x27;s victory in 1984.

In 2010, Representative Neil Abercrombie resigned to focus on his gubernatorial campaign. A special election was held to fill that vacancy. Because special elections did not have primaries, two Democrats candidates ended up splitting Democratic votes, allowing Charles Djou to win with a plurality of 40% to became the first Republican representative from Hawaii since Pat Saiki in 1991. He was defeated in the next general election by Colleen Hanabusa.

Following Donald Trump&#x27;s election as president, many Republicans defected: Charles Djou became an independent and state House Minority Leader Beth Fukumoto became a Democrat. On December 11, 2019, the party cancelled its presidential preference poll and committed all of its primary delegates to Trump. In January 2021, party chair Shirlene Ostrov and vice-chair Edwin Boyette resigned after Boyette used the party&#x27;s Twitter account to post a series of tweets praising the QAnon conspiracy theory and describing its adherents as patriots.

==Positions==
===Economics===
Hawaii Republicans advocate for limited government, lower taxes, decentralized control of public schools, and improving the state&#x27;s business climate. Republicans generally support business plans and efforts to assist companies in the state in competing against businesses in other states. They typically support interstate and international commerce. For example, former Lieutenant Governor Duke Aiona pushed to keep the National Football League&#x27;s Pro Bowl in Hawaii, and former Governor Linda Lingle proposed tax reduction incentives to businesses to encourage job creation, such as hotel renovations.

===Environment===

In the Reform Party, a pre-statehood group that after annexation was largely sympathetic toward the Republican Party, Lorrin Thurston was a strong supporter of the formation of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. In the 21st century, Governor Lingle proposed a Clean Energy Initiative to promote renewable energy, with the goal of making the state 70% energy self-sustainable by 2030. The initiative planned to use solar, wind, ocean, geothermal, and biomass as energy resources with a phased reduction in fossil fuel use.

===Religion===
Despite the influence of the early missionaries and despite recent national trends, the Republican party in Hawaii steadily lost its Christian overtone over time. After annexation, Christians proselytized immigrants contracted to work in Hawaii&#x27;s growing sugar industry. This change was, in large part, brought on by &quot;Farrington v. Tokushige&quot; (1927), a U.S. Supreme Court case brought by approximately 100 Japanese, Korean, and Chinese language schools, a number of which were Buddhist religious schools, against Republican Governor Wallace R. Farrington and the Republican government. It sought to overturn laws limiting the material taught in private schools, including Buddhist philosophy. The court found the laws unconstitutional and in violation of parents&#x27; Fifth Amendment right to choose the education of their children. Duke Aiona, a Republican, presented a proclamation to the president of the Junior Young Buddhist Association in 2004 and attended the 2010 lantern festival.

The Party became hesitant to associate itself with religion, with members citing the negative effects of the party&#x27;s association with the Christian Coalition. The Coalition swelled Republican membership by 50%, but gave rise to infighting; by 1993 the party had lost legislative seats.

<doc id="1063903" wikidata="Q4969363" url="?curid=1063903" title="Gerda Nicolson">
<text>Gerda Maureen Nicolson (11 November 1937 – 12 June 1992) was an Australian actress, who worked across all major forms of media, including theatre, television and films, she was best known for several long-running television roles, and was a constant presence on the small screen since the early 60s until her death. Nicholson&#x27;s roles included the rural series &quot;Bellbird&quot; police detective series &quot;Bluey&quot; and soap opera &quot;Prisoner&quot;.

==Early life==

Gerda Nicolson was born in Hobart, Tasmania, and as a child moved to Geelong in Melbourne where her parents were both involved in reportory theatre. In 1959, she travelled to London with her parents and attended many stage performances. She initially studied architecture, but decided instead on a performing career, attaining her dramatic training at the St Martins Theatre, before travelling to London where she worked as a draftsperson.

On returning to Australia in 1961, Nicolson joined Melbourne University&#x27;s Graduate Society and acted in a number of its amateur stage plays. A year later, she was spotted by a director who encouraged her to audition for a stage play, &quot;A Woman in a Dressing Gown&quot;. Scoring one of the main roles, she joined the ensemble on its tour of Australia and New Zealand. Nicolson later said that the producer awarded her with the role on account of her stunning legs.

==Career==
===Television roles===
Nicholson featured in a TV production titled &quot;The Proposal and the Bear&quot; for ABC TV, although she first reached wider audiences through her regular roles on television serials firstly with Crawford Productions long-running rural series &quot;Bellbird&quot; as Fiona Davies. After leaving that series she had a regular role as Sgt Monica Rourke in the police detective drama &quot;Bluey&quot; (1976) opposite Lucky Grills and also featured briefly in &quot;The Sullivans&quot; (1976) and had a small guest role in &quot;Cop Shop&quot;, she later in 1989 appeared in a small role in &quot;Neighbours&quot; as Robyn Taylor, who almost has an affair with Harold Bishop.

==&quot;Prisoner&quot;==
She became most widely recognised locally and internationally for her role in the cult soap opera drama series &quot;Prisoner&quot; (internationally also known as Prisoner: Cell Block H) as Prison Governor Ann Reynolds, joining the cast in 1983 after Patsy King left the series and she assumed the role of the new governor. This was her second role in the show — she had already played a minor guest part as a corrupt officer at another prison in earlier episodes. Nicolson played the role until the series ended in 1986. &quot;Prisoner&quot; found huge international cult success in the 1990s and 2000s.

<text>Sungai Petani (abbr. Sg. Petani or SP) is a town in Kuala Muda District, Kedah, Malaysia. Sungai Petani is Kedah&#x27;s largest city and is located about 55 km south of Alor Setar, the capital of Kedah, and 33 km northeast of George Town, the capital city of the neighbouring state of Penang.

== Etymology ==
The name of the municipality is taken from the name of a river, which is &quot;Sungai Petani&quot; (Petani River), a tributary of Merbok River. The word &quot;Petani&quot; might be related to the province of Pattani in Thailand. The word is said to derive from a Sanskrit word &#x27;pathini&#x27;, meaning &quot;virgin nymph&quot;; Pathini was the name of a daughter of Merong Mahawangsa, founder of the preceding Langkasuka Empire. When Kedah was known under the name of Langkasuka, traders always travelled between Merbok Valley and Pattani, and the eastern parts of Peninsular Malaysia through land routes. Thus it is not impossible that the word &#x27;Petani&#x27; is borrowed from the name of the princess. &quot;Petani&quot; also means farmer in Malay, but it is unlikely that this is the origin of the city name as there are no sources pointing it to be the case.

==Transportation==

The station is also one of the stops for KTM Komuter Northern Sector, a local commuter-rail service under KTM Komuter that connects major town in Penang, Kedah, and Perlis.

This is the tallest mountain in the northern region and is surrounded by a vast jungle. It is a navigational point for ships entering the Straits of Malacca from the north because it is visible from far. There is an 18 km trekking route to the top of the mountain through a winding road. Atop the Jerai is a resort and the mountain boasts some tall and cooling waterfalls. Historically, the Jerai mountain served as the navigational point for traders from the east and west. There was a Hindu temple on top of the mountain that was built nearly a thousand years ago during the Bujang Valley Hindu Civilization.

This archaeological area was the site of an ancient Hindu-Buddhist kingdom that ruled the region from the 4th century AD. There is also an archaeological museum here which is known as The Lembah Bujang Archaeological Museum. This museum displays more than 2,500 artifacts from Malaysia&#x27;s earliest civilization that have been unearthed from the surrounding excavation sites.
