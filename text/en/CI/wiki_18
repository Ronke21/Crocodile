<text>Wangarĩ Maathai (; 1 April 1940 – 25 September 2011) was a Kenyan social, environmental, and political activist who founded the Green Belt Movement, an environmental non-governmental organization focused on the planting of trees, environmental conservation, and women&#x27;s rights. In 2004 she became the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize. 

As a beneficiary of the Kennedy Airlift, she studied in the United States, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Mount St. Scholastica and a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Pittsburgh. She went on to become the first woman in East and Central Africa to become a Doctor of Philosophy, receiving her Ph.D. from the University of Nairobi in Kenya. In 1984, she got the Right Livelihood Award for &quot;converting the Kenyan ecological debate into mass action for reforestation.&quot; Wangari Maathai was an elected member of the Parliament of Kenya and, between January 2003 and November 2005, served as Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural Resources in the government of President Mwai Kibaki. She was an Honorary Councillor of the World Future Council. As an academic and the author of several books, Maathai was not only an activist but also an intellectual who has made significant contributions to thinking about ecology, development, gender, and African cultures and religions.

Maathai died of complications from ovarian cancer on 25 September 2011.

==Early life and education==
Maathai was born on 1 April 1940 in the village of Ihithe, Nyeri District, in the central highlands of the colony of Kenya. Her family was Kikuyu, the most populous ethnic group in Kenya, and had lived in the area for several generations. Around 1943, Maathai&#x27;s family relocated to a white-owned farm in the Rift Valley, near Nakuru, where her father had found work. Late in 1947, she returned to Ihithe with her mother, as two of her brothers were attending primary school in the village, and there was no schooling available on the farm where her father worked. Her father remained at the farm. Shortly afterward, at the age of eight years, she joined her brothers at Ihithe Primary School.

At eleven years, Maathai moved to St. Cecilia&#x27;s Intermediate Primary School, a boarding school at the Mathari Catholic Mission in Nyeri. Maathai studied at St. Cecilia&#x27;s for four years. During this time, she became fluent in English and converted to Catholicism. She was involved with the Legion of Mary, whose members attempted &quot;to serve God by serving fellow human beings.&quot; Studying at St. Cecilia&#x27;s, she was sheltered from the ongoing Mau Mau uprising, which forced her mother to move from their homestead to an emergency village in Ihithe. When she completed her studies there in 1956, she was rated first in her class, and was granted admission to the only Catholic high school for girls in Kenya, Loreto High School in Limuru.

As the end of East African colonialism approached, Kenyan politicians, such as Tom Mboya, were proposing ways to make education in Western nations available to promising students. John F. Kennedy, then a United States senator, agreed to fund such a program through the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, initiating what became known as the Kennedy Airlift or Airlift Africa. Maathai became one of some 300 Kenyans selected to study in the United States in September 1960.

She received a scholarship to study at Mount St. Scholastica College (now Benedictine College), in Atchison, Kansas, where she majored in biology, with minors in chemistry and German. After receiving her Bachelor of Science degree in 1964, she studied at the University of Pittsburgh for a master&#x27;s degree in biology. Her graduate studies there were funded by the Africa-America Institute, and during her time in Pittsburgh, she first experienced environmental restoration, when local environmentalists pushed to rid the city of air pollution. In January 1966, Maathai received her MSc in biological sciences, and was appointed to a position as research assistant to a professor of zoology at University College of Nairobi.

Upon returning to Kenya, Maathai dropped her forename, preferring to be known by her birth name, Wangarĩ Muta. When she arrived at the university to start her new job, she was informed that it had been given to someone else. Maathai believed this was because of gender and tribal bias. After a two-month job search, Professor Reinhold Hofmann, from the University of Giessen in Germany, offered her a job as a research assistant in the microanatomy section of the newly established Department of Veterinary Anatomy in the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University College of Nairobi. In April 1966, she met Mwangi Mathai, another Kenyan who had studied in America, who would later become her husband. She also rented a small shop in the city and established a general store, at which her sisters worked. In 1967, at the urging of Professor Hofmann, she travelled to the University of Giessen in Germany in pursuit of a doctorate. She studied both at Giessen and the University of Munich.

In the spring of 1969, she returned to Nairobi to continue her studies at the University College of Nairobi as an assistant lecturer. In May, she and Mwangi Mathai married. Later that year, she became pregnant with her first child, and her husband campaigned for a seat in Parliament, narrowly losing. During the election, Tom Mboya, who had been instrumental in founding the program which sent her overseas, was assassinated. This led to President Kenyatta effectually ending multi-party democracy in Kenya. Shortly after, her first son, Waweru, was born. In 1971, she became the first Eastern African woman to receive a Ph.D., her doctorate in veterinary anatomy, from the University College of Nairobi, which became the University of Nairobi the following year. She completed her dissertation on the development and differentiation of gonads in bovines. Her daughter, Wanjira, was born in December 1971.

==Activism and political life==

===1972–1977: Start of activism===
Maathai continued to teach at Nairobi, becoming a senior lecturer in anatomy in 1975, chair of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy in 1976, and associate professor in 1977. She was the first woman in Nairobi appointed to any of these positions. During this time, she campaigned for equal benefits for the women working on the staff of the university, going so far as trying to turn the academic staff association of the university into a union, to negotiate for benefits. The courts denied this bid, but many of her demands for equal benefits were later met. In addition to her work at the University of Nairobi, Maathai became involved in several civic organisations in the early 1970s. She was a member of the Nairobi branch of the Kenya Red Cross Society, becoming its director in 1973. She was a member of the Kenya Association of University Women. Following the establishment of the Environment Liaison Centre in 1974, Maathai was asked to be a member of the local board, eventually becoming board chair. The Environment Liaison Centre worked to promote the participation of non-governmental organisations in the work of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), whose headquarters was established in Nairobi following the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm in 1972. Maathai also joined the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK). Through her work at these various volunteer associations, it became evident to Maathai that the root of most of Kenya&#x27;s problems was environmental degradation.

In 1974, Maathai&#x27;s family expanded to include her third child, son Muta. Her husband campaigned again for a seat in Parliament, hoping to represent the Lang&#x27;ata constituency, and won. During his campaign, he had promised to find jobs to limit the rising unemployment in Kenya. These promises led Maathai to connect her ideas of environmental restoration to providing jobs for the unemployed and led to the founding of Envirocare Ltd., a business that involved the planting of trees to conserve the environment, involving ordinary people in the process. This led to the planting of her first tree nursery, collocated with a government tree nursery in Karura Forest. Envirocare ran into multiple problems, primarily dealing with funding, and ultimately failed. However, through conversations concerning Envirocare and her work at the Environment Liaison Centre, UNEP made it possible to send Maathai to the first UN conference on human settlements, known as Habitat I, in June 1976.

In 1977, Maathai spoke to the NCWK concerning her attendance at Habitat I. She proposed further tree planting, which the council supported. On 5 June 1977, marking World Environment Day, the NCWK marched in a procession from Kenyatta International Conference Centre in downtown Nairobi to Kamukunji Park on the outskirts of the city, where they planted seven trees in honour of historical community leaders. This was the first event of the Green Belt Movement. Maathai encouraged the women of Kenya to plant tree nurseries throughout the country, searching nearby forests for seeds to grow trees native to the area. She agreed to pay the women a small stipend for each seedling which was later planted elsewhere.

In her 2010 book, &quot;Replenishing the Earth: Spiritual Values for Healing Ourselves and the World&quot;, she discussed the impact of the Green Belt Movement, explaining that the group&#x27;s civic and environmental seminars stressed &quot;the importance of communities taking responsibility for their actions and mobilizing to address their local needs,&quot; and adding, &quot;We all need to work hard to make a difference in our neighborhoods, regions, and countries, and in the world as a whole. That means making sure we work hard, collaborate, and make ourselves better agents to change.&quot; In this book, she explicitly engages with religious traditions, including the indigenous Kikuyu religion and Christianity, mobilizing them as resources for environmental thinking and activism.

===1977–1979: Personal problems===
Maathai and her husband, Mwangi Mathai, separated in 1977. After a lengthy separation, Mwangi filed for divorce in 1979. He was said to have believed that Wangari was &quot;too strong-minded for a woman&quot; and that he was &quot;unable to control her&quot;. In addition to naming her as &quot;cruel&quot; in court filings, he publicly accused her of adultery with another Member of Parliament, which in turn was thought to cause his high blood pressure and the judge ruled in Mwangi&#x27;s favour. Shortly after the trial, in an interview with &quot;Viva&quot; magazine, Maathai referred to the judge as either incompetent or corrupt. The interview later led the judge to charge Maathai with contempt of court. She was found guilty and sentenced to six months in jail. After three days in Lang&#x27;ata Women&#x27;s Prison in Nairobi, her lawyer formulated a statement that the court found sufficient for her release. Shortly after the divorce, her former husband sent a letter via his lawyer demanding that Maathai drop his surname. She chose to add an extra &quot;a&quot; instead of changing her name.

The divorce had been costly, and with lawyers&#x27; fees and the loss of her husband&#x27;s income, Maathai found it difficult to provide for herself and their children on her university wages. An opportunity arose to work for the Economic Commission for Africa through the United Nations Development Programme. As this job required extended travel throughout Africa and was based primarily in Lusaka, Zambia, she was unable to bring her children with her. Maathai chose to send them to her ex-husband and take the job. While she visited them regularly, they lived with their father until 1985.

===1979–1982: Political problems===
In 1979, shortly after the divorce, Maathai ran for the position of chairperson of the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK), an umbrella organisation consisting of many women&#x27;s organisations in the country. The newly-elected President of Kenya, Daniel arap Moi, tried to limit the amount of influence those of the Kikuyu ethnicity held in the country, including in volunteer civic organisations such as the NCWK. She lost this election by three votes, but was overwhelmingly chosen to be the vice-chairman of the organisation. The following year, Maathai again ran for chairman of the NCWK. Again she was opposed, she believes, by the government. When it became apparent that Maathai was going to win the election, Maendeleo Ya Wanawake, a member organisation which represented a majority of Kenya&#x27;s rural women and whose leader was close to Arap Moi, withdrew from the NCWK. Maathai was then elected chairman of the NCWK unopposed. However, Maendeleo Ya Wanawake came to receive a majority of the financial support for women&#x27;s programs in the country, and NCWK was left virtually bankrupt. Future funding was much more difficult to come by, but the NCWK survived by increasing its focus on the environment and making its presence and work known. Maathai continued to be reelected to serve as chairman of the organization every year until she retired from the position in 1987.

In 1982, the Parliamentary seat representing her home region of Nyeri was open, and Maathai decided to campaign for the seat. As required by law, she resigned from her position with the University of Nairobi to campaign for office. The courts decided that she was ineligible to run for office because she had not re-registered to vote in the last presidential election in 1979. Maathai believed this to be false and illegal, and brought the matter to court. The court was to meet at nine in the morning, and if she received a favorable ruling, was required to present her candidacy papers in Nyeri by three in the afternoon that day. The judge disqualified her from running on a technicality: as before, they claimed she should have re-registered to vote. When she requested her job back, she was denied. As she lived in university housing and was no longer a staff member, she was evicted.

===Green Belt Movement===

Maathai founded the Green Belt Movement in 1977 in response to the environmental concerns raised by rural Kenyan women. She moved into a small home she had purchased years before, and focused on the NCWK before becoming employed again. In the course of her work through the NCWK, she had the opportunity to partner with the executive director of the Norwegian Forestry Society, Wilhelm Elsrud. Maathai became the coordinator. Along with the partnership with the Norwegian Forestry Society, the movement had also received &quot;seed money&quot; from the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Women. These funds allowed for the expansion of the movement, for hiring additional employees to oversee the operations, and for continuing to pay a small stipend to the women who planted seedlings throughout the country. It allowed her to refine the operations of the movement, paying a small stipend to the women&#x27;s husbands and sons who were literate and able to keep accurate records of seedlings planted.

The UN held the third global women&#x27;s conference in Nairobi. During the conference, Maathai arranged seminars and presentations to describe the work the Green Belt Movement was doing in Kenya. She escorted delegates to see nurseries and plant trees. She met Peggy Snyder, the head of UNIFEM, and Helvi Sipilä, the first woman appointed a UN assistant secretary general. The conference helped to expand funding for the Green Belt Movement and led to the movement&#x27;s establishing itself outside Kenya. In 1986, with funding from UNEP, the movement expanded throughout Africa and led to the foundation of the Pan-African Green Belt Network. Forty-five representatives from fifteen African countries travelled to Kenya over the next three years to learn how to set up similar programs in their own countries to combat desertification, deforestation, water crises, and rural hunger. The attention the movement received in the media led to Maathai&#x27;s being honored with numerous awards. The government of Kenya, however, demanded that the Green Belt Movement separate from the NCWK, believing the latter should focus solely on women&#x27;s issues, not the environment. Therefore, in 1987, Maathai stepped down as chairperson of the NCWK and focused on the newly separate non-governmental organisation.

===Government intervention===
In the latter half of the 1980s, the Kenyan government came down against Maathai and the Green Belt Movement. The single-party regime opposed many of the movement&#x27;s positions regarding democratic rights. The government invoked a colonial-era law prohibiting groups of more than nine people from meeting without a government license. In 1988, the Green Belt Movement carried out pro-democracy activities such as registering voters for the election and pressing for constitutional reform and freedom of expression. The government carried out electoral fraud in the elections to maintain power, according to Maathai.

In October 1989, Maathai learned of a plan to construct the 60-storey Kenya Times Media Trust Complex in Uhuru Park. The complex was intended to house the headquarters of KANU, the &quot;Kenya Times&quot; newspaper, a trading center, offices, an auditorium, galleries, shopping malls, and parking spaces for 2,000 cars. The plan also included a large statue of President Daniel Arap Moi. Maathai wrote many letters in protest to, among others, the &quot;Kenya Times&quot;, the Office of the President, the Nairobi city commission, the provincial commissioner, the minister for environment and natural resources, the executive directors of UNEP and the Environment Liaison Centre International, the executive director of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the ministry of public works, and the permanent secretary in the department of international security and administration all received letters. She wrote to Sir John Johnson, the British high commissioner in Nairobi, urging him to intervene with Robert Maxwell, a major shareholder in the project, equating the construction of a tower in Uhuru Park to such construction in Hyde Park or Central Park and maintaining that it could not be tolerated.

The government refused to respond to her inquiries and protests, instead responding through the media that Maathai was &quot;a crazy woman&quot;; that denying the project in Uhuru Park would take more than a small portion of public parkland; and proclaiming the project as a &quot;fine and magnificent work of architecture&quot; opposed by only the &quot;ignorant few&quot;. On 8 November 1989, Parliament expressed outrage at Maathai&#x27;s actions, complaining of her letters to foreign organisations and calling the Green Belt Movement a bogus organisation and its members &quot;a bunch of divorcees&quot;. They suggested that if Maathai was so comfortable writing to Europeans, perhaps she should go live in Europe.

Despite Maathai&#x27;s protests, as well as popular protest growing throughout the city, the ground was broken at Uhuru Park for construction of the complex on 15 November 1989. Maathai sought an injunction in the Kenya High Court to halt construction, but the case was thrown out on 11 December. In his first public comments peonhe project, President Daniel Arap Moi stated that those who opposed the project had &quot;insects in their heads&quot;. On 12 December, in Uhuru Park, during a speech celebrating independence from the British, President Moi suggested Maathai be a proper woman in the African tradition and respect men and be quiet. She was forced by the government to vacate her office, and the Green Belt Movement was moved into her home. The government audited the Green Belt Movement in an apparent attempt to shut it down. Despite the government&#x27;s efforts, her protests and the media coverage the government&#x27;s response garnered led foreign investors to cancel the project in January 1990.

In January 1992, it came to the attention of Maathai and other pro-democracy activists that a list of people were targeted for assassination and that a government-sponsored coup was possible. Maathai&#x27;s name was on the list. The pro-democracy group, known as the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD), presented its information to the media, calling for a general election. Later that day, Maathai received a warning that one of their members had been arrested. Maathai decided to barricade herself in her home. Shortly thereafter, police arrived and surrounded the house. She was besieged for three days before police cut through the bars she had installed on her windows, came in, and arrested her. She and the other pro-democracy activists who had been arrested were charged with spreading malicious rumors, sedition, and treason. After a day and a half in jail, they were brought to a hearing and released on bail. A variety of international organisations and eight senators (including Al Gore and Edward M. Kennedy) put pressure on the Kenyan government to substantiate the charges against the pro-democracy activists or risk damaging relations with the United States. In November 1992, the Kenyan government dropped the charges.

On 28 February 1992, while released on bail, Maathai and others took part in a hunger strike in a corner of Uhuru Park, which they labeled Freedom Corner, to pressure the government to release political prisoners. After four days of hunger strike, on 3 March 1992, the police forcibly removed the protesters. Maathai and three others were knocked unconscious by police and hospitalized. President Daniel arap Moi called her &quot;a mad woman&quot; and &quot;a threat to the order and security of the country&quot;. The attack drew international criticism. The US State Department said it was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; by the violence and by the forcible removal of the hunger strikers. When the prisoners were not released, the protesters – mostly mothers of those in prison – moved their protest to All Saints Cathedral, the seat of the Anglican Archbishop in Kenya, across from Uhuru Park. The protest there continued, with Maathai contributing frequently, until early 1993 when the prisoners were finally released.

During this time, Maathai was recognized with various awards internationally, but the Kenyan government did not appreciate her work. In 1991 she received the Goldman Environmental Prize in San Francisco and the Hunger Project&#x27;s Africa Prize for Leadership in London. CNN aired a three-minute segment about the Goldman prize, but when it aired in Kenya, that segment was cut out. In June 1992, during the long protest at Uhuru Park, both Maathai and President arap Moi travelled to Rio de Janeiro for the UN Conference on Environment and Development (Earth Summit). The Kenyan government accused Maathai of inciting women and encouraging them to strip at Freedom Corner, urging that she not be allowed to speak at the summit. Despite this, Maathai was chosen to be a chief spokesperson at the summit.

===Push for democracy===
During the first multi-party election of Kenya, in 1992, Maathai strove to unite the opposition and for fair elections in Kenya. The Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) had fractured into FORD-Kenya (led by Oginga Odinga) and FORD-Asili (led by Kenneth Matiba); former vice president Mwai Kibaki had left the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) party, and formed the Democratic Party. Maathai and many others believed such a fractured opposition would lead to KANU&#x27;s retaining control of the country, so they formed the Middle Ground Group in an effort to unite the opposition. Maathai was chosen to serve as its chairperson. Also during the election, Maathai and like-minded opposition members formed the Movement for Free and Fair Elections. Despite their efforts, the opposition did not unite, and the ruling KANU party used intimidation and state-held media to win the election, retaining control of parliament.
The following year, ethnic clashes occurred throughout Kenya. Maathai believed they were incited by the government, who had warned of stark consequences to multi-party democracy. Maathai travelled with friends and the press to areas of violence in order to encourage them to cease fighting. With the Green Belt Movement she planted &quot;trees of peace&quot;, but before long her actions were opposed by the government. The conflict areas were labeled as &quot;no go zones&quot;, and in February 1993 the president claimed that Maathai had masterminded a distribution of leaflets inciting Kikuyus to attack Kalenjins. After her friend and supporter Dr. Makanga was kidnapped, Maathai chose to go into hiding. While in hiding, Maathai was invited to a meeting in Tokyo of the Green Cross International, an environmental organisation recently founded by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. When Maathai responded that she could not attend as she did not believe the government would allow her to leave the country and she was in hiding, Gorbachev pressured the government of Kenya to allow her to travel freely. President arap Moi denied limiting her travel, and she was allowed to leave the country, although too late for the meeting in Tokyo. Maathai was again recognized internationally, and she flew to Scotland to receive the Edinburgh Medal in April 1993. In May she went to Chicago to receive the Jane Addams International Women&#x27;s Leadership Award, and in June she attended the UN&#x27;s World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna.

During the elections of 1997, Maathai again wished to unite the opposition in order to defeat the ruling party. In November, less than two months before the election, she decided to run for parliament and for president as a candidate of the Liberal Party. Her intentions were widely questioned in the press; many believed she should simply stick to running the Green Belt Movement and stay out of politics. On the day of the election, a rumour that Maathai had withdrawn from the election and endorsed another candidate was printed in the media. Maathai garnered few votes and lost the election.

In the summer of 1998, Maathai learned of a government plan to privatize large areas of public land in the Karura Forest, just outside Nairobi, and give it to political supporters. Maathai protested this through letters to the government and the press. She went with the Green Belt Movement to Karura Forest, planting trees and protesting the destruction of the forest. On 8 January 1999, a group of protesters including Maathai, six opposition MPs, journalists, international observers, and Green Belt members and supporters returned to the forest to plant a tree in protest. The entry to the forest was guarded by a large group of men. When she tried to plant a tree in an area that had been designated to be cleared for a golf course, the group was attacked. Many of the protesters were injured, including Maathai, four MPs, some of the journalists, and German environmentalists. When she reported the attack to the police, they refused to return with her to the forest to arrest her attackers. However, the attack had been filmed by Maathai&#x27;s supporters, and the event provoked international outrage. Student protests broke out throughout Nairobi, and some of these groups were violently broken up by the police. Protests continued until 16 August 1999, when the president announced that he was banning all allocation of public land.

In 2001, the government again planned to take public forest land and give it to its supporters. While protesting this and collecting petition signatures on 7 March 2001, in Wang&#x27;uru village near Mount Kenya, Maathai was again arrested. The following day, following international and popular protest at her arrest, she was released without being charged. On 7 July 2001, shortly after planting trees at Freedom Corner in Uhuru Park in Nairobi to commemorate Saba Saba Day, Maathai was again arrested. Later that evening, she was again released without being charged. In January 2002, Maathai returned to teaching as the Dorothy McCluskey Visiting Fellow for Conservation at the Yale University&#x27;s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. She remained there until June 2002, teaching a course on sustainable development focused on the work of the Green Belt Movement.

===Election to parliament===

Upon her return to Kenya, Maathai again campaigned for parliament in the 2002 elections, this time as a candidate of the National Rainbow Coalition, the umbrella organisation which finally united the opposition. On 27 December 2002, the Rainbow Coalition defeated the ruling party Kenya African National Union, and in Tetu Constituency Maathai won with an overwhelming 98% of the vote. In January 2003, she was appointed Assistant Minister in the Ministry for Environment and Natural Resources and served in that capacity until November 2005. She founded the Mazingira Green Party of Kenya in 2003 to allow candidates to run on a platform of conservation as embodied by the Green Belt Movement. It is a member of the Federation of Green Parties of Africa and the Global Greens.

==2004 Nobel Peace Prize==
Wangarĩ Maathai was awarded the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize for her &quot;contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace.&quot; Maathai was the first African woman to win the prestigious award. According to Nobel&#x27;s will, the Peace Prize shall be awarded to the person who in the preceding year &quot;shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses&quot;. Between 1901 and 2018, only 52 Nobel Prize awards were given to women, while 852 Nobel Prize awards have been given to men. Through her significant efforts, Wangari Maathai became the first African woman, and the first environmentalist, to win the Peace Prize.

==AIDS conspiracy theory==
Controversy arose when it was reported by Kenyan newspaper &quot;The Standard&quot; that Maathai had claimed HIV/AIDS was &quot;deliberately created by Western scientists to decimate the African population.&quot; Maathai denied making the allegations, but &quot;The Standard&quot; has stood by its reports.

In a 2004 interview with &quot;Time&quot; magazine, in response to questions concerning that report, Maathai replied: &quot;I have no idea who created AIDS and whether it is a biological agent or not. But I do know things like that don&#x27;t come from the moon. I have always thought that it is important to tell people the truth, but I guess there is some truth that must not be too exposed,&quot; and when asked what she meant, she continued, &quot;I&#x27;m referring to AIDS. I am sure people know where it came from. And I&#x27;m quite sure it did not come from the monkeys.&quot; In response she issued the following statement: 

==2005–2011: Later life==
Following a trip to Japan in 2005, Maathai became an enthusiastic proponent of the waste-reduction philosophy of &quot;mottainai&quot;, a Japanese term of Buddhist origin.
On 28 March 2005, Maathai was elected the first president of the African Union&#x27;s Economic, Social and Cultural Council and was appointed a goodwill ambassador for an initiative aimed at protecting the Congo Basin Forest Ecosystem. In 2006, she was one of the eight flag-bearers at the 2006 Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony. Also on 21 May 2006, she was awarded an honorary doctorate by and gave the commencement address at Connecticut College. She supported the International Year of Deserts and Desertification program. In November 2006, she spearheaded the United Nations Billion Tree Campaign. Maathai was one of the founders of the Nobel Women&#x27;s Initiative along with sister Nobel Peace laureates Jody Williams, Shirin Ebadi, Rigoberta Menchú Tum, Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan Maguire. Six women representing North America and South America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa decided to bring together their experiences in a united effort for peace with justice and equality. It is the goal of the Nobel Women&#x27;s Initiative to help strengthen work being done in support of women&#x27;s rights around the world.

In August 2006, then United States Senator Barack Obama traveled to Kenya. His father was educated in America through the same program as Maathai. She and the Senator met and planted a tree together in Uhuru Park in Nairobi. Obama called for freedom of the press to be respected, saying, &quot;Press freedom is like tending a garden; it continually has to be nurtured and cultivated. The citizenry has to value it because it&#x27;s one of those things that can slip away if we&#x27;re not vigilant.&quot; He deplored global ecological losses, singling out President George W. Bush&#x27;s refusal to join the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its subsidiary, the Kyoto Protocol.

Maathai was defeated in the Party of National Unity&#x27;s primary elections for its parliamentary candidates in November 2007 and chose to instead run as the candidate of a smaller party. She was defeated in the December 2007 parliamentary election. She called for a recount of votes in the presidential election (officially won by Mwai Kibaki, but disputed by the opposition) in her constituency, saying that both sides should feel the outcome was fair and that there were indications of fraud.

In 2009, she published &quot;The Challenge for Africa&quot; with her insights into the strengths and weaknesses of governance in Africa, her own experiences, and the centrality of environmental protection to Africa&#x27;s future.

In June 2009, Maathai was named as one of PeaceByPeace.com&#x27;s first peace heroes. Until her death in 2011, Maathai served on the Eminent Advisory Board of the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa (AWEPA).

Wangarĩ Maathai died on 25 September 2011 of complications arising from ovarian cancer while receiving treatment at a Nairobi hospital.

Her remains were cremated and buried at the Wangari Maathai Institute for Peace and Environmental Studies in Nairobi.

==Posthumous recognition==
In 2012, Wangarĩ Gardens opened in Washington, DC. Wangarĩ Gardens is 2.7 acre community garden project for local residents which consists of over 55 garden allotments. This community garden honours the legacy of Wangarĩ Maathai and her mission for community engagement and environmental protection. The Wangarĩ Gardens consist of a community garden, youth garden, outdoor classroom, pollinator hive and public fruit tree orchard, vegetable garden, herb garden, berry garden and strawberry patch. Within the garden complex there are personal garden plots and public gardens. The personal plots are available to residents living within 1.5 miles of the community garden. Personal plot holders are required to contribute 1 hour monthly to the maintenance of the public gardens. The public gardens and orchard are maintained by plot holders and volunteers, and are open to everyone to enjoy and harvest. The Wangarĩ Gardens has no direct affiliation with the Green Belt Movement or the Wangarĩ Maathai Foundation but was inspired by Wangarĩ Maathai and her work and passion for the environment.

On 25 September 2013, the Wangarĩ Maathai Trees and Garden was dedicated on the lawn of the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Cathedral of Learning. The memorial includes two red maples symbolizing Maathai&#x27;s &quot;commitment to the environment, her founding of the Green Belt Movement, and her roots in Kenya and in Pittsburgh&quot; and a flower garden planted in a circular shape that representing her &quot;global vision and dedication to the women and children of the world&quot; with an ornamental maple tree in the middle signifying &quot;how one small seed can change the world&quot;.

In 2014, at what would have been her 50-year reunion, her Mount St. Scholastica classmates and Benedictine College unveiled a statue of the Nobel laureate at her alma mater&#x27;s Atchison, Kansas campus. In 2019, with the renovation of the Westerman Hall of Science and Engineering, the college added a mural of Maathai and other scientists to the front entryway of the building.

In 2015, UNESCO published the graphic novel &quot;Wangari Maathai and the Green Belt Movement&quot; as part of their UNESCO Series on Women in African History. As an artistic and visual interpretation intended for private or public use in classrooms, it tells the story of Maathai and the movement she started.

In October 2016, Forest Road in Nairobi was renamed to Wangarĩ Maathai Road for her efforts to oppose several attempts to degrade forests and public parks through the Green Belt Movement.

In September 2022, Washington, DC–based educational publisher, Science Naturally, included Dr. Maathai in their &quot;Women in Botany&quot; book in the Science Wide Open series for children. Brief excerpt:&quot;Dr. Wangari started the Green Belt Movement to change things. She taught women in Kenya how to grow trees from seeds, and the women were paid to plant trees all around the country.&quot;

<text>Greentrax Recordings are a Scottish record label that specialises in Scottish traditional music.

== History ==
The label was founded in 1986 by former police inspector Ian Green, who played the bagpipes and was responsible for arranging folk music at the police social club. He was also involved with the magazine &quot;Sandy Bell&#x27;s Broadsheet&quot;. Prior to his retirement, Green had been selling an increasing number of records at the Edinburgh Folk Club, at festivals, and via his Discount Folk Records mail order service, and continued this on retiring. He invested some of his pension into setting up the label, and the name came from a competition run by BBC Radio Scotland.

On 11 March 2024, Greentrax announced that its founder, Ian Green, had died at the age of 90.

==Artists==
The Greentrax catalogue include releases by Gordon Duncan, RURA, Barbara Dickson, The McCalmans, Paul McKenna Band, Jean Redpath, Catherine-Ann MacPhee, Adam McNaughton, Archie Fisher, Aly Bain, Brian McNeill, Judy Small, Shooglenifty, Tony McManus, Fiddlers&#x27; Bid, Chris Stout, Willie Hunter &amp; Violet Tulloch, Bodega, Peerie Willie Johnson, Shoormal, Ceilidh Minogue, Dick Gaughan, The Whistlebinkies, The Poozies and the Peatbog Faeries.

<text>Muhammad Raheem Bawa Muhaiyaddeen (died December 8, 1986), also known as &quot;Bawa&quot;, was a Tamil-speaking teacher and Sufi mystic from Sri Lanka who came to the United States in 1971, established a following, and founded the &quot;Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship&quot; in Philadelphia. He developed branches in the United States, Canada, Australia and the UK — adding to existing groups in Jaffna and Colombo, Sri Lanka. He is known for his teachings, discourses, songs, and artwork.

Bawa established vegetarianism as the norm for his followers and meat products are not permitted at the legacy fellowship center or farm.

==Early life== 

Though little is known of his early personal life, Bawa &quot;Muhaiyaddeen&quot;&#x27;s public career began in Sri Lanka in the early 1940s, when he emerged from the jungles of Sri Lanka, near Kataragama. 

Bawa met pilgrims who were visiting shrines and gradually became more widely known. There were reports of dream or mystical meetings with Bawa that preceded physical contact. According to an account from the 1940s, Bawa had spent time in Kataragama, a jungle shrine in the south of the island, and in &#x27;Jailani&#x27;, a cliff shrine dedicated to &#x27;Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani of Baghdad, an association that links him to the Qadiri order of Sufism. Many of his followers who lived around the northern town of Jaffna were Hindus and addressed him as swami or guru, where he was a medical and spiritual faith healer — and is alleged to have cured demonic possession.

Subsequently, his followers formed an ashram in Jaffna, and a farm south of the city. After meeting business travelers from the south, he was invited to visit Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka, at the time &quot;Ceylon&quot;. By 1967, the &#x27;Serendib Sufi Study Circle&#x27; was formed by these Colombo predominantly Muslim students. Earlier in 1955, Bawa had set the foundations for a &#x27;God&#x27;s house&#x27; or mosque in the town of Mankumban, on the northern coast. This was the result of a &quot;spiritual experience with Mary, Jesus&#x27; mother.&quot; After two decades, the building was finished by students from the United States who were visiting the Jaffna ashram. It officially opened and was dedicated in 1975.

Bawa taught using stories and fables, reflecting the background of the student or listener and included Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religious traditions; and welcomed persons from all traditions and backgrounds.

==Work in the United States==

In 1971, Bawa was invited to come to the United States and subsequently moved to Philadelphia, established a following, and formed the Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship in 1973. The fellowship meeting house offered weekly public gatherings.

As in Sri Lanka, Bawa developed a following among people of diverse religious, social and ethnic backgrounds, who came to Philadelphia to listen to him speak. In the United States, Canada and England, he was recognized by religious scholars, journalists, educators and leaders. The United Nations&#x27; Assistant Secretary General, Robert Muller, asked for Bawa&#x27;s guidance on behalf of mankind during an interview in 1974. During the Iranian hostage crisis of 1978–1980, he wrote letters to world leaders including Iran&#x27;s Khomeini, Prime Minister Begin, President Sadat and President Carter to encourage a peaceful resolution to the conflict. &quot;Time&quot; magazine, during the crisis in 1980, quoted Bawa as saying that when the Iranians understand the Koran &quot;they will release the hostages immediately.&quot; Interviews with Bawa appeared in &quot;Psychology Today&quot;, the &quot;Harvard Divinity Bulletin&quot;, and in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; and the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot;. He continued teaching until his death on December 8, 1986.

==Legacy==
In May, 1984, the Mosque of Shaikh M. R. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen was completed on the Philadelphia property of the Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship, on Overbrook Avenue. Construction took 6 months and nearly all the work was done by the members of the fellowship under Bawa&#x27;s direction.
The Bawa &quot;Muhaiyaddeen&quot; Fellowship Farm () is in Chester County, Pennsylvania, south of Coatesville and prominently features Bawa&#x27;s mausoleum, or mazar. Construction began shortly after his death and was completed in 1987. It is a destination for religious followers.

Bawa created paintings and drawings symbolizing the relationship between man and God, describing his art work as &quot;heart&#x27;s work&quot;. Two examples are reproduced in his book &quot;Wisdom of Man&quot; and another is the front cover of the book &quot;Four Steps to Pure Iman&quot;. In 1976, Bawa recorded and released an album of meditation, on Folkways Records entitled, &quot;Into the Secret of the Heart by Guru Bawa Muhaiyaddeen&quot;.

In the United States, from 1971 to 1986, Bawa authored over twenty-five books, created from over 10,000 hours of audio and video transcriptions of his discourses and songs. Some titles originated from Sri Lanka before his arrival in the U.S. and were transcribed later. The Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship continues to study and disseminate this repository of his teachings. It has not appointed a new leader or Sheikh to replace his role as teacher and personal guide.

==Vegetarianism==

Bawa established vegetarianism as the norm for his followers as he believed the only compassionate choice is to eat without slaughter. He stated that &quot;we must be aware of everything we do. All young animals have love and compassion. And if we remember that every creation was young once, we will never kill another life. We will not harm or attack any living creature&quot;. Bawa authored &quot;The Tasty Economical Cookbook&quot;, a two-volume vegetarian cookbook.

==Titles and honorifics==
Bawa &quot;Muhaiyaddeen&quot; was referred to as Guru, Swami, Sheikh or &#x27;His Holiness&#x27; depending on the background of the speaker or writer. He was also addressed as &quot;Bawangal&quot; by those Tamil speakers who were close to him and who wanted to use a respectful address. He often referred to himself as an &#x27;ant man&#x27;, that is, a very small life in God&#x27;s creation. After his arrival in the United States, he was most often addressed as &quot;Guru Bawa&quot; or simply &quot;Bawa&quot;, and he established the fellowship. By 1976, he felt that the title &#x27;guru&#x27; had been abused by others who were not true teachers and dropped the title &quot;Guru&quot;, with the organization becoming the &quot;Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship&quot;.

By 2007, an honorific, Qutb, was used by his students in the publications of his talks. Qutb means pole or axis, and signifies a spiritual center. The name Muhaiyaddeen means &#x27;the giver of life to true belief&#x27; and has been associated with previous Qutbs.

==Quotes==
*&quot;The prayers you perform, the duties you do, the charity and love you give is equal to just one drop. But if you use that one drop, continue to do your duty, and keep digging within, then the spring of God&#x27;s grace and His qualities will flow in abundance.&quot;
*&quot;People with wisdom know that it is important to correct their own mistakes, while people without wisdom find it necessary to point out the mistakes of others. People with strong faith know that it is important to clear their own hearts, while those with unsteady faith seek to find fault in the hearts and prayers of others. This becomes a habit in their lives. But those who pray to God with faith, determination, and certitude know that the most important thing in life is to surrender their hearts to God.&quot;
*&quot;The things that change are not our real life. Within us there is another body, another beauty. It belongs to that ray of light which never changes. We must discover how to mingle with it and become one with that unchanging thing. We must realize and understand this treasure of truth. That is why we have come to the world.&quot;
*&quot;My love you, my children. Very few people will accept the medicine of wisdom. The mind refuses wisdom. But if you do agree to accept it, you will receive the grace, and when you receive that grace, you will have good qualities. When you acquire good qualities, you will know true love, and when you accept love, you will see the light. When you accept the light, you will see the resplendence, and when you accept that resplendence, the wealth of the three worlds will be complete within you. With this completeness, you will receive the kingdom of God, and you will know your Father. When you see your Father, all your connections to karma, hunger, disease, old age will leave you.&quot;
*My grandchildren, this is the way things really are. We must do everything with love in our hearts. God belongs to everyone. He has given a commonwealth to all His creations, and we must not take it for ourselves. We must not take more than our share. Our hearts must melt with love, we must share everything with others, and we must give lovingly to make others peaceful. Then we will win our true beauty and the liberation of our soul. Please think about this. Prayer, the qualities of God, the actions of God, faith in God, and worship of God are your grace. If you have these, God will be yours and the wealth of the world to come will be yours. My grandchildren, realize this in your lifetime. Consider your life, search for wisdom, search for knowledge, and search for that love of God which is divine knowledge, and search for His qualities, His love, and His actions. That will be good. Amin. Ya Rabbal-&#x27;alamin. So be it. O Ruler of the universes. May God grant you this.&quot;
*&quot;God has a home inside of our heart. We must find a home inside of God&#x27;s home inside of our heart&quot; - Shared by Bawa Mahaiyaddeen in conversation with advocate for the homeless at the Muhaiyaddeen community in Philadelphia - 1986.

Coleman Barks, a poet and translator into English of the works of the 13th-century Sunni Muslim poet Jalāl ad-Dīn Muḥammad Rūmī, described meeting Bawa Muhaiyaddeen in a dream in 1977. After that experience he began to translate the poems of Rumi. Coleman finally met Bawa Muhaiyaddeen in September, 1978 and continued to have dreams where he would receive teachings. Coleman&#x27;s likens Bawa Muhaiyaddeen to Rumi and Shams Tabrizi, the companion of Rumi. Artist Michael Green worked with Coleman Barks to produce illustrated version of Rumi&#x27;s works.

In &quot;Blue-Eyed Devil&quot;, Michael Muhammad Knight attempts to receive a message from Bawa in a dream, in a Sufi practice called istikhara. He travels to the mazar and unsuccessfully tries to fall asleep on the cushions, but is awakened by the groundskeeper.

The band mewithoutYou explored Bawa&#x27;s teachings throughout their discography, most notably in their fourth album, It&#x27;s All Crazy! It&#x27;s All False! It&#x27;s All a Dream! It&#x27;s Alright. The teacher&#x27;s story of &quot;The Fox, the Crow, and the Cookie&quot; from My Love You My Children: 101 Stories for Children is told as well as his story about the &quot;King Beetle&quot; from The Divine Luminous Wisdom that Dispels Darkness.

<doc id="1049165" wikidata="Q569417" url="?curid=1049165" title="Anschutz Entertainment Group">
<text>Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc. (AEG), also known as AEG Worldwide, is an American global sporting and music entertainment presenter and a subsidiary of the Anschutz Corporation. It is the world&#x27;s largest owner of sports teams and sports events. Under the AEG Presents brand, it is the world&#x27;s second-largest presenter of live music and entertainment events, after Live Nation. AEG Presents was founded in 2002 as AEG Live.

==Overview==
AEG owns and operates a variety of venues, sport teams, and entertainment concerns. For venues, AEG owns and operates Crypto.com Arena and Dignity Health Sports Park, and managed the XL Center and Rentschler Field. In England, it operates The O2 which includes a 20,000 capacity arena. As part of the development of the O2, Anschutz also purchased the London river service company Thames Clippers, and supported the development of the nearby David Beckham Academy (which also had a branch at the Home Depot Center). The company had its headquarters in Downtown Los Angeles.

In sports teams, the company owns the Los Angeles Galaxy, 50% of the Los Angeles Kings, Ontario Reign, Eisbären Berlin with Berlin Mercedes-Benz Arena, 23.5% of Hammarby IF, as well as interests in the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Sparks. AEG also owned Hamburg Freezers before ceasing its existence in 2016. The company also purchased the Champions on Ice figure skating tour in 2006, and own 12% of Djurgårdens IF Hockey. The company makes a significant amount of its money by leveraging its sports interests, already significant earners, by using the stadiums in which these teams play to host various other entertainment events, most notably concerts. Philip Anschutz created the company by buying up several small local promoters in Los Angeles in order to fill up the schedule for his new sports venue, Staples Center. These included ConcertsWest and Goldenvoice, which had been founded by Gary Tovar, and promotes the annual Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. AEG was the second-largest event promoter in the United States.

AEG Presents, previously AEG Live, came to international public attention in 2009 when it acted as the promoter for Michael Jackson&#x27;s This Is It concerts. Jackson died just three weeks before the series of 50 concerts were due to begin. Members of Jackson&#x27;s family have said that they would like to see an investigation, in general, into the role of AEG Live in the final weeks of his life, and also, in particular, into the role of the personal advisers and representatives whom they believe the promoters put in place for him.

On September 18, 2012, the Anschutz Corporation announced its intent to sell Anschutz Entertainment Group and its holdings. The company has retained financial advisors Blackstone Advisory Partners to assist in AEG&#x27;s sale process. There had been some concerns about the sale as AEG was instrumental in the development of Farmers Field, a planned football stadium in Downtown Los Angeles that was intended to attract an NFL team to the city. Approval to begin construction of Farmers Field in 2013 for a 2016 completion was in the process of being finalized at the time that AEG&#x27;s sale was announced. In 2015, plans for Farmers Field were abandoned when then St. Louis Rams owner Stan Kroenke announced plans for a stadium of his own.

On March 14, 2013, Anschutz that announced AEG was no longer for sale and that it was changing CEOs. Tim Leiweke (CEO since 1996) left the firm; John Skorjanec was named VP of National Media Accounts with Dan Beckerman heading AEG.

AEG&#x27;s primary subsidiary AEG Facilities merged with its rival venue operator SMG in October 2019, forming ASM Global.

===Acquisitions===

==Arenas==
AEG owns Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California, The O2 in London, the Uber Arena in Berlin, and Barclays Arena in Hamburg. Additionally, AEG operates T-Mobile Center in Kansas City, the Target Center in Minneapolis, Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum and Oakland Arena in Oakland, Shell Energy Stadium in Houston, The Theatre at Grand Prairie in Dallas, and SNHU Arena in Manchester (New Hampshire).

Anschutz&#x27;s investment in the O2, through his company Anschutz Entertainment Group, previously resulted in his involvement in controversy related to the possible influence of former British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott in the award of the &quot;super casino&quot; license by the British government. Anschutz knew Prescott personally, having had him as a guest for a two-night stay at Anschutz&#x27;s ranch in 2005 and footing the bill for hospitality and gifts. In January 2007, the &quot;super casino&quot; license was awarded to a group in Manchester, rather than to Blackpool or London. Anschutz spent £50m on the Manchester Arena and the winner of the casino licence is a close ally of Anschutz, Sol Kerzner.
In August 2007, AEG announced plans with Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment to build a privately financed 20,000-seat arena in Paradise, Nevada on the Las Vegas Strip on Harrah&#x27;s land located directly behind the Bally&#x27;s Las Vegas and Paris Las Vegas resorts. The informal partnership was dissolved the following year.

In October 2011, AEG reached an agreement with Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras and WTorre to manage São Paulo&#x27;s then-upcoming Arena Palmeiras.

In September 2013, it was announced that AEG Facilities, a stand-alone affiliate of AEG, had signed a 15-year contract to operate Wembley Arena in London.

AEG Live partnered with MGM Resorts International to build the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, which opened in April 2016.

AEG Ogden, a joint venture with Australian investors, managed sports venues and convention centres in Australia and Asia, including the International Convention Centre Sydney, Lang Park and Sydney Super Dome.

==Sports ventures==

===Soccer===
Anschutz was one of the co-founders and one of the lead investors of Major League Soccer. In 1996, he became the investor/operator of the Colorado Rapids, his first MLS franchise. The Rapids were then a subsidiary of the Anschutz Corporation. In subsequent years, as Anschutz acquired additional sports teams, it led to the formation of a new division of the company whose focus was sports and entertainment, leading directly to the creation of AEG. the Rapids and National Hockey League&#x27;s (NHL) Los Angeles Kings as its original members.

Since 1996, AEG has held ownership in the Chicago Fire, San Jose Earthquakes, New York/New Jersey MetroStars, D.C. United and Houston Dynamo. Currently, AEG is the operator of the Los Angeles Galaxy.

Anschutz was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 2006. Also in 2006, Anschutz received the National Soccer Medal of Honor, one of four recipients to ever receive the award. In 2007, Anschutz and AEG played a role in bringing David Beckham to the United States. In 2009, he joined the Board of Directors of USA Bid Committee, a group which was formed with the aim of promoting the application and campaign to bring the World Cup to the United States. This was ultimately successful with the 2026 World Cup.

Between 2001 and 2019, AEG was the biggest external investor and minority shareholder of Swedish Allsvenskan club Hammarby IF. On 27 November 2019, it was announced that Zlatan Ibrahimović, had acquired 23.5 percent of the outstanding shares in Hammarby, which meant that AEG reduced their stake by half.

AEG were part of a consortium with Tottenham Hotspur which proposed to demolish the London 2012 Olympic Stadium in Stratford and then to build a new 60,000 seater soccer specific stadium in its place and to renovate the Crystal Palace athletics stadium. These proposals was rejected as they violated the Olympic legacy provisions of the UK government.

===Ice hockey===
AEG owns the NHL&#x27;s Los Angeles Kings, the AHL&#x27;s Ontario Reign, the ECHL&#x27;s Cincinnati Cyclones (co-owned with Nederlander Entertainment), and the German ice hockey team Eisbären Berlin. AEG also formerly owned the Manchester Monarchs and an interest in the Reading Royals, both of the ECHL.

===Golf===
In July 2010, it was announced that Xanterra Parks &amp; Resorts, Inc. had entered into an agreement to purchase the Kingsmill Resort near Williamsburg, Virginia. Xanterra, owned by Anschutz since 2008, has traditionally operated in national and state parks across the United States, especially in the Western regions, including Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming and Crater Lake National Park in Oregon. As of 2010, Xanterra was operating about three dozen hotels and lodges with more than 5,000 guest rooms combined, with over 8,000 employees.

It has also been reported that Anschutz is currently in negotiations to buy the Silverado Golf Resort in Napa, California.

===Other===
Anschutz Entertainment Group also owned the Tour of California bicycling race and the Bay to Breakers footrace.

The company also managed the T-Mobile Center in Kansas City, Missouri, and managed the XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut until 2013. They previously operated Rentschler Field in Hartford from 2007 to 2010, during which they held a stake in the now-defunct Hartford Colonials of the UFL.

In April 2016, AEG announced a partnership with esports company ESL; the next year the company also announced an investment in the North American esports organization, Immortals.

==Film==
When the 1968 John Wayne movie &quot;Hellfighters&quot; was being shot in 1967, Anschutz charged Universal Pictures a fee (equivalent to $ million in ) to film real fire fighters extinguishing a real oil blaze on his land.

Anschutz Film Group (formerly Crusader Entertainment, now known as Bristol Bay Productions and Walden Media) produced the commercially successful &quot;Holes&quot; in 2003 and &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot; in 2005.

The company also played a significant role the 2009 documentary–concert film &quot;Michael Jackson&#x27;s This Is It&quot;.

==Ticketing==
AEG partnered with Outbox Enterprises, a start up company, in which AEG is both an equity partner and a client, to develop AXS (pronounced &quot;access&quot;). AXS is a digital marketing platform for purchasing tickets for sports and entertainment events.

==Controversies==
===Berlin===
In Berlin, local groups started a boycott against the projected development Mediaspree, of which O2 World is a part, arguing that huge sections of public spaces were being lost to the private sector. Furthermore, the Anschutz company was criticized for bully-like behavior in regards to the changing of the outer parameters of the sports arena. A section of the nearby East Side Gallery, a leftover piece of the Berlin Wall now serving as an international memorial for peace and freedom, had to be removed to enable the view of
Anschutz&#x27;s new arena, located on the former eastern side of the city Spree. AEG has since promised to financially support the preservation of the East Side Gallery.

===Michael Jackson memorial service===
AEG had a global interest in the death of Michael Jackson by hosting a public memorial service at Crypto.com Arena (formerly Staples Center), a prominent music venue in Los Angeles and home of the Grammy Museum. The event included security and logistical support by the City of Los Angeles totaling $3.2 million. During this expense to the city during the Great Recession, some economists estimated that the event also generated $4 million for local businesses such as hotels and restaurants. City Council members and local media have called for the cost of the memorial incurred by the city to be paid for by the Jackson family or AEG, instead of by the city taxpayer. In June 2010, AEG agreed to pay the city of Los Angeles $1.3 million to offset some of the cost incurred by the city during the tribute event.

AEG was also accused of having attempted to profit from the death of Michael Jackson, who was due to perform at London&#x27;s O2 Arena in 2009 and 2010. The approximately 750,000 tickets were eligible for refund upon request, but the promoter offered to send out &quot;souvenir&quot; tickets if customers waived their right to the refund. The company estimated that 40–50% of its customers would request the original tickets in lieu of the refund, which would save the company $40 million in refunds. That was in addition to future profits from any material that formed a part of the &quot;This Is It&quot; concerts, which AEG made its intellectual property in sponsoring the concerts.

After Conrad Murray, the physician appointed by AEG to take care of Jackson during the run-up and throughout the &quot;This Is It&quot; concerts, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the &quot;California v. Murray&quot; case, Katherine Jackson, Michael&#x27;s mother and legal guardian of his three children, filed a wrongful death suit against the promoter, seeking damages reportedly exceeding tens of billions of dollars. AEG filed a motion to have the case dismissed which was denied by a Los Angeles County judge who ruled that sufficient evidence was present for the progression to a jury trial. The trial began on April 2. Murray served jail time for the death of Jackson, and indicated that if he was called as a witness for this case, he would refuse to testify to avoid incriminating himself amid his sentence appeal, as he had not previously testified under oath regarding Jackson&#x27;s death. On October 2, 2013, AEG was found not liable in the death of Michael Jackson.

<text>Dušan Simić (, ; May 9, 1938 – January 9, 2023), known as Charles Simic, was a Serbian American poet and poetry co-editor of &quot;The Paris Review&quot;. He received the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1990 for &quot;The World Doesn&#x27;t End&quot; and was a finalist of the Pulitzer Prize in 1986 for &quot;Selected Poems, 1963–1983&quot; and in 1987 for &quot;Unending Blues&quot;. He was appointed the fifteenth United States Poet Laureate in 2007.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Dušan Simić was born in Belgrade. In his early childhood, during World War II, he and his family were forced to evacuate their home several times to escape indiscriminate bombing of Belgrade. Growing up as a child in war-torn Europe shaped much of his worldview, Simic stated. In an interview from the &quot;Cortland Review&quot; he said, &quot;Being one of the millions of displaced persons made an impression on me. In addition to my own little story of bad luck, I heard plenty of others. I&#x27;m still amazed by all the vileness and stupidity I witnessed in my life.&quot;

Simic immigrated to the United States with his brother and mother to join his father in 1954, when he was sixteen. After spending a year in New York, he moved with his family to Oak Park, Illinois, where he graduated from high school. In 1961, he was drafted into the U.S. Army, and in 1966, he earned his B.A. from New York University while working at night to cover the costs of tuition.

===Career===
Simic began to make a name for himself in the early to mid-1970s as a literary minimalist, writing terse, imagistic poems. Critics have referred to Simic&#x27;s poems as &quot;tightly constructed Chinese puzzle boxes&quot;. He himself stated: &quot;Words make love on the page like flies in the summer heat and the poet is merely the bemused spectator.&quot;

He was a professor of American literature and creative writing at University of New Hampshire beginning in 1973 and lived in Strafford, New Hampshire. Simic wrote on such diverse topics as jazz, art, and philosophy. He was influenced by Emily Dickinson, Pablo Neruda, and Fats Waller. He was a translator, essayist, and philosopher, opining on the current state of contemporary American poetry. He held the position of poetry editor of &quot;The Paris Review&quot; and was later replaced by Dan Chiasson. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1995, received the Academy Fellowship in 1998, and was elected a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets in 2000.

Simic was one of the judges for the 2007 Griffin Poetry Prize and continued to contribute poetry and prose to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. He received the US$100,000 Wallace Stevens Award in 2007 from the Academy of American Poets.

Simic was selected by James H. Billington, Librarian of Congress, to be the fifteenth United States Poet Laureate, succeeding Donald Hall. In choosing Simic as the poet laureate, Billington cited &quot;the rather stunning and original quality of his poetry&quot;.

In 2011, Simic was the recipient of the Frost Medal, presented annually for &quot;lifetime achievement in poetry&quot;.

Simic&#x27;s extensive papers as well as other material about his work are held at the University of New Hampshire Library Milne Special Collections and Archives. 

===Personal life and death===
Simic married fashion designer Helene Dubin in 1964, and their union produced two children. In 1971, he became an American citizen. Simic died of complications of dementia on January 9, 2023, at age 84.

<doc id="1049169" wikidata="Q3480069" url="?curid=1049169" title="Service-level objective">
<text>A service-level objective (SLO), as per the O&#x27;Reilly Site Reliability Engineering book, is a &quot;target value or range of values for a service level that is measured by an SLI.&quot; An SLO is a key element of a service-level agreement (SLA) between a service provider and a customer. SLOs are agreed upon as a means of measuring the performance of the service provider and are outlined as a way of avoiding disputes between the two parties based on misunderstanding.

==Overview==
There is often confusion in the use of SLAs and SLOs. The SLA is the entire agreement that specifies what service is to be provided, how it is supported, times, locations, costs, performance, and responsibilities of the parties involved. SLOs are specific measurable characteristics of the SLA such as availability, throughput, frequency, response time, or quality. These SLOs together are meant to define the expected service between the provider and the customer and vary depending on the service&#x27;s urgency, resources, and budget. SLOs provide a quantitative means to define the level of service a customer can expect from a provider.

The SLO are formed by setting goals for metrics (commonly called service level indicators, SLIs). As an example, an availability SLO may be defined as the expected measured value of an availability SLI over a prescribed duration (e.g. four weeks). The availability SLI used will vary based on the nature and architecture of the service. For example, a simple web service might use the ratio of successful responses served vs the total number of valid requests received. (total_success / total_valid) 

==Examples==

Sturm and Morris argue that SLOs must be:

* Attainable
* Repeatable
* Measurable
* Understandable
* Meaningful
* Controllable
* Affordable
* Mutually acceptable

While Andrieux et al. define the SLO as &quot;the quality of service aspect of the agreement. Syntactically, it is an assertion over the terms of the agreement as well as such qualities as date and time&quot;. Keller and Ludwig more concisely define an SLO as &quot;commitment to maintain a particular state of the service in a given period&quot; with respect to the state of the SLA parameters. Keller and Ludwig go on to state that while service providers will most often be the lead entity in taking on SLOs there is no firm definition as such and any entity can be responsible for an SLO. Along with this an SLO can be broken down into a number of different components.

* Obliged - The entity that is required to deliver the SLO.
* Validity Period - The time in which the SLO will be delivered.
* Expression - This is the actual language that defines what the SLO will be.

Optionally an EvaluationEvent maybe assigned to the SLO, an EvaluationEvent is defined as the measure by which the SLO will be checked to see if it&#x27;s meeting the Expression.

SLOs should generally be specified in terms of an achievement value or service level, a target measurement, a measurement period, and where and how they are measured. As an example, &quot;90% of calls to the helpdesk should be answered in less than 20 seconds measured over a one-month period as reported by the ACD system&quot;. Results can be reported as a percent of time that the target answer time was achieved and then compared to the desired service level (90%).

==Term usage==
The SLO term is found in various scientific papers, for instance in the reference architecture of the SLA@SOI project, and it is used in the Open Grid Forum document on WS-Agreement.

<doc id="1049180" wikidata="Q4922692" url="?curid=1049180" title="Blackburn Lake Sanctuary">
<text>Blackburn Lake Sanctuary is an example of regenerated and remnant bushland in suburban Melbourne, Australia. It is located in the suburb of Blackburn. It is the most significant of the many parks in the City of Whitehorse, featuring areas of regenerated bushland and various walking tracks.

In 1889 the Kooyongkoot Creek was dammed forming Blackburn Lake, at the centre of the sanctuary. The park has a diverse history revolving around the human usage of the lake and surrounding bushland, which by the 1960s left the lake in particular, very polluted. Although still polluted today, the late 20th century saw much regenerative planting and protection measures by local residents and community groups which has halted and in some places reduced pollution. Today, the park is home to a variety of local wildlife, including Pacific black ducks and herons. The sanctuary also features a variety of other birds, as well as possums and sugar gliders.

==History==
In 1889 the lake itself was formed when Gardiners Creek was dammed to provide water for local fruit growers. The lake grew in popularity as a tourist destination, with visitors from Melbourne travelling two hours by steam train to reach it. During the 1890s, artist Frederick McCubbin of the famed Heidelberg School lived briefly near the lake, where he painted works including &quot;Down on His Luck&quot;, &quot;The Bush Burial&quot; and &quot;Bush Idyll&quot;.

In 1909 the Adult Deaf Society purchased the land surrounding the lake, where they established a hospice and a flower farm. In 1964 the Society sold the lake and the land around it to the Melbourne Water board, and in 1965 the area was declared a sanctuary. Later public purchases increased the size of the sanctuary until it reached its current size in 1992. The Visitor Centre was refurbished in 1991 to accommodate an expanded education programme.

Much of the history of the park revolves around the damming of Kooyongkoot Creek and its use over time. See below for history of Blackburn Lake.

==Geography==

The park sits on around of land in the middle of Blackburn, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria to which it is located about east of the central business district of Melbourne.

===Blackburn Lake===
In the early days before the lake was formed, Kooyongkoot Creek wound its way down the valley from Mitcham to Blackburn on its way to the Yarra River. It would have been joined along the way, particularly in winter, by many little rivulets and streams; some of these gullies can still be seen as you walk around the lake today. In summer, the creek is suspected to have dried up at times.

The lake was dammed in 1889 initially to provide water for local fruit growers, but was later used and misused for various reasons and activities until the late 1970s. Today, activities on the lake are limited to protect the surrounding environment. The lake is fed by a number of small creeks to its east and many small surrounding gullies. The dam wall is located in lake&#x27;s west reaches, Lake Road runs along the top of this wall. Kooyongkoot Creek heads west from the wall, through the beginnings of its course to the Yarra River.

It was initially about deep where the creek had been mined for antimony, but recent studies show that it is not that deep today, having silted up over the intervening years. In the 1920s, diving towers were erected and swimming lessons were held at the lake, the water quality was as yet unaffected by surrounding land clearing, agriculture and development. The Blackburn Swimming Club was forced to close in 1931 due to vandalism of the facilities.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the lake became a dumping ground for rubbish, and there are supposed to be old car bodies and other rubbish at the bottom. These would have leached acids, lead and hydrocarbons into the water over the years. Pollution in the lake renders it unusable as a source of water for the surrounding human population or agriculture. In 1962 the dam wall in Lake Rd was built by the MMBW to form a retarding basin to prevent flooding further down Kooyongkoot Creek, and the Lake Rd Bridge was demolished in 1965.

The bridges that cross the lake and its creeks and gullies include:
*Friends Bridge (early 1900s, rebuilt 1981)
*Billabong Bridge (built 1980s)
*Lake Road Bridge (built 1888, demolished 1965, rebuilt 2002)

==Recreation==

Throughout the park&#x27;s history, much of the recreation in the park revolved around the lake, however today recreation revolves around the appreciation of the Australian native flora, much of which has been regenerated over time. The park is popular with bushwalkers. Cycling is also popular but is usually only partaken locally as the park does not host a cycling through-route trail.

<text>Toilets in Japan are sometimes designed more elaborately than toilets commonly seen in other developed nations. European toilets occasionally have a separate bidet whilst Japan combines an electronic bidet with the toilet. The current state of the art for Western-style toilets in Japan is the bidet toilet, which is installed in 81% of Japanese households. In Japan, these bidets are commonly called washlets, a brand name of Toto Ltd., and they may include many advanced features rarely seen outside of Asia. The basic feature set commonly found on washlets consists of anal hygiene, bidet washing, seat warming, and deodorization. 

== Terminology ==
The word is an abbreviated form of the English language word &quot;toilet&quot;, and is used both for the toilet itself and for the room where it is located.

A common euphemism is . This is similar to the usage in US English of &quot;washroom&quot;, which literally means a room where something is washed, and &quot;toilet&quot;, which literally refers to the act of self-cleaning. It is also common to see another loan translation, , on signs in department stores and supermarkets, as well as accompanying the public toilet pictogram.

The plain word for toilet is , from the word meaning &quot;convenience&quot; or &quot;excrement&quot;, and this word is fairly common. It is often used in elementary schools, public swimming baths, and other such public places, and is not especially impolite, although some may prefer to use a more refined word. In many children&#x27;s games, a child who is tagged &quot;out&quot; is sent to a special place, such as the middle of a circle, called the &quot;benjo&quot;. Japanese has many other words for places reserved for excretory functions, including &quot;kawaya&quot; (厠) and &quot;habakari&quot; (憚り), but most are rare or archaic.

The toilet itself—that is, the bowl or in-floor receptacle, the water tank, et cetera—is called &quot;benki&quot; (便器). The toilet seat is &quot;benza&quot; (便座). A potty, either for small children or for the elderly or infirm, is called &quot;omaru&quot; (sometimes written 御虎子).

The Japan Toilet Association celebrates an unofficial &quot;Toilet Day&quot; on November 10, because in Japan the numbers 11/10 (for the month and the day) can be read as &quot;&quot;, which also means &quot;Good Toilet&quot;.

== Types of toilets ==
There are two styles of toilets commonly found in Japan; the oldest type is a simple squat toilet, which is still common in public conveniences. After World War II, modern Western-type flush toilets and urinals became common.

=== Squat toilet ===
The traditional toilet is the squat toilet. A squat toilet differs from a sitting toilet in both construction and method of employment. A squat toilet essentially looks like a miniature urinal set horizontally into the floor. Most squat toilets in Japan are made of porcelain, although in some cases (as on trains) stainless steel is used instead. The user squats over the toilet, facing the hemispherical hood, i.e., the wall in the back of the toilet in the picture seen on the right. A shallow trough collects the waste, instead of a large water-filled bowl as in a Western toilet. All other fixtures, such as the water tank, piping, and flushing mechanism, may be identical to those of a Western toilet.

Flushing causes water to push the waste matter from the trough into a collecting reservoir which is then emptied, with the waste carried off into the sewer system. The flush is often operated in the same manner as a Western toilet, though some have pull handles or pedals instead. Many Japanese toilets have two kinds of flush: &quot;small&quot; (小) and &quot;large&quot; (大). The difference is in the amount of water used. The former is for urine (in Japanese, literally &quot;small excretion&quot;) and the latter for feces (&quot;large excretion&quot;). Often, the lever is pushed to the &quot;small&quot; setting to provide a continuous masking noise for privacy, as discussed below.

===Hybrid squat/sitting toilet===

A combination squat/sitting toilet also exists, where a seat can be flipped down over a squat toilet, and the toilet can be used essentially the same way as the Western style. 
This hybrid seems to be common only in rural areas for the benefit of resident foreigners. Adapters that sit on top of the Japanese toilet to convert it to a functional sit-down toilet are much more common. There are also permanently installed extensions available to convert a squat toilet into a sitting-style washlet.

=== &quot;Western-style&quot; ===

A flush toilet which has a pedestal for sitting is known in Japan as a toilet, more commonly known as the sitting toilet. Western-style toilets, including high tech toilets, are now more common in Japanese homes than the traditional squat toilets, though some older apartments retain stickers on the toilet or in its room illustrating the proper way to use it for urination and defecation. Many public toilets at schools, temples, and train stations are still equipped with only squat toilets. In their own homes, however, Japanese people prefer being able to sit, especially older or physically disabled individuals for whom prolonged squatting is physically demanding or uncomfortable. Like Japanese toilets, many Western toilets have two kinds of flush: &quot;small&quot; (小) and &quot;large&quot; (大). The difference is in the amount of water used.

== Japanese bidets (washlet) ==
The modern toilet in Japan, in English sometimes called &quot;Super Toilet&quot;, and commonly known in Japanese as or as has many features. The Toto product &quot;Washlet Zoe&quot; is listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s most sophisticated toilet, with seven functions. However, as the model was introduced in 1997, it is now likely to be inferior to the latest model by Toto, &quot;Neorest&quot;. The idea for the &quot;washlet&quot; came from abroad, and the first toilet seat with integrated bidet was produced in Switzerland by Closomat in 1957. The age of the high-tech toilet in Japan started in 1980 with the introduction of the &quot;Washlet G Series&quot; by Toto, and since then the product name &quot;washlet&quot; has been used to refer to all types of Japanese high-tech toilets. , almost half of all private homes in Japan have such a toilet, exceeding the number of households with a personal computer. While the toilet looks like a Western-style toilet at first glance, there are numerous additional features—such as blow dryer, seat heating, massage options, water jet adjustments, automatic lid opening, automatic flushing, wireless control panel, room heating and air conditioning for the room—included either as part of the toilet or in the seat. These features can be accessed by an (often wireless) control panel attached to the seat or mounted on a nearby wall.

=== Basic features ===
The most basic feature is the integrated bidet, a nozzle the size of a pencil that comes out from underneath the toilet seat and squirts water. It has two settings: one for washing the anus and one for the bidet function. The former is called &quot;posterior wash&quot;, &quot;general use&quot;, or &quot;family cleaning&quot;, and the latter is known as &quot;feminine cleaning&quot;, &quot;feminine wash&quot; or simply &quot;bidet&quot;. At no point does the nozzle actually touch the body of the user. The nozzle is also self-cleaning and cleans itself before and after operation.

The user can select to wash the anus or vulva by pressing the corresponding button on the control panel. Usually the same nozzle is used for both operations, but at a different position of the nozzle head, and using different openings in the nozzle to squirt water at a different angle to aim for the correct spot. Occasionally, two nozzles are used, each dedicated for one area. The control logic is also attached to a pressure switch or a proximity sensor in the toilet seat, and operates only when the seat is occupied. The very first models did not include this automatic switch-off.

The seat-heating feature is very common, found even on toilets that lack the bidet features. As most Japanese homes lack central heating—instead using space heating—the bathroom may be only a few degrees above freezing in the winter.

=== Customization ===

Most high-tech toilets allow water temperature and water pressure to be adjusted to match the preferences of the user. By default, the vulva receives less pressure than the anus. Researchers in Japan have found that most users prefer a water temperature slightly above body temperature, with considered optimal. The nozzle position can also often be manually adjusted forward or aft. High-end washlets allow selection of vibrating and pulsating jets of water, claimed by manufacturers
to be beneficial for constipation and hemorrhoids. The most advanced washlets can mix the water jet with soap for an improved cleaning process.

The washlet can replace toilet paper completely, but many users opt to use both wash and paper in combination—although use of paper may be omitted for cleaning of the vulva. Some wipe before washing, some wash before wiping, some wash only, and some wipe only—each according to their preference. Another frequent feature is a blow dryer, often adjustable between 40 °C (104 °F) and 60 °C, (140 °F) used to dry the washed areas.

=== Advanced features ===
Additional features may include a heated seat, which may be adjustable from 30 °C (86 °F) to 40 °C (104 °F), an automatic lid equipped with a proximity sensor, which opens and closes based on the location of the user; and an air dryer and deodorizer. Some play music to relax the user&#x27;s sphincter (some INAX toilets, for example, play the first few phrases of Op. 62 Nr. 6 &quot;Frühlingslied&quot; by Felix Mendelssohn). Other features are automatic flushing, automatic air deodorizing, and a germ-resistant surface. Some models specially designed for the elderly may include armrests and devices that help the user to stand back up after use. A &quot;soft close&quot; feature slows the toilet lid down while closing so the lid does not slam onto the seat, or in some models, the toilet lid will close automatically a certain time after flushing.

The most recent introduction is an ozone deodorant system that can quickly eliminate smells. Also, the latest models store the times of day when the toilet is used and have a power-saving mode that warms the toilet seat only during times when the toilet is likely to be used based on historic usage patterns. Some toilets also glow in the dark or may even have air conditioning below the rim for hot summer days. Another recent innovation is intelligent sensors that detect someone standing in front of the toilet and initiate an automatic raising of the lid (if the person is facing away from the toilet) or the lid and seat together (if someone is facing the toilet).

=== Self-cleaning ===
Japanese toilets with washlets increasingly have features intended to reduce the frequency with which manual cleaning is required.

Many models will spray a film of water prior to use to prevent waste from bonding to the bowl prior to flushing. Still others will spray a small amount of mild detergent, this has the added benefit of breaking the surface tension of the water, preventing urine or solid waste from splashing during use. Some models will spray electrolyzed water after use to disinfect the bowl.

Air ionizers are sometimes included with claims of microbe reduction when the lid is closed. Recently, there has been development in using photocatalytic glazes and ultraviolet light to clean the bowl.

=== Controls ===
Text explaining the controls of these toilets tends to be in Japanese only. Although many of the buttons often have pictograms, the flush button is often written only in Kanji, meaning that non-Japanese users may initially find it difficult to locate the correct button.

In January 2017, The Japan Sanitary Equipment Industry Association, a consortium of companies producing plumbing products including Toto Ltd., Panasonic, and Toshiba, has agreed to unify the iconography used on the often baffling control panels for Japanese toilets. The toilet manufacturers plan to implement the eight new pictogram on models released from 2017 onward, with a view to the system becoming an international standard.

=== Future developments ===

Recently, researchers have added medical sensors into these toilets, which can measure the blood sugar based on the urine, and also measure the pulse, blood pressure, and the body fat content of the user. Talking toilets that greet the user have also started being made. Other measurements are currently being researched. The data may automatically be sent to a doctor through a built-in internet-capable cellular telephone. However, these devices are still very rare in Japan, and their future commercial success is difficult to predict. A voice-operated toilet that understands verbal commands is under development. Toto, NAiS (a division of Panasonic), and other companies also produce portable, battery-operated &quot;travel washlets&quot;, which must be filled with warm water before use.

=== Washlet Syndrome ===

The repetitive use of a &quot;type water jet on a high-pressure setting for an enema, can weaken the capability for self-evacuation of the &quot;Washlet&quot; user, which can lead to more serious constipation.&quot; If a &quot;Washlet&quot; high-pressure water jet is used on the anus repeatedly, it may cause excessive cleanliness, prompting other bacteria to adhere around the anus, causing skin disease (inflammation) around the anus. Some proctologists in Japan have named this or .

There have been claims of benefit in preventing urinary tract infections and also concerns that washlet use can cause increased risk of urinary tract infection, aggravate vaginal flora when the bidet feature is used, and cause cross-contamination from the wand or water tank, but the effects appear to be minimal and neither a substantial risk nor of measurable benefit for healthy adults.

== Urinals ==

Urinals in Japan are very similar to the urinals in the rest of the world, and mainly used for public male toilets or male toilets with a large number of users.

Female urinals never caught on in Japan, although there were attempts made to popularize the American Sanistand female urinal by the Japanese toilet manufacturing company Toto between 1951 and 1968. This device was shaped like a cone and placed on the floor. However, those were never very popular, and only a few of them remain, including those underneath the now-demolished National Olympic Stadium from the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, which was added to accommodate people from a wide range of cultures.

== Japan-specific accessories ==
Toilets in Japan have very similar accessories as most toilets worldwide, including toilet paper, a toilet brush, a sink, etc. However, there are some Japan-specific accessories that are rarely found outside Japan.

=== The &quot;Sound Princess&quot; ===

Many Japanese women are embarrassed at the thought of being heard by others during urination (see paruresis). To cover the sound of bodily functions, many women used to flush public toilets continuously while using them, wasting a large amount of water in the process. As persuasion campaigns did not stop this practice, a device was introduced in the 1980s that, after activation, produces the sound of flushing water without the need for actual flushing. A Toto brand name commonly found is the . This device is now routinely placed in most new public women&#x27;s rooms, and many older public women&#x27;s rooms have been upgraded.

The &quot;Otohime&quot; may be either a separate battery-operated device attached to the wall of the toilet, or included in an existing washlet. The device is activated by pressing a button, or by the wave of a hand in front of a motion sensor. When activated, the device creates a loud flushing sound similar to a toilet being flushed. This sound either stops after a preset time or can be halted through a second press on the button. It is estimated that this saves up to of water per use. However, some women believe that the &quot;Otohime&quot; sounds artificial and prefer to use a continuous flushing of the toilet instead of the recorded flush of the &quot;Otohime&quot;.
=== Toilet slippers ===

In Japanese culture, there is a tendency to separate areas into &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;unclean&quot;, and the contact between these areas is minimized. For example, the inside of the house is considered a clean area, whereas the outside of the house is considered unclean. To keep the two areas separated, shoes are taken off before entering the house so that the unclean shoes do not touch the &quot;clean&quot; area inside of the house. Historically, toilets were located outside of the house, and shoes were worn for a trip to the toilet. Nowadays, the toilet is almost always inside the home and hygienic conditions have improved significantly, but the toilet is still considered an &quot;unclean&quot; area.

To further minimize contact between the &quot;unclean&quot; toilet floor and the &quot;clean&quot; floor in the rest of the house, many private homes and also some public toilets have in front of the toilet door that should be used when in the toilet and removed immediately after leaving the toilet. This also indicates if the toilet is in use. They can be as simple as a pair of rubber slippers, decorated slippers with prints of anime characters for small children, or even animal fur slippers. A frequent &quot;faux pas&quot; of foreigners is to forget to take off the toilet slippers after a visit to the restroom, and then use these in the non-toilet areas, hence mixing the &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;unclean&quot; areas.

== Public toilets ==
Public toilets are usually readily available all over Japan, and can be found in department stores, supermarkets, book stores, CD shops, parks, most convenience stores, and in all but the most rural train stations. Some older public toilet buildings lack doors, meaning that men using the urinals are in full view of people walking past. Beginning in the 1990s, there has been a movement to make public toilets cleaner and more hospitable than they had been in the past.

The number of public restrooms that have both Western and squat types of toilets is increasing. Many train stations in the Tokyo area and public schools throughout Japan, for example, only have squat toilets. In addition, parks, temples, traditional Japanese restaurants, and older buildings typically only have squat toilets. Western-style toilets are usually indicated by the kanji characters 洋式 (yōshiki), the English words &quot;Western-style&quot;, a symbol for the type of toilet, or any combination of the three. Handicapped bathrooms are always Western style.

Many public toilets do not have soap for washing hands, or towels for drying hands. Many people carry a handkerchief with them for such occasions, and some even carry soap. Some public toilets are fitted with powerful hand dryers to reduce the volume of waste generated from paper towels. Hand dryers and taps are sometimes installed with motion-sensors as an additional resource-saving measure.

In a project launched by the Nippon Foundation, 16 well-known architects were asked to renovate 17 public toilets located in the public parks of Shibuya, Tokyo. Shigeru Ban designed restrooms that are surrounded by transparent tinted glass, which allows a person to evaluate the interior before entering. In August 2020, these restrooms were installed in Haru-no-Ogawa Community Park and the Yoyogi Fukamachi Mini Park.

== Cultural aspects ==
In the often-crowded living conditions of Japanese cities and with the lack of rooms that can be locked from inside in a traditional Japanese house, the toilet is one of the few rooms in the house that allows for a degree of privacy. Some toilet rooms are equipped with a bookshelf, in others people may enter with a newspaper, and some are even filled with character goods and posters. Even so, these toilets are whenever possible, in rooms separate from those for bathing. This is due to a concern about separating clean from unclean, and this attribute is a selling point in properties for rent.

Both the traditional squat toilet and the high-tech toilet are a source of confusion for foreigners unaccustomed to these devices. There are humorous reports of individuals using a toilet, and randomly pressing buttons on the control panel either out of curiosity or in search for the flushing control, and suddenly to their horror receiving an unexpected jet of water directed at the genitals or anus. As the water jet continues for a few seconds after the novice jumps up, he also gets himself or the bathroom wet. Many Japanese toilets now feature pressure-sensitive seats that automatically shut off the bidet when the user stands up. Many have the buttons labeled in English to reduce culture shock.

In January 2017, the Japan Sanitary Equipment Industry Association agreed to standardize the iconography used on control panels of Japanese toilets, in an attempt to reduce confusion for foreign visitors.

== Environmental aspects ==
The environmental impact of modern style washlets differs from regular flush toilets. Modern toilets use less water than old toilets, and the self-cleaning options also reduce the amount of detergent. Some toilets even change the amount of water for the flush depending if the seat was flipped up (indicating male urination) or not. They also cause less toilet paper to be used. On the other hand, these toilets also consume energy, and are estimated to consume 5% of the energy of the average Japanese household. In rural areas, toilets that use very little or no water have also been designed. These are also considered as emergency toilets in case of earthquakes.

===Toilet sinks===

Many toilets in Japan with a water tank include a built-in sink. This is a simple water-saving grey water system: clean municipal water is used to wash the hands, then the waste water from hand washing is used to fill the tank for flushing. It also is a space saving feature in small, older bathrooms.

== Market acceptance ==

Washlets in Japan cost from US$200, with the majority priced around US$500 for washlet upgrades for existing Western-style toilets. Top-of-the-range washlets, including the ceramic bowl, can cost up to US$5,000.

Toto Ltd. is the largest producer of toilets, including washlets, worldwide. Washlets and other toilet related products are also produced by Inax, and Panasonic.

The total market worldwide for high-tech toilets was about US$800 million in 1997. The largest producer in this category is Toto, with 65% of the market share, while the second largest is Inax at 25%. The main market for washlets is still in Japan, and Toto reports that overseas sales account for just 5% of its revenue. The primary foreign market is China, where Toto sells over one million washlets each year. In the US for example, sales are well below Japanese levels, even though sales improved from 600 units per month in 2001 to 1,000 units per month in 2003. In Europe, Toto sells only 5,000 washlets annually.

While most Europeans would probably regard Japanese washlets as quite a curiosity, the number of such toilets being installed in Europe is increasing. This is mainly for toilets for the handicapped. Depending on the type of disability, handicapped persons may have difficulties reaching the anus region to clean themselves after toilet use. Hence, the introduction of toilets with a water jet cleaner and blow dryer allows such persons to clean themselves without assistance.

There are several reasons for low sales outside of Japan. One main reason is that it takes time for customers to get used to the idea of a washlet. Sales in Japan were slow when the device was introduced in 1980. After some acclimatization, sales improved significantly starting in 1985. Around 1990, 10% of Japanese households had a washlet; this number increased to over 50% in 2002. Toto expects a corresponding improvement in foreign sales within a few years.

Another factor is the lack of a power supply near the toilet. While virtually all Japanese washrooms have an electric outlet behind the toilet, many foreign bathrooms lack a nearby outlet. In Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the UK, and many other countries, high current electrical outlets installed in close proximity to water, or where persons may be wet, are prohibited by codes due to possible health and safety concerns.

Lastly, the outlet of the toilet (for S-type toilets) is a maximum from the back wall, but Japanese toilets need it to be at least so an S-type European toilet cannot be replaced easily with a Japanese toilet. They are much more expensive than traditional Western toilets. In Europe, there is competition with the traditional Western bidet, while North Americans are unaccustomed to bidets.

== History ==
During the Jōmon period (1400 BC to 300 BC) settlements were built in a horseshoe shape, with a central plaza in the middle and garbage heaps around the settlement. In these garbage heaps, calcified fecal remains of humans or dogs, so called &quot;coprolites&quot;, were found, indicating that these garbage dumps were also used as toilets.

The earliest sewer systems are from the Yayoi period (300 BC to 250 AD). These systems were used in larger settlements, probably in combination with toilets.

A possible ritual site, that may also have been a toilet using flowing water, dating back to the early 3rd century was found in Sakurai, Nara. Another cesspit analyzed by archaeologists in detail was found at the site of the Fujiwara Palace in Kashihara, Nara, the first location of the imperial city from 694 to 710. This toilet was constructed over an open pit similar to an outhouse.

During the Nara period (710 to 784), a drainage system was created in the capital in Nara, consisting of 10–15 cm wide streams where the user could squat over with one foot on each side of the stream. Wooden sticks called &quot;chūgi&quot; were used as a sort of toilet paper. In earlier days seaweed was used for cleaning, but by the Edo period, these had been replaced by toilet paper made of washi (traditional Japanese paper). In the mountainous regions, wooden scrapers and large leaves were used too.

Often, toilets were constructed over a running stream; one of the first known flushing toilets was found at Akita castle, dating back to the 8th century, with the toilet constructed over a diverted stream.

However, historically, pit toilets were more common, as they were easier to build and allowed the reuse of the feces as fertilizer—very important in a country where Buddhism and its associated mostly vegetarian, pescetarian lifestyle acted to reduce dependence on livestock for food. The waste products of rich people were sold at higher prices because their diet was better.

Various historic documents dating from the 9th century describe laws regarding the construction of fresh and waste water channels, and detail the disposal procedures for toilet waste.

Prisoners shall be directed to clean up sewage at the Palace and government offices as well as toilets of the east and west on the morning after a rainy night
:— Collected Interpretations of the Administrative Laws &quot;Ryo-no-shuge&quot;

Selling human waste products as fertilizers became much less common after World War II, both for sanitary reasons and because of the proliferation of chemical fertilizers, and less than 1% is now used for fertilization. Because of this history, Japan had a much higher historical standard of hygiene. For example, in Japan, the orderly disposal of human waste was a common component of the culture. The first Westerner to visit Edo expressed his shock to see such a clean city.

In Okinawa, the toilet was often attached to the pig pen, and the pigs were fed with the human waste product. This practice was banned as unhygienic after World War II by the American authorities.

During the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1568 to 1600), the &quot;Taiko Sewerage&quot; was built around Osaka Castle, and it still exists and functions today. The use of modern sewage systems began in 1884, with the installation of the first brick and ceramic sewer in Kanda, Tokyo. More plumbing and sewage systems were installed after the Great Kantō earthquake to avoid diseases after future earthquakes. However, the construction of sewers increased only after World War II to cope with the waste products of the growing population centers. By the year 2000, 60% of the population was connected to a sewer system. The national Sewage Day is September 10.

Western-style toilets and urinals started to appear in Japan at the beginning of the 20th century, but only after World War II did their use become more widespread, due to the influence of the American occupation. The Occupation government eschewed the use of human excreta as fertilizer, which led to a sense of shame over this practice, and in rural areas where the practice had persisted, human waste quickly went from being recycled to being disposed of. Specific places where night soil continued to be recycled required conscious political leadership, such as the Shinkyō Commune in Nara Prefecture.

In 1977, the sale of Western-style toilets exceeded the sale of traditional squat toilets in Japan. Based on toilets with a built-in bidet from Switzerland and the US, the world&#x27;s largest sanitary equipment company, Toto, introduced the &quot;Washlet&quot; in 1980. Japanese companies currently produce some of the most advanced, highest tech toilets in the world.

<doc id="1049188" wikidata="Q5677498" url="?curid=1049188" title="Harvey Pitt">
<text>Harvey L. Pitt (February 28, 1945 – May 30, 2023) was an American lawyer. He served as the 26th chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for 18 months from August 2001 to February 2003, a period that encompassed the September 11 attacks and the Enron scandal.

Born in Brooklyn, New York, Pitt graduated from Brooklyn College with a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and from St. John&#x27;s University School of Law with a Juris Doctor. He then worked at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), eventually becoming the agency&#x27;s general counsel. Pitt was later a partner at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson, where he represented the Big Five accounting firms and other financial industry firms, before returning to the SEC as chairman.

== Early life and education ==
Pitt was born in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, New York, the son of a seamstress and of a butcher who worked his way up to become a vice president of the Waldbaum&#x27;s supermarket chain. When he was seven years old, the family moved to Marine Park, Brooklyn. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1961. He than graduated from Brooklyn College with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1965, and from St. John&#x27;s University School of Law with a Juris Doctor in 1968. He later received the Presidential Medal of Distinction from Brooklyn College in 2003, and an honorary LLD from St. John&#x27;s University School of Law. He was a Republican.

==Career at SEC==
From 1968 to 1978, Pitt served on the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), eventually becoming the agency&#x27;s youngest general counsel in 1975 at age 30. He was known for a blunt, mercurial, combative manner. Pitt was later a partner at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson, where beginning in 1978 he represented clients such as all of the Big Five accounting firms, the New York Stock Exchange, and &quot;virtually all the exchanges and investment houses.&quot; Pitt was later the chairman of the SEC, serving for 18 months between August 2001 and February 2003 (rather than his full five-year term), as he resigned abruptly in November 2002 during a wave of criticism.

During his tenure at the SEC, he was lauded by some for his response to the 9/11 attacks, and for crafting a new rule requiring large company executives to personally certify their company&#x27;s financial results. However, he was criticized for requesting that his pay be increased and his job as SEC chairman be elevated to Cabinet rank, for being too slow to react to corporate scandals, for meeting privately with his former clients while they were subjects of SEC investigations, for being too close to the accounting industry, and for reversing his commitment to support highly qualified candidate John H. Biggs to head the new Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The final criticism of him, by both Democrats and Republicans, was that he attempted to appoint as head of the new accounting oversight board 78-year-old William Webster, who chaired the audit committee of a company under SEC investigation for fraud and accounting irregularities, while the company lacked internal controlswithout informing the White House or the other SEC Commissioners that Webster was under scrutiny for his involvement in a corporate accounting fraud investigation. In November 2002, Pitt abruptly resigned under pressure as Chairman of the SEC, 15 months into what was to be a five-year term; he stepped down the following February.
Harvey Pitt was one of the founding members of the SEC Historical Society in 1999, a non-profit organization that preserves and shares the history of the SEC and financial regulation.
Later in his career, Pitt served as a columnist with &quot;Compliance Week&quot;, and as an expert witness.

=== Accomplishments ===
As the 26th Chairman of the SEC, succeeding Arthur Levitt, Pitt oversaw the SEC&#x27;s response to the market disruptions resulting from the terrorist attacks of 9/11, for which he was lauded by journalist Stephen Labaton as a &quot;voice of calm.&quot; Further, Labaton called Pitt the &quot;architect of the new rule requiring executives of large companies to personally certify their financial results.&quot; Pitt created the SEC&#x27;s &quot;real time enforcement&quot; program—a policy designed to make the SEC&#x27;s enforcement initiatives more efficient and effective for the protection of investors, and led the SEC&#x27;s unanimous adoption of dozens of rules implementing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

=== Criticism ===

In July 2002, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Democratic and Republican members of Congress joined administration officials today in ridiculing Harvey L. Pitt&#x27;s request that his pay be increased and his job as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission be elevated to Cabinet rank ... evoking an outpouring of bipartisan scorn.&quot; Pitt had tried to insert a provision into corporate antifraud legislation that would increase his pay by 21%, and also elevate his status to that of Cabinet level, on a par with the Secretary of State and Attorney General (and above that of the Director of the CIA), at a time when the stock markets had sunk to five-year lows and some congressional leaders were calling for him to resign. Tom Daschle, the Senate majority leader, who had previously called for Pitt to be dismissed, said: &quot;Of all the things he has to think about, it is amazing to me that this is what he&#x27;s spending his time thinking about. I think it makes our point, the point many of us had, that he is not qualified to serve in that position.&quot; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; questioned his credibility. Journalist Bill Keller opined in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Harvey Pitt ... must be the most politically tone-deaf man to serve in Washington since Earl Butz, who memorably justified junk-food school lunch programs by declaring that ketchup is a vegetable... The Democratic National Committee could not have invented Harvey Pitt.&quot;

Pitt became the target of criticism when, following his vow to the accounting industry in his first speech as SEC chairman to make the SEC a &quot;kinder and gentler place for accountants,&quot; the Enron scandal broke out on his watch, and was accused of being too slow to react to corporate scandals and market turmoil. Democrats alleged that he was too close to the accounting industry, and that he subverted efforts to tighten regulation in the wake of the Enron scandal and other cases of corporate malfeasance. He also raised concerns when he met privately with former clients of his while they were subjects of SEC investigations, and regularly remained in the room for SEC discussions of matters involving his former clients.”

In October 2002 Senate majority leader Daschle and House minority leader Richard A. Gephardt, urged President Bush to replace Pitt. They wrote that Pitt&#x27;s decision to reverse, after the accounting profession objected, the commitment that he had made one month prior to support highly qualified candidate John H. Biggs (a leading voice for reforming oversight of accountants), to head the new Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

Later in October 2002, Pitt attempted to appoint as head of the new accounting oversight board 78-year-old William Webster, who chaired the audit committee of a company under SEC investigation for fraud and accounting irregularities, while the company lacked internal controlswithout informing the White House or the other SEC Commissioners that Webster was under scrutiny for his involvement in a corporate accounting fraud investigation. After the company&#x27;s outside auditor raised concerns about the company&#x27;s financial controls, Webster—as head of the audit committee—had fired the auditor.

When Pitt reacted by saying his own agency would investigate his appointment of Webster, economist Paul Krugman wrote: &quot;Pitt&#x27;s response ... beats anything a satirist could have imagined.&quot; Democratic Senator Paul Sarbanes, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, called for Pitt&#x27;s resignation, as did Democratic Representative Edward Markey. Republican Senators including Mike Enzi (Wyoming), the only accountant in the Senate, and Richard Shelby (Alabama) joined John McCain in criticizing Pitt. &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot;, which had supported him in the past, opined: &quot;whether Pitt is clueless or arrogant doesn&#x27;t really matter... He has committed a rank deception. He must go.&quot; The U.S. Chamber of Commerce withdrew its support of Pitt. A GAO report later criticized Pitt for his lack of diligence in the decision to name Webster to head the accounting oversight board, while also finding that while Pitt was aware of the Webster fraud investigation he was not aware of certain details.

===Resignation===
Pitt abruptly resigned from the SEC under pressure after the polls closed on election night, on November 5, 2002, after what &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;a political firestorm over his selection of the head of a new board overseeing the accounting profession&quot;, which led to four investigations of his actions. One week later, Webster resigned as well. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in an opinion column, wrote: &quot;His stewardship of the S.E.C... was nothing short of disastrous.&quot; &quot;The New York Observer&quot; in its own opinion column wrote: &quot;Harvey Pitt is either a moron or a scoundrel.&quot; &quot;CFO Magazine&quot; wrote: Harvey Pitt may be gone, but what he left undone can’t be forgotten. The perpetually embattled chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission resigned on Election Night after 15 tumultuous months in office. Criticized for being too close to his former Wall Street clients, unable to build consensus, and arrogant to boot, he finally succumbed to criticism over his selection of William Webster to head the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

Pitt was just the second SEC Chairman to resign abruptly as a result of political turmoil. &quot;Slate magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;Of all Pitt’s transgressions, none has been more pathetic than his self-pitying denunciations of &#x27;guilt by occupation.&#x27; ... He accepted seedy clients not out of principle, but because he wanted to be a player, and because he wanted the money and publicity such assignments generated.&quot; In November 2002 journalist Calvin Trillin wrote a ballad about him, based on Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Demon Barber&quot;,&quot; that began: &quot;Attend the tale of Harvey Pitt, Who many thought was quite unfit&quot;.

When Pitt was asked in 2005 if he believed he could have left the SEC on a better note if he had stayed longer, he replied: &quot;I feel I left on a very high note.&quot;

==Later life==
Pitt was a columnist with &quot;Compliance Week&quot;.

Pitt also served later in his career as an expert witness. At the time of his unexpected death, he was the chief executive officer of the strategic consulting firm that he had founded, Kalorama Partners, LLC. In 2011, while at Kalorama and testifying in a deposition as an expert witness for securities class action plaintiffs suing Fannie Mae, he refused to answer any more questions and walked out of his deposition, leading to Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissing Pitt as an expert witness.

Pitt died on May 30, 2023, at the age of 78.

<doc id="1049191" wikidata="Q964981" url="?curid=1049191" title="Equivalent circuit">
<text>In electrical engineering, an equivalent circuit refers to a theoretical circuit that retains all of the electrical characteristics of a given circuit. Often, an equivalent circuit is sought that simplifies calculation, and more broadly, that is a simplest form of a more complex circuit in order to aid analysis. In its most common form, an equivalent circuit is made up of linear, passive elements. However, more complex equivalent circuits are used that approximate the nonlinear behavior of the original circuit as well. These more complex circuits often are called &quot;macromodels&quot; of the original circuit. An example of a macromodel is the Boyle circuit for the 741 operational amplifier.

==Examples==

===Thévenin and Norton equivalents===
One of linear circuit theory&#x27;s most surprising properties relates to the ability to treat any two-terminal circuit no matter how complex as behaving as only a source and an impedance, which have either of two simple equivalent circuit forms: 
*Thévenin equivalent – Any linear two-terminal circuit can be replaced by a single voltage source and a series impedance.
*Norton equivalent – Any linear two-terminal circuit can be replaced by a current source and a parallel impedance.
However, the single impedance can be of arbitrary complexity (as a function of frequency) and may be irreducible to a simpler form.

===DC and AC equivalent circuits===
In linear circuits, due to the superposition principle, the output of a circuit is equal to the sum of the output due to its DC sources alone, and the output from its AC sources alone. Therefore, the DC and AC response of a circuit is often analyzed independently, using separate DC and AC equivalent circuits which have the same response as the original circuit to DC and AC currents respectively. The composite response is calculated by adding the DC and AC responses:
*A DC equivalent of a circuit can be constructed by replacing all capacitances with open circuits, inductances with short circuits, and reducing AC sources to zero (replacing AC voltage sources by short circuits and AC current sources by open circuits.)
*An AC equivalent circuit can be constructed by reducing all DC sources to zero (replacing DC voltage sources with short circuits and DC current sources with open circuits)
This technique is often extended to small-signal nonlinear circuits like tube and transistor circuits, by linearizing the circuit about the DC bias point Q-point, using an AC equivalent circuit made by calculating the equivalent &quot;small signal&quot; AC resistance of the nonlinear components at the bias point.

===Two-port networks===

Linear four-terminal circuits in which a signal is applied to one pair of terminals and an output is taken from another, are often modeled as two-port networks. These can be represented by simple equivalent circuits of impedances and dependent sources. To be analyzed as a two port network the currents applied to the circuit must satisfy the &quot;port condition&quot;: the current entering one terminal of a port must be equal to the current leaving the other terminal of the port. By linearizing a nonlinear circuit about its operating point, such a two-port representation can be made for transistors: see hybrid pi and h-parameter circuits.

===Delta and Wye circuits===
In three phase power circuits, three phase sources and loads can be connected in two different ways, called a &quot;delta&quot; connection and a &quot;wye&quot; connection. In analyzing circuits, sometimes it simplifies the analysis to convert between equivalent wye and delta circuits. This can be done with the wye-delta transform.

===Li-ion batteries===
The electrical behavior of a Lithium-ion battery cell is often approximated by an equivalent circuit model. Such a model consists of a voltage generator driven by the state of charge, representing the open-circuit voltage of the cell, a resistor representing the internal resistance of the cell, and some RC parallels to simulate the dynamic voltage transients. 

==In biology==
Equivalent circuits can be used to electrically describe and model either a) continuous materials or biological systems in which current does not actually flow in defined circuits or b) distributed reactances, such as found in electrical lines or windings, that do not represent actual discrete components. For example, a cell membrane can be modelled as a capacitance (i.e. the lipid bilayer) in parallel with resistance-DC voltage source combinations (i.e. ion channels powered by an ion gradient across the membrane).

<doc id="1049195" wikidata="Q1514991" url="?curid=1049195" title="The Arizona Republic">
<text>The Arizona Republic is an American daily newspaper published in Phoenix. Circulated throughout Arizona, it is the state&#x27;s largest newspaper. Since 2000, it has been owned by the Gannett newspaper chain.

==History==

===Early years===
The newspaper was founded May 19, 1890, under the name The Arizona Republican.

Dwight B. Heard, a Phoenix land and cattle baron, ran the newspaper from 1912 until his death in 1929. The paper was then run by two of its top executives, Charles Stauffer and W. Wesley Knorpp, until it was bought by Midwestern newspaper magnate Eugene C. Pulliam in 1946. Stauffer and Knorpp had changed the newspaper&#x27;s name to &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; in 1930, and also had bought the rival &quot;Phoenix Evening Gazette&quot; and &quot;Phoenix Weekly Gazette&quot;, later known, respectively, as &quot;The Phoenix Gazette&quot; and the &quot;Arizona Business Gazette&quot;.

===Pulliam era===
Pulliam, who bought the two &quot;Gazettes&quot; as well as the &quot;Republic&quot;, ran all three newspapers until his death in 1975 at the age of 86. A strong period of growth came under Pulliam, who imprinted the newspaper with his conservative brand of politics and his drive for civic leadership. Pulliam was considered one of the influential business leaders who created the modern Phoenix area as it is known today.

Pulliam&#x27;s holding company, Central Newspapers, Inc., as led by Pulliam&#x27;s widow and son, assumed operation of the Republic/Gazette family of papers upon the elder Pulliam&#x27;s death. &quot;The Phoenix Gazette&quot; was closed in 1997 and its staff merged with that of the &quot;Republic&quot;. The &quot;Arizona Business Gazette&quot; is still published to this day.

In 1998, a weekly section geared towards college students, &quot;The Rep&quot;, went into circulation. Specialized content is also available in the local sections produced for many of the different cities and suburbs that make up the Phoenix metropolitan area.

===Gannett purchase===
Central Newspapers was purchased by Gannett in 2000, bringing it into common ownership with &quot;USA Today&quot; and the local Phoenix NBC television affiliate, KPNX. The &quot;Republic&quot; and KPNX combine their forces to produce their common local news subscription website, www.azcentral.com; &quot;The Republic&quot; and KPNX separated in 2015 when Gannett split into separate print and broadcast companies. Also in 2000, the Spanish-language publication &quot;La Voz&quot; was founded.

On September 25, 2015, Mi-Ai Parrish was named publisher and president of both the paper and its azcentral.com website, effective October 12.

=== Circulation ===
In 2013, &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; dropped from the sixteenth largest daily newspaper in the United States to the twenty-first largest, by circulation. In 2020 it had a circulation of about 116,000 for its daily edition, and 337,000 for its Sunday edition.

===Don Bolles murder===

In 1976, an investigative reporter for the newspaper, Don Bolles, was the victim of a car bombing. He had been lured to a meeting in Phoenix in the course of work on a story about corruption in local politics and business and the bomb detonated as he started his car to leave. He died eleven days later. Retaliation against his pursuit of organized crime in Arizona is thought to be a motive in the murder.

== Political endorsements ==

Historically, &quot;The Republic&quot; has tilted conservative editorially. It endorsed President George W. Bush in both the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. On October 25, 2008, the paper endorsed Senator John McCain for president.

In local elections, it endorsed in recent years Democratic candidates such as former Arizona governor, former Secretary of Homeland Security, and former University of California president Janet Napolitano; and former Arizona Congressman Harry Mitchell.

On September 27, 2016, the paper endorsed Hillary Clinton for the 2016 presidential election, marking the first time in the paper&#x27;s 126-year history that it had endorsed a Democratic candidate for president. Previously, the paper had only withheld its endorsement from a Republican nominee/candidate twice in its history.

During the unusual sequence of events that led up to the 1912 presidential election the paper had opted not to endorse the &quot;formal&quot; Republican party nominee for that election cycle. This was shortly after Theodore Roosevelt had lost the Republican convention nomination to William Howard Taft in the controversial, and allegedly rigged, party convention of that year. After Roosevelt&#x27;s convention loss, and also after the hasty formation of the &quot;made to order&quot; Bull Moose Party, the paper continued to endorse Roosevelt via the newly formed party. As a result of Roosevelt&#x27;s insistence on an independent presidential bid that year, the Republican Party of 1912 was in disarray, yielding that year&#x27;s presidential election to the Democrats, with the GOP only able to carry a total of eight electoral votes that year. Two of the main planks of Roosevelt&#x27;s progressive Bull Moose platform had been campaign finance reform and improved governmental accountability.

In the 1968 presidential election, the paper declined to endorse either Richard Nixon or Hubert Humphrey, asserting that &quot;all candidates are good candidates.&quot; In the paper&#x27;s 2016 editorial decision to take the further step of actually endorsing a Democratic candidate for the first time, the paper argued that despite Clinton&#x27;s flaws, it could not support Republican nominee Donald Trump, denouncing him as &quot;not conservative&quot; and &quot;not qualified.&quot; The board also argued that Trump had &quot;deep character flaws... (and) ... stunning lack of human decency, empathy and respect,&quot; suggesting that it was evidence he &quot;doesn&#x27;t grasp our national ideals.&quot; The paper also noted its concern regarding whether or not Trump would possess the necessary restraint needed for someone with access to nuclear weapons, stating, &quot;The president commands our nuclear arsenal. Trump can&#x27;t command his own rhetoric.&quot;

On February 26, 2020, &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; announced that it would no longer endorse candidates for public office.

<doc id="1049200" wikidata="Q7386516" url="?curid=1049200" title="Róger Calero">
<text>Róger Calero (born 1969) is a Nicaraguan journalist living in the United States and one of the leaders of the Socialist Workers Party. He was SWP candidate for President of the United States in 2004 and 2008, and for the United States Senate in New York in 2006.

==Early life==
Calero was born in Nicaragua in 1969. He and his family fled via Los Angeles, California, in 1985. Calero has been a lawful permanent resident of the United States (holding a green card) since 1990. While in Los Angeles, Calero joined a socialist movement and helped mobilize support against Proposition 187 in the early 90s.

Calero, a former meat packer, has been associate editor of &quot;Perspectiva Mundial&quot; (official Spanish language newspaper of the SWP) and a staff writer for &quot;The Militant&quot; (official English language newspaper of the SWP).

He now lives in Newark, New Jersey.

==Legal problems==
Calero was convicted of felony sale of marijuana in 1988. In December 2002, immigration police arrested Calero upon his return to the United States at the George Bush Intercontinental Airport from reporting assignments at a conference held in Havana, Cuba, protesting the Free Trade Area of the Americas. He was threatened with deportation in 2002 as a result of his previous conviction in 1988.

The SWP considered the conviction to have been a political attack and launched a huge campaign in defense of Calero, mobilizing the party&#x27;s members and supporters in the U.S. and all over the world. The U.S. government released Calero in 2003 and cancelled the deportation. The same year, Calero went on an international tour, visiting not only the major cities in the US, but also Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Iceland to greet his supporters.

==Electoral campaigns==
In 2004, Róger Calero was the SWP candidate for President of the United States and received 3,689 votes, with Arrin Hawkins running for vice president. Because he is not a natural born citizen of the United States, Calero is ineligible to become U.S. president under the United States Constitution, meaning that even had he won the election, he would not have been permitted to serve, and so James Harris, the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party presidential candidate from 2000, stood in on the ticket in nine states where Calero could not be listed, receiving 7,102 additional votes.

In 2006, Róger Calero appeared on the ballot in New York as the Socialist Workers Party candidate for US Senate. He received 6,967 votes.

Róger Calero again ran for President of the United States representing the SWP in the 2008 presidential election, together with Alyson Kennedy for vice-president. Again, James Harris stood in for Calero in several states. In the 2008 presidential election, Calero was on the ballot in five states, where he received 7,209 votes. Coupled with the 2,424 votes received in the five states where Harris was on the ballot.

<text>Randall Carline Swingler MM (28 May 1909 – 19 June 1967) was an English poet, writing extensively in the 1930s in the communist interest.

==Early life and education==
His was a prosperous upper middle class Anglican family in Aldershot, with an industrial background in the Midlands and earlier aristocratic roots in Scotland. His uncle and godfather was Randall Davidson, the Archbishop of Canterbury (1903 – 1928) and he was the cousin of the writer Sir Walter Scott. He was educated at Winchester College, and New College, Oxford.

Swingler served with the British Army in Italy in the Second World War. His egalitarian beliefs led him to refuse a commission and he joined the Royal Corps of Signals as a private soldier, repeatedly refusing offers of a battlefield commission. He saw action in the Italian campaign. In 1945, Corporal Swingler was awarded the Military Medal (MM) &quot;in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in Italy&quot;.

==Music and literature==
Swingler was an accomplished flautist, playing regularly with the professional London orchestras. He was later much involved in musical collaboration as a librettist, including song cycles with Benjamin Britten (&quot;Advance Democracy&quot;, 1938), Alan Bush (&quot;The Winter Journey&quot;, 1946) and Alan Rawsthorne (&quot;A Canticle of Man&quot;, 1953). His friend John Sykes also set the four poems of &quot;Homage to John Dowland&quot; in 1957. Among several notable pieces, Swingler co-wrote &quot;Ballad of Heroes&quot; with Britten and the poet W. H. Auden and wrote a new version of the English lyrics of the Polish revolutionary song &quot;Whirlwinds of Danger&quot;. There are settings of his verse by Arnold Cooke, Christian Darnton, Erik Chisholm, Norman Demuth, John Ireland, Elisabeth Lutyens, and Bernard Stevens.

His war poetry (1935-1945), including examples such as &#x27;Heavy Shelling at Night&#x27;, &#x27;Briefing for Invasion&#x27; and &#x27;The Day the War Ended...&#x27; was collected in &quot;The Years of Anger&quot;, first published in 1946. Since his death, Swingler has been recognised as a central figure in communist English poetry. His biographer, the poet Andy Croft, has written that, as an editor, speaker, organiser, journalist, critic, playwright, poet, librettist, novelist and publisher, he was one of the leading figures in the cultural activities of the Communist Party. Croft has also calls him &quot;the last of the Georgian poets&quot; and says that his poetry &quot;had a moral and political urgency&quot;.

Swingler operated in North London, as a close associate of Nancy Cunard, sometimes lending his name. He was one of the organisers of the covert Writer&#x27;s Group of the late 1930s, attempting to co-ordinate a &#x27;literary policy&#x27; of the Left. He was also involved in work for the Unity Theatre, and was the literary editor of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;, often reviewing books for &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, amongst other newspapers.

==Politics==
Swingler joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in 1934. His numerous ventures as a literary entrepreneur included the setting up of Fore Publications (1938), editing the magazines &quot;Left Review&quot; (from 1937 to 1938), &quot;Arena&quot;, &quot;Seven&quot; (taken over in wartime, mainly for the paper stock), &quot;Our Time&quot;, and the publishing of the &quot;Key Books&quot;, and later &quot;Key Poets&quot; series. These proved more influential than his Blake-flavoured verse, which has consistently been criticised (and scarcely defended, except by Andy Croft).

In 1952 the poet Randall Swingler wrote a poem titled &quot;The Ballad of Herod Templer&quot; mocking British general Gerald Templer and his attempts to destroy communists during the Malayan Emergency. The poem is believed to have been inspired by the British Malayan headhunting scandal.

With his brother, the Labour MP Stephen Swingler, he was involved in Barnett Stross&#x27;s Lidice Shall Live campaign, and wrote the words to the piece &quot;A Rose For Lidice&quot; (music by Alan Rawsthorne), which was performed at the opening of the memorial rose garden in Lidice in 1955.

He left the CPGB in 1956. He was a founder of E. P. Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The New Reasoner&quot; (from 1957).

==Personal life==
He was married to the concert pianist and tutor at the Guildhall, Geraldine Peppin. They had an open marriage and Swingler had an affair with actor and activist Ann Davies from 1939 to 1941.

Swingler died unexpectedly on 19 Jun 1967 at Charing Cross Hospital. Westminster. His daughter Judith married the composer Edward Williams. She died in 2022.

<text>The Aspy River () is a river on northeastern Cape Breton Island which rises in the Cape Breton Highlands and empties into Aspy Bay. The North Aspy follows the ancient Aspy Fault which extends for 40 km inland from the coast and extends along the upper section of the northeast Margaree River. This geological fault is thought to be a part of the Cabot Fault (Newfoundland)/ Great Glen Fault (Scotland) system of Avalonia.

It is believed by some sources that John Cabot landed at Aspy Bay in 1497. In 1856, a submarine cable was laid across the Cabot Strait from Aspy Bay to Newfoundland establishing a telegraph link between St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and New York City.

A dirt road in Cape Breton Highlands National Park leads to the Beulach Ban falls on the North Aspy River. &quot;Beulach Ban&quot; is Gaelic for &quot;white gorge&quot;.

<doc id="1049203" wikidata="Q230740" url="?curid=1049203" title="Open bolt">
<text>A firearm is said to fire from an open bolt or open breech if, when ready to fire, the bolt and working parts are held to the rear of the receiver, with no round in the chamber. When the trigger is actuated, the bolt travels forward, feeds a cartridge from the magazine or belt into the chamber, and fires that cartridge in the same movement. Like any other self-loading design, the action is cycled by the energy released from the propellant, which sends the bolt back to the rear, compressing the mainspring in readiness for firing the next round. In an open-bolt gun firing semi-automatically, the bolt is caught and held at this point by the sear after each shot; and in automatic open-bolt fire, it&#x27;s caught and held in this manner whenever the trigger is released. In contrast to this, in closed-bolt guns, the trigger and sear do not affect the movement of the bolt directly.

Generally, an open-bolt firing cycle is used for fully automatic weapons and not for semi-automatic weapons (except some semi-automatic conversions of automatic designs). Firearms using advanced primer ignition blowback inherently fire from open bolt only.

==Advantages==
Compared to a closed-bolt design, open-bolt weapons generally have fewer moving parts. The firing pin is often part of the bolt, saving on manufacturing costs; the inertia of the bolt closing also causes the fixed firing pin to strike a blow on the primer, without need for a separate hammer/striker and spring. In automatic weapons, an open bolt helps eliminate the dangerous phenomenon known as &quot;cook-off&quot;, in which the firing chamber becomes so hot that rounds spontaneously fire without trigger input. Open-bolt designs typically remain much cooler in operation than closed-bolt types due to the airflow allowed into the chamber, action and barrel during pauses between bursts; moreover, unlike in the case of the closed-bolt format, the initial round in a burst is not introduced into the chamber until the moment before firing, and is thus only exposed to the residual heat for a fraction of a second. These two features combine to make open-bolt operation more suitable for weapons such as machine guns, which are intended to be capable of prolonged automatic fire. Open-bolt firearms also allow water drainage in underwater firearms.

==Disadvantages==
Firstly, the bolt retention mechanism may fail, resulting in a spontaneous discharge (i.e., without prior trigger input), with potentially dangerous consequences. Some simple submachine gun designs, such as the Sten, can discharge spontaneously when dropped onto a hard surface – even when uncocked – as the collision can jolt the bolt backward far enough that on returning it will pick up a round from the magazine, chamber it and fire it; the risk is intrinsic to hand-held open-bolt guns unless safety features are included in the design.

Another shortcoming of the open-bolt principle is that there is a brief delay between the trigger-pull and the firing of the cartridge because the (rather inert) bolt has to move forward a significant distance between the two events. Since after the first shot an open-bolt firearm operates effectively indistinguishably from a closed-bolt firearm, this latency problem is generally less of a concern in full automatic fire and mostly applies to semi-automatic mode. The issue was most problematic in the use of forward-firing open-bolt machine guns and autocannons in (tractor configuration single-engine) fighters during the piston engine era. Given the highly dynamic nature of aerial combat, the aforementioned intrinsic firing delay of open-bolt guns is particularly undesirable. The inertia and latency inherent to the open bolt design negatively affects predictability and control and makes fitting open-bolt designs with synchronization gear to fire through the propeller blades difficult and often requiring extensive modification (but not impossible).

Furthermore, with unlocked simple blowback action designs, calibers over 9×19mm Parabellum become increasingly less practical because of the need for correspondingly heavier bolts as the chamber pressure increases. In simple blowback open-bolt designs, even in such relatively low-power calibers, the movement of the heavy bolt mass within the gun negatively affects aim and accuracy in two ways:

# In sustained automatic fire, it is difficult to keep the gun on target;
# In semi-automatic fire, or at the beginning of each automatic burst, the &quot;latency problem&quot; described above is exacerbated (due to the greater inertia of the heavier bolt).

While the latency is unavoidable with the open-bolt design, more sophisticated delayed-blowback open-bolt designs do allow for use of a lighter bolt, thus reducing the gap in performance between open and closed bolt types. However, these designs are uncommon due to economics and complexity.

Lastly, unless an ejection port cover is used, breech and action internals&#x27; exposure to the elements renders open-bolt designs universally vulnerable to contamination with dirt and dust through the open ejection port. Some versions of the open-bolt M3 submachine gun utilize a hinged sheet metal ejection port cover that doubles as a safety; when closed, it both covers the ejection port and blocks the bolt from closing. When ready to fire, the user simply flips the cover down, opening the ejection port and unblocking the bolt.

==Other characteristics==

An open-bolt weapon will typically have a higher rate of automatic fire than a comparable closed-bolt weapon as the bolt simply needs to return forwards in order for the weapon to fire again, while a closed-bolt design has the additional step of the hammer striking the firing pin. Having a higher fire rate can be both an advantage and disadvantage depending on the situation. For handheld weapons, typically a lower rate of fire is desirable, as this will conserve ammunition and help keep the level of recoil more manageable. For vehicle-mounted weapons or fixed emplacements, however, a higher rate of fire is often desirable. In these situations, ammunition and recoil are less of a concern and the higher rate of fire will increase the likelihood of a round hitting the target, particularly when employed against fast-moving targets such as aircraft.

Many movies and video games portray open-bolt weapons as needing to be cycled after reloading. This is not generally true, however, as open-bolt weapons send the bolt carrier back into a cocked position via the excess gas after the last round is fired. The exception to this is if the weapon is fully automatic and the trigger is held down after the last round was fired (and the gun does not have a &quot;last round bolt hold open&quot; mechanism) at which point the bolt will fly forward once more and stay there. In this case, the bolt merely needs to be retracted to the rearward position and does not return forward as is sometimes portrayed.

Another feature of open-bolt designs is that the magazine simply needs to be removed to completely unload the weapon. A closed bolt requires the second step of cycling the action to remove the last round in the chamber (unless the weapon features an automatic hold-open device). It is essential to remove a loaded magazine before performing maintenance, or trying to cycle or close the bolt (as is often done to keep the weapon clean when not in use). If one were to close the bolt (say by pulling the trigger and riding the bolt to the closed position), as soon as the bolt closes it will fire if a loaded magazine was left in the gun. This may be true with weapons utilizing a striker, but not with a weapon using a fixed firing pin, which relies on the momentum of the bolt to impart the energy to ignite the primer. This is a common feature in basic submachine guns like the Sten gun or M3 &quot;Grease Gun&quot;, and even some machine guns. With a fixed firing pin, when the bolt is closed gently, without the momentum of the bolt closing at normal speed, there is not enough force imparted to the firing pin to ignite the primer. In this circumstance there will be a round in the chamber and a firing pin pressing on it with some force, but not enough to ignite the primer, which requires a sharp, focused impact. However, the weapon would be at risk of firing if dropped, much like the danger of loading spitzer bullets into a weapon with a tube magazine. A related issue is that the safety of an open-bolt weapon must be designed to lock the bolt in the rearward position. Often safeties only block the movement of the trigger, so, as explained above, if the weapon is dropped or if the sear becomes worn, the bolt can slam home, firing the weapon (although this issue is true to a degree in closed-bolt firearms as well).

==Uses==

Closed-bolt designs are often used in rifles. The improved accuracy of closed-bolt weapons is more desirable, while the poorer heat dissipation is less of an issue for slower-firing weapons. In contrast, open-bolt designs are more often used in automatic weapons, such as machine guns. For fast-firing automatic weapons, heat will rapidly build up from sustained firing, but accuracy is of less importance. Thus, the improved heat dissipation of open-bolt designs is generally more desirable in automatic weapons. Submachine guns were for much of their life designed with open bolts such as the Thompson submachine gun, MP-40 and the Uzi, mainly for the simplicity and economical advantages, and their rates of fire and close-range nature mitigated the reduced accuracy of the design. SMGs used and built in the current day, such as the H&amp;K MP5 series, have almost universally moved to closed-bolt designs for their practical advantages.

==Legality==

=== United States ===
Under United States federal law, machineguns are restricted under the National Firearms Act and other laws. Beginning in 1982, the ATF started classifying some open bolt firearms as machineguns, namely the KG-9 pistol, SM-10 pistol, SM-11A pistol, SAC Carbine, and the YAC Sten MK II. Around the time of these rulings, the manufacture of new open-bolt semi-automatic firearms became uncommon in the United States. The open bolt semi-automatic versions of certain guns are often as costly as their fully automatic counterparts since, prior to the Hughes Amendment, many such guns were lawfully converted into machineguns. However, there are many open-bolt firearms, that are not classified as machine guns. The Fox Carbine is one such example of an open-bolt firearm that was ruled to not be a machine gun.

<text>Mortal Kombat Trilogy is a fighting game released by Midway in 1996 as the second and final update to &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (the first being &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot;) for the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn and PCs. Further versions were also released for the Game.com and R-Zone. It features a similar basic gameplay system and the same story as &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, but adds characters and stages restored from &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;. New additions to the game included the &quot;Aggressor&quot; bar. The Brutality mechanic was introduced with this installment. The game was met with positive to mixed reviews upon release.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot; introduces the &quot;Aggressor&quot; bar, which fills as the combatants fight (twice as much if the opponent is blocking). Once the bar is filled, it grants the character fast movement and greater attack damage for a short period of time.

Many characters gained additional special moves. Some were simple edits of existing moves (such as Stryker throwing two grenades instead of one), while others were unused animations never implemented in their intended previous games. These special moves included &quot;MK1&quot; Kano&#x27;s Knife Spin move, &quot;MKII&quot; Kung Lao&#x27;s Air Torpedo, Goro&#x27;s Spinning Punch move, Raiden&#x27;s Lightning that shoots from behind the opponent, and Baraka&#x27;s Blade Spin move. Additionally, Shao Kahn gained a throw and grab-and-punch move, and Motaro gained a proper throw move. Sub-Zero&#x27;s famous &quot;Spine Rip&quot; Fatality reappears in the game but is completely censored, as the screen blacks out with only the &quot;Fatality&quot; text visible. This was due to avoid having to re-animate the fatality for this game.

&quot;Trilogy&quot; introduces the &quot;Brutality&quot; finishing move, which consists of repeatedly attacking the opponent until they explode. It was incorporated into the Mega Drive/Genesis and SNES ports of &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, which were released the same month as &quot;Trilogy&quot;. All of the arenas that featured a Stage Fatality are featured in this game, except for the one in the Pit II, for similar reasons to the &quot;Spine Rip&quot; Fatality.

All of the battle arenas that were featured in &quot;MKII&quot;, &quot;MK3&quot;, and &quot;UMK3&quot; are available in &quot;MKT&quot;, but only four backgrounds from the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; are featured (Courtyard, Goro&#x27;s Lair, the Pit, and the Pit Bottom). The PC, PlayStation, and Sega Saturn versions lack The Hidden Portal and Noob&#x27;s Dorfen stages from &quot;MK3&quot;, while the Nintendo 64 version lacks Kahn&#x27;s Arena and the Bank from &quot;MKII&quot; and &quot;MK3&quot;, respectively. 

== Characters ==
Along with the &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; roster, including those who were originally hidden and specific console exclusives in previous iterations, &quot;Trilogy&quot; adds Raiden and Baraka exactly as they appeared in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, with added running animations especially created for &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot;. The actors of both characters were Carlos Pesina as Raiden (except for one sprite, which was portrayed by Sal Divita, who portrayed Sektor, Cyrax, Cyborg Smoke and Nightwolf), and Richard Divizio as Baraka (who also portrayed Kano and Kabal, including Noob Saibot only in &quot;MK3&quot;), respectively. Johnny Cage was also added to the roster, this time portrayed by Chris Alexander (replacing Daniel Pesina, Carlos&#x27; brother, who was legally at odds with Midway), making him the only character exclusive to this version of the game. He kept his moves from &quot;MKII&quot; except for the Split Punch, which was excluded since none of the characters from &quot;MK3&quot;/&quot;UMK3&quot; had graphics for getting hit in the groin. Bosses Goro, Kintaro, Motaro and Shao Kahn are also playable characters from the start (except for the Nintendo 64 version, where only Motaro and Shao Kahn are included and must be unlocked via a cheat menu). The PC, PlayStation and Saturn versions also contain alternate versions of Jax, Kung Lao, Kano and Raiden as they appeared in the first two titles. Unlike in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, Raiden, Jax and Baraka in this game did not get proper running animations and just feature a sped-up version of their walk animation when they try to run.

Two new secret characters appear as well, depending on the version of the game. Most versions have Chameleon, a semi-transparent ninja who rapidly switches between all the other male ninjas (Classic Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Noob Saibot, Human Smoke, Rain, Reptile, and Ermac) during combat, portrayed by John Turk (who also portrayed unmasked Sub-Zero and Shang Tsung). This character is playable by performing a special button combination. The Nintendo 64 version replaced him with a female character named Khameleon, who switches between the female ninjas instead (Kitana, Mileena, and Jade), portrayed by Becky Gable.

== Development ==
Actors Ho Sung Pak (Liu Kang), Philip Ahn (Shang Tsung), Elizabeth Malecki (Sonya Blade), Katalin Zamiar (Kitana/Mileena/Jade) and Dan Pesina (Johnny Cage and Scorpion/Sub-Zero/Reptile/Smoke) all left Midway prior to the production of the game due to royalty disputes, and so their respective roles were played by new actors. Initially publisher Williams Entertainment stated that Johnny Cage would not be included in the game at all due to the dispute with Pesina. Carlos Pesina&#x27;s original sprites were used for Raiden&#x27;s gameplay, but Sal Divita&#x27;s image was used for his versus screen picture.

Most of the background music tracks from &quot;MKII&quot; and &quot;MK3&quot; remained intact, especially for the CD-ROM versions of the game. In all versions of the game, many of the tracks do not match their respective arenas when compared to their original arcade counterparts. In all versions of &quot;MKT&quot;, none of the music from the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; game is used. All of the CD-ROM games read the background music directly from the CD, providing high-quality CD sound, but all of the music loops are used when &quot;Finish Him/Her&quot; appears. All of the music taken from &quot;MK3&quot; on the CD-ROM &quot;MKT&quot; games is noticeably slowed down in both speed and pitch. When these particular songs were converted to &quot;MKT&quot;&#x27; Red Book CD-DA quality, they were downsampled without resampling them to maintain the original tempo and pitch in the PC, PlayStation, and Saturn versions.

== Release ==

=== PlayStation ===
This version was developed by Avalanche Software. There are at least three public revisions of this game for the PlayStation; the final version is the North American Greatest Hits and European Platinum edition. With each revision, aspects of the gameplay were refined, producing gameplay closer to that of &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; for the arcade. Many of the infinite combos and bugs found in the game only existed in earlier revisions. Shang Tsung never appears anywhere within the &quot;Choose Your Destiny&quot; towers, probably because of the loading delays when morphing in the PlayStation version (there are options to completely turn off morphs or let the system load two additional characters into memory when playing as Shang Tsung, thus eliminating the long loading delays when morphing). The only time the CPU ever controls Tsung is during the attract mode.

After beating the PlayStation version of the game, the final message in the credits says &quot;&quot;MK4&quot; coming in 1997&quot;. This version of the game exhibits a number of bugs when played on a PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 3 console which causes the game to freeze at certain points.

=== Nintendo 64 ===
The Nintendo 64 port is based on the Windows PC and PlayStation versions of &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; and the Sega Saturn version of &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, and was developed by Williams Entertainment&#x27;s San Diego development division, Leland Interactive Media. This edition includes 3-on-3 simultaneous battles as an exclusive feature. In this version, like in the arcade, the player begins the game with four credits, but after playing a two-player match, the player earns an extra credit, while in the CD-ROM versions anyone can play for free. Free Play must be unlocked on the N64 version, which also has a more cohesive &quot;Supreme Demonstration&quot; feature (which shows every Fatality, Babality, Friendship, Animality, and Brutality for every character) than the PS or Saturn versions (as the latter versions needed to load the Fatalities and thus cannot show every one in the allotted time). This version only uses music from &quot;MK3&quot; and is of considerably lower quality than the CD versions. However, all ending tunes and music loops used during the &quot;Finish Him/Her&quot; sequences are intact, unlike in the CD-ROM versions. For some MK3/UMK3 backgrounds, the incorrect background track is used compared to one used for arcade UMK3.

Due to cartridge limitations, only 30 characters are included, instead of the 37 featured in the other console versions. The N64 port lacks Goro and Kintaro; the classic versions of Jax, Kung Lao, Kano, and Raiden; as well as the unmasked Sub-Zero (however, the masked Sub-Zero can perform both Sub-Zeros&#x27; special moves). Chameleon is replaced with the secret character Khameleon, a grey female ninja that randomly switches between Kitana, Mileena and Jade. The N64 version of the game, like &quot;MK3&quot; and &quot;UMK3&quot;, provides the player with an &quot;Ultimate Kombat Kode&quot; screen after a single-player game is over, where a 6-digit code can be entered to unlock Human Smoke and Khameleon for normal play.

Like the Saturn version, the font of the lifebars for the male and female ninjas is of a different font (Revue) versus the other characters (italicized Arial). Further, the &quot;new&quot; characters: Noob Saibot, Rain, Baraka, Rayden, Johnny Cage, and Khameleon use italicized Arial, but with greater spacing than the original MK3 characters. Also, the announcer does not speak the character&#x27;s name once Shang Tsung morphs into them, unlike arcade UMK3.

The N64 game also includes a new stage, the Star Bridge, made of the Pit II&#x27;s background with a star-filled sky. Some older backgrounds are also enhanced with extra graphics and added animation. For example, the Pit I features two different sky backgrounds (a pitch-black, star-filled sky in the N64 version, and the same sky background as the Pit II in the CD-ROM versions); Kahn&#x27;s Kave has animated clouds and a glowing floor added to it; and the Lost Bridge has Hornbuckle and Blaze appear at random in the background. In the N64 version, the Graveyard stage has more names on the gravestones near the front: besides those of the original Midway design team for &quot;MK3&quot;, names of the team at Williams Entertainment were added, and the date of death on the stones was changed to the creators&#x27; birthdates.

In development for the N64 game, both The Bank and Kahn&#x27;s Arena backgrounds were included, seeming to be building on the UMK3 version made for the Saturn previously. In Kahn&#x27;s Arena, both Raiden and Baraka (where Kano and Sonya in MK2, respectively) were held captive by Kahn if not actively participating in the fight. The captured animations are made of different frames of the respective character&#x27;s winning pose. Kahn&#x27;s Arena recycled The Bridge background music. Since this was only seen in beta versions and not in the final game, the reason for their capture is unknown as well as any impact on the story. Additionally, at the conclusion of the battle, Kahn rises from his seat, something rumored to have been considered for inclusion in MK2 (either after defeating Kintaro or at the end of the match) but ultimately was not.

In this version, there are two secret menus, because not all the playable characters are unlocked from the start. Motaro and Shao Kahn can each perform a Fatality exclusive to this port. They also have an aggressor meter, unlike in other versions. In the Subway&#x27;s stage fatality, new animations were added for the characters. Nightwolf has a very different Friendship move exclusive to this version, which he pulls out 3 hatchets and begins to juggle, as opposed to turning into Raiden since this character became playable in this game (although in the other versions, Nightwolf retains his original &quot;MK3&quot; Friendship move). In addition, many frames of animation were cut from each character.

=== Sega Saturn ===
The Sega Saturn version, converted by Point of View and released almost a year after the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions, is a straight conversion of the PlayStation version without any substantial changes in content. Due to hardware differences and inadequate code adapting, the porting process from the PlayStation had some technical changes, which included the replacement of almost all transparency effects with mesh patterns and the loss of certain voice samples, like most fighters&#x27; running yells and some alternative phrases used by characters like Raiden and Scorpion in their attacks.

=== MS-DOS and Windows===
The MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows versions are direct ports from the PlayStation by Point of View and released almost at the same time as the Saturn port. These versions have faster load times than the PlayStation. There are at least two public revisions of the game, the latest of them characterized by the word &quot;final&quot; next to the version number in the about dialog box, and featuring gameplay identical to the Greatest Hits release on PlayStation.

The game was re-released digitally on GOG.com on 15 August 2022.

=== Game.com ===
The game was a launch release for the Game.com handheld console. The game includes a multiplayer mode, accessible only with the compete.com game link cable (to link two Game.com consoles together). Only 13 characters (Cyrax, Ermac, Jade, Mileena, Sektor, Kitana, Motaro, Nightwolf, Noob Saibot, Raiden, Rain, Reptile and Shao Kahn) and 10 Kombat Zones remain in this version (screenshots of early releases showed a different assortment of characters). In addition, each character only has two special moves and four finishing moves: one Fatality, Babality, Friendship, and Brutality. In this version, each finishing move has the same command for every character.

== Reception ==
The game&#x27;s critical reception has varied considerably, depending on the platform and publication. Brazilian magazine &quot;SuperGamePower&quot; gave the Nintendo 64 version 4.8 out of 5, and regarded it as the best Mortal Kombat game. French magazine &quot;Super Power&quot; gave the N64 game 91%, favoring it over the PlayStation version. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; all gave the Nintendo 64 version their recommendation, citing the impressive amount of content and absence of load times, though Dan Hsu and Crispin Boyer found the graphics disappointing given the capabilities of the console. Both Boyer and Shawn Smith said the game had converted them to the Mortal Kombat fandom. &quot;GamePro&quot; likewise praised the amount of content, as well as the accurate recreation of the arcade games&#x27; graphics, the addition of the Aggressor meter, and the application of new mechanics to characters from older games in the series. They complained that the game suffers from some slowdown and muted music, but concluded it &quot;delivers with all the fighters, secrets, and carnage that made the series the phenomenon it is today.&quot; Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; contradicted &quot;GamePro&quot;, saying that the music is normal for a non-CD game and it is the sound effects (which &quot;GamePro&quot; described as &quot;arcade-perfect&quot;) that sound muffled. And while he complimented the Nintendo 64 version&#x27;s large selection of play modes, he said it is conspicuously missing frames of animation from the arcade games, and that the characters left out of this version are &quot;favorites&quot;. Peer Schneider of IGN contended that &quot;all&quot; of the audio aspects sound muffled. He said the Nintendo 64 version is a faithful conversion of the arcade games, though he compared it unfavorably to the PlayStation version. However, he held that the arcade games themselves are too aged to merit an appearance on the Nintendo 64, referring to them as five years old (in actuality, &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; was barely a year old at the time, and even the oldest in the series was four years old). &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot; was said to be a &quot;particularly horrible game&quot; among the Nintendo 64 library by &quot;Forbes&quot;, but was honored in Nintendo Power Awards &#x27;96, coming second in the category &quot;Best Tournament Fighting Game&quot;.

Reviewing the PlayStation version, &quot;GamePro&quot; criticized the overly difficult opponent AI and the unbalanced nature of the playable boss characters, and said the music tracks &quot;sound like a 45 record played at 33 RPM.&quot; They nonetheless concluded it to be &quot;a must for any fighting gamer&#x27;s library&quot;, due to the responsive controls and large amount of content. Though &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; never reviewed the PlayStation version of &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot;, they ran a four-page feature comparing it to the Nintendo 64 version. Shawn Smith picked the Nintendo 64 version as the one to buy, saying that the major bugs in the PlayStation version outweigh the Nintendo 64 version&#x27;s various shortcomings. The other three members of the review team all voted for the PlayStation version, particularly citing the additional characters and the lower price ($49.99 as compared to $69.99 for the Nintendo 64 version). They later named both versions runner-up for Fighting Game of the Year, behind &quot;Tekken 2&quot;.

The Saturn version arrived nearly a year (over a year in some countries) after the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions and received comparatively little attention. &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; said the long wait for the conversion was baffling (since the game&#x27;s 2D visuals fall within the Saturn&#x27;s specialty and no new content had been created for the Saturn version) and damaging (since superior 2D Saturn fighters had since come out and home versions of &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; were on the horizon, making &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot; both graphically and stylistically outdated). &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot;, &quot;Game Informer&quot;, and &quot;GamePro&quot; all concluded it to be a must-have for &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fans due to its comprehensive content and features, but advised non-fans to look to other fighting games on the Saturn, and described it as virtually identical to the PlayStation version. &quot;GamePro&quot; printed a warning to &quot;think twice before purchasing this version of MK Trilogy&quot; in a reader response section after they learned that Midway had deliberately omitted the animations for some fatalities in order to ship the game on time.

Released at a time when the Nintendo 64&#x27;s popularity was burgeoning and there were few competing games for the system, the Nintendo 64 version of &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot; saw impressive sales figures. According to a later IGN retrospective, &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot; &quot;offered something no fan could ignore: It brought every character from the series into the fold, along with most of the levels, making for one massive game that had enough to please everyone. Sure, some of the balance went out the window with the massive cast, but it was a small price to pay to make the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; family whole again, and it gave fans the closure they needed for Midway to move on to &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="1049214" wikidata="Q1007164" url="?curid=1049214" title="Grain whisky">
<text>Grain whisky normally refers to any whisky made, at least in part, from grains other than malted barley. Frequently used grains include maize, wheat, and rye. Grain whiskies usually contain some malted barley to provide enzymes needed for mashing and are required to include it if they are produced in Ireland or Scotland. Whisky made only from malted barley is generally called &quot;malt whisky&quot; rather than grain whisky. Most American and Canadian whiskies are grain whiskies.

==Definition==
Under the regulations governing the production of both Irish and Scotch whisky, malt whisky must be produced from a mash of 100% malted barley and must be distilled in a pot still. In Scotland, a whisky that uses other malted or unmalted cereals in the mash in addition to malted barley is termed a grain whisky. In Ireland, where regulations define &quot;pot still whiskey&quot; as one distilled from a specific mixed mash of at least 30% malted barley, at least 30% unmalted barley, and other unmalted cereals in a pot still, &quot;grain whisky&quot; refers to whisky produced from a mixed mash of no more than 30% malted barley in a column still.

In both countries, grain whisky is typically distilled in a continuous column still in a manner that results in a higher percentage of alcohol by volume (ABV) but a less flavourful spirit than that derived from a pot still. As a result, grain whisky is seldom bottled by itself in either country but is instead used primarily for blending with malt or pot still whisky to create blended whiskies, which now account for more than 90% of both countries&#x27; whisky sales. The comparative lightness of the clearer, more-neutral-flavoured grain whisky is used in blends to smooth out the often harsher characteristics of single malts and single pot still whiskeys. Occasionally well-aged grain whiskies are released as single grain whisky if made at one distillery or blended grain whisky if combining spirits from multiple distilleries.

Outside Ireland and Scotland, the use of continuous column stills and the use of a non-barley mash are not so closely associated with the production of &quot;light&quot; whisky (whisky with little flavour due to distillation at a very high ABV). For example, nearly all American whiskey is produced using column stills, and all American whiskey that is labelled as &quot;straight whiskey&quot; (including straight Bourbon and straight rye) is required to use a distillation level not exceeding 80% ABV. In the United States, whiskey produced at greater than 80% ABV is formally classified as &quot;light whiskey&quot; and cannot be labelled with the name of a grain or called malt, bourbon or straight.

<text>Technopark is a technology park in Thiruvananthapuram in the state of Kerala, India. Established on 28 July 1990 by the Government of Kerala, under chief minister E K Nayanar, However, the government was unable to commence building. The next council of ministers, led by Mr. K Karunakaran, took the initiative to begin construction and inaugurated the first building. The largest information technology (IT) park in Asia in terms of area. Technopark is the first greenest IT Park of India.

Technopark has of built-up area, and is home to over 490 companies, employing more than 75,000 professionals, and still growing. It is surrounded by beautiful Kerala foliage.

The policy of economic liberalisation initiated by the government of India in 1991, and the rapid growth of the global software industry during the 1990s, substantially contributed to this growth. During the global financial crisis of 2007–2010, the park saw a period of reduced growth in 2009–10, when exports were only 2.8% more than the previous year. During the 2016-17 financial year, the park recorded IT exports of Rs. 5,000 crores.

Technopark is owned and administered by the Government of Kerala and is headed by a chief executive officer. In addition to this, it has a governing council and a Project Implementation Board, both of which include top officials of the government. Administrative offices, including that of the CEO, are housed in the Park Centre building. Technopark also hosts a Technology Business Incubation Cell under Kerala Startup Mission.

Technopark houses domestic firms, joint ventures, and subsidiaries of foreign companies engaged in a wide variety of activities, which include embedded software development, smart card technology, enterprise resource planning (ERP), process control software design, engineering and computer-aided design software development, IT Enabled Services (ITES), process re-engineering, animation, and e-business.

==History and mission==
Then Chief Minister of Kerala, E. K. Nayanar visited the Apple facility in the United States in 1989. This led to forming of Technopark, India&#x27;s first IT park and still remains the largest in India. Nayanar laid the foundation stone on 1990 after it was registered under the Travancore Cochin Scientific and Charitable Societies Act. As of 2020, the IT park employs 70,000 people and provides indirect employment to lakhs. In March 1990, the Government of Kerala conceptualised Technopark as a facility to foster the development of high-technology industries in the state. Technopark was set up under the auspices of Electronics Technology Park, Kerala—an autonomous body under the Department of Information Technology of the government of Kerala.

Technopark&#x27;s aim was to create infrastructure to support the development of high-technology companies.
On 31 March 1991, the foundation stone for Technopark was laid by E K Nayanar, Chief Minister of Kerala, at a ceremony presided over by K R Gowri Amma, Minister for Industries. Technopark was formally dedicated to the nation by the then prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, in November, 1995.

Since then, Technopark has been growing steadily both in size and employee strength. Park Centre, Pamba, and Periyar were the only buildings constructed in the beginning, by 1995. Since then, Technopark has periodically added new buildings, such as Nila (1997), Gayathri, and Bhavani. With the inauguration of the &quot;Thejaswini&quot;, on 22 February 2007, Technopark became the largest IT Park in India. After that, Leela Group has built a facility, &quot;Leela Infopark&quot;, that hosts MNCs like Allianz, Oracle Corporation, D+H, RM Education, and Zafin.

==Socio-economic impact==
Technopark has become the single largest source of employment in Kerala, with over seventy thousand people directly working in the facility.

==Workforce==
Technopark hosts about 470 companies, and a workforce that numbers more than 70,000 personnel, in the IT and ITES sectors: companies such as Allianz–Cornhill, Ernst &amp; Young, Speridian Technologies, Infosys, Guidehouse India, Oracle Corporation, Quest Global, SunTec Business Solutions, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Tata Elxsi, Toonz Media Group, and UST Global, as well as Finastra, H&amp;R Block, IBS Software Services, Nissan Digital, RM Education, Envestnet, Tech Mahindra and RR Donnelly.

<doc id="1049220" wikidata="Q6942006" url="?curid=1049220" title="Music of Assam">
<text>The music of [[Assam]] consists various genres of folk and modern music, drawing its artistic basis from the history of Assam, from Assamese culture and its ancient traditions. In recent times, starting from the late eighties, popular artists have modernised the music catering to local popular demand.

A basic characteristic of the indigenous ethnic music of Assam is its descending scale similar to East Asian music which distinguishes it from the &quot;Mode-based&quot; or folk music &quot;(Raaga-based)&quot; forms from the rest of India.

The tunes are structured in a pyramid and are always in pentatonic scale similar to other traditional music of Asia like China, Mongolia etc and dissimilar from the seven-scaled Indian music, (in contrast to the music of rest of India which is &quot;Meend&quot; based), such as the &quot;Bihu&quot; songs, (common in South-East Asia and East Asia) besides languorous music of other forms.

The legend of &quot;Princess Usha of Sonitpur&quot; and her cohort &quot;Chitralekha&quot; also enlighten us on the musical expertise of the Assamese women. 
The connoisseurs however, have divided the classical Assamese music into two parts – &quot;Borgeet&quot; and &quot;Ojapali&quot;. The composers of &quot;Borgeet&quot;s, &quot;Sankardev&quot; and his disciple &quot;Madhavdev&quot; added versatility to Assamese music.

==Tourism==
Spread over an area of 12 hectares, Sim&#x27;s Park has a collection of over 1,000 plant species. The botanical garden is partly developed in the Japanese style and derived its name from J. D. Sim, the secretary of the Madras Club in 1874. The key attraction of the park is the annual fruit show held in May. Dolphin&#x27;s Nose Viewpoint is 10 km from Coonoor.Tourists can trek from Lady Canning&#x27;s Seat to Dolphin&#x27;s Nose. Lamb&#x27;s Rock, about 5½ km from Coonoor, is another vantage point.

==Administration and politics==
Coonoor is a taluk headquarters, responsible for six Panchayat villages, namely, Bandishola, Bearhatty, Burliar, Hubbathalai, Melur and Yedapalli. The Coonoor block contains the revenue villages of Adigaratty, Burliar, Coonoor Town, Yedapalli, Hubbathalai, Hullickal, Ketti, Melur. Coonoor assembly constituency is part of Nilgiris (Lok Sabha constituency).

==Geography==
Coonoor is located at . It has an average elevation of 1,650 metres (5413 feet) above sea level. It features a sub-tropical highland climate (Koppen;Cfb) due to high altitude.
== 2021 Indian Air Force Mil Mi-17 crash ==
On 8 December 2021, a Mil Mi-17V-5 transport helicopter operated by the Indian Air Force (IAF) crashed between Coimbatore and Wellington in Tamil Nadu, after departing from Sulur Air Force Station.

<doc id="1049227" wikidata="Q514449" url="?curid=1049227" title="Washlet">
<text>is a Japanese line of cleansing toilet seats manufactured and sold by the company Toto. The electronic bidet features a water spray element for genital and anal cleansing. and commonly appears on toilets all over Japan. The device was released in June 1980 and as of January 2022, Toto has sold more than 60 million units.

==History==
In the 1960s, Japanese plumbing company Toto&#x27;s goal was to import American &quot;wash air seats&quot; for domestic sales, mainly for sale to hospitals and nursing homes. Toto began domestic production in 1969, but wash air seats were expensive and sometimes caused scalding injuries due to poor regulation of water temperature. 

In 1980, Toto began to sell its improved Washlets in Japan after surveying employees to determine appropriate spray positions, since there were no biometric statistics available.
In the 1980s, the term &quot;Washlet&quot; originated by the company Toto. Recognized for its pioneering role in 2012, the original Washlet G model was certified as item 55 of Mechanical Engineering Heritage.

== Design ==
In 1996, Toto also released Washlets designed for Japanese-style squat toilets, but they proved difficult to use due to accuracy issues. Japanese-style toilets were replaced with their Western-style counterparts, and the model was discontinued around 2003.

In October 2005, Toto released other improvements, incorporating sleep mode for energy conservation, a remote control, and a Washlet that could play MP3 audio files. Upon her visit to Japan in 2005, pop singer Madonna commented that she had &quot;missed Japan’s warm toilet seats.&quot;

==Functions==

The cleansing features include buttons labeled Oshiri (&quot;Rear&quot;) and Bidet (&quot;Front&quot;) with translations in English speaking regions. Most current models have a sensor preventing water from spraying while a person is not sitting on the toilet.

For antibacterial and disinfectant purposes, the nozzle is designed at such an angle that the water does not splash back on the inside of the toilet (43º for anuses, 53º for vulvas), and the nozzle itself is washed with warm water when stowed away and before use. Anal and genital cleansing functions operate on different nozzles. Some models feature deodorizers and dryers for the user&#x27;s convenience.

The control panels usually features settings to change the intensity of the water spray, as well as warmth.

<doc id="1049228" wikidata="Q2303730" url="?curid=1049228" title="Place cell">
<text>A place cell is a kind of pyramidal neuron in the hippocampus that becomes active when an animal enters a particular place in its environment, which is known as the place field. Place cells are thought to act collectively as a cognitive representation of a specific location in space, known as a cognitive map. Place cells work with other types of neurons in the hippocampus and surrounding regions to perform this kind of spatial processing. They have been found in a variety of animals, including rodents, bats, monkeys and humans.

Place-cell firing patterns are often determined by stimuli in the environment such as visual landmarks, and olfactory and vestibular stimuli. Place cells have the ability to suddenly change their firing pattern from one pattern to another, a phenomenon known as remapping. This remapping may occur in either some of the place cells or in all place cells at once. It may be caused by a number of changes, such as in the odor of the environment.

Place cells are thought to play an important role in episodic memory. They contain information about the spatial context a memory took place in. And they seem to perform consolidation by exhibiting replay – the reactivation of the place cells involved in a certain experience at a much faster timescale. Place cells show alterations with age and disease, such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, which may be involved in a decrease of memory function.

The 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to John O&#x27;Keefe for the discovery of place cells, and to Edvard and May-Britt Moser for the discovery of grid cells.

==Background==

Place cells were first discovered by John O&#x27;Keefe and Jonathan Dostrovsky in 1971 in rats&#x27; hippocampuses. They noticed that rats with impairments in their hippocampus performed poorly in spatial tasks, and thus hypothesised that this area must hold some kind of spatial representation of the environment. To test this hypothesis, they developed chronic electrode implants, with which they could record the activity of individual cells extracellularly in the hippocampus. They noted that some of the cells showed activity when a rat was &quot;situated in a particular part of the testing platform facing in a particular direction&quot;. These cells would later be called place cells.

In 1976, O&#x27;Keefe performed a follow-up study, demonstrating the presence of what they called &quot;place units.&quot; These units were cells that fired in a particular place in the environment, the place field. They are described as having a low resting firing rate (&lt;1 Hz) when a rat is not in its place field, but a particularly high firing rate, which can be over 100 Hz in some cases, within the place field. Additionally, O&#x27;Keefe described six special cells, which he called &quot;misplace units&quot;, which also fire only in a particular place, but only when the rat performed an additional behaviour, such as sniffing, which was often correlated with the presence of a novel stimulus, or the absence of an expected stimulus. The findings ultimately supported the cognitive map theory, the idea that the hippocampus hold a spatial representation, a cognitive map of the environment.

There has been much debate as to whether hippocampal place cells function depends on landmarks in the environment, on environmental boundaries, or on an interaction between the two. Additionally, not all place cells rely on the same external cues. One important distinction in cues is local and distal, where local cues appear in the immediate vicinity of a subject, whereas distal cues are far away, and act more like landmarks. Individual place cells have been shown to follow either or rely on both. Additionally, the cues on which the place cells rely may depend on previous experience of the subject and the saliency of the cue.

There has also been much debate as to whether hippocampal pyramidal cells truly encode non-spatial information as well as spatial information. According to the cognitive map theory, the hippocampus&#x27;s primary role is to store spatial information through place cells and the hippocampus was biologically designed to provide a subject with spatial information. Recent findings, such as a study showing that place cells respond to non-spatial dimensions, such as sound frequency, disagree with the cognitive map theory. Instead, they support a new theory saying that the hippocampus has a more general function encoding continuous variables, and location just happens to be one of those variables. This fits in with the idea that the hippocampus has a predictive function. 
=== Relationship to grid cells ===
It has been proposed that place cells are derivatives of grid cells, pyramidal cells in the entorhinal cortex. This theory suggests that the place fields of the place cells are a combination of several grid cells, which have hexagonal grid-like patterns of activity. The theory has been supported by computational models. The relation may arise through Hebbian learning. But grid cells may perform a more supporting role in the formation of place fields, such as path integration input.
Another non-spatial explanation of hippocampal function suggests that the hippocampus performs clustering of inputs to produce representations of the current context – spatial or non-spatial.

==Properties==

===Place fields===
Place cells fire in a specific region of an environment, known as a place field. Place fields are roughly analogous to the receptive fields of sensory neurons, in that the firing region corresponds to a region of sensory information in the environment. However, unlike receptive fields, place cells show no topography, meaning that two neighboring cells do not necessarily have neighboring place fields. Place cells fire spikes in bursts at a high frequency inside the place field, but outside of the place field they remain relatively inactive. Place fields are allocentric, meaning that they are defined with respect to the outside world rather than the body. By orienting based on the environment rather than the individual, place fields can work effectively as neural maps of the environment. A typical place cell will have only one or a few place fields in a small laboratory environment. However, in larger environments, place cells have been shown to contain multiple place fields which are usually irregular. Place cells may also show directionality, meaning they will only fire in a certain location when travelling in a particular direction.
=== Remapping ===
Remapping refers to the change in the place field characteristics that occurs when a subject experiences a new environment, or the same environment in a new context. This phenomenon was first reported in 1987, and is thought to play a role in the memory function of the hippocampus. There are broadly two types of remapping: &quot;global&quot; remapping and &quot;partial&quot; remapping. When global remapping occurs, most or all of the place cells remap, meaning they lose or gain a place field, or their place field changes its location. Partial remapping means that most place fields are unchanged and only a small portion of the place cells remap. Some of the changes to the environment that have been shown to induce remapping include changing the shape or size of the environment, the color of the walls, the smell in the environment, or the relevance of a location to the task at hand.

=== Phase precession ===

The firing of place cells is timed in relation to local theta waves, a process termed phase precession. Upon entering a place field, place cells will fire in bursts at a particular point in the phase of the underlying theta waves. However, as an animal progresses through the place field, the firing will happen progressively earlier in the phase. It is thought that this phenomenon increases the accuracy of the place coding, and aids in plasticity, which is required for learning.

=== Directionality ===
In some cases place cells show directionality, meaning they will only fire in a location when the subject is travelling in a particular direction. However, they may also be omnidirectional, meaning they fire regardless of the direction the subject. The lack of directionality in some place cells might occur particularly in impoverished environments, whereas in more complicated environments directionality is enhanced. The radial arm maze is one such environment where directionality does occur. In this environment, cells may even have multiple place fields, of which one is strongly directional, while the others are not. In virtual reality corridors, the degree of directionality in the population of place cells is particularly high. The directionality of place cells has been shown to emerge as a result of the animal&#x27;s behaviour. For example, the receptive fields become skewed when rats travel a linear track in a single direction. Recent theoretical studies suggest that place cells encode a successor representation which maps the current state to the predicted successor states, and that directionality emerges from this formalism. This computational framework also provides an account for the distortion of place fields around obstacles.

===Sensory input===
Place cells were initially believed to fire in direct relation to simple sensory inputs, but studies have suggested that this may not be the case. Place fields are usually unaffected by large sensory changes, like removing a landmark from an environment, but respond to subtle changes, like a change in color or shape of an object. This suggests that place cells respond to complex stimuli rather than simple individual sensory cues. According to the functional differentation model, sensory information is processed in various cortical structures upstream of the hippocampus before actually reaching the structure, so that the information received by place cells is a compilation, a functional derivative, of different stimuli.

Sensory information received by place cells can be categorized as either metric or contextual information, where metric information corresponds to where place cells should fire and contextual input corresponds to whether or not a place field should fire in a certain environment. Metric sensory information is any kind of spatial input that might indicate a distance between two points. For example, the edges of an environment might signal the size of the overall place field or the distance between two points within a place field. Metric signals can be either linear or directional. Directional inputs provide information about the orientation of a place field, whereas linear inputs essentially form a representational grid. Contextual cues allow established place fields to adapt to minor changes in the environment, such as a change in object color or shape. Metric and contextual inputs are processed together in the entorhinal cortex before reaching the hippocampal place cells. Visuospatial and olfactory inputs are examples of sensory inputs that are utilized by place cells. These types of sensory cues can include both metric and contextual information.

====Visuospatial inputs====
Spatial cues such as geometric boundaries or orienting landmarks are important examples of &quot;metric&quot; input. An example is the walls of an environment, which provides information about relative distance and location. Place cells generally rely on set distal cues rather than cues in the immediate proximal environment, though local cues can have a profound impact on local place fields. Visual sensory inputs can also supply important &quot;contextual&quot; information. A change in color of a specific object or the walls of the environment can affect whether or not a place cell fires in a particular field. Thus, visuospatial sensory information is critical to the formation and recollection of place field.

====Olfactory inputs====
Although place cells primarily rely on visuospatial input, some studies suggest that olfactory input may also affect the formation and stability of place fields. Olfaction may compensate for a loss of visual information, or even be responsible for the formation of stable place fields in the same way visuospatial cues are. This has been confirmed by a study in a virtual environment that was composed of odor gradients. Change in the olfactory stimulus in an environment may also cause the remapping of place cells.

==== Vestibular inputs ====
Stimuli from the vestibular system, such as rotations, can cause changes in place cells firing. After receiving vestibular input some place cells may remap to align with this input, though not all cells will remap and are more reliant on visual cues. Bilateral lesions of the vestibular system in patients may cause abnormal firing of hippocampal place cells as evidenced, in part, by difficulties with spatial tasks such as the radial arm maze and the Morris water navigation task.

==== Movement inputs ====
Movement can also be an important spatial cue. Mice use their self-motion information to determine how far and in which direction they have travelled, a process called path integration. This is especially the case in the absence of continuous sensory inputs. For example, in an environment with a lack of visuospatial inputs, an animal might search for the environment edge using touch, and discern location based on the distance of its movement from that edge. Path integration is largely aided by grid cells, which are a type of neuron in the entorhinal cortex that relay information to place cells in the hippocampus. Grid cells establish a grid representation of a location, so that during movement place cells can fire according to their new location while orienting according to the reference grid of their external environment.

==Episodic memory==
Place cells play an important role in episodic memory. One important aspect of episodic memory is the spatial context in which the event occurred. Hippocampal place cells have stable firing patterns even when cues from a location are removed and specific place fields begin firing when exposed to signals or a subset of signals from a previous location. This suggests that place cells provide the spatial context for a memory by recalling the neural representation of the environment in which the memory occurred. By establishing spatial context, place cells play a role in completing memory patterns. Furthermore, place cells are able to maintain a spatial representation of one location while recalling the neural map of a separate location, effectively differentiating between present experience and past memory. Place cells are therefore considered to demonstrate both pattern completion and pattern separation qualities.

===Pattern completion===
Pattern completion is the ability to recall an entire memory from a partial or degraded sensory cue. Place cells are able to maintain a stable firing field even after significant signals are removed from a location, suggesting that they can recall a pattern based on only part of the original input. Furthermore, the pattern completion exhibited by place cells is symmetric, because an entire memory can be retrieved from any part of it. For example, in an object-place association memory, spatial context can be used to recall an object and the object can be used to recall the spatial context.

===Pattern separation===

Pattern separation is the ability to differentiate one memory from other stored memories. Pattern separation begins in the dentate gyrus, a section of the hippocampus involved in memory formation and retrieval. Granule cells in the dentate gyrus process sensory information using competitive learning, and relay a preliminary representation to form place fields. Place fields are extremely specific, as they are capable of remapping and adjusting firing rates in response to subtle sensory signal changes. This specificity is critical for pattern separation, as it distinguishes memories from one another.

===Reactivation, replay, and preplay===

Place cells often exhibit reactivation outside their place fields. This reactivation has a much faster time scale than the actual experience, and it occurs mostly in the same order in which it was originally experienced, or, more rarely, in reverse. Replay is believed to have a functional role in memory retrieval and memory consolidation. However, when replay is disturbed, it does not necessarily affect place coding, which means it is not essentially for consolidation in all circumstances. The same sequence of activity may occur before the actual experience. This phenomenon, termed preplay, may have a role in prediction and learning.

== Model animals ==
Place cells were first discovered in rats, but place cells and place-like cells have since been found in a number of different animals, including rodents, bats and primates. Additionally, evidence for place cells in humans was found in 2003.
=== Rodents ===
Both rats and mice are often used as model animals for place cells research. Rats became especially popular after the development of multiarray electrodes, which allows for the simultaneous recording of a large number of cells. However, mice have the advantage that a larger range of genetic variants are available. Additionally mice can be headfixed, allowing for the use of microscopy techniques to look directly into the brain. Though rats and mice have similar place cells dynamics, mice have smaller place cells, and on the same size track have an increase in number of place fields per cell. Additionally, their replay is weaker compared to the replay in rats.

In addition to rats and mice, place cells have also been found in chinchillas.

Rats furthermore have social place cells, cells which encode the position of other rats. This finding was published in Science at the same time as the report of social place cells in bats.

=== Bats ===
Place cells were reported in Egyptian fruit bats for the first time in 2007 by Nachum Ulanovsky and his lab. The place cells in bats have a place field in 3D, which is probably due to the bat flying in three dimensions. The place cells in bats can be based on either vision or echolocation, which remapping taking place when bats switch between the two. Bats also have social place cells; this finding was published in Science at the same time as the report of social place cells in rats.

=== Primates ===
Place-related responses have been found in cells of the Japanese macaque and common marmoset, however, whether these are true place cells or spatial view cells is still debated. Spatial view cells respond to locations that are visually explored by eye movement, or the &quot;view of a space&quot;, rather than the location of the monkey&#x27;s body. In the macaque, cells were recorded while the monkey was driving a motorised cab around the experimental room. Additionally, place-related responses have been found macaques while they navigated in a virtual reality. More recently, place cells may have been identified in the hippocampus of freely moving macaques and marmosets.

==Disturbances to place cell function==

===Effects of alcohol===
Place cell firing rate decreases dramatically after ethanol exposure, causing reduced spatial sensitivity, which has been hypothesised to be the cause of impairments in spatial procession after alcohol exposure.

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===
Problems with spatial memory and navigation are thought to be one of the early indications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Place cells have been shown to degenerate in Alzheimer&#x27;s mouse models, which causes such problems with spatial memory in these mice. Furthermore, the place cells in these models have unstable representations of space, and cannot learn stable representations for new environments as well as place cells in healthy mice. The hippocampal theta waves, as well as the gamma waves, that influence place cell firing, for example through phase precession, are also affected.

===Aging===
Place field properties, including the rate of firing and spike characteristics such as width and amplitude of the spikes, are largely similar between young and aged rats in the CA1 hippocampal region. However, while the size of place fields in the hippocampal CA3 region remains the same between young and aged rats, average firing rate in this region is higher in aged rats. Young rats exhibit place field plasticity: when they are moving along a straight path, place fields are activated one after another. When young rats repeatedly traverse the same straight path, connection between place fields are strengthened due to plasticity, causing subsequent place fields to fire more quickly and causing place field expansion, possibly aiding young rats in spatial memory and learning. However, this observed place field expansion and plasticity is decreased in aged rat subjects, possibly reducing their capacity for spatial learning and memory.

This plasticity can be rescued in aged rats by giving them memantine, an antagonist that blocks the NMDA receptors which is known to improve spatial memory, and was therefore used in an attempt to restore place field plasticity in aged subjects. NMDA receptors, which are glutamate receptors, exhibit decreased activity in aged subjects. The application of memantine leads to in increase in place field plasticity in aged rat subjects. Although memantine aids in the encoding process of spatial information in aged rat subjects, it does not help with the retrieval of this information later in time.

Aged rats further show a high instability in their place cells in the CA1 region. When introduced to the same environment several times, the hippocampal map of the environment changed about 30% of the time, suggesting that the place cells are remapping in response to the exact same environment. Contrarily, the CA3 place cells are show increased plasticity in aged subjects. The same place fields in the CA3 region to activate in similar environments, whereas different place fields in young rats would fire in similar environments because they would pick up on subtle differences in these environments. One possible cause of these changes in plasticity may be increased reliance on self-motion cues.

<doc id="1049236" wikidata="Q904906" url="?curid=1049236" title="Closed bolt">
<text>A semi or full-automatic firearm which is said to fire from a closed bolt or closed breech is one where, when ready to fire, a round is in the chamber and the bolt and working parts are forward &quot;in battery&quot;. When the trigger is pulled, the firing pin or striker fires the round; the action is cycled by the energy of the shot, sending the bolt to the rear, which extracts and ejects the empty cartridge case; and the bolt goes forward, feeding a fresh round from the magazine into the chamber, ready for the next shot.

== World War I aircraft ==
When World War I era machine guns were being tried for use on aircraft, the Lewis gun was found not to be usable with a gun synchronizer for forward firing through the propeller, due to its firing cycle starting with an open bolt. Maxim style arms fired with a cycle starting with a closed bolt, and since the bullet firing from the gun started the firing cycle, it was much easier to set the synchronizer to trigger the gun only when the propeller&#x27;s blade was not directly in front of the gun&#x27;s muzzle. These included: 

* Vickers machine gun 
* Both the rectangular-receiver lMG 08 and lightened-receiver LMG 08/15 Spandau gun, and Parabellum LMG 14 gun
* Improvements introduced by Swedish armaments designer Carl Gustave Swebilius to the American M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun for aircraft use, creating the M1917 and M1918 Marlin-Rockwell machine guns for the USAAS

==Comparison with open bolt design==

A closed bolt design has both advantages and disadvantages when compared to an open bolt design:

===Advantages===
*More accurate for the first round and for semi-automatic fire:
**No movement of heavy working parts prior to firing to potentially inhibit accuracy.
**Round sits consistently in the chamber.
**Potentially shorter delay between operator pulling the trigger and round being fired (also known as lock time).
*Cleaner operation – less potential for dust and other foreign debris to enter the gun, since the action remains closed unless the weapon is firing.
*Action can be locked forward to further reduce noise in a suppressed weapon.
*Can carry an additional round in the chamber, increasing ammunition capacity by one round beyond the magazine&#x27;s maximum limit.

===Disadvantages===
*More complicated and expensive to manufacture.
*Less heat dissipation from closed chamber (increased danger of cooking off)
*The extra round in the chamber can be a safety hazard, as even when the magazine is removed, the round in the chamber will still be ready to fire, and must be manually ejected.

===Uses===
Closed-bolt designs are often used in rifles. The improved accuracy of closed-bolt weapons is more desirable, while the poorer heat dissipation is less of an issue for slower-firing weapons. In contrast, open-bolt designs are more often used in automatic weapons, such as machine guns. For fast-firing automatic weapons, heat will rapidly build up from sustained firing, but accuracy is of less importance. Thus, the improved heat dissipation of open-bolt designs is generally more desirable in automatic weapons.

<text>Johnny Albino (December 9, 1919 – May 7, 2011) was a Puerto Rican bolero singer, born in Yauco, Puerto Rico but lived most of his life in Guayama, Puerto Rico.

He played and sang through his youth years. It was not until years later, however, that he would get a chance to sing as part of an organized act. Albino joined the United States Army during World War II, where he formed a quartet and was allowed to sing for his fellow soldiers.

In 1946, Albino performed in a trio for the first time. Later on, he would become a member and lead voice of the Trio San Juan, which went on to become an internationally acclaimed group.

Trio San Juan was rivaled at the time by the Trio Los Panchos for popularity. Albino later on left Trio San Juan and joined Los Panchos, as the leading voice, replacing another legendary trio singer, Julito Rodríguez.

Albino joined Los Panchos in 1958 and he remained there until 1968. The group became famous across the world, and Albino toured the United States, Europe and Japan. With Los Panchos, he recorded Japanese albums, and he also performed alongside well known performers such as Johnny Carson, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. Steve Lawrence and others.

Albino left Los Panchos and went on to form, or become a member of many famous Puerto Rican trios. Notably, Miguel Poventud whose participation in the album &quot;Los Panchos by Special Request&quot; are a compilation of love songs recorded in English for CBS. Also, &quot;Grandes Exitos de Johnny Albino con Los Panchos&quot; DHIT 2093.2 21 June 2005 is his main performance with Miguel Poventud on &quot;requinto&quot; (guitar) and voice accompaniment.

His career spanned over 300 albums and CDs. At 93, he died on May 7, 2011, in Long Island, New York.

<text>Kilburn is a village in the civil parish of Kilburn High and Low, in the former Hambleton District in the county of North Yorkshire, England. It lies on the edge of the North York Moors National Park, and north of Easingwold.

==History==

The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Chileburne&quot; in the Yalestre hundred. At the time of the Norman invasion, the lord of the manor was Arnketil, but was subsequently granted to Hugh, son of Baldric. During the reign of Henry I the manor was passed to Rouen Cathedral in Normandy and subsequently to Roger de Mowbray who passed the lands to the Colvilles. In return for receiving these lands, Thomas de Colville had to swear allegiance to Roger de Mowbray. The Colvilles held the manor until 1405 when the eighth Thomas Colville was murdered outside York and died without male heirs. The lands were held by the Archbishop of York after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century.

Kilburn was historically a township and parish in the wapentake of Birdforth in the North Riding of Yorkshire. After 1837 it was part of the Thirsk and Helmsley Poor Law Unions. The parish, which covered acres, comprised Kilburn, Oldstead, Thorpe-le-Willows, and Wass, of which Kilburn had the largest population. The etymology of the name comes from two Old English words, &quot;ciele &amp; burna&quot;, meaning &quot;cool stream&quot;.

Robert de Alneto, a monk from Whitby Abbey, lived in a hermitage at Hood Grange, from the village. In 1138 Robert de Mowbray converted it into a Cistercian abbey, which later moved to Old Byland and subsequently moved again to Byland.

==Governance==

The village lies within the Thirsk and Malton UK Parliament constituency. It also lies within the Stillington, North Yorkshire electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council and the White Horse ward of Hambleton District Council. The local Parish Council has five members.

==Geography==

The village consists of High Kilburn, situated on a hillside, and Low Kilburn in the valley on the banks of a stream. It lies about east from Thirsk. The nearest settlements are Wass to the east; Coxwold to the south-east; Carlton Husthwaite to the south-west and Thirkleby to the west. There was a sandstone-quarry at Hood Hill.

The 1881 UK Census recorded the population as 387. The 2001 UK Census recorded the population as 180, of which 162 were over sixteen years old and 84 of those were in employment. There were 105 dwellings of which 73 were detached. There are a total of 18 Grade II listed buildings in the area.
The village is known for the White Horse. The White Horse is a figure cut into the hillside to the north of the village, and visible for many miles around on a clear day.

==Religion==

St Mary&#x27;s Church, Kilburn is a Grade II* listed building which was erected in the early 12th century and underwent restoration in 1869.

A Wesleyan chapel was built in the village in 1838.
==Notable people==

* Robert Thompson, whose trade-name was &quot;the Mouseman&quot;, lived in the village. He manufactured furniture in English oak mainly for church use. His work is distinguished by a carving of a mouse somewhere on the piece. Examples can be seen on the wooden candlesticks in Westminster Abbey. These pieces were commissioned directly by the widow of the captain of HMS &quot;Barham&quot; as a memorial to the lost ship and her crew. The Mouseman Visitor Centre lies in the village.

<text>In mathematics, an Apollonian gasket or Apollonian net is a fractal generated by starting with a triple of circles, each tangent to the other two, and successively filling in more circles, each tangent to another three. It is named after Greek mathematician Apollonius of Perga.

==Construction==

The construction of the Apollonian gasket starts with three circles formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 (black in the figure), that are each tangent to the other two, but that do not have a single point of triple tangency. These circles may be of different sizes to each other, and it is allowed for two to be inside the third, or for all three to be outside each other. As Apollonius discovered, there exist two more circles formula_4 and formula_5 (red) that are tangent to all three of the original circles – these are called &quot;Apollonian circles&quot;. These five circles are separated from each other by six curved triangular regions, each bounded by the arcs from three pairwise-tangent circles. The construction continues by adding six more circles, one in each of these six curved triangles, tangent to its three sides. These in turn create 18 more curved triangles, and the construction continues by again filling these with tangent circles, ad infinitum.

Continued stage by stage in this way, the construction adds formula_6 new circles at stage formula_7, giving a total of formula_8 circles after formula_7 stages. In the limit, this set of circles is an Apollonian gasket. In it, each pair of tangent circles has an infinite Pappus chain of circles tangent to both circles in the pair.
The size of each new circle is determined by Descartes&#x27; theorem, which states that, for any four mutually tangent circles, the radii formula_10 of the circles obeys the equation
formula_11
This equation may have a solution with a negative radius; this means that one of the circles (the one with negative radius) surrounds the other three.
One or two of the initial circles of this construction, or the circles resulting from this construction, can degenerate to a straight line, which can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius. When there are two lines, they must be parallel, and are considered to be tangent at a point at infinity. When the gasket includes two lines on the formula_12-axis and one unit above it, and a circle of unit diameter tangent to both lines centered on the formula_13-axis, then the circles that are tangent to the formula_12-axis are the Ford circles, important in number theory.

The Apollonian gasket has a Hausdorff dimension of about 1.3057. Because it has a well-defined fractional dimension, even though it is not precisely self-similar, it can be thought of as a fractal.

==Symmetries==
The Möbius transformations of the plane preserve the shapes and tangencies of circles, and therefore preserve the structure of an Apollonian gasket.
Any two triples of mutually tangent circles in an Apollonian gasket may be mapped into each other by a Möbius transformation, and any two Apollonian gaskets may be mapped into each other by a Möbius transformation. In particular, for any two tangent circles in any Apollonian gasket, an inversion in a circle centered at the point of tangency (a special case of a Möbius transformation) will transform these two circles into two parallel lines, and transform the rest of the gasket into the special form of a gasket between two parallel lines. Compositions of these inversions can be used to transform any two points of tangency into each other. Möbius transformations are also isometries of the hyperbolic plane, so in hyperbolic geometry all Apollonian gaskets are congruent. In a sense, there is therefore only one Apollonian gasket, up to (hyperbolic) isometry.

The Apollonian gasket is the limit set of a group of Möbius transformations known as a Kleinian group.

For Euclidean symmetry transformations rather than Möbius transformations, in general, the Apollonian gasket will inherit the symmetries of its generating set of three circles. However, some triples of circles can generate Apollonian gaskets with higher symmetry than the initial triple; this happens when the same gasket has a different and more-symmetric set of generating circles. Particularly symmetric cases include the Apollonian gasket between two parallel lines (with infinite dihedral symmetry), the Apollonian gasket generated by three congruent circles in an equilateral triangle (with the symmetry of the triangle), and the Apollonian gasket generated by two circles of radius 1 surrounded by a circle of radius 2 (with two lines of reflective symmetry).

==Integral Apollonian circle packings==

If any four mutually tangent circles in an Apollonian gasket all have integer curvature (the inverse of their radius) then all circles in the gasket will have integer curvature.
Since the equation relating curvatures in an Apollonian gasket, integral or not, is
formula_15
it follows that one may move from one quadruple of curvatures to another by Vieta jumping, just as when finding a new Markov number.
The first few of these integral Apollonian gaskets are listed in the following table. The table lists the curvatures of the largest circles in the gasket. Only the first three curvatures (of the five displayed in the table) are needed to completely describe each gasket – all other curvatures can be derived from these three.


===Enumerating integral Apollonian circle packings===
The curvatures formula_16 are a root quadruple (the smallest in some integral circle packing) if formula_17. They are primitive when formula_18. Defining a new set of variables formula_19 by the matrix equation
formula_20
gives a system where formula_16 satisfies the Descartes equation precisely when formula_22. Furthermore, formula_16 is primitive precisely when formula_24, and formula_16 is a root quadruple precisely when formula_26.

This relationship can be used to find all the primitive root quadruples with a given negative bend formula_12. It follows from formula_28 and formula_29 that formula_30, and hence that formula_31. Therefore, any root quadruple will satisfy formula_32. By iterating over all the possible values of formula_33, formula_34, and formula_35 one can find all the primitive root quadruples. The following Python code demonstrates this algorithm, producing the primitive root quadruples listed above.
import math

def get_primitive_bends(n: int) -&gt; tuple[int, int, int, int]:
 if n == 0:
 yield 0, 0, 1, 1
 return
 for m in range(math.ceil(n / math.sqrt(3))):
 s = m**2 + n**2
 for d1 in range(max(2 * m, 1), math.floor(math.sqrt(s)) + 1):
 d2, remainder = divmod(s, d1)
 if remainder == 0 and math.gcd(n, d1, d2) == 1:
 yield -n, d1 + n, d2 + n, d1 + d2 + n - 2 * m

for n in range(15):
 for bends in get_primitive_bends(n):
 print(bends)
The curvatures appearing in a primitive integral Apollonian circle packing must belong to a set of six or eight possible residues classes modulo 24, and numerical evidence supported that any sufficiently large integer from these residue classes would also be present as a curvature within the packing. This conjecture, known as the local-global conjecture, was proved to be false in 2023.

===Symmetry of integral Apollonian circle packings===
There are multiple types of dihedral symmetry that can occur with a gasket depending on the curvature of the circles.

====No symmetry====
If none of the curvatures are repeated within the first five, the gasket contains no symmetry, which is represented by symmetry group &quot;C&quot;1; the gasket described by curvatures (−10, 18, 23, 27) is an example.

====&quot;D&quot;1 symmetry====
Whenever two of the largest five circles in the gasket have the same curvature, that gasket will have &quot;D&quot;1 symmetry, which corresponds to a reflection along a diameter of the bounding circle, with no rotational symmetry.

====&quot;D&quot;2 symmetry====
If two different curvatures are repeated within the first five, the gasket will have D2 symmetry; such a symmetry consists of two reflections (perpendicular to each other) along diameters of the bounding circle, with a two-fold rotational symmetry of 180°. The gasket described by curvatures (−1, 2, 2, 3) is the only Apollonian gasket (up to a scaling factor) to possess D2 symmetry.

====&quot;D&quot;3 symmetry====
There are no integer gaskets with &quot;D&quot;3 symmetry.

If the three circles with smallest positive curvature have the same curvature, the gasket will have &quot;D&quot;3 symmetry, which corresponds to three reflections along diameters of the bounding circle (spaced 120° apart), along with three-fold rotational symmetry of 120°. In this case the ratio of the curvature of the bounding circle to the three inner circles is 2 − 3. As this ratio is not rational, no integral Apollonian circle packings possess this &quot;D&quot;3 symmetry, although many packings come close.

====Almost-&quot;D&quot;3 symmetry====
The figure at left is an integral Apollonian gasket that appears to have &quot;D&quot;3 symmetry. The same figure is displayed at right, with labels indicating the curvatures of the interior circles, illustrating that the gasket actually possesses only the &quot;D&quot;1 symmetry common to many other integral Apollonian gaskets.

The following table lists more of these &quot;almost&quot;-&quot;D&quot;3 integral Apollonian gaskets. The sequence has some interesting properties, and the table lists a factorization of the curvatures, along with the multiplier needed to go from the previous set to the current one. The absolute values of the curvatures of the &quot;a&quot; disks obey the recurrence relation , from which it follows that the multiplier converges to  + 2 ≈ 3.732050807.

===Sequential curvatures===

For any integer &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0, there exists an Apollonian gasket defined by the following curvatures: (−&quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot; + 1, &quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot; + 1), &quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot; + 1) + 1). For example, the gaskets defined by (−2, 3, 6, 7), (−3, 4, 12, 13), (−8, 9, 72, 73), and (−9, 10, 90, 91) all follow this pattern. Because every interior circle that is defined by &quot;n&quot; + 1 can become the bounding circle (defined by −&quot;n&quot;) in another gasket, these gaskets can be nested. This is demonstrated in the figure at right, which contains these sequential gaskets with &quot;n&quot; running from 2 through 20.

==History==
Although the Apollonian gasket is named for Apollonius of Perga -- because of its construction&#x27;s dependence on the solution to the problem of Apollonius -- the earliest description of the gasket is from 1706 by Leibniz in a letter to Des Bosses.
The first modern definition of the Apollonian gasket is given by Kasner and Supnick.

<doc id="1049273" wikidata="Q843486" url="?curid=1049273" title="Mortal Kombat II">
<text>Mortal Kombat II is a 1993 fighting game originally produced by Midway for arcades. It was ported to multiple home systems, including MS-DOS, Amiga, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Genesis, 32X, Sega Saturn, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and PlayStation only in Japan, mostly in licensed versions developed by Probe Software (later renamed to Probe Entertainment for some ports of the game) and Sculptured Software and published by Acclaim Entertainment (currently distributed by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment).

It is the second main installment in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; franchise and a sequel to 1992&#x27;s &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, improving the gameplay and expanding the mythos of the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, introducing more varied finishing moves (including several Fatalities per character and new finishers, such as Babality and Friendship) and several iconic characters, such as Kitana, Mileena, Kung Lao, the hidden character Noob Saibot, and the series&#x27; recurring villain, Shao Kahn. The game&#x27;s plot continues from the first game, featuring the next Mortal Kombat tournament set in the otherdimensional realm of Outworld, with the Outworld and Earthrealm representatives fighting each other on their way to challenge the evil emperor Shao Kahn.

The game was an unprecedented commercial success and was acclaimed by most critics, receiving many annual awards and being featured in various top lists in the years and decades to come, and also caused a major video game controversy due to the series&#x27; continuous depiction of graphic violence. It spawned a spin-off game, &quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks&quot;, had the greatest influence on the 2011 soft reboot game &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, and inspired numerous video game clones. &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; is often cited as one of the greatest video games ever made.

A sequel, &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, was released in 1995.

==Gameplay==

The gameplay system of &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; is an improved version of that from the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. There are several changes in standard moves: a crouching punch was added, low and high kicks have greater differentiation (be they crouching or standing up), roundhouse kicks are made more powerful (knocking an opponent across the screen, like the game&#x27;s uppercut), and it is easier to perform combos due to reduced recovery times for attacks. Returning characters also gained new special moves, including some to be used in mid-air, and the game plays almost twice as fast as the original.

As with its predecessor, matches are divided into rounds, and the first player to win two rounds by fully depleting their opponent&#x27;s life bar is the winner; at this point, the losing character will become dazed and the winner is given the opportunity of using a finishing move. &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; lacks the &quot;Test Your Might&quot; bonus games and point system from the first game, in favor of a consecutive win tally where wins are represented by icons.

The game marked the introduction of multiple Fatalities (special moves allowing the victorious character to execute their opponent at the end of a match) as well as additional, non-lethal finishing moves to the franchise: Babalities (turning the opponent into a crying baby), Friendships (a non-malicious interaction, such as dancing or giving a gift to the defeated opponent) and additional stage-specific Fatalities (the victor uppercutting their opponent into an abyss below, spikes in the ceiling, or a pool of acid in the background). Finishing moves cannot be performed either by or against the boss or secret characters. 

==Plot==
Following his failure to defeat Liu Kang in the previous Mortal Kombat tournament, the evil Shang Tsung begs his master Shao Kahn, supreme ruler of Outworld and the surrounding kingdoms, to spare his life. He tells Shao Kahn that if they hold the next Mortal Kombat Tournament in Outworld, the Earthrealm warriors must travel away from home to attend. Kahn agrees to this plan, and restores Shang Tsung&#x27;s youth and martial arts prowess. He then extends the invitation to the thunder god and Earthrealm&#x27;s protector, Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld. The new tournament is much more dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage.

According to the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series&#x27; canon, Liu Kang won this tournament as well, defeating Shao Kahn and his bodyguard Kintaro. The game&#x27;s story mode can be also finished using any other playable character, resulting in a variety of non-canonical endings for each of them. This game also establishes that the original Sub-Zero Bi-Han was killed by Scorpion in the first game and Bi-Han&#x27;s younger brother Kuai Liang took the identity of the new Sub-Zero.

==Characters==
The game includes 12 playable characters.

;New characters: 
*Baraka (played by Richard Divizio), a mutant warlord of Outworld&#x27;s Nomad race, responsible for the assault on the Shaolin Monastery on the orders of Shao Kahn.
*Jax (played by John Parrish): U.S. Special Forces officer who enters the tournament to rescue his partner Sonya Blade from Outworld.
*Kitana (played by Katalin Zamiar), a female ninja who works as a personal assassin in the service of Shao Kahn. She has been suspected of secretly aiding the Earthrealm warriors.
*Kung Lao (played by Anthony Marquez), Shaolin monk and close friend of Liu Kang, a descendant of the Great Kung Lao (who was defeated by Goro and Shang Tsung 500 years before the events of &quot;MK&quot;). He seeks to avenge his ancestor and the destruction of the Shaolin temple.
*Mileena (played by Katalin Zamiar), twin sister to Kitana who also serves as an assassin for Kahn. Her mission during the tournament is to ensure the loyalty of her sister, but she also has plans of her own.

;Returning characters:
*Johnny Cage (played by Daniel Pesina), Hollywood actor who joins Liu Kang in his journey to Outworld.
*Liu Kang (played by Ho Sung Pak), Shaolin monk who is the reigning champion of Mortal Kombat. He travels to Outworld to seek vengeance for the death of his Shaolin monastery brothers.
*Raiden (played by Carlos Pesina), thunder god who returns to Mortal Kombat to stop Kahn&#x27;s evil plans of taking Earthrealm for his own (spelled &quot;Rayden&quot; in the DOS and console ports).
*Reptile (played by Daniel Pesina), Shang Tsung&#x27;s personal bodyguard.
*Scorpion (played by Daniel Pesina), a hellspawned spectre who returns to the tournament to once again assassinate Sub-Zero.
*Shang Tsung (played by Philip Ahn, M.D.) An evil sorcerer who convinced Kahn to spare his life after losing the last tournament, with a new plan to appease his master, who in turn restores Tsung&#x27;s youth. Although playable in this installment, also serves as a sub-boss of the game, always appearing before Kintaro in the single-player mode. As in the first game, he is able to morph into any of the playable characters, retaining their moves (in some versions only the character against whom he is currently fighting).
*Sub-Zero (played by Daniel Pesina), a male ninja who possesses cryokinesis. Though apparently killed in the first tournament, he mysteriously returns, traveling into Outworld to again attempt to assassinate Shang Tsung.

;Boss characters:
*Kintaro (stop motion), Shao Kahn&#x27;s bodyguard, sent by his race to avenge Goro&#x27;s defeat. He is the game&#x27;s penultimate boss.
*Shao Kahn (played by Brian Glynn, voiced by Steve Ritchie), the evil Emperor of Outworld, who wishes to conquer Earthrealm by any means. He is the tournament host and the game&#x27;s final boss.

The game also features three hidden opponents for unlockable fights: Jade (played by Katalin Zamiar), a female ninja clad in green who is immune to projectiles; Noob Saibot (played by Daniel Pesina), a dark silhouetted ninja who is a &quot;lost warrior&quot; from the first &quot;MK&quot; game; and Smoke (played by Daniel Pesina), a male ninja clothed in gray who emits smoke from his body.

Sonya and Kano are the only playable characters from the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; who were not implemented as fighters, as they only appear in the background of the Kahn&#x27;s Arena stage, chained and on display as his prisoners. The reason for this was due to the storage limitations of arcade hardware at the time. When Midway employees ran audits on several Mortal Kombat arcade cabinets in the Chicago area, they found that Kano and Sonya were the least chosen characters. So they were cut to background sprites in order to make room for new characters.

==Development==

===Game===
According to the project&#x27;s lead programmer Ed Boon, &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; was &quot;intended to look different than the original &quot;MK&quot;&quot; and &quot;had everything we wanted to put into &quot;MK&quot; but did not have time for.&quot; In 2012, Boon placed creating the game among his best &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; memories, recalling: &quot;When we did &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, we got new equipment and all that stuff, but it was funny because when we started working on &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, the mania, the hysteria of the home versions of &quot;Mortal Kombat I&quot; was literally all around us. We were so busy working on the next one, going from seven characters to 12 and two Fatalities per character and all these other things that that consumed every second.&quot; Both the theme and art style of &quot;MKII&quot; were slightly darker than those of its predecessor, although a more vibrant color palette was employed and the new game had a much richer color depth than the previous game. A new feature was the use of multiple layers of parallax scrolling in the arcade version. The game was made to be less serious with the addition of humorous alternative finishing moves. Some of the considered Fatalities were rejected as too extreme at the time.

Care was taken during the programming process to give the game a &quot;good feel&quot;, with Boon simulating elements such as gravity into the video game design. The game&#x27;s lead designer and artist John Tobias noted that the previous game&#x27;s reliance on juggling the opponent in the air with successive hits was an accident, and had been tightened in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;. Boon said that the reason to not completely remove it in favor of a different system of chaining attacks together was to set the game apart from the competing titles such as &quot;Street Fighter&quot; and allow for players to devise their own combinations of attacks. A double jump ability was implemented but later removed. At one point, a bonus stage was planned to feature &quot;a bunch of ninjas jumping all over the place and you would swing at them, just like you&#x27;re in the middle of a fight in a kung fu movie.&quot; All of the music was composed, performed, recorded and mixed by Dan Forden, the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series&#x27; sound designer and composer, using the Williams DCS sound system.

Like the first game, Acclaim handled the home conversions. &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; claimed in 1994 that Acclaim had spent on developing, manufacturing and marketing the game.

===Characters===
To create the character animations for the game, actors were placed in front of a gray background and performed the motions, which were recorded on videotape (using a broadcast-quality, $20,000 Sony camera instead of the standard Hi8 camera used for the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;). The video capture footage was then processed into a computer, and the background was removed from selected frames to create sprites. Towards the end of the game&#x27;s development, they opted to instead use a blue screen technique and processed the footage directly into the computer for a similar, simpler process. The actors were lightly sprayed with water to give them a sweaty, glistening appearance, while post-editing was done on the sprites afterward to highlight flesh tones and improve the visibility of muscles, which Tobias felt set the series apart from similar games using digitized graphics. Animations of Shang Tsung morphing into other characters were created by Midway&#x27;s John Vogel using a computer, while hand-drawn animations were used for other parts of the game, such as the Fatalities. For animating Goro and Kintaro, clay sculptures were created by Tobias&#x27; friend Curt Chiarelli and then turned into 12-inch latex miniatures that were used for stop motion filming. Because of technical restrictions, the actors&#x27; costumes had to be simple and no acrobatic moves such as backflips could have been recorded; the most difficult moves to perform were some of the jumping kicks.

Several characters (namely Jade, Kitana, Mileena, Noob Saibot, Reptile, Scorpion, Smoke, and Sub-Zero) were created using the first game&#x27;s palette swap technique on just two base models. The game was noted for its &quot;strong
female presence&quot;, as it was featuring more than one woman character as it was common in the genre at the time. Due to memory limitations and the development team&#x27;s desire to introduce more new characters, two fighters from the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, Sonya Blade and Kano, whom Boon cited as the least-picked characters in the game, were excluded, substituted by two palette swaps, Mileena and Reptile. In place of Sonya, two new playable female characters, Kitana and Mileena, were introduced so the game might better compete against Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter II: The World Warrior&quot; featuring Chun-Li. Another planned female fighter, based on the real-life kickboxer Kathy Long whom Tobias admired, was omitted due to time constraints. A male bonus character played by Kyu Hwang was also cut from the game.

==Release==

The first version of &quot;MKII&quot;, revision 1.4, &quot;was effectively a public beta test&quot;, featuring few Fatalities and many software bugs; it also lacked the endings for the characters. It took three subsequent revisions to have the moves and finishing moves finalized and all the bugs corrected, also adding additional content, as development had still been in progress for all that time. The final version was revision 3.1, released in January 1994.

===Marketing and merchandise===
In conjunction with the release of the arcade game in 1993, an official comic book, &quot;Mortal Kombat II Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, written and illustrated by Tobias, was released through mail order, describing the backstory of the game in greater detail. Acclaim Entertainment stated that it &quot;had started &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; with a $10 million global marketing campaign&quot; for the home versions. A part of this sum was used to film and air the live-action TV commercial created by David Anderson and Bob Keen. The video featured Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile (with a notably more reptilian appearance), Kitana, Baraka and Shao Kahn, who were played by the same actors as in the game. The game&#x27;s promotional campaign&#x27;s tagline was &quot;Nothing ... Nothing can prepare you.&quot; In 2008, Eurogamer called &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; &quot;a marketing triumph&quot;.

Malibu Comics published a series of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; comic books featuring the characters from both &quot;MKII&quot; and the original game. &quot;Mortal Kombat II: Music from the Arcade Game Soundtrack&quot;, an album featuring music from &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, composed by Dan Forden, could originally only be purchased by ordering it through a limited CD offer, which was posted on the arcade version of the game&#x27;s attract mode. Other merchandise for the game included a periodical official fanzine &quot;Mortal Kombat II Kollector&#x27;s Magazine&quot; published by Midway and Sendai, a series of collectible stickers for an album by Panini Group, two different series of action figures (released in Argentina in 1995 and in the US in 1999, respectively), and collectible card game &quot;Mortal Kombat Kard Game&quot; that was marketed as &quot;&quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; trading cards&quot;.

===Home releases===
Since 1994, multiple official ports and emulated versions of &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; have been released for a wide variety of home systems, including the 8-bit (Game Boy, Game Gear, and Master System), 16-bit (Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and Sega Genesis / Mega Drive) and 32-bit (32X, PlayStation, and Sega Saturn) consoles, Amiga and MS-DOS computers, and the PlayStation Network (PSN). The Game Boy, Game Gear, SNES, and Genesis versions were released simultaneously on September 13, 1994, dubbed &quot;Mortal Tuesday&quot; by Acclaim&#x27;s marketing. The PlayStation version was released only in Japan, retitled JP; this subtitle was also used for the Japanese release of the Sega 32X port.

*The Sega Genesis / Mega Drive port, developed by Probe Software, retains all of the blood and Fatalities without a special code having to be entered, unlike the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; for the system. It contains several exclusive Easter eggs and features some different character animations for victory poses and a support for the motion controller device Sega Activator.
*The SNES version was developed by Sculptured Software. Because of poor sales of the censored SNES version of the original game, Nintendo decided to allow depictions of blood and Fatalities this time around. Because the industry-wide rating system was not expected to be in effect until November 1994 at the earliest, this version had no formal rating; instead, a warning label was put on the game&#x27;s box in order to inform prospective buyers about the game&#x27;s mature content. The Japanese version, however, is censored to a degree, with green blood for all fighters, as well as the screen colors turning black-and-white for all character-specific lethal Fatalities. John Tobias favored this version over the Genesis version, stating: &quot;I would go so far as to say that the Super NES version is one of the best arcade-to-home conversions I&#x27;ve seen.&quot;
*Also developed by Probe Software, the Game Boy port plays similarly to the Game Boy version of the original game but with characters moving much smoother and faster. It only contains eight of the 12 playable fighters from the arcade game (lacking Baraka, Johnny Cage, Kung Lao and Raiden); Kintaro and Noob Saibot were also removed from the game, yet Jade is included as a hidden fighter. Only three of ten arenas are retained from the arcade version: the Kombat Tomb, the Pit II and Goro&#x27;s Lair. The Kombat Tomb contains the port&#x27;s only Stage Fatality and Goro&#x27;s Lair is much simpler in this version (consisting of a brick wall with no openings or glowing eyes). Blood is completely removed and each playable character retains only one of their Fatalities plus the Babality.
*Also developed by Probe Software, the Sega Game Gear and Master System ports are similar to the Game Boy port, but in color instead of in monochrome. Both of them are almost identical, except for the reduced size of the Game Gear screen, featuring the same fighters and arenas as the Game Boy port, but with the addition of Kintaro. The arena where players fight Jade and Smoke is exclusive to each version. Unlike the Game Boy version, blood is present, but was drastically reduced in quantity when compared to other ports. Because of the systems&#x27; limited graphical resources, some of the Fatalities in the game were altered to completely destroy the opponent&#x27;s body, leaving generic gibs of bones and limbs, while others were also simplified to use common animations.

The game was also featured in several compilation releases, including &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures 2&quot; for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, 
&quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks&quot; for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox as a hidden and unlockable Easter egg, &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play&quot; for the PlayStation Portable, and &quot;Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection&quot; for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Another compilation release, for the Nintendo DS, was canceled. Arcade1Up released a home arcade cabinet compilation that included the game, as well as the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot;.

==Reception==
===Sales===
&quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; proved to be an enormous commercial success and even a cultural phenomenon. WMS Industries, owner of Midway at the time, reported its 1993 sales in the quarter ending December 31 rose to $101 million from $86 million and said much of its revenue gain was related to the sale of the arcade version of &quot;MKII&quot;. It went on to become America&#x27;s highest-grossing arcade game of 1994 according to the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA). By 1996, the number of arcade machines sold approached 25,000 units; at that time, arcade games that sold 5,000 units were considered strong titles (Midway printed special T-shirts to celebrate 300 machines being manufactured in one day) and an arcade cabinet cost $3,000–4,000. The arcade version went on to sell 27,000 units, and grossed . &quot;MKII&quot; was considered an arcade game of the year, taking over from the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;.

On the day of the release of the game&#x27;s first four versions for cartridge-based console systems (Sega&#x27;s Genesis and Game Gear and Nintendo&#x27;s SNES and Game Boy), dubbed &quot;Mortal Friday&quot; (September 9, 1994), celebrated annually by the fan community on the second Friday of September an unprecedented number of more than 2.5 million copies were shipped to be distributed, with the best opening-week sales in video game history at that point. Acclaim&#x27;s analysts expected that the number of copies sold would reach at least 2.5 million within the first few weeks of release (at an average retail price of $60) and the sales to top $150 million by the end of the year.

In the first week of its console release, the game made sales to $50 million, which Acclaim Entertainment said was &quot;The largest introduction of a video game in history&quot;. Distribution of over 2.5 million copies around 15,000 stores required 65 trucks and 11 jumbo jets. First-week sales of over $50 million in the United States surpassed the opening box office results of that season&#x27;s Hollywood film blockbusters, such as &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, &quot;True Lies&quot;, &quot;The Mask&quot;, and &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Approximately units were shipped to stores within a month. &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; became the world&#x27;s best-selling video game (until it was eclipsed by &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, released in November 1994). In the United States, it was the top-selling Genesis, SNES, and Game Gear game in September 1994, and the top Game Gear game the following month. The Genesis version went on to sell 1.78 million copies in the United States, along with an additional 1.51 million American copies of the game for the SNES. In the United Kingdom, it was the top-selling game in September 1994, including for the Mega Drive, SNES, Master System, Game Gear, and Game Boy; it remained the top-selling game for the Master System, Game Gear, and Game Boy in October, and for the Game Gear in November.

By 2002, estimated gross sales of &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; home video games exceeded $400 million. Re-released in 2007, the PSN version has continued to occupy the service&#x27;s top ten monthly sales chart nearly three years later in February 2010.

===Reviews===
The initial critical reception of &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; was overwhelmingly positive, with &quot;Sega Visions&quot; describing the way in which the sequel was directed as &quot;sheer brilliance&quot;, and &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; calling it &quot;the hottest fighter ever&quot;. Tony Brusgul of &quot;The Daily Gazette&quot; opined the &quot;incredible&quot; hype surrounding the game was &quot;well deserved&quot;, describing it as &quot;a perfect blend of great graphics, action and violence&quot;. In his review of the arcade release, Rik Skews of &quot;Computer + Video Games&quot; (&quot;C+VG&quot;) wrote: &quot;the only true rival to &quot;Street [F]ighter II&quot;&quot; returned &quot;in a sequel that bites off the head of the original.&quot;

Regarding the Genesis version, Mark Patterson of &quot;C+VG&quot; wrote that &quot;Probe has done an incredible job with this conversion. Everything is here, and I mean everything.&quot; Sushi-X of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (&quot;EGM&quot;) called the Genesis version &quot;a great translation considering its limitations&quot;, commenting that its graphics and sounds are not as good as those of the SNES version. A reviewer for &quot;The Detroit News&quot; was &quot;very disappointed&quot; with the Genesis port and recommended the SNES version instead.

The four reviewers of &quot;EGM&quot; hailed the SNES version as a &quot;near-perfect&quot; translation of the arcade game. A reviewer for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; called the SNES version &quot;the best game I&#x27;ve ever played - a true translation&quot;, and Patterson noted it was the bloodiest game Nintendo has yet allowed to be released. &quot;C+VG&quot; declared it &quot;the most perfect coin-op conversion ever&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; stated about SNES version that &quot;with full creative license, Acclaim has produced possibly the best arcade conversion ever.&quot;

Regarding the portable console ports, Patterson stated that &quot;no Game Boy owner should go without this&quot; and called the Game Gear version &quot;still the best handheld beat-&#x27;em up&quot; on the market though lacking much canonical content. &quot;EGM&quot; reviewers concurred that the Game Gear version &quot;has eye-popping graphics, and great control - so much so that you won&#x27;t believe this is a portable&quot;, but were less enthusiastic about the Game Boy version. Though they commented that it is better than most fighting games for the system, two of their four reviewers said that it was not worth getting with the game available on much more powerful platforms.

Critical reception of the Amiga version was also mostly very favorable, including Ed Lawrence of &quot;CU Amiga&quot; declaring that &quot;every person who own an Amiga has to own &quot;Mortal Kombat 2&quot;. In terms of revitalising the Amiga market, this is far more important than any Commodore buy-out could ever be.&quot; In a rare dissenting opinion, Jonathan Nash of &quot;Amiga Power&quot; dismissed &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; as &quot;a clearly nonsensical title&quot;, recommending to &quot;buy &quot;Shadow Fighter&quot; instead&quot;. The later PC version was also well-received, with &quot;Next Generation&quot; stating that &quot;if you like fighting games, this is the best that&#x27;s available.&quot;

About the 32X version, IGN&#x27;s Levi Buchanan stated that &quot;if you do not have a SNES, this is the home version of &quot;MKII&quot; to get.&quot; In contrast, &quot;GamePro&quot; remarked that the 32X version offered too little improvement over the Genesis version, even failing to correct the control shortcomings, and was technically poor given the 32X&#x27;s capabilities. In a review of the 32X version of the game, &quot;Next Generation&quot; opined that &quot;&quot;MKII&quot; is a great game, but it&#x27;s a serious case of &#x27;been there, done that!&#x27;&quot; Brazilian magazine &quot;Ação Games&quot; gave the 32X version 5 out of 5 on all six categories.

Reviewing the CD-ROM based Saturn port, &quot;EGM&quot; commented that the graphics are identical to the arcade version but that there are missing sound effects and &quot;unbearable&quot; slowdown when first performing a special move. They rated it the best home version of the game to date but said that with &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; having considerably aged by this point, any port needed to be near arcade perfect to stand out. &quot;Next Generation&quot; said that the Saturn version was arcade perfect, but that the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series as a whole was grossly overrated and lacked any gameplay innovations to make it stand out from other fighting games. They summarized that &quot;if you are a fan of the game (and you know who you are), then the Saturn version is everything you can hope for - an arcade-perfect translation - and yet, there is nothing outside of a flashy presentation and a little gore to recommend this game over a million others just like it.&quot; Scary Larry of &quot;GamePro&quot; agreed that the Saturn port &quot;duplicates the arcade version perfectly&quot;, but argued that the slowdown and load times make the game frustrating to play. He concluded that the conversion would make a decent holdover until &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; was released for Saturn, but fails to measure up to &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; on the PlayStation. &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; was extremely disappointed with the final version of the Saturn port, calling it &quot;much worse than any of the versions seen on the cartridge format&quot;, as opposed to the vastly superior pre-release version they had reviewed five months earlier.

===Awards===
&quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; received numerous annual awards from gaming publications. &quot;Game Players&quot; gave it the titles of &quot;Best Genesis Fighting Game&quot;, &quot;Best SNES Fighting Game&quot; and &quot;Best Overall SNES Game&quot; of 1994. The staff of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; ranked &quot;MKII&quot; as the second (SNES) and fifth (Game Boy) &quot;Top Game&quot; of 1994, while the magazine&#x27;s readers voted it to receive the 1995&#x27;s Nintendo Power Awards for &quot;Best Tournament Fighter (all Nintendo platforms)&quot; and &quot;Best Play Control (Game Boy)&quot;, with the game having been nominated by the staff also in the categories &quot;Worst Villain&quot; (positively, an equivalent of &quot;Best Hero&quot;) and &quot;Best Overall (all Nintendo platforms)&quot;. &quot;VideoGames&quot; named &quot;MKII&quot; as the &quot;Best Fighting Game&quot; of 1994, also awarding it second place in the categories &quot;Best Super NES Game&quot; and &quot;Best Arcade-to-Home Translation&quot;. Other awards included &quot;The Best of the Show (Super NES)&quot; for the SCES &#x27;94 from &quot;GamePro&quot; and &quot;Bloodiest Game of 1994&quot; from &quot;EGM&quot;. In 2017, Gamesradar listed the game 29th on its &quot;Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time&quot;.

===Controversies===

As in the case of the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; game, the content of &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; became the subject of a great deal of controversy regarding violent video games. Nancian Cherry of &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; wrote that both games had &quot;an army of critics too: people upset by the bone-crunching, blood-spurting, limb-ripping violence depicted on the small screen.&quot; According to IGN, &quot;&quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; wore its notoriety as a badge of honor, boasting about it in promotional materials, and even parodying it in-game.&quot; The game was banned in Germany, where &quot;MKII&quot; was put in the index by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons (BPjM) and all versions of the game except for the Game Boy version were subjected to being confiscated from the nation&#x27;s market for violating the German Penal Code by showing excessive violence and cruel acts against representations of human beings. Due to regional censorship, the game was also released with green-colored blood and black-and-white fatality sequences in Japan; it was at that time a unique occurrence of a western game being censored in Japan, not the reverse. Years later, Boon recalled: &quot;I&#x27;ve always had the position that the rating system was a good idea and should be put in place. Once &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; came out, there was a rating system in place. We were an M-rated game, and everybody knew the content that was in there, so it became almost a non-issue.&quot; Tobias agreed, saying that they &quot;were content with the M for mature on our packaging.&quot;

There were also some other controversies. In 1994, Guy Aoki, president of Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA), criticized the game for allegedly perpetuating existing stereotypes of Asians as martial arts experts with the game&#x27;s portrayal of several of its characters. Allyne Mills, a publicist at Acclaim, responded to this by stating: &quot;This is a fantasy game, with all different characters. This is a martial arts game which comes from Asia. The game was not created to foster stereotypes.&quot; Critical studies professor Marsha Kinder accused the game of &quot;a misogynist aspect to the combat&quot;, alleging that &quot;in &quot;MKII&quot;, some of the most violent possibilities are against women. Also, their fatality moves are highly eroticised.&quot;

&quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; actors Daniel Pesina, Philip Ahn, Katalin Zamiar, and Elizabeth Malecki unsuccessfully filed two lawsuits in 1996 and 1997 against Midway, Williams, Nintendo of America, Sega of America, and Acclaim Entertainment for the unauthorized misuse of their likenesses and to seek royalties from sales of the games&#x27; home ports. Pesina, who sought $10 million in the suits for his roles in the first two &quot;MK&quot; games, had appeared in costume as Johnny Cage in a 1994 print advertisement for the fighting game &quot;BloodStorm&quot;. 

===Retrospective===
Over the following years, multiple publications acclaimed &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; as one of the best video games ever. It was ranked as the 97th top game of all time by the staff of &quot;Game Informer&quot; in 2001, as the 38th most important video game of all time by the staff of &quot;GamePro&quot; in 2007, and as the 32nd best video game of all time by &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; in 2010. Featuring it in their 2003 video game hall of fame series, the staff of GameSpot wrote: &quot;&quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; was so much better, as a sequel, than it had to be that it absolutely deserves a place in the pantheon of all-time classics.&quot;

Many publications also listed &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; among the best video games of its genre or era. It was ranked as the third best fighting game by the staff of &quot;GamePro&quot; and the ninth best fighting game of all time by Rich Knight of Cinema Blend in 2008, as the third top fighting game of all time by Marissa Meli of UGO and the second best 2D fighting game ever made by Robert Workman of GamePlayBook in 2010, and as the third best fighting game of all time by Peter Rubin of &quot;Complex&quot; in 2011. It was also ranked as the 53rd best game on any Nintendo platform by the staff of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; in 1997, featured among the 100 best games of the 20th century by Jakub Kralka of Benchmark in 2009, and ranked as the tenth best 16-bit game ever by McKinley Noble of &quot;PC World&quot; that same year.

The game also received accolades for its various conversions. &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; was included among the ten best arcade games by Wirtualna Polska, and ranked as the fifth top arcade game by the staff of GameTrailers in 2009, as the 31st top arcade game of all time by the staff of GameSpy in 2011, and as the sixth best arcade game of the 1990s by &quot;Complex&quot; in 2013. Regarding the 16-bit console versions, &quot;MKII&quot; was ranked as the fourth best ever Genesis game by &quot;Complex&quot; and as the 19th best Genesis game by GamesRadar, as well as the 12th best ever SNES game by Rich Knight of &quot;Complex&quot; and as the 25th top game for the SNES by Richard George of IGN; in 1995, SNES magazine &quot;Super Play&quot; also ranked it as the best sequel on the platform. In Poland, where the Amiga was the most popular gaming platform of the early 1990s, &quot;MKII&quot; was ranked as the ninth best ever Amiga game by Michał Wierzbicki of &quot;CHIP&quot; and as the 22nd best Amiga game by &quot;PSX Extreme&quot; editor-in-chief Przemysław Ścierski. In 1995, Total! Listed the game 4th on its &quot;Top 100 SNES Games&quot;. In 1996, GamesMaster rated the game 35th on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;.

GamesRadar called it &quot;the point when the series became great&quot;. In 2007, GamesRadar included four elements of this game - Dan Forden&#x27;s &quot;Toasty!&quot; effect during an uppercut (also ranked as the 11th funniest moment in video games by Rich Knight of &quot;Complex&quot; in 2012), Friendship and Babality finishing moves, and the ceiling spikes Stage Fatality - among the ten greatest things about &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. Reviewing the PlayStation 3 release in 2007, IGN&#x27;s Jeff Haynes stated that &quot;&quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; still manages to stand up almost 15 years later as one of the best arcade fighters around.&quot; As late as 2009, many fans still considered &quot;MKII&quot; to be the best title in the series. According to a 2011 article by Mike Harradence of PlayStation Universe, the &quot;bigger, bolder and bloodier&quot; game remains &quot;a firm fan favourite among &quot;MK&quot; aficionados&quot;. That year, IGN&#x27;s Richard George wrote that &quot;&quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; is considered by many to be the pinnacle of the series&quot; and called it &quot;still one of the most fun 16-bit fighters to play&quot;. In 2013, Rich Knight and Hanuman Welch of &quot;Complex&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; took everything we loved about the original and magnified it by about a million. ... We still love this game.&quot; That same year, Knight and Gus Turner from the same magazine also ranked it as the sixth best 2D fighting game of all time, stating: &quot;Truth be told, the latest &quot;MK&quot; has nothing on this one. Nothing. A step up from the original in every way, &quot;MK II&quot; was, and still is, a solid, violent game that&#x27;s an essential title to grab for any serious fan of fighting games.&quot; In 2014, Kevin Wong of &quot;Complex&quot; wrote: &quot;Today, we remember &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; for its anarchic spirit—the game was endlessly intriguing and weird, and it had an uneasy atmosphere—anything could happen at any given moment. Critics derided &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; as meaningless shock value, but its sequel proved those naysayers wrong. &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; was a Flawless Victory—irreverent, hilarious, and horrific in equal measures.&quot; 

==Legacy==
On December 26, 2022, the source code for the game, which included cut content, was uploaded online to GitHub. In response, on January 6, 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery sent a DMCA take down notice to GitHub, and public access to the repository was disabled as a result. The leaker then created a new repository titled &quot;not-mk2&quot; which contained the &quot;Controversies&quot; section of the NetherRealm Studios article on Wikipedia.

===Rumored content===
While many games have been subject to urban legends about secret features and unlockable content, these kinds of myths were particularly rampant among the dedicated fan community of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; in connection with &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;. According to GameSpy, &quot;the [arcade gaming] community was abuzz about myriad secrets both true and false.&quot; The game&#x27;s creators did little to dispel those rumors that included supposed &quot;Nudality&quot; or &quot;Sexuality&quot; finishing moves for Kitana and Mileena, Shang Tsung&#x27;s ability to transform into Kano and Goro, a chance to fight Sonya after defeating Jade in a specific way, and &quot;Hornbuckle&quot; being featured as an additional secret character.

Some of them were eventually implemented in subsequent &quot;MK&quot; games. Among these rumors to be adapted later were the Animalities (used in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; and its updates) and an ability to throw an opponent into the mouth of a tree in the Living Forest stage (first used in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks&quot;). Rumored characters included false reports of a red female ninja character who was dubbed &quot;Scarlet&quot; by fans and was officially introduced as Skarlet in 2011&#x27;s &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, and the male ninja Ermac that originated from a misinterpreted indicator in the original game&#x27;s audits menu, and was teased in &quot;MKII&quot; before finally becoming playable in &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot;. A nameless, flaming palette swap of Liu Kang seen in the background of the Pit II stage, initially dubbed &quot;Torch&quot; by fans, officially debuted in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; as secret character Blaze, who later became the final boss of &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;.

===Related titles===
Although the 1995 film &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; was primarily based on the first game, it features elements of &quot;MKII&quot;, such as the characters Kitana and Shao Kahn, and the setting of Outworld.

The plot and characters of the game served as the basis for the 2005 spin-off game &quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks&quot;, a beat &#x27;em up title which follows Liu Kang and Kung Lao as they fight their way through Outworld to defeat Shao Kahn. Some of the plot of &quot;Shaolin Monks&quot;, such as the death of Jade, is not compatible with the general &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; game series.

The events of &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, along with the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (including its expansions), were later retold in the 2011 fighting game &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, which was as an effective reboot of the series. In it, Raiden uses time travel to revisit the tournaments from the original games in the series in order to change the future in the aftermath of Armageddon. The ladder/arcade mode of this game can follow the same order of bosses as in &quot;MKII&quot; (with Shang Tsung, Kintaro and Shao Kahn as the final three opponents, although Goro will often be the ninth opponent instead of Kintaro) and its controls and Fatality system are most reminiscent of &quot;MKII&quot;. Classic costumes from &quot;MKII&quot; were also brought back as alternate outfits for female ninja characters, with some of these costumes exclusive to the PlayStation Vita version.

&quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; was to be one of the three games remade in HD in the cancelled fighting game &quot;Mortal Kombat HD Arcade Kollection&quot;. However, only a simple compilation game titled &quot;Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection&quot; was released instead.

<doc id="1049279" wikidata="Q3295631" url="?curid=1049279" title="Martin Sharp">
<text>Martin Ritchie Sharp (21 January 1942 – 1 December 2013) was an Australian artist, cartoonist, songwriter and film-maker.

==Career==
Sharp was born in Bellevue Hill, New South Wales in 1942, and educated at Cranbrook private school, where one of his teachers was the artist Justin O&#x27;Brien. 

In 1960, Sharp enrolled at the National Art School at East Sydney.

He was one of the editors of &quot;Oz&quot;, an Australia/UK alternative/underground satire magazine published from 1963 to 1973 and associated with the international counterculture of that era.

Sharp was called Australia&#x27;s foremost pop artist. He wrote the lyrics of the Cream song &quot;Tales of Brave Ulysses,&quot; and created the cover art for Cream&#x27;s &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; and &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; albums.

He designed at least two posters for Australia&#x27;s premier contemporary circus, Circus Oz, including the &#x27;World-famous&#x27;/&#x27;Non-Stop Energy&#x27; design.

==Later interests==
For most of the 1970s and beyond, Sharp&#x27;s work and life was dominated by two major interests: Sydney&#x27;s Luna Park and the entertainer Tiny Tim.

===Luna Park===

Sharp&#x27;s involvement as an artist, in the restoration of Luna Park Sydney in the early 1970s, proved a bittersweet experience.

In 1979, as pressure mounted to redevelop the prime harbourside site, a fire in the Luna Park Ghost Train claimed seven lives, including a father and his two sons and four 13-year-old schoolmates. The fire was a turning point in Sharp&#x27;s life; like many others he firmly believed that it was a deliberate act of terrorism aimed at destroying the park and making the site available for redevelopment. He later stated this had a profound effect on his spiritual outlook.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Sharp played an important role in saving Luna Park from development as the head of the Friends of Luna Park activist group.

===Tiny Tim===
Sharp first saw performer Tiny Tim at the Royal Albert Hall in 1968 at the suggestion of Eric Clapton. From that time on, Tiny Tim was one of Sharp&#x27;s strongest inspirations.

&quot;Tim&#x27;s appropriation of song is very much like my appropriation of images. We are both collagists taking the elements of different epochs and mixing them to discover new relationships.&quot; 

===&quot;Eternity&quot;===
Sharp&#x27;s work was celebrated in many exhibitions including a special&quot; Yellow House&quot; exhibition at the Art Gallery of NSW and a major retrospective at the Museum of Sydney which ran from October 2009 to March 2010.

===Sydney Opera House===
Sharp maintained a lifelong friendship with artist Lin Utzon, daughter of the Danish architect of the Sydney Opera House Jørn Utzon. The architect was controversially forced from his uncompleted masterpiece in 1966 and secretly left Australia with the aid of Sharp&#x27;s mother.

In the mid-1990s, Sharp helped broker a reconciliation between the Sydney Opera House and Jørn Utzon, who subsequently developed a set of design principles to guide the building&#x27;s future.

===&quot;Street of Dreams&quot;===
Sharp merged several of his key obsessions - Tiny Tim, Luna Park, Sydney and the 1979 Luna Park Ghost Train fire - into a planned feature documentary entitled &quot;Street of Dreams&quot; that explored all of these themes and the perceived connections between them. The film was never finished, though a rough cut screened at festivals circulates online.

==Death==
Sharp inherited the heritage-listed house &quot;Wirian&quot;, in Victoria Road, Bellevue Hill, Sydney, in 1978. The house had been bought by Sharp&#x27;s grandfather, Stuart Douglas Ritchie, a merchant, in 1937 for 20,000 pounds. Sharp lived there until he died from emphysema on 1 December 2013, at the age of 71.

<text>Rupert John Cornford (27 December 1915 – 28 December 1936) was an English poet and communist. During the first year of the Spanish Civil War, he was a member of the POUM militia and later the International Brigades. He died while fighting against the Nationalists, at Lopera, near Córdoba.

== Biography ==

Cornford was the son of Francis Cornford and Frances Cornford (née Darwin), and was a great-grandson of Charles Darwin and Emma Darwin. He was born in Cambridge, and named after Rupert Brooke, who was a friend of his parents, but preferred to use his second name. His younger brother Christopher grew up to be an artist and writer.

Cornford was educated at King&#x27;s College School, Cambridge, and at Stowe School, where at the age of sixteen he won an Open Major Scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, matriculating in 1933. He took first class honours in Part I of the Historical Tripos and a starred first in Part II. On graduating he was awarded the Earl of Derby Research Scholarship. 

He began writing poetry at the age of fourteen, strongly influenced by Robert Graves and W. H. Auden, and as a schoolboy argued fiercely about poetry with his mother, a member of the more sedate &quot;Georgian&quot; group whose most famous representative was A. E. Housman. He spent a year in London studying at the London School of Economics and becoming a speaker and organiser for the Young Communists. At Cambridge as an undergraduate, reading history, he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain. He was two or three years younger than the group of Trinity College communists including Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Kim Philby and James Klugmann.

Another Cambridge student, who would play a major part in his life, was Margot Heinemann, a fellow Communist. They were lovers and he addressed poems and letters to her. He had previously been in a relationship with a Welsh woman, Rachel (Ray) Peters, with whom he had a child, James Cornford, later adopted by John&#x27;s parents. A photograph of Peters and Cornford can be found at the National Portrait Gallery, London.

From 1933 he was directly involved in Communist Party work in London, and became associated with Harry Pollitt, the General Secretary of the CPGB. 

In August 1936, shortly after the start of the Spanish Civil War, he travelled to Barcelona and joined the POUM militia, serving briefly on the Aragon front where he wrote his three most famous poems including the often-reprinted &quot;To Margot Heinemann&quot; (originally simply entitled &quot;Poem&quot;). The following month he returned to England, where he recruited twenty-one British volunteers, including Bernard Knox, John Sommerfield, Chris Thorneycroft and Griffin Maclaurin. With this group he travelled to Paris and then on to Albacete, where they joined the International Brigades—the nucleus of what would become the British Section. He served with a machine-gun unit of the Commune de Paris Battalion, and fought alongside a number of other British volunteers in the defence of Madrid through November and December 1936, including Esmond Romilly. During the Battle of Ciudad Universitaria he was wounded in the head by shrapnel, but he refused to rest and, after twenty-four hours in hospital, returned to the front. In the Battle of Boadilla del Monte in December his unit for the first time faced massed German troops, and under heavy bombardment were forced to retreat twelve kilometres in twenty-four hours. Here, as commander chosen by his own men, he &quot;acquitted himself magnificently&quot;, saving many lives. Having transferred to the recently formed British Battalion, he was killed in uncertain circumstances at Lopera, near Córdoba. Confirmation of his death reached England one month later.

== Legacy ==
A memorial volume to Cornford was published in 1938. As Stephen Spender observed in his review of the book, &quot;Cornford&#x27;s life speaks for itself in a way that burns the imagination ... The fact that Cornford lived and that others like him still live, is an important lesson to the leaders of democracies. It shows that people will live and die and fight for democracy if it gives them the justice and freedom which are worth fighting for.&quot;

Cornford&#x27;s poem &quot;Full Moon At Tierz&quot; (1937) is a literary expression of the anti-fascist cause. It has been said of Cornford, specifically in relation to this poem, that as a poet he was not a modernist. One justification for this claim is the following passage from George Orwell&#x27;s 1940 essay &quot;My Country Right or Left&quot;:
Far from being dismissive, this is actually approving. Orwell is claiming that emotions like school spirit and patriotism—deep allegiances—can shift from one cause to another, from conservatism to revolution, and be just as sincere. However, Cornford was never a conventional public-school boy. He attended Stowe, a new and very liberal school, only from August 1929 to January 1933—hardly more than three years. By the middle of his seventeenth year he was living in London, attending the London School of Economics, and was a committed Communist organiser and speaker.
British critic Stan Smith, in his essay &quot;&#x27;Hard As the Metal of My Gun&#x27;: John Cornford&#x27;s Spain&quot;, undertakes a detailed reading of &quot;Full Moon at Tierz&quot; that brings out its complexity and ambivalence. The poem begins with a Marxist and modernist vision of history as a mountain glacier where &quot;[t]ime was inches, dark was all&quot; until it reaches &quot;[t]he dialectic&#x27;s point of change&quot; and &quot;crashes in light and minutes to its fall.&quot; Now &quot;Time present is a cataract whose force Breaks down the banks even at its source… And we must swing it to its final course.&quot; Certainly, despite its far wider focus and dense philosophical imagery, the poem so far is, like Newbolt&#x27;s, an expression of determination, as the final stanza of this section shows:

While &quot;Time future, has no image in space&quot;—it doesn&#x27;t yet exist—Cornford asserts that &quot;We are the future.&quot; But the future is also both &quot;crooked&quot; and &quot;straight&quot;: that is, the fight is straightforward, but the road to the future he and his comrades embody is crooked, winding, uncertain.

The second part of the poem is a complex and highly referential reflection on the then-recent history of the Communist movement. Cornford believes that the new policies of the Communist International (about which Smith argues, he has serious doubts) will be tested in practice:
 
(Oviedo is a city in Northern Spain where miners had already taken up arms against the dictatorship that preceded the Second Spanish Republic; the Mauser is a type of rifle.)

In the third section, Cornford confronts his own isolation. Smith discusses what he calls &quot;the paradoxical fusion of solidarity and solitude in a single line at the heart of &#x27;Full Moon at Tierz&#x27;: &#x27;Now with my Party, I stand quite alone&#x27;. In the midst of all this enforced solidarity, it is the loneliness which persists.&quot; Smith goes on: &quot;A hesitant and solitary being wills himself, in a kind of prayer to an absent Marxian deity, not to lose his faith, to be a good Communist&quot;:

The raw, even violent emotional honesty of these lines is both very modern—one cannot imagine a poet before about 1920 writing them—and very characteristic of Cornford&#x27;s mature poetry.

His best-known poem, usually titled (after Cornford&#x27;s death) &quot;To Margot Heinemann,&quot; partakes of the same emotional directness, but in a more tender vein. The poem has been described by the poet Carol Rumens as &quot;one of the most moving and memorable 20th-century love poems&quot;. While the form is in some respects traditional—ballad-form quatrains with rhyme scheme ABCB—its rhythms are skillfully irregular, with two to three stresses per line, and its rhymes often slant, including those of the moving last stanza: &quot;And if bad luck should lay my strength Into the shallow grave, Remember all the good you can; Don&#x27;t forget my love.&quot; Rumens says: &quot;You feel as if you have been presented with a photograph of a young soldier&#x27;s inner life. He is a passionate lover and a passionate warrior: these qualities are held in perfect psychic balance. And they are timeless. The speaker could be one of Homer&#x27;s heroes. He could be a Spartan at Thermopylae.&quot; But the famous opening lines &quot;Heart of the heartless world, / Dear heart, the thought of you&quot; actually contain a blind quotation from Marx, who in the Introduction to his &quot;Critique of Hegel&#x27;s Philosophy of Right&quot; describes religion as &quot;the heart of a heartless world.&quot;

In his 1942 introduction to &quot;The Fury of the Living&quot;, a collection of poems by John Singer, Hugh MacDiarmid calls Cornford (along with Christopher Caudwell, another young writer killed fighting in Spain), one of the &#x27;few inspiring exceptions&#x27; from the &#x27;leftist poets of the comfortable classes&#x27;.

The character of Tommy Judd in the 1981 award-winning play &quot;Another Country&quot; by Julian Mitchell was based on Cornford.&quot;

== James Cornford ==
John&#x27;s son, James (1935–2011), who was nearly two years old when John was killed in action, became an academic and social reformer. Educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Cambridge, he earned both a first-class degree in history and a Harkness Fellowship, and was made a fellow of his college at the age of 25. In 1964 he became a lecturer in Politics at the University of Edinburgh, and four years later was appointed the university&#x27;s Professor of Politics, succeeding Harold Hanham. His rapid elevation was controversial, given his lack of a doctorate, his slender publications record (one book chapter and a journal article), and his family&#x27;s close acquaintance with the university&#x27;s then vice-chancellor, Michael Swann. Resigning in 1976 to join the Outer Circle Policy Unit (a creation of the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust), Cornford went on to lead a variety of organizations, including the Nuffield Foundation, the Campaign for Freedom of Information (1984–1997), the Paul Hamlyn Foundation, and the Institute for Public Policy Research, as well as becoming the literary editor and later chairman of &quot;The Political Quarterly&quot; academic journal. He served as an advisor to David Clark after the Labour Party was returned to government in 1997, but when Clark&#x27;s advocacy for a strong freedom of information law was rejected by Cabinet, both men resigned. James Cornford was survived by four children and his wife.

<doc id="1049299" wikidata="Q671784" url="?curid=1049299" title="Deakin, Australian Capital Territory">
<text>Deakin (postcode: 2600) is a suburb of Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia. Development began in the 1920s, although the vast majority of the suburb was built after 1945. It is a largely residential suburb. It includes The Lodge (the official residence of the Prime Minister), and the Royal Australian Mint.

==History==

Deakin was gazetted in 1928 and is named after Alfred Deakin, second prime minister of Australia. Streets in Deakin are named after Governors, Governors-General and diplomats.

Deakin includes several items that are listed by the ACT Heritage Council:

*Canberra Girls&#x27; Grammar School Boarding House on Melbourne Avenue, which was the original school building with school rooms on the lower floor and boarders on the upper floor. Construction began on 8 May 1927 and was finished in 1928. It is a two-storey building with an attic room designed in the Interwar Tudor Revival style. The Heritage Council says it is significant as a &quot;fine example of Interwar Old English style architecture and one of the very few in Canberra.&quot;
*10 Gawler Crescent, a Post-War International style residence designed by Alex Jelinek in 1956.
*70 Dominion Circuit, which is seen by the Heritage Council as demonstrating &quot;a way of life that is no longer practised. The house and garage remain in original condition, demonstrating the character of a block and dwelling occupied by early middle to upper ranking Canberra public servants from the immediate pre to the immediate post World War 2 period.&quot;
*The Deakin Anticline (see Geology).

The Lodge and the Royal Australian Mint are listed on the Commonwealth Heritage List.

==Suburb amenities==
A local shopping centre is located on Hopetoun Circuit and contains an IGA supermarket, service station, newsagent, chemist, and restaurants. The Deakin Health Spa, adjacent to the shops, has recently been taken over and rebadged as the local Fitness First facility. The Canberra Deakin Soccer Club is also located near by. The Embassy Hotel/Motel was also adjacent to the shops, but has since been demolished. 

==Education==
Schools in the suburb of Deakin include Alfred Deakin High School (originally Deakin High), Canberra Girls&#x27; Grammar School and the erroneously named Woden School, which has always been situated within the South Canberra district of Canberra, not the Woden Valley district.

Deakin residents get preference for:
*Depending on the address: Forrest Primary or Yarralumla Primary
*Depending on the address: Deakin High School or Telopea Park School (for high school)
*Narrabundah College

The Canberra Japanese Supplementary School Inc., a Japanese weekend educational programme, holds its classes at Deakin High School, while it has its school office in Yarralumla. It was established on 1 August 1988.

==Notable places==

===Embassies===
Deakin contains the embassies of Afghanistan, Bosnia, Hungary and Italy and the high commissions of Brunei, Cyprus, Fiji, Mauritius and Solomon Islands

===The Lodge===
Located on Adelaide Avenue the Lodge is the official residence of the Prime Minister of Australia.

===The Royal Australian Mint===
Officially opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 22 February 1965, the Royal Australian Mint was commissioned to produce Australia&#x27;s decimal coinage, which came into effect on 14 February 1966.

==Demographics==
At the , the population of Deakin was 3,124; 1.3% were Indigenous, 69.3% were born in Australia and 5.1% were born in England. 78.4% of people only spoke English at home. 67.9% of dwellings were separate houses (compared to the Australian average of 72.3%), 18.0% were semi-detached, row or terrace houses (Australian average: 12.8%) and 13.9% were flats, units or apartments (Australian average: 14.2%). 43.8% of the population were professionals, compared to the Australian average of 24.0%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 41.7%, Catholic 19.9% and Anglican 13.4%.

== Politics ==
Deakin is located within the federal electorate of Canberra, which is currently represented by Alicia Payne in the House of Representatives. In the ACT Legislative Assembly, Deakin is part of the electorate of Murrumbidgee, which elects five members on the basis of proportional representation; as of 2020, the members are two Labor, two Liberal and one Greens. Polling place statistics are shown to the right for the &quot;Deakin&quot; polling place at Canberra Girls&#x27; Grammar School Junior School, Grey St in the 2022 federal and 2020 ACT elections.

==Geology==

The west of the suburb exposes Yarralumla Formation calcareous shale, sandstone, tuff and hornfels. The east of the suburb exposes Mount Painter Volcanics dark grey to green grey dacitic crystal tuff and agglomerate. A patch of cream rhyolite, tuff and ashstone is found in the mid east near Empire Circuit.

The Deakin Fault does not actually pass through Deakin. The Deakin Fault is a major fault in Canberra running North-west to south-east passing through state circle very close to Deakin. It extends from the hills to the east of Jerrabomberra via Narrabundah, Griffith, Forest, Yarralumla, then across the Molonglo River to Cook, then turns north east in Macquarie where it turns around to the north west again via Belconnen, Evatt, Melba, Flynn, Charnwood, Dunlop and out the north west of the ACT. It continues to the east end of Lake Burrunjuck near Yass. The block on the north east side was elevated and the south west side lowered.

The Deakin Anticline is a geological monument located between the Deakin Oval and the Grange Retirement Village. It is in the Yarralumla Formation in Tuffacious sandstone and siltstone. Access is from Hannah Place.

<doc id="1049302" wikidata="Q52988199" url="?curid=1049302" title="Mayor of Wellington">
<text>The Mayor of Wellington is the head of the municipal government of the City of Wellington. The mayor presides over the Wellington City Council. The mayor is directly elected using the Single Transferable Vote method of proportional representation. The current mayor is Tory Whanau, elected in October 2022 for a three-year-term.

Whanau, a member of the Green Party who ran as an independent, won the 2022 Wellington mayoral election in a landslide. She will be inaugurated within the same month. Whanau is the first indigenous person, and therefore the first Māori woman, to ascend to the Wellington mayoralty.

==History==
The development of local government in Wellington was erratic. The first attempt to establish governmental institutions, the so-called &quot;Wellington Republic&quot;, was short-lived and based on rules written by the New Zealand Company. Colonel William Wakefield was to be the first president.

When the self-proclaimed government arrested a ship&#x27;s captain for a violation of Wellington law, the Governor William Hobson quickly asserted British sovereignty over the whole of New Zealand, sending a warship and contingent of soldiers to Wellington Harbour and disbanding the council through a show of force.

In January 1842, the Legislative Council in Auckland passed the &quot;Municipal Corporations Ordinance&quot;, and in May 1842 Wellington was officially proclaimed a borough, the first municipality with this status. The office of mayor was established, but there were only two holders of this office under the Ordinance. George Hunter received the most votes in the election for 12 Burgesses to the new council on 3 October 1842 and was declared mayor. He died suddenly on 19 July 1843. William Guyton was then declared mayor, as runner-up in 1842.

The British Government disallowed the &quot;Municipal Corporations Ordinance&quot;, but news of this did not reach Wellington until late September 1843, after the election had been held and a second Burgess Roll of qualified voters had been prepared, in 1843 (both Rolls are listed in &quot;Carman 1970&quot;). After a brief period of little local government, the Province of Wellington was established in 1852, and most of Wellington&#x27;s affairs were handled by the provincial government.

In 1863, a Town Board was established with three wards (Thorndon, Lambton, Te Aro), but no Mayor.

On 16 September 1870, Wellington was officially incorporated as a city, and a new mayoralty created, which continues to be in place. The establishment of the new council was primarily driven by John Plimmer, called by some the Father of Wellington. Initially, the councillors elected one of their own as mayor towards the end of the year. The role was traditionally awarded to the longest serving councillor. The system changed upon the introduction of The Municipal Corporations Acts Amendment Act, 1875. It legislated that mayors must be elected at large by eligible voters. The inaugural mayoral election was held in 1874 resulting in William Sefton Moorhouse being the first mayor to be elected directly by voters.

Since then the office of mayor has been held by 37 people. Five people have been mayor on two separate occasions, and the longest-serving mayor was Sir Frank Kitts, from 1956 to 1974. Tory Whanau, elected in 2022, is the first Māori person to serve as mayor.

<text>The Atlas Car and Manufacturing Company was a manufacturer of small railroad locomotives. The company was based in Cleveland, OH, building equipment from 1896 through the 1980s.

==Overview==
Atlas specialized in the building of small locomotives and purpose built rail borne equipment for industrial use. The equipment it manufactured seldom ran on the rails of Class I railroads, but were often used to shuttle freight cars around inside manufacturing plants. Atlas&#x27;s products ranged from small 2-ton end cab switchers up to 65-ton center cab switchers. They also built a wide variety of equipment for the steel industry including blast furnace transfer cars, scale cars, coke quench cars, coke quench locomotives (to 75 tons), furnace cars and self-propelled flatcars. While most equipment was built for steel and coke plants within the United States, some equipment was shipped outside the country (for example 5 scale cars to Russia).

She has also been a voluntary grief counsellor. She holds an MBA degree from Victoria University of Wellington.

==Local-body politics==
Prendergast started her political life as a Tawa Borough councillor in 1986. In 1989 she was elected to Wellington City Council and was re-elected every three years until 2010. In 1995 Prendergast became Deputy Mayor to Mark Blumsky.

She was a speculated candidate for the National Party nomination at the 1992 Wellington Central by-election, but quickly ruled herself out as a candidate, but stated national politics were a &quot;future possibility&quot; for her. In the 1999 general election Prendergast stood as a National list candidate, ranked 30th on the party&#x27;s list. However, the National Party did not gain enough of the party vote for Prendergast to enter Parliament. She considered running again at the 2002 election, but in 2001 Mark Blumsky announced his intention not to run for the mayoralty again, and endorsed Prendergast&#x27;s mayoralty candidacy.

Prendergast was elected mayor in 2001 and re-elected in 2004 and 2007. During her time as Mayor, Prendergast instigated the policy of making Wellington the &quot;Creative Capital&quot;. She has endorsed changing the Flag of New Zealand.

In the 2010 Wellington City mayoral election, Prendergast was challenged by Green Party city councillor Celia Wade-Brown for the Wellington mayoralty. After the counting of special votes, Wade-Brown was declared the winner by a 176-vote margin, ending nearly a decade of Prendergast&#x27;s mayoralty.

==Other roles==
In 2011 she became chair of the Environmental Protection Authority and of the Tourism Board. She is on the board of Kirkaldie and Stains Ltd, WorkSafe NZ, Phoenix Football Club, and is on several advisory boards.

Prendergast was Vice President of Local Government New Zealand and a trustee of the Joe Aspell Trust during her time as Mayor. She has been executive chair of the New Zealand International Festival of the Arts since 2011. She was a director of Wellington International Airport Limited and the Wellington Region Association of Midwives until 2010. She is an honorary life member of the Katherine Mansfield Birthplace Society and of Plunket.

In 2015 Prendergast accepted the role of ambassador for Alzheimer&#x27;s New Zealand, having had personal experience of the disease - both her late father Denis and her mother Beverley Ferrier suffered the disease.

==Honours and awards==

In the 2011 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Prendergast was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to local-body affairs, and in the 2019 New Year Honours, she was promoted to Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to governance and the community.

In 2014, Prendergast received the New Zealand Women of Influence Award in the local and regional category.

== Personal life ==
Prendergast&#x27;s father, Denis Ferrier, was also a local politician. In 1970 he was elected to the Tawa Borough Council and in 1986 he was elected to the Kapiti Borough Council. She is married and has two daughters. Her son, Andrew, was killed on 31 March 2011 in a riding accident.

<text>The parliamentary under-secretary of state (or just parliamentary secretary, particularly in departments not led by a Secretary of State) is the lowest of three tiers of government minister in the UK government, immediately junior to a Minister of State, which is itself junior to a Secretary of State.

== Background ==

The Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 1975 (c. 27) provides that at any one time there can be no more than 83 paid ministers (not counting the Lord Chancellor, up to 3 law officers, and up to 22 whips). Of these, no more than 50 ministers can be paid the salary of a minister senior to a Parliamentary Secretary. Thus, if 50 senior ministers are appointed, the maximum number of paid Parliamentary Secretaries is 33.

The limit on the number of unpaid Parliamentary Secretaries is given by the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975, ensuring that no more than 95 government ministers of any kind can sit in the House of Commons at any one time; there is no upper bound to the number of unpaid ministers sitting in the House of Lords.

The position should not be confused with the Permanent Secretary, which is the most senior civil servant in a government department (also known as the Permanent Under-Secretary of State), nor with a Parliamentary Private Secretary (an MP serving as an assistant to a minister entitled to directly relevant expenses but no further pay).

Of his tenure as an under-secretary in Macmillan&#x27;s 1957–1963 Conservative government from the Lords, the Duke of Devonshire noted: &quot;No one who hasn&#x27;t been a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State has any conception of how unimportant a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State is&quot;.

She most recently served as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Mission in the Republic of South Sudan, completing her term in July 2014 

== Early life and education ==

Born in Arusha, Taganyika (modern-day Tanzania) to parents who worked for the Norwegian Missionary Society, she came to Norway at the age of 7. She was awarded a Cand. polit. degree at the University of Oslo in 1991, specializing in development anthropology.

== Career ==
Becoming a member of the Young Christian Democrats at age 16, she was elected to the Parliament of Norway for the Christian Democratic Party from Rogaland in 1993 and re-elected in 1997.

As minister, Hilde F. Johnson played a pivotal role in the peace process in Sudan, leading to the completion of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between government and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army/Movement in 2005. She has engaged in peace building efforts and post crisis-transition processes in relation to a number of countries in Africa, Asia and Central America, notably the Horn of Africa, Sudan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Timor Leste, Guatemala and the Great Lakes-region.

She has been involved in efforts to build coalitions for change, both of the UN, in the Bretton Woods Institutions (BWIs) and bilateral aid. In 1998, Johnson initiated the Utstein-group, a group of key likeminded development ministers from the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and Norway to spearhead this agenda. She worked closely with the senior leadership of the UN, the International Financial Institutions and the World Trade Organization (WTO) and leaders of developing countries, to bring about better pro-poor development policies. She has served as Governor and member of the Board of the World Bank for Norway and the Nordic/Baltic Constituency.

Johnson served as deputy executive director of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)from 2007 to 2011. In this capacity she was in charge of global partnerships and the organization’s humanitarian operations and crisis response all over the world and worked closely with the heads of UN-agencies and NGOs to improve delivery on the ground. She also had the responsibility for overseeing programmes in the areas of child protection and child rights. Hilde F. Johnson has facilitated and led campaigns in several areas among a broad spectrum of stakeholders. These include, for example, Education for All, Children in Armed Conflict and Sexual Violence in Conflict (chairing the network UN Action, spearheading the efforts of the UN-family).

Following her assignment in South Sudan, Johnson served as a member of the UN Secretary General&#x27;s High Level Panel on Peace Operations (HIPPO) (2014-2015) and was a Senior Fellow at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI) (2015).

<doc id="1049318" wikidata="Q6957189" url="?curid=1049318" title="Nacho King!">
<text>Nacho King! (Aka Steven Fullelove) is the largest Tex-Mex food manufacturer in the Philippines. It operates kiosk and food cart franchises in many marketplaces and malls in the major cities of the Philippines. Nacho King is the largest and only nationwide Tex-Mex retailer in the Philippines, and also exports its products internationally, primarily to markets in Asia. The business was founded in 1995 and began selling franchises in 1996. Nacho King also sells other products besides nachos including corn chips, tacos, tortillas, and tostadas, which are available for wholesale as well as retail.

== History ==
In 1994, Mike Singh returned to the Philippines after going to college in the United States. He had experienced Mexican food in the US and realized that there was an opportunity to bring that experience to the Philippines. At the time, Filipinos tended to eat in malls and Mike and his friend Teddy Manotec realized that they could help bring the food cart industry to their country.

In April 1995, they opened their first outlet in SM North and quickly had lines out the door. By 1997, the two realized that they could not keep up with the immense demand for Nacho King! and decided to develop a franchise program, which became successful.

By 1998, Nacho King&#x27;s! suppliers couldn&#x27;t keep up with the large amount of demand for the products, so Nacho King had to redesign their supply chain. Mike and Teddy decided to go to the United States so that they could instill their own tortilla chip manufacturing line. After doing research they bought their first property and plant. They decided to make their tortilla chips from scratch, while importing the rest of their ingredients from the U.S. Due to their new increased supply, they had excess product, and they decided to wholesale sell their products to bars and restaurants, therefore becoming more diversified.

By 2000, Nacho King&#x27;s corporation Emtyh decided to diversify into other industries. These industries included magazine publishing, internet auctions, and juice production. In 2001, Nacho King! had mobile carts to sell its food, and it continues to be one of the biggest food cart businesses in the Philippines.

== Franchising ==
Nacho King! allows prospective entrepreneurs to run their own franchise of the company. In order to do so, applicants must apply. They must submit the required documents, be interviewed, complete training, and be approved by Nacho King!. The potential franchisee will then be sent a starter package after their franchise site has been evaluated, and a feasibility study has been conducted .

=== Franchise Types ===
Currently, on the Nacho King! website the only available franchise type is a mall cart.

=== Franchise Cost ===
According to the Nacho King! website, the cost for a franchisee to set up a Nacho King! franchise is approximately PHP 580,000, along with the monthly cost of buying more supplies

== Products ==
Nacho King! offers a variety of products at their locations, and that are also available for wholesale. Products include chips, cheese, meat, salsa, and more.

<doc id="1049321" wikidata="Q346396" url="?curid=1049321" title="Joey Tempest">
<text>Rolf Magnus Joakim Larsson (born 19 August 1963), known professionally as Joey Tempest, is a Swedish musician. He is best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band Europe. He has written most of the band&#x27;s biggest hit songs, including &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;, &quot;Rock the Night&quot;, &quot;Cherokee&quot; and &quot;Carrie&quot;. 

== Early life ==
Rolf Magnus Joakim Larsson was born in Stockholm, Sweden on 19 August 1963. When he was eight years old, he would sit in front of the television or radio with a tape recorder and try to capture songs from the UK or US that he liked and listen to them over and over again. He learned how to play the piano and a friend of his father&#x27;s taught him three chords (A, D and E) on his sister&#x27;s acoustic guitar.

Larsson played football and ice hockey and competed in go-cart racing; he once came in fourth place in the Junior Cart Race, a Swedish championship. Like many of the other Europe members, Larsson grew up in Stockholm suburb Upplands Väsby. His biggest influences were Thin Lizzy and Led Zeppelin. During his teens, Larsson played in a number of bands such as Jet, Blazer, Made in Hong Kong and Roxanne. At that time, Larsson alternated between playing rhythm guitar and bass, in addition to lead vocals.

== Career ==
=== Europe ===
Larsson started performing in 1979, creating the stage name &quot;Joey Tempest&quot;, inspired by William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragicomedy &quot;The Tempest&quot; as well as the song &quot;Sparks of the Tempest&quot; by American progressive rock band Kansas. He formed the band Force with guitarist John Norum, bassist Peter Olsson and drummer Tony Reno. Force immediately began building a reputation and a fanbase in the suburbs of Stockholm. In 1982, they changed their name to Europe and won the music competition Rock-SM. The first prize was a record deal with Hot Records. With Tempest as the frontman, Europe released its self-titled debut studio album in 1983 and &quot;Wings of Tomorrow&quot; in 1984.

During his years with Europe, Tempest wrote numerous international hits. &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; was the biggest; it topped the sales chart in 26 countries, sold 15 million copies, was played at the closing ceremony of the 1987 EuroBasket and 1988 Summer Olympics, became the musical theme of the millennium celebrations and a ringtone in hundreds of thousands of mobile phones across the world. After &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;, Europe released two more studio albums, namely &quot;Out of This World&quot; (1988) and &quot;Prisoners in Paradise&quot; (1991), before their final concert in March 1992. Europe ended their final tour in Portsmouth and did not perform together again until New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1999 to 2000.

=== Solo career ===

In 1995, Tempest&#x27;s solo debut album, &quot;A Place to Call Home&quot;, was released. He recalled it his &quot;singer/songwriter album&quot;. The album, which was produced by Dan Sundquist, was recorded in Stockholm and London using Swedish musicians. Europe bandmate John Norum guest-starred on one of the tracks. Tempest also played guitar on the album. &quot;A Place to Call Home&quot; went platinum in Sweden and sold well internationally.

Later the same year, he commenced his first European tour as a solo artist. The following year, he was nominated for a &quot;Best Swedish Artist&quot; Grammy. Four singles were taken from the album, &quot;A Place to Call Home&quot;, &quot;Under the Influence&quot;, &quot;We Come Alive&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Changing On Me&quot;.

Tempest&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Azalea Place&quot;, was released in 1997. The next solo album was recorded in Nashville by producer Richard Dodd, known for producing artists such as The Traveling Wilburys and Tom Petty. Where &quot;A Place To Call Home&quot; had Tempest writing all the material, the new album was written together with others. Among these were Chris Difford from Squeeze and Will Jennings. &quot;&quot;Azalea Place&quot; was mostly written in the studio and was therefore more improvised and experimental&quot;, Tempest commented on the production. &quot;The Match&quot;, &quot;The One In The Glass&quot; and &quot;If I&#x27;d Only Known&quot; were released as singles. &quot;The Match&quot; became one of the most played songs on Swedish radio and the album achieved gold status.

In the autumn of 2002, Tempest released his third solo album named after himself. The production team behind the album was &quot;DeadMono&quot;, consisting of Malcolm Pardon and Fredrik Rinman. The team also worked with Eskobar, Lisa Miskovsky and Stakka Bo. Also collaborating on the album were Chris Difford, former Europe member Mic Michaeli and guitarist Adam Lamprell. The first session took place in Konk Studios, The Kinks old London studio, where Tempest jammed with English musicians, who had formerly played with Massive Attack. This session produced &quot;Magnificent&quot;, &quot;Kill For A Girl Like You&quot; (B-side of the first single &quot;Forgiven&quot;) and &quot;Sometimes&quot;. Work continued in Stockholm, this time with Swedish musicians, including Mic Michaeli. &quot;Superhuman&quot; originated from this session. After that, Tempest kept on working with Adam Lamprell in a temporary studio in London.

Of his songwriting Tempest has said, &quot;Dreamless and Magnificent have a lot of London in them. Losers is influenced by both London and Dublin. Living there can be very intense, almost chaotic. They&#x27;re tough cities and I&#x27;d never have written the lyrics I did without living there.&quot; Some lyrics can also be related to his homeland, reflections on living abroad and learning to live with new people.

=== Resurrection of Europe ===
Nearly twelve years after disbanding, Europe announced a comeback with the same lineup that made &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;. In 2004, they released their sixth studio album, &quot;Start from the Dark&quot;. The seventh, &quot;Secret Society&quot;, followed in 2006, then &quot;Last Look at Eden&quot; in 2009, &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; in 2012, &quot;War of Kings&quot; in 2015 and &quot;Walk the Earth&quot; in 2017.

== Musicianship ==
Tempest played the keyboards on the first two Europe albums before the band decided to recruit keyboardist Mic Michaeli in April 1984. A couple of years earlier, Tempest had borrowed a keyboard from Michaeli and used it to compose the main keyboard hook of the song &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;. After a jam session in 1985, Michaeli and Tempest co-wrote the ballad &quot;Carrie&quot;. Later that year, Tempest wrote the soundtrack for the Swedish film &quot;On the Loose&quot;, as well as the song &quot;Give a Helping Hand&quot; for the benefit project &quot;Swedish Metal Aid&quot;, in the spirit of Band Aid. The song was produced by future Europe bandmate Kee Marcello. In 1986 Tempest wrote and produced the album &quot;One of a Kind&quot; for Tone Norum, John Norum&#x27;s younger sister. Tempest also collaborated with John Norum on the single &quot;We Will Be Strong&quot; from Norum&#x27;s album &quot;Face the Truth&quot; in 1992. This was Tempest and Norum&#x27;s first collaboration since Norum left Europe in November 1986.

After Europe went on hiatus in 1992, Tempest released three solo albums. The first album, &quot;A Place to Call Home&quot; featured a guest appearance from John Norum on the song &quot;Right to Respect&quot;. Several songs on the third album, &quot;Joey Tempest&quot;, were co-written by Mic Michaeli.

In 2024, Tempest appeared on Swedish progressive rock and metal band Opeth&#x27;s on album &quot;The Last Will and Testament&quot; by providing guest backing vocals on the track &quot;§2&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Tempest lives in London with his wife Lisa Joy Worthington and sons James Joakim (born 2007) and Jack Johnston Larsson (born 2014). Tempest talked to Bruce Dickinson about his decision to live in London on the latter&#x27;s BBC 6 Music radio show in 2009. He does not have any social media pages apart from the official ones for Europe listed on their website. 

Asked in 2009, by BBC&#x27;s Liam Allen, &quot;Are you ever embarrassed by some of the hairstyles and clothes you wore back in the day?&quot;, Tempest replied, &quot;Not really, we were very young, we were MTV generation – we were one of the biggest bands on MTV. I just wanted to look like Robert Plant, to be honest.&quot;

<doc id="1049326" wikidata="Q6766765" url="?curid=1049326" title="Mark Blumsky">
<text>Mark Herbert Blumsky (born 29 August 1957) is a former New Zealand politician and diplomat. He was Mayor of Wellington from 1995 to 2001, and a Member of Parliament for the National Party from 2005 to 2008. Blumsky was New Zealand&#x27;s High Commissioner to Niue from 2010 to 2014.

==Early life and family==
Blumsky was born in Nelson in 1957, the son of broadcaster and journalist John Blumsky, and educated at St Bede&#x27;s College and Linwood College in Christchurch. Of Polish and Jewish origin, Blumsky started work at Hannah&#x27;s Footwear Company in 1976 aged 17. He progressed from salesperson, to merchandise manager, to footwear buyer, to national sales manager. In 1989 he founded Mischief Shoes, which grew into a nationwide multimillion-dollar chain. In 1995 he left to enter politics.

==Mayor of Wellington==
In mid-1995 Blumsky sought the nomination of the centre-right Citizens&#x27; Association electoral ticket for the mayoralty, but lost out to Nigel Gould, the former chairman of the Wellington Harbour Board. Blumsky was not dissuaded and immediately declared his candidacy for the mayoralty as an independent candidate. Blumsky was elected Mayor of Wellington in 1995 and re-elected in 1998. One of his main policies during the 1995 election campaign was that he would not allow the council to sell its remaining 51% share of Capital Power. However, during his first term in office Blumsky controversially agreed to sell the council&#x27;s stake in the company, citing commercially sensitive information. The remainder of his mayoralty focused on building Wellington&#x27;s image as an exciting and diverse city to visit and to live in. He was also the inaugural patron of the Wellington Gay Business group GAP. Among other things, he developed Totally Wellington (the regional tourism promoter), established the Wellington Regional Economic Development Agency, and established infrastructure for the film industry.

Financial problems at Mischief Shoes, subsequent to his entering politics, prompted questions from critics and the media about whether he was responsible.

He took pride in living in an inner-city apartment and going out on the town in the evenings. A long-running saga was his good-humoured battle with well-known Courtenay Place busker &#x27;Kenny&#x27;, a cowboy hat-wearing country music singer whose amplifier was confiscated by the council after the volume annoyed other city apartment-dwellers.

Blumsky retired in 2001 and endorsed then deputy mayor Kerry Prendergast as his successor. She went on to win the mayoralty in 2001 and was re-elected in 2004 and 2007.

==2001–2005==
After leaving office, Blumsky returned to business life. From October 2001 to September 2002 he co-ordinated the highly successful Wellington premieres of the first two movies in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy and managed the marketing of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; collectibles for Weta Workshop. During the shooting of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King he took an active role, and was persuaded to throw the severed heads over a set wall onto a group of Knights. The results of this can be seen in the film during the buildup to the battle at Gondor.

In the 2002 Queen&#x27;s Birthday and Golden Jubilee Honours, Blumsky was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for public services.

From September 2002 to July 2004 Blumsky was founding director of Creative HQ, a business incubator for high-growth export-oriented start-ups. From August 2004 to May 2005 he was director (sales and marketing) for Norsewear, an iconic New Zealand clothing company with a multimillion-dollar turnover.

==Member of Parliament==

In early 2004 Blumsky joined United Future at the urging of its leader Peter Dunne, an old school friend. Blumsky, dubbed by media the man with &quot;the most charismatic eyebrows in politics&quot;, served as Party President and confirmed he was considering running for Parliament for the party. However, he resigned soon afterwards, citing a conflict of interest.

In October 2004, Blumsky announced that he would seek the National Party candidacy for the Wellington Central electorate, and was nominated unopposed in November. In June 2005 the National Party released its party list for the elections later that year and Blumsky was ranked 36.

His campaign was marred by an incident in which he received a black eye and other abrasions when returning home late at night. He said he did not recall the incident but believed he had been assaulted. Political opponents suggested he had been inebriated, and a witness reported that he was inebriated when she helped him to his door. Police investigated but no assailant was charged.

Blumksy was elected as a National list MP in the 2005 general election although his challenge to incumbent Wellington Central MP Marian Hobbs was unsuccessful, losing by 6,180 votes. In 2007, he announced that he would not stand again in the next election.

==Niue==
In September 2010, Blumsky was appointed High Commissioner to Niue, replacing acting High Commissioner John Bryan. He was succeeded by Ross Ardern in February 2014.

Blumsky married a Niuean, Pauline Rex, in 2012 and now lives permanently on Niue. He represented Niue in lawn bowls at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, competing in the men&#x27;s pairs and men&#x27;s four, but did not progress beyond the group stage in either event.

Blumsky ran as a candidate in the 2020 Niuean general election but was unsuccessful.

<doc id="1049327" wikidata="Q17122930" url="?curid=1049327" title="Impasse">
<text>A bargaining impasse () occurs when the two sides negotiating an agreement are unable to reach an agreement and become deadlocked. An impasse is almost invariably mutually harmful, either as a result of direct action which may be taken such as a strike in employment negotiation or sanctions/military action in international relations, or simply due to the resulting delay in negotiating a mutually beneficial agreement. The word impasse may also refer to any situation in which no progress can be made. Impasses provide opportunities for problem solving to provide an insight that leads to progress.

Impasse can provide a credible signal that a party&#x27;s position is genuine and not merely an ambit claim.

Impasse may also arise if parties suffer from self-serving bias. Most disputes arise in situations where facts are able to be interpreted in multiple ways, and if parties interpret the facts to their own benefit they may be unable to accept the opposing party&#x27;s claim as reasonable. They may believe the other side is either bluffing or acting unfairly and deserves to be &quot;punished&quot;.

As bargaining impasse is mutually harmful, it may be beneficial for the parties to accept binding arbitration or mediation to settle their dispute, or the state may impose such a solution. Indeed, compulsory arbitration following impasse is a common feature of industrial relations law in the United States and elsewhere.

The word &quot;impasse&quot; is taken from the French .

<doc id="1049348" wikidata="Q13522457" url="?curid=1049348" title="John Butterfield, Baron Butterfield">
<text>William John Hughes Butterfield, Baron Butterfield (28 March 1920 – 22 July 2000) was a leading British medical researcher, clinician and administrator.

==Early life and education==
Butterfield was educated at Solihull School, an historic independent school in the West Midlands. Whilst at Solihull he was Head Boy, Head of CCF and captain of rugby, cricket, hockey and athletics. He continued his sporting passions while studying at Oxford, becoming a triple blue. He then benefited from a two-year Rockefeller Foundation Scholar grant to study at Johns Hopkins University, where he gained a further medical degree.

==Career==
After his degree, national military service awaited him. He spent it as an officer in the Army Physiological Unit and Deputy Director for Scientific Research. He subsequently returned to the United States, to a fellowship at the Medical College of Virginia at Richmond.

Over the years he was appointed to many commissions in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Among his professional research interests was diabetes mellitus. His appointments included one as Professor of Experimental Medicine at Guy&#x27;s Hospital. In 1970 he was invited to accept the position of Vice-Chancellor of the University of Nottingham.

In 1976 he was appointed Regius Professor of Physic at the University of Cambridge where he led the re-establishment of the School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge. In 1978 on the death of Sir Morien Morgan he was elected Master of Downing College, Cambridge, where he was a popular figure. Even after retirement from the post, his links with his adopted College persisted and he did what he could to further its interests. The College bar at Downing is named after him. The Mastership of Downing led to a term also as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge.

==Honours==
Butterfield was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1953. In 1978, he was knighted. He was made a life peer in 1988 as Baron Butterfield, of Stechford in the County of West Midlands.

<text>The Blackmar–Diemer Gambit (or BDG) is a chess opening characterized by the moves:
:1. 
:2. 
:3. 
where White intends to follow up with f3, usually on the fourth move. White obtains a tempo and a half-open f-file in return for a pawn, and as with most gambits, White aims to achieve rapid and active posting of their pieces in order to rapidly build up an attack at the cost of the gambit pawn. It is one of the few gambits available to White after 1.d4. 
==History==
The Blackmar–Diemer Gambit arose as a development of the earlier Blackmar Gambit, named after Armand Blackmar, a relatively little-known New Orleans player of the late 19th century who popularized its characteristic moves (1.d4 d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.f3) and was the first player to publish analysis of the opening. The popularity of the original Blackmar Gambit, however, was short lived, as it was basically unsound, allowing Black to secure a superior position after White&#x27;s immediate 3.f3 with 3...e5. In 1889, Ignatz von Popiel came up with the idea of 3.Nc3, though his main idea was to meet 3...Nf6 with 4.Bg5 (rather than the more usual 4.f3) and provided analysis of the Lemberger Countergambit (3.Nc3 e5).

The evolved, modern form of this gambit owes much to the German master Emil Josef Diemer (1908–1990), who popularized the continuation 3.Nc3 Nf6 and then 4.f3 (when 4...e5 is ineffective as 5.dxe5 hits Black&#x27;s knight, and after 5...Qxd1+ 6.Kxd1 the knight has to retreat to d7 or g8). The position resulting after 3... Nf6 4.f3 reflects the main line of the gambit accepted, although other Black responses on move three are possible. After many years of analysis, Diemer wrote a book on the opening in the late 1950s, titled &quot;Vom Ersten Zug An Auf Matt!&quot; (&quot;Toward Mate From The First Move!&quot;), with most of the published analysis devoted to the Ryder Gambit (and associated Halosar Trap), a double-pawn sacrifice characterized by the moves 4...exf3 5.Qxf3.

==Assessment==
This gambit is considered an aggressive opening, but its soundness continues to be the subject of much debate both on and off the chessboard. Dismissed by many masters on the one hand, and embraced enthusiastically by many amateurs on the other, many consider that Black has good chances of defending successfully and converting the extra pawn in the endgame, while theory suggests that Black has many ways to . As a result, this opening is almost never seen in top-level play, but enjoys a certain popularity among club players. Some titled players, including International Master Gary Lane, consider the opening to be suitable at the club level and for young and improving players. In one of his &quot;Keybooks&quot;, the Rev Tim Sawyer said, &quot;Stop playing for the endgame, play to end the game! Be a winner. Play the Blackmar–Diemer Gambit!&quot; On the other hand, Sam Collins (in his book &quot;Understanding the Chess Openings&quot;) noted the tendency for some Blackmar–Diemer fanatics to try to get the opening in every game, thus limiting their chess experience, and concluded, &quot;Nobody who plays good chess plays this line, and nobody who plays good chess ever will.&quot; Other dismissive quotes include &quot;playing the Blackmar–Diemer Gambit is like shopping for a tombstone&quot; (Andrew Martin) and &quot;To convince an adherent of the BDG that it is unsound, is like trying to convince a child that there is no Santa Claus.&quot; (Kevin Denny). As a result of the intense controversy surrounding the opening, much of the literature on the opening is lacking in objectivity.

GM Boris Avrukh has written that the gambit &quot;may not be fully correct&quot; but cautioned that he &quot;was surprised at just how potent White&#x27;s initiative could become&quot;. Although he was unable to fully refute the gambit and considered that Black faced a non-trivial defensive task, he felt that with correct play Black could emerge with good chances. GM Joe Gallagher wrote that he had &quot;noticed a common trend among Blackmar–Diemer analysts; once there is no attack and the position looks rather balanced they tend to assess the game as =, forgetting the fact that they are a pawn down.&quot; Gallagher thought that the closely related Hübsch Gambit gave an equal game but that the Blackmar–Diemer provided &quot;not really enough compensation&quot; and there were &quot;a number of areas where Black could fight for the advantage.&quot; Nevertheless, he cautioned that Black &quot;inaccuracies can be swiftly punished&quot; in the Blackmar–Diemer. IM John Cox wrote that the gambit was &quot;objectively weak&quot; but pragmatically recommended that Black should enter the Hübsch gambit instead of accepting the Blackmar–Diemer as &quot;sod&#x27;s law dictates that [the reader would meet the gambit] in the third Saturday game of a weekender, when few of us are at our sharpest tactically ... one slip sees you getting torched.&quot; IM Willy Hendriks notes that the main lines of the Blackmar–Diemer (1.d4 d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.f3 exf3 5.Nxf3) and the King&#x27;s Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3) have the same engine evaluation, and philosophically wonders whether the two might have swapped places in an alternative history.

==Main variations==
It is easy for Black to decline the gambit on the second move with 2...e6 (leading to a French Defence) or 2...c6 (leading to a Caro–Kann Defence), although doing so does not eliminate White&#x27;s ability to offer alternative gambits such as the Diemer–Duhm Gambit (2...e6 3.c4) or the Alapin–Diemer Gambit (2...e6 3.Be3), or for instance 2...c6 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.f3 or 4.Bc4 intending 5.f3.

==Main line==
After 1.d4 d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.f3 exf3 5.Nxf3, Black has five main options:

===Gunderam Defence: 5...Bf5 ===
The line 5...Bf5 (along with most of the ...c6/...Bf5 defences for Black in general) was extensively analysed by Gerhart Gunderam, who published his analysis in a book &quot;Blackmar–Diemer Gambit&quot; in 1984. The main response for White is 6.Ne5, intending to attack the black bishop with an advance of the kingside pawns and, if appropriate, weaken Black&#x27;s kingside pawn structure with Ne5xBg6. Black can respond with 6...e6, when after 7.g4, 7...Be4 leads to tremendous complications, e.g. after 8.Nxe4 Nxe4 9.Qf3 Qxd4 10.Qxf7+ Kd8 11.Qf4. More common is 7...Bg6, which leads to quieter play, when White&#x27;s best response is probably 8.Bg2 c6 9.h4, with a sustained kingside initiative in return for the pawn. However, Black also has the option 6...c6 intending 7.g4 Be6, when White has to play accurately to prove enough compensation for the pawn after 8.g5 Nd5 or 8.Bc4 Nd5 9.Qe2 Nd7. White has an alternative in 6.Bd3, directly challenging the bishop, but Christoph Scheerer doubts that White gets enough compensation after 6...Bxd3 7.Qxd3 c6 intending ...e6, ...Nbd7, ...Be7 and ...0-0 with a solid position.

===Teichmann Defence: 5...Bg4 ===
The move 5...Bg4 pins the knight on f3, often with the intention of swapping it off and undermining White&#x27;s central control. White&#x27;s best response is to attack the bishop immediately with 6.h3, when play often continues 6...Bxf3 7.Qxf3 c6 (but not 7...Nc6, when 8.Bb5 is good for White). In this position, White can defend the attacked d-pawn with 8.Qf2 (the Ciesielski Variation), but this allows Black an easy game by preparing ...e7–e5, e.g. after 8...Nbd7 9.Bd3 e5. Alternatively, 8.Be3 is the Classical Variation, where White aims for a slow buildup to a kingside offensive. White&#x27;s other main alternative is 8.g4, the Seidel–Hall Attack, where White is happy to sacrifice the d-pawn in order to gain an increased initiative on the kingside, e.g. after 8...Qxd4 9.Be3 Qe5 10.0-0-0 e6 11.g5. Black can decline the pawn, e.g. after 8...e6 9.g5 Nd5 10.Bd3, leading to sharp play.
Alternatively, after 6.h3, Black can retreat the bishop with 6...Bh5 7.g4 Bg6 8.Ne5, a line which often transposes to the Gunderam Defence line 5...Bf5 6.Ne5 e6 7.g4 Bg6 after a subsequent h3–h4, as White&#x27;s extra tempo with h3 is not particularly useful.

===Euwe Defence: 5...e6 ===
The 5...e6 line, analysed by Max Euwe, aims to reach a French Defence type position, but with Black having an extra pawn. Play usually continues 6.Bg5 Be7, when White&#x27;s most popular option is 7.Bd3. Black can attack the centre immediately with 7...c5!? here, as recommended by Joe Gallagher and James Rizzitano. Play can continue 8.dxc5 Qa5 9.0-0 Qxc5+ 10.Kh1, when White has to play accurately to prove compensation for the pawn. Alternatively 7...Nc6 can be considered the main line of this variation, when 8.0-0 Nxd4 9.Kh1 is the notorious Zilbermints Gambit, sacrificing a second pawn in order to increase White&#x27;s initiative. The Zilbermints Gambit has scored well in practice, but objectively it probably does not give White enough compensation for two pawns. However, the alternative 8.a3, despite the loss of time, offers White good compensation for the pawn, and White can also consider 8.Qd2, allowing the trade of the bishop on d3 but avoiding any loss of time. White&#x27;s main alternative to 7.Bd3 is 7.Qd2, aiming to castle queenside and giving additional support to the d4-pawn, while aiming to launch a kingside offensive with Qd2–f4 and meeting ...h6 with a dangerous Bxh6 sacrifice. Play can continue 7...0-0 8.0-0-0 (8.Bd3 c5! is better for Black) 8...c5 9.Qf4!? cxd4 10.Rxd4 or 7...h6 8.Bh4 (8.Bf4 is also possible, aiming to keep the Bxh6 sacrifice possibility open, but allowing 8...Bb4 9.Bc4 Ne4) 8...Ne4 9.Nxe4 Bxh4+ 10.g3 Be7 11.Bg2, when White has some compensation for the pawn but the final verdict on the resulting positions is still yet to be reached.

===Bogoljubov Defence: 5...g6 ===
The Bogoljubov Defence was played by Diemer himself in a game against Bogoljubov. By fianchettoing the king&#x27;s bishop Black aims to gain increased pressure against the d4-pawn following a subsequent ...c5. White&#x27;s most common response is the Studier Attack, 6.Bc4 Bg7 7.0-0 0-0 8.Qe1, intending Qh4, Bh6 and piling pressure on the kingside, sacrificing pawns at d4 and c2 if appropriate. However, after Peter Leisebein&#x27;s 8...Nc6 9.Qh4 Bg4!, it is doubtful if White obtains enough compensation for the pawn against accurate play. An alternative approach is to castle queenside, play Bh6 and then launch the h-pawn against the black kingside. The best way to carry out this approach is via 6.Bf4, as 6.Bg5 (as played by Bogoljubov in his game against Diemer) is well met by 6...Bg7 7.Qd2 0-0 8.0-0-0 c5!, when Black stands better. If Black tries the same approach against 6.Bf4, i.e. 6...Bg7 7.Qd2 8.0-0-0 c5, then 9.d5 a6 10.d6! gives White good chances.

===Ziegler Defence: 5...c6 ===
Black&#x27;s most critical response to the Blackmar–Diemer Gambit is 5...c6, known as the Ziegler Defence due to Diemer&#x27;s tendency to name lines after opponents that first played them against him, but most of the theory of the line was established by Gerhart Gunderam, who advocated 5...Bf5. Most modern authors recommend this as Black&#x27;s antidote to the BDG, sometimes via O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s move order 4...c6. The old main line runs 6.Bc4 Bf5 7.0-0 e6 8.Ne5, when Black should avoid 8...Bxc2 9.Nxf7!, but instead play 8...Bg6!, when White ends up with very little to show for the lost pawn. More dangerous for Black is 8.Ng5, the Alchemy Variation, where Black has to be careful not to fall for various sacrifices on e6 and f7, but White probably does not get enough compensation for the pawn after 8...Bg6 9.Ne2 Bd6. German FIDE master Stefan Bücker regards Black as clearly better after 10.Nf4 Bxf4 11.Bxf4 0-0, but Christoph Scheerer believes that White can generate attacking chances with 12.c3 h6 13.Qg4!?. In view of White&#x27;s problems proving compensation in these lines, ChessCafe.com reviewer Carsten Hansen concluded, &quot;despite all the smoke and mirrors, the Blackmar–Diemer Gambit still isn&#x27;t viable beyond club-level or rapid-play games&quot;. However, Lev Gutman proposed the alternative 7.Bg5 e6 8.Nh4!? Bg6 9.Nxg6 hxg6 10.Qd3, intending to castle queenside and tie Black down to the f7-pawn, promising long-term positional compensation for the pawn. There are currently insufficient practical tests to determine whether it amounts to enough compensation for the lost pawn. Black cannot easily deviate from this line, since after 7...Nbd7 White continues 8.Qe2 e6 9.0-0-0, aiming to launch a strong attack down the e- and f-files, and if 9...Bb4 then 10.d5!. If White tries to enter this setup after 7...e6 8.Qe2, however, then 8...Bb4! prevents White from safely castling queenside, leaving White with insufficient compensation for the pawn. White also has the dangerous, though probably objectively insufficient, second pawn sacrifice 7.g4, analysed extensively by Stefan Bücker. In the 5...c6 move order White has the alternative 6.Bd3, usually intending to sacrifice a second pawn after 6...Bg4 7.h3 Bxf3 8.Qxf3 Qxd4, leading to sharp complications, though Black can transpose back to the Classical Variation of the Teichmann Defence with 8...e6, since White&#x27;s only good response is 9.Be3. Black can prevent this 6.Bd3 possibility by using O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s move order 4...c6.

==Ryder Gambit: 5.Qxf3 ==
Alternatively, White can offer a second pawn with 5.Qxf3. Gary Lane argued in 2000 that White has serious problems proving enough compensation for the sacrificed pawns after 5...Qxd4 6.Be3 Qg4 7.Qf2 e5. Black can also decline the pawn with 5...c6 or 5...e6, holding the position.

The Halosar Trap (named after Hermann Halosar) follows after 6...Qb4 7.0-0-0 Bg4? 8.Nb5! threatening mate with 9.Nxc7#. The black queen cannot capture the knight because 8...Qxb5 9.Bxb5+ is check, gaining time for the white queen to escape the threat from the bishop. The line continues 8...Na6 9.Qxb7 Qe4 (Black lost in Diemer vs. Halosar, Baden-Baden 1934, after 9...Rc8 10.Qxa6) 10.Qxa6 Qxe3+ (worse is 10...Bxd1 11.Kxd1 Rd8+ 12.Bd2 and White is winning, for example 12...Ng4 13.Nxc7+ Kd7 14.Qxa7) 11.Kb1 Qc5 12 Nf3. Burgess wrote that &quot;Although White has some advantage, Black has avoided instant loss.&quot;

==Fourth-move alternatives for Black==

===O&#x27;Kelly Defence: 4...c6 ===
Many sources recommend the O&#x27;Kelly Defence as a means of transposing to the Ziegler Defence while cutting out White&#x27;s 6.Bd3 possibility, since White has nothing better than 5.Bc4, when 5...exf3 6.Nxf3 Bf5 transposes directly to the 6.Bc4 Bf5 variation of the Ziegler Defence. Alternatively, 5.Nxe4 is likely to land White in an inferior version of the Fantasy Variation of the Caro–Kann Defence, with equality at best in positions that may not attract Blackmar–Diemer players, 5.fxe4 e5! is good for Black and other bishop moves allow Black to achieve superior versions of standard Blackmar–Diemer Gambit variations. 4...c6 also has some independent value, for example Evgeny Bareev used the continuation 5.f3 b5!? in a game against Nigel Short, achieving a superior position after 6.Bb3 Be6 7.fxe4 b4 8.Nce2 Nxe4, but 8.Na4!? improves for White and may give sufficient compensation for the pawn. Black can also try 5...Bf5, when White must play accurately to prove enough compensation, but probably obtains sufficient play after 6.g4 Bg6 7.g5 Nd5 8.fxe4 Nxc3 9.bxc3.

===Vienna Defence: 4...Bf5 ===
The Vienna Defence was recommended by Matthias Wahls in his book &quot;Modernes Skandinavisch&quot;, where he saw it as a refutation of the Blackmar–Diemer Gambit. White can play for compensation for a pawn with 5.fxe4 Nxe4 6.Qf3, when both 6...Nxc3 and 6...Nd6 lead to complicated positions in which Black often tries to return a pawn on b7 in order to catch up on development, and in some cases secure a positional advantage. White often does best to continue with a gambit policy and simply continue developing. The main line runs 6...Nd6 7.Bf4 e6 8.0-0-0 c6 9.g4 Bg6 10.Qe3 Be7, when Black is solid, but White retains enough compensation for the pawn. Alternatively, 5.g4 aims to regain the pawn in most cases, e.g. after 5...Bg6 6.g5 Nd5 7.Nxe4 Nc6 8.Bb5 e6 9.Bxc6+ bxc6 10.Ne2 c5 11.dxc5 Nb4, when in a reversal of roles, White has an extra pawn but Black has the initiative and a superior pawn structure. White can use 5.g4 as a gambit option by continuing with 6.h4!?, which leads to sharp play and approximately equal chances.

===Langeheinicke Defence: 4...e3 ===
The push with 4...e3 is often used by strong players to avoid the complications arising from 4...exf3 5.Nxf3, but it is one of Black&#x27;s weaker options against the Blackmar–Diemer as returning the pawn in this way does not significantly slow down White&#x27;s initiative, and thus Black struggles to fully equalize in this line. In most lines White must seek to place a knight on f4 (taking the sting out of ...Nd5) in order to secure an advantage.

==Third-move alternatives for Black==

===Lemberger Countergambit: 3...e5 ===
The Lemberger Countergambit is an important alternative, where Black counterattacks against the d4-pawn instead of defending the attacked e4-pawn. White can head for a drawish endgame with 4.dxe5, e.g. 4...Qxd1+ 5.Kxd1 Nc6 6.Nxe4 Nxe5, or 5.Nxd1 Nc6 6.Bf4, with equality and few winning chances for either side. Since these positions typically do not attract gambiteers, White often chooses a riskier response in order to generate winning chances, such as 4.Qh5, 4.Nge2 or 4.Nxe4. Both 4.Qh5 and 4.Nge2 are well met by 4...Nc6!, when Black has good chances of obtaining an advantage, while against 4.Nxe4 the most critical continuation is 4...Qxd4, when White can continue with either 5.Qe2 or 5.Bd3, with complications and some compensation for the pawn in either case, but it is unclear if it is enough.

===Other options for Black===
3...f5 is an important option for Black, since 4.f3 is well met by 4...e5!, with some advantage for Black. Instead White does better to prevent ...e5 with 4.Bf4, and then obtain compensation for a pawn with a subsequent f3. 3...Bf5 is well met by 4.f3, and if 4...exf3 then 5.Qxf3 attacking the bishop (thus Black may be better off transposing to the Vienna Defence with 4...Nf6). 3...c6 and 3...e6 transpose to the Caro–Kann Defence and French Defence respectively, and in the former case White can continue in Blackmar–Diemer Gambit style with 4.f3 or 4.Bc4 intending 5.f3 (which often transposes to the O&#x27;Kelly Defence). After 3...e6, however, White cannot easily force a Blackmar–Diemer Gambit type position as 4.f3 Bb4 (which also comes up via the French Rubinstein Variation) is very bad for White.

Another option for White is to play the Veresov Opening moves without 3.Bg5. If Black responds with the Alburt Defence after 1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Bf5 it can transpose into a type of BDG Zeller Defence after 3. e4 dxe4. A new line only recently mentioned in Tim Sawyer&#x27;s Blackmar–Diemer Books 5 and 8, is the Torning Gambit which occurs after 4. g4 Bg6 5. Qe2!? If Black gets greedy and captures 5...Qxd4, White gets a nice game after 6.Qb5+. Tim Sawyer&#x27;s books mention several games played by Richard Torning who originally played this gambit in the 1980s. A trap is Richard Torning (1809) – amol52 (1424) [D00] (bullet 18.12.2016): 1.d4 d5 2.Nc3 Bf5 3.e4 dxe4 4.g4 Bg6 5.Qe2 Qxd4 6.Qb5+!? Qd7 7.Qxb7 Qc6 8.Qc8#.

Gary Danelishen, author of &quot;The Final Theory of Chess&quot;, posted analysis of the Torning Variation online.

==Related gambit ideas==

Since Black can sidestep the BDG in several ways, BDG adherents have developed related gambits:
*1.d4 d5 2.e4 c6 (the Caro–Kann Defence) 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.f3 was invented by Philip Stuart Milner-Barry in 1932 and 4.Bc4 Nf6 (or Bf5) 5.f3 by Heinrich Von Hennig in 1920 and thus are older than Diemer&#x27;s idea.
*1.d4 d5 2.e4 e6 (the French Defense) 3.Be3 is the Alapin–Diemer Gambit; sometimes White plays the typical f2–f3 a bit later.
*1.d4 d5 2.e4 e6 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.f3 and 3...Nf6 4.Bg5 dxe4 5.f3 are very rare.
*1.d4 d5 2.e4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.a3 Bxc3+ 5.bxc3 dxe4 6.f3 is the Winckelmann–Reimer Gambit.
*1.d4 d5 2.e4 e6 3.c4 is the Diemer–Duhm Gambit (with common continuation 3...dxe4 4.Nc3 Nf6 5.f3) 
*1.d4 d5 2.e4 Nc6 (the Nimzowitsch Defence) 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.d5 may be followed by 5.f3 or 5.f4.
*1.d4 Nf6 2.f3 d5 (c5 may lead to a kind of Benoni) 3.e4 dxe4 4.Nc3 simply transposes.
*1.d4 Nf6 2.Nc3 d5 3.e4 Nxe4 is called the Hübsch Gambit.
*1.d4 d5 2.Nc3 Bf5 3.e4 dxe4 4.g4 Bg6 5.Qe2!? Torning Gambit
*1.d4 f5 2.e4 (the Staunton Gambit)
*1.f3 d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.Nc3 is the Gedult Gambit.
*1.e4 d5 2.d4 is also a surprising transposition against the Scandinavian Defense.
*(as Black) 1.d4 e5 2.dxe5 Nc6 3.Nf3 f6 4.exf6 Nxf6 is the Soller Gambit (a subvariation of the Englund Gambit) where Black plays a reversed form of BDG. 

The list is incomplete and transpositions abound.

<doc id="1049381" wikidata="Q1548238" url="?curid=1049381" title="Mediterranean Theater of Operations, United States Army">
<text>The Mediterranean Theater of Operations, United States Army (MTOUSA), originally called the North African Theater of Operations, United States Army (NATOUSA), was a military formation of the United States Army that supervised all U.S. Army forces which fought in North Africa and Italy during World War II.

United States Army operations in the theater began with Operation Torch, when Allied forces landed on the beaches of northwest Africa on 8 November 1942, and concluded in the Italian Alps some 31 months later, with the German surrender in Italy on 2 May 1945. For administrative purposes, U.S. components were responsible to Headquarters North African Theater of Operations, United States Army (NATOUSA), which was created 14 February 1943. NATOUSA was redesignated Mediterranean Theater of Operations, United States Army (MTOUSA), on 26 October 1944.

== Origins ==

Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ) was created on 12 September 1942 to launch Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa. At the time, this was within the boundaries of the European Theater of Operations, United States Army (ETOUSA). The initial Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the Allied (Expeditionary) Force, was Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark was deputy commander-in-chief. As Supreme Allied Commander, Eisenhower controlled the ground forces through Major General George S. Patton Jr, Major General Lloyd R. Fredendall, and British Lieutenant-General Sir Kenneth Anderson. The naval forces were commanded by British Admiral Sir Andrew Browne Cunningham, and the air forces by Air Marshal Sir William Welsh and Brigadier General James H. Doolittle.

== North African Theater of Operations ==
The North African Theater of Operations (NATO) included French Africa, Spain, Portugal and Italy. For administrative purposes, US forces were controlled by Headquarters North African Theater of Operations, United States Army (NATOUSA), which was activated in Algiers on 4 February 1943. Eisenhower commanded both the Allied Force and NATOUSA. The boundaries of NATOUSA were not the same as those of the Allied theater, and included all of French North Africa, Spain, Portugal, Austria and Switzerland.

Brigadier General Everett S. Hughes, who had been responsible for the logistical planning of Operation Torch at ETOUSA, arrived in North Africa on 12 February 1943 to become the deputy theater commander and commanding general of the Communications Zone. The three base sections, the Atlantic Base Section at Casablanca, the Mediterranean Base Section at Oran and the Eastern Base Section at Constantine, became part of the Services of Supply, North African Theater of Operations, United States Army (SOS NATOUSA), commanded by Major General Thomas B. Larkin, which was responsible for the logistical support of U.S. Army forces in the Mediterranean.

British General Sir Harold Alexander became commander of the British 18th Army Group, which was activated on 19 February 1943, and was responsible for the detailed planning and preparation, and the actual conduct, of combat operations. In effect, Alexander was the ground commander. Air forces were grouped under the Mediterranean Air Command under Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder, which became active the day before. This included the US Ninth and Twelfth Air Forces.
For the Allied invasion of Sicily, Alexander was appointed Eisenhower&#x27;s deputy commander in chief and responsible for ground warfare, while Cunningham and Tedder remained the naval and air commanders respectively. Having overseen the early stages of the Italian Campaign, Eisenhower left AFHQ on 8 January 1944 and returned to England to assume command of the forces assembling for Operation Overlord, codename for the Allied landings in Northwest Europe. He was succeeded as Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean by British General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson. Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers became Wilson&#x27;s Deputy Supreme Commander and also the commanding general of NATOUSA.

Operation Dragoon, the Allied landings in Southern France, was conducted by the Mediterranean Theater. An advance echelon of SOS NATOUSA was organized in Italy and arrived at Dijon on 12 September to control the Delta Base Section and Continental Advance Section (CONAD). SOS NATOUSA became Communications Zone (COMZONE) NATOUSA on 1 October, Lieutenant General Joseph T. McNarney succeeded Devers as the Deputy Commander of NATOUSA on 22 October, allowing Devers to devote all his time and energy to running the 6th Army Group in France. The 6th Army Group was activated on 1 August, and it became operational in France on 15 September.

NATOUSA was redesignated Mediterranean Theater of Operations, United States Army (MTOUSA), on 1 November 1944, and no longer had any responsibilities in Southern France. MTOUSA boundaries were considerably diminished (on the north) from those of NATOUSA, and U.S. Army forces in southern France passed to the administrative control of ETOUSA. The forces in Southern France had their own line of communications from MTOUSA, but by February 1945 the integration of the Southern Line of Communications (SOLOC) with ETO Communications Zone had progressed to the point where the SOLOC headquarters was superfluous, and SOLOC was abolished on 6 February 1945.

Wilson remained Supreme Allied Commander for just under a year, until 21 November 1944, when he was sent to Washington to head of the British Joint Staff Mission, a position rendered vacant by the death of Field Marshal Sir John Dill on 4 November 1944. Wilson was succeeded by Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander, who remained until the end of the war.

Headquarters MTOUSA and General Headquarters CMF formally separated from AFHQ on 1 October 1945, leaving AFHQ to consist of a small interallied staff responsible for combined command liquidation activities and commanded by British Lieutenant General Sir William Duthie Morgan as Supreme Allied Commander Mediterranean. AFHQ was abolished, effective 17 September 1947, by General Order 24, AFHQ, 16 September 1947. McNarney was succeeded as Deputy Theater Commander and Ccommanding general MTOUSA by Lieutenant General Matthew B. Ridgway, who in turned was succeeded in December 1945 by Lieutenant General John C. H. Lee, who commanded through 1946 and 1947.

The Africa-Middle East Theater of Operations was &quot;established on March 1, 1945, was mainly concerned with the liquidation of the Army&#x27;s property holdings and other interests in Africa, Palestine, and the Persian Gulf area. The North African installations of the Mediterranean Theater and its base commands at Casablanca were transferred to the new Theater in March 1945; the United States Army Forces in Liberia were transferred to it in April 1945.&quot; &quot;The United States Army Forces in Liberia were subsequently under the North African Service Command, which was the former Mediterranean Base Section, at Casablanca. By 1946 all [the Town Commands] except the agency at Casablanca were discontinued.&quot;

<text>In linguistics, branching refers to the shape of the parse trees that represent the structure of sentences. Assuming that the language is being written or transcribed from left to right, parse trees that grow down and to the right are &quot;right-branching&quot;, and parse trees that grow down and to the left are &quot;left-branching&quot;. The direction of branching reflects the position of heads in phrases, and in this regard, right-branching structures are &quot;head-initial&quot;, whereas left-branching structures are &quot;head-final&quot;. English has both right-branching (head-initial) and left-branching (head-final) structures, although it is more right-branching than left-branching. Some languages such as Japanese and Turkish are almost fully left-branching (head-final). Some languages are mostly right-branching (head-initial).

==Examples==
Languages typically construct phrases with a head word (or nucleus) and zero or more &quot;dependents&quot; (modifiers). The following phrases show the phrase heads in bold. 

Examples of left-branching phrases (= head-final phrases):
::the house 
::very happy 
::too slowly 

Examples of right-branching phrases (= head-initial phrases):
::laugh loudly 
::with luck 
::that it happened 

Examples of phrases that contain both left- and right-branching (= head-medial phrases):
::the house there 
::very happy with it 
::only laugh loudly 

Concerning phrases such as &quot;the house&quot; and &quot;the house there&quot;, this article assumes the traditional NP analysis, meaning that the noun is deemed to be head over the determiner. On a DP-analysis (determiner phrase), the phrase &quot;the house&quot; would be right-branching instead of left-branching.

==Tree structures==
Left- and right-branching structures are illustrated with the trees that follow. Each example appears twice, once according to a constituency-based analysis associated with a phrase structure grammar and once according to a dependency-based analysis associated with a dependency grammar. The first group of trees illustrate left-branching:

The upper row shows the constituency-based structures, and the lower row the dependency-based structures. In the constituency-based structures, left-branching is present (but not really visible) in so far as the non-head daughter is to the left of the head. In the corresponding dependency-based structures in the lower row, the left-branching is clear; the dependent appears to the left of its head, the branch extending down to the left. The following structures demonstrate right-branching:

The upper row again shows the constituency-based structures, and the lower row the dependency-based structures. The constituency-based structures are right-branching insofar as the non-head daughter is to the right of the head. This right-branching is completely visible in the lower row of dependency-based structures, where the branch extends down to the right. The (c)-examples contain one instance of right-branching (the upper branch) and one instance of left-branching (the lower branch). The following trees illustrate phrases that combine both types of branching:

The combination of left- and right-branching is now completely visible in both the constituency- and dependency-based trees. The head appears in a medial position, which means that the phrase combines both types of branching. Note that the (b)-trees also contain a prepositional phrase that is an instance of pure right-branching.

==Full trees==
The nature of branching is most visible with full trees. The following trees have been chosen to illustrate the extent to which a structure can be entirely left- or entirely right-branching. The following sentence is completely left-branching. The constituency-based trees are on the left, and the dependency-based trees are on the right: 

The category Po (= possessive) is used to label possessive &quot;&#x27;s&quot;. The following sentence is completely right-branching:

Most structures in English are, however, not completely left- or completely right-branching, but rather they combine both. The following trees illustrate what can be seen as a stereotypical combination of left- and right-branching in English:

Determiners (e.g. &quot;the&quot;) always and subjects (e.g. &quot;the child&quot;) usually appear on left branches in English, but infinitival verbs (e.g. &quot;try&quot;, &quot;eat&quot;) and the verb particle &quot;to&quot; usually appear on right branches. In the big picture, right-branching structures tend to outnumber the left-branching structures in English, which means that trees usually grow down to the right.

==X-bar schema==
The X-bar schema combines left- and right-branching. The standard X-bar schema has the following structure:

This structure is both left- and right branching. It is left-branching insofar as the bar-level projection of the head (X&#x27;) follows the specifier, but it is right-branching insofar as the actual head (X0) precedes the complement. Despite these conflicting traits, most standard X-bar structures (in English) are more right-branching than left-branching because specifiers tend to be less complex (i.e. fewer words) than complements.

==Binary vs. n-ary branching==
Much work in Government and Binding Theory (GB), the Minimalist Program (MP), and Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) assumes all branching to be binary. Other theories (both constituency- and dependency-based ones), e.g. early Transformational Grammar, Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, Meaning-Text Theory, Word Grammar, etc. allow for n-ary branching. This distinction can have a profound impact on the overall nature of the theory of syntax. The two main possibilities in a phrase structure grammar are illustrated with the following trees:

The binary branching on the left is closely associated with the structures of GB, MP, and LFG, and it is similar to what the X-bar schema assumes. The n-ary branching structure on the right is a more traditional approach to branching. One can muster arguments for both approaches. For instance, the critics of the strictly binary branching structures charge that the strict binarity is motivated more by a desire for theoretical purity than by empirical observation.

Strictly binary branching structures increase the amount of syntactic structure (number of nodes) to the upper limit of what is possible, whereas flatter n-ary branching tends to restrict the amount of structure that the theory can assume. Worth noting in this area is that the more layered the syntactic structures are, the more discontinuities can occur, which means the component of the theory that addresses discontinuities must play a greater role. Given the flatter structures associated with n-ary branching, certain phenomena (e.g. inversion and shifting) do not result in discontinuities, a fact that reduces the role that the component for discontinuities must play in the theory.

==Tendencies==
As stated above, the main branching trait for a language is just a tendency and it often shows exceptions. Spanish, for example, while overwhelmingly right-branching, puts numeral modifiers before nouns and, in certain cases, objects before verbs. Languages like English or Swedish, though regarded as being right-branching because the main verbs precede direct objects, place adjectives and numerals before their nouns. On the contrary, Northwest Caucasian languages such as Ubykh or Abkhaz are strongly left-branching but put adjectives after nouns. 

Some languages, however, are exclusively left-branching or right-branching. Japanese and most other languages of northeastern Asia and the Indian subcontinent, as well as the Turkic languages, are practically a model for rigidly left-branching languages. The Mon–Khmer and Austronesian languages of southeast Asia and many African languages come close to rigidly right-branching, with numerals as well as adjectives following their nouns and with degree words like &quot;very&quot;, &quot;too&quot;, &quot;extremely&quot;, and &quot;quite&quot; following the adjectives they modify.

<doc id="1049398" wikidata="Q1568956" url="?curid=1049398" title="Violet Florence Martin">
<text>Violet Florence Martin (11 June 1862 – 21 December 1915) was an Irish author who co-wrote a series of novels with cousin Edith Somerville under the pen name of Martin Ross (Somerville and Ross) in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

== Early life ==

Martin was born at Ross House in Connemara, County Galway, the youngest of sixteen children of James Martin of Ross (1804–1872). The Martin family, a branch of the Martyn family - one of the Tribes of Galway - had settled at Ross by the early seventeenth century, having previously inhabited the town of Galway for some three hundred years. Her father, James, was a Protestant, his grandfather having converted from the Catholic faith in order to retain the family estates under the Penal Laws. Nevertheless, each child of the family was secretly &#x27;baptised&#x27; by the family servants, a practice James Martin winked at.

She was a kinswoman of Richard Martin and her contemporary, Edward Martyn, two other notable members of the tribe. Her older brother, Robert Jasper Martin, was a noted songwriter and a well-regarded member of the Tory party in London. She shared a great-grandmother with the writer Maria Edgeworth, whose use of Irish vernacular speech she followed in her work.

Her father had managed to save both his estate and his tenants during the Great Famine - boasting that not one of his people died during the disaster - but at the cost of bankruptcy. Following his death in 1872, the family moved to Dublin and only returned to Ross in 1888 following revelations of financial fraud of the estate by their agent.

== Writings and companionship with Edith Somerville ==
Violet Martin and Edith Somerville were second cousins. They originally met on 17 January 1886 at Castletownshend, after which they became lifelong companions and literary partners. They came to share a home in Drishane, County Cork. In 1889, Violet adopted the pseudonym Martin Ross, which comprised her surname and the name of her ancestral home; thus the authors were called Somerville and Ross. Their works included &quot;The Real Charlotte&quot; (1889), &quot;Some Reminiscences of an Irish R.M.&quot; and &quot;In The Vine Country&quot;. The precise nature of their relationship — whether they were romantic and sexual partners as well as literary collaborators and friends — has been the object of speculation by later writers.

==Political and cultural outlook==
Martin was a convinced Irish unionist, in opposition to Somerville&#x27;s open nationalism. Both she and her brother Robert were well-regarded members of the literary circle in Irish unionism. However, unlike her brother, Martin was a convinced suffragette, becoming vice-president of the Munster Women&#x27;s Franchise League. While on friendly terms with the leading members of the Gaelic literary revival such as W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory, she objected to their romantic version of Irish peasantry. She was on good terms with Edward Martyn, partner of Gregory and Yeats - and her kinsman - and shared his love of the Irish language and culture.

==Later years==
Violet was seriously injured in a riding accident in November 1898, from which she never fully recovered. This was a contributing factor to her death in Drishane, County Cork, in 1915. Edith Somerville continued to write under their joint literary names, claiming that they were still in contact. The two women left thousands of letters and 116 volumes of diaries, detailing their lives, much of them yet unpublished. Edith died at Castletownshend in October 1949, aged 91, and is buried alongside Violet Florence Martin at Saint Barrahane&#x27;s Church, Castletownsend, County Cork, Ireland. There is a joint memorial to them there.

She was awarded a posthumous D.Litt. by Trinity College Dublin.

<doc id="1049411" wikidata="Q2744669" url="?curid=1049411" title="Hawkhurst">
<text>Hawkhurst is a village and civil parish in the borough of Tunbridge Wells in Kent, England. The village is located close to the border with East Sussex, around south-east of Royal Tunbridge Wells and within the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

Hawkhurst is virtually two villages: The Moor, to the south, consists mainly of cottages clustered around a large triangular green, while Highgate, to the north, features a colonnade of independent shops, two country pubs, hotels, a digital cinema in a converted lecture hall, and Waitrose and Tesco supermarkets.

There are four designated conservation areas in Hawkhurst parish – one at Sawyers Green, two in Highgate (Highgate and All Saints&#x27; Church) and one at The Moor. There are also over 200 listed buildings across the parish.

Since boundary changes in the 2010 general election, Hawkhurst is part of the parliamentary constituency of Tunbridge Wells, represented by Conservative Greg Clark. Prior to this it was in the Maidstone and The Weald constituency, formerly represented by Ann Widdecombe.

== Transport ==

=== Roads ===
Hawkhurst (Kent) lies at the intersection of the A229 and A268 (see map). The village lies on the route of a Roman road which crossed the Weald here.

=== Railway ===

A railway station was built in Hawkhurst in 1892, to the west side of the Cranbrook Road, on the northern edge of the village. It was rarely busy except during hop picking time, when up to 26 special trains per day, each carrying up to 350 Cockneys from London, would arrive at Hawkhurst – up to 10,000 people per day. As this declined, the station became uneconomic, and it was closed in 1961.

The station site is now an industrial area just off the Cranbrook Road, but some original buildings are still standing and in a good state of preservation. The nearest open station is now Etchingham.

=== Buses ===
Hawkhurst is served by the Stagecoach South East bus routes 254, 304 and 349. These provide connections to Tunbridge Wells, Wadhurst, Robertsbridge, Battle, Bodiam and Hastings. The village is also served by the Arriva Southern Counties route 5 to Sandhurst, Staplehurst and Maidstone.

Hawkhurst has over 1,000 years of recorded history. The oldest known settlement was the Saxon manor of Congehurst, which was burnt by the Danes in 893 AD. There is still a lane of this name to the east of the village. At the time of the Domesday Book in 1096, the parish was mainly in the Lathe of Wye.

The ancient parish of Hawkhurst straddles the boundaries of four hundreds, including three that by 1295 were parts of the south of the Lathe of Scray in East Kent. The western portion of the parish of Hawkhurst was the entirety of the hundred of Great Barnfield (or East Barnfield). The eastern portion of the parish was partially in the hundred of Cranbrook and the hundred of Selbrittenden. Some acreage of the eastern portion was also in the hundred of Henhurst in the Rape of Hastings, East Sussex.

=== Etymology ===

The name Hawkhurst is derived from Old English &quot;heafoc hyrst&quot;, meaning a wooded hill frequented by hawks – &#x27;Hawk Wood&#x27;. Hurst (Hyrst) in a place name refers to a wood or wooded area – there are several in West Kent and East Sussex. The 11th-century &quot;Domesday Monachorum&quot; refers to the village as &quot;Hawkashyrst&quot;, belonging to Battle Abbey. In 1254, the name was recorded as &quot;Hauekehurst&quot;; in 1278, it is often shown as &quot;Haukhurst&quot;; by 1610, it had changed to &quot;Hawkherst&quot;, which then evolved into the current spelling.

=== Iron industry ===

The village is located towards the Eastern end of the Weald, where iron has been produced from Roman times. The Weald produced over a third of all iron in Britain, and over 180 sites have been found across the Weald. Ironstone was taken from clay beds, then heated with charcoal from the abundant woods in the area. The iron was used to make everything from Roman ships to medieval cannon, and many of the Roman roads in the area were built to transport the iron. William Penn, founder of the state of Pennsylvania, is erroneously claimed to have owned ironworks at Hawkhurst. The industry eventually declined during the industrial revolution of the 18th Century, when coal became the preferred method of heating, and could not be found nearby.

=== Hop growing ===
In the 14th century, Edward III, wanting to break the Flemish (Dutch) monopoly on weaving, encouraged Flemish weavers to come to England. Many chose to settle in the Weald, because it had all the elements needed for weaving – oak to make mills, streams to drive them, and fuller&#x27;s earth to treat the cloth.

The Kentish domination of the hop industry was stimulated by that same influx of Flemish weavers, who brought with them a taste for beer, and beer making skills. Several wealthy Kentish farmers invested in this new opportunity and approach. Although not the centre of the industry, Hawkhurst Brewery and Malthouse was built in 1850, on the edge of Hawkhurst Moor (now a house).

Hop growing also gave the area its distinctive skyline of hop gardens and oast houses, which were used to dry the hops. Nowadays, most hops are imported. However, at its peak of hop gardens existed in England, almost all of them in Kent, including much around Hawkhurst. Eventually mechanisation and cheap imports ended the industry, but the oast houses remain.

=== The Hawkhurst Gang ===

A witness before a 1745 Committee of Enquiry estimated there were 20,000 smugglers operating in Britain at that time. An infamous group, the &quot;Holkhourst Genge&quot;, terrorised the surrounding area between 1735 and 1749. They were the most notorious of the Kent gangs, and were feared all along the south coast of England. At Poole in Dorset, where they had launched an armed attack on the customs house (to take back a consignment of tea that had been confiscated), several were hanged including Thomas Kingsmill, one of the gang&#x27;s leaders.

A number of inns and local houses in Hawkhurst claim associations with the gang: high taxation on luxury goods in the early 18th century had led to an upsurge in smuggling, and the gang brought in brandy, silk and tobacco up from Rye and Hastings to be stowed away in hidden cellars and passages, before being sold off to the local gentry. It was reputed that when needed for a smuggling run, 500 mounted and armed men could be assembled within the hour. The Battle of Goudhurst eventually brought their career to an end.

== Notable buildings==

In 1886, the largest Barnardo&#x27;s home for orphans under six years old was built in Hawkhurst, caring for hundreds of babies. It was known as Babies&#x27; Castle, and followed nine inspiring principles, known as &quot;The Nine Nos&quot;:

:# No destitute child refused
:# No Race Barrier
:# No Creed Clause
:# No Physical Disability
:# No Age Limit
:# No Money Promise
:# No Voting
:# No Waiting
:# No Red Tape

Unfortunately, the building stood neglected for many years and was eventually redeveloped into a care home for the elderly, Hawkhurst House, in 2017.

In 1903 Gunther and his wife Leonie bought the Tongswood Estate. When he died in 1935, the house, dating from the 1860s, was sold and became St Ronan&#x27;s School. Earlier owners of Tongswood were the Dunks family, who lived there from about 1500–1750. Sir Thomas Dunk, a wealthy clothier, who died in 1718, bequeathed enough money to build almshouses for six &#x27;decayed housekeepers&#x27; (three men and three women) and a village school, plus enough money to buy lands to generate a steady income.

In 1875, the Victoria Lecture Hall was built by Henry Maynard &quot;for the good of the village&quot;. It now houses Kino, a digital cinema.

===Churches===
Hawkhurst has several churches. The parish church of St Laurence stands at the south end of the village known as The Moor, which is the older part of Hawkhurst. It falls within the Diocese of Canterbury, and has as patron the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church, Oxford. It is likely that a church has stood on this site since 1100, or even earlier. After the Battle of Hastings William I gave the Manor of Wye, with rights over a large part of the parish, to the Abbot of Battle. The first mention of the church is in the charter of 1285, and its first rector was Richard de Clyne in 1291. The Chancel and North Chapel are the oldest parts of the church. The Great East Window was built about 1350 and has been described as one of the finest pieces of architecture in the country. Most of the rest of the church dates from around 1450, when the nave was lengthened and raised, the aisles, porches and tower added, and it took on its present appearance. The room over the North porch was used by Battle Abbey officials for rent collecting, and used to be called &quot;The Treasury&quot;. In 1574, communion rails were introduced at a cost of 53 shillings, to keep communicants from the altar, the first parish church in England to have done so.

In 1944 a German flying bomb fell in the churchyard, causing considerable damage, and the church was put out of action until 1957. Part of the flying bomb can be seen on the south side at the back of the church.

There is a Roman Catholic church in the High Street, dedicated to St Barnabas, but, apart from Sunday, services are now held at the sister church in Goudhurst. An active Baptist Church is in Cranbrook Road, built partly on the site of the original Rootes cycle factory. A Methodist church on Highgate Hill is now being converted to a domestic dwelling: the congregation now holds services in Dunk&#x27;s Almshouses. 

All Saints&#x27; Church, Rye Road was a former chapel of ease for St Laurence&#x27;s at Highgate. Built in 1861 by Sir George Gilbert Scott, the Church sits on the Highgate ridge with its spire visible from some distance. Grade II listed, the property is a local landmark that sat derelict for over two decades, but has now been sympathetically restored and converted into a number of private apartments.

===Hospital===
Hawkhurst Community Hospital (formerly the Cottage Hospital) provides 22 beds for patients who do not need to be in an acute hospital.

== Education ==

Hawkhurst is home to three schools, one local authority primary and two independent preparatory schools.
* Hawkhurst CofE Primary School
* Marlborough House School
* St. Ronan&#x27;s School

== Notable residents ==

The 19th-century astronomer Sir John Herschel (1792–1871) lived in Hawkhurst for thirty years. It was he who named the four moons of Uranus, the planet which had been discovered by his father, Sir William Herschel. He was also a mentor and inspiration to a young Charles Darwin. Herschel lived at Collingwood House in Hawkhurst.

Richard Kilburne, born in London to a Kentish family, was a lawyer and historian. He died at Hawkhurst on 16 November 1678, at age 74. Kilburne is buried in the chancel of the church at Hawkhurst under a flat stone inscribed with Latin declaring him &quot;an ornament and an honor to his country.&quot;

Hawkhurst was the birthplace of the Rootes car empire.

Another leading local businessman was Charles Eugene Gunther, head of the Liebig Meat Extract Company, later known as Oxo. He was also Lord Lieutenant of Kent in 1926.

Philip Langridge, the 20th-century operatic tenor, was born in Hawkhurst.

<text>Deurne () is the second largest district of the municipality of Antwerp, Belgium, (right after the Antwerp town district) and has 82,270 inhabitants (2023).

Deurne is best known for its green environment with the biggest park in Antwerp Rivierenhof.

== History ==

=== Ancien régime ===

Deurne was said to be the place where the Irish missionary Fredigand was abbot of Kerkelodor Abbey in the eighth century.
There are indications that Deurne existed in prehistoric and Roman times but the first tangible proof of Deurne only dates back to 1185.
During the Ancien régime Deurne was nothing more than part of the Eastern hinterland of Antwerp. Like many dwellings it settled on the crossroads of a river (the Schijn) and a connection route (the &#x27;Turnhoutse baan&#x27;: the road from Antwerp to Turnhout).

Deurne consisted mainly of sparsely populated farmland. However, as a direct result of the increasing wealth of the Antwerp population, many aristocratic estates were erected (the so-called &quot;Hof van Plaisantie&quot; was a specific rural estate, a bourgeois version of a château or country house). Typically, merchants, diplomats, wealthy artists (like Peter Paul Rubens f.i.) would escape to their Hof van Plaisantie. Some country houses in Deurne were : Sterckshof, Papenhof, Lakbors, Bisschoppenhof, Gallifort, Inkborsch, Bosuil, Ertbrugge &amp; Venneborg. Although most country houses were destroyed over the centuries (especially in 1542), some like Sterckxhof or Bisschoppenhof survived. Further surviving evidence of this aristocratic history of Deurne is the St Fredegand Church and the adjacent cemetery (the St-Fredegandusbegraafpark).

=== Nineteenth century ===
After the battle of Waterloo William of Orange started to connect the Antwerp port with its hinterland through the construction of a series of canals between Antwerp and Liège, connecting the Scheldt with the Maas. The work, started under his reign in 1823, was completed in 1874.

The effect of this canal was to establish a permanent barrier north of Deurne (where the Kleine Schijn used to flow), separating it from Merksem. In the south the Grote Schijn would form the south barrier of Deurne. The effect of both barriers was to enhance an &#x27;island feeling&#x27; for Deurne. This was further promoted by the establishment of the Brialmont fortifications around Antwerp. Deurne was split apart and the western part of Deurne (Borgerhout) was to become a separate municipality. The rest of Deurne now lay outside the enceinte and became physically and mentally more separated from Antwerp.

=== Modern times ===
Because of the barriers constructed in the nineteenth century, urbanization would only begin in the twentieth century. Many large scale urban functions were &#x27;dropped&#x27; in the undestined area previously occupied by the Brialmont-fortifications (like the event hall Sportpaleis Merksem). Urban planning started in 1913 and although the original plan was never fully realised it did determine the spatial structure of Deurne.

A real demographic explosion happened because of this urban planning and the need for many Antwerp residents to find modern housing. The population grew from 15,432 in 1920 to 52,303 in 1935.

World War II halted this evolution, mainly because of the V-2 bombardments. After 1945 the growth of Deurne started again and in the 1960s social housing &amp; other community projects further enhanced this new urban identity of Deurne.

From 1972 onward Deurne was subject to the urban exodus and the urban sprawl whereby people moved from the dense urban centres towards the suburbs. As a result, the population began to diminish in numbers and the remaining population became older.

In 1983 Deurne was absorbed into the municipality of Greater Antwerp (see : Antwerp) whereby Deurne became one of the 9 districts. In 2001 Antwerp was decentralised, Deurne once again has its own elected council, not a city council but a district council, not a mayor but a &#x27;chairman of the district governing board&#x27;...

== Major attractions ==
Deurne has one of the oldest still functioning airports in the world, established in 1923. Antwerp Airport is a regional airport with only a limited number of flights a day.
Located at the airport is the Stampe &amp; Vertongen Museum, at the location of the old aircraft production company of the same name.

== Politics ==

=== District college ===

The members of the district college between Januari 1, 2019 and 31 December 2024 are:
=== District council ===
The district council of Deurne has a total of 29 seats. De district council chairman is Frank Geudens (SP.A).

== Notable people ==

*Erik Van Looy, film director and TV quiz presenter
*An Pierlé, musician
*Björn Leukemans, cyclist
*Pascal Struijk, footballer (born 1999)
*Peter Renkens, Belgian singer, frontman of Confetti&#x27;s

== Economy ==
VLM Airlines has its head office on the grounds of Antwerp International Airport in Deurne; the office is also CityJet&#x27;s Antwerp office.

<text>Farsi Island () is a tiny, barren Iranian island (Bushehr province) in the Persian Gulf. There is an IRGC Navy base on this island. The island has an area of about and is restricted from the public. The center of Farsi Island is located at latitude 27° 59&#x27; 36&quot; N and longitude 50° 10&#x27; 22&quot; E. Its maximum elevation is . The word &quot;Farsi&quot; means &quot;Persian&quot;.

In the late 1980s, during the &quot;Tanker War&quot; phase of the Iran–Iraq War, the IRGC used speedboats to launch attacks from Farsi Island on vessels of Iraq and its allies, including Kuwait. The United States entered the Persian gulf to protect Kuwaiti oil shipments. Iran planted naval mines near Farsi Island on the route of the first convoy, consisting of US navy vessels escorting the Kuwaiti oil tanker &quot;Bridgeton,&quot; which hit one of the mines.

On January 12, 2016, Iranian Revolutionary Guards forces stationed on the island apprehended two small vessels and their 10 U.S. Navy sailors after the latter entered Iranian waters. The incident prompted talks between the Iranian Foreign Ministry and the U.S. State Department regarding their release. All 10 sailors and their vessels were released the following morning.

<doc id="1049426" wikidata="Q112404" url="?curid=1049426" title="Brookville Equipment">
<text>Brookville Equipment Corporation, based in Brookville, Pennsylvania, United States, manufactures railroad locomotives for industrial and light capacity switching needs. The company also builds and restores streetcars. The company used to be known as Brookville Locomotive Company.

==History==
The company began in 1918 by installing flanged railroad wheels on Ford trucks (Road–rail vehicle). The company soon began building gasoline-powered locomotives of their own following World War I. Brookville&#x27;s locomotives were the first to include planetary drive axles rather than chain drives.

== Products ==

In 2007, BEC unveiled its CoGeneration locomotives with up to , generated through the use of three low-emission diesel engines. The use of three clean-burning EPA Tier-3 engines offers a &quot;Power on Demand&quot; feature where engines come on-line as power needs are realized. This feature reduces emissions and fuel consumption. Individual water-cooled IGBT electronic switches for each traction motor improves rail adhesion.

Brookville manufactures equipment used in mining, tunneling, and industrial and switching applications. In 2008, Brookville built its first road switchers for the Metro-North Railroad. The locomotives are given the model designation of BL20-GH.

BEC&#x27;s Railwalker re-railing devices can also put its locomotives back on-track without the risk of injury to the operator.

===Streetcars===
The company began manufacturing trucks for streetcars in 2003 – for use in vintage-style cars being newly built by the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority – and since 2002 it has had a streetcar division, working mainly on restoration, refurbishment and remanufacturing of existing streetcars. The first such contract was one to rebuild 18 PCC streetcars for SEPTA Route 15 in Philadelphia. The cars, known as PCC IIs, entered service in 2005. Later work has included restoring PCC cars for use on San Francisco Municipal Railway&#x27;s F Market &amp; Wharves line and manufacturing replicas of 1923 Perley Thomas streetcars for New Orleans.

On September 14, 2011, Brookville announced plans to develop a low-floor, articulated tram. The design was later named the &quot;Liberty&quot; model, and features the ability to operate away from the overhead electric power wires for a limited distance, using batteries. In early 2013, the company received a $9.4-million order for two Liberty streetcars from Dallas Area Rapid Transit. They are for Dallas&#x27;s new Dallas Streetcar, which opened for public service on April 13, 2015. The company also built a pair of replica &quot;Red Car Trolley&quot; streetcars for Disney California Adventure in 2012.

===Recent rail products===

==== 2008 ====
Metro-North Railroad ordered 10 BL20GH units, numbers 110-115 in Metro North paint and numbers 125-130 ordered for Connecticut Department of Transportation, painted in New Haven scheme. The order also includes two multi-engine CoGeneration locomotives for MTA Capital and four (115ton) locomotives for the Staten Island Railway. The SIR locomotives are known as BL20G.

<doc id="1049434" wikidata="Q220304" url="?curid=1049434" title="Zoomorphism">
<text>The word &quot;zoomorphism&quot; derives from and . In the context of art, zoomorphism could describe art that imagines humans as non-human animals. It can also be defined as art that portrays one species of animal like another species of animal or art that uses animals as a visual motif, sometimes referred to as &quot;animal style&quot;. Depicting deities in animal form (theriomorphism) is an example of zoomorphism in a religious context. It is also similar to the term therianthropy; which is the ability to shape shift into animal form, except that with zoomorphism the animal form is applied to a physical object. It means to attribute animal forms or animal characteristics to other animals, or things other than an animal; similar to but broader than anthropomorphism. Contrary to anthropomorphism, which views animal or non-animal behavior in human terms, zoomorphism is the tendency of viewing human behavior in terms of the behavior of animals. It is also used in literature to portray the act of humans or objects with animalistic behavior or features. The use of zoomorphism served as a decorative element to objects that are typically quite simple in shape and design.
==Examples==

===Zoomorphic representation in religion===
*The appearance of the Holy Spirit like a dove in the New Testament (The Gospel According to Luke 3: 22), &quot;and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove...&quot; 

*Mark the Evangelist as a lion in later Christian iconography. 
* In Hinduism Vishnu&#x27;s vahana Garuda is depicted as an eagle or kite or with half kite and half human body.
* The Egyptian gods were often depicted as zoomorphic or as hybrid.
* The names of the two most prominent Hebrew Bible female prophets – Deborah and Huldah – were in the Babylonian Talmud interpreted in zoomorphic terms as &quot;wasp&quot; and &quot;weasel&quot;.
* Zoomorphic and anthropomorphic letters were used in some religious manuscripts, such as the Kennicott Bible.

===Zoomorphic language for things, ideas===
*A literary phrase such as &quot;The roar of the ocean&quot;.
*Waterwolf, a Dutch terminology for the tendency of bodies of water in low-lying land to grow larger over time, causing death, loss of livestock and loss of land.
*Sin lurking like a beast waiting to devour Cain in Genesis.

===Humanity portrayed in evolutionary context===

Desmond Morris in The Naked Ape and The Human Zoo, Robert Ardrey in African Genesis and Konrad Lorenz in On Aggression all wrote from a sociobiological perspective. They viewed the human species as an animal, subject to the evolutionary law of Survival of the fittest through adaptation to the biophysical environment.

=== Zoomorphic representation in Islamic art ===

One example of a zoomorphic object is the incense burner of Amir Saif al-Dunya wa’l-Din ibn Muhammad al-Mawardi, today located at the Metropolitan Museum in New York&quot;.&quot; Incense burners were common objects for zoomorphic forms that served as a container for aromatic material to be burned. This particular object comes from the Seljuq period in Iran. It is made of bronze, meaning it was a more expensive object as metalwork incense burners cost more to produce and were less common than other productions made of clay or soft stones. The work is meant to depict a lion or large cat. The artist plays with the anatomical elements of the body to fit the use for burning incense. Around the base of neck shows the area where the head is designed to be removed for the insertion of coal and incense. Throughout the body small holes were punctured for the release of the smoke. This object would have been found in a domestic space due to the animal-like imagery.
Another example of zoomorphism in Islamic art is the bird-shaped oil lamp, located at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The oil lamp would have been used as an everyday object in a domestic space as well. The handle of the lamp is depicted by the head and neck of the bird. The body takes the form of the base of the lamp where oil can be poured in the small opening. The artist uses the form of the bird to utilize the lamp either hanging or resting. There are keyholes on either side of the body for the lamp to be hung by a chain and the flat base allows for the lamp to be placed on any smooth surface. The similarities between the incense burner and the lamp demonstrate how zoomorphism was used throughout Islamic culture.

Zoomorphism appears on objects beyond household items. An example of this is the Dagger with Zoomorphic Hilt also located at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York&quot;.&quot; The hilt or handle of the dagger merges into the shape of a dragon attacking a lion who is performing the same act onto a deer. Each attacking animal is connected by its claws and teeth to form the handle. The inclusion of Persian and Indian symbols of power was common in zoomorphic imagery on hilts of daggers. In this dagger there is a figure of a bird in front of the deer who is meant to represent the Indian deity Garuda. Due to the intricate design and craftsmanship of this dagger, it would most likely not have been used for the purposes of a weapon, but rather as a ceremonial object. Many of the weapons included in Islamic art served as symbols for power and wealth.

*Fenrisulfr, a wolf in Norse mythology
*Airavata, the king god of elephants in Indian mythology.
* Paw feet bathtub, with feet in the shape of a lion&#x27;s paws
* The sphinx from Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;
* Elephantine Colossus, a hotel
* Aslan in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; is a lion that is the king of Narnia
* Robotic pets, like AIBO, modeled on dogs or other animals
* In 2010 city planners from Southern Sudan, which would become independent a year later, unveiled plans for the city center of its capital, Juba, to be built in the shape of a rhinoceros. The city of Wau was to be transformed in the shape of a giraffe.

<doc id="1049435" wikidata="Q275793" url="?curid=1049435" title="Nancy Cunard">
<text>Nancy Clara Cunard (10 March 1896 – 17 March 1965) was a British writer, heiress and political activist. She was born into the British upper class, and devoted much of her life to fighting racism and fascism. She became a muse to some of the 20th century&#x27;s most distinguished writers and artists, including Wyndham Lewis, Aldous Huxley, Tristan Tzara, Ezra Pound and Louis Aragon—who were among her lovers—as well as Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Constantin Brâncuși, Langston Hughes, Man Ray and William Carlos Williams. MI5 documents reveal that she was involved with Indian diplomat, orator, and statesman V. K. Krishna Menon.

In later years she suffered from mental illness, and her physical health deteriorated. When she died in the Hôpital Cochin, Paris, she weighed only .

==1910s==
Cunard&#x27;s father was Sir Bache Cunard, an heir to the Cunard Line shipping businesses, interested in polo and fox hunting, and a baronet. Her mother was Maud Alice Burke, an American heiress, who adopted the first name Emerald and became a leading London society hostess. Nancy had been brought up on the family estate at Nevill Holt, Leicestershire. When her parents separated in 1911, she moved to London with her mother. Her education was at various boarding schools, including time in France and Germany.

In London, she spent a good deal of her childhood with her mother&#x27;s long-time admirer, the novelist George Moore. It was even rumoured that Moore was her father, and although this has been largely dismissed, there is no question that he played an important role in her life while she was growing up. She would later write a memoir about her affection for &quot;GM&quot;.

On 15November 1916 she married Sydney Fairbairn, a cricketer and army officer who had been wounded at Gallipoli. After a honeymoon in Devon and Cornwall, they lived in London in a house given to them by Nancy&#x27;s mother as a wedding present. The couple separated in 1919 and divorced in 1925.

At this time she was on the edge of the influential group The Coterie, associating in particular with Iris Tree.

She contributed to the anthology &quot;Wheels&quot;, edited by the Sitwells, for which she provided the title poem; it has been said that the venture was originally her project.

Cunard&#x27;s lover Peter Broughton-Adderley was killed in action in France less than a month before Armistice Day. Many who knew her claimed that she never fully recovered from Adderley&#x27;s loss.
==Paris==
Nancy Cunard moved to Paris in 1920. There, she became involved with literary Modernism, Surrealists and Dada. Much of her published poetry dates from this period. During her early years in Paris, she was close to Michael Arlen.

In 1920 she had a near-fatal hysterectomy, for reasons that are not entirely clear. She recovered, and was then able to lead an active sexual life without the fear of pregnancy.

A brief relationship with Aldous Huxley influenced several of his novels. She was the model for Myra Viveash in &quot;Antic Hay&quot; (1923) and for Lucy Tantamount in &quot;Point Counter Point&quot; (1928).

In Paris, Cunard spent much time with Eugene McCown, an American artist from the hard-drinking set whom she made her protégé. It has been suggested that she became dependent on alcohol at this time, and may have used other drugs.

In 1928, the year she founded her publishing company, Hours Press, she met Henry Crowder, with whom she lived until 1933.

==Personal style==
Cunard&#x27;s style, informed by her devotion to the artefacts of African culture, was startlingly unconventional. The large-scale jewellery she favoured, crafted of wood, bone and ivory, the natural materials used by native crafts people, was provocative and controversial. The bangles she wore on both arms snaking from wrist to elbow were considered &quot;outré&quot; adornments, which provoked media attention, visually compelling subject matter for photographers of the day. She was often photographed wearing her collection, those of African inspiration and neckpieces of wooden cubes, which paid homage to the concepts of Cubism.

At first considered the bohemian affectation of an eccentric heiress, the fashion world came to legitimize this style as avant garde, dubbing it the &quot;barbaric look&quot;. Prestigious jewellery houses such as Boucheron created their own African-inspired cuff of gold beads. Boucheron, eschewing costly gemstones, incorporated into the finished creation green malachite and a striking purple mineral, purpurite, instead. It exhibited this high-end piece at the Exposition Coloniale in 1931.

==The Hours Press==
In 1927, Cunard moved into a farmhouse in La Chapelle-Réanville, Normandy. It was there in 1928 that she set up the Hours Press. Previously the small press had been called Three Mountains Press and run by William Bird, an American journalist in Paris, who had published books by its editor from 1923, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams&#x27; &quot;The Great American Novel&quot;, Robert McAlmond and Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;In Our Time&quot;. Cunard wanted to support experimental poetry and provide a higher-paying market for young writers. Her inherited wealth allowed her to take financial risks that other publishers could not. The Hours Press became known for its beautiful book designs and high-quality production.

It brought out the first separately published work of Samuel Beckett, a poem called &quot;Whoroscope&quot; (1930); Bob Brown&#x27;s &quot;Words&quot;; and Pound&#x27;s &quot;A Draft of XXX Cantos&quot;. Cunard published old friends such as George Moore, Norman Douglas, Richard Aldington and Arthur Symons, and brought out &quot;Henry-Music&quot;, a book of poems from various authors with music by Henry Crowder, two books by Laura Riding, the &quot;Collected Poems of John Rodker&quot;, poems by Roy Campbell, Harold Acton, Brian Howard and Walter Lowenfels. Wyn Henderson had taken over day-to-day operation of the press by 1931; in the same year it published its last book, &quot;The Revaluation of Obscenity&quot; by sexologist Havelock Ellis.

==Political activism==
In 1928 (after a two-year affair with Louis Aragon) Cunard began a relationship with Henry Crowder, an African-American jazz musician who was working in Paris. She became an activist in matters concerning racial politics and civil rights in the US, and visited Harlem. In 1931, she published the pamphlet &quot;Black Man and White Ladyship&quot;, an attack on racist attitudes as exemplified by Cunard&#x27;s mother, whom she quoted as saying: &quot;Is it true that my daughter knows a Negro?&quot;

She edited the massive &quot;Negro Anthology&quot;, collecting poetry, fiction, and nonfiction primarily by African-American writers, including Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. It included writing by George Padmore and Cunard&#x27;s own account of the Scottsboro Boys case. Press attention to this project in May 1932, two years before it was published, led to Cunard&#x27;s receiving anonymous threats and hate mail, some of which she published in the book, expressing regret that &quot;[others] are obscene, so this portion of American culture cannot be made public.&quot;

She identified as an anarchist.

==Anti-fascism==
In the mid-1930s Cunard took up the anti-fascist fight, writing about Mussolini&#x27;s annexation of Ethiopia and the Spanish Civil War. She predicted, accurately, that the &quot;events in Spain were a prelude to another world war&quot;. Her stories about the suffering of Spanish refugees became the basis for a fundraising appeal in the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;. Cunard herself helped deliver supplies and organize the relief effort, but poor health – caused in part by exhaustion and the conditions in the camps – forced her to return to Paris, where she stood on the streets collecting funds for the refugees. In the pages of Sylvia Pankhurst&#x27;s &quot;The New Times and Ethiopia News,&quot; in a comment on how ingrained race and colonial prejudices were even among the Left, she suggested that had the Spanish Popular Front government engaged the good-will of its colonial subjects, the fascist rebellion against the republic might have strangled where it first broke out – in Spanish Morocco.

In 1937 she published a series of pamphlets of war poetry, including the work of W. H. Auden, Tristan Tzara and Pablo Neruda. Later in 1937, together with Auden and Stephen Spender, she distributed a questionnaire about the war to writers in Europe. The results were published by the &quot;Left Review&quot; as &quot;Authors Take Sides on the Spanish War&quot;.

The questionnaire to 200 writers asked the following question: &quot;Are you for, or against, the legal government and people of Republican Spain? Are you for, or against, Franco and Fascism? For it is impossible any longer to take no side.&quot;

There were 147 answers, of which 126 supported the Republic, including W. H. Auden, Samuel Beckett and Rebecca West.

Five writers explicitly responded in favour of Franco: they were Evelyn Waugh, Edmund Blunden, Arthur Machen, Geoffrey Moss and Eleanor Smith.
Among sixteen responses that Cunard, in her eventually published compendium, grouped under the sceptical heading &quot;Neutral?&quot; were H. G. Wells, Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot and Vera Brittain.

The most famous response was not included: it came from George Orwell, and began:Will you please stop sending me this bloody rubbish. This is the second or third time I have had it. I am not one of your fashionable pansies like Auden or Spender, I was six months in Spain, most of the time fighting, I have a bullet hole in me at present and I am not going to write blah about defending democracy or gallant little anybody...Several other writers also declined to contribute, including Virginia Woolf, Bertrand Russell, E. M. Forster, and James Joyce.

During World War II, Cunard worked, to the point of physical exhaustion, as a translator in London on behalf of the French Resistance.

==Later life==
After the war, Cunard gave up her home at Réanville and travelled extensively. In June 1948, she travelled from Trinidad to the United Kingdom, on board the . The voyage and the ship later became well known because the other passengers on board included one of the first large groups of post-war West Indian immigrants to the United Kingdom.

In September 1948 she started renting a small house in the French village Lamothe-Fénelon in the Dordogne Valley. In later years she suffered from mental illness and poor physical health, worsened by alcoholism, poverty, and self-destructive behaviour. She was committed to a mental hospital after a fight with London police. After her release, her health declined even further, and she weighed less than 60 pounds when she was found on the street in Paris and brought to the Hôpital Cochin, where she died two days later.

Her body was returned to England for cremation and the remains were sent back to the Cimetière du Père-Lachaise in Paris. Her ashes rest in urn number 9016.

==Tributes==
Constantin Brâncuși&#x27;s &quot;La Jeune Fille Sophistiquée&quot; (&quot;Portrait de Nancy Cunard&quot;), a polished bronze on a carved marble base (1932), sold in May 2018 for US$71 million (with fees) at Christie&#x27;s New York, setting a world record auction price for the artist.

<text>The Shortlist Music Prize, stylized as (shôrt–lĭst), was an annual music award for the best album released in the United States that had sold fewer than 500,000 copies at the time of nomination. First given as a cash prize in 2001 under the name &quot;Shortlist Prize for Artistic Achievement in Music&quot;, the award was created by two music industry directors, Greg Spotts and Tom Serig, as an alternative to the commercial Grammy Awards. The recipient is chosen by a panel of entertainment industry members and journalists known as the &quot;Listmakers&quot;. Over 50 of the best albums of the previous 12 months are picked before being narrowed down to the eponymous Shortlist, from which a winner is chosen. Since 2003, a gold statuette, nicknamed &quot;The Shorty&quot;, has been given out in conjunction with the cash prize. In 2005, the Shortlist Music Prize was renamed the &quot;New Pantheon&quot; award for a year following a dispute between the prize&#x27;s founders. No nominees or winners have been announced since the presentation of the 2007 award.

Modeled on the British Mercury Prize, the Shortlist Music Prize was conceived to honor &quot;the most adventurous and creative albums of the year across all genres of music&quot;. At the end of 2001, Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós became the first recipients following a ceremony at the Hollywood Knitting Factory. Virgin Megastores sponsored the award during the inaugural year. The Shortlist Music Prize&#x27;s format continued in similar fashion the following years, but at different venues. Tower Records opened an online store for the award, which included CD samplers of each year&#x27;s nominated acts. The majority of the seven winners so far have been singer-songwriters: Irishman Damien Rice won in 2003, Americans Sufjan Stevens and Cat Power were successful in 2005 and 2006, respectively, and Canadian Feist won in 2007. Three winning albums eligible at the time of nomination—N.E.R.D&#x27;s &quot;In Search of...&quot;, Rice&#x27;s &quot;O&quot;, and Feist&#x27;s &quot;The Reminder&quot;—went on to sell over 500,000 copies in the United States and achieved gold certification. N.E.R.D received the accolade between the time of nomination and the award ceremony.

The Shortlist Music Prize quickly became an anticipated event and a coveted award. It provided an artistic and independent music focus in contrast to the Grammys&#x27; major label or chart rankings affiliations. The 2003 and 2004 Shortlist Music Prize ceremonies were shown on MTV2 in recorded format. In 2005, Sarig started using the New Pantheon name after co-founder Spotts left to focus on politics. The 2005 award ceremony was pushed back from the end of the year to March 2006 to coincide with the Grammys; it was eventually canceled because of &quot;logistical reasons&quot; and winner Stevens was given his prize informally. After threatening legal action for the continuation of the Short List brand under the New Pantheon guise, Spotts returned and purchased both trademarks, uniting the two titles under the Shortlist Music Prize. The award ceremony continued to be held in the early part of years until the last given prize for 2007.

<text>Semiclassical gravity is an approximation to the theory of quantum gravity in which one treats matter and energy fields as being quantum and the gravitational field as being classical.

In semiclassical gravity, matter is represented by quantum matter fields that propagate according to the theory of quantum fields in curved spacetime. The spacetime in which the fields propagate is classical but dynamical. The dynamics of the theory is described by the &quot;semiclassical Einstein equations&quot;, which relate the curvature of spacetime that is encoded by the Einstein tensor formula_1 to the expectation value of the energy–momentum tensor formula_2 (a quantum field theory operator) of the matter fields, i.e.

: formula_3

where &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant, and formula_4 indicates the quantum state of the matter fields.

==Energy–momentum tensor==
There is some ambiguity in regulating the energy–momentum tensor, and this depends upon the curvature. This ambiguity can be absorbed into the cosmological constant, the gravitational constant, and the quadratic couplings
: formula_5 and formula_6
There is another quadratic term of the form
: formula_7
but in four dimensions this term is a linear combination of the other two terms and a surface term. See Gauss–Bonnet gravity for more details.

Since the theory of quantum gravity is not yet known, it is difficult to precisely determine the regime of validity of semiclassical gravity. However, one can formally show that semiclassical gravity could be deduced from quantum gravity by considering &quot;N&quot; copies of the quantum matter fields and taking the limit of &quot;N&quot; going to infinity while keeping the product &quot;GN&quot; constant. At a diagrammatic level, semiclassical gravity corresponds to summing all Feynman diagrams that do not have loops of gravitons (but have an arbitrary number of matter loops). Semiclassical gravity can also be deduced from an axiomatic approach.

==Experimental status==
There are cases where semiclassical gravity breaks down. For instance, if &quot;M&quot; is a huge mass, then the superposition
: formula_8
where the locations &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are spatially separated, results in an expectation value of the energy–momentum tensor that is &quot;M&quot;/2 at &quot;A&quot; and &quot;M&quot;/2 at &quot;B&quot;, but one would never observe the metric sourced by such a distribution. Instead, one would observe the decoherence into a state with the metric sourced at &quot;A&quot; and another sourced at &quot;B&quot; with a 50% chance each. Extensions of semiclassical gravity that incorporate decoherence have also been studied.

==Applications==
The most important applications of semiclassical gravity are to understand the Hawking radiation of black holes and the generation of random Gaussian-distributed perturbations in the theory of cosmic inflation, which is thought to occur at the very beginning of the Big Bang.

<doc id="1049454" wikidata="Q16251321" url="?curid=1049454" title="List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies (2005–2010)">
<text>This is a list of the 646 previous constituencies of the United Kingdom parliament.

There are 650 in the 2010 election constituencies currently represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, as at the 2005 general election. Each constituency is represented by a single Member of Parliament (MP).

Constituency boundaries are subject to regular review by the four independent Boundary Commissions, usually once every 10 to 15 years, to keep the electorate of each constituency as close to the national average as is reasonably possible. New constituencies may be created, or existing ones abolished, by these reviews.

Constituencies were long based on boroughs (burghs in Scotland) and counties. Today, constituencies in England are mostly subdivisions of local authorities, with each constituency comprising a number of whole wards. In Scotland, constituencies are subdivisions of council areas, and in Wales they are subdivisions of the preserved counties. Northern Ireland is reviewed as a whole, and constituency boundaries may cross all district borders.

In some cases, particularly in urban areas, two or more local government areas may be combined to form a single review area, so that particularly large or small constituencies are not created. For example, if two adjacent areas are entitled to 1.5 constituencies each, they may be combined and awarded three constituencies, rather than having two constituencies each, all of which would be well below the average constituency electorate.

The average constituency size is approximately 74,000 registered voters, but they vary in size from the smallest (Na h-Eileanan an Iar at 22,200 voters) to the largest (the Isle of Wight at approximately 110,000 voters). A constituency has no physical size restrictions.

The Parliament of 2001 contained representatives from 659 constituencies. Most of the current constituency boundaries were last reviewed in the early 1990s, and are therefore based on administrative boundaries prior to the last series of local government boundary changes. However, a Boundary Commission for Scotland review in February 2005 resulted in the reorganisation of most Scottish constituencies to adjust for the historic over-representation of Scotland. This reduced the number of constituencies in Scotland by 13, from 72 down to the current 59. The Parliament of 2005 therefore had 646 representatives. In the 2010 Election on 6 May 2010 the number of seats contested has increased from 646 to 650 as a result of boundary changes. Technically an absolute majority would require one party to win 326 seats, or else there would be a hung parliament.

==Scotland==
The Fifth Periodical Review of the Boundary Commission for Scotland related the boundaries of new constituencies to those of Scottish local government council areas and to local government wards. Apart from a few minor adjustments, the council area boundaries dated from 1996 and the ward boundaries dated from 1999. Some council areas were grouped to form larger areas and, within these larger areas, some constituencies straddle council area boundaries.

<doc id="1049461" wikidata="Q16189" url="?curid=1049461" title="Province of L'Aquila">
<text>The province of L&#x27;Aquila () is the largest, most mountainous and least densely populated province of the Abruzzo region of Italy. It comprises about half the landmass of Abruzzo and occupies the western part of the region. It has borders with the provinces of Teramo to the north, Pescara and Chieti to the east, Isernia (in Molise region) to the south and Frosinone, Rome and Rieti (in Lazio region) to the west. Its capital is the city of L&#x27;Aquila.

The province of L&#x27;Aquila includes the highest mountains of the Apennines (Gran Sasso, Maiella and Velino-Sirente), their highest peak, Corno Grande, the high plain of Campo Imperatore, and Europe&#x27;s southernmost glacier, the Calderone. The province&#x27;s major rivers are the Aterno-Pescara, Sangro, Liri, Salto, and the Turano; its major lakes are Lago Scanno and Lago Barrea. It once included the third largest lake on the Italian peninsula, Lago Fucino, which was drained in one of the 19th century&#x27;s largest engineering projects. The lake basin is today a flourishing agricultural area and an important technological district.

==Economy and population==
The province is known for its many castles, fortresses and pristine medieval hill towns. The province&#x27;s two major cities, L&#x27;Aquila and Avezzano, have had rapid economic expansion since the late 20th century, with the growth of transportation manufacturing, telecommunications, and computer industries.

Throughout most of the 20th century, there were serious population declines in the rural areas, with the near collapse of the province&#x27;s pastoral agricultural economy, as people moved to cities for work. Since the founding of the Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga and Majella national parks, and the Sirente-Velino Regional Park, tourists have been attracted to the mountainous landscapes. Tourism and associated services have boosted the economy of rural L&#x27;Aquila and begun to reverse its population decline.

===Earthquakes===

Earthquakes mark the history of the province, especially its capital city L&#x27;Aquila. The city suffered earthquakes in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries, followed by the 1703 Apennine earthquakes and most recently on 6 April 2009. This caused extensive damage to the city and areas of the province just outside L&#x27;Aquila, particularly along SS 17. It also resulted in the deaths of 308 people, injured about 1,500, and left over 66,000 unhoused. At 01:32 GMT (03:32 CEST) on 6 April, an earthquake of 6.3 magnitude struck central Italy with its epicentre near L&#x27;Aquila, at .

== Main sights==
===L&#x27; Aquila ===
Tourists in L&#x27;Aquila come mostly from Italy.

In the highest part of the town is the massive Spanish Fort (&quot;Forte Spagnolo&quot;), erected by the Spanish viceroy Don Pedro de Toledo in 1534. It is currently home to the National Museum of Abruzzo.

L&#x27;Aquila Cathedral, dedicated to Saint Maximus of Aveia (San Massimo), was built in the 13th century, but crumbled down during the 1703 earthquake. The most recent façade is from the 19th century, but after the earthquake of 2009 and subsequent aftershocks the transept and possibly more of the cathedral has collapsed.
The Basilica of San Bernardino (1472) has a fine Renaissance façade by Nicolò Filotesio (commonly called Cola dell&#x27;Amatrice), and contains the monumental tomb of the saint, decorated with beautiful sculptures, and executed by Silvestro Ariscola in 1480.
The church of Santa Maria di Collemaggio, just outside the town, has a very fine Romanesque façade of simple design (1270–1280) in red and white marble, with three finely decorated portals and a rose-window above each. The two side doors are also fine. The interior contains the mausoleum of Pope Celestine V erected in 1517. Many smaller churches in the town have similar façades (S. Giusta, S. Silvestro and others).

The town also contains some fine palaces: the municipality has a museum, with a collection of Roman inscriptions and some illuminated service books. The Palazzi Dragonetti and Persichetti contain private collections of pictures. Outside the town is the &quot;Fontana delle novantanove cannelle&quot;, a fountain with ninety-nine jets distributed along three walls, constructed in 1272. The source of the fountain is still unknown.

A well-known city landmark is the &quot;Fontana Luminosa &quot;(&quot;Luminous Fountain&quot;), a sculpture of two women bearing large jars, built in the 1930s. The local cemetery includes the grave of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, a 19th‑century German gay rights pioneer who lived in L&#x27;Aquila; every year, gay people from all over the world meet at the cemetery to honour his memory.

The surrounding area boasts Roman ruins (the important Roman city of Amiternum), ancient monasteries, and numerous castles. The best-known of these is Rocca Calascio (used in the 1980s as the location for the movie &quot;Ladyhawke&quot;), which is the highest castle in Italy and one of the highest in Europe. Also nearby are several ski resorts like Gran Sasso d&#x27;Italia, the highest of the Apennines where in its valley the movie &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; was filmed in the end of the 1980s.

=== Sulmona ===
Sulmona has various piazzas, churches and palaces of historical and touristic interest. Some of these include:

* Sulmona Cathedral, located on the northwest side of the old city and was built on the site of a Roman temple. It contains a crypt which retains its Romanesque appearance despite the 18th-century renovation of the main church.
* &quot;Piazza XX Settembre&quot;. One of the main squares of the city, including a bronze statue of the Roman poet Ovid.
* &quot;Corso Ovidio&quot;. The city&#x27;s main thoroughfare connects the cathedral and the major piazzas and is lined by elegant covered arcades, shops, cafes, palaces and churches.
* &quot;Palazzo Annunziata &quot;and &quot;Chiesa della SS. Annunziata&quot;. The Palace, one of the rare examples of late medieval/early Renaissance architecture in Sulmona that survived the earthquake of 1706. Its facade contains fine sculpture and tracery work. Inside the Palazzo is a museum showing the Roman history of the city as well as various artifacts. The church is a fine example of Baroque architecture and has a beautiful interior and bell tower.
* &quot;Piazza Garibaldi&quot; is the largest square in town with a large baroque era fountain. A Palio style medieval festival and horse race known as the &quot;Giostra Cavalleresca&quot; takes place here every year in the Summer. At Easter, crowds gather to witness the &quot;Madonna che Scappa&quot;. This ceremony involves the procession of a statue of the Madonna which is carried across the square while the bearers run to encounter a statue of the resurrected Christ on the other side of the square. On the south side of the Piazza is the 12th Century Gothic aqueduct. The square hosts a market twice each week on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

The remains of the ancient city are of little interest as ruins, but indicate the existence of a considerable town; among them are the vestiges of an amphitheatre, a theatre, and thermae, all of them located outside the gates of the modern city. About 3 km from the city, at the foot of Monte Morrone, are some ruins of reticulated masonry, traditionally believed to be Ovid&#x27;s villa. Today, they are more properly identified as the sanctuary of &quot;Hercules Curinus&quot;. Nearby is the &quot;Badia Morronese&quot;, a large (c. 119 × 140 m) religious complex located near Pope Celestine V&#x27;s hermitage. It was founded by Celestine as a chapel in 1241, and was enlarged and later made into a convent.

=== Rocca Calascio ===
The Rocca Calascio is a mountaintop fortress or &quot;rocca&quot; in the municipality of Calascio. At an elevation of , the castle is the highest fortress in the Apennines. Built of stone and masonry exclusively for military purposes and intended only to accommodate troops and never as residence for nobles, the fortress overlooks the Plain of Navelli at one of the highest points in the ancient Barony of Carapelle.

Construction of the fortress started in the tenth century as a single watchtower. A walled courtyard with four cylindrical towers at the corners around a taller inner tower was added in the thirteenth century. The lower half of the fortress is built with distinctively larger stones than its upper half. It is believed that this feature was to make its base impenetrable to invaders. The fortress was never tested in battle. However, it was badly damaged in November 1461 by an earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 7 to 8 on the Richter Scale. While the town of Calascio, which lies below the fortress, was rebuilt, the fortress was not.

=== Avezzano ===
Avezzano, having been completely destroyed by the earthquake of 1915, has no monuments of particular interest as do other locations in the region of Abruzzo. However, you can see some important remains of its ancient history. The remains of the ancient Roman site of Alba Fucens are located 7 kilometers north of the city.

The Castello Orsini-Colonna was built in 1490 by Gentile Virginio Orsini, who had it built around a pre-existing medieval tower of the twelfth century; it is square, with round towers at the angles. The castle project was probably led by the engineer Francesco di Giorgio Martini. In the sixteenth century the castle was expanded by the order of Marcantonio Colonna, becoming an elegant residence. Severely damaged by the earthquake of 1915, it was partially restored after 1990.

The Tunnels of Claudius are located south of the city. They were built by the emperor Claudius between 41 and 52 AD by which the emperor made the first attempts at draining the huge Lake Fucino. To create the tunnels and the main gallery, 25,000 slaves were needed. They dug 32 wells and six tunnels. The lake was largely drained, but with the fall of the Roman Empire the tunnels were obstructed and the lake returned to its previous levels. Many centuries later, Alessandro Torlonia completed the work by finally draining Lake Fucino, building on the original project of the emperor Claudius and turning the land under the great lake into a fertile plain. In 1977, the tunnels were opened as an archaeological park.

The Avezzano Cathedral was built in 1000 and documented in the thirteenth century. After its destruction as a result of the earthquake of 1915, it was rebuilt after 1940 in the new central square of Avezzano. The facade is neo-Renaissance travertine. The three portals are topped with mosaics depicting Christ and the two protectors of Avezzano, the Virgin Mary and St. Bartholomew. The church inside presents three large naves and a valuable organ placed in the church in 1955.

The original Sanctuary of the Madonna di Pietraquaria was destroyed by Charles I of Anjou after the battle of Tagliacozzo in 1268 and rebuilt a few centuries later. In 1915, it did not suffer serious damage and was home to many survivors of the quake.

==&quot;Comuni&quot;==

There are 108 &quot;comuni&quot; (: &quot;comune&quot;) in the province .

<doc id="1049469" wikidata="Q7075992" url="?curid=1049469" title="Ocean Falls">
<text>Ocean Falls is a community on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada. Formerly a large company town owned by Crown Zellerbach, it is accessible only via boat or seaplane, and is home for a few dozen full-time residents, with the seasonal population upwards of 100.

==Geography and environment==

Ocean Falls is noted for its abundance of rain - about annually, and its residents are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Rain People&quot;. Situated around a waterfall from Link Lake straight into Cousins Inlet, it has considerable energy resources that are largely untapped.

==History==
The Heiltsuk native speaking people and the Nuxalk native speaking people inhabited the coastal region surrounding Ocean Falls for more than 9,000 years. In 1903, the Bella Coola Pulp and Paper Company surveyed the area and was impressed with the hydro power potential of the site. In 1906, following the company&#x27;s acquisition of of land, clearing began for the town and three years later, a sawmill, hospital and school were established. In 1912, the dam was erected and the pulp mill began operating. The Ocean Falls pulp and paper mill was the largest mill in British Columbia for many years. The mill produced mechanical, sulfite and sulphate pulp processed on two newsprint machines, two kraft paper machines and one tissue machine. Much of the electrical power for the mill and town was produced by four hydro turbines.

Ocean Falls&#x27; population numbered 250 in 1912 and grew to 3,500 by 1950. By 1970, the number of inhabitants had dropped to 1,500. Only about 70 people, mostly loggers, remained by 1990.

The profit structure of the original investment changed considerably during the mill&#x27;s many years of operation. Low labour costs, inexpensive hydro power and low infrastructure costs made the Ocean Falls mill a viable proposition. Nevertheless, the remote location, rising labour costs and the high cost of operating a town site made further investment unattractive. The Ocean Falls pulp and paper mill was a very large and complex production facility and modernization costs were prohibitive.

By the early 1970s, the facility was inefficient and uneconomical. The owner at that time, Crown Zellerbach, decided to close the plant and effectively shut down the town by March 1973. The provincial government bought the town and mill at a minimal cost a few weeks before the planned closure and kept the mill operating until 1980. The Ocean Falls mill thus joined the ranks of other older, remote pulp and paper mills in British Columbia shut down during the latter part of the twentieth century.

Today, much of the town has been demolished, and many of the remaining buildings are in decay. Nevertheless, Ocean Falls maintains a residential community and a social network of former residents.

Several disasters have struck the town. A major apartment fire in 1950 killed eight, a mudslide in 1965 killed seven and the town&#x27;s Charleson school burned down on the night between December 21 and 22, 1969. Although no one was seriously hurt in the school fire, the little community was traumatized nevertheless. The school was closed for only three days; several teachers went to Bella Bella to obtain school desks and classes were held throughout the community, from the community centre to the Royal Canadian Legion branch pub (grade 12 students) to part of the Martin Inn, a 600-bed hotel. The new school, with one of the largest indoor gymnasiums in British Columbia, opened in 1971. 
==Economy and infrastructure==
At its largest, Ocean Falls was the home to around 3900 people, a K-12 school system, its own hospital, one of the province&#x27;s largest hotels and a swimming pool where several swimming champions trained.

Ocean Falls was a typical single-employer town where the company operated and maintained the complete town site. A town site manager, working in a town site office, managed the allocation of apartments and houses on behalf of the people living in town. Utilities such as water, electricity, and heat were subsidized by the company. The rental cost of accommodation was also quite reasonable permitting the residents of Ocean Falls to live rather inexpensively. In the nearby Martin Valley, residents could purchase their own single-family houses. However, in most cases the company offered a buy-back option to protect the purchaser.
The town consisted of a blend of fairly large apartments, duplexes and single-family homes. Most of the buildings were located on the fairly steep slope of the Caro Marion mountain. The town&#x27;s main store and several other smaller businesses were located along the harbour front. The Ocean Falls Court House, the Legion Hall, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police building and the Post office are also in the harbour area. Most of the roads leading up the hills away from the harbour area were heavily constructed timber roads. These roads were capable of carrying large vehicles such as trucks or fire engines. There were very few cars in town and usually only one taxi cab. Most of the cars were owned by people who lived in Martin Valley.

The harbour was well protected from most wind directions and there was plenty of dock space for local as well as visiting boaters. The harbour was kept dredged so that deep sea ships could tie up at the mill&#x27;s paper warehouses. There were float planes arriving and departing every day. Larger amphibious planes such as Grumman Goose and Mallards were flying passengers in from Vancouver and other larger settlements. The town was also served by freighters which would bring in supplies from Vancouver.

The only cruise ship that ever called at Ocean Falls was Holland America&#x27;s &quot;SS Rotterdam&quot; on May 18, 1997. The ship was chartered by a British Columbia tour operator, Wells Gray Tours. The town had only 50 residents, but they successfully hosted 1,100 visitors. There was hope that other Alaska-bound cruise ships would start to visit Ocean Falls, but it never happened. On October 6, 2019, the 400-passenger &quot;MV Seabourn Sojourn&quot; cruised off Oceans Falls in an unexpected visit when its planned day in Klemtu, British Columbia, was cancelled due to weather, but no-one went ashore.

There is a sign on the road that reads &quot;July 13, 1929, Give to the world the best you have and the best will come back to you - Willy Buttner&quot;.

The town is now home to a Bitcoin mining operation due to the availability of electricity that would otherwise not be utilized. After the shut down of the pulp mill, only one third of the privately owned dam&#x27;s power capacity was in use, as this is all that was needed by the powered communities of Ocean Falls, Shearwater, and Bella Bella. There are no power lines connecting the dam to the North American power grid, thus no opportunity to sell power to anywhere other than local communities.

<doc id="1049471" wikidata="Q16160" url="?curid=1049471" title="Province of Chieti">
<text>The province of Chieti (; Abruzzese: &quot;&quot;) is a province in the Abruzzo region of Italy. Its provincial capital is the city Chieti, which has a population of 50,770 inhabitants. The province has a total population of 387,649 inhabitants and spans an area of . The province contains 104 &quot;comuni&quot; (: &quot;comune&quot;). Its provincial president is Mario Pupillo.

Chieti&#x27;s cathedral was first constructed during the 9th century but was reconstructed during the 13th century. The province contains the National Archaeology Museum of Abruzzo, in Italian the Museo Archeologico Nazionale d&#x27;Abruzzo, which contains items from the area prior to Roman rule.

==History==
It was first settled by the Osci people near the Pescara River. In around 1000 BCE it was conquered by Marsi and Marrucini people. The city was also lived in by the Greeks, who named it Teate. It was conquered by the Romans in 305 BCE but after the fall of Rome in 476 CE, Theodoric the Great gained ownership of the city and it was subsequently used as a Lombard fortress. The city was then owned by the Franks, the Normans, the Hohenstaufen, the Angevins and Aragonese rulers until strong control over the city was gained by Charles V of France. Chieti was made the capital of Abruzzo Citra under its period of rule by the House of Bourbon.

The province of Chieti contains Ortona, a town founded by Fretani people for trading with the Greeks, which was the scene of a World War II battle between German and predominantly British and Canadian forces; over 2,000 civilians died and the town was largely destroyed.

==Geography==
The province of Chieti is one of four provinces in the region of Abruzzo, on the eastern coast of Italy. It is the most easternmost province in the region and is bounded to the northeast by the Adriatic Sea. The province of Pescara lies to the north and the province of L&#x27;Aquila to the northwest. To the south lies the province of Isernia and the province of Campobasso lies to the south east, both these provinces being part of the region of Molise. The provincial capital is Chieti, situated on a ridge a few miles inland and just south of the River Aterno-Pescara, which flows into the sea at nearby Pescara.

There has been a movement by farmers away from the land and the area. The outflow has been greatest from the hilly and mountainous areas, where the holdings are small and worked by the families who own them. In the period 1951 to 1971, the number of people employed in agriculture in Chieti fell from over 80% to around 45%, the number employed in industry tripled to around 20% and the number employed in the service sector, tripled to around 30%.

== Main sights ==

=== Chieti ===
* The Gothic Cathedral, re-built by bishop Attone I in 1069. Of that building only parts of the Romanesque crypt remain. The church was remade in the 14th century and the bell tower was enlarged. After several earthquakes, the church was rebuilt again in the late 17th-18th centuries in Baroque style.
* Oratory of Sacro Monte dei Morti
* Church of San Francesco al Corso, founded in 1239. The façade shows an incomplete Baroque restoration.
* Church of Santa Chiara

Under the church of SS. Pietro e Paolo and the adjoining houses are extensive substructures (in &quot;opus reticulatum&quot; and brickwork) of the 1st century CE, belonging to a building erected by M. Vectius Marcellus and Helvidia Priscilla. There are also remains of large reservoirs and of an ancient theatre. In the early 21st century, new archeological excavations are under way on the site of the former Campo Sportivo.

=== Lanciano ===

*Cathedral of Santa Maria del Ponte (&quot;St. Mary of the Bridge&quot;), so called because it is built on bridgework along a precipice: is the work of Michitelli (1619) and has some paintings by Pozzulaniello (Giacinto Diana). It houses also an 8th-century Byzantine statue portraying the Madonna, probably brought here during the iconoclast controversy.
*Chiesa di Santa Maria Maggiore, one of the most important architectural sites in Abruzzo. Built in 1227 according to Bourgogne-Cistercian lines, it was updated in 1540 in Baroque style, with the addition of two aisles and stucco decorations (recently stripped off). The main gate is from 1317.
*Chiesa di San Francesco (1258), built over a pre-existing 7th-century church. The high altar houses the relics of the Eucharistic Miracle.
*Chiesa di Sant&#x27;Agostino (1270). The façade has maintained the original rose window and the gate, while the single nave interior is a Baroque restoration.
*Chiesa di San Biagio (11th century) is the oldest church of the city. It has a bell tower and it&#x27;s always opened on 3 February for the anointing of the throat, a Catholic rite linked to the cult Saint Biagio.
*Torri Montanare, a relic of the ancient walls (11th century). They consist in two massive towers, the most recent dating to the 15th century, offering a panoramic view of the area.
*Porta San Biagio (11th century), the only one gate remaining of the nine once existing
*Torre civica (19th century) was built over a pre-existing tower next to the cathedral. Nowadays it is a belfry and a clock tower.
*Torre Aragonese (15th century) was a tower along the ancient walls.
*Palazzo dell&#x27;Arcivescovado (16th century) is still the seat of the archbishop and houses a diocesan Museum.
*Botteghe medievali was a house built in 1434. It has two floors and on the ground floor there are antique shops, with external bank according to the Roman use.

=== Vasto ===

The old part of the town (&quot;centro storico&quot;) features a number of interesting buildings and churches dating from the 12th to the 18th century, including:
*Cathedral of San Giuseppe 
*Santa Maria Maggiore: largest and oldest church in the town, mentioned in a document as early as 1195, with a tall bell tower. Damaged by the Turks in 1566, and by a fire in 1645, it went a thorough restructuring in 1735 in which it got the current shape. It hosts one of alleged Jesus&#x27; crown of thorns (Sacra Spina).
*Castello Caldoresco
*, which houses four museums, called 

Below the hill on which the town is located, the beach resort town of Marina di Vasto offers a large sandy beach and several hotels and other facilities. 
Further north the coast becomes rocky and features interesting pebble and stone beaches and coves, as well as the typical &quot;trabocchi&quot;, that are typical wooden fishing machines of the Southern Abruzzo coast. 
Amongst the most interesting natural areas, also featuring a number of sandy and rocky beaches, is the protected natural area of the Riserva Naturale di Punta Aderci, whose beaches were voted in 2014 3rd of the top 20 beaches in Italy.
=== Ortona ===
The origins of Ortona are uncertain. Presumably, it was first inhabited by the Frentani, an Italic population. In 2005, during works near the Castle, a Bronze Age settlement was discovered, and the Roman town largely coincided with this first settlement. Some sections of paved roads and urban walls, as well as some archaeological findings are the only remains of this period. Ortona remained a part of the Roman Empire i.e., the Byzantine Empire for several centuries, before it was annexed by the Kingdom of the Lombards. In 803 the Franks incorporated Ortona into the county of Chieti. From that date on, the town remained tied to Chieti and its territory.
In 1258 the relics of the Apostle Thomas were brought to Ortona by the sailor Leone Acciaiuoli. In the first half of the 15th century its walls were built, and during this period Ortona fought with the nearby town of Lanciano in a fierce war that ended in 1427. On June 30, 1447, ships from Venice destroyed the port of Ortona; consequently the king of Sicily at that time commissioned the construction of a Castle to dominate the renovated port. In 1582 the town was acquired by Margaret of Parma, daughter of Emperor Charles V and Duchess of Parma. In 1584 Margaret decided to build a great mansion, known as Palazzo Farnese, which was never completed due to her death.

After the establishment of the Kingdom of Italy in 1860, Ortona became one of the first sea resorts on the Adriatic Sea. On 9 September 1943, the royal family of the House of Savoy left German-occupied Italy from the port of Ortona. The defensive Gustav Line was established by the Germans at Ortona, extending towards Cassino on the opposite side of Italy. Ortona offered the Allies a supply port on the Adriatic and was fiercely defended by the Germans attracted the attention of that the international press in the struggle between the German paratroopers and the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade. This led to this battle being known as &quot;Little Stalingrad&quot;.

=== Guardiagrele ===
The biggest church in Guardiagrele is Santa Maria Maggiore of which it has been written:
In addition to Santa Maria Maggiore, there are several other churches and palazzi or mansions of various ages which are of architectural interest, including S. Nicola di Bari (founded in the 4th century), the convent of the Chapuchins (1599), Palazzo De Lucia (16th century), Palazzo Elisii (15th-18th century), the cloister of the Palazzo Comunale Piazza San Francesco (17th century) and Palazzo Marini (1391).

Museums include:

* Museo Civico (Civic Museum)
* Museo del Costume e della Tradizione della Nostra Gente (Costume and Folk Museum)
* Museo del Duomo (&quot;Cathedral Museum&quot;), in Santa Maria Maggiore
* Museo Archeologico (&quot;Archaeological Museum&quot;)

*Brecciarola
*Giuliopoli (Rosello)
*Melone
*Piane d&#x27;Archi
*Pianibbie
*Saletti

<text>Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke (15 January 195329 August 2012) was a British historian and professor of Western esotericism at the University of Exeter, best known for his authorship of several scholarly books on the history of Germany between the World Wars and Western esotericism.

==Early life and education==
Goodrick-Clarke was born in Lincoln, UK, on 15 January 1953, and was an Open Exhibitioner at Lancing College. He studied German, politics, and philosophy at the University of Bristol, and gained a B.A. with distinction. Moving to St. Edmund Hall, Oxford, Goodrick-Clarke obtained a D.Phil. with a dissertation on the modern occult revival and Theosophy at the end of the twentieth century.

==Career==
Goodrick-Clarke&#x27;s Ph.D. dissertation was the basis for his most celebrated work, &quot;The Occult Roots of Nazism&quot;. This book has been continually in print since its first publication in 1985, and has been translated into twelve languages. Later notable works include his well-regarded &quot;Paracelsus: Essential Readings&quot;, published in 1990, and &quot;Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity&quot;, published in 2001.

In his varied career, Goodrick-Clarke worked as a schoolmaster, banker, and a successful fundraiser for The Campaign for Oxford. In 2002, he was appointed a Research Fellow in Western Esotericism at the University of Lampeter, and then in 2005 he was appointed to a personal chair in the Department of History at Exeter University. As Professor of Western Esotericism and Director of the Exeter Centre for the Study of Esotericism (EXESESO), he developed a successful distance-learning M.A. in Western Esotericism and successfully supervised a number of doctoral students. While at Exeter he wrote &quot;The Western Esoteric Traditions: A Historical Introduction&quot;, published in 2008.

In 1983, Goodrick-Clarke was one of the founder members of &quot;The Society&quot;, an informal London-based association of professional and amateur scholars of esotericism, including Ellic Howe, the publisher Michael Cox, John Hamill, and the scholar of Rosicrucianism, Christopher McIntosh. He was a founding member of both the European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism and the Association for the Study of Esotericism (ASE), in America. He was a faculty member of the New York Open Center from 1995.

==Later life and death==
Goodrick-Clarke was the Director of the Centre for the Study of Esotericism (EXESESO) within the College of Humanities at Exeter until his death on 29 August 2012.
