<text>The M26-MASS (Modular Accessory Shotgun System) is a shotgun configured as an underbarrel ancillary weapon attachment mounted onto the handguard of a service rifle, usually the M16/M4 family of United States military, essentially making the host weapon a combination gun. It can also be operated as a stand-alone shotgun by attachment to a pistol grip/collapsible buttstock module. Rollout commenced in 2013, replacing the Mossberg 500 shotguns in service.

== Development ==

The M26-MASS is a lightweight underbarrel shotgun configured to be secured to a main rifle, developed by C-More Systems and manufactured by Vertu Corporation and originally marketed toward special operations forces. It attracted the interest of soldiers being deployed to Afghanistan who wanted a lightweight system that could eliminate the need to carry additional weapons.

The M26-MASS had been in development at the U.S. Army&#x27;s Soldier Battle Lab since the late 1990s. The idea was to provide soldiers with lightweight accessory weapons which could be mounted underbarrel of the standard issue M16 rifle or M4 carbine. These would provide soldiers with additional capabilities, such as: door breaching using special slugs, very short-range increased lethality using 00 buckshot, and less-lethal capabilities using teargas shells, rubber slugs, rubber pellets, or other non-lethal rounds.

The original idea was based on the Knight&#x27;s Armament Company Masterkey system, which dates back to the 1980s and originally comprised a shortened, tube-fed Remington 870 shotgun mounted under an M16 rifle or M4 carbine. The M26-MASS improved upon the original Masterkey concept with a detachable magazine option and more comfortable handling, thanks to a bolt-operated system which is manually cycled for reloading and is characterized by a bolt which must be moved backward to remove a spent case and forward to chamber a new cartridge. The relatively large bolt handle is located closer to the rear rather than the slide on the Masterkey pump shotgun, and thus is easier to cycle in combat. The handle can be easily attached on either side of the bolt. The detachable magazine offers quicker reloading and change of ammunition types.

The M26-MASS was chosen by the U.S. Military over the Masterkey as a breaching tool. Small numbers of M26-MASS shotguns were issued to U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The current contract calls for the delivery of 9,000 shotguns. In February 2012, the first unit was fully equipped with M26-MASS. At the same time the U.S. Army is in the process of replacing the M500s with the M26s.

=== War in Afghanistan ===
In May 2008, the Army announced it would procure 35,000 units. The first M26-MASS shotguns were procured and fielded to military police and engineer units in 2010. However, some units in both Iraq and Afghanistan were issued the M26-MASS in small quantities as early as 2003. Full initial fielding began in 2011.

<doc id="1043896" wikidata="Q2972358" url="?curid=1043896" title="Cif">
<text>Cif is a French brand of household cleaning products owned by the English-Dutch company Unilever, known as Jif in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Middle East and the Nordic countries.

Cif was launched in France in 1965 and was marketed in competition against scouring powders such as Vim.

==Name==
Cif is sold under the names Jif, Vim, Viss and Handy Andy, depending on which of the 51 countries it is sold in.

In Sweden, and South Africa, the products were originally sold under the name Vim before this was changed to Jif, the launch name in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands and Hong Kong.

In January 2001, the name in most of these countries was changed to Cif in order to align marketing and product inventories across the continent.

In Belgium, Finland and Portugal, the product was known as Vim for quite some time, after which it became Cif. In Canada it is still called Vim. In Germany, the cleaner&#x27;s name is Viss. In Iraq it is still traded as Jif, with local Arabic and English writing.

In Norway, the product is traded as Jif and owned by Lilleborg, a part of Solenis. Unilever had a decades long partnership with Lilleborg when they were given the exclusive rights to the brand Jif in Norway. Lilleborg registered the trademark in 1968. Without consent from Lilleborg, Unilever registered their trademark Cif in 1998 and started selling Cif products in 2018. Thereafter Lilleborg protested and two &quot;JIF vs CIF&quot; court cases followed. The court decided that Unilever was allowed to keep the brand Cif, but not allowed to sell Cif products in Norway.

In the United States, Cif Cream Cleaner is sold as a co-branded product with Scrub Daddy.

<doc id="1043898" wikidata="Q2665559" url="?curid=1043898" title="Gnathostomiasis">
<text>Gnathostomiasis, also known as larva migrans profundus, is the human infection caused by the nematode &quot;Gnathostoma spinigerum&quot; and/or &quot;Gnathostoma hispidum&quot;, which infects vertebrates.

==Signs and symptoms==
A few days after ingestion epigastric pain, fever, vomiting, and loss of appetite resulting from the migration of larvae through the intestinal wall to the abdominal cavity will appear in the patient. Migration of parasites in the subcutaneous tissues causing intermittent, migratory, painful, pruritic swellings is known as &quot;cutaneous larva migrans&quot;. Patches of edema appear after initial symptoms clear and are usually found on the abdomen. These lesions vary in size and can be accompanied by pruritus, rash, and stabbing pain. Swellings may last 1 to 4 weeks in a given area and reappear in a different location. Migration to other tissues causes &quot;visceral larva migrans&quot; and can result in cough, hematuria, ocular involvement, meningitis, encephalitis and eosinophilia. Eosinophilic myeloencephalitis may also result from invasion of the central nervous system by the larvae.

==Causes==
Human gnathostomiasis is an infection by the migrating third-stage larvae of any of five species of &quot;Gnathostoma&quot;. The most common cause in Asia is &quot;G. spinigerum&quot;, and the most common cause in the Americas is &quot;G. binucleatum&quot;. &quot;G. hispidium&quot; and &quot;G. doloresi&quot; occur in East and Southeast Asia; the former has also been found in Eastern Europe&quot;.&quot; &quot;G. nipponicum&quot; occurs only in Japan and China. There is one unconfirmed report of G. &quot;malaysiae&quot; causing disease in humans.

== Transmission ==

Gnathostomiasis is transmitted by the ingestion of third-stage larvae from or insufficiently cooked second intermediate or paratenic hosts such as freshwater fish, snakes, poultry, or frogs.

In Thailand and Vietnam, the most common cause appears to be consumption of undercooked Asian swamp eels (&quot;Monopterus albus,&quot; also called &quot;Fluta alba&quot;) which transmit &quot;G. spinigerum&quot;. &quot;Monopterus albus&quot; is an invasive species in North America, but no &quot;Gnathostoma&quot; infections in humans have yet been conclusively identified in the US.

It is unclear if humans can be infected from drinking water contaminated with infected copepods.

==Hosts==

===Intermediate host===
The primary intermediate host is the minute crustaceans of the genus &quot;Cyclops&quot;. These crustaceans are then ingested by a second intermediate host, such as frogs and freshwater fish. Paratenic hosts are usually animals that prey on second intermediate hosts, such as snakes and birds.

===Definitive host===
The definitive hosts for gnathostomiasis include omnivorous or carnivorous mammals such as cats, dogs, tigers, leopards, lions, mink, opossums or raccoons. Humans are accidental hosts, not definitive hosts.

==Incubation period==
The incubation period for gnathostomiasis is 3–4 weeks when the larvae begin to migrate through the subcutaneous tissue of the body.

==Morphology==
The adult parasite is reddish-brown and has a globular cephalic dome separated from the rest of the body by constriction. The posterior portion of the nematode is smooth. At the same time, the anterior half is covered with fine leaf-like spines. The head is round and contains 4 to 8 transverse rows of hooklets protected by a pair of fleshy lips. The males are shorter than the females, compared to respectively. Eggs are oval and have a mucoid plug at one end.

==Life cycle==

===Life cycle in definitive hosts===
Adult worms are found in a tumor located in the gastric wall of the definitive hosts and release eggs into the host&#x27;s digestive tract. The eggs are then released with feces and in about a week hatch in water to develop into first stage larvae. Larvae are then ingested by minute copepods of the genus &quot;Cyclops&quot;. Once entering the copepod, the larvae penetrate the gastric wall of their intermediate host and begin to develop into second-stage and even early third-stage larvae. The copepods are ingested by a second intermediate host such as fish, frogs, or snakes. Within this second intermediate or definitive host the larva repeat a similar pattern of penetrating the gastric wall but then continue to migrate to muscular tissue and develop into advanced third-stage larvae. These larvae then encyst within the musculature of the new host. If the cyst containing flesh of these hosts is ingested by a definitive host, such as dogs, and cats, the cysts are ingested and the larvae escape the cysts and penetrate the gastric wall. These released larvae travel to the connective tissue and muscle as observed before and after 4 weeks they return to the gastric wall as adults. Here they form a tumor and continue to mature into adults for the next 6–8 months. Worms mate and females begin to excrete fertilized eggs with feces 8–12 months after ingestion of cysts. They are passed out in the feces and eaten by another fish.

=== Life cycle in humans ===
Infection of humans by gnathostomiasis is accidental because humans are not one of the definitive hosts of the parasite and do not allow the parasite to complete its life cycle. Infection in humans follows ingestion of raw or insufficiently cooked infected intermediate hosts. The ingested third-stage larva migrates from the gastric wall and its migration results in the symptoms associated with infection by gnathostomiasis. The third-stage larvae don&#x27;t return to the gastric wall preventing it from maturing into adult worms, leaving the life cycle incomplete. Instead, the larvae continue to migrate unpredictably unable to develop into adults, so eggs are seldom found in diagnostic tests or human feces. This also means the number of worms present in humans is a reflection of the number of third-stage larvae ingested.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of gnathostomiasis is possible (with microscopy) after removal of the worm.
The primary form of diagnosis of gnathostomiasis is the identification of a larva in the tissue. Serological testing such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or the Western blot are also reliable but may not be easily accessible in endemic areas.

CT scanning or MRI can be used to help identify a soft tissue worm and when looking at CNS disease it can be used to reveal the presence of the worm. The presence of haemorrhagic tracks on gradient-echo T2-weighted MRI is characteristic and possibly diagnostic.

==Prevention==
The best strategy for preventing accidental infection of humans is to educate those living in endemic areas to only consume fully cooked meat. The inability of the parasite to complete its life cycle within humans means that transmission can easily be contained by adequate preparation of meat from intermediate hosts. This is especially useful because of the difficulty and lack of feasibility inherent in eliminating all intermediate hosts of gnathostomiasis. So instead, individuals in endemic areas should avoid eating raw and undercooked meat in endemic areas, but this may be difficult in these areas.

The dish ceviche is native to Peru and a favorite of Mexico. It consists of onion, cubed fish, lime or lemon juice and Andean spices including salt and chili. The ingredients are mixed and marinated for several hours before being served at room temperature. Then in endemic areas in Southeast Asia, there are traditional dishes associated with these areas that also include raw uncooked fish, such as koipla in Thailand, goi ca song in Vietnam, sashimi and sushi in Japan.

Acknowledging these cultural traditions, individuals in these cultures can be educated on adapting their food preparation activities to remove the larvae without greatly altering these traditional dishes. For instance, meat should be marinated in vinegar for six hours or in soy sauce for 12 hours to kill the larvae successfully. In areas with reliable electricity, meat can be frozen at -20 degrees Celsius for 3–5 days to achieve the same results of killing the larvae present.

==Treatment==
Surgical removal or treatment with albendazole or ivermectin is recommended. The most prescribed treatment for gnathostomiasis is surgical removal of the larvae but this is only effective when the worms are located in an accessible location. In addition to surgical excision, albendazole and ivermectin have been noted in their ability to eliminate the parasite. Albendazole is administered at 400 mg daily for 21 days as an adjunct to surgical excision, while ivermectin is better tolerated as a single dose. Ivermectin can also serve as a replacement for those that can&#x27;t handle albendazole 200 ug/kg p.o. as a single dose. Ivermectin is less effective than albendazole.

== Epidemiology ==
Endemic areas include Asia, Mexico, India and parts of South Africa. Originally believed to be confined to Asia, in the 1970s gnathostomiasis was discovered in Mexico, and found in Australia in 2011. Even though it is endemic in areas of Southeast Asia and Latin America, it is an uncommon disease. However, researchers have noticed recently an increase in incidence. This disease is most common in both Thailand and Japan. In Thailand, it is the most common cause of central nervous system parasitic infections. As of 2009, 23 cases in China were reported in Chinese literature. As of 2020, about 5,000 cases of Gnathostomiasis have been reported globally.

==History==
The first case of &quot;Gnathostoma&quot; infection was identified by Sir Richard Owen when inspecting the stomach of a young tiger that had died at London Zoo from a ruptured aorta. However it was not until 1889 that the first human case was described by Levinson when he found the &quot;Gnathostoma&quot; larva in an infested Thai woman. The lifecycle of &quot;G. spinigerum&quot; was described by Svasti Daengsvang and Chalerm Prommas from Thailand in 1933 and 1936. This delay in identification of the parasite in humans is because humans are not a definitive host for this parasite making infection from this parasite rare. Gnathostomiasis infection is rare because the parasite must be digested when it has reached its third larvae stage, providing only a short time in which the parasite can infect humans. It is uncommon for the larvae to penetrate the skin of individuals exposed to contaminated food or water without ingestion.

<text>Fasciolosis is a parasitic worm infection caused by the common liver fluke &quot;Fasciola hepatica&quot; as well as by &quot;Fasciola gigantica&quot;. The disease is a plant-borne trematode zoonosis, and is classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD). It affects humans, but its main host is ruminants such as cattle and sheep. The disease progresses through four distinct phases; an initial incubation phase of between a few days up to three months with little or no symptoms; an invasive or acute phase which may manifest with: fever, malaise, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, urticaria, anemia, jaundice, and respiratory symptoms. The disease later progresses to a latent phase with fewer symptoms and ultimately into a chronic or obstructive phase months to years later. In the chronic state the disease causes inflammation of the bile ducts, gall bladder and may cause gall stones as well as fibrosis. While chronic inflammation is connected to increased cancer rates, it is unclear whether fasciolosis is associated with increased cancer risk.
Up to half of those infected display no symptoms, and diagnosis is difficult because the worm eggs are often missed in fecal examination. The methods of detection are through fecal examination, parasite-specific antibody detection, or radiological diagnosis, as well as laparotomy. In case of a suspected outbreak it may be useful to keep track of dietary history, which is also useful for the exclusion of differential diagnoses. Fecal examination is generally not helpful because the worm eggs can seldom be detected in the chronic phase of the infection. Eggs appear in the feces first between 9–11 weeks post-infection. The cause of this is unknown, and it is also difficult to distinguish between the different species of fasciola as well as distinguishing them from echinostomes and &quot;Fasciolopsis&quot;. Most immunodiagnostic tests detect infection with very high sensitivity, and as concentration drops after treatment, it is a very good diagnostic method. Clinically it is not possible to differentiate from other liver and bile diseases. Radiological methods can detect lesions in both acute and chronic infections, while laparotomy will detect lesions and also occasionally eggs and live worms.
Because of the size of the parasite, as adult &quot;F. hepatica&quot;: or adult &quot;F. gigantica:&quot; , fasciolosis is a big concern. The amount of symptoms depends on how many worms and what stage the infection is in. The death rate is significant in both cattle (67.55%) and goats (24.61%), but generally low among humans. Treatment with triclabendazole has been highly effective against the adult worms as well as various developing stages. Praziquantel is not effective, and older drugs such as bithionol are moderately effective but also cause more side effects. Secondary bacterial infection causing cholangitis has also been a concern and can be treated with antibiotics, and toxaemia may be treated with prednisolone.
Humans are infected by eating watergrown plants, primarily wild-grown watercress in Europe or morning glory in Asia. Infection may also occur by drinking contaminated water with floating young fasciola or when using utensils washed with contaminated water. Cultivated plants do not spread the disease in the same capacity. Human infection is rare, even if the infection rate is high among animals. Especially high rates of human infection have been found in Bolivia, Peru, and Egypt, and this may be due to consumption of certain foods. No vaccine is available to protect people against &quot;Fasciola&quot; infection. Preventative measures are primarily treating and immunization of the livestock, which are required to host the live cycle of the worms. Veterinary vaccines are in development, and their use is being considered by several countries on account of the risk to human health and economic losses resulting from livestock infection. Other methods include using molluscicides to decrease the number of snails that act as vectors, but it is not practical. Educational methods to decrease consumption of wild watercress and other water plants have been shown to work in areas with a high disease burden.

Fascioliasis occurs in Europe, Africa, the Americas as well as Oceania. Recently, worldwide losses in animal productivity due to fasciolosis were conservatively estimated at over US$3.2 billion per annum. Fasciolosis is now recognized as an emerging human disease: the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that 2.4 million people are infected with &quot;Fasciola&quot;, and a further 180 million are at risk of infection.
==Signs and symptoms==
===Humans===
 The course of fasciolosis in humans has 4 main phases:
* Incubation phase: from the ingestion of metacercariae to the appearance of the first symptoms; period: few days to 3 months; depends on the number of ingested metacercariae and immune status of the host
* Invasive or acute phase: fluke migration up to the bile ducts. This phase is a result of the mechanical destruction of the hepatic tissue and the peritoneum by migrating juvenile flukes causing localized and or generalized toxic and allergic reactions. The major symptoms of this phase are:
** Fever: usually the first symptom of the disease; 
** Abdominal pain
** Gastrointestinal disturbances: loss of appetite, flatulence, nausea, diarrhea
** Urticaria
** Respiratory symptoms (very rare): cough, dyspnoea, chest pain, hemoptysis
** Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly
** Ascites
** Anaemia
** Jaundice
* Latent phase: This phase can last for months or years. The proportion of asymptomatic subjects in this phase is unknown. They are often discovered during family screening after a patient is diagnosed.
* Chronic or obstructive phase:
This phase may develop months or years after the initial infection. Adult flukes in the bile ducts cause inflammation and hyperplasia of the epithelium. The resulting cholangitis and cholecystitis, combined with the large body of the flukes, are sufficient to cause mechanical obstruction of the biliary duct. In this phase, biliary colic, epigastric pain, fatty food intolerance, nausea, jaundice, pruritus, right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness, etc., are clinical manifestations indistinguishable from cholangitis, cholecystitis and cholelithiasis of other origins. Hepatic enlargement may be associated with an enlarged spleen or ascites. In case of obstruction, the gall bladder is usually enlarged and edematous with thickening of the wall (Ref: Hepatobiliary Fascioliasis:
Sonographic and CT Findings in 87 Patients During the InitialPhase and Long-Term Follow-Up. Adnan Kabaalioglu, Kagan Ceken, Emel Alimoglu, Rabin Saba, Metin Cubuk, Gokhan Arslan, Ali Apaydin. AJR 2007; 189:824–828). Fibrous adhesions of the gall bladder to adjacent organs are common. Lithiasis of the bile duct or gall bladder is frequent and the stones are usually small and multiple.

===Other animals===
Veterinary clinical signs of fasciolosis are always closely associated with infectious dose (amount of ingested metacercariae). In sheep, as the most common definitive host, the clinical presentation is divided into 4 types:
* Acute Type I Fasciolosis: infectious dose is more than 5000 ingested metacercariae. Sheep suddenly die without any previous clinical signs. Ascites, abdominal haemorrhage, icterus, pallor of membranes, weakness may be observed in sheep.
* Acute Type II Fasciolosis: infectious dose is 1000-5,000 ingested metacercariae. As above, sheep die but briefly show pallor, loss of condition, and ascites.
* Subacute Fasciolosis: infectious dose is 800-1000 ingested metacercariae. Sheep are lethargic, anemic, and may die. Weight loss is a dominant feature.
* Chronic Fasciolosis: infectious dose is 200-800 ingested metacercariae. The asymptomatic or gradual development of bottle jaw and ascites (ventral edema), emaciation, and weight loss.

In blood, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and eosinophilia may be observed in all types of fasciolosis. Elevation of liver enzyme activities, such as glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), is detected in subacute or chronic fasciolosis from 12 to 15 weeks after ingestion of metacercariae. Economical effect of fasciolosis in sheep consists in sudden deaths of animals as well as in the reduction of weight gain and wool production. In goats and cattle, the clinical manifestation is similar to sheep. However, acquired resistance to &quot;F. hepatica&quot; infection is well-known in adult cattle. Calves are susceptible to disease but more than 1000 metacercariae are usually required to cause clinical fasciolosis. In this case, the disease is similar to sheep and is characterized by weight loss, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and (after infection with 10,000 metacercariae) death. The Importance of cattle fasciolosis consists in economic losses caused by condemnation of livers at slaughter and production losses especially due to reduced weight gain.

In sheep and sometimes cattle, the damaged liver tissue may become infected by the &quot;Clostridium&quot; bacteria &quot;C. novyi&quot; type B. The bacteria will release toxins into the bloodstream resulting in what is known as black disease. There is no cure and death follows quickly. As &quot;C. novyi&quot; is common in the environment, black disease is found wherever populations of liver flukes and sheep overlap.

==Cause==

Fasciolosis is caused by two digenetic trematodes &quot;F. hepatica&quot; and &quot;F. gigantica&quot;. Adult flukes of both species are localized in the bile ducts of the liver or gallbladder. &quot;F. hepatica&quot; measures 2 to 3 cm and has a cosmopolitan distribution. &quot;F. gigantica&quot; measures 4 to 10 cm in length and the distribution of the species is limited to the tropics and has been recorded in Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and South and Eastern Asia. In domestic livestock in Japan, diploid (2n = 20), triploid (3n = 30) and chimeric flukes (2n/3n) have been described, many of which reproduce parthenogenetically. As a result of this unclear classification, flukes in Japan are normally referred to as &quot;Fasciola&quot; spp. Recent reports based on mitochondrial genes analysis have shown that Japanese &quot;Fasciola&quot; spp. is more closely related to &quot;F. gigantica&quot; than to &quot;F. hepatica&quot;. In India, a species called &quot;F. jacksoni&quot; was described in elephants.

===Transmission===
Human &quot;F. hepatica&quot; infection is determined by the presence of the intermediate snail hosts, domestic herbivorous animals, climatic conditions, and the dietary habits of man. Sheep, goats and cattle are considered the predominant animal reservoirs. While other animals can be infected, they are usually not very important for human disease transmission. On the other hand, some authors have observed that donkeys and pigs contribute to disease transmission in Bolivia. Among wild animals, it has been demonstrated that the peridomestic rat (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;) may play an important role in the spread as well as in the transmission of the parasite in Corsica. In France, nutria (&quot;Myocastor coypus&quot;) was confirmed as a wild reservoir host of &quot;F. hepatica&quot;. Humans are infected by ingestion of aquatic plants that contain the infectious cercariae. Several species of aquatic vegetables are known as a vehicle of human infection. In Europe, &quot;Nasturtium officinale&quot; (common watercress), &quot;Nasturtium sylvestre&quot;, &quot;Rorippa amphibia&quot; (wild watercress), &quot;Taraxacum dens leonis&quot; (dandelion leaves), &quot;Valerianella olitoria&quot; (lamb&#x27;s lettuce), and &quot;Mentha viridis&quot; (spearmint) were reported as a source of human infections. In the Northern Bolivian Altiplano, some authors suggested that several aquatic plants such as bero-bero (watercress), algas (algae), kjosco and tortora could act as a source of infection for humans. Because &quot;F. hepatica&quot; cercariae also encyst on water surface, humans can be infected by drinking of fresh untreated water containing cercariae. In addition, an experimental study suggested that humans consuming raw liver dishes from fresh livers infected with juvenile flukes could become infected.

Intermediate hosts of &quot;F. hepatica&quot; are freshwater snails from family Lymnaeidae. Snails from family Planorbidae act as an intermediate host of &quot;F. hepatica&quot; very occasionally.

==Mechanism==
The development of infection in a definitive host is divided into two phases: the parenchymal (migratory) phase and the biliary phase. The parenchymal phase begins when excysted juvenile flukes penetrate the intestinal wall. After the penetration of the intestine, flukes migrate within the abdominal cavity and penetrate the liver or other organs. &quot;F. hepatica&quot; has a strong predilection for the tissues of the liver. Occasionally, ectopic locations of flukes such as the lungs, diaphragm, intestinal wall, kidneys, and subcutaneous tissue can occur. During the migration of flukes, tissues are mechanically destroyed and inflammation appears around migratory tracks of flukes. The second phase (the biliary phase) begins when parasites enter the biliary ducts of the liver. In biliary ducts, flukes mature, feed on blood, and produce eggs. Hypertrophy of biliary ducts associated with obstruction of the lumen occurs as a result of tissue damage.

===Resistance to infection===
Mechanisms of resistance have been studied by several authors in different animal species. These studies may help to better understand the immune response to &quot;F. hepatica&quot; in the host and are necessary for the development of a vaccine against the parasite. It has been established that cattle acquire resistance to challenge infection with &quot;F. hepatica&quot; and &quot;F. gigantica&quot; when they have been sensitized with primary patent or drug-abbreviated infection. Resistance to fasciolosis was also documented in rats. On the other hand, sheep and goats are not resistant to re-infection with &quot;F. hepatica&quot;. However, there is evidence that two sheep breeds, in particular Indonesian thin tail sheep and Red maasai sheep, are resistant to &quot;F. gigantica&quot;.

==Diagnosis==
Most immunodiagnostic tests will detect infection and have a sensitivity above 90% during all stages of the disease. In addition, antibody concentration quickly drops post-treatment and no antibodies are present one year after treatment, which makes it a very good diagnostic method. In humans, diagnosis of fasciolosis is usually achieved parasitologically by findings the fluke eggs in stool, and immunologically by ELISA and Western blot. Coprological examinations of stool alone are generally not adequate because infected humans have important clinical presentations long before eggs are found in the stools.

Moreover, in many human infections, the fluke eggs are often not found in the faeces, even after multiple faecal examinations. Furthermore, eggs of &quot;F. hepatica&quot;, &quot;F. gigantica&quot; and &quot;Fasciolopsis buski&quot; are morphologically indistinguishable. Therefore, immunological methods such as ELISA and enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot, also called Western blot, are the most important methods in the diagnosis of &quot;F. hepatica&quot; infection. These immunological tests are based on the detection of species-specific antibodies from sera. The antigenic preparations used have been primarily derived from extracts of excretory/secretory products from adult worms, or with partially purified fractions. Recently, purified native and recombinant antigens have been used, e.g. recombinant &quot;F. hepatica&quot; cathepsin L-like protease.

Methods based on antigen detection (circulating in serum or faeces) are less frequent. In addition, biochemical and haematological examinations of human sera support the exact diagnosis (eosinophilia, elevation of liver enzymes). Ultrasonography and xray of the abdominal cavity, biopsy of the liver, and gallbladder punctuate can also be used (ref: US-guided gallbladder aspiration:
a new diagnostic method for biliary fascioliasis. A. Kabaalioglu, A. Apaydin, T. Sindel, E. Lüleci. Eur. Radiol. 9, 880±882 (1999) . False fasciolosis (pseudofasciolosis) refers to the presence of eggs in the stool resulting not from an actual infection but from recent ingestion of infected livers containing eggs. This situation (with its potential for misdiagnosis) can be avoided by having the patient follow a liver-free diet several days before a repeat stool examination.

In animals, intravital diagnosis is based predominantly on faeces examinations and immunological methods. However, clinical signs, biochemical and haematological profile, season, climate conditions, epidemiology situation, and examinations of snails must be considered. Similarly to humans, faeces examinations are not reliable. Moreover, the fluke eggs are detectable in faeces 8–12 weeks post-infection. Despite that fact, faecal examination is still the only used diagnostic tool in some countries. While coprological diagnosis of fasciolosis is possible from 8- to 12 weeks post-infection (WPI), &quot;F. hepatica&quot; specific-antibodies are recognized using ELISA or Western blot after 2-4 weeks post-infection. Therefore, these methods provide early detection of the infection.

==Prevention==
In some areas, special control programs are in place or have been planned. The types of control measures depend on the setting (such as epidemiologic, ecologic, and cultural factors). Strict control of the growth and sale of watercress and other edible water plants is important. Individual people can protect themselves by not eating raw watercress and other water plants, especially from endemic grazing areas. Travelers to areas with poor sanitation should avoid food and water that might be contaminated (tainted). Vegetables grown in fields, that might have been irrigated with polluted water, should be thoroughly cooked, as should viscera from potentially infected animals.

==Treatment==
===Humans===
Several drugs are effective for fascioliasis, both in humans and in domestic animals. The drug of choice in the treatment of fasciolosis is triclabendazole, a member of the benzimidazole family of anthelmintics. The drug works by preventing the polymerization of the molecule tubulin into the cytoskeletal structures, microtubules. Resistance of &quot;F. hepatica&quot; to triclabendazole has been recorded in Australia in 1995 and Ireland in 1998.

Praziquantel treatment is ineffective. There are case reports of nitazoxanide being successfully used in human fasciolosis treatment in Mexico. There are also reports of bithionol being used successfully.

Nitazoxanide has been found effective in trials, but is currently not recommended.

===Domestic animals===
Only clorsulon and albendazole are approved for use in the treatment of domestic animals in the United States, but the available flukicides used worldwide also include triclabendazole, netobimin, closantel, rafoxanide, nitroxynil, and oxyclozanide; however, this list of available drugs has some drawbacks. Closantel, nitroxynil, and oxyclozanide are not effective against young liver flukes and should only be used to treat subacute and chronic infections. Triclabendazole is effective at killing flukes of any age, but over-use has resulted in increasing resistance to this drug, so it should only be used to treat early infections, with later stages treated with other fasciolicides. The timing of treatment is critical for success, and is determined by environmental factors and analysis of the expected distribution and prevalence of the disease. For example, in European countries that have large numbers of sheep, computerized systems predict when fascioliasis is most likely to make the biggest impact on sheep populations and how many sheep will most likely be affected. The predictions are dependent on guessing when environmental conditions that are most conducive to parasite multiplication will occur, such as the amount of rainfall, evapotranspiration, and the ratio of wet to dry days in a particular month. If heavy infections are expected to occur, treatment for sheep should begin in September/October, then again in January/February, and finally in April/May; the amount of hatching fluke eggs is minimal during these times because they require a warm, wet environment, making treatment more effective.

==Epidemiology==
Human and animal fasciolosis occurs worldwide. While animal fasciolosis is distributed in countries with high cattle and sheep production, human fasciolosis occurs, excepting Western Europe, in developing countries. Fasciolosis occurs only in areas where suitable conditions for intermediate hosts exist.

Studies carried out in recent years have shown human fasciolosis to be an important public health problem. Human fasciolosis has been reported by countries in Europe, America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. The incidence of human cases has been increasing in 51 countries of the five continents. A global analysis shows that the expected correlation between animal and human fasciolosis only appears at a basic level. High prevalences in humans are not necessarily found in areas where fasciolosis is a great veterinary problem. For instance, in South America, hyperendemics and mesoendemics are found in Bolivia and Peru where the veterinary problem is less important, while in countries such as Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile, human fasciolosis is only sporadic or hypoendemic.

===Europe===
In Europe, human fasciolosis occurs mainly in France, Spain, Portugal, and the former USSR. France is considered an important human endemic area. A total of 5863 cases of human fasciolosis were recorded from nine French hospitals from 1970 to 1982. Concerning the former Soviet Union, almost all reported cases were from the Tajik Republic. Several papers referred to human fasciolosis in Turkey. Recently, serological survey of human fasciolosis was performed in some parts of Turkey. The prevalence of the disease was serologically found to be 3.01% in Antalya Province, and between 0.9 and 6.1% in Isparta Province, Mediterranean region of Turkey. In other European countries, fasciolosis is sporadic and the occurrence of the disease is usually combined with travelling to endemic areas.

===Americas===
In North America, the disease is very sporadic. In Mexico, 53 cases have been reported. In Central America, fasciolosis is a human health problem in the Caribbean islands, especially in the zones of Cuba. Pinar del Río Province and Villa Clara Province are Cuban regions where fasciolosis was hyperendemic. In South America, human fasciolosis is a serious problem in Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. These Andean countries are considered to be the areas with the highest prevalence of human fasciolosis in the world. Well-known human hyperendemic areas are localized predominately in the high plain called altiplano. In the Northern Bolivian Altiplano, prevalences detected in some communities were up to 72% and 100% in coprological and serological surveys, respectively. In Peru, &quot;F. hepatica&quot; in humans occurs throughout the country. The highest prevalences were reported in Arequipa, Mantaro Valley, Cajamarca Valley, and Puno Region. In other South American countries like Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia, human fasciolosis appear to be sporadic, despite the high prevalences of fasciolosis in cattle.

===Africa===
In Africa, human cases of fasciolosis, except in northern parts, have not been frequently reported. The highest prevalence was recorded in Egypt where the disease is distributed in communities living in the Nile Delta.

===Asia===
In Asia, the most human cases were reported in Iran, especially in Gīlān Province, on the Caspian Sea. It was mentioned that more than 10,000 human cases were detected in Iran. In eastern Asia, human fasciolosis appears to be sporadic. Few cases were documented in Japan, Koreas, Vietnam, and Thailand.

===Australia and the Oceania===
In Australia, human fasciolosis is very rare (only 12 cases documented). In New Zealand, &quot;F. hepatica&quot; has never been detected in humans.

==Other animals==
 Several drugs have been used to control fasciolosis in animals. Drugs differ in their efficacy, mode of action, price, and viability. Fasciolicides (drugs against Fasciola spp.) fall into five main chemical groups:
* Halogenated phenols: bithionol (Bitin), hexachlorophene (Bilevon), nitroxynil (Trodax)
* Salicylanilides: closantel (Flukiver, Supaverm), rafoxanide (Flukanide, Ranizole)
* Benzimidazoles: triclabendazole (Fasinex), albendazole (Vermitan, Valbazen), mebendazol (Telmin), luxabendazole (Fluxacur)
* Sulphonamides: clorsulon (Ivomec Plus)
* Phenoxyalkanes: diamphenetide (Coriban)

Triclabendazole (Fasinex) is considered the most common drug due to its high efficacy against adult as well as juvenile flukes. Triclabendazole is used in the control of fasciolosis of livestock in many countries. Nevertheless, long-term veterinary use of triclabendazole has caused the appearance of resistance in &quot;F. hepatica&quot;. In animals, triclabendazole resistance was first described in Australia, later in Ireland and Scotland and more recently in the Netherlands. Considering this fact, scientists have started to work on the development of new drug. Recently, a new fasciolicide was successfully tested in naturally and experimentally infected cattle in Mexico. This new drug is called &#x27;Compound Alpha&#x27; and is chemically very similar to triclabendazole. Countries where fasciolosis in livestock was repeatedly reported:
* Europe: UK, Ireland, France, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Netherlands, Germany, Poland
* Asia: Turkey, Russia, Thailand, Iraq, Iran, China, Vietnam, India, Nepal, Japan, Korea, Philippines
* Africa: Kenya, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Egypt, Gambia, Morocco
* Australia and the Oceania: Australia, New Zealand
* Americas: United States, Mexico, Cuba, Peru, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Jamaica, Brazil

On September 8, 2007, Veterinary officials in South Cotabato, Philippines said that laboratory tests on samples from cows, carabaos, and horses in the province&#x27;s 10 towns and lone city showed the level of infection at 89.5%, a sudden increase of positive cases among large livestock due to the erratic weather condition in the area. They must be treated forthwith to prevent complications with surra and hemorrhagic septicemia diseases. Surra already affected all barangays of the Surallah town.

<text>Fasciolopsiasis results from an infection by the trematode &quot;Fasciolopsis buski&quot;, the largest intestinal fluke of humans, growing up to long.

==Signs and symptoms==
Most infections are light, almost asymptomatic. In heavy infections, symptoms can include abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, anemia, ascites, toxemia, allergic responses, sensitization caused by the absorption of the worms&#x27; allergenic metabolites can lead to intestinal obstruction and may eventually cause death of the patient.

==Cause==

The parasite infects an amphibic snail (&quot;Segmentina nitidella, Segmentina hemisphaerula, Hippeutis schmackerie, Gyraulus, Lymnaea, Pila, Planorbis&quot; (&quot;Indoplanorbis&quot;)) after being released by infected mammalian feces; metacercaria released from this intermediate host encyst on aquatic plants like water spinach, which are eaten raw by pigs and humans. Water itself can also be infective when drunk unboiled (&quot;Encysted cercariae exist not only on aquatic plants, but also on the surface of the water.&quot;)

==Diagnosis==

Microscopic identification of eggs, or more rarely of the adult flukes, in the stool or vomitus is the basis of specific diagnosis. The eggs are indistinguishable from those of the very closely related &quot;Fasciola hepatica&quot; liver fluke, but that is largely inconsequential since treatment is essentially identical for both.

==Prevention==
Infection can be prevented by immersing vegetables in boiling water for a few seconds to kill the infective metacercariae, avoiding the use of untreated feces (&quot;nightsoil&quot;) as a fertilizer, and maintenance of proper sanitation and good hygiene. Additionally, snail control should be attempted.

==Treatment==
Praziquantel is the drug of choice for treatment. Treatment is effective in early or light infections. Heavy infections are more difficult to treat. Studies of the effectiveness of various drugs for treatment of children with &quot;F. buski&quot; have shown tetrachloroethylene as capable of reducing faecal egg counts by up to 99%. Other anthelmintics that can be used include thiabendazole, mebendazole, levamisole and pyrantel pamoate. Oxyclozanide, hexachlorophene and nitroxynil are also highly effective.

==Epidemiology==

&quot;F. buski&quot; is endemic in Asia including China, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and India. It has an up to 60% prevalence in worst-affected communities in southern and eastern India and mainland China and has an estimated 10 million human infections. Infections occur most often in school-aged children or in impoverished areas with a lack of proper sanitation systems.

A study from 1950s found that &quot;F. buski&quot; was endemic in central Thailand, affecting about 2,936 people due to infected aquatic plants called water caltrops and the snail hosts which were associated with them. The infection, or the eggs which hatch in the aquatic environment, were correlated with the water pollution in different districts of Thailand such as Ayuthaya Province. The high incidence of infection was prevalent in females and children ages 10–14 years of age.

<doc id="1043910" wikidata="Q5944495" url="?curid=1043910" title="Hunter Mutual">
<text>Hunter Mutual was a credit union based in and serving the Upper Hunter Valley of New South Wales, Australia. It was established in 1968 as the Upper Hunter Local Government Employee&#x27;s Credit Union. In 1971, it changed its name to the Upper Hunter Credit Union in 1971, and following a restructure of its operations in 2004, it took on the name Hunter Mutual. During the 1990s, when many major banks closed branches in small country towns, Hunter Mutual set up new branches areas within the Upper Hunter where this occurred.

==Merger==
In July 2009, a proposed merger between Hunter Mutual and the New England Credit Union was announced.

During December 2009, each credit union held their annual general meeting, with a majority of members (96% of Hunter Mutual members, 93% of NECU members) voting to approve the merger. The merger took effect on 1 January 2010, with Hunter Mutual members becoming members of New England Credit Union, with the two computer systems to be merged in March, followed by the introduction of NECU&#x27;s product range and fee structure. The merged entity has retained all locations. The combined company is the largest inland credit union in Australia.

The plan was that the New England and Orana Credit Union arms of NECU were to be re-branded as New England Mutual and Orana Mutual, mimicking the Hunter Mutual name. All three also had the common name of the Community Mutual Group which was later rebranded as the Regional Australia Bank.

<doc id="1043913" wikidata="Q5160454" url="?curid=1043913" title="Congenital syphilis">
<text>Congenital syphilis is syphilis that occurs when a mother with untreated syphilis passes the infection to her baby during pregnancy or at birth. It may present in the fetus, infant, or later. Clinical features vary and differ between early onset, that is presentation before 2-years of age, and late onset, presentation after age 2-years. Infection in the unborn baby may present as poor growth, non-immune hydrops leading to premature birth or loss of the baby, or no signs. Affected newborns mostly initially have no clinical signs. They may be small and irritable. Characteristic features include a rash, fever, large liver and spleen, a runny and congested nose, and inflammation around bone or cartilage. There may be jaundice, large glands, pneumonia (pneumonia alba), meningitis, warty bumps on genitals, deafness or blindness. Untreated babies that survive the early phase may develop skeletal deformities including deformity of the nose, lower legs, forehead, collar bone, jaw, and cheek bone. There may be a perforated or high arched palate, and recurrent joint disease. Other late signs include linear perioral tears, intellectual disability, hydrocephalus, and juvenile general paresis. Seizures and cranial nerve palsies may first occur in both early and late phases. Eighth nerve palsy, interstitial keratitis and small notched teeth may appear individually or together; known as Hutchinson&#x27;s triad.

It is caused by the bacterium &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; subspecies &quot;pallidum&quot; when it infects the baby after crossing the placenta or from contact with a syphilitic sore at birth. It is not transmitted during breastfeeding unless there is an open sore on the mother&#x27;s breast. The unborn baby can become infected at any time during the pregnancy. Most cases occur due to inadequate antenatal screening and treatment during pregnancy. The baby is highly infectious if the rash and snuffles are present. The disease may be suspected from tests on the mother; blood tests and ultrasound. Tests on the baby may include blood tests, CSF analysis and medical imaging. Findings may reveal anemia and low platelets. Other findings may include low sugars, proteinuria and hypopituitarism. The placenta may appear large and pale. Other investigations include testing for HIV. 

Prevention is by safe sex to prevent syphilis in the mother, and early screening and treatment of syphilis in pregnancy. One intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin G administered to a pregnant woman early in the illness can prevent congenital syphilis in her baby. Treatment of suspected congenital syphilis is with penicillin by injection; benzylpenicillin into vein, or procaine benzylpenicillin into muscle. During times of penicillin unavailability, ceftriaxone may be an alternative. Where there is penicillin allergy, antimicrobial desensitisation is an option.

Syphilis affects around one million pregnancies a year. In 2016, there were around 473 cases of congenital syphilis per 100,000 live births and 204,000 deaths from the disease worldwide. Of the 660,000 congenital syphilis cases reported in 2016, 143,000 resulted in deaths of unborn babies, 61,000 deaths of newborn babies, 41,000 low birth weights or preterm births, and 109,000 young children diagnosed with congenital syphilis. Around 75% were from the WHO&#x27;s African and Eastern Mediterranean regions. Serological tests for syphilis were introduced in 1906, and it was later shown that transmission occurred from the mother.

==Signs and symptoms==

Untreated early syphilis infections results in a high risk of poor pregnancy outcomes, including saddle nose, lower extremity abnormalities, miscarriages, premature births, stillbirths, or death in newborns. Some infants with congenital syphilis have symptoms at birth, but many develop symptoms later. Symptoms may include rash, fever, large liver and spleen, and skeletal abnormalities. Newborns will typically not develop a primary syphilitic chancre but may present with signs of secondary syphilis (i.e. generalized body rash). Often these babies will develop syphilitic rhinitis (&quot;snuffles&quot;), the mucus from which is laden with the &quot;T. pallidum&quot; bacterium, and therefore highly infectious. If a baby with congenital syphilis is not treated early, damage to the bones, teeth, eyes, ears, and brain can occur.

Neurosyphilis in newborns may present as cranial nerve palsies, cerebral infarcts (strokes), seizures or eye abnormalities.

Many newborns with congenital syphilis, 55% by some estimates, do not exhibit any symptoms initially, with signs and symptoms developing days to months later.

===Early===
Newborns may be asymptomatic and are only identified on routine prenatal screening. If not identified and treated, these newborns develop poor feeding and runny nose. By definition, early congenital syphilis occurs in children between 0 and 2 years old.

===Late===
Congenital syphilis that is diagnosed after 2 years of age, either because it was not diagnosed earlier or because it was incompletely treated, is classified as late congenital syphilis. The signs of late congenital syphilis tend to reflect early damage to developing tissues that does not become apparent until years later, such as Hutchinson&#x27;s triad of Hutchinson&#x27;s teeth (notched incisors), keratitis and deafness.

Symptoms include:
* Blunted upper incisor teeth known as Hutchinson&#x27;s teeth, or mulberry molars
* Deafness from auditory nerve disease
* Frontal bossing (prominence of the brow ridge)
* Hard palate defect
* Inflammation of the cornea known as interstitial keratitis
* Protruding mandible
* Saber shins
* Saddle nose (collapse of the bony part of nose)
* Short maxillae
* Swollen knees

Treatment (with penicillin) before the development of late symptoms is essential.

Clinical signs include:
* Abnormal bone x-rays
* Anemia
* Cerebral palsy
* Du Bois sign, shortening of the little finger
* Enlarged liver
* Enlarged spleen
* Frontal bossing
* Sensorineural hearing loss
* Higouménakis&#x27; sign, enlargement of the sternal end of clavicle in late congenital syphilis, mostly on the right-hand side
* Hutchinson&#x27;s triad, a set of symptoms consisting of deafness, Hutchinson&#x27;s teeth (centrally notched, widely spaced peg-shaped upper central incisors), and interstitial keratitis (IK), an inflammation of the cornea which can lead to corneal scarring and potential blindness
* Hydrocephalus
* Jaundice
* Lymph node enlargement
* Mulberry molars (permanent first molars with multiple poorly developed cusps)
* Musculoskeletal deformities
* Petechiae
* Poorly developed maxillae
* Pseudoparalysis
* Rhagades, linear scars at the angles of the mouth and nose result from bacterial infection of skin lesions
* Snuffles, aka &quot;syphilitic rhinitis&quot;, which appears similar to the rhinitis of the common cold, except it is more severe, lasts longer, often involves bloody rhinorrhea, and is often associated with laryngitis
* Sabre shins, malformation of the tibia
* Skin rash or other skin changes such as rhagades

Death from congenital syphilis is usually due to bleeding into the lungs.

==Transmission==
Syphilis may be transmitted from mother to the fetus during any stage of pregnancy. It is most commonly transmitted via cross placental transfer of &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; bacteria from mother to the fetus during pregnancy with transmission via exposure to genital lesions during childbirth being less common. The highest rate of transmission occurs in mothers with early syphilis (infection present for less than 1 year), which is responsible for 50-70% of infections, with syphilis being present for more than 1 year thought to be responsible for about 15% of transmission. It is not transmitted during breastfeeding unless there is an open sore on the mother&#x27;s breast.

==Diagnosis==
Direct observation of &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; from one of the lesions in the mother or infant is diagnostic and can be carried out using dark field microscopy, direct fluorescent antibody testing or immunohistochemical staining, however these tests are not readily available in many settings. Serological testing is more commonly carried out on the mother and the infant to diagnose maternal and congenital syphilis. In the mother, a serologic diagnosis of syphilis is made using a nontreponemal test for syphilis such as the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL) or Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) followed by a treponemal test, such as the &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) (the sequence of testing may be reversed with a treponemal test followed by a non-treponemal test in the reverse diagnostic sequence). Positivity of both tests indicates active syphilis or previous infection that was treated. Quantitative non-treponemal tests are monitored for disease activity and response to treatment, with RPR is expected to decrease by a factor of four compared to pre-treatment levels after successful treatment of syphilis in the mother. Failure of non-treponemal titers to decrease after treatment may indicate treatment failure or re-infection. A confirmed cure in the mother does not exclude the possibility of congenital syphilis as transmission to the fetus may have occurred prior to maternal cure.

Diagnosis of congenital syphilis in the fetus is based on a combination of laboratory, imaging and physical exam findings. Ultrasound findings associated with congenital syphilis intrauterine infection (which are seen after 18 weeks gestation) include fetal hepatomegaly (enlarged liver)(seen in greater than 80% of cases), anemia (as measured by the peak systolic velocity of the middle cerebral artery)(33%), placentomegaly(an enlarged placenta)(27%), polyhydramnios (an excess of amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac)(12%) and hydrops fetalis (edema in the fetus)(10%). The absence of these ultrasound findings does not rule out congenital syphilis in the fetus. These ultrasound abnormalities usually resolve several weeks after successful treatment of syphilis in the mother.

Immunohistochemical staining or nucleic acid amplification of the amniotic fluid may also aid in the diagnosis. Diagnosis of syphilis in the neonate may be challenging as maternal treponemal antibodies (as non-treponemal titers) can cross the placenta and persist in the infant for many months after birth in the absence of neonatal syphilis, complicating the diagnosis. The passively transferred non-treponemal titers should be cleared from the infant within 15 months of birth (with most titers being cleared by 6 months), and persistently elevated titers 6 months after birth should prompt investigation into neonatal syphilis including CSF analysis for neurosyphilis. Pleocytosis, raised CSF protein level and positive CSF serology suggest neurosyphilis. CSF VDRL is 50-90% specific for neurosyphilis. 60% of newborns with congenital syphilis also have neurosyphilis. Non-treponemal titers should be monitored in the newborns every 2-3 months to ensure an adequate response to treatment.

==Treatment==

If a pregnant mother is identified as being infected with syphilis, treatment can effectively prevent congenital syphilis from developing in the fetus, especially if she is treated before the sixteenth week of pregnancy or at least 30 days prior to delivery. Mothers with primary syphilis can be treated with a single dose of intramuscularly injected penicillin, whereas late-latent, secondary syphilis, or disease of an unknown duration is treated with once weekly penicillin injections for three weeks. The mother&#x27;s partner should also be evaluated and treated.

The fetus is at greatest risk of contracting syphilis when the mother is in the early stages of infection, but the disease can be passed at any point during pregnancy, even during delivery. An affected child can be treated using antibiotics much like an adult; however, any developmental symptoms are likely to be permanent.

The greater the duration between the infection of the mother and conception, the better the outcome for the infant including less chance of stillbirth or developing congenital syphilis.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends treating symptomatic or babies born to an infected mother with unknown treatment status with procaine penicillin G, 50,000 U/kg dose IM a day in a single dose for 10 days. Treatment for these babies can vary on a case-by-case basis. Treatment cannot reverse any deformities, brain, or permanent tissue damage that has already occurred.

A Cochrane review found that antibiotics may be effective for serological cure but in general the evidence around the effectiveness of antibiotics for congenital syphilis is uncertain due to the poor methodological quality of the small number of trials that have been conducted.

Up to 40% of pregnant women treated for congenital syphilis will develop a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which is a temporary reaction that usually occurs within a few hours of starting penicillin and resolves by 24 hours. The reaction is characterized by cramping, fever, muscle aches and a rash. Treatment is supportive and fetal heart rate monitoring is recommended.

==Epidemiology==
Syphilis affects around one million pregnancies a year. In 2016, there were around 473 cases of congenital syphilis per 100,000 live births and 204,000 deaths from the disease worldwide. Of the 660,000 congenital syphilis cases reported in 2016, 143,000 resulted in deaths of unborn babies, 61,000 deaths of newborn babies, 41,000 low birth weights or preterm births, and 109,000 young children diagnosed with congenital syphilis. Around 75% were from the WHO&#x27;s African and Eastern Mediterranean regions.

Cases of congenital syphilis in the United States have been rising since the early 2010s. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 918 cases for 2017, which is more than twice the yearly incidence of the preceding four years. The incidence in the United States has increased by 754% from 2012 to 2021 with a higher incidence seen in those with a lower socioeconomic status, as well as Black people, Native Americans and Native Hawaiians. Reports in 2023 show a rise of more than 900 percent in Mississippi over the preceding five years.

==History==
Congenital syphilis was first described in Europe during the fifteenth century by the Spanish physician . Nineteenth century physicians held the belief that congenital syphilis was contracted from contaminated semen at time of conception. Serological tests for syphilis were introduced in 1906, and it was later shown that transmission occurred from the mother.

<doc id="1043919" wikidata="Q1270992" url="?curid=1043919" title="Döhle bodies">
<text>Döhle bodies are light blue-gray, oval, basophilic, leukocyte inclusions located in the peripheral cytoplasm of neutrophils. They measure 1–3 μm in diameter. Not much is known about their formation, but they are thought to be remnants of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

They are named after German pathologist, Karl Gottfried Paul Döhle (1855–1928). They are often present in conjunction with toxic granulation. However, it has been found that certain healthy individuals may have persistent Döhle bodies found in neutrophils.

==Associated conditions==
They are seen in:
* Burns
* Infection
* Physical trauma
* Neoplastic diseases
* Fanconi syndrome
* May–Hegglin anomaly
* Chédiak–Steinbrinck–Rayer-Buchanan-Higashi&#x27;s syndrome
* Leukemoid reaction

==Pathophysiology==
The presence of Döhle bodies in mature and immature neutrophils on a blood smear can be normal if they are present only in small numbers. They are also normally more abundant in cats and horses. Döhle bodies are intra-cytoplasmic structures thought to be composed of endoplasmic reticulum material; they will increase in number with inflammation and increased granulocytopoiesis. If there are many neutrophils in the bloodstream containing Döhle bodies, these can be referred to as toxic neutrophils. Toxic neutrophils can also correspond to neutrophils that possess a more basophilic cytoplasm, basophilic granulation (infrequently observed), or cytoplasmic vacuoles in addition to one of the preceding cytoplasmic changes. Döhle bodies, cytoplasmic basophilia and cytoplasmic granulation all reflect &quot;defects&quot; in cell production and maturation during active granulocytopoiesis. Just like a left shift, the presence of toxic neutrophils suggests increased granulocytopoiesis. However, in a freshly prepared blood smear, the presence of vacuolation in addition to toxic neutrophils reflects endotoxemia resulting in autolysis of neutrophils. This autodigestion is responsible for the cytoplasmic vacuolation. It is the single toxic change that does not result from the &quot;manufacturing&quot; process.

<text>Grant-maintained schools or GM schools were state schools in England and Wales between 1988 and 1998 that had opted out of local government control, being funded directly by a grant from central government. Some of these schools had selective admissions procedures.

==History==
Grant-maintained status was created by the Education Reform Act 1988, as part of the programme of the Conservative government to create greater diversity in educational provision and to weaken the influence of local education authorities.

GM schools would be owned and managed by their own boards of school governors, rather than the local authority. Proposals to convert to grant-maintained status could be initiated by the governing body or by a number of parents, but would then be determined by a ballot of parents.
Skegness Grammar School was the first school to apply for, and to receive, grant-maintained status, whilst Castle Hall School in Mirfield was the first GM school to open.

The Education Act 1993 made it possible for independent schools to convert to grant-maintained status, and for independent sponsors to set up new grant-maintained schools.
Schools entering the state sector under these provisions included:
* some Roman Catholic secondary schools, some of which had earlier been direct grant grammar schools: Loreto Grammar School, St. Ambrose College, St Anselm&#x27;s College, St. Edward&#x27;s College, St. Joseph&#x27;s College, Upton Hall School FCJ and Virgo Fidelis Convent Senior School,
* some Jewish and Muslim primary schools, including the Islamia Primary School founded by Yusuf Islam (Cat Stevens).

Grant-maintained schools were allowed to set their own admissions criteria, which were sometimes at variance with those applied by the local education authorities. Some schools successfully applied to become fully selective grammar schools, others introduced partial selection, and some practised selection by interview.

The popularity of GM schools in some areas was attributed to the poor financial support offered by local education authorities. GM schools were entitled to apply to central government for capital grants for essential building works.

The additional funding, distinct admissions policies and semi-independent status of grant-maintained schools were controversial and caused friction with LEAs.

At their peak in early 1998, there were 1,196 grant-maintained schools, most of them secondary schools.
Within the state sector, they accounted for 3% of primary schools, 19% of secondary schools and 2% of special schools.

== Legacy ==

Grant-maintained status was abolished by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.
GM schools that had previously been voluntary aided, or which had private sponsors, normally returned to voluntary aided status, while others became foundation schools.
However schools could choose a different status, and a few became voluntary controlled or community schools.
Though funded through local authorities, voluntary aided and foundation schools retain some independence.
They own the school buildings and grounds, employ the staff and control their own admissions.

After the abolition of grant-maintained status, the only schools still directly funded by central government were the 15 City Technology Colleges.
In 2000 the Labour government introduced a new kind of directly funded school, the City Academy, later renamed Academy. Following the 2010 General Election the Academies Act 2010 was enacted, vastly expanding possibilities for schools to become academies. It was described by journalist Mike Baker as &quot;not an extension of the Labour government&#x27;s academies, but the recreation of the grant-maintained (GM) schools&quot;.

<text>Everton is a small rural village of about 200 dwellings (including outlying) and civil parish in the Central Bedfordshire district of Bedfordshire, England about east of the county town of Bedford.

==Geography==

Everton is north-east of Sandy, west of Cambridge and north of Central London.

Parish area and boundaries

The civil parish covers an area of and is boot-shaped. The White Way, a former Roman road forms part of the parish&#x27;s north-western boundary. The north and north-eastern boundary is with Cambridgeshire.

Landscape

Natural England has categorised the landscape into National Character Areas. The village and higher land of the parish lie within the Bedfordshire Greensand Ridge. The western lower lying area is part of the Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Claylands. Central Bedfordshire Council further divides the landscape into more local areas. The west of the parish forms part of the predominantly flat, Biggin Wood Clay Vale. Mixed roadside hedgerows are a feature with grass verges and roadside trees of ash, field maple and oak. The occasional solitary farm dots the landscape. The surrounding area is mostly arable farmland. The village and higher ground are part of the Everton Heath Greensand Ridge, which has a fairly steep northwest facing slope backed by an area of undulating land forming the ridge top. Woodbury Park just to the north of the village is grassland and woodland. White Wood is an ancient woodland of about . Most of the trees are pine but the lime trees are about 200 years old and some of the oaks date back 300 years.

Elevation

The village centre at above sea level overlooks lower lying land to the west that falls to . Tempsford Road has a 14% gradient. The highest point is at White Wood to the northeast of the village.

Geology and soil type

The village itself lies on Lower Greensand whilst the western area of the parish is on Oxford Clay overlying Kellaways beds. The two areas are separated by a narrow band of Corallian limestone. Around the village the soil is freely draining, slightly acid and sandy with low fertility. The western lower lying area has highly fertile, lime-rich loamy and clayey soils with impeded drainage.

The night sky and light pollution

Light pollution is the level of radiance (night lights) shining up into the night sky. The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) divides the level of night sky brightness into 9 bands with band 1 being the darkest i.e. with the lowest level of light pollution and band 9 the brightest and most polluted. Everton is in band 4.

The built environment

The earliest houses are thatched cottages dating from the 18th century. Most houses are 20th century including some council built houses along Potton and Sandy Roads.

The East Coast Main Line railway passes through the western part of the parish.

Public footpaths

A public footpath runs west then north to Tempsford Station Road. A stretch of the Greensand Ridge Walk runs right through the village; north-east to its start/finish near Tetworth and south-west to Sandy and beyond.

==History==
The name Everton comes from Old English and means &quot;farmstead where wild boars are seen&quot;.
St Mary&#x27;s Church is substantially 12th century although the tower, nave clerestory and south porch are 15th century. It is built of coursed ironstone and cobblestones with ashlar dressings. In 1974, the tower was damaged by lightning and reduced to two stages from three. Corner pinnacles topped with weather vanes were added.

Everton was enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1802.

The village is close to the WWII airfield RAF Tempsford.

==Governance==
Everton Parish Council has seven elected members and meets bi-monthly at the village hall.
Everton is part of Potton ward for elections to the Central Bedfordshire Unitary Authority.

Prior to 1894, Everton was administered as part of the Hundred of Biggleswade.
From 1894 until 1974 the village was in Biggleswade Rural District and from 1974 to 2009 in Mid Bedfordshire District.

==Community==
Everton no longer has a shop (it having closed c. 1995) but is home to a pub, local church, and a primary school. There is a large recreation ground which contains both full-sized and five-a-side football pitches, a basketball net, and a fenced-in children&#x27;s play area.

Licensing records for the Thornton Arms public house go back to 1822.

==Public services==
Everton is in the Potton Public Water Supply Zone (RW50). The water supplied by Anglian Water comes from groundwater boreholes and is chloraminated and classed as hard.

The Eastern Power Area of UK Power Networks is the distribution network operator for electricity. Cadent Gas owns and operates the area&#x27;s gas distribution network.

The two nearest general hospitals are Bedford (Bedford Hospital NHS Trust) and Lister Hospital, Stevenage (East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust). Ambulance services are provided by the East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust. Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service and Bedfordshire Police cover the parish.

There nearest public library is Potton.

==Public transport==
Centrebus (South) runs bus route no. 190 south to Gamlingay, Potton, Biggleswade and Hitchin (journey time 1 hour 18 minutes) and west to Sandy. The service is normally two hourly, daytime only, Monday to Saturday. The Ivel Sprinter buses run a weekly service to St Neots (Thursdays) and Cambridge (Wednesdays).

The nearest railway station is Sandy.

==Woodbury Park==
To the north of Everton, off Everton Road, is Woodbury Park, originally part of the Gamlingay parish but now part of Bedfordshire. The grounds of Woodbury Hall were laid out by Nathaniel Richmond in the 1760s for the landowner, the Earl of Macclesfield who had married Woodbury heiress Mary Lane.

From the 1860s, it was owned by the Astell family of Everton House. Woodbury Hall is now owned by the Countess of Erroll. an Astell heiress. In World War II the house was requisitioned for military use.

<text>The CAL (&quot;Carabine Automatique Légère&quot;, &quot;Light Automatic Carbine&quot;) is a Belgian assault rifle that was manufactured by Fabrique Nationale. It was the first 5.56 mm rifle produced by the Fabrique Nationale. It resembled the company&#x27;s highly successful FN FAL, but was an original design. Unlike the FAL, it was a market failure, although its development led to the more successful FN FNC.

==Design details==
Prior to the development of the CAL, FN had already constructed a scaled-down FAL prototype before shelving the idea as unmarketable. Noting the growing sales success of the cheaper and simpler HK G3 rifle, FN decided that for any future rifle to be competitive in the marketplace, it would need to use fewer expensive precision-machined parts. These would be replaced by less expensive castings and stampings where possible. While the construction of the new CAL reflected these design principles, it was still relatively expensive and complex, and met with no significant sales. It was eventually dropped for the even less expensive FN FNC. A small number of FN CALs were sold to the civilian market in the US.

==Operation==
Although the weapon resembled a scaled-down FN FAL, it in fact used a rotating bolt, unlike the FAL, which used a tilting bolt design. The earlier models of the CAL had a three-round selector system, which allowed the weapon to fire a three-round burst with each trigger pull. The CAL could also fire in fully and semi-automatic modes.

The gun used long stroke gas piston to operate the bolt carrier, and the bolt itself had interrupted lugs to lock it into the chamber.
Locking lugs were cut diagonally at a steep angle. So while the bolt is rotating to unlock, bolt face is slowly moving back, giving primary extraction of the case. Similar feature can be seen on MG 30, MG 15, MG 17 and MG 34.

<text>A eurobond is an international bond that is denominated in a currency not native to the country where it is issued. They are also called external bonds. They are usually categorised according to the currency in which they are issued: eurodollar, euroyen, and so on. The name became somewhat misleading with the advent of the euro currency in 1999; eurobonds were created in the 1960s, before the euro existed, and thus the etymology is to &quot;European bonds&quot; rather than &quot;bonds denominated in the Euro currency&quot;. 

The eurobond market was traditionally centered in the City of London, with Luxembourg also being a primary listing center for these instruments. Eurobonds have since expanded and are traded throughout the world, with Singapore and Tokyo being notable markets as well. These bonds were originally created to escape regulation: by trading in US dollars in London, certain financial requirements of the US government unpopular with bankers could be evaded, and London was happy to welcome the business to grow their own finance sector. Since then, eurobonds have grown to be a more general way to perform financial operations in a currency while using the regulatory framework of a separate country.

== Terminology ==
Eurobonds are named after the currency they are denominated in. For example, Euroyen and Eurodollar bonds are denominated in Japanese yen and American dollars, respectively. Eurobonds were originally in bearer bond form, payable to the bearer and were also free of withholding tax. The bank paid the holder of the coupon the interest payment due.

== History ==
The first eurobonds were issued in 1963 by Italian motorway network Autostrade, which issued 60,000 bearer bonds at a value of US$250 each for a fifteen-year loan of US$15m, paying an annual coupon of 5.5%. The issue was arranged by London bankers S. G. Warburg. and listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Allen &amp; Overy, one of London&#x27;s Magic Circle of law firms, were the lawyers on the transaction.
Their conception was largely a reaction against the imposition of the Interest Equalization Tax in the United States. The goal of the tax was to reduce the US balance-of-payment deficit by reducing American demand for foreign securities. Americans could bypass the costly tax and Europeans could keep open access to US capital.

== Electronic form ==
Like other commonly traded securities, virtually all eurobonds now trade in dematerialized electronic book-entry form, rather than physical form. The bonds are held at central securities depositories (Euroclear Bank and Clearstream Banking SA being the most common). Coupons are paid electronically via the clearing systems to the holder of the eurobond (or their nominee account).

<doc id="1043933" wikidata="Q171908" url="?curid=1043933" title="Remington Model 870">
<text>The Remington Model 870 is a pump-action shotgun manufactured by Remington Arms Company, LLC. It is widely used by the public for shooting sports, hunting and self-defense, as well as by law enforcement and military organizations worldwide.

==Development==
The Remington 870 was the fourth major design in a series of Remington pump shotguns. John Pedersen designed the fragile Remington Model 10 (and later the improved Remington Model 29). John Browning designed the Remington Model 17 (which was later adapted by Ithaca into the Ithaca 37), which served as the basis for the Remington 31. The Model 31 was marketed as the “ball-bearing repeater” and was well-received, but its many machined and handfitted parts made the gun expensive to manufacture. Consequently, it struggled in sales compared to the Winchester Model 12. To achieve better sales, Remington produced the Model 870 in 1950, which was more modern and reliable in its construction, easy to take apart and maintain, and relatively inexpensive.

The 870 was a commercial success. Remington sold two million guns by 1973 (ten times the number of Model 31 shotguns it replaced). As of 1983, the 870 held the record for the best-selling shotgun in history, with three million sold. By 1996, spurred by sales of the basic &quot;Express&quot; models, which were added as a lower-cost alternative to the original Wingmaster line, sales topped seven million guns. On April 13, 2009, the ten millionth Model 870 was produced.

==Design details==
The 870 features a bottom-loading, side ejecting receiver and a tubular magazine under the barrel. The gun comes with a plug for migratory bird hunting which reduces the magazine&#x27;s capacity to two rounds. It has dual action bars, internal hammer, and a bolt which locks into an extension in the barrel. The action, receiver, fire control group, safety catch and slide release catch of the Remington Model 870 shotgun are similar to those used on the Remington Model 7600 series pump-action centerfire rifles and carbines. The basic fire control group design was first used in the automatic 11–48. Twelve gauge stocks will also interchange on the older 12-gauge-sized 20-gauge receivers, although modification is needed to fit the smaller sized 20-gauge receivers employed since the late 1970s. Several parts of the 870, such as buttstocks and magazine tubes, will interchange with the semi-automatic Remington 1100 and 11–87.

The original 870 models were offered with fixed chokes. In 1986 Remington introduced the new Remington &quot;Rem Choke&quot; system of screw-in chokes (also fitted to Remington model 1100 auto-loading shotguns at the same time). Initially, the Rem Chokes were offered only in 12 gauge in barrel lengths of . The following year the availability was expanded to the 20 gauge and included other barrel lengths.

The 870&#x27;s production for over 30 years had a design flaw whereby a user could fail to press a shell all the way into the magazine when loading – so that the shell latch did not engage the shell – which could result in tying up the gun. This was caused by the shell slipping out of the magazine under the bolt in the receiver to bind the action, requiring rough treatment of the action or even disassembly. The potential issue was resolved with the introduction of the &quot;Flexi Tab&quot; carrier. Guns with this modification can be identified by the U-shaped cut-out on the carrier, visible from below the gun. The cut-out, combined with modified machining on the underside of the slide assembly, allows the action to be opened with a shell on the carrier.

==Variants==

There are hundreds of variations of the Remington 870 in 12, 16, 20, 28 gauges and .410 bore. All Remington 870 versions are built on the same platform and receiver, but there are small differences that can be more than just cosmetic. In 1969, Remington introduced 28 gauge and .410 bore models on a new scaled-down receiver size, and in 1972, a 20-gauge Lightweight (&quot;LW&quot;) version was introduced on the same sized receiver, and all of the smaller gauges today are produced on that size receiver. From the original fifteen models offered, Remington currently produces dozens of models for civilian, law enforcement, and military sales.

The maximum shell length that can be used in a Remington 870 depends on the barrel and receiver of the particular model. While the receiver length determines whether a shell will feed, the chamber length in the barrel determines if it will be safe to fire. For 12 gauge 870s, the maximum shell length is  in (70 mm) for non-magnums, 3 in (76 mm) for magnums, and  in (89 mm) for super magnums. Since barrels can be changed, it is important to also check the barrel markings to ensure the chosen cartridge length is safe to use.

870 variants can be grouped into the following:
===Unlicensed Norinco Copies===
Chinese arms company Norinco has made unlicensed copies of the Remington 870, as the design is no longer under patent protection. The most common of these designs are the Hawk Industries Type 97, Norinco HP9-1 and M-98, the difference being that the HP9-1 has either a 12.5&quot; or 14&quot; barrel, whereas the M-98 has an 18.5&quot; barrel and the Type 97 Military version uses magazines. In the United States, where most Norinco products are specifically non-importable, this shotgun was imported and sold under the names Norinco Hawk 982 and Interstate Hawk 982.

<doc id="1043937" wikidata="Q3362265" url="?curid=1043937" title="Scientific pitch notation">
<text>Scientific pitch notation (SPN), also known as American standard pitch notation (ASPN) and international pitch notation (IPN), is a method of specifying musical pitch by combining a musical note name (with accidental if needed) and a number identifying the pitch&#x27;s octave.

Although scientific pitch notation was originally designed as a companion to scientific pitch (see below), the two are not synonymous. Scientific pitch is a pitch standard—a system that defines the specific frequencies of particular pitches (see below). Scientific pitch notation concerns only how pitch names are notated, that is, how they are designated in printed and written text, and does not inherently specify actual frequencies. Thus, the use of scientific pitch notation to distinguish octaves does not depend on the pitch standard used.

==Nomenclature==
The notation makes use of the traditional tone names (A to G) which are followed by numbers showing which octave they are part of.

For standard A440 pitch equal temperament, the system begins at a frequency of 16.35160 Hz, which is assigned the value C0. 

The octave 0 of the scientific pitch notation is traditionally called the sub-contra octave, and the tone marked C0 in SPN is written as &quot;,C&quot; or &quot;C,&quot; or &quot;CCC&quot; in traditional systems, such as Helmholtz notation. Octave 0 of SPN marks the low end of what humans can actually perceive, with the average person being able to hear frequencies no lower than 20 Hz as pitches.

The octave number increases by 1 upon an ascension from B to C. Thus, &quot;A0&quot; refers to the first A &quot;above&quot; C0 and middle C (the one-line octave&#x27;s C or simply ) is denoted as &quot;C4&quot; in SPN. For example, C4 is one note above B3, and A5 is one note above G5.

The octave number is tied to the alphabetic character used to describe the pitch, with the division between note letters ‘B’ and ‘C’, thus:
:* &quot;B3&quot; and all of its possible variants (B, B, B, B, B) would properly be designated as being in octave &quot;3&quot;.
:* &quot;C4&quot; and all of its possible variants (C, C, C, C, C) would properly be designated as being in octave &quot;4&quot;.
:* In equal temperament &quot;C&quot; is same frequency as &quot;B&quot;.

==Use==
Scientific pitch notation is often used to specify the range of an instrument. It provides an unambiguous means of identifying a note in terms of textual notation rather than frequency, while at the same time avoiding the transposition conventions that are used in writing the music for instruments such as the clarinet and guitar. It is also easily translated into staff notation, as needed. In describing musical pitches, nominally enharmonic spellings can give rise to anomalies where, for example in Pythagorean intonation C is a lower frequency than B; but such paradoxes usually do not arise in a scientific context.

Scientific pitch notation avoids possible confusion between various derivatives of Helmholtz notation which use similar symbols to refer to different notes. For example, &quot;C&quot; in Helmholtz&#x27;s original notation refers to the C two octaves below middle C, whereas &quot;C&quot; in ABC Notation refers to middle C itself. With scientific pitch notation, middle C is &quot;always&quot; C, and C is never any note but middle C. This notation system also avoids the &quot;fussiness&quot; of having to visually distinguish between four and five primes, as well as the typographic issues involved in producing acceptable subscripts or substitutes for them. C is much easier to quickly distinguish visually from C, than is, for example, from , and the use of simple integers (e.g. C7 and C8) makes subscripts unnecessary altogether.

Although pitch notation is intended to describe sounds audibly perceptible as pitches, it can also be used to specify the frequency of non-pitch phenomena. Notes below E or higher than E are outside most humans&#x27; hearing range, although notes slightly outside the hearing range on the low end may still be indirectly perceptible as pitches due to their overtones falling within the hearing range. For an example of truly inaudible frequencies, when the Chandra X-ray Observatory observed the waves of pressure fronts propagating away from a black hole, their one oscillation every 10 million years was described by NASA as corresponding to the B fifty-seven octaves below middle C (B or 3.235 fHz).
The notation is sometimes used in the context of meantone temperament, and does not always assume equal temperament nor the standard concert A4 of 440 Hz; this is particularly the case in connection with earlier music.

The standard proposed to the Acoustical Society of America explicitly states a logarithmic scale for frequency, which excludes meantone temperament, and the base frequency it uses gives A4 a frequency of exactly 440 Hz. However, when dealing with earlier music that did not use equal temperament, it is understandably easier to simply refer to notes by their closest modern equivalent, as opposed to specifying the difference using cents every time.

==Table of note frequencies==

The table below gives notation for pitches based on standard piano key frequencies: standard concert pitch and twelve-tone equal temperament. When a piano is tuned to just intonation, C4 refers to the same key on the keyboard, but a slightly different frequency. Notes not produced by any piano are highlighted in medium gray, and those produced only by an extended 108-key piano, light gray.

Mathematically, given the number of semitones above middle C, the fundamental frequency in hertz is given by formula_1 (see twelfth root of two). Given the MIDI NoteOn number , the frequency of the note is normally formula_2 Hz, using standard tuning.

==Scientific pitch versus scientific pitch &quot;notation&quot;==
Scientific pitch is an absolute pitch &quot;standard&quot;, first proposed in 1713 by French physicist Joseph Sauveur. It was defined so that all Cs are integer powers of 2, with middle C (C4) at 256 hertz. As already noted, it is not dependent upon, nor a part of scientific pitch &quot;notation&quot; described here. To avoid the confusion in names, scientific pitch is sometimes also called &quot;Verdi tuning&quot; or &quot;philosophical pitch&quot;.

The current international pitch standard, using A4 as exactly 440 Hz, had been informally adopted by the music industry as far back as 1926, and A440 became the official international pitch standard in 1955. SPN is routinely used to designate pitch in this system. A4 may be tuned to other frequencies under different tuning standards, and SPN octave designations still apply (ISO 16).

With changes in concert pitch and the widespread adoption of A440 as a musical standard, new scientific frequency tables were published by the Acoustical Society of America in 1939, and adopted by the International Organization for Standardization in 1955. C0, which was exactly 16 Hz under the scientific pitch standard, is now 16.35160 Hz under the current international standard system.

<text>Euroclear UK &amp; International is a UK-based central securities depository that holds UK equities and UK gilts. It operates the CREST system, whose name stands for Certificateless Registry for Electronic Share Transfer. Originally known as CRESTCo (sometimes CrestCo), it was renamed in 2002, following acquisition by Euroclear, as Euroclear UK &amp; Ireland; and in 2021, following the migration of Irish securities to Euroclear Bank, adopted its current name.

== History ==

The CREST project was launched in 1993, following the TAURUS fiasco. The operating company CRESTCo was founded in 1996. 

In late 2001, Euroclear began negotiations to acquire CRESTCo. The transaction was completed in the second half of 2002.

==Operations==

CREST allows shareholders and bondholders to hold assets in a dematerialised, i.e. electronic form, rather than holding physical share certificates. CREST also serves a number of other important functions, such as assisting in the payments of dividends to shareholders.

It is also an &quot;electronic trade confirmation system&quot; (&quot;ETC&quot;) (using Trax). When parties to a transaction make a deal, they both electronically confirm their sides of the transaction via electronic transfer. Both parties are required to submit confirmation details to Crest. In the event that transaction details do not match, CREST will highlight the issues and ensure that the problems are resolved as soon as is practicable.

Stamp duty in the United Kingdom is only payable on physical share certificates therefore no stamp duty is payable on shares settled via CREST, however to compensate for this the UK government added a Stamp Duty Reserve Tax which is collected by CREST on behalf of His Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs.

===Members===

There are two classes of members on CREST: members and sponsored members. Members are usually pension funds, inter-dealer brokers or other large financial institutions with significant resources. Sponsored members have the same rights and responsibilities as members. However, given that they do not have the financial or technical resources of the full members, they rely on their sponsoring member to interface with CREST.

===Registrars and CREST Depository Interest (CDI)===

UK stocks are held by registrars who are members of CREST and are therefore integrated into the transfer of ownership. Irish equities and ETF securities are also settled directly through CREST members.

For international stocks, CREST holds a pool of them in a local depository, such as Clearstream for German stocks and CDS for Canadian stocks. CREST then issues a CDI to each holder of the security, which can then be transferred in CREST just like a UK equity. This is similar to the depositary receipts issued in other countries. However, restrictions apply to CDIs. They are not withdrawable or depositable into/out of CREST. This is because a CDI is an electronic reflection of the underlying security held in the domestic (country of origin) market. The security provided by CDI are &quot;international securities&quot; in deed poll which includes security through equity shares, Eurobonds, domestic bonds and depository receipts. International securities must be eligible to be held within or through a CSD, which includes Euroclear, DTC, SIS SegaIntersettle (the Swiss clearing system) and any other national or international central securities depositories from time to time specified in the CREST International Manual. The economic rights are not affected by the use of the CDIs.

To take the US as an example, the electronic settlement system in the US is called DTC and if a shareholder holds electronic stock in the US they will hold their securities electronically in DTC. In reality, they will hold the securities via a custodian, so the custodian&#x27;s nominee details will appear on the company&#x27;s register. This is known as holding stock in the &#x27;domestic&#x27; market. Securities held this way can only be traded domestically i.e. in the market of the country of origin. If the shares are listed in more than one market (for example in the US and in the UK) a shareholder who wants to trade their securities within CREST outside of the US &#x27;domestic&#x27; market can instruct their custodian (in this example the DTC) to transfer the securities to the CREST account within DTC.

Restrictions apply, only securities that have a UK quote can be transferred to CREST&#x27;s DTC account. CREST is a member of DTC. Once the securities have been transferred from the shareholder&#x27;s account within the DTC and into CREST&#x27;s account CREST will &#x27;create&#x27; the CDI within the CREST and the CDI will appear in the shareholder&#x27;s account within CREST where the CDI can now be traded in the UK market. The CDI which is traded within CREST will typically have the same ISIN as the US share itself. The legal holder to the share will continue to be the nominee for the DTC.

===Stamp Duty Reserve Tax===

HMRC consider that a CDI is a chargeable security for the Stamp Duty Reserve Tax. However, where the underlying security is loan capital and that loan capital satisfies the loan capital exemption the trade of the CDI should be exempt from SDRT. Other treatments to the Eurobonds are included in the bulletin published by Euroclear.

<doc id="1043944" wikidata="Q450647" url="?curid=1043944" title="Ann Wolfe">
<text>Ann Wolfe (born January 17, 1971) is an American retired professional boxer, trainer and actress. Wolfe held world titles in three different weight classes simultaneously and is regarded as one of the greatest female boxers of all time. She is a member of the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Wolfe was born in Oberlin, Louisiana and moved to Austin, Texas where she spent most of her childhood. She moved back to Austin in 1996 with her two daughters and one son. After being homeless and working construction, she met her original trainer &#x27;Pops&#x27; Billingsley. She fought her amateur fights under Billingsley&#x27;s tutelage and started fighting as a professional for RPM Promotions.

==Amateur career==
Wolfe had a record of 3–1 as an amateur boxer and fought at the 1998 U.S. National Championships. She won a decision over Tami Hendrickson of Seattle in the quarter-final by 50–39, then went on to stop Shanie Keelean of Chicago within 46 seconds of the first round. In the semifinal Wolfe lost to La&#x27;Kiea Coffen by a disqualification at 1:23 of the third round.

==Professional career==
Wolfe made her professional debut by beating Brenda Lee Bell by a four-round decision. Her first and only career loss came four fights later, when she was knocked out in three rounds by veteran and future world champion Valerie Mahfood.

Wolfe beat Vienna Williams by a ten-round decision to win her first world title, the IFBA Jr. Middleweight title. She beat Gina Nicholas by knockout in three to win the vacant WIBA Light Middleweight title. She then proceeded to beat Shirvelle Williams by knockout in one round on a non-title bout.

Next was the vacant IFBA world Super Middleweight title, which she picked up by knocking out Marsha Valley in six rounds. She and Valley fought again, this time with the vacant WIBC&#x27;s version of the title, and Wolfe won by knockout in round ten.

Wolfe avenged her defeat against Mahfood by taking the NABA World Super Middleweight Championship from her with a ten-round decision.

===Wolfe vs. Ward===
On May 8, 2004, in Biloxi, Mississippi, Wolfe matched Henry Armstrong&#x27;s record of three world titles at the same time in different weight classes, by gaining the IBA world Light Heavyweight championship, knocking out undefeated champion and former NCAA basketball star Vonda Ward at one minute and eight seconds of Round One. Ward had a neck concussion because she hit the canvas with her neck when she fell. She was taken to the hospital in serious condition due to damage to her neck and head. The bout was nationally televised, with television commentators called it &quot;the best knockout punch in a women&#x27;s boxing history&quot;.

===Later career===
Wolfe retained her title in a rematch with Valley by a sixth-round knockout.

On July 19, 2005, Wolfe defeated Monica Nunez by a seventh-round knockout in Lula, Mississippi.

On August 20, 2005, she fought and defeated Valerie Mahfood for the second time, by a ten-round decision.

===Retirement===
Wolfe last fought in 2006, knocking out Cassandra Giger and decisioning Lisa Ested. She has since worked as a boxing trainer.

In 2015, Wolfe was inducted into the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Training career==
Wolfe has trained many amateur and professional boxers, including her oldest daughter, Jennifer Fenn, and light-middleweight James Kirkland.

==Film career==
Wolfe was cast by director Patty Jenkins in the role of Amazon warrior Artemis in the 2017 film &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;.

<text>The IMBEL MD series (MD-1, MD-2, MD-3 and the recent MD-4) of assault rifles are the standard-issue rifles of the Brazilian Army.

==History==
These rifles are manufactured by IMBEL (&quot;Indústria de Material Bélico do Brasil&quot;) and are based on the 7.62mm NATO FN FAL, which was previously manufactured by IMBEL for many years under licence as the Brazilian Army&#x27;s standard service rifle. In following the trend to adopt the 5.56×45mm NATO round, IMBEL started experimenting with 5.56mm versions of the FN FAL in the early 1980s. The first prototype, the MD-1, appeared in around 1983. Further development resulted in the MD-2 and MD-3 series, which still closely resemble their FAL parent.

==Design==
The MD-2 and MD-3 rifles are the result of redesigning the FN FAL to use the 5.56×45mm NATO round in place of the FAL&#x27;s 7.62mm NATO chambering. The MD-2/MD-3 series externally resembles a short-barrelled FAL, but with an M16 magazine.

Early MD-1 prototypes retained the FAL-type tilting bolt with a locking shoulder immediately behind the magazine well. This was found to not work well with the 5.56mm round, so subsequent prototypes and the final design incorporated an M16-type 7-lug rotating bolt into the design. The FAL&#x27;s short-stroke gas piston, which is actuated by gas bled from the barrel via a vent located in the foresight housing, and which impinges upon the separate bolt carrier, is retained.

Feeding is from STANAG 4179 M16-compatible magazines. The versions differ in that the MD-2 uses the side-folding buttstock from the FN FAL &#x27;para&#x27; variant, while the MD-3 uses the fixed polymer stock of the standard FAL. The MD-2 series contains many FAL-derived parts, some of which remain interchangeable with the original FAL, and others which are modified to suit the new design.

<text>Irwin Allan Rose (July 16, 1926 – June 2, 2015) was an American biologist. Along with Aaron Ciechanover and Avram Hershko, he was awarded the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation.

==Education and early life==
Rose was born in Brooklyn, New York, into a secular Jewish family, the son of Ella (Greenwald) and Harry Royze, who owned a flooring store. Rose attended Washington State University for one year prior to serving in the Navy during World War II. Upon returning from the war he received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1948 and his PhD in biochemistry in 1952, both from the University of Chicago. He did his post-doctoral studies at NYU.

==Career and research==
Rose served on the faculty of Yale School of Medicine&#x27;s department of biochemistry from 1954 to 1963. He then joined the Fox Chase Cancer Center in 1963 and stayed there until he retired in 1995. He joined University of Pennsylvania during the 1970s and served as a Professor of Physical Biochemistry. He was a distinguished professor-in-residence in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine at the time his Nobel Prize was announced in 2004.

Irwin (Ernie) trained several postdoctoral research fellows while at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. These included Art Haas, the first to see Ubiquitin chains, Keith Wilkinson, the one to first identify APF-1 as Ubiquitin, and Cecile Pickart.

==Published work==

When Irwin Rose started on his prizewinning work on ubiquitin he was already very distinguished as an enzymologist.

===Classical enzymology===

Only a selection of Rose&#x27;s very extensive work in this field is mentioned here.

In collaboration with Marianne Grunberg-Manago, Saul Korey and Severo Ochoa he investigated the Mg2+- or Mn2+-dependent formation of acetyl-CoA from acetate and ATP catalyzed by acetate kinase, an essential reaction for priming the tricarboxylate cycle, describing the purification of the enzyme and measuring the equilibrium constant of the reaction.

With Edward O&#x27;Connell, Rose investigated the mechanisms of the reaction catalyzed by phosphoglucose isomerase and, with Sidney Rieder, of triose phosphate isomerase

With Jessie Warms, he studied the mechanism of hexokinase of sarcoma tumor, finding that it was located in the mitochondria of liver and brain, and bound in accord with a Mg2+-dependent equilibrium.

He had a general interest in the role of magnesium in cells, and studied it on the basis of the equilibrium of the reaction catalyzed by adenylate kinase, a complicated question, because numerous complexes of Mg2+, H+ and K+ with ATP, ADP and AMP need to be taken into account.

Starting from Ogston&#x27;s theory, Rose was concerned with the stereochemistry of enzyme-catalysed reactions, investigating various enzymes, and later glutamine synthetase. This was the topic of a review article written with Kenneth Hanson.

===Ubiquitin===

After its discovery by Gideon Goldstein and colleagues in 1975, ubiquitin was extensively studied by Rose, with Avram Hershko, Aaron Ciechanover, A. L. Haas and H. Heller, one of many papers on the subject.

==Awards and honors==
Rose was awarded the Nobel prize in 2004.

==Personal life==
Rose was married to Zelda Budenstein and had four children. He died on June 2, 2015, at Deerfield, Massachusetts. His widow died in 2016.

<text>Bank Sepah (, &quot;Bānke Sepah&quot;) is an Iranian bank. It was established in 1925 as the first Iranian bank. Its first branch, in Tehran, opened that year. The bank also has branches in Frankfurt, Paris and Rome as well as a subsidiary, Bank Sepah International plc, in London. Sepah Bank has recently merged four other Iranian banks and one credit institution: Ansar Bank, Mehr Eghtesad Bank, Hekmat Iranian Bank, Ghavamin Bank and Kosar Credit Institution. The Omid Bank app is product of Bank Sepah.

== History ==
Bank Sepah was officially founded on 4 May 1925, with its first branch in Sepah Street in Tehran. Initially, an investment of 3,883,950 Iranian Rials was made from the military ranked personnel pension fund and the bank was set to exclusively provide military personnel with financial aids such as loans. With further increase in their domain of services, the headquarters for the bank was moved to a larger building in Homayoon st. Starting on 15 March 1926, with opening of another branch in Rasht, Bank Sepah began providing services not only to the military personnel but to the more general public such as businessmen.

Sepah migrated to core banking solution.

==US, UN sanctions==
Sanctions were imposed on Bank Sepah by the United States on 9 January 2007, due to Iran&#x27;s suspected nuclear weapons program. The United States claimed that the bank assisted Iran in developing missiles that could carry nuclear weapons. and all its branches and subsidiaries in Italy, UK, France and Germany will have their assets frozen by the United States in order to prevent Iran from constructing nuclear weapons. The official website of Bank Sepah in Iran reacted by mentioning the American resolution &quot;fabricated statements based on purely hypothetical pretext, made out of political inducements&quot; and promised that the bank will &quot;continue with its efficient performance with due observance of internal and international regulations as before.&quot;

On the same basis, further sanctions have also been imposed by the United Nations through Resolution 1747 of 29 March 2007 coinciding with the arrest by the Iranian Government of some British army personnel in the Persian Gulf.

In early 2016, following the talks of P5+1 with Iran on the Nuclear program of Iran, and the resultant Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, sanctions against Bank Sepah were lifted.

<doc id="1043959" wikidata="Q806640" url="?curid=1043959" title="Bank Melli Iran">
<text>Bank Melli Iran (BMI; ) is the first national and commercial retail bank of Iran. It was considered as the largest Iranian company in terms of annual income with a revenue of 364 657 billion Rials in 2016. It is the largest bank in the Islamic world and in the Middle East. By the end of 2016, BMI had a net asset of $76.6 billion and a network of 3.328 banking branches; so it was known as the largest Iranian bank based on the amount of assets. The brand of BMI was recognized as one of the 100 top Iranian brands in 10th National Iranian Heroes Championship in 2013. The National Bank has 3328 active branches inside, 14 active branches and 4 sub-stations abroad, and it has 180 booths. The first managing director of BMI was from Germany, the first foreign branch of BMI was opened in Hamburg, Germany in 1948.

== History ==
The formation of a new bank was first proposed by Haj Mohammad Hassan Amin Dar al-Zarb known as Amināl-Zarb (one of the Tehran stockholders) in 1879 ten years before the creation of the King Bank, to Naser-al-Din Shah Qajar. But this proposal was not accepted with the interference of the countries that dominated Iran and their agents. Instead, the King Bank was established in Iran. After the establishment of the constitution, when the government allowed the National Assembly to allow external borrowing, the national feelings were excited that had been hurt by past loans and the behavior of foreign banks. So, the deputies demanded the establishment of the National Bank in order to curtail the political and economic influence of said banks and restore the treasury finances while opposing external borrowing. A group of traders and merchants committed to participate in the bank. Thus, it was published with a statement that showed the general feelings and popular interest in establishing a national credit bank in Iran in December 1906.

On 23 November 1906, Mirza Abolqasem Nasser al-Malik, the Minister of Finance of the time of Muzaffar al-Din Shah, was present in the National Assembly. He announced the financial crisis of the country. He suggested that the government get a loan from European countries to deal with this problem, but the deputies dissented strongly. After that, on 9 December, the deputies agreed to establish a bank that could benefit the country and work with people&#x27;s deposits in the interests of the country and the people. 

On the other hand, sudden changes in the political situation and the 1907 agreement between the governments of Russia and Britain and the division of Iran, as well as the beginning of the First World War and the arrival of occupation forces in Iran, have undermined all efforts to form the National Bank. Finally, by the end of First World War and withdrawal of invaders from Iran, the law for establishing the National Bank of Iran was approved by the parliament on 14 May 1927. The statute of bank was approved by the Parliament&#x27;s Finance Committee on 14 July 1928.

The first CEO of the National Bank, , and his vice-president, Fogel, came to Iran with 70 experts from Germany.

According to the statute of bank, the National Bank of Iran was recognized as joint-stock company with legal personality; it was considered to be subject to commercial laws. The initial capital of the bank was 20 million Rials, of which only 8 million were paid. At present, it is 187 trillion Rials with an increase in 2016.

Due to the fact that there were no bank specialists in Iran at that time, the law allowed the recruitment of Swiss or German nationals for the administration of the bank. The number of bank employees on the opening day, including Iranian and German, did not exceed 27. Now, the number of employees of BMI is over 45 thousand people.
Initially, when the bank was first chartered, in addition to the central branch, two additional domestic branches were also opened, one in the market of Tehran and the other in Bandar-e Bushhehr, the country&#x27;s most important commercial port. The bank&#x27;s first official overseas branch abroad opened in 1948 in Hamburg, West Germany.
On 22 March 1931, the right to publish the banknote was approved by the National Assembly. It was officially granted to the National Bank of Iran for 10 years, which could be renewed on its own. In April 1932, the first banknote of BMI was issued.

Saving Fund: saving fund of Bank Melli Iran was established under a law to encourage people to save money in 1939. 

=== After the Islamic Revolution ===

After the Islamic Revolution, changes to the banking system were implemented in order to conform with Sharia law in the realm of Islamic banking and finance. The new law was passed in 1984. There are more than 3328 active branches inside, 14 active branches and 4 subsidiaries abroad and 180 offices.

The 20 Rials Pahlavi coin had two pictures: On one side, there was image of Reza Pahlavi with the words of Reza Shah: Establishment of BMI was one of the long-term wishes of my nation, and on the other side was the image of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi with the written: Establishment of BMI was one of the real foundations of independence of Iran.

=== Bank Melli Iran Museum ===
The Museum of BMI was opened with the presence of Eshaq Jahangiri, the first vice president, on 21 July 2017. The Museum of BMI was opened with a collection of exquisite works of art, especially banking treasures from various historical periods of Iran, at savings fund building. The National Bank of Iran has ancient objects from Achaemenid, Sasanian and artistic works, including paintings, lines, rugs and blankets. So, the objectives of establishing BMI Museum is displaying old and historical banking instruments, as well as gifts from various countries during the activity of BMI. The building of BMI Fund was constructed at Ferdowsi Street in Tehran in 1928; it was registered in the category of national works of Iran on 20 December 2000 by number of 2930. This building was designed by a German architect H. Heinrich, inspired by remained Achaemenid periodic buildings and combination of Iranian and European architecture. In this museum, a comprehensive collection of historical gifts of the bank, office equipment and banknote printing machine, ancient paintings, coins, old banknotes and ceremonial bank items are publicly displayed.

=== Banknote printing ===
On 22 March 1931, the National Assembly handed over the right to BMI to print the banknote for 10 years. Also, it was decided that, after expiration of this period, if this right was not canceled, it would act for next ten years.

The first National Banknotes were issued on 1 April 1932. The banknotes of Imperial Bank and National Bank of Iran were prevalent from that date to three months. The banknotes of BMI have become the only paper money in Iran since July of that year.

By 1960, BMI was issuing banknotes for its economic needs. However, that year, upon establishment of Central Bank of Iran, the exclusive right to issue banknotes was transferred to this bank, which is still ongoing.

== Capital==
From the beginning of establishment, BMI was a public company; its initial capital was 20 million Rials divided to 20 thousand shares of thousand Rials (13,500 shares with name and 6,500 anonymous shares). But, the transfer of bank shares to non-state shareholders was banned in 1938. In 1935, the capital of BMI increased to 300 million Rials and increased to 2 billion Rials in 1952.

Due to banking system constraints, the National Bank carried out all duties of Central Bank in the economy before 1956. After establishment of Central Bank of Iran, the duties were assigned to this bank. The last registered capital of National Bank was 198 thousand and 565 billion and 600 million Rials in June 2017.

== Social responsibilities ==
* Public Utilities Projects: At present, the bank has been involved in 39 public utilities project more than 114 billion Rials.
* Children Support.
* Support for cultural and scientific projects.
* Support for sports plans for releasing Diya prisoners .
* School building.

==Islamic banking==

All banks in Iran must follow the banking principles and practices described in the Islamic Banking (Sharia) law of Iran passed in 1983 by the Islamic Majlis of Iran. According to this law, banks can only engage in interest-free Islamic transactions (interest is considered as usury or riba and is forbidden by Islam and its holy book the &quot;Quran&quot;). The permitted commercial transactions involve exchange of goods and services in return for a share of the assumed profit. All such transactions are performed through Islamic contracts, such as &quot;mozarebe&quot;, &quot;foroush aghsati&quot;, &quot;joale&quot;, &quot;salaf&quot;, and &quot;gharzol-hassane&quot;. Details of these contracts and related practices are contained in the Iranian Interest-Free banking law and its guidelines.

==Civil lawsuit==
Following the September 1997 suicide bombing in Jerusalem, five American students who had been wounded were awarded $251 million in compensatory and punitive damages against the government of Iran and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps by Judge Ricardo M. Urbina, under the Flatow Amendment of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, in accordance with Section 201a of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, which states that &quot;in every case in which a person has obtained a judgment against a terrorist party on a claim based upon an act of terrorism ... the blocked assets of that terrorist party ... shall be subject to execution&quot;. Since most Iranian assets in the United States had been withdrawn after the embassy hostage crisis, the only substantial monetary asset left was approximately $150,000 in the Bank Melli&#x27;s account in the Bank of New York. Before turning over the funds to the five students, however, the Bank of New York sued for a legal decision regarding its responsibilities in the case. The United States Department of Justice, speaking as amicus curiae in support of Bank Melli, advised that the bank had no responsibility for turning the funds over to the students; in March 2006, Judge Denise Cole ruled against them, and was upheld by the Second Circuit Court in April 2007. Bank Melli then withdrew the funds from Bank of New York.

On 5 March 2018, Bank Melli lost an appeal &quot;related to credit card use in Iran&quot; concerning &quot;roughly $17.6 million that Visa Inc and Franklin Resources Inc&quot; were holding for Bank Melli.

==United States sanctions==
On 25 October 2007, the United States imposed unilateral sanctions against Iran. These sanctions include new measures to reduce Iran&#x27;s ability to conduct financial transactions between the state-owned banks of Iran and United States citizens or private organisations. Bank Melli was included in these sanctions, on the grounds that, besides its other customers, Bank Melli provides financial services to Iran&#x27;s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. A fact sheet released by the US Treasury Department also asserts that between 2002 and 2006 Bank Melli sent at least $100 million to Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah and other groups, via the Quds Force, a branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.

In a statement published on its website, BMI refuted the US allegations and denied that it has ever been involved in any &quot;deceptive banking practices&quot;.

==European Union sanctions==
On 16 June 2008, the European Union imposed further unilateral sanctions against Iran. These sanctions include the European Union freezing the assets of Bank Melli, in response to Tehran&#x27;s refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment program.
After the lifting of sanctions, BMI was the first Iranian bank to be reconnected to Swift.

== Subsidiaries ==

=== Sadad data company ===

<text>Avram Hershko (, ; born December 31, 1937) is a Hungarian-Israeli biochemist who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2004.

==Biography==
He was born Herskó Ferenc in Karcag, Hungary, into a Jewish family, the son of Shoshana/Margit &#x27;Manci&#x27; (née Wulc) and Moshe Hershko, both teachers.
During the Second World War, his father was forced into labor service in the Hungarian army and then taken as a prisoner by the Soviet Army. For years, Avram&#x27;s family didn&#x27;t known anything about what had happened to his father. Avram, his mother and older brother Chaim/Laszlo &#x27;Laci&#x27; were put in a ghetto in Szolnok. During the final days of the ghetto, most Jews were sent to be murdered in Auschwitz, but Avram and his family managed to board trains that took them to a concentration camp in Austria, where they were forced into labor until the end of the war. Avram and his mother and brother survived the war and returned to their home. His father returned as well, 4 years after they had last seen him.

Hershko and his family emigrated to Israel in 1950 and settled in Jerusalem. He received his MD in 1965 and his PhD in 1969 from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem-Hadassah Medical Center. He was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, San Francisco. He is currently a Distinguished Professor at the Rappaport Faculty of Medicine at the Technion in Haifa and a Distinguished Adjunct Professor at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine.

Along with Aaron Ciechanover and Irwin Rose, he was awarded the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. The ubiquitin-proteasome system has a critical role in maintaining the homeostasis of cells and is believed to be involved in the development and progression of diseases such as cancer, muscular and neurological diseases, and immune and inflammatory responses.

His contributions to science directly helped cure one of his long-time friends of cancer.

<text>An off-premises extension (OPX), sometimes also known as off-premises station (OPS), is an extension telephone at a location distant from its servicing exchange.

One type of off-premises extension, connected to a private branch exchange (PBX), is generally used to provide employees with access to a company telephone system while they are out of the office. Off-premises extensions are used in distributed environments, serving locations that are too far from the PBX to be served by on-premises wiring.

Another type of off-premises extension, connected to a public telephone exchange, is generally used to allow a private phone line to ring at a second location. For example, the owner of a business may have an OPX for their home phone at the business location, allowing them to avoid missing calls to the home phone.

Telephone service providers charge a significant monthly rate for an OPX, partly calculated by the distance; in extreme cases, the distance may result in a rate higher than simply having an additional central office line with its own number. Recent innovations such as call forwarding-no answer or simultaneous ringing of multiple lines can replace several of the conveniences of an OPX at much lower cost.

An OPX uses a conditioned wire pair that is usually used only for voice applications, while for data, a pair usually needs to be unconditioned. An alarm circuit is an unconditioned pair.

In Internet telephony, a VoIP VPN OPX may be implemented by connecting an extension over a virtual private networking connection, instead of connecting it directly to the local area network. As a host connected by a VPN appears as a part of the local area network, the off-premises extension appears to the IP-PBX as if it were on-site.

<text>Bank Mellat (, &quot;Bank Milât&quot;, lit. &quot;People&#x27;s Bank&quot;) is a Governmental Iranian bank. Its name means &quot;Bank of the Nation&quot;. Bank Mellat was established in 1980, with a paid capital of Rials 33.5 billion as a merger of ten pre-revolution private banks, comprising Tehran, Dariush, Pars, Etebarat Taavoni &amp; Tozie, Iran &amp; Arab, Bein-al-melalie-Iran, Omran, Bimeh Iran, Tejarat Khareji Iran and Farhangian.

The bank&#x27;s capital amounted to Rls 13,100 billion and it was one of the largest commercial banks in the Islamic Republic of Iran, ranking among the top 1000 banks of the world.

In 2007 the Iranian government started the process of privatising the bank as part of a policy of selling 80% of state-owned stakes in banking, media, transportation and mining companies.

The Bank Mellat London branch was merged with the Bank Tejarat branch to form Persia International Bank PLC.

==Sanctions and court actions==
The United States Department of the Treasury has mentioned Bank Mellat and Persia International in their watchlist of Iranian banks which may be trading in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1803.

On 29 January 2013, the European General Court in Luxembourg ruled to annul the European Union sanctions in place since 2010 against Bank Mellat on grounds of supporting the Iranian nuclear and missile programs, stating that the basic rights of the bank had been denied and there was no evidence supporting the claim. Bank Mellat intends to sue for damages. On 18 February 2016, the Court of Justice of the European Union concurred with the General Court decision that the reasons given for sanctions were too vague.

A related action in the British courts was taken to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in March 2013, causing the court to hold a closed hearing for the first time. In June 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that the UK government&#x27;s sanctions on the bank had been unlawful with one justice stating that targeting Bank Mellat was &quot;irrational and disproportionate&quot;. Bank Mellat is claiming damages from the UK government for the loss of business between 2009 and 2013. The damages hearing was scheduled for June 2019, with Bank Mellat seeking damages of $1.7 billion. On the first day of the trial the parties agreed a settlement for a confidential sum. &quot;The Times&quot; later reported that £1.25 billion plus interest was paid to Bank Mellat, through a third country entity to avoid US sanctions. However the British government stated in parliament &quot;the amount paid in respect of the settlement was €91,352,709.35&quot;, plus £1 million for legal costs.

<text>Bank Saderat Iran (BSI) (, &quot;Bank Sadârat Iran&quot;, lit. &quot;Export Bank of Iran&quot;) is an Iranian multinational banking and financial services company headquartered in Tehran, Iran. It is Iran&#x27;s largest bank. It was founded in Tehran in 1952 by the prominent Mofarrah and Bolurfrushan (also spelled Bolourforoushan) families, represented in the first board by Mohammad Ali Mofarrah and Mohammad Bolurfrushan and commenced operation on 13 November 1952 with a board of three directors and 20 employees.

Bank Saderat Iran has around 3,500 offices in 12 countries and territories across Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and around 10 million customers. As of 30 June 2013, it had total assets of $59.110 billion. BSI has 28 international branches and services in 12 countries.

==History==
===Before 1979===
Bank Saderat Iran was founded on September 7, 1952, by the Bolurfrushan family, Mohammad Ali Mofrah, and several of his associates. The bank was initially established with a capital of 20 million Iranian rials in credit and 3,500 Iranian rials in loans. It was temporarily housed in an upper floor of a building overlooking the central branch of Bank Melli Iran in Takyeh Dowlat, Tehran. The bank was initially registered as &quot;Bank Saderat va Ma&#x27;aden&quot; (Bank of Exports and Mines) in the Tehran Companies Registration Office. The bank officially began operations on November 13, 1952, with the opening of its first branch, which employed 25 staff members. By the end of its first year, the bank&#x27;s balance sheet showed total deposits of about 17.6 million rials, loans and credit facilities of about 67 million rials, total assets equivalent to 44.2 million rials, and a net profit of about 700,000 rials. This was achieved with only 10 million rials of its 20 million rial capital paid up. Initially, Mohammad Ali Mofrah invited Edward Joseph, a well-known banking expert at the time, to serve as the bank&#x27;s CEO. Joseph led the bank for the first two years. In 1954, Mofrah was appointed CEO by the bank&#x27;s board of directors. He remained in this position for 23 years until late 1977 when he resigned. In June 1978, Mofrah completely withdrew from the bank&#x27;s board of directors. In 1963, the bank&#x27;s name was changed to its current form, &quot;Bank Saderat Iran&quot; (Export Bank of Iran).

===After 1979===
On 7 June 1979, after the Iranian Revolution, all Iranian private banks were nationalized, quite to the dismay of the founding families, and became state-owned. In 1980, branches and sub-branches of BSI in the Iranian provinces were turned into independent banks, named Bank Saderat Ostan (province). Today, BSI has 29 owned provincial bank subsidiaries and over 200 affiliated companies, supervised by Ghadir Investment Company. Iranian banks are administered on the basis of a law passed by the Islamic Revolution Council on 25 September 1979, and the provisions of its Articles of Association.

Bank Saderat is used by the Government of Iran to transfer money to what the U.S. has stated are designated terrorist organizations, including Hezbollah, Hamas, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

Under the Iranian Transactions Regulations (31 CFR Part 560) in 2008, U.S. banks may process certain funds transfers involving an Iranian bank, such as transfers for authorized or exempt transactions and &quot;U-turn&quot; transactions. U-turn transactions allow U.S. banks to process payments involving Iran that begin and end with a non-Iranian foreign bank. Bank Saderat will not be able to participate in any transfers involving U.S. banks, effective from the date that the amendment to the regulations is filed with the U.S. Federal Register. By prohibiting U-turn and all other transactions with Bank Saderat, the bank is denied all direct and indirect access to the U.S. financial system.

Bank Saderat Iran currently conducts banking in the UAE, handling Iranian trade in and out of Dubai. The bank mainly deals in project financing, letters of credit and bank guarantees (demand guarantees), whereas other activities remains less important.

In February 2013, the European General Court in Luxembourg ruled to annul sanctions by the European Union (EU) against the bank, stating that the EU &quot;is in breach of the obligation to state reasons and the obligation to disclose to the applicant ... the evidence adduced against it&quot;. The EU may appeal the decision. As of 2016, the EU asset freeze was still in effect.

In 2019 an EU court rejected BSI&#x27;s appeal for £78.7m in damages the bank claimed to have suffered after the EU placed it on their sanctions list.

===Logo===
Bank Saderat Iran&#x27;s logo has undergone several transformations since its inception:
*The original logo (1952-1979): Depicted a winged horse with the phrase &quot;Bank Saderat Iran&quot; above it. This design was proposed by Edward Joseph, the bank&#x27;s first CEO, who based it on an antique ring he had purchased. The horse symbolized speed, endurance, and nobility, while its wings represented ambition and openness. The logo resembled the seal of Anushirvan, a Sassanid king.
*Post-Islamic Revolution logo (1979-1990): Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the logo was changed to feature a map of Iran showing provincial centers, reflecting the bank&#x27;s regionalization.
*Current logo (1990-present): Introduced in 1990, the current logo depicts two hands and a coin. This design is still in use today.

The initial design of the current logo was commissioned by the bank&#x27;s public relations department in 1990 and created by Esmail Kia-Moghaddam. Subsequently, at the bank&#x27;s request, Morteza Momayez made modifications to the design. This collaboration later led to a dispute between the two designers over the authorship of the final work.

<text>The Imperial Bank of Persia () was a British bank that operated as the central bank and bank of issue in Iran (formerly known as Persia until 1935) between 1889 and 1929. It was established in 1885 with a concession from the Persian government to Baron Julius De Reuter (born Israel Beer Josaphat) a German–Jewish banker and businessman who later became a Christian and a British subject.

The bank was the first modern bank in Iran and introduced European banking ideas to a country in which they were previously unknown. The legal centre of the bank was in London and whilst it was subject to British law, its activities were based in Tehran. It also had operations in other Middle Eastern countries. It was later named British Bank of the Middle East (BBME) and is now called HSBC Bank Middle East Limited. After the Iranian Revolution of 1979, all the Iranian activities of this bank were transferred to Bank Tejarat.

Nineteenth-century Iran has been described as &quot;one of the most backward countries in the world.&quot; As usury was forbidden under Islam, the traditional money lenders in Iran were the Jewish sarrafs, who continued to dominate the field after the Imperial Bank&#x27;s arrival due to greater loan flexibility and cultural ties. At the time the only form of money in circulation was gold and silver coins.

Reuter was granted the Reuter concession in 1872 which granted him exclusive rights over virtually all the resources in the land of Persia. While the real reason Reuter wanted the concession was in order to develop the railroad in Persia, it also gave him monopoly over banking for sixty years. The concession was hidden from the British government till the last minute, and alarmed both the British and Russian governments upon its revealing. The concession was resented by the local population, which protested that the Shah had granted all the resources of the land to a foreigner and by Russians who saw the British competing with their interest in Persia. Due to mounting pressure, the Shah subsequently cancelled the concession in 1873, citing the fact that Reuter failed to initiate the railway project within 15 months.
Reuter was not to go down without a fight. However it was not until 1889 that he was able to get exclusive banking and mining rights for sixty years. Although this new concession was not as immense as the first one, it still granted him valuable control over Persian banking and mining with the energetic support of British minister, Henry Drummond Wolff.

The Imperial Bank of Persia was finally established in 1889 on the basis of the 1872 concession to Baron Julius De Reuter from the Persian government (Reuter concession) which made it the state bank, with the exclusive right to issue notes and tax free status for sixty years. The Imperial Bank was publicly floated in London.

There was a similar Russian bank known as the Loan and Discount Bank of Persia (&quot;Bānk-e Esteqrāżī-e Rūs&quot;) which was founded in 1890. The Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 split Iran into a Russian and British sphere of influence. It assigned to the Russian Loan and Discount Bank the revenues from the amortization of Persian debts in northern Iran, and the same for the British Imperial Bank in southern Iran.

Between 1889 and 1928, the bank operated as the central bank and bank of issue of Iran, and held a virtual monopoly on banking in the country. Sir William Keswick was the bank&#x27;s chairman. The bank was principally funded by Glyn, Mills &amp; Co., J. Henry Schröder &amp; Co. and David Sassoon &amp; Co. Despite holding a monopoly, the bank&#x27;s management was farcical, according to Geoffrey Jones, and the bank struggled to make a profit. However, Jones also notes that British banks in this period were allowed to disguise their profits by making transfers to or from &quot;inner&quot; or &quot;secret&quot; reserves before reaching their published profits figure. The Imperial bank&#x27;s real profits were on average twice as high as the published profits between 1890 and 1952. The bank contributed to the Iranian economy by mobilizing domestic savings, but many were doubtful of the real use of these savings as the Bank often &quot;discriminated against Persians in giving credit&quot;. In 1927, 80% of the loans granted in Bushehr, Shiraz and Esfahan were to finance Iranian export of opium, whereas most of the loans in the northern cities related to the trade with Russia. The imperial bank did not employ locals as managers; in contrast, the Imperial Ottoman Bank, which was under mixed British, French and Turkish ownership employed middle eastern nationals in managerial positions. The bank&#x27;s first chief executive, Joseph Rabino, born in London to an Italian Jewish family, was always regarded with great suspicion by his board.
He served eighteen years in Persia and was instrumental in building up the bank&#x27;s reputation. At the time, Persians were wary of giving up silver and gold coins for paper notes. He ordered all branches to keep enough silver coins to be able to redeem paper notes for silver on demand. However bank runs did occur in the early years of the bank, and these runs were sometimes instigated by the Russians who were the British rival in Persia. The bank issued only small notes in the early years to be able to redeem the notes for silver even in the remote areas. With the protection of Persian soldiers, the bank supplied even remote branches with enough silver coins.
The bank&#x27;s high level contact in Tehran was general Albert Houtum-Schindler who was, like Reuter, a British subject of German origin. Schindler lived in Persia for many years and was the most informed member of the European community in Persia at the time. Henry Drummond Wolff liked him so much that he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the foreign office to engage him as a member of Legation staff. Reuter employed him instead. Schindler and Rabino were instrumental in increasing the bank&#x27;s reputation.

The bank was instrumental in providing British loans to the Shah between 1892 and 1911. These loans were secured using Caspian fisheries and the custom dues of the Persian Gulf ports and raised the alarm of Persian nationalists.
By 1928 the bank had 24 branches in all major Iranian cities.

Between 1928 and 1952, the Imperial Bank was subject to criticism and attack from the nationalistic Iranian governments. Bank Melli, an Iranian-controlled central bank, was established in 1928. In 1933, Imperial Bank was forced to relinquish its note-issuing powers. In the 1930s, exchange controls and barter agreements destroyed the Imperial Bank&#x27;s business in financing foreign trade. Imperial Bank began to rapidly lose market share to Bank Melli, and by 1939 the Imperial Bank held just 9 percent of Iranian bank deposits. The bank sold off half of its branches in the 1930s.

In the late 1940s, the bank opened branches in the Persian Gulf States, and was the first bank in Kuwait, Dubai and Oman. In 1952 the bank abandoned the Iranian market and renamed itself the British Bank of the Middle East. In 1959 the British Bank of the Middle East was acquired by Hongkong Bank in a friendly takeover, and now forms part of its HSBC Bank Middle East subsidiary.

==Assessment==
According to Jones, &quot;the Bank was widely seen as an agent of British imperialism, and with reason&quot;. Jones argues that during the two World Wars and in the early 1920s, the bank placed British diplomatic interests before those of Iran&#x27;s elites.

<text>Dutch Gold is a low-cost, imported, pilsner lager beer sold only in Ireland. It was launched there in 1995.

==The beer==
The beer is distributed in Ireland by &quot;Comans Beverages&quot;, an importer and distributor of beers wines and spirits located in Tallaght, County Dublin. The beer originally contained 4.2% alcohol by volume. This was changed initially to 4% and then in 2022 to 3.5% alcohol by volume in order to align prices with Ireland’s newly introduced minimum alcohol unit pricing laws. It is described by the distributor as having &quot;a crisp, clean, fresh flavour&quot;.

==Irish retailing==
In the Irish canned beer market, Dutch Gold has a market share of between 11% and 14%, making it the nation&#x27;s third most popular beer after Budweiser and Heineken as of 2007. Dutch Gold is not advertised in the media, rather favouring in-store advertising. Competitive pricing and a variety of multi-pack offers are the primary promotional methods.

==Social and cultural implications==
In 2006, the Gardaí launched a campaign against anti-social behaviour in Lucan under the name &#x27;Operation Dutch Gold&#x27;. The distributors of the product, Comans Wholesale of Tallaght, complained that the naming of the project was unfair to them.

In 2005, University College Dublin had a &quot;Dutch Gold Society&quot; on campus, in a tribute to the beer.

<doc id="1043992" wikidata="Q12164" url="?curid=1043992" title="Ponferrada">
<text>Ponferrada () is a city of Spain, located in the autonomous community of Castile and León. Ponferrada, the second most populated municipality of the Province of León, is also the capital city of El Bierzo, the only &quot;comarca&quot; recognized as an administrative entity by law in the region.

Surrounded by mountains, the city straddles the course of the Sil River. It is the last major town on the French route of the Camino de Santiago before it reaches Santiago de Compostela. In 2021, it had a population of 63,747.

== Etymology ==
Ponferrada comes from the Latin &quot;Pons Ferrata&quot;, which it translates to Iron Bridge.

== History ==

The place traces its origin back to 928 gifting to the of a &quot;villa&quot; between the Sil and the Boeza by Lupo and his wife, which possessed &quot;ferrum&quot; (iron) and was located at the feet of an abandoned castrum.

The name of the city derives from the iron reinforcements added to the ancient bridge over the river Sil (Latin &quot;pons&quot; for &quot;bridge&quot; and &quot;ferrata&quot; for &quot;iron&quot;), commissioned in 1082 by Bishop Osmundo of Astorga to facilitate the crossing of the Sil to pilgrims in their way to Santiago de Compostela.

From 1211 to 1312, Ponferrada was a holding of the Order of the Temple.

The railroad arrived in Ponferrada in 1881, and during World War I local tungsten deposits were exploited to supply the arms industry. In 1918, the Ponferrada Mining, Iron and Steel Company (&#x27;) was founded to exploit coal deposits in the region, and it grew to become Spain&#x27;s largest coal mining corporation. The Spanish National Energy Corporation (Endesa) was founded in 1944, and in 1949, it opened Spain&#x27;s first coal-fueled power plant in Ponferrada, &quot;Compostilla I&quot;. In 1960, the Bárcena Dam (&#x27;) opened and by the second half of the 20th century the economy of the city was mainly based on mining and electricity generation, both hydroelectric and coal-fueled.

Starting in the late 1980s, most mines were closed, and after the collapse of the mining industry Ponferrada was in a crisis for a while. However, in the late 1990s, the city underwent a major transformation with the establishment of several industrial and service firms, the reintroduction of commercial wine production, the opening of a local branch of the University of León offering several undergraduate degrees, and in general, an improvement of the town&#x27;s infrastructure. The economy is now based mainly on tourism, agriculture (fruit and wine), wind power generation and slate mining, with a constant small population increase.

Important factors contributing to the recent boom of the tourism industry are the increasing popularity of the Way of St. James (; a pilgrimage route that goes from France to Santiago de Compostela, Galicia), the designation in 1997 of Las Médulas as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the development of rural tourism lodging and wineries in the area. The Energy City Foundation was established in Ponferrada in 2006 and is currently overseeing the construction of the National Energy Museum (&quot;&quot;) in the city, as well as sponsoring several other initiatives that should further boost tourism and the economy of the city and its region.

== Tourism ==
=== Main sights ===
Ponferrada lies in the Way of St. James, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and every year many pilgrims pass through the city in their way to Santiago de Compostela. Las Médulas, ancient Roman gold mines also included in the UNESCO World Heritage Site List, are only a few kilometres away from the city.

Ponferrada is also noted for its &quot;Castillo de los Templarios&quot;, a Templar castle which covers approximately . In 1178, Ferdinand II of León donated the city to the Templar order for protecting the pilgrims on the Way of St. James who passed through El Bierzo in their road to Santiago de Compostela.

The castle hosted the Knights Templar&#x27;s Grand Master of Castille. However, the Templars were only able to enjoy the use of their fortress for about twenty years before the order was disbanded and its properties confiscated in 1311. Several noble houses fought over the assets until Alfonso XI allotted them to the Count of Lemos in 1340. Finally, the Catholic Monarchs incorporated Ponferrada and its castle into the Crown in 1486. As with many other historical sites in Europe, many of the blocks that at one point formed the walls of the castle were removed and used in local construction projects.

The Basilica de la Encina is a church built in the Renaissance style in 1573. Its baroque tower dates from 1614.

The El Bierzo Museum (&#x27;) offers a tour of the history of the region and hosts several important archeological pieces, while the Museum of Radio (&#x27;) offers an interesting tour of the history of the radio in Spain. The National Energy Museum (&#x27;) is sponsored by the Energy City Foundation (&#x27;). It includes the restored building and equipment of &quot;Compostilla I&quot;, Spain&#x27;s first coal-fueled power plant opened in 1949 in Ponferrada.

The church of Santiago de Peñalba (an example of Mozarabic art), the Hermitage of Santo Tomás de las Ollas (10th century) and the Romanesque Church of Santa María de Vizbayo are also nearby.

The highest view from the city, is the Torre de la Rosaleda, in the Roseleda district, the tallest building in Ponferrada.

=== Outdoor activities ===
The city and its surroundings offer many opportunities for outdoor activities. There are many easily accessible hiking and cycling routes nearby, both on and off-road, including the 330 kilometer long &quot;La Mirada Circular&quot; which circles the whole El Bierzo valley. Cycling is also very popular, as the valley provides opportunities to exercise in both flat and inclined terrain, on and off-road.

El Morredero peak (2,135 m), 20 km from Ponferrada in the Aquilianos mountains, hosts a small ski resort.

It is possible to visit many wineries in the area to try the local wines and food, or simply visit the vineyards.

=== Events ===

== Sports ==

The local football team, SD Ponferradina currently plays in the Spanish 2nd Division. The team had played for most of its history in the 2nd Division B of the Spanish Football League, however in the 2006–07 season the team was promoted for the first time to the 2nd Division, quite an achievement for a medium-sized city.

There are many intramural and regional leagues in football and other sports, including basketball, futsal, and athletics. The city&#x27;s athletics stadium is named after former 800m world champion Colomán Trabado.

Ponferrada hosted the 2014 UCI Road World Championships from 21 to 28 September 2014. The city was appointed to organize it, on 21 September 2011.

<text>Humbert Wolfe CB CBE (5 January 1885 – 5 January 1940) was an Italian-born British poet, man of letters and civil servant.

==Biography==
Humbert Wolfe was born in Milan, Italy, and came from a Jewish family background, his father, Martin Wolff, being of German descent and his mother, Consuela, &quot;née&quot; Terraccini, Italian. He was brought up in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire and was a pupil at Bradford Grammar School. Wolfe attended Wadham College at the University of Oxford.

He was one of the most popular British authors of the 1920s. He was also a translator of Heinrich Heine, Edmond Fleg (1874–1963) and Eugene Heltai (Heltai Jenő). A Christian convert, he remained very aware of his Jewish heritage.

His career was in the Civil Service, beginning in the Board of Trade and then in the Ministry of Labour. By 1940 he had a position of high responsibility. His work was recognised with a CBE and then a CB.

Wolfe said in an interview with &quot;Twentieth Century Authors&quot; that he was &quot;of no political creed, except that his general view is that money and its possessors should be abolished.&quot;

Wolfe&#x27;s verses have been set to music by a number of composers, including Gustav Holst in his &quot;12 Humbert Wolfe Songs&quot;, Op. 48 (1929).

He had a long-term affair with the novelist Pamela Frankau, while remaining married.

He died on his 55th birthday.

Though his works are little read today, the following epigram from &quot;The Uncelestial City&quot; continues to be widely known and quoted:

:&lt;poem&gt;
:You cannot hope 
::to bribe or twist,
:thank God! the 
::British journalist.
:But, seeing what 
::the man will do
:unbribed, there&#x27;s 
::no occasion to.&lt;/poem&gt;
In 2014–2015, five busts of the poet were created and sited by sculptor Anthony Padgett to mark the 75th anniversary of Wolfe&#x27;s death.
The sculptures have been sited where Wolfe died in London – 75 Eccleston Square, where he studied – Wadham College Oxford, where there is a collection of his manuscripts – 
New York Public Library and where he grew up – Bradford Library and Bradford Grammar School.

<text>The Type 56 (; literally; &quot;Assault Rifle, Model of 1956&quot;) is a Chinese 7.62×39mm automatic rifle, a licensed derivative of the Soviet-designed AK-47 (specifically Type 3 variant).

The Type 56 rifle was adopted by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) designated as the &quot;Type 1956 Submachine Gun&quot;, because the Type 56 took the role of SMG rather than infantry service rifle in the PLA in the rifle&#x27;s early service years. Production started in 1956 at State Factory 66 but was eventually handed over to Norinco and PolyTech, who continue to manufacture the rifle primarily for export.

==Service history==
Nikita Khrushchev coming to power marked a shift in the style of Soviet aid to China. Whereas the Stalin era typically saw only old or obsolete arms provided as aid, under Khrushchev active Soviet equipment and production technology was given instead. In 1955, the Soviet Union provided China with information and production equipment for the AK and SKS.

During the Cold War period, the Type 56 was exported to many countries and guerrilla forces throughout the world. Many of these rifles found their way to battlefields in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East and were used alongside other Kalashnikov pattern weapons from both the Soviet Union as well as the Warsaw Pact nations of Eastern Europe.

Chinese support for North Vietnam before the mid-1960s meant that the Type 56 was frequently encountered by American soldiers in the hands of either Viet Cong guerrillas or PAVN soldiers during the Vietnam War. The Type 56 was discovered far more often than the original Russian-made AK-47s or AKMs.

When relations between China and North Vietnam crumbled in the 1970s and the Sino-Vietnamese War began, the Vietnamese government still possessed vast quantities of Type 56 rifles in its inventory. The People&#x27;s Liberation Army still used the Type 56 as its standard weapon during this time as well. Thus, Chinese and Vietnamese forces fought each other using the same rifle.
The Type 56 was used extensively by Iranian forces during the Iran–Iraq War of the 1980s, with Iran purchasing large quantities of weapons from China for its armed forces. During the war, Iraq also purchased a small quantity, despite them being a major recipient of Soviet weapons and assistance during the conflict. This was done in conjunction with their purchasing of a large number of AKMs from Eastern Europe. 

In the United Kingdom and United States, the Type 56 and its derivatives are frequently used in the filming of movies and television shows, standing in for Russian-made AK-47s due to their rarity among Kalashnikov style weapons. Type 56s are oftentimes visually modified to resemble other AK variants. 
In the mid-1980s, Sri Lanka began to replace its British L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle (SLR) and German HK G3s with the Type 56-2. Currently, the side-folding stock variant (Type 56-2) issued as the standard primary firearm.

The Type 81, Type 95 and Type 03 replaced the Type 56 in PLA front line service, but the Type 56 remains in use with reserve and militia units. Type 56s are still in production by Norinco for export customers.

During the Soviet–Afghan War in the 1980s, many Type 56 rifles were supplied to Afghan Mujahideen guerrillas to fight Soviet forces. The rifles were supplied by China, Pakistan and the US who obtained them from third party arms dealers. There is photographic evidence from Soviet/Russian sources where captured Type 56 rifles were utilized by Soviet soldiers in lieu of their standard-issue AKM and AK-74 rifles.
Use of the Type 56 in Afghanistan also continued well into the early 21st century as the standard rifle of the Taliban such as when Taliban forces seized control of Kabul in 1996 (a majority of the Chinese small arms used by the Taliban were provided by Pakistan).

In 1987, Michael Ryan used a legally owned Type 56 rifle, and two other firearms, in the Hungerford massacre in the United Kingdom, in which he shot 32 people, 17 of whom died. The attack led to the passage of Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988, which bans ownership of semi-automatic centre-fire rifles and restricts the use of shotguns.

In the United States, a Type 56 rifle, purchased in Oregon under a false name, was used in the 1989 Stockton schoolyard shooting in which Patrick Purdy fired over 100 rounds to shoot one teacher and 34 children, killing five. The shooting led to the passage of California&#x27;s Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989. A Type 56, along with a Type 56 S-1, were used by Larry Phillips, Jr. and Emil Mătăsăreanu during the 1997 North Hollywood shootout.

==Compared to AK-47 and AKM==


Originally, the Type 56 was a direct copy of the AK-47&#x27;s final iteration, the Type 3 AK-47, and featured a milled receiver. Starting in the mid-1960s, the guns were manufactured with stamped receivers much like the Soviet AKM. Visually, most versions of the Type 56 are distinguished from the AK-47 and AKM by the fully enclosed hooded front sight (all other AK pattern rifles, including those made in Russia, have a partially open front sight). Many versions also feature a folding bayonet attached to the barrel just aft of the muzzle. There are three different types of bayonets made for Type 56 rifles.

*The Type 56 has a 1.6mm stamped receiver (like the RPK, although it lacks the reinforced trunnion of the RPK) versus the 1mm stamping of the AKM. Also uses a different riveting pattern that is similar to the RPK. Certain versions of the 56S/MAK-90 have a milled receiver.
*The barrel on the Type 56 is similar to the AK-47 and heavier than that of the AKM though is pinned in like the AKM and unlike the AK-47. Military issued versions of the Type 56 also lack the threaded muzzle found on the AK-47 and AKM, this means they cannot use an AKM compensator or blank-firing device. Commercial versions of the Type 56 may or may not have a threaded muzzle.
*The front sights are fully enclosed with a hood, compared to the AKM and AK-47 which have partially opened &quot;ears&quot;. The front sight base has a shape similar to the AK-47 and may also have a SKS style folding spike bayonet (nicknamed the &quot;pig sticker&quot;) as opposed to the lug for detachable knife bayonets on the AK-47 and AKM. There are three different types of spike bayonets made for the Type 56 and the Type 56 assault rifle is the only AK variant that utilizes a spike bayonet. Certain versions of the Type 56-2 support standard AK-47 and AKM bayonets.
*Has the double hook disconnector of the AK-47 rather than the single hook disconnector of the AKM. As a result, it also lacks the hammer release delay device of the AKM, otherwise known as the rate reducer. The lack of hammer retarder is perhaps due to a preference of a slightly higher rate of fire, and simplicity. And did not have anything to do with thickness of the receiver, as the RPK included the hammer retarder also.
*Has &quot;in the white&quot; bolt carrier, while the AKM bolt carrier is blued. Also lacks the various lightening cuts, though has a flat firing pin. Many civilian/export versions have a firing pin spring to prevent possible slamfires when used with softer commercial primers as opposed to the original free-floating type. Some were added by importers rather than being a factory equipped part.
*Has the flat/smooth handguards of the AK-47, with a storage slit underneath on versions equipped with the spike bayonet. Uniquely, it lacks vent cuts on the upper gas tube heatguard. Also retains a metal ferrule that sits between the lower handguard and the front of the receiver that the AK-47 had.
*The pistol grip is the same kind as the AK-47 being made out of wood with a metal ferrule between it and the receiver instead of the later one piece bakelite like the AKM. The Type 56-2 uses the AKM style with slightly different shape.
*The trigger guard is held in place with only three rivets (one on each side and one beneath the pistol grip) whereas the AK-47 and AKM have five (two on each side and one beneath the pistol grip).
*Has a smooth dust cover like the AK-47 and unlike the ribbed dust cover of the AKM. However, it utilizes the simpler dual U-shaped recoil spring guide of the AKM instead of the telescoping rod of the AK-47.
*Has a blued finish like the AK-47 and unlike the AKM, which has a black oxide finish or a parkerized finish.
*Like the AK-47, sights will only adjust to 800 metres, whereas AKM sights adjust to 1000 metres. It also retains the button on the right side.
*Nearly all Type 56&#x27;s lack the side mount plate that was featured on many variations of the AK-47 and AKM.
*The gas relief ports are located on the gas tube like the AK-47, unlike the AKM which had the gas relief ports relocated forward to the gas block. The gas block is also like the AK-47 in that it has the forward sling loop (instead of the handguard) and a cleaning rod capture.
*The fixed stock of a Type 56 has a less in-line stock like the AK-47, opposed to the AKM which has a straighter stock. It, however, uses the AKM style single upper tang insert type attachment method and has the rear sling mount on the underside of the stock as opposed to the AK-47 dual tang type and receiver side sling mount. Its rear trunnion is also very similar to the AKM, though the distance between the rivets is different. Certain versions of the 56S/MAK-90 have an angled receiver back wall, though these are typically milled variants with a thumb hole stock.
*The under folders have stamped stocks like the AKMS but only lock on the left and are angled downwards like the AKS-47. The stocks are also typically made out of thicker steel, thus have fewer reinforcing ribs and detents, and they also lack the pistol grip reinforcement plate and true rear trunnion of the AKMS, having a simple pseudo end-cap rear trunnion, likely due to the thicker receiver.

==Variants==
*Type 56 – Basic variant, adopted in 1956. Features a fixed wooden stock and folding spike bayonet. In the mid-1960s production switched from machined to stamped receivers, while the bayonet became optional. Still used by Chinese reserve and militia units.
*Type 56-1 – Copy of the AKS, with an under-folding steel shoulder stock and the bayonet removed to make the weapon easier to carry. As with the original Type 56, milled receivers were replaced by stamped receivers in the mid-1960s, making the Type 56-1 an equivalent to the Russian AKMS. Civilian semi-auto versions (Type 56S-I) may have the spike bayonet added, though it is worth noting that this is not the original military configuration.
*Type 56-2 – Improved variant introduced in 1980, with a side-folding stock and dark orange bakelite furniture. The stock also houses a cleaning kit, which both underfolding AKs (all nations) and other sidefolding AKs lacked, instead requiring a separate pouch. It also allows a traditional detachable bayonet, both AK-47 and AKM styles, as an option in addition to the folding spike style. Mainly manufactured for export and rare in China as the Type 81 was already in production by the time of conception.
**7.62 RK 56 TP – Modified Type 56-2 in China for Finnish use, with a new hammer spring that allows firing of Finnish 7.62x39.
*QBZ-56C (Type 56C) – Short-barrel version, introduced in 1991 for the domestic and export market. The QBZ-56C as it is officially designated in China, is a carbine variant of the Type 56-2 and supplied in limited quantities to some PLA units. The Chinese Navy is now the most prominent user. Development began in 1988, after it was discovered that the Type 81 assault rifle was too difficult to shorten. In order to further reduce weight, the bayonet lug was removed. The QBZ-56C is often carried with a twenty-round box magazine, although it is capable of accepting a standard Type 56 thirty-round magazine. It also has a sidefolding stock in addition to a muzzle booster, giving it a similar appearance to the AKS-74U.
* Type 56S or Type 56 &quot;Sporter&quot;, also known as the AK47S, AKS-762 and MAK-90 (Modified AK-1990) – Semi-automatic only civilian version. Later versions were modified to meet the requirements of a 1989 Executive Order by President George H. W. Bush prohibiting importation of certain &#x27;assault rifle&#x27; configurations of military-style semi-automatic rifles such as the Norinco AKM/AK-47. These modifications included a one-piece U.S.-made thumbhole stock to replace the separate Chinese-made buttstock and pistol grip of the original AK rifle and the inclusion of a rivet on the receiver preventing use of standard AK-47, RPK, or AKM magazines.
** 56S Galil sidefolder – Special version of the 56S/MAC-90 with an IMI Galil style side folding stock. Was exclusive to the US market.
** The Legend – Another version of the 56S/MAK-90 except configured to look like the Type 3 AK-47. It is extremely faithful to the Type 3 design, even having a milled receiver and original AK-47 style bayonet lug, but does retain some manufacturing differences from the Type 56 such as the pinned in barrel, lack of vent cuts on the gas tube heat guard, only 3 rivets on the trigger guard, the stamped recoil guide rod, spring loaded firing pin and variance in machining such as on the receiver and lightening cuts. Like the previous, US market only.
* Type 56M – RPK style LMG version of the Type 56. Utilizes a standard Type 56 stamped receiver and front trunnion, likely due to their rigidity, and its bi-pod is more RPD like then RPK, being tubular. It seems to have two configurations with only minor cosmetic changes, one with standard AK-47/M open sights with &quot;ears&quot; and the bi-pod directly behind the front sight base, and a second configuration with typical Type 56 enclosed &quot;hooded&quot; sights and the bi-pod in front of the front sight base near the muzzle. The latter version usually is seen with a birdcage flash hider or AK-74 style muzzle brake. Like the Type 56-2, it was only made for export as the Type 81 LMG was selected for military service instead. Civilian semi-auto sporter versions are known as the Type 87S or NHM 91. The semi-auto versions have also been sold with standard Type 56 stocks instead of the RPD &quot;club foot&quot; style as well as thumbhole variants after 1989. A rare version known as the &quot;National Match&quot; was once sold with a milled receiver and scope and scope mount.
* Type 84 – Export version of the Type 56 rifle chambered for the 5.56×45mm NATO round. Also has underfolder (Type 84-1) and sidefolder (Type 84-2) versions. Civilian semi-auto version known as Type 84S and AKS-223. Special matte black synthetic versions were also available as the Type 84-3, Type 84-4 (underfolder) and Type 84-5 (sidefolder).
* Type 86S – Semi automatic bullpup version.
* KL-7.62 – Iranian copy of the Type 56. The original version of the KL-7.62 was indistinguishable from the Type 56, but in recent years DIO appears to have made some improvements to the Type 56 design, adding a plastic stock and handguards (rather than wood) and a ribbed receiver cover (featured on most AKM variants, but missing from the Type 56), as well as picatinny rails on newer versions. They consist of the KLS (AKM wooden stock) and the KLF (AKM folding stock).
* MAZ – Sudanese licensed copy of the Type 56 made by Military Industry Corporation.
* ASh78 (Automatiku Shqiptar 78) – Albanian licensed copy of the Type 56.
* TUL-1 - North Vietnamese-made variant, but with stock of an RPK, barrel sights from an RPD. The TUL-1&#x27;s body was thin, only 1 mm compared to the 1.5 mm of an RPK. It was also heavier and had an inferior rate of fire compared to the RPK. However, the firing rate and effective range of the weapon was better than an AK-47-based rifle. The TUL-1s were manufactured between 1970–1974 and ended after Vietnam obtained production rights to the RPK itself. They&#x27;re known to use 30-round magazines from AK-47-based rifles with the occasional 40-round magazine.
* KA2-5 - Clone made in Myanmar by the Kachin Independence Army.

==Other Type 56 weapons==
The &quot;Type 56&quot; designation was also used for Chinese versions of the SKS and of the RPD, known as the Type 56 carbine and Type 56 light machine gun respectively. 

Unlike the popular Type 56 rifle, all Type 56 carbines have been removed from military service, except a few used for ceremonial purposes and by local Chinese militia.

<doc id="1043998" wikidata="Q1722363" url="?curid=1043998" title="Kalkan">
<text>Kalkan is a neighbourhood of the municipality and district of Kaş, Antalya Province, Turkey. Its population is 3,926 (2022). Before the 2013 reorganisation, it was a town (&quot;belde&quot;). It is an important tourist destination on the Mediterranean coast. The area includes historical sites (such as Tlos and Kekova) and fine beaches (including Patara Beach and Kaputaş Beach).

Kalkan is an old fishing town, and the only safe harbour between Kaş and Fethiye; it is known for its white-washed houses, descending to the sea, and its brightly coloured bougainvilleas. It averages 300 days of sunshine a year. The word &quot;Kalkan&quot; in Turkish either means shield or turbot referring to the town&#x27;s fishing status.

A substantial Christian community of Greeks lived in Kalkan until the 1920s and the town was called Kalamaki. They left in 1923 during the exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey after the Greco-Turkish War and emigrated mainly to Attica, where they founded the new town of Kalamaki. Abandoned Greek houses can still be seen at Kalkan.

Kalkan was an important harbour town until the 1970s as the only seaport for the environs. It declined after the construction of the Fethiye road but revived after the emergence of the tourism industry in the region.

Although part of the Antalya province administratively, Kalkan is connected more closely to Fethiye economically and for transportation.

&quot;The Independent&quot; listed Kalkan among the best tourist destinations for 2007. The paper recommended Kalkan, especially for those seeking a romantic holiday and who do not want to travel far from their home country in Europe. According to a 2012 survey 96% of visitors to Kalkan during 2011 were from the United Kingdom.

<doc id="1044003" wikidata="Q4959119" url="?curid=1044003" title="Breaching round">
<text>A breaching round or slug-shot is a shotgun shell specially made for door breaching. It is typically fired at a range of 6 inches (15 cm) or less, aimed at the hinges or the area between the doorknob and lock and doorjamb, and is designed to destroy the object it hits and then disperse into a relatively harmless powder.

==Design and construction==

Breaching rounds are designed to destroy door deadbolts, locks, and hinges without risking lives by ricocheting or by flying on at lethal speed through the door, as traditional buckshot can. These frangible rounds are made of a dense sintered material, often metal powder in a binder such as wax, which can destroy a lock or hinge and then immediately disperse. They are used by military and SWAT teams to quickly force entry into a locked room. Amongst police, these rounds are nicknamed &quot;master keys&quot;, and their use is known as &quot;Avon calling&quot;, alluding to the Avon brand of cosmetics which was sold door-to-door. Ideally, breaching rounds may be used in a standard combat shotgun or riot shotgun, or in a specialized shotgun, often attached to a rifle, such as the KAC Masterkey or M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System. The most effective use of this round is with a &quot;stand-off breacher&quot; attached to the muzzle of a specially converted shotgun. The stand-off is held on the surface of the door and vents gases to prevent overpressure. The British SAS also use these breaching rounds in their shotguns- most commonly the Remington pump action.

Though designed not to endanger people behind or around a door, a breaching round is easily lethal if fired directly at a human target.

Examples of breaching rounds:

* Royal Arms has made the TESAR round for over 25 years using a frangible copper slug of various weights and configurations, with different loads for different applications. It is used by many military and law enforcement agencies around the world.
* The US military M1030 breaching round is a 12-gauge, shell that uses a projectile made of powdered steel, bound with wax. 
* The Clucas Method of Entry Hatton round is a 12-gauge, magnum shell that uses a frangible projectile, consisting of a high-density wax binder.
*Firequest makes a 12 gauge frangible slug named the door breaching cartridge. The slug consists of copper and tin powder.

<text>R. Torre &amp; Company, Inc., is an American soft drink and brewing company that produces the Torani brand of flavoring syrups, sauces, and blended drink bases. The company was founded in 1925 by Rinaldo and Ezilda Torre.

Torani dates back to 1925, when husband and wife Rinaldo and Ezilda Torre, immigrants from Lucca, Italy, introduced Torani syrups to the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco. Mixing their syrup recipes with sparkling water, the Torres introduced the classic Italian soda to local cafes, and soon began mixing, blending and selling Torani Syrups from their Italian wholesale grocery.

In 1957, the Torres&#x27; son-in-law, Harry Lucheta, took over the business and oversaw Torani&#x27;s growth from a local San Francisco business to an international brand.

Torani is currently owned by Paul Lucheta and Lisa Lucheta, grandchildren of the founders Rinaldo and Ezilda Torre. The company employs over 100 people. From the late 1990s until March 2020, Torani&#x27;s headquarters, which include both its business offices and manufacturing facilities, were located in South San Francisco, California, until a March 2020 move to San Leandro during the COVID-19 pandemic. One notable syrup is their Chicken &#x27;N Waffles syrup, originally started as an April Fools&#x27; joke. The current CEO is Melanie Dulbecco.

<doc id="1044010" wikidata="Q102250" url="?curid=1044010" title="Peter Agre">
<text>Peter Agre (; born January 30, 1949) is an American physician, Nobel Laureate, and molecular biologist, Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and director of the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute. In 2003, Agre and Roderick MacKinnon shared the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for &quot;discoveries concerning channels in cell membranes.&quot; Agre was recognized for his discovery of aquaporin water channels. Aquaporins are water-channel proteins that move water molecules through the cell membrane. In 2009, Agre was elected president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and became active in science diplomacy.

==Biography==
Agre is the second of six children born in Northfield, Minnesota, to parents of Norwegian and Swedish descent. Agre is a Lutheran. Fascinated by international travel after a high school camping trip through the Soviet Union, Agre was an inconsistent student until he developed an interest in science from his father who was a college chemistry professor.

Agre graduated from Roosevelt High School (Minnesota) before he received his B.A. in Chemistry from Augsburg University in Minneapolis and his M.D. in 1974 from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. From 1975 to 1978 he completed his clinical training in Internal Medicine at Case Western Reserve University&#x27;s Case Medical Center under Charles C.J. Carpenter. He subsequently did a Hematology-Oncology fellowship at North Carolina Memorial Hospital of UNC Chapel Hill. In 1981, Agre returned to the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine to join the lab of Vann Bennett in the Department of Cell Biology.

In 1984, Agre was recruited onto the faculty of the Department of Medicine led by Victor A. McKusick. He subsequently joined the Department of Biological Chemistry led by Dan Lane. Agre rose to full professor in 1992 and remained at Johns Hopkins until 2005. Agre then served as the Vice Chancellor for Science and Technology at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, where he guided the development of Duke&#x27;s biomedical research. In 2008, he returned to Johns Hopkins, where he directs the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute (JHMRI) in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and holds a joint appointment in the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

===Professional awards===
In addition to the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Agre was elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 2000, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003, the American Philosophical Society in 2004, the National Academy of Medicine in 2005, and the American Society for Microbiology in 2011. Agre has received 19 honorary doctorates from universities around the world, including Japan, Norway, Greece, Mexico, Hungary, and the United States.

In 2004, Agre received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In February 2014, he was named a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University for his accomplishments as an interdisciplinary researcher and excellence in teaching the next generation of scholars. The Bloomberg Distinguished Professorships were established in 2013 by a gift from Michael Bloomberg.

===Personal life===
Agre and his wife Mary have been married since 1975, and have three daughters, one son, and two young granddaughters. Agre is an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award (DESA). Two of his brothers, also physicians, and his son Clarke, a public defender, are also Eagle Scouts. Agre enjoys wilderness canoeing in the arctic and cross-country skiing, having completed the 60 mile Vasaloppet ski race in Sweden five times. Diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 2012, Agre has had to reduce his activities.

&quot;I identify more with Huckleberry Finn than with Albert Einstein,&quot; he told Scouting magazine.

Agre is known among science students for his humanity and humility. He appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, discussing his role as a founding member of Scientists and Engineers for America (SEA), sound science in politics, and the decline of American knowledge of science, among other topics.

As a Johns Hopkins medical student in the early 1970s, Agre worked in the labs of Brad Sack and Pedro Cuatrecasas where he investigated the enterotoxin-induced diarrhea that caused dehydration and death of small children in developing countries. After clinical training, Agre joined Vann Bennett&#x27;s lab in the Cell Biology Department at Johns Hopkins where he studied red cell membranes and identified spectrin deficiency as a common cause of hereditary spherocytosis, a hemolytic anemia with fragile, spherically shaped red cells. In 1984, Agre joined the Department of Medicine where he built his own research program and first isolated the 32 kilodalton core subunit of the Rhesus blood group antigen, RhD.

===Aquaporins===
While studying RhD, Agre&#x27;s team serendipitously discovered a 28 kilodalton red cell membrane protein. Also abundant in kidney tubules, the 28 kDa protein was related to proteins from diverse origins including fruit fly brain, mammalian lens, bacteria, and plants. Since the function was unknown, Agre consulted John C. Parker, his former hematology professor at the University of North Carolina, who suggested that the protein may be the long-sought water channel responsible for rapid movements of water across the membranes of red cells and certain other cell types.

Teaming up with William Guggino at the Department of Physiology at Johns Hopkins, Agre&#x27;s postdoctoral fellow Gregory Preston confirmed water channel function by expressing the cRNA in &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; oocytes (frog eggs) that then became osmotically active and exploded in fresh water. The 28 kDa protein is now known as aquaporin-1 (abbreviated AQP1), the archetypal member of a large family of water channel proteins. Aquaporins are &quot;the plumbing system for cells,&quot; said Agre. Every cell is primarily water. &quot;But the water doesn&#x27;t just sit in the cell, it moves through it in a very organized way. The process occurs rapidly in tissues that have these aquaporins or water channels.&quot; For 100 years, scientists assumed that water leaked through the cell membrane, and some water does. &quot;But the very rapid movement of water through some cells was not explained by this theory,&quot; said Agre.

Agre&#x27;s team and others identified paralogs in different tissues, and twelve aquaporins exist in humans. Permeated by water, aquaporins are required for generation of cerebrospinal fluid, aqueous humour, tears, sweat, saliva, humidification of airways, and renal concentration. Defects include cerebral edema, dry eye, anhydrosis, dehydration and water retention. Permeated by water plus glycerol, aquaglyceroporins confer glycerol uptake to the basal level of skin, glycerol release from fat during fasting, and glycerol uptake by liver where it is converted to glucose. Aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins exist in all life forms including invertebrates, plants, microbes, archaea, and parasites including the plasmodia that cause malaria.
===2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry===
In October 2003, it was announced that the Nobel Prize in Chemistry would go to two medical doctors, Peter Agre and Roderick MacKinnon, &quot;for discoveries concerning channels in cell membranes.&quot; Credited for discovery of the aquaporin water channels, Agre was in bed at 5:30 am when the call came from Stockholm. Upon learning the news later, his mother responded, &quot;That&#x27;s very nice but don&#x27;t let it go to his head.&quot; MacKinnon, credited with solving the structure and selectivity of potassium channels, was traveling back from a weekend fishing trip and only learned the news from colleagues.

===Malaria===
Long interested in diseases of the developing world, Agre and his team investigated aquaporins in malaria parasites, malaria mosquitoes, and cerebral malaria. In 2008, Agre became Director of the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute (JHMRI) at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Launched in 2001 by a gift from Michael Bloomberg and the Bloomberg Philanthropies, JHMRI includes 20 faculty members whose lab efforts include development of mosquitoes resistant to malaria transmission, design of novel malaria vaccines, biological studies of potential malaria drug targets and search for novel anti-malarial medicines.
Fieldwork in rural Africa is central to the JHMRI mission. A long-term partnership was initiated in 2003 with Macha Research Trust, a faith-based research program led by Dr. Philip Thuma that is affiliated with a former mission hospital in rural southern Zambia. With resources from JHMRI, a small modern research campus was constructed where African scientists and visiting scientists from Johns Hopkins are studying malaria drug resistance, mosquito insecticide resistance, and rates of malaria transmission. Since introduction of artemisinin combination therapy in 2003 and distribution of insecticide treated bed nets in 2007, the burden of malaria in small children has declined in Macha by 96%.

Receipt of an International Center of Excellence in Malaria Research Award (ICEMR) from the US National Institutes of Health in 2010 allowed expansion of the JHMRI program in Africa. New field sites were organized in partnership with African agencies in northern Zambia and southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where malaria control has failed, and in eastern Zimbabwe at the border of Mozambique, where malaria has become resurgent.

== Science diplomacy ==
While serving from 2009 to 2011 as president and chair of the board of advisors of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Agre became very active in the AAAS Center for Science Diplomacy. Working with AAAS Chief International Officer, Vaughan Turekian, and former Scientific Advisor to the U.S. Secretary of State, Norman P. Neureiter, Agre led a series of science diplomacy visits to countries with adversarial relationships to the U.S. The objective of each trip was to foster exchanges and collaborations on peaceful scientific projects and thereby reduce tensions.

===Cuba===
The governments of Cuba and the US have maintained a hostile relationship made worse by the embargo that prevented the import of essential goods, equipment and even medicines. The inauguration of Barack Obama in 2009 led to a liberalized interpretation of restrictions by the U.S. government allowing scientific and cultural exchanges between the two countries.
In November 2009, Agre made the first of six trips to Cuba when he led a group of scientists from AAAS to Havana. Two years later, Agre led an extensive series of visits to the Cuban Academy of Sciences and leading Cuban scientific institutions including the institutes for biotechnology, pharmaceutical and vaccine development, a teaching hospital and ELAM (Latin American School of Medicine) Cuba. Invited to lecture at the University of Havana, Agre also met with Fidel Castro who discussed numerous topics including the need for universal health care as one cause for the Cuban Revolution. Agre subsequently led another AAAS visit and served as Honorary President of Biotecnologia Habana 2012 and Plenary Lecturer at Quimcuba 2015.

Despite animosities, Cuba and the U.S. have had a long tradition of scientific interactions that dated from 1900. The outbreak of Yellow Fever at the time of the Spanish–American War resulted in the Yellow Fever Commission led by US Army Major Walter Reed. Working together, Cuban medical scientist, Carlos Finlay, and a young Johns Hopkins faculty member, Jesse William Lazear, proved for the first time that yellow fever was transmitted by mosquitoes. In a fateful experiment, Lazear allowed himself to be bitten by mosquitoes that had fed upon yellow fever patients, and he died of the disease. This discovery led to conquest of Yellow Fever. Cuba always felt that Finlay and Lazear never received proper credit, an issue partially ameliorated by the 2015 visit by the Johns Hopkins Health Advisory Board and plaque unveiling.

===Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (North Korea)===
Referred to as the &quot;Hermit Kingdom,&quot; the DPRK has been nearly totally isolated from the world since the negotiated ceasefire in 1953. Requests for entry by US organizations were rebuffed. Working through the DPRK Ambassador to the UN, an invitation was issued to the Nobel Laureate-led AAAS team in partnership with CRDF Global for a visit hosted by the DPRK State Academy of Sciences in December 2009. Avoiding issues related to weapons development, requests to visit 15 research institutes, universities, the Grand People&#x27;s Study House, and a hospital were all granted. In most cases, the leadership of these institutions had never seen or met an American previously. Potential future scientific collaboration in the life sciences such as medicine development and agricultural research received extensive and enthusiastic discussion. A follow-up visits by DPRK scientific leadership to the AAAS – CRDF team occurred 15 months later at the Carter Center in Atlanta.
A meeting occurred with the leadership of the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST), a private university founded by a Korean-born American businessman. The only English language university in DPRK, PUST draws outstanding undergraduate and graduate students from DPRK and volunteer faculty from abroad. Opening in 2010, PUST is the only campus where westerners can mingle with students in DPRK. Agre provided keynote plenary lectures to the first International Science Symposium at PUST in 2011 and the third symposium in 2015. Invited to participate in a tour of multiple DPRK universities by four Nobel Laureates in 2016, Agre was unable to attend due to a hospitalization. It would have been his fourth trip to the country.

===Myanmar (Burma)===
A visit by Agre and the AAAS Science Diplomacy team to Myanmar occurred in April 2010. Travel was made to the new capital, Naypyidaw, for formal meetings with the Ministry of Forestry and Ministry of Health to discuss malaria. A meeting with faculty of University of Yangon was also held. Despite continued existence of the junta, an impending transition was evident, as meetings with the opposition were arranged in Yangon. Although Aung San Suu Kyi was unavailable as she was still under house arrest, her release occurred six months later, and Myanmar has made solid progress towards liberal democracy.

===Iran (Islamic Republic of Iran)===
Meetings with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi at the New York residence of the Iranian Ambassador to the UN resulted in a June 2012 visit to Tehran by Agre and Norman P. Neureiter. Salehi, a PhD graduate of MIT and former head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, arranged for lectures in multiple universities in Tehran where Agre was appointed visiting professor at the Sharif University of Technology and a private meeting was held with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

==Political activism==

===Thomas Butler Case===
As Chairman of the Committee on Human Rights of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Agre led a group of prominent scientists that defended Thomas C. Butler, an infectious disease researcher from Texas Tech University who in January 2003 voluntarily reported to the university safety office that 30 vials of plague bacteria were missing and had probably been autoclaved or incinerated. Although Butler cooperated with FBI agents, he was accused of lying and was arrested. When he refused to plead guilty, federal prosecutors charged Butler with many confusing charges concerning grant accounting and sample shipping. Despite support from Agre and other scientists, Butler was convicted in a jury trial, lost his medical license, and served 2 years in prison. Occurring at a time of large national fear following the 9/11 attacks, the incident has been seen by some as an overreaction by the FBI due to public fear of bioterrorism.

===2008 Minnesota U.S. Senate race===
In the spring of 2007, Agre announced that he would explore the US Senate race in his home state of Minnesota being contested by two residents originally from New York – incumbent Sen. Norm Coleman and challenger comedian Al Franken. Agre emphasized health care and environmental issues rather than the Iraq war. He said, &quot;The issues that were important to us at the millennium are still important today.&quot; He also felt that the US Senate would benefit from the perspective of a medical scientist.

Despite polls indicating that he could win, Agre announced in August 2007 that he would not enter the race for the Minnesota Senate seat, calculating the huge personal cost and the termination of his federally funded scientific research program and humanitarian service. An advocate for increased representation of science in government, he would not rule out the possibility of seeking public office in the future.

Although Barack Obama carried Minnesota by a landslide, the senate election was a statistical tie resulting in a recount and six months of legal fights before the Minnesota Supreme Court awarded Al Franken the victory by only 312 votes out of 2.9 million ballots cast. The outcome was important as Franken was sworn in as Senator in July 2009 and provided the 60th vote necessary to end debate on the Affordable Care Act.

===Other activism===
In addition to being a founding member of Scientists and Engineers for Change, Agre was one of 48 Nobel laureates who signed a letter endorsing Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry for president.

Agre criticized many policies of the Bush administration. &quot;The Bush administration has been a disaster for the environment. They&#x27;re playing Russian roulette by not signing the Kyoto Accord. If we wait until there&#x27;s unequivocal proof that this is the cause of global climate change, it will be too late,&quot; he said.

He has said that he admired Linus Pauling, another Nobel laureate and peace activist.

Agre served on the transition team for Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign, helping forge science policy and answers to scientific policy questions posed by Science Debate 2008.

In 2015, Agre signed the &quot;Mainau Declaration 2015 on Climate Change&quot; on the final day of the 65th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting. The declaration was signed by a total of 76 Nobel Laureates and handed to then-President of the French Republic, François Hollande, as part of the successful COP21 climate summit in Paris.

<text>Red Electoral Alliance (, , RV) was an alliance of far-left groups formed into a Norwegian political party to promote revolutionary socialism ideals into the Norwegian parliament. The party dissolved itself on 10 March 2007, when it participated in the founding of a new party, Red (Rødt).

Raud Ungdom or Rød Ungdom (Red Youth) was their youth organization.

==History==

While it was formed in 1973 as an election front for the Worker&#x27;s Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) (), the Red Electoral Alliance became an independent party in 1991, and after that, it scrapped many Leninist ideas. It remained a revolutionary party that, promoting an ideology based upon Marxism.

From 1993 to 1997, Erling Folkvord represented RV in Stortinget, the Norwegian parliament. In 1997, the party got their highest recorded percentage of votes, with 1.7%. In spite of this, Folkvord lost his seat and no new seats were won.

Torstein Dahle, an economist at Bergen University College, was elected leader in 2003 and re-elected in March 2005. Following the 2005 election it was clear that their work to regain their place in the parliament had failed. They received 1.2% of the national total of votes. It was clear that in order to be represented in parliament, they had to win a large share of votes in Hordaland or Oslo. However their best result was 3.4% in Hordaland.

On 10 March 2007, the party dissolved itself, as it merged with the AKP into a new party, Red, with Dahle as its leader. Due to Norwegian election laws, the name Red Electoral Alliance was kept for the 2007 local elections. The party currently has 57 representatives in town halls nationwide.

<text>The Optical System for Imaging and low Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) is an optical spectrometer at the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) in Spain. It was the first instrument in operation at the GTC. OSIRIS&#x27;s key scientific project is OTELO.

Sensitive in the wavelength range from 365 through 1000 nm, OSIRIS is a multiple purpose instrument for imaging and low-resolution long slit and multiple object spectroscopy (MOS). Imaging can be done using broad-band filters or narrow-band tunable filters with FWHM ranging from 0.2 to 0.9 nm at 365 nm, through 0.9 to 1.2 at 1000 nm. OSIRIS observing modes include also fast photometry and spectroscopy. OSIRIS&#x27;s field of view is of 8.5×8.5 arcminutes and the maximum nominal spectral resolution is of 5000 for a slit width of 0.6 arcsec. MOS incorporates detector charge shuffling co-ordinated with telescope nodding for an excellent sky subtraction. The use of tunable filters is a completely new feature in 8 to 10 m class telescopes that will allow observing the very faint and distant emission line objects.

<text>Tai Po Market (; : ) is an MTR station on the in the New Territories, Hong Kong. Located between Flagstaff Hill and Wan Tau Tong Estate in Tai Po, and adjacent to the eponymous market town, the station has three tracks and four platforms. Platform 1 is for northbound trains to border crossing stations at Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau and platform 4 is for southbound trains to Admiralty, Kowloon while platforms 2 and 3 use the same track and is reserved for peak hour traffic.

==History==

Between 1913 and 1982, the old Tai Po Market station located within the Tai Po Market proper served the passengers of Tai Po. The old station is a 10-minute walk from the current one. During the electrification of the Kowloon–Canton Railway (British Section) (now known as the East Rail line), the station was relocated to the current location on 7 April 1983, while the old station building became a part of the Hong Kong Railway Museum. On 2 May the same year, the KCR was electrified to Tai Po Market; full line was electrified on 15 July 1983.

The station went under a major renovation which was completed in 2008. During the renovation, it remained open though most of the retail outlets were closed.

== Station layout ==

The station consists of two island platforms, with platforms 2 and 3 sharing the same centre track. This centre track serves as the terminus of some trains during the day, and the departure of some extra trains southbound during morning peak hours. Northbound trains that arrive here after 11 p.m. use the centre track instead, as Platform 1 is reserved for late night trains that terminate at Tai Po Market instead of continuing towards Lo Wu or Lok Ma Chau.

=== Transport interchange ===
Bus and public light bus services are available for the few housing estates of Tai Po; bus services include MTR Bus (formerly KCR Feeder Bus) and Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) services. Several routes of MTR Bus, such as route K14, which connects private housing estate , and the station, were introduced in 1980s. The bus terminus of the station also had routes that connected to other new towns of Hong Kong, such as KMB&#x27;s route 64K that connects Tai Po and Yuen Long.

<doc id="1044033" wikidata="Q4421073" url="?curid=1044033" title="Civic, Australian Capital Territory">
<text>Civic is the city centre or central business district of Canberra. &quot;Civic&quot; is a common name for the district, but it is also called Civic Centre, City Centre, Canberra City and Canberra, and its official division name is City.

Canberra&#x27;s City was established in 1927, although the division name City was not gazetted until 20 September 1928. Walter Burley Griffin&#x27;s design for Canberra included a &quot;Civic Centre&quot; with a separate &quot;Market Centre&quot; located at what is now Russell. However then Prime Minister Stanley Bruce vetoed this idea and only the Civic Centre was developed; the idea of the Market Centre was abandoned.

==Overview==

Some of the earliest buildings constructed in Canberra were the Sydney and Melbourne buildings which flank Northbourne Avenue. The buildings house many shops, bars and restaurants.

The Canberra Centre, a three-storey shopping complex is Civic&#x27;s main shopping precinct with a retail presence from the national chains David Jones, Myer and Big W department stores, as well as Coles and Aldi supermarkets, a Rebel sports store, several fashion outlets, and some eateries, among other businesses. Nearby is Glebe Park, a picturesque park near the centre of the city with elm trees and oaks from early European settlement before the city was founded. It has a children&#x27;s play park. It is popular with people on their lunch breaks and younger children from the surrounding areas. Civic also is home to the Canberra Theatre, Casino Canberra, Canberra Museum and Gallery and the National Convention Centre.

Garema Place and City Walk are open areas of Civic for pedestrian traffic with many outdoor cafes. One of the longest running cafes in Civic was Gus&#x27;s on Bunda Street.

City Interchange is used by ACTION and CDC Canberra bus services. It is located on East Row, Alinga Street, Mort Street and Northbourne Avenue. A light rail line terminates on Northbourne Avenue north of Alinga Street. On the western side of Northbourne Avenue (north of Alinga Street) is the Jolimont Centre, which is the terminal for Murrays services to Sydney, Wollongong and Batemans Bay and V/Line services to Albury and Bairnsdale.

Canberra City has relatively low height limits on buildings for the centre of a major city: the maximum height of buildings in Civic is 617 metres above sea level, which is derived from the altitude of Parliament House. This height limit is equivalent to approximately 12 storeys for an office building or about 15 storeys for a residential building.

==History==

Before the development of the City of Canberra, there was no clear commercial centre for the area, other than nearby Queanbeyan. Murray&#x27;s store, considered the area&#x27;s first retail store, operated from a house built in 1874 on the of St John the Baptist Church, within the present boundaries of Commonwealth Park, to the east of what is now Nerang Pool. It burnt down in 1923.

Griffin&#x27;s plan separated the national centre, the administrative centre of the city, now the Parliamentary Triangle, from the Civic Centre, the principal commercial area. The commercial centre was planned to be on what Griffin described as the Municipal Axis which was projected to run north-west from Mount Pleasant. Variations from Griffin&#x27;s plan that affect City include the abandonment of a city railway and a reduction in the widths of some streets, including of London Circuit which was planned to be and was reduced to . Griffin&#x27;s civic focus on Vernon Knoll, now known as City Hill, has not materialised mainly because of the way city building has progressed.

The first major buildings planned for the commercial centre were the Melbourne and Sydney Buildings, which were designed in the &quot;Inter-War Mediterranean style&quot;. Construction began in 1926 and they were finally completed in 1946. Immediately after World War II, the Melbourne and Sydney buildings still comprised the main part of Civic and the Blue Moon Cafe was the only place to go for a meal apart from the Hotel Canberra and the Hotel Civic.

Up until the 1960s, Canberra shoppers found the retail environment frustrating. Many did their weekly shopping in Queanbeyan, where the central business district was more compact. Major purchases were made in Sydney. In 1963, the Monaro Mall (now Canberra Centre) opened. It included a branch of the David Jones department store.

==Notable buildings and urban spaces==
===Sydney and Melbourne Buildings===

The Melbourne and Sydney buildings were based on design principles set by John Sulman in sketch form. The design work was finalised by John Hunter Kirkpatrick. The buildings were the model which establish the colonnade principle, an important design element throughout Civic. From 1921 to 1924 Sulman was chairman of the Federal Capital Advisory Committee, and in that role was involved in the planning of Canberra and refining Griffin&#x27;s plan.

Sulman&#x27;s concept of arcaded loggias was derived from Brunelleschi&#x27;s (Foundling Hospital) and the cloisters of the 15th century Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze. The Mediterranean influence was maintained by Kirkpatrick with Roman roof tiles and cast embellishments such as roundels. The buildings were originally constructed with open first floor verandahs which have since largely been glazed in.

The Melbourne Building was sold sequentially as independent parcels from 1927 until 1946. The corner of West Row and London Circuit was built specifically for the Bank of New South Wales. The manager lived above the bank. Much of the Melbourne Building facing West Row was completed by the Commonwealth Government in 1946 and used as the location of the Commonwealth Employment Service. From 1944 to 1953, the Canberra University College was housed in the Melbourne building. On 11 April 1953 the Melbourne Building was severely damaged by fire, and the college relocated (it eventually became the Australian National University).

In 2002 a fire extensively damaged Mooseheads bar, resulting in a partial roof collapse. On 17 February 2014, the Sydney Building was significantly damaged by a fire which began with an explosion in a ground floor Japanese restaurant adjacent to East Row around 9.45 am. The fire was quickly brought under control, but was not extinguished until 2 am, more than 14 hours later. During the blaze, a section of the heritage listed building&#x27;s roof collapsed. The fire saw the evacuation of 40 businesses as well as closures of several roads and the City Bus Station, causing bus route diversions and major disruption to ACTION public transport services.

===Hotel Civic===

The Hotel Civic opened in 1935. It was constructed in an Art Deco style from Canberra Cream bricks. It was demolished in late 1984 through early 1985. The hotel was on the corner of Alinga Street and the eastern side of Northbourne Avenue.

In 1965, the Hotel Civic was the scene of a protest about the segregation of women in the hotel:... a protest where a number of us [including the interviewee Helen Jarvis] chained ourselves to the bar in the Hotel Civic. Women weren&#x27;t allowed to be served in the public bar -- that was the law in both NSW and the ACT. We had to use the saloon bar or the ladies&#x27; bar, where prices were higher, or to huddle out the back around the old kegs. They were also morose places, at least at the Civic, which was the only pub near the university. The public bar had all the spirit. We chained ourselves to the public bar. The bartender wouldn&#x27;t serve us, but there were some sympathetic men who bought drinks for us. The newspapers trivialized it, of course: they wrote it up with the headline, &quot;Women breast the bar&quot;.

===Civic Square===

Civic Square houses the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly, Canberra Museum and Gallery, Civic Library and Canberra Theatre as well as many local cultural organizations, including the Canberra division of the National Trust of Australia.

Civic Square was designed by Yuncken Freeman architects and completed in 1961. Civic Square is sited within a primary axis of Griffin&#x27;s design for Canberra which links City Hill and Mount Ainslie. Griffin intended that the square be the &#x27;heart of the city&#x27;. Civic Square was listed on the register of the former National Estate.

The Canberra Theatre was opened in June 1965 with the Australian Ballet&#x27;s production of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;. The old Playhouse, also from 1965, was demolished and rebuilt in 1998. The link between the Theatre and Playhouse buildings has been redeveloped to include the Civic Library and the theatre&#x27;s bar and administration area.

A sculpture of &quot;Ethos&quot; by Tom Bass was commissioned by the National Capital Development Commission in 1959 and unveiled in 1961. &quot;The NCDC intended that the work would emphasize that Canberra is the non-political centre, the locale of commerce and of private enterprise in its best sense.&quot; The sculpture was designed to represent the spirit of the community. Bass interpreted this in the figure which he intended &quot;the love which Canberra people have for their city to be identified with her...I want them to be conscious of her first as an image from a distance...then comes the moment when they become personally involved with her... they feel her looking at them, reflecting their love for the place&quot;.

According to the draft heritage listing, &quot;The form of the work is highly symbolic. The figure is robed in a fabric richly embossed with emblems and figures representing the Community. The shallow saucer on which the figure stands represents Canberra&#x27;s nick-name &quot;Frosty Hollow&quot;. The saucer is 6 sided because the plan for Civic square is itself hexagonal. The surface of the saucer bears a relief map of Canberra and the rolling countryside around it. At the feet of Ethos are indentations that represent the lake that was later to fill the space between the Civic Centre and the administrative part of the city. The bursting sun she holds aloft is symbolic of culture and enlightenment which the presence of Canberra&#x27;s University, its research organisations and the Diplomatic Corps and so on give to the city&quot;. Bass regarded the work as his most important civic work. During the 1960s and 70s, pictures of the sculpture were frequently used in Canberra tourism images.

===Canberra Olympic Pool===
Construction for a new public pool started in October 1953 and the Canberra Olympic Pool was opened on 22 December 1955, right at the peak of national interest in competitive and recreational swimming leading up to the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne. The new pool complex included three pools; a blue-tiled seven lane pool; a 60 by 90 foot diving pool with a cantilevered reinforced concrete diving tower complete with 3m, 5m and 10m diving platforms, and six springboards; and a children&#x27;s pool. Other facilities included a refreshment kiosk, dressing sheds, private change booths and 800 lockers. The pool complex, gardens and overall design were described &quot;A feature of the new centre is its spaciousness. Garden plots and lawns covered with gay beach umbrellas surround the pools and a strikingly modern colour scheme, with deep blue predominating, on all exterior walls make an attractive setting&quot;. The pool was designed in 1953 by Ian Slater, architect from the Commonwealth Department of Works, and was awarded a Sulman Medal by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects. 

===Canberra Centre===
Civic&#x27;s major shopping mall is the Canberra Centre. Opened as the Monaro Mall in 1963, it was the first Australian three-storey, fully enclosed and air conditioned shopping centre. It was opened by the Prime Minister Robert Menzies. In 1989 it was substantially redeveloped and renamed the Canberra Centre. A further redevelopment was completed by late 2007, substantially adding to the diversity of retailers and services within it including a Dendy Cinema complex.

=== Heritage listings ===
Civic has a number of heritage-listed buildings including:
* 20-22 London Circuit: Reserve Bank of Australia Building

==Crime==
Canberra City is Canberra&#x27;s largest nightclub district and experiences high levels of alcohol-related violence. More than 600 assaults occurred in the city between December 2010 and December 2013, four times more than the next worst suburb in Canberra of Belconnen.

==Demographics==

At the , the population of Canberra City was 4,835, including 50 (1.0%) Indigenous persons and 2,155 (44.6%) Australian-born persons. 99.6% of dwellings were flats, units or apartments (Australian average: 14.2%), while none were semi-detached, row or terrace houses (Australian average: 12.6%) or separate houses (compared to the Australian average of 72.3%).

In 2021, 41.3% of the population were professionals, compared to the Australian average of 24.0%. Notably 16.4% worked in central government administration, compared to the Australian average of 1.1%, although the ACT-wide average is a similar 17.1%. 55.0% of the population had no religion (compared to the ACT average of 43.5% and the Australian average of 38.4%), while 13.2% did not state their religion, 9.7% were Catholic, 3.9% Anglican and 3.6% Buddhist. 16.2% of the population was born in China, 3.5% in India, 2.3% in England, 1.7% in Malaysia and 1.7% in South Korea. 50.8% of people spoke only English at home.

<text>OTELO (OSIRIS Tunable Emission Line Object survey) is an emission line object survey using OSIRIS tunable filters in selected atmospheric windows relatively free of sky emission lines.

==Overview==
The total survey sky area is of 1 square degree (0.30 msr) distributed in different high latitude and low extinction fields with enough angular separations. A 5 sigma depth of 8×10−18 (erg/cm2)/s (8 zW/m2 or 9×10−24 hp/yd2) allows detecting objects of equivalent widths down to 6. OTELO will observe objects with an age equivalent to 10% of the age of the Universe. Given the observing procedure, OTELO will allow studying a clearly defined volume of the Universe at a known flux limit. OTELO will complement spectroscopic surveys, since the selection criteria are completely different: not broad band based but emission line based, which will allow detecting faint continuum objects.

The scientific field that OTELO will allow tackling is very wide, and encompasses evolutionary studies of Ly alpha emitters, QSO, AGN, star-forming populations (specifically the faint end luminosity), Emissión line ellipticals (detectable depending upon its evolution), chemical evolution of the Universe between &quot;z&quot;=0.24 and &quot;z&quot;=1.5, mass/luminosity relation vs. morphological type and redshift (up to &quot;z&quot;=1.5), Tully-Fisher relation up to &quot;z&quot;=1.5 and derivation of cosmological parameters. Other studies include galactic structure and Galactic objects (PN, peculiar stars, cataclysmic variables).

<text>Festival Republic is a UK music promoter. It was founded as Mean Fiddler Group in 1982 by Irish-born chairman John Vincent Power, as a venue-management and music-promotion group. After the group was taken over by Hamsard Ltd in 2005, the focus became more concentrated on festivals, and in 2007 the venues along with the Mean Fiddler name were sold on, with the remaining company being renamed Festival Republic. Melvin Benn is the current managing director.

==History==

The group was founded in 1982 by Irish-born chairman John Vincent Power, with a venue called simply Mean Fiddler. At the end of the 1980s they took control of the Reading Festival from Harold Pendleton, beginning a move into festivals. After acquiring the LA2 in Charing Cross Road in 2000, they were renamed to become the Mean Fiddler Music Group.

In April 2005, they accepted a takeover bid from Hamsard Ltd, a co-operative company 50.1% owned by Live Nation UK (formerly the entertainment division of Clear Channel UK but now part of Live Nation International) and 49.9% owned by Irish event organiser MCD.

In 2006, the Mean Fiddler Music Group reduced its touring and promotion activities to concentrate on running festivals. It maintained control of the Reading and Leeds festivals and announced a new addition, Latitude Festival.

In 2007, the Mean Fiddler Music Group was sold along with several venues to Mama Group Plc in order to allow Festival Republic to concentrate fully on promoting festivals. As part of the sale, Mama Group acquired the rights to the Mean Fiddler trademark.

==Festival promotion and production==

Festival Republic&#x27;s flagship events are the Reading and Leeds Festivals. These are a pair of annual events which take place simultaneously on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday of the August bank holiday weekend, sharing the same bill. In addition they also run the Latitude Festival in Suffolk, the Wireless Festival and the Community Festival in London, EDC UK in Milton Keynes, and the Download Festival in Leicestershire. They also produce a BBC Proms In The Park and BBC Radio 2 Live In Hyde Park, which both take place on the same weekend in September in London&#x27;s Hyde Park.

In Ireland, they organise the Longitude Festival and Electric Picnic. In Norway, they run the Hove Festival. In Germany they have expanded from running the Berlin Festival to running the first European Lollapalooza.

They have previously been responsible for Big Chill festival, which last ran in 2011, and were the operators of the Glastonbury Festival from 2002 until 2012.

== Former festivals ==

* Big Chill Festival (2010–2011)
* Eroica (2018 formerly V Festival South)
* V Festivals (2017) 
* T in the Park (2016)

<text>Bodenständig 2000 is an electronic music group from Germany, founded in 1995 by Dragan Espenschied and Bernhard Kirsch. They are the self-proclaimed pioneers of the home computer folk music movement.

In 1999, they released their debut album &quot;Maxi German Rave Blast Hits 3&quot; on Rephlex Records, London.
It contains mixture of chiptunes, rave, eurodance, some &quot;serious electronica&quot; plus German vocals and was completely produced at home with non-professional equipment and selfmade software.

Up until 2002, some minor releases took place, like remixes, compilation tracks or home computer diskettes. In June 2003 the EP &quot;Hart rockende Wissenschaftler&quot; was released on Feed The Machine records, Detroit, containing hardcore chiptune dance tracks on one side and folky harmony singing on the other.

By invitation of the US subsidiary of the German Goethe-Institut, Bodenständig 2000 was able to perform the first concert of the Version&gt;3-Festivals in Chicago in 2003.

The song &#x27;In Rock 8-Bit&#x27; is featured in the Annoying Thing animation by TurboForce3d starring Crazy Frog.

The musicians achieved worldwide coverage in July 2006 due to their opting out of the music portal iTunes, which they attributed to fundamental disagreement with the restrictive digital rights management model. Gaining massive momentum in the blogosphere the story finally made its way into the International Herald Tribune. Being accused of trying to pull off a publicity stunt, the band decided to make the tracks in question available for free download.

<text>Richard Thomas Church CBE (26 March 1893 – 4 March 1972) was an English writer, poet and critic; he also wrote novels and verse plays, and three volumes of autobiography.

==Early life==
Church was born on 26 March 1893 in Battersea, in south London. He went to Dulwich Hamlet School in Dulwich. The second son of Thomas John Church and Lavina Annie Orton Church. His mother was distantly related to the novelist George Eliot but kept quiet about this because of her bohemian lifestyle. His father was a sorter for the General Post Office and his mother was a schoolteacher who suffered ill-health and died in 1910 when he was only seventeen. After leaving school at sixteen, he started work as a clerk in the Customs and Excise branch of the Civil Service. In his first volume of autobiography he recounts the physicality of his father, the intelligence of his mother, his resourceful older brother, privations, and the difficult relationship of his ill-matched parents.

His first book of poems, &quot;The Flood of Life&quot;, was published in 1917 when he was 24, but he remained in the Civil Service until 1933, when he left to write full-time at the age of 40.

==Career==
Church became a respected journalist and reviewer, and wrote extensively on country matters. His first poetry appeared in Robert Blatchford&#x27;s &quot;Clarion&quot;, and he contributed verse to periodicals for the rest of his life.

His first post as a literary editor was with the &quot;New Leader&quot;, organ of the Independent Labour Party. He was director of the Oxford Festival of Spoken Poetry during the 1930s. His much-anthologised World War I poem &quot;Mud&quot; first appeared in &quot;Life and Letters&quot;, January 1935. He worked as Editor for the publisher J.M. Dent between 1933 and 1951.

The first volume of Church&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Over the Bridge&quot; (1955), was awarded the Sunday Times Prize for Literature while the novelist Howard Spring described it as &quot;the loveliest autobiography written in our time,&quot; pointing out that the writer had &quot;found life full of enchantment, and how not the least of its enchantments was its challenge.&quot; The second volume, &quot;The Golden Sovereign&quot;, appeared in 1957. That year Church was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II.

==Mystical experience==
While young, Church had a mystical experience at a convalescent home, which he recounted in his autobiography, &quot;Over the Bridge&quot;, and which was also recounted by the British occultist writer Colin Wilson. Looking out of some French windows, Church saw a gardener chopping down a dead tree. What struck Church after a while was that the sight of the axe hitting the tree and the sound of the axe hitting the tree were not synchronised. The sound was delayed. At first, he did not believe his own powers of perception, but after concentrating on his vision and hearing, he came to the conclusion that he was experiencing an error in the laws of physics. He came to the conclusion – which would remain with him for the rest of his life – that &quot;time and space are not absolute. Their power was &quot;not&quot; law.&quot; He experienced incredible freedom in this epiphany. &quot;(...) I was free. Since time and space were deceivers, openly contradicting each other, and at best offering a compromise in place of law&quot; 
After this epiphany another soon followed. From where he stood he sensed that &quot;(...) my limbs and trunk were lighter than they seemed, and that I had only to reduce them by an act of will, perhaps by a mere change of physical mechanics, to command them off the ground, out of the tyranny of gravitation&quot;. He then left the ground and glided &quot;about the room&quot; some twelve or eighteen inches above the floor. He returned to the ground only to take off once more.

==Personal life==
Church married three times: firstly to Caroline Parfett in 1915, with whom he had three daughters, this marriage ending in divorce. He married his second wife, Catherina Schimmer on 19 November 1930, and the couple had a son before her death in 1965. He married his third wife, Dorothy Beale, a widow, on 25 February 1967.

He had a great love for the Kent countryside and this is reflected in much of his writing. He published an anthology of works on Kent.

==Death==
He and Dorothy initially lived at The Old Stable, they subsequently moved to The Priest&#x27;s House at Sissinghurst Castle in Cranbrook where he died suddenly, aged 78, on 4 March 1972.

<text>Toona, commonly known as red cedar, toon (also spelled tun) or toona, tooni (in Nepal and India) is a genus in the mahogany family, Meliaceae, native from Afghanistan south to India, and east to North Korea, Papua New Guinea and eastern Australia. In older texts, the genus was often incorporated within a wider circumscription of the related genus &quot;Cedrela&quot;, but that genus is now restricted to species from the Americas.

==Uses==
===Ornamental use===
&quot;Toona sinensis&quot; is of interest as by far the most cold-tolerant species in the Meliaceae, native in China as far north as 40°N in the Beijing area, where its tender shoots, called &quot;xiangchun&quot; (), are a traditional local leaf vegetable. It is the only member of the family that can be cultivated successfully in northern Europe, where it is sometimes planted as an ornamental tree in parks and avenues. Until recently, it had no widespread English common name, though Chinese Mahogany (reflecting its botanical relationship) is now used (e.g. Rushforth 1999).

===Wood source===
&quot;Toona ciliata&quot; is an important timber tree. It provides a valuable hardwood used for furniture, ornamental panelling, shipbuilding, and musical instruments like the sitar, rudra veena, and drums. Due to the restrictions in recent years on the use of natively-grown American mahogany, it has become one of the common mahogany replacements in electric guitar manufacturing.

===Medicinal and culinary uses===
&quot;Toona sinensis&quot; is used in Chinese traditional medicine and eaten as a vegetable or sauce in China (leaves and shoots).

==Species==

, six species are recognised by Plants of the World Online, as follows:
*&quot;Toona calantas&quot; - Malesia, New Guinea, Bismarck Archipelago.
*&quot;Toona calcicola&quot; - Thailand.
*&quot;Toona ciliata&quot; - Pakistan to southern China, SE Asia and Australia.
*&quot;Toona fargesii&quot; - Eastern Himalayas to southern China.
*&quot;Toona sinensis&quot; - Pakistan to China and Malesia.
*&quot;Toona sureni&quot; - Southern China, Malesia and Papuasia.

<text>Wei Wei (; March 6, 1920 – August 24, 2008), originally known as Hong Jie (), was a Chinese poet, a prose writer, a literary report writer, a journalist, a vice-editor-in-chief and the editor of various newspapers in China. His works are noted for their themes of patriotism, communism, and nationalism. Apart from using the name &quot;Wei Wei&quot;, he once used the pen name &quot;Hong Yangshu&quot; () in some of his publications. He changed his name from &quot;Hong Jie&quot; to &quot;Wei Wei&quot; in 1937 when he had started a new page of his life, a political one.

== Biography ==
&quot;Wei Wei&quot; was born into a poor family in Zhengzhou, Henan, and received a rudimentary primary education. He showed early interest in calligraphy and literature, but was unable to receive much education after elementary school, when both of his parents died. He was largely self-taught and was greatly influenced by the radical Chinese literature of the 1920s and 30s, including works by authors like Lu Xun and Mao Dun.

Wei Wei joined the Eighth Route Army at the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and was educated to be a propagandist and journalist. After joining the Chinese Communist Party in 1938, he rose quickly through party ranks. He became known for reporting from the front lines, which continued throughout the Korean War and the Vietnam War. He also became known for composing a series of Communist-themed novels, short stories, and operas.

Wei died on August 24, 2008, in Beijing.

<doc id="1044089" wikidata="Q140561" url="?curid=1044089" title="Zahedan">
<text>Zahedan (Balochi and ; ) is a city in the Central District of Zahedan County, Sistan and Baluchestan province, Iran, serving as capital of the province, the county, and the district. It is near the borderlands between Iran and Pakistan where Baloch people live.

==Etymology==
The original name of the city was Duzzap (Persian: &quot;Duzdab&quot;, meaning &quot;Water Stolen&quot;), which it had received due to the abrupt floods into the valley. The name was later changed to Zahedan (Persian for &quot;hermits&quot;) during Reza Shah&#x27;s visit in 1929.

== History ==
Mention of Zahedan first appears in sources in August 1849. However, the city first truly started to grow during the early 20th-century. During World War I it became the westernmost terminal of the Zahedan railway station, which reached as far as Quetta in the northern part of what was then British Baluchistan.

The city was the site of a deadly crackdown in October 2022, with dozens citizens killed by pro-governmental forces. Over 90 people were killed. Two senior police officials were fired in the aftermath of the crackdown. On 28 October, there were protests in Zahedan and security forces fired on protestors, killing 98 and injuring 14.

On 3 November 2022, the Shi&#x27;i cleric and Khamenei loyalist Sajjad Shahraki was assassinated in Zahedan. The next day, there were widespread protests in the city; Revolutionary Guards and other armed forces fired on protestors.

==Demographics==
===Population===
While the surrounding area boasts numerous ancient sites, Zahedan itself primarily developed in the 20th century. It transitioned from a small village to the provincial administrative center in the 1930s. Its population reached 17,500 by 1956, and increased more than fivefold to 93,000 by 1976. After 1980, large numbers of refugees fleeing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan helped triple the population of Zahedan to more than 281,000 by 1986, a number which has since doubled again.

At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 552,706 in 109,488 households. The following census in 2011 counted 560,725 people in 134,088 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 587,730 people in 146,717 households.

==Geography==

===Location===
Zahedan is connected by rail to nearby Pakistan and is near to Afghanistan. It is about south of the tripoint of the three countries and at an altitude of above sea level and from the Iranian capital of Tehran.
===Climate===
Zahedan has a hot desert climate (Köppen: &quot;BWh&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;BW&quot;). Precipitation is very low, and mostly falls in winter.

Zahedan experiences very hot summers, there are 84.7 days per year with maximum temperature above , of which 7 days have a daily maximum above . Winters are quite cold with minimum temperatures below for 43.7 days annually. Zahedan also experiences 81.3 days a year with haze.

==Economy==

Zahedan is the main economic center of the region and home to many small- and medium-scale industries. Its main products include cotton textiles, woven and hand-knotted rugs, ceramics, processed foods, livestock feed, processed hides, milled rice, brick, reed mats and baskets.

== Transport ==

Zahedan is served by Zahedan International Airport.

Highway 95 links Zahedan to Tehran and Mashhad in the north and the port of Bandar Chabahar on the Sea of Oman in the south, and Highway 84 to the Pakistani city of Quetta in the east and to Kerman in the west.

For decades the broad gauge (Indian subcontinent system) railway exists from Zahedan station to/from Quetta&#x27;s station in Pakistan, the Quetta–Taftan Railway Line. Beyond this, west, a standard gauge line was completed from Zahedan to Kerman linking the city with the rest of the Iranian rail network. This flowed from a 18 May 2007 MOU for rail co-operation (of Pakistan and Iran) under which the line was to be completed by December 2008. It was completed with an opening ceremony on 19 June 2009. This means that Zahedan hosts the break of gauge between the Islamic Republic of Iran Railway&#x27;s standard gauge tracks of the Trans-Iranian Railway and Pakistan Railway&#x27;s broad gauge aforementioned.

=== Chabahar–Zahedan railway ===

In May 2016, during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s trip to Iran, agreement was signed to develop two terminals and five berths at Port of Chabahar and to build a new railway between Chabahar and Zahedan, as part of North–South Transport Corridor, by Indian Railways&#x27;s public sector unit Ircon International. This proposal is under study and consideration, a via Kerman connection to the port of Chabahar.

In July 2016, India began shipping US$150 million of tracks to Chabahar to build the US$1.6 billion line, for which India pledged additional US$400 million and Iran has also allocated US$125 million in December 2016, thus taking the total allocation to US$575 million (out of US$1.6 billion needed) by the end of 2016.

==Sports==

In April 2008 the 70 billion IRR (about 2.5 million USD) Zahedan Stadium was built with a seating capacity of 15,000 people. It was inaugurated on 18 April 2008 with a friendly football game between &quot;Honarmandan&quot; (Artists) and a local team.

== Education ==
Zahedan is the home of the Islamic Azad University of Zahedan, the Zahedan University of Medical Sciences and the University of Sistan and Baluchestan. Besides, the largest Sunni seminary, Darululoom Zahedan, is located in Zahedan. There are some other religious Sunni schools in the city and the vicinity.

<doc id="1044091" wikidata="Q282855" url="?curid=1044091" title="Parkway Drive">
<text>Parkway Drive are an Australian metalcore band from Byron Bay, New South Wales, formed in 2003. Parkway Drive have released seven studio albums, one EP, two DVDs, a split album and one book, titled &quot;Ten Years of Parkway Drive&quot;. The band&#x27;s latest three albums have reached number 1 of the Australian ARIA Charts – &quot;Ire&quot; (2015), &quot;Reverence&quot; (2018), and &quot;Darker Still&quot; (2022).

The band&#x27;s line-up has been consistent since the addition of bassist Jia O&#x27;Connor in 2006, with Brett Versteeg having left in 2004 and Shaun Cash in 2006.

== History ==
=== Early years and &quot;Killing with a Smile&quot; (2003–2006) ===
Parkway Drive were formed at the beginning of 2003. The band took their name from the street where their home rehearsal space and live venue, &#x27;The Parkway House&#x27;, was located. The 2009 documentary &quot;Parkway Drive: The DVD&quot; explains that there was a lack of venues for punk rock and hardcore punk bands to practice and perform and that &#x27;Parkway House&#x27; was like &#x27;a little oasis for us and all our friends&#x27;. The group played their first show at the Byron Bay Youth Centre where I Killed the Prom Queen vocalist Michael Crafter, visiting from Adelaide, also first saw the group and gained their interest. The &quot;I Killed the Prom Queen / Parkway Drive: Split CD&quot; was released June 2003 and both groups toured Australia over the rest of the year. After signing with Resist Records, the band released the &quot;Don&#x27;t Close Your Eyes&quot; EP in 2004 and opened for Shadows Fall, Chimaira, Hatebreed and Alexisonfire on subsequent Australian tours. Winston McCall commented on the EP in early 2005 that he was surprised that &quot;for six songs it&#x27;s done amazing for us...I&#x27;m surprised that kids picked it up so well.&quot; Following Brett Versteeg&#x27;s replacement by Shaun Cash, Parkway Drive flew to the United States where they recorded their debut full-length &quot;Killing with a Smile&quot; with Killswitch Engage guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz in just two weeks. Manager Graham Nixon later noted that &#x27;it was not the &quot;done thing&quot; for an Australian band to head overseas and work with a producer of that sort of calibre&#x27;. The album debuted in the Australian Album (ARIA) charts at 39. In 2006 the group toured in Europe and later returned to North America. In late May 2006, bass player Shaun Cash left the band for personal reasons with full support from the rest of the members. He was replaced by their &quot;merch guy&quot; and long-time friend, Jia &quot;Pie&quot; O&#x27;Connor. Parkway Drive signed to American punk label Epitaph in June 2006.

=== &quot;Horizons&quot; (2007–2009) ===
In July and August 2007, Parkway Drive appeared on that year&#x27;s Warped Tour in the US. On 24 July 2007, &quot;Horizons&quot; was announced for release, and its track listing was revealed. On 20 August, &quot;Boneyards&quot; was posted on the band&#x27;s Myspace profile. &quot;Horizons&quot; was made available for streaming on 1 October, and was released on 6 October through Epitaph. In October, the band toured across Australia, before going on tour in Europe with Comeback Kid, Cancer Bats, the Warriors, and This Is Hell the following month. A music video for &quot;Boneyards&quot; was posted online on 23 November. In December, the band went on a west coast US tour alongside XDeathstarx.

In January and February 2008, the band went on a US tour alongside Killswitch Engage, the Dillinger Escape Plan and Every Time I Die. Following this, the band performed at the Groezrock festival in Belgium, and went on an Australian tour with Have Heart, Antagonist and Break Even. In July and August, the band supported Darkest Hour on the Trash &amp; Burn tour. During the tour, the band performed at Robot Mosh Fest. In April and May 2009, the band went on a tour of the US with Stick to Your Guns and MyChildren MyBride. The band appeared at The Bamboozle festival in early May.

=== &quot;Deep Blue&quot; (2010–2011) ===
On 23 March 2010, Parkway Drive entered the studio to begin recording their third album, &quot;Deep Blue&quot;, with producer Joe Barresi. According to their lead vocalist Winston McCall, this was to be their rawest and heaviest record to date.
According to a blog that posted on Myspace on 1 April, they had finished tracking the drums for the album.
According to a blog posted on 8 April, Parkway Drive were half finished with rhythm guitars, bass and vocals for the upcoming untitled album. On 17 April, Parkway Drive officially announced that they finished recording the forthcoming album, and added a studio diary video to their Myspace.

On 26 April, vocalist Winston McCall revealed in a video-interview two new song-titles: &quot;Home Is for the Heartless&quot; (featuring Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion) and &quot;Hollow&quot; (featuring Marshall Lichtenwaldt of The Warriors). Winston stated in the interview that the European tour they were on was the last tour until the release of the new album, indicating that the album should be out in stores sometime before the Vans Warped Tour began. In September, the group was nominated for an ARIA Award for &quot;Deep Blue&quot; in the newly created Best Hard Rock or Heavy Metal Album category and eventually won. It was the first ARIA Award in the band&#x27;s history.

Parkway Drive received the Australian Independent Record (AIR) Award for &#x27;Best Independent Hard Rock or Punk Album&#x27; in 2010 for &quot;Deep Blue&quot;. In 2011, Winston McCall was featured in The Warriors&#x27; song &quot;Panic&quot;, from their album &quot;See How You Are&quot;. That same year, he was featured in You Me at Six&#x27;s song &quot;Time Is Money&quot; from their album &quot;Sinners Never Sleep&quot;. It was announced in early 2011 that Parkway Drive would perform at the Sonisphere Festival in Imola, Italy on 25 June and in Knebworth, UK on 10 July.

=== &quot;Atlas&quot; (2012–2013) ===
In an interview with NME, Winston spoke briefly about an upcoming fourth studio album. Winston is quoted as saying, &quot;We&#x27;ve got ideas for this record that are bigger than anything we&#x27;ve done in the past. We&#x27;re trying to pencil it in, but we want to get in the studio sooner rather than later.&quot; The vocalist also gave an update on the condition of the band&#x27;s guitarist Luke &#x27;Pig&#x27; Kilpatrick. The guitarist has been forced to play with the band from a wheelchair after a surfing accident, but McCall said he was improving and would be up on his feet for the band&#x27;s next tour. He said: &quot;I think he&#x27;ll be in a cast for a couple more weeks. His leg had swelled up to the size of a football, but it&#x27;s come down now. He still can&#x27;t walk on it yet. It&#x27;s made for an interesting couple of tours and it&#x27;ll be weird when he is walking around again.&quot;

On 10 April 2012, Parkway Drive released a trailer for their new Blu-ray/DVD entitled &quot;Home Is for the Heartless&quot; with a set release date for 6 July 2012. In an interview with Reviewed Music, Winston McCall stated that &quot;Parkway Drive will be entering the studio following their April European/UK tour to begin recording their upcoming fourth album.&quot; Parkway Drive announced via Instagram that they will officially begin recording their new album on 20 June in Los Angeles. On 9 September, Parkway Drive released the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Dark Days&quot; along with a music video. On 17 September, Parkway Drive released a 10-second teaser of &quot;Old Ghost / New Regrets&quot; in an interview with Winston McCall on the ABC radio program, &quot;The Doctor&quot;.

On 23 October, the full album became available to stream on the Epitaph Records YouTube channel. The album &quot;Atlas&quot; was released on 26 October 2012 through Epitaph Records. The band first started touring in support of the album in Europe between 13 November 2012 and 1 December 2012 with opening bands Emmure, The Word Alive and Structures. On 13 December, they embarked on their second album release tour, to New Zealand and Australia. The band performed as part of Warped Tour Australia in November and December 2013.

=== &quot;Ire&quot; (2014–2016) ===
In February 2014, Parkway Drive announced they would be participating in the 2014 Warped Tour on the main stage. On 11 April 2014, they announced on their Instagram that they were working on a new album. On 4 June 2015, Parkway Drive teased a letter for their upcoming fifth studio album; later the same day, the album cover was leaked online in its entirety. The album was called &quot;Ire&quot;, and a new single entitled &quot;Vice Grip&quot; with a music video was released to the public on 8 June 2015. The release date of &quot;Ire&quot; was 25 September. On 20 June, &quot;Vice Grip&quot; peaked at number 88 on the Australian singles chart, making it the band&#x27;s second charting single after &quot;Dark Days&quot;, which peaked at number 71 in September 2012. &quot;Crushed&quot; from &quot;Ire&quot; later reached number 96 on 29 August. On 11 July 2016, the band released a new single &quot;Devil&#x27;s Calling&quot; for the deluxe edition of &quot;Ire&quot;.

=== &quot;Reverence&quot; and &quot;Viva the Underdogs&quot; (2017–2021) ===
In May 2017, the band announced that they were working on a new album. Vocalist Winston McCall said the album would be &quot;more aggressive&quot; than its predecessor &quot;Ire&quot;. The album had been expected to be released sometime in 2018. On 27 February 2018, the band released &quot;Wishing Wells&quot;, which is the first single from their forthcoming sixth album, whose name not been yet announced. On 13 March, the band announced that their sixth studio album entitled &quot;Reverence&quot; would be released on 4 May 2018. The second single entitled &quot;The Void&quot; was released alongside this announcement.

The third single entitled &quot;Prey&quot; was released on 24 April. Following the release of &quot;Reverence&quot;, the band announced the North American tour with August Burns Red and The Devil Wears Prada beginning on 30 August from San Diego, California and ending on 23 September in Hollywood. &quot;Reverence&quot; won the 2018 ARIA Award for Best Hard Rock or Heavy Metal Album, obtaining the band their second win in the category.

On 6 November 2019, the band announced their new documentary movie &quot;Viva the Underdogs&quot; would be screened for one night only across the world on 22 January 2020, detailing their 15-year rise to fame from the Byron Bay hardcore days in 2003, through to their UK Festival headline performances in 2019.

The band announced &quot;Viva the Underdogs&quot; worldwide tour to celebrate the release of &quot;Viva the Underdogs&quot;. The European portion of the tour was announced on 27 November 2019 with Venom Prison, Stick to Your Guns and Hatebreed as supporters. The Australian portion was announced on 9 December 2019 with Every Time I Die and Hatebreed as supporters. The North America portion was announced on 18 February 2020 with include Hatebreed, Knocked Loose and Fit for a King as supporters, and the tour would be the first time that Parkway Drive will be using their pyrotechnics in North America. All three portions of the tour have been postponed to different dates in 2021 and 2022 due to COVID-19 pandemic.

On 23 January 2020, the band announced the &quot;Viva the Underdogs&quot; soundtrack, which features live recordings from their Wacken Open Air 2019 headline performance and three rerecorded songs with frontman Winston McCall singing in German. In December 2020, Parkway Drive were listed at number 32 in &quot;Rolling Stone Australia&quot;″s &quot;50 Greatest Australian Artists of All Time&quot; issue.

=== &quot;Darker Still&quot; (2022–present) ===
On 11 January 2022, the band announced a North American tour in May and June, supported by Hatebreed, The Black Dahlia Murder, and Stick to Your Guns. However, on 6 April, they announced the cancellation of the tour, stating that &quot;the relentless nature of being in this band has given us very little time to reflect on who we are as individuals, who we want to be and the toll it is taking on ourselves and our friendships.&quot; On 23 May, it was announced that for their mental health, Parkway Drive would be taking a break from activity, but clarified that they &quot;are here to stay&quot;.

On 7 June, following a series of teasers released on various social media, the band unveiled a brand new single entitled &quot;Glitch&quot; along with a music video. On 8 June, the band announced that their Fall 2022 European tour with Lorna Shore and While She Sleeps would continue as scheduled with a rebrand, and new music to accompany said tour. On 6 July, the band released the second single &quot;The Greatest Fear&quot; and its corresponding music video. At the same time, they officially announced that their seventh studio album, &quot;Darker Still&quot;, was set for release on 9 September 2022, whilst also revealing the album cover and the track list. On 22 August, the band published the third single and title track &quot;Darker Still&quot;.

== Musical style and influences ==
Parkway Drive&#x27;s genre was previously almost exclusively described as metalcore. Their earlier albums had deathcore influences, which were especially apparent on &quot;Deep Blue&quot;; more recently, the band switched to a more traditional heavy metal sound. Their sound usually employs screaming vocals and breakdowns. Unlike many other popular modern metalcore bands, Parkway Drive did not use clean singing on any of their studio albums until their 2015 studio album &quot;Ire&quot;, although they did use them on some songs on their first two EPs, on which they were performed by the band&#x27;s original bassist Brett Versteeg. However, following the shift in style during &quot;Reverence&quot;, Winston McCall stated that Parkway Drive have &quot;outgrown metalcore&quot;, and have transitioned away from their earlier roots.

They have cited influences including Rage Against the Machine, Metallica, Slayer, Iron Maiden, Bad Religion, Pennywise, the Offspring, Faith No More, Unearth, the Dillinger Escape Plan, Hatebreed and Killswitch Engage.

<text>The Avon Valley Railway (AVR) is a standard gauge heritage railway in South Gloucestershire, England, operated by a local group, the Avon Valley Railway Company Ltd. The 3-mile (5 km) heritage line runs from Oldland Common to Avon Riverside. It follows the Avon Valley southeast from Oldland Common to Bitton and then it runs alongside the River Avon from Bitton towards Saltford.

The railway shares its route with the Sustrans cycleway and footpath, the Bristol and Bath Railway Path. 

==History==

=== Commercial history ===
The railway is part of the otherwise-dismantled Midland Railway Mangotsfield and Bath branch line, which was closed in 1966 as a result of the Beeching cuts, due mainly to the Great Western Railway, which also connected Bristol and Bath, being just a few miles to the south.

The railway is perhaps best known for connecting the former Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S&amp;DJR), whose northern terminus was at Bath Green Park station, with the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The Midland Railway lines along the Avon Valley thus opened up the S&amp;D lines to travellers from the British industrial Midlands. This was particularly so during summer Saturdays when families flocked south to the beaches of Dorset and the English south coast. Many extra trains thus had to be added to the schedule to accommodate this increased demand. Although owned and run by the Midland Railway, many S&amp;D locomotives were often seen working trains along this line.

After the lines were removed, from 2000 the northern section from Mangotsfield to Warmley was used to build a dual carriage development of the A4174 road, although both station sites currently still exist. The remainder of the line was passed from the British Railways Board to Sustrans, who in co-operation with the local councils developed the Bristol and Bath Railway Path. Further development of the heritage railway is wholly dependent on a usage agreement with Sustrans.

=== Heritage railway ===
The Bristol Suburban Rail Society was formed in 1972 by a group of local people including MP Robert Adley with the aim of restoring commuter and weekend steam use to the Bristol–Mangotsfield–Bath and Mangotsfield–Yate railway routes.

Bitton station and its yard, including some trackbed, was leased from British Railways Board by the Bristol Suburban Railway Society. Work progressed slowly over the years restoring the heavily vandalised buildings and laying track north towards Oldland Common and Warmley. Weekend steam-hauled &#x27;brake van&#x27; train rides progressed to proper passenger services along the ever-lengthening line in restored 1950s British Railways Mark 1 carriages.

In 1979, the Bristol Suburban Railway Society was incorporated into the Bitton Railway Co. Ltd. and the laid track reached Oldland Common in 1988. By 1992, however, the city of Bristol had expanded greatly, with houses encroaching upon the former railway line, and expansion north to Warmley and Mangotsfield was no longer considered practical. The line thus began to expand south out into the valley of the River Avon. By 2004, it had crossed the Avon and a new station was built to service the Avon Valley Country Park — a large picnic and recreation site — along with a river wharf to provide visitors with connections to river barges and river boat trips.

Building of a new buffet and toilet facility at Bitton station began in 2007 to replace the current buffet and toilets and to increase space for the railway&#x27;s gift shop. 2024 marked the 50th anniversary since the first trains ran.

==Preservation==
=== Operations ===
As a tourist attraction, the Avon Valley Railway now handles 80,000 visitors per year. The AVR provides round-trip steam train travel from Bitton Station north to Oldland Common then south to Avon Riverside station. The line is open to travellers on most weekends.

=== Signalling ===
Warmley Signal Box is now used as a community garden on the cycleway with a short section of track that has been used to display locomotives and wagons.

=== Incidents ===
On 24 July 2018, during a shunting operation at Bitton station, two empty coaches ran away for 43 yards (40 metres) on a down gradient until they collided with a level crossing gate closed across the track. The coaches, which had no handbrakes, overrode chocks placed against two wheels. There were no injuries.

== Stations ==

=== Current stations ===

* Oldland Common Halt, although the line was relaid in 1988 the station was not in use until 1991.
* Bitton Railway Station, is the headquarters of the railway. There is a yard, cafe, shop and a goods shed converted in to a workshop where locomotives are maintained and restored.
* Avon Riverside Railway Station, opened in 2004, with access to the riverside picnic area &amp; Riverboat trips. This is a new station and not part of the original infrastructure.

=== Former stations ===

* Mangotsfield Railway Station
* Warmley Railway Station
* Bath Green Park Railway Station

== Extensions to the railway ==

=== Northwards ===
After reopening the station at Oldland Common, focus shifted to extending the line southeast towards Bath.

=== Southwards ===
Work continues to extend the railway south-east towards Bath (potentially as far as Newbridge).

<text>Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk, (13 August 15843 June 1640) was an English nobleman and politician.

==Career==
Born at the family estate of Saffron Walden, he was the son of Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk, by his second wife, Catherine Knyvet of Charlton, and succeeded his father as 2nd Earl of Suffolk and 2nd Baron Howard de Walden in 1626, along with some other of his father&#x27;s offices, including the lord-lieutenancy of the counties of Suffolk, Cambridge and Dorset.

Howard danced in &quot;Lord Hay&#x27;s Masque&quot; to celebrate the marriage of James Hay and Honora Denny on 6 January 1607. On 9 February 1608 he performed in the masque &quot;The Hue and Cry After Cupid&quot; at Whitehall Palace as a sign of the zodiac, to celebrate the wedding of John Ramsay, Viscount Haddington to Elizabeth Radclyffe. During the progress of Anne of Denmark in April 1613, he danced in the masque at Caversham Park. Howard and his &quot;three brethren&quot; danced in &quot;The Somerset Masque&quot; at Whitehall Palace on 26 December 1613.

Sir Theophilus Howard was named in the Second Charter of Virginia made by King James I on 23 May 1609. The members of this extensive list were &quot;incorporated by the name of The Tresorer and Companie of Adventurers and Planters of the Citty of London for the Firste Collonie in Virginia&quot;.

He was elected MP for Maldon in a by-election in 1605 caused by the death of Sir Edward Lewknor and sat until he was ennobled in 1610 as Baron Howard de Walden by a Writ of Acceleration.

He was the dedicatee of Shelton&#x27;s translation of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, the first translation of the work in any language. The translation of the first part of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; was published in London in 1612, while Cervantes was still alive. It is not known why Shelton chose Howard as a dedicatee, although he was possibly a distant relative. He was also the dedicatee of John Dowland&#x27;s last book of songs &quot;A Pilgrimes Solace&quot;, also published in 1612.

Howard visited Scotland in 1613. He dined with his brother-in-law James Home of Cowdenknowes at Broxmouth House, and then stayed in John Killoch&#x27;s house in Edinburgh&#x27;s Canongate, where the Duke of Lennox had stayed in 1608. He visited Dunfermline Palace and saw the coal works of George Bruce at Culross. After a visit to Stirling Castle, he stayed a night at the Nether Palace or Castlestead of Falkland with Lord Scone, and returned by boat to Leith and the King&#x27;s Wark, the home of Bernard Lindsay. He went to Seton Palace to see Anna Hay, Countess of Winton, and then returned to England.

Howard&#x27;s parents received a pension from Spanish diplomats. In 1617, they were offered a Dutch pension. Howard discussed the deal with the Spanish ambassador Diego Sarmiento de Acuña, Count of Gondomar. He persuaded his parents not to take the Dutch offer, and Gondomar gave him a valuable diamond jewel.

Howard owned Framlingham Castle in Suffolk which he sold to Sir Robert Hitcham in 1635 for the sum of £14,000. He owned Audley End House in Essex as well, built by his father Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk

He died in 1640 at Suffolk House, Charing Cross, London, and was buried on 10 June that year in Saffron Walden.

==Marriage and children==
In March 1612, he married Elizabeth Home (died 19 August 1633), daughter of George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar. According to a memoir of the early life of Princess Elizabeth, the daughter of King James and Anne of Denmark, she had been one of the Princess&#x27;s companions at Coombe Abbey from 1604. They had nine children:
* James Howard, 3rd Earl of Suffolk (c. 16201689)
* Thomas Howard (1621-81), married to Walburga or Werburge van der Kerchove
* Katherine Howard (died 1650), married first George Stewart, 9th Seigneur d&#x27;Aubigny (died 1642), second James Livingston, 1st Earl of Newburgh
* Elizabeth Howard (died 11 March 1705), married on 1 October 1642 Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland
* Margaret Howard, married Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery
* George Howard, 4th Earl of Suffolk (1625–1691)
* Henry Howard, 5th Earl of Suffolk (1627–1709)
* Anne Howard, married Thomas Walsingham
* Frances Howard (c.1633–1677), who married Sir Edward Villiers (died 1689)

<text>Redlands, Sydney Church of England Co-educational Grammar School, is a multi-campus independent co-educational early learning, primary, and secondary day Anglican school located in Cremorne on the Lower North Shore of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Established in 1884, the non-selective school caters to approximately 1,700 students, from early learning and on to kindergarten to Year 12.

Redlands is a member of the Association of Independent Schools NSW, the Independent Schools Association, the Junior School Heads Association of Australia, and the Council of International Schools.

== History ==
Established in 1884 as the College for Girls in Milsons Point with five students, the school was originally run by Elizabeth Liggins and Clara Arnold as a single-sex boarding school. In 1899 the school moved to Cremorne under the name College for Girls, Redlands.

The school was then purchased by Gertrude Amy Roseby and her sister Mabel in 1911 who ran the school until 1945. In 1942, the school discontinued boarding.

Redlands later established an association with the Anglican Diocese of Sydney and became the Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar School, Redlands, in 1945, abbreviated as SCEGGS. The school severed legal ties with the Anglican Diocese in 1976, the same year in which it incorporated as SCEGGS (later SCECGS) Redlands. Whilst being reconstituted as an independent school, it retained the Church of England title in its name, which was also true for SCEGGS&#x27; other branch schools: SCEGGS Darlinghurst, SCEGGS Wollongong, SCEGGS Loquat Valley and SCEGGS Moss Vale.

In 1978, Redlands became coeducational, changing its title to Sydney Church of England Co-educational Grammar School, Redlands, or abbreviated as SCECGS Redlands.

Since the collapse of the Sydney Anglican SCEGGS schools, Redlands has been independently owned and operated by SCECGS Redlands Limited, a public company limited by guarantee. 
The school&#x27;s board, whose current chairperson is Glenn Wightwick, appoints the school principal, monitors performance, manages the school&#x27;s strategic vision and its resources.

Planned for a 20-year time span beginning in 2029, Redlands is planning a significant redevelopment of its current facilities called the &quot;Master Plan&quot;.
=== Principals ===

== Motto ==

The Latin school motto of Redlands, &quot;Luceat lux vestra&quot;, is taken from Matthew 5, and translates to &quot;Let your light shine&quot;. It appears in the school song which was shared with the other SCEGGS schools:

: Students of Redlands School, those old and new
: Gathered or parted, all the world through
: Still to the motto that binds us keep true:
: Luceat Lux Vestra.

== Academics ==
Redlands offers the International Baccalaureate as well as the New South Wales Higher School Certificate. Redlands has offered the International Baccalaureate since 1988, longer than any other school in NSW. 

A large number of students choose the International Baccalaureate each year, with 92 out of 168 students choosing the curriculum in 2024. In 2024 seven students received an ATAR of over 99.

Five languages are taught at Redlands: French, Spanish, Latin, Mandarin and Japanese.

==Campus facilities==
Redlands occupies two campuses in Sydney: the Senior School campus, which houses students from Years 7 to 12 and the Junior School campus, which houses students from preschool to Year 6. In addition the school operates the High Country Campus in Jindabyne.

=== Senior School ===
The Senior School is located on Military Road, Cremorne. 

Peter J. Cornish, school principal from 1981 to 2002, created an association with the immediately adjacent Anglican parish of St Peter&#x27;s, Cremorne. The school continues use of the parish church as the Secondary School chapel where school church services are regularly held. 

The Roseby Building serves as the science block, originally named the Wyndham building, and was refurbished in 2007.

In 2010, the school completed the Redlands Fitness Centre. In 2010–11, a major development was undertaken on the Murdoch Street Campus as part of the Federal government BER program. 

In 2016, the school commenced a 20-year, $114 million redevelopment of the Senior Campus, with the central building being a four-story tall Learning Hub. 

=== Junior School ===
The Junior School campus includes the former Cremorne Girls High School site on Murdoch Street, which it purchased from the Government of New South Wales in 1989. This site houses the Preschool, Preparatory and Junior School students. 

The 1960s three-storey building was demolished to make way for the new home for the Margaret Roberts Preparatory School (K–2) and an all purpose sports and assembly hall. A playground, oval and courts were built.

=== High Country Campus ===
Redlands also owns a separate campus in Jindabyne.

== House system ==
Redlands has four houses; Cowper, McDouall, Roseby and Dumolo, denoted by a badge worn on the school&#x27;s blazer. Each is named after a notable family or person linked with the school&#x27;s history.

School pride amongst students is most prominent at the school&#x27;s yearly Swimming Carnival, Cross Country Carnival, Athletics Carnival and performing arts night – Gala Arts.
== Extracurricular activities ==
=== Sport ===
Redlands is a member of the Independent Schools Association (ISA), also competing against the Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales (AAGPS) in some sports. 

The school offers both representative and non-representative sports, with students being required to compete in one representative sport a year. Summer sports include basketball, swimming, tennis, touch football, indoor hockey, rowing, and sailing. Winter sports include AFL, athletics, cross country, soccer, hockey, netball, rugby, snowsports, tennis, and water polo.

The school&#x27;s rowing program is situated at Mosman Rowing Club, Pearl Bay for on water training, after an arson attack destroyed the shed at Tambourine Bay in 2007.

Each year at its High Country Campus in Jindabyne, Redlands hosts Winter School, a nine-week long residential program where students combine skiing and snowboarding with schoolwork.
 

==Redlands Art Prize==

The school has hosted the Redlands Art Prize since 1996. Since 2013 () it has been named the Redlands Konica Minolta Art Prize and sponsored by Konica Minolta. It was formerly called the Redlands Westpac Art Prize, named after its then sponsor, Westpac.

From 2012 it has been presented at the National Art School in Darlinghurst, after 15 years of being presented by the school, and then by Mosman Gallery. The prize was worth in 2017. As an acquisitive prize, the substantial collection is displayed at the school. Past winners have included Imants Tillers, Pat Brassington, Callum Morton, Julie Gough, Vernon Ah Kee, Ben Quilty, Lindy Lee, Fiona Foley and Tom Polo (2014).

<text>The Berkeley Lazy Abstraction Software verification Tool (BLAST) is a software model checking tool for C programs. The task addressed by BLAST is the need to check whether software satisfies the behavioral requirements of its associated interfaces. BLAST employs counterexample-driven automatic abstraction refinement to construct an abstract model that is then model-checked for safety properties. The abstraction is constructed on the fly, and only to the requested precision.

==Achievements==
BLAST came first in the category DeviceDrivers64 in the 1st Competition on Software Verification (2012) that was held at TACAS 2012 in Tallinn.

BLAST came third (category DeviceDrivers64) in the 2nd Competition on Software Verification (2013) that was held at TACAS 2013 in Rome.

<doc id="1044116" wikidata="Q143609" url="?curid=1044116" title="Lima Locomotive Works">
<text>Lima Locomotive Works (LLW) was an American firm that manufactured railroad locomotives from the 1870s through the 1950s. The company&#x27;s name is derived from the location of its main manufacturing plant in Lima, Ohio ( ). The shops were located between the Erie Railroad main line, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio&#x27;s Cincinnati-Toledo main line and the Nickel Plate Road main line and shops. 

The company produced the Shay geared logging steam locomotive, developed by Ephraim Shay, and for William E. Woodard&#x27;s &quot;Super Power&quot; advanced steam locomotive concept – exemplified by the prototype 2-8-4 Berkshire, Lima demonstrator A-1. In World War II the Lima plant produced the M4A1 version of the M4 Sherman tank.

== History ==


In 1878, James Alley contracted the Lima Machine Works to build a steam locomotive that Ephraim Shay had designed. In April 1880, Lima rebuilt Ephraim Shay&#x27;s original design, using vertically side-mounted pistons mounted on the right, connected to a drive line on the outside of the trucks. The Shay was geared down to provide more slow-moving, pulling ability for use in the lumber industry. The first Shay locomotive was built in 1880; it was such a success that many people in the lumber industry wanted one. To accommodate the new demand for the locomotive, Shay licensed the right to build his locomotive to the Lima Machine Works, which expanded and began to ship Shay locomotives to lumbermen across the frontier. Two years later, locomotives were the main product being produced by the Lima Machine Works, which would produce over 300 locomotives during the next ten years.

After a serious fire, a new shop was opened in 1902 and Shay production continued. Then, with initial demand for low-speed geared locomotives well on the way to being sated, and the new facilities in place, Lima moved into the heavy locomotive field.

== Super Power ==
Success returned to Lima in the 1920s with the new concept of &quot;Super Power&quot; developed by Lima&#x27;s mechanical engineer William E. Woodard. By making a number of significant changes to maximize a steam locomotive&#x27;s capacity to generate and utilize steam, Woodard was able to make such locomotives significantly more powerful and faster. He did this by starting in 1922 with the H-10 experimental heavy 2-8-2 design for the New York Central (Michigan Central 8000) and applying both relatively new science (the Cole ratios), and every efficiency-enhancing tool available – a larger firebox, increased superheat, a feedwater heater, improved drafting, higher boiler pressure, streamlined steam passages and a trailing-truck booster engine, and by applying limited cutoff (the range of steam valve admission settings) to prevent locomotive engineers from using excessive steam at starting. The 2-8-2 thus produced was demonstrated to be 26% more efficient overall than its immediate predecessor, and the NYC bought 301 locomotives.

A large increase in firebox area (from on the H-10 to on the A-1), characteristic of his work, necessitated adding another axle to the trailing truck, thus creating the 2-8-4 wheel arrangement. Built in the spring of 1925, the demonstrator owned by Lima was dubbed the A-1. In addition to supporting the very large firebox and grate, the four-wheeled trailing truck carried the ash pan. For this purpose, the truck was redesigned as an articulated extension of the locomotive frame. The result was an ash pan that could hold more ash, allowing the locomotive to travel farther between cleanings. For roads that burned coal, this was a significant innovation. But it was not without tradeoffs. The articulated frame reduced weight on the driving wheels, which did not aid tractive effort (pulling ability). The locomotives so configured also had more difficulty staying on the rails in reverse, particularly through yard trackwork like switch frogs.

The locomotive quickly proved to be 26-30% more efficient than the New York Central H-10. After a highly successful series of tests in the mid-1920s it was sent around the country to make the idea of &quot;Super Power&quot; known. The first forty-five were purchased by New York Central&#x27;s subsidiary Boston &amp; Albany following initial road testing across the summit of the Berkshire Hills, and so the 2-8-4 wheel arrangement came to be known as the &quot;Berkshire&quot; on most railroads. The prototype itself was later sold to the Illinois Central as part of an order for 50 similar locomotives. Woodard summed up &quot;Super Power&quot; by defining it as &quot;horsepower at speed&quot;. Previous design principles emphasized tractive effort (pulling ability) rather than speed. By 1949 some 613 Berkshires had been constructed for North American service, of which 20 are preserved – at least two in operating condition (Nickel Plate Road 765 and Pere Marquette 1225), both Lima products.

There were at least three successive waves of &quot;Super Power&quot;. The first began with the New York Central 8000 and the A-1, and included Missouri Pacific 2-8-4s and Texas &amp; Pacific 2-10-4s. These locomotives had conventional 63&quot; driving wheels. In 1927, the Erie Railroad took delivery of a &quot;second-phase&quot; Berkshire with 70&quot; driving wheels, capable not only of great power but higher speed; in turn, this design evolved into the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio T-1 2-10-4s of 1930, with 69&quot; driving wheels. The &quot;third-phase&quot; of the later 1930s and war years can be identified with locomotives such as the homebuilt N&amp;W 2-6-6-4s, C&amp;O/Virginian 2-6-6-6 and virtually all American 4-8-4s. Boiler pressures rose as high as 310 lbs/sq.in.; thermic siphons added to the firebox and combustion chamber added 8% to the efficiency of the boiler; roller bearings appeared on main axle boxes and sometimes on running gear. And the &quot;Super Power&quot; concept had extended to other builders such as Alco (the Union Pacific Big Boy) and Baldwin (the Santa Fe 5001- and 5011-class 2-10-4s). The four-wheel trailing truck became the standard for large locomotives (i.e., 4-8-4, 2-10-4, 4-6-6-4, 2-8-8-4), though the articulated main frame did not. Many railroads, particularly roads like the Santa Fe (which favored oil-burning locomotives and, therefore, did not need the oversized ash pan), adopted many of the &quot;Super Power&quot; features but utilized a conventional full frame and separate trailing truck.

The construction of the first 2-8-4 locomotive is documented in David Weitzman&#x27;s book, Superpower: Making of a steam locomotive. David also explains some of the innovations it made at the time.

== Decline ==

While delivering the first group of 2-6-6-6 locomotives in 1941, Lima miscalculated and misrepresented the locomotives&#x27; weight. Maintenance crews recalculated the weight, and discovered that the H-8s weighed , which was thousands of pounds heavier than Lima first claimed. The train crews that worked with the H-8s, who were getting paid based on the locomotives&#x27; weight on the driving wheels at the time, started seeing this misrepresentation as an attack on their livelihood. The C&amp;O was forced to pay their crews thousands of dollars to make up for lost payment, and they subsequently sued Lima for over $3 million in 1944. Lima also lost their pride in building fine machinery, and they would subsequently lose more money within the following years.

In April 1947, the firm merged with General Machinery Corporation of Hamilton, Ohio, to form the Lima-Hamilton Corporation.

Lima-Hamilton’s last steam locomotive was Nickel Plate Road No. 779, a 2-8-4 &quot;Berkshire&quot;, which left the erecting halls in May 1949. That same year, Lima promoted a new wheel arrangement, the 4-8-6. This would have allowed an even larger firebox than the 4-8-4. No example of the type was built, however.

From 1949 to 1951, Lima-Hamilton produced a total of 175 diesel locomotives, in 7 different models.

In 1951, Lima-Hamilton merged with Baldwin Locomotive Works to form Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton (BLH). The Lima-Hamilton line of diesels was discontinued, in favor of Baldwin&#x27;s existing line. Though Lima and Baldwin had been known for high-quality steam locomotives, their line of diesel-electric locomotives was unable to compete with EMD, Alco, and GE. BLH left the locomotive business in 1956.

For a time, Clark Equipment Company manufactured Lima-brand construction cranes in the old plant. Most of the company&#x27;s records and builder&#x27;s drawings have been transferred and are housed in the California State Railroad Museum&#x27;s library in Sacramento, California.

===Preserved steam locomotives===

Many Lima-built steam locomotives have been preserved across the United States and around the world. Numerous Lima-built engines are still operational, especially Shay-type locomotives, examples of which operate at the Colorado Railroad Museum, the Cass Scenic Railroad, the Georgetown Loop Railroad, the Mount Rainier Scenic Railroad, and the Roaring Camp and Big Trees Narrow Gauge Railroad. Other widely known preserved Lima-built steam locomotives include Southern Pacific 4449, Nickel Plate Road 765, Pere Marquette 1225, Chesapeake and Ohio 614, Texas and Pacific 610, Atlanta and West Point 290, Boston and Maine 3713, Tioga Lumber Company Shay C/N 1568 in Harrod, Ohio, and Chesapeake &amp; Ohio 1601 - an Allegheny locomotive displayed indoors at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.

Examples of preserved Lima-built locomotives outside of the U.S. include the USATC S160 Class 5197 at the Churnet Valley Railway in Staffordshire, UK, as well as a former US Army 0-6-0 switcher no. 4076 built in 1944 that resides at the Heritage Park Historical Village in Calgary, Alberta.

<doc id="1044117" wikidata="Q822576" url="?curid=1044117" title="Bernard Loiseau">
<text>Bernard Daniel Jacques Loiseau (; 13 January 1951 – 24 February 2003) was a French chef at Le Relais Bernard Loiseau in Saulieu, Côte-d&#x27;Or. He obtained three stars in the Michelin Guide and had a peak rating of 19.5/20 in the Gault Millau restaurant guide. He was one of the most mediatised French chefs between the 1980s and 1990s.

In 2003, a short time after having become a member of the Relais &amp; Châteaux association, Loiseau was downgraded from 19/20 to 17/20 in the Gault et Millau guide and received a strong negative media review from the gastronomic critic François Simon in the newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, but he still had his three stars in the Michelin Guide. As criticism continued to pour in and while the media speculated about a possible future loss of a Michelin star, he died by suicide by self-inflicted gunshot without giving any explanation. The theories aiming at explaining his death are the object of strong polemics. His decision was likely due to increased bouts of clinical depression.

== Early life ==
Loiseau was born in Chamalières, in the Auvergne region of central France. He decided to become a chef as a teenager, apprenticing at the famous La Maison Troisgros run by the brothers Jean and Pierre Troisgros in Roanne between 1968 and 1971.

== Career ==
In 1972, Loiseau began working for restaurateur Claude Verger at La Barrière de Clichy, and was soon hailed as a prodigy by the Gault Millau guide, a proponent of the nouvelle cuisine style that emphasised lightness and freshness in contrast to the cuisine classique of traditional French gastronomy. When Verger bought the formerly prestigious La Côte d&#x27;Or of Saulieu in 1975, he installed Loiseau as chef and soon stood aside to allow him to develop a highly personal style of cuisine. Loiseau bought La Côte d&#x27;Or from Verger in 1982, and the well known Michelin Guide bestowed the coveted three-star rating on his establishment in 1991. His fanatical attention to detail, frenetic work ethic, and discerning palate, propelled him to the top of his profession, and earned him a knowledgeable and loyal, but unforgiving and demanding clientele.

Bernard Loiseau established Bernard Loiseau SA in 1998, and was the first star restaurateur to establish the concept of having one&#x27;s restaurant incorporated and traded. At the time of his death, he was the only French chef traded on the stock exchange. Under Bernard Loiseau SA, Loiseau published numerous books, established a line of frozen foods, and opened three eateries in Paris, in addition to running La Côte d&#x27;Or and its adjoining boutique shop.

The French government awarded him its highest honour, the decorations of Chevalier (Knight) de la Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1994, Chevalier (Knight) de l&#x27;Ordre national du Mérite in 1986, Officier (Officer) de l&#x27;Ordre national du Mérite in 2002 and Chevalier du Mérite agricole.

== Death ==
In the late 1990s, a new form of Asian-inspired &quot;fusion cuisine&quot; swept France, catering to an international corporate class and pleasing trend-driven &quot;foodies&quot; (a neologism of the movement), which Loiseau resisted. The prevailing notion, however, was that the pre-eminent Loiseau&#x27;s grip was slipping — that his cuisine and philosophy were being superseded by newer trends. He was by this time deeply in debt, and suffered from bouts of increasingly severe clinical depression.

Loiseau died by suicide on 24 February 2003, shooting himself in the head with a shotgun after presiding over the lunch service in his restaurant. The Gault Millau guide had recently downgraded his restaurant from 19/20 to 17/20, and there were also rumours in &quot;Le Figaro&quot; that the Michelin Guide was planning to remove one of La Côte d&#x27;Or&#x27;s three stars.

Loiseau had made a life&#x27;s ambition of becoming a three-star chef, a goal which had required 17 years of hard work at La Côte d&#x27;Or to achieve. After his death, three-star chef Jacques Lameloise said Loiseau had once confided, &quot;If I lose a star, I&#x27;ll kill myself&quot;. While it was later reported that Loiseau was despondent over his debt issues and decreasing patronage at his restaurant, Michelin still received blame in some accounts.

As of 2021 La Côte d&#x27;Or remains a two-star establishment in the hands of executive chef Patrick Bertron.

== In popular media ==
The plot of the 2007 Pixar animated film &quot;Ratatouille&quot; has its roots in Loiseau&#x27;s life story, with the film&#x27;s character of chef Auguste Gusteau being inspired by both Loiseau and Paul Bocuse. La Côte d&#x27;Or was one of the restaurants visited by director Brad Bird and others in France.

<text>Copha, a registered trademark of Peerless Foods under license from Unilever and Upfield, is a form of vegetable fat shortening made from hydrogenated coconut oil. Copha is produced exclusively in Australia. It is 100% fat, at least 98% of which is saturated. It also contains soybean lecithin.

It is used in Australia for confectionery, such as rocky road, and a number of foods for children, being an essential ingredient in white Christmas, and in chocolate crackles, which are made from Rice Bubbles, copha and cocoa powder. It is also used as a &quot;chocolate coating&quot; on baked goods, that amounts to a form of compound chocolate.

Concern about the health hazards of hydrogenated fats (trans fats) is a contributor to the declining popularity of Copha-based confectionery.

In New Zealand, it is marketed as &quot;Kremelta&quot;. Known in Europe as coconut fat, it is available either in its pure form, or in solid form with lecithin added as an emulsifier. In France it is marketed as &quot;Végétaline&quot; and in Germany and Denmark it is marketed as &quot;Palmin&quot;. It is not readily available in the United States.

<doc id="1044133" wikidata="Q883138" url="?curid=1044133" title="Hock (wine)">
<text>Hock is a British term for German white wine. It sometimes refers to white wine from the Rhine region (specifically Riesling) and sometimes to all German white wine. The word &quot;hock&quot; , derived from the name of the town of Hochheim am Main in Germany. Over the years, hock-shaped bottles have come to signify sweet, cheap wine in general. 

The term seems to have been in use in the 17th century, initially for white wines (predominantly Riesling) from the Rheingau, but in the 18th century it came to be used for any German white wine sold in Britain, to convey some of the then very high prestige of Rheingau wine to (often much) lesser German wines.

It seems probable that Queen Victoria&#x27;s visit in 1850 to Hochheim (in Rheingau) and its vineyards during harvest time contributed to the continued use of the term. Supposedly by HOCHheim becoming shortened to HOCH and the hard German CH becoming written as CK to aid English speakers in its pronunciation. By then, those Rheingau wines commanded high prices, on par with, and sometimes higher than, the best wines from Bordeaux and Burgundy, matching and sometimes exceeding them in prestige.

There are many vineyards associated with Hocks, such as Hochheimer, Rüdesheimer, Marcobrunner and Johannisberger.

<doc id="1044135" wikidata="Q5654204" url="?curid=1044135" title="Harare Declaration">
<text>The Harare Commonwealth Declaration was a declaration of the Commonwealth of Nations, setting out the Commonwealth&#x27;s core principles and values, detailing the Commonwealth&#x27;s membership criteria, and redefining and reinforcing its purpose. The Declaration was issued in Harare, Zimbabwe, on 20 October 1991, during the twelfth Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. It reaffirmed the political principles laid out in the Singapore Declaration of twenty years before, and (along with the Singapore Declaration) is considered one of the two most important documents to the Commonwealth&#x27;s uncodified constitution, until the adoption of the Charter of the Commonwealth in 2012.

The Singapore Declaration had committed the Commonwealth to several principles in 1971: world peace and support for the United Nations; individual liberty and egalitarianism; opposition to racism; opposition to colonialism; the eradication of poverty, ignorance, disease, and economic inequality; free trade; institutional co-operation; multilateralism; and the rejection of international coercion. The Harare Declaration reaffirmed all these except the last. It also emphasised in particular a few of the principles and values mentioned in Singapore as integral to the Commonwealth project:

* We believe that international peace and order, global economic development and the rule of international law are essential to the security and prosperity of mankind;
* We believe in the liberty of the individual under the law, in equal rights for all citizens regardless of gender, race, colour, creed or political belief, and in the individual&#x27;s inalienable right to participate by means of free and democratic political processes in framing the society in which he or she lives;
* We recognise racial prejudice and intolerance as a dangerous sickness and a threat to healthy development, and racial discrimination as an unmitigated evil;
* We oppose all forms of racial oppression, and we are committed to the principles of human dignity and equality;
* We recognise the importance and urgency of economic and social development to satisfy the basic needs and aspirations of the vast majority of the peoples of the world, and seek the progressive removal of the wide disparities in living standards amongst our members.

At Harare, the Heads of Government dedicated themselves to applying these principles to then-current issues, such as the end of the Cold War, the near-completion of decolonisation, and the impending end of the apartheid government in South Africa. The declaration also charted a course for the Commonwealth to take it into the next century.

The next part of the declaration details the purpose of the Commonwealth, and the activities in which it ought to engage to further the values expounded.

Critical to the document is the removal of a reference to the opposition to international coercion, which had been included in the Singapore Declaration. The implication at Singapore was that not even the Commonwealth itself had any right to enforce its other core values, as they could only be enforced by using coercive powers. This apparent conflict was resolved at Harare, and further clarified by the Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme, which clearly mandated the Commonwealth to concern itself with its members&#x27; internal situations.

In 2002, Zimbabwe was suspended for breaching the Harare Declaration. The country withdrew from the Commonwealth in 2003 when the Commonwealth refused to lift the suspension.

<doc id="1044136" wikidata="Q381640" url="?curid=1044136" title="Aeroponics">
<text>Aeroponics is the process of cultivating plants in an air or mist environment, eliminating the need for soil or an aggregate medium. The term &quot;aeroponic&quot; originates from the ancient Greek: &quot;aer&quot; (air) and &quot;ponos&quot; (labor, hardship, or toil). It falls under the category of hydroponics, as water is employed in aeroponics to deliver nutrients to the plants.

==Methods==
The fundamental principle of aeroponic growing entails suspending plants in a closed or semi-closed environment whilst spraying their roots and lower stems with a nutrient-rich water solution in an atomized or sprayed form. The upper portion of the plant, including the leaves and crown, referred to as the canopy, extends above. The plant support structure keeps the roots separated. To minimize labor and expenses, closed-cell foam is often compressed around the lower stem and inserted into an opening in the aeroponic chamber. In the case of larger plants, trellising is employed to support the weight of the vegetation and fruits.

The goal is to maintain an environment free from pests and diseases, allowing the plants to thrive and grow faster than those cultivated in a growing medium. However, since most aeroponic environments are not completely sealed off from the outside, pests and diseases can still pose a threat. Controlled environments facilitate the advancement of plant development, health, growth, flowering, and fruiting for various plant species and cultivars.

Due to the sensitivity of root systems, aeroponics is often combined with conventional hydroponics. This serves as a backup nutrition and water supply in case of any failure in the aeroponic system, acting as an emergency &quot;crop saver.&quot;

High-pressure aeroponics refers to the method of delivering nutrients to the roots using mist heads with a size range of 20-50 micrometers. This is achieved using a high-pressure diaphragm pump operating at around 80 pounds per square inch (550 kPa).

==Benefits and drawbacks==
===Increased air exposure===

Air cultures maximize air exposure to facilitate optimal plant growth. The materials and devices that hold and support aeroponically grown plants must be completely free from disease or pathogens. A vital characteristic of a genuine aeroponic culture and apparatus is minimal plant support features. This design allows maximum airflow around the plant by minimizing contact between the plant and the support structure. In long-term aeroponic cultivation, it is crucial to ensure that the root systems are unconstrained, allowing unrestricted growth, root expansion, unhindered access to pure water, adequate air exchange, and disease-free conditions.

===Benefits of oxygen in the root zone===
Adequate oxygen (O2) availability in the rhizosphere (root zone) is essential for promoting healthy plant growth. In aeroponics, where plants are grown in an environment of air and micro-droplets of water, almost any plant can thrive and reach maturity with an abundant supply of oxygen, water, and nutrients.

Some growers prefer aeroponic systems over other hydroponic methods, since the increased aeration of the nutrient solution provides greater oxygenation to the plant roots, stimulating growth and aiding in the prevention of pathogen formation.

Clean air plays a crucial role in purifying the environment for plants in aeroponics. Unrestricted access to air is necessary for natural plant growth and successful physiological development. If the support structure restricts the plant&#x27;s natural growth, it can increase the risk of plant damage and subsequent disease formation.

Researchers have utilized aeroponics to study the impact of gas composition in the root zone on plant performance. Soffer and Burger (1988) conducted a study on the effects of dissolved oxygen concentrations in a system they termed &quot;aero-hydroponics,&quot; which involved a 3-tier hydro and aero system with distinct zones within the root area. Their results indicated that dissolved oxygen is crucial for root formation. Additionally, they found that in the misted section, where nutrient mist was provided, the number and length of roots were consistently greater compared to the submerged or un-misted sections. Even at the lowest oxygen concentration tested, the misted section demonstrated successful root development.

===Other benefits of air (CO2)===
Aeroponics also entails the management of CO2 levels in the system&#x27;s air, which subsequently impacts the rate of photosynthesis in plants.

Utilizing artificial lights for growth offers advantages such as increased growth rates and enhanced reliability compared to solar lighting. This lighting method can be effectively combined with aeroponics to optimize plant growth.

===Disease-free cultivation===
Aeroponics offers the advantage of limiting disease transmission since it reduces plant-to-plant contact, and each spray pulse can be kept sterile. In contrast, diseases can easily spread throughout soil, aggregate, or other growing media, affecting multiple plants. Traditional greenhouses often require sterilization of solid media after each crop, and sometimes these media are simply discarded and replaced with fresh, sterile ones.

One significant benefit of aeroponic technology is the ability to quickly remove a diseased plant from the plant support structure without disrupting or infecting other plants, thanks to the isolated nature of the system.

Due to the disease-free environment unique to aeroponics, many plants can be grown at higher densities (plants per square meter) compared to more traditional cultivation methods like hydroponics, soil, and Nutrient Film Technique (NFT). Commercial aeroponic systems incorporate hardware features that accommodate the expanding root systems of crops.

Researchers have highlighted aeroponics as a valuable, simple, and rapid method for preliminary screening of genotypes for resistance to specific seedling blights or root rots. The isolating nature of aeroponic systems enables researchers to avoid complications encountered when studying these infections in soil cultures.

===Water and nutrient hydro-atomization===
Aeroponic equipment employs sprayers, misters, foggers, or other devices to create a fine mist of solution for delivering nutrients to plant roots. Aeroponic systems are typically closed-looped systems designed to provide macro and micro-environments that sustain reliable and consistent air cultures. Several inventions have been developed to facilitate aeroponic spraying and misting. The size of the water droplet is critical for root development in an aeroponic environment. In commercial applications, a 360° hydro-atomizing spray is used, which utilizes air pressure misting to cover large areas of roots.

A variation of the mist technique, known as fogponics, utilizes ultrasonic foggers to mist nutrient solutions in low-pressure aeroponic devices.

Water droplet size plays a vital role in maintaining aeroponic growth. Water droplets that are too large can limit the availability of oxygen to the root system. Conversely, excessively fine water droplets generated by ultrasonic misters can lead to excessive root hair growth without developing a lateral root system necessary for sustained growth in an aeroponic system.

Mineralization of ultrasonic transducers requires maintenance and presents a potential risk of component failure. This is also a drawback of metal spray jets and misters. Restricted access to water can cause plants to lose turgidity and wilt.

===Advanced materials===
NASA has provided funding for research and development of new advanced materials aimed at improving the reliability and reducing maintenance in aeroponics. It has been determined that a high-pressure hydro-atomized mist with micro-droplets ranging from 5 to 50 micrometers is necessary for sustained aeroponic growth.

To ensure long-term growth, the mist system must possess significant pressure to effectively penetrate the dense root system(s). Achieving repeatability is crucial in aeroponics, and this includes maintaining the appropriate hydro-atomized droplet size. The degradation of the spray caused by mineralization of mist heads hampers the delivery of the water nutrient solution, resulting in an environmental imbalance within the air culture system.

To address this issue, special low-mass polymer materials have been developed and are utilized to prevent mineralization in the next generation of hydro-atomizing misting and spray jets. These materials help maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of the misting system.

===Nutrient uptake===

The discrete nature of interval and duration aeroponics allows for the measurement of nutrient uptake over time, even under varying conditions. Barak et al. conducted a study using an aeroponic system to non-destructively measure water and ion uptake rates in cranberries (Barak, Smith et al. 1996).

In their research, the team found that by measuring the concentrations and volumes of input and efflux solutions, they could accurately calculate the nutrient uptake rate. To validate their findings, they compared the results with N-isotope measurements. Once their analytical method was verified, Barak et al. proceeded to gather additional data specific to cranberries. This included studying variations in nutrient uptake, examining the correlation between ammonium uptake and proton efflux, and exploring the relationship between ion concentration and uptake. These findings highlight the potential of aeroponics not only as a valuable research tool for studying nutrient uptake but also as a means to monitor plant health and optimize crop cultivation in closed environments.

Atomization at pressures exceeding 65 pounds per square inch (450 kPa) increases the bioavailability of nutrients. Consequently, nutrient strength must be significantly reduced to prevent leaf and root burn. It&#x27;s worth noting the large water droplets in the photo on the right, which indicate that the feed cycle may be too long or the pause cycle too short. Both scenarios discourage lateral root growth and root hair development. Optimal results are achieved when feed cycles are as short as possible, with roots remaining slightly damp but never excessively dry. A typical feed/pause cycle is less than 2 seconds of feeding followed by approximately 1.5-2 minutes of pause, maintained continuously. However, when an accumulator system is incorporated, cycle times can be further reduced to less than approximately 1 second of feeding and around 1 minute of pause.

===As a research tool===
Shortly after its development, aeroponics emerged as a valuable research tool, providing researchers with a non-invasive method to examine developing roots. This innovative technology expanded the possibilities for conducting experiments by offering a larger number of parameters and a wider range of experimental conditions.

The precise control over root zone moisture levels and water delivery makes aeroponics particularly well-suited for studying water stress. K. Hubick evaluated aeroponics as a means to consistently produce plants with minimal water stress, which can be utilized in drought or flood physiology experiments.

Aeroponics are a better choice when it comes to investigating root morphology. The absence of aggregates enables researchers to easily access the entire, intact root structure without causing damage that may occur when removing roots from soils or aggregates. It has been observed that aeroponics yields more natural root systems compared to hydroponics.

==Terminology==

==Types of aeroponics==

===Low-pressure units===
In most low-pressure aeroponic gardens, the plant roots are suspended above a reservoir of nutrient solution or inside a channel connected to a reservoir. A low-pressure pump is used to deliver the nutrient solution either through jets or ultrasonic transducers, and the excess solution then drips or drains back into the reservoir. However, as plants mature in these units, it is common for certain sections of the root systems to become dry, which hinders proper nutrient uptake. These units typically lack the necessary features to purify the nutrient solution and effectively remove inconsistencies, debris, and harmful pathogens. Due to their cost constraints, such units are often more suitable for small-scale benchtop growing and for demonstrating the principles of aeroponics.

===High-pressure devices===

High-pressure aeroponic techniques, which employ mist generation through high-pressure pump(s), are commonly employed in the cultivation of high value crops and plant specimens. The benefits of using this method in horticulture can compensate for the higher setup costs involved.

High-pressure aeroponic systems incorporate advanced technologies for air and water purification, nutrient sterilization, the utilization of low-mass polymers, and pressurized nutrient delivery systems. These features enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the aeroponic setup.

===Commercial systems===
Commercial aeroponic systems comprise high-pressure device hardware along with biological systems. The biological systems matrix incorporates various enhancements aimed at extending plant life and promoting crop maturation.

Biological subsystems and hardware components encompass several features and functionalities, such as effluent control systems, disease prevention measures, pathogen resistance mechanisms, precise timing and pressurization of nutrient solutions, sensors for heating and cooling, thermal control of solutions, efficient light arrays with optimized photon flux, spectrum filtration capabilities, fail-safe sensors and protection mechanisms, reduced maintenance and labor-saving features, as well as ergonomic design and long-term reliability features.

These commercial aeroponic systems, including the high-pressure devices, are primarily utilized for cultivating high-value crops, enabling multiple crop rotations on a continuous commercial scale.

Advanced commercial systems go a step further by incorporating data gathering, monitoring, analytical feedback, and internet connectivity to various subsystems, enhancing overall efficiency and productivity.

==History==
In 1911, published an article titled &quot;On Air Plant Cultures&quot; in the journal &quot;Experienced Agronomy.&quot; In this article, he introduced his method of conducting physiological studies on root systems by spraying various substances in the surrounding air, which is now known as the aeroponics method. Artsikhovski designed the first aeroponic systems and demonstrated their effectiveness for plant cultivation.

In 1942, W. Carter conducted pioneering research on air culture growing and described a method for growing plants in water vapor to facilitate root examination.
Since 2006, aeroponics has been widely used in agriculture worldwide.

In 1944, L.J. Klotz made an important discovery by misting citrus plants, which facilitated his research on diseases affecting citrus and avocado roots. In 1952, G.F. Trowel successfully grew apple trees using a spray culture technique.

In 1957, F. W. Went coined the term &quot;aeroponics&quot; to describe the air-growing process. He grew coffee plants and tomatoes with air-suspended roots, nourishing them through the application of a nutrient mist to the root section.

===Genesis Machine, 1983===

The first commercially available aeroponic apparatus was manufactured and brought to market by GTi in 1983. At that time, it was named the &quot;Genesis Machine&quot;, inspired by the film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. The &quot;Genesis Machine&quot; was marketed as the &quot;Genesis Rooting System.&quot;

GTi&#x27;s device featured an open-loop water-driven system controlled by a microchip. It delivered a high-pressure hydro-atomized nutrient spray within an aeroponic chamber. The &quot;Genesis Machine&quot; was designed to be connected to a water faucet and an electrical outlet, providing the necessary resources for operation.

===Aeroponic propagation (cloning)===

Aeroponic culturing has brought about a revolution in cloning (vegetative propagation) of plants. It has made the propagation of numerous plants, previously considered difficult or impossible, much easier through stem cuttings in aeroponics. Delicate hardwoods and cacti, which were sensitive to bacterial infections when propagated through cuttings, can now be successfully propagated in aeroponic systems. The success of propagation in aeroponics can be attributed to the highly aerated environment around the roots, promoting root hair development (Soffer and Burger, 1988), as well as enhanced root and overall growth due to nutrient supply through the aeroponic system (Santos and Fisher, 2009). Additionally, the absence of rooting media reduces the risk of root diseases (Mehandru et al., 2014).

Aeroponics plays a crucial role in propagating plants that have low success rates in vegetative propagation, plants with significant medicinal uses, high-demand plants, and in creating new cultivars of specific plant species. For instance, Leptadenia reticulata, an important medicinal plant with low reproductive rates through both seeds and cuttings, has found easier propagation through aeroponics (Mehandru et al., 2014). Aeroponics has also contributed to the availability of elm trees, including Ulmus Americana cultivars, which were severely affected by Dutch elm disease (Oakes et al., 2012).

Aeroponics serves as a more advantageous alternative to the traditional method of using overhead misters (Peterson et al., 2018). It boasts a higher success rate compared to overhead misters, which have drawbacks such as the need for large volumes of water, potential unsanitary conditions, uneven misting coverage, and possible leaching of foliar nutrients (Peterson et al., 2018). In essence, cloning has become easier with the use of aeroponic apparatus, as it initiates faster and cleaner root development through a sterile, nutrient-rich, highly oxygenated, and moist environment (Hughes, 1983).

===Air-rooted transplants===

Aeroponics has made significant advancements in tissue culture technology, enabling faster plant cloning and reducing the labor-intensive steps associated with traditional tissue culture techniques. One of the notable benefits of aeroponics is its ability to eliminate the need for stage I and stage II plantings into soil, which has been a challenge for tissue culture growers. In tissue culture, plants are initially planted in sterile media (stage I) and then transferred to sterile soil (stage II) before eventually being transplanted to field soil. This entire process is not only labor-intensive but also prone to disease, infection, and failure.

By utilizing aeroponics, growers can directly clone and transplant air-rooted plants into field soil. The aeroponic roots are more resistant to wilting, leaf loss, and transplant shock compared to traditional methods like hydroponics. Moreover, air-rooted plants tend to be healthier and less susceptible to pathogen infections. However, it is important to maintain the root chamber&#x27;s relative humidity (RH) below to prevent the development of issues like fungus gnats, algae, and anaerobic bacteria.

The efforts of GTi in developing an all-plastic aeroponic method and apparatus controlled by a microprocessor have ushered in a new era of artificial life support for plants, allowing them to grow naturally without the use of soil or traditional hydroponics. In fact, GTi obtained a patent for their innovative aeroponic system in 1985.

Aeroponics has gained recognition as a time- and cost-saving technique. The economic application of aeroponics in agriculture is under development in the 21st century.

===Genesis Growing System, 1985===

In 1985, GTi unveiled the second generation of aeroponics hardware, known as the &quot;Genesis Growing System&quot;. This new apparatus represented a significant advancement in aeroponics technology as it introduced a closed-loop system. The Genesis Growing System utilized recycled effluent, which was precisely controlled by a microprocessor. With this innovation, aeroponics expanded its capabilities to include supporting seed germination, making GTi&#x27;s system the world&#x27;s first plant and harvest aeroponic system.

It is worth noting that many of these early open-loop and closed-loop aeroponic systems continue to operate successfully to this day.

===Commercialization===
Aeroponics made its transition from laboratories to the commercial cultivation sector. In 1966, Bruce Briggs, a pioneer in commercial aeroponics, successfully induced roots on hardwood cuttings through air-rooting. He discovered that air-rooted cuttings were more robust and hardened compared to those formed in soil, and concluded that air-rooting was a sound principle. Briggs also found that air-rooted trees could be transplanted to soil without experiencing transplant shock, which is often observed in hydroponic transplants.

In 1982, Isaac Nir in Israel developed a patent for an aeroponic apparatus that utilized compressed low-pressure air to deliver a nutrient solution to suspended plants held by styrofoam inside large metal containers.

In 1976, British researcher John Prewer conducted a series of aeroponic experiments in the UK, where lettuces were grown from seed to maturity in 22 days using polyethylene film tubes. The fog droplets used in these experiments were generated by equipment supplied by Mee Industries of California. In collaboration with John Prewer, a commercial grower named Kings Nurseries on the Isle of Wight used a different design of aeroponics system in 1984 to grow strawberry plants. The strawberries flourished, yielding a bountiful crop that was highly appreciated by customers, especially the elderly, who valued the cleanliness, quality, and flavor of the fruit, as well as the convenience of picking it without stooping.

In 1983, Richard Stoner filed a patent for the first microprocessor interface designed to deliver tap water and nutrients into an enclosed aeroponic chamber made of plastic. Stoner subsequently established several companies dedicated to researching and advancing aeroponic hardware, interfaces, biocontrols, and components for commercial aeroponic crop production.
Stoner&#x27;s company, Genesis Technology Inc, played a pioneering role in manufacturing, marketing, and applying large-scale closed-loop aeroponic systems in greenhouses for commercial crop production.

In the 1990s, General Hydroponics [Europe] (GHE) attempted to introduce aeroponics to the hobby hydroponics market and introduced the Aerogarden system. Although the Aerogarden did not meet the criteria of &quot;true&quot; aeroponics as it produced droplets instead of a fine mist, it created a demand for aeroponic growing in the hobby market. The distinction between mist aeroponics and droplet aeroponics became blurred in the eyes of many. However, a UK firm called Nutriculture conducted trials of true mist aeroponics, which showed positive results compared to traditional growing techniques like Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) and Ebb &amp; Flood. Despite the drawbacks of cost and maintenance, Nutriculture developed a scalable, easy-to-use droplet-aeroponic system called the Amazon, acknowledging that better results could be achieved by propagating plants in their branded X-stream aeroponic propagator and then transferring them to the specially designed droplet-aeroponic growing system.

===Aeroponically grown food===
In 1986, Stoner achieved a significant milestone by becoming the first person to successfully market fresh aeroponically grown food to a national grocery chain. His accomplishment garnered attention, and he was invited for an interview on NPR, where he highlighted the significance of aeroponics in terms of water conservation, both in modern agriculture and even in space exploration.

==Aeroponics in space==

===Space plants===

Plants had their first encounters with Earth&#x27;s orbit back in 1960 during two separate missions, namely Sputnik 4 and Discoverer 17 (for a comprehensive review of plant growth in space during the first 30 years, refer to Halstead and Scott, 1990). The Sputnik 4 mission involved carrying seeds of wheat, pea, maize, spring onion, and &quot;Nigella damascena&quot;, while &quot;Chlorella pyrenoidosa&quot; cells were taken into orbit on the Discoverer 17 mission.

Following these early endeavors, plant experiments were conducted on various missions involving Bangladesh, China, and joint Soviet-American efforts, including Biosatellite II, Skylab 3 and 4, Apollo-Soyuz, Sputnik, Vostok, and Zond. Initial research findings shed light on how low gravity affected the orientation of roots and shoots (Halstead and Scott, 1990).

Subsequent research delved into investigating the impact of low gravity on plants at different levels, such as organismic, cellular, and subcellular. At the organismic level, several species including pine, oat, mung bean, lettuce, cress, and &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; exhibited decreased seedling, root, and shoot growth under low gravity conditions. However, lettuce grown on the Cosmos mission showed the opposite effect, displaying enhanced growth in space (Halstead and Scott, 1990). Mineral uptake in plants grown in space was also found to be affected. For instance, peas grown in space demonstrated increased levels of phosphorus and potassium, while the divalent cations calcium, magnesium, manganese, zinc, and iron exhibited decreased levels (Halstead and Scott, 1990).

===Biocontrols in space===
In 1996, Richard Stoner&#x27;s research on organic disease control (ODC) received funding from NASA. The goal was to develop a natural liquid biocontrol solution for closed-loop hydroponic systems that could prevent plant diseases and increase yields without the need for pesticides. By 1997, NASA conducted biocontrol experiments with Stoner&#x27;s ODC solution. The experiments took place using BioServe Space Technologies&#x27; GAP technology, which consisted of miniature growth chambers. Bean seeds were treated with the ODC solution in triplicate experiments conducted aboard the MIR space station, at the Kennedy Space Center, and at Colorado State University under total darkness conditions to eliminate light as a variable. The focus of the NASA experiment was solely on studying the benefits of the biocontrol.

Results from NASA&#x27;s enclosed environment bean experiments on the MIR space station and shuttle confirmed that ODC promoted increased germination rates, better sprouting, enhanced growth, and activated natural plant disease mechanisms. Although initially developed for NASA, ODC is not limited to space applications. Soil and hydroponics growers can also incorporate ODC into their planting techniques, as it complies with USDA NOP standards for organic farming.

One notable example of ODC&#x27;s expansion in agriculture is its application in the cannabis industry. The ODC product line has been developed specifically for emerging agricultural crops like cannabis. The active ingredients in the ODC cannabis line include the original chitosan ingredient at a concentration of 0.25%, as well as 0.28% colloidal nitrogen and 0.05% calcium.

In order to enhance the resilience of hydroponic and aeroponic systems against plant diseases and reduce reliance on chemical additives, NASA explores the integration of environmental biocontrols into the design of these systems. The Advanced Plant Habitat (APA), deployed on the International Space Station (ISS) since 2018, exemplifies this approach. Equipped with over 180 sensors, the APA optimizes plant growth and health while decreasing the need for chemical additive biocontrols. The sensors monitor various environmental factors, including lighting intensity, spectrum, and photoperiod, temperature, CO2 levels, relative humidity, irrigation, as well as plant-derived ethylene and volatile organic compound (VOC) scrubbing. Additionally, the APA features leaf and root zone temperature sensors, root zone moisture sensors, and oxygen concentration meters.

These environmental controls serve two main purposes in inhibiting plant diseases. Firstly, they maintain environmental conditions that directly hinder the growth of diseases, fungi, and pests. By carefully regulating factors like temperature and humidity, the risk of infections, such as botrytis in leaves, is reduced as the environment becomes less conducive to disease proliferation. Secondly, these controls create conditions that promote the plant&#x27;s natural disease prevention mechanisms, indirectly inhibiting the effects of plant diseases. For instance, experiments with peppers conducted under blue light conditions have shown increased resilience to powdery mildew.

===Aeroponics for Earth and space===

In 1998, Stoner received funding from NASA to develop a high-performance aeroponic system suitable for use on Earth as well as in space. Through his research, Stoner demonstrated significant increases in growth rates of lettuce plants cultivated in aeroponic systems compared to other cultivation techniques. NASA subsequently adopted many of the aeroponic advancements developed by Stoner.

Research efforts have focused on identifying and developing technologies for rapid plant growth in different gravitational environments. Low-gravity environments present challenges such as efficient delivery of water and nutrients to plants, as well as the recovery of waste products. Food production in space also requires addressing issues like water management, minimizing water usage, and reducing system weight. Additionally, future food production on planetary bodies like the Moon and Mars will involve dealing with reduced gravity environments. Given the varying fluid dynamics at different levels of gravity, optimizing nutrient delivery systems has been a major focus in developing plant growth systems.

Various nutrient delivery methods are currently employed, both on Earth and in low-gravity environments. Substrate-dependent methods include traditional soil cultivation, zeoponics, agar, and nutrient-loaded ion exchange resins. In addition to substrate-dependent approaches, non-soil methods have been developed, including the nutrient film technique, ebb and flow, aeroponics, and others. Hydroponic systems, with their high nutrient solution throughput, can achieve rapid plant growth. However, this necessitates large volumes of water and significant recycling of the solution, which poses challenges for controlling solutions in microgravity conditions.

Aeroponic systems use hydro-atomized sprays to deliver nutrients, resulting in minimal water usage, enhanced root oxygenation, and excellent plant growth. The nutrient solution throughput of aeroponic systems is higher compared to other systems designed for low-gravity environments. Aeroponics eliminates the need for substrates and reduces the quantity of waste material that must be managed by other life support systems. By removing the substrate requirement, planting and harvesting processes are simplified, automation becomes easier, the weight and volume of expendable materials are reduced, and a potential pathway for pathogen transmission is eliminated. These advantages highlight the potential of aeroponic production in microgravity environments and its efficiency in food production for outer space.

===NASA inflatable aeroponics===

In 1999, NASA allocated funding to support the development of an inflatable low-mass aeroponic system (AIS) for high-performance food production in both space and on Earth. The AIS is a self-contained and self-supporting system designed to deliver nutrients and mist to plant roots in an aeroponic environment. Its inflatable structure offers the advantage of being lightweight and can be deflated to occupy less volume during transportation and storage. This current version of AIS represents an improvement over previous designs that utilized rigid structures, which tend to be more costly to manufacture and transport.

On Earth, the cost of materials and transportation can pose challenges to the economic viability of aeroponic systems for commercial growers. However, these challenges become even more pronounced when considering the limitations imposed by payload mass for space transportation.

To overcome these limitations, NASA has developed specialized materials capable of withstanding the harsh space environment for inflatable habitats and structures. These materials, similar to aramid fibers, are currently being utilized in the development of expandable habitats by Bigelow Aerospace. Successful tests have been conducted in space with one of Bigelow&#x27;s Expandable Activity Modules, demonstrating the feasibility of such inflatable structures in the space environment.

==Benefits of aeroponics for earth and space==

Aeroponics possesses numerous characteristics that contribute to its effectiveness and efficiency as a method of plant cultivation.

===Less nutrient solution throughout===

Plants grown using aeroponics spend 99.98% of their time in the air, with only 0.02% in direct contact with hydro-atomized nutrient solution. This minimal contact with water allows the roots to efficiently capture oxygen. Additionally, the hydro-atomized mist plays a significant role in effectively oxygenating the roots. A comparison between aeroponics and Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) reveals that aeroponics has a lower nutrient throughput of 1.5 milliliters per minute, in contrast to NFT&#x27;s 1 liter per minute.

The reduced volume of nutrient throughput in aeroponics leads to a reduction in the overall amount of nutrients required for plant development.

Another advantage of the reduced throughput, particularly relevant for space applications, is the decreased water volume used. This reduction in water volume not only lightens the weight needed to sustain plant growth but also reduces the buffer volume. Additionally, the volume of effluent produced by the plants is minimized in aeroponics, resulting in a reduced amount of water that requires treatment for reuse.

The use of relatively small solution volumes in aeroponics, combined with the limited exposure of roots to the hydro-atomized mist, minimizes root-to-root contact and reduces the spread of pathogens among plants.

===Greater control of plant environment===

Aeroponics provides greater control over the environment surrounding the root zone compared to other plant growth systems like hydroponics. In aeroponics, the plant roots are not continuously surrounded by any medium.

===Improved nutrient feeding===
Aeroponics offers the flexibility to administer various nutrient solutions to the root zone without the need to flush out previous solutions or matrices. This high level of control is particularly valuable for studying the impact of different nutrient regimens on specific plant species. Moreover, aeroponics enables a wider range of growth conditions compared to other nutrient delivery systems. For instance, the interval and duration of nutrient sprays can be finely adjusted to meet the specific requirements of a plant species. This means that the aboveground tissue can experience a different environment from that of the roots.

===More user-friendly===
The design of an aeroponic system enables convenient handling of plants. This is due to the individual separation of plants and their suspension in the air, free from any matrix that could entrap the roots. As a result, harvesting each plant becomes a straightforward task. Similarly, removing any infected plant is easily done without the risk of uprooting or contaminating nearby plants.

===More cost effective===

Aeroponic systems offer cost-effective advantages compared to other systems. The reduced volume of solution throughput, as mentioned earlier, translates to lower water and nutrient requirements in the system. Additionally, the elimination of substrates and the need for many moving parts contribute to cost savings.

===Use of seed stocks===
Aeroponics offers a solution to minimize the negative impact of pathogens in seed stocks. As previously mentioned, the separation of plants and the absence of a shared growth matrix contribute to this advantage. Moreover, aeroponics provides an enclosed and controlled environment, making it an ideal system for growing pathogen-free seed stocks. The enclosed growth chamber, combined with the isolation of plants from each other, serves to prevent initial contamination from external pathogens and limits the spread of any existing pathogens among plants.

==21st century aeroponics==

Aeroponics represents a significant advancement in artificial life support for plants, offering benefits such as non-damaging plant support, efficient seed germination, precise environmental control, and unrestricted growth. In comparison to traditional agricultural techniques like hydroponics and drip irrigation, which have been in use for decades, aeroponics provides notable improvements in plant cultivation.

===Contemporary aeroponics===
Contemporary aeroponic techniques have been extensively researched at NASA&#x27;s BioServe Space Technologies ( ) located on the campus of the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado. This research center focuses on the development and commercialization of aeroponic systems. Additionally, scientists at Ames Research Center have conducted research on enclosed loop systems, investigating methods for growing food crops in low-gravity environments to support future space colonization efforts.

In 2000, Stoner was granted a patent for his organic disease control biocontrol technology, which enables pesticide-free cultivation in aeroponic systems.

A notable milestone in aeroponics occurred in 2004 when Ed Harwood, the founder of AeroFarms, invented an innovative aeroponic system that utilizes micro fleece cloth to grow lettuces. AeroFarms, leveraging Harwood&#x27;s patented aeroponic technology, currently operates the largest indoor vertical farm in the world based on its annual growing capacity in Newark, New Jersey. This state-of-the-art farm employs aeroponic technology to produce and distribute up to two million pounds of pesticide-free leafy greens each year.

===Aeroponic bio-pharming===

Aeroponic bio-pharming is an innovative approach used to cultivate pharmaceutical medicines within plants. This technology provides complete containment, ensuring that effluents and by-products of biopharma crops are confined within a closed-loop facility. In a notable development in 2005, Dr. Neil Reese of South Dakota State University conducted GMO research using aeroponics to grow genetically modified corn.

Dr. Reese considers it a significant achievement to successfully grow corn in an aeroponic system for bio-massing. Previous attempts at growing various types of corn using hydroponics had been unsuccessful.

Through the implementation of advanced aeroponics techniques, Dr. Reese was able to harvest mature ears of genetically modified corn while effectively containing the corn pollen and spent effluent water, thus preventing their release into the environment. This containment ensures that the surrounding environment remains free from GMO contamination.

Dr. Reese emphasizes that aeroponics offers the potential for economically viable bio-pharming practices, making it a promising avenue for pharmaceutical production.

===Large scale integration of aeroponics===
In 2006, the Institute of Biotechnology at Vietnam National University of Agriculture, in collaboration with Stoner, established a postgraduate doctoral program focused on aeroponics. The Agrobiotech Research Center, led by Professor Nguyen Quang Thach, is utilizing aeroponic laboratories to advance Vietnam&#x27;s minituber potato production for certified seed potato cultivation.
This development holds significant historical importance as it marks the first time a nation has specifically prioritized aeroponics to bolster its agricultural sector, promote economic growth in farming, meet rising demands, improve food quality, and increase overall production.

&quot;We have shown that aeroponics, more than any other form of agricultural technology, will significantly improve Vietnam&#x27;s potato production. We have very little tillable land, aeroponics makes complete economic sense to us,&quot; affirmed Thach.

The integration of aeroponics in Vietnamese agriculture begins with the production of low-cost, certified disease-free organic minitubers. These minitubers then serve as a local supply for farmers engaged in field plantings of seed potatoes and commercial potatoes. The adoption of aeroponics will benefit potato farmers by providing them with disease-free seed potatoes grown without the use of pesticides. Importantly, it will also reduce their operational costs and increase their yields, according to Thach.

<doc id="1044137" wikidata="Q1775788" url="?curid=1044137" title="Wizball">
<text>Wizball is a horizontally scrolling shooter written by Jon Hare and Chris Yates (co-founders of Sensible Software) and released in 1987 for the Commodore 64 and later in the year for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Versions for the Amiga and Atari ST were released in the following year. Wizball was also ported to IBM PC compatibles (for the Color Graphics Adapter) and the Thomson MO5.

&quot;Wizball&quot;&#x27;s more humorous sequel, &quot;&quot;, was released in 1992 for the Amiga, Atari ST, and IBM PC compatibles.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Wizball&quot; is set in the once colourful realms of Wizworld, where the evil Zark has stolen all the colour, making it dull and grey. It is up to Wiz and his cat Nifta to restore it to its former brilliance as Wizball and Catellite.

&quot;Wizball&quot; is a scrolling shooter inspired by &quot;Gradius&quot; with an additional collection dynamic. It is a horizontally scrolling game taking place over eight levels, which involves navigating around a landscape and shooting at sprites. However, the aim of the game is to collect droplets of coloured paint to colour the level. Each level starts off as monochromatic, drawn in three shades of grey, and needs three colours (red, blue, and green) to be collected to complete it. The player, a wizard who has taken the form of a green ball, can navigate between the levels through portals. Initially, the wizard only has access to the first three levels, but completing levels gains access to further levels. Each level has bouncing spheres of different colours, and shooting them releases droplets, which may be collected. Each level needs a different colour to be added, which can be composed by collecting enough quantities of the correct colours. On later levels, the spheres of paint start shooting bullets, adding to the challenge.

The wizard himself cannot collect paint droplets, and is initially only capable of very limited movement. The wizard bounces up and down at a fixed rate, with the player only controlling a speed of rotation, and thus how fast it will move horizontally after touching the ground. Collecting pearls (which appear when certain types of enemies have been shot) gives the player tokens that can be used to &quot;buy&quot; enhancements, such as greater control over movement and improved firepower. It also allows the option to summon the companion known as &quot;Catellite&quot;. Catellite (ostensibly the wizard&#x27;s cat) that is also spherical in form normally follows the wizard, but it can also be moved independently by holding down the fire button whilst moving the joystick (which meanwhile renders the wizard uncontrollable). Only Catellite is capable of collecting paint droplets and the player has to use it to do so. In the two-player co-op mode, Catellite is controlled by the second player.

==Development==
The music in the Commodore 64 version was composed by Martin Galway, with input from Jon Hare and Chris Yates.

In an interview from 1987, the developers said development of &quot;Wizball&quot; was originally started before their previously launched shooter &quot;Parallax&quot;, but it was put on hold since they managed to code the parallax scrolling routine used in that game. They also said they were trying to present new concepts in a familiar way, and they wanted a company to release it that could give it &quot;a bit of hype&quot;.

In a 2006 interview with &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, Jon Hare said the idea started as a &quot;Nemesis&quot; inspired shooter and it began with the ball and the control method. The ball came first, the Wizard storyline was tagged on at the end.
He also said, &quot;&quot;Wizball&quot; was put together in a very organic way, and not really planned in the way modern games are&quot;.

==Ports==
The Commodore 64 version is the original by Sensible Software. The Atari ST and Amiga versions were ported by Peter Johnson and other versions coded by different teams. On the Commodore 64 version, enemy waves spawn in groups, with four or five on the landscape at a time, at least one of which is always colour spheres; this made the game extremely difficult, but allowed the player to preferentially hunt the spheres if they needed only a small amount of colour to complete their current combination. The Amiga and Atari ST versions spawn only one wave at a time, which makes the game easier, but requires the player to &quot;grind&quot; until a wave of colour spheres is chosen to spawn.

==Reception==

The game has been heralded as one of the best ever original games to appear on the Commodore 64. It is noted for its originality and use of the C64 hardware via graphics, sound and general presentation. The control method has also been described as innovative, initially awkward, but adding to the playability when mastered. The readers of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; in 2011 selected it as the second best game ever made for the platform:

The game was awarded a Sizzler award in the July 1987 issue of &quot;Zzap!64&quot; magazine with a rating of 96%, missing out on a &quot;Gold Medal&quot;. In November the following year, &quot;Wizball&quot; was selected by the same magazine the number one Shoot &#x27;em Up for the Commodore 64, giving it a rating of 98%. A month later, it went on to be crowned the best game ever by &quot;Zzap!64&quot;, which Jon Hare has stated is one of his proudest career moments, but at the same time that they were disappointed by the sales of the title, attributing it to the marketing of Ocean Software. In 1993, &quot;Commodore Force&quot; ranked the game at number 15 on its list of the top 100 Commodore 64 games.

In a 2002 &quot;Zzap!64&quot; tribute publication, &quot;Wizball&quot; via a community vote was ranked the second best C64 game ever with the comment &quot;How it missed a Gold Medal back in issue 27 is beyond us&quot;.
In a second &quot;Zzap!64&quot; tribute in 2005, Gary Penn, editor at the magazine at the time of the game&#x27;s publication was quoted to say:
The Spectrum and 16 bit versions generally garnered favorable reviews, with &quot;Sinclair User&quot; giving it a perfect 10 and &quot;The Games Machine&quot; awarding the Atari ST and Amiga versions 87% and 84% respectively.

==Legacy==
In 1992, Sensible Software developed a sequel &quot;Wizkid: The Story of Wizball II&quot; published by Ocean Software. Although the story in &quot;Wizkid&quot; continues directly from &quot;Wizball&quot;, the actual games are only superficially related to each other.

A fan remake for Microsoft Windows and macOS, based on the Commodore 64 version, was released in 2007.

<text>The Lomé Convention is a trade and aid agreement between the European Economic Community (EEC) and 71 African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries, first signed in February 1975 in Lomé, Togo.

== History ==
The first Lomé Convention (Lomé I), which came into force in April 1976, was designed to provide a new framework of cooperation between the then European Economic Community (EEC) and developing ACP countries, in particular former British, Dutch, Belgian and French colonies. It had two main aspects: It provided for most ACP agricultural and mineral exports to enter the EEC free of duty. Preferential access based on a quota system was agreed for products, such as sugar and beef, in competition with EEC agriculture. Secondly, the EEC committed European Unit of Account (EUA) 3 billion for aid and investment in the ACP countries.
The convention was renegotiated and renewed three times. Lomé II (January 1981 to February 1985) increased aid and investment expenditure to EUA 5.5 billion. Lomé III came into force in March 1985 (trade provisions) and May 1986 (aid), and expired in 1990; it increased commitments to EUA 8.5 billion. Lomé IV was signed in December 1989. Its trade provisions cover the ten years, 1990 to 1999. Aid and investment commitments for the first five years amounted to EUA 12 billion. In all, some 70 ACP countries are party to Lomé IV, compared with 46 signatories of Lomé I.

Lomé development aid was dispersed primarily through the European Development Fund; investment assistance was mainly channelled through the European Investment Bank. Two other important mechanisms were the Stabex and Sysmin schemes, which provided compensatory finance to ACP states for adverse fluctuations in the world prices of, respectively, key agricultural and mineral exports.

The emergence of the single European market at the end of 1992 affected ACP preferential access to EU markets. The Caribbean&#x27;s many smallholder banana farmers argued for the continuation of their preferential access to traditional markets, notably the United Kingdom. They feared that otherwise the EU would be flooded with cheap bananas from the Central American plantations, with devastating effects on several Caribbean economies. Negotiations led in 1993 to the EU agreeing to maintain the Caribbean producers&#x27; preferential access until the end of Lomé IV, pending possible negotiation on an extension.

In 1995, the United States government petitioned to the World Trade Organization to investigate whether the Lomé IV convention had violated WTO rules. Then later in 1996, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, effectively ending the cross-subsidies that had benefited ACP countries for many years. But the US remained unsatisfied and insisted that all preferential trade agreements between the EU and ACP should cease. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body established another panel to discuss the issue and concluded that agreements between the EU and ACP were indeed not compatible with WTO regulations. Finally, the EU negotiated with the US through WTO to reach an agreement.

<text>The Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR, ), in Dubna, Moscow Oblast (110 km north of Moscow), Russia, is an international research center for nuclear sciences, with 5,500 staff members including 1,200 researchers holding over 1,000 Ph.Ds from eighteen countries. Most scientists are scientists of the Russian Federation.

The institute has seven laboratories, each with its own specialisation: theoretical physics, high energy physics (particle physics), heavy ion physics, condensed matter physics, nuclear reactions, neutron physics, and information technology. The institute has a division to study radiation and radiobiological research and other ad hoc experimental physics experiments.

Principal research instruments include a nuclotron superconductive particle accelerator (particle energy: 7 GeV), three isochronous cyclotrons (120, 145, 650 MeV), a phasitron (680 MeV) and a synchrophasotron (4 GeV). The site has a neutron fast-pulse reactor (1,500MW pulse) with nineteen associated instruments receiving neutron beams.

==Founding==
The Joint Institute for Nuclear Research was established on the basis of an agreement signed on 26 March 1956, in Moscow by representatives of the governments of the eleven founding countries, with a view to combining their scientific and material potential. The USSR contributed 50 percent, the People&#x27;s Republic of China 20 percent. In February 1957, the JINR was registered by the United Nations. The institute is located in Dubna, 120 km north of Moscow.

At the time of the creation of JINR, the Institute of Nuclear Problems (INP) of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR already existed at the site of the future Dubna since the late 1940s, and it launched a program of fundamental and applied research at the synchrocyclotron. The Electrophysics Laboratory of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (EFLAN) was established, and under the guidance of Academician Vladimir Veksler, work began to create a new accelerator – a proton synchrophasotron – with a record energy of 10 GeV at that time.

By the mid-1950s, there was a worldwide consensus that nuclear science should be accessible and that only broad cooperation could ensure the progressive development of this research, as well as the peaceful use of atomic energy. Thus, in 1954, near Geneva, CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) was established. At about the same time, the countries that belonged to the socialist community decided to establish a Joint Institute for Nuclear Research on the basis of the INP and EFLAN.

The first director of the United Institute was Professor D. I. Blokhintsev, who just completed the creation of Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant the world&#x27;s first nuclear power plant in Obninsk. The first vice-directors of JINR were professors Marian Danysz (Poland) and V. Votruba (Czechoslovakia).

==Cooperation==
The JINR cooperates with many organizations. One of the main organizations with which JINR cooperates is UNESCO. Its collaboration with JINR started in 1997 in order to develop basic sciences and try to achieve sustainable development. Joint activities include training programmes and grant mechanisms for researchers in the basic science. This international scientific cooperation and knowledge sharing in key scientific fields is one of the main 2030 UNESCO goals, the achievement of Sustainable Development. 

The United Nations General Assembly and UNESCO General Conference named 2019 as The International Year of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements (IYPTE 2019). This reinforced the cooperation between these two organizations. JINR was one of the observers of European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) from 2014 till 25 March 2022.

As of 1 January 2023, 13 JINR state members are active and three suspended:
* 
* (suspended) 
* (suspended)
* 
*

Scientific collaboration with organizations including:
* CERN – since 2014, subject to restrictions detailed in the CERN Council resolutions 3671 and 3638 following the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. Collaboration to be reviewed well in advance of January 2025, the expiration date of the International Cooperation Agreement.
* UNESCO – since 1997
* BMBF, since 1991.
* INFN, since 1996.
* University of Turin, since 1999.
* EPS, since 1990.

Former members: In December 2022 the Czech Republic, Poland and Ukraine terminated their membership and Bulgaria and Slovakia suspended their participation in JINR. The Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea was one of the founding states in 1956. It has been suspended from participating in JINR since 2015.

==Structure of research==
The main fields of the institute&#x27;s research are:
* Theoretical physics
* Elementary particle physics
* Relativistic nuclear physics
* Heavy ion physics
* Low and intermediate energy physics
* Nuclear physics with neutrons
* Condensed matter physics
* Radiobiology
* Computer networking, computing and computational physics
* Educational programme

The JINR possess eight laboratories and University Centre.
==Superheavy Element Factory==
The Superheavy Element Factory (SHE factory) at the JINR, opened in 2019, is a new experimental complex dedicated to superheavy element research. Its facilities enable a tenfold increase in beam intensity; such an increase in sensitivity enables the study of reactions with lower cross sections that would otherwise be inaccessible. Sergey Dmitriev, director of the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, believes that the SHE factory will enable closer examination of nuclei near the limits of stability, as well as experiments aimed at the synthesis of elements 119 and 120.

==Scientific achievements==
More than 40 major achievements in particle physics have been made through experiments at JINR, including:
* 1957 – prediction of neutrino oscillation, published in JETP by Bruno Pontecorvo
* 1976 – element 107 (bohrium)
* 1999 – element 114 (flerovium)
* 2000 – element 116 (livermorium)
* 2002 – element 118 (oganesson)
* 2003 – element 115 (moscovium) and element 113 (nihonium)
* 2010 – synthesis of element 117 (tennessine)

==Prizes and awards==
JINR has instituted awards to honour and encourage high-level research in the fields of physics and mathematics since 1961.
* The Bogolyubov Prize for young scientists – an award for young researchers in theoretical physics.
* The Bogolyubov Prize – an international award to scientists with outstanding contribution to theoretical physics and applied mathematics.

<doc id="1044155" wikidata="Q5234646" url="?curid=1044155" title="David Hall (video artist)">
<text>David Hall (born 1937 in Leicester, died October 2014) was an English artist, whose work contributed much to establishing video as an art form.
==Life and work==

David Hall studied at Leicester College of Art and the Royal College of Art. During the 1960s he worked as a sculptor and showed his work internationally. He won first prize at the Biennale de Paris in 1965 and took part in other key shows including the seminal &quot;Primary Structures&quot; exhibition at the Jewish Museum, New York in 1966 which marked the beginning of Minimalist art.

In 1966 he was a founder of the pioneering artists&#x27; organisation Artist Placement Group, APG, along with Barbara Steveni, John Latham, Barry Flanagan, Anna Ridley, and Jeffrey Shaw among others. APG was a milestone in Conceptual Art in Britain, reinventing the means of making and disseminating art.

It was during this time he began working with film and at the beginning of the 1970s turned to video as an art medium.

His work in video and his writings in &quot;Studio International&quot; and elsewhere contributed to the establishment of this as a genre in the visual arts, and it was here he introduced the term &quot;time based media&quot;. He was curator of early shows, and influenced emerging artists as a teacher.

In 1971 he made ten &quot;Interruptions&quot; broadcast intentionally unannounced and uncredited on Scottish Television. Seven of these works were later distributed on video as &quot;TV Interruptions (7 TV Pieces)&quot;, and are acknowledged as the first artist interventions on British television and as an equally formative moment in British video art. The first multi-channel video installation shown in the UK was his &quot;60 TV Sets&quot; at the exhibition &quot;A Survey of the Avant-Garde in Britain&quot;, Gallery House, London 1972, which was expanded as &quot;101 TV Sets&quot; at &quot;The Video Show&quot;, Serpentine Gallery, London 1975 (both made in collaboration with the film artist Tony Sinden).

In 1972 he founded the audio visual workshop at Maidstone College of Art. and by 1975 had transformed this into the first time based media degree course in UK.

In 1976 he made &quot;This is a Television Receiver&quot;, transmitted by BBC television. Here David Hall revisited the theme of his classic &quot;This is a Video Monitor&quot; made in 1973. Other works by artists had been broadcast by now, but Hall set out to turn the domestic television set into a form of video sculpture through the intervention of his transmitted images.

Also In 1976 he initiated and was a founder of the artists&#x27; organisation London Video Arts in collaboration with Stuart Marshall, Stephen Partridge, Tamara Krikorian, Roger Barnard, David Critchley and others. This acted as a promotional agency, an artist-led workshop and a distribution service.

He has exhibited single screen and installation work internationally for more than forty years at many venues including Documenta Kassel, Tate Gallery London, Centre Georges Pompidou Paris, National Museum Reina Sofia Madrid, Museum of Contemporary Art Barcelona, and Museum of Modern Art Vienna.

In March and April 2012, in his solo exhibition &quot;End Piece ...&quot;, the centrepiece installation &quot;1001 TV Sets (End Piece)&quot; (1972–2012) reprised the early 1970s works, and coincided with the switch-off of analogue broadcast transmissions in the London area. The exhibition, curated by Michael Maziere, also included two other installations &quot;Progressive Recession&quot; (1974) and &quot;TV Interruptions (7 TV Pieces): The Installation&quot; (1971/2006) and was at the Ambika P3 gallery, Marylebone Road, London, UK. A report in the Independent newspaper referred to him as the &quot;Godfather of British Video Art&quot;.

Hall has sculpture, films, videotapes, installations and/or related material in the collections of the Tate Gallery London, Museum of Modern Art New York, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia Madrid, Gemeente Museum The Hague, West Australia Art Gallery Perth, Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Arts Council of England, Contemporary Arts Society, British Film Institute, Great South West Corporation Atlanta USA, Richard Feigen Gallery New York, Visual Resources Inc.

<text>Femke Halsema (; born 25 April 1966) is a Dutch politician and filmmaker serving as Mayor of Amsterdam since 2018. She is the first woman to hold the position on a non-interim basis. She previously was a member of the House of Representatives for the leftist green party, GroenLinks from 1998 to 2011, and served as the party&#x27;s parliamentary leader from 2002 to 2010.

==Early life==
===Family background===
Halsema was born in 1966 in Haarlem, the Netherlands, in a Dutch social democratic family. They moved to Enschede, a town in the east of the Netherlands, close to the German border (Twente). Her father W. Halsema was a sport teacher and director of the municipal service for physical education, sport and recreation (Dienst lichamelijke opvoeding, sport en recreatie) of Enschede. For a long time, from 1982 until 1994, her mother Olga Halsema-Fles was an alderwoman responsible for social affairs and employment for the Labour Party (PvdA) in Enschede. Her mother was also a member of the Dutch Social Insurance Advisory Board (College van Toezicht Sociale Verzekeringen).

===Religious origin===
Halsema and her mother are of Christian descent. Halsema&#x27;s mother Olga Margaretha Bertha Fles was born in 1941 in Velsen-Driehuis near harbour town IJmuiden north of Amsterdam. Olga Fles&#x27; parents Cornelis Nicolaas Fles and Truus Corbee married in 1939 in the Noorsche Kerk, Nederlands Hervormd, a Dutch Protestant church in Hilligersberg, near Rotterdam.
In a 2002 interview with the &quot;Reformatorisch Dagblad&quot; (RD), a Dutch Protestant Christian Reformed newspaper, Halsema presumed members of her maternal family to have been &quot;assimilated Jews&quot;, because two nephews of her maternal grandfather Cornelis Nicolaas Fles were named Abram and Izaak, whom she supposed had been tailors. Halsema referred to some families with the surname Fles in the region (Twente) Enschede being Jewish. But Halsema&#x27;s own family is not related to them.

Olga Halsema-Fles’ family originates from Leiden, with a few ancestors residing in Rotterdam, amongst whom Abram and Izaak Fles, her uncles. Both Abram and Izaak Fles belonged to the Nederlands Hervormde Kerk (Dutch Reformed Church). As such they were registered in the Rotterdam municipal archive. They worked as civil servants, married and died in 1961 in Rotterdam. 
Abram, Izaak and Jacob are common first names in Dutch Protestant churches, chosen from the Hebrew Bible, next to New Testament names. Abram and Izaak Fles belonged to the Nederlands Hervormde Kerk (Dutch Reformed Church), just like their father Izaak, a brother to Halsema&#x27;s great-grandfather Cornelis Fles, and their grandfather was. Halsema&#x27;s family tree in the maternal line shows, that all ancestors in this family Fles since the start of the 18th century were baptised in Leiden, a historical stronghold of Protestantism in the Netherlands. Before, in the 17th century all ancestors were baptised in Roman Catholic churches as was their first known forefather Johannes Fles (Flessinghe), born ca. 1640 in Sarbrug (Saarbrücken, Germany), who settled in Leiden, in Holland. 

Dutch historian Bart Wallet included Femke Halsema in a chapter on contemporary Dutch Jewry in an entirely revised edition (2017) of “Geschiedenis van de joden in Nederland&quot; (&quot;History of the Jews in the Netherlands&quot;). But after some genealogical research in 2020 Wallet published an article in the Dutch Jewish internet magazine &quot;Jonet&quot; &quot;Waarom Femke Halsema toch niet joods is&quot; (&quot;Why Femke Halsema is not Jewish after all&quot;), admitting his mistake, indicating he will correct this in the next edition of this book. The article was reprinted in the Dutch &quot;Nieuw Israëlitisch Weekblad&quot; (New Israelitic Weekly).

==Career==
===Career before politics===
In 1983, Halsema graduated from the Kottenpark-college in Enschede with a Havo-diploma. Between 1984 and 1985 she attended the Vrije Hogeschool (teachers program for Waldorf schools) in Driebergen. In 1985 she started training as a Dutch and history teacher in Utrecht. In 1988 she left her training without graduating. After that she worked for a year in a Utrecht café. She then started studying general social sciences at Utrecht University, specialising in criminology. During these studies she had a number of jobs related to her specialisation. Between 1991 and 1993, she was an intern at the working group &quot;police and immigrants&quot; at the Ministry of the Interior and she was a student assistant for professor Frank Bovenkerk.

After Halsema graduated in 1993, she joined the staff of the Wiardi Beckman Stichting (WBS), the research institute of the Labour Party. She was seen as a rising talent in the Labour Party. In 1995, she published the book &quot;Ontspoord. Opstellen over criminaliteit &amp; rechtshandhaving&quot; (&quot;Derailed, essays about crime and law enforcement&quot;) for the WBS. In 1996, she travelled through the United States as a fellow for the German Marshall Fund. In 1996 she became an editor for the &quot;De Helling&quot;, the magazine of the research institute of GroenLinks. In the same year, she started combining her work at the WBS with work for &quot;De Balie&quot;, a political and cultural centre in Amsterdam, where she met Kees Vendrik, who before that worked for the GroenLinks in the House of Representatives. For &quot;De Balie&quot;, she led the project Res Publica about the meaning of the Constitution of the Netherlands for the modern society. She also joined the programme committee of the Labour Party for the 1998 election. She also published the book &quot;Land in zicht: een cultuurpolitieke benadering van de Ruimtelijke Ordening&quot; (&quot;Land ho, cultural-political essays about spatial planning&quot;) with Maarten Hajer. She was asked to be a candidate for the Labour Party in the 1998 election.

In the autumn of 1997, Halsema left the Labour Party and the WBS. The direct cause was the authoritarian way in which the police had handled the protests against the European summit that was working on the Treaty of Amsterdam. The social democratic mayor Schelto Patijn had put 500 people in preventive detention. Her dissatisfaction with the course of the Labour Party had grown. In her view the party was unable to renew its social democratic manifesto and use the rising economic tide to invest in the public sector.

===Political career===
==== Member of the House of Representatives ====
In the 1998 election, Halsema was a candidate on the list of GroenLinks after being courted by Paul Rosenmöller. She was the third candidate on the list, making her the highest new candidate and practically guaranteed her a seat in the House. The seventh was her former &quot;De Balie&quot;-colleague Vendrik. GroenLinks more than doubled its seat total from five to eleven. In her first period in the House, Halsema was spokesperson justice, asylum seekers and home affairs. She became well known due to her opposition to the tougher migration law proposed by Job Cohen.

In the 2002 election, she was given the second place on the list. The party lost one seat. Halsema became vice-chair of the parliamentary party and among others spoke for the party in the first debate with the First Balkenende cabinet. In November of that year Paul Rosenmöller unexpectedly announced that he would leave politics. He asked Halsema to succeed him, and she immediately agreed. Ten days before the party congress she was announced as the only candidate for the party leadership and became top candidate for the 2003 election. The party lost another two seats. In addition to the party leadership she was spokesperson on areas of culture and media, healthcare, spatial planning and the environment. As party leader she had a more prominent position and put forth a number of private member&#x27;s bills, including one concerning judicial review and another that sets a fixed price for books (together with the leader of the Democrats 66 (D66) Boris Dittrich).
Between October 2003 and January 2004, Halsema was on maternity leave. She got twins. Marijke Vos, the vice-chair of the parliamentary party took over as party leader. After her return to the House of Representatives, Halsema started a debate about the course of the left in general and GroenLinks in particular. She claimed that her party was the last &quot;left liberal party in the Netherlands&quot;. She called for increased cooperation with the Socialist Party, the Labour Party and GroenLinks, aiming at a left-wing majority government after the 2007 election. She asked Labour Party leader Wouter Bos to speak out in favour of such a cabinet, but he refused in order to allow for a possible coalition of the Labour Party and the Christian Democratic Appeal. In January 2006, she was elected &quot;Liberal of the Year&quot; by the Youth Organisation Freedom and Democracy, the youth organisation of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), because of her new political course, in particular where it came to reforming the welfare state. In June 2006, she was the only candidate for the top spot on her party&#x27;s list. During the campaign, she published &quot;Linkse lente&quot; (&quot;Left-wing Spring&quot;), a book co-authored by Michiel Zonneveld, which blends her political vision and personal biography. In the 2006 election the party lost another seat.

In 2007, she took over the private member&#x27;s bill of Wijnand Duyvendak, who worked together with Niesco Dubbelboer of the Labour Party and Boris van der Ham of D66, to allow for a non-binding corrective referendum. In April 2010 the party congress voted against including the referendum in the party manifesto.

In the run-up to the 2010 elections, she was given the Thorbecke prize for political eloquence. and she was elected by Intermediair as the best candidate for Prime Minister.

During the 2010 election, GroenLinks went from seven to ten seats. The party, under Halsema, negotiated with the VVD, the Labour Party and D66 to reach agreement on a new &quot;Purple Plus&quot;-government, but the negotiations failed.

On 17 December 2010, Halsema announced that she would leave parliament and that Jolande Sap was elected as the new leader of GroenLinks. She formally left parliament in January 2011.

In 2016, she made public in her political memoire &quot;Pluche&quot; (&quot;Plush&quot;) that after the 2012 election she was asked to consider becoming minister of Development Cooperation by Lodewijk Asscher, the Labour Party leader, but the VVD vetoed this.

==== Mayor of Amsterdam ====
On 27 June 2018, Halsema was appointed Mayor of Amsterdam and began serving a six-year term on 12 July 2018. She is the first woman to hold the position fully as Guusje ter Horst and Kajsa Ollongren held the position previously in an ad interim manner (for 14 days in 2001 and 21 days in 2017 respectively). Also, Halsema was a first GreenLeft member to become Amsterdam&#x27;s mayor.

In the Netherlands, protests were also taking place on the Dam on 1 June 2020 for George Floyd. Halsema was criticised because of the crowd gathering and the 1.5 meter (5&#x27;) safety issue from COVID-19, it was impossible to manage the 1.5 meter rule between the protesting citizens which was a must for safety reasons. Halsema was criticised on the Dutch news by a lot of people in the medical field for not taking action and lack of responsibility. In Den Haag and Rotterdam, there were also protests but where the 1.5 meter safety measurement had been followed and the second protest became too crowded and further protests where cancelled and stopped.

On 1 July 2021, Halsema apologised for the city&#x27;s involvement in the Atlantic slave trade.

In November 2024, Halsema expressed regret over her prior labeling of the November 2024 Amsterdam riots as a &quot;pogrom&quot;. Halsema said that the term pogrom is being used as propaganda by Dutch politicians to discriminate against Moroccans and Muslims. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa&#x27;ar criticised Halsema, saying that her comment was &quot;utterly unacceptable&quot;.

===Work outside of politics===

After she left politics in January 2011, Halsema worked as freelancer.

Immediately after her political career, Halsema joined &quot;De Volkskrant&quot;, for which she wrote number of articles and columns in 2011 and 2012. In 2013, she was involved in &quot;De Correspondent&quot;, for which she also wrote articles for two years. In 2016 she wrote her political memoir &quot;Pluche&quot;. In 2017 she wrote the Essay &quot;Nergensland. Nieuw Licht op migratie&quot; (&quot;Nowhereland. A new light on migration&quot;), where she proposed a utopian alternative to the international refugee question. In 2018 she wrote the essay &quot;Macht en Verbeelding&quot; (&quot;Power and Imagination&quot;).

In 2011, she became professor by special appointment at Tilburg University occupying the Leonardo Chair for half a year. She taught at the Tilburg School of Humanities. In 2012 she became a temporary professor at University of Utrecht, occupying the Peace of Utrecht Chair. She researched the meaning of social media for human rights and democracy.

In December 2012, she led an inquiry into the behaviour of administrators at the school board of Amarantis. She succeeded Martin van Rijn, who had become junior minister of Health. The committee Halsema found that the board had acted within the law but that their behaviour was not desirable. After that she led a committee on the governance code for the semi-public sector at the request of the Minister of Economic Affairs Henk Kamp The final report of the committee concluded that a governance code would not lead to the desired culture change in the semi-public sector. The committee focused its attention on the old boys network and political cooperation. In 2015 she was asked by employees and students at the University of Amsterdam to lead the committee concerning the financial policy of the University. After a month she returned the assignment. The committee felt that elementary conditions were not met for independent, careful research. Since January 2018, Halsema at the request of the Council of the Judiciary chair of the quadrennial review committee.

Since 2011, Halsema has been President-Commissioner at WPG Uitgevers, which is among other responsible for the publisher De Bezige Bij, Vrij Nederland and Voetbal International. Since 2015 Halsema has been chair for the Trade Organisation for Healthcare for the Handicapped (VGN). Because of that office she is chair of the Executive Consultation for Healthcare (BOZ), a partnership between employers&#x27; organisations and patients&#x27; organisations in the realm of healthcare. In addition to this she has a number of functions in the public and private sector: between 2012 and 2014 she was chair of the Advisory Council of ASN Bank. Since 2015 she is a member of the board the Start Foundation, a fund for people who have &quot;distance to the labour market&quot;. And since 2016 she has been a commissioner at Independer. 
Additionally, Halsema has been a member of the executive of a number of non-profits: between 2011 and 2017 she was chair of the board of Stichting Vluchteling. Since 2017, she has been chair of the board of Aidsfonds/Stopaidsnow. She chairs the board of Adelheid Roosen&#x27;s theatre company and of IDFA.

In 2014, Halsema made the six-part documentary series &quot;Seks en de Zonde&quot; (&quot;Sex and Sin&quot;) with Hassnae Bouazza about women in the Islamic world. She interviewed activists Veena Malik and Souad al-Shammary for this. Together with Gijs van de Westelaken, she developed and produced the TV-series &quot;De Fractie&quot; (&quot;The Parliamentary Party&quot;) about politics in The Hague. Recently she has been working with her partner Robert Oey on a documentary series on terrorism. In the Spring of 2017, she made a theatre tour with her theatre-lecture &quot;Een Vrij Land&quot; (&quot;A Free Country&quot;).

==Political views==
Halsema sees herself as a left-liberal. In Dutch she prefers &quot;vrijzinnig&quot; (free-thinking) over &quot;liberaal&quot; (liberal) because the conservative liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy is seen as the pre-eminent liberal party. In 2004, she started a debate within her party about a new political course. Her new course emphasises two concepts: freedom and pragmatism.

With the concept &quot;freedom&quot;, Halsema seeks to connect herself with the &quot;freedom-loving traditions of the left&quot;. Like Isaiah Berlin, Halsema discerns two traditions of freedom: negative and positive liberty. For Halsema negative liberty is the freedom of citizens from government interference. She wants to apply this concept especially to the multicultural society and rule of law, where she seeks to reduce the influence of government. Positive liberty is, according to Halsema, the emancipation of citizens from poverty. Halsema wants to apply this concept especially to the economy, the welfare state and the environment, where the government should take more action.

With &quot;pragmatism&quot;, Halsema has contrasted her politics with those of the new populist political right, such as Pim Fortuyn. While the right, in Halsema&#x27;s eyes, had become dogmatic and tried to reform society on the basis of new principles, Halsema claimed that the left has got more feeling for the &quot;narrow margins of politics.&quot; According to Halsema, the left has emphasised equitable outcomes, as opposed to merely fair-minded principles.

This new course has been integrated into several practical proposals on the economy, which together form &quot;Vrijheid Eerlijk Delen&quot; (&quot;Sharing Liberty Fairly&quot;). These proposals have led to considerable debate. Halsema proposes that the main goal of the welfare state should be the emancipation of citizens from poverty. To ensure this, she proposes a new model for the welfare state, which is modelled on the Danish welfare state. In her perception of the welfare state, the government should endeavour to ensure full employment by cutting taxes on labour, increasing labour flexibility and creating more government jobs. If there is more work, so this theory goes, everybody can get a job, after a maximum of one year of unemployment. She also called for the implementation of a partial basic income.

==Personal life==
Halsema married the TV documentary maker Robert Oey. Oey made among others the film &quot;De Leugen&quot; (&quot;The Lie&quot;) in which Halsema participated amongst others by singing. On 20 December 2022 they announced that they had been separated for a year. Their twin children are Bruno and Suzy. Halsema resides in an official residence on Herengracht while Oey kept the house in Holysloot.

<doc id="1044169" wikidata="Q1574330" url="?curid=1044169" title="Font family (HTML)">
<text>The font family selection in (X)HTML, CSS, and derived systems specifies a list of prioritized fonts and generic family names; in conjunction with correlating font properties, this list determines the particular font face used to render characters. The family selection is available in two forms: in the deprecated (X)HTML element with its attribute, and in the CSS property.

The CSS term &quot;font family&quot; is matched with the typographical term &quot;typeface&quot;, which is a grouping of fonts defined by shared design styles. A &quot;font&quot; is a particular set of &quot;glyphs&quot; (character shapes), differentiated from other fonts in the same family by additional properties such as stroke weight, slant, relative width, etc. The CSS term &quot;font face&quot; is matched with &quot;font&quot;; it is decided by a combination of the font family and the additional properties.

In both HTML and CSS, the list is separated by commas. To avoid unexpected results, the last font family on the font list should be one of the generic families which are by default always available. In the absence of a font being found, the web browser will use its default font, which may be a user-defined one. Depending on the web browser, a user can in fact override the font defined by the code writer. This may be for personal taste reasons, but may also be because of some physical limitation of the user, such as the need for a larger font size or the avoidance of certain colors.

In addition to local fonts, modern web browsers support linking custom font files directly by using the codice_1 declaration. Once included, such fonts can be listed in the codice_2 property, alongside all local and fallback fonts.

== Examples ==

The following example defines the same font face (Times or a default serif, 14 points, italics) in three ways:
* With CSS in a separate stylesheet.
* With inline CSS applied to an element via the attribute.
* With the deprecated presentational element and its non-standard attribute . ( is not deprecated in general, but its presentational use is.)

.text { font-family: times, serif; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic; }

&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Sample text formatted with CSS in a separate stylesheet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: times, serif; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic&quot;&gt;
Sample text formatted with inline CSS.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;times, serif&quot; size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Sample text formatted with the deprecated FONT tag.
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
It is a best practice to put a space after the comma, and to put any name containing spaces between quotation marks.

== Font name as family name ==
Although CSS tries to define a font family as the same as a typeface, the entry and its non-standard HTML predecessor has also historically been used to identify the entire &quot;font face&quot;. This usage is due to font files not describing themselves as part of a family, partially motivated by the fact that few editors at the time supported the selection among more than four font styles (bold/regular and italics/regular).

As a result, it used to be common to see declarations such as in place of the pedantically correct . Neither CSS2 nor CSS3 endorse such a use (they are not found in examples), but most browsers accept them as valid &quot;names&quot; nevertheless.

== Generic fonts ==

The &quot;font-family&quot; can use a specific named font (like &quot;Heisei Mincho W9&quot;), but the result depends on the fonts installed on the user machine. The actual appearance will depend on the browser and the fonts installed on the system. A default installation of Firefox on Microsoft Windows, for instance, will display both &quot;serif&quot; as Times New Roman, and both &quot;sans-serif&quot; as Arial.

Usually only a small subset of them, chiefly the Serif, Sans-serif, Monospace and Cursive are easily configurable by user in web browsers.

Many systems also perform special-cased &quot;font substitution&quot; to replace missing &quot;well-known&quot; families with metric-compatible alternatives. For example, Windows substitutes &quot;Helvetica&quot; with Arial, and &quot;Times&quot; with Times New Roman. These families are not generic in the CSS sense, and are generally not handled at the browser level.

<doc id="1044175" wikidata="Q6860759" url="?curid=1044175" title="Milsons Point (Lavender Bay sites) railway stations">
<text>The first Lavender Bay railway station was opened on 30 May 1915 at a site 300 metres north of the original Milsons Point station on the North Shore line on the edge of Lavender Bay. The station was created by building platforms beside the existing lines. An overbridge was constructed leading to a new ferry wharf. Southbound trains used to drop their passengers at Lavender Bay station and then proceed to Milsons Point railway station to reverse.

Passengers discovered that it was easier to stay on the train until it reached Milsons Point and then alight. The walk from Milsons Point platforms was almost level because it was a terminal station. The ferry company was also unhappy about servicing two wharves. On 18 July 1915, after a mere seven weeks, the service reverted to Milsons Point station.

The second Lavender Bay Station was a redesign of the first station, and came into use on 27 April 1924. This station was necessary because a contract had been let for the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Milsons Point land was required for workshops associated with the construction. The second Lavender Bay station was a terminus as the lines to Milsons Point were actually removed. Thus it was a more passenger-friendly version of its predecessor. The electric tram terminus was also moved to Glen Street on the cliff above the station. Lifts and escalators, the first in Australia, were installed.

After the Sydney Harbour Bridge opened on 19 March 1932, North Shore line services were diverted to the new stations at North Sydney and Milsons Point and onward over the bridge into the city. Ferry services were greatly reduced and rail services ceased to Lavender Bay. The station became the &quot;North Sydney Electric Car Sidings&quot;, with the track used for storage of rolling stock between the morning and afternoon peak periods. A walking path is now provided for the public.

<doc id="1044182" wikidata="Q1537980" url="?curid=1044182" title="Gordon Bottomley">
<text>Gordon Bottomley (20 February 187425 August 1948) was an English poet, known particularly for his verse dramas. He was partly disabled by tubercular illness. His main influences were the later Victorian Romantic poets, the Pre-Raphaelites and William Morris.

==Background==

Bottomley was born in Keighley, West Riding of Yorkshire on 20 February 1874, the only child of Maria and Alfred Bottomley. He was educated firstly at home by his mother and then at the local grammar school. Aged seven, Bottomley contracted a tubercular illness that would affect him for the rest of his life. As a result, he was invalided for long periods of time and was unable to travel widely or live in a town.

Bottomley became a junior clerk at the Craven Bank in Keighley at the age of 16. However, after an illness in 1891, he was transferred to the Bradford branch. Here he first visited the theatre and saw the Oscar Wilde play &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;. This stimulated his interest in plays.

Following another bout of illness in 1892 Bottomley left the bank and moved to Cartmel, Lancashire to &quot;live a life of passionate intense meditation and contemplation&quot; and began writing poetry. It was here in 1895 that he met Emily Burton. They married in 1905. The couple lived from 1914 in Silverdale, near Carnforth until their deaths. In the 1920s he was president of the Village Drama Society. In 1944 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters at the University of Leeds. Bottomley died in 1948, outliving his wife by less than a year. Their ashes are interred at St. Fillan&#x27;s Chapel at the base of Dundurn, Perthshire.

==Influences and writing==

Bottomley began writing poetry in the 1890s and was influenced by the Romantic poets and even more so by such later figures as Rossetti and Algernon Swinburne. Bottomley included many famous writers, poets and artists as friends. While he mainly kept in contact with them through letters, he did make occasional visits to London, and also received visitors such as Arthur Ransome and Edward Thomas at his home. 

His first book &quot;The Mickle Drede and Other Verses&quot; was printed privately at Kendal in 1896, and he wrote many more poems and plays, generally performed by amateurs or in experimental theatre. Bottomley also edited the poetry of Isaac Rosenberg in 1922, whom as a correspondent he had encouraged from 1915; while his close associate the composer Edgar Bainton (1880–1956) set &quot;The Crier by Night&quot; to music.

An early environmentalist, Bottomley&#x27;s writing was always closely grounded in geographical location. A Scottish influence (echoing Yeats&#x27; Irish revival) appears in his late plays, while much of his earlier writing was rooted in Lakeland. Thus for example the ghost or bogle of Claife Heights, Windemere - the so-called Claife Crier - is used to resolve the conflict between a cruel farmers-wife and a serving maid in &quot;The Crier by Night&quot;; while one of his best-loved poems is known as &quot;Cartmel Bells&quot;:

&quot;O, Cartmel bells ring soft tonight/And Cartmel bells ring clear,
But I lie far away tonight,/Listening with my dear;

Listening in a frosty land/
Where all the bells are still...&quot;

A collection of Bottomley&#x27;s poems and plays was edited and introduced by his literary executor, Claude Colleer Abbott, in 1953.

==Art collecting==
Among the most notable of his friendships was that with the artist Paul Nash. The two men were brought together in 1910 by Nash’s love of poetry and Bottomley’s extensive knowledge of painting. Bottomley encouraged the young artist and in exchange, Nash made several designs for Bottomley’s plays that he exhibited or used as illustrations. Despite increasingly divergent tastes in art, their friendship survived and a prolific lifelong correspondence between the two men was published in 1955.

Bottomley studied the work of artists and was a dedicated collector. He bought artworks when he could afford to and his friends also gave him their art in gratitude for his support and friendship. In the 1940s Bottomley and his wife Emily gave their personal art collection of six hundred paintings, prints and drawings to the Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery in Carlisle, Cumberland. The bequest included a nationally important collection of works by the Pre-Raphaelites including pictures by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, William Morris, Arthur Hughes, Ford Madox Brown, Elizabeth Siddal and Simeon Solomon. The collection also included work from artists of other genres including those of Stanley Spencer, Samuel Palmer, Albert Moore, Frederic, Lord Leighton, Henri Fantin-Latour, Lucien Pissarro, William Nicholson, Walter Crane, Charles Conder, Jessie Marion King, William Morris&#x27;s daughter May Morris, William Rothenstein, Charles Ricketts and of course Paul Nash. About 150 of these works were displayed in a temporary exhibition at Tullie House, &quot;Pre-Raphaelites and Beyond: the Emily and Gordon Bottomley Bequest&quot;, from 7 July to 16 September 2001.

<doc id="1044190" wikidata="Q12061402" url="?curid=1044190" title="Lunt Roman Fort">
<text>The Lunt Roman Fort is the archaeological site of a Roman fort, of unknown name, in the Roman province of Britannia. It is open to the public and located in the village of Baginton on the south eastern outskirts of Coventry. The fort has now been fully excavated and partially reconstructed; the wooden gateway rebuild was led by archaeologist Margaret Rylatt, using the same tools and techniques that the military engineers of the Roman Army would have used. In 2001, Anglo Saxon artefacts dating to Sub-Roman Britain were discovered on the site.

==Location==
The site has a large steep bank just beyond the northern boundary of the fort, which descends to the River Sowe. The elevation from the top of the bank provides good views of the landscape to the north for two or three miles ()

==History==
Four periods of occupation of the fort during periods of unrest in Roman Britain have been identified by excavation. The fort was built around AD 60 to act as a supply depot and headquarters for an unknown legion during the final campaign against Boudica.

From AD 64 it was used, in the second phase, by a cohort which reduced the size of the fort, but from which the &quot;principia&quot;, &quot;praetorium&quot;, two granaries and six barrack blocks have been excavated. A number of buildings were demolished to construct a gyrus. Many horse fittings, possible stabling, an extensive metalworking area, granary and storage space suggests a cavalry unit was present at this time. This second phase lasted until AD 77/8.

The third period of AD 77/78-79 included construction of a double ditch system, a twin-portalled gateway on the south and occupation outside the defences until the fort was decommissioned.

After AD 260, perhaps during the rebel Gallic Empire, it was recommissioned as a temporary fort with ditches on a similar alignment but slightly larger than that of Period 2. This is based on the discovery of a single coin found in the post hole of a gateway at the site of the fort that dates to the reign of Gallienus (&quot;r.&quot; 260–268), but the coin could have been a casual loss long after the fort had been abandoned.

===Gyrus===
The north, south and west sides followed the usual pattern for a Roman camp of straight ditches and ramparts. However, on the eastern side the defences bulge out around a circular structure with a diameter of , enclosing an area of . The sand and gravel subsoil had been dug out to a depth of and the area surrounded with a timber stockade. 

This ring, the only known &quot;gyrus&quot; in the Roman Empire, may have been used for training horses, possibly by means of lungeing (training the horse in a circular training ground on the end of a long rein). The same training methods were used in by the United States Cavalry at the similarly circular &#x27;Bullring&#x27; in Jefferson Barracks Military Post in the 19th century. 

The gyrus was added to the fort during its second period of occupation and its construction caused significant disruption to the fort. Having the gyrus within the fort affects not just the wall which curves to accommodate the structure deviating from the Roman playing card shape pattern but also the layout of the fort which is significantly different from the standard layout. This makes the fort unique not just in Britain but also in the Roman Empire.

==Archaeology and preservation ==
The site was identified when large quantities of Roman pottery were found in the 1930s. In the 1960s, Brian Hobley, keeper of field archaeology at the Coventry Museum, commenced a long-term project to combine excavation with a study of the methods by which Roman camps were built. Archaeological excavations identified three distinct periods of occupation of the Roman military site. During the 1970s some features of the fort were reconstructed upon the original foundations: these are a section of the wall, a gateway modelled on images of Trajan&#x27;s column, one of the three granaries and the gyrus.

In 2001 a team of Canadian students unearthed a fragment of Roman Samian pottery and a Nero&#x27;s head coin dating from 65 AD. Other finds have included a ring etched with a palm leaf. This type of design symbolized victory and was worn by successful gladiators.

Evidence of Saxon settlement was unearthed in 2001 and finds evidencing mediaeval occupation include large post holes and a post-Roman ditch filled with pottery fragments.

The fort is open for public, school visits and organised tours and has hosted many holiday excavation trips.

<text>Integral Equations and Operator Theory is a journal dedicated to operator theory and its applications to engineering and other mathematical sciences. As some approaches to the study of integral equations (theoretically and numerically) constitute a subfield of operator theory, the journal also deals with the theory of integral equations and hence of differential equations. The journal consists of two sections: a main section consisting of refereed papers and a second consisting of short announcements of important results, open problems, information, etc. It has been published monthly by Springer-Verlag since 1978. The journal is also available online by subscription.

The founding editor-in-chief of the journal, in 1978, was Israel Gohberg. Its current editor-in-chief is Christiane Tretter.

<doc id="1044195" wikidata="Q3559352" url="?curid=1044195" title="Biodynamic wine">
<text>Biodynamic wines are wines made employing the pseudo-scientific methods called biodynamic both to grow the fruit and during the post-harvest processing. Biodynamic wine production uses organic farming methods (&quot;e.g.,&quot; employing compost as fertilizer and avoiding most pesticides) while also employing soil supplements prepared according to Rudolf Steiner&#x27;s formulas, following a planting calendar that depends upon astrological configurations, and treating the earth as &quot;a &quot;living and receptive&quot; organism.&quot;

==Biodynamic viticulture==
Biodynamic methods are used in viticulture (grape growing) in a variety of countries, including France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Austria, Germany, Australia, Argentina, Chile, Peru, South Africa, Canada, and the United States. In 2013, over 700 vineyards worldwide comprising more than 10,000 ha/24,710 acres were certified biodynamic. A number of very high-end, high-profile commercial growers have converted recently to biodynamic practices. According to an article in &quot;Fortune&quot;, many of the top estates in France, &quot;including Domaine Leroy in Burgundy, Château de la Roche-aux-Moines in the Loire, Maison Chapoutier in the Rhone Valley, and Domaine Zind-Humbrecht in Alsace,&quot; follow biodynamic viticulture. For a wine to be labeled “biodynamic” it has to meet standards laid down by the Demeter Association, an internationally recognized certifying body.

Biodynamic agriculture is a form of alternative agriculture based on pseudo-scientific and esoteric concepts developed by Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925), who gave &quot;Agriculture Course&quot; in 1924, predating most of the organic movement. It includes ecological principles, emphasizing spiritual and mystical perspectives. Biodynamics aims at the ecological self-sufficiency of farms as cohesive, interconnected living systems.

==Efficacy==
Some grape growers who have adopted biodynamic methods claim to have achieved improvements in the health of their vineyards, specifically in the areas of biodiversity, soil fertility, crop nutrition, and pest, weed, and disease management. For example, the late Anne-Claude Leflaive of Domaine Leflaive estate in Burgundy claimed that the use of biodynamic methods saved a badly diseased vineyard, to the point that it now produces some of her most highly prized wines. A long-term study of one California winery found that improved quality for both biodynamic and organic could not be explained. This study in different vineyard blocks at a commercial vineyard in Ukiah, California found no difference between biodynamic methods with general organic farming methods with respect to soil quality, nor in the yield per vine, clusters per vine, and cluster and berry weight. However, one of the authors, Leo McCloskey has made the case that consumer quality scores, 100-point scores, are expected to be higher for both biodynamic and organic over traditional farming.

Biodynamic grapes claim to have noted stronger, clearer, more vibrant tastes, as well as wines that remain drinkable longer. Biodynamic wines are more &quot;floral&quot;, according to Spanish biodynamic vintner Pérez Palacios. Biodynamic producers also claim that their methods tend to result in better balance in growth, where the sugar production in the grapes coincides with physiological ripeness, resulting in a wine with the correct balance of flavor and alcohol content, even with changing climate conditions.

In a blind tasting of 10 pairs of biodynamic and conventionally made wines, conducted by &quot;Fortune&quot; and judged by seven wine experts including a Master of Wine and head sommeliers, nine of the biodynamic wines were judged superior to their conventional counterpart. The biodynamic wines &quot;were found to have better expressions of &quot;terroir&quot;, the way in which a wine can represent its specific place of origin in its aroma, flavor, and texture.&quot; Critics caution that such comparisons of wines of the same type need to be controlled for differences in soil and subsoil, and the farming and processing techniques used.

Critics acknowledge the high quality of biodynamic wines, but question whether many of the improvements in vineyard health and wine taste would have happened anyway if organic farming were used, without the mysticism and increased effort involved in biodynamics. Other critics attribute the success of biodynamic viticulture to the winemakers&#x27; higher craftsmanship and meticulous attention to detail. Ray Isle, managing editor of &quot;Wine &amp; Spirit&quot; magazine, says, &quot;So what if they also think burying cow horns full of manure will help them channel new life forces from the cosmos?&quot;

<doc id="1044201" wikidata="Q832200" url="?curid=1044201" title="Cotonou Agreement">
<text>The Cotonou Agreement (French: &quot;Accord de Cotonou&quot;) is a treaty between the European Union (EU) and the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (&quot;ACP countries&quot;). It was signed in June 2000 in Cotonou, Benin&#x27;s largest city, by 78 ACP countries (Cuba did not sign) and the then fifteen EU member states. It entered into force in 2003 and was subsequently revised in 2005 and 2010.

Following the 2010 revision, the agreement was due to expire on 29 February 2020, but it was extended temporarily to no later than 31 October 2023, pending adoption of a new agreement (the Samoa Agreement).

==Aims==
The Cotonou Agreement is aimed at the reduction and eventual eradication of poverty while contributing to sustainable development and to the gradual integration of ACP countries into the world economy. The revised Cotonou Agreement is also concerned with the fight against impunity and promotion of criminal justice through the International Criminal Court.

==Main principles==
The Cotonou Agreement replaced the Lomé Convention, which had been the basis for ACP-EU development cooperation since 1975. The Cotonou Agreement, however, is much broader in scope than any previous arrangement has ever been. It is designed to last for a period of 20 years and is based on four main principles:

*Equality of partners and ownership of development strategies. In principle, it is up to ACP states to determine how their societies and their economies should develop.
*Participation. In addition to the central government as the main actor, partnership under the Cotonou Agreement is open to other actors (e.g., civil society, the private sector, and local governments).
*Dialogue and mutual obligations. The Cotonou Agreement is not merely a pot of money. The signatories have assumed mutual obligations (e.g., respect for human rights) which will be monitored through continuing dialogue and evaluation.
*Differentiation and regionalisation. Cooperation agreements will vary according to each partner&#x27;s level of development, needs, performance and long-term development strategy. Special treatment will be given to countries that are considered &quot;least developed&quot; or &quot;vulnerable&quot; (landlocked or island states).

==Political dimension==
The Cotonou Agreement wishes to give a stronger political foundation to ACP-EU development cooperation. Therefore, political dialogue is one of the key aspects of the arrangements and addresses new issues which have previously been outside the scope of development cooperation, such as peace and security, arms trade and migration.

Furthermore, the element of &quot;good governance&quot; has been included as an &quot;essential element&quot; of the Cotonou Agreement, the violation of which may lead to the partial or complete suspension of development cooperation between the EU and the country in violation. It was furthermore agreed that serious cases of corruption, including acts of bribery, could trigger a consultation process and possibly lead to a suspension of aid.

==New actors==
A second new feature of the Cotonou Agreement relates to the participation of non-state actors and local governments in development cooperation. They are now considered complementary actors to central governments who traditionally have been the key actors of cooperation between the EU and the ACP countries.

Although ACP governments continue to be responsible for determining their own development strategy, non-state actors and local authorities are now involved being consulted with regard to its formulation. They are furthermore provided with access to financial resources and involved in implementation. They also receive capacity building support. The Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU (CTA) operates within the framework of the ACP-EU Cotonou Agreement with a mission to &quot;strengthen policy and institutional capacity development and information and communication management capacities of ACP agricultural and rural development organisations&quot;. This it does, in part, through its magazine &quot;Spore&quot;, which is widely circulated in ACP states.

The Cotonou Agreement focuses especially on the private sector as an instrument for sustainable economic development. A new comprehensive programme has been introduced in Cotonou in order to support the private sectors of the ACP countries with new tools such as access to funding via the European Investment Bank (EIB).

==Trade cooperation==
Probably the most radical change introduced by the Cotonou Agreement concerns trade cooperation. Since the First Lomé Convention in 1975, the EU has granted &quot;non-reciprocal&quot; trade preferences to ACP countries. Under the Cotonou Agreement, however, this system was replaced by the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), a new scheme that took effect in 2008. This new arrangement provides for &quot;reciprocal&quot; trade agreements, meaning that not only the EU provides duty-free access to its markets for ACP exports, but ACP countries also provide duty-free access to their own markets for EU exports.

True to the Cotonou principle of differentiation, however, not all ACP countries have to open their markets to EU products after 2008. The group of least developed countries is able to either continue cooperation under the arrangements made in Lomé or the &quot;Everything But Arms&quot; regulation.

Non-LDCs, on the other hand, who decide they are not in a position to enter into EPAs can for example be transferred into the EU&#x27;s Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), or the Special Incentive Arrangement for Sustainable Development and Good Governance (GSP+).

==Programming==
The Cotonou Agreement introduces the idea of performance-based partnerships and abandons &quot;aid entitlements&quot; like fixed allocations regardless of performance.

Under the new agreement, the EU can be more selective and flexible in the way it allocated and uses its development resources. Aid allocations are based on an assessment of a country&#x27;s needs and performance and include the possibility to regularly adjust financial resources accordingly. In practice, it means that more money can be channelled to &quot;good performers&quot; and that the share of &quot;bad performers&quot; can be reduced.

Aid is allocated to ACP countries in five-year cycles under the Financial Protocol of the Cotonou Agreement. Under the ninth European Development Fund (EDF) (2002–2007) €13.5 billion was allocated to the ACP region.

The 10th EDF (2008–2013) has a significantly increased budget of €22.7 billion, with €5.6 billion earmarked to support regional programmes, especially investments in regional African infrastructure projects through the EU-Africa Partnership on Infrastructure, which was launched in October 2007 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, by the African Union Commission (AUC) and the European Commission.

Through the flexibility provided by the Cotonou Agreement, the 10th EDF enables the EU to funnel more aid money (called &quot;incentive amounts&quot;) to countries that improve their governance, especially financial, tax and legal systems. While some funds of the 10th EDF have been set aside for unforeseen needs (e.g., related to humanitarian and emergency assistance or to FLEX compensations), most are being programmed in the multi-annual framework for 2008–2013. In the first half of 2012, the programming exercise for the 11th EDF began which for geographic programmes will involve for the first time the European External Action Service as well as the European Commission. As of early 2012 most of the details of the process of programming were contained in internal documents to the European institutions yet independent analysis and a description of the process were provided by the independent foundation the European Centre for Development Policy Management (ECDPM).

==Fight against impunity==

In recognising that impunity is one of the factors that contribute to cycles of violence and insecurity, the preamble and article 11.7 of the revised Cotonou Agreement include a clear commitment of ACP and EU states to combat impunity and promote justice through the International Criminal Court. Since the International Criminal Court is based on the principle of complementarity, the 2005 revised Cotonou Agreement innovates with obligations to ensure prosecution of the most serious crimes at the national level and through global cooperation. Additionally, article 11.6 of the Agreement includes a clearcut provision that obliges States parties to:
==Revision==
In accordance with the revision clause, the Cotonou Agreement was twice subject to a revision to enhance the effectiveness and quality of the ACP-EU partnership. The first revision was concluded in Luxembourg on 25 June 2005 and the revised Agreement entered into force on 1 July 2008.

The second revision of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement was signed during the 35th meeting of the ACP-EU Council of Ministers held in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, on 22 June 2010 and entered provisionally into force on 1 November 2010.

===Samoa Agreement===
The Contonou Agreement is expected to be replaced by the Samoa Agreement. This new agreement consists of three separate protocols. These maintain European funding for the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States secretariat, while giving the EU full authority over where its development funds are issued (the agreement provides the legal basis for European Investment Bank funding outside of the EU), and is intended to ease the repatriation of undocumented migrants. The text of this new arrangement was agreed in April 2021, however its ratification on the EU side was delayed by Hungary and Poland. At a meeting in Samoa in November 2023, 44 ACP states signed the agreement.

==Criticism==
It has been argued that although the main pillar of the Cotonou Agreement is poverty reduction, aid allocated to Africa under the 9th European Development Fund has had a limited impact on the majority of the poor.

<text>The Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS, French: &quot;Organisation des États d&#x27;Afrique, des Caraïbes et du Pacifique&quot;) is a group of countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that was created by the Georgetown Agreement in 1975. Formerly known as African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP), the organisation&#x27;s main objectives are sustainable development and poverty reduction within its member states, as well as their greater integration into the world&#x27;s economy. All of the member states, except Cuba, are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement with the European Union.

The Cotonou Agreement (signed in Cotonou, Benin, in June 2000) is the successor to the Lomé Conventions. One of the major differences from the Lomé Convention is that the partnership is extended to new actors such as civil society, private sector, trade unions and local authorities. These will be involved in consultations and planning of national development strategies, provided with access to financial resources and involved in the implementation of programmes.

Many small island developing states are OACPS states; the fourth Lomé Convention was revised in 1995 in Mauritius and gives special attention to island countries in this agreement. Combined the EU and the members of the OACPS represent over 1.5 billion people and more than half of the seats at the United Nations.

== Member states ==
=== Africa ===
The African OACPS countries negotiate in five Economic Partnership Agreements groups (West Africa, Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa, Southern Africa Development Community, East African Community, Eastern and Southern Africa) with the EU.

=== Caribbean ===
All countries of the Caribbean Community plus Dominican Republic group negotiate in the CARIFORUM Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union (EU).
The Caribbean-bloc is sometimes co-represented at EU-LAC (Latin America and the Caribbean).
=== Pacific ===
All developing member states of the Pacific Islands Forum group and Timor-Leste negotiate in the Pacific EPA with the EU.
=== North Atlantic EU OCTs ===
In this region are located the EU overseas countries and territories (OCTs) of Greenland and Saint Pierre and Miquelon, but there are no OACPS states.

=== South Atlantic dependent territories ===
In this region are located the U.K. overseas territories of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha and Falkland Islands, but there are no OACPS states. Nevertheless, Saint Helena is developing links with the SADC EPA group.

=== Uninhabited territories ===
The uninhabited EU OCT does not participate in regional integration and does not receive development funding from the EU.
* French Southern and Antarctic Territories, located in the Indian Ocean
The uninhabited U.K. overseas territories are not OACPS states and do not receive development funding from the EU.
* British Indian Ocean Territory, located in the Indian Ocean
* South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, located in the South Atlantic

== Special designations ==
The Cotonou agreement recognises the specific challenges faced by less developed countries, land-locked countries, and islands in their economic development. Therefore, those countries are granted a more favourable treatment than other OACPS member countries. The text of the Cotonou agreement has been updated in 2005 and 2010, but the lists have not, despite the fact that the actual list of LDCs as defined by the United Nations has changed: Cape Verde has graduated from LDC status in December 2007, while Senegal has acquired the status in 2001 and Timor-Leste in 2003. The following lists should thus not be considered as the actual lists of OACPS LDCs and islands (a few islands are also not listed).

Annex VI of the Cotonou agreement lists the following designations:

=== Least-developed OACPS states ===
Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cape Verde, the Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Kiribati, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Samoa, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Tuvalu, Togo, Uganda, Vanuatu, Zambia.

The Least developed OCTs are the following: Anguilla, Mayotte, Montserrat, Saint Helena, Turks and Caicos Islands, Wallis and Futuna, Saint Pierre and Miquelon.

=== Landlocked OACPS states ===
Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe.

=== Island OACPS states ===
Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Cape Verde, Comoros, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Fiji, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, Kiribati, Madagascar, Mauritius, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, São Tomé and Príncipe, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, Vanuatu.

* ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly
* ACP–EU development cooperation
* European Centre for Development Policy Management
* Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU (CTA)

=== Trade and legal framework ===

<doc id="1044207" wikidata="Q576763" url="?curid=1044207" title="Face Dances">
<text>Face Dances is the ninth studio album by English rock band the Who. It was released in 1981 by Warner Bros. in the United States (the band&#x27;s first release on that label) and on Polydor in the United Kingdom. It is one of two Who studio albums with drummer Kenney Jones, who joined the band after Keith Moon&#x27;s death three years earlier.

Despite mixed reviews from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and other critics, the album peaked at No. 4 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart and No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart.

==Title==
The album was originally to be titled &quot;The Who&quot;, but the name &quot;Face Dances&quot; replaced it just before release. The phrase was inspired by a friend of Pete Townshend&#x27;s who was rhythmically moving a match between her teeth, an action that Townshend jokingly termed &quot;face dances&quot;. This incident is described in the first verse of Townshend&#x27;s song &quot;Face Dances, Pt. 2&quot;. He later realised that he had been inspired by the s in Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; series: &quot;It was only later that someone pointed out to me that in the &quot;Dune&quot; trilogy there are a group of characters called &#x27;face dancers,&#x27; sort of like chameleons; they can change completely for special purposes. That must have stuck in my head because I really loved the first one.&quot;

==Album cover==
The album cover features 16 paintings of the band members by 16 British painters, who were commissioned by Peter Blake, designer of the cover of the Beatles&#x27; album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967). Artists include Tom Phillips, Richard Hamilton, Allen Jones, David Hockney, Clive Barker, R. B. Kitaj, Howard Hodgkin, Patrick Caulfield, David Inshaw, Mike Andrews, Joe Tilson, Patrick Procktor, David Tindle and Blake himself.

Photographer Gavin Cochrane took a reference photo of each of the four members of the band (Pete Townshend, Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle and Kenney Jones) which the 16 artists used to paint on canvases the portraits of each member of the band for the front cover of &quot;Face Dances&quot;. 

R. B. Kitaj did a charcoal portrait on Ingres paper of John Entwistle. Kitaj (1932-2007) was a Jewish American from Chagrin Falls, Ohio but made his home in England for many years and was elected to the Royal Academy in 1991 – the first American to do so since John Singer Sargent in the 1890s.

David Inshaw painted a portrait of Roger Daltrey that features on the cover of &quot;Face Dances&quot;. David Inshaw was a member of the Brotherhood of Ruralists along with Peter Blake and Jann Howarth and Graham and Annie Ovenden in the 1970s. In 1973, his painting &#x27;The Badminton Game&#x27; was exhibited at the ICA Summer Exhibition and was subsequently acquired by the Tate.

Richard Hamilton did a portrait of Pete Townshend for the cover of &quot;Face Dances&quot;. Hamilton was one of the first British Pop artists, known for his painting and collage work. Hamilton was the cover designer of The Beatles&#x27; self-titled 1968 album and its poster insert, and for his painting &#x27;Swingeing London 67 (f)&#x27; which depicted Mick Jagger and art dealer Robert Fraser in handcuffs following their arrest on drug charges.

==Release==
In 1993, Polydor re-released the album on CD. It only included the songs from the original LP.

In 1997, the album was remixed, remastered and rereleased by MCA with three outtakes as well as two live tracks. The live track &quot;How Can You Do It Alone&quot; is an edited version of the live performance.

&quot;You Better You Bet&quot; was the first single released from the album; its music video was one of the first music videos aired on MTV in 1981, and was the first to be repeated on the channel. &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go the Coat&quot; was the second single to be released from the album, and it also had its own music video. While a video was shot for &quot;Another Tricky Day&quot;, the song was not released as a single commercially but it was a US Album Rock Top 10 track.

&quot;Face Dances&quot; celebrated its 40th anniversary with the release on 12 June 2021 on Record Store Day 1 of a 2-LP expanded coloured vinyl version (LP1 is blue and LP2 is yellow). Both discs have been mastered by Jon Astley at Close To The Edge and cut at half speed by Miles Showell at the Abbey Road Studios. The pressing was limited to 6500 copies. LP1 is the newly re-mastered version of the album, while LP2 has a side of studio out-takes and four live tracks from the band&#x27;s 1981 &quot;Rockpalast&quot; show which appear for the first time on vinyl.

<text>Krakout is a &quot;Breakout&quot; clone that was released for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, Thomson computers and MSX platforms in 1987. One of the wave of enhanced &quot;Breakout&quot; variants to emerge in the wake of &quot;Arkanoid&quot;, its key distinctions are that gameplay is horizontal in layout, and that it allows the player to select the acceleration characteristics of the bat before playing. It was written by Andy Green and Rob Toone and published by Gremlin Graphics. The music was composed by Ben Daglish.

==Reception==
In 1990, &quot;Dragon&quot; gave the game 4 out of 5 stars, calling it &quot;one of our favorites, this is &quot;Breakout&quot; with a different flavor&quot;.

<doc id="1044236" wikidata="Q1409160" url="?curid=1044236" title="Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome">
<text>Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), also known as feto-fetal transfusion syndrome (FFTS), twin oligohydramnios-polyhydramnios sequence (TOPS) and stuck twin syndrome, is a complication of monochorionic multiple pregnancies (the most common form of identical twin pregnancy) in which there is disproportionate blood supply between the fetuses. This leads to unequal levels of amniotic fluid between each fetus and usually leads to death of the undersupplied twin and, without treatment, usually death or a range of birth defects or disabilities for a surviving twin, such as underdeveloped, damaged or missing limbs, digits or organs (including the brain), especially cerebral palsy.

The condition occurs when the vein–artery connections within the fetuses&#x27; shared placenta allow the blood flow between each fetus to become progressively imbalanced. It usually develops between week 16 and 25 of pregnancy, during peak placental growth. The cause of the developmental effects on a surviving fetus may include necrotic embolisms from a dead fetus, low blood volume due to pooling in the dead fetus or velamentous cord insertion (insertion of the umbilical cord into the chorioamniotic membranes).

The primary treatment of TTTS is fetoscopy and laser ablation of the interconnecting blood vessels to cut off the exchange of blood between the fetuses. This treatment is associated with an 85% survival rate of at least one fetus. Other treatments include periodic removal of amniotic fluid (serial amniocentesis), which is associated with a 66% survival rate of at least one fetus. Without treatment, there is an almost 100% mortality rate of one or all fetuses. Even with treatment, the condition is associated with premature birth and a risk of cerebral palsy in a surviving fetus.

Around 5–15% of identical twin fetuses will go on to develop TTTS. The condition was first described by German obstetrician Friedrich Schatz in 1875.

==Cause==

As a result of sharing a single placenta, the blood supplies of monochorionic twin fetuses can become connected, so that they share blood circulation: although each fetus uses its own portion of the placenta, the connecting blood vessels within the placenta allow blood to pass from one twin to the other. It is thought that most monochorionic placentae have these &quot;shared connections&quot; that cross the placenta, with the net flow volumes being equal between them. This state is sometimes referred to as &quot;flow balance&quot;. When the placenta has deep veinartery connection, this can cause blood flow to become unbalanced.

Depending on the number, type and direction of the interconnecting blood vessels (anastomoses), blood can be transferred disproportionately from one twin (the &quot;donor&quot;) to the other (the &quot;recipient&quot;), due to a state of &quot;flow imbalance&quot; imparted by new blood vessel growth across the placental &quot;equator&quot;, the line that divides each baby&#x27;s proportion of the shared placenta. This state of transfusion causes the donor twin to have decreased blood volume, retarding the donor&#x27;s development and growth, and also decreased urinary output, leading to a lower than normal level of amniotic fluid (becoming oligohydramnios). The blood volume of the recipient twin is increased, which can strain the fetus&#x27;s heart and eventually lead to heart failure, and also higher than normal urinary output, which can lead to excess amniotic fluid (becoming polyhydramnios). The demise of the fetus is typically a result of ischemia related to the lack of blood flow. The lack of blood flow causes bowel atresia, brain damage, and kidney failure.

TTTS usually develops during the period of peak placental growth, starting in week 16 and proceeding through week 25; after this point, the placenta&#x27;s growth decelerates, essentially stopping just after week 30. While TTTS has occasionally been detected beyond this timepoint, it is thought that its occurrence beyond week 30 may be due to a placental embolism that upsets the flow balance of the shared connections between the babies. TTTS is potentially lethal to either or both twins, no matter when it is detected. However, when detected past week 25, emergency delivery may be considered to rescue the babies if the TTTS is severe.

Other than requiring a monochorionic twin (or higher multiple) pregnancy, the underlying causes of TTTS are not known. It is not known to be hereditary or genetic.

=== Effects to the surviving fetus ===
The fetal demise of one of the twins during the second trimester of a monochorionic pregnancy can result in serious complications to the surviving fetus. Complications include gangrenous limbs, hands and feet, cerebral palsy and IQ deficits, constriction rings of limbs and digits, reduced digits, skin defects, brain cysts, hydranencephaly, multicystic encephalomalacia, microencephaly, renal agenesis and bowel atresia. There are three hypotheses explaining these complications.

# Embolic Theory: The demise of the donor twin allows necrotic tissue, presumably thrombosis-plastin like material, to pass through the vasculature of the surviving twin via the placental vessels. The necrotic tissue embolizes the surviving twin&#x27;s mesenteric artery, resulting in bowel atresia, the renal artery, resulting in renal agenesis, or the peripheral arteries, resulting in limb ischemia and skin abnormalities.
# Ischemic Theory: The demise of the donor twin creates a low-pressure state resulting in the shunting of blood into the low-resistance vascular system of the dead fetus. This state of low pressure acutely causes hypovolemia, resulting in ischemia and poor end-organ perfusion.
# Placentation Theory: The incidence of velamentous cord insertion, an abnormal insertion of the umbilical cord into the placenta, is higher in TTTS. The exact mechanism of effect this has on fetal damage is unknown.

==Diagnosis==
===Quintero stages===
A staging system is commonly used to classify the severity of TTTS.

Stage I: A small amount of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios) is found around the donor twin and a large amount of amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) is found around the recipient twin.

Stage II: In addition to the description above, the ultrasound is not able to identify the bladder in the donor twin.

Stage III: In addition to the characteristics of Stages I and II, there is abnormal blood flow in the umbilical cords of the twins.

Stage IV: In addition to all of the above findings, the recipient twin has swelling under the skin and appears to be experiencing heart failure (fetal hydrops).

Stage V: In addition to all of the above findings, one of the twins has died. This can happen to either twin. The risk to either the donor or the recipient is roughly equal &amp; is quite high in Stage II or higher TTTS.

The Quintero staging does not provide information about prognosis, and other staging systems have been proposed.

==Treatment==
Various treatments exist for TTTS.

===Non treatment===
This is equivalent of zero intervention. It has been associated with almost 100% mortality rate of one or all fetuses. Exceptions to this include patients that are still in Stage 1 TTTS and are past 22 weeks&#x27; gestation.

===Adjustment of amniotic fluid===

====Serial amniocentesis====

This procedure involves removal of amniotic fluid periodically throughout the pregnancy under the assumption that the extra fluid in the recipient twin can cause preterm labor, perinatal mortality, or tissue damage. In the case that the fluid does not reaccumulate, the reduction of amniotic fluid stabilizes the pregnancy. Otherwise, the treatment is repeated as necessary. There is no standard procedure for how much fluid is removed each time. There is a danger that if too much fluid is removed, the recipient twin could die. This procedure is associated with a 66% survival rate of at least one fetus, with a 15% risk of cerebral palsy, and average delivery occurring at 29 weeks&#x27; gestation.

====Septostomy, or iatrogenic disruption of the dividing membrane====

This procedure involves the tearing of the dividing membrane between fetuses such that the amniotic fluid of both twins mixes, under the assumption that pressure is different in either amniotic sac and that its equilibration will ameliorate progression of the disease. It has not been proven that pressures are different in either amniotic sac. Use of this procedure can preclude use of other procedures as well as make difficult the monitoring of disease progression. In addition, tearing the dividing membrane has contributed to cord entanglement and demise of fetuses through physical complications.

===Adjustment of blood supply===

==== Laser therapy (fetoscopic laser photocoagulation) ====
This procedure involves endoscopic surgery using laser to interrupt the vessels that allow exchange of blood between fetuses under the assumption that the unequal sharing of blood through these vascular communications leads to unequal levels of amniotic fluid. Each fetus remains connected to its primary source of blood and nutrition, the placenta, through the umbilical cord. This procedure is conducted once, with the exception of all vessels not having been found. The use of endoscopic instruments allows for short recovery time. This procedure has been associated with 85% survival rate of at least one fetus, with a 6–7% risk of cerebral palsy and average delivery occurring at 32–33 weeks&#x27; gestation.

Twin anemia–polycythemia sequence (TAPS) may occur after laser surgery for TTTS (post-laser form). The spontaneous form of TAPS complicates approximately 3–5% of monochorionic twin pregnancies, whereas the post-laser form occurs in 2–13% of TTTS cases. The pathogenesis of TAPS is based on the presence of few, minuscule arterio-venous (AV) placental anastomoses (diameter &lt;1mm) allowing a slow transfusion of blood from the donor to the recipient and leading gradually to highly discordant Hb levels.

A 2014 review found that laser coagulation resulted in fewer fetal and perinatal deaths than amnioreduction and septostomy, and recommended its use for all states of TTTS.

=== Selective reduction ===
Selective termination of one of the fetuses is usually not considered until TTFS has reached either stage III or IV, and is indicated when the death of one twin is imminent, but the fetus is too premature to deliver, as the death of one twin will cause the death of the second twin due to the shared blood supply if not immediately delivered.

One procedure for selective reduction is umbilical cord occlusion. This procedure involves the ligation or otherwise occlusion of one twin&#x27;s umbilical cord to interrupt the exchange of blood between the fetuses. The procedure is typically offered in cases where one of the fetuses is presumed moribund and endangering the life or health of the other twin through resultant hypotension. Use of this treatment has decreased as TTTS is identified and treated in earlier stages and with better outcomes. When used, it is associated with an 85% survival rate of the remaining fetuses with 5% risk of cerebral palsy and a 33–39 weeks of gestation at delivery.

=== Voluntary termination ===
Some women choose to have an abortion of both fetuses as the health of both fetuses is impacted by TTFS.

==Epidemiology==

Based on recent (2005) US NCHS data, the rate of multiple births is now approximately 3.4% (4,138,349 total births, of which 139,816 were twins or higher-order multiple births). The majority of identical twins share a common (monochorionic) placenta, and of these approximately 15% go on to develop TTTS. By extrapolating the number of expected identical twins (about one-third) from annual multiple births, and the number of twins with monochorionic placentae (about two-thirds), and from these the number thought to develop TTTS (about 15%), there are at least 4,500 TTTS cases per year in the U.S. alone: 139,816 × 0.33 × 0.66 × 0.15 = 4,568 cases of TTTS per year in U.S. (involving more than 9,000 babies.) Since spontaneous pregnancy losses and terminations that occur prior to 20 weeks go uncounted by the C.D.C., this estimate of TTTS cases may be very conservative. Although infertility treatments have increased the rate of multiple birth, they have not appreciably diluted the expected incidence of identical twins. Studies show a higher rate of identical twins (up to 20 times with IVF) using these treatments versus spontaneous pregnancy rates.

One Australian study, however, noted an occurrence of only 1 in 4,170 pregnancies, or 1 in 58 twin gestations. This distinction could be partly explained by the &quot;hidden mortality&quot; associated with MC multifetal pregnancies—instances lost due to premature rupture of membrane (PROM) or intrauterine fetal demise before a thorough diagnosis of TTTS can be made.

==History==
TTTS was first described by a German obstetrician, Friedrich Schatz, in 1875. Once defined by neonatal parameters—differences in birth weight and cord hemoglobin at the time of delivery—TTTS is now defined differently. Today, it is known that discordant fetal weights will most likely be a late manifestation, and fetal hemoglobin through cordocentesis is often equivalent in the twin pair even in severe TTTS.

===In art===
A painting known as the &quot;De Wikkelkinderen&quot; (The Swaddled Children), from 1617, is thought to represent a depiction of TTTS. The drawing shows twins that appear to be identical, but one is pale, while the other is red. Analysis of the family histories of the owners of the painting suggests that the twins did not survive to adulthood, although whether that is due to TTTS is uncertain.

<doc id="1044243" wikidata="Q5002850" url="?curid=1044243" title="Butter tart">
<text>A butter tart () is a type of small pastry tart highly regarded in Canadian cuisine. The sweet tart consists of a filling of butter, sugar, syrup, and egg, baked in a pastry shell until the filling is semi-solid with a crunchy top. The butter tart should not be confused with butter pie (a savoury pie from the Preston area of Lancashire, England) or with bread and butter pudding.

Recipes for the butter tart vary according to the families baking them. Because of this, the appearance and physical characteristics of the butter tart – the firmness of its pastry, or the consistency of its filling – also vary.

Traditionally, the English Canadian tart consists of butter, sugar, and eggs in a pastry shell, similar to the French-Canadian sugar pie, or the base of the U.S. pecan pie without the nut topping. The butter tart is different from the sugar pie given the lack of flour in the filling. The butter tart is different from pecan pie in that it has a &quot;runnier&quot; filling due to the omission of corn starch. Often raisins, walnuts, or pecans are added to the traditional butter tart, although the acceptability of such additions is a matter of national debate. As an iconic Canadian food and one of the most popular desserts in the country, the raisin-or-no-raisin question can provoke polarizing debate.

More exotic flavours are also produced by some bakers. Examples such as maple, bacon, pumpkin spice, chili, and salted caramel cardamom flavours have been made for competitions.

==History==
Butter tarts became common in Canadian pioneer cooking, and they remain a characteristic pastry of Canada. It is primarily eaten in and associated with the English-speaking provinces of Canada.

The butter tart is a derivative of one or more of the following:
*Border tart: a similar pie including dried fruit from the Anglo-Scottish border country,
*Sugar pie (&quot;&quot;): which possibly came with the arrival of the &quot;King&#x27;s Daughters&quot; in Quebec during the 1600s, where the imported brides used maple syrup, butter and dried fruit to make a possible precursor to modern examples of the butter tart. The butter tart is sometimes described as a smaller, tart-sized version of the sugar pie.
*Pecan pie: which possibly came north from the southern United States,
*Backwoods pie: which is found in the Maritimes and western Canada and made with corn syrup,
*Shoofly pie: which is made with molasses and comes from the Pennsylvania Dutch community,
*Treacle tart: which is an English pastry made with golden syrup or treacle.

The earliest published Canadian recipe is from Barrie, Ontario, dating back to 1900 and can be found in The Women&#x27;s Auxiliary of the Royal Victoria Hospital Cookbook, to which a chef by the name of Mrs. Mary Ethel MacLeod submitted the recipe for a butter tart filling. The original cookbook and recipe is housed at the Simcoe County Archives. Another early publication of a butter tart recipe was found in a 1915 pie cookbook. The food was an integral part of early Canadian cuisine and often viewed as a source of pride.

Similar tarts are made in Scotland, where they are often referred to as &quot;Ecclefechan butter tarts&quot; from the town of Ecclefechan. In France, they are related to the much more common &quot;&quot;, that differs from the basic Canadian recipe only by the addition of ground almonds.

==Cultural identity==
Butter tarts are an integral part of Central Canadian cuisine and are objects of cultural pride of many communities across Ontario and other provinces in central Canada. This cultural and community connection with the tart has spawned butter tart themed tourism such as the Butter Tart festival at Muskoka Lakes, Ontario, the trademarked &quot;Butter Tart Trail&quot; at Wellington North, Ontario, and the &quot;Butter Tart Tour&quot; in Kawarthas Northumberland, Ontario. The two competing associations have since resolved their dispute, called &quot;The Butter Tart Wars&quot; by &quot;Canadian Living&quot;, through the mutual agreement to modify &quot;The Butter Tart Tour&quot; to &quot;Kawarthas Northumberland Butter Tart Tour&quot;. The first Kawarthas Northumberland Butter Tart Tour Taste-Off was launched at the Flavour Festival in Peterborough on Sunday, April 28, 2013, where four bakeries were crowned winners by a panel of celebrity judges.

Ontario&#x27;s Best Butter Tart Festival and Contest is an annual event held in Midland, Ontario. The contest portion of the festival attracts bakers from across Ontario, and is Canada&#x27;s largest butter tart–themed celebration, with over 50,000 tarts sold in the festival market in 2014.

&quot;National Geographic&quot; recognized the significance of the butter tart in an article on Georgian Bay, Ontario. In October 2013, referring to a stand in Wasaga Beach, they stated that &quot;It&#x27;s the homemade Canadian butter tarts – flaky crust with gooey pecan filling – that set this place apart from other lakeside ice cream stands.&quot;

The production of butter tarts in Canada slowed after a flood in Quebec, in April 2019, striking a major production centre. Global News reported the Vachon bakery in Sainte-Marie-de-Beauce had to be evacuated after a long-term flood. In July, Global News reported the bakery was slowly getting back to speed.

As part of the &quot;Sweet Canada&quot; series, a commemorative postage stamp was issued by Canada Post in April 2019 to celebrate the butter tart.

The Canadian alternative rock band Len referenced butter tarts on their 1999 international hit &quot;Steal My Sunshine&quot;, which confused some non Canadian listeners.

<doc id="1044247" wikidata="Q2159619" url="?curid=1044247" title="Prospect Heights, Brooklyn">
<text>Prospect Heights is a neighborhood in the northwest of the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The traditional boundaries are Flatbush Avenue to the west, Atlantic Avenue to the north, Eastern Parkway – beginning at Grand Army Plaza – to the south, and Washington Avenue to the east. In the northern section of Prospect Heights are the Vanderbilt Rail Yards, built over as part of the Pacific Park (formerly Atlantic Yards) project. The Barclays Center, home to the NBA&#x27;s Brooklyn Nets basketball team, is located in the northwestern corner of the neighborhood in Pacific Park at Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues.

Compared to other Brooklyn neighborhoods, Prospect Heights is relatively small and is notable for its cultural diversity as well as its tree-lined streets. Prospect Heights has seen rapid demographic changes over the 2000s, and its shifts are exemplified by a mixture of older buildings under reconstruction, rows of classic 1890s brownstones, and newly built luxury condominiums. The neighborhood is served by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 77th and 78th precincts.

==Boundaries and land use==

Along the southern boundary, Eastern Parkway, from Grand Army Plaza to Washington Avenue is reminiscent of Fifth Avenue&#x27;s &quot;Museum Mile&quot; in Manhattan. Immense, opulent buildings line the north side of the parkway, and the south side features the Brooklyn Public Library, Mount Prospect Park (not to be confused with Prospect Park), the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and the Brooklyn Museum. To Prospect Heights&#x27; north lies Fort Greene, to its south Prospect Park, to its west Park Slope, and to its east Crown Heights. Its portion east of Vanderbilt Avenue is under the jurisdiction of the 77th NYPD precinct; its portion west of Vanderbilt Avenue is under the jurisdiction of the 78th.

The interior portion of the neighborhood consists mostly of brownstone-style residential rowhouse buildings, some built as early as 1890, although some blocks, such as Lincoln and St. Johns Place between Underhill and Washington Avenues, include larger multi-unit apartment buildings. A number of new condominium complexes are under construction in many parts of the neighborhood. Defunct bakeries and factory spaces line Pacific Street from Vanderbilt Avenue to Carlton Avenue, and some have recently been renovated and converted into lofts; still others have recently been purchased by developer Bruce Ratner in anticipation of his Pacific Park project. Recently, a number of these have begun to be demolished. Ratner&#x27;s company Forest City Ratner has planned a controversial development on top of the neighborhood, the plans for which would include a basketball arena and luxury housing. An upscale, glass high-rise residential building designed by the architect Richard Meier and located off of Grand Army Plaza was completed in 2008.

As demand for housing within Prospect Heights increased, some residents of Crown Heights came to consider Franklin Avenue the western border with Prospect Heights rather than Washington Avenue. However, most residents continue to consider Washington Avenue the border, and Washington Avenue remains the eastern border of Prospect Heights as recognized by major New York City media such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Post&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

The name &quot;Prospect Heights&quot; can be traced as far back as 1889 to a letter to the editor published in the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle,&quot; although at that time it was one of several potential names for the neighborhood that has since come to be known as Park Slope. The letter began by noting that it was &quot;amusing to see the attempts made to fix upon a name for the rapidly growing part of Brooklyn near Prospect Park, bounded by Flatbush, Fifth and Ninth avenues, Some call it Park Slope, some Park Hill Side, some Prospect Heights and others Prospect Hill...&quot; Additionally, Prospect Heights once shared the name &quot;Gowanus Heights&quot; with Prospect Park, Greenwood and Bay Ridge.

===Controversy===

In the late 2000s and early 2010s, the neighborhood experienced controversy over a development project by developer Bruce Ratner, initially designed by the architect Frank Gehry, for the portions of Prospect Heights and Fort Greene known as Pacific Park (formerly Atlantic Yards). This included the construction of the Barclays Center, an arena to serve as a new home for the Brooklyn Nets basketball team, as well as housing and commercial space in a cluster of high-rise buildings much taller than the borough&#x27;s existing low-rise architecture. A number of community groups opposed the project, claiming abuse of the principles of eminent domain, among other concerns. Supporters of the project believed in its potential for reinvigorating an unattractive space.

== Architecture ==
The area has many Italianate and Neo-Grec rowhouses, and much of the neighborhood has been designated a New York City historic district. The Prospect Heights Historic District covers an area roughly bounded by Flatbush Avenue, Sterling Place, Washington Avenue, and St. Marks Avenue, though a section of the historic district extends as far north as Pacific Street. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The district was designated by the city Landmarks Preservation Commission on June 23, 2009, and approved by the New York City Council on September 17, 2009. It is the fifth largest historic district in New York City.

The Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, built in 1912 in Spanish Colonial style, is located at 856 Pacific Street between Vanderbilt and Underhill Avenues in Prospect Heights.

The neighborhood is also notable for its unusual street grid. The original street plan was based upon Lenape Indian paths and the boundaries of Dutch farms. As part of the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1839, this was redrawn to better match the rest of Brooklyn, resulting in several buildings that are oddly-shaped or face the street at an angle.

==Demographics==

Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Prospect Heights was 19,849, an increase of 194 (1.0%) from the 19,655 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 47.2% (9,359) White, 30.1% (5,979) African American, 0.2% (34) Native American, 6.6% (1,316) Asian, 0.1% (12) Pacific Islander, 0.5% (106) from other races, and 3.9% (768) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 11.5% (2,275) of the population.

The entirety of Community District 8, which covers Crown Heights North and Prospect Heights, had 97,130 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 79.2 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged adults and youth: 20% are between the ages of 0–17, 37% between 25–44, and 22% between 45–64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 9% and 12% respectively.

As of 2016, the median household income in Community District 8 was $60,107. In 2018, an estimated 21% of Community District 8 residents lived in poverty, compared to 21% in all of Brooklyn and 20% in all of New York City. One in eleven residents (9%) were unemployed, compared to 9% in the rest of both Brooklyn and New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 50% in Community District 8, lower than the citywide and boroughwide rates of 52% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Community District 8 is considered to be gentrifying.

==Culture==

A diverse ethnic neighborhood in the 1910s through the 1960s, combining Italian, Irish, Jewish, German, Greek and Yankee residents, Prospect Heights is currently well known for its mixed black and white culture. Every year the West Indian Day Parade, the largest annual parade in New York City, follows Eastern Parkway, beginning in Crown Heights and ending at Grand Army Plaza in Prospect Heights. During the last thirty years, the neighborhood has seen an influx of new residents, increasingly young and white, perhaps due to real estate prices slightly lower than neighboring Park Slope. A thriving commercial zone has emerged along Vanderbilt Avenue and Washington Avenue, which since 2000 has seen a surge in new bars, restaurants, and specialty shops, including a restaurant opened by Michelin-starred chef Saul Bolton, and stores emphasizing gourmet ice cream and even, for a while, artisanal mayonnaise.

== Fire safety ==
The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) operates two fire stations in Prospect Heights:

* Engine Company 280/Ladder Company 132 – 489 St Johns Place
* Engine Company 219/Ladder Company 105 – 494 Dean Street

<doc id="1044261" wikidata="Q696891" url="?curid=1044261" title="Japanese battleship Mikasa">
<text>is a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the late 1890s, and is the only ship of her class. Named after Mount Mikasa in Nara, Japan, the ship served as the flagship of Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō throughout the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, including the Battle of Port Arthur on the second day of the war and the Battles of the Yellow Sea and Tsushima. Days after the end of the war, &quot;Mikasa&quot;″s magazine accidentally exploded and sank the ship. She was salvaged and her repairs took over two years to complete. Afterwards, the ship served as a coast-defence ship during World War I and supported Japanese forces during the Siberian Intervention in the Russian Civil War.

After 1922, &quot;Mikasa&quot; was decommissioned in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty and preserved as a museum ship at Yokosuka. She was badly neglected during the post-World War II Occupation of Japan and required extensive refurbishing in the late 1950s. She has been partially restored, and is now a museum ship located at Mikasa Park in Yokosuka. &quot;Mikasa&quot; is the last surviving example of a pre-dreadnought and non-American battleship anywhere in the world and also the last surviving example of a British-built battleship.

==Background==

The combat experience of the lightly armoured &quot;Matsushima&quot;-class cruisers during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895 convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the Jeune Ecole naval philosophy, and Japan embarked on a program to modernize and expand its fleet in preparation for further confrontations. In particular, Japan promulgated a ten-year naval build-up programme, with the construction of six battleships and six armoured cruisers at its core. These ships were paid for from the £30,000,000 indemnity paid by China after losing the First Sino-Japanese War.

As with the earlier and s, Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships, and turned again to the United Kingdom for the four remaining battleships of the programme. &quot;Mikasa&quot;, the last of these ships, was ordered from the Vickers shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness in 1898 at the cost of £880,000 (8.8 million yen at that time). Although she closely resembled several of the other ships ordered in this program, she was the only ship in her class.

==Design and description==

The design of &quot;Mikasa&quot; was a modified version of the s of the Royal Navy with two additional guns. &quot;Mikasa&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . She displaced at normal load. The crew numbered about 830 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller, using steam generated by 25 Belleville boilers. The engines were rated at using forced draught, and designed to reach a top speed of although &quot;Mikasa&quot; proved to be faster during her sea trials in December 1901, reaching from . She carried a maximum of of coal which allowed her to steam for at a speed of .

&quot;Mikasa&quot;″s main battery consisted of the same four Elswick Ordnance Company 40-calibre twelve-inch guns used in all of the preceding Japanese battleships. They were mounted in twin-gun barbettes fore and aft of the superstructure which were additionally protected with armoured hoods, thus resembling true gun turrets. The hydraulically powered mountings could be loaded at all angles of traverse while the guns were loaded at a fixed angle of +13.5°. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of .

The ship&#x27;s secondary armament consisted of fourteen 40-calibre quick-firing guns mounted in casemates. Ten of these guns were positioned on the main deck and the other four guns were placed above them at the corners of the superstructure. They fired shells at a muzzle velocity of . Protection against torpedo boat attacks was provided by twenty QF 12-pounder 12 cwt guns. The 12-pounders fired , projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . Lighter guns consisted of eight three-pounder Hotchkiss guns and eight 47-millimetre 2.5-pounder Hotchkiss guns. The three-pounder gun fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of while the 2.5-pounder fired shells at a muzzle velocity of . The ship was also equipped with four submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, two on each broadside.

The waterline armour belt of &quot;Mikasa&quot; consisted of Krupp cemented armour that had a maximum thickness of over the middle of the ship. It was only thick at the ends of the ship and was surmounted by a six-inch strake of armour that ran between the barbettes. The barbettes were thick, but reduced to six inches at the level of the lower deck. The armour of the barbette hoods had a thickness of . The casemates protecting the secondary armament were thick and the deck armour was in thickness. The forward conning tower was protected by 14 inches of armour, but the aft conning tower only had four inches of armour.

&quot;Mikasa&quot;, like all the other Japanese battleships of the time, was fitted with four Barr &amp; Stroud FA3 coincidence rangefinders that had an effective range of . In addition the ships were also fitted with 24-power magnification telescopic gunsights.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Mikasa&quot;, named after Mount Mikasa, was laid down by Vickers at their Barrow-in-Furness shipyard on 24 January 1899. Baroness (later Countess) Hayashi, the wife of the then resident minister to Great Britain (later Ambassador), served as Mikasa&#x27;s sponsor, launching the hull on a rainy, but otherwise perfect ceremony on 8 November 1900. She would be completed on 1 March 1902, and after a visit to Devonport, she left Plymouth on 13 March, bound for Yokohama, under the command of Captain Hayasaki.

At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, &quot;Mikasa&quot;, commanded by Captain Hikojirō Ijichi, was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet. She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 when Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. Tōgō had expected his surprise night attack on the Russians by his destroyers to be much more successful than it actually was and expected to find them badly disorganized and weakened, but the Russians had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the cruiser which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defences. Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the Russian ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a bad idea as the Japanese and six-inch guns inflicted very little significant damage on the Russian ships who concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. Although a large number of ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered only 17 while the Japanese suffered 60 killed and wounded before Tōgō disengaged. &quot;Mikasa&quot; was hit by two ten-inch shells during the engagement that wounded seven crewmen.

The ship participated in the action of 13 April when Tōgō successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov&#x27;s flagship, the battleship . When Makarov spotted the five battleships of the 1st Division, he turned back for Port Arthur and &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot; struck a minefield laid by the Japanese the previous night. The Russian battleship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded, and Makarov was one of the 677 killed. Emboldened by his success, Tōgō resumed long-range bombardment missions, which prompted the Russians to lay more minefields which sank two Japanese battleships the following month.

During the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August, &quot;Mikasa&quot; was at the head of the column of Japanese battleships and was one of the primary targets of the Russian ships. She was hit twenty times, two of which knocked out her aft 12-inch gun turret, and suffered 125 casualties among her crew. In turn, she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships and although both ships were only lightly damaged by the Japanese shells which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact.

===Battle of Tsushima===
At the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905, &quot;Mikasa&quot; again led the 1st Fleet into combat, this time against the Second and Third Pacific Squadrons detached from the Baltic Fleet. The ship opened fire at the battleship , the Russian flagship, at 14:10, and was joined by the battleship and the armoured cruiser shortly afterwards. Within an hour the Japanese ships had started a serious fire aboard the Russian ship, badly wounded the fleet commander, Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky, knocked out her rear twelve-inch gun turret, and jammed &quot;Knyaz Suvorov&quot;″s steering so that she fell out of formation. During this time, &quot;Mikasa&quot; was the focus of the Russian fire as the leading ship in the Japanese column and was hit by 6 twelve-inch and 19 six-inch shells. They did very little damage and Tōgō was able to cross the T of the Russian squadrons. &quot;Knyaz Suvorov&quot;″s steering was later repaired, but she blundered between the Japanese and Russian fleets several times later in the battle and &quot;Mikasa&quot; fired three torpedoes at her to no avail. Later in the battle, the ship appears to have fired mostly on the battleship although fired the shots that caused the Russian ship&#x27;s magazines to explode and sink her. At 18:04, a twelve-inch shell detonated prematurely in the barrel of the right gun of the forward turret, disabling the gun and knocking out the left gun until 18:40. Another twelve-inch shell had exploded in that same barrel almost two hours earlier, but had not damaged the gun. One six-inch gun jammed after firing 19 rounds, but the only other damage to any of the ship&#x27;s guns was one six-inch gun that was disabled by a Russian shell of the same size that entered through the gun port. She fired 124 twelve-inch shells during the battle, more than any other ship except &quot;Asahi&quot;″s 142. In total, &quot;Mikasa&quot; was hit more than 40 times during the battle, including 10 twelve-inch and 22 six-inch shells, but none of them seriously damaged her. While &quot;Mikasa&quot; suffered 113 personnel casualties, the entire Japanese force combined only lost 117 men killed and 583 wounded to all causes during the battle.
Six days after the Treaty of Portsmouth that ended the war was signed, &quot;Mikasa&quot; sank at her moorings after a fire and magazine explosion at Sasebo on the night of 11/12 September 1905 that killed 251 crewmen. She was refloated on 7 August 1906, reconstructed and repaired at Sasebo Naval Arsenal. The navy took the opportunity to upgrade her existing armament with more powerful 45-calibre twelve-inch and six-inch guns during the two years it took to repair the ship. &quot;Mikasa&quot; was restored to active service on 24 August 1908. In 1912, Mikasa came extremely close to suffering another main magazine detonation, when a suicidal sailor attempted to blow her up at anchor near Kobe. During World War I, she served on coast-defence duties, based at Maizuru, during 1914–15 and was then assigned to the Second and Fifth Squadrons, in that order, for the rest of the war. The ship supported the Japanese intervention in Siberia during the Russian Civil War during 1921 and was reclassified on 1 September 1921 as a first-class coast-defence ship. On 17 September, &quot;Mikasa&quot; ran aground near Askold Island off Vladivostok, but was not seriously damaged.

===Preservation===
The ship was decommissioned on 23 September 1923 following the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and scheduled for scrapping. However, at the request of the Japanese government, each of the signatory countries to the treaty agreed that &quot;Mikasa&quot; could be preserved as a memorial ship with her hull encased in concrete. All of her engines and guns were removed. On 12 November 1926, &quot;Mikasa&quot; was opened for display in Yokosuka in the presence of Crown Prince Hirohito and Tōgō. Following the surrender of Japan in 1945, the ship deteriorated under control of the occupation forces. &quot;Mikasa&quot; had been heavily damaged by U.S. bombers during World War II and after the war American troops removed her superstructure, added a Quonset hut on her deck, and turned the remaining wreckage of &quot;Mikasa&quot; into an aquarium and &quot;Club Mikasa&quot;, a nightclub for American servicemen. When the Japanese and Americans later restored &quot;Mikasa&quot; in the 1950s they were able to retrieve some of the removed superstructure for restoration, but the majority of the new &quot;Mikasa&quot; museum ship&#x27;s superstructure was actually made up of cannibalized sections from the decommissioned Chilean dreadnought battleship &quot;Almirante Latorre&quot; and, possibly, the Argentine dreadnought battleship ARA &quot;Moreno&quot;. In 1955, American businessman John Rubin, formerly of Barrow, England, wrote a letter to the &quot;Japan Times&quot; about the state of the ship, which was the catalyst for a new restoration campaign. With the support of the Japanese public, and also Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the restored battleship reopened in 1961. On 5 August 2009, &quot;Mikasa&quot; was repainted by sailors from . &quot;Mikasa&quot; is the only surviving example of a pre-dreadnought battleship in the world, although all of the guns and turrets on &quot;Mikasa&quot; are replicas.

&quot;Mikasa&quot; is remembered in Barrow-in-Furness, the town of her construction, by Mikasa Street on Walney Island.

<text>The Socialist Students of Austria (, VSStÖ) is a socialist and social democratic student organization at Austrian universities.

== History ==
The preliminary organization of the VSStÖ was formed in 1893 in Vienna. In the beginning, it was more a student debate club that was sympathetic to young workers and the union movement. It fought for general elections in which both men and women could vote, free access to universities, and against bourgeoisie science. The resistance to nationalist and anti-semitic movements at universities led to discrimination and attacks against members of the Socialist Students and led finally to the prohibition of the VSStÖ during the Austrofascism period until the end of World War II.

After the liberation from the National Socialists by the Allied Forces in 1945, the Socialist Students were actively involved in the foundation of democratic student representation, which was established in 1946 as the Austrian National Union of Students. On the ideological basis of Marxism, the VSStÖ has subsequently fought for free and open access to universities, sufficient social funds for students, gender equality, and has taken an active role in the peace movement as well as the anti-globalisation.

== Organization and activities ==
The VSStÖ is active nationwide and has chapters in all university cities. Their members run in students union elections every two years at every university levels. In a coalition with the Greens, the VSStÖ became the president of the national Student Union in 2001 and remained in this position until 2007. Since 2007, the VSStÖ is in coalition with the Greens and varying independent groups (Fachschaftsliste or FEST).

The VSStÖ&#x27;s international activities include being a member of the Young European Socialists (YES) and International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY).

<text>The Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) is a Major Command (MAJCOM) of the United States Air Force and is also the air component command of the United States Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM). PACAF is headquartered at the Hickam AFB portion of Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam, Hawaii, and is one of two USAF MAJCOMs assigned outside the Continental United States, the other being the United States Air Forces in Europe – Air Forces Africa. Over the past sixty-five plus years, PACAF has been engaged in combat during the Korean and Vietnam Wars and Operations Desert Storm, Southern Watch, Northern Watch, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.

The mission of Pacific Air Forces is to provide ready air and space power to promote U.S. interests in the Asia-Pacific region during peacetime, through crisis, and in war. PACAF organizes, trains, and equips the 45,000 Total Force personnel of the Regular Air Force, the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard with the tools necessary to support the Commander of United States Indo-Pacific Command. PACAF comprises three numbered Air Forces, nine main bases and nearly 375 aircraft.

The command&#x27;s area of responsibility extends from the west coast of the United States to the east coast of Asia and from the Arctic to the Antarctic, more than . The area is home to nearly two billion people who live in 44 countries.

==History==

=== Far East Air Forces ===

The beginnings of PACAF can be traced back to June 1944, when Major General St. Clair Streett&#x27;s Thirteenth Air Force was added to Allied Air Forces, South West Pacific Area. At approximately the same time, Lieutenant General George Kenney created the Far East Air Forces (FEAF) from his Fifth Air Force headquarters, while the Advanced Echelon became the Fifth Air Force under Major General Ennis Whitehead, Sr.

The RAAF also formed the Australian First Tactical Air Force under Air Commodore Harry Cobby in October 1944, and when General Douglas MacArthur became commander of all Army forces in the Pacific, the Seventh Air Force was added as well.

Far East Air Forces (FEAF) was activated on 3 August 1944, at Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. FEAF (Provisional) had actually been created on 15 June 1944, and Fifth Air Force assigned to it. FEAF was subordinate to the U.S. Army Forces Far East and served as the headquarters of Allied Air Forces Southwest Pacific Area.

The creation of FEAF consolidated the command and control authority over United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) units widely deployed throughout the southwest Pacific in World War II. On 15 June 1945, Fifth Air Force, Clark Field, Luzon, Philippines; Seventh Air Force, Hickam Field, Hawaii, USA; and Thirteenth Air Force, Clark Field, Luzon, Philippines were assigned to FEAF to support combat operations in the Pacific.

With the end of World War II in September 1945, the USAAF found its units deployed throughout the Pacific, from Hawaii to India, from Japan to Australia, and based on a hundred island airstrips, along with bases in China and Burma. A realignment of these forces was needed by the USAAF to better organize its forces in the Pacific for peacetime. On 6 December 1945, Far East Air Forces was redesignated Pacific Air Command, United States Army (PACUSA), and its Air Forces were redeployed as follows:

* Fifth Air Force: Assigned to Tokyo, Japan
: Primary mission performing allied occupational assistance on the Japanese Home Islands and the Korean peninsula.
* Seventh Air Force: Assigned to Hickam Field, Hawaii
: Returning to its prewar mission for the defense of the Hawaiian Islands, including Midway Island; the Marshall Islands and other Central Pacific islands
* Eighth Air Force: Assigned to Kadena Army Air Base, Okinawa
: Defense of the Ryukyu Islands, including Iwo Jima
* Thirteenth Air Force: Assigned to Clark Field, Philippines
: Defense of the Philippines, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands
* Twentieth Air Force: Assigned to Harmon Field, Guam, Mariana Islands
: Reassigned to PACUSA 6 December 1945; provided a strategic deterrent for the entire Western Pacific region

With this realignment and reassignment of forces, PACUSA controlled and commanded all United States Army Air Forces in the Far East and Southwest Pacific, and all air forces were placed under one Air Force commander for the first time.

In November 1945, the 509th Composite Group left North Field on the island of Tinian and was reassigned to Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico, taking the atomic bomb delivery capability of PACUSA to the United States. Shortly afterwards, Eighth Air Force was reassigned to the newly established Strategic Air Command (SAC) on 7 June 1946 and its strategic units reassigned to the 1st Bombardment Division.

The major mission of PACUSA in the postwar years (1946–1950) was occupation duty in Japan and the demilitarization of the Japanese society in conjunction with the United States Army. In addition, PACUSA helped to support atomic bomb testing in the Pacific Proving Grounds beginning with the Operation Crossroads test on Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands in 1946.

With the impending establishment of the United States Air Force as an independent service later that year, PACUSA was redesignated Far East Air Forces (FEAF) on 1 January 1947. On that same date, Seventh Air Force in Hawaii was inactivated with its organization absorbed by HQ, FEAF.

====USAF established====
Coinciding with the establishment of the United States Air Force (USAF) as an independent service in September 1947, PACUSA/FEAF deployments to Korea prior to the 1948 partition of the country helped in the establishment of the Republic of Korea (e.g., South Korea), along with the transfer of surplus military equipment and other aid to French Indochina as well as aid to the Nationalist Chinese during the Chinese Civil War which resumed after the end of World War II (1945–1949).

=== Korean War ===

On 25 June 1950, the armed forces of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (e.g., North Korea) invaded South Korea. On 27 June, the United Nations Security Council voted to assist the South Koreans in resisting the invasion. President Harry Truman authorized General of the Army Douglas MacArthur (commander of the US occupying forces in Japan) to commit units to the battle. MacArthur ordered General George E. Stratemeyer, CIC of FEAF, to attack attacking North Korean forces between the front lines and the 38th parallel.

==== Order of Battle, June 1950 ====
Despite the post-World War II demobilization of United States armed forces, the United States Air Force still had substantial forces in the Pacific to oppose the North Korean military. When the North Koreans crossed the 38th parallel on 25 June 1950, FEAF consisted of the following primary units*:

* Fifth Air Force (Japan)
: Itazuke Air Base, Kyushu
:: 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing/Group (F-80, F-82)
: Johnson Air Base, Honshu
:: 3d Bombardment Wing/Group (B-26)
: Nagoya Air Base, Honshu
:: 347th Fighter All Weather Wing/Group (inactivated 24 June 1950)
: Tachikawa Air Base, Honshu
:: 374th Troop Carrier Wing/Group (C-54)
: Yokota Air Base, Honshu
:: 35th Fighter-Interceptor Wing/Group (F-80, RF-80, F-82)
: Misawa Air Base, Honshu
:: 49th Fighter-Bomber Wing/Group (F-80)
* Twentieth Air Force (Okinawa and the Marianas)
: Naha Air Base, Okinawa
:: 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing/Group (F-80, F-82)
: Kadena Air Base, Okinawa
:: 31st Photo Reconnaissance Squadron, VLR** (RB-29)
: Andersen Air Force Base, Guam
:: 19th Bombardment Wing/Group (B-29)

* Thirteenth Air Force (Philippines)
: Clark Air Force Base, Luzon
:: 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing/Group (F-80)
:: 21st Troop Carrier Squadron (C-54)
:: 6204th Photo Mapping Flight (RB-17)
At that time, the combat units of the FEAF were equipped with the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star jet fighter, the North American F-82 Twin Mustang all-weather escort fighter, the Douglas B-26 Invader light attack bomber, the Lockheed RF-80A Shooting Star tactical reconnaissance aircraft, and the Boeing B-29 Superfortress heavy bomber. Support units were equipped with the Douglas C-54 Skymaster cargo aircraft and the Boeing RB-17 Flying Fortress, a former heavy bomber converted to photo mapping duties. FEAF personnel also trained, supported and flew with the fledgling Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) under the Bout One Project, primarily operating excess World War II-vintage F-51D Mustang fighter aircraft transferred from USAF inventory, re-marked with ROKAF insignia, and operated in interdiction/ground attack and close air support roles.


In response to the threat posed by the introduction of Soviet-built (and often Soviet-manned) MiG-15 jet fighters into the Korean People&#x27;s Air Force (KPAF), USAF F-80 and F-82 units were later re-equipped with the North American F-86 Sabre jet fighter between December 1951 and Spring 1953. Eventually, these USAF F-86 units would establish a kill ratio of 10:1 versus their KPAF adversaries. During the Korean War (1950–1953), alongside the U.S. Navy and small allied contingents, FEAF&#x27;s Fifth Air Force bore the brunt of the coalition air combat operations.

=== Cold War ===

With the 1953 Korean Armistice, the deployed SAC and TAC units to Japan and Korea were gradually withdrawn, and returned to the United States. Twentieth Air Force was inactivated on 1 March 1955, leaving FEAF with two Air Forces, the Fifth in Japan and the Thirteenth in the Philippines, although units were maintained on Guam and Okinawa.

====PACAF established====

On 1 July 1954, Pacific Air Force was activated at Hickam Air Force Base, Territory of Hawaii, and assigned to Far East Air Forces (FEAF), which was headquartered in Japan. Pacific Air Force at Hickam functioned primarily as the Air Force staff component and planning element of U.S. Pacific Command. On 1 July 1956, Pacific Air Force was redesignated Pacific Air Force/FEAF (Rear). Headquarters FEAF began preparations to move from Japan to Hawaii. Smith assumed additional responsibilities as deputy commander, Far East Air Forces. This was followed on 1 July 1957 with United States Far East Air Forces being redesignated as Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) and transferring its headquarters to Hickam AFB, Territory of Hawaii.

On 1 October 1955, the Far East Air Materiel Command was transferred from Far East Air Forces to Air Force Materiel Command.

Tensions between the Communist Chinese on the mainland and the Nationalist Chinese on Taiwan dominated FEAF and PACAF during the mid and late 1950s. The 1954 and 1958 Taiwan Strait Crisis both threatened to break out into a war, and USAF F-104C fighter squadrons were deployed to Kung Kuan Air Base on Taiwan in 1958. The question of &quot;Matsu and Quemoy&quot; became an issue in the 1960 American Presidential election when Richard Nixon accused John F. Kennedy of being unwilling to commit to using nuclear weapons if the People&#x27;s Republic of China invaded the Nationalist outposts.

By 1960, PACAF maintained a combat-ready deterrent force of some 35 squadrons, operating from 10 major bases in a half-dozen countries.

=== Vietnam War ===

In the early 1960s, communist military strength and firepower in Vietnam increased. As a result, PACAF began a buildup in the area with the addition of troops and better arms and equipment.

In response to what has become known as the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964, Tactical Air Command (TAC) pilots, navigators and support personnel found themselves deployed from the CONUS to PACAF bases such as Da Nang Air Base and Phan Rang AB in South Vietnam. Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base and Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand were also used by deployed TAC fighter squadrons.

As the American effort in Southeast Asia increased, TAC permanently reassigned entire wings of aircraft from CONUS bases to PACAF and increased the number of rotated tactical fighter and reconnaissance squadrons on rotating Temporary Duty (TDY) commitments to PACAF bases in Vietnam and Thailand, along with units to South Korea, Japan and the Philippines. On a daily basis, flight crews would hurl themselves and their planes at targets across the area of operations over the skies of North and South Vietnam.

At the height of the Vietnam War (1968), PACAF commanded forces at major air bases in the following countries:

* Japan (Fifth Air Force)
* South Korea (Fifth Air Force)
* Philippines (Thirteenth Air Force)
* Taiwan (Thirteenth Air Force)
* South Vietnam (Seventh Air Force)
* Thailand (Seventh/Thirteenth Air Force)

In 1962, PACAF activated the 2d Air Division to be the main warfighting organization in South Vietnam. As the conflict escalated, Seventh Air Force was activated on 1 April 1966, replacing 2d Air Force. PACAF units in Thailand were under the command of Thirteenth Air Force beginning in 1964, then in 1973 a joint Seventh/Thirteenth Air Force headquarters was established in Bangkok to direct PACAF forces in Thailand operating in Indochina (until 15 August 1973), and Thailand until the final USAF withdrawal from Southeast Asia in the beginning of 1976.


By 1970, direct PACAF involvement the war was winding down as the conflict was being increasingly turned over to the South Vietnamese under the process known as Vietnamization. Units from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) took on more and more combat to defend their nation while PACAF tactical air strength was being reduced as several air bases were turned over to the VNAF. Combat aircraft of PACAF flew their last strikes in Cambodia 15 August 1973, writing the final chapter to the long and costly history of active American participation in the Indochina War. The Paris Peace Accords of 1973 ended PACAF&#x27;s use of South Vietnamese bases, and by 1976 bases in Thailand were turned over to the Thai government. In 1979, normalization of relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China also led to the withdrawal of PACAF personnel from Ching Chuan Kang Air Base, Republic of China (Taiwan).

==== Post Cold War ====

The post-Vietnam era found the command focusing on improving its readiness and PACAF&#x27;s organizational structure saw a marked period of rapid and extensive changes. Inactivated at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, Seventh Air Force was reactivated at Osan Air Base, South Korea in 1986 to take over Fifth Air Force activities in South Korea. Also in 1986, the Goldwater-Nichols Act reworked the overall command structure of the United States military. With the creation of Unified Combatant Commands (UCC) organized either on a geographical basis (known as &quot;Area of Responsibility&quot;, AOR) or on a functional basis, Pacific Air Forces became a part of the United States Pacific Command (USPACOM).

Andersen AFB in Guam was reassigned from Strategic Air Command (SAC) to PACAF in 1989, and Eleventh Air Force became a part of the command in late 1990. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, civil unrest in the Philippines and negotiations with the extant government of the Republic of the Philippines for the lease of Clark Air Base, along with other U.S. military installations in the Philippines, had reached an impasse. However, following the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo, the resultant damage to Clark AB, and with a post-Cold War desire by the U.S. Government to reduce defense spending, Clark AB was closed and Thirteenth Air Force relocated in 1991.

In 1992, changes took place in force structure within PACAF as the command assumed control of theater-based tactical airlift wings, theater C-130 aircraft and crews, and associated theater C-130 support following the disestablishment of Military Airlift Command (MAC). PACAF also gained control of all operational support aircraft and all aeromedical airlift assets in the Pacific previously under the cognizance of MAC. With the concurrent disestablishment of Strategic Air Command (SAC) and Tactical Air Command (TAC) the same year, PACAF also assumed responsibility for all active KC-135 aerial refueling aircraft based in Hawaii and Japan, &quot;gaining command&quot; responsibility for all Air National Guard KC-135 aircraft in Hawaii and Alaska, and all E-3 AWACS aircraft in Japan and Alaska.

Throughout its history PACAF has played a vital role in world events. In addition to its key combat role in World War II, Korea and Vietnam, PACAF units fought in Desert Storm in 1991 and continued to deploy to Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Italy for peacekeeping operations such as Operation Southern Watch and Operation Northern Watch. PACAF provided its expertise, aircraft, personnel and equipment to facilitate the new Expeditionary Air Force, especially as it applied to successful airbridge operations spanning the vast Pacific Ocean. Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, PACAF again demonstrated its intrepid spirit through its units deployed in support of Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Enduring Freedom and, in 2003, Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Since 1944, the command has also participated in more than 140 humanitarian operations within its area of responsibility and beyond. In these operations PACAF people quickly and efficiently airlifted food, medicine and other supplies to areas devastated by storms, floods, earthquakes, volcanoes and other natural disasters.

As PACAF entered the second decade of the 21st century, expanding theatre challenges and simultaneous resource constraints have forced continuing innovation and adjustments by PACAF in order to meet mission requirements. Previously assigned four numbered air forces, PACAF downscoped to three numbered air forces in September 2012, inactivating 13th Air Force and merging its functions into PACAF. Base consolidations and infrastructure limitations have also required the Air Force and PACAF to developed increased capability while striving to remain within budgetary resource constraints. One such example has been the evaluation of alternate runway(s)/divert field(s) in the Marianas since late 2011 as a backup to Andersen AFB on Guam, a process that remains on-going as of 2014. In 2023, The first Royal Australian Air Force Deputy Commander took up position alongside the USAF Command Chain.

<doc id="1044265" wikidata="Q5157180" url="?curid=1044265" title="Compton Wynyates">
<text>Compton Wynyates is a Tudor country house in Warwickshire, England, a Grade I listed building. The Tudor period house is constructed of red brick and built around a central courtyard. It is castellated and turreted in parts. Following action in the Civil War, half-timbered gables were added to replace damaged parts of the building. 

The Compton family, who still live today in this private house, appear in records as resident on the site as early as 1204. The family continued to live in the manor house as knights and squires of the county until Sir Edmund Compton (who died ) decided, , to build a new family home.

== Edmund Compton&#x27;s house ==
Edmund Compton constructed the house of bricks that have a glowing raspberry colour of striking intensity. Edmund&#x27;s four-winged house around a central courtyard is recognisable by the thickness of the 4 ft deep walls that form the core of the existing mansion. This new fortified house was fully moated, and parts of the moat form a pond in the garden today. There was also a second moat (probably dry) and second drawbridge. However fortifications were not the only consideration for the new mansion—dark brick diapering and decorative mouldings add variety to the façade. Over the entrance the Royal Arms of England are supported by the dragon and greyhound of Henry VII and Henry VIII. The architect or mason builder is unknown.

== William Compton&#x27;s house ==

Edmund died young and as a consequence his son William Compton became a ward of the Crown, as was the custom. At the court of Henry VII the eleven-year-old orphaned William Compton became a page to the two-year-old Prince Henry and thus began a close friendship, which continued after the prince succeeded as Henry VIII. As a result of this lifelong friendship, Henry VIII gave William, who was also to become a military hero, many rewards, amongst them the ruinous Fulbroke Castle. Numerous fittings at Fulbroke were brought to embellish Compton Wynyates, including the huge bay window full of heraldic glass, which looks into the courtyard from the great hall; also from the castle came many of the mullioned windows with vine-patterned ornamentation.

It was at this time () that the great entrance porch, chapel and many of the towers were built. In fact this was the start of the many additions over the next ten years that were made to the house with no thought to symmetry, height or regularity. The house was simply extended wherever space within the confines of the moat permitted. The brick fluted and twisted chimneys also date from this time and are one of the house&#x27;s most notable features.

Unlike many other houses of the period, Compton Wynyates has not been greatly altered over the centuries. This is because in 1574 its owner Henry Compton, 1st Baron Compton, began work on one of Britain&#x27;s finest houses, Castle Ashby. The Comptons continued to lavish money on this new mansion for the next century or so, as a consequence of which Compton Wynyates has survived almost intact as the perfect Tudor mansion, spared the constant improvements of successive generations.
== Royal visits ==
The Comptons, as loyal and rich subjects of the Crown, frequently played host to the reigning sovereign of their time. The frequency with which they entertained state visitors was a barometer of their wealth, and this was an era in which a one-day visit from the monarch could, and frequently did, bankrupt the host.

King Henry VIII stayed many times at Compton Wynyates, and his bedroom window still retains the king&#x27;s arms in stained glass combined with the arms of Aragon, the home country of his first Queen. Much later, in 1572, Elizabeth I stayed in the house. In 1617 James I spent a night at the house; he had been a frequent guest on previous occasions at Castle Ashby. In 1629 King Charles I, who himself stayed at the house, created Lord Compton Earl of Northampton. The ceiling of the royal bedroom is decorated with the monograms of all the monarchs who have slept here.

An anecdote from the time of the Civil War is that the Cromwellian commander of the house took such a liking to the gilded bed of state, slept in by so many monarchs, that he sequestered it for himself. After the restoration of the monarchy, the 3rd Earl recovered the bed, and it too was restored to its rightful place. Later, when the family fell upon hard times in 1744, this historic bed was sold for £10 and has never since been traced.

== Civil War ==
Spencer, 2nd Earl of Northampton, a godson of Elizabeth I, was a close friend of Charles I, and the Comptons had strong Royalist ties during the civil war. At the battle of Edgehill, six miles from the house, Spencer and three of his sons fought for the King; the three sons were all knighted for their valour on the battlefield.

The 2nd Earl was killed at the Battle of Hopton Heath in 1643 fighting for his cause, and in the same battle his son and successor, James 3rd Earl of Northampton, was wounded, leaving the family vulnerable. On 12 June 1644, Compton Wynyates was besieged by the Cromwellians, and it fell two days later. The Parliamentarians were recorded as having taken 120 prisoners, £5000 (equivalent to £720,000 in 2008), 60 horses, 400 sheep, 160 head of cattle, 18 loads of plunder (the furnishings of the mansion) and six earthen pots of coins recovered from the moat. The house and the adjacent church still bear the scars of the cannon today.

There is a legend that the widow of the 2nd Earl remained hidden in the attics of the vast house tending to Royalist wounded, undetected by the Cromwellians, until their escape was possible. As the house is a warren of small staircases, passages, and almost concealed rooms – one tower room, the Priest&#x27;s Room, has three staircases hidden behind its panelling – this story is possible.

During the night of 29 January 1645, the Comptons made an abortive attempt to recapture their home, but were repelled after four hours fighting. The Compton family fled into exile abroad and did not return until the restoration of the monarchy.

== Neglect ==

Following the restoration of the monarchy, the Comptons too were restored to their estates. As Compton Wynyates was now the minor family house, it tended to be the country home of the heir. Minor alterations were made but usually in sympathy with its Tudor origins. The 5th Earl of Northampton added a wing between two towers on the east side of the house in the classical style, which was not in keeping at all. By this time, though, the family fortunes were running low and, as a result, Compton Wynyates began to suffer neglect. In 1768 the Comptons found themselves in such that the entire contents of the house were sold, never to be recovered. The then Lord Northampton, living at Castle Ashby, ordered Compton Wynyates to be demolished. However the family&#x27;s land-agent ignored the order and merely had the windows bricked up (to avoid the window tax). So the house remained largely forgotten.

== Restoration ==
In 1835, the 2nd Marquess of Northampton (the family had been elevated from Earls in 1812) visited Compton Wynyates for the first time and found the house in a ruinous state; he made some minor renovations to prevent complete dereliction. He also employed the architect Sir Digby Wyatt to gothicise the out-of-keeping east front and create a new staircase in the house. This work was a success, and the east front harmonises with the earlier facades of the house.

It was the 4th Marquess who had the house fully restored and presented it to his son, the future 5th Marquess, on his marriage in 1884. The 5th Marquess and Marchioness were the first people to reside in the house since 1770. It was this couple who laid out the topiary gardens and made the mansion the comfortable house it is today.

Wynates is the birthplace and burial place of Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington, considered to be the second Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

== Today ==
The house today remains essentially the mansion that Edmund Compton and his son William completed within a thirty-year period during the reigns of the first two Tudor monarchs.

The 6th Marquess of Northampton (1885–1978) cared greatly for the house and spent a few months each year at Compton Wynyates. It was he who installed the electricity and water supplies; however his principal home always remained Castle Ashby. For a short time the panelled rooms of Compton Wynyates were open to the public: the chapel overlooked by the chapel drawing room, the King&#x27;s bedroom, the heavily panelled drawing and dining rooms with their moulded plaster ceilings, and works of art, such as the crucifixion by Matteo Balducci, were on limited public display.

On the succession of Spencer, 7th Marquess of Northampton, it was decided that in order for the family to survive the 20th century, Castle Ashby would have to be heavily commercialised. This was achieved and the Marquess and his family returned to make Compton Wynyates their sole country house. However, in the 21st century Castle Ashby was closed to the public (except for occasional weddings), and both houses are now lived in by the family once again.

In 1914 Compton Wynyates served as the inspiration for noted American architect John Russell Pope&#x27;s design of Branch House in Richmond, Virginia, which was built for the financier John Kerr Branch and his wife.

A dead-end public footpath runs from the village of Upper Tysoe about a mile away, ending at a tall locked gate a few yards short of the estate church, where walkers are instructed to return the way they came. There is no access to the public road a short distance further on.

== Cultural references ==
Compton Wynyates has occasionally been used as a filming location, including: &quot;The Black Tent&quot; (1955); &quot;Carry On Camping&quot; (1969), (Coincidentally these establishing shots are said to have come from the earlier &quot;Black Tent&quot; footage); &quot;Candleshoe&quot; (1977); &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1978); the 1980s television show &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;; &quot;An Instance of the Fingerpost&quot; (1998); &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d&quot; (1980); a 1995 episode of &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; and the television series &quot;The Tudors&quot;. The house was the inspiration for Croft Manor in the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; series. The Cinema Museum in London holds film of the house from 1938 (Ref HM00083).

<doc id="1044268" wikidata="Q7573645" url="?curid=1044268" title="Spark spread">
<text>The spark spread is the theoretical gross margin of a gas-fired power plant from selling a unit of electricity, having bought the fuel required to produce this unit of electricity. All other costs (operation and maintenance, capital and other financial costs) must be covered from the spark spread. The term was first coined by Tony West&#x27;s trading team on the trading floor of National Power Ltd in Swindon, UK during the late 1990s and quickly came into common usage as other traders realised the trading and hedging opportunities.

The terms dark spread, quark spread and bark spread refer to the similarly defined differences (&quot;spreads&quot;) between cash streams for coal-fired power plants, nuclear power plants and bio-mass power plants, respectively. These indicators of power plant economics are useful for trading energy markets. For operating or investment decisions published &quot;spread&quot; data are not applicable. Local market conditions, actual plant efficiencies and other plant costs have to be considered. A higher dark spread is more economically beneficial to the owner of the generator; an IPP with a dark spread of €15/MWh will be more profitable than a competitor with a dark spread of only €10/MWh.

Further definition of clean spread indicators include the price of carbon dioxide emission allowances (see: Emission trading).

==Definition of spark spread==
Conceptually, the spark spread (SS in megawatt-hours) equals:

* Electricity total value minus fuel total cost, divided by 
* the megawatt-hours of electricity delivered, equals
* spark spread in $/Mwh

A more refined version of this calculation may be: 
: formula_1

: with 
: pE as price of electricity in MU/MWh 
: pG as price of natural gas in MU/MWh or MU/Btu 
: ηel as electrical efficiency resp.
: HR as heat rate in Btu/MWh

While the above equations may be sufficient for a single power plant or electricity provider, more detailed calculations may needed depending on the analysis being performed. If the data is sourced from futures contracts for fuels and over-the-counter contracts for electricity, further calculations must be made to determine the appropriate hedge ratio of electricity to fuel. 

A precise definition of a spark spread has to be given by the source publishing such indicators. Definitions should specify energy (electricity and fuel) prices considered (delivery point &amp; conditions) and the plant efficiency used for the calculation. Also, any plant operating costs that may be included should be stated. Typically, an efficiency of 50 % is considered for gas-fired plants, and 36% for coal-fired plants.

In the UK, a non-rounded efficiency of 49.13% is used for calculating the gas conversion. In reality, each gas-fired plant has a different fuel efficiency, but 49.13% is used as a standard in the UK market because it provides an easy conversion between gas and power volumes. The spark spread value is therefore the power price minus the gas cost divided by 0.4913, i.e. Spark Spread = Power Price – (Gas cost/0.4913). As of August 2006, UK dark spreads were in the range of 10–30 £/MWh, while UK spark spreads were in the range of 4–9 £/MWh.

It is well-known that these values substantially understate the actual efficiency of modern plants. Best-in-class efficiencies (as of 2019) are near 64%, and commercial development is rapid.

==Clean spread==

In countries that are covered by the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, generators have to consider also the cost of carbon dioxide emission allowances that will be under a cap and trade regime. Emission trading has started in the EU in January 2005.

The Clean Spark Spread is calculated using a gas emissions intensity factor of 0.411 tCO2/MWh. Therefore, the clean spark spread is
calculated by subtracting the carbon price per tonne (multiplied by 0.411) from the ‘dirty’ spark spread, i.e. Clean Spark Spread = Spark Spread
– (Carbon Price*0.411).

Clean spark spread or &quot;spark green spread&quot; represents the net revenue a generator makes from selling power, having bought gas and the required number of carbon allowances. This spread is calculated by adjusting the cost of natural gas for the efficiency of the generation and subsequently applying the market cost of procuring or opportunity cost of setting aside an emissions allowance such as a European Union Allowance (EUA) in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS).

Let S: spark spread, E: electricity price, G: gas cost, Ng: number of carbon credits necessary to cover gas operation, Pcc: price of a carbon credit.

Then the Clean spark spread is defined as

: formula_2
Clean dark spread or &quot;dark green spread&quot; refers to an analogous indicator for coal-fired generation of electricity. The spark green spread and the dark green spread are especially important in areas where coal-fired electricity generation is prevalent as the convergence of the spreads will lead to an important decision point.

Let D: dark spread, E: electricity price, C: coal cost, Nc: number of carbon credits necessary to cover coal operation (2–2.5x that of gas), Pcc: price of a carbon credit.

Then, Clean dark spread = E - C - Nc*Pcc = D - Nc*Pcc

Climate spread: The difference between the dark green spread and the spark green spread is known as the &quot;Climate Spread&quot;.

Climate spread = Clean dark spread - Clean spark spread = (D - Nc*Pcc) - (S - Ng*Pcc) = (D - S) - (Nc - Ng)*Pcc.

Note: (D - S) and (Nc - Ng) are positive numbers.

In a carbon constrained economy a power producer in a geographic area where coal is currently the preferred method by which electricity is generated may eventually encounter a negative climate spread if carbon credit prices rise. This would mean that when taking into consideration the cost to produce plus the cost of compliance with a cap and trade (coal is on average 2.5 times as polluting as natural gas for the same output of electricity), natural gas would be a better decision. This would begin to cause more internal abatement via power generation fuel switching and less reliance on flexible mechanisms. This is important due to concerns regarding supplementarity.

Climate spread is also interesting in that it is the fundamental driver for the price of carbon credits. Since the ETS cap-and-trade system covers the major polluting industries, power generation by coal- and gas-fired power plants, by far the largest power sources, create the most carbon credit demand within the ETS. To cover emissions on an ever-tightening ration of free EUA allowances, a coal-fired powered power plant will either have to abate internally or buy credits. If the price of marginal internal abatement is lower than the price of carbon credits, the firm will choose internal abatement. However marginal abatement becomes more and more expensive, at some point forcing the plant to buy credits – thus the carbon credit price is equal to the marginal cost of abatement to the extent that European power plants have chosen to abate.

Clean Dark Spreads are a reflection of the cost of generating power from coal after taking into account fuel (coal) and carbon allowance costs. A positive spread effectively means that it is profitable to generate electricity on a Baseload basis for the period in question, while a negative spread means that generation would be a loss-making activity. The Clean Spark Spreads do not take into account additional generating charges (beyond fuel and carbon), such as operational costs.

Both the UK and German Dark Spread tables use a fuel efficiency factor of 35% for the coal conversion, and an energy conversion factor of 7.1 for converting tonnes/coal into MWh/electricity. In reality, each type of coal has a different energy value and each coal-fired plant has a different fuel efficiency, but 35% is accepted as a broad standard. At the time of writing (March 2007) there is no liquid Dark Spread traded market in either the UK or Germany. The Dark Spread value is the power price minus the coal price divided by 0.35, i.e. Dark Spread = Power price – (Coal price/0.35).

The Clean Dark Spread is calculated using a coal emissions intensity factor of 0.971 tCO2/MWh. Therefore, the Clean Dark Spread is calculated by subtracting the carbon price (multiplied by 0.971) from the ‘dirty’ spark spread, i.e. Clean Dark Spread = Dark Spread – (Carbon Price*0.971).

===Spark spread as cost of replacement power for intermittent renewables===
Spark spread can be used to assess the loss of revenue if a power station is switched from a normal running scenario to one where it is held in reserve to provide power when a large population of wind, or other renewable generators, is unable to generate.

In theory, the power station operator would be indifferent to such non-running as long as he was paid the spread it would have earned during the normally expected number of hour run. In fact, if paid the expected spark spread for the hours it had expected to run in normal operating mode, the operator would be better off, because it would not incur the variable operating and maintenance costs (O&amp;M costs), which are proportional to the electrical energy produced.

An assessment of the lost revenues is needed if some power plants, such as wind turbines, have absolute priority (must-run plants). A dispatching authority will in this case order the other plants to decrease power. In some countries plant operators are entitled to receive compensation for such interventions. In a competitive electricity market the situation can be handled by a balancing mechanism, in which any imbalance from the schedule (typically a day-ahead schedule) is penalized, either using the price from a balancing market or a calculated price.
Thus, since UK spark spreads were in the range of 4–9 £/MWh – on average £6.5/MWh, or 0.65 p/kWh, we can assess the likely cost of relegating existing power stations to a standby role for a large penetration of renewables as being around 0.65 p/kWh.

<text>The River Dodder () is one of the three main rivers in Dublin, Ireland, the others being the Liffey, of which the Dodder is the largest tributary, and the Tolka.

==Course and system==
The Dodder rises on the northern slopes of Kippure in the Wicklow Mountains and is formed from several streams. The headwaters flow from Kippure Ridge, and include, and are often mapped solely as, Tromanallison (Allison&#x27;s Brook), which is then joined by Mareen&#x27;s Brook, including the Cataract of the Brown Rowan, and then the combined flow meeting the Cot and Slade Brooks.

In the river&#x27;s valley at Glenasmole are the two Bohernabreena Reservoirs, a major part of the Dublin water supply system.

The Dodder is long. It passes the Dublin suburbs of Tallaght and then Firhouse, travels by Templeogue, passes Rathfarnham, Rathgar, Milltown, Clonskeagh, and Donnybrook, and goes through Ballsbridge and past Sandymount, before entering the Liffey near Ringsend, along with the Grand Canal, at Grand Canal Dock.
There is a weir just above the bridge at Ballsbridge and the river becomes tidal roughly where the bridge at Lansdowne Road crosses it. The Dodder and the River Tolka are Dublin&#x27;s second-largest rivers, after the Liffey.

===Tributaries===
The Dodder&#x27;s main tributaries after Glenasmole, in and prior to which many streams join, are the Jobstown (or Whitestown) Stream, the Owendoher River and its tributary the Whitechurch Stream, the Little Dargle River (with Castle Stream and other tributaries), the Slang or Dundrum River, the Swan River (or Water), and the small Muckross Stream.

===Link with the Poddle===
The River Poddle, a tributary of the Liffey in its own right, was linked with the River Dodder from a large weir, in Balrothery, north of Firhouse village, from the 13th century. This weir, variously called the City, Great, Balrothery or Firhouse Weir, facilitated the offtake of part of the Dodder flow through a sluice and canal structure, known as the &quot;City Watercourse&quot;, which ran through part of Templeogue. This link formerly provided much of Dublin City&#x27;s water supply. It was partly piped in the mid-20th century, and the connection was later broken by housing development. All that remains now are a small channel from the weir, dead-ending less than 100m from the weir, and some unseen underground flows.

==History==
The Dodder lay well beyond the original city of Dublin but began to have an important impact in the 13th century when water from its course was diverted to boost the small Poddle River, which in turn supplied fresh water to parts of Dublin.

Over centuries, the Dodder and its tributaries drove many mills, crucial to Dublin&#x27;s industrial base, but all are now disused. In many cases, all traces have been erased but there are some remaining, such as millraces. The de Meones family, who gave their name to the nearby suburb of Rathmines, owned a mill in that area as early as the mid-fourteenth century. In the sixteenth century much of the surrounding lands belonged to the Talbot family, ancestors of the Talbots of Mount Talbot. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the Domvile family, who owned much of Templeogue, effectively controlled access to much of the river, which passed through their estates. At that time the Dodder was the main source of Dublin&#x27;s drinking water, and whether fairly or unfairly, the Domviles were accused of using their control of the Dublin water supply to further their own selfish ends, by threatening to divert its course if their wishes were not met. In fact, the legal right to control the course of the river was vested in the Mayor and Corporation of Dublin; this was confirmed by a court ruling as early as 1527.

===Flooding===
The river floods some surrounding areas from time to time, as it is too short and shallow to hold the volume of water which pours into it from its tributaries during heavy rain. The River Dodder &quot;has a history of flooding and is known as a &quot;flashy&quot; river with a quick response to rainstorms.&quot;

A flood on the Dodder in March 1628 claimed the life of Arthur Ussher, Deputy Clerk to the Privy Council of Ireland, who was &quot;carried away by the current, nobody being able to succour him, although many persons... his nearest friends, were by on both sides.&quot;

The two greatest Dodder floods before 1986 occurred on 25 August 1905, and on 3 and 4 August 1931. Hurricane Charley (often spelt &quot;Charlie&quot; in Ireland) passed south of the country on 25 August 1986. In 24 hours, 200mm (almost 8 inches) of rain poured down on Kippure Mountain while 100mm fell on Dublin causing heavy river flooding, including the Dodder in many places, and hardship and loss were experienced.

It has long been recognised that the problem of flooding is very difficult to solve, due to the sheer volume of water which pours into the river during periods of heavy rainfall.

==Flora and fauna==
There is an abundance of flora and fauna at the river. However, as the river flows through urban areas, pollution has long been a problem.

===Flora===
Flora along the river is varied. Bryophytes and algae are common with an abundance of filamentous green algae. &quot;Crocosmia&quot;, Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam are the only invasive species recorded along the river.
===Fauna===
The Dodder is home to many water-bird species including mallard, grey heron, kingfisher, dipper, coot, moorhen, grey wagtail, common sandpiper, cormorant and mute swan; the sparrowhawk nests in the trees lining the riverbanks. The red fox is common along the riverbank and the badger and otter have also been seen. In recent years a small feral population of mandarin ducks has become established by the river. It was reported in 2013 that an Irish Wildlife Trust survey found otters living along the Dodder.

Fish present in the river include brown trout, sea trout, stone loach, three-spined stickleback and European eel. Atlantic salmon can also be found in the river&#x27;s lower course.

Atlantic salmon and lamprey eels are expected to return to most of the river after a more than 200-year absence pending the construction of fish ladders

====Fishing and angling====

The Dodder is a popular river for fishing and angling amongst Dubliners. The fishing season is open between 17 March and 30 September.

==Books==
The Dodder is the main focus of &quot;Down the Dodder&quot; (Christopher Moriarty, 1998) and &quot;The Rivers Dodder and Poddle&quot; (McEntee and Corcoran, 2016), and is also discussed in multiple more general books, including &quot;The Rivers of Dublin&quot; (Sweeney, 1991), and &quot;Ten Dozen Waters: The Rivers and Streams of County Dublin&quot; (Doyle, 2008 et seq) and other volumes by the same author.

<text>The Life of the Last Prophet is the first album released by Yusuf Islam (after leaving the Western pop music business in 1978, when he was known as Cat Stevens). After that time, he recorded only albums with Islamic themes, including recordings for children to learn both the Arabic alphabet and basic tenets of Islam. This album is both an attempt to give praise to Muhammad, which is encouraged as an act of faith in the Qur&#x27;an, and an attempt to reach out to young people and those who wish to understand more about Islam, and to explain why such a popular commercial recording artist would leave the business at the height of his career.

Released in 1995, the album is a spoken-word, audio production.
