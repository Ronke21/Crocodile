<text>The Stanley Hotel is a 140-room Colonial Revival hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, United States, about five miles from the entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park. It was built by Freelan Oscar Stanley, co-founder of the Stanley Motor Carriage Company, and opened on July 4, 1909, as a resort for upper-class Easterners and a health retreat for sufferers of pulmonary tuberculosis. The hotel and its surrounding structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Today, the hotel includes a restaurant, spa, and bed-and-breakfast; with panoramic views of Lake Estes, the Rockies, and Longs Peak.

The Stanley Hotel served as the inspiration for the Overlook Hotel in Stephen King&#x27;s 1977 novel &quot;The Shining&quot; and its 1980 film adaptation. It was also a filming location for the related 1997 TV miniseries.

==History==

In 1903, the steam-powered car inventor Freelan Oscar Stanley (1849–1940) was stricken with a life-threatening resurgence of tuberculosis. The most highly recommended treatment of the day was fresh, dry air with much sunlight and a hearty diet. Therefore, like many &quot;lungers&quot; of his day, Stanley resolved to take the curative air of the Rocky Mountains. He and his wife Flora arrived in Denver, Colorado, in March and, in June, on the recommendation of Dr. Sherman Grant Bonney, moved to Estes Park, Colorado, for the rest of the summer. Over the season, Stanley&#x27;s health improved dramatically. Impressed by the beauty of the valley and grateful for his recovery, he decided to return every year. He lived to 91, dying of a heart attack in Newton, Massachusetts, one year after his wife, in 1940.
By 1907, Stanley had recovered completely. However, not content with the rustic accommodations, lazy pastimes and relaxed social scene of their new summer home, Stanley resolved to turn Estes Park into a resort town. In 1907, construction began on the Hotel Stanley, a 48-room grand hotel that catered to the class of moderately wealthy urbanites who composed the Stanleys&#x27; social circle back east as well as to consumptives seeking the healthful climate.

The land was purchased in 1908 through the representatives of The 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl, the Anglo-Irish peer who had originally acquired it by stretching the provisions of the Homestead Act of 1862 and pre-emption rights. Between 1872 and 1884, Lord Dunraven claimed of the Estes Valley in an unsuccessful attempt to create a private hunting preserve, making him one of the largest foreign holders of American lands. Unpopular with the local ranchers and farmers, Dunraven left the area in 1884, relegating the ranch to the management of an overseer. Dunraven&#x27;s presence in Colorado was parodied in Charles King&#x27;s novel &quot;Dunraven Ranch&quot; (1892) and James A. Michener&#x27;s &quot;Centennial&quot; (1974). His reputation was such that, when Stanley suggested &quot;The Dunraven&quot; as a name for his new hotel, 180 people signed a buckskin petition requesting that he name it for himself instead.

The main hotel and concert hall were completed in 1909 and the Manor in 1910. To bring guests from the nearest train depot in the foothills town of Lyons, Colorado, Stanley&#x27;s car company produced a fleet of specially-designed steam-powered vehicles called Mountain Wagons that seated multiple passengers. Stanley operated the hotel almost as a pastime, remarking once that he spent more money than he made each summer.

In 1926, Stanley sold his hotel to a private company incorporated for the sole purpose of running it. The venture failed and, in 1929, Stanley purchased his property out of foreclosure, selling it again in 1930 to fellow automobile and hotel magnate Roe Emery of Denver. Until 1983, the resort was only open during the summer, shutting down for the winter every year. The presence of the hotel and Stanley&#x27;s own involvement greatly contributed to the growth of Estes Park (incorporated in 1917) and the creation of the Rocky Mountain National Park (established in 1915).

The hotel was a member of Historic Hotels of America, a program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, but is not part of the program as of 2022.

===1911 gas explosion===
Upon opening, the hotel was alleged to be one of the few in the world powered entirely by electricity. However, lack of available power induced the installation of an auxiliary gas lighting system in June 1911. On June 25 – the day after the pipes had been filled – an explosion occurred that injured a maid and damaged the structure, though contemporary newspaper articles differ on certain details.

A brief article telegraphed to the &quot;York Dispatch&quot; (of York, Pennsylvania) and circulated by the Associated Press the following day said:

When the Lancaster paper reprinted the story, the editor noted that Elizabeth Wilson&#x27;s name did not appear in local directories and she could not be identified as a Lancastrian. Similar accounts in local Colorado papers give the maid&#x27;s name as Elizabeth Lambert and convey various dramatic details that are not confirmed by other articles. The most comprehensive and detailed article on the incident appeared on June 29 in the Fort Collins Express and seems to be the most accurate – positively refuting that the maid had been &quot;hurled from the second to the first floor&quot;

==Architecture==
The Stanley Hotel National Register Historic District contains 11 contributing structures including the main hotel, the concert hall, a carriage house, manager&#x27;s cottage, gate house and The Lodgea smaller bed-and-breakfast originally called The Manor House. The buildings were designed by F.O. Stanley with the professional assistance of Denver architect T. Robert Wieger, Henry &quot;Lord Cornwallis&quot; Rogers, and contractor Frank Kirchoff. The site was chosen for its vantage overlooking the Estes valley and Long&#x27;s Peak within the National Park. The main building, concert hall and Manor House are steel-frame structures on foundations of random rubble granite with clapboard siding and asphalt shingle roof. Originally, Stanley chose a yellow ocher color for the buildings&#x27; exteriors with white accents and trim. Lumber used in the structures was harvested from the areas of Bierstadt Lake and Hidden Valley in the future national park, and purchased from Kirchoff&#x27;s Lumberyard in Denver and Bluff City Lumber Company of Pine Bluff, Arkansas. The granite was quarried from the Baldwin property near the confluence of Beaver Brook and the Big Thompson River. Non-local materials were brought to Lyons, Colorado by rail and thence to Estes Park by mule-drawn wagon.

Upon opening in 1909, the hotel was alleged to be one of first in the country to be fully electrified from the lighting to the kitchens (although some fixtures could be operated with either electricity or gas). To supply his hotel with power, Stanley led the construction of the Fall River Hydroplant which also brought electricity to the town of Estes Park for the first time. Every guest room had a telephone and each pair of rooms shared an &quot;en suite&quot; bathroom with running water supplied by Black Canyon Creek, which had been dammed in 1906. Circa 1935, during Roe Emery&#x27;s tenure as owner the ochre-colored siding was painted white and most of the original electro-gas fixtures were replaced.

Although the style of the hotel evokes the historical architecture of New England, the general form and layout are designed to accommodate contemporary notions of hygiene and comfort. Given Stanley&#x27;s interest in architectural design and healthful living, he may have been inspired by the Carolina Hotel (built 1899–1900) in Pinehurst, North Carolina, designed by Bertrand E. Taylor (1856–1909)a national leader in hospital design and, like Stanley, a resident of Newton, Massachusetts. The parallels between the Carolina and the Stanley extend beyond style; the builder of the Carolina, James Walker Tufts, was a Boston soda magnate who initially developed Pinehurst as a health resort for people with pulmonary diseases. Whether or not Stanley had exposure to Taylor&#x27;s work and ideas, it is certain that he was influenced by Dr. Sherman Grant Bonney of the University of Denver, a contemporary expert in the treatment of tuberculosis; Stanley&#x27;s Estes Park summer house is illustrated in Bonney&#x27;s book, &quot;Pulmonary Tuberculosis&quot; (published while the hotel was under construction), and Stanley himself is acknowledged in the preface for his &quot;interest and efficiency in connection with the photographic illustrations.&quot; Although the hotel never operated as a sanitarium &quot;per se&quot;, it was designed to be an optimal environment for pulmonary health. When the construction plans were announced, the &quot;Fort Collins Weekly Courier&quot; reported, &quot;[Estes Park] has been a favorite place for doctors to send the more robust of their patients, who were in shape to be braced up by the keen air and the considerable altitude, but it has not always been possible to get suitable accommodations and surroundings for them. With the park turned into a vast pleasure ground, and ample provisions for the best food products, all precious objections will be dissipated.&quot; Accordingly, the facilities were sited and designed to meet the requirements expounded in Bonney&#x27;s book. For instance, according to Bonney,

This text is accompanied by a photograph of &quot;the delightful view afforded from the porches of cottages for consumptives in Estes Park, Colorado.&quot; The hotel also provided the ample porches, ventilation, southern exposure, and appetizing food recommended in Bonney&#x27;s book.

The style of the Stanley Hotel campus is colonial revival. The strong symmetrical arrangement of the primary facade, and the classically derived ornamental articulations such as the two-stage octagonal cupola, Palladian window, fanlights, dormers, swan&#x27;s neck pediments, scroll brackets, paired Tuscan columns, oval ox-eye windows, and elaborately turned balusters are all stylistic hallmarks of the so-called American Georgian and Federal Styles. The clapboard siding and carved wood elements are characteristic of New England&#x27;s regional building practices. And yet, these features are modified and arranged to accommodate the tastes and lifestyles of the early twentieth century.

The style of the hotel contrasts sharply with the rustic style used for the other hotels in Estes Park, before and after the Stanley&#x27;s construction. However, it was not an uncommon choice for a hotel of the Stanley&#x27;s size and quality in the time period (e.g. Royal Poinciana Hotel, Lake Yellowstone Hotel, Mount Washington Hotel). In general, the colonial revival symbolized the historical roots of modern American cultural values and the positive progress of American civilization. By this token, the Stanley Hotel was an expression of the modest gentility of the builder and his clientele, an advertisement for the modern comforts contained within it, and a beacon for the future of Estes Park as a respectable resort town. All of these connotations were heightened in contrast with the ruggedness of the Rocky Mountains and the rusticity of the other hotels in the area. 
===Main building===
The floor plan of the main hotel (completed 1909) was laid out to accommodate the various activities popular with the American upper class at the turn of the twentieth century and the spaces are decorated accordingly. The music room, for instance, with its cream-colored walls (originally green and white), picture windows and fine, classical plaster-work was designed for letter-writing during the day and chamber music at night – cultured pursuits perceived as feminine. On the other hand, the smoking lounge (today the Piñon Room) and adjoining billiard room, with their dark stained-wood elements and granite arch fireplace were designated for enjoyment by male guests. Stanley himself, having been raised in a conservative household and having recovered from a serious lung disease, did not smoke cigars or drink alcohol, but these were essential after-dinner activities for most men at the time. Billiards, however, was among Stanley&#x27;s most cherished pastimes.

With no central heating or ventilation system, the structure was designed to facilitate natural airflow; the Palladian window at the top of the grand stair could be opened to induce a cross-breeze through the lobby, French doors in all the public spaces open onto verandas, and two curving staircases connecting the guest corridors prevent stagnant air in the upper floors. Although the main hotel is now heated in the winter, guests still depend on natural ventilation for cooling in the summer. Within a few years of opening, a hydraulic elevator was put in operation. In 1916, the east wing of the main building was extended in the rear adding several guest rooms. Around this time, the alcove of the music room was added. In 1921, a rear veranda was enclosed forming a room that currently serves as a gift shop. Around 1935, the hydraulic elevator system was replaced with a cable-operated system and extended to the fourth floor necessitating the addition of a secondary cupola to house the mechanical apparatus. Originally, a porte-cochère extended from the central bay of the front porch, but this was removed when the south terrace was converted into a parking lot. In 1983, a service tunnel was excavated, connecting the basement-level corridor to the staff entrance. It is cut directly through the living granite on which the hotel rests.

===Concert hall===
The concert hall, east of the hotel, was built by Stanley in 1909 with the assistance of Henry &quot;Lord Cornwallis&quot; Rogers, the same architect who designed his summer cottage. According to popular legend, it was built by F.O. Stanley as a gift for his wife, Flora. The interior is decorated in the same manner as the music room in the main hotel and vaguely resembles that of the Boston Symphony Hall (McKim, Mead &amp; White, 1900) with which the Stanleys would have been familiar. The stage features a trap door, used for theatrical entrances and exits. The lower level once housed a two-lane bowling alley which was removed during the ownership of Maxwell Abbell. It possibly resembled the bowling alley at the Stanley&#x27;s Hunnewell Club in Newton, pictures of which are archived in the Newton Free Library. The hall underwent extensive repair and renovation in the 2000s.

===The Lodge===

Once called The Manor House, this smaller hotel between the main structure and the concert hall is a 1:3 scaled-down version of the main hotel. Unlike its model, the manor was fully heated from completion in 1910 which may indicate that Stanley planned to use it as a winter resort when the main building was closed for the season. However, unlike many other Colorado mountain towns now famous for their winter sports, Estes Park never attracted off-season visitors in Stanley&#x27;s day and the manor remained empty for much of the year. Today it is called The Lodge and it features a brunch restaurant and is open to guests as another location to stay on the property.

==&quot;The Shining&quot;==
In 1974, during their brief residency in Boulder, Colorado, American horror writer Stephen King and his wife Tabitha spent one night at the Stanley Hotel. The visit is known entirely through interviews given by King in which he presents differing narratives of the experience. At the time of his visit, King was writing a book with the working title &quot;Darkshine&quot; set in an amusement park, but was not satisfied with the setting. According to George Beahm&#x27;s &quot;Stephen King Companion&quot;, &quot;on the advisement of locals who suggested a resort hotel located in Estes Park, an hour&#x27;s drive away to the north, Stephen and Tabitha King found themselves checking in at the Stanley Hotel just as its other guests were checking out, because the hotel was shutting down for the winter season. After checking in and after Tabitha went to bed, King roamed the halls and went down to the hotel bar, where drinks were served by a bartender named Grady. As King returned to his room, numbered 217, his imagination was fired up by the hotel&#x27;s remote location, its grand size, and its eerie desolation. Later, when King went into the bathroom and pulled back the pink curtain for the tub, which had claw feet, he thought, &#x27;What if somebody died here? At that moment, I knew I had a book.

In a 1977 interview by the Literary Guild, King recounted &quot;While we were living [in Boulder] we heard about this terrific old mountain resort hotel and decided to give it a try. But when we arrived, they were just getting ready to close for the season, and we found ourselves the only guests in the placewith all those long, empty corridors.&quot; King and his wife were served dinner in an empty dining room accompanied by canned orchestral music: &quot;Except for our table all the chairs were up on the tables. So the music is echoing down the hall, and, I mean, it was like God had put me there to hear that and see those things. And by the time I went to bed that night, I had the whole book [&quot;The Shining&quot;] in my mind.&quot; In another retelling, King said &quot;I dreamed of my three-year-old son running through the corridors, looking back over his shoulder, eyes wide, screaming. He was being chased by a fire-hose. I woke up with a tremendous jerk, sweating all over, within an inch of falling out of bed. I got up, lit a cigarette, sat in a chair looking out the window at the Rockies, and by the time the cigarette was done, I had the bones of &quot;The Shining&quot; firmly set in my mind.&quot;

&quot;The Shining&quot; was published in 1977 and became the third great success of King&#x27;s career after &quot;Carrie&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;. The primary setting is an isolated Colorado resort named the Overlook Hotel which closes for the winter. In the front matter of the book, King tactfully states &quot;Some of the most beautiful resort hotels in the world are located in Colorado, but the hotel in these pages is based on none of them. The Overlook and the people associated with it exist wholly in the author&#x27;s imagination.&quot;

==Film location and venue==
The Stanley Hotel served as the fictional hotel and filming location for Danbury of Aspen, Colorado, in the 1994 film &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;.

&quot;The Shining&quot;, a three-part miniseries and horror tv-adaptation, was written and produced by Stephen King, based on his 1977 novel of the same name, which had been largely inspired by the Stanley Hotel. The miniseries was produced by King, who had been dissatisfied with Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1980 film. Unlike Kubrick&#x27;s version, the miniseries, directed by Mick Garris, was filmed at the Stanley Hotel, which stood in for the fictional &quot;Overlook Hotel&quot;, located in the Colorado Rockies. Film production started in March 1996, with the first episode being released in March 1997.

From 2013 to 2015, the hotel hosted the Stanley Film Festival, an independent horror film festival operated by the Denver Film Society, held in early May. The festival featured screenings, panels, student competitions, audience awards and receptions. The Stanley Film Festival was put on hiatus in 2016 and canceled for 2017.

Bravo&#x27;s cooking competition &quot;Top Chef&quot; also used the Stanley as a venue for Episode 10 of Season 15, which took place in various locations around Colorado.

Indie rock band Murder by Death have performed an annual series of winter concerts at the Stanley Hotel since 2014, with the 2020 edition being their seventh such event.

==Haunted reputation==

Despite a peaceful early history, in the years following the publication of &quot;The Shining&quot;, the Stanley Hotel gained a reputation as a setting for paranormal activity, and has been frequently named as one of the most haunted hotels in the United States. It has hosted numerous paranormal investigators and appeared in shows such as &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; and &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot;.

=== Room 217 ===
Before King&#x27;s visit, Room 217 was already infamous due to the 1911 gas incident that caused an explosion, injuring chambermaid Elizabeth Wilson. After her recovery, she returned to work and remained until 1950. Guests have since reported unexplained activities in this room, such as their belongings being mysteriously unpacked or lights turning on and off without cause. Some unmarried couples have even felt a cold presence between them in bed, leading to speculation that Wilson&#x27;s spirit lingers, enforcing her old-fashioned morals.

The room gained further notoriety in 1974 when King stayed there, an experience that directly inspired his novel.

<text>Armiński is a small lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, to the northeast of the large walled basin Gagarin. To the northwest of Armiński is the crater Beijerinck, and to the southeast lies Cyrano.

The rim of Armiński is slightly oval in shape, being somewhat elongated in the northeastern direction. It forms a double-crater with Armiński K, a slightly smaller formation nearly attached to the southeast rim. There is pair of a tiny craterlets lying across the southwest part of Arminski&#x27;s outer wall. The interior floor is relatively level, with a small craterlet near the western inner wall.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Armiński.

<text>John Henry &quot;Jack&quot; Horner (July 20, 1927 – November 18, 2004) was a Canadian rancher, politician, and Cabinet minister.

==Life and career==
Nicknamed &quot;Cactus Jack&quot;, Horner was born in Saskatchewan, the fifth child in a family of six boys and three girls. His mother&#x27;s uncle had been a prisoner of Louis Riel&#x27;s provisional government. His father, Ralph Horner, was a failed Conservative candidate who was appointed to the board of directors of Canadian National Railways by the government of R. B. Bennett in 1931, and then to the Senate of Canada in 1933.

Jack Horner moved to Alberta at the age of 18 to manage a ranch purchased by his father and then bought his own ranch in 1947.

He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1958 federal election from the rural central Alberta riding of Acadia, when the Progressive Conservative Party of which he was a member won the biggest majority government in Canadian history. Horner was an avid supporter of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. Also elected to the Parliament of Canada as Tories were his older brother, Hugh Horner and cousin Albert Horner. With Jack Horner&#x27;s father, Ralph, still sitting as a Senator, four Horners were sitting in the two chambers of Parliament simultaneously. Another brother, Norval Horner, was elected to the House in 1972. When Acadia was abolished in 1968, the bulk of it was absorbed into the new riding of Crowfoot, and Horner ran from this riding and won.

According to Jack Horner&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper:
:He presented himself as a friend of farmers, a foe of railways, an advocate of capital punishment, a critic of generous unemployment payments, an opponent of the right to strike in essential services, and at all times a staunch free enterpriser. He railed against any changes to the Crow&#x27;s Nest Pass rate that might hurt farmers. He was alert to any threat of socialism, whether from the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, Opposition Liberals, or the Red Tories in his own party.

Horner developed a reputation as a right winger and outspoken advocate for the rights of farmers and ranchers. He remained one of &quot;Diefenbaker&#x27;s cowboys&quot; during the 1960s, backing Diefenbaker against the ultimately successful attempts to unseat him. At the 1966 Tory convention which changed the rules to allow a challenge to a sitting leader, Horner threw a punch at Dalton Camp supporter Roy McMurtry, and accosted Brian Mulroney in a hallway. He resented the leadership of Diefenbaker&#x27;s successor, Robert Stanfield, describing him as &quot;a very, very sad choice&quot;. Horner worked to undermine Stanfield&#x27;s leadership through manoeuvers such as leading a revolt against the party&#x27;s support for the Official Languages Act.

He was a candidate for the PC Party leadership at the 1976 convention. At one point during the convention, he knocked over an eavesdropping reporter. He finished fourth in the contest, and threw his support to Claude Wagner, who lost on the final ballot to Joe Clark.

Horner had even less respect for Clark than he had for Stanfield. Although Clark was a fellow Albertan, Horner regarded him as a city slicker. Horner once paid Clark the ultimate rancher&#x27;s insult by describing him as a &quot;sheep herder.&quot;

On April 20, 1977, Horner shocked his constituents and many political observers by crossing the floor to join the Liberal Party, which was at the time deeply unpopular in Alberta. The next day, he joined Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s Cabinet as minister without portfolio, and was promoted in September 1977 to the position of Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. When Diefenbaker, who was still in Parliament 14 years after leaving the Prime Ministership, learned of Horner&#x27;s defection, he said, &quot;the sheriff has joined the rustlers.&quot;

Despite (or perhaps due to) his Cabinet position, Horner&#x27;s floor-crossing was extremely unpopular in his strongly conservative riding. Even by rural Alberta standards, Crowfoot was an unshakably conservative area. Most of its living residents had never been represented by a Liberal, and the bulk of its territory had been represented by centre-right MPs since 1935. He was not helped by the redistribution ahead of the 1979 federal election, which pushed him into a riding that was almost two-thirds new to him. Although it retained the name of Crowfoot, most of its constituents came from neighbouring Battle River, represented by fellow Tory Arnold Malone.

Many critics argued that Horner&#x27;s floor crossing was motivated by opportunism as opposed to ideology and ultimately provoked by the pending electoral redistribution. Had Horner remained with the Tories, the redistribution meant he would have had to face Malone for the PC nomination. Horner would have faced a difficult road to gaining the PC nomination in the redistributed Crowfoot. It was more Malone&#x27;s riding than Horner&#x27;s, and Malone was also favoured by Clark and the PC establishment. That left Horner with only three options: run as an independent, cross the floor, or retire from federal politics. His chances of retaining his seat as an independent were slim, though slightly better than his chances of being elected as a Liberal given the strong antipathy toward the Liberals in rural Alberta. On the other hand, serving as a government member from Alberta virtually guaranteed Horner a cabinet post for the remainder of the 30th Parliament, since the Liberals had not elected any candidates under their own banner from Alberta in the 1974 election. Serving as a Liberal also gave Horner the prospect of securing patronage appointments under future Liberal governments after leaving Parliament, a prospect that Horner considered quite likely because of his low opinion of Clark&#x27;s leadership.

In any event, Horner ran for reelection even though polling indicated he faced almost certain defeat. One poll showed him getting only 15 percent of the vote, down from 75 percent in 1974. As expected, Horner was badly defeated in the 1979 election, which unseated the Liberal government. His vote share collapsed to 18 percent, losing almost three fourths of his vote from 1974. Ultimately, he finished a very distant second, more than 20,000 votes behind Malone. Horner attempted a comeback in the 1980 federal election, but despite the return of a Liberal government nationally, Horner again placed a poor second in Crowfoot, winning only 4,761 votes, 1,000 votes fewer than he had managed in 1979.

The Liberal government appointed him to the board of Canadian National Railways, where he served as chairman from 1982 to 1984. From 1984 to 1988, he was Administrator (Federal Deputy Minister equivalent) of the Western Grain Transportation Agency, reporting to Parliament through the Minister of Transport.

He died at a Calgary hospital, leaving his wife, Leola, and two sons, Brent and Craig.

Again and again he plans to tell her his true feelings, but each time something (usually a misunderstanding of some kind) gets in the way. Things become even more complicated when Itsuki Akiba returns to Japan; she is a girl Ichitaka was friends with in their childhood before she moved to the United States, and who had a huge crush on him.

&quot;I&quot;s&quot; was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from 1997 to 2000, with its chapters collected into 15 &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. It was adapted into a two-episode original video animation (OVA), titled &quot;From I&quot;s&quot;, in 2002, and a six-part OVA, called &quot;I&quot;s Pure&quot;, which was released in 2005 and 2006. The manga and both OVAs were licensed in North America by Viz Media. The manga was released from April 2005 to September 2007, while the OVAs were released as a box set in March 2009. By 2008, the &quot;I&quot;s&quot; manga had over 10 million copies in circulation.

==Characters==
:
:Ichitaka Seto has a generally shy and reserved nature, and, due to misfortunes with girls when he was younger, he has acquired a reflexively defensive posture when dealing with older girls. Thus, he is prone to rude comments when it seems some people are just trying to help, and can place an emotional wall in front of himself when people ask about his feelings. Many complications get in the way of Ichitaka&#x27;s goal of being with Iori, such as amorous pursuits made towards him by other girls (notably Izumi, who can be seen as being the most assertive in showing her feelings). Regardless, he constantly thinks about Iori and it would seem he would want nothing more than for her to be his girlfriend. Throughout the series he finds himself lost in daydreaming or imagination, and several times, he even drifts off right in front of Iori.
:
:Iori Yoshizuki is prim, proper and friendly. She is a girl who is easy to like and get along with. This generally positive outlook is put to the test from the beginning of the series, which opens on a magazine article featuring Iori in a swimsuit spread. Suddenly, Iori is the center of attention, and she finds it difficult to differentiate whether people (particularly guys) like her for herself or her beauty.
:
:Itsuki Akiba is loud, reckless and shameless, a complete opposite of Iori, including her affinity towards wearing boyish clothing and having a short haircut. Itsuki and Ichitaka had been friends since grade school, with Itsuki (although a year younger) often being an emotional coach to Ichitaka, particularly regarding girls. The two seemed to become closer than friends in their young life, a relationship that was suddenly interrupted when Itsuki moved away to America four years before the series begins. Just as abruptly, Itsuki returns to Ichitaka&#x27;s life soon after the series starts, now a fully grown young lady, but still with real feelings for Ichitaka. Halfway through the series, she goes back to America to work with a world-renowned sculptor and is further unseen. After she is gone, she seems to occasionally appear in Ichitaka&#x27;s mind to scold him during his bouts of self-pity, though these manifestations are really just Ichitaka&#x27;s subconscious trying to tell him something important.
:
:Izumi Isozaki is two years younger than the other characters and is very much like Itsuki Akiba. However, she is not as shy in expressing her emotions, especially her love for Ichitaka Seto. In fact, she announces her love to almost everyone she knows. She is also a fair bit more daring and is quite superstitious when it comes to love. She constantly tails Seto, and on more than one occasion, has tried to seduce Seto to sleep with her in order to prove her love. Izumi persists in attempting to obtain Seto&#x27;s love and says that she will try whatever it takes to get him to be with her. She is introduced halfway through the manga, where she meets Seto on the beach during their summer vacation, and after that, she discovers that they go to the same school. She falls for Seto after he defends her from her overly-aggressive boyfriend, and tricks him into going on dates throughout the series. She is convinced that he is her soulmate, and is determined for him to become her boyfriend.
:
:Although her name does not begin with an &quot;I&quot;, the &quot;Ai&quot; from &quot;Aiko&quot; represents an &quot;i&quot; sound in Japanese, indirectly marking her as an &quot;i.&quot; She is quite ditzy, scatterbrained, and is prone to losing or misplacing her possessions, but is also very nice, kind, and unbelievably cheerful, even in bad situations. She also has an uncanny resemblance to Iori Yoshizuki, save for a mole under her left eye. Her close resemblance to Iori causes Seto some complications when she is introduced three-quarters of the way through the manga. She, as well as Seto, fall in love with one another at a later point after they meet. Asō realizes this is a potential problem for Seto and decides to move away in order to keep Seto&#x27;s and Iori&#x27;s love intact.
:One of the series&#x27; running gags is the odd similarities between the women who get in the way of Ichitaka being with Iori. Not only do they all have &quot;I&quot; names (or AI in the case of Aiko Asou), but they all appear very similar in appearance. Izumi looks like Iori when she has long hair and like Itsuki when she has cut it short. Aiko also looks like Iori but this time more of a near perfect double with the exception of a mole on her cheek.
:
:Yasumasa Teratani is Ichitaka&#x27;s best friend who seems to think himself a pro with the opposite gender despite his somewhat nerdy appearance and lack of success with girls. He is often found giving Seto encouragement and good advice. Though sometimes his help is unwarranted and sometimes ends up in a bad situation, he means well with his actions and is bummed when Seto does not succeed. Ichitaka spends a considerable amount of time through the story continuing to ask for advice, but as the story progresses he learns to not rely so heavily on him. He is generally interpreted as well-meaning but is also a jerk and a pervert, and not exactly the smartest person in the series.
:
:Jun Koshinae is a friend from Ichitaka&#x27;s class. He is first introduced in Volume 4, during a school trip to Kyoto, when he is paired with Iori. At first he appears to be a threat to Ichitaka, for he seems to be in love with Iori, but eventually, it turns out that he is a homosexual and is in love with Higemi-sensei, their teacher. Because Higemi-sensei is paired with Ichitaka, Koshinae requests for a trade, bringing the happy Ichitaka back to his crush. From that point on, Jun becomes one of Ichitaka&#x27;s best friends, and an important listener when he is not comforted with the advice he got from Teratani. Though he hates physical aggression, he is a very adept martial artist when need be.
:
:Nami is a classmate of Ichitaka, Iori, Teratani, and others, and is generally the mood-maker of the group whenever they are all together on a trip, school project, etc. She is very energetic and cheerful and loves to express herself, though her tomboyish and carefree attitude can make others feel awkward at times. She comes from a very rich family, as it is evident halfway through the manga when the group comes over to her house to organize a group project. Some think of her as a slut and a pervert, since she has tried to get people to sleep together and has shown off her body numerous times.
:
:Yuka is another classmate of Ichitaka and Iori, and along with Nami, is one of Iori&#x27;s closest friends. Though she does not stand out too much among the rest of the group, she seems to be the only one that Iori can talk deeply to about her issues in life. She, to everyone&#x27;s surprisem develops a crush on Teratani halfway through the manga, though when he ends up rejecting her those feelings turn into that of contempt. She does not exactly hate Ichitaka, but is put off by his timidness. In the end, she supports him all the way. She is pushed into kissing Teratani by accident in the finale leaving both blushing. 
:
:A former senior in Ichitaka&#x27;s high school, he is the main recurring villain of the manga. A sexual deviant, he tries to take advantage of Iori no less than three times throughout the manga with various schemes, but is foiled by Ichitaka every single time. After his unsuccessful first attempt he is expelled from the school, after his second attempt he becomes a drug addict on the verge of insanity, and plays a major role later. &quot;Marionette King&quot; is his Internet handle, and his real name is never mentioned in the manga, although it is later revealed to be Samejima.
:
:A classmate of Ichitaka and Iori, and he looks very much like a frog. He is a complete pervert, and when he sees Iori in the Fuwarin commercial, he becomes what can best be described as a &quot;total psycho&quot;, believing that he and Iori are destined to be together. He has tried numerous times to sleep with Iori. After high school, he plays a minor part in the entire plot. He appears once or twice afterwards, but beyond that, he is considered a minor character.
:Ichitaka&#x27;s first crush. When she found out about his feelings back in sixth grade, she promptly told him to leave her alone, as she thought he was gross. This started Ichitaka&#x27;s &quot;bad-luck-with-the-ladies-itis&quot;, and made him promise with Itsuki that they would get married someday. Myoko often comes back to haunt Ichitaka in the first half of the series through wild daydreams and hallucinations, but this has stopped as Ichitaka&#x27;s confidence grew.

==Media==
===Manga===
&quot;I&quot;s&quot;, written and illustrated by Masakazu Katsura, was serialized in the &quot;shōnen&quot; manga anthology &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from April 21, 1997 to May 29, 2000. Publisher Shueisha collected the 143 chapters into 15 &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. The manga was licensed in North America by Viz Media, and was released from April 15, 2005 to September 4, 2007. However, Viz censored their releases in order to, as they stated, &quot;fit the criteria of audiences in the U.S.&quot;. All edits were done to conceal nudity, specifically characters&#x27; breasts, and were made with the approval of Katsura. However, as of the 13th through 15th volumes, the censorship of nudity has ceased. Jason Thompson declared the edits one of &quot;The Greatest Censorship Fails&quot; in manga.

===Original video animations===
The manga was adapted into two original video animation (OVA) series, &quot;From I&quot;s&quot; in 2002 and &quot;I&quot;s Pure&quot;, which was released in 2005 and 2006. The OVA generally follows the main plot of the manga, but due to the shorter nature of the OVA, few of the main characters play a less prominent role (for example, Itsuki only lasts three episodes before her departure and Izumi only appears in the beach storyline arc from manga volume 8) and others such as Jun and Aiko are omitted altogether. Due to the missing characters, there are many situations in the OVA that follow the plot in the manga but are played out by different characters. In addition to the manga, Viz Media also licensed both OVA series and released them in North America as a box-set on March 24, 2009.
(North American DVD release UPC: 782009240099)

====&quot;From I&quot;s&quot;====
 is the first OVA based on &quot;I&quot;s&quot;, consisting of two 30-minute episodes, released December 9, 2002 and March 19, 2003, respectively. A box set containing both episodes as well as a making-of documentary on a third DVD, was released on March 25, 2004. The story of &quot;From I&quot;s&quot; is not an adaptation of a story from the manga, but a new story set during the characters&#x27; summer holidays.

====&quot;I&quot;s Pure&quot;====
&quot;I&quot;s Pure&quot; is the second OVA based on &quot;I&quot;s&quot;, a 6-episode OVA series animated by ARMS, produced by Pierrot, and released on DVD in Japan by Liverpool. There is also a DVD volume 0 containing promotional and background material. The series is a heavily abridged retelling of the major events in volumes 1 to 15.

A video game titled &quot;I&quot;s Pure&quot;, based on the OVA series of the same name, was released on November 9, 2006 for the PlayStation 2 in Japan.

Additionally, despite being a romantic dramedy, four characters from &quot;I&quot;s&quot; (Iori, Itsuki, Ichitaka and Izumi) are featured in &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot;, a fighting game featuring many characters from popular &quot;Shōnen Jump&quot; series. None of the &quot;I&quot;s&quot; characters fight directly, however, and simply serve a support role for other characters.

<doc id="1053838" wikidata="Q5482670" url="?curid=1053838" title="Francis W. Moore Jr.">
<text>Francis W. Moore Jr. (April 20, 1808 – September 1, 1864) became the second mayor of Houston, Texas, in 1838. He was elected twice more and served as mayor of the city in three consecutive decades, the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s. He was the co-publisher of the &quot;Telegraph and Texas Register&quot;, a newspaper in Houston.

==Early life==
Francis W. Moore Jr. was born on April 20, 1808, in Salem, Massachusetts. His father, Francis W. Moore, studied medicine at Harvard University. The Moores relocated to Livingston, New York, in 1828. The younger Moore lost an arm in his youth. By 1834, he moved to Bath, New York, where he enrolled as a law student and worked as a teacher. 

==Career==
Moore volunteered as a Buckeye Ranger, a military unit fighting for Texas Independence from Mexico in 1836.

===Telegraph and Texas Register===
In March 1837, Moore purchased Thomas Borden&#x27;s shares in the &quot;Telegraph and Texas Register&quot;. Moore was co-owner with Gail Borden and soon took over as editor-in-chief. At the time, the newspaper was located in Columbia. The 1st Texas Congress had been expected to name Columbia the capital of the new Republic of Texas. Instead, they chose the brand-new city of Houston. The publishers made plans to move the press to Houston. Houston and Columbia were separated by of boggy river bottoms. It was very difficult to transport large loads overland, so publishers made arrangements to ship the printing press via boat. On April 16, 1837, the press arrived in Houston, on the same boat as the executive departments of the Republic of Texas.

The first issue to be printed in Houston appeared on May 2, 1837. In late June, Gail Borden transferred his shares to Jacob W. Cruger. The partnership between Moore and Cruger continued until April 1851, when Moore bought out Cruger.

Under Moore&#x27;s leadership, the newspaper became &quot;the most influential news organ of the Republic of Texas&quot;. Although the capital moved to Austin in 1840, the newspaper remained in Houston. When the capital was relocated, Moore and Cruger established another newspaper, &quot;The Texas Sentinel&quot;, in Austin. His reporting did not necessarily please politicians. Governor Sam Houston once referred to Moore as that &quot;&#x27;lying scribbler of the Telegraph, whose one arm could write more malicious falsehoods than any man with two arms&#x27;&quot;.

Many of the paper&#x27;s articles were aimed at attracting immigrants to Texas, or retaining those who had recently arrived. Articles emphasized the good character of recent settlers (as opposed to the widespread belief that residents of Texas were scoundrels) and the advantages of living in the country. Through much of 1837, Moore wrote a series of articles describing the natural resources of Texas and the geography of various regions of the nations. Moore&#x27;s series on the geography of Texas was in 1840 compiled into a book &quot;Maps and Descriptions of Texas&quot;. The book was reprinted in 1844 as &quot;Description of Texas&quot;. The articles were widely quoted in other newspapers and journals; an 1843 issue of &quot;Southern Agriculturist&quot; copied at least one &quot;Telegraph&quot; article in whole.

Moore included many articles explaining and justifying the Texas Revolution and the very existence of the Republic. At the same time, as early as 1837, the newspaper advocated annexation to the United States, even publishing a series of articles explaining that Texas should have been considered part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1846, not long after Texas was annexed, Moore and Cruger changed the name of the newspaper to &quot;Democratic Telegraph and Texas Register&quot;, as they explained, &quot;to designate the plotical tenets that we shall advocate&quot;.

Moore designed the Seal of Houston, adopted on February 24, 1840. He was paid $50 for his work.

In 1854, Moore sold the newspaper to Harvey H. Allen.

===Politics===
Moore was elected as mayor of Houston in 1838. The second mayor of Houston established the first municipal police force. Using both the mayor&#x27;s office and the printing press, he protested the practice of dueling and attempted to mediate disputes in order to prevent duels.

===Geologist===
Despite his opinion of Moore&#x27;s reporting, in 1860 Sam Houston–now Governor of Texas–appointed Moore the State Geologist, replacing Benjamin F. Shumard.

==Personal life==
Moore wedded Elizabeth Mofat Wood in 1840, whom he had known in Bath, New York. The Moores had nine children. 

==Death and legacy==
Moore died in Duluth, Minnesota, on September 1, 1864. He is interred in Brooklyn, New York, at Green-Wood Cemetery.

<doc id="1053839" wikidata="Q79203" url="?curid=1053839" title="Dharmarakṣa">
<text> (; J. Jiku Hōgo; K. Ch&#x27;uk Pŏpho; c. 233-310) was one of the most important early translators of Mahayana sutras into Chinese. Several of his translations had profound effects on East Asian Buddhism. He is described in scriptural catalogues as Yuezhi in origin.

==Life==
His family lived at Dunhuang, where he was born around 233 CE. At the age of eight, he became a novice and took the Indian monk named Zhu Gaozuo () as his teacher.

As a young boy, Dhamaraksa was said to be extremely intelligent, and journeyed with his teacher to many countries in the Western Regions, where he learned Central Asian languages and scripts. He then traveled back to China with a quantity of Buddhist texts and translated them with the aid of numerous assistants and associates, both Chinese and foreign, from Parthians to Khotanese. One of his more prominent assistants was a Chinese upāsaka, Nie Chengyuan (), who served as a scribe and editor.

Dharmaraksa first began his translation career in Chang&#x27;an (present day Xi&#x27;an) in 266 CE, and later moved to Luoyang, the capital of the newly formed Jin Dynasty. He was active in Dunhuang for some time as well, and alternated between the three locations. It was in Chang&#x27;an that he made the first known translation of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Ten Stages Sutra&quot;, two texts that later became definitive for Chinese Buddhism, in 286 and 302, respectively. He died at the age of seventy-eight after a period of illness; the exact location of his death is still disputed.

==Works==
Altogether, Dharmaraksa translated around 154 sūtras. Many of his works were greatly successful, widely circulating around northern China in the third century and becoming the subject of exegetical studies and scrutiny by Chinese monastics in the fourth century. His efforts in both translation and lecturing on sūtras are said to have converted many in China to Buddhism, and contributed to the development of Chang&#x27;an into a major center of Buddhism at the time.

Some of his main translations are: 
*&quot;Saddharmapundarika Sūtra&quot; (), the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;
*&quot;Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; (&quot;The Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in 25,000 Lines&quot;, )
*The &quot;Dasabhūmika-sūtra&quot; (&quot;Ten Stages Sutra,&quot; )
*The &quot;Lalitavistara Sūtra&quot; ()
*The &quot;Vimalakīrtinirdeśa&quot;
*The &quot;Tathāgataguhyaka Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Secrets of the Tathāgata&quot;)
*The &quot;Bhadrakalpikasūtra&quot;
*The &quot;Śūraṅgama Samādhi Sūtra&quot;
*&quot;Akṣayamatinirdeśa&quot;

<text>Arnold is a lunar impact crater that is located in the north-northeastern part of the visible Moon, near the lunar limb. This location gives the crater a notably oval appearance due to foreshortening, although the formation is actually relatively round. It lies to the northeast of the Mare Frigoris, to the north of the crater Democritus. West of Arnold is the smaller crater Moigno.

The ancient rim of Arnold has been worn and rounded by ages of subsequent bombardment. There is a gap in the wall to the southwest, marked by the tiny crater Arnold J, and the wall is relatively low along the eastern edge. The northern half of the rim is the most intact, particularly to the northeast where is joins the satellite crater Arnold A.

The inner floor of Arnold crater has been resurfaced by lava, and is relatively flat except for a number of tiny craterlets. The most notable crater in the interior is Arnold F, in the northwest section. If the crater once possessed a central peak, no sign of this feature now remains.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Arnold.

<doc id="1053848" wikidata="Q699618" url="?curid=1053848" title="Arrhenius (lunar crater)">
<text>Arrhenius is a lunar impact crater that is located just on the far side of the Moon, near the southwest limb. In this location the vicinity of the crater can be viewed during favorable librations, although it is viewed from on edge. To the south-southeast is the worn crater Blanchard, and De Roy lies further to the west.

This crater was named after Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius by the IAU in 1970.

The outer wall of Arrhenius has been somewhat worn and eroded due to a history of minor impacts, leaving the rim rounded and low. There is a notch in the rim to the north-northwest, and an outward bulge along the southeast face. A small craterlet lies across the southwestern rim. The inner floor is relatively flat and free of features of interest. The midpoint lacks a central peak.

This crater lies within the Mendel-Rydberg Basin, a 630 km wide impact basin of Nectarian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Arrhenius.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Arrhenius P — &quot;See&quot; Blanchard (crater).

<doc id="1053857" wikidata="Q2164702" url="?curid=1053857" title="William Gowers (neurologist)">
<text>Sir William Richard Gowers (; 20 March 1845 – 4 May 1915) was a British neurologist, described by Macdonald Critchley in 1949 as &quot;probably the greatest clinical neurologist of all time&quot;. He practised at the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptics, Queen Square, London (now the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery) from 1870–1910, ran a consultancy from his home in Queen Anne Street, W1, and lectured at University College Hospital. He published extensively, but is probably best remembered for his two-volume &quot;Manual of Diseases of the Nervous System &quot;(1886, 1888), affectionately referred to at Queen Square as the &quot;Bible of Neurology&quot;.

==Education and early life==
William Richard Gowers, son of Hackney ladies&#x27; bootmaker William Gowers, was born above his father&#x27;s shop in Mare Street, Hackney. By the time he was 11 his father and all three of his siblings had died, and his mother returned to live in Doncaster leaving the boy with Venables relatives in Oxford, where he attended Christ Church school. When he left school he tried farming, working for a family friend in Yorkshire, but this was not a success.

On a visit to Coggeshall, Essex, where his paternal grandmother lived, his aunt introduced him to the local doctor, and suggested that he might become a medical apprentice. Rather unwillingly he agreed, and spent the next three years apprenticed to Thomas Simpson. Gowers&#x27; parents both came from congregationalist backgrounds, as did Simpson. Gowers was persuaded to try to take the University of London matriculation, as it was a university established for Nonconformists and others excluded under the Test Act from most other universities. During 1862–3, while an apprentice, he kept a shorthand diary, largely to practice writing Pitman&#x27;s shorthand, a skill he decided to master before going to university. Two congregationalist ministers at Coggeshall, first the Rev. Brian Dale and then the Rev. Alfred Philps provided guidance to the young man, who studied for his matriculation using the resources of the local Mechanics Institute. He passed his matriculation examination in 1863 in the First Class Division.

==Career and research==

Philps took Gowers to London to meet William Jenner, who took the young man under his wing, encouraged him, and employed him as his secretary. Gowers achieved an outstanding university record, studying under both Jenner and John Russell Reynolds. It was probably Reynolds who persuaded Gowers to apply for the newly created position of Medical Registrar at the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic, Queen Square, a position he held from 1870–1872. He was then promoted to Assistant Physician at Queen Square, and spent the rest of his career at the hospital, retiring in 1910.

In 1875, he married Mary Baines, a relative by marriage of Reynolds. Her family were proprietors of the &quot;Leeds Mercury&quot;, a prominent Nonconformist newspaper promulgating liberal reforms. They had two sons, Sir William Frederick Gowers and Sir Ernest Arthur Gowers, who went to school at Rugby and then read Classics at Cambridge. In due course both joined the recently formed Administrative Class of the civil service: William Frederick went into the Colonial Civil Service, ending his career as Governor of Uganda. Ernest joined the Home Civil Service. He had an eminent career, after which he made his name as author of &quot;Plain Words&quot;, a book originally written as a civil service training pamphlet, and finally, undertaking the first revision of Fowler&#x27;s &quot;Modern English Language.&quot;&quot; &quot;Their two sisters, Edith and Evelyn, developed retinitis pigmentosa in early adult life. Ernest was grandfather of the composer Patrick Gowers and great-grandfather of the mathematician Sir Timothy Gowers.

Gowers produced the majority of his major works, including the two-volume &quot;Manual of Diseases of the Nervous System&quot;, in the years between 1870 and 1890. The book is still used today by medical professionals as a primary reference for this disease. A master of diagnosis, his clinical teaching at Queen Square earned him an international reputation. He was appointed Professor of Clinical Medicine at University College London in 1887. He was a self-taught artist, and skilled etcher, an accomplishment he enjoyed both as a hobby and in his work. One of his holiday etchings was exhibited at the Royal Academy, much to his great pride.

Overwork caused his health to deteriorate rapidly from the 1890s onwards. Both he and his wife succumbed to pneumonia in 1913, from which Mary died. Gowers died two years later, in 1915. He was 70.

Gowers was knighted in 1897.

===Research methods===
Gowers was an early convert to statistical collection, and based his research on his own case records rather than secondary sources. Working in an era before the development of computers or recording devices, he used his shorthand as a tool for collecting comprehensive records of his cases. In later life he formed the Society of Medical Phonographers and the shorthand journal &quot;The Phonographic Record of Clinical Teaching and Medical Science&quot;. He became a figure of fun to some of his students for his advocacy of shorthand, but it clearly served him well throughout his life, from his days as a medical student, in drafting his major publications, and in collecting his case records.

===Contributions to neurology===
&quot;The Lancet &quot;wrote that &#x27;It may be stated without fear of contradiction that Gowers was an extraordinary observer, accurate and painstaking, with a wide horizon and a sound judgment which made his deductions from observations both definite and reliable. He had a marvellous power of what might be called intensive deduction&#x27;. The &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; stated &#x27;There can be no doubt that in neuropathology Gowers was a very remarkable teacher, and that both in that capacity and as an original investigator he did very much to enlarge its bounds and to improve its practice&#x27;.

He was also renowned for the clarity of his writing, a skill which added considerably to the impact of everything he wrote. He also disseminated the great insights of Hughlings Jackson, explaining to the medical world the dense and confusing writings of the man he referred to as his &#x27;master&#x27;. Gowers gave his name to Gowers&#x27; sign (a sign of muscular weakness), the Gowers&#x27; tract (tractus spinocerebellaris anterior) in the nervous system, Gowers&#x27; syndrome (situational vasovagal syncope), and &quot;Gowers&#x27; Round&quot; (the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery&#x27;s weekly case presentation and clinical teaching session).

In 1892, Gowers was one of the founding members of the National Society for the Employment of Epileptics (now the Epilepsy Society), along with Sir David Ferrier and John Hughlings Jackson.

<doc id="1053858" wikidata="Q1068690" url="?curid=1053858" title="Functional genomics">
<text>Functional genomics is a field of molecular biology that attempts to describe gene (and protein) functions and interactions. Functional genomics make use of the vast data generated by genomic and transcriptomic projects (such as genome sequencing projects and RNA sequencing). Functional genomics focuses on the dynamic aspects such as gene transcription, translation, regulation of gene expression and protein–protein interactions, as opposed to the static aspects of the genomic information such as DNA sequence or structures. A key characteristic of functional genomics studies is their genome-wide approach to these questions, generally involving high-throughput methods rather than a more traditional &quot;candidate-gene&quot; approach.

==Definition and goals ==

In order to understand functional genomics it is important to first define function. In their paper Graur et al. define function in two possible ways. These are &quot;selected effect&quot; and &quot;causal role&quot;. The &quot;selected effect&quot; function refers to the function for which a trait (DNA, RNA, protein etc.) is selected for. The &quot;causal role&quot; function refers to the function that a trait is sufficient and necessary for. Functional genomics usually tests the &quot;causal role&quot; definition of function.

The goal of functional genomics is to understand the function of genes or proteins, eventually all components of a genome. The term functional genomics is often used to refer to the many technical approaches to study an organism&#x27;s genes and proteins, including the &quot;biochemical, cellular, and/or physiological properties of each and every gene product&quot; while some authors include the study of nongenic elements in their definition. Functional genomics may also include studies of natural genetic variation over time (such as an organism&#x27;s development) or space (such as its body regions), as well as functional disruptions such as mutations.

The promise of functional genomics is to generate and synthesize genomic and proteomic knowledge into an understanding of the dynamic properties of an organism. This could potentially provide a more complete picture of how the genome specifies function compared to studies of single genes. Integration of functional genomics data is often a part of systems biology approaches.

==Techniques and applications==
Functional genomics includes function-related aspects of the genome itself such as mutation and polymorphism (such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis), as well as the measurement of molecular activities. The latter comprise a number of &quot;-omics&quot; such as transcriptomics (gene expression), proteomics (protein production), and metabolomics. Functional genomics uses mostly multiplex techniques to measure the abundance of many or all gene products such as mRNAs or proteins within a biological sample. A more focused functional genomics approach might test the function of all variants of one gene and quantify the effects of mutants by using sequencing as a readout of activity. Together these measurement modalities endeavor to quantitate the various biological processes and improve our understanding of gene and protein functions and interactions.

===At the DNA level===

====Genetic interaction mapping====

Systematic pairwise deletion of genes or inhibition of gene expression can be used to identify genes with related function, even if they do not interact physically. Epistasis refers to the fact that effects for two different gene knockouts may not be additive; that is, the phenotype that results when two genes are inhibited may be different from the sum of the effects of single knockouts.

====DNA/Protein interactions====

Proteins formed by the translation of the mRNA (messenger RNA, a coded information from DNA for protein synthesis) play a major role in regulating gene expression. To understand how they regulate gene expression it is necessary to identify DNA sequences that they interact with. Techniques have been developed to identify sites of DNA-protein interactions. These include ChIP-sequencing, CUT&amp;RUN sequencing and Calling Cards.

====DNA accessibility assays====
Assays have been developed to identify regions of the genome that are accessible. These regions of accessible chromatin are candidate regulatory regions. These assays include ATAC-seq, DNase-Seq and FAIRE-Seq.

===At the RNA level===

====Microarrays====
Microarrays measure the amount of mRNA in a sample that corresponds to a given gene or probe DNA sequence. Probe sequences are immobilized on a solid surface and allowed to hybridize with fluorescently labeled &quot;target&quot; mRNA. The intensity of fluorescence of a spot is proportional to the amount of target sequence that has hybridized to that spot and therefore to the abundance of that mRNA sequence in the sample. Microarrays allow for the identification of candidate genes involved in a given process based on variation between transcript levels for different conditions and shared expression patterns with genes of known function.

====SAGE====

Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) is an alternate method of analysis based on RNA sequencing rather than hybridization. SAGE relies on the sequencing of 10–17 base pair tags which are unique to each gene. These tags are produced from poly-A mRNA and ligated end-to-end before sequencing. SAGE gives an unbiased measurement of the number of transcripts per cell, since it does not depend on prior knowledge of what transcripts to study (as microarrays do).

====RNA sequencing====

RNA sequencing has taken over microarray and SAGE technology in recent years, as noted in 2016, and has become the most efficient way to study transcription and gene expression. This is typically done by next-generation sequencing.

A subset of sequenced RNAs are small RNAs, a class of non-coding RNA molecules that are key regulators of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing, or RNA silencing. Next-generation sequencing is the gold standard tool for non-coding RNA discovery, profiling and expression analysis.

====Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs)====
Massively parallel reporter assays is a technology to test the cis-regulatory activity of DNA sequences. MPRAs use a plasmid with a synthetic cis-regulatory element upstream of a promoter driving a synthetic gene such as Green Fluorescent Protein. A library of cis-regulatory elements is usually tested using MPRAs, a library can contain from hundreds to thousands of cis-regulatory elements. The cis-regulatory activity of the elements is assayed by using the downstream reporter activity. The activity of all the library members is assayed in parallel using barcodes for each cis-regulatory element. One limitation of MPRAs is that the activity is assayed on a plasmid and may not capture all aspects of gene regulation observed in the genome.

====STARR-seq====

STARR-seq is a technique similar to MPRAs to assay enhancer activity of randomly sheared genomic fragments. In the original publication, randomly sheared fragments of the &quot;Drosophila&quot; genome were placed downstream of a minimal promoter. Candidate enhancers amongst the randomly sheared fragments will transcribe themselves using the minimal promoter. By using sequencing as a readout and controlling for input amounts of each sequence the strength of putative enhancers are assayed by this method.

====Perturb-seq====

Perturb-seq couples CRISPR mediated gene knockdowns with single-cell gene expression. Linear models are used to calculate the effect of the knockdown of a single gene on the expression of multiple genes.

===At the protein level===

====Yeast two-hybrid system====

A yeast two-hybrid screening (Y2H) tests a &quot;bait&quot; protein against many potential interacting proteins (&quot;prey&quot;) to identify physical protein–protein interactions. This system is based on a transcription factor, originally GAL4, whose separate DNA-binding and transcription activation domains are both required in order for the protein to cause transcription of a reporter gene. In a Y2H screen, the &quot;bait&quot; protein is fused to the binding domain of GAL4, and a library of potential &quot;prey&quot; (interacting) proteins is recombinantly expressed in a vector with the activation domain. In vivo interaction of bait and prey proteins in a yeast cell brings the activation and binding domains of GAL4 close enough together to result in expression of a reporter gene. It is also possible to systematically test a library of bait proteins against a library of prey proteins to identify all possible interactions in a cell.

====MS and AP/MS====

Mass spectrometry (MS) can identify proteins and their relative levels, hence it can be used to study protein expression. When used in combination with affinity purification, mass spectrometry (AP/MS) can be used to study protein complexes, that is, which proteins interact with one another in complexes and in which ratios. In order to purify protein complexes, usually a &quot;bait&quot; protein is tagged with a specific protein or peptide that can be used to pull out the complex from a complex mix. The purification is usually done using an antibody or a compound that binds to the fusion part. The proteins are then digested into short peptide fragments and mass spectrometry is used to identify the proteins based on the mass-to-charge ratios of those fragments.

====Deep mutational scanning====
In deep mutational scanning, every possible amino acid change in a given protein is first synthesized. The activity of each of these protein variants is assayed in parallel using barcodes for each variant. By comparing the activity to the wild-type protein, the effect of each mutation is identified. While it is possible to assay every possible single amino-acid change due to combinatorics two or more concurrent mutations are hard to test. Deep mutational scanning experiments have also been used to infer protein structure and protein-protein interactions. Deep Mutational Scanning is an example of a multiplexed assays of variant effect (MAVEs), a family of methods that involve mutagenesis of a DNA-encoded protein or regulatory element followed by a multiplexed assay for some aspect of function. MAVEs enable the generation of ‘variant effect maps’ characterizing aspects of the function of every possible single nucleotide change in a gene or functional element of interest. 

===Mutagenesis and phenotyping===
An important functional feature of genes is the phenotype caused by mutations. Mutants can be produced by random mutations or by directed mutagenesis, including site-directed mutagenesis, deleting complete genes, or other techniques.

====Knock-outs (gene deletions)====
Gene function can be investigated by systematically &quot;knocking out&quot; genes one by one. This is done by either deletion or disruption of function (such as by insertional mutagenesis) and the resulting organisms are screened for phenotypes that provide clues to the function of the disrupted gene. Knock-outs have been produced for whole genomes, i.e. by deleting all genes in a genome. For essential genes, this is not possible, so other techniques are used, e.g. deleting a gene while expressing the gene from a plasmid, using an inducible promoter, so that the level of gene product can be changed at will (and thus a &quot;functional&quot; deletion achieved).

====Site-directed mutagenesis====
Site-directed mutagenesis is used to mutate specific bases (and thus amino acids). This is critical to investigate the function of specific amino acids in a protein, e.g. in the active site of an enzyme.

====RNAi====

RNA interference (RNAi) methods can be used to transiently silence or knockdown gene expression using ~20 base-pair double-stranded RNA typically delivered by transfection of synthetic ~20-mer short-interfering RNA molecules (siRNAs) or by virally encoded short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). RNAi screens, typically performed in cell culture-based assays or experimental organisms (such as &quot;C. elegans&quot;) can be used to systematically disrupt nearly every gene in a genome or subsets of genes (sub-genomes); possible functions of disrupted genes can be assigned based on observed phenotypes.

====CRISPR screens====

CRISPR-Cas9 has been used to delete genes in a multiplexed manner in cell-lines. Quantifying the amount of guide-RNAs for each gene before and after the experiment can point towards essential genes. If a guide-RNA disrupts an essential gene it will lead to the loss of that cell and hence there will be a depletion of that particular guide-RNA after the screen. In a recent CRISPR-cas9 experiment in mammalian cell-lines, around 2000 genes were found to be essential in multiple cell-lines. Some of these genes were essential in only one cell-line. Most of genes are part of multi-protein complexes. This approach can be used to identify synthetic lethality by using the appropriate genetic background. CRISPRi and CRISPRa enable loss-of-function and gain-of-function screens in a similar manner. CRISPRi identified ~2100 essential genes in the K562 cell-line. CRISPR deletion screens have also been used to identify potential regulatory elements of a gene. For example, a technique called ScanDel was published which attempted this approach. The authors deleted regions outside a gene of interest(HPRT1 involved in a Mendelian disorder) in an attempt to identify regulatory elements of this gene. Gassperini et al. did not identify any distal regulatory elements for HPRT1 using this approach, however such approaches can be extended to other genes of interest.

===Functional annotations for genes===

====Genome annotation====

Putative genes can be identified by scanning a genome for regions likely to encode proteins, based on characteristics such as long open reading frames, transcriptional initiation sequences, and polyadenylation sites. A sequence identified as a putative gene must be confirmed by further evidence, such as similarity to cDNA or EST sequences from the same organism, similarity of the predicted protein sequence to known proteins, association with promoter sequences, or evidence that mutating the sequence produces an observable phenotype.

====Rosetta stone approach====
The Rosetta stone approach is a computational method for de-novo protein function prediction. It is based on the hypothesis that some proteins involved in a given physiological process may exist as two separate genes in one organism and as a single gene in another. Genomes are scanned for sequences that are independent in one organism and in a single open reading frame in another. If two genes have fused, it is predicted that they have similar biological functions that make such co-regulation advantageous.

== Bioinformatics methods for Functional genomics ==
Because of the large quantity of data produced by these techniques and the desire to find biologically meaningful patterns, bioinformatics is crucial to analysis of functional genomics data. Examples of techniques in this class are data clustering or principal component analysis for unsupervised machine learning (class detection) as well as artificial neural networks or support vector machines for supervised machine learning (class prediction, classification). Functional enrichment analysis is used to determine the extent of over- or under-expression (positive- or negative- regulators in case of RNAi screens) of functional categories relative to a background sets. Gene ontology based enrichment analysis are provided by DAVID and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), pathway based analysis by Ingenuity and Pathway studio and protein complex based analysis by COMPLEAT.

New computational methods have been developed for understanding the results of a deep mutational scanning experiment. &#x27;phydms&#x27; compares the result of a deep mutational scanning experiment to a phylogenetic tree. This allows the user to infer if the selection process in nature applies similar constraints on a protein as the results of the deep mutational scan indicate. This may allow an experimenter to choose between different experimental conditions based on how well they reflect nature. Deep mutational scanning has also been used to infer protein-protein interactions. The authors used a thermodynamic model to predict the effects of mutations in different parts of a dimer. Deep mutational structure can also be used to infer protein structure. Strong positive epistasis between two mutations in a deep mutational scan can be indicative of two parts of the protein that are close to each other in 3-D space. This information can then be used to infer protein structure. A proof of principle of this approach was shown by two groups using the protein GB1.

Results from MPRA experiments have required machine learning approaches to interpret the data. A gapped k-mer SVM model has been used to infer the kmers that are enriched within cis-regulatory sequences with high activity compared to sequences with lower activity. These models provide high predictive power. Deep learning and random forest approaches have also been used to interpret the results of these high-dimensional experiments. These models are beginning to help develop a better understanding of non-coding DNA function towards gene-regulation.

==Consortium projects==

=== The ENCODE project ===

The ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA elements) project is an in-depth analysis of the human genome whose goal is to identify all the functional elements of genomic DNA, in both coding and non-coding regions. Important results include evidence from genomic tiling arrays that most nucleotides are transcribed as coding transcripts, non-coding RNAs, or random transcripts, the discovery of additional transcriptional regulatory sites, further elucidation of chromatin-modifying mechanisms.

=== The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project ===

The GTEx project is a human genetics project aimed at understanding the role of genetic variation in shaping variation in the transcriptome across tissues. The project has collected a variety of tissue samples (&gt; 50 different tissues) from more than 700 post-mortem donors. This has resulted in the collection of &gt;11,000 samples. GTEx has helped understand the tissue-sharing and tissue-specificity of eQTLs. The genomic resource was developed to &quot;enrich our understanding of how differences in our DNA sequence contribute to health and disease.&quot;

=== The Atlas of Variant Effects Alliance ===
The Atlas of Variant Effects Alliance (AVE), founded in 2020, is an international consortium aiming to catalog the impact of all possible genetic variants for disease-related functional genomics by creating variant effect maps that reveal the function of every possible single nucleotide change in a gene or regulatory element. AVE is funded in part through the Brotman Baty Institute at the University of Washington and the National Human Genome Research Institute, via funding from the Center of Excellence in Genome Science grant (NHGRI RM1HG010461).

<text>Artamonov is a lunar impact crater on the far side of the Moon. Its eroded outer rim does not have the circular shape of most lunar craters, but the overall shape of three or four merged craters. The largest is in the south, with smaller circular bulges to the north and east.

The crater&#x27;s interior floor has been resurfaced by subsequent flows of basaltic lava, leaving a relatively flat, featureless floor that appears darker due to lower albedo. It is faintly marked by lighter-hued ejecta from the crater Giordano Bruno to the north.

A linear formation of craters designated Catena Artamonov is alongside its northeast rim, following a course to the southeast. Nearby craters of note include Maxwell and Lomonosov to the northwest, and Edison to the west. To the east-northeast is the smaller crater Espin, while the small Malyy formation is to the south-southeast.

Artamov&#x27;s name was approved by the IAU in 1970.

<doc id="1053865" wikidata="Q2544036" url="?curid=1053865" title="Hinchinbrook Island">
<text>Hinchinbrook Island (or Pouandai to the Biyaygiri people) is an island in the Cassowary Coast Region, Queensland, Australia. It lies east of Cardwell and north of Lucinda, separated from the north-eastern coast of Queensland by the narrow Hinchinbrook Channel. Hinchinbrook Island is part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and wholly protected within the Hinchinbrook Island National Park, except for a small and abandoned resort. It is the largest island on the Great Barrier Reef. It is also the largest island national park in Australia.

==Natural heritage==


Hinchinbrook Island is made up of late Palaeozoic igneous rocks. The main pluton in the east of the island, the Hinchinbrook Granite, is composed of various hypersolvus granites and intrudes volcanics, granodiorites, and granites. The island and coastal ranges are thought to have been thrust up as blocks with subsidence between them to form the coastal plain with the summit level of the island being an older dissected surface that has been uplifted to approximately or more above sea level. The Hinchinbrook Channel that separates the island from the mainland is considered to be fault controlled.

Since the last Ice Age 18,000 years ago sea level has risen. Once there was a significant rugged coastal range, now there is Hinchinbrook Island. To the west is the mangrove-fringed Hinchinbrook Channel with of robust mangrove estuaries. The channel is the valley of the Herbert River flooded following the last glacial period. The island is only separated from the mainland at times of high sea-level such as the present and is thought to have had dry land connections to the mainland for most of the past few million years. Further west is the Cardwell Range Escarpment rainforest. East of Hinchinbrook Island lies the Coral Sea, Great Barrier Reef Lagoon and Great Barrier Reef.

To the north of Hinchinbrook Island, Rockingham Bay hosts densely vegetated continental islands, e.g., Garden Island, Goold Island, Brook Islands Group, Family Island Group, Bedarra Island and Dunk Island east of Mission Beach. South of Hinchinbrook Island, the Cardwell Range gives way to the Herbert River floodplain and delta.

Missionary Bay is at the northern end of Hinchinbrook Island National Park. Natural features of this biodiverse area include of dense mangrove communities lining the shoreline. Many botanists believe the mangrove forests along the island&#x27;s western coast are the most diverse in the country. 31 different species of mangrove has been identified. A shallow subhorizontal tidal zone has extensive offshore sea grass beds grazed by dugong. The beach stone-curlew thrives on the island, unlike on mainland beaches because vehicles are banned.

The eastern coastline of Hinchinbrook Island is punctuated with headland outcrops, incised drainage conduits, forest, secluded sandy pocket beaches and sand dunes. Mangroves are in proximity to freshwater streams. At Ramsay Bay on the northeast coast, a transgressive dune barrier or tombolo links Cape Sandwich, a granite outlier at the northeastern tip of the island, to the main part of the island. The barrier is widest in the north with a maximum width of about and narrows to the south to a width of about . The barrier, which consists mainly of aeolian sands, extends more than below the present sea level in places. It is thought to have been formed in two major episodes, the older dunes being partly drowned during an early Holocene marine transgression (9500-6000 C-14 years BP) with the later generation of dunes forming within the last 900 C-14 years BP.

Hinchinbrook Island is described as a &quot;wilderness area,&quot; wild and rugged with soaring mountainous peaks. Hinchinbrook Island&#x27;s highest mountain is Mount Bowen, above sea level. Other notable mountain summits are The Thumb (), Mount Diamantina () and Mount Straloch (). Terrestrial vegetation types include thick shrubs, heath, bushland and forest. The island habitat provides refuge for numerous endangered species, both flora and fauna such as the giant tree frog.

The local climate is tropical, warm to mildly cool and dry during the winter months. The summer monsoon wet is warm to hot and humid, coinciding with the tropical cyclone season. The island has no reefs in the waters surrounding it, most likely due to fresh water runoff from the island.

==History==
Hinchinbrook Island or Pouandai was originally inhabited by the indigenous Biyaygiri people.

&quot;Warrgamay&quot; (also known as &quot;Waragamai&quot;, &quot;Wargamay&quot;, &quot;Wargamaygan&quot;, &quot;Biyay&quot;, and &quot;Warakamai&quot;) is an Australian Aboriginal language in North Queensland. The language region includes the Herbert River area, Ingham, Hawkins Creek, Long Pocket, Herbert Vale, Niagara Vale, Yamanic Creek, Herbert Gorge, Cardwell, Hinchinbrook Island and the adjacent mainland.

Shell middens and fish traps are evidence of their activities. Fish were an important source of food for Aboriginal people living in the area. The Bandjin fish trap rock formations exploited the cyclic tidal regime, not only capturing fish, but also holding their catch alive for days. At times, many fish would be caught in the traps. These fish would not be killed nor eaten, instead they were left for the birds. To this day the traps still capture fish, which feed the local birds.

In 1770, British Captain James Cook on sailed past at some distance to the east, naming Mount Hinchinbrook without realising that it was an island. Lieutenant Phillip Parker King on his surveying voyage in 1819 suspected it was separated from the mainland but could not confirm this. It was not until 1843, when Captain Blackwood on stayed two weeks in the area, that the British were able to verify that it was a distinct landmass, naming it Hinchinbrook Island. The name is from Hinchingbrooke House, in Huntingdon, England, as John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich was First Lord of the Admiralty, and the naming of Hinchinbrook Island, Brampton Island and Montague Island in the South Sandwich Islands are evidence of the early explorers&#x27; gratitude to the 4th Earl.

Early interactions between British navigators and the Biyaygiri were mostly amicable. Lieutenant Jeffreys of landed there in 1815 as did Lieutenant P.P. King in 1819 and both reported friendly dealings with the indigenous population. In his 1843 voyage, Captain Blackwood of HMS &quot;Fly&quot; also had peaceful communications with the Biyaygiri initially, but conflict occurred on several occasions when the sailors were pelted with rocks, resulting in a number of islanders being shot.

Following the establishment of the township of Cardwell in 1864 on the mainland across from Hinchinbrook, relations with the Biyaygiri soon deteriorated. Inspector John Murray of the Native Police led a group of settlers and troopers on a month long expedition through the island in 1867, bringing some Aboriginal people back to their camp and ship to question them for information about some possible shipwreck survivors. In 1872, after the murder and mutilation of two white fishermen at nearby Goold Island, a large expedition led by sub-Inspector Robert Arthur Johnstone scoured Hinchinbrook Island to locate the perpetrators, returning with three captured young Indigenous children. A visitor to Cardwell at the time reported that one of these children was violated by the police and that the settlers openly talked of &quot;the slaughter of whole camps not only of men, but of women and children&quot;. Through violent incidents such as these, the population of Hichinbrook Island was rapidly reduced to a handful of survivors. Reverend Edward Fuller attempted to set up a mission on the island in 1874 but was forced to abandon it after being informed of the massacres and consequently not seeing any Aboriginal people in nine months living there.

In the following decades Europeans settled on Hinchinbrook Island. Their main activities were fishing, farming and mining. In 1932, Hinchinbrook Island was declared a national park. In 1942, during World War II, an American B-24 Liberator bomber of the United States Army Air Force crashed into Mount Straloch, a mountain on the island, killing all 12 crewmen on board. After World War II, commercial crocodile hunting in the area reduced numbers nearly to the point of extinction by the 1960s.

The 2008 feature movie &quot;Nim&#x27;s Island&quot; was partly filmed on the island.

==Tourism==
The island had a single provider of accommodation called the Hinchinbrook Island Wilderness Lodge; however, it closed in 2010 as a result of financial difficulties caused by the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Several months later it was struck by Cyclone Yasi. The infrastructure has since been looted and left to decay. It is located on the northeastern corner of the island at Cape Richards.

===Destinations and regulations===
Hinchinbrook Island, Hinchinbrook Channel and the coastal plain south to the Herbert River Delta(Lucinda) is a unique biogeographical region.

Along the east coast of the island is the long Thorsborne Trail, which is typically done over 3–4 days. The trail was named in honour of environmental activists Arthur and Margaret Thorsborne.

Marine nature based activities include sightseeing cruises, sailing, outrigger canoeing, swimming, snorkelling and scuba diving. Sea kayaking is possible east of Hinchinbrook Island; west, the island is known saltwater crocodile habitat.

Hinchinbrook Island camping is by permit only. Visitor numbers to the island is restricted. The aim is to preserve the island&#x27;s biodiversity and limit environmental degradation. Open fires are not permitted.

===Access===
The Bruce Highway connects Townsville, Lucinda, Cardwell, and Cairns. Locally the Bruce Highway within Cardwell town limits is known as Victoria Street. Regular scheduled coach services operate from the transit zone in Brasenose Street, Cardwell and Townsville Road in Ingham. Hinchinbrook resorts and Helloworld in Ingham run bus shuttles to Townsville and return to Lucinda for people hiking the Thorsborne Trail. Queensland Rail has regular services operating, transiting from the Cardwell Rail Station in Bowen Street.

==Shipwreck==
In 2011, the shipwreck of a longboat was discovered on the shores of Ramsay Bay by a fisherman. It is thought that the wreck is about 130 years old and was uncovered by Cyclone Yasi.

<text>Asclepi is a heavily eroded lunar impact crater that lies in the rugged southern highlands of the Moon. The outer rim has been worn down and rounded by many millions of years of subsequent impacts, so that it is now nearly level with the surrounding terrain. As a result, the crater is now little more than a depression in the surface. The interior is nearly flat and relatively featureless.

The rim of Asclepi is marked only by a small crater across the western rim, and several tiny craterlets. The satellite crater Hommel K is a more recent impact that is attached to the southeast rim. This is a bowl-shaped formation with a sharp edge and a small central floor.

Nearby craters of note include Pitiscus to the north-northeast, Hommel due east, and Baco to the northwest. To the west-southwest is the smaller crater Tannerus.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Asclepi.

<doc id="1053868" wikidata="Q3124909" url="?curid=1053868" title="HMAS Arunta (FFH 151)">
<text>HMAS &quot;Arunta&quot; (FFH 151) is an &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigate of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The ship, named for the Arrernte people, was laid down in 1995 and commissioned in 1998. Since entering service, &quot;Arunta&quot; has performed a wide range of duties, including border protection patrols in northern Australian waters, and several deployments to the Persian Gulf.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Anzac&quot; class originated from RAN plans to replace the six River-class destroyer escorts with a mid-capability patrol frigate. The Australian shipbuilding industry was thought to be incapable of warship design, so the RAN decided to take a proven foreign design and modify it. Around the same time, the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) was looking to replace four &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates; a deterioration in New Zealand-United States relations, the need to improve alliances with nearby nations, and the commonalities between the RAN and RNZN ships&#x27; requirements led the two nations to begin collaborating on the acquisition in 1987. Tenders were requested by the Anzac Ship Project at the end of 1986, with 12 ship designs (including an airship) submitted. By August 1987, the tenders were narrowed down in October to Blohm + Voss&#x27;s MEKO 200 design, the M class (later &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; class) offered by Royal Schelde, and a scaled-down Type 23 frigate proposed by Yarrow Shipbuilders. In 1989, the Australian government announced that Melbourne-based shipbuilder AMECON (which became Tenix Defence) would build the modified MEKO 200 design. The Australians ordered eight ships, while New Zealand ordered two, with an unexercised option for two more.

The &quot;Anzac&quot;s are based on Blohm + Voss&#x27; MEKO 200 PN (or &quot;Vasco da Gama&quot; class) frigates, modified to meet Australian and New Zealand specifications and maximise the use of locally built equipment. Each frigate has a full load displacement. The ships are long at the waterline, and long overall, with a beam of , and a full load draught of . A Combined Diesel or Gas (CODOG) propulsion machinery layout is used, with a single, General Electric LM2500-30 gas turbine and two MTU 12V1163 TB83 diesel engines driving the ship&#x27;s two controllable-pitch propellers. Maximum speed is , and maximum range is over at ; about 50% greater than other MEKO 200 designs. The standard ship&#x27;s company of an &quot;Anzac&quot; consists of 22 officers and 141 sailors.

As designed, the main armament for the frigate is a 5-inch 54 calibre Mark 45 gun, supplemented by an eight-cell Mark 41 vertical launch system (for RIM-7 Sea Sparrow or RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles), two machine guns, and two Mark 32 triple torpedo tube sets (initially firing Mark 46 torpedoes, but later upgraded to use the MU90 Impact torpedo). They were also designed for but not with a close-in weapons system (two Mini Typhoons fitted when required from 2005 onwards), two quad-canister Harpoon anti-ship missile launchers (which were installed across the RAN vessels from 2005 onwards), and a second Mark 41 launcher (which has not been added). The Australian &quot;Anzac&quot;s use a Sikorsky S-70B-2 Seahawk helicopter; plans to replace them with Kaman SH-2G Super Seasprites were cancelled in 2008 due to ongoing problems.

&quot;Arunta&quot; was laid down at Williamstown, Victoria on 22 July 1995. The ship was assembled from six hull modules and six superstructure modules; the superstructure modules were fabricated in Whangarei, New Zealand, and hull modules were built at both Williamstown and Newcastle, New South Wales, with final integration at Williamstown. She was launched on 28 June 1996 by Dulce Morrow, wife of the first commanding officer of the first &quot;Arunta&quot;. The ship was commissioned on 12 December 1998. The spelling of the ship&#x27;s name is not consistent with that used by the Arrernte people, who the previous ship was named after; correcting it was considered, but the RAN decided to use the same spelling as the previous ship. Had the New Zealand government exercised their option for two more frigates, &quot;Arunta&quot; was one of the ships that would have been designated for the RNZN.

In 2000, &quot;Arunta&quot; conducted a North East Asian deployment including Exercise RIMPAC based in Hawaii. During a port visit to Suva, Fiji at the beginning of the deployment, crew members using fireworks from hotel balconies inadvertently set in motion the 2000 Fiji coup which went into full motion the following day, after &quot;Arunta&quot; had sailed from port. During an interview from prison in 2015, George Speight, who led the coup, was quoted as saying: &quot;Those dopey sailors nearly ruined everything. The only reason we didn&#x27;t hit Uncle Frank that night was because he was drinking with them at the naval base. When the fireworks went off my crew thought it was the signal to move on parliament and the military leadership but they couldn&#x27;t find anyone. From that point we just had to commit but be careful not to involve the Australian Navy.&quot;

In September 2001, &quot;Arunta&quot; deployed to northern Australian waters in the wake of the Tampa affair. The ship participated in Operation Gaberdine and Operation Relex in two separate deployments. During the second deployment &quot;Arunta&quot; was involved in the interception and/or return of Suspected Illegal Entry Vessels (SIEV) 6, 7, and 9.
In 2002, &quot;Arunta&quot; saw active service for the first time when she participated as part of the third rotation of RAN ships to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Slipper. The ship was involved in the enforcement of United Nations sanctions against Iraq, and at the time operated closer to the Iraqi coast than any other ship of the International Coalition Against Terrorism force. The ship&#x27;s boarding parties effected 377 boardings during her four months on station.

On 12 November 2007, &quot;Arunta&quot; deployed for her second tour of active service in the Persian Gulf, as part of Operation Catalyst. The ship&#x27;s role was to contribute to the protection of Iraqi oil platforms, security boardings of all vessels proceeding to the platforms and training of the Iraqi Navy. The ship returned from this deployment on 11 May 2008.

On 19 December 2008, &quot;Arunta&quot; was dispatched from Fremantle to rescue injured yachtsman Yann Elies, who was participating in the Vendée Globe, a solo round-the-world yacht race. Elies was stranded southwest of Perth, when his leg was broken in heavy seas.

Following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, completed in March 2010, &quot;Arunta&quot; was retroactively awarded the honour &quot;Persian Gulf 2001–02&quot;.

In June 2014, modifications to &quot;Arunta&quot; as part of the Anti-Ship Missile Defence Project upgrade were completed. &quot;Arunta&quot; was the second ship of the class to be upgraded, with the installation of a CEAFAR Phased Array Radar and an upgraded SAAB Combat Management System, among other modifications, during an 18-month refit. The ship commenced post-refit sea trials at the end of June.

In July 2017 the &quot;Arunta&quot; was deployed in the Middle East for nine months as part of Operation Manitou. &quot;Arunta&quot; was the first vessel in the RAN to conduct an extended patrol in the region and the 64th Australian vessel deployed to the region since 1990. During November 2020 the ship took part in efforts to enforce sanctions against North Korea as part of Operation Argos.

In early 2021 &quot;Arunta&quot;″s crew were transferred to in order to reactivate that frigate after it had been out of service for a lengthy period.

<text>HMAS &quot;Arunta&quot; (I30/D5/D130) was a destroyer of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Named for the Arrernte Aboriginal peoples, the destroyer was laid down in 1939 and commissioned into the RAN in 1942.

&quot;Arunta&quot; fought during the second half of World War II; initially as a convoy escort and patrol ship, then in the shore bombardment and amphibious landing support roles while attached to the United States 7th Fleet. During the war, she was responsible for sinking Japanese submarine off Port Moresby on 24 August 1942, and earned five battle honours (one of which was later rescinded). After the war&#x27;s end, &quot;Arunta&quot; underwent two deployments to Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force.

The ship underwent a lengthy modernisation from 1949 to 1952, and was reclassified as an anti-submarine destroyer. After conversion, &quot;Arunta&quot; served in Korean waters after the Korean War armistice, and was one of the first Australian warships assigned to the Far East Strategic Reserve.

&quot;Arunta&quot; was paid off into operational reserve at the end of 1956, where she remained for twelve years. In 1968, the destroyer was sold for scrap, but was never broken up, instead sinking while under tow off Broken Bay on 13 February 1969.

== Description ==
At launch, the destroyer was fitted with six guns in three twin turrets, two guns in a twin turret, six single Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns, a 2-pounder quadruple pom pom, a 4-tube torpedo launcher (with a payload of four torpedoes), and two depth charge throwers (with a magazine of 46 charges). &quot;Arunta&quot;″s radar suite consisted of an SG1, an SG4, a 285P4, and a 253P.

In September 1945, all six Oerlikons were replaced with single Bofors anti-aircraft guns.

During a modernisation starting in 1949, the aft 4.7-inch gun turret and the depth charge throwers were removed, with the freed-up deck space used to install a Squid anti-submarine mortar. The quadruple pom pom was exchanged for two 40 mm Bofors in a twin mounting. The radar suite was upgraded, requiring that the tripod radar mast be replaced with a stronger lattice structure.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Arunta&quot;, named for the Arrernte Aborigines, was ordered by the Naval Board January 1939 and laid down by the Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company Limited at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, Sydney in New South Wales on 15 November 1939. She was the first of three Australian Tribal class destroyers.

The destroyer was launched on 30 November 1940 by Lady Zara Gowrie, wife of the serving Governor-General, but became stuck halfway down the slipway, requiring the launching ceremony to be completed the next day. Completed at a cost of AU£500,000, &quot;Arunta&quot; was commissioned into the RAN on 30 March 1942, exactly a month before work on the ship was completed.

===World War II===
&quot;Arunta&quot; commenced her operational career on 17 May 1942, by conducting anti-submarine patrols off New South Wales. Those included a specific search based on sightings and attack by gunfire on the Russian vessel &quot;Wellen&quot; on 16 May in which &quot;Arunta&quot;, and searched without success for the submarine. On 18 May, in company with &quot;Tromp&quot;, &quot;Arunta&quot; escorted convoy &quot;ZK.8&quot; out of Sydney composed of the Dutch ships , , and bound for Port Moresby with 4,735 troops of the Australian 14th Brigade.

A month later, the destroyer was assigned to convoy escort duties along the Australian coast, and again began escorting convoys to New Guinea in early August. In this role she first saw action when she attacked and sank the Japanese &quot;Kaichū&quot; type submarine off Port Moresby on 24 August 1942, killing all 42 men aboard.

On 4 September 1942 &quot;Arunta&quot; departed Port Moresby to join the cargo ship and the Dutch steamer escorted by and that had departed from Townsville as convoy &quot;Q2&quot; bound for Milne Bay with supplies for the garrison there. &quot;Anshun&quot; and &quot;Arunta&quot; entered the bay on the morning of 6 September where the freighter berthed at the pontoon jetty at Gili Gili to begin unloading with intentions to put to sea for safety during the night but orders were given by local authorities to continue unloading under her cargo lights through the night while &quot;Arunta&quot; departed to join &quot; &#x27;s Jacob&quot; and &quot;Swan&quot; holding at sea to the south. &quot;Anshun&quot; was sunk that night when she came under fire from the Japanese cruiser &quot;Tenryū&quot; and destroyer &quot;Arashi&quot; during the battle of Milne Bay.

In January 1943, &quot;Arunta&quot; took part in the evacuation of Allied guerrillas from Timor before returning to convoy escort duty. The destroyer was relieved from convoy duty in May 1943, and underwent a brief refit before joining Task Force 74 (TF74).

&quot;Arunta&quot; participated in the Operation Chronicle landings, then detached from TF74 in July and returned to Australian waters for patrol and convoy escort duties and a refit, before rejoining the task force at Brisbane on 29 October 1943. By 5 November the task force, composed of , , , , &quot;Arunta&quot; and , was in Milne Bay.
In late November, &quot;Arunta&quot; fired on Japanese ammunition dumps in New Guinea, before providing support for troop landings at Arawe, Cape Gloucester, and Saidor during December 1943 and January 1944. In March, the destroyer transported the United States 7th Cavalry to the Admiralty Islands, before supporting their landing at Hayne Harbour. From April to September, &quot;Arunta&quot; provided bombardment support for troop landings at Hollandia, Wakde (where she captured a Japanese soldier), Biak, Noemfoor, Cape Sansapor, and Morotai. On 13 October, &quot;Arunta&quot; formed part of the Allied fleet bound for Leyte Gulf in the Philippines, and was part of the Allied ambush of a Japanese fleet on 25 October; the Battle of Surigao Strait. During January 1945, &quot;Arunta&quot; supported the landings at Lingayen Gulf; during the approach a near-miss by a Japanese kamikaze aircraft killed two sailors. Between 13 and 15 February &quot;Arunta&quot; and her sister ship sortied from Lingayen Gulf to a point about west of Manila in preparation to rescue the crews of any United States aircraft which were downed while attacking two Japanese battleships and their escorts which were returning to Japan from Singapore, but this proved uneventful as the planned attacks were frustrated by bad weather.

Following a refit from March to April, &quot;Arunta&quot; supported the Australian 6th Division on 10–11 May during their landing at Wewak, then provided shore bombardment to aid the 9th Division&#x27;s landing at Brunei Bay on 10 June. Later in June, she shelled positions in Luton and Balikpapan, the latter as a precursor to the Allied landing on 1 July. &quot;Arunta&quot; then returned to Sydney for a refit at Cockatoo Island, and was docked when World War II ended.

For her wartime service, &quot;Arunta&quot; earned the battle honours &quot;Pacific 1942–45&quot;, &quot;New Guinea 1942–44&quot;, &quot;Leyte Gulf 1944&quot;, &quot;Lingayen Gulf 1945&quot;, and &quot;Borneo 1945&quot;. The ship also carried the honour &quot;Guadalcanal 1942&quot;, but it was later determined that she did not qualify. It was later found that the destroyer did not qualify for the Guadalcanal honour, and that her service in the Pacific Theatre started in 1942, requiring the modification of these honours. &quot;Arunta&quot; operated with task forces of the United States 7th Fleet for most of her wartime career: according to Cassells, the destroyer was one of the most well-known RAN ships among United States forces.

===Post-war===
Following her refit, which concluded in October 1945, &quot;Arunta&quot; was sent to Japan to serve with the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. She remained in Japanese waters until March 1946, and returned in mid-December after a cruise through Papua New Guinea and the Philippines for a second deployment with the BPF, which lasted until early April 1947. In June 1948, &quot;Arunta&quot; visited several Melanesian islands. At the end of 1949, the destroyer prepared for a modernisation refit, which started in 1950. The refit involved upgrading or replacing several of the destroyer&#x27;s weapons and sensor systems. Although the modernisation was intended to take less than six months, it took two years, by which time their modifications had already become obsolete.
On 11 November 1952, &quot;Arunta&quot; was reclassified as an anti-submarine destroyer, and re-entered service. She spent all of 1953 in Australian waters, and in January 1954 sailed to Korea to support the United Nations enforcement of the June 1953 armistice which ended the Korean War. &quot;Arunta&quot; returned to Australia in August, and remained there until May 1955, when she joined a flotilla of RAN and Royal New Zealand Navy vessels sailing to Malaya for exercises with the BPF. Instead of returning home in late June, &quot;Arunta&quot; and &quot;Warramunga&quot; were refitted at Singapore before becoming the first Australian ships to serve with the Far East Strategic Reserve, which they operated with until December. &quot;Arunta&quot; was deployed to northern Australia for a cruise during March and April 1956, and visited Norfolk Island and the Pitcairn Islands in June, before arriving in Sydney on 14 June for preparations to be decommissioned.

==Decommissioning and fate==
After being prepared for placement in operational reserve, &quot;Arunta&quot; paid off to reserve on 21 December 1956. During her career, she had sailed . The destroyer was maintained until 1 November 1968, when she was sold to the China Steel Corporation of Taipei for breaking up as scrap metal.

&quot;Arunta&quot; was taken under tow by the Japanese tug &quot;Tokyo Maru&quot; on 12 February 1969. On 13 February, the ship began to take on water; although there were attempts to stop the flooding, it was decided that recovery would be impossible, and &quot;Arunta&quot; was allowed to capsize and sink off Broken Bay.

<text>Ashbrook is a large lunar impact crater that is located in the vicinity of the south pole on the far side of the Moon, and so cannot be viewed directly from the Earth. The eastern face of the crater has been overlain by the similar-sized Drygalski, and more than half the interior floor of Ashbrook is covered by the outer s and ejecta of Drygalski. To the northwest is the walled plain Zeeman.

The surviving outer rim of Ashbrook is worn and eroded by subsequent impacts, although much of the original formation is still visible. If the crater once possessed a central peak, it is now buried by the ejecta from Drygalski. Only a section of the interior floor near the southwest rim is flat, being marked only by tiny craterlets.

This crater was previously designated Drygalski Q before being assigned a name by the IAU.

<text>Dr. Rebekah Colberg Cabrera (December 25, 1918 – July 8, 1985), was a Puerto Rican athlete, who was known as &quot;The Mother of Women&#x27;s Sports in Puerto Rico&quot;. Colberg participated in various athletic competitions in the 1938 Central American and Caribbean Games celebrated in Panama where she won the gold medals in Discus and Javelin throw.

==Early years==
Rebekah Colberg Cabrera was born on December 25, 1918, in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico to Vicente Lupercio Colberg Pabón, a pharmacy technician, and María Providencia Cabrera Ramírez de Arellano, a housewife. Her great-great-grandmother was the sister of the early-19th century Puerto Rican pirate Roberto Cofresí Ramírez de Arellano. Colberg was born two months premature when her mother was just seven months pregnant. Colberg, whose birth weight was only four pounds during birth, would later break sports barriers for Puerto Rican women. Even though there used to be a lot of discrimination in sports against women, Colberg was to prove that women did have the potential to be great athletes, if given the chance.

Colberg graduated from the University of Puerto Rico with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in science and pharmacy. She received her Masters in physical education from Columbia University in New York and her Doctorate in medicine from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).

==Sports accomplishments==
From 1932 to 1946, for fourteen consecutive years, Colberg was Puerto Rico&#x27;s tennis champion. In 1938, she won two gold medals at the IV Central American and Caribbean Games, celebrated in Panama, in the discus and javelin throw events. In 1946, when the games were celebrated in Barranquilla, Colombia, she won a gold medal in softball. While studying for her master&#x27;s degree at Columbia University, she was in the university&#x27;s field hockey and lacrosse championship teams. She was also a member of the undefeated women&#x27;s basketball team of the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

==Later years==

In 1952, Colberg was inducted into the Puerto Rican Athletic Hall of Fame and the Puerto Rican Tennis Hall of Fame. She is considered by many as the greatest woman athlete to have been born in Puerto Rico. Her cousin, the late Severo Colberg Ramirez, was the Speaker of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives (Cámara de Representantes) from 1982 to 1985. Colberg died on July 8, 1985, in her native town and is buried in the Old San Juan Cemetery, Cementerio Santa Maria Magdalena de Pazzis.

==Honors==
The City of Cabo Rojo honored Colberg&#x27;s memory by naming a Coliseum after her (which became, in 1989, the home of what was Cabo Rojo&#x27;s BSN team), and in Rio Piedras there is also a Rebekah Colberg Multi-sports Gym.

On May 29, 2014, The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico honored 12 illustrious women with plaques in the &quot;La Plaza en Honor a la Mujer Puertorriqueña&quot; (Plaza in Honor of Puerto Rican Women) in San Juan. According to the plaques the following 12 women, who by virtue of their merits and legacies, stand out in the history of Puerto Rico. Colberg was among those who were honored.

<text>Aston is a lunar impact crater that is located along the northwest limb of the Moon. It is named after scientist Francis William Aston who invented the mass spectrometer and used it to discover many of the stable isotopes. Aston was a keen amateur astronomer with a particular interest in solar eclipses.

Because of its location the crater is seen nearly from on edge, and visibility is subject to libration. It lies to the east of the crater Röntgen, some distance due west of Ulugh Beigh on the edge of the Oceanus Procellarum. To the south is the crater Voskresenskiy.

The rim of Aston has been worn down and rounded due to subsequent impacts. It forms a circular shape that has not been significantly altered by nearby impacts. The interior floor is relatively flat and featureless, with no central peak of significance.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Aston.

<text>Atwood is a small earth moon impact crater that is located on the Mare Fecunditatis, to the northwest of the prominent crater Langrenus. It forms a triple-crater formation with Naonobu attached to the north rim and Bilharz near the west rim.

Atwood lies near the edge of the outer s of Langrenus, and the &quot;ejecta&quot; forms low ridges attached to the south rim of Atwood. Within the crater interior is a low central peak that joins a ridge line to the north rim of the crater.

Atwood was formerly designated Langrenus K, before being renamed by the IAU in 1976.

<text>Auwers is a small lunar impact crater located in the Montes Haemus mountain range at the south edge of Mare Serenitatis. It is named after German astronomer Arthur Auwers. It lies southeast of the crater Menelaus. The irregular rim of Auwers has a gap at the north-northwest edge, which allowed lava flows to reach the crater floor and flood the interior.

<text>Avicenna is a lunar impact crater that lies on the far side of the Moon, just beyond the western limb on the northern rim of the Lorentz basin. It is named after the Persian polymath Avicenna. It lies to the north-northwest of the larger crater Nernst, and to the southeast of Bragg.

The northern half of Avicenna has been obliterated by subsequent, overlapping impacts. The southern and southeastern rim is worn and eroded, but the outline can still be discerned. There is a small crater lying across the southern rim, although this formation is equally worn. Several small craters lie across the southern extent of Avicenna&#x27;s floor.

Prior to formal naming by the IAU in 1970, Avicenna was called &quot;Crater 180&quot;.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Avicenna.

<doc id="1053905" wikidata="Q1052829" url="?curid=1053905" title="Celebrity Deathmatch">
<text>Celebrity Deathmatch is an adult stop-motion claymated series created by Eric Fogel and produced by John Worth Lynn Jr. for MTV. A parody of sports entertainment programs, &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; depicted various celebrities engaging in highly stylized professional wrestling matches. The series was known for its large amount of gory violence, including combatants employing different abilities and weapons to deliver particularly brutal attacks, resulting in exaggerated physical injuries.

Two television pilots were broadcast on MTV on January 1 and 25, 1998. The series properly premiered on May 14, 1998, and ended on June 6, 2002, airing for 93 episodes. A series of German shorts, &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch Hits Germany&quot;, aired on June 21, 2001, but it was poorly received from the fans, which was rumored to be the source of the show&#x27;s cancellation. For a brief period during that year, reruns of the series aired on broadcast network UPN. Early in 2003, a film based on the series was announced by MTV to be in production, but the project was canceled by the end of the year.

In 2005, MTV2 announced the revival of the show as part of their Sic &#x27;Em Friday programming block. Originally set to return in November 2005, the premiere was pushed back to June 10, 2006 as part of a block with two other animated series, &quot;Where My Dogs At?&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Chico and Guapo&quot;. The revival series was produced without any involvement from Fogel. While the first four seasons were animated by Fogelmania Productions and TakToon Enterprise, the series&#x27; fifth and sixth seasons were produced by Cuppa Coffee Studios, and the premiere drew over 2.5 million viewers, becoming MTV2&#x27;s highest rated season premiere ever. It was canceled again in 2007.

In April 2015, MTV2 announced a reboot of the series. However, in November 2016, Fogel stated via Twitter that MTV did not pick up the pilot to the series.

On December 6, 2018, MTV Studios announced a reimagining of the show was set to return in 2019 with Ice Cube as star and executive producer. However, no announcements, updates, nor new information have surfaced since the announcement and it has been speculated to have been quietly cancelled. As of 2025, the revival from 2006 is available to watch on Paramount+.

==Characters==

===Main characters===
* Johnny Gomez (Maurice Schlafer, 1998–2002), (Jim Thornton, 2006-07): One of the two joint commentators on the &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot;es, Johnny is the more professional one, and a loyal friend of Nick&#x27;s, despite his constant blunders. He only lost his professionalism once to Lenny Stanton, the producer&#x27;s son and nearly lost it a second time concerning interviewer Tally Wong. Johnny&#x27;s hair has noticeably changed from black to brown in the new season. Judging by a comment made by Tally during one episode, he may be wearing a hairpiece. Johnny harbors an intense hatred for her akin to Nick and Debbie, but tries to maintain being a professional. He was born in Illinois. Johnny would often end the episodes with his catchphrase &quot;good fight, good night&quot;. Johnny bears a striking resemblance to Mike Adamle, a former professional football player and sports announcer, who was a host for the original &quot;American Gladiators&quot;.
* Nick Diamond (Len Maxwell, 1998–2002), (Chris Edgerly, 2006-07): Johnny Gomez&#x27;s co-host, a perceived alcoholic and divorced father of one who is known to make on-air gaffes and errors, and will occasionally take his son to work. He harbors an intense hatred for interviewer Debbie Matenopoulos, and has also participated in, and won, several matches by himself. Nick is so hopeless that when he mentions having an uneventful weekend, Johnny spends the show preparing for the inevitable disaster to soon befall his co-commentator. He was born in Virginia. Nick bears a striking resemblance to Larry Csonka, an NFL legend who also commentated on &quot;American Gladiators&quot;. 
* Mills Lane (himself, 1998–2002), (Chris Edgerly, 2006-07): The official referee of the Deathmatch ring; he always starts matches by saying &quot;Let&#x27;s get it on!&quot; and shows that this is one referee that cannot be knocked down with one hit. Another catchphrase is when there is a disputable move by either fighter, like using foreign objects, and he says &quot;I&#x27;ll allow it!&quot; implying that just about anything is legal in the ring. Biting and guns are his only no-go moves by the fighters, and he prefers the ring to remain as clean as possible. After he suffered a stroke in 2002, the real Mills stopped providing the voice of his own character but gave Edgerly his blessing.

===Minor regular characters===
* Stacey Cornbred (Leslie Shuman): The first interviewer on &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot;, Stacey was more neutral and professional than Tally, Debbie and Marv. She remained until a sudden death from spontaneous human combustion. Though she had exploded, she briefly returned in a Halloween episode as a zombie to challenge Debbie in the ring only to be soundly (and messily) defeated.
* Debbie Matenopoulos (herself): The interviewer that succeeded Stacey Cornbred after her death. She hates Nick and does not prepare for any interviews, usually just asking whatever she feels like. Debbie often believes herself to be smarter than she really is, but her personality is self-centered and unprofessional. She left the show late in the 4th season on maternity leave. Debbie is similar to Tally in the way they act and behave during interviews.
* Tally Wong (Masasa Moyo): The new interviewer from Season 5 onward. Before most of the matches, she interviews the combatants in a segment called &quot;Tally&#x27;s Korner&quot;. Like Debbie, Tally is very self-centered and unprofessional. She usually spends most of her interviews insulting the celebrities rather than asking questions. The only time Tally does ask questions, she often asks whatever she feels like asking and when they refuse to answer, she makes rude remarks about them. At times, she makes rude remarks about Nick and Johnny during matches, earning her their ire, including making remarks about them wearing hairpieces. Whenever Nick or Johnny gets mad at her for it, she taunts them by daring them to &quot;bring back Stacey Cornbred.&quot; Tally harbors an intense hatred toward Johnny Gomez, which proves to be mutual. Ironically though, this was the inverse in the previous show with Nick Diamond&#x27;s loathing of Debbie.
* Stone Cold Steve Austin (himself): World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) wrestler and guest commentator on &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot;. Also the scientist, doctor and weapons expert on the show. He also fought and won a match against Vince McMahon (voiced by McMahon himself, and whom Austin would actually wrestle with on several WWE events in real life). Although he had a prominent role throughout seasons 1 to 4, Austin did not show up in the revival of the series, for Nick has once stated that he was too expensive to bring back.
* Phil the popcorn guy (John Worth Lynn, Jr) (Jim Conroy): A running gag; usually among the first victims in the audience when a Deathmatch gets too brutal to stay in the ring. Since his second season appearance, the vendor has been burned, chopped up, and even possessed by a demon at various points, only to come back again healthy in his next appearance.
* Nicky Diamond Jr., (Brendan Muller): Nick&#x27;s son, who appeared in several episodes. In one episode he was possessed by a demon called &quot;Captain Doody,&quot; but was delivered when The Undertaker executed a Tombstone Piledriver on the possessed Nicky during their bout, causing the demon to leave Nicky and enter the hapless popcorn salesman.

==Production==

&quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; started in 1997 on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Cartoon Sushi&quot; as a short that featured convicted murderer Charles Manson and shock rocker Marilyn Manson fighting to the death. &quot;Deathmatch&quot; was brought back in 1998 for MTV&#x27;s Super Bowl XXXII halftime special. Just three months later, &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; had entered MTV&#x27;s main lineup. The show was popular enough for show creator Eric Fogel to be named one of the most creative people in the TV industry by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. &quot;CDM&quot; was not the first time Fogel made a show for MTV, as he also had a hand in creating &quot;The Head&quot;. Despite its short run, &quot;The Head&quot;&#x27; was noted for introducing John DiMaggio as a voice actor.

During the next four seasons, &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; became more popular in other countries and gained viewers from all over the world, but four seasons and 75 episodes later in 2002, MTV decided to cancel the show.

Stephen Warbrick, one of the co-creators of &quot;Superjail!&quot; on Adult Swim, worked as a VFX colorist and graphic artist for the series.

===Music===
MTV asked Marilyn Manson to compose a song for the show. Ultimately, the song conveyed the public&#x27;s obsession with violence and sadistic acts which were portrayed on television. Manson believed that was the show&#x27;s satirical take regarding society as a whole. &quot;Astonishing Panorama of the Endtimes&quot; became the only single off the &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; soundtrack. It was nominated in 2001 for the Best Metal Performance Grammy Award and later included on Manson&#x27;s album &quot;The Last Tour on Earth&quot;.

===Revival===

New episodes of the show, which began production in 2005, were produced by Cuppa Coffee Studio as opposed to MTV&#x27;s now-defunct animation department. The show featured an all-new voice cast and a new look. Johnny, Nick, and Mills Lane returned, albeit with new voices. Mills Lane, who used to be played by himself, was played by Chris Edgerly due to the real Mills Lane&#x27;s 2002 stroke. Debbie Matenopoulos was replaced by Tally Wong. Eric Fogel chose not to get very involved with the new seasons due to his involvement on his show &quot;Starveillance&quot; for the E! network. The show was directed by Jack Fletcher and Dave &quot;Canadian&quot; Thomas. This run of the series was also not very well received by fans, especially due to the lack of Eric Fogel&#x27;s involvement. Despite which, during the 2006 season, fans were able to vote on MTV2.com for future matches by choosing one of three matches and by sending a write-in request. However, due to the second cancellation of the show, these matches would not come to fruition.

====Cancelled reboots====
In April 2015, MTV2 announced a reboot of the show on its Twitter account. On November 2, 2016, Eric Fogel confirmed via Twitter that production on the reboot had been scrapped for unknown reasons and the pilot would not be going forward.

On December 6, 2018, MTV Studios announced yet another &quot;reimagining&quot; of the show was set to air in 2019 with Ice Cube as star and executive producer through his Cube Vision production company, with series creator Eric Fogel also as an executive producer, being unclear whether or not the weekly series would air on MTV, as the new version of the show was seeking &quot;an exclusive [streaming video on demand] or premium broadcast partner.&quot; However, in an interview, executive producer Eric Fogel said: &quot;I&#x27;ve had some conversations with Ice Cube. We&#x27;re trying to put a plan in place. There&#x27;s nothing I can announce officially. But there have been conversations.&quot; Despite that, no other new information, announcements nor updates have surfaced, and it has been rumored or speculated that the reboot is presumed to have been quietly cancelled with the re-merger of Viacom and CBS into Paramount Global and the shift of content production overall for the company to Paramount+. As of 2024, the 2006 reboot is available to stream on Paramount+.

==Other media==

===Video game===

A video game based on the series was released for the PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows on October 14, 2003 by Gotham Games.

===Syndication===
&quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; aired in reruns on UPN and was re-aired on TNN (The National Network) (later Spike TV, now Paramount Network) from 2002 to 2003.

<doc id="1053908" wikidata="Q6830267" url="?curid=1053908" title="Michael Ferguson (Australian politician)">
<text>Michael Darrel Joseph Ferguson (born 23 March 1974) is an Australian politician who served as the Deputy Premier of Tasmania from April 2022 to October 2024. He has been a Liberal Party member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly in the Division of Bass since the 2010 state election. Ferguson was appointed to cabinet after his party&#x27;s victory in the 2014 state election and has served continuously as Minister in a range of portfolios including Finance, Health, Infrastructure, Transport, State Growth and Science and Technology.

Ferguson previously served in federal parliament as a Liberal Party of Australia member in the House of Representatives from 2004 to 2007, representing the federal electorate of Bass. He was defeated at the 2007 federal election.

==Background and early career==
He was educated at the University of Tasmania, holding degrees in Applied Science and Education. In the past, his broad community activities include many local tourism and progress associations as well as community radio. He has worked as a teacher from 1996 to 2002, and a member of the Meander Valley Council. He has received awards including winning the Regional Initiative category for the Young Australian of the Year Awards for Tasmania in 2002, and Tasmanian Young Achiever of the Year (2002) by the National Australia Day Council.

Before entering politics, he was a teacher in public secondary schools in Northern Tasmania and adviser to Guy Barnett, Liberal Senator for Tasmania.

==Political career==
In his parliamentary term in the Commonwealth Parliament Ferguson concentrated on issues such as education, health, family and employment and served on numerous parliamentary and backbench committees. He was the secretary of the Government Education, Science and Training policy committee and is acknowledged as having played a key role in brokering the passage of the Voluntary Student Unionism legislation through the Senate with his (implemented) proposal for a sports infrastructure transition fund.

Soon after the 2007 election when he failed to be elected, Ferguson was appointed as the CEO of the Clifford Craig Medical Research Trust.

He was subsequently elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly at the 2010 state election, securing the highest number of primary votes in Bass (1.5 quotas) and the second highest vote in the state. In April 2010 Ferguson was appointed as Shadow Minister for Education and Skills; and Shadow Minister for Innovation, Science and Technology.

Ferguson was re-elected at the 2014 state election, at which the Liberals gained government, and was appointed Minister for Health and Minister for Information Technology and Innovation.

As Health Minister, Ferguson led a somewhat contentious reform of the Tasmanian health system by merging the previously three health services into one and changing the services delivered at each of the four hospitals in the state. He has also taken charge of the redevelopment of the Royal Hobart Hospital to ensure that the much-promised building eventuates.

His tenure has not been without incident with his appointment of an interim CEO of the merged health service having a side interest in alternative therapies and a series of electrical and computer failures at the ambulance service. He was removed as Health Minister in 2019 after an increasing number of complaints and mistakes in his portfolio including widespread complaints from medical practiioners and a damning report from the Tasmanian Auditor-General.

In January 2020, Premier Will Hodgman resigned and Ferguson was a candidate to succeed him as Premier and Liberal leader but ultimately withdrew from the leadership contest. Treasurer Peter Gutwein was instead elected unopposed as Hodgman&#x27;s successor. There was speculation that Ferguson would succeed Gutwein as Treasurer but in the end Premier Gutwein chose to retain the Treasury portfolio.

On 8 April 2022, after Gutwein resigned as Premier, deputy party leader Jeremy Rockliff became party leader, and Ferguson was elected as deputy party premier to replace Rockliff. Ferguson was sworn in as Deputy Premier of Tasmania that afternoon. Ferguson was also sworn in as Minister for Infrastructure and Treasurer however significant problems with the construction of new &#x27;Spirit of Tasmania&#x27; ferries, including production delays and cost blow-outs and ongoing arguments with the ferry management Board and the port authority, and bungled re-design of the port to accommodate the new ferries and subsequent claims of misleading Parliament resulted in his resignation as Minister for Infrastructure. He continued to hold the position of Deputy Premier and State Treasurer. Anticipating a successful no confidence motion in the Tasmanian Parliament the following day, Ferguson resigned from the Cabinet on the 14th of October 2024, but will remain a backbencher.

==Political views==
Ferguson has been described as a &quot;conservative&quot; Liberal, and is opposed to same-sex marriage and abortion. In 2018, he criticised the Tasmanian Greens and the Labor Party for their reforms to make birth certificates gender-optional, citing it as a social experiment on children that Tasmanian parents would be &quot;disgusted&quot; by.

Ferguson opposed the 2023 Voice to Parliament.

<text>In mathematics, in the theory of several complex variables and complex manifolds, a Stein manifold is a complex submanifold of the vector space of &quot;n&quot; complex dimensions. They were introduced by and named after . A Stein space is similar to a Stein manifold but is allowed to have singularities. Stein spaces are the analogues of affine varieties or affine schemes in algebraic geometry.

== Definition ==
Suppose formula_1 is a complex manifold of complex dimension formula_2 and let formula_3 denote the ring of holomorphic functions on formula_4 We call formula_1 a Stein manifold if the following conditions hold:

* formula_1 is holomorphically convex, i.e. for every compact subset formula_7, the so-called &quot;holomorphically convex hull&quot;,
::formula_8
:is also a &quot;compact&quot; subset of formula_1.

* formula_1 is holomorphically separable, i.e. if formula_11 are two points in formula_1, then there exists formula_13 such that formula_14

==Non-compact Riemann surfaces are Stein manifolds==

Let &quot;X&quot; be a connected, non-compact Riemann surface. A deep theorem of Heinrich Behnke and Stein (1948) asserts that &quot;X&quot; is a Stein manifold.

Another result, attributed to Hans Grauert and Helmut Röhrl (1956), states moreover that every holomorphic vector bundle on &quot;X&quot; is trivial. In particular, every line bundle is trivial, so formula_15. The exponential sheaf sequence leads to the following exact sequence:

: formula_16

Now Cartan&#x27;s theorem B shows that formula_17, therefore formula_18.

This is related to the solution of the second Cousin problem.

== Properties and examples of Stein manifolds ==
* The standard complex space formula_19 is a Stein manifold.

* Every domain of holomorphy in formula_19 is a Stein manifold.

* Every closed complex submanifold of a Stein manifold is a Stein manifold, too.

* The embedding theorem for Stein manifolds states the following: Every Stein manifold formula_1 of complex dimension formula_2 can be embedded into formula_23 by a biholomorphic proper map.

These facts imply that a Stein manifold is a closed complex submanifold of complex space, whose complex structure is that of the ambient space (because the embedding is biholomorphic).

* Every Stein manifold of (complex) dimension &quot;n&quot; has the homotopy type of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional CW-complex.

* In one complex dimension the Stein condition can be simplified: a connected Riemann surface is a Stein manifold if and only if it is not compact. This can be proved using a version of the Runge theorem for Riemann surfaces, due to Behnke and Stein.

* Every Stein manifold formula_1 is holomorphically spreadable, i.e. for every point formula_25, there are formula_2 holomorphic functions defined on all of formula_1 which form a local coordinate system when restricted to some open neighborhood of formula_28.

* Being a Stein manifold is equivalent to being a (complex) &quot;strongly pseudoconvex manifold&quot;. The latter means that it has a strongly pseudoconvex (or plurisubharmonic) exhaustive function, i.e. a smooth real function formula_29 on formula_1 (which can be assumed to be a Morse function) with formula_31, such that the subsets formula_32 are compact in formula_1 for every real number formula_34. This is a solution to the so-called Levi problem, named after Eugenio Levi (1911). The function formula_29 invites a generalization of &quot;Stein manifold&quot; to the idea of a corresponding class of compact complex manifolds with boundary called Stein domains. A Stein domain is the preimage formula_36. Some authors call such manifolds therefore strictly pseudoconvex manifolds.

*Related to the previous item, another equivalent and more topological definition in complex dimension 2 is the following: a Stein surface is a complex surface &quot;X&quot; with a real-valued Morse function &quot;f&quot; on &quot;X&quot; such that, away from the critical points of &quot;f&quot;, the field of complex tangencies to the preimage formula_37 is a contact structure that induces an orientation on &quot;Xc&quot; agreeing with the usual orientation as the boundary of formula_38 That is, formula_39 is a Stein filling of &quot;Xc&quot;.

Numerous further characterizations of such manifolds exist, in particular capturing the property of their having &quot;many&quot; holomorphic functions taking values in the complex numbers. See for example Cartan&#x27;s theorems A and B, relating to sheaf cohomology. The initial impetus was to have a description of the properties of the domain of definition of the (maximal) analytic continuation of an analytic function.

In the GAGA set of analogies, Stein manifolds correspond to affine varieties.

Stein manifolds are in some sense dual to the elliptic manifolds in complex analysis which admit &quot;many&quot; holomorphic functions from the complex numbers into themselves. It is known that a Stein manifold is elliptic if and only if it is fibrant in the sense of so-called &quot;holomorphic homotopy theory&quot;.

== Relation to smooth manifolds ==

Every compact smooth manifold of dimension 2&quot;n&quot;, which has only handles of index ≤ &quot;n&quot;, has a Stein structure provided &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2, and when &quot;n&quot; = 2 the same holds provided the 2-handles are attached with certain framings (framing less than the Thurston–Bennequin framing). Every closed smooth 4-manifold is a union of two Stein 4-manifolds glued along their common boundary.

<text>Avogadro is an ancient lunar impact crater that is located in the northern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. The formation has been heavily worn and eroded by subsequent impacts, so that the rim is now little more than a rounded edge surrounding the crater depression. The crater floor is equally worn, being covered in a multitude of smaller craters of various sizes. Many of these smaller craters have also been eroded, leaving little more than a faint trace on the surface.

Nearby craters of note include Tikhov, which is nearly attached to the southeast rim, Oberth to the west, and Schjellerup to the north-northwest. To the south-southwest is the crater Yamamoto, and farther to the south is the large walled plain D&#x27;Alembert.

It is named after the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Avogadro.

<text>Samuel Parris (1653February 27, 1720) was a Puritan minister in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Also a businessman and one-time plantation owner, he gained notoriety for being the minister of the church in Salem Village, Massachusetts during the Salem witch trials of 1692. Accusations by Parris and his daughter against an enslaved woman precipitated an expanding series of witchcraft accusations.

==Life and career==
Samuel Parris, son of Thomas Parris, was born in London, England to a family of modest financial success and religious nonconformity. Samuel emigrated to Boston in the early 1660s, where he attended Harvard College at his father&#x27;s behest. When his father died in 1673, Samuel left Harvard to take up his inheritance in Barbados, where he maintained a sugar plantation.

In 1680, after a hurricane hit Barbados, damaging much of his property, Parris sold a little of his land and returned to Boston, where he brought his slave Tituba and married Elizabeth Eldridge. Eldridge was noted by many as being incredibly beautiful, and was said to be one of the most beautiful women in Salem Village. Together they had three children, Thomas Parris, Elizabeth Parris, and Susannah Parris. Although the plantation supported his merchant ventures, Parris was dissatisfied with his lack of financial security and began to look to the ministry. In 1685 he briefly served as minister in Stow Massachusetts. In July 1689, he became minister of Salem Village (now Danvers), Massachusetts.

Salem Village was a contentious place to live and was known to be quarrelsome by neighboring towns and villages. Its dispersed settlement pattern may have resulted in a lack of a sense of common purpose that may have united more orderly and arranged communities. Parris was the fourth minister appointed in a series of unsuccessful attempts to keep a permanent minister. James Bayley (1673–79) and George Burroughs (1680–83) each stayed only a few years, departing after the congregation failed to pay their full rates. Deodat Lawson (1684–88) left with less contention. Further tension was caused by Parris&#x27; delay in accepting the position and his inability to resolve his parishioners&#x27; disputes. There were also disputes over Parris&#x27; compensation. In October 1691, the town decided to stop paying his wages. These issues, and others that were more personal between the villagers, continued to grow unabated.Samuel Parris had the power to jail the people of Salem and used it on specific occasions.

The events which led to the Salem witch trials began when Parris&#x27; daughter, Betty, and her cousin, Abigail Williams, accused Parris&#x27; slave Tituba of witchcraft. Parris beat Tituba until she confessed herself as a witch, and John Indian, her husband, began accusing others. The delusion spread, and many were apprehended, most of whom were imprisoned. During the 16-month duration of the Salem witch trials phenomenon, 19 persons were hanged, and one, Giles Corey, was pressed to death.

During a 1692 sermon, Parris declared that &quot;as in our text John 6:10 there was one devil among the 12 disciples… so in our churches, God knows how many Devils there are,&quot; encouraging antagonistic villagers to locate and destroy &quot;witches&quot; who, as it happened, were frequently individuals with whom Parris and his key allies, the Putnam family, had taken umbrage.

As Parris had been an active prosecutor in the witchcraft cases, in 1693, his parish brought charges against Parris for his part in the trials. Parris apologized in his essay &quot;Meditations for Peace&quot;, which he presented in November 1694. Increase Mather led a church council which then vindicated him.

Parris was then involved in a dispute with his congregation over parsonage land he had seized to compensate himself for the salary he was owed. The dispute found its way to an Ipswich court, which, in 1697, ordered his salary to be paid and the land to be returned. By 1696, however, he had found his situation untenable. He resigned that year and left Salem. Records in the &quot;Suffolk Deeds&quot; indicate it likely he returned to business in Boston in 1697.

His wife Elizabeth died in 1696. In 1699, he remarried, to Dorothy Noyes, in Sudbury. He returned to preach for two or three years at Stow. He then moved to Concord (1704/05). He also preached six months in Dunstable in 1711. He died on February 27, 1720, in Sudbury.

==Fiction==

Parris features in Arthur Miller&#x27;s 1953 play &quot;The Crucible,&quot; set against the backdrop of the witch trials. In the play, his daughter Elizabeth Parris is the first to become ill because of supposed witchcraft, of which she is accused. In the 1957 and 1996 film adaptations of Miller&#x27;s play, he was portrayed by Jean Debucourt and Bruce Davison, respectively.

Author John Neal made Parris a character in &quot;Rachel Dyer&quot; (1828), which is the first bound novel about the witch trials. In this version of the story his name is Matthew Paris, a socially isolated man who is threatened by Tituba&#x27;s relationship with John Indian and accuses her out of sexual frustration.

Parris is also a character in the 1964 novel &quot;Tituba of Salem Village&quot; by Ann Petry and the 1986 novel &quot;I, Tituba: Black Witch of Salem&quot; by Maryse Condé, both books depicting the witch trials.

In the novel &quot;Supernatural: One Year Gone&quot;, Parris is portrayed as having been manipulated by the real witches into starting the trials and also manipulated the girls to accuse his enemies and rivals to get rid of them. At the end of the novel, after the truth is revealed, he swears to put an end to the innocent women.

&quot;Road to Endor&quot; was written in 1940 by Esther Barstow Hammand. It uses facts from Parris&#x27; life and weaves them into fictional life. Hammand tells readers in an author&#x27;s note, &quot;This book is fiction. Although I have delved into many old records and used all reasonable care to dig up whatever historical facts are available, the research has been hampered by unusual difficulties.&quot; The tale begins with Samuel&#x27;s birth and continues until the dreaded year of the trials.

==Music==
Samuel Parris is portrayed in the Jayce Landberg song &quot;Happy 4 U&quot;, featured on Landberg&#x27;s 2020 album &quot;The Forbidden World&quot;.

<text>Azophi is a lunar impact crater that lies in the rugged south-central highlands of the Moon. The crater is named after the 10th-century Persian astronomer Abd Al-Rahman Al Sufi, also known by his western name, Azophi. The northwest rim is attached to the slightly smaller crater Abenezra, to the east-southeast is the large and irregular Sacrobosco, and to the west-southwest is Playfair.

The wide outer rim of Azophi has a somewhat polygonal shape with rounded corners. The edge is relatively sharp and cleft-like. The rim is not significantly worn or impacted by smaller craters, with the exception of Azophi C, which lies on the inner northeast wall. The interior floor lacks a central peak and is only marked by a few small craterlets.

== Satellite craters ==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Azophi.

<doc id="1053930" wikidata="Q6037346" url="?curid=1053930" title="Insensitive munition">
<text>Insensitive munitions are munitions that are designed to withstand stimuli representative of severe but credible accidents. The current range of stimuli are shock (from bullets, fragments and shaped charge jets), heat (from fires or adjacent thermal events) and adjacent detonating munitions. A munition can have its vulnerability reduced by a number of means used on their own or in combination such as a reduced vulnerability energetic material, design features, additions or changes to packaging etc. The munition must still retain its terminal effect and performance within acceptable parameters.

==Description==
Insensitive munitions (IM) will only burn (rather than explode) when subjected to fast or slow heating, bullets, shrapnel, shaped charges or the detonation of another nearby munition. The term refers to warheads, bombs, and rocket motors, although different countries&#x27; armed forces may have their own definitions.

Due to &quot;accidents, and the subsequent loss of human life, cost of repairing and replacing material, and the toll taken on operational readiness and capability, Insensitive Munitions (IM) improvements are mandated by law in the U.S.&quot;

Three approaches are taken when designing insensitive munitions: Firstly, the high energy device can be protected and transported with an external protection of some kind. Some munition shipping containers are designed to provide some protection and thermal insulation. Secondly, the chemistry of the high energy fill is chosen to provide a higher degree of stability, for example by using plastic bonded explosives. Lastly, the casings of high energy devices can be designed in such a way as to allow venting or some other form of pressure relief in a fire.

Beyond the three approaches above, other threats need addressing when designing IM, e.g., slow and fast cook-off, sympathetic detonation, bullet and fragment impact, and shaped charge jet impact. Extensive testing requirements for potential IM candidates to address these threats are extremely costly. Modeling programs are being designed to simulate the threat of bullet and fragment impact in an effort to reduce testing costs. One of the most promising methods that engineers and scientists within the U.S. Department of Defense are employing to help to enhance IM performance is by using advanced multiphysics modeling programs. Also, another effort is underway developing 2-D numerical code that will simulate the threat of slow and fast cook-off.

==Insensitive high explosives==
Insensitive munitions are almost always filled with fire resistant, shock resistant insensitive high explosives (IHE) such as triaminotrinitrobenzene (TATB) or various insensitive explosive mixtures, or plastic/polymer-bonded explosives, which are similar to reactive materials. TATB particularly will not detonate if impacted by typical fragments or burned in a fire.

A new IHE called Insensitive Munitions Explosive (IMX-101) has been qualified and approved by the U.S. Army to replace trinitrotoluene (TNT). IMX-101 is said to have the &quot;same lethality as traditional TNT, but is far less likely to explode if dropped, shot at or hit by a roadside bomb during transport&quot;. This IHE has been tested and proven to be a safer alternative within large-caliber projectiles currently utilized by the Army and Marine Corps.

Other insensitive high explosives include nitroguanidine, 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene (FOX-7), and 4,10-dinitro-2,6,8,12-tetraoxa-4,10-diazatetracyclo[5.5.0.05,9.03,11]-dodecane (TEX).

IHEs often combine amino groups and nitro groups in the same molecule.

Within the United States Department of Energy (DOE) and National Nuclear Safety Administration, the term IHE has very specific meaning. In fact, under the DOE&#x27;s definition, an explosive or explosive mixture (e.g., Plastic Bonded Explosives) cannot be described as an IHE without meeting rigorous testing and qualification criteria as described in the DOE Technical Standard &quot;Explosive Safety.&quot;

===Origin===
Following the 1966 Palomares B-52 crash and the 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash, concerns were raised by accident investigators about the high explosive used in the nuclear devices, which had detonated on impact. Efforts were started to find an explosive that was stable enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory developed the &quot;Susan Test&quot; – a standard test designed to simulate an aircraft accident by squeezing and nipping explosive material between metal surfaces of a test projectile. Following experiments with this device, the Los Alamos National Laboratory developed a new safer type of explosive, called insensitive high explosive (IHE), for use in U.S. nuclear weapons.

IHE explosives can withstand impacts up to , as opposed to conventional HE, which will detonate at only .

===Use in nuclear weapons===
Insensitive high explosives have been available to the United States military for use in its nuclear weapons since 1979—by 1991, 25% of the country&#x27;s nuclear stockpile was using IHE. Most modern American nuclear weapons, and at least those of the United Kingdom, are manufactured using insensitive munition designs. These are almost exclusively TATB plastic bonded explosive (LX-17-0 and PBX-9502). Conventional high explosives are still used in missiles and nuclear artillery shells where weight and volume is a factor (IHE by weight contains only two-thirds the energy of HE, so more is needed to achieve the same effect).

<doc id="1053933" wikidata="Q206883" url="?curid=1053933" title="Symposium">
<text>In Ancient Greece, the symposium (, &quot;sympósion&quot; or &quot;symposio&quot;, from συμπίνειν, &quot;sympínein&quot;, &#x27;to drink together&#x27;) was the part of a banquet that took place after the meal, when drinking for pleasure was accompanied by music, dancing, recitals, or conversation. Literary works that describe or take place at a symposium include two Socratic dialogues, Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot; and Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;, as well as a number of Greek poems, such as the elegies of Theognis of Megara. Symposia are depicted in Greek and Etruscan art that shows similar scenes.

In modern usage, it has come to mean an academic conference or meeting, such as a scientific conference. The Latin equivalent of a Greek symposium in Roman society is &quot;convivium.&quot;

==Setting and social occasion==


The Greek symposium was a key Hellenic social institution. It was a forum for the progeny of respected families to debate, plot, boast, or simply to revel with others. They were frequently held to celebrate the introduction of youth into aristocratic society. Symposia were also held by aristocrats to celebrate other special occasions, such as victories in athletic and poetic contests. Many archaic poetic sources were written by members of the social elite communities, and so may not be completely representative of the whole local society.

Symposia were usually held in the &quot;andrōn&quot; (ἀνδρών), the citizen quarters of the household. The participants, or &quot;symposiasts&quot;, would recline on pillowed couches arrayed against the three walls of the room away from the door. Due to space limitations, the couches would number between seven and nine, limiting the total number of participants to somewhere between fourteen and twenty seven (Oswyn Murray gives a figure of between seven and fifteen couches and reckons fourteen to thirty participants a &quot;standard size for a drinking group&quot;). If any young men took part, they did not recline but sat up. However, in Macedonian symposia, the focus was not only on drinking but hunting, and young men were allowed to recline only after they had killed their first wild boar.
Food and wine were served. Entertainment was provided, and depending on the occasion could include games, songs, flute-girls or boys, slaves performing various acts, and hired entertainment.

Symposia often were held for specific occasions. The most famous symposium of all, described in Plato&#x27;s dialogue of that name (and rather differently in Xenophon&#x27;s) was hosted by the poet Agathon on the occasion of his first victory at the theater contest of the 416 BC Dionysia. According to Plato&#x27;s account, the celebration was upstaged by the unexpected entrance of the toast of the town, the young Alcibiades, dropping in drunken and nearly naked, having just left another symposium.

The men at the symposium would discuss a multitude of topics—often philosophical or political.

==Drinking==

A symposium would be overseen by a &quot;symposiarch&quot; ( : symposiárchēs) who would decide how strong the wine for the evening would be, depending on whether serious discussions or sensual indulgence were in the offing. The Greeks and Romans customarily served their wine mixed with water, as the drinking of pure wine was considered a habit of uncivilized peoples. However, there were major differences between the Roman and Greek symposia. A Roman symposium (&quot;convivium&quot;) served wine before, with and after food, and women of status were allowed to join. In a Greek symposium, wine was only drunk after dinner, and women besides entertainers were not allowed to attend. 
The wine was drawn from a &quot;krater&quot;, a large jar designed to be carried by two men, and served from pitchers &quot;(oenochoe)&quot;. Determined by the symposiarch, the wine was diluted to a specific strength and was then mixed. Slave boys would manage the &quot;krater&quot;, and transfer the wine into pitchers. They then attended to each man in the symposium with the pitchers and filled their cups with wine. Certain formalities were observed, most important among which were libations, the pouring of a small amount of wine in honour of various deities or the mourned dead.
In a fragment from his c. 375 BC play &quot;Semele or Dionysus&quot;, Eubulus has the god of wine Dionysos describe proper and improper drinking:
For sensible men I prepare only three &quot;kraters&quot;: one for health (which they drink first), the second for love and pleasure, and the third for sleep. After the third one is drained, wise men go home. The fourth &quot;krater&quot; is not mine any more – it belongs to bad behaviour; the fifth is for shouting; the sixth is for rudeness and insults; the seventh is for fights; the eighth is for breaking the furniture; the ninth is for depression; the tenth is for madness and unconsciousness.

In keeping with the Greek virtue of moderation, the symposiarch should have prevented festivities from getting out of hand, but Greek literature and art often indicate that the third-&quot;krater&quot; limit was not observed.

==Pottery==
Symposiums are often featured on Attic pottery and Richard Neer has argued that the chief function of Attic pottery was for use in the symposium. An amphora was used as a jug to hold the wine and usually one single cup was passed amongst the men. Cups used at symposiums were not as nearly intricate as amphoras. Pottery used at symposiums often featured painted scenes of the god Dionysus, satyrs, and other mythical scenes related to drinking and celebration.

==Entertainments==

Poetry and music were central to the pleasures of the symposium. Although free women of status did not attend symposia, high-class female prostitutes &quot;(hetairai)&quot; and entertainers were hired to perform, consort, and converse with the guests. Among the instruments women might play was the &quot;aulos&quot;, a Greek woodwind instrument sometimes compared to an oboe. When string instruments were played, the barbiton was the traditional instrument. Slaves and boys also provided service and entertainment.

The guests also participated actively in competitive entertainments. A game sometimes played at symposia was &quot;kottabos&quot;, in which players swirled the dregs of their wine in a kylix, a platter-like stemmed drinking vessel, and flung them at a target. Another feature of the symposia were skolia, drinking songs of a patriotic or bawdy nature, performed competitively with one symposiast reciting the first part of a song and another expected to improvise the end of it. Symposiasts might also compete in rhetorical contests, for which reason the word &quot;symposium&quot; has come to refer in English to any event where multiple speeches are made.

==Etruscan and Roman drinking parties==

Etruscan art shows scenes of banqueting that recall aspects of the Greek symposia; however, one major difference is that women of status participated more fully in this as in other realms of Etruscan society. Women were allowed to drink wine and recline with men at feasts. Some Etruscan women were even considered &quot;expert drinkers&quot;. Additionally, Etruscan women were often buried with drinking and feasting paraphernalia, suggesting that they partook in these activities. 
The most apparent distinctions between Greek and Etruscan drinking parties appear in Etruscan art. Etruscan paintings show men and women drinking wine together and reclining on the same cushions. The &quot;Sarcophagus of the Spouses&quot;, found in the Etruscan region dating to 520–530 BC, depicts a man and women lounging together in the context of a banquet, which is a stark contrast with gendered Greek drinking parties.

As with many other Greek customs, the aesthetic framework of the symposium was adopted by the Romans under the name of &quot;comissatio&quot;. These revels also involved the drinking of assigned quantities of wine, and the oversight of a master of the ceremonies appointed for the occasion from among the guests. Another Roman version of the symposium was the &quot;convivium&quot;. Women&#x27;s roles differed in Roman symposia as well. Roman women were legally prohibited from drinking wine as a matter of public morality. Men were expected to control their own wine consumption, but women were not given this authority.

<doc id="1053949" wikidata="Q1415275" url="?curid=1053949" title="Spinal cord injury">
<text>A spinal cord injury (SCI) is damage to the spinal cord that causes temporary or permanent changes in its function. It is a destructive neurological and pathological state that causes major motor, sensory and autonomic dysfunctions.

Symptoms of spinal cord injury may include loss of muscle function, sensation, or autonomic function in the parts of the body served by the spinal cord below the level of the injury. Injury can occur at any level of the spinal cord and can be &quot;complete&quot;, with a total loss of sensation and muscle function at lower sacral segments, or &quot;incomplete&quot;, meaning some nervous signals are able to travel past the injured area of the cord up to the Sacral S4-5 spinal cord segments. Depending on the location and severity of damage, the symptoms vary, from numbness to paralysis, including bowel or bladder incontinence. Long term outcomes also range widely, from full recovery to permanent tetraplegia (also called quadriplegia) or paraplegia. Complications can include muscle atrophy, loss of voluntary motor control, spasticity, pressure sores, infections, and breathing problems.

In the majority of cases the damage results from physical trauma such as car accidents, gunshot wounds, falls, or sports injuries, but it can also result from nontraumatic causes such as infection, insufficient blood flow, and tumors. Just over half of injuries affect the cervical spine, while 15% occur in each of the thoracic spine, border between the thoracic and lumbar spine, and lumbar spine alone. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and medical imaging.

Efforts to prevent SCI include individual measures such as using safety equipment, societal measures such as safety regulations in sports and traffic, and improvements to equipment. Treatment starts with restricting further motion of the spine and maintaining adequate blood pressure. Corticosteroids have not been found to be useful. Other interventions vary depending on the location and extent of the injury, from bed rest to surgery. In many cases, spinal cord injuries require long-term physical and occupational therapy, especially if it interferes with activities of daily living.

In the United States, about 12,000 people annually survive a spinal cord injury. The most commonly affected group are young adult males. SCI has seen great improvements in its care since the middle of the 20th century. Research into potential treatments includes stem cell implantation, hypothermia, engineered materials for tissue support, epidural spinal stimulation, and wearable robotic exoskeletons.

==Classification==

Spinal cord injury can be traumatic or nontraumatic, and can be classified into three types based on cause: mechanical forces, toxic, and ischemic from lack of blood flow. The damage can also be divided into primary and secondary injury: the cell death that occurs immediately in the original injury, and biochemical cascades that are initiated by the original insult and cause further tissue damage. These secondary injury pathways include the ischemic cascade, inflammation, swelling, cell suicide, and neurotransmitter imbalances. They can take place for minutes or weeks following the injury.

At each level of the spinal column, spinal nerves branch off from either side of the spinal cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to innervate a specific part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome, and the group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a myotome. The part of the spinal cord that was damaged corresponds to the spinal nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person&#x27;s level of injury is defined as the lowest level of full sensation and function. Paraplegia occurs when the legs are affected by the spinal cord damage (in thoracic, lumbar, or sacral injuries), and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected (cervical damage).

SCI is also classified by the degree of impairment. The &quot;International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury&quot; (ISNCSCI), published by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA), is widely used to document sensory and motor impairments following SCI. It is based on neurological responses, touch and pinprick sensations tested in each dermatome, and strength of the muscles that control key motions on both sides of the body. Muscle strength is scored on a scale of 0–5 according to the table on the right, and sensation is graded on a scale of 0–2: 0 is no sensation, 1 is altered or decreased sensation, and 2 is full sensation. Each side of the body is graded independently.

===Complete and incomplete injuries===

In a &quot;complete&quot; spinal injury, all functions below the injured area are lost, whether or not the spinal cord is severed. An &quot;incomplete&quot; spinal cord injury involves preservation of motor or sensory function below the level of injury in the spinal cord. To be classed as incomplete, there must be some preservation of sensation or motion in the areas innervated by S4 to S5, including voluntary external anal sphincter contraction. The nerves in this area are connected to the very lowest region of the spinal cord, and retaining sensation and function in these parts of the body indicates that the spinal cord is only partially damaged. Incomplete injury by definition includes a phenomenon known as sacral sparing: some degree of sensation is preserved in the sacral dermatomes, even though sensation may be more impaired in other, higher dermatomes below the level of the lesion. Sacral sparing has been attributed to the fact that the sacral spinal pathways are not as likely as the other spinal pathways to become compressed after injury due to the lamination of fibers within the spinal cord.

===Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality===

Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality exists when spinal cord injury is present but there is no evidence of spinal column injury on radiographs. Spinal column injury is trauma that causes fracture of the bone or instability of the ligaments in the spine; this can coexist with or cause injury to the spinal cord, but each injury can occur without the other. Abnormalities might show up on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the term was coined before MRI was in common use.

===Central cord syndrome===
Central cord syndrome, almost always resulting from damage to the cervical spinal cord, is characterized by weakness in the arms with relative sparing of the legs, and spared sensation in regions served by the sacral segments. There is loss of sensation of pain, temperature, light touch, and pressure below the level of injury. The spinal tracts that serve the arms are more affected due to their central location in the spinal cord, while the corticospinal fibers destined for the legs are spared due to their more external location.

The most common of the incomplete SCI syndromes, central cord syndrome usually results from neck hyperextension in older people with spinal stenosis. In younger people, it most commonly results from neck flexion. The most common causes are falls and vehicle accidents; however other possible causes include spinal stenosis and impingement on the spinal cord by a tumor or intervertebral disc.

===Anterior spinal artery syndrome===

Anterior spinal artery syndrome also known as &quot;anterior spinal cord syndrome&quot;, due to damage to the front portion of the spinal cord or reduction in the blood supply from the anterior spinal artery, can be caused by fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks. Below the level of injury, motor function, pain sensation, and temperature sensation are lost, while sense of touch and proprioception (sense of position in space) remain intact. These differences are due to the relative locations of the spinal tracts responsible for each type of function.

===Brown-Séquard syndrome===

Brown-Séquard syndrome occurs when the spinal cord is injured on one side much more than the other. It is rare for the spinal cord to be truly hemisected (severed on one side), but partial lesions due to penetrating wounds (such as gunshot or knife wounds) or fractured vertebrae or tumors are common. On the ipsilateral side of the injury (same side), the body loses motor function, proprioception, and senses of vibration and touch. On the contralateral (opposite side) of the injury, there is a loss of pain and temperature sensations. If the injury is above pyramidal decussation there is contralateral hemiplegia, at the level of decussation there is completed motor loss on both sides and below pyramidal decussation there is ipsilateral hemiplegia.

Spinothalamic tracts are in charge for pain and temperature sensation and because these tracts cross to the opposite side and above the spinal cord there is loss on the contralateral side.

===Posterior spinal artery syndrome===

Posterior spinal artery syndrome (PSAS), in which just the dorsal columns of the spinal cord are affected, is usually seen in cases of chronic myelopathy but can also occur with infarction of the posterior spinal artery. This rare syndrome causes the loss of proprioception and sense of vibration below the level of injury while motor function and sensation of pain, temperature, and touch remain intact. Usually posterior cord injuries result from insults like disease or vitamin deficiency rather than trauma. Tabes dorsalis, due to injury to the posterior part of the spinal cord caused by syphilis, results in loss of touch and proprioceptive sensation.

===Conus medullaris and cauda equina syndromes===

Conus medullaris syndrome is an injury to the end of the spinal cord the conus medullaris, located at about the T12–L2 vertebrae in adults. This region contains the S4–S5 spinal segments, responsible for bowel, bladder, and some sexual functions, so these can be disrupted in this type of injury. In addition, sensation and the Achilles reflex can be disrupted. Causes include tumors, physical trauma, and ischemia. Cauda equina syndrome may also be caused by central disc prolapse or slipped disc, infections such as epidural abscess, spinal haemorrhages, secondary to medical procedures and birth abnormalities.

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) results from a lesion below the level at which the spinal cord ends. Descending nerve roots continue as the cauda equina at levels L2–S5 below the conus medullaris before exiting through intervertebral foraminae. Thus it is not a true spinal cord syndrome since it is nerve roots that are damaged and not the cord itself; however, it is common for several of these nerves to be damaged at the same time due to their proximity. CES can occur by itself or alongside conus medullaris syndrome. It can cause low back pain, weakness or paralysis in the lower limbs, loss of sensation, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and loss of reflexes. There may be bilateral sciatica with central disc prolapse and altered gait. Unlike conus medullaris syndrome, symptoms often occur only on one side of the body. The cause is often compression, e.g. by a ruptured intervertebral disk or tumor. Since the nerves damaged in CES are actually peripheral nerves because they have already branched off from the spinal cord, the injury has better prognosis for recovery of function: the peripheral nervous system has a greater capacity for healing than the central nervous system.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs (observed by a clinician) and symptoms (experienced by a patient) vary depending on where the spine is injured and the extent of the injury.

=== Dermatome ===

A section of skin innervated through a specific part of the spine is called a dermatome, and injury to that part of the spine can cause pain, numbness, or a loss of sensation in the related areas. Paraesthesia, a tingling or burning sensation in affected areas of the skin, is another symptom. A person with a lowered level of consciousness may show a response to a painful stimulus above a certain point but not below it.

=== Muscle function ===
A group of muscles innervated through a specific part of the spine is called a myotome, and injury to that part of the spinal cord can cause problems with movements that involve those muscles. The muscles may contract uncontrollably (spasticity), become weak, or be completely paralysed. Spinal shock, loss of neural activity including reflexes below the level of injury, occurs shortly after the injury and usually goes away within a day. Priapism, an erection of the penis may be a sign of acute spinal cord injury.

The specific parts of the body affected by loss of function are determined by the level of injury. Some signs, such as bowel and bladder dysfunction can occur at any level. Neurogenic bladder involves a compromised ability to empty the bladder and is a common symptom of spinal cord injury. This can lead to high pressures in the bladder that can damage the kidneys.

==Spinal cord injury locations==
===Cervical spine===

Spinal cord injuries at the cervical vertebrae (neck) level result in full or partial tetraplegia, also called quadriplegia. Depending on the specific location and severity of trauma, limited function may be retained. Additional symptoms of cervical injuries include low heart rate, low blood pressure, problems regulating body temperature, and breathing dysfunction. If the injury is high enough in the neck to impair the muscles involved in breathing, the person may not be able to breathe without the help of an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilator.

===Lumbosacral===

The effects of injuries at or above the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence.

===Thoracic===

In addition to the problems found in lower-level injuries, thorax (chest height) spinal lesions can affect the muscles in the trunk. Injuries at the level of T1 to T8 result in inability to control the abdominal muscles. Trunk stability may be affected; even more so in higher level injuries. The lower the level of injury, the less extensive its effects. Injuries from T9 to T12 result in partial loss of trunk and abdominal muscle control. Thoracic spinal injuries result in paraplegia, but function of the hands, arms, and neck are not affected.

====Autonomic dysreflexia====

One condition that occurs typically in lesions above the T6 level is autonomic dysreflexia (AD), in which the blood pressure increases to dangerous levels, high enough to cause potentially deadly stroke. It results from an overreaction of the system to a stimulus such as pain below the level of injury, because inhibitory signals from the brain cannot pass the lesion to dampen the excitatory sympathetic nervous system response. Signs and symptoms of AD include anxiety, headache, nausea, ringing in the ears, blurred vision, flushed skin, and nasal congestion. It can occur shortly after the injury or not until years later.

Other autonomic functions may also be disrupted. For example, problems with body temperature regulation mostly occur in injuries at T8 and above.

====Neurogenic shock====

Another serious complication that can result from lesions above T6 is neurogenic shock, which results from an interruption in output from the sympathetic nervous system responsible for maintaining muscle tone in the blood vessels. Without the sympathetic input, the vessels relax and dilate. Neurogenic shock presents with dangerously low blood pressure, low heart rate, and blood pooling in the limbs—which results in insufficient blood flow to the spinal cord and potentially further damage to it.

===Complications===
Complications of spinal cord injuries include pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, neurogenic shock, and paralysis below the injury site.

====Muscle atrophy====

In the long term, the loss of muscle function can have additional effects from disuse, including muscle atrophy. Immobility also can lead to pressure sores, particularly in bony areas, requiring precautions such as extra cushioning and turning in bed every two hours (in the acute setting) to relieve pressure.

In the long term, people in wheelchairs must shift periodically to relieve pressure. Another complication is pain, including nociceptive pain (indication of potential or actual tissue damage) and neuropathic pain, when nerves affected by damage convey erroneous pain signals in the absence of noxious stimuli. Spasticity, the uncontrollable tensing of muscles below the level of injury, occurs in 65–78% of chronic SCI. It results from lack of input from the brain that quells muscle responses to stretch reflexes. It can be treated with drugs and physical therapy. Spasticity increases the risk of contractures (shortening of muscles, tendons, or ligaments that result from lack of use of a limb); this problem can be prevented by moving the limb through its full range of motion multiple times a day. Another problem lack of mobility can cause is loss of bone density and changes in bone structure. Loss of bone density (bone demineralization), thought to be due to lack of input from weakened or paralysed muscles, can increase the risk of fractures. Conversely, a poorly understood phenomenon is the overgrowth of bone tissue in soft tissue areas, called heterotopic ossification. It occurs below the level of injury, possibly as a result of inflammation, and happens to a clinically significant extent in 27% of people.

====Cardiovascular and respiratory complications====
People with spinal cord injury are at especially high risk for respiratory and cardiovascular problems, so hospital staff must be watchful to avoid them. Respiratory problems (especially pneumonia) are the leading cause of death in people with SCI, followed by infections, usually of pressure sores, urinary tract infections, and respiratory infections. Pneumonia can be accompanied by shortness of breath, fever, and anxiety.

====Deep venous thrombosis====

Another potentially deadly threat to respiration is deep venous thrombosis (DVT), in which blood forms a clot in immobile limbs; the clot can break off and form a pulmonary embolism, lodging in the lung and cutting off blood supply to it. DVT is an especially high risk in SCI, particularly within 10 days of injury, occurring in over 13% in the acute care setting. Preventative measures include anticoagulants, pressure hose, and moving the patient&#x27;s limbs. The usual signs and symptoms of DVT and pulmonary embolism may be masked in SCI cases due to effects such as alterations in pain perception and nervous system functioning.

====Urinary tract infection====

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is another risk that may not display the usual symptoms (pain, urgency, and frequency); it may instead be associated with worsened spasticity. The risk of UTI, likely the most common complication in the long term, is heightened by use of indwelling urinary catheters. Catheterization may be necessary because SCI interferes with the bladder&#x27;s ability to empty when it gets too full, which could trigger autonomic dysreflexia or damage the bladder permanently. The use of intermittent catheterization to empty the bladder at regular intervals throughout the day has decreased the mortality due to kidney failure from UTI in the first world, but it is still a serious problem in developing countries.

====Clinical depression====

An estimated 24–45% of people with spinal cord injuries have major depressive disorder, and the suicide rate is as much as six times that of the rest of the population. The risk of suicide is worst in the first five years after injury. In young people with SCI, suicide is the leading cause of death. Depression is associated with an increased risk of other complications such as UTI and pressure ulcers that occur more when self-care is neglected.

==Causes==

Spinal cord injuries are most often caused by physical trauma. Forces involved can be hyperflexion (forward movement of the head); hyperextension (backward movement); lateral stress (sideways movement); rotation (twisting of the head); compression (force along the axis of the spine downward from the head or upward from the pelvis); or distraction (pulling apart of the vertebrae). Traumatic SCI can result in contusion, compression, or stretch injury. It is a major risk of many types of vertebral fracture. Pre-existing asymptomatic congenital anomalies can cause major neurological deficits, such as hemiparesis, to result from otherwise minor trauma.

In the U.S., motor vehicle accidents are the most common cause of SCIs; second are falls, then violence such as gunshot wounds, then sports injuries. Another study from Asia, found that the most common cause of the SCI is fall (31.70%) from various sites such as fall from roof-tops (9.75%), electric pole (7.31%), fall from tree (7.31%) etc. Whereas road traffic accidents count for 19.51%, firearm injuries (12.19%), slipped foot (7.31%) and sports injuries (4.87%). As a result of injury, 26.82% In some countries falls are more common, even surpassing vehicle crashes as the leading cause of SCI. The rates of violence-related SCI depend heavily on place and time. Of all sports-related SCIs, shallow water dives are the most common cause; winter sports and water sports have been increasing as causes while association football and trampoline injuries have been declining. Hanging can cause injury to the cervical spine, as may occur in attempted suicide. Military conflicts are another cause, and when they occur they are associated with increased rates of SCI. Another potential cause of SCI is iatrogenic injury, caused by an improperly done medical procedure such as an injection into the spinal column.

SCI can also be of a nontraumatic origin. Nontraumatic lesions cause anywhere from 30 to 80% of all SCI; the percentage varies by locale, influenced by efforts to prevent trauma. Developed countries have higher percentages of SCI due to degenerative conditions and tumors than developing countries. In developed countries, the most common cause of nontraumatic SCI is degenerative diseases, followed by tumors; in many developing countries the leading cause is infection such as HIV and tuberculosis. SCI may occur in intervertebral disc disease, and spinal cord vascular disease. Spontaneous bleeding can occur within or outside of the protective membranes that line the cord, and intervertebral disks can herniate. Damage can result from dysfunction of the blood vessels, as in arteriovenous malformation, or when a blood clot becomes lodged in a blood vessel and cuts off blood supply to the cord. When systemic blood pressure drops, blood flow to the spinal cord may be reduced, potentially causing a loss of sensation and voluntary movement in the areas supplied by the affected level of the spinal cord. Congenital conditions and tumors that compress the cord can also cause SCI, as can vertebral spondylosis and ischemia. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that can damage the spinal cord, as can infectious or inflammatory conditions such as tuberculosis, herpes zoster or herpes simplex, meningitis, myelitis, and syphilis.

==Prevention==
Vehicle-related spinal cord injury is prevented with measures including societal and individual efforts to reduce driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, distracted driving, and drowsy driving. Other efforts include increasing road safety (such as marking hazards and adding lighting) and vehicle safety, both to prevent accidents, such as routine maintenance and antilock brakes. There are also approaches mitigate the damage of crashes, such as head restraints, air bags, seat belts, and child safety seats. Falls can be prevented by making changes to the environment, such as nonslip materials and grab bars in bathtubs and showers, railings for stairs, child and safety gates for windows. Gun-related injuries can be prevented with conflict resolution training, gun safety education campaigns, and changes to the technology of guns, including trigger locks to improve their safety. Sports injuries can be prevented with changes to sports rules and equipment to increase safety, and education campaigns to reduce risky practices such as diving into water of unknown depth or head-first tackling in association football.

==Diagnosis==

A person&#x27;s presentation in context of trauma or non-traumatic background determines suspicion for a spinal cord injury. The features are namely paralysis, sensory loss, or both at any level. Other symptoms may include incontinence.

A radiographic evaluation using an X-ray, CT scan, or MRI can determine if there is damage to the spinal column and where it is located. X-rays are commonly available and can detect instability or misalignment of the spinal column, but do not give very detailed images and can miss injuries to the spinal cord or displacement of ligaments or disks that do not have accompanying spinal column damage. Thus when X-ray findings are normal but SCI is still suspected due to pain or SCI symptoms, CT or MRI scans are used. CT gives greater detail than X-rays, but exposes the patient to more radiation, and it still does not give images of the spinal cord or ligaments; MRI shows body structures in the greatest detail. Thus it is the standard for anyone who has neurological deficits found in SCI or is thought to have an unstable spinal column injury.

Neurological evaluations to help determine the degree of impairment are performed initially and repeatedly in the early stages of treatment; this determines the rate of improvement or deterioration and informs treatment and prognosis. The ASIA Impairment Scale outlined above is used to determine the level and severity of injury.

==Management==
===Pre-hospital treatment===

The first stage in the management of a suspected spinal cord injury is geared toward basic life support and preventing further injury: maintaining airway, breathing, circulation, and restricting further motion of the spine.

====Spinal motion restriction====

In the emergency setting, most people who has been subjected to forces strong enough to cause SCI are treated as though they have instability in the spinal column and have spinal motion restricted to prevent damage to the spinal cord. Injuries or fractures in the head, neck, or pelvis as well as penetrating trauma near the spine and falls from heights are assumed to be associated with an unstable spinal column until it is ruled out in the hospital. High-speed vehicle crashes, sports injuries involving the head or neck, and diving injuries are other mechanisms that indicate a high SCI risk. Since head and spinal trauma frequently coexist, anyone who is unconscious or has a lowered level of consciousness as a result of a head injury is spinal motion restricted.

====Devices====
A rigid cervical collar is applied to the neck, and the head is held with blocks on either side and the person is strapped to a backboard. Extrication devices are used to move people without excessively moving the spine if they are still inside a vehicle or other confined space. The use of a cervical collar has been shown to increase mortality in people with penetrating trauma and is thus not routinely recommended in this group.

Modern trauma care includes a step called clearing the cervical spine, ruling out spinal cord injury if the patient is fully conscious and not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, displays no neurological deficits, has no pain in the middle of the neck and no other painful injuries that could distract from neck pain. If these are all absent, no spinal motion restriction is necessary.

If an unstable spinal column injury is moved, damage may occur to the spinal cord. Between 3 and 25% of SCIs occur not at the time of the initial trauma but later during treatment or transport. While some of this is due to the nature of the injury itself, particularly in the case of multiple or massive trauma, some of it reflects the failure to adequately restrict motion of the spine. SCI can impair the body&#x27;s ability to keep warm, so warming blankets may be needed.

===Early hospital treatment===
Initial care in the hospital, as in the prehospital setting, aims to ensure adequate airway, breathing, cardiovascular function, and spinal motion restriction. Imaging of the spine to determine the presence of a SCI may need to wait if emergency surgery is needed to stabilize other life-threatening injuries. Acute SCI merits treatment in an intensive care unit, especially injuries to the cervical spinal cord. People with SCI need repeated neurological assessments and treatment by neurosurgeons. People should be removed from the spine board as rapidly as possible to prevent complications from its use.

====Blood pressure====
If the systolic blood pressure falls below 90 mmHg within days of the injury, blood supply to the spinal cord may be reduced, resulting in further damage. Thus it is important to maintain the blood pressure which may be done using intravenous fluids and vasopressors. Vasopressors used include phenylephrine, dopamine, or norepinephrine. Mean arterial blood pressure is measured and kept at 85 to 90 mmHg for seven days after injury.

The CAMPER Trial led by Dr Kwon and subsequent studies by the UCSF TRACK-SCI group (Dhall) have shown that spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP) goals are more closely associated with better neurologic recovery than MAP goals. Some institutions have adopted these SCPP goals and lumbar CSF drain placement as a standard of care. The treatment for shock from blood loss is different from that for neurogenic shock, and could harm people with the latter type, so it is necessary to determine why someone is in shock. However it is also possible for both causes to exist at the same time. Another important aspect of care is prevention of insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream, which could deprive the spinal cord of oxygen. People with cervical or high thoracic injuries may experience a dangerously slowed heart rate; treatment to speed it may include atropine.

====Steroid treatment====
The corticosteroid medication methylprednisolone has been studied for use in spinal cord injury patients with the hope of limiting swelling and secondary injury. As there does not appear to be long term benefits and the medication is associated with risks such as gastrointestinal bleeding and infection its use is not recommended as of 2018. Its use in traumatic brain injury is also not recommended.

====Surgery====
Surgery may be necessary, e.g. to relieve excess pressure on the cord, to stabilize the spine, or to put vertebrae back in their proper place. In cases involving instability or compression, failing to operate can lead to worsening of the condition. Surgery is also necessary when something is pressing on the cord, such as bone fragments, blood, material from ligaments or intervertebral discs, or a lodged object from a penetrating injury. Although the ideal timing of surgery is still debated, studies have found that earlier surgical intervention (within 12 hours of injury) is associated with better outcomes. This type of surgery is often referred to as &quot;Ultra-Early&quot;, coined by Burke et al. at UCSF. Sometimes a patient has too many other injuries to be a surgical candidate this early. Surgery is controversial because it has potential complications (such as infection), so in cases where it is not clearly needed (e.g. the cord is being compressed), doctors must decide whether to perform surgery based on aspects of the patient&#x27;s condition and their own beliefs about its risks and benefits. Recent large-scale studies have shown that patients who do undergo earlier surgery (within 12–24 hours) experience significantly lower rates of life-threatening complications and spend less time in hospital and critical care.

However, in cases where a more conservative approach is chosen, bed rest, cervical collars, motion restriction devices, and optionally traction are used. Surgeons may opt to put traction on the spine to remove pressure from the spinal cord by putting dislocated vertebrae back into alignment, but herniation of intervertebral disks may prevent this technique from relieving pressure. &quot;Gardner-Wells tongs&quot; are one tool used to exert spinal traction to reduce a fracture or dislocation and to reduce motion to the affected areas.

===Rehabilitation===


Spinal cord injury patients often require extended treatment in specialized spinal unit or an intensive care unit. The rehabilitation process typically begins in the acute care setting. Usually, the inpatient phase lasts 8–12 weeks and then the outpatient rehabilitation phase lasts 3–12 months after that, followed by yearly medical and functional evaluation. Physical therapists, occupational therapists, recreational therapists, nurses, social workers, psychologists, and other health care professionals work as a team under the coordination of a physiatrist to decide on goals with the patient and develop a plan of discharge that is appropriate for the person&#x27;s condition.

In the acute phase physical therapists focus on the patient&#x27;s respiratory status, prevention of indirect complications (such as pressure ulcers), maintaining range of motion, and keeping available musculature active.

For people whose injuries are high enough to interfere with breathing, there is great emphasis on airway clearance during this stage of recovery. Weakness of respiratory muscles impairs the ability to cough effectively, allowing secretions to accumulate within the lungs. As SCI patients have reduced total lung capacity and tidal volume, physical therapists teach them accessory breathing techniques (e.g. apical breathing, glossopharyngeal breathing) that typically are not taught to healthy individuals. Physical therapy treatment for airway clearance may include manual percussions and vibrations, postural drainage, respiratory muscle training, and assisted cough techniques. Patients are taught to increase their intra-abdominal pressure by leaning forward to induce cough and clear mild secretions. The quad cough technique is done lying on the back with the therapist applying pressure on the abdomen in the rhythm of the cough to maximize expiratory flow and mobilize secretions. Manual abdominal compression is another technique used to increase expiratory flow which later improves coughing. Other techniques used to manage respiratory dysfunction include respiratory muscle pacing, use of a constricting abdominal binder, ventilator-assisted speech, and mechanical ventilation.

The amount of functional recovery and independence achieved in terms of activities of daily living, recreational activities, and employment is affected by the level and severity of injury. The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is an assessment tool that aims to evaluate the function of patients throughout the rehabilitation process following a spinal cord injury or other serious illness or injury. It can track a patient&#x27;s progress and degree of independence during rehabilitation. People with SCI may need to use specialized devices and to make modifications to their environment in order to handle activities of daily living and to function independently. Weak joints can be stabilized with devices such as ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) or knee-ankle-foot orthoses (KAFOs), but walking may still require a lot of effort. Increasing activity will increase chances of recovery.

For treatment of paralysis levels in the lower thoracic spine or lower, starting therapy with an orthosis is promising from the intermediate phase (2–26 weeks after the incident). In patients with complete paraplegia (ASIA A), this applies to lesion heights between T12 and S5. In patients with incomplete paraplegia (ASIA B-D), orthoses are even suitable for lesion heights above T12. In both cases, however, a detailed muscle function test must be carried out to precisely plan the construction with an orthosis.

==Prognosis==

Spinal cord injuries generally result in at least some incurable impairment even with the best possible treatment. The best predictor of prognosis is the level and completeness of injury, as measured by the ASIA impairment scale. The neurological score at the initial evaluation done 72 hours after injury is the best predictor of how much function will return. Most people with ASIA scores of A (complete injuries) do not have functional motor recovery, but improvement can occur. Most patients with incomplete injuries recover at least some function. Chances of recovering the ability to walk improve with each AIS grade found at the initial examination; e.g. an ASIA D score confers a better chance of walking than a score of C. The symptoms of incomplete injuries can vary and it is difficult to make an accurate prediction of the outcome. A person with a mild, incomplete injury at the T5 vertebra will have a much better chance of using his or her legs than a person with a severe, complete injury at exactly the same place. Of the incomplete SCI syndromes, Brown-Séquard and central cord syndromes have the best prognosis for recovery and anterior cord syndrome has the worst.

People with nontraumatic causes of SCI have been found to be less likely to develop complete injuries and some complications such as pressure sores and deep vein thrombosis, and to have shorter hospital stays. Their scores on functional tests were better than those of people with traumatic SCI upon hospital admission, but when they were tested upon discharge, those with traumatic SCI had improved such that both groups&#x27; results were the same. In addition to the completeness and level of the injury, age and concurrent health problems affect the extent to which a person with SCI will be able to live independently and to walk. However, in general people with injuries to L3 or below will likely be able to walk functionally, T10 and below to walk around the house with bracing, and C7 and below to live independently. New therapies are beginning to provide hope for better outcomes in patients with SCI, but most are in the experimental/translational stage.

One important predictor of motor recovery in an area is presence of sensation there, particularly pain perception. Most motor recovery occurs in the first year post-injury, but modest improvements can continue for years; sensory recovery is more limited. Recovery is typically quickest during the first six months. Spinal shock, in which reflexes are suppressed, occurs immediately after the injury and resolves largely within three months but continues resolving gradually for another 15.

Sexual dysfunction after spinal injury is common. Problems that can occur include erectile dysfunction, loss of ability to ejaculate, insufficient lubrication of the vagina, and reduced sensation and impaired ability to orgasm. Despite this, many people learn ways to adapt their sexual practices so they can lead satisfying sex lives.

Although life expectancy has improved with better care options, it is still not as good as the uninjured population. The higher the level of injury, and the more complete the injury, the greater the reduction in life expectancy. Mortality is very elevated within a year of injury.

==Epidemiology==
Worldwide, the number of new cases since 1995 of SCI ranges from 10.4 to 83 people per million per year. This wide range of numbers is probably partly due to differences among regions in whether and how injuries are reported. In North America, about 39 people per every million incur SCI traumatically each year, and in Western Europe, the incidence is 16 per million. In the United States, the incidence of spinal cord injury has been estimated to be about 40 cases per 1 million people per year or around 12,000 cases per year. In China, the incidence is approximately 60,000 per year.

The estimated number of people living with SCI in the world ranges from 236 to 4187 per million. Estimates vary widely due to differences in how data are collected and what techniques are used to extrapolate the figures. Little information is available from Asia, and even less from Africa and South America. In Western Europe the estimated prevalence is 300 per million people and in North America it is 853 per million. It is estimated at 440 per million in Iran, 526 per million in Iceland, and 681 per million in Australia. In the United States there are between 225,000 and 296,000 individuals living with spinal cord injuries, and different studies have estimated prevalences from 525 to 906 per million.

SCI is present in about 2% of all cases of blunt force trauma. Anyone who has undergone force sufficient to cause a thoracic spinal injury is at high risk for other injuries also. In 44% of SCI cases, other serious injuries are sustained at the same time; 14% of SCI patients also have head trauma or facial trauma. Other commonly associated injuries include chest trauma, abdominal trauma, pelvic fractures, and long bone fractures.
Males account for four out of five traumatic spinal cord injuries. Most of these injuries occur in men under 30 years of age. The average age at the time of injury has slowly increased from about 29 years in the 1970s to 41. In Pakistan, spinal cord injury is more common in males (92.68%) as compared to females in the 20–30 years of age group with a median age of 40 years, although people from 12–70 years of age suffered from spinal cord injury Rates of injury are at their lowest in children, at their highest in the late teens to early twenties, then get progressively lower in older age groups; however rates may rise in the elderly. In Sweden between 50 and 70% of all cases of SCI occur in people under 30, and 25% occur in those over 50. While SCI rates are highest among people age 15–20, fewer than 3% of SCIs occur in people under 15. Neonatal SCI occurs in one in 60,000 births, e.g. from breech births or injuries by forceps. The difference in rates between the sexes diminishes in injuries at age 3 and younger; the same number of girls are injured as boys, or possibly more. Another cause of pediatric injury is child abuse such as shaken baby syndrome. For children, the most common cause of SCI (56%) is vehicle crashes. High numbers of adolescent injuries are attributable in a large part to traffic accidents and sports injuries. For people over 65, falls are the most common cause of traumatic SCI. The elderly and people with severe arthritis are at high risk for SCI because of defects in the spinal column. In nontraumatic SCI, the gender difference is smaller, the average age of occurrence is greater, and incomplete lesions are more common.

==History==

Spinal cord injury has been known to be devastating for millennia; the ancient Egyptian Edwin Smith Papyrus from 2500 BC, the first known description of the injury, says it is &quot;not to be treated&quot;. Hindu texts dating back to 1800 BC also mention SCI and describe traction techniques to straighten the spine. The Greek physician Hippocrates, born in the fifth century BC, described SCI in his Hippocratic Corpus and invented traction devices to straighten dislocated vertebrae. But it was not until Aulus Cornelius Celsus, born 30 BC, noted that a cervical injury resulted in rapid death that the spinal cord itself was implicated in the condition. In the second century AD the Greek physician Galen experimented on monkeys and reported that a horizontal cut through the spinal cord caused them to lose all sensation and motion below the level of the cut. The seventh-century Greek physician Paul of Aegina described surgical techniques for treatment of broken vertebrae by removing bone fragments, as well as surgery to relieve pressure on the spine. Little medical progress was made during the Middle Ages in Europe; it was not until the Renaissance that the spine and nerves were accurately depicted in human anatomy drawings by Leonardo da Vinci and Andreas Vesalius.

In 1762, Andre Louis, a surgeon, removed a bullet from the lumbar spine of a patient, who regained motion in the legs. In 1829, Gilpin Smith, a surgeon, performed a successful laminectomy that improved the patient&#x27;s sensation. However, the idea that SCI was untreatable remained predominant until the early 20th century. In 1934, the mortality rate in the first two years after injury was over 80%, mostly due to infections of the urinary tract and pressure sores, the latter of which were believed to be intrinsic to SCI rather than a result of continuous bedrest. It was not until the second half of the century that breakthroughs in imaging, surgery, medical care, and rehabilitation medicine contributed to a substantial improvement in SCI care. The relative incidence of incomplete compared to complete injuries has improved since the mid-20th century, due mainly to the emphasis on faster and better initial care and stabilization of spinal cord injury patients. The creation of emergency medical services to professionally transport people to the hospital is given partial credit for an improvement in outcomes since the 1970s. Improvements in care have been accompanied by increased life expectancy of people with SCI; survival times have improved by about 2000% since 1940. In 2015/2016 23% of people in nine spinal injury centres in England had their discharge delayed because of disputes about who should pay for the equipment they needed.

==Research directions==
Scientists are investigating various avenues for treatment of spinal cord injury. Therapeutic research is focused on two main areas: neuroprotection and neuroregeneration. The former seeks to prevent the harm that occurs from secondary injury in the minutes to weeks following the insult, and the latter aims to reconnect the broken circuits in the spinal cord to allow function to return. Neuroprotective drugs target secondary injury effects including inflammation, damage by free radicals, excitotoxicity (neuronal damage by excessive glutamate signaling), and apoptosis (cell suicide). Several potentially neuroprotective agents that target pathways like these are under investigation in human clinical trials.

Stem cell transplantation is an important avenue for SCI research: the goal is to replace lost spinal cord cells, allow reconnection in broken neural circuits by regrowing axons, and to create an environment in the tissues that is favorable to growth. A key avenue of SCI research is research on stem cells, which can differentiate into other types of cells—including those lost after SCI. Types of cells being researched for use in SCI include embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, Schwann cells, activated macrophages, and induced pluripotent stem cells. Hundreds of stem cell studies have been done in humans, with promising but inconclusive results. An ongoing Phase 2 trial in 2016 presented data showing that after 90 days, 2 out of 4 subjects had already improved two motor levels and had thus already achieved its endpoint of 2/5 patients improving two levels within 6–12 months. Six-month data was expected in January 2017.

Another type of approach is tissue engineering, using biomaterials to help scaffold and rebuild damaged tissues. Biomaterials being investigated include natural substances such as collagen or agarose and synthetic ones like polymers and nitrocellulose. They fall into two categories: hydrogels and nanofibers. These materials can also be used as a vehicle for delivering gene therapy to tissues.

One avenue being explored to allow paralyzed people to walk and to aid in rehabilitation of those with some walking ability is the use of wearable powered robotic exoskeletons. The devices, which have motorized joints, are put on over the legs and supply a source of power to move and walk. Several such devices are already available for sale, but investigation is still underway as to how they can be made more useful.

Preliminary studies of epidural spinal cord stimulators for motor complete injuries have demonstrated some improvement, and in some cases to enable walking to some degree bypassing the injury.

In 2014, Darek Fidyka underwent pioneering spinal surgery that used nerve grafts, from his ankle, to bridge the gap in his severed spinal cord and olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) to stimulate the spinal cord cells. The surgery was performed in Poland in collaboration with Prof. Geoff Raisman, chair of neural regeneration at University College London&#x27;s Institute of Neurology, and his research team. The OECs were taken from the patient&#x27;s olfactory bulbs in his brain and then grown in the lab, these cells were then injected above and below the impaired spinal tissue.

There have been a number of advances in technological spinal cord injury treatment, including the use of implants that provided a &quot;digital bridge&quot; between the brain and the spinal cord. In a study published in May 2023 in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, researchers in Switzerland described such implants which allowed a 40-year old man, paralyzed from the hips down for 12 years, to stand, walk and ascend a steep ramp with only the assistance of a walker. More than a year after the implant was inserted, he has retained these abilities and was walking with crutches even when the implant was switched off.

<text>David Herbert Donald (October 1, 1920 – May 17, 2009) was an American historian, best known for his 1995 biography of Abraham Lincoln. He twice won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography for earlier works; he published more than 30 books on United States political and literary figures and the history of the American South.

==Early life and education==
David Herbert Donald was born in Goodman, Mississippi, a town in the center of Holmes County. The county&#x27;s western border is formed by the Yazoo River and it is part of the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta.

Majoring in history and sociology, Donald earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Millsaps College in Jackson, Mississippi. After earning a master&#x27;s degree in history (1942) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, he earned his PhD in 1946 under eminent Lincoln scholar James G. Randall at the same institution. Randall as a mentor influenced Donald&#x27;s life and career. He encouraged his protégé to write his dissertation on Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s law partner, William Herndon. Donald adapted and published the dissertation as his first book, &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Herndon&quot; (1948).

==Career==
After completing his doctorate, Donald taught at Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University and, from 1973, Harvard University. He also taught at Smith College, the University of North Wales (on a Fulbright grant), Princeton University, University College London and served as Harmsworth Professor of American History at Oxford University. At Johns Hopkins, Columbia, and Harvard he trained dozens of graduate students, including Heather Cox Richardson, Jean H. Baker, William J. Cooper Jr., Michael Holt, Irwin Unger, Ari Hoogenboom, and Richard R. John.

Donald served as president of the Southern Historical Association. Donald also served on the editorial board for the Papers of Abraham Lincoln.

Donald was the Charles Warren Professor of American History (emeritus from 1991) at Harvard University. He wrote more than thirty books, including well-received biographies of Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Wolfe and Charles Sumner. He specialized in the American Civil War and Reconstruction periods, and in the history of the American South.

==Legacy and honors==
Donald received the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography twice, in 1961 for &quot;Charles Sumner and the Coming of the Civil War&quot; and in 1988 for &quot;Look Homeward: A Life of Thomas Wolfe.&quot; He also received several honorary degrees.

Donald received the American Academy of Achievement&#x27;s Golden Plate Award in 1997.

Donald was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 2008 in the area of Communications and Education.

In 2000, Donald received The Lincoln Forum&#x27;s Richard Nelson Current Award of Achievement.

==Works==
In his introduction, Carl Sandburg, the poet and Lincoln biographer, hailed Donald&#x27;s first book as the answer to scholars&#x27; prayers: &quot;When is someone going to do the life of Bill Herndon. Isn&#x27;t it about time? Now the question is out.&quot;

David M. Potter, a Civil War scholar, said that Donald&#x27;s biography of Charles Sumner portrayed &quot;Sumner as a man with acute psychological inadequacies&quot; and exposed Sumner&#x27;s &quot;facade of pompous rectitude.&quot; Donald&#x27;s evenhanded approach to Sumner, Potter concluded, was a model for biographers working with a difficult subject. &quot;If it does not make Sumner attractive [the book] certainly makes him understandable.&quot; His biography of Lincoln &quot;is often considered the best single-volume biography of Lincoln ever.&quot;

==Personal life and death==

Donald lived in Lincoln, Massachusetts, with his wife Aida DiPace Donald, who was a historian and author. His wife also served as a senior editor and then as editor-in-chief at the Harvard University Press. He died of heart failure in Boston on May 17, 2009. Donald was survived by his wife, his son Bruce Donald and two granddaughters.

<doc id="1053960" wikidata="Q856679" url="?curid=1053960" title="Mangle (machine)">
<text>A mangle is a mechanical laundry aid consisting of two rollers in a sturdy frame, connected by cogs and (in its home version) powered by a hand crank or by electricity. 

Mangles are used to press or flatten sheets, tablecloths, kitchen towels, or clothing and other laundry. In the South Wales Valleys (particularly Hengoed), the Sandwich mangle is used to flatten sandwiches. The &quot;wringer&quot;, a smaller lighter machine of similar appearance and function, was used to squeeze the water out of wet washing. While mangles remain in use in commercial settings, wringers have been made redundant by the spin dry cycle on modern washing machines.

== History ==
===Clothes press===


The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dates the first use of the word mangle in English from 1598, quoting John Florio who, in his 1598 dictionary, &quot;A World of Words&quot;, described &quot;a kind of press to press buckram, fustian, or dyed linen cloth, to make it have a luster or gloss&quot;. The word comes from the Dutch &quot;mangel&quot;, from &quot;mangelen&quot; &quot;to mangle&quot;, which in turn derives from the medieval Latin &quot;mango&quot; or &quot;manga&quot; which ultimately comes from the Greek &quot;manganon&quot;, meaning &quot;axis&quot; or &quot;engine&quot;. 

Some northern European countries used a table version for centuries, the device consisting of the rolling pin, a wood cylinder around which the damp cloth was wrapped, and the mangle board, a curved or flat length of wood which was used to roll and flatten the cloth. The oldest known model is a Norwegian mangle board, found near Bergen and dated 1444.

In the second half of the 19th century, commercial laundries began using steam-powered mangles or ironers. Gradually, the electric washing machine&#x27;s spin cycle rendered this use of a mangle obsolete, and with it the need to wring out water from clothes mechanically. Box mangles were large and primarily intended for pressing laundry smooth; they were used by wealthy households, large commercial laundries, and self-employed &quot;mangle women&quot;. Middle-class households and independent washerwomen used upright mangles for wringing water out of laundry, and in the later 19th century they were more widely used than early washing machines. The rollers were typically made of wood, or sometimes rubber.

The Steel Roll Mangle Co. of 108 Franklin Street, Chicago, Illinois, offered a gas-heated home mangle for pressing linens in 1902. In the 1930s electric mangles were developed and are still a feature of many laundry rooms. They consist of a rotating padded drum which revolves against a heating element which can be stationary, or can also be a rotating drum. Laundry is fed into the turning mangle and emerges flat and pressed on the other side. This process takes much less time than ironing with the usual iron and ironing board.

There were many electric rotary ironers on the American market including Solent, Thor, Ironrite and Apex. By the 1940s the list had grown to include Bendix, General Electric, Kenmore and Maytag. By the 1950s, home ironers, or mangles, as they came to be called, were becoming popular time-savers for the homemaker.

===Drying clothes===

When home washing machines were first invented, they were just for washing: a tub on legs or wheels. A hand-cranked mangle appeared on top after 1843 when John E. Turnbull of Saint John, New Brunswick patented a &quot;Clothes Washer With Wringer Rolls&quot;. The first geared wringer mangle in the UK is thought to date to about 1850, when one was invented by Robert Tasker of Lancashire. It was a smaller, upright version of the box mangle.

== Current use ==

Small domestic pressing mangles may be more common in some countries than in others. They are typically not sold in North American stores. In contrast to their use in homes, mangles have become an essential feature of commercial or large-scale laundries. They are typically used to press flat items such as sheets or tablecloths, and also are far quicker and more energy-efficient for removing most of the water than a clothes dryer. Skilled operators can also press shirts and trousers on a mangle.

A significant benefit of mangling is reduced dust. When washing, the ends of the surface fibers tend to loosen and stick out when dried. The clothes are then much more sensitive to trap dust, dirt and grease, and to shed off fibers. Mangling presses the fiber ends back onto the fiber, so that the clothes remain clean longer. This could potentially reduce dust approximately 10 to 60 times; however, this is not confirmed. Mangles are most often used for bed sheets, tablecloths and towels, which would be time-consuming to iron by hand.

=== Artistic use ===
Artists, such as Barbara Brash have adapted mangles to serve as printing presses,&lt;ref name=&quot;gfsmith/mangle&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which they resemble in construction. By fixing a metal platen, on which printing plate and paper are placed, permanently between the rollers, which themselves may be replaced by, or sheathed in, turned metal cylinders; they thus make a serviceable and much less expensive alternative to a commercial cylinder etching press.

<doc id="1053968" wikidata="Q2303951" url="?curid=1053968" title="Myelopathy">
<text>Myelopathy describes any neurologic deficit related to the spinal cord. The most common form of myelopathy in humans, &quot;cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM)&quot;, also called &quot;degenerative cervical myelopathy&quot;, results from narrowing of the spinal canal (spinal stenosis) ultimately causing compression of the spinal cord. 
When due to trauma, myelopathy is known as (acute) spinal cord injury. When inflammatory, it is known as myelitis. Disease that is vascular in nature is known as vascular myelopathy.

In Asian populations, spinal cord compression often occurs due to a different, inflammatory process affecting the posterior longitudinal ligament.

==Presentation==
Clinical signs and symptoms depend on which spinal cord level (cervical, thoracic, or lumbar) is affected and the extent (anterior, posterior, or lateral) of the pathology, and may include:
* Upper motor neuron signs—weakness, spasticity, clumsiness, altered tonus, hyperreflexia and pathological reflexes, including Hoffmann&#x27;s sign and inverted plantar reflex (positive Babinski sign) 
* Lower motor neuron signs—weakness, clumsiness in the muscle group innervated at the level of spinal cord compromise, muscle atrophy, hyporeflexia, muscle hypotonicity or flaccidity, fasciculations
* Sensory deficits
* Bowel/bladder symptoms and sexual dysfunction

== Diagnosis ==
=== Diagnosis of myelopathy ===
Myelopathy is primarily diagnosed by clinical exam findings. Because the term &quot;myelopathy&quot; describes a clinical syndrome that can be caused by many pathologies the differential diagnosis of myelopathy is extensive. In some cases the onset of myelopathy is rapid, in others, such as CSM, the course may be insidious with symptoms developing slowly over a period of months. As a consequence, the diagnosis of CSM is often delayed. As the disease is thought to be progressive, this may impact negatively on outcome.

=== Diagnosis of etiology ===
Once the clinical diagnosis &quot;myelopathy&quot; is established, the underlying cause must be investigated. Most commonly this involves medical imaging. The best way to visualize the spinal cord is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Apart from T1 and T2 MRI images, which are commonly used for routine diagnosis, more recently researchers are exploring quantitative MRI signals. Further imaging modalities used for evaluating myelopathy include plain X-rays for detecting arthritic changes of the bones, and Computer Tomography, which is often used for pre-operative planning of surgical interventions for cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Angiography is used to examine blood vessels in suspected cases of vascular myelopathy.

The presence and severity of myelopathy can also be evaluated by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a neurophysiological method that allows the measurement of the time required for a neural impulse to cross the pyramidal tracts, starting from the cerebral cortex and ending at the anterior horn cells of the cervical, thoracic or lumbar spinal cord. This measurement is called &quot;Central Conduction Time&quot; (&quot;CCT&quot;). TMS can aid physicians to:

* Determine whether myelopathy exists
* Identify the level of the spinal cord where myelopathy is located. This is especially useful in cases where more than two lesions may be responsible for the clinical symptoms and signs, such as in patients with two or more cervical disc hernias
* Follow-up the progression of myelopathy in time, for example before and after cervical spine surgery

TMS can also help in the differential diagnosis of different causes of pyramidal tract damage.

== Treatment ==
The treatment and prognosis of myelopathy depends on the underlying cause: myelopathy caused by infection requires medical treatment with pathogen specific antibiotics. Similarly, specific treatments exist for multiple sclerosis, which may also present with myelopathy. As outlined above, the most common form of myelopathy is secondary to degeneration of the cervical spine. Newer findings have challenged the existing controversy with respect to surgery for cervical spondylotic myelopathy by demonstrating that patients benefit from surgery.

<doc id="1053973" wikidata="Q1634991" url="?curid=1053973" title="Operation Thunderbolt (video game)">
<text>Operation Thunderbolt is a light gun shooter video game developed by Taito and released for arcades in 1988. As the sequel to &quot;Operation Wolf&quot;, changes include two-player gameplay with two positional gun controllers mounted on the arcade cabinet, and a new forward-scrolling pseudo-3D perspective combined with side-scrolling sections.

The arcade game was a commercial success and was one of the top three highest-grossing dedicated arcade games of 1989 in both Japan and the United States. Versions were released for Amiga, Commodore 64, and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The arcade exclusive sequel &quot;Operation Wolf 3&quot; was released in 1994.

==Gameplay==
Green berets Roy Adams and Hardy Jones must save American hostages from a hijacked airliner which was forced to land in the fictional African province, Kalubya. They must capture six different bases, shoot enemies with machine guns or grenade launcher, and try to save the hostages. Enemies include soldiers, jeeps, tanks, and helicopters, attacking with bullets, grenades, or rockets.

In stages 4 and 6, killing one of the hostages will decrease the player&#x27;s life. At least one hostage must be rescued in those stages, or the game is over. In Stage 8, the players must engage with the lead hijacker holding the pilot hostage. Continues are not permitted. If the pilot gets killed, a bad ending will be shown &quot;The pilot is dead; escape is impossible&quot;. If the hijacker is killed, the good ending will be shown where the player and hostages flee the hostile nation, with the plane&#x27;s takeoff.

Changes from &quot;Operation Wolf&quot; include the arcade cabinet using positional gun controllers instead of light gun, two-player simultaneous play with two mounted guns, and a new forward-scrolling pseudo-3D perspective combined with side-scrolling sections.

==Ports==

Ocean Software published conversions of &quot;Operation Thunderbolt&quot; for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC 464, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum in 1989. A cartridge version for the Amstrad GX4000 followed in 1993.

The Super NES version was released by Taito in 1994 and works with the SNES Mouse and the Super Scope. The player can choose from a variety of different characters. The storyline was altered so that the hijackers were members of the fictional Bintazi People&#x27;s Republic, under lifelong dictator General Abul Bazarre, who demands that his comrades be freed or the hostages will be executed.

==Influence==
The story for the game is loosely based on the plot of the film by the same name, which in turn was based on the real-life Entebbe raid that occurred on July 4, 1976.

==Reception==

In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Operation Thunderbolt&quot; in its February 1, 1989 issue as the second most successful upright arcade unit of the month. It became Japan&#x27;s second highest-grossing dedicated arcade game of 1989, below &quot;Chase H.Q.&quot; In the United States, &quot;Operation Thunderbolt&quot; was the third highest grossing dedicated arcade game of 1989. &quot;Operation Thunderbolt&quot; was also Japan&#x27;s eighth highest-grossing dedicated arcade game of 1990.

===Reviews===
The arcade game received positive reviews from critics, upon release. &quot;Commodore User&quot; said it &quot;takes all the best elements&quot; of &quot;Operation Wolf&quot;, including &quot;the brilliant graphics&quot; and &quot;action blasting&quot;, and added &quot;a two-player option, a brand new perspective and some really clever scenario ideas&quot;.

Reviewing the Super NES version, &quot;GamePro&quot; praised the colorful and detailed graphics and strong sound effects, but criticized the repetitiveness of the gameplay and the slowness of the aiming reticule, and concluded that this &quot;Operation&quot; is a success. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; dismissed it as another shooting-gallery game.

===Accolades===
The game won the 1989 award for best graphics of the year according to the readers of &quot;Crash&quot; magazine.

At a British game industry awards event held at the end of 1989, &quot;Operation Thunderbolt&quot; was awarded &quot;Best 16-bit arcade license translation&quot; for Ocean Software&#x27;s home computer conversions.

==Legacy==
&quot;Operation Thunderbolt&quot; is in the &quot;Taito Legends&quot; compilation for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox.

<doc id="1053986" wikidata="Q6266427" url="?curid=1053986" title="Johnny Callison">
<text>John Wesley Callison (March 12, 1939 – October 12, 2006) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 16 seasons and is best known for the 10 years he spent with the Philadelphia Phillies as a right fielder, from 1960 through 1969. He was an All-Star for three seasons and four All-Star games. He led the National League (NL) in triples twice and doubles once, and gained his greatest prominence in the season in which he was named the MVP of the All-Star Game and he was the runner-up for the NL Most Valuable Player Award. He also led the NL in outfield assists four consecutive times and in double plays once, and ended his career among the top five Phillies in home runs (185) and triples (84).

==Early years==
Born in Qualls, Oklahoma, Callison batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He was signed by the Chicago White Sox out of East Bakersfield High School in 1957, being assigned to the Class-C Bakersfield Bears in the California League, where he had a .340 batting average with 17 home runs and 31 stolen bases. The next season, he was advanced to the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians, where he led the American Association in home runs. In September , he was recalled by the White Sox, where he had a .297 batting average in 18 games.

In 1959, Callison split time between Chicago and Indianapolis. He was not on the World Series roster when the White Sox lost the series to the Los Angeles Dodgers, and in December he was traded to the Phillies for third baseman Gene Freese.

==Baseball career==
Callison became a fan favorite in Philadelphia; Supreme Court Justice and lifelong Phillies fan Samuel Alito recalls he &quot;adopted Johnny Callison out there in right field&quot; as a boy. Over the next decade, Callison would be named to the NL All-Star roster three times (1962, 64-65). In , he batted an even .300, the only time he would reach that mark, and led the NL with 10 triples. On June 27, , he hit for the cycle against the Pittsburgh Pirates.

The 1964 season became best remembered, however, for the Phillies&#x27; late-season collapse; despite a -game lead with 12 games to play, the Phillies lost 10 in a row and finished one game behind the St. Louis Cardinals. Manager Gene Mauch was criticized for his handling of the pitching staff over the final two weeks, but players such as slugging rookie third baseman Richie Allen also drew harsh treatment. Callison was 12-for-48 during the last 12 games, including a 3-homer game on September 27 against the Milwaukee Braves which the Phillies still lost 14–8, dropping them out of first place for the first time since July. With the Phillies behind by two on September 29, Callison did not start because he had the flu with chills and fever. However, Callison pinch-hit late in the game and managed a single. He reached first base and would not come out, so the Cardinals and the umpires allowed him to wear his Phillies jacket on the base paths, against MLB rules; due to his high fever, Callison needed help from Bill White to button his jacket. Despite the disappointing second-place finish for Philadelphia, Callison ended the year third in the league in home runs (31) and fifth in runs batted in (104). He earned two first-place votes for the MVP Award, won by Ken Boyer of the World Series champion Cardinals. In the 1964 All-Star Game at Shea Stadium in New York on July 7, Callison hit a game-winning walk-off home run off Red Sox pitcher Dick Radatz with two out in the ninth inning, a three-run shot to right field to give the NL a 7–4 victory; it was only the third walk-off home run in All-Star history (and the last one as of 2022), with Callison joining legends Ted Williams and Stan Musial in baseball annals.

In 1965, Callison again led the NL with a career-high 16 triples, once more topping 30 home runs and 100 RBI; on June 6, he hit three home runs against the Cubs and the Phillies won 10-9. In , he paced the league with 40 doubles. Callison also is remembered for being an excellent outfielder with a formidable throwing arm. He led the NL in fielding average as a right fielder in 1963 and 1964, and his throwing accuracy helped him lead the NL in outfield assists (24) and double plays (7) in 1962 and he topped the league in assists the next three years with totals of 26, 19, and 21. But his power production fell off sharply, and he failed to collect 20 homers or 65 RBI in any of his last four Phillies seasons. After the 1969 season, he was traded to the Cubs, and he posted 1970 totals of 19 home runs and 68 RBI before hitting only .210 in 1971 with just 8 home runs. In January 1972 he was traded to the New York Yankees, and he found limited playing time over two years, closing his career with a .176 average, one home run, and 10 RBI in 45 games in .

Callison was a career .264 hitter with 226 home runs, 926 runs, 840 RBI, 1,757 hits, 321 doubles, 89 triples, and 74 stolen bases in 1,886 games. He recorded a .984 fielding percentage at all three outfield positions.

==Life after baseball==
Callison was a player-coach with the Philadelphia Athletics, a professional softball team that played at Veterans Stadium in the 1978 season of the American Professional Slo-Pitch League (APSPL).

Callison would remain in Philadelphia where he made frequent appearances and had several business ventures.

== Death ==
A resident of Glenside, a northern suburb of Philadelphia, Callison died in 2006 in Abington, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="1053990" wikidata="Q1412049" url="?curid=1053990" title="Figure (music)">
<text>A musical figure or figuration is the shortest idea in music; a short succession of notes, often recurring. It may have melodic pitch, harmonic progression, and rhythmic meter. The 1964 &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; defines the figure as &quot;the exact counterpart of the German &#x27;motiv&#x27; and the French &#x27;motif: it produces a &quot;single complete and distinct impression&quot;. To the self-taught Roger Scruton, however, a figure is distinguished from a motif in that a figure is background while a motif is foreground: 
Allen Forte describes the term &quot;figuration&quot; as being applied to two distinct things:

A phrase originally presented or heard as a motif may become a figure that accompanies another melody, such as in the second movement of Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;String Quartet&quot;. It is perhaps best to view a figure as a motif when it has special importance in a piece. According to White, motives are, &quot;significant in the structure of the work,&quot; while figures or figurations are not and, &quot;may often occur in accompaniment passages or in transitional or connective material designed to link two sections together,&quot; with the former being more common.

Minimalist music may be constructed entirely from figures. Scruton describes music by Philip Glass such as &quot;Akhnaten&quot; as &quot;nothing &quot;but&quot; figures...endless daisy-chains&quot;.

A basic figure is known as a riff in American popular music.

== Importance of Figures ==
Figures play a most important part in instrumental music, in which it is necessary that a strong and definite impression should be produced to answer the purpose of words, and convey the sense of vitality to the otherwise incoherent succession of sounds. In pure vocal music this is not the case, as on the one hand the words assist the audience to follow and understand what they hear, and on the other the quality of voices in combination is such as to render strong characteristic features somewhat inappropriate. But without strongly marked figures the very reason of existence of instrumental movements can hardly be perceived, and the success of a movement of any dimensions must ultimately depend, to a very large extent, on the appropriate development of the figures which are contained in the chief subjects. &quot;The common expression that a subject is very &#x27;workable,&#x27; merely means that it contains well-marked figures;&quot; though it must be observed on the other hand, that there are not a few instances in which masterly treatment has invested with powerful interest a figure which at first sight would seem altogether deficient in character.

== Examples ==
As clear an instance as could be given of the breaking up of a subject into its constituent figures for the purpose of development, is the treatment of the first subject of Beethoven&#x27;s Pastoral Symphony, which he breaks up into three figures corresponding to the first three bars.&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \key f \major \time 2/4 \relative c&quot; { r8^\markup { (a) } a([ bes) d-.] | c(^\markup { (b) } bes16 a) g8-. c,-. | f(^\markup { (c) } g a bes16 a) | g2 | } }&lt;/score&gt;As an example of his treatment of (&quot;a&quot;) may be taken—&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \key f \major \time 2/4 \relative c&#x27; { f8-.[ f( g) bes-.] | a-.[ a( bes) d-.] | c-.[ c( d) f-.] | ees-.[ d( ees) g-.] | s4_\markup { &amp;c.;} } }&lt;/score&gt;(&quot;b&quot;) is twice repeated no less than thirty-six times successively in the development of the movement; and (&quot;c&quot;) appears at the close as follows:&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \key f \major \time 2/4 \relative c&#x27; { f8-. g-. a( bes16 a) | g8-. a-. bes( c16 bes) | a8-. bes-. c( d16 c) | bes8-.[ c-. d-. e-.] | f-. g-. a( bes16 a) | g8-. a-. bes( c16 bes) | a8-. bes-. c( d16 c) | bes8-.[ c-. d-. e-.] | f s } }&lt;/score&gt;Examples of this kind of treatment of the figures contained in subjects are very numerous in classical instrumental music, in various degrees of refinement and ingenuity; as in the 1st movement of Mozart&#x27;s G minor Symphony; in the same movement of Beethoven&#x27;s 8th Symphony; and in a large number of Bach&#x27;s fugues, as for instance Nos. 2, 7, 16, of the Wohltemperirte Klavier. The beautiful little musical poem, the 18th fugue of that series, contains as happy a specimen of this device as could be cited.

In music of an ideally high order, everything should be recognizable as having a meaning; or, in other words, every part of the music should be capable of being analyzed into figures, so that even the most insignificant instrument in the orchestra should not be merely making sounds to fill up the mass of the harmony, but should be playing something which is worth playing in itself. It is of course impossible for any but the highest genius to carry this out consistently, but in proportion as music approaches to this ideal, it is of a high order as a work of art, and in the measure in which it recedes from it, it approaches more nearly to the mass of base, slovenly, or false contrivances which lie at the other extreme, and are not works of art at all. This will be very well recognized by a comparison of Schubert a method of treating the accompaniment of his songs and the method adopted in the large proportion of the thousands of &#x27;popular&#x27; songs which annually make their appearance in this country. For even when the figure is as simple as in &quot;Wohin, Mein,&quot; or &quot;Ave Maria,&quot; the figure is there, and is clearly recognized, and is as different from mere sound or stuffing to support the voice as a living creature is from dead and inert clay.

=== Bach and Beethoven ===
Bach and Beethoven were the great masters in the use of figures, and both were content at times to make a short figure of three or four notes the basis of a whole movement. As examples of this may be quoted the truly famous rhythmic figure of the C minor Symphony (&quot;d&quot;), the figure of the Scherzo of the 9th Symphony (&quot;e&quot;), and the figure of the first movement of the last Sonata, in C minor (&quot;f&quot;). As a beautiful example from Bach may be quoted the Adagio from the Toccata in D minor (&quot;g&quot;), but it must be said that examples in his works are almost innumerable, and will meet the student at every turn.&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \key c \minor \time 2/4 { r8\ff^\markup { (d) } g&#x27;[ g&#x27; g&#x27;] | ees&#x27;2\fermata \bar &quot;||&quot; \set Staff.printKeyCancellation = ##f \key d \minor \time 3/4 d4.^\markup { (e) } d&quot;8 d&quot;4 | r2. | a&quot;4. a&#x27;8 a&#x27;4 \bar &quot;||&quot; \set Staff.printKeyCancellation = ##f \key c \minor \clef bass \time 7/4 c4-.^\markup { (f) } ees-. b,4.\sf\fermata \bar &quot;||&quot; \set Staff.printKeyCancellation = ##f \key d \minor \time 7/4 \clef treble r8^\markup { (g) } ees&quot;16([ c&quot;)] c&quot;8.[ c&quot;16] c&quot;-.[\&lt; c&quot;\!( ees&quot;\&gt; c&quot;)]\! c&quot;8 \bar &quot;||&quot; } }&lt;/score&gt;A very peculiar use which Bach occasionally makes of figures, is to use one as the bond of connection running through a whole movement by constant repetition, as in Prelude No. 10 of the Wohltemperirte Klavier, and in the slow movement of the Italian Concerto, where it serves as accompaniment to an impassioned recitative. In this case the figure is not identical on each repetition, but is freely modified, in such a way however that it is always recognized as the same, partly by the rhythm and partly by the relative positions of the successive notes. This manner of modifying a given figure shows a tendency in the direction of a mode of treatment which has become a feature in modern music: namely, the practice of transforming figures in order to show different aspects of the same thought, or to establish a connection between one thought and another by bringing out the characteristics they possess in common. As a simple specimen of this kind of transformation, may be quoted a passage from the first movement of Brahms&#x27;s P.F. Quintet in F minor. The figure stands at first as at (&quot;h&quot;), then by transposition as at (&quot;i&quot;). Its first stage of transformation is (&quot;j&quot;); further (&quot;k&quot;) (&quot;l&quot;) (&quot;m&quot;) are progressive modifications towards the stage (&quot;n&quot;),&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \key f \minor \time 4/4 \relative c&quot; { r8.^\markup { (h) } ges16(\&lt; f8.[\! ees16)]\&gt; ees8\! r16 f16(\&lt; ees8.[\! \override Hairpin #&#x27;to-barline = ##f des16)]\&gt; | des8\! \bar &quot;||&quot; s } }&lt;/score&gt;&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \key f \minor \time 4/4 \relative c&quot; { r8.^\markup { (i) } bes16(\&lt; aes8.[\! ges16)]\&gt; ges8\! r16 aes16(\&lt; ges8.[\! \override Hairpin #&#x27;to-barline = ##f f16)]\&gt; | f8\! \bar &quot;||&quot; s } }&lt;/score&gt;&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \key f \minor \time 4/4 \relative c&quot; { r8^\markup { (j) } ges([ f ees)] f([ ees des)] ees([ | des ces)] \bar &quot;||&quot; s_\markup { \smaller etc. } } }&lt;/score&gt;&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \key f \minor \time 4/4 \relative c { r8^\markup { (k) } des([ ces beses)] des([^\markup { (l) } beses aes)] des([^\markup { (m) } | aes g!)] des&#x27;4(^\markup { (n) } aes g) \bar &quot;||&quot; } }&lt;/score&gt;which, having been repeated twice in different positions, appears finally as the figure immediately attached to the Cadence in D♭, thus—&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;{ \override Score.Rest #&#x27;style = #&#x27;classical \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \key f \minor \time 4/4 \relative c&quot; { r4 aes( des, c) | r des \bar &quot;||&quot; s } }&lt;/score&gt;A similar very fine example—too familiar to need quotation here—is at the close of Beethoven&#x27;s Overture to Coriolan.

The use which Wagner makes of strongly marked figures is very important, as he establishes a consistent connection between the characters and situations and the music by using appropriate figures (&quot;Leitmotive&quot;), which appear whenever the ideas or characters to which they belong come prominently forward.

That figures vary in intensity to an immense degree hardly requires to be pointed out; and it will also be obvious that figures of accompaniment do not require to be so marked as figures which occupy positions of individual importance. With regard to the latter it may be remarked that there is hardly any department in music in which true feeling and inspiration are more absolutely indispensable, since no amount of ingenuity or perseverance can produce such figures as that which opens the C-minor Symphony, or such soul-moving figures as those in the death march of Siegfried in Wagner&#x27;s &#x27;Götterdammerung.&#x27;

As the common notion that music chiefly consists of pleasant tunes grows weaker, the importance of figures becomes proportionately greater. A succession of isolated tunes is always more or less inconsequent, however deftly they may be connected together, but by the appropriate use of figures and groups of figures, such as real musicians only can invent, and the gradual unfolding of all their latent possibilities, continuous and logical works of art may be constructed; such as will not merely tickle the hearer&#x27;s fancy, but arouse profound interest, and raise him mentally and morally to a higher standard.

<doc id="1053994" wikidata="Q1362536" url="?curid=1053994" title="Yield management">
<text>Yield management (YM) is a variable pricing strategy, based on understanding, anticipating and influencing consumer behavior in order to maximize revenue or profits from a fixed, time-limited resource (such as airline seats, hotel room reservations, or advertising inventory). As a specific, inventory-focused branch of revenue management, yield management involves strategic control of inventory to sell the right product to the right customer at the right time for the right price. This process can result in price discrimination, in which customers consuming identical goods or services are charged different prices. Yield management is a large revenue generator for several major industries; Robert Crandall, former Chairman and CEO of American Airlines, gave yield management its name and has called it &quot;the single most important technical development in transportation management since we entered deregulation.&quot;

==Definition==
Yield management (YM) has become part of mainstream business theory and practice over the last fifteen to twenty years. Whether an emerging discipline or a new management science (it has been called both), yield management is a set of yield maximization strategies and tactics to improve the profitability of certain businesses. It is complex because it involves several aspects of management control, including rate management, revenue streams management, and distribution channel management. Yield management is multidisciplinary because it blends elements of marketing, operations, and financial management into a highly successful new approach. Yield management strategists must frequently work with one or more other departments when designing and implementing yield management strategies.

==History==
Deregulation is generally regarded as the catalyst for yield management in the airline industry, but this tends to overlook the role of global distribution systems (GDSs). It is arguable that the fixed pricing paradigm occurs as a result of decentralized consumption. With mass production, pricing became a centralized management activity and customer contact staff focused on customer service exclusively. Electronic commerce, of which the GDSs were the first wave, created an environment where large volumes of sales could be managed without large numbers of customer service staff. They also gave management staff direct access to price at time of consumption and rich data capture for future decision-making.

On January 17, 1985, American Airlines launched Ultimate Super Saver fares in an effort to compete with low cost carrier People Express Airlines. Donald Burr, the CEO of People Express, is quoted as saying &quot;We were a vibrant, profitable company from 1981 to 1985, and then we tipped right over into losing $50 million a month... We had been profitable from the day we started until American came at us with Ultimate Super Savers.&quot; in the book &quot;Revenue Management&quot; by Robert G. Cross, Chairman and CEO of Revenue Analytics. The yield management systems developed at American Airlines were recognized by the Edelman Prize committee of INFORMS for contributing $1.4 billion in a three-year period at the airline.

Yield management spread to other travel and transportation companies in the early 1990s. Notable was implementation of yield management at National Car Rental. In 1993, General Motors was forced to take a $744 million charge against earnings related to its ownership of National Car Rental. In response, National&#x27;s program expanded the definition of yield management to include capacity management, pricing and reservations control. As a result of this program, General Motors was able to sell National Car Rental for an estimated $1.2 billion. Yield management gave way to the more general practice of revenue management. Whereas revenue management involves predicting consumer behavior by segmenting markets, forecasting demand, and optimizing prices for several different types of products, yield management refers specifically to maximizing revenue through inventory control. Some notable revenue management implementations include the NBC which credits its system with $200 million in improved ad sales from 1996 to 2000, the target pricing initiative at UPS, and revenue management at Texas Children&#x27;s Hospital. Since 2000, much of the dynamic pricing, promotions management and dynamic packaging that underlie e commerce sites leverage revenue management techniques. In 2002 GMAC launched an early implementation of web based revenue management in the financial services industry.

There have also been high-profile failures and faux pas. Amazon.com was criticized for irrational price changes that resulted from a revenue management software bug. The Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s plans for a dynamic pricing vending machine were put on hold as a result of negative consumer reactions. Revenue management is also blamed for much of the financial difficulty currently experienced by legacy carriers. The reliance of the major carriers on high fares in captive markets arguably created the conditions for low-cost carriers to thrive.

==Use by industry==
There are three essential conditions for yield management to be applicable:
* That there is a fixed amount of resources available for sale.
* That the resources sold are perishable (there is a time limit to selling the resources, after which they cease to be of value).
* That different customers are willing to pay a different price for using the same amount of resources.
If the resources available are not fixed or not perishable, the problem is limited to logistics, i.e. inventory or production management. If all customers would pay the same price for using the same amount of resources, the challenge would perhaps be limited to selling as quickly as possible, e.g. if there are costs for holding inventory.

Yield management is of especially high relevance in cases where the constant costs are relatively high compared to the variable costs. The less variable cost there is, the more the additional revenue earned will contribute to the overall profit. This is because it focuses on maximizing expected marginal revenue for a given operation and planning horizon. It optimizes resource utilization by ensuring inventory availability to customers with the highest expected net revenue contribution and extracting the greatest level of ‘willingness to pay’ from the entire customer base. Yield management practitioners typically claim 3% to 7% incremental revenue gains. In many industries this can equate to over 100% increase in profits.

Yield management has significantly altered the travel and hospitality industry since its inception in the mid-1980s. It requires analysts with detailed market knowledge and advanced computing systems who implement sophisticated mathematical techniques to analyze market behavior and capture revenue opportunities. It has evolved from the system airlines invented as a response to deregulation and quickly spread to hotels, car rental firms, cruise lines, media, telecommunications and energy to name a few. Its effectiveness in generating incremental revenues from an existing operation and customer base has made it particularly attractive to business leaders that prefer to generate return from revenue growth and enhanced capability rather than downsizing and cost cutting.

===Airlines===
In the passenger airline case, capacity is regarded as fixed because changing what aircraft flies a certain service based on the demand is the exception rather than the rule. When the aircraft departs, the unsold seats cannot generate any revenue and thus can be said to have perished, or have spoiled. Airlines use specialized software to monitor how seats are reserved and react accordingly. There are various inventory controls such as a nested inventory system. For example, airlines can offer discounts on low-demand flights, where the flight will likely not sell out. When there is excess demand, the seats can be sold at a higher price.

Another way of capturing varying willingness to pay is market segmentation. A firm may repackage its basic inventory into different products to this end. In the passenger airline case this means implementing purchase restrictions, length of stay requirements and requiring fees for changing or canceling tickets.

The airline needs to keep a specific number of seats in reserve to cater to the probable demand for high-fare seats. This process can be managed by inventory controls or by managing the fare rules such as the AP (Advanced Purchase) restrictions. (30 day advance purchase, 21 day advance purchase, 14 day advance purchase, 7 day advance purchase, day of departure/walk up fares) The price of each seat varies directly with the number of seats reserved, that is, the fewer seats that are reserved for a particular category, the lower the price of each seat. This will continue until the price of seat in the premium class equals that of those in the concession class. Depending on this, a floor price (lower price) for the next seat to be sold is set.

===Hotels and multi-family residences===

Hotels use this system in largely the same way, to calculate the rates. Yield management is one of the most common pricing strategies used in the hotel industry to increase reservations and boost revenue.

In the multi-family residential industry, revenue management software started to be used around 2001, with Archstone-Smith helping to develop the LRO (Lease Rent Options) Revenue Management System from Rainmaker. Another early system was the YieldStar Asset Optimization System from RealPage. By 2024 the systems had been developed into cloud-based platforms known as an Revenue Management Systems (RMS). These systems are widely used by hotels to help optimize their revenue, as they automate the booking system, dynamically pricing rooms based on real-time activity, thus increasing revenue and occupancy as well as providing improved forecasting. Some RMS software is bundled as a standalone system, but sometimes it comes as part of a larger Property Management System (PMS).

===Rental===
In the rental car industry, yield management deals with the sale of optional insurance, damage waivers and vehicle upgrades. It accounts for a major portion of the rental company&#x27;s profitability, and is monitored on a daily basis. In the equipment rental industry, yield management is a method to manage rental rates against capacity (available fleet) and demand.

===Intercity buses===
Yield management has moved into the bus industry with companies such as Megabus (United Kingdom), Megabus (North America), BoltBus, and easyBus, which run low-cost networks in the United Kingdom and parts of the United States, and more recently, nakedbus.com and Intercape, which have networks in New Zealand and South Africa. Now operating and developed in Chile by SARCAN, a Chilean company that provides revenue and yield management systems focused on this industry, with the company Turbus as principal customer. Finnish low-cost inter-city bus service OnniBus, as well as Polish PolskiBus, bases its revenue flow on yield management.

===Insurance===
Insurance companies use price (premium) optimization to improve profitability on policy sales. The method is widely used by property &amp; casualty insurers and brokers in the UK, Spain and, to a lesser extent, in the US. Several vendors, such as Earnix, Willis Towers Watson, EMB, ODG, provide specialized pricing optimization software for the industry.

===Telecommunications===
On average, communications service providers use an average of just 35 to 40 percent of available network capacity. Recently, telecommunications software vendors such as Telcordia and Ericsson have promoted yield management as a strategy for communications service providers to generate additional revenue and reduce capital expenditures by maximizing the subscriber use of available network bandwidth. Approaches include basing a strategy on innovative services explicitly designed to use only spare capacity and borrowing proven methods from the airline industry. The approach can be more difficult to implement in the telecommunications industry than the airlines sector because of the difficulty to control and sometimes refuse network access to customers.

Similarities that exist between the airline and telecom industries include a large sunk cost combined with low marginal cost, perishable inventory, reservations, pricing flexibility and the opportunity to upsell. Differences that present challenges for communications service providers include low-value transactions and overall network complexity. Suggested approaches to executing a successful yield management strategy include accurate network information collection, bandwidth capacity allocation that does not impact service quality, the deployment of service management software such as real time policy and real-time charging, and using new marketing channels to target consumers with innovative services.

===Online advertising===
Yield management in online ad sales is in essence the same as in other industries above mentioned; managing the publishers supply/inventory (banner impressions) with the market demand, at the best price (CPM/RPM) while assuring highest possible fill rates.

===Railways===
While railways traditionally sold fully flexible tickets that were valid on all trains on a given day or even trains on several days, deregulation and (partial) privatization introduced yield management in the United Kingdom as well as for high speed services in Germany or France. Tickets for the same route can be as cheap as €19 but also go into the triple digits depending on departure time, demand, and the time the ticket is booked.

===Skiing===
Yield Management has shown increasing popularity in the ski industry, especially in the North American markets. This ranges from non-physical rate fences, including age and validity differentiation to fully dynamic prices. Determinants of such variable prices include date-specific expected demand factors (institutional and public holidays, weekends, weather, size and accessibility of the resort, etc.)

===Pet boarding===
With predictable demand far outnumbering fixed supply in the professional pet boarding industry, yield management has become an ever-popular practice for this segment of businesses. Much like the hotel industry, those systems help gauge which restrictions to implement, such as length of stay, non-refundable rate, or close to arrival, and also ensuring they are selling rooms and services at the right price to the right person at the right time.

==Econometrics==
Yield management and econometrics center on detailed forecasting and mathematical optimization of marginal revenue opportunities. The opportunities arise from segmentation of consumer willingness to pay. If the market for a particular good follows the simple straight line Price/Demand relationship illustrated below, a single fixed price of $50 there is enough demand to sell 50 units of inventory. This results in $2500 in revenues. However the same Price/Demand relationship yields $4000 if consumers are presented with multiple prices.

In practice, the segmentation approach relies on adequate fences between consumers so that everyone doesn&#x27;t buy at the lowest price offered. The airlines use time of purchase to create this segmentation, with later booking customers paying the higher fares. The fashion industry uses time in the opposite direction, discounting later in the selling season once the item is out of fashion or inappropriate for the time of year. Other approaches to fences involve attributes that create substantial value to the consumer at little or no cost to the seller. A backstage pass at a concert is a good example of this. Initially yield management avoided the complexity caused by the interaction of absolute price and price position by using surrogates for price such as booking class. By the mid-1990s, most implementation incorporated some measures of price elasticity. The airlines were exceptional in this case, preferring to focus on more detailed segmentation by implementing O&amp;D (Origin &amp; Destination) systems.

At the heart of yield management decision-making process is the trade-off of marginal yields from segments that are competing for the same inventory. In capacity-constrained cases, there is a bird-in-the-hand decision that forces the seller to reject lower revenue generating customers in the hopes that the inventory can be sold in a higher valued segment. The tradeoff is sometimes mistakenly identified as occurring at the intersection of the marginal revenue curves for the competing segments. While this is accurate when it supports marketing decisions where access to both segments is equivalent, it is wrong for inventory control decisions. In these cases the intersection of the marginal revenue curve of the higher valued segment with the actual value of the lower segment is the point of interest.

In the case illustrated here, a car rental company must set up protection levels for its higher valued segments. By estimating where the marginal revenue curve of the luxury segment crosses the actual rental value of the midsize car segment the company can decide how many luxury cars to make available to midsize car renters. Where the vertical line from this intersection point crosses the demand (horizontal) axis determines how many luxury cars should be protected for genuine luxury car renters. The need to calculate protection levels has led to a number of heuristic solutions, most notable EMSRa and EMSRb, which stands for Expected Marginal Seat Revenue version a and b respectively. The balancing point of interest is found using Littlewood&#x27;s rule which states that demand for formula_1 should be accepted as long as

formula_22 formula_31formula_41formula_5

where
formula_1 is the value of the lower valued segment
formula_7 is the value of the higher valued segment
formula_8 is the demand for the higher valued segment and
formula_9 is the capacity left

This equation is re-arranged to compute protection levels as follows:

formula_101formula_11−1formula_122formula_131formula_14

In words, the seller wants to protect formula_101 units of inventory for the higher valued segment where formula_101 is equal to the inverse probability of demand of the revenue ratio of the lower valued segment to the higher valued segment. This equation defines the EMSRa algorithm which handles the two segment case. EMSRb is smarter and handles multiple segments by comparing the revenue of the lower segment to a demand weighted average of the revenues of the higher segments. Neither of these heuristics produces the exact right answer and increasingly implementations make use of Monte Carlo simulation to find optimal protection levels.

Since the mid-1990s, increasingly sophisticated mathematical models have been developed such as the dynamic programming formulation pioneered by Talluri and Van Ryzin which has led to more accurate estimates of bid prices. Bid prices represent the minimum price a seller should accept for a single piece of inventory and are popular control mechanisms for Hotels and Car Rental firms. Models derived from developments in financial engineering are intriguing but have been unstable and difficult to place the parameters in practice. Yield management tends to focus on environments that are less rational than the financial markets.

==Yield management system==
Firms that engage in yield management usually use computer yield management systems to do so. The Internet has greatly facilitated this process.

Enterprises that use yield management periodically review transactions for goods or services already supplied and for goods or services to be supplied in the future. They may also review information (including statistics) about events (known future events such as holidays, or unexpected past events such as terrorist attacks), competitive information (including prices), seasonal patterns, and other pertinent factors that affect sales. The models attempt to forecast total demand for all products/services they provide, by market segment and price point. Since total demand normally exceeds what the particular firm can produce in that period, the models attempt to optimize the firm&#x27;s outputs to maximize revenue.

The optimization attempts to answer the question: &quot;Given our operating constraints, what is the best mix of products and/or services for us to produce and sell in the period, and at what prices, to generate the highest expected revenue?&quot;

Optimization can help the firm adjust prices and to allocate capacity among market segments to maximize expected revenues. This can be done at different levels of detail:
* by goods (such as a seat on a flight or a seat at an opera production)
* by group of goods (such as the entire opera house or all the seats on a flight)
* by market (such as sales from Seattle and Minneapolis for a flight going Seattle-Minneapolis-Boston)
* overall (on all the routes an airline flies, or all the seats during an opera production season)

Yield management is particularly suitable when selling perishable products, i.e. goods that become unsellable at a point in time (for example air tickets just after a flight takes off). Industries that use yield management include airlines, hotels, stadiums and other venues with a fixed number of seats, and advertising. With an advance forecast of demand and pricing flexibility, buyers will self-sort based on their price sensitivity (using more power in off-peak hours or going to the theater mid-week), their demand sensitivity (must have the higher cost early morning flight or must go to the Saturday night opera) or their time of purchase (usually paying a premium for booking late).

In this way, yield management&#x27;s overall aim is to provide an optimal mix of goods at a variety of price points at different points in time or for different baskets of features. The system will try to maintain a distribution of purchases over time that is balanced as well as high.

Good yield management maximizes (or at least significantly increases) revenue production for the same number of units, by taking advantage of the forecast of high demand/low demand periods, effectively shifting demand from high demand periods to low demand periods and by charging a premium for late bookings. While yield management systems tend to generate higher revenues, the revenue streams tends to arrive later in the booking horizon as more capacity is held for late sale at premium prices.

Firms faced with lack of pricing power sometimes turn to yield management as a last resort. After a year or two using yield management, many of them are surprised to discover they have actually lowered prices for the majority of their opera seats or hotel rooms or other products. That is, they offer far higher discounts more frequently for off-peak times, while raising prices only marginally for peak times, resulting in higher revenue overall.

By doing this, they have actually increased quantity demanded by selectively introducing many more price points, as they learn about and react to the diversity of interests and purchase drivers of their customers.

==Ethical issues and questions of efficacy==

Some consumers are concerned that yield management could penalize them for conditions which cannot be helped and are unethical to penalize. For example, the formulas, algorithms, and neural networks that determine airline ticket prices could feasibly consider frequent flyer information, which includes a wealth of socio-economic information such as age and home address. The airline then could charge higher prices to consumers who are between certain ages or who live in neighborhoods with higher average wealth, even if those neighborhoods also include poor households. Very few (if any) airlines using yield management are able to employ this level of price discrimination because prices are not set based on characteristics of the purchaser, which are in any case often not known at the time of purchase.

Some consumers may object that it is impossible for them to boycott yield management when buying some goods, such as airline tickets.

Yield management also includes many noncontroversial and more prevalent practices, such as varying prices over time to reflect demand. This level of yield management makes up the majority of yield management in the airline industry. For example, airlines may price a ticket on the Sunday after Thanksgiving at a higher fare than the Sunday a week later. Alternatively, they may make tickets more expensive when bought at the last minute than when bought six months in advance. The goal of this level of yield management is essentially trying to force demand to equal or exceed supply.

When yield management was introduced in the early 1990s, primarily in the airline industry, many suggested that despite the obvious immediate increase in revenues, it might harm customer satisfaction and loyalty, interfere with relationship marketing, and drive customers from firms that used yield management to firms that do not. Frequent flier programs were developed as a response to regain customer loyalty and reward frequent and high yield passengers. Today, yield management is nearly universal in many industries, including airlines.

Despite optimizing revenue in theory, introduction of yield management does not always achieve that in practice because of corporate image problems. In 2002, Deutsche Bahn, the German national railway company, experimented with yield management for frequent loyalty card passengers. The fixed pricing model that had existed for decades was replaced with a more demand-responsive pricing model, but that reform proved highly unpopular with passengers and led to widespread protests and a decline in passenger numbers.

==Experimental studies of yield management decisions==
Recently, people working in the area of behavioral operations research have begun to study the yield management decisions of actual human decision makers. One question that this research addresses is how much might revenues increase if managers relied on yield management systems rather than their own judgment when making pricing decisions. Using methods from experimental economics, this work has revealed that yield management systems are likely to increase revenues significantly. Further, this research reveals that &quot;errors&quot; in yield management decisions tend to be quite systematic. For instance, Bearden, Murphy, and Rappaport showed that with respect to expected revenue maximizing policies, people tend to price too high when they have high levels of inventory and too low when their inventory levels are low.

<doc id="1053995" wikidata="Q1756697" url="?curid=1053995" title="Stevens's power law">
<text>Stevens&#x27; power law is an empirical relationship in psychophysics between an increased intensity or strength in a physical stimulus and the perceived magnitude increase in the sensation created by the stimulus. It is often considered to supersede the Weber–Fechner law, which is based on a logarithmic relationship between stimulus and sensation, because the power law describes a wider range of sensory comparisons, down to zero intensity.

The theory is named after psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens (1906–1973). Although the idea of a power law had been suggested by 19th-century researchers, Stevens is credited with reviving the law and publishing a body of psychophysical data to support it in 1957.

The general form of the law is
:formula_1
where &quot;I&quot; is the intensity or strength of the stimulus in physical units (energy, weight, pressure, mixture proportions, etc.), ψ(&quot;I&quot;) is the magnitude of the sensation evoked by the stimulus, &quot;a&quot; is an exponent that depends on the type of stimulation or sensory modality, and &quot;k&quot; is a proportionality constant that depends on the units used.

A distinction has been made between local psychophysics, where stimuli can only be discriminated with a probability around 50%, and global psychophysics, where the stimuli can be discriminated correctly with near certainty (Luce &amp; Krumhansl, 1988). The Weber–Fechner law and methods described by L. L. Thurstone are generally applied in local psychophysics, whereas Stevens&#x27; methods are usually applied in global psychophysics.

The adjacent table lists the exponents reported by Stevens.

==Methods==
The principal methods used by Stevens to measure the perceived intensity of a stimulus were &quot;magnitude estimation&quot; and &quot;magnitude production&quot;. In magnitude estimation with a standard, the experimenter presents a stimulus called a &quot;standard&quot; and assigns it a number called the &quot;modulus&quot;. For subsequent stimuli, subjects report numerically their perceived intensity relative to the standard so as to preserve the ratio between the sensations and the numerical estimates (e.g., a sound perceived twice as loud as the standard should be given a number twice the modulus). In magnitude estimation without a standard (usually just &quot;magnitude estimation&quot;), subjects are free to choose their own standard, assigning any number to the first stimulus and all subsequent ones with the only requirement being that the ratio between sensations and numbers is preserved. In magnitude production a number and a reference stimulus is given and subjects produce a stimulus that is perceived as that number times the reference. Also used is &quot;cross-modality matching&quot;, which generally involves subjects altering the magnitude of one physical quantity, such as the brightness of a light, so that its perceived intensity is equal to the perceived intensity of another type of quantity, such as warmth or pressure.

==Criticisms==
Stevens generally collected magnitude estimation data from multiple observers, averaged the data across subjects, and then fitted a power function to the data. Because the fit was generally reasonable, he concluded the power law was correct.

A principal criticism has been that Stevens&#x27; approach provides neither a direct test of the power law itself nor the underlying assumptions of the magnitude estimation/production method: it simply fits curves to data points. In addition, the power law can be deduced mathematically from the Weber-Fechner logarithmic function (Mackay, 1963), and the relation makes predictions consistent with data (Staddon, 1978). As with all psychometric studies, Stevens&#x27; approach ignores individual differences in the stimulus-sensation relationship, and there are generally large individual differences in this relationship that averaging the data will obscure .

Stevens&#x27; main assertion was that using magnitude estimations/productions respondents were able to make judgements on a ratio scale (i.e., if &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are values on a given ratio scale, then there exists a constant &quot;k&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; = &quot;ky&quot;). In the context of axiomatic psychophysics, formulated a testable property capturing the implicit underlying assumption this assertion entailed. Specifically, for two proportions &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;, and three stimuli, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, if &quot;y&quot; is judged &quot;p&quot; times &quot;x&quot;, &quot;z&quot; is judged &quot;q&quot; times &quot;y&quot;, then &quot;t&quot; = &quot;pq&quot; times &quot;x&quot; should be equal to &quot;z&quot;. This amounts to assuming that respondents interpret numbers in a veridical way. This property was unambiguously rejected (, ). Without assuming veridical interpretation of numbers, formulated another property that, if sustained, meant that respondents could make ratio scaled judgments, namely, if &quot;y&quot; is judged &quot;p&quot; times &quot;x&quot;, &quot;z&quot; is judged &quot;q&quot; times &quot;y&quot;, and if &quot;y&quot;″ is judged &quot;q&quot; times &quot;x&quot;, &quot;z&quot;″ is judged &quot;p&quot; times &quot;y&quot;″, then &quot;z&quot; should equal &quot;z&quot;″. This property has been sustained in a variety of situations (, ).

Critics of the power law also point out that the validity of the law is contingent on the measurement of perceived stimulus intensity that is employed in the relevant experiments. , under the condition that respondents&#x27; numerical distortion function and the psychophysical functions could be separated, formulated a behavioral condition equivalent to the psychophysical function being a power function. This condition was confirmed for just over half the respondents, and the power form was found to be a reasonable approximation for the rest .

It has also been questioned, particularly in terms of signal detection theory, whether any given stimulus is actually associated with a particular and &quot;absolute&quot; perceived intensity; i.e. one that is independent of contextual factors and conditions. Consistent with this, Luce (1990, p. 73) observed that &quot;by introducing contexts such as background noise in loudness judgements, the shape of the magnitude estimation functions certainly deviates sharply from a power function&quot;. Indeed, nearly all sensory judgments can be changed by the context in which a stimulus is perceived.

<doc id="1054008" wikidata="Q7856479" url="?curid=1054008" title="Turtling (gameplay)">
<text>Turtling is a gameplay strategy that emphasizes heavy defense, with little or no offense. A player who turtles minimizes risk to themselves while baiting opponents to take risks in trying to overcome the defenses.

In practice, games are often designed to punish turtling through various game mechanics. 

As a metaphor, turtling refers to the defensive posture of a turtle, which retracts its limbs into its hardened shell for protection against predators. A player who concentrates on defense is said to behave like a turtle, reluctant to leave the safety of its shell for fear of suffering a lethal attack.

== Fighting games ==
In the world of fighting games, especially those of the 2D variety, a turtle style of play is a defensive style that focuses on patience, positioning, timing, and relatively safe attack options to slow down the pace of the game and minimize the number of punishable mistakes made during the course of the match. This style can be very useful in timed matches, as it allows a player to deal a small amount of damage to an opponent, and then win the match by running down the clock. If available, players can turn off the timer to prevent such a strategy. Turtling can also be used to force an opponent into making punishable mistakes while minimizing the damage one takes. This is especially true when using projectile-heavy characters that are able to both maintain the pressure and stay out of harm&#x27;s way. In a few other cases, turtling can be an effective strategy to minimize the offensive effects of temporary buffs.

Game mechanics can be designed specifically to discourage turtling. For example, super attack meters may build up faster when using aggressive attacks, and may even decrease as a result of blocking or not attacking. Games can also offer a greater variety of possible hit locations (e.g., utilizing mix-ups) that make it more difficult for a defender to successfully guess how to block or counter. &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; has a character&#x27;s shield shrink as it is used and takes damage, but it will regenerate when not in use. It is also possible to &quot;poke&quot; shields, or hit vulnerable spots outside a character&#x27;s shield while their shield is active, which is easier against smaller shields but can be circumvented by positioning the shield with the control stick. If the shield shrinks too much, it will shatter and stun the player for a short period of time.
However, turtling is still possible because of various characters who rely heavily on projectiles.

== Real-time strategy games ==
A turtle strategy is commonly used in real-time strategy video games. When turtling, the player protects their territory, to the exclusion of creating forces for attacking the enemy. A turtling strategy may work because it forces the opponent to be more aggressive and constantly force him to attack the turtling player until the map is mined out, and the opponent does not have any resources to replenish their forces. The most common way to turtle is to build large numbers of towers, turrets, and other defensive structures to fire on enemy units. Turtle armies may also incorporate large groups of artillery units to extend effective range and prevent opposing artillery units from attacking with impunity.

The turtling strategy has some major weaknesses. First, many games have units which out-range defensive buildings (catapults, artillery, etc.) and/or short-range units which are fast enough and tough enough to rush the defenses. The turtling strategy may then collapse (especially if overly dependent on choke points) as the more aggressive player destroys one group of defenses, destroys resource-gathering and unit-building facilities in that area, and then attacks another set of defenses, etc. (assuming that the attacker has been building reinforcements in the meantime). Another serious weakness of turtling is that it prevents the turtler from spreading across the map to acquire additional resources, and therefore lets the enemy use these resources to build more and often better offensive units. The seriousness of this disadvantage varies: it is most serious on maps where there are many resource patches and few opponents competing for them.

Under competitive multiplayer conditions, starting resources are often limited, and the turtling strategy involves devoting them all to defense while disregarding other objectives, the most important of which usually being to attack and secure other sources of income. While the turtle builds up his defensive shell, the &quot;attacker&quot; is free to take control of the rest of the map, providing them with an abundance of resources with which to build up a large force (including artillery which can outrange defensive structures, and superweapons, if applicable) and invade from all sides.

== Turn-based strategy games ==
Turtling is also possible in TBS (turn-based strategy) games. It is probably best explained by a classic TBS game such as &quot;Risk&quot;. A player will simply accumulate armies in one place without attacking other players. As the game progresses, the turtle becomes stronger as other players will not risk attacking in fear of getting weak for no benefit. The turtle exploits the selfishness of other players to its advantage until it is powerful enough to start taking them out one by one. Solutions have been proposed to take the turtle out by cooperation as suggested by Ehsan Honorary.

The situation is similar in resource-based games as well. TBS games have much more scope for research than most RTS (real-time strategy) games, so the objective is usually to spend the minimum of resources on combat units and to focus on research and economic development until the player is in a position to build a large force of advanced units.

== Tabletop miniature games and strategy board games ==
Turtling is also a strategy used in many non-computer games as well. In tabletop miniature combat games, victory may be determined by the amount of opposing units destroyed. By waiting for the opponent to make the first move, a tactical advantage can be gained in many systems. For this reason, many game systems have implemented a victory system involving territorial control to combat the effects of turtling. Turtling is also a strategy in many strategy board games, the strengths, and weaknesses of which are similar to those of turtling in real-time or turn-based computer strategy games.

<text>The box mangle is said to have been invented in the 17th century. It consisted of a heavy frame containing a large box filled with rocks, resting on a series of long wooden rollers. Damp laundry could be laid flat under rollers, or wound round the rollers: sometimes enclosed in a sheet in order to keep the laundry clean. When the rollers were filled, one or two people pulled on levers or turned cranks to move the heavy box back and forth over the rollers. The mangle&#x27;s primary purpose was to press household linen and clothing smooth. 

This was a mechanical version of the hand-held mangle boards and rollers/pins used in many parts of northern Europe. Nowadays the word mangle suggests a wringing device for removing water from laundry in some English-speaking countries, but the box mangle was used for pressing and smoothing, and was an alternative to hot ironing for larger items. Flat items, like sheets and tablecloths, usually needed no further ironing. 

The box mangle was a large and expensive affair and required a fair bit of labor to operate it. It was often used by very large households, commercial laundries or by self-employed mangle women who served their local area. In the 19th century new designs made it easier to operate, and before the middle of the century the upright, space-saving type with cloth pressed between two rollers had become familiar. 

In the late 19th century the commercial steam laundry replaced the box mangle with the steam mangle, turned by steam power.

<doc id="1054022" wikidata="Q2393494" url="?curid=1054022" title="South Texas">
<text>South Texas is a geographic and cultural region of the U.S. state of Texas that lies roughly south of—and includes—San Antonio. The southern and western boundary is the Rio Grande, and to the east it is the Gulf of Mexico. The population of this region is more than 5 million according to the 2024 census estimates. The southern portion of this region is often referred to as the Rio Grande Valley. The eastern portion along the Gulf of Mexico is also referred to as the Coastal Bend.

Greater Houston and Beaumont–Port Arthur are occasionally tied to the region, both for physically being on the southern end of the state and for businesses that use &quot;South Texas&quot; in its name. (i.e. South Texas School of Law, South Texas State Fair, etc). However, the two are more commonly associated with East Texas or Southeast Texas.

==Geography==
There is no defined northern boundary, although it is believed to be at the city of San Antonio and from an east to west line extending from the Rio Grande near Maverick County to the Gulf of Mexico, but turning southeast at or near Lavaca County, and continuing towards the Gulf of Mexico to separate it from East Texas and Southeast Texas. The Rio Grande serves as the western and southern boundaries and separates Texas from Mexico. The eastern portion of South Texas is bordered by the Gulf of Mexico. South Texas consists of 41 counties. Its terrain is flat, lying on the coastal plain. South Texas is so vast, that there are even subregions. The very southern tip of South Texas, called the Rio Grande Valley, has fertile soils and is known for its citrus production. The eastern portion of South Texas is often referred to as the Coastal Bend; here, coastal salt marshes, estuaries, and wetlands are scattered all around. The western and central parts are known as the South Texas Plains or the Brush Country. Mesquite trees and crop fields dominate the Brush Country.

===Counties===

*The fastest growing county in South Texas is Guadalupe County, growing by 31.3% from 2010 to 2020.
*The slowest growing county in South Texas is Refugio County, shrinking by 8.7% from 2010 to 2020.

===Cities===

Some people consider Houston to be in South Texas for several reasons: numerous businesses in the Houston region contain &#x27;South Texas&#x27; in their titles. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas includes the Houston division. However, Houston is most accurately classified as being within Southeast Texas, a subregion of East Texas.

===Climate===
The climate of South Texas is varied. The area along the Mexican border is generally semi-arid (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;), while the area from the coast inland to just west of San Antonio has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;). South Texas weather is affected by the Sierra Madre Oriental mountains to the west, the Gulf of Mexico to the east, and the Chihuahuan Desert to the west/northwest. Moisture from the Pacific is cut off by the Mexican Sierra Madre Occidental and Oriental mountain ranges. Along the coast the climate is best exemplified in the summers when humidity is extremely high though at times arid, depending upon whether tropical moisture from the Gulf and sometimes from the Pacific is flowing in or if the region is cut off from any moisture by high pressure systems, causing long droughts, which occur every few years. Temperatures reach freezing only a few times in the winter and snowfall is rare, usually three inches or less. Summers in this zone are hot and humid, with daily averages above . In addition, areas in Texas that are slightly inland from the Gulf of Mexico, such as San Antonio that border the semi-arid climate zone, generally see a peak of precipitation in the spring, and a deep, drought-like nadir in midsummer. The region itself sees a short wet season from March to May and another one from late August to October, and a dry season elsewhere in the year. Night-time temperatures are around in summer. The region of South Texas includes the semi-arid ranch country and the wetter Rio Grande Valley. Considered to be the southernmost tip of the American Great Plains region, the inland region has rainfall similar to that of the Northern Plains. The coastal areas are warm most of the year due to currents of the Gulf of Mexico, but can get cold in winter if a strong front comes in, occasionally causing snow at sea level. Rain in the coastal region is more abundant than in the inland region, and subtropical forests line the Rio Grande. Inland, where it is drier, ranches dominate the landscape, characterized by thick, spiny brush and grasslands. The winters in the inland region are cooler and drier, as Arctic air can make it into the region, but snow is rare due to the lack of humidity. Summers are for the most part hot and dry, but at times can be humid if winds come off the warmer Gulf of Mexico. Tornadoes can occur in this region, but less frequently than in other parts of the state.



Hurricanes are the most dangerous weather systems to affect South Texas. Hurricane season is between June and November. However, the Texas coast gets affected usually between August and September, when systems sporadically organize in the southern Gulf around the Bay of Campeche or western Caribbean and the latter months forming off the coast of Africa.

Droughts- Although South Texas summers generally see rainfall in summer months, some years the lack of rain is persistent and leads to water shortages; lake levels drop significantly and lead to municipal water restrictions. In the summer of 2011, numerous records were set. On August 28, 2011, most of South Texas had temperatures reaching 110 °F, breaking many cities&#x27; record highs. Furthermore, 95% of the state faced an extreme or exceptional drought, according to the office of the Texas state climatologist. These drought conditions led to a string of dangerous wildfires across the state, and the enforcement of burn bans in 250 of the 254 counties in Texas.

Tornadoes do occur in this part of the state, but not as frequently as other parts. They approach, usually from the northwest to southeast, as a line of severe thunderstorms, mostly in the summer months and by cold fronts in fall.

Snow rarely falls south of San Antonio or on the coast except in rare circumstances. Of note is the 2004 Christmas Eve snowstorm, when 6 inches (150 mm) of snow fell as far south as McAllen.

==Demographics and culture==

===Multicultural influences===
South Texas is well known for strong Hispanic, primarily Mexican American and &quot;Tejano&quot; (the Spanish term for &quot;Texan&quot;) influences, due to its proximity to Mexico. Tejanos and Mexicans living in South Texas are descended from the Spanish and Sephardic Jewish settlers of Mexico, from Mexican indigenous groups allied with the Spanish, such as Tlaxcaltec and Otomi peoples, and from local indigenous groups of South Texas who were missionized by the Spanish, particularly Coahuiltecans. These migrations occurred and have been ongoing since the early 1700s in South Texas. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in the 1840s failed to secure land belonging to the Mexican settlers. The disputed area was between the Nueces River south of San Antonio and Corpus Christi, the King Ranch, and the Rio Grande. Recognized by neither Mexico nor the United States, the Republic of the Rio Grande was established in this region in 1840, lasting less than a year. Laredo served as its capital.

The Rio Grande Valley area played a significant role in the Mexican War of Independence, the Texas Revolution, the Mexican–American War, and the American Civil War, with many historical battle sites around the area. General Robert E. Lee resided at Fort Ringold (Rio Grande City) during this time as a colonel. President Zachary Taylor was General of the Army at Fort Brown (Brownsville) during the Mexican–American War.

The Texas Rangers gained popularity for their actions in South Texas during the Mexican bandit raids in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. On May 25, 1876, a band of 40 Texas Rangers rode out of Laredo and headed north to the Nueces Strip. Their mission was to find, kill or capture John King Fisher, leader of a band of cattle rustlers and cut-throats who had been terrorizing the area. The Rangers were members of a select group known as the Special Force. Led by Leander McNelly, the Special Force was given the task to bring law and order to an area of South Texas that lay between Corpus Christi and the Mexican border. San Antonio has the most significant African American population in all of South Texas.

==Economy==

===Rice===

An important event in the development of South Texas and the Texas Gulf Coast rice industry was the introduction of seed imported from Japan in 1904. The Houston Chamber of Commerce and the Southern Pacific Railroad invited Japanese farmers to Texas to help area farms in the production of rice. The seed the Japanese farmers brought with them was a gift from the Japanese emperor. The production of Japanese rice began at Webster in Harris County. The Gulf Coast rice industry is credited to the Saibara family.

<doc id="1054032" wikidata="Q4110417" url="?curid=1054032" title="Ben Yehuda Street bombings">
<text>A series of attacks were perpetrated or ordered by Palestinian Arabs, some of them acting as suicide bombers, on Jewish targets in Jerusalem&#x27;s Ben Yehuda Street from February 1948 onwards. Ben Yehuda Street was a major thoroughfare.

==1948 (49-58 killed)==

The attacks took place during the 1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine, after the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine in November 1947 and before the Israeli Declaration of Independence in May 1948.

On February 22, 1948, three British Army trucks led by an armoured car driven by Arab irregulars and British deserters exploded on Ben Yehuda Street killing from 49 to 58 civilians and injuring from 140 to 200. The bomb may have been intended to kill members of the &quot;Furmans&quot; (Palmach convoy escorts) who lodged in the Atlantic and Amdursky Hotels but had left on patrol shortly beforehand. In addition to the two hotels, the Vilenchick Building and the Kupat-Milveh Bank were destroyed. The bomb had been created by Fawzi al-Qutb. The convoy was led by a Jerusalemite militant, &#x27;Azmi al-Ja&#x27;uni, who spoke fluent English and could pass himself off as a British officer. Two British deserters, Eddie Brown, a police captain who claimed that the Irgun had killed his brother, and Peter Madison, an army corporal, had been persuaded to join the attack, also by the promise of substantial financial rewards.

===Aftermath===
A leaflet stating that the explosion was in response to an Irgun bomb attack three days earlier, in Ramla, on 19 February, was distributed the following evening. It was signed by Abd al-Qadir, who assumed responsibility for the operation. Abd al-Qadir himself, in Cairo the day after, left a statement to Al-Ahram to the same effect and the Army of the Holy War High Command reiterated the declaration in Palestine. Husayn al-Khalidi, secretary of the Arab Higher Committee, deplored the act as &#x27;depravity unfit for the Arab spirit,&#x27; while the Committee itself, in an attempt to distance itself from the incident, tried to throw doubt on the authenticity of Abd al-Qadir&#x27;s public statements.

In the ensuing confusion, Jewish residents immediately blamed the British for the attack. David Ben-Gurion, on visiting the site of the carnage, has been cited as putting some responsibility for this Arab attack on the shoulders of Jewish thugs, stating, &quot;I could not forget that our thugs and murderers had opened the way.&quot; The Irgun spread word ordering militants to shoot on sight any Englishman. By day&#x27;s end, eight British soldiers had been shot dead, while a ninth was murdered while laid up in a Jewish clinic for treatment of a wound. Lehi also reacted several days later by blowing up a train full of British soldiers as it drew out of Rehovot station, killing 27.

The day after, on 23 February, a Jewish offensive, deploying mortars, was launched against the Arab neighbourhood of Musrara, in Jerusalem, killing seven Arabs, including an entire family. The Arabs believed it was in revenge for the Ben-Yehuda Street bombing, though, according to Israeli historian Itamar Radai, at the time the Jews and their official institutions blamed only the British for the incident.

==1975 (15 killed)== 
On Friday, July 4, 1975, a refrigerator that had five kilograms of explosives packed into its sides exploded on Zion Square, a main city square connecting Ben Yehuda Street and Jaffa Road. Fifteen people were killed and 77 injured in the attack. Ahmad Jabara, who was responsible for placing the bomb, was arrested and sentenced to life and thirty years in prison, but was released by Israel in 2003 after serving 27 years as a gesture to Arafat, who then appointed him his adviser on prisoners affairs. He died in Ramallah in 2013.

On November 13, 1975, an explosive charge went off near Cafe Naveh on Jaffa Road, near the pedestrian mall. Six people were killed and 40 injured.

==1976 (1 killed)==

On April 9, 1976, a car bomb was dismantled on Ben Yehuda Street shortly before it was to have exploded.

On May 3, 1976, thirty-three passers-by were injured when a booby-trapped motor scooter exploded at the corner of Ben Yehuda and Ben Hillel Streets. Among those injured were the Greek consul in Jerusalem and his wife. The following day, on the eve of Independence Day, the municipality organized an event at the site of the attack, under the slogan &quot;Nevertheless.&quot; One person is also reported to have died in the attack which was perpetrated by the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP).

==1997 (5 killed)==

On September 4, 1997, three Hamas suicide bombers simultaneously blew themselves up on the pedestrian mall, killing five Israelis. The bombing was carried out by Palestinians from the village of Asira al-Shamaliya.

Three 14-year-old girls were killed in the attack: Sivann Zarka, Yael Botvin and Smadar Elhanan. Elhanan was the daughter of peace activist Nurit Peled-Elhanan and the granddaughter of Israeli general and politician Mattityahu Peled.

The family of Yael Botvin, a U.S. citizen, filed a lawsuit in the United States against the Islamic Republic of Iran.

A default judgment of $251 million in compensatory and punitive damages was awarded to the relatives of Americans killed in the attack. There were few assets of the Iranian government in the United States following the judgment. The plaintiffs threatened to seize valuable Persian artifacts located in Chicago museums and sell them for proceeds, leading to the Chicago&#x27;s Persian heritage crisis, as well as suing the account of the Bank Melli Iran in the Bank of New York, but having the United States Department of Justice speak as amicus curiae in support of Bank Melli, advising that the bank had no responsibility for turning the funds over, resulted in a ruling against the students.

==2001 (11 killed)==

On December 1, 2001, two suicide bombers detonated themselves on Ben Yehuda Street, followed by a car bomb set to go off as paramedics arrived. The suicide bombers killed eleven victims aged 15 to 21, including a number of soldiers out of uniform, and 188 were injured. Hamas claimed responsibility, stating that it was in retaliation for the killing of senior Hamas militant Mahmud Abu Hanoud. A Hamas spokesman in Gaza stated that these bombings did not assuage its lust for vengeance and that it would carry out further bombings. Lawsuits were filed against Arab Bank, NatWest and Crédit Lyonnais alleging that they channelled money to Hamas.

<doc id="1054034" wikidata="Q438200" url="?curid=1054034" title="Sir William Robertson, 1st Baronet">
<text>Field Marshal Sir William Robert Robertson, 1st Baronet, (29 January 1860 – 12 February 1933) was a British Army officer who served as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) – the professional head of the British Army – from 1916 to 1918 during the First World War. 

As CIGS he was committed to a Western Front strategy focusing on Germany. He had increasingly poor relations with David Lloyd George, Secretary of State for War and then Prime Minister. In 1917 Robertson supported the continuation of the Battle of Passchendaele at odds with Lloyd George&#x27;s view that Britain&#x27;s war effort ought to be focused on the other theatres until the arrival of sufficient US troops on the Western Front.
Robertson is the only soldier in the history of the British Army to have risen from an enlisted rank to its highest rank of field marshal.

==Early life==
Robertson was born in Welbourn, Lincolnshire, to Thomas Charles Robertson, a tailor and postmaster, and Ann Dexter Robertson (née Beet). He was educated at the local church school and later earned 6d a week as a pupil-teacher. After leaving school in 1873, he became a garden boy in the village rectory, then in 1875 a footman in the Countess of Cardigan&#x27;s household at Deene Park.

He began his military career in November 1877 by enlisting for twelve years as a trooper in the 16th (The Queen&#x27;s) Lancers. As he was three months short of the official minimum age of eighteen, at the behest of the recruiting sergeant he declared his age as eighteen years and two months, these extra five months becoming his &quot;official&quot; age throughout his time in the Army.

His mother wrote to him: You know you are the Great Hope of the Family...if you do not like Service you can do something else...there are plenty of things Steady Young Men can do when they can write and read as you can...(the Army) is a refuge for all idle people...I shall name it to no one for I am ashamed to think of it...I would rather bury you than see you in a red coat. On his first night in the Army, he was so horrified by the rowdiness of the barrack room that he contemplated deserting, only to find that his civilian clothes had been stolen by another deserter.

As a young soldier, Robertson was noted for his prowess at running and for his voracious reading of military history. He won company first prizes for sword, lance and shooting. Among the lieutenants under whom he served were future Lieutenant-General &quot;Jimmy&quot; Babington and &quot;Freddy&quot; Blair, who would later be Robertson&#x27;s Military Secretary at Eastern Command in 1918. He was promoted to lance-corporal in February 1879 and corporal in April 1879. As a corporal, he was imprisoned for three weeks with his head shaven when a soldier under arrest, whom he was escorting, escaped near Waterloo Station. Later, whilst serving in Ireland, he once kept soldiers under arrest handcuffed for a twelve-hour train journey rather than risk a repetition of the event.

He was promoted to lance-sergeant in May 1881 and sergeant in January 1882. He obtained a first class certificate of education in 1883, while serving in Ireland. Robertson was promoted to troop sergeant major in March 1885 to fill a vacancy, as his predecessor had been demoted for making a botch of the regimental accounts and later committed suicide.

==Junior officer==
Encouraged by his officers and the clergyman of his old parish, he passed an examination for an officer&#x27;s commission and was posted as a second lieutenant in the 3rd Dragoon Guards on 27 June 1888. 
Robertson later recorded that it would have been impossible to live as a cavalry subaltern in Britain, where £300 a year was needed in addition to the £120 official salary (approximately £30,000 and £12,000 at 2010 prices) to keep up the required lifestyle; he was reluctant to leave the cavalry, but his regiment was deployed to India, where pay was higher and expenses lower than in the UK. Robertson&#x27;s father made his uniforms and he economised on Mess Bills by drinking water and not smoking with meals, as pipes, which beside a few cheroots were all he could afford, were not allowed in the Mess. He supplemented his income by studying with native tutors, qualifying as an interpreter—for which officers received cash grants—in Urdu, Hindi, Persian, Pashto and Punjabi.
Promoted to lieutenant on 1 March 1891, he saw his first active service in 1891, distinguishing himself as Railway Transport Officer for the expedition to Kohat. He was appointed an attaché in the Intelligence Branch of the Quartermaster-General&#x27;s Department at Simla on 5 June 1892. There he became a protégé of Sir Henry Brackenbury, the new Military Member of the Viceroy&#x27;s Council (equivalent to War Minister for India), who was keen to beef up the intelligence branch of the Indian army, including mapping the Northwest Frontier. Robertson spent a year writing a detailed &quot;Gazetteer and Military Report on Afghanistan&quot;. After five years in India he was granted his first long leave in 1893, only to find that his mother had died before he reached home.

In June 1894 he undertook a three-month journey via Gilgit and mountainous north Kashmir, crossing the Darkot Pass at over to reach the Pamirs Plateau at the foot of the Himalayas, returning to India in August by a westerly route via Chilas and Khagan. On the journey he learned Gurkhali, later qualifying in this, his sixth Indian language.

He was promoted to captain on 3 April 1895. He took part in the Chitral Expedition as Brigade Intelligence Officer. He was described by Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Low, the Expedition Commander, as a &quot;very active and intelligent officer of exceptional promise&quot;. After the relief of Chitral and installation of Shuja-ul-Mulk as Mehtar, Robertson was engaged in pacification and reconnaissance duties, but was wounded when attacked by his two guides on a narrow mountain path during a reconnaissance. One guide was armed with a shotgun and fired at Robertson but missed. The other guide attacked him with Robertson&#x27;s own sword (which he had been carrying, as Robertson had dysentery) but Robertson punched him to the ground then drove off both attackers with his revolver; one was wounded and later captured and executed. The incident was reported and illustrated in the &quot;Daily Graphic&quot; and Robertson was awarded the DSO, which was, he later claimed, &quot;then a rather rare decoration&quot;.

==Staff College==
Robertson then applied to attend Staff College, Camberley. Unlike most applicants, he could not afford to take extended leave from his job to attend a crammer, and had he failed he would have been too old to apply again, so he rose between 4 and 5 am each day to study mathematics, German, and French with the assistance of his wife. He later qualified as an interpreter in French. He just missed a place, but was given a nominated place on the recommendation of Sir George White (Commander-in-Chief, India). In 1897, accompanied by his wife and baby son, he became the first former ranker to go there.

Under George Henderson he absorbed the principles, derived from Jomini, Clausewitz, and Edward Hamley&#x27;s &quot;Operations of War&quot; (1866), of concentration of physical and moral force and the destruction of the main enemy army. He passed out second from Staff College in December 1898 and was then seconded for service in the Intelligence Department at the War Office on 1 April 1899. As a staff captain he was the junior of two officers in the Colonial (later renamed Imperial) section.

==Boer War and War Office==
With the start of the Second Boer War, Robertson was appointed as Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General to Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts, the British Commander-in-Chief South Africa, on 15 January 1900. He was present at the Battle of Paardeberg (17–26 February 1900), the Battle of Poplar Grove (7 March 1900) and other battles in March and May. Robertson was promoted to major on 10 March 1900 and was mentioned in despatches on 2 April 1901.

He returned to the War Office in October 1900 and on 29 November 1900 was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel for his services in South Africa. On 1 October 1901 he was appointed Assistant Quartermaster-General, responsible for the Foreign Military Intelligence section, on the recommendation of the Intelligence expert General Sir Henry Brackenbury, and worked closely with William Nicholson (then Director of Military Operations). Although Robertson was later to be a staunch advocate of Britain&#x27;s concentration of effort on the Western Front, in March 1902 (before the &quot;Entente Cordiale&quot;) he wrote a paper recommending that, in the event of Belgian neutrality being violated, Britain should concentrate on naval warfare and deploy no more troops to Belgium than was needed to &quot;afford ocular proof of our share in the war&quot;. His suggestion did not meet with approval at the highest political level.

Robertson was promoted to brevet colonel on 29 November 1903. Having been one of the oldest lieutenants in the army, he was now one of the youngest colonels, heading a staff of nine officers. In the later words of a contemporary, Robertson &quot;became rated as a superman, and only key appointments were considered good enough for him&quot;.

Robertson was made Assistant Director of Military Operations under James Grierson and appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) on 30 June 1905. In spring 1905, during the First Moroccan Crisis, Grierson and Robertson conducted a war game based on a German march through Belgium. They were persuaded that early and strong British intervention was necessary to slow the German advance and avoid French defeat. In 1906 they toured the Charleroi-to-Namur area. In 1906 Robertson also toured the Balkans, where he was impressed by the size of the mountains, a factor which was later to influence his scepticism about the Salonika front during the First World War.

When that job expired in January 1907, Robertson, without a post, was placed on half-pay: his salary dropped from £800 to £300, causing him severe financial difficulty. He earned money by translating German and Austro-Hungarian military manuals into English, again assisted by his wife. He became Assistant Quartermaster-General at Headquarters Aldershot Command on 21 May 1907 and then was promoted to temporary brigadier general and served as a brigadier general, general staff (BGGS) at Headquarters Aldershot Command on 29 November 1907, taking over from Brigadier General Archibald Murray, who he would later succeed as CIGS. He had hoped for command of a brigade. In 1909 he reconnoitred the likely route of a German invasion – Belgium, the Meuse and Luxembourg – with Smith-Dorrien and Rawlinson.

==Commandant, Staff College==

During Henry Wilson&#x27;s tenure as Commandant at Staff College, Camberley (1906–1910), Robertson lectured on Belgium, the Canadian frontier and the Balkans.

Robertson&#x27;s patron Nicholson, now Chief of the Imperial General Staff, appointed him Commandant at Staff College, effective 1 August 1910. However, Nicholson had initially (according to Wilson) opposed Robertson &quot;because of want of breeding&quot;, while Wilson also opposed Robertson&#x27;s appointment, perhaps feeling that Robertson&#x27;s lack of private means did not suit him for a position which required entertaining. Robertson wrote to his friend Godley of a &quot;pestilential circle&quot; in top appointments which left &quot;no chance for the ordinary man&quot;. On 28 July 1910, shortly before taking up his new position, Robertson visited Camberley with Kitchener, who criticised Wilson. Relations between Wilson and Robertson deteriorated thereafter, beginning a rivalry which was to feature throughout the Great War.

Robertson was a practical lecturer at Camberley whose teaching included withdrawals as well as advances. Edmonds, who had been Robertson&#x27;s classmate in the 1890s, said he was a better lecturer than even Henderson. He taught officers that they &quot;were at the Staff College to learn Staff Duties and to qualify for Staff Captain, not to talk irresponsible trash&quot; about &quot;subjects of policy or strategy&quot;. These and a number of similar recollections, written up after the Great War, may exaggerate the differences in style between Robertson and Wilson.

He was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on 16 July 1910 and promoted to major general on 26 December 1910. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on 26 September 1913; on being knighted he mistakenly rose and shook the King&#x27;s hand instead of kissing it as required by protocol. The King was privately amused and the two soon formed a good relationship. He was appointed director of military training at the War Office on 9 October 1913, taking over from Brigadier General David Henderson.

==Curragh incident==
With the Cabinet apparently contemplating some kind of military action against the Ulster Volunteers, on the evening of 18 March, Robertson was told that it was his responsibility to draw up deployment plans. After Hubert Gough and other officers had threatened to resign in the Curragh incident, Robertson also supported Wilson in trying in vain to persuade French (CIGS) to warn the government that the Army would not move against Ulster. The affair led to hatred between senior officers and Liberal politicians. Robertson contemplated resigning but emerged without any blot on his reputation.

==First World War: 1914–15==

===Quartermaster General, BEF===

Robertson was expected to remain Director of Military Training on the outbreak of the First World War, or to become chief staff officer to the Home Defence Forces. Instead he replaced Murray as Quartermaster General of the British Expeditionary Force (under Field Marshal French) from 5 August 1914.

Robertson was concerned that the BEF was concentrating too far forward, and discussed a potential retreat as early as 22 August (the day before the Battle of Mons). He arranged supply dumps and contingency plans to draw supply from the Atlantic rather than the Belgian coast, all of which proved invaluable during the retreat from Mons. He became known as &quot;Old Any-Complaints?&quot; as this was his usual question when checking on troops at mealtimes. In Dan Todman&#x27;s view, the excellent performance of BEF logistics in August 1914 contrasted favourably with the &quot;almost farcical&quot; performance of the BEF General Staff.

Robertson, who on 13 September was promoted to temporary lieutenant general, &quot;felt deeply&quot; the loss of his close friend Colonel Freddy Kerr, who was killed by a shell while serving as chief of staff to 2nd Division.

Robertson was then promoted (over the head of Wilson who was already Sub Chief of Staff) to Chief of Staff (CGS) of the BEF from 25 January 1915. Robertson had told Wilson that he did not want the promotion as he &quot;could not manage Johnnie, who was sure to come to grief and carry him along with him&quot;. Robertson later wrote that he had hesitated to accept the job, despite the higher pay and position, as he knew he was not French&#x27;s first choice, but had put his duty first. He refused to have Wilson remain as Sub Chief. French was soon impressed by Robertson&#x27;s &quot;sense and soundness&quot; as CGS. Wilson continued to advise French closely whereas Robertson took his meals in a separate mess. Robertson preferred this, and in common with many other senior BEF officers his relations with French deteriorated badly in 1915.

===Chief of Staff, BEF===
Robertson improved the functioning of the staff at GHQ by separating Staff Duties and Intelligence out from Operations into separate sections, each headed by a Brigadier-General reporting to himself. Robertson was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 18 February 1915.

Robertson consistently urged strong commitment to the Western Front. He thought the naval attempt to force the Dardanelles &quot;a ridiculous farce&quot;. Robertson told Hankey on 1 June that Sir John French was &quot;always wanting to do reckless and impossible things&quot; and made similar remarks to Kitchener in July. He advised on 25 June 1915 against retreat to the Channel Ports, an option contemplated by the Cabinet after the defensive losses at Second Ypres, arguing that it would leave the British &quot;helpless spectators&quot; in France&#x27;s defeat. In &quot;Notes on the Machinery of the Government for the Conduct of the War&quot; on 30 June 1915 he argued that the government should state its war aims, in this case the liberation of Belgium and the destruction of German militarism, and then let the professionals achieve them.

The King had a &quot;long talk&quot; with Robertson on 1 July and was left convinced that French should be removed as Commander-in-Chief of the BEF. Attending a council of war in London in early July 1915, Robertson was asked at the end if he had any comments—he produced a map and delivered a 45-minute lecture. His presentation made a strong impression compared to the indecisiveness of the politicians.

Robertson wrote to Kiggell (20 June 1915) that &quot;these Germans are dug in up to the neck, or concreted&quot; in &quot;one vast fortress&quot;. Tactically, he urged &quot;slow attrition, by a slow and gradual advance on our part&quot;. He also advocated surprise, and realistic objectives to prevent attacking infantry outrunning their artillery cover and ragged lines becoming vulnerable to German counterattack. Maurice, who drafted many of Robertson&#x27;s memos, had advised him that such attacks were best carried out in places where the Germans were, for political or strategic reasons, reluctant to retreat so were bound to take heavy losses. Robertson initially opposed the mooted Loos offensive, recommending a more limited attack by Second Army to seize Messines-Wyndeschete ridge, and telling Sidney Clive it would be &quot;throwing away thousands of lives in knocking our heads against a brick wall&quot;. Robertson also advised that Russia, then being driven out of Poland, might make peace without a wholehearted British commitment.

Robertson complained to Wilson that French &quot;chopped &amp; changed every day &amp; was quite hopeless&quot;; Wilson noted that relations between French and Robertson were breaking down, and suspected (correctly) that Robertson was blackening French&#x27;s reputation by sending home documents which French had refused to read or sign. He wrote a memo to French (3 or 5 August) arguing that the volunteer New Armies should be committed to the Western Front, an idea to which Kitchener was only reluctantly coming round. French refused to read it, explaining that he was &quot;fully acquainted with the situation&quot;, so Robertson sent it to the King&#x27;s adviser Wigram anyway.

Robertson was made a Grand Officer of the French Legion of Honour on 10 September 1915 and acted as Commander-in-Chief BEF when French was sick in September.

===Promotion to Chief of the Imperial General Staff===
Robertson later wrote in his memoirs that he was not close to Kitchener. With Asquith&#x27;s Coalition Government in danger of breaking up over conscription (which Robertson supported), he blamed Kitchener for the excessive influence which civilians like Churchill and Haldane had come to exert over strategy, allowing &quot;ad hoc&quot; campaigns to develop in Sinai, Mesopotamia and Salonika, and not asking the general staff to study the feasibility of any of these campaigns. Robertson had urged the King&#x27;s adviser Stamfordham that a stronger general staff was needed in London, otherwise &quot;disaster&quot; would ensue. By October 1915 Robertson had come to support greater coordination of plans with the French and was in increasingly close touch with Charles Callwell, who had been recalled from retirement to become Director of Military Operations.

When the King toured the front (24 October) Haig told him that Robertson should go home and become CIGS, while Robertson told the King (27 October 1915) that Haig should replace French. He was promoted to substantive lieutenant general on 28 October 1915. Robertson clinched his claim as the future CIGS with a lengthy paper (actually written by Maurice, dated 8 November) arguing that all British efforts must be directed at the defeat of Germany.

French, finally forced to &quot;resign&quot; early in December 1915, recommended Robertson as his successor and Kitchener told Esher (4 December) that the government intended to appoint Robertson commander-in-chief, although to Esher&#x27;s disappointment &quot;dear old R&quot; was not appointed. Robertson was willing to relinquish his claim if the job went to Haig, his senior and a front-line commander since the start of the war. Haig&#x27;s inarticulacy may have made him an unappealing choice as CIGS.

Kitchener and Asquith were agreed that Robertson should become CIGS, but Robertson refused to do this if Kitchener &quot;continued to be his own CIGS&quot;, although given Kitchener&#x27;s great prestige he wanted him not to resign but to be sidelined to an advisory role. Asquith asked the men to negotiate an agreement, which they did over the exchange of several draft documents at the Hotel de Crillon in Paris. Kitchener agreed that Robertson alone should present strategic advice to the Cabinet, with Kitchener responsible for recruiting and supplying the army, and that the secretary of state should sign orders jointly with the CIGS. Robertson succeeded Lieutenant General Sir Archibald Murray as CIGS on 23 December, with a promotion to the temporary rank of general and with Major General Robert Whigham as his deputy CIGS, as well as an Order in Council formalising Kitchener&#x27;s and Robertson&#x27;s relative positions in January 1916.

===Initial decisions===
Robertson assumed his duties on 23 December 1915. He brought with him three able men from GHQ: Whigham (Robertson&#x27;s Deputy), Maurice (Operations) and MacDonogh (Intelligence). Their replacements, especially Kiggell (the new CGS BEF), and Charteris (BEF Intelligence) were much less able than their predecessors, a fact which probably affected BEF performance over the next two years.

Although Robertson&#x27;s advice to abandon the Salonika bridgehead had been overruled at the Allied Chantilly Conference (6–8 December 1915), his first act as CIGS was to insist on the evacuation of the Cape Helles bridgehead, which the Royal Navy had wanted to retain as a base. On his first day as CIGS Robertson also demanded a defensive policy in Mesopotamia, with reinforcements drawn only from India – this was agreed on 29 February 1916, over the objections of Balfour and Lloyd George. Robertson also insisted that Mesopotamian operations be brought under his control. Townshend, besieged in Kut, was not initially thought to be in danger, but eventually surrendered in April 1916 after three failed relief attempts.

Another early act as CIGS (27 December 1915) was to press Kitchener for an extra 18 divisions for the BEF. Conscription of bachelors – for which Robertson lobbied – was enacted in early 1916.

==CIGS: 1916==

===Strategic debates===
Robertson was a strong supporter of BEF commander Douglas Haig and was committed to a Western Front strategy focusing on Germany and was against what he saw as peripheral operations on other fronts.

Having seen politicians like Lloyd George and Churchill run rings around Kitchener, Robertson&#x27;s policy was to present his advice and keep on repeating it, refusing to enter into debate. However, Robertson reduced the government&#x27;s freedom of action by cultivating the press, much of which argued that the professional leadership of Haig and Robertson was preferable to civilian interference which had led to disasters like Gallipoli and Kut. He was particularly close to H. A. Gwynne and Charles Repington, who worked for the Northcliffe Press until it ceased to support the generals late in 1917. Robertson communicated by secret letters and &quot;R&quot; telegrams to generals in the field, including Milne, whom he discouraged from offensive operations at Salonika, and Maude who may have &quot;consciously or unconsciously&quot; ignored his secret orders not to attempt to take Baghdad.

In a 12 February 1916 paper Robertson urged that the Allies offer a separate peace to Turkey, or else offer Turkish territory to Bulgaria to encourage Bulgaria to make peace. In reply, Grey pointed out that Britain needed her continental allies more than they needed her, and Britain could not risk them making a compromise peace which left Germany stronger on the continent.

Robertson told the War Committee (22 February 1916) that the French desire to transfer more troops to Salonika showed a weakening in their resolve for trench warfare. He scorned the idea that it would bring Greece into the war on the Allied side, and at a late March 1916 conference argued with Briand (French Prime Minister) and Joffre, who thumped the table and shouted that Robertson was &quot;un homme terrible&quot;.

The War Committee had only agreed with some reluctance to make preparations for the Western Front Offensive agreed at Chantilly, which Haig and Joffre agreed (14 February) should be on the Somme. For three months, against a backdrop of Russia planning to attack earlier than agreed, Italy reluctant to attack at all and the scaling-down of the planned French commitment because of Battle of Verdun, Robertson continued to urge the politicians to agree to the offensive. He increasingly believed that France was becoming exhausted and that Britain would carry an ever greater burden. After Robertson promised that Haig &quot;would not make a fool of himself&quot;, the War Committee finally agreed (7 April).

Robertson lobbied hard with politicians and the press for the extension of conscription. When the Cabinet finally authorised the Somme Offensive, Robertson had the Army Council make a statement in favour of conscripting married men. In the face of protests from Bonar Law that the government might break up, to be followed by a general election and conscription brought in by martial law, Robertson refused to compromise and encouraged Geoffrey Dawson, editor of &quot;The Times&quot;, to make his stance public.

===Prelude to the Somme===

Robertson was contemptuous of the House Grey Memorandum and of President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s offer to mediate in May 1916. The plan was stopped when the entire Army Council, including Kitchener and Robertson, threatened to resign.

At first Robertson tried to limit information to the War Committee only to a summary of news, most of which had already appeared in the newspapers – this was stopped by Hankey and Lloyd George when it was discovered that Robertson had moved troops from Egypt and Britain to France with little reference to the War Committee. In late May Haig and Robertson also angered ministers by challenging their right to inquire into the shipping of animal fodder to France. Robertson told ministers that &quot;Haig had no idea of any attempt to break through the German lines. It would only be a move to (rescue) the French&quot;, although he was probably not aware of Haig&#x27;s insistence, overruling Rawlinson&#x27;s earlier plan, on bombarding deeper into the German defences in the hope of breaking through and &quot;fighting the enemy in the open&quot;.

Robertson was promoted to permanent general on 3 June 1916. At an Anglo-French conference at 10 Downing Street Robertson finally succeeded in blocking a major offensive from Salonika. Robertson lobbied hard but in vain to prevent Lloyd George, who made no secret of his desire to use his control over military appointments to influence strategy, from succeeding Kitchener as Secretary of State for War. Although Robertson retained the special powers he had been granted in December 1915, and Lord Derby, an ally of the soldiers, was appointed Under-Secretary, Robertson still wrote to Kiggell &quot;That d----d fellow L.G. is coming here I fear. I shall have an awful time&quot;.

===The Somme===
Robertson had been clear that it would take more than one battle to defeat Germany, but like many British generals he overestimated the chances of success on the Somme. Robertson also wrote to Kiggell (Chief of Staff BEF) stressing that &quot;the road to success lies through deliberation&quot;. He recommended &quot;concentration and not dispersion of artillery fire&quot; and &quot;the thing is to advance along a wide front, step by step to very limited and moderate objectives, and to forbid going beyond those objectives until all have been reached by the troops engaged&quot;.

Kiggell conceded that there had been problems with infantry-artillery coordination, but seemed more concerned with the slowness of progress. Possibly (in David Woodward&#x27;s view) worried at Kiggell&#x27;s response, Robertson wrote to Rawlinson, GOC Fourth Army, on 26 July urging him not to let the Germans &quot;beat you in having the better man-power policy&quot; and urging &quot;common-sense, careful methods, and not to be too hide-bound by the books we used to study before the war&quot;.

Henry Wilson recorded rumours that Robertson was angling for Haig&#x27;s job in July, although there is no clear evidence that this was so. Robertson complained that Haig&#x27;s daily telegrams to him contained little more information than the daily press releases. F. E. Smith (1 August) circulated a paper by his friend Winston Churchill criticising the high losses and negligible gains of the Somme. Churchill argued that this would leave Germany freer to win victories elsewhere. Robertson issued a strong rebuttal the same day, arguing that Britain&#x27;s losses were small compared to what France had suffered in previous years, that Germany had had to quadruple the number of her divisions on the Somme sector and that this had taken pressure off Verdun and contributed to the success of Russian and Italian offensives.

After the Churchill memorandum Robertson wrote to Haig accusing the War Committee (a Cabinet committee which discussed strategy in 1916) of being &quot;ignorant&quot; and putting too much emphasis on &quot;gaining ground&quot; rather than putting &quot;pressure&quot; on the Germans; Travers argues that he was &quot;cunning(ly)&quot; using the War Committee as &quot;a stalking horse&quot; and obliquely urging Haig to adopt more cautious tactics. With Allied offensives apparently making progress on all fronts in August, Robertson hoped that Germany might sue for peace at any time and urged the government to pay more attention to drawing up war aims, lest Britain get a raw deal in the face of collusion between France and Russia. Prompted by Asquith, Robertson submitted a memorandum on war aims (31 August). He wanted Germany preserved as a major power as a block to Russian influence, possibly gaining Austria to compensate for the loss of her colonies, Alsace-Lorraine and her North Sea and Baltic ports.

===Clash with Lloyd George===
Robertson correctly guessed that the Bulgarian declaration of war on Romania (1 September) indicated that they had been promised German aid. While Lloyd George, who wanted Greece to be brought into the war on the Allied side, if necessary by a naval bombardment, was visiting the Western Front Robertson persuaded the War Committee that Romania was best helped by renewed attacks on the Somme.

Robertson had told Monro, the new Commander-in-Chief India, to &quot;keep up a good show&quot; (1 August 1916) in Mesopotamia but wanted to retreat from Kut to Amara rather than make any further attempt to take Baghdad; this was overruled by Curzon and Chamberlain.

Lloyd George criticised Haig to Foch on a visit to the Western Front in September, and proposed sending Robertson on a mission to persuade Russia to make the maximum possible effort. With Royal backing, Robertson refused to go, later writing to Haig that it had been an excuse for Lloyd George to &quot;become top dog&quot; and &quot;have his wicked way&quot;. Lloyd George continued to demand that aid be sent to help Romania, eventually demanding that 8 British divisions be sent to Salonika. This was logistically impossible, but to Robertson&#x27;s anger the War Committee instructed him to consult Joffre. Derby dissuaded him from resigning the next day, but instead he wrote a long letter to Lloyd George complaining that Lloyd George was offering strategic advice contrary to his own and seeking the advice of a foreign general, and threatening to resign. Lloyd George had to give his &quot;word of honour&quot; to Asquith that he had complete confidence in Haig and Robertson and thought them irreplaceable. However, he wrote to Robertson wanting to know how their differences had been leaked to the press and asserting his right to express his opinions about strategy. The Army Council went on record forbidding unauthorised press contacts, although that did nothing to stop War Office leaks.

===The Somme ends===
At the inter-Allied conference at Boulogne (20 October) Asquith supported Robertson in opposing major offensives at Salonika. Robertson wrote to Repington &quot;If I were not in my present position I daresay I could find half a dozen different ways of rapidly winning this war&quot;. He advised Hankey that further high casualties would be needed to defeat Germany&#x27;s reserves.

The War Committee met (3 November 1916) without Robertson, so Lloyd George could, in Hankey&#x27;s words &quot;air his views freely unhampered by the presence of that old dragon Robertson&quot;. He complained that the Allies had not achieved any definite success, that the Germans had recovered the initiative, had conquered most of Romania, had increased her forces in the East and still had 4 million men in reserve. Asquith backed him and the committee&#x27;s conclusion, which was neither printed nor circulated, was that &quot;The offensive on the Somme, if continued next year, was not likely to lead to decisive results, and that the losses might make too heavy a drain on our resources having regard to the results to be anticipated&quot;. It was agreed to consider offensives in other theatres. The ministers again (7 November) discussed, after Robertson had left the room, the plan to send Robertson to a conference in Russia and a further inter-Allied conference to upstage the forthcoming conference of generals at Chantilly. Robertson rejected the idea as &quot;the Kitchener dodge&quot; and refused to go.

Robertson wanted industrial conscription, national service for men up the age of 55, and 900,000 new army recruits, similar to the new German Hindenburg Programme. He was concerned at the Asquith Coalition&#x27;s lack of firm leadership, once likening the Cabinet to &quot;a committee of lunatics&quot;, and although he avoided taking sides in party politics he urged the creation of a small War Committee which would simply give orders to the departmental ministers, and was concerned (letter to Hankey, 9 November) that ministers might be tempted to make peace or to reduce Britain&#x27;s Western Front commitment. Robertson gave an abusive response to the Lansdowne Memorandum (13 November 1916) (calling those who wanted to make peace &quot;cranks, cowards and philosophers&quot;).

Robertson successfully lobbied Joffre and at the Chantilly Conference (15–16 November 1916) Joffre and Robertson (in Haig&#x27;s view) &quot;crushed&quot; Lloyd George&#x27;s proposal to send greater resources to Salonika.

The Somme ended on 18 November. There was already divergence between MacDonogh and Charteris as to the likelihood of German collapse. Robertson shocked ministers by forecasting that the war would not end until summer 1918. On 21 November, Asquith again met ministers without Robertson present, and they agreed they could not order him to go to Russia. His influence was already beginning to wane. In the event departure, originally scheduled for November, was delayed until January and Wilson was sent in Robertson&#x27;s place.

At the second Chantilly Conference it had been agreed that Britain would in future take a greater share of the war on the Western Front. Asquith had written to Robertson of the War Committee&#x27;s unanimous approval of the desirability of capturing or rendering inoperable the submarine and destroyer bases at Ostend and Zeebrugge. Haig and Robertson had obtained Joffre&#x27;s approval for a British Flanders Offensive, after wearing-out attacks by Britain and France.

===Lloyd George becomes prime minister===
During the December political crisis Robertson advised Lloyd George to form a three-man War Council, which would probably include the Foreign Secretary but not the First Lord of the Admiralty or the Secretary of State for War. He was suspected of briefing the press against Asquith, and had to assure the Palace that this was not so. Robertson warned the first meeting of the new five-man War Cabinet against the danger of &quot;sideshows&quot;. By contrast Hankey advised sending aid to Italy and offensives in Palestine – Lloyd George used this as the blueprint of future strategy discussions.

With Murray&#x27;s support, in the autumn of 1916 Robertson had resisted attempts to send as many as 4,000 men to Rabegh to help the nascent Arab Revolt, stressing that logistical support would bring the total up to 16,000 men, enough to prevent Murray&#x27;s advance on El Arish. Robertson accused the ministers of &quot;attaching as much importance to a few scallywags in Arabia as I imagine they did to the German attack on Ypres two years ago&quot;, but for the first time ministers contemplated overruling him. Encouraged by hope that the Russians might advance to Mosul, removing any Turkish threat to Mesopotamia, Robertson authorised Maude to attack in December 1916.

==CIGS: Spring 1917==
===January conferences===
Robertson was appointed Aide-de-Camp General to the King on 15 January 1917 and was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 24 January 1917.

Following a fractious Anglo-French conference in London (26–28 December) the War Cabinet gave Lloyd George authority to &quot;conclude any arrangement&quot; at the forthcoming Rome conference. At the Rome Conference (5–6 January 1917) Lloyd George, advised by Hankey, proposed sending heavy guns to Italy with a view to defeating Austria-Hungary, possibly to be balanced by a transfer of Italian troops to Salonika. Robertson stressed that this was contrary to agreed policy and hinted that he might resign. Cadorna stressed the logistical difficulty of accepting the heavy guns, even when Lloyd George removed the precondition that they be returned to the Western Front by May. Robertson wrote to Lloyd George explicitly threatening to resign if he acted on Briand&#x27;s impassioned plea to send more divisions to Salonika.

A further Conference followed in London (15–16 January 1917). Cadorna was also once again talking of being able to win a major victory if reinforced by 300 heavy guns or 8 British divisions – Robertson predictably opposed this.

===Calais===
Haig wanted to delay his attack until May to coincide with Italian and Russian attacks, but was told by the government to take over French line as requested, to be ready no later than 1 April, and not cause delays. Robertson was worried about the new French Commander-in-Chief Nivelle forcing the British to attack before the ground dried. Haig demanded a meeting between British and French ministers to resolve matters, although Robertson urged him to resolve them in a face-to-face meeting with Nivelle.

Robertson later claimed that he attended the Calais Conference thinking it would be solely about railways, but this is probably untrue. Robertson was at the War Cabinet (20 February) which insisted on a conference to draw up a formal agreement about &quot;the operations of 1917&quot;.

Neither Robertson nor Derby were invited to the War Cabinet on 24 February, at which ministers felt that the French had shown themselves to be more skilful than the British, while politically Britain had to give wholehearted support to what would probably be the last major French effort of the war. Hankey also told Stamfordham that on the train to Calais Lloyd George had informed Robertson and Maurice that he had the authority of the War Cabinet &quot;to decide specifically between Generals Haig &amp; Nivelle&quot;, although the subordination of Haig to Nivelle had not been specifically discussed.

At Calais (26–7 February), after the railway experts had been sent away, at Lloyd George&#x27;s request Nivelle produced rules governing the relations between the British and French armies. Nivelle was to exercise, through British staff at GQG, operational command of British forces, with Haig left in control only of discipline (which could not legally be placed in foreign hands) and forbidden to make direct contact with London. Haig, Spears later wrote, &quot;had become a cipher, and (his) units were to be dispersed at the will of the French command... until (his) massed thousands had become mere khaki pawns scattered among the sky-blue pawns&quot;

The plans were brought to Robertson, who feeling unwell had dined with Maurice in his room, at around 9pm. In Spears&#x27; famous account Robertson&#x27;s face &quot;went the colour of mahogany ... his eyebrows slanted outwards like a forest of bayonets held at the charge – in fact he showed every sign of having a fit&quot;. Haig and Robertson visited Lloyd George – one of Robertson&#x27;s objections was that the agreement could not be binding on Dominion troops – who told them that he had the authority of the War Cabinet and that, although Nivelle&#x27;s demands were &quot;excessive&quot;, they must have a scheme agreed by 8am. The next morning, after Nivelle had claimed he had not personally drawn up the scheme, Robertson &quot;ramped up and down the room, talking about the horrible idea of putting &#x27;the wonderful army&#x27; under a Frenchman, swearing he would never serve under one&quot;. Hankey drew up a compromise rather than see Haig and Robertson resign, with Haig still under Nivelle&#x27;s orders but with tactical control of British forces and right of appeal to the War Cabinet.

===Eroding the agreement===
Robertson wrote to Haig that Lloyd George was &quot;an awful liar&quot; for claiming that the French had originated the proposal, and that he lacked the &quot;honesty &amp; truth&quot; to remain Prime Minister. Haig claimed that with the BEF spread more thinly by having recently taken over line to the south, German forces might be used to attack at Ypres and cut him off from the Channel Ports. The French assumed Haig was inventing this threat.

Robertson continued to lobby the War Cabinet of the folly of leaving the British Army under French control, passing on Haig&#x27;s demand that he keep control of the British reserves, and advising that intelligence reports suggested preparations for large-scale German troop movements in Eastern Belgium. With War Cabinet opinion having turned against Lloyd George – who was also rebuked by the King – Robertson also then submitted a memorandum stating that the Calais Agreement was not to be a permanent arrangement, along with a &quot;personal statement&quot; so critical of Lloyd George that he refused to have it included in the minutes.

The King and Esher also urged Haig and Robertson to come to an agreement with the government.

At another conference in London (12–13 March) Lloyd George expressed the government&#x27;s full support for Haig and stressed that the BEF must not be &quot;mixed up with the French Army&quot;, and Haig and Nivelle met with Robertson and Lyautey to settle their differences. The &quot;status quo ante&quot;, by which British forces were allies rather than subordinates of the French, but Haig was expected to defer to French wishes as far as possible, was essentially restored.

===Nivelle Offensive===

Robertson was sceptical of suggestions that Russia&#x27;s war effort would be reinvigorated by the Fall of the Tsar, and recommended that Britain keep up the pressure on Germany by attacking on the Western Front. He thought the US, which had declared war on Germany, would do little to help win the war. Robertson prepared another General Staff appraisal stressing how the Allied position had deteriorated since the previous summer, and again recommending diplomatic efforts to detach Germany&#x27;s allies. The day after the Nivelle Offensive began, Robertson circulated another paper warning that Nivelle would be sacked if he failed and urging the end of the Calais Agreement.

Robertson was awarded the French Croix de Guerre on 21 April 1917 and appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus from Italy on 26 May 1917.

===Other fronts: Spring 1917===
Lloyd George wanted to make the destruction of Turkey a major British war aim, and two days after taking office told Robertson that he wanted a major victory, preferably the capture of Jerusalem, to impress British public opinion. Robertson thought the capture of Beersheba should suffice, although he told Murray he wanted him to launch a Palestine Offensive, to sustain public morale, in autumn and winter 1917, if the war was still going on then. A January 1917 paper, probably drafted by Macdonogh, argued that, with a compromise peace leaving Germany in control of the Balkans increasingly likely, Britain should protect her Empire by capturing Aleppo, which would make Turkey&#x27;s hold on Palestine and Mesopotamia untenable.

With Maude having taken Baghdad (11 March 1917), the Turks having withdrawn from Persia and Medina loosely besieged by the Arabs, and Murray having made an apparently successful attack at Gaza (26 March), Robertson asked the War Cabinet for permission to order Murray to renew his offensive. Initial reports turned out to have been exaggerated, and a subsequent attack (17–19 April 1917) also failed. This coincided with the failure of the Nivelle Offensive, reports of unrest among Russian troops after the February Revolution and an escalation of the U-Boat War causing Robertson to prefer a return to a defensive policy in the Middle East.

==CIGS: Summer 1917==

===Robertson&#x27;s views on Flanders===
As Chief of Staff BEF Robertson had had Maurice, then Director of Military Operations at GHQ, prepare a study of an Ypres Offensive on 15 March 1915. The study had warned that the capture of Ostend and Zeebrugge &quot;would be a very difficult enterprise&quot; and if successful &quot;would not materially improve the military situation&quot; except in the unlikely event that it prompted a general German withdrawal – more likely it would leave the British defending a longer line supplied by only two lines of railway, at &quot;a grave disadvantage&quot; and &quot;in a rather dangerous position&quot;.

By 1917 Robertson was more keen on the idea of the Germans fighting where they would suffer at the hands of strong British artillery. He wrote to Haig cautioning against &quot;determination to push on regardless of loss&quot; and urged him instead to concentrate on &quot;inflicting heavier losses on (the enemy) than one suffers oneself&quot;. It is unclear that the letter had much effect.

===France steps back===
With the Nivelle Offensive in its final stages, Lloyd George went to the Paris Summit authorised by the War Cabinet to &quot;press the French to continue the offensive&quot;. Robertson thought Paris &quot;about the best Conference we have had&quot;. With Russian commitment to the war wavering, Smuts, Milner and Curzon agreed with Robertson that Britain must attack in the west lest France or Italy be tempted to make a separate peace.

Petain, committed to only limited attacks, became French Commander-in-Chief (15 May) and with Esher warning that the French government would not honour their Paris commitments, Robertson warned Haig that the British government would not take kindly to high casualties if Britain had to attack without wholehearted French support. Foch, now French chief of staff, also urged Robertson to conduct only limited attacks until the Americans sent more troops, and they discussed the possibility of attacks on Austria-Hungary designed to encourage her to make peace.

Robertson and Haig met (9 June) after the victory at Messines. Robertson warned Haig that the government were diverting manpower into shipbuilding, ship crews and agriculture rather than the Army, and that a prolonged offensive would leave Britain &quot;without an Army&quot; by the autumn, and suggested that attacks against Austria-Hungary might be more prudent. Haig, dismayed, retorted that &quot;Great Britain must ... win the war by herself&quot;. Haig also showed Robertson his &quot;Present Situation and Future Plans&quot; (dated 12 June) in which he argued that he had a good chance of clearing the Belgian Coast and that victory at Ypres &quot;might quite possibly lead to (German) collapse&quot;. Robertson told Haig he disagreed with the statistical appendix showing German manpower near breaking point and refused to show it to the War Cabinet.

===War Policy Committee===
The political consensus of May had broken down. Lloyd George told the War Cabinet (8 June) he was dissatisfied with military advice so far and was setting up a War Policy Committee (himself, Curzon, Milner and Smuts). Smuts, newly appointed to the Imperial War Cabinet, recommended renewed western front attacks and a policy of attrition. He privately thought Robertson &quot;good but much too narrow &amp; not adaptable enough&quot;.

Robertson objected to proposals to move divisions and heavy guns to Italy. He warned that the Germans could transfer forces to Italy easily, an attack on Trieste might leave Allied forces vulnerable to counterattack from the north, that Cadorna and his army were not competent, and conversely that they might even make peace if they succeeded in capturing Trieste. Robertson complained to Haig of the War Policy Committee&#x27;s practice of interviewing key people individually to &quot;get at facts&quot; rather than simply setting policy and allowing Robertson and Jellicoe to decide on the military means. He wrote that &quot;the (guns) will never go (to Italy) while I am CIGS&quot;. He also urged him not to promise, on his forthcoming visit to London, that he could win the war that year but simply to say that his Flanders plan was the best plan, which Robertson agreed it was, so that the politicians would not &quot;dare&quot; overrule both men.

Haig told the War Policy Committee (19 June, and contrary to Robertson&#x27;s advice) that &quot;Germany was nearer her end than they seemed to think ... Germany was within six months of the total exhaustion of her available manpower, &quot;if the fighting continues at its present intensity&quot;&quot;. At this time Haig was involved in discussions as to whether Robertson should be appointed First Lord of the Admiralty (a ministerial post), and Woodward suggests that he may have felt that Robertson had outlived his usefulness as CIGS. Ministers were not entirely convinced by Jellicoe&#x27;s warnings about German submarines and destroyers operating from the Belgian ports, but were influenced by France&#x27;s decline and by the apparent success of the Kerensky Offensive. The Flanders Offensive was finally sanctioned by the War Policy Committee on 18 July and the War Cabinet two days later, on condition that it did not degenerate into a long-drawn out fight like the Somme.

To Haig&#x27;s annoyance the War Cabinet had promised to monitor progress and casualties, and if necessary call a halt. Robertson arrived in France (22 July) to be handed a note from Kiggell, urging that the offensive continue to keep France from dropping out (even if Russia or Italy did). Over dinner Haig urged Robertson to &quot;be firmer and play the man; and, if need be, resign&quot; rather than submit to political interference. On his return Robertson wrote to Haig to assure him that he would always advise &quot;supporting wholeheartedly a plan which has once been approved&quot;. Robertson met with Cadorna and Foch (24 July) prior to another inter-Allied conference at Paris, and they agreed that the current simultaneous offensives must take priority over Allied reinforcements for Italy, even though it was now clear that the Kerensky Offensive was failing disastrously and that Germany might be able to redeploy divisions to the west.

===Middle East: New commander===
Curzon (12 May 1917) and Hankey (20 May) continued to urge that Britain seize land in the Middle East. Allenby, Murray&#x27;s replacement, had been told by Lloyd George that his objective was &quot;Jerusalem before Christmas&quot; and that he had only to ask for reinforcements, but Robertson warned him that he must take into account the needs of other fronts. Allenby&#x27;s exact remit was still undecided when he was appointed.

Allenby arrived on 27 June 1917. Robertson wanted him to keep active so as to prevent the Turks concentrating forces in Mesopotamia, although he scoffed at intelligence reports that the Germans might send as many as 160,000 men to that theatre. Allenby was eventually ordered to attack the Turks in southern Palestine, but the extent of his advance was not yet to be decided, advice which Robertson repeated in &quot;secret and personal&quot; notes (1 and 10 August).

==CIGS: Third Ypres==
===Third Ypres begins===
Third Ypres, also known as the Battle of Passchendaele, began on 31 July, with Haig claiming that German losses were double those of the British. Robertson asked Kiggell (2 August) for more information to share with ministers.

After the Inter-Allied conference in London (6–8 August 1917), at which Lloyd George had urged the creation of a common Allied General Staff, Robertson again joined with Foch in claiming that there was not time to send heavy guns to Italy for a September offensive. Robertson wrote to Haig (9 August) that Lloyd George would &quot;put up (the useless) Foch against me as he did Nivelle against you in the Spring&quot;. Haig, at the urging of Whigham (Deputy CIGS), wrote to Robertson congratulating him at the way he had &quot;supported the sound policy&quot; in London, but complaining that Macdonogh&#x27;s &quot;pessimistic estimates&quot; of German losses might cause &quot;many in authority to take a pessimistic outlook&quot;.

With the offensive already bogged down in unseasonably early wet weather, Sir John French claimed to Riddell (managing director of the &quot;News of the World&quot;, and likely to pass on French&#x27;s views to Lloyd George) that Robertson was &quot;anxious to get the whole of the military power into his own hands, that he is a capable organiser but not a great soldier, and we are suffering from a lack of military genius&quot;. Lloyd George suggested that all Robertson&#x27;s plans be submitted to a committee of French, Wilson and one other, although Wilson thought this &quot;ridiculous and unworkable&quot;.

Robertson wrote to Haig (17 August) warning him of the shortage of manpower, and to &quot;scrape up all the men (he could) in France&quot;. He also warned Haig that there were at that time less than 8,000 &quot;A1&quot; soldiers at home, and that Home Forces were largely made up of &quot;boys&quot; of eighteen whom Robertson thought too young for service in France. Haig had to tell his Army Commanders that the BEF would be 100,000 men under establishment by October.

The Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo began (18 August) and on 26 August, the British Ambassador in Rome advised that there might be &quot;a complete smashing&quot; of the Austro-Hungarian Army. Robertson advised that it was &quot;false strategy&quot; to call off Third Ypres to send reinforcements to Italy, but after being summoned to George Riddell&#x27;s home in Sussex, agreed to send a message promising support to Cadorna, but only on condition Cadorna promised decisive victory. The Anglo-French leadership agreed in early September to send 100 heavy guns to Italy, 50 of them from the French Army on Haig&#x27;s left, rather than the 300 which Lloyd George wanted. Robertson expressed his concern that the heavy shelling necessary to break enemy defences at Ypres was destroying the ground.

As soon as the guns reached Italy, Cadorna called off his offensive (21 September).

===Third Ypres: reluctance to call a halt===
Robertson felt that Lloyd George&#x27;s proposal for an Anglo-French landing at Alexandretta would use up too much shipping and told the War Policy Committee (24 September) that he felt Allenby had enough resources to take Jerusalem, although he stressed the logistical difficulties of advancing 400 miles to Aleppo.

Bonar Law, having guessed from a recent talk with Robertson that he had little hope &quot;of anything coming of&quot; Third Ypres, wrote to Lloyd George that ministers must soon decide whether the offensive was to continue. Lloyd George travelled to Boulogne (25 September) where he broached with Painlevé the setting up of an Allied Supreme War Council and making Foch generalissimo. On 26 September Lloyd George and Robertson met Haig to discuss the recent German peace feelers, one of which suggested she might give up her colonies, Belgium, Serbia and Alsace-Lorraine in return for keeping Poland and the Baltic States. Ministers were reluctant to accept this, but at the same time were concerned that Britain could not defeat Germany singlehandedly.

Haig preferred to continue the offensive, encouraged by Plumer&#x27;s recent successful attacks in dry weather at Menin Road (20 September) and Polygon Wood (26 September), and stating that the Germans were &quot;very worn out&quot;. Robertson spoke to the Army Commanders, but declined Haig&#x27;s offer that he do so without Haig present. He later regretted not having done so. He later wrote in his memoirs that &quot;I was not prepared to carry my doubts to the point of opposing (Haig)&quot; or of preventing one more push which might have &quot;convert(ed) an inconclusive battle into a decisive victory&quot;.

On his return Robertson wrote Haig an equivocal letter (27 September) stating that he stuck to his advice to concentrate effort on the Western Front rather than Palestine out of instinct and lack of any alternative than from any convincing argument. He also wrote that &quot;Germany may be much nearer the end of her staying power than available evidence shows&quot; but that given French and Italian weakness it was &quot;not an easy business to see through the problem&quot;.

Robertson&#x27;s refusal to advise a halt to Third Ypres cost him the support of Smuts and Milner. By the end of the year the Cabinet Committee on Manpower were hearing about an alarming rise in drunkenness, desertions and psychological disorders in the BEF, and reports of soldiers&#x27; returning from the front grumbling about &quot;the waste of life&quot; at Ypres.

===Palestine manpower requirements===
At the War Policy Committee (3 October) in Robertson&#x27;s absence, Lloyd George urged greater effort to advance into Syria with a view to knocking Turkey out of the war; the ministers decided to redeploy two divisions from France. Robertson angered the Prime Minister (5 October) by arguing against this. He also asked Allenby to state his extra troop requirements to advance from the Gaza–Beersheba line (30 miles wide) to the Jaffa–Jerusalem line (50 miles wide), urging him to take no chances in estimating the threat of a German-reinforced threat, but urging Maude not to exaggerate his needs in Mesopotamia.

Robertson, worried that he would be overruled as Painlevé was visiting London for talks, without waiting for Allenby&#x27;s reply, claimed (9 October) that 5 divisions would need to be redeployed from France to reach the Jaffa-Jerusalem line. That same day Allenby&#x27;s own estimate arrived, claiming that he would need 13 extra divisions (an impossible demand even if Haig&#x27;s forces went on the defensive). Yet in private letters Allenby and Robertson agreed that sufficient British Empire troops were already in place to take and hold Jerusalem. The politicians were particularly irritated that they were being shown clearly exaggerated estimates at a time when the General Staff were demanding renewed effort to &quot;divert (Germany&#x27;s) strategic reserve&quot; to Flanders.

In his 8 October paper, Haig claimed that since 1 April 1917, 135 of the 147 German divisions on the Western Front had been driven from their positions or withdrawn after suffering losses, several of them two or three times, and argued that the Allies could beat Germany in 1918 even if Russia were to make peace. The War Cabinet was sceptical, and in his reply (9 October) Robertson, although he thought Haig&#x27;s memo &quot;splendid&quot;, cautioned that German Army morale still seemed to be holding up well. He wrote to Haig in the same letter that &quot;the Palestine thing will &quot;not&quot; come off&quot;, and having heard from Lord Robert Cecil that Haig was dissatisfied with him, asked him to &quot;let me do my own job in my own way&quot; in standing up for proper principles of warfare against Lloyd George. He also commented that Lloyd George was &quot;out for my blood&quot; and claimed that &quot;Milner, Carson, Cecil, Curzon and Balfour, have each in turn expressly spoken to me separately about his intolerable conduct&quot;, that he would &quot;manage&quot; Lloyd George, and that Painleve&#x27;s recent visit to London had been an attempt to &quot;carry him off his feet&quot; but that he &quot;had big feet!&quot;.

Robertson also advised against the Prime Minister&#x27;s recent talk of setting up a Supreme War Council, reminding ministers of the Nivelle fiasco and the sending of heavy guns to Italy only for Cadorna to call off his offensive, and wanted Britain to dominate operations in 1918 by virtue of the strength of her army and her political stability.

===Politicians seek other advice===
The War Cabinet (11 October 1917) invited Wilson and French to submit formal written advice, a blatant undermining of Robertson&#x27;s position. Dining with Wilson and French the night before, Lloyd George claimed that Robertson was &quot;afraid of Haig, &amp; that both of them are pigheaded, stupid &amp; narrow visioned&quot;. Wilson and French urged no major war-winning offensive until 1919. Robertson thought the War Cabinet a &quot;weak kneed craven hearted Cabinet ... Lloyd George hypnotises them and is allowed to run riot&quot;. Derby had to remind them that Robertson was still their constitutional adviser. Haig advised Robertson not to resign until his advice had actually been rejected.

As advised by Wilson and Viscount French, Lloyd George persuaded the War Cabinet and the French to agree to a Supreme War Council. Hankey (20 October) suspected that the plan of an inter-allied staff of generals in Paris would alone be enough to drive Robertson to resignation. Wilson was appointed British Permanent Military Representative after it had been offered to Robertson (which would have meant giving up his CIGS job). Robertson later claimed in his memoirs that he supported the SWC as a political body, but not the military advisers providing separate advice from the national general staffs.

==CIGS: 1917–18==

===Rapallo and Paris===
The argument was overtaken by disaster on the Italian front: the Battle of Caporetto began on 24 October. Robertson went to Italy to supervise deployment of British divisions, meeting Lloyd George, Hankey and Wilson when they arrived for the Rapallo Conference (6–7 November), which formally established the Supreme War Council. Robertson had been told by Hankey that Lloyd George had the War Cabinet&#x27;s backing, and Lloyd George later wrote of Robertson&#x27;s &quot;sullen and unhelpful&quot; attitude at the conference. He walked out of the meeting, telling Hankey &quot;I wash my hands of this business&quot;, and contemplated resignation, as he had over the French-Wilson papers.

Lloyd George and Robertson had long been briefing the press against one another. After Lloyd George&#x27;s Paris speech (12 November), in which he said that &quot;when he saw the appalling casualty lists&quot; he &quot;wish(ed) it had not been necessary to win so many (&quot;victories&quot;)&quot;, and unlike the Nivelle Affair, Lloyd George&#x27;s differences with the generals were being aired in public for the first time. The &quot;Daily News&quot;, &quot;Star&quot; and &quot;Globe&quot; attacked Lloyd George.

Robertson reported to the War Cabinet that Italy&#x27;s situation was like that of Russia in 1915 and that she might not recover. In his paper &quot;Future Military Policy&quot; (19 November), Robertson was impressed by the French Army&#x27;s recovery under Petain but advised that lack of French reserves might make major French offensives in 1918 unlikely. He rejected a purely defensive posture in the west, as even defending would still result in heavy casualties, but was sceptical of Haig&#x27;s wish to renew the Ypres Offensive in Spring 1918, and argued that Britain should build up her strength on the Western Front and then decide on the scale of her 1918 offensives. He warned (correctly) that, with Russia dropping out of the war, the Germans would use the opportunity to attack in 1918 before the American Expeditionary Force were present in strength.

Amid talk of Austen Chamberlain withdrawing support from the government, Robertson briefed the Opposition Leader Asquith. However, Lloyd George survived the Commons debate on Rapallo (19 November) by praising the generals and claiming that the aim of the Supreme War Council was purely to &quot;coordinate&quot; policy.

===SWC and Inter-Allied Reserve===

Derby got the Prime Minister to agree that Robertson should accompany Wilson (British Military Representative) to all Supreme War Council meetings and he would make no proposals until Robertson and the War Council had had a chance to vet them. He then reneged on this promise, telling Derby (26 November) that Robertson would have a chance to comment at the meeting itself and that decisions would have to ratified by the War Cabinet after they had been made. Lloyd George restored Wilson&#x27;s freedom of action by instructing Wilson to send his reports directly to him.

By the time of the initial SWC meeting (1 December 1917) Allenby&#x27;s successes, culminating in the Fall of Jerusalem (9 December 1917), demonstrated the potential of attacks in the Middle East, particularly compared to Haig&#x27;s apparently unproductive offensive at Ypres, followed by Cambrai in November. Russia had finally collapsed (Brest Litovsk Armistice 16 December) yet only a handful of American divisions were available so far in the west.

After the Fall of Jerusalem Derby threatened to resign if Lloyd George sacked Robertson, but the War Cabinet (11–12 December) minuted its dissatisfaction at the information which he had given them about Palestine. Maurice claimed that intelligence from Syria &quot;was too stale to be of use&quot; and Robertson claimed that the speed of Allenby&#x27;s advance had taken everyone by surprise.

After the Fall of Jerusalem, Allenby irritated Robertson by writing that he could conquer the rest of Palestine with his present force of 6–8 divisions, but said he would need 16–18 divisions for a further advance of 250 miles to Aleppo (the Damascus-Beirut Line) to cut Turkish communications to Mesopotamia. In a paper of 26 December, Robertson claimed that the conquest of the remainder of Palestine might mean an extra 57,000 battle casualties and 20,000 sick. Amery thought this &quot;an amazing document even from him&quot; and that such arguments could have been produced against any major campaign in history. By mid-January Amery and Lloyd George were arranging for the Permanent Military Representatives at Versailles to discuss Palestine.

Robertson tried to control William Raine Marshall (Maude&#x27;s replacement as C-in-C Mesopotamia) by handpicking his staff. Smuts was sent to Egypt to confer with Allenby and Marshall and prepare for major efforts in that theatre. Before his departure, alienated by Robertson&#x27;s cooking of the figures, he urged Robertson&#x27;s removal. Allenby told Smuts of Robertson&#x27;s private instructions that there was no merit in any further advance and worked with Smuts to draw up plans for further advances in Palestine.

Wilson wanted Robertson reduced &quot;from the position of a Master to that of a servant&quot;. Robertson thought Wilson&#x27;s SWC Joint Note 12, which predicted that neither side could win a decisive victory on the Western Front in 1918, and that decisive results could be had against Turkey, &quot;d-----d rot in general&quot; and promised Haig he would &quot;stick to (his) guns and clear out if (he was) overruled&quot;. Robertson opposed attacks on Turkey, siding openly with Clemenceau against Lloyd George. Although Robertson apologised for doing so, the Prime Minister was angry and told Wilson afterwards that he would have to get rid of Robertson. Robertson&#x27;s request to be on the Executive Board controlling the planned Allied General Reserve was overruled.

Robertson called the Executive War Board the &quot;Versailles Soviet&quot; and claimed to the King&#x27;s adviser Lord Stamfordham that having &quot;practically, two CIGSs&quot; would lead to &quot;destruction of confidence among the troops&quot;. He also briefed Gwynne against the proposals, writing that &quot;the little man&quot; was &quot;all out for (his) blood&quot; and &quot;to see that the fine British Army is not placed at the mercy of irresponsible people – &amp; some of them foreigners at that&quot;.

===Fall from power===
Robertson was finally forced out in February 1918 over his refusal to agree that the British representative at the Supreme War Council at Versailles should be Deputy CIGS and a member of the Army Council (giving him the right to issue orders to the BEF). He distrusted the dual chain of command set up by the War Cabinet, and he wanted civilians to stay out of military decision-making. Lloyd George offered Robertson a choice of remaining as CIGS in London with reduced powers or accepting the Versailles job. Robertson&#x27;s position was that either the CIGS should himself be the Versailles delegate or else the Versailles representative should be clearly subordinate to the CIGS. There was talk of the government falling, and Lloyd George attempted to have Robertson swap jobs with Plumer, then commanding British troops in Italy (Plumer refused).

Haig was summoned to London to be consulted. Haig, whose relations with Robertson had been deteriorating since at least the Boulogne Conference of September 1917, told Robertson it was his duty to go to Versailles or anywhere else the government wanted, and advised the King to insist on Robertson going to Versailles. Derby withdrew his resignation. Four days of argument, 11 February 1918 through to 14 February 1918, ensued between Robertson and the War Cabinet. The King thought it would be &quot;a national calamity&quot; if Robertson was removed but when told of this Lloyd George told Stamfordham that &quot;he did not share the King&#x27;s extremely favourable opinion&quot; of Robertson and that the government would resign if the King attempted to block Robertson&#x27;s removal. Curzon and Balfour were sympathetic to Robertson&#x27;s position, but he lost Balfour&#x27;s sympathy at a Cabinet meeting on 14 February where he made clear his dislike of Wilson. He had told Stamfordham that he would serve at Versailles under Plumer as CIGS, but not under Wilson &quot;his Junior&quot;.

As part of Lloyd George&#x27;s power struggle with Robertson and his press supporters, on 16 February the prominent journalists Gwynne and Repington appeared at Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court charged with having contravened DORA Regulation 18 by printing articles discussing the conflict between Versailles and the War Office, Lloyd George&#x27;s plans to concentrate efforts against Turkey, and the failure to keep the Army up to strength. Robertson&#x27;s wife was in the crowd, as were his colleagues Macdonogh and Maurice. Repington later claimed that Robertson had told him that he could no more afford to be seen with him than either of them &quot;could afford to be seen walking down Regent Street with a whore&quot;.

After a fortnight of argument Robertson&#x27;s &quot;resignation&quot; was announced. Lloyd George, possibly aware that Robertson was dependent on his army pay, suggested he be given command of an Army in France, but Haig said he &quot;was quite unfitted to command troops&quot;. Wilson and Robertson had a very brief handover meeting at the War Office, at which Robertson (by Wilson&#x27;s account) was &quot;grumpy and ungracious &amp; said he had nothing to say – and indeed said nothing&quot;. Wilson later recalled that he &quot;walked out without handing me over anything in particular&quot;.

===After CIGS: the Maurice Affair===
Robertson was appointed General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Eastern Command in February 1918.

After the German &quot;Michael&quot; Offensive, the press blamed Lloyd George for starving the army of men, while the &quot;Star&quot; called for Robertson to be appointed Secretary of State for War. The &quot;Star&quot; later blamed the Versailles machinery for forcing a depleted Fifth Army to take over more front, while the &quot;Globe&quot; and &quot;Morning Post&quot; called for Robertson&#x27;s restoration as CIGS. Lloyd George was amenable to Haig&#x27;s suggestion that Robertson be appointed Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the BEF. Repington in the &quot;Morning Post&quot; called this suggestion &quot;a pretext for getting him out of the way of the imbeciles&quot; in London and called for Lloyd George&#x27;s removal as Prime Minister.

On 29 April Robertson met with his former assistant Maj-Gen Maurice to discuss concerns that Lloyd George had misled the House of Commons on 9 April about the weakness of the BEF prior to the German &quot;Michael&quot; Offensive. Robertson suggested that he write to Henry Wilson and then, if necessary to the press. Maurice composed his letter on 2 May but did not yet send it. Robertson wrote to him on 4 May, writing that not too much credence should be given to imminent predictions of Lloyd George&#x27;s downfall, that Maurice should take especial care to get his facts exactly right, and adding: &quot;You are contemplating a great thing – to your undying credit&quot;.

The Maurice letter, a blatant breach of King&#x27;s Regulations, appeared in several newspapers on 7 May. Maurice denied that it was a military conspiracy to overthrow a civilian government, and claimed &quot;it ha(d) been seen by no soldier&quot; (omitting to mention that Robertson had encouraged him). Lloyd George later claimed in his memoirs that Robertson had been aiming to topple the government and become a military dictator like Hindenburg. However, although journalists like Gwynne and Maxse sometimes dropped such hints, there is no evidence that this was Robertson&#x27;s intention. Robertson thought Lloyd George would survive the crisis, although he may have hoped to be restored as CIGS. Lloyd George survived the Maurice Debate (9 May).

Robertson was promoted to General Officer Commanding-in-Chief for Home Forces in June 1918. He visited each regional command, and took a special interest in the air defence of London.

==Post-war==

Robertson became Commander-in-Chief of the British Army of the Rhine in April 1919. At a tennis-party at his house in Cologne, the young Captain Montgomery persuaded him to add his name to the list of officers selected for Staff College, which would be his only hope of achieving high command.

Robertson was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours in June 1919. He was not invited to the peace celebration on 19 July 1919. He was thanked by Parliament, granted £10,000 (the capital was held in trust and only the income made available) and created a Baronet of Welbourn in Lincolnshire on 29 December 1919.

After the War he was awarded the Belgian War Cross, the Grand Cross of the Serbian Order of the White Eagle (with Swords) and the American Distinguished Service Medal. This was as well as being appointed to the Chinese Order of Chia-Ho (1st Class), being given the Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown of Italy, being appointed to the Russian Order of Alexander Nevsky and receiving the Japanese Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun.

Troop reductions meant that the Rhine Command was being downgraded to a lieutenant-general&#x27;s command, so in July 1919 Churchill offered Robertson the Irish Command, often a last posting for distinguished generals nearing retirement. Although the level of violence in Ireland in 1919 was not yet as high as it would be in 1920–21, there were concerns that Robertson lacked the subtlety for the job. In October the CIGS Henry Wilson warned Churchill that the planned introduction of Irish Home Rule would lead to unrest, and asked him to consult the Prime Minister, perhaps in the knowledge that Lloyd George disliked Robertson. Lloyd George suggested that Robertson be appointed Commander-in-Chief, India, but this job was already earmarked for Rawlinson. Lloyd George preferred Macready for the Irish job, as he had experience of peacekeeping duties in South Wales and Belfast as well as having served as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in London. Churchill again told the Prime Minister in February 1920 that he wanted Robertson, then protested that he had been overruled. He promoted Robertson to field marshal &quot;as a consolation prize&quot; on 29 March 1920, making him the only man ever to rise in the British army from private to field marshal. Wilson thought the promotion as &quot;very disgusting&quot;.

On returning to the UK, Robertson received no official welcome at Victoria Station and later recorded that &quot;having secured a broken-down taxi I drove to my residence in Eccleston Square; and thereupon joined the long list of unemployed officers on half-pay&quot;.

==Later life==

Robertson was colonel of the 2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys) from 9 March 1916 and colonel of the 3rd/6th Dragoon Guards from 31 December 1925. He became Colonel of the Royal Horse Guards in 1928; this made him Gold Stick and a member of the Royal Household. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in 1931.

On retirement Robertson&#x27;s life savings had been a mere £600 (just over £20,000 at 2014 prices). He became chairman of the Brewers&#x27; Trustees and a director of British Dyestuffs Corporation as well as President of the British Legion. He became a director of the British Palestine Corporation and of the London General Omnibus Company – forty years later he was still remembered for his efforts on behalf of the men&#x27;s welfare. Despite having made gifts to members of his family, on his death he left a modest fortune of £49,000 (almost £3,000,000 at 2014 prices).

Although not a pacifist, in his later years Robertson often spoke out against the cost – both financial and human – of war. His interests were fishing, shooting and golf. Early in 1933 he told Edmonds that his chief regret was that he had never had a command in the field. He died from a thrombosis on 12 February 1933, aged 73. Mount Robertson in the Canadian Rockies and Sir William Robertson High School in his birth village, Welbourn, were named after him.

He was buried at Brookwood Cemetery.

==Personality and assessments==
Robertson was a man of strong physique and physical presence, admired by the King for his rise from humble origins. He had a prodigious memory and was very quick on the uptake, sometimes interrupting briefings with: &quot;yes, I have got that, get on to the next point&quot;. However, although he could be amusing company off duty, as he rose the career ladder his brusque manner, possibly adopted to assert his authority, became more marked, even with superiors. &quot;I&#x27;ve &#x27;eard different&quot; was a favourite retort to politicians who made military suggestions.

Churchill later wrote that Robertson &quot;was an outstanding military personality. His vision as a strategist was not profound ... he had no ideas of his own, but a sensible judgement negative in bias&quot;, but he also commented that Robertson &quot;had never himself at any time led even a troop in action, and whose war duties involved him in no more risk than many clerks&quot;. Hankey wrote that &quot;he knew what he wanted and he nearly always got his own way&quot;.

In October 1918 Foch told Derby that Robertson was &quot;a far sounder man than Wilson&quot; with a greater grasp of strategic detail, but less able to keep the British Cabinet on side. Foch had earlier told Spears &quot;Robertson builds small, but he builds solid&quot;.

Spears wrote that he was an overwhelming personality ... very intolerant of ignorance ... arrogant, aitchless when excited, and flat-footed (both figuratively and physically) ... an ambulating refrigerator ... when speaking of (any minister) he generally closed the sentence by making the gesture of a governess rapping the knuckles of a child fiddling with things on the table ... a great man, probably the best and finest soldier we produced in the war ... his manners were not good ... for the sake of standing by Haig he probably put aside and overrode many ideas of his own ... (in his loyalty to Haig) he was &quot;plus royaliste que le roi&quot;. His papers were &quot;a monument of common sense and foresight&quot;. Spears&#x27; secretary was the daughter of Maurice, whom he described as &quot;Man Friday&quot; to &quot;this whale of a man, this soldier shipwrecked on the desert island of politics&quot;. Lloyd George accused Robertson of having &quot;a profound and disturbing suspicion of all foreigners&quot;.

Lloyd George&#x27;s biographer John Grigg is extremely critical of Robertson&#x27;s behaviour during the Maurice Affair of May 1918. &quot;In a remarkable, if flawed, career this was the ignoblest episode ... Robertson&#x27;s manipulative conduct [in encouraging Maurice to breach King&#x27;s Regulations and destroy his own career] stands to his eternal discredit&quot;. Grigg believes that Robertson hoped to be reinstated as CIGS. Given Robertson&#x27;s behaviour, Lloyd George&#x27;s fears of a military plot to oust him were &quot;not entirely fanciful&quot;.

===Relations with Haig and other generals===
Robertson later wrote in his autobiography that &quot;there was never, so far as I know, any material difference of opinion between (himself and Haig) in regard to the main principles to be observed in order to win the war&quot;.

David Woodward argues that, while his partnership with Haig was &quot;arguably the most important partnership in British military history&quot;, to some extent Robertson would have preferred more cautious attritional attacks rather than Haig&#x27;s attempts at achieving deeper territorial objectives and possibly even breakthrough. Lloyd George claimed that Robertson was dominated by Haig, his senior in rank and social position; Woodward does not wholly accept this: although he did discourage Haig&#x27;s promotion to field marshal while the Somme battle was still underway, in general Robertson simply thought it inappropriate to question Haig&#x27;s plans while they were being carried out.

Cassar writes that Robertson was &quot;blunt, graceless and prone to emotional outbursts when upset&quot;. &quot;One can only speculate why someone as tough-minded and opinionated as Robertson would habitually defer to Haig. The reason, it would seem, was ... because he was convinced that any split between the two would be exploited by the politicians to further their own agendas&quot;.

Haig&#x27;s diary records that Robertson was hard to work with as he was not &quot;a gentleman&quot;, and he wrote to his wife that he was &quot;tactless&quot; for wanting to come out to France during Messines &quot;all for his own advertisement&quot;.

Robertson&#x27;s rival Wilson appears to have held him in similar social disdain. Early in Robertson&#x27;s tenure as Commandant at Staff College (20 December 1910), he did not speak to Wilson when he visited Staff College with the CIGS Nicholson, causing his predecessor to complain to Nicholson about his &quot;most rude &amp; unpardonable behaviour&quot;. Wilson wrote (in 1915) &quot;He is secretive &amp;, like all underbreds, suspicious; also his manners are somewhat repugnant&quot; and that he was &quot;a slippery old boy&quot; and &quot;It is d(amnable?) to work with a man who is not a gentleman. The moment the strain comes so does the hairy heel&quot;.

Robertson&#x27;s lack of social graces was also remarked on by the staff officer Philip Howell in 1915 and, in 1933, by General &quot;Tavish&quot; Davidson.

===Relations with politicians===
Edmonds later argued that Robertson had lost his position because of his bluntness and inability to get on with politicians. Woodward rejects this argument, arguing that although the government&#x27;s failure to agree on clear war aims made his job much harder, ministers largely supported Robertson&#x27;s commitment to the Western Front throughout 1916 and 1917, until the manpower situation meant that a winding-down of that commitment was becoming inevitable. Robertson himself noted in 1932 that his survival as CIGS had often depended on Lloyd George&#x27;s inability to persuade either the French or his ministerial colleagues to adopt his plans rather than Robertson&#x27;s.

Much ink has been spilled over Robertson&#x27;s behaviour over Third Ypres, when he kept from the government both his disagreements with Haig and, in mid-June, Lt-Col Edward Spears&#x27; reports on the extent of the French Mutiny. Terraine, quoting Victor Bonham-Carter, argued that by the second half of 1917 the distrust between Robertson and Lloyd George was such that he felt that, if he did not stand solid with Haig, Lloyd George would lose the war by transferring resources to other fronts. Woodward describes Robertson&#x27;s behaviour as &quot;indefensible&quot;.

==Family==
Late in 1894, after his return from Chitral, he married Mildred Palin, the daughter of Lt-Gen Charles Thomas Palin of the Indian Army, but her family did not approve of the match. Their first child, a son, died in infancy; they then had two daughters and two more sons. His elder surviving son, Brian Hubert, succeeded to the baronetcy, rose to become a general in the British Army and was raised to the peerage as Baron Robertson of Oakridge in 1961. His younger son John predeceased him, a tragedy which clouded his final years.

<doc id="1054042" wikidata="Q1412123" url="?curid=1054042" title="Scratching post">
<text>A scratching post is a wooden post covered in rough material that cat owners provide so their pets have an acceptable place to scratch. The most common type consists of a wooden post, roughly tall, covered in rough fabric or sisal. The post is mounted vertically in a wide base, which allows the cat to stretch upward on its rear legs and scratch freely without tipping it over. A post that is unstable or does not allow a cat to fully extend its body might put off the cat from using it. Surfaces vary: the post may be covered in sisal rope, upholstery fabric, the jute backing of a piece of carpet, or sections of corrugated cardboard. Many pet owners say they have to experiment with different surfaces to find one that their cats will scratch reliably. Matt Wildman, a cat behaviorist, explained that sisal or corrugated cardboard surfaces are favored by most cats. Other kinds of scratching posts are more elaborate, with several levels of horizontal platforms for climbing and cozy cave-like areas where cats may hide. Very tall ones are often called &quot;cat trees.&quot; These may have a vertical tension rod that extends to the ceiling to provide extra stability.

==Background==
Smaller scratching surfaces may consist of something as simple as a piece of carpet turned upside down, or a flat pad of woven sisal with a loop to allow it to hang from a doorknob. Others are made from corrugated fiberboard.

Scratching posts may be purchased at most stores that carry pet supplies and online, like Amazon, Walmart, and Target and other stores. However, many people construct their own.

== Why cats scratch ==
Cats have a natural urge to scratch. Due to cats being predators it is a reflex for them to sharpen their claws. However, there are additional reasons a domestic cat still has this urge as well. These functional reasons include removing the outer sheath of the nail, exercising the muscles of the paws, and stretching. Scratching is also a social outlet for cats that facilitates communication. Cats have scent glands in their paws, allowing them to leave their scents and pheromones on surfaces to mark territory. Indoor cats may be prevented from exercising this urge on furniture if they are provided with an acceptable scratching post.

<doc id="1054043" wikidata="Q720653" url="?curid=1054043" title="Toei Asakusa Line">
<text>The is a subway line in Tokyo, Japan, operated by the municipal subway operator Toei Subway. The line runs between in Ōta and in Sumida. The line is named after the Asakusa district, a cultural center of Tokyo, under which it passes.

The Asakusa Line was the first subway line in Japan to offer through services with a private railway. Today, it has more through services to other lines than any other subway line in Tokyo. Keikyu operates through trains on the Keikyu Main Line to and the Keikyu Airport Line to . The Keisei Electric Railway operates through trains on the Keisei Oshiage Line to and the Keisei Main Line to , and the Shibayama Railway runs trains via the Keisei Main Line and the Shibayama Railway Line to . Via its through services with Keisei and Keikyu, the Asakusa line is the only train line that offers a direct connection between Tokyo&#x27;s two main airports.

The Asakusa Line is often split into two routes: Oshiage–Sengakuji and Sengakuji–Nishi-magome; only some trains make all station stops on the line, as many trains travel on the Keikyu Main Line south of Sengakuji.

On maps and signboards, the line is shown in the color rose. Stations carry the letter &quot;A&quot; followed by a two-digit number inside a more reddish vermilion circle.

==Services==
* Local (普通 &quot;futsū&quot;) trains operate between Nishi-Magome and Sengakuji approximately every ten minutes and are timed to connect to Keikyu through service trains at Sengakuji.
* Rapid service (快速 &quot;kaisoku&quot;) trains operate between Nishi-Magome and Keisei Sakura Station approximately every twenty minutes. They make all station stops on the Asakusa Line.
* Limited Express (快特 &quot;kaitoku&quot;) trains operate approximately every twenty minutes. They generally use Keikyu rolling stock and have a southern terminus at Misakiguchi Station or Keikyu Kurihama Station. They operate as Limited Express trains only on the Keikyu line, and provide local service on the Asakusa Line and Keisei Oshiage Line. Their northern terminus is generally either Aoto Station or Keisei Takasago Station, but select trains operate to Narita International Airport.
* Limited Express (快特 &quot;kaitoku&quot;) trains operate approximately every twenty minutes and make all stops (local service) on the Asakusa Line, providing Limited Express service on the Keikyu line between Sengakuji and . Their northern terminus is usually either Inzai-Makinohara Station or Inba-Nihon-Idai Station on the Hokuso Railway.
* Airport Limited Express (エアポート快特 &quot;eapōto kaitoku&quot;) trains operate approximately every twenty minutes, and skip certain stations while operating on the Asakusa Line. Their northern terminus alternates between &quot;Access Express&quot; (アクセス特急 &quot;akusesu tokkyū&quot;) service to Narita International Airport and Limited Express service to either Aoto or Takasago. The total travel time from Haneda Airport to Narita Airport on this train is approximately one hour and 46 minutes.

== Station list ==
* All stations are located in Tokyo.
* The &quot;Airport Limited Express/Access Express&quot; stops at stations marked &quot;●&quot;, skips those marked &quot;|&quot;. All other services stop at every station.


==Rolling stock==
A variety of rolling stock is in use due to the large number of through service operators on the line, all of which use standard gauge tracks and 1,500 V DC electrification via overhead lines. Currently, six operators run trains onto the Asakusa Line, the most of any Tokyo subway line, and the line is unique as the only subway line in Tokyo with through services onto standard gauge railways (all other through services are with narrow gauge lines).

== History ==
The Toei Asakusa Line was the first subway line constructed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. The line number is Line 1, because it was technically the first subway line in Tokyo to be planned in the 1920s as an underground route connecting the Keikyu and Keisei Electric Railway via , eventually allowing for through trains between these two railways. In its original plan form, the line would have actually bypassed Asakusa Station entirely. However, the plan was changed to take advantage of the existing Tobu Isesaki Line (section now named as the Tobu Skytree Line) and Tokyo Metro Ginza Line connections at Asakusa.

Construction of this line began on 27 August 1956 after years of delays, and the initial segment between Oshiage and Asakusabashi opened on 4 December 1960. The line then opened in stages from north to south:
* May 1962: Asakusabashi to Higashi-Nihombashi
* September 1962: Higashi-Nihombashi to Ningyōchō
* February 1963: Ningyōchō to Higashi-Ginza
* December 1963: Higashi-Ginza to Shimbashi
* October 1964: Shimbashi to Daimon
* June 1968: Daimon to Sengakuji (Through service with Keikyū begins)
* 15 November 1968: Sengakuji to Nishi-Magome

The line was named Asakusa Line on 1 July 1978.

From 1998 to 2002, the Asakusa Line was used as part of a rail connection between Tokyo&#x27;s two major airports, Haneda and Narita. While a few trains still run between the airports, the service has greatly diminished in frequency since 2002.

In 2005, a research group of government, metropolitan and railway company officials proposed that the Asakusa Line be connected to Tokyo Station via a spur to the north of Takarachō Station. This would provide Tokyo Station&#x27;s first direct connection to the Toei subway network. It would also make it possible to reach Haneda Airport in 25 minutes (versus 35 minutes today) and Narita Airport in 40 minutes (versus 57 minutes today). This plan has yet to be finalized or formally adopted. Authorities are re-considering a similar plan as part of the infrastructure improvements for the 2020 Summer Olympics; the proposed line would cut travel time to Haneda from 30 minutes to 18 minutes, and to Narita from 55 minutes to 36 minutes, at a total cost of around 400 billion yen.

<doc id="1054045" wikidata="Q291577" url="?curid=1054045" title="Cristina Scabbia">
<text>Cristina Adriana Chiara Scabbia (; born 5 June 1972) is an Italian singer. She is one of the two vocalists of gothic metal band Lacuna Coil. 

Scabbia used to write an advice column in the rock magazine &quot;Revolver&quot;, alongside musician Vinnie Paul. Scabbia is featured in a Megadeth song &quot;À Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)&quot;. She also featured on &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot;, an album from Arjen Anthony Lucassen&#x27;s Ayreon project, with which she is cast as the Mother. She is also the featured artist in the Apocalyptica song &quot;S.O.S. (Anything But Love)&quot; and another version of the Alter Bridge song &quot;Watch Over You&quot;. Scabbia performed a duet with the Italian ex-singer of Linea 77 Emiliano Audisio on the track &quot;Beautiful Lie&quot; to be part of the soundtrack for the 2013 Italian film &quot;Passione sinistra&quot;.

== Lacuna Coil ==


In 1991, Scabbia began singing professionally as a touring musician for other bands and providing backing vocals. Later that year, she met the male vocalist Andrea Ferro and bass player Marco Coti Zelati of Lacuna Coil in Milan&#x27;s Midnight club and started dating Marco after. At the time, the band was named Ethereal, and Scabbia was asked to do vocals by Marco. She recorded vocals on the demo tapes and was then invited to be a permanent member.

After several changes in the band&#x27;s line-up, the members were reduced to Ferro, Coti Zelati and Scabbia. The members recorded a two-track demo in May 1996, and were soon signed by the German branch of Century Media, eventually joining with the American branch of the label. Once signed, the band changed their name to Lacuna Coil after learning that a Greek band signed to Century Media had already claimed the name Ethereal. Adding new band members, Lacuna Coil released their first album in 1999.

== Other work ==
Songs performed by Cristina Scabbia feature in the &quot;Dream of the Beast&quot; downloadable content (DLC) for the video game &quot;&quot;.

Scabbia also provided vocals for Kevin Sherwood&#x27;s &quot;Destroy Something Beautiful&quot;, featured in &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&quot;

<doc id="1054046" wikidata="Q1967137" url="?curid=1054046" title="Harmston">
<text>Harmston is a village and civil parish in the North Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England. It is situated just west off the A607, and south from the city and county town of Lincoln. It sits on the Lincoln Cliff overlooking the River Witham valley.

==History==
The village is a documented settlement in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;. The site of a toft, a settlement of small and relatively closely packed farms, lies towards the western end of Chapel Lane.

Harmston Hall was built as a manor house, totalling , in 1710 for Sir Charles Thorold, and in 1719 was the home of Sir George Thorold, Lord Mayor of London. In 1930 it became part of a mental health hospital complex, and functioned as the headquarters for the Lincolnshire Joint Board for Mental Defectives. The hospital closed in 1989, the site being redeveloped as a private residence.
Harmston remained a small village until the mid-1990s when the new owner of Harmston Hall, a local property developer, made plans for a housing development at the southern perimeter of the village on the former hospital site. The new housing estate, completed in 2006, brought in new people and has transformed Harmston from an agricultural to a mainly commuter village for workers in nearby Lincoln.

==Community==
Harmston Anglican parish church is dedicated to All Saints. The village public house, The Thorold Arms, is situated close to the church.

<text>Georges Abrial (1898 in Paris – 1970 in Vauville, Manche) was an early French aerodynamicist.

==Life==
After graduating from the St Cyr Aeronautical Institute he worked for Levasseur (Levasseur-Abrial A-1) and did some pioneering work into tailless aircraft. He designed several gliders during the 1920s before turning to lecturing the following decade, when he also became influential in the French soaring movement.

Abrial stopped designing new aircraft after 1932 when he abandoned his A-12 project. He was more attracted by instructorship and educational methods and played an important role in the development of soaring in France during the 1930s. After World War II, he was still active in promoting soaring in France and in French Africa.

In 1954 he came back to the design of tailless aircraft, with the A-13 &quot;Buse&quot; project. But this glider was never built.

==Aircraft designs==
*Abrial A-2 Vautour (1925) Single-seat sailplane, 12.65 m wingspan
*Abrial A-3 Oricou (1927) Single-engine single-seat powered touring aircraft
*Abrial A-12 Bagoas (1931) Single-seat tailless sailplane of extremely low aspect ratio. 
*Abrial A-13 Buse (1954) Proposed single-seat sailplane. Not completed

First of all we just wanted to use the word &#x27;coma&#x27; but there was something missing so we played with the two words coma and lies.&quot; &quot;Comalies&quot; peaked at #178 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Peaked at #9 on the Top Heatseekers and Independent Albums charts. The outline of the shape from the cover of the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Unleashed Memories&quot; (2001) is faintly visible on top of the sunflower.

The song &quot;Swamped&quot; is available as a downloadable track for the music video game series &quot;Rock Band&quot;, and also appeared in the 2004 video game &quot;&quot;.

In 2022 for the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Lacuna Coil rerecorded &quot;Comalies&quot; in its entirety under the name &quot;Comalies XX&quot;. The album was released on October 14.

Santa Clara Law has a chapter of the Order of the Coif, a national law school honorary society founded for the purposes of encouraging legal scholarship and advancing the ethical standards of the legal profession.

==Campus==

Over the last century, the Santa Clara University campus, located along El Camino Real in Santa Clara, has expanded to more than . Amid its many Mission-style academic and residential buildings are the historic mission gardens, rose garden, and palm trees.

Until 1939, the law school inhabited present-day St. Joseph&#x27;s Hall at the center of campus. Under the tenure of Dean Edwin Owens, Bergin Hall was constructed and became home to the school in 1939. The new building was built using monies collected through Santa Clara football&#x27;s successful appearances in the Sugar Bowl and named after Thomas Bergin, Santa Clara&#x27;s first graduate, a California legal pioneer, and an early donor to the School of Law.

The Edwin Heafey Law Library was constructed in 1963, and expanded in 1973 to include more space for library materials. Heafey was renovated and expanded again in 1988. The collection contains over 400,000 volumes in print and digital formats. Additionally, the library manages an institutional repository which currently contains over 4,000 digital items including a collection of papers related to the Congressional hearings regarding the Watergate Scandal donated by Congressman Don Edwards. Other digital collections include documents relating to litigation over the Patient Protection and Affordable Healthcare Act (also known as Obamacare) and the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.

Also in 1973, Bannan Hall was built, including space for the Law School on the ground floor. In 2008 Dean Donald Polden announced the law school would have exclusive use of Bannan Hall, and the building was renovated and used exclusively by the law school shortly thereafter.

In 2018, the Law school moved into Charney Hall, a new $60-million building built specifically to house the Law school.

<text>Joseph Marie Henry Alfred Perrier de la Bâthie (11 August 1873 – 2 October 1958) was a French botanist who specialized in the plants of Madagascar.

He is the nephew of Eugène Pierre Perrier de la Bâthie, (1825-1916), another botanist, who also collected plants with him.

He delineated the two chief floristic provinces of Madagascar (&quot;see&quot; Ecoregions of Madagascar). Some of his works include &quot;La végétation malgache&quot; (1921), &quot;Biogéographie de plantes de Madagascar&quot; (1936), and numerous volumes of the series &quot;Flore de Madagascar et des Comores&quot; (1946-1952).

==Honours==
The orchid genus &quot;Neobathiea&quot; (originally &quot;Bathiea&quot;) was named in his honor, as was the indriid lemur Perrier&#x27;s sifaka (&quot;Propithecus perrieri&quot;). 
He has other plant genera named in his honour. Such as in 1905, botanist Lucien Désiré Joseph Courchet published &quot;Perriera&quot;, a genus of flowering plants from Madagascar, belonging to the family Simaroubaceae. Then in 1915, botanist Hochr. published &quot;Perrierophytum&quot;, a genus of flowering plants from Mozambique and Madagascar, belonging to the family Malvaceae. In 1924, A.Camus published &quot;Perrierbambus&quot;,a bamboo in the grass family. In 1951, Alberto Judice Leote Cavaco published &quot;Perrierodendron&quot; is a genus of trees and shrubs in the family Sarcolaenaceae. Then finally in 1978, (A.Berger) H.Ohba published &quot;Perrierosedum&quot;, succulent plants of the family Crassulaceae.

Several species of Madagascar plants were also named for him, including &quot;Adenia perrieri&quot;, &quot;Adansonia perrieri&quot; (or Perrier&#x27;s baobab), &quot;Erythrina perrieri&quot;, &quot;Ensete perrieri&quot;, &quot;Euphorbia perrieri&quot;, &quot;Gereaua perrieri&quot;, &quot;Jumelleanthus perrieri&quot; , &quot;Melanophylla perrieri&quot;, &quot;Podocarpus perrieri&quot;, &quot;Takhtajania perrieri&quot;, (originally named &quot;Bubbia perrieri&quot;) and &quot;Xerosicyos perrieri&quot;.

<text>Supaplex is a video game created by Philip Jespersen and Michael Stopp, two Swiss students, and published by Digital Integration in 1991. It is an extended clone of &quot;Boulder Dash&quot;.

==History==
Aiming to develop a version of &quot;Boulder Dash&quot; that could fit onto a floppy disk, the designers had a hard time developing better graphics under said constraint. The original Amiga Supaplex version had to fit on a standard 880 kB floppy disk and needed to run on a standard 512 kB Amiga like the original A500 or A2000. In fact, the Amiga version could not be copied onto the hard drive due to copy protection and its custom disk format.

The game was released for Amiga and MS-DOS. (Two people from the London area started developing a full version for the Atari ST, but it was never released, because of the limited graphical support.) Unofficial ports have been made to other platforms, such as the ZX Spectrum.

Due to hardware-dependent programming, the PC version of Supaplex ran twice as fast as PCs became faster. Herman Perk disassembled the game, debugged it and re-assembled it again. The result became known as &quot;SpeedFix&quot;. Extra features have also been added without changing the game itself.

The developers of the game have declared the software to be freeware.

Level editors and a Win32 clone called &quot;Megaplex&quot; were created.

==Gameplay==
The game comes with 111 levels, though many unofficial level sets have been released that greatly increase that number. Although the levels must be played in order, the game allows up to three levels to be skipped at any given time. Also, it was very easy to skip additional levels by editing the file that contained the list of levels successfully completed. The game is very challenging, but unlike many &quot;Boulder Dash&quot;-related games, the difficulty comes from solving the puzzles in each level rather than from semi-responsive controls. Furthermore, Supaplex does not use time limits for solving the puzzles, unlike &quot;Boulder Dash&quot;.

Most objects are identical in behaviour to those in the original &quot;Boulder Dash&quot;, simply redrawn with a computer hardware theme. &quot;Murphy&quot; replaces Rockford, who collects objects called &quot;Infotrons&quot;, which are reminiscent of schematic representations of atoms, instead of diamonds. Instead of dirt, the levels are filled with printed circuit board simply called &quot;base&quot; in the game&#x27;s manual, and not lined with brick walls, but with computer chips and other hardware, and filled with &quot;Zonks&quot; instead of rocks. The enemies are moving scissors, called &quot;Snik Snaks&quot;, and &quot;electrons&quot;, which resemble sparkling stars.

&quot;Supaplex&quot; introduces a number of new elements that were not present in &quot;Boulder Dash&quot;, including &quot;bugs&quot;, pieces of &quot;base&quot; that randomly cause life-threatening electrostatic discharges, &quot;Ports&quot;, which limit Murphy&#x27;s movement to specific directions, and &quot;terminals&quot;, which set off yellow &quot;Utility Disks&quot;. &quot;Utility Disks&quot; are explosive floppy disks and come in three different colors: &quot;Orange Disks&quot; work like Zonks, but explode when hit or when falling. &quot;Yellow Disks&quot; do not fall, yet may be pushed in any direction, but not pulled (which allows creating Sokoban-like puzzles), and explode when the &quot;Terminal&quot; is used. &quot;Red Disks&quot; can be carried and dropped when convenient, exploding seconds after.

&quot;Supaplex&quot; is the first &quot;Boulder Dash&quot;-like game that is not fully grid-based: while the playing field is an obvious grid, the objects do not &quot;snap&quot; from one grid position to another, but can be halfway or &quot;in between&quot; grid positions while moving or falling. This behavior has led to a number of well-known bugs that can be turned to the player&#x27;s advantage, many of which need to be exploited to complete fan-made levels. For instance, by turning around quickly, the player can cause an enemy or rock to &quot;bounce&quot; off Murphy.

The game also applies &quot;gravity&quot; on some levels, which means that Murphy will fall down empty spaces and will be unable to go back up, unless he climbs up by using bases. Gravity is not indicated visually the player can only notice by trial and error.

==Reception==
&quot;Supaplex&quot; received mostly favorable reviews. Comparing it to &quot;Boulder Dash&quot; and &quot;Emerald Mine&quot;, &quot;CU Amiga&quot; lauded the variety of the puzzles and the longevity of the gameplay, only lamenting the lack of a multiplayer mode and the need to restart difficult levels if the player makes a mistake. &quot;Amiga Action&quot; thought that it improved considerably on the game inspiring it, but expressed dissatisfaction with its graphics, and also felt that it was priced high since several public-domain &quot;Boulder Dash&quot; clones already existed. &quot;Zero&quot; praised the puzzle-oriented gameplay as addictive, with minor criticism directed at its stagnant graphics.

&quot;Amiga Format&quot; also found the game to be addictive, but was more forgiving of the graphics, calling them &quot;simplistic but effective&quot;. &quot;Amiga Computing&quot; considered &quot;Supaplex&quot; to be an average game. It described its gameplay as dated with new features &quot;to give it some welly&quot;, criticised its presentation for not providing context as to what the game is about, and felt that it should have been released as a budget title. In its negative review, &quot;Amiga Power&quot; criticised the length and difficulty of the levels and the game&#x27;s overall presentation, writing that there are superior &quot;Boulder Dash&quot; clones released to the public domain.

<text>The A-2 &quot;Vautour&quot; (&quot;Vulture&quot;) was a single-seat French glider that was designed by Georges Abrial. It performed well at the Vauville competition of 1925.

==Design==

The Vautour was designed by Georges Abrial of the &quot;Institut aérotechnique de Saint-Cyr&quot; and built by Louis Peyret. Each wing, joined to a centre-section on top of the fuselage with light dihedral, had a rectangular plan apart from an angled tip and carried a broad chord aileron which filled about 60% of the span. They were of mixed construction with two rectangular section dural spars and plywood ribs. Each wing was braced with a pair of parallel struts, dural tubes enclosed in streamlined, wooden fairings, between the lower fuselage longerons and the wing spars just inside the ailerons.

Its fuselage was rectangular in section, with spruce longerons and laminated wood frames. The sides were everywhere vertical but ahead of the wing it narrowed in plan and decreased in depth to a rounded nose. The downward sloping upper surface here was not flat but curved, formed from thin aluminium sheet. The pilot&#x27;s open cockpit was just in front of the leading edge, with a rubber-cord restrained canvas sheet between him and the aluminium surface, intended as protection in a crash. It contained some basic instrumentation, including an airspeed indicator and an altimeter, both with sensors well above the wing centre-section on a mast, as well as a compass.

The horizontal tail of the Vautour, mounted at mid-fuselage height, was similar in plan to the wing. The tailplane was much narrower than the one piece elevator. The fin was likewise narrower than the rudder and together had a rhomboidal profile, allowing elevator clearance below. Both surfaces were wood-framed and ply covered, with the exception of the fabric covered rudder.

Its landing gear was very simple, with wheels close to the sides on a split axle mounted within the fuselage. Rubber cord shock absorbers were used and the tailskid was also mounted elastically.

==Operational history==

The date of the first flight of the Vautour is not known but it made its first major public appearance in the meeting held at Vauville from 22 July to 11 August 1925. The competition included both gliders and low-powered aircraft. The Vautour, flown by Auger, gained the prize for greatest altitude above the starting point, reaching . It was placed second in a competition to fly the maximum number of laps, managing 36. It remained at Vauville after the contest and in February 1926 Auger returned to it with the intention of an attack on the altitude and distance records, as well as competing in several contests. By April the attempt had been abandoned due to unsuitable winds and the glider was dismantled and returned to Paris, with the hope of later using a site in Eure. There is no record that these attempts were made.

<text>The A-12 was an unusual tailless glider designed by Georges Abrial in the early 1930s. It was not a success and was abandoned in 1932.

==Design==

The Abrial A-12 was unusual in having a very low aspect ratio wing, even by the standards of its time. Other tailless gliders of the 1920s, notably the Lippisch Storch series had aspect ratios of about 8, compared with the 4.75 of the Abrial. Further, where the Storchs had swept wings the Abrial&#x27;s was rectangular in plan. After encouraging tests of models in the wind tunnel at St Cyr, Abrial built a full-sized version.

The Abrial&#x27;s wings had the designer&#x27;s own reflexed camber aerofoil. Such aerofoils are useful for tailless aircraft, because the pitching moment about the aerodynamic centre of the wing can be zero. The wings were mounted with strong dihedral and braced from above by a V-strut on each side, their apexes meeting at a faired triangular central support structure. It had control surfaces on the wings which may have operated as elevons and trapezoidal rudders mounted on triangular fins at the wing tips.

The pilot&#x27;s unenclosed seat was immediately in front of the central support structure, at the centre of the wing, with his feet on a rudder bar ahead of the leading edge. The Abrial landed on a skid, with little wheels under the wing tips.

Abrial named the A-12 Bagoas, after the Persian Vizier and poisoner. Its first flights were made during the first week of July 1932. It presented so many technical problems that he abandoned development later that year.

<text>The greater hoopoe-lark (Alaemon alaudipes) is a passerine bird which is a breeding resident of arid, desert and semi-desert regions from the Cape Verde Islands across much of northern Africa, through the Arabian Peninsula, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. It was formerly known as the bifasciated lark and sometimes as the large desert lark.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Formerly, the greater hoopoe-lark was classified as belonging to the genera &quot;Upupa&quot; and &quot;Certhilauda&quot; until moved to &quot;Alaemon&quot;. The name Alaemon comes from the Greek alēmōn, meaning &quot;wanderer&quot; (from alaomai, meaning &quot;to wander&quot;). The genus was established by Alexander Keyserling and Johann Heinrich Blasius in 1840.

===Subspecies===
Four subspecies are recognized:
* Cape Verde greater hoopoe-lark (&quot;A. a. boavistae&quot;) - : Found on the Cape Verde Islands
* North African greater hoopoe-lark (&quot;A. a. alaudipes&quot;) - : Found in northern Africa from southern Morocco and Mauritania to the Sinai Peninsula
* &quot;A. a. desertorum&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species in the genus &quot;Alauda&quot;. Found in north-eastern Sudan to northern Somalia, central Saudi Arabia to southern Yemen
* Eastern greater hoopoe-lark (&quot;A. a. doriae&quot;) - : Originally described as a separate species in the genus &quot;Certhilauda&quot;. Found in eastern Arabia to Iraq, Iran and north-western India

==Description==
This lark is large, long-legged and slender-bodied with a distinctive down-curved bill. The face has dark markings including a line through the eye and whisker like-lines from the base of bill running under the eye. The breast is spotted and the underside is buffy white while the upper-parts are sandy grey. The female is slightly smaller with less prominent markings and the bill is slightly shorter. The hind claw is short and straight. The curved upper beak has the nostril opening exposed. The tongue is bifid at the tip.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Birds are seen singly or in pairs as they forage by running or walking in spurts, probing and digging the ground. They have been recorded to feed on the fruiting bodies of certain fungi. The breeding season is mainly after the first rains, in India most records are from March to July. Late records in August when the rains were delayed have been noted in India. The courtship display of the male consists of rising with fluttering wing-strokes and then diving down with closed wings to a perch. The slow flappy start to the song flight recall a hoopoe for which this species is named. The striking wing pattern of black wing feathers with a white base and trailing edge; and a white tail with black outer feathers are displayed in flight. The male also sings with rising and falling notes consisting of trilled whistles and clicks that have been transcribed as a &quot;tee-tee-tee&quot; followed by a prolonged &quot;tee-hoo&quot; while nosediving. The typical call is a rolling &quot;zreee&quot; or &quot;too&quot;. The nest is a cup made up of small sticks and placed on a low bush or on the ground, sometimes at the base of a bush. The nest is prominent and often placed on an isolated bush. Two or three eggs are laid and both sexes take turns in incubation. They feed on insects and other invertebrates, small lizards and seeds. Young birds are capable of swift running even before they can fly. The female may perform distraction displays when the young or nest are threatened.

During the heat of the day, they may shelter in the burrows of &quot;Uromastyx&quot; lizards. The water loss through their skin varies with temperature and they are able to live in very arid conditions. Their breeding is dependent on the rains and in very dry years they may not breed.

==Distribution and populations==
The wide distribution consists of several populations that have been designated as subspecies. These include &quot;boavistae&quot; of the Cape Verde Islands, the nominate &quot;alaudipes&quot; of the north African Sahara region and northern Arabia. Subspecies &quot;desertorum&quot; has been assigned to the populations along the Red Sea coast while the eastern population of Iraq, Pakistan and north-western India are assigned to &quot;doriae&quot;. Forms like &quot;pallida&quot; and variety &quot;cinerea&quot; are included in &quot;doriae&quot;.

<doc id="1054148" wikidata="Q3401329" url="?curid=1054148" title="Act of Supremacy 1558">
<text>The Act of Supremacy 1558 (1 Eliz. 1. c. 1), sometimes referred to as the Act of Supremacy 1559, is an act of the Parliament of England, which replaced the original Act of Supremacy 1534, and passed under the auspices of Elizabeth I. The 1534 act was issued by Elizabeth&#x27;s father, Henry VIII, which arrogated authority to the monarchy, but which had been repealed by Mary I. Along with the Act of Uniformity 1558, the act made up what is generally referred to as the Elizabethan Religious Settlement.

The act remained in place until the 19th century, when some sections began to be repealed. By 1969, all provisions, bar section 8 (which still remains in force), had been repealed by various acts, with the whole act repealed in Northern Ireland between 1950 and 1953.

==The act==
The act revived ten Acts which Mary I had revoked, significantly clarified and narrowed the definition of what constituted heresy, and confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Compared to Henry VIII&#x27;s title of &quot;Supreme Head&quot;, Supreme Governor avoided the blasphemous implication that Elizabeth was superior in rank to Jesus, whom the Epistle to the Ephesians identifies as head of the church.

The act also made it a crime to assert the authority of any foreign prince, prelate, or other authority, and was aimed at abolishing the authority of the Pope in England. A third offence was high treason, punishable by death.

=== The oath===

The Oath of Supremacy, imposed by the act, provided for any person taking public or church office in England to swear allegiance to the monarch as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Failure to so swear was a crime, although it did not become treason until 1562, when the (5 Eliz. 1. c. 1) made refusal to take the oath a treasonable offence. The oath was later extended to include Members of Parliament and those studying at universities: all but one of the bishops lost their posts and a hundred fellows of Oxford colleges were deprived, as many dignitaries resigned rather than take the oath. The bishops who were removed from the ecclesiastical bench were replaced by appointees who would agree to the reforms.

Text of the oath as published in 1559:

This had a specific impact on English Roman Catholics since it expressly indicates that they must forswear allegiance to Roman Catholicism, inasmuch as the Church of Rome was directly a foreign jurisdiction, power, superiority and authority. However, during the early years of her reign Elizabeth practised religious clemency and tolerance, which was an attempt to harmonise the state of affairs between the Roman Catholics and the Church of England. This was necessary for Elizabeth to establish her power fully, hold off threats of invasion from France and Spain, and to counter accusations of illegitimacy that plagued her early years. In the last twenty years of her reign, as the Pope issued official encouragement to topple, and even kill, Elizabeth, as Jesuits infiltrated England, and as the threat of Spanish invasion loomed, Catholics became targets for oppression. Later, Roman Catholic power within England waned (because Roman Catholics were forbidden to take public office and were slowly deprived of their lands and fortunes) but their influence grew until they attempted the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 – whereupon they were oppressed for nearly 200 years.

=== Text in force today ===
Section 8 still remains in force in Great Britain, and reads as follows:

The words at the end were repealed in 1641 by the Abolition of High Commission Court Act 1640 (16 Cha. 1. c. 11).

==Related legislation==

An act to the same effect was passed in Ireland in the following year, the Act of Supremacy (Ireland) 1560 (2 Eliz. 1. c. 1 (I)).

The Papal Jurisdiction Act 1560 (c. 2 (S)) remains in force in Scotland.

Another act, the (1 Eliz. 1. c. 5), made it treason to &quot;compass&quot; or &quot;imagine&quot; to deprive the Queen (or her heirs) of the Crown, or destroy her or her heirs, or levy war against them in their dominions, or depose them, or say that they are not or ought not to be the monarch.

Another act, the Seditious Words Act 1558 (1 Eliz. 1. c. 6), dealt with sedition.

<doc id="1054152" wikidata="Q710805" url="?curid=1054152" title="Kim Pyong Il">
<text>Kim Pyong Il (, ; born 10 August 1954) is the younger paternal half-brother of the former leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Il, and the only surviving son of former leader and president of North Korea Kim Il Sung. He worked as a diplomat and lived overseas between 1979 and 2019, serving in various diplomatic positions such as ambassador of North Korea to Hungary, Bulgaria, Finland, Poland, and the Czech Republic.

==Family background and early life==
Kim is the son of Kim Il Sung and Kim Song-ae, Kim Il Sung&#x27;s former secretary. Kim had one younger brother, Yong-il, and one older half-sister, Kyong-hui, who would go on to marry senior official Chang Sung-taek. He was named after another son with the same name, who was born in Vyatskoye in 1944; that son, also known as Shura Kim, allegedly drowned in Pyongyang in 1947. He graduated from Kim Il Sung University with a major in economics, and later attended the Kim Il Sung Military University, following which he was appointed a battalion commander.

Kim Pyong Il&#x27;s rivalry with half-brother Kim Jong Il goes back to the 1970s. In those days, Kim Pyong Il was known as a womaniser who threw raucous parties; sometimes, attendees at these parties would shout, &quot;Long live Kim Pyong Il!&quot;. Kim Jong Il knew that this could be portrayed as a threat to the cult of personality surrounding their father Kim Il Sung, and reported the matter; Kim Il Sung was reportedly infuriated, and thus Kim Pyong Il fell out of favour with his father while Kim Jong Il strengthened his position.

Kim Pyong Il married Kim Sun-kum, a woman with family connections to the Ministry of Public Security, in 1982. They have a son, Kim In-kang, and a daughter, Kim Ung-song.

==Diplomatic career==
In 1979, Kim began a series of diplomatic postings to several countries in Europe so that he could not influence politics in his home country. His first overseas assignment was in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He was promoted to the position of ambassador to the People&#x27;s Republic of Hungary in 1988, but was transferred to the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria in response to Hungary&#x27;s opening of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1989. This was followed by a posting in Finland.

In 1998, after North Korea closed its embassy in Finland to save money and prevent defections, Kim was posted to Poland. His ambassadorship was initially suggested to be in limbo, as nine months after his posting he had yet to formally present his credentials to the Polish president. However, he remained as ambassador in Poland, and his daughter Kim Eun-song and son Kim In-kang went on to attend university in Poland. He was a rare sight in Warsaw&#x27;s diplomatic community, only occasionally appearing at functions held by the Algerian, Russian and Syrian embassies.

In 2015, he was transferred to the Czech Republic. He later returned to North Korea in November 2019 after stepping down as North Korea&#x27;s ambassador to the Czech Republic. In January 2020, Ju Won Chol, a former Director General of the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Second European Department, replaced Kim as North Korea&#x27;s Czech Republic ambassador.

==Relations with Pyongyang==
Kim Pyong Il reportedly continued to be considered a threat to the North Korean government due to his resemblance to his father Kim Il Sung. Reports claim he is under watch by both North and South Korean intelligence. However, he has kept a low profile, in contrast to his half-nephew Kim Jong-nam who gave frequent interviews with Japanese media, before he was assassinated in Kuala Lumpur in 2017.

In July 2011, Kim was reported by South Korean media to be back in Pyongyang for a visit. Some sources claimed he was under house arrest there since May, though others speculated he was just visiting his dying mother Kim Song-ae or preparing to observe the anniversary of his father&#x27;s death.

In December 2011, South Korean officials said Kim Pyong Il was in Poland and would not attend Kim Jong Il&#x27;s funeral. Kim Pyong Il and Kim Song-ae attended the funeral of Kim Il Sung in 1994, but North Korean television broadcasts deleted their images.

In June 2019, Kim Pyong Il visited North Korea for reported medical reasons. In November 2019, Kim Pyong Il returned to North Korea after retiring from a long career as a foreign diplomat. He had not lived in either Pyongyang or the rest of his native country since 1979. As a result, his return to North Korea following his retirement as a foreign diplomat also marked his return to being a North Korean resident for the first time in 40 years.

<text>Knut Johan Ångström (12 January 18574 March 1910) was a Swedish physicist. He was the son of physicist Anders Jonas Ångström and studied in Uppsala from 1877 to 1884, when he received his &quot;licentiat&quot;-degree, before going for a short time to the University of Strassburg (Strasbourg) to study with August Kundt. Coming back to Uppsala, he completed his doctoral degree and was appointed lecturer in physics at the new university college in Stockholm (now Stockholm University) in 1885. After a few years working there, he returned to Uppsala in 1891 and received the professorship of Physics in 1896.

He focused his research work on investigating the radiation of heat from the sun, terrestrial nocturnal emission and its absorption by the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and to that end devised various delicate methods and instruments, including his electric compensation pyrheliometer, invented in 1893, apparatus for obtaining a photographic representation of the infra-red spectrum (1895) and pyrgeometer (abt. 1905).

In 1900, Herr J. Koch, laboratory assistant to Knut Ångström, did not observe any appreciable change in the absorption of infrared radiation by decreasing the concentration of up to a third of the initial amount. This result, in addition to the observation made a couple of years before that the superposition of the water vapour absorption bands, more abundant in the atmosphere, over those of CO2, convinced some geologists for a time that calculations by Svante Arrhenius for warming were wrong; though subsequent work in following decades eventually vindicated Arrhenius.

The experiment, however, was careless seen from the current perspective with erroneous result but of a historical significance in the development of the theory of the greenhouse effect amplified by CO2.

He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1893.

<doc id="1054174" wikidata="Q3275566" url="?curid=1054174" title="Volvo Super Olympian">
<text>The Volvo Super Olympian was a low-floor double-decker bus manufactured by Volvo. It replaced the 3-axle version of Volvo Olympian. The chassis had the designated manufacturer code B10TL.

==History==
The Volvo Super Olympian was unveiled in 1998, with one chassis being sent to Hong Kong for a motor show held by International Union of Public Transport in the same year. The chassis was later returned to the United Kingdom.

==Chassis design==
The Super Olympian chassis was based on the Volvo Olympian. The front radiator was moved behind the front axle on the 12 metre version, or in front of the second axle for the 10.6 metre version (due to its shorter wheelbase). In order to lower the chassis further, the assisted steering function of the middle axle was cancelled. The suspension system has also been largely modified so that it is electronically controlled instead of moving passively. One special feature is that after turning, the suspension unit does not return to normal, remaining tilted to either the left or right, until the bus becomes stationary.

An option for 11.3 metre length of Super Olympian was also available, but no orders were received. The Super Olympian was powered by the Volvo D10A285 (Euro II or Euro III), with a maximum power of . Its somewhat insufficient engine power has earned some mildly derisive nicknames in Hong Kong. The most common are &quot;豬&quot; (pig), &quot;扒&quot; (meat cutlet) and &quot;豬扒&quot; (pork chop, derived from the pronunciation of the word &quot;Super&quot;).

Initially, the Super Olympian chassis were built in Volvo&#x27;s factory in Irvine, Scotland. After the closure of the factory in mid-2000, production was moved to Wrocław, Poland.

==Hong Kong==


===Kowloon Motor Bus===

====12m version====
Kowloon Motor Bus ordered the first batch of 61 (3ASV1-61) Alexander ALX500-bodied B10TL Super Olympians with ZF 4HP590 transmission, and roller shuttle route displays in 1998. These entered service in 1998/99. All except the prototype 3ASV3 had narrow 2+2 seats on the upper deck. All Super Olympians with plastic signs were retired in November 2017.

A further 80 Super Olympians (3ASV62-141) entered service in 2000/01. These buses have electronic route displays and ZF 5HP590 transmission. 3ASV78 was the 3,000th Alexander bodied bus supplied to KMB, and 3ASV141 was the first KMB bus to meet Euro III emission standards.

The last 351 Super Olympians (3ASV142-492), including 21 which were fitted with Australian Volgren CR223LD bodywork, entered service in 2001/02. All of these buses had their chassis built in Poland. Their D10A285 engines were built to meet Euro III emission standards and had aluminium alloy front wheels supplied by Alcoa. 3ASV297 was coated with special metallic paint, which shows different colours (mainly green and purple), depending on the angle of light reflection. The last Volgren-bodied Super Olympian (3ASV474) was retired on 11 November 2020, while the last Alexander ALX500-bodied Super Olympian (3ASV492) was retired on 19 December 2020.

====10.6m version====
Kowloon Motor Bus was the only operator of 10.6 metre Super Olympians. The first 49 (ASV1-49) 10.6m Alexander ALX500 bodied Super Olympians were introduced in 2001. They are equipped with D10A285 Euro II engines and had Alcoa front wheels.

ASV50, which was put into service in 2002, is a prototype short-wheelbase Super Olympian (chassis built in 1999), and also the only short-wheelbase Super Olympian built in Scotland. It is equipped with a Euro II D10A285 engine and ZF 4HP590 transmission rather than the previous 5HP590 as fitted to older ASVs.

ASV51-100 were also equipped with the Euro III D10A285 engines. They are almost identical with ASV1-49, except for minor interior differences. Only the first 24 were put into service in 2003. The remaining 26 were stored for more than a year due to SARS, and the 26 were put into service between September 2004 and March 2005.

The last 10.6 metre Super Olympian and Alexander ALX500 (ASV100) was retired on 8 March 2023, which is these buses were de-registered.

====12m wider version====
In January 2003, Kowloon Motor Bus received the first Wright-bodied Super Olympian with a 2.55 metre-wide body (once known as the &quot;Wright Explorer&quot;). Like the Alexander Dennis Enviro500, it featured a straight staircase and plug exit door. It was numbered AVW1 and was registered on 20 March 2003.

The next 49 buses (AVW2-50) with a slightly different design followed shortly after AVW1, they entered service in 2003/2004. The last 50 buses (AVW51-100), which are almost identical, entered service in 2004/2005, These were the last batch of Volvo Super Olympian ordered by KMB. The last Super Olympian (AVW92) was retired on 31 July 2023, which is buses were de-registered.

===New World First Bus===

New World First Bus bought 103 Super Olympians in five batches, all are 12 metres long and were fitted with Alexander ALX500 bodies.

The first 40 (5001-5040), fitted with electronic route displays, were introduced in 1999. The next 20 (5041-5060), with their side route number boxes moved to a lower position, entered service in 2000/01. The chassis of 5060 was the first to be built in Poland. New World First Bus began de-registering the buses on 21 November 2017.

The next 19 Super Olympians (5061-5079), with Euro III D10A285 engines and Alcoa front wheels, entered service in 2001. To mark the occasion of meeting the Euro III emission standard, New World First Bus designed a full body advertisement for one of them (fleet number 5070) to state that they were environmentally friendly. They were followed by 10 similar examples (5080-5089) later that year. Among these buses, 5080-5086 had their registration numbers originated from ex China Motor Bus buses and service cars.

The last batch of 14 Super Olympians (5090-5103), entered service in 2002, had their rear electronic route number displays raised above the emergency window to form a box, the design being unique among all similar vehicles in Hong Kong. These were all withdrawn and were either sold to Citybus, converted to a training bus or headed to the scrapyard.

The last three buses in the fleet (5072, 5076, 5079) had been retired on 27 August 2019. These were the last buses to have no headrest in franchised service.

==Singapore==

In late 1999, Volvo delivered one Volgren CR222LD-bodied Super Olympian to the then Singapore Bus Services for trial purposes. Registered as SBS9888Y, it was Singapore&#x27;s first low floor &quot;Superbus&quot;, and had advanced specifications at time of introduction. Originally deployed on routes serving the then new Sengkang New Town, it was transferred to Ang Mo Kio bus depot in 2004. This bus was destroyed in the Ang Mo Kio bus depot fire of 2010, and was subsequently written off.

Satisfied with the trial, SBS purchased 51 Volvo Super Olympians in 2000. These buses were the last to be ordered by SBS prior to their rebranding to SBS Transit. 50 were bodied with an updated Volgren CR222LD bodywork, with one entering service in April 2002 and the remaining buses entering service in early 2003. They were also the first buses to be registered with the new SBS Transit livery. One bus was built completely by Volgren in Australia, and hence equipped with a Transit Media electronic destination signage (EDS). The rest, which were assembled locally, debuted with plastic destination signages initially and were retrofitted with LECIP electronic destination displays in 2012. All buses of this batch had served out of Ang Mo Kio, Toa Payoh and Bedok North depots throughout their lifespan. While most units have since been scrapped between April and June 2020, two units are currently preserved. One unit has been exported to Hong Kong for preservation, while the other unit is currently preserved and repurposed at a special education school in Singapore.

In early 2005, the last Volvo Super Olympian, debuted with a prototype ComfortDelGro Engineering (CDGE) bodywork, which later form the basis of the subsequent first batch of Volvo B9TLs debuting in the following year. Originally deployed to Bukit Batok Depot (BBDEP), it was transferred to Braddell Bus Park (BRBP) in 2012, where it was refurbished with yellow seats and its original Transit Media EDS replaced with a LECIP EDS. It is also the last non-wheelchair accessible bus in Singapore. It was taken out of revenue service at the end of 2020; De-registered and scrapped together with 33 Volvo B9TL ComfortDelGro Engineering (CDGE) double deckers between April and June 2021 due to poor quality and performance.

==Replacement==
Production of the Volvo Super Olympian ended in 2004 and 2005 after completion of the last order from Kowloon Motor Bus and SBS Transit. Its successor was the Volvo B9TL.

<doc id="1054175" wikidata="Q1127771" url="?curid=1054175" title="Mount Ida (Turkey)">
<text>Mount Ida (, pronounced , meaning &quot;Goose Mountain&quot;, &quot;Kaz Dağları,&quot; or &quot;Karataş Tepesi,&quot; Greek: Ίδα&quot;)&quot; is a mountain in northwestern Turkey, some southeast of the ruins of Troy, along the north coast of the Edremit Gulf. It is between Balıkesir Province and Çanakkale Province.

==Geography==
Mount Ida is a lightly populated upland massif of about 700 km2 located to the north of Edremit. A number of small villages in the region are connected by paths. Drainage is mainly to the south, into the , also known as Edremit Bay, where the coast is rugged and is known as &quot;the Olive Riviera.&quot; However, the Karamenderes River (the ancient Scamander) flows from the other side of Mount Ida to the west. Its valley under Kaz Dağları has been called &quot;the Vale of Troy&quot; by English speakers.
Currently a modest 2.4 km2 of Mount Ida are protected by Kaz Dağı National Park, created in 1993.

The summit is windswept and bare with a relatively low tree line due to exposure, but the slopes of this mountain, at the edge of mild Mediterranean and colder central Anatolian climate zones, hold a wealth of endemic flora, marooned here after the Ice Age. The climate at lower altitudes has become increasingly hot and dry in the deforested landscape. The dry period lasts from May to October. Rainfall averages between 631 and 733 mm per year. The mean annual temperature is 15.7 degrees Celsius, with diurnal temperatures as high as 43.7 degrees Celsius in Edremit. 
The forests on the upper slopes consist mainly of Trojan fir (&quot;Abies nordmanniana&quot; subsp. &quot;equi-trojani&quot;; considered by some botanists to be a distinct species &quot;Abies equi-trojani&quot;). Deer, wild boar and jackal are common at the area. Wolves, lynx, brown bears and big cats once roamed there, but now disappeared from the mountains due to overhunting.

==Legend==

===Cultic significance===

====Cybele====
In ancient times of the Greeks, the mountain was dedicated to the worship of Cybele. The Romans gave this goddess the epithet &quot;Magna Mater&quot; (&quot;Great Mother&quot;), or &quot;Magna Mater deorum Idaea&quot; (&quot;great Idaean mother of the gods&quot;).

====Sibylline books====
The oldest collection of Sibylline utterances, the Sibylline Books, appears to have been made about the time of Cyrus at Gergis on Mount Ida; it was attributed to the Hellespontine Sibyl and was preserved in the temple of Apollo at Gergis. From Gergis the collection passed to Erythrae, where it became famous as the oracles of the Erythraean Sibyl. It seems to have been this very collection, or so it would appear, which found its way to Cumae (see the Cumaean Sibyl) and from Cumae to Rome.

===Mythology===
Mount Ida owes much of its fame to the work of the poet Homer, gaining renown from having been mentioned in his epic poem the &quot;Iliad&quot;. It is the setting for
numerous episodes in Ancient Greek myth. For example, in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Mount Ida plays an essential role for the lives of Trojans in the city of Troy. Part of Troy&#x27;s water source came from the rivers along Mount Ida, while the city uses the mountain to collect wood as well. Trojans also used the peaks on Mount Ida for religious purposes, while in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Zeus stayed on the peak at Gargarus on Mount Ida for a period of time in the poem.

====Idaea====
Idaea was a nymph, mate of the river god Scamander, and mother of King Teucer the Trojan king. The Scamander River flowed from Mount Ida across the plain beneath the city of Troy, and joined the Hellespont north of the city.

====Ganymede====
At an earlier time, on Mount Ida, Ganymede, the son of Tros or perhaps of Laomedon, both kings of Troy, was desired by Zeus, who descended in the form of an eagle and swept up Ganymede, to be cupbearer to the Olympian gods.

====Hermaphroditus====
In The Metamorphoses, Ovid writes that Hermaphroditus, the child of Hermes and Aphrodite, was taken after birth to be raised for fifteen years by the Naids of Mount Ida.

====Paris====
On the sacred mountain, the nymphs who were the daughter-spirits of the river Cebrenus, had their haunt, and one, Oenone, who had the chthonic gifts of prophetic vision and the curative powers of herb magic, wed Paris, living as a shepherd on Mount Ida. Unbeknownst to all, even to himself, Paris was the son of Priam, king of Troy. He was there on Mount Ida, experiencing the rustic education in exile of many heroes of Greek mythology, for his disastrous future effect on Troy was foretold at his birth, and Priam had him exposed on the sacred slopes. When the good shepherd who was entrusted with the baby returned to bury the exposed child, he discovered that he had been suckled by a she-bear (a totem animal of the archaic goddess Artemis) and took the child home to be foster-nursed by his wife.

When Eris (&quot;discord&quot;) cast the Apple of Discord, inscribed &quot;for the fairest&quot;, into the wedding festivities of Peleus with Thetis, three great goddesses repaired to Mount Ida to be appraised. By a sacred spring on the mountainside, in &quot;the Judgment of Paris&quot;, the grown youth Paris awarded it to Aphrodite, who offered Helen for a bribe, earning the perpetual enmity of the discredited goddesses Hera and Athena to the Trojan cause (&quot;Bibliotheca&quot; 3.12.5).

====Anchises====
Anchises, father of Aeneas, also of the Trojan royal house, was tending sheep on Mount Ida when he was seduced by Aphrodite. Their union led to the birth of Aeneas, the mythological progenitor of Rome&#x27;s Julio-Claudian dynasty and a founder of Rome.

====Trojan War====
The mountain is the scene of several mythic events in the works of Homer. At its summit, the Olympian gods gathered to watch the progress of the epic fight. But the mountain was the sacred place of the Goddess, and Hera&#x27;s powers were so magnified on Mount Ida, that she was able to distract Zeus with her seductions, just long enough to permit Poseidon to intercede on behalf of the Argives to drive Hektor and the Trojans back from the ships.

During the Trojan War, in an episode recorded in &quot;Epitome&quot; of the fourth book of the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, Achilles with some of the Achaean chiefs laid waste the countryside, and made his way to Ida to rustle the cattle of Aeneas. But Aeneas fled, and Achilles killed the cowherds and Mestor, son of Priam, and drove away the sacred kine (&quot;Epitome&quot; 3.32). Achilles briefly refers to this incident as he prepares to duel with Aeneas during the siege of Troy. (&quot;Iliad&quot; XX)

After the Trojan War, the only surviving son of Priam, Helenus, retired to Mount Ida, where he was surprised and became the captive of Neoptolemus. In the &quot;Aeneid&quot; a shooting star falls onto the mountain in answer to the prayer of Anchises to Jupiter.

==History==

===Bronze age===

In the Bronze Age, the region around the mountain complex had a somewhat chequered ethnography. There is evidence for the following peoples with a reasonable degree of probability:
* The Tjeker in Ayvacık, Çanakkale Province, which the Greeks called the Teucri. They were probably from Crete and are most likely to have been the source of the name, Mount Ida, which they took from Mount Ida, Crete.

===Iron age===

In historical times, Xerxes&#x27; march took him past Mount Ida (Herodotus VII:42).

== 2019 Controversy ==
In July 2019, protesters made accusations against Canadian company Alamos Gold for constructing a mine in Mount Ida, despite the fact that the mine was located 40 km away from Mount Ida, within the borders of the Biga Mountains and in the skirts of Balaban Hill. The Republic of Turkey prohibits mining in National Parks, Natural Preserves, Archeological Sites and Wildlife Protection Areas. Protesters criticized that thousands of trees were cleared as well as plans to use cyanide to extract gold. The Turkish government and company responded with claims that the mine would not damage the environment. Protesters began a &quot;Water and Conscience Watch&quot; on July 26. A &quot;Great Water and Conscience Meeting&quot; was then held on August 5, during which protesters entered the mining site and symbolically planted trees in front of the press. Local residents near the village of Kirazlı criticized the protesters who came to the region with misinformation. Images of the land which had been cleared of trees also caused outrage on social media. Artist Zülfü Livaneli wrote an open letter to UNESCO protesting about the destruction of the natural environment in the area. In 2021, the mining company filed an investment treaty claim exceeding $1 billion against Turkey for &quot;unfair and inequitable treatment&quot;.

<text>Varginha is a municipality in southwest Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Varginha stands out as one of the major centers of commerce and coffee production in Brazil and the world. The city is a center for export of coffee draining most of the production of the south of Minas Gerais, making the grain trade with several countries. The city is equidistant from the three largest metropolitan areas in Brazil (Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo). The city is close to Rodovia Fernão Dias. The city is served by Maj. Brig. Trompowsky Airport .

Varginha achieved moderate fame in UFO circles due to the so-called Varginha UFO incident in 1996, in which two extraterrestrial beings were allegedly spotted by locals and later captured by the Brazilian Army, along with the local police and fire department. After this episode, the city began to invest in &quot;UFO tourism&quot;. Today there are bus stops with the shape of spaceships and a water tower downtown also in the shape of a spaceship. In August 2004, UFO researchers from all over Brazil came together at the UFO Congress of Varginha, organized with the support of the City Hall.

== Geography ==

According to the modern (2017) geographic classification by Brazil&#x27;s National Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the city is the main municipality in the Intermediate Geographic Region of Varginha.

==History==

The colonization of southern Minas Gerais began in the 17th century, when the region still belonged to the Captaincy of São Paulo.

The bandeirantes coming from São Paulo via the Paraíba Valley crossed the Mantiqueira mountain range in the region of the Embaú gorge, today&#x27;s Passa Quatro. Among the São Paulo bandeirantes, the first and foremost was Fernão Dias Pais Leme, who explored the region and headed north into the backlands in search of the indigenous legend of Sabarabuçu. The bandeirantes, who were in search of precious stones and gold regions, passed through the region along the banks of the Rio Verde and Rio Grande, making one of their first points of support near the present-day town of Baependi.

Many São Paulo traders (tropeiros) also passed through the region frequently, selling products from São Paulo and Portugal. These traders traveled in troops and slept in huts built every six leagues. The current Vargem neighborhood was one of these resting places.

The first known documents about the history of Varginha date back to 1780.

The muleteers, who were passing through Varginha on a regular basis, built a small chapel in 1785, close to where the Divine Holy Spirit parish church now stands. In 1806, the chapel of the Divine Holy Spirit of Catanduvas was built and, in the same year, the land required for the district estate was donated. The town was then given the name of Catanduvas or Catandubas; a word originally from the Tupi language, meaning &quot;undergrowth, closed, rough and thorny, of small size&quot;. Because of the chapel&#x27;s patron saint, it was renamed Espírito Santo das Catanduvas.

With the expansion of coffee-growing around 1870 in the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the southern region of Minas Gerais also began growing coffee on its farms, which was highly profitable and made many of the region&#x27;s producers rich.

In order to meet the need for an alternative labor force to slavery, since there were no more slaves due to the abolition of slavery, the Brazilian government made an agreement with Italy, in which many Italians came to Brazil with their expenses paid by the Brazilian government; in return, the Italians had to work for a certain period of time in coffee production, receiving a certain percentage of the production.

Varginha was one of the municipalities that received the most Italian immigrants in Brazil during this period. With enormous commitment and hard work, many Italians went on to buy their own land and start their own businesses, which generated great economic development for Varginha and the south of Minas Gerais at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.

The Italians spread trade and founded the wheat mill, now Moinho Sul Mineiro, in partnership with Varginhenses of the time. The construction of the Theatro Capitólio, which follows the Tolentino style and whose decoration is attributed to the Italian Alexandre Vallati, is also attributed to the Italian colony.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the small town of Varginha already had many coffee processing establishments. The product has always been an important factor in the region&#x27;s development, mainly due to the strong influence of São Paulo in the area.

Another considerable influx was that of Syrian-Lebanese immigrants in the early decades of the 20th century, most of whom made their living in the produce trade in São Paulo.

During the Second World War, Varginha sent reinforcements to join the Brazilian troops fighting in Italy. This was an unusual move by the Brazilian government, since many of the soldiers known as &quot;pracinhas&quot;, who left Varginha and other regions of Brazil, had direct relatives such as uncles and grandparents in the country to which they were sent to fight.

In the 1970s, Varginha also received several Japanese families, who immigrated as a result of the Japanese acquisition of a German company at the time, CBC, which had a factory in the city.

Nowadays, due to the transfer of Taiwanese companies to the region, the city hosts Taiwanese immigrants, who invest, create jobs and work in Varginha.

==Economy==

Varginha is a major regional hub for services and industries. Several factories are established in the city such as Philips-Walita, Inovacon, Plascar, Cooper-Standard, SteamMaster and Samsung. There are also a large number of small enterprises in the industrial sector with regional success. It is also one of the biggest producers of coffee in the world.

The city&#x27;s main economy sectors are agriculture (especially coffee), engineering, steel, car parts and metal-mechanics.

Varginha has the biggest GDP in the southern region of Minas Gerais, a prosperous area with a high HDI and close to big economy centers in the state of São Paulo. The city was ranked 7th by Veja Magazine for the Top 20 mid-size cities to invest and live in Brazil.
Opened in 2012, the CIT-Centro Industrial Tecnológico (&quot;portuguese for Industrial and technological center&quot;) is a new industrial complex in the city&#x27;s airport area and its home for the Porto Seco Sul de Minas (South Minas Dry Port), an imports/exports company for the city&#x27;s coffee industry.

Its location is considered one of the best for the logistics and transportation industries, close to Brazil&#x27;s biggest economy centers.

<text>Janet Frances Powell (née McDonald, 29 September 194230 September 2013) was an Australian politician.

==Early life and career==
A native of Nhill, Victoria, Powell was educated at Ballarat Grammar School and Nhill High School. She graduated from the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma of Education. She then worked as a secondary school teacher at Kerang High School and Nhill High School.

==Political career==
Powell was active in the Australian Democrats in the 1980s, serving as the party&#x27;s Victorian state president (1983–85) and a national deputy president (1984–86). In 1986, she was appointed a Democrat senator for Victoria, upon the resignation of the party&#x27;s founder, Don Chipp. She was elected the following year. Following the announcement of the 1987 Senate election results, Powell was one of four senators who received a six-year term as a consequence of which method was chosen to allocate the seats.

She became the third elected leader of the party, from 1 July 1990 to 19 August 1991, when she was deposed in a coup promoted by the party&#x27;s Queensland division with national executive support. The charge that she had &quot;failed to lift the profile of the party&quot; during her tenure of a year was unsuccessful as justification, and her openly acknowledged relationship with party colleague Sid Spindler was used as leverage to remove her from the leadership. The party&#x27;s founding leader, Don Chipp, described the coup as the &quot;most tragic story to have hit the Democrats&quot;. One suggested reason for the coup was that she was controversially negotiating a coalition or merger with the Greens. After internal disagreements related to her loss of the leadership, she resigned from the party in 1992 and continued as an independent senator until her defeat at the 1993 election. After quitting the Democrats, she reminded the Senate of her non-partisan approach in pursuit of reforms, including a successful private senator&#x27;s bill:&quot;In the six years that I have been in this place I have valued most highly the cooperative work that I have been able to do with colleagues on all sides of the chamber...for example, I reflect on the magnificent work done by former Senator Peter Baume which played a large part in enabling the passage, unopposed, through the Parliament of my private member&#x27;s Bill which banned the print advertising of tobacco products. On the other side, I look forward to a successful result on the question of discrimination against homosexuals in the armed forces as a result of important strategic cooperation between myself, Senator Margaret Reynolds and other Labor Party backbenchers.&quot;

In 1996, she campaigned for Greens leader Bob Brown and, in 2004, she joined the Australian Greens, citing that they were more capable of achieving the function of a third force in Australian politics. In the 2006 Victorian state election she unsuccessfully stood for the Greens in the Eastern Metropolitan Region.

==Community service==
Janet Powell was a member of the Patrons Council of the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria, a Life Member of YWCA Victoria, and also an inaugural appointee to the Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2000 &quot;for services to the community&quot;.

In the 2012 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours list, she was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia, in recognition of her service to the Parliament and people of Australia, &quot;particularly through leadership of YWCA Victoria&quot;.

<text>John Richard Coulter (3 December 1930 – 6 September 2024) was an Australian medical researcher and politician. He was the fourth elected parliamentary Senate leader of the Australian Democrats, serving from 2 October 1991 to 29 April 1993. 

In his first speech, he criticised the failure of presently used economic indexes to measure the right things, such as the inclusion of costs as benefits in the measurement of GDP, and the absence of a national capital account giving a misleading impression of becoming richer by squandering natural capital and turning it into cash, which is then frittered away without turning it back into capital. He argued that correcting these misleading indices would reveal the paths toward ecological sustainability and a more humane society.

In his valedictory speech, he took up the case that economic growth is not sustainable and that ‘economic rationalism’ (neo-classical economics) is an ideology blind to empirical evidence.

His understanding of conservation and environment principles was exceptional for the time. One of Dr. Coulter&#x27;s controversial concerns was the social and economic impact of population growth.

Coulter was born in Perth, Western Australia. He gained a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery degree at the University of Adelaide. He became a medical practitioner and researcher, and was also a university lecturer.

He was a member of Campbelltown Council in Adelaide during 1973–74. In 1980 he joined the Democrats.

He first took office in the Senate in 1987, representing South Australia, and resigned from the Senate on 20 November 1995, due to ill health. Natasha Stott Despoja was appointed his replacement three days later, having earlier been employed by him as a researcher.

In 1999, he was publicly critical of Meg Lees&#x27;s leadership of the Democrats, especially of her handling of the Goods and Services Tax legislation. He believed Stott Despoja would make a better leader, and was working towards that goal, which she in fact attained in April 2001.

However, a week before the November 2001 federal election, Coulter resigned from the party because he believed Stott Despoja had reduced internal party democracy. He said she had taken the party further away from the grassroots, that it had become pragmatic, and that he could not recommend that people vote for the party.

<text>The Abramovich Flyer was an early aircraft built by Russian aviator Vsevolod Mikhailovich Abramovich in 1912, based on the Wright brothers&#x27; designs he had seen while working for their German subsidiary. Differences from the Wright designs of the time included wheeled undercarriage and conventional empennage replacing the canard the Wrights used. Abramovich retained the wing warping technique the Wrights used for banking the aircraft, but controlled this with a control stick rather than the hip-controlled harness of the Wrights&#x27; design. Using this aircraft, Abramovich was successful in setting many early aviation records in Russia, including carrying several passengers.

<doc id="1054200" wikidata="Q6648963" url="?curid=1054200" title="Little Athletics">
<text>Little Athletics is an Australian activity program that involves modified athletics events for children aged 3 to 16 in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Northern Territory); 3 to 15 in Victoria; and 3 to 14 in Tasmania. According to Little Athletics&#x27; 2021–2022 anual report regarding the 2021–2022 financial year, it was estimated that more than 150,000 kids participated in the program for that financial year.

==History==
The competitions were founded by Trevor Billingham, a young Australian athletics enthusiast from Geelong, Victoria, in 1964. By 1967, there were more than 35 Little Athletics clubs in Victoria, and the decision was made to start the Victorian Little Athletics Association (VLAA).

Soon after the formation of the VLAA, other states expressed interest in Little Athletics. In February 1968, a year after the formation of the VLAA, Western Australia held its first Little Athletics meet at Perry Lakes Stadium. In 1972, the states of Victoria, New South Wales, Northern Territory and Western Australia became the founding members of The Australian Little Athletics Union (ALAU), which was formed in Perth. By 1974, Tasmania, Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and Queensland had all joined the ALAU.

== Events ==
Available Little Athletics events vary between age groups and from state to state. The following represents the range of events available.

== Structure and governance==
Under the independent governing body, Little Athletics Australia (LAA), each state and territory has its own association which is responsible for running Little Athletics in that state. Each state body controls the relevant centres and events in their state or territory. Clubs are the base level of the Little Athletics structure. Centres might house just one Little Athletics club or a number of clubs, with each club informing their own members of upcoming events. Training areas and facilities might be shared or separate.

==History ==
In October 1963, three young boys turned up at a senior athletics meet in Geelong, Victoria. They approached official Trevor Billingham, but Billingham turned them away citing their youth as a reason for them not to be allowed to compete. A few months later, Billingham held a coaching camp for secondary school students. His camp had a lot of primary school students in attendance.

Billingham decided to set up a Saturday competition for younger children. The first competition was on 3 October 1964, in Geelong. Billingham had advertised the event in the &quot;Geelong Advertiser&quot; by saying:
&quot;Also starting this Saturday, will be the special morning meeting for boys and girls. These will commence at 10:30 a.m. each Saturday and will be open to any school age competitor. It is intended that boys and girls not old enough to compete in the afternoon will take part in these special meetings. Anyone interested in the sport may attend, including parents, while the one-hour of athletics is conducted. All of the standard athletic events will be conducted and boys and girls will be graded in each event.&quot;

After the event, he wrote a one-page article titled &quot;Junior Athletics in Wet Conditions&quot;, which appeared in the &quot;Geelong Advertiser&quot; on 5 October 1964. He wrote that more than 80 boys and girls attended. He also wrote that there was a considerable need for such junior athletic competitions at the time, that the event was a success, and more events of the same type were to be held in the future.

By 1965, Billingham had still not convinced the Geelong branch of the Victorian Amateur Athletics Association (VAAA). In January 1965, Billingham acquired lights for the Geelong senior athletics oval, Landy Field, which was also where the Little Athletics competition were. The lights were originally erected at Kardinia Park for the 1956 Olympics; Billingham asked the Geelong Football Club if he could use the lights, and they allowed him. Billingham invited Ron Clarke to the now-lighted Landy Field to break the 20,000 meters and one-hour run world records, and Clarke accepted. In January 1965, Billingham also thought up the name &quot;Little Athletics&quot;; previously, the events had been called &quot;Junior Athletics&quot;. He took his two proposals to the VAAA, and both were accepted.

On 9 October 1965, the 1965/66 Geelong Little Athletics season started. Fourteen meets were held, with a fee of three shillings for the season.

Billingham was the sole preparer for the Ron Clarke visit. When Clarke came, he broke both world records and brought fame to the Geelong Centre of the VAAA at Landy Field.

Despite his success with Clarke, Billingham still could not get support for Little Athletics from VAAA; instead, they suggested he drop the junior competition and focus on the rapidly expanding senior one. One of the delegates, Jack Frewin, encouraged him to push through with his idea, so he published a notice in the &quot;Geelong Advertiser&quot; announcing that he needed to start a formation of Little Athletics clubs. There was a meeting of interested parents, and Billingham told them that he thought an organisation should be set up based on his experience from the seniors competitions but he need some parents to help him. On 27 November 1965, six clubs were formed. They were run by parents with Billingham as an overall manager. By the end of the 1965/66 season, more than 200 boys and girls were competing regularly across nine clubs, and more than 500 had tried out at least once. The first Geelong championships were held in March 1966 over the long weekend.

There was another meeting in March 1966. John McGlynn, an executive from the Ford Motor Company, suggested that there was a need to encourage other clubs from areas outside Geelong to start up. By September 1966, there were clubs in Geelong, Belmont, Newtown, Lara, Corio YMCA and St Thomas. They were all based around local high schools.

In May 1967, the Victorian Little Athletics Association (VLAA) was formed. By 1969, there were 39 clubs in the VLAA. The first Western Australian meet was in February 1968 at Perry Lakes Stadium. In March 1968, a Western Australian association was formed. Competitions in New South Wales started in October 1968. In 1972, the Australian Little Athletics Union (ALAU) was formed in Perth. Victoria, New South Wales, Northern Territory and Western Australia were the founding members. Tasmania, South Australia, Australian Capital Territory and Queensland joined shortly afterwards.

==Current==

In the 2013/14 season, Little Athletics had more than 100,000 athletes and approximately 500 centres. Every year, there is a national championship for athletes under 13 years old, in which each state has a team of its best athletes.

In July 2014, Jetstar announced a two-year sponsorship deal with Little Athletics Australia (LAA), which saw the Australian airline becoming the first naming partner of LAA. In September 2017, Coles signed with Little Athletics Australia, becoming its major partner.

<doc id="1054208" wikidata="Q1995127" url="?curid=1054208" title="Skipper (Barbie)">
<text>Skipper Roberts is a doll created by Mattel in 1964 to be Barbie&#x27;s young sister. Since 2009, she has a purple streak in her hair and is shown to have a tech-savvy and clever personality. Since the 2000s, Skipper has been characterized as a tech-savvy and trendy teenager. In some of the Barbie films, she likes to work on her photo blog or DJing. She had a starring role in the 2023 television film, &quot;&quot;.

Skipper&#x27;s appearance has changed significantly since her introduction. The first Skipper doll was eight years old. She was designed as a response to requests for Barbie to have children; Mattel felt that a little sister would be a better choice instead. Skipper was later changed to a teenager, and a controversial &quot;Growing Up Skipper&quot; doll with growable breasts was created to demonstrate the change.

== Fictional biography ==
According to the Random House novels of the 1960s, Skipper is the second child of George and Margaret Roberts of Willows, Wisconsin (their first child being Barbie). In these novels, she attended Baker Elementary, while the Marvel Comics of the early 1990s had her at Central Junior High School.

Since Skipper was re-released in 2009, she has had a new personality to match her redesigned appearance. She is described as a technology lover who likes &quot;being a gadget girl and trying out the hottest techie toys.&quot; Skipper is shown to be 14 years old in the TV series, &quot;Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures&quot;.

Skipper current design has also been rendered in computer animation for her appearances in the Barbie film series and the television adaptations of the &quot;Barbie&quot; media franchise including &quot;Dreamhouse Adventures&quot;, where she and fellow younger sisters were given &quot;a realistic and modern CGI look&quot; that was different from previous entries in the franchise.

=== Physical appearance ===
Since Skipper was introduced, the dimensions of the doll have changed significantly. She was in height (compared to Barbie&#x27;s ) when she was introduced, and then as newer versions were released, she gradually became taller with a teenage appearance. Usually, Skipper dolls have blue eyes. Skipper currently most often has pale skin and brunette hair with a purple streak.

== History ==
=== Creation ===
Skipper was created, along with Midge, to counteract criticism that claimed Barbie was a sex symbol. Midge&#x27;s facial appearance was gentler than Barbie&#x27;s, whereas Skipper was a response to requests for Barbie to have children; however, instead of having a married, pregnant Barbie, which would make her too domestic, Barbie would babysit Skipper. As Barbie&#x27;s little sister, Skipper was Barbie&#x27;s first family member sold. Since their introduction in 1964, Skipper dolls have changed drastically.

=== Modern (1975–present) ===
In 1975, Growing Up Skipper was released. The gimmick of the doll, which led to much controversy in the newspapers, was that if Skipper&#x27;s arm was rotated, the doll would become an inch taller and small breasts would appear on her rubber torso. This concept was later used for Mattel&#x27;s My Scene brand in 2007 with the &quot;Growing Up Glam&quot; line, which was also controversial. In 1979, Skipper&#x27;s entire appearance changed. She was advertised as &quot;Super Teen Skipper&quot;. She had a new body mold which included small, permanent breasts, and a different head mold that made her look slightly older. In 1985, Hot Stuff Skipper was released, which had another new head mold that included the addition of dimples and a longer face.

Skipper changed again in 1988 with the release of Teen Fun Skipper. Her new body mold was taller and more graceful. Her waist was more flexible and her breasts were slightly bigger. Her eyes were also enlarged, giving her a cartoon-like look. At this stage she appeared to be somewhere between 13 and 15 years old. Later, Skipper had a new head mold with smaller eyes in a Pizza Party line, but with the same body mold.

Finally, in 1997, Teen Skipper was introduced. She again had a new body mold and was now almost as tall as her sister Barbie. This was mostly because of her legs, which were now long and lanky. Most notable of all, however, was Skipper&#x27;s new face mold. She no longer looked like a child, but more like a girl on the brink of becoming a woman. Teen Skipper&#x27;s packaging revealed that she is now &quot;16 years old&quot;. Skipper also appeared to have larger breasts which continued the controversy over her sexualization that has dogged Skipper in the past.

=== Reproductions (1994–present) ===
In 1994, the first vintage reproduction Skipper was produced specifically for collectors to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Skipper&#x27;s introduction. Instead of the usual vinyl, the dolls were made of porcelain. She wore a blue reproduction ensemble from 1965, known then as &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;. In 2007, Mattel released its second vintage 1964 reproduction Skipper doll, this time wearing her &quot;School Days&quot; ensemble and sold in a gift set, along with a reproduction of a vintage swirl ponytail Barbie doll wearing the matching &quot;Knitting Pretty&quot; ensemble.

== Popularity ==
Skipper Madison Roberts was the original little sister of Barbie, and has been quite popular over the years. When she came out, she was an alternative for parents who did not approve of Barbie&#x27;s adult figure. The first vintage Skipper dolls now have a value of US$195 MIB (Mint In Box). The brass headbands alone that came with these dolls have a value of $20. While vintage Skipper dolls, clothes, and accessories can sell for a lot of money, modern Skipper dolls usually only have a value of $10 to $20 MIB. If they have no box, the value may be only $5 or less.

Skipper was featured in the 2023 &quot;Barbie&quot; film adaptation, played by Erica Ford, while Growing up Skipper was played by Hannah Khalique-Brown.

== Friends ==
Skipper&#x27;s friends at the vintage stage were Skooter (1965), Ricky (1965), Living Fluff (1971), and Pose N&#x27; Play Tiff (1972). Skooter and Ricky had their own head molds, and both had freckles. Skooter was available with the same three hair colors as Skipper had, but Ricky was only available with molded red hair, similar to Midge&#x27;s boyfriend, Allan Sherwood. Fluff and Tiff shared a head mold which many collectors considered adorable, with a contagious smile. Most of Skipper&#x27;s first friends were never seen after the lines they were produced for, but another Skooter doll, called Fun Time Skooter, was produced for the European market. She had auburn hair, a Twist N&#x27; Turn waist, and bendable legs. However, she had the head mold of the oldest version of Skipper, not the older Skooter doll, which many collectors found strange.

Skipper&#x27;s friend for the controversial Growing Up line was the brunette Ginger, made in 1976. However, after this line, Ginger was never seen again. Skipper&#x27;s first boyfriend, Scott, was created in 1980, and was introduced the year after Super Teen Skipper came on the market. Scott sported puffy, brown 1980s-style hair. Skipper gained two new friends after Teen Fun Skipper was introduced. They included the reddish haired friend Courtney, made in 1989, and her second boyfriend Kevin, created in 1990.

After Teen Skipper came on the market, her first African American friend appeared. Her name was Nikki, and she was made in 1997. Teen Skipper was going to have a third boyfriend, Zach, who would have joined her in the &quot;Totally Yo Yo&quot; line, but for reasons unknown, he was never produced. Parents speculated that Zach would be too much of a sexual influence on Skipper and children. However, the head mold for the unreleased Zach Doll was later used for Generation Girl Blaine, the token boy in Barbie&#x27;s &quot;Generation Girl&quot; Doll line.

In the &quot;Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures: Go Team Roberts&quot; Netflix series (2018), Skipper is joined by her friends Chantal and Navya, who run a babysitting business with her. Both characters are based on dolls from the Skipper’s Babysitters Inc. Barbie line. Chantal and Navya share a love of dancing.

In &quot; (2023)&quot;, Skipper was joined by three new friends: Joy, Cheri, and Anna. Joy is an Asian teenager with dark brunette hair featuring blonde streaks, who loves music and dreams of becoming a singer. Cheri is a Black teenager with dark brunette hair and pink streaks, passionate about dogs and aspiring to work with them. Anna is a Latina teenager with black hair and blue streaks, a creative jewelry designer who hopes to sell her pieces professionally. All three have summer jobs at Ocean’s Extreme and are featured as dolls in the movie&#x27;s accompanying doll line.

Danielle, Skipper’s friend, is a variant with dark skin and curly hair in an Afro-puff. She is featured as a Target exclusive in the Skipper First Jobs line, where she works at a Target cash register.

<text>The Green Belt Movement (GBM) is an indigenous grassroots organization in Kenya that empowers women through the planting of trees. It is one of the most effective and well-known grassroots organisations addressing the problem of global deforestation. Professor Wangari Maathai established the organization in 1977 under the auspices of the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK). GBM&#x27;s successes in forest conservation, education, and women&#x27;s economic empowerment have gained the organisation worldwide acclaim. It is also noted for its advocacy of human rights, democratisation of access to public lands, and environmental justice issues such as the role of women&#x27;s traditional ecological knowledge in addressing environmental degradation and desertification.

According to their 2003 annual report, the mission of GBM is &quot;to mobilize community consciousness for self-determination, justice, equity, reduction of poverty, and environmental conservation, using trees as the entry point.&quot; GBM is no longer directly linked to the NCWK and coordinates a national network of women&#x27;s groups that plant trees and do environmental conservation and community development work. Their work combats deforestation, restores sources of cooking fuel, generates income, and stops soil erosion. Maathai has incorporated advocacy and empowerment for women, eco-tourism, and overall economic development into the Green Belt Movement.

Since Wangari Maathai started the movement in 1977, more than 51 million trees have been planted, and more than 30,000 women have been trained in forestry, food processing, bee-keeping, and other trades that help them earn income while preserving their lands and resources. Communities in Kenya (both men and women) have been motivated and organized to both prevent further environmental destruction and restore that which has been damaged.

Maathai received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004 for her work with the Green Belt Movement.

== Background ==
Deforestation is a major contributor to environmental disasters, desertification, and climate change. The Green Belt Movement (GBM) is one of the most effective and visible grassroots organisations addressing these issues.

The Green Belt Movement was founded in 1977 by Wangari Maathai and the National Council of Women of Kenya, and subsequently grew into a grassroots movement for women&#x27;s economic empowerment and land stewardship. A 2005 paper by the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) stated that in Kenya, state expropriation of public lands for private use presents threats to the livelihoods and food security of peasants and the working poor, and that GBM is &quot;deeply immersed&quot; in the resulting struggles for control of public lands.

Maathai and the GBM connected the marginalisation of women and poverty to environmental degradation and promoted a grassroots approach to development by empowering women to control the environment. Their intention is to ensure that women have independent sources of income and also to conserve the environment through sustainable resource management.

=== History ===

Prior to the Green Belt Movement&#x27;s founding, specifically during the 1970s, there was a restricted political opportunity structure within Kenya because the government at the time was very politically repressive. The Kenyan government was dominated by men and their patriarchal and repressive views, which created many issues for women. Many women throughout Kenya were struggling with feeding their families, getting access to natural resources (water, wood). Moreover, many Kenyan women didn&#x27;t have any form of legal protection or say when it came to the politics in Kenya. Women were so repressed and treated so poorly that they weren&#x27;t allowed to be in government or sit in on political meetings. Eventually changes within Kenya and its government occurred. The Green Belt Movement specifically played an essential role in changing the ways women were treated, excluded from, and used in Kenya. The framing of the Green Belt Movement as a non-threatening environmental conservation effort made an enormous impact on the government and communities during a time that many other forms of activism were seen as threats to the government. However, by encouraging women to question their place and challenge social and political institutions that keep women compliant the Green Belt Movement was eventually founded officially. 

The Green Belt Movement began with Maathai founding the organization in 1977, but she founded the organization because of what she studied, taught, witnessed, learned, and wanted to change. She began with founding the movement, but prior to founding the movement she was involved she was a part of another environmental organization. Maathai served as chairwoman of the UNEP&#x27;s Environment Liaison Center board, which today is called the Environment Liaison Center International. From serving as a chairwomen with the UNLEP, she later on in 1974, switched gears, and began focusing her time and energy on mitigating environmental issues. Maathai focused for efforts on battling deforestation issues, and how to fix various other forest-related issues in order to improve the overall quality of life for the women and children in Kenya.

Maathai began with introducing tree planting programs and regimes into local communities/ targeting communities with little access to basic natural resources such as water or rice. The first tree planting the GBH facilitate occurred on 5 June 1977, and involved seven ethnic tribes being honored through the planting of trees. It took place in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, and trees were planted, marking the beginning of what would become an internationally influential movement that challenges the hegemonic structures of that oppress rural communities in Kenya. However, the tree planting programs and regimes took a significant amount of time for involvement to occur within communities. There were several trials done and eventually Maathai and the various employees of the GBM established successful programs. Maathai often told her coworkers in the GBM, &quot;We are on a track that has not been explored before. We are on a trial-and error basis. If what we did yesterday did not produce good results, let&#x27;s not repeat it today because it is a waste of time&quot;.

However, during the implementation of the tree planting program, the GBM also experienced many setbacks because of its lack of funding and support. This led to Wangari Maathai joining the National Council of Women of Kenya as a member of the executive committee. From Maathai joining the council the Green Belt Movement was able to get international attention and support from women and governments. The GBM also was able to gain much more help when it came to facilitating tree planting initiatives and educational programs. Maathai even was able to further the Green Belt&#x27;s movement through expanding its public outreach (media networks/supporters), gain more funding towards tree planting projects/ climate change initiatives, and overall more support to ensure the success of the organization.

After joining the National Council of Women of Kenya, Maathai went on to educate communities and facilitate permanent outreach programs. Eventually the GBM implemented its tree planting program throughout Kenya. The Green Belt Movement planted thousands of tree seedlings in long rows to form green belts of trees, thus marking the beginning of the Green Belt Movement. &quot;These &quot;belts&quot; had the advantages of providing shade and windbreaks, facilitating soil conservation, improving the aesthetic beauty of the landscape and providing habitats for birds and other small animals. During these local tree-planting ceremonies, community members usually turned out in large numbers. To conceptualize this fast-paced activity of creating belts of trees to adorn the naked land, the name &quot;Green Belt Movement&quot; was used.&quot; Because it gained support and funding from the National Council of Women of Kenya, the GBM was able to successfully continue its work and efforts throughout Kenya.

Through Maathai&#x27;s attitude, persistence, and efforts, the movement gained a large amount of traction in Kenya and throughout the world. Eventually, the second tree planting occurred in 1979 and involved the planting of trees by hundreds of women on a rural farm in Kenya. After the second tree planting the GBM was able to continue to grow as an organization and they also were able to conduct a significant about of research and studies on Kenya and its environmental problems. From the amount of research and activism the GBM continued to do, they were able to identify the need that rural communities and women especially needed. From their research, they started to consistently pass out seedlings to women and rural communities. The GBM also facilitated the implementation of income generating activities, and taught communities about environmentally sustainable practices.

After its second tree planting, and the establishment of several other projects and initiatives led to the GBM participating and facilitating a wide range of political activism. Specifically during the years of 1989–1994, the Green Belt Movement maintained its non-confrontational goals, while Wangari Maathai openly challenged the political arena. Maathai and the GBM partnered with organizations and community members throughout Kenya to advocate for environmentally sustainable practices, women&#x27;s rights, and various other environmental problems. Moreover, throughout the Green Belt Movement, the organizers of the movement had been able to educate community members on non-violent resolution practices. Through educating the community on non-violent problem solving practices and on politics, the GBM in combination with international organizations and community members have been able to initiate changes within the Kenyan government, and social, political, and economic norms in Kenya. Moreover, women throughout Kenya have been able to participate regularly within Kenyan politics, which has forced changes in Kenya to occur.

Throughout the establishment of the Green Belt Movement, the movement faced a variety of problems and harassment. Specifically in the 1980s, the Green Belt Movement was being harassed significantly at the grassroots level within communities and at the central office. For example, the Green Belt Movement was evicted from the government-owned office they had worked in for 10 years. But nowadays, the Green Belt Movement highlights the focus on direct social and economic transformation of communities to ensure they are not identified as having a political agenda. By highlighting the lack of direct threat, this organization is able to function without alarming the decision-making elite who currently benefit from the inequities in Kenya. Moreover, the movement has made immense strides in helping local rural communities, restoring and improving natural resources and ecosystems, and educating/ empowering women throughout Kenya.

=== Gendered political context ===

&quot;African women in general need to know that it&#x27;s ok for them to be the way they are to see the way they are as a strength, and to be liberated from fear and from silence.&quot; – Wangari Maathai

Before founding the GBM, Maathai had done a variety of traveling, studying, teaching, and volunteer work, which allowed her to take notice of major issues occurring in rural communities from a global perspective. But when Maathai returned to Kenya in 1969, she began working with civic organizations. She joined the board of the Environment Liaison Center and became a member of the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK). Both these organizations allowed Maathai to gain knowledge, do research, and understand the issues taking place within her community. &quot;While serving in the Environment Liaison Center, Maathai was exposed to conversations regarding the environmental degradation occurring in her own backyard. In the NCWK, Maathai listened to the voices and stories of hundreds of rural and urban women who suffered malnourishment and poverty. The decline in available firewood meant mothers could not cook their traditional foods. Instead they began cooking enriched white rice and other imported products that, although high in carbohydrates, lacked vitamins and minerals. Children were inflicted with diseases and malnourished&quot; (1). From seeing the horrendous conditions women throughout Kenya were facing, Maathai connected the dots between environmental degradation causing and forcing large communities to suffer. The large number of issues surrounding Kenya&#x27;s forest included deforestation, extinction of vegetation, harmful agricultural practices (crops and farmland), and high amount of soil degradation (soil erosion, sediment delivery, etc.). These issues impacted the people of Kenya so significantly that women and children were starving and dying consistently. Maathai took it upon herself to do something about it, which is what led to the Green Belt Movement being formed in 1977. From the Green Belt Movement being formed, it initiated women to become involved in the politics and in the various politics surrounding Kenya&#x27;s natural resources and ecosystems.

At first the involvement of women began with the tree planting program and it slowly grew into even more than just the tree planting program. The GBM started passing out seedlings to women and teaching groups of women how to properly plant and grow trees on their own. The GBM also provided free lessons to women in rural communities so they could grow their own food and feed their starving children. Through the GBM taking a very hands on and invasive approach to improving the rural communities within Kenya, many women were able to get the natural resources they needed/need to survive and continue to grow their families. From the GBM involvement within Kenya, women continued to go to the GBM and seek help and resources. The amount of resource and support the GBM provided especially to women, allowed for women to become activists for the movement. It also allowed women to gain access to a variety of educational resources and join the GBM&#x27;s efforts, activism, and overall contributions to rural communities. The variety of activism and political awareness that was sparked and continues to grow from the GBM can be evaluated through the lens of Black feminism.

Black feminism addresses the realities of intersectionality related to identity and the multiple forms of oppression, Black women specifically, experience. The concept of black feminism though was sparked and begin with Maathai. Maathai is responsible for initiating and growing the GBM, and overall spreading feministic views, knowledge, and educational materials throughout Kenya. She spread her feministic views and knowledge due to the fact she witnessed and endured a variety of discrimination, racism, and gender inequality throughout her life. Through her experiences in Kenya, she made it a goal for the GBM to incorporate empowering women and fostering their success. This in turn initiated Black feminism, which has become a known concept and a movement of its own. Since Maathai incorporated black feminism within the GBM, the number of women getting involved in their local communities politics, state-wide politics, and politics related to the GBM has increased dramatically since 1977. Women would typically not be aware or have access to political information or resources, but through the GBM, African American women have become involved with politics.

Specifically through the GBM, Maathai continued to foster black feminism. She did this through the GBM allowing women in Kenya to be key stakeholder in the organization. Being a key stakeholder has allowed for women to discuss and bring awareness to more communities and educate more women throughout the world. Moreover, it has helped to educate the leaders and organizers of the GBM so the GBM can effectively help and access communities that especially need help. The GBM also continues to foster black feminism through organizing seminars, speaking engagements, and various community based meetings/discussions. The organized seminars facilitated by the GBM, allowed women from various rural Kenyan communities to discuss their experiences of environmental degradation, political views, discriminatory experiences, etc. From the variety of discussions and seminars that take place, women are able to create solutions from subjugated knowledge to resist marginalization and cultural knowledge about their communities. The strategies used by the GBM and initiated by Maathai have contributed to benefiting women in Kenya tremendously and have allowed women to stay involved with the politics occurring in their rural communities.

However, even after the variety of support and momentum the GBM has gained throughout the years, the politics the GBM, and all women in Kenya face, are extremely controversial and patriarchal. For example, women are prevented from obtaining equal capital by the social and political restrictions in land ownership for women and being prevented from joining decision-making meetings. Luckily, the Green Belt Movement overall is an organization that seeks to mitigate oppressive practices by ending land grabbing, deforestation, and corruption. The GBM also focuses on educating women about politics and encourages them to take on leadership roles within the GBM (especially in the 21st century). The GBM even provides legal services and advice to women who are in need of help of any kind. Through the amount of activism and education the organization has spread, it has contributed to a shift in patriarchal norms and politics. Specifically, nowadays, the network consists of more than 4,000 community groups in Kenya that volunteer to protect their natural environment and practice day to day liberation for women. The number of people who have joined the GBM has made the roles of women and males&#x27; views toward women change in Kenya. The more the GBM influences and educates Kenya and its people in general, the more changes in Kenya&#x27;s laws, women&#x27;s roles, and overall environmental laws/regulations will occur.

== Activities ==
=== Key focus areas ===
The Green Belt Movement works in five principal areas known as &quot;core programs&quot;

# Civic &amp; Environmental Education
# Environmental Conservation/Tree Planting
# Green Belt Safaris (GBS)
# Pan African Training Workshops
# Women for Change [capacity building]

Each of these programs is aimed at improving the lives of local inhabitants by mobilizing their own abilities to improve their livelihoods and protect their local environment, economy and culture.

=== Areas of activity ===
The Green Belt Movement is involved in four main areas of activity that foster the improvement of the natural resources and ecosystems surrounding communities throughout the world. The four main areas of activity the GBM include:

# Tree Planting and Water Harvesting
# Climate Change
# Mainstream Advocacy
# Gender Livelihood and Advocacy

Tree planting and water harvesting activities are arranged, designed, installed, and overall monitored by the GBM. However, it also fosters communities to help conserve the natural resources and ecosystems around the world. The tree planting and water harvesting activities are conducted by the GBM through using a &quot;watershed based approach&quot;. Which involves the GBM getting communities to contribute to conserving the biodiversity surrounding them, to restoring local/public ecosystems, and to reducing the impact of climate change.

A major area of activity for the GBM is focused around there Climate Change Program. The program that the GBM created focuses on reducing climate change, by providing educational resources/information to impoverished and rural communities. The program also focuses on raising awareness throughout the worldwide, targeting rural communities with educational resources, programs, and various other resources.

The mainstream advocacy activities of the GBM includes advocating &quot;for greater political accountability and the expansion of democratic space in Kenya. GBM has called for, time and time again, an end to land grabbing, deforestation and corruption&quot;.

Furthermore, the Gender Livelihood and Advocacy the GBM is includes a combination of international and grassroots advocacy tactics. The GBM on a grassroots level focuses on creating &quot;climate resilient communities through restoration and protection of forest watersheds, and the creation of sustainable livelihoods for communities in Kenya and across Africa. GBM&#x27;s approach empowers communities to take action against climate change, the impacts of which are already being witnessed across Africa, through food security and water harvesting activities (adaptation) and planting the appropriate trees in appropriate places (mitigation). At the international level, GBM advocates for environmental policy that ensures the protection of natural forests and community rights, especially communities living close to and in forest ecosystems in sub-Saharan Africa and the Congo Basin Rainforest Ecosystem&quot;.

== Projects ==
The Green Belt Movement since its founding in 1977 has been involved a wide variety of projects. The projects that have been completed by the GBM are listed below.

* 1977: The Green Belt Movement was founded by Wangari Maathai in association with the National Council of Women of Kenya. 
*1980s: The Green Belt Movement established more than 600 tree nurseries who were installed by women throughout Kenya (2,500 – 3,000 women assisting).
*1980s: The Green Belt Movement established approximately 2,000 public green belts carrying 1,000 tree seedlings on each green belt.
*1986: The Green Belt Movement formed a pan-African Green Belt Network. The Network was formed to educate (women especially) on tree planting practices that are sustainable and environmentally safe. The Network was formed in several countries including Uganda, Malawi, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and Ethiopia.
*1989: The Green Belt Movement organized a large public protest against the construction of Times Tower. The Kenyan government announced its construction and the Green Belt Movement protested against the construction of the 459-foot skyscraper, located in Uhuru Park Nairobi. 
*1998: The Green Belt Movement facilitates its first indigenous tree plantings throughout Kenya. The Green Belt Movement also facilitated several protests in conjunction with the tree plantings in order to stop the degradation and privatization of the Karura Forest.

=== 2006 ===

* The GBM partnered with several organizations and tree nursery groups throughout the year. They ended up planting more than 4.6 million trees throughout Kenya.
* The GBM hosted several workshops that involved Civic and Environmental Education. The workshops facilitated education on tree planting practices, sustainable forest management, and the implementation of tree nurseries. Through the Civic and Environmental Education workshops a wide range of community members from Kenya communities participated. In total 200 new tree nurseries were installed throughout Kenya.
* The GBM launched global campaigns in partnership with several international organizations.
* The GBM partnered with the Work Foodbank and started work/created a new project. The project focused on implementing tree-planting initiatives throughout Kenya to counteract climate change effects occurring. The tree planting and restoring of forested areas took place in the Aberdare and Mt. Kenya Forests. 
* The GBM partnered with the Kenyan Forestry Military to share information, organize current projects, and agree on the roles of their organizations/partnerships within their tree planting initiatives.
* GBM School Environmental Education linked school children to elders through community reforestation activities.
* 200 new tree nursery groups were formed throughout Kenya, and establishment of Community Forest Associations through the Civic and Environmental Education empowerment workshops.
* November 2006 – GBM launched a Forest Restoration Project in collaboration with the World Bank, at the 12th Conference of Parties (COP 12) on Climate Change in Nairobi.
* Two International Charitable Organizations were established: The Green Belt Movement International – North American (GBMI-US) and the Green Belt Movement International – Europe (GBMI-E).
* The Kenya Chapter of the African Union&#x27;s Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC) was established in 2006 by civil society organizations based in Nairobi.
* During COP 12 in Nairobi, the Green Belt Movement launched the Billion Trees Campaign in partnership with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF).
* The GBM extended the &quot;Mottainai&quot; campaign to Kenya in 2006 to address the issue of waste management, particularly the common use of plastic bags which cannot be recycled or re-used.
* The GBM held Cultural Biodiversity workshops in 15 schools across Kenya.

=== 2007 ===

* 2007 alone, GBM communities planted more than 4.8 million trees in Kenya.
*GBM achieved planting seedlings on Kenya&#x27;s five water towers. 
*Educational scholarships were awarded to several girls who are a part of economically disadvantages communities and the GBM.
*The GBM partnered with the Kenya Army and planted 44,000 trees in the Kamae Forest. The trees were planted to restore the Aberdare mountain&#x27;s main water catchment. 
*The GBM facilitated and encouraged communities from all over Kenya to plant trees in order to restore the Mau Forest where it has been degraded or deforested. The GBM also mobilized several communities in activities on forest management, organic farming, and water harvesting. Through the activities the GBM facilitated they were also able to educate communities on and advocate against several harmful environmental practices taking place in the forest (ex. Charcoal burning and illegal grazing of land). They also were able to successfully plant more than 400,000 trees in the Mau Forest with the help of many local communities. However, during 2007, GBM did face problems and was halted from proceeding with their activities and advocacy within the Mau Forest. This was due to the large amount of post-election violence taking place in Kenya. 
*The GBM&#x27;s mapping facility (GIS) Geographic Information Systems Laboratory became fully operational for GBM field officers, educational programs and advocacy program&#x27;s. The laboratory also provided a wide range of information and historical research on the current projects and future projects GBM plans to undertake. There projects range from tree planting initiatives, to installing tree nurseries, and planning carbon projects. 
*The GBM&#x27;s Bio-Carbon project (from 2006), received approval in 2007 from the National Environment Management Authority (NEM). The project also involved the GBM partnering with the Kenya Army to host a series of tree planting activities and exercises. The tree planting exercises took place in the Kamae Forest and involved hundreds of communities from all over Kenya participating in tree planting activities. Furthermore, the Kenya Army provided a wide range of logistical support to the GBM so the mass tree planting exercises and activities could be successful. 
*The GBM continued to grow the &quot;Mottaini&quot; advocacy campaign. The GBM participated in advocating for banning the sales, production, and importing of all polythene bags (plastic bags) within the city of Nairobi. The ban was GBM advocated for the ban on plastic bags to help stop environmental degradation from occurring. The GBM under the &quot;Mottaini&quot; campaign also trained 10,000 people, teachers, students, business leaders, shop managers, civil society leaders and international volunteer groups were trained and educated on the significance of &quot;Mottaninai&quot;. The training of 10,000 individuals within Kenya allowed for environmental degradation to be halted (somewhat) and environmental sustainability practices to be spread throughout rural communities in Kenya. 
*The GBM partnered with its international organizations, the Green Belt Movement International–North America (GBMI-US) and the Green Belt Movement International–Europe (GBMIEurope) to organize and collect a series of resources for Kenya&#x27;s GBM advocacy, project planning, and overall educational outreach programs. Through the GBM partnering with a variety of its international organizations, the GBM launched its Facebook page, website, and posted its first YouTube channel/video. Moreover, the GBM also was able to spread more global awareness and educational information (ex. Climate change, protection of the Congo Forest Basin) about their organization through their partners. 
*Mobilized more than 5,000 community members through Civic and Environmental Education.

=== 2008 ===

* GBM communities planted 8.3 million trees throughout 2008.

* In 2008, the &quot;Women for Change&quot; program awarded much needed secondary school scholarships to nine girls and three boys – nominated by the GBM Tree planting groups.
* From the violence that took place in December 2007, with 1500 deaths, and 500,000 people fled from their homes across Kenya. The GBM&#x27;s Women for Change created the Peace Tent Initiative in area affected by violence. From a total of six community dialogues and 21 open meetings held in the most affected areas, led to the Peace Building Councils being formed.
* Seventeen corporate partners engaged in the GBM&#x27;s tree planting practices in Nairobi which facilitated environmental conservation measures to occur.
* GBM acquired new Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software and trained 53 extension offices on GIS techniques and programs.
* GBM expanded its tree-planting partnerships with several Kenyan institutions, including the army, prisons, schools and churches.
* Supported the Billion Tree Campaign

=== 2009 ===

* The GBM planted several million trees but there was a severe drought and very bad weather that continued throughout the year. A large number of trees died and did not survive, or the seedlings did not take root at all.
* The GBM opened up its first Geographic Information System (GIS) laboratory and used it to determine the extent of deforestation and forest degradation occurring. The GBM also facilitated the use of the laboratory for teaching and educating communities on the GIS system and tools and used their relationships with local communities to map out severely degraded or deforested areas.
* GBM expands its advocacy and networking efforts through launching &quot;Enough is Enough&quot; campaign, winning two legal cases on human rights and protection of property, and launching the Lake Naivasha campaign to sensitize the communities.

== Activism ==
Since the establishment of the Green Belt Movement they have participated in a variety of activism throughout the world. They have gone from doing a very little amount of activism to expanding worldwide. The GBM does their activism through the Community Empowerment and Education program (CEE). The CEE allows community members from all over Kenya to come together and learn about human activities and how they affect the environment and cause environmental degradation. Moreover, the CEE provides a space for individuals to unite and discuss gender inequalities towards women in Kenya. The GBM from their outreach and activism has been able to get involved a variety of advocacy since their founding.

* In 1989 the Movement took on the powerful business associates of President Daniel arap Moi. A sustained, and often lonely protest, against the construction of a 60-story business complex in the heart of Uhuru Park in Nairobi was launched and won.
* In 1991 a similar protest was launched that saved Jeevanjee Gardens from the fate of being turned into a multi-story parking lot.
* In 1998, the Movement led a crusade against the illegal allocation of parts of the 2,000 acre (8 km2) Karura Forest, a vital water catchment area in the outskirts of Nairobi. The struggle was finally won in 2003 when leaders of the newly elected NARC government affirmed their commitment to the forest by planting trees in the area.
* This activism has come at a high cost to both Maathai in person and to the Movement. The Kenyan government closed Greenbelt offices, has twice jailed Maathai and she was subject in 1992 to a severe beating by police while leading a peaceful protest against the imprisonment of several environmental and political activists. Whilst these have served as impediments to the Greenbelt Movement, they have not stifled it and it continues as a world-renowned and respected Movement.

=== 2005 ===

* &quot;In 2005, Prof. Maathai and Mainichi Newspaper launched the Mottainai campaign in Japan. The goal was to mobilize the general public of Japan to use resources more sustainably in their daily lives. The term &quot;Mottainai&quot; is an ancient Japanese Buddhist concept that urged people not to waste limited resources, to be grateful for they have, and use what they have with respect and care. Prof. Maathai was introduced to the concept by Mainichi and has since adopted it as a global campaign symbolic of the protection and care of the environment. Through the continued support of Mainichi, GBM extended the &quot;Mottainai&quot; campaign to Kenya in 2006 to address the issue of waste management, particularly the common use of &quot;flimsy&quot; plastic bags which cannot be recycled or re-used&quot;(15).

<doc id="1054210" wikidata="Q267184" url="?curid=1054210" title="Annie Ross">
<text>Annie Ross (born Annabelle Allan Short; 25 July 193021 July 2020) was a British-American singer and actress, best known as a member of the influential jazz vocal trio Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross. She helped pioneer the vocalese style of jazz singing, with a style described by critic Dave Gelly as &quot;a kind of dreamy watchfulness that is a definition of 1950s hip.&quot; In 2010, she was named a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts.

Kenneth Tynan, who wrote liner notes for Ross, called her &quot;a fallen angel [who] moves us and then brushes off our sympathy with a shrug of her lips.&quot;

==Early life==
Ross was born in Surrey, England, the daughter of Scottish vaudevillians John &quot;Jack&quot; Short and Mary Dalziel Short (née Allan). Her brother was Scottish entertainer and theatre producer and director Jimmy Logan. She first appeared on stage at age three. At the age of four, she travelled to New York by ship with her family; she later recalled that they &quot;got the cheapest ticket, which was right in the bowels of the ship.&quot;

Shortly after arriving in the city, she won a token contract with MGM through a children&#x27;s radio contest run by Paul Whiteman. She subsequently moved with her aunt, Scottish-American singer and actress Ella Logan, to Los Angeles, and her mother, father and brother returned to Scotland. She did not see her parents again until fourteen years later. At the age of seven, she sang &quot;The Bonnie Banks o&#x27; Loch Lomond&quot; in &quot;Our Gang Follies of 1938&quot;, and played Judy Garland&#x27;s character&#x27;s sister in &quot;Presenting Lily Mars&quot; (1943).

At the age of 14, she wrote the song &quot;Let&#x27;s Fly&quot;, which won a songwriting contest and was recorded by Johnny Mercer and the Pied Pipers.

At the end of 10th grade, she left school, changed her name to Annie Ross, and went to Europe, where she established her singing career. She changed her surname to Ross during the plane trip to Prestwick; in a 2011 interview, she said: &quot;My aunt was very fanciful and she said I had an Irish grandmother called Ross, so that&#x27;s where that surname came from.&quot;

==Career==
In 1952, Ross met Prestige Records owner Bob Weinstock, who asked her to write lyrics to a jazz solo in a similar way to King Pleasure, a practice that would later be known as vocalese. The next day, she presented him with &quot;Twisted&quot;, a treatment of saxophonist Wardell Gray&#x27;s 1949 composition of the same title, a classic example of the genre. The song, first released in 1952 (later collected on the album &quot;King Pleasure Sings/Annie Ross Sings&quot;), was an underground hit, and resulted in her winning &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine&#x27;s New Star award.

In February 1956, the British music magazine &quot;NME&quot; reported that Ross&#x27;s version of the song &quot;I Want You to Be My Baby&quot; was banned by the BBC due to the lyric &quot;Come upstairs and have some loving&quot;.
She recorded seven albums with Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross between 1957 and 1962. Their first, &quot;Sing a Song of Basie&quot; (1957), was to have been performed by a group of singers hired by Jon Hendricks and Dave Lambert with Ross brought in only as vocal consultant. It was decided that the trio should attempt to record the material and overdub all the additional vocals themselves, but the first two tracks were recorded and deemed unsatisfactory so they ditched the dubbing idea. The resulting album was a success, and the trio became an international hit. Over the next five years, Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross toured all over the world and recorded such albums as &quot;The Hottest New Group in Jazz&quot; (1959), &quot;Sing Ellington&quot; (1960), &quot;High Flying&quot; (1962), and &quot;The Real Ambassadors&quot; (1962), written by Dave Brubeck and featuring Louis Armstrong and Carmen McRae.

Ross left the group in 1962. In 1964 she opened a nightclub in London. Annie&#x27;s Room hosted Joe Williams, Nina Simone, Stuff Smith, Blossom Dearie, Anita O&#x27;Day, Jon Hendricks, and Erroll Garner.

Her adulthood film roles included Liza in &quot;Straight On till Morning&quot; (1972), Claire in &quot;Alfie Darling&quot; (1976), Diana Sharman in &quot;Funny Money&quot; (1983), Vera Webster in &quot;Superman III&quot; (1983), Mrs. Hazeltine in &quot;Throw Momma from the Train&quot; (1987), Rose Brooks in &quot;Witchery&quot; (1988), Loretta Cresswood in &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot; (1990), Tess Trainer in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (1993), and Lydia in &quot;Blue Sky&quot; (1994). She also appeared as Granny Ruth in the horror films &quot;Basket Case 2&quot; (1990) and &quot;Basket Case 3: The Progeny&quot; (1991). She also had a bit part in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;The Player&quot; in 1992. Ross also starred in Scottish Television&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Charles Endell Esquire&quot; (1979).

She provided the speaking voice for Britt Ekland in &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (1973), and Ingrid Thulin&#x27;s singing voice in &quot;Salon Kitty&quot; (1976). On stage, she appeared in &quot;Cranks&quot; (1955; London and New York City), &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; (1972), &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot; (1973) at the Royal Opera House, &quot;Kennedy&#x27;s Children&quot; (1975) at Arts Theatre, London, &quot;Side by Side by Sondheim&quot;, and in the Joe Papp production of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; (1982).

==Personal life==
In 1949, Ross had a brief affair with drummer Kenny Clarke. This affair produced a son, Kenny Clarke Jr. (born 1950), who was raised by Clarke&#x27;s brother and his wife. During her time with Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross, she became addicted to heroin and in the late 1950s had an affair with the comedian Lenny Bruce, who was also having drug problems. By 1960, Carol Sloane was substituting for her on tour. After a performance by the trio in London in May 1962, she remained in London to confront her drug addiction. In 1963, she married actor Sean Lynch; they divorced in 1975, and he died in a car crash soon afterwards. By that time, she had also lost her home and declared bankruptcy. 

She became a United States citizen in 2001. Ross died in New York City on 21 July 2020 from emphysema and heart disease, four days before her 90th birthday.

==Awards and honours==
Ross received the ASCAP Jazz Wall of Fame award (2009), the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters&#x27; Award (2010), and the MAC Award for Lifetime Achievement (2011).

In July 2006 a one-woman play entitled &quot;TWISTED: The Annie Ross Story&quot; by Brian McGeachan premiered at The Space Theatre in London, starring Verity Quade. It focused on her stormy relationship with her aunt, Broadway legend Ella Logan, her brief affair with the comedian Lenny Bruce and her addiction to heroin. The play transferred to the Brockley Jack Theatre in London that same year, with Ross being played by Betsy Pennington.

A documentary about Ross&#x27;s life, entitled &quot;No One But Me&quot;, premiered at the Glasgow Film Festival in 2012.

<text>Chinook Pass (elevation 5430 ft./1656 m.) is a pass through the Cascade Range in the state of Washington.

The pass is located on the crest of the Cascade Range, along a ridge between Yakima Peak to the northwest of the pass, and Naches Peak to the southeast. The boundary between Pierce County, west of the pass, and Yakima County to the east, coincides with the ridge. Terrain immediately west of the pass is in the Cowlitz River watershed. Terrain on the east side drains to the Yakima River watershed.

The pass provides the east entrance to Mount Rainier National Park, and carries State Route 410 between the towns of Enumclaw and Naches. Because of the high elevation, Chinook Pass is usually closed in November due to very heavy snow and significant avalanche danger. It usually opens in mid-May and is not uncommon to have a snow depth at the summit of up to 15 feet.

As part of the All-American Road program, Route 410 through Chinook Pass has been designated by the U.S. government as the Chinook Scenic Byway. It is considered to be one of the most beautiful routes in the United States. Because the summit is above the treeline, there are many places to park along the road to view the scenery. As commercial vehicles are not allowed through the National Park section of State Route 410, this route is also favored by summer tourists.

==History==
Chinook Pass was chosen as a route across the Cascade Mountains as a compromise. The height of the route would mean that it would likely never be a year-round road. The alternative was Naches Pass, which with the addition of a short tunnel would be much lower (and easier to keep open in winter). The Naches Pass plan is still on the books as SR 168, but it has never been built.

The cost of the tunnel was the deciding factor, and the Chinook Pass route was chosen.

The Yakima side of a road over Chinook Pass was partially completed in 1914, but then work was abandoned for several years. This section was referred to as the &#x27;Normile Grade&#x27;. In 1921 work began again on the Yakima side, below Normile, on the American River. This work was done using horse teams. In 1924, an army tractor was brought in to speed up the work. Work on the west side of the road commenced later, and took longer. The two sides did not meet until 1931 at Tipsoo Lake near the summit.

==Recreation==

From 1940 to 59, Chinook Pass was one of the top ski areas in the state, with a season that ran from December to June. There were numerous non-permanent rope tows that extended from Cayuse Pass to the Tipsoo Lake area. The requirement that they were temporary tows was made by the Mount Rainier National Park so the lifts could be removed when the snow melted in the summer months. With the state government plans to no longer keep Chinook Pass open during the winter months and the opening of White Pass Ski Area, lift skiing ended. It is still a very popular area for backcountry telemark skiing and snowboarding from May to July.

Tipsoo Lake is located just a few hundred meters from the summit, with a picnic area and a trail going around the lake, is one of the most photographed landscapes in the United States.

Chinook Pass is also a trailhead to the Pacific Crest Trail, providing access to Dewey Lake and Cougar Lake (in the William O. Douglas Wilderness), Crystal Mountain Ski Resort, and the Norse Peak Wilderness.

The Naches Peak Loop is a trail route that goes around Naches Peak, containing a segment of the Pacific Crest Trail.

<text>David Henry Jacobs (30 April 1888 – 6 June 1976) was a Welsh-born track and field sprinter. He was the first British Jew to win an Olympic gold medal.

== Biography ==
Jacobs was born in Cardiff to John Jacobs (previously Yaakov), who was a general dealer from London. His athletics career started in London with Herne Hill Harriers in 1908. His interest in athletics was aroused by watching the 1908 Olympic Games.

At the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Jacobs won a gold medal as the first leg in the British 4 × 100 m relay team, despite finishing second behind the United States in the semifinals. The United States was later disqualified for a fault in passing the baton, the same mistake made in the finals by the world record holder and main favourite German team.

Jacobs competed in the 100m and 200m individual events but was eliminated in the semifinals.

Although many times a Welsh champion, Jacobs never succeeded in winning an AAA title. He finished third in the 440 yards event at the 1910 AAA Championships, second behind Willie Applegarth at the 1912 AAA Championships and second again behind George Nicol at the 1913 AAA Championships.

Jacobs retired from active sport after World War I. He died suddenly in Aberconwy, aged 88, while on holiday from his London home. His body was returned to London, where he was buried in a Jewish cemetery, at East Ham. At the time of his death, he was Britain&#x27;s oldest Olympic gold medalist.

<text>Spoudaiogeloion () denotes the mixture of serious and comical elements stylistically. The word comes from the Greek σπουδαῖον &quot;spoudaion&quot;, &quot;serious&quot;, and γελοῖον &quot;geloion&quot;, &quot;comical&quot;.

The concept of the word, but not the word itself, first appears in Aristophanes&#x27;s &quot;The Frogs&quot; (405 BC) lines 389–393, in a scene where the Chorus, who are devoted to Demeter, pray for victory: καὶ πολλὰ μὲν γελοῖά μ’ εἰπεῖν, πολλὰ δὲ σπουδαῖα, καὶ τὴς σὴς ἑορτὴς ἁείως παίσαντα καὶ σκώψαντα νικήσαντα ταινιούσθαι. (Allow me to say many things in jest and many things in seriousness, and, having sported and lampooned in a manner worthy of your feast, let me, victorious, win the victor&#x27;s wreath.) The word was first coined in the Old Comedy period.

Spoudaiogeloion was often used in satirical poems or folktales, which were funny, but had a serious, often ethical, theme. The serio-comic style became a rhetorical mainstay of the Cynics. The Romans gave it its own genre in the form of satire, contributed to most notably by the poets Horace and Juvenal. It was the most common tone of the works made by Menippus and Meleager of Gadara.

<doc id="1054228" wikidata="Q14218357" url="?curid=1054228" title="Holbrook, New South Wales">
<text>Holbrook is a small town in Southern New South Wales, Australia. It is on the Hume Highway, by road North East of Melbourne and by road south-west of Sydney between Tarcutta and Albury. The town is in the Greater Hume Shire which was established in May 2004 from the merger of Culcairn Shire with the majority of Holbrook Shire and part of the Hume Shire. At the 2016 census, Holbrook had a population of 1,715 people. The district around Holbrook is renowned for local produce including merino wool, wheat and other grains, lucerne, fat cattle and lamb.

==History==
Holbrook is on the traditional lands of the Wiradjuri people.

The explorers Hume and Hovell were the first-known Europeans in the area. They travelled through in 1824 looking for new grazing country in the south of the colony of New South Wales.

The town was originally called Ten Mile Creek and the first buildings were erected in 1836. A German immigrant, John Christopher Pabst, became the publican of the Woolpack Hotel on 29 July 1840 and the area became known as &quot;the Germans&quot;. By 1858 the name had evolved into the official name of &quot;Germanton&quot;, though the postal area retained the name Ten Mile Creek. In 1876 the name &quot;Germanton&quot; was gazetted and the old name Ten Mile Creek consigned to history.

Ten Mile Creek Post Office opened on 1 January 1857, and was renamed Germanton in 1875.

On 17 August 1878, Germanton hosted the earliest known game of Soccer (Association Football) in New South Wales between Germanton and Yarra Yarra football teams.

During World War I, the town name was deemed unpatriotic so on 24 August 1915 the town was renamed Holbrook in honour of Lt. Norman Douglas Holbrook, a decorated wartime submarine captain and winner of the Victoria Cross. Lt. Holbrook commanded the submarine .

The town was a stop on Old Sydney Road – the road between Sydney and Melbourne. The railway arrived in Germanton in 1902. The town was serviced by the Holbrook branch railway line until the line was closed in 1975.

In 2013, a re-alignment of the Hume Highway around Holbrook was completed so it is now possible to bypass the town.

===Garryowen===
Garryowen was a property and small settlement on Little Billabong Creek, about north-east of Holbrook, in the mid 19th century. A larger settlement was planned but never built.

==Sport==
Australian rules football, cricket and netball are the most popular sports. 

The Holbrook Football Netball Club, founded in 1882, is a member of the Hume Football Netball League which it joined in 1999 and has won senior men&#x27;s premierships in 2002 and 2022. 

It is also home to the Holbrook Cricket Club which plays in the local district association.

The Holbrook Rugby League Club founded in the 1930s and folded in 1991 (known as the Warriors and Bears) was a reasonably successful Group 13 Rugby League team in the 1950s and 1960s.

In the 1930s, the town was part of the route of the annual John Woodman Memorial bicycle handicap race organised by the Albury Wodonga Cycling Club.

==Local landmarks==

===HMAS Otway===

To honour Lieutenant Holbrook, the town&#x27;s namesake, the Holbrook council acquired a portion of the hull of , an Oberon-class submarine, after it was decommissioned by the Royal Australian Navy in 1995. The Navy gifted the fin from the submarine to the town. This resulted in a fund-raiser by the town and district to purchase the whole submarine. This drive was successful in raising $100,000, almost all a gift from Lieutenant Holbrook&#x27;s widow, Gundula Holbrook. However, this amount was insufficient to purchase all of the Otway. Through negotiations with the scrap yard in Sydney, the town succeeded in purchasing all of the outside casing of Otway above the waterline. This part of the Otway is now displayed in Germanton Park in the heart of Holbrook, having been dedicated on 7–8 June 1997.
