<text>4-4-0, in the Whyte notation, denotes a steam locomotive with a wheel arrangement of four leading wheels on two axles (usually in a leading bogie), four powered and coupled driving wheels on two axles, and no trailing wheels.

First built in the 1830s, locomotives with this wheel arrangement were known as &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;Eight-Wheeler&quot; type. In the first half of the 19th century, almost every major railroad in North America owned and operated locomotives of this type, and many rebuilt their and locomotives as 4-4-0s.

In April 1872, &quot;Railroad Gazette&quot; used &quot;American&quot; as the name of the type. The type subsequently also became popular in the United Kingdom, where large numbers were produced.

The vast majority of 4-4-0 locomotives had tenders, though some tank locomotives (designated 4-4-0T) were built.

== Development ==

===American development===
Five years after new locomotive construction had begun at the West Point Foundry in the United States with the &quot;Best Friend of Charleston&quot; in 1831, the first 4-4-0 locomotive was designed by Henry R. Campbell, at the time the chief engineer for the Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown Railway. Campbell received a patent for the design in February 1836 and soon set to work building the first 4-4-0.

At the time, Campbell&#x27;s 4-4-0 was a giant among locomotives. Its cylinders had a bore with a piston stroke, it boasted driving wheels, could maintain of steam pressure and weighed . Campbell&#x27;s locomotive was estimated to be able to pull a train of at on level track, outperforming the strongest of Baldwin&#x27;s s in tractive effort by about 63%. However, the frame and driving gear of his locomotive proved to be too rigid for the railroads of the time, which caused Campbell&#x27;s prototype to be derailment-prone. The most obvious cause was the lack of a weight equalizing system for the drivers.
At about the same time as Campbell was building his 4-4-0, the company of Eastwick and Harrison was building its own version of the 4-4-0. This locomotive, named &quot;Hercules&quot;, was completed in 1837 for the Beaver Meadow Railroad. It was built with a leading bogie that was separate from the locomotive frame, making it much more suitable for the tight curves and quick grade changes of early railroads. The &quot;Hercules&quot; initially suffered from poor tracking, which was corrected by giving it an effective springing system when returned to its builder for remodeling.


Even though the &quot;Hercules&quot; and its successors from Eastwick and Harrison proved the viability of the new wheel arrangement, the company remained the sole builders of this type of locomotive for another two years. Norris Locomotive Works built that company&#x27;s first 4-4-0 in 1839, followed by Rogers Locomotive &amp; Machine Works, the Locks &amp; Canals Machine Shop and the Newcastle Manufacturing Company in 1840. After Henry Campbell sued other manufacturers and railroads for infringing on his patent, Baldwin settled with him in 1845 by purchasing a license to build .
As the 1840s progressed, the design of the 4-4-0 changed little, but the dimensions of a typical example of this type increased. The boiler was lengthened, drivers grew in diameter and the firegrate was increased in area. Early were short enough that it was most practical to connect the pistons to the rear drivers, but as the boiler was lengthened, the connecting rods were more frequently connected to the front drivers.

In the 1850s, locomotive manufacturers began extending the wheelbase of the leading bogie and the drivers as well as the tender bogies. By placing the axles farther apart, manufacturers were able to mount a wider boiler completely above the wheels that extended beyond the sides of the wheels. This gave newer locomotives increased heating and steaming capacity, which translated to higher tractive effort. Similarly, by placing the leading bogie axles further apart enabled the cylinders to be placed between them in a more horizontal orientation, thereby distributing the engine&#x27;s weight more evenly when going around curves and uneven track. These advancements, combined with the increasingly widespread adaptation of cowcatchers, bells, and headlights, gave the 4-4-0 locomotives the appearance for which they are most recognized.

The design and subsequent improvements of the 4-4-0 configuration proved so successful that, by 1872, 60% of Baldwin&#x27;s locomotive construction was of this type and it is estimated that 85% of all locomotives in operation in the United States were s. However, the 4-4-0 was soon supplanted by bigger designs, like the and , even though the 4-4-0 wheel arrangement was still favored for express services. The widespread adoption of the and larger locomotives eventually helped seal its fate as a product of the past.

Although largely superseded in North American service by the early 20th century, Baldwin Locomotive Works produced two examples for the narrow gauge Ferrocarriles Unidos de Yucatán in early 1946, probably the last engines of this wheel arrangement intended for general use. A number of individual engines have been custom-built for theme parks in recent years, resembling early designs in appearance.

===British development===
The first British locomotives to use this wheel arrangement were the broad gauge 4-4-0 tank engine designs which appeared from 1849. The first British tender locomotive class, although of limited success, was the broad gauge &quot;Waverley&quot; class of the Great Western Railway, designed by Daniel Gooch and built by Robert Stephenson &amp; Company in 1855.

The first American-style British 4-4-0 tender locomotive on , designed by William Bouch for the Stockton &amp; Darlington Railway in 1860, followed American practice with two outside cylinders.

Britain&#x27;s major contribution to the development of the 4-4-0 wheel arrangement was the inside cylinder version, which resulted in a steadier locomotive, less prone to oscillation at speed. This type was introduced in Scotland in 1871 by Thomas Wheatley of the North British Railway.

==Use==
===Australia===

Australia&#x27;s first 4-4-0 locomotives were introduced by the South Australian Railways in 1859. From that initial order for two locomotives, the numbers of this wheel arrangement multiplied and eventually appeared in most of the Australian colonies. Tender, tank and saddle tank versions, varying in size from small locomotives to express passenger racers with driving wheels, worked in Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania on , and 
 gauge.

The locomotives originally came from British builders such as Dübs &amp; Company and Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company; however, from the late 1870s into the 1880s, railways also bought locomotives from American builders, mostly from Baldwin, and a few from the Rogers Locomotive &amp; Machine Works in New Jersey. From the 1880s onward, local firms such as James Martin &amp; Co. in Gawler, South Australia, and the Phoenix Foundry in Ballarat, Victoria would also build them. In New South Wales and Victoria, the 4-4-0 were predominant for mainline passenger services until the early 1900s. In Western Australia, some were later converted to a wheel arrangement.

===Finland===

In Finland, the 4-4-0 was represented by the Classes A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6 and A7.
* The Class A4 was a class of nine locomotives, built in 1872 and 1873 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works for use on the Hanko–Hyvinkää railway.
* The Finnish Steam Locomotive Class A5 was a class of only two locomotives, built in 1874 and 1875 by the Finnish State Railroad&#x27;s workshops in Helsinki. One of them is preserved at the Finnish Railway Museum.

=== Indonesia ===

The 4-4-0 two cylinder compound tender locomotives began to set its step on Java in 1900s. The &quot;Staatsspoorwegen&quot; (SS) ordered 44 of these from 3 different manufacturers, they were from Hanomag, Sächsische Maschinenfabrik (Hartmann) and Werkspoor and they were imported in 1900–1910. 

After they had already arrived in Java, they were classified as SS Class 600 with 1,503 mm driving wheels which way much bigger than any operational SS locomotives at the time and used as the main workhorse for express trains. The SS 600s could be found hauling local trains in Tanah Abang–Rangkasbitung–Merak/Labuan, Madiun–Kertosono–Blitar and Babat–Jombang lines. Some of them were also found in Maos–Kroya–Kutoarjo and Surabaya–Pasuruan lines. Then, the SS sent their five SS 600s to South Sumatra due to the increasing needs of railway transport in there. These locomotives were withdrawn from active service momentarily in 1929-1934 during great depression because of their cylinder compound technology which has a complicated mechanism system so the SS had to save its budget by preserving these locomotives, but they received extensive maintenance so they still could be used normally.

During Japanese occupation in 1942, all of private/state railway companies of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) were renumbered based on Japanese numberings, without exception to SS Class 600s were renumbered to B51 and it still used after Indonesian Independence with their &quot;Djawatan Kereta Api&quot; (DKA) or Department of Railways of the Republic of Indonesia up to now. One unit of B51 was sent out again to West Sumatra to serve coal train transport in Muaro–Pekanbaru line till it closed in September, 1945. From 44 locomotives, only B51 12 (ex-SS 612) of Hanomag is preserved. Previously, B51 12 was a yard shunter of Bojonegoro railway station. The B51 12 was once a static display for more than 30 years at Ambarawa Railway Museum, before finally fully restored in 2012 to haul the Ambarawa excursion train for Ambarawa–Tuntang line beside the Esslingen B25 02 and 03 which were used on rack line between Jambu–Bedono.

===Mozambique===

Between 1895 and 1898, Pauling &amp; Company placed 42 Falcon F2 and F4 4-4-0 tender locomotives in service on the narrow gauge railway which was being constructed for the Beira Railway in Mozambique. They were supplied in six batches by Falcon Engine &amp; Car Works in England and the Glasgow Railway Engineering Company in Scotland.

In service, these locomotives were nicknamed &quot;Lawleys&quot; after the Beira Railway construction subcontractor. The construction of the last batch of ten F4 locomotives was subcontracted by Falcon to the Glasgow Railway Engineering Company in Scotland and these were consequently often referred to as the &quot;Drummond F4&quot;.

The Falcon F4 was larger and heavier than the earlier F2, with a tractive effort that was increased from the of the F2 to at 75% boiler pressure. It could haul up the ruling gradients, compared to the that the F2 could manage.

===New Zealand===
The NZR LA class tank locomotives of 1887 were built in Britain by Nasmyth, Wilson &amp; Company in 1887 for the New Zealand Midland Railway Company. They were taken over by the New Zealand Railways Department in 1900, when the government acquired the incomplete Midland line.

===Rhodesia===
When the Beira Railway in Mozambique was regauged to by 1900 and the whole 4-4-0 Lawley locomotive fleet was staged, six of the Mozambican F4 locomotives were acquired by the Ayrshire Railway, which was then under construction in Southern Rhodesia. They remained in service there until 1914, when this line was also converted to Cape gauge and became the Sinoia branch of the Beira, Mashonaland and Rhodesia Railway.

===South Africa===

====Narrow gauge====
In 1907 and 1910, the Tongaat Sugar Estates in Natal acquired two 4-4-0 tank locomotives from WG Bagnall for their gauge line. These locomotives had cylinders. A further eleven similar locomotives, but with cylinders, were delivered from the same manufacturer between 1926 and 1946. 
In 1915, thirteen of the Beira Railway&#x27;s retired narrow gauge Falcon F2 and F4 locomotives were acquired from Mozambique by the Union Defence Forces for use in South Africa, where they replaced locomotives that had been commandeered for the war effort in German South West Africa during World War I. At the end of the war, the South African Railways stored them before returning them to service in 1921. When a system of grouping narrow gauge locomotives into classes was eventually introduced between 1928 and 1930, they were classified as class NG6.

In 1936, Bagnall built a single 4-4-0 tank locomotive, named &quot;Burnside&quot;, with cylinders, for the gauge line of the Natal Estates sugar plantation at Mount Edgecombe in Natal.

====Standard gauge====

The third locomotive of the Natal Railway Company was delivered in January 1876, sixteen years after the opening of the railway. It was a 4-4-0 side tank engine, built by Kitson &amp; Company and named &quot;Perseverance&quot;. This was the last standard gauge locomotive to be obtained by the Natal Railway Company before the establishment of the Natal Government Railways in 1877 and the conversion from Standard gauge to .

====Cape gauge====

Seven side-tank locomotives were built for the Cape Government Railways (CGR) by Robert Stephenson &amp; Company in 1875. Since they were found to be fast and reliable engines, four more were delivered in 1880, built by Neilson &amp; Company and practically identical to the previous seven, but equipped with small optional four-wheeled water tenders. They were all designated 1st Class when a locomotive classification system was introduced by the CGR.

In 1879, the Cape Government Railways placed four 1st Class tender locomotives in service, built by the Avonside Engine Company. They were intended for fast passenger service on the Cape Western and Eastern systems and were followed by eleven more from Neilson &amp; Company in 1880.

In 1881, the CGR placed six more 1st Class tank-and-tender locomotives in service on its Cape Midland system. These were built by Neilson &amp; Company as tender locomotives without on-board coal bunkers and with permanently attached coal and water tenders. Two of them became South African Railways class 01 in 1912.
Between 1882 and 1891, eleven tank locomotives for the Wynberg suburban line in Cape Town were delivered to the CGR from Neilson and Dübs &amp; Company. Designated 2nd Class and known as &quot;Wynberg Tanks&quot;, ten of them became South African Railways class 02 in 1912.

In 1882, two tank locomotives named &quot;Grahamstown&quot; and &quot;Bathurst&quot; entered passenger service on the private Kowie Railway between Grahamstown and Port Alfred, which was still under construction at the time.
Eighteen tender passenger locomotives were delivered to the CGR from Neilson &amp; Company in 1883, designated 3rd Class. They were ordered for passenger service out of Cape Town, East London and Port Elizabeth respectively and were equipped with six-wheeled tenders.

In 1884, the CGR placed two experimental 3rd Class tender locomotives in service, designed by the Cape Eastern System to be able to use the low-grade local coal with its high incombustible matter content.

In 1889, the CGR placed 24 3rd Class tender locomotives in service. They were the first stock locomotives to be built in quantity to detailed designs prepared in the Cape of Good Hope.
In 1898, the CGR placed six 3rd Class &quot;Wynberg Tender&quot; locomotives in passenger service on the suburban lines in Cape Town.

In 1901, the CGR placed another six 3rd Class &quot;Wynberg Tender&quot; locomotives in suburban service in Cape Town. They were a heavier and more powerful version of the locomotives of 1898 and were built for speed, with the largest coupled wheels of any locomotive on the CGR to date at diameter.

In 1903, the CGR placed the last eight 3rd Class &quot;Wynberg Tenders&quot; in suburban service in Cape Town. While they appeared to be virtually identical to the locomotives of 1901 at first glance, they were heavier and more powerful.

===United Kingdom===
====Tank locomotives====

4-4-0T classes began to appear on broad-gauge lines in the United Kingdom from 1849. The Great Western Railway built its &quot;Bogie&quot; class saddle tanks for the South Devon Railway in 1849, and others for its own use during 1854 and 1855. Between 1851 and 1876, the South Devon Railway acquired a further six saddle tank classes, and the Vale of Neath Railway a further nine. The Bristol and Exeter Railway introduced several 4-4-0ST classes after 1855.

William Adams built a series of standard gauge 4-4-0T classes for the North London Railway between 1863 and 1876. He went on to build the LSWR 46 Class for the London and South Western Railway in 1879. Other British 4-4-0T types included the A Class of the Metropolitan Railway, built by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company from 1864, and the Highland Railway O Class of 1878 and P class of 1893–94. Also in 1864, John Lambie of the Caledonian Railway built twelve Class 1 4-4-0T locomotives.

====Inside cylinder tender locomotives====

Between 1876 and 1903, Samuel Johnson of the Midland Railway built 350 inside cylinder tender locomotives to various designs, notably the Midland Railway 483 Class. The type was particularly refined by John F. McIntosh of the Caledonian Railway with his &quot;Dunalastair&quot; and &quot;Breadalbane&quot; classes of 1896 to 1898. In addition, Wilson Worsdell of the North Eastern Railway designed six classes between 1896 and 1909. Other notable classes included the London &amp; South Western Railway’s T9 class of 1899 and the London &amp; North Western Railway’s &quot;Precursor&quot; Class of 1904.

From the mid-1890s until after World War I, the inside cylinder 4-4-0 was the standard type for British Express passenger trains, although several classes were also used in mixed-traffic service in later years.
The Great Western Railway (GWR) preferred to retain outside frames on their inside cylinder 4-4-0s. One member of its &quot;City&quot; class, the &quot;City of Truro&quot;, designed by George Jackson Churchward and built at the GWR&#x27;s Swindon Works in 1903, was reputedly the first steam locomotive in Europe to travel in excess of , reaching a speed of on 9 May 1904 while hauling the &quot;Ocean Mails&quot; special from Plymouth to London Paddington.

Although the inside cylinder 4-4-0 had largely been superseded by larger locomotives for mainline express trains by 1920, the type remained in use in Scotland and East Anglia, where lines that could not support heavier or larger locomotives were common. Thus both the Great Eastern Railway’s &quot;Claud Hamilton&quot; classes of 1900 to 1911 and the Great Central Railway’s &quot;Director&quot; classes of 1920 were perpetuated by the London &amp; North Eastern Railway in 1923. Until 1932, the London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway also continued to build its Class 2P of traditional inside cylinder for secondary passenger working.

====Three-cylinder tender locomotives====

Experiments were conducted with three-cylinder compound locomotives by Wilson Worsdell of the North Eastern Railway in 1898, Samuel Johnson of the Midland Railway in 1901 and Francis Webb of the London and North Western Railway. Of these, the development of Johnson&#x27;s design by Richard Deeley of the Midland Railway into the 1000 Class was the most successful. This class continued to be built by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) after 1905, until 1932 with the almost identical LMS Compound 4-4-0.

British three-cylinder simple expansion (simplex) locomotives included Nigel Gresley&#x27;s LNER Class D49 &quot;Hunt&quot; and &quot;Shire&quot; 4-4-0s of 1927–28. However, the most powerful and one of the most successful 4-4-0 designs ever constructed was the &quot;Schools&quot; class of the Southern Railway, designed by Richard Maunsell and built between 1930 and 1935. These were used on secondary express trains between London and South Coast towns, until their withdrawal in 1962.

===United States===

Since the first locomotives in the United States were imported from the United Kingdom, the British was also adopted by the first United States railroads. When new locomotive construction began in the United States in 1831, some new railroads opted for a different gauge, resulting in breaks-of-gauge as railroads began to be joined. Apart from freight reloading issues, another result was that new locomotives for some of these railroads had to be delivered on flatcars.

The 4-4-0 played a major role in the development of rail transport in the United States. Some of the notable 4-4-0 locomotives that saw service on United States railroads are:
* Philadelphia and Reading Railway Company No.
3, built in 1842 by Eastwick &amp; Harrison in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is one of the oldest surviving locomotives of the 4-4-0-wheel arrangement, and the sole surviving 4-4-0 of the Reading Company. 
* The &quot;General&quot;, built in 1855 by Rogers, Ketchum &amp; Grosvenor in Paterson, New Jersey, was the fleeing locomotive during the Great Locomotive Chase of the American Civil War.
* The &quot;Texas&quot;, built in 1856 by Danforth, Cooke &amp; Company in Paterson, New Jersey, was the pursuing locomotive during much of the Great Locomotive Chase.
* The &quot;Jupiter&quot;, Central Pacific Railroad’s No. 60, built by Schenectady Locomotive Works of New York in September 1868, was one of the two locomotives to meet at Promontory Summit during the Golden Spike ceremony upon the completion of the First American Transcontinental Railroad on May 10, 1869. 
* Union Pacific No. 119, built by Rogers Locomotive &amp; Machine Works of Paterson, New Jersey in 1868, was the other locomotive at Promontory Summit on May 10, 1869.
* The Virginia &amp; Truckee Railroad’s &quot;Dayton&quot;, built in 1873 by the Central Pacific Railroad, had the honor of opening the branch line between Carson City and Minden in Nevada in 1906.
* The New York Central and Hudson River Railroad no. 999, built in 1893 to haul the railroad&#x27;s &quot;Empire State Express&quot;, is believed to have been the first in the United States to travel at a speed of more than .
* Walt Disney World Railroad No. 4 &quot;Roy O. Disney&quot;, which was built in February 1916 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works as No. 66 (later No. 251 in the 1960s) for the United Railways of Yucatán in Mexico. It now operates on the railroad circling the Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida. Since January 2024, this locomotive has been shipped to the Strasburg Rail Road for an extensive overhaul.

By 1910, the 4-4-0 was considered obsolete being replaced by Mikados, Pacifics and other larger engines, although they continued to serve to an extent into the 1950s. The last 4-4-0 to be built was a diminutive Baldwin product for the Ferrocarriles Unidos de Yucatán in 1945. Fewer than forty 4-4-0s survive in preservation in the United States, reproductions excluded.

Between 1959 and 1989, the Crown Metal Products Company of Wyano, Pennsylvania built live steam reproductions of classic 4-4-0 designs for use by amusement parks. The largest of these, of which 18 were produced, ran on narrow gauge track. Most are patterned after 19th-century American designs, but those produced for Busch Gardens have European styling. Although Crown Metal Products ceased operations in 1989, many of their locomotives continue to see daily operation at parks such as Kings Island, Worlds of Fun, and the Omaha Zoo Railroad at Omaha&#x27;s Henry Doorly Zoo &amp; Aquarium.

==Operational historic locomotives==
===North America===
There are a handful of full-size 4-4-0 steam locomotives built prior to 1945 that are still operating in the US and Canada. The following is a list of locations with at least one working example and tracks on which to run it.

<text>Jahangir Khan (Pashto, born 10 December 1963) is a former professional Pakistani squash player. He won the World Open title six times, and the British Open title ten times (1982–1991). He is widely regarded as the greatest squash player of all time, and the greatest sportsman in Pakistan history. From 1981 to 1986, Khan was unbeaten and won 555 consecutive matches during that time – the longest winning streak by any athlete in top-level professional sport as recorded by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;.

He retired as a player in 1993, and served as President of the World Squash Federation from 2002 to 2008. Later in 2008, he became Emeritus President of the World Squash Federation.

== Early and personal life ==
Khan was born on 10 December 1963 in Karachi. His family originally hailed from Nawan Kalli, a small village near Peshawar in Pakistan.

A member of the Khan family, he was born into a family of squash players; his father Roshan Khan won the British Open title in 1957, and his older brother was Torsam Khan.

Two of his nieces are Natasha Khan (better known as Bat for Lashes), a British singer, and Maria Khan, a professional footballer who has played for the Pakistan women national football team.

== Career ==
Khan was coached initially by his father Roshan, the 1957 British Open champion, then by his brother Torsam. After his brother&#x27;s sudden death he was coached by his cousin Rehmat, who guided Khan through most of his career.

In 1979, the Pakistan selectors decided not to select Khan to play in the world championships in Australia but he entered the World Amateur Individual Championship, at the age of 15, and became the youngest-ever winner of that event. In November 1979, Torsam Khan, who had been one of the leading international squash players in the 1970s, died suddenly of a heart attack during Australian Open match in Adelaide Australia. Torsam&#x27;s death profoundly affected Khan. He considered quitting the game, but decided to pursue a career in the sport as a tribute to his brother.

He retired as a player in 1993, and has served as President of the World Squash Federation from 2002 to 2008, later became Emeritus President.

<doc id="1057860" wikidata="Q3271057" url="?curid=1057860" title="Andøya Air Station">
<text>Andøya Air Station () is a military air station in Andøy Municipality in Nordland county, Norway. The station is located near the village of Andenes at the northern end of the island of Andøya in the Vesterålen archipelago. 333 Squadron of the Royal Norwegian Air Force was based here with Lockheed P-3C Orions. As of Q2 2024, the government has made a proposal in regard to reverting an earlier decision to close the airbase.

The civil airport Andøya Airport, Andenes and the civilian sounding rocket launch facility Andøya Rocket Range are also located nearby.

==History==
The first idea of building a military airport was launched at a NATO meeting in Lisbon in 1951. In March 1952 the Norwegian Minister of Defence, Nils Langhelle announced that the airport was going to be built. There were multiple suggested locations, and the decision fell on the village Haugnes. The entire village with 310 residents was expropriated to give enough area for the airport. The community at Andøy only had 2000 residents at the time, and a large growth was expected.

A Douglas Dakota was the first aircraft landing on September 17, 1954. The air station was operational from the fall of 1957. The headquarters were located about 13 km away at Skarsteindalen, as part of NATOs spread tactic. In 1961 the first squadron, the 333, was moved to the air station, from Sola Air Station, with HU-16B Albatross aircraft.

After a period of solely military use, civilian services commenced on April 2, 1964. The first scheduled commercial flight was flown by Scandinavian Airlines with a Metropolitan. In 1968 the second runway was completed. In the 1970s the airport became part of the new network of regional airports in Lofoten and Vesterålen with government subsidised operations using de Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft seating 20 and operated by Widerøe.

In 1969 the Albatrosses were replaced by P-3B Orion aircraft. The P-3B lacked the ability to work with the Norwegian Coast Guard, and in 1989 they were sold to the Spanish Air Force. They were replaced with new P-3C aircraft. Following the end of the Cold War in the 1990s the air station has been reduced.

The Norwegian parliament decided in November 2016 to close the air station. Prior to 30 June 2023, the station was the base for the 333 squadron. Since 30 June 2023, that squadron operates from Evenes Air Station. According to a white paper from the Defense Ministry in 2022, Andøya will be a “permanent military reception base for allied forces.”

==Accidents and incidents==
* On February 1, 1982, a Lockheed SR-71, tail number 980, diverted to the airport. It stayed there four days before being flown out.
* On July 31, 1988, four people died when a private Cessna 172 aircraft crashed west of the airport just after takeoff.

<text>Louis Fleury (24 May 1878 – 10 June 1926) was a French flautist, a student and colleague of Paul Taffanel, a writer who advocated for the revival of Baroque music, and a musician who promoted contemporary composers by commissioning and performing their work.

Less well-known today than some of his fellow flute players, such as Philippe Gaubert and Marcel Moyse, perhaps because he died at a relatively young age, did not establish a teaching studio and left no known recordings, Fleury may be best remembered for his association with one of the most important works in the repertoire for solo flute, &quot;Syrinx&quot; by Claude Debussy. The piece, originally titled &quot;La Flûte de Pan&quot;, was dedicated to Fleury, who performed its premiere in 1913.

==Early life and education==
Louis François Fleury was born on 24 May 1878 in Lyon to Alphonse François Fleury and Antoinette Donadille Fleury. The family often visited Paris, taking Louis to the theater and the opera.

Writing about his early exposure to music, Fleury recalled, &quot;My first lesson in music was given me by a schoolmaster in the little country village where I passed my youth. The poor fellow knew nothing of music [...] but he thought it best not to refuse the chance of making a little extra money, so he taught me to sing the &quot;Marseillaise&quot;, the only tune he knew.&quot; When he was twelve, Fleury was given a piccolo; displaying an aptitude for the instrument, he was later given a Boehm flute. His instructor on the piccolo was a barber, and on the flute, a pharmacist who was also an amateur flutist.

In 1893 the family moved to Paris to allow Louis to continue his musical training. Fleury made his professional debut in September 1894, playing a duet for two flutes with Georges Barrère. He was accepted into the studio of Paul Taffanel, the professor of flute at the Paris Conservatory, in 1895, after his second audition. He studied with Taffanel for five years, receiving a &quot;premier prix&quot; in 1900, performing that year&#x27;s &quot;morceau de concours&quot;, &quot;Sixième solo de concours&quot;, op. 85, by Jules Demersseman.

Taffanel kept notes on the progress of his students. In 1897 he wrote &quot;Very impressionable by nature. Good feeling for music.&quot; In 1900 he observed that Fleury had made &quot;Very marked progress. Refined and musical by nature. Has virtually conquered his nervousness. Excellent student.&quot;

==Performance career==
While still studying at the conservatory, Fleury played in the orchestras of the Folies-Bergere and the Folies Dramatique. Later he played with the Association des Grands Concerts, led by Reynaldo Hahn, Concerts Berlioz, conducted by Pierre Monteaux, and the Concerts Cortot. But his interest shifted from orchestra participation to solo and small ensemble performances.

In 1902 Fleury joined Barrère&#x27;s chamber ensemble, (SMIV), as second flute. By 1903 Fleury was touring as a soloist throughout Europe. He was particularly popular in England, where he appeared in over forty concerts between 1905 and 1925, the first on 16 October 1905 with Dame Nellie Melba. He made his first visit to the United States with soprano Emma Calvé on her 45-city tour in 1905–06. He provided obbligato accompaniment for Calvé&#x27;s solos (as he had for Melba) and performed works by Handel and Mozart with other members of the touring company.
In 1905 Fleury assumed leadership of the SMIV when Barrère left to take a position with the New York Symphony Orchestra. The following year he founded the Société de Concerts d&#x27;autrefois, an ensemble dedicated to performing music of the 17th and 18th centuries on period instruments. (Although Fleury continued to play his Boehm instrument rather than a baroque flute.) 
Fleury&#x27;s most well-known performance occurred on 1 December 1913. Claude Debussy had composed a piece for unaccompanied flute as incidental music for the third act of Gabriel Mourey&#x27;s play, &quot;Psyché&quot;. At the premiere of the play, held in the music salon of arts patron Louis Mors, Fleury played, from offstage, &quot;La Flûte de Pan&quot;. Reviews of the music were positive. Critic Georges Casella wrote in &quot;Comœdia&quot;: Another critic wrote: Fleury kept the manuscript to himself; no one else performed the piece during his lifetime. Re-titled &quot;Syrinx&quot;, it was published in 1927, after Fleury&#x27;s death, and became recognized as the seminal flute solo of the twentieth century.

Fleury&#x27;s concert career was interrupted by World War I. After entering the army, he became part of Fernand Halphen&#x27;s first military orchestra (August 1914 – December 1915), which performed for the troops and for the local populace. Halphen, who had also studied at the Paris Conservatory, added selections of classical music to the standard repertoire of marches, dances and patriotic songs, which gave Fleury opportunities for solos. The orchestra disbanded when the soldier-musicians were reassigned to other units.

After the war, Fleury returned to touring and writing, promoting Baroque music along with contemporary French music. By 1924, the SMIV had premiered &quot;no less than &quot;one hundred and twenty-five works&quot; [...] and revived all the classical or modern works of any importance.&quot; Danielle Gaudry, writing about the history of early chamber wind ensembles, notes: &quot;At this point, it seemed that virtually every major French composer in succeeding generations would be interested in contributing something to the growing repertoire of chamber wind music.&quot; 
==Writing and editing==
Fleury credited Taffanel with rekindling interest in early music, which was then seldom programmed in France. Fleury contributed to this revival by editing new editions of Baroque works for flute by Michel Blavet, Händel, Loeillet, Vinci, Naudot and others. He did not always strive for historic accuracy. Graham Sadler, in his preface to the 1992 Boosey &amp; Hawkes edition of the Blavet sonatas, states:

Fleury contributed articles to a number of journals, primarily on the flute and French music. Edward Blakeman writes:

Taffanel had spent many years gathering material for a comprehensive survey of the flute, its history, performers and repertoire, but he died before he could finish writing it. His widow, Geneviève Taffanel, and editor, Albert Lavignac, entrusted Fleury, who had been collaborating with Taffanel, to complete the article, which was published in the &quot;Encyclopédie de la musique et dictionnaire du Conservatoire&quot;.

==Personal life==
On 24 December 1907 Fleury married Jeanne Marie Gabrielle Monchablon, the daughter of painter Alphonse Monchablon. Gabrielle was already a well-known pianist and harpsichordist. She and her husband often performed together; she was usually billed as Mme. Fleury-Monchablon. They had one daughter, Antoinette, whose godmother was Gabrielle&#x27;s good friend, the composer Mel Bonis.

Fleury died suddenly in Paris on 10 June 1926, of blood poisoning. A memorial concert was held on 6 November 1926 at Kent House, the London home of Mr. and Mrs. Saxton Noble, to benefit the education of Fleury&#x27;s sixteen-year-old daughter, who was studying piano in Paris.

<text>H&amp;C Communications was a corporation that owned a number of media outlets throughout the United States. Originally known as Channel 2 Television Company, a reference to the channel number of flagship station KPRC-TV, it was created in 1983 to unite the Hobby family&#x27;s television &amp; radio interests under one umbrella after the &quot;Houston Post&quot;, their flagship business, was sold. The family became involved in broadcasting in the mid-1920s.

==Beginnings==
In 1923, Ross Sterling Jr. took a course on broadcasting at the YMCA in Houston. His father, Ross Sterling Sr., met the instructor, Alfred P. Daniel (of now-discontinued radio station WCAK), and discussed starting a new radio station affiliated with the &quot;Houston Post&quot;. William P. Hobby, the president and publisher of the &quot;Post&quot;, asked Sterling to launch the radio station. Before a 500 watt transmitter ordered from the Westinghouse Electric Manufacturing Co. arrived in Houston, Sterling Jr. died. Sterling Sr., mourning the loss of his son, put the still crated transmitter in storage. Over one year later, Daniel approached Sterling Sr. and asked about proceeding with the establishment of the radio station. Sterling Sr. agreed with the idea and moved forward with establishing the station. KPRC&#x27;s first broadcast occurred on Saturday May 9, 1925, with Daniel as the station&#x27;s first announcer and program director. The federal license granting permission for radio broadcasts on 920 kHz was issued on the 13th of May. (In 1941, KPRC moved to its current frequency of 950 kHz under terms of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement.)

==Houston Cluster==
On December 24, 1946, KPRC-FM (now 99.1 KODA) signed on the air. On June 1, 1950, the Hobbys purchased KLEE-TV Channel 2 and changed the television station&#x27;s call letters on July 3, 1950, to KPRC-TV to create an AM-FM-TV combination. The television station had signed on the air on January 1, 1949, as KLEE-TV. It was Houston&#x27;s first television station and the second one to sign on in Texas, three months behind Fort Worth station WBAP-TV (now KXAS-TV) and over eight months ahead of Dallas station KBTV (now WFAA). It was originally owned by hotelier W. Albert Lee and carried programming from all four networks of the day – NBC, CBS, ABC, and DuMont. After a year of difficulty, Lee sold the station to the Hobby family.

After the Hobbys took over, Channel 2 became a primary NBC affiliate due to KPRC-AM radio&#x27;s longstanding affiliation with the NBC Red Network, a link that remains today. Due to the Federal Communications Commission-imposed freeze on new station licenses, Channel 2 remained the only television station in Houston for four more years. CBS moved to KGUL-TV (channel 11, now KHOU) in 1953 and KTRK-TV (channel 13) took over the ABC affiliation when it signed on one year later. DuMont ceased operations in 1956, though it was briefly affiliated with now-defunct KNUZ-TV (channel 39, frequency now occupied by KIAH).

==Expansion to Liquidation==
In 1958, the FM station was sold. In 1975, the Channel 2 Television Company acquired their second TV station, WLAC-TV, the CBS affiliate in Nashville, TN from Houston-based insurer American General Corporation. American General bought Life and Casualty Insurance Company of Tennessee in the 1960s and the acquisition included the WLAC-AM-FM-TV station assets. On December 1, 1975, the TV station adopted the current WTVF call sign due to an FCC rule in place at the time forbidding TV and radio stations in the same city, but with different owners, from sharing the same call letters.

More TV stations across the United States were acquired by the company within the next few years. In 1983, after the &quot;Post&quot; was sold, the Hobby family&#x27;s broadcast holdings were reorganized into H&amp;C Communications. The Hobbys began to liquidate their broadcasting assets in 1992. An attempt to sell stations in Houston, San Antonio, Orlando, Tucson and Des Moines to Young Broadcasting that year was unsuccessful. On April 22, 1994 the Texas stations, flagship KPRC-TV in Houston and KSAT-TV in San Antonio were sold to Post-Newsweek Stations (now Graham Media Group), a division of the Washington Post Company (now Graham Holdings Company).

In 1994, the Hobby family fully relinquished control and by the end of 1995, the H&amp;C stations were liquidated to various owners and the company was eventually dissolved.

<doc id="1057879" wikidata="Q4386210" url="?curid=1057879" title="Frog (Chrono Trigger)">
<text>, also known as Glenn, is a fictional character in the 1995 video game &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;. He was designed by the game&#x27;s artist, Akira Toriyama. He is an anthropomorphic frog knight from the Middle Ages era who was cursed into the form by his nemesis, Magus. He was born as a human by the name Glenn and a friend of the late brave knight Cyrus. After witnessing Cyrus&#x27; death at the hands of Magus and being transformed into a frog, Frog vowed to avenge Cyrus by killing Magus. During the game, he obtains the Masamune (Grandleon in the Japanese version), an ancient sword whose offensive capabilities against magic users is Magus&#x27; major weakness. Frog wields a broadsword and can also learn &quot;Water&quot; and, like Marle, healing magic.

Frog&#x27;s design in the final version of the game replaces that of a monster man character from the initial character sketches. Frog has received generally positive reception, with discussion by critics about the relationship between Frog and Magus. His dialogue was also the subject of discussion, particularly how he speaks compared to others in his time period.

==Concept and creation==
Frog is a half-man, half-frog in the video game &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; who was cursed with this form by one of the game&#x27;s antagonists, Magus, against whom he seeks revenge. Frog originally came from a desire of the staff to use a non-human character due to Square thinking it would make battles more interesting. They considered a pig or monkey concept, but went with a frog because the staff felt they&#x27;d be too similar to humans. Frog initially started off as a sketch that lacked detail and finesse created by Yuji Horii, who then gave it to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; artist Akira Toriyama. He was identified as a favorite by multiple &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; designers, including field designers Yasuyuki Honne and Akiyoshi Masuda. &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; director Takashi Tokita regarded the ending where Frog and Magus do battle to be one of the best endings in &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;.

In the Japanese version of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, Frog&#x27;s manner of speech is that of a &quot;strong, independent, disciplined man,&quot; speaking in a way that tends to be &quot;slightly more complicated&quot; than most people. The English version of the game saw Frog given Elizabethan Olde English dialogue. The Nintendo DS version of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; dropped the Elizabethan dialogue for Frog.

==Appearances==
In &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, Frog is a knight found in the Medieval era of 600 AD. He has multiple goals; his main goal is to defeat the wizard Magus, who has been at war with his kingdom, for turning him into a frog and for killing his mentor, Cyrus. When the player first meets Frog, he is attempting to rescue Queen Leene, who had been kidnapped by Magus&#x27; forces, and he joins with Crono and Lucca. After rescuing Leene (and in turn her descendant, Marle), he departs from the group. Frog, once Crono is able to get the legendary sword Masamune repaired and delivered to him, assists them in their fight against Magus, which ultimately sends them into the past after Magus summons the game&#x27;s main antagonist, Lavos. When Frog reencounters Magus in 12,000 BC, he is given the option to do battle with Magus. If he does, Magus is defeated. If he does not, Magus joins the party. During an optional quest, Frog can lay his mentor to rest, which causes the Masamune to become the Masamune II. Frog is able to assist the party in defeating Lavos, which prevents the world from being destroyed in 1999 AD.

While Frog does not appear in the sequel, &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;, another character, Glenn, shares multiple elements, including their name, weapon of choice, and special skill. In &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;, a character inspired by Frog was included.

Frog is featured as part of a series of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; figures.

==Reception==
&quot;Game Informer&quot; writer Jeff Cork felt that Frog, along with Magus, was among the coolest characters in &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, commenting about how intense a dilemma there was between allowing Frog to defeat Magus and allowing Magus to join the party. &quot;TechRaptor&quot; writer Robert Grosso similarly discussed the significance of the relationship between Frog and Magus, describing them as &quot;mirror foils&quot; while noting how Frog fits the warrior archetype while Magus fits the black mage archetype. He stated that the two are both driven by revenge, Frog for Magus and Magus for Lavos, noting how Frog tends to push people away and take on his revenge as a solitary act of penance so he doesn&#x27;t lose anyone else. He felt that the option to spare Magus reflected Frog&#x27;s character growth, preventing him from being consumed by revenge. The moment when Frog first joins Crono&#x27;s party was regarded as one of the best first encounters in a video game by &quot;IGN&quot; writer Marty Sliva, who felt that he was &quot;possibly [his] favorite character in what&#x27;s probably [his] favorite RPG.&quot; He attributed this to his theme, as well as the sheer power of Frog when compared to other characters in the game at that point. Author Fredrik Norman discussed various themes they felt were employed with Frog, including how his various traits impact his journey through an &quot;existential maze.&quot; He also discussed Frog in the context of Magus, arguing that both are &quot;always doomed to fail&quot; and that there is an &quot;inevitable gloom&quot; at the center of revenge.

Regarding the relocalization of Frog&#x27;s dialogue in &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; on the DS, &quot;Siliconera&quot; staff felt that the original English translation made Frog&#x27;s dialogue better, recommending a patch of the DS version to change the localization back. Writer Michael P. Williams found his manner of speech charming but &quot;grammatically suspect,&quot; noting how he is the only character in his time period who speaks like that. He further points out that even when he was a human he didn&#x27;t speak this way, suggesting he does so because of a desire to be more heroic. He stated that everything about Frog &quot;oozes hero,&quot; discussing how Frog aspires to be like Cyrus which is &quot;realized heteronormatively as a desire to protect Queen Leene.&quot; A writer for &quot;RPGFan&quot; picked Frog as his favorite character from &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, stating that it was one of the first times he became emotionally invested in a video game character. He felt that his appearance in the intro, where he departs from Cyrus&#x27; grave and walking away resolute, while &quot;standard and tropey,&quot; was made all the better due to his frog design created by Toriyama.

<doc id="1057884" wikidata="Q923972" url="?curid=1057884" title="Maxime Faget">
<text>Maxime Allen &quot;Max&quot; Faget (pronounced &quot;fah-ZHAY&quot;; August 26, 1921 – October 9, 2004) was an American mechanical engineer. Faget was the designer of the Mercury spacecraft, and contributed to the later Gemini and Apollo spacecraft as well as the Space Shuttle.

== Life ==
Faget was the son of American doctor Guy Henry Faget, and great-grandson of another prominent physician, Jean Charles Faget. Born in Stann Creek Town, British Honduras (today Dangriga, Belize), he attended City College of San Francisco in San Francisco, California, and he received a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from Louisiana State University in 1943.

After three years as a submariner aboard in the U.S. Navy, Faget joined the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia as a research scientist. While working for NACA at Langley, he worked on the design of the X-15 hypersonic spacecraft.

In 1958, Faget became one of the 35 engineers who formed the Space Task Group, creating the Mercury spacecraft. He based his designs on the aerodynamic work of Harvey Allen from the mid-1950s, and was instrumental in selecting the blunt-body shape that won the Mercury competition over numerous contenders. He led the development of the escape tower system used on Mercury, which was used in various forms on almost all following crewed spacecraft. He also worked on the Gemini and Apollo vehicles, which shared many design points with the Mercury.

Faget filed a patent for a space shuttle vehicle design in 1972. His design, which he named &quot;DC-3&quot; in homage to the famed Douglas DC-3 airliner, was a small two-stage fully reusable shuttle with a payload capacity around . DC-3 was officially studied by North American Aviation and shown in the press as a baseline contender for the Space Transportation System (STS). North American also studied a version of the same basic system with a much larger payload. However, the DC-3&#x27;s nose-high re-entry profile was controversial, and eventually doomed it when the U.S. Air Force joined the Shuttle program and demanded cross-range performance that the DC-3 could not meet. In the end, its most lasting contribution was to clearly identify the trade-offs inherent in any reusable design.

In 1962 Faget became the Director of Engineering and Development at the Manned Spacecraft Center and continued to work for NASA until his retirement in 1981, shortly after the second Space Shuttle flight (STS-2). After his retirement, he was among the founders of Space Industries Inc., established in 1982. One of the projects of the company was the Wake Shield Facility, a device to create near-perfect vacuum in the thermosphere. The WSF flew three times with a Space Shuttle in 1994–96 (STS-60, STS-69, STS-80).

In 1962, Faget received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Faget was inducted into the 1969 National Inventors Hall of Fame, and received the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal and John J. Montgomery Award. He was inducted into the Houston National Space Hall of Fame in 1969. He was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1990. Faget was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2020.

Faget died of bladder cancer on October 9, 2004, aged 83.

==Patents==
Faget was co-inventor on five United States patents issued to Space Industries, Inc. between 1988 and 1992:

==MAX-1 spacecraft==
The private spaceflight organization Copenhagen Suborbitals was developing a piloted spacecraft named after Faget, the MAX-1, but the project was halted due to issues around the effects of rapid acceleration of humans in a standing position.

<doc id="1057887" wikidata="Q242351" url="?curid=1057887" title="Ivana Trump">
<text>Ivana Marie Trump (; February 20, 1949 – July 14, 2022) was a Czech-American businesswoman, socialite, and model. She lived in Canada in the 1970s, before relocating to the United States and marrying Donald Trump in 1977. She held key managerial positions in the Trump Organization, as vice president of interior design, CEO and president of Trump&#x27;s Castle casino resort, and manager of the Plaza Hotel.

Ivana and Donald Trump were prominent figures in New York society throughout the 1980s. The couple&#x27;s divorce, granted in 1990, was the subject of extensive media coverage. Following the divorce, she developed her own lines of clothing, fashion jewelry, and beauty products which were sold on QVC UK and the Home Shopping Network. She wrote an advice column for &quot;Globe&quot; called &quot;Ask Ivana&quot; from 1995 through 2010, and published several books, including works of fiction, self-help, and the autobiography &quot;Raising Trump&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Ivana Marie Zelníčková was born on February 20, 1949, in Gottwaldov, Czechoslovakia (now Zlín, Czech Republic), the daughter of Miloš Zelníček (1927- 1990) and Marie Zelníčková (née Francová, b. 1926). She was raised in a Catholic household. Her father was an electrical engineer and her mother worked as a telephone operator. Her father encouraged his daughter&#x27;s skiing abilities, a practice she began at age four. After developing skills as a skier, Ivana joined the junior national ski team, which offered her opportunities to travel beyond the Soviet-era communist boundaries of what was then the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. She attended Charles University in Prague and earned a master&#x27;s degree in physical education in 1972. In 1970, Ivana appeared on Czechoslovak Television in the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Pan Tau&quot;.

In 1988, Ivana told journalists that she was selected as an alternate on the Czechoslovak ski team during the 1972 Winter Olympics, specializing in downhill and slalom. However, Czechoslovakia only sent four female athletes to the 1972 Winter Olympics and none were alpine skiers. In 1989, Petr Pomezný, Secretary General of the Czechoslovak Olympic Committee, denied Ivana&#x27;s claim and stated that, despite searching extensively, no record could be found of her involvement. In 2021, Snopes confirmed that Czechoslovakia had not sent female alpine skiers to the 1972 Winter Olympics.

== Emigration to Canada ==
In 1971, Ivana married Alfred Winklmayr, an Austrian ski instructor and her platonic friend, in order to obtain Austrian citizenship. The marriage granted her the freedom to leave Czechoslovakia without defection so she could retain the right to return to visit her parents. As Ivana Winklmayr, she received her Austrian passport in March 1972. The following year, she obtained an absentee divorce from Alfred Winklmayr in Los Angeles, California, where he had moved to teach skiing.

Ivana was romantically involved with the lyricist and playwright who was killed in a car accident in 1973. After Štaidl&#x27;s death, Ivana moved to Canada where she lived with George (Jiří) Syrovátka whom she had dated since 1967; Syrovátka had defected to Canada in 1971 and owned a ski boutique in Montreal. She claimed at the time to be married to Syrovátka, though the two never wed. Ivana worked as a ski instructor while living in Canada. She lived in Montreal for two years where she continued to improve her English via night courses at McGill University. Working as a model, Ivana told the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; in 1975 that she considered modelling to be a job, rather than a career. Her modelling clients included Eaton&#x27;s department store and the fashion designer Auckie Sanft, along with promotional work for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal.

== Marriage to Donald Trump ==

Ivana was in New York City with a group of models in 1976 when she met Donald Trump. On April 9, 1977, the couple married at Marble Collegiate Church in a wedding officiated by Norman Vincent Peale. They became tabloid figures in New York society during the 1980s and worked together on several large projects, including the Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, the renovation of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York City, and the construction of the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

During the marriage, Ivana and Donald had three children: Donald Jr. (born 1977), Ivana (Ivanka) Marie (born 1981), and Eric (born 1984). Donald Jr. learned to speak fluent Czech (with the help of his maternal grandfather), while Ivanka gained only a basic understanding of her mother&#x27;s native tongue, and Eric was not exposed to the language since his grandparents were comfortable using English.

A reviewer of the 2018 Netflix documentary miniseries on Donald, &quot;,&quot; described Ivana as a &quot;charismatic workaholic, a career woman, an equal&quot;, and a life partner deliberately chosen by Trump to &quot;work beside him and challenge him.&quot;

The Trumps&#x27; troubled marriage became the subject of public interest over the Christmas holiday in 1989 when—on vacation in Aspen, Colorado—they were observed fighting after Ivana encountered Donald&#x27;s mistress Marla Maples. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that by February 1990, Donald had locked Ivana out of her office at the Plaza Hotel, and a legal battle ensued over the legitimacy of the four prenuptial agreements the pair had successively negotiated over the years.

In October 1990, Ivana&#x27;s 63-year-old father, Miloš Zelníček, died suddenly from a heart attack. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, her father was an informer for Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Státní bezpečnost (StB) intelligence service who relayed information from his daughter, including a correct prediction that George H. W. Bush would win the 1988 presidential election. Despite their marital troubles and pending divorce, Donald stood at her side at her father&#x27;s funeral in Zlín held in November 1990.

The Trumps&#x27; divorce proceedings received worldwide publicity. Front-page coverage appeared in New York tabloid newspapers for eleven days in a row, and the story was the subject of gossip columnist Liz Smith&#x27;s entire news coverage for three months. In a deposition relating to their divorce, Ivana accused Donald of rape. In Harry Hurt III&#x27;s book &quot;Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump&quot;, she confirmed that she had &quot;felt violated&quot;. However, in a statement provided by Donald and his lawyers, she said that she had used the word &quot;rape&quot;, but she did not &quot;want [her] words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.&quot; The uncontested divorce was granted in December 1990 on the grounds of cruel and inhumane treatment by Donald. Ivana had to sign a non-disclosure agreement as a condition of the divorce settlement, and she was required to seek Donald&#x27;s permission before publicly discussing their marriage. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 1991 that Ivana&#x27;s divorce settlement included $14 million, a 45-room Connecticut mansion, an apartment in the Trump Plaza, and the use of Mar-a-Lago for one month a year.

==Career==
During her marriage to Donald, Ivana took on major roles in The Trump Organization, working as a senior executive for seven years, including executive vice president for interior design. She led the interior design of Trump Tower with its signature pink marble. Ivana was appointed CEO and president of the Trump Castle Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, later becoming the manager of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan.

===Business ventures===
Soon after the divorce, Ivana developed lines of clothing, fashion jewelry, and beauty products which have been sold through television shopping channels, including the Home Shopping Network and QVC London. In 1995, she presided over the House of Ivana, a fashion and fragrance company with a showroom located on Park Avenue in New York.

In 1998, she pursued business interests in Croatia (a vacation destination her parents frequently visited), which included the purchase of 33% of the nation&#x27;s second largest daily newspaper, Polo+10.

The Ivana-branded Bentley Bay development in Miami, Florida, filed for bankruptcy in 2004. The following year, she was involved in several proposed condominium projects, including the never-built Ivana Las Vegas.

In 2010, she sued Finnish fashion company Ivana Helsinki, accusing it of selling women&#x27;s clothing that incorporated her name without permission.

===Writing===
Ivana wrote several books, including &quot;For Love Alone&quot; (1992), &quot;Free to Love&quot;, (1993) and a self-help book called &quot;The Best Is Yet to Come: Coping with Divorce and Enjoying Life Again&quot; (1995). Trump wrote an advice column about love and life for &quot;Globe&quot;, titled Ask Ivana, from June 1995 through January 2010.

In February 1999, Ivana launched her own lifestyle magazine titled &quot;Ivana&#x27;s Living in Style&quot;. She contributed an advice column for &quot;Divorce Magazine&quot; in 2001.

Ivana released an autobiography, &quot;Raising Trump&quot;, in 2017. It covered her own upbringing and the early years of raising her children with Donald.

==Media appearances==
Ivana and Donald made several appearances together on television programs including &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in April 1988, followed by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Wogan&quot; in May 1988. After her divorce from Donald, Ivana was interviewed by Barbara Walters for ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot;. In 1991, Donald cut off her alimony payments after the interview and announced his intention to sue Ivana for monetary damages. She returned to &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in 1992 with the message, &quot;I will not let men dominate me anymore.&quot;

Ivana had a cameo role in the Hollywood film &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; (1996) with the line, &quot;Ladies, you have to be strong and independent. And remember: don&#x27;t get mad, get everything.&quot; She was the host of a reality TV special titled &quot;Ivana Young Man&quot;, which aired on Oxygen Network in 2006. In the reality dating program, she helped a wealthy, middle-aged woman find a younger partner. In 2010, Trump appeared in UK television series, &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 7&quot;, which she placed 7th.

== Personal life ==
Ivana was married four times. Her first marriage, to Alfred Winklmayr, was for the goal of securing Austrian nationality.

Ivana was married to Donald Trump from 1977 to 1990, and they had three children, Donald Jr. in 1977, Ivanka in 1981, and Eric in 1984. She became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988.

Ivana married Italian entrepreneur and international businessman Riccardo Mazzucchelli in November 1995. They divorced in 1997. That same year, she filed a $15 million breach of contract suit against Mazzucchelli for violating the confidentiality clause in their prenuptial agreement, while Mazzucchelli sued Ivana and her ex-husband Donald in a British court for libel. The suit was later settled on undisclosed terms.

In the summer of 1997, she began dating Italian aristocrat Count Roffredo Gaetani dell&#x27;Aquila d&#x27;Aragona Lovatelli. Their relationship continued until his death in 2005.

Ivana dated Italian actor and model Rossano Rubicondi for six years before they married on April 12, 2008. The marriage to Rubicondi, 36, was the fourth for Ivana, who was 23 years his senior at the age of 59. The couple&#x27;s $3 million wedding for 400 guests was hosted by ex-husband Donald at Mar-a-Lago with daughter Ivanka as her maid of honor. The wedding was officiated by Ivana&#x27;s ex-sister-in-law Judge Maryanne Trump Barry. Although Ivana and Rubicondi divorced less than a year later, their on-again, off-again relationship continued until 2019, when Ivana announced they had once again &quot;called it quits&quot;. Rubicondi died on October 29, 2021, at the age of 49, reportedly from melanoma.

Ivana had 10 grandchildren. In the late 2010s, she reportedly split her time between New York City, Miami, and Saint-Tropez. She stated she was fluent in Czech, English, German, French, and Russian.

== FBI inquiry ==
On February 14, 1989, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) headquarters in Washington, D.C., recommended a preliminary inquiry into Trump&#x27;s connections to Czechoslovakia based on information from a confidential source. The inquiry was initiated by the FBI New York Field Office the following week, and is reported to have spanned at least two years. In March 2023, it was revealed that Ivana was investigated by the FBI&#x27;s counterintelligence division into allegations connected to her native Czechoslovakia.

==Death==
On July 14, 2022, aged 73, Ivana died of blunt impact injuries to the torso after falling down stairs at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Her ex-husband, U.S. President Donald Trump, and their three children, alongside a number of politicians and celebrities, posted condolences on social media. Her funeral was held on July 20 at the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer, a Catholic church near her home. Ivana was buried at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in Bedminster, New Jersey.

Ivana left behind an estate worth $34 million. In her will, the majority of her assets were to be divided among Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric. Other beneficiaries include personal friend Evelyne Galet and the family&#x27;s former nanny, Dorothy Curry.

<doc id="1057890" wikidata="Q5038733" url="?curid=1057890" title="Cardiovascular centre">
<text>The cardiovascular centre is a part of the human brain which regulates heart rate through the nervous and endocrine systems. It is considered one of the vital centres of the medulla oblongata.

== Structure ==
The cardiovascular centre, or cardiovascular center, is part of the medulla oblongata of the brainstem. Normally, the heart beats without nervous control. In some situations, such as exercise, and major trauma, the cardiovascular centre is responsible for altering heart rate. It also mediates respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

== Function ==
The cardiovascular centre responds to a variety of types of sensory information, such as:
* change of blood pH, detected by central chemoreceptors.
* change of blood pH, detected by peripheral chemoreceptors in the aortic bodies and in the carotid bodies.
* change of blood pressure, detected by arterial baroreceptors in the aortic arch and the carotid sinuses.
* various other inputs from the hypothalamus, thalamus, and cerebral cortex.

The cardiovascular centre affects changes to the heart rate by sending a nerve impulse to the cardiac pacemaker via two sets of nerves:
* sympathetic fibres, part of the autonomic nervous system, to make heart rate faster.
* the vagus nerve, part of the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system, to lower heart rate.

The cardiovascular centre also increases the stroke volume of the heart (that is, the amount of blood it pumps). These two changes help to regulate the cardiac output, so that a sufficient amount of blood reaches tissues. This function is so significant to normal functioning of the circulatory system that the cardiovascular centre is considered a vital centre of the medulla oblongata.

Hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine can affect the cardiovascular centre and cause it to increase the rate of impulses sent to the sinoatrial node, resulting in faster and stronger cardiac muscle contraction. This increases heart rate.

== Clinical significance ==
Many anaesthetics depress the activity of the cardiovascular center. Phencyclidine may be a useful anaesthetic because it does not impact the cardiovascular center. This also contrasts phencyclidine from many other recreational drugs.

<text>The Nationalist Republican Liberal Movement (, MOLIRENA) is a centre-right conservative-liberal political party in Panama.

==History==
The MOLIRENA was founded on October 21, 1981, by the now-defunct Third Nationalist Party, National Patriotic Coalition, National Liberation Movement and factions that had earlier split off from the National Liberal Party and Republican Party. This party evolved as part of an alliance of traditional, oligarchy-controlled, and primarily conservative organizations that opposed both the government and the military.

According to a Soviet Union news article published in 1988:

The MOLIRENA was aptly called a &#x27;patchwork quilt&#x27; by local journalists. The characteristic feature of the party was the link of the agrarian oligarchy with the commercial bourgeoisie, i.e. a union of the most conservative segments of the country. The names of members of MOLIRENA leaders César Arrocha Graell, Guillermo Arias, and Rene Crespo, who, as members of the government before 1968, took part in the appropriation of almost a billion dollars from the state treasury, were mentioned in the local press in connection with former &#x27;merits.&#x27;
In 1984, the party was part of the Democratic Opposition Alliance (ADO), which lost the presidential and legislative elections following suspected widespread fraud by the military.

During 1987, the party became increasingly involved in confrontations with the government. They openly campaigned—with strikes and street demonstrations, which were violently suppressed—to effect the resignation and removal of General Manuel Noriega, who was accused of drug trafficking, electoral fraud, corruption, and murder.

In May 1989, the MOLIRENA was again part of the Democratic Alliance of Civic Opposition (DAOC) coalition, which supported the presidential candidacy of Guillermo Endara of the Arnulfista Party, after the official ratification of the results following the US military invasion in December. Guillermo Ford became Second Vice-president of the Republic (1989–1994). During this term, Alonso Fernandez Guardia was president of the National Assembly (1991).

For the 1994 Panamanian general election, the party was the main component of the Alliance for Change &#x27;94, with MOLIRENA&#x27;s Rubén Dario Carles as the coalition&#x27;s presidential candidate. He received 171,192 votes (16.05%) and came in fourth.

In 1999, the MOLIRENA was allied with the Union for Panama (ADP) and its candidate Mireya Moscoso.

In 2004, the MOLIRENA was allied with the Vision of the Country (ADP) and its candidate José Miguel Alemán. The party won 8.6% of the popular vote and 4 out of 78 seats.

In 2009, it was allied with the Alliance for Change (ADP) and its candidate Ricardo Martinelli.

In 2014, the MOLIRENA allied with the Democratic Change party, and its candidate Jose Domingo Arias, but ultimately lost the election. Afterward, the MOLIRENA&#x27;s president, Sergio Gonzalez Ruiz, resigned from his post and the presidency fell to San Miguelito legislator Francisco Aleman.

<text>The Weather Prediction Center (WPC), located in College Park, Maryland, is one of nine service centers under the umbrella of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), a part of the National Weather Service (NWS), which in turn is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the U.S. Government. Until March 5, 2013, the Weather Prediction Center was known as the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC). The Weather Prediction Center serves as a center for quantitative precipitation forecasting, medium range forecasting (three to eight days), and the interpretation of numerical weather prediction computer models.

The Weather Prediction Center issues storm summaries on storm systems bringing significant rainfall and snowfall to portions of the United States. They also forecast precipitation amounts for the lower 48 United States for systems expected to impact the country over the next seven days. Advisories are also issued for tropical cyclones which have moved inland, weakened to tropical depression strength, and are no longer the responsibility of the National Hurricane Center. The Weather Prediction Center also acts as the backup office to the National Hurricane Center in the event of a complete communications failure.

Long range climatological forecasts are produced by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC), a branch of the National Weather Service. These include 8–14 day outlooks, monthly outlooks, and seasonal outlooks.

==History==
From the early days of organized weather collection in the United States, a central facility was used to gather and disseminate data. Originally, this task occupied a single room within the United States Army Signal Service in Washington, D.C. Reports were collected via telegraph and general forecasts were made for the country.

While WPC&#x27;s roots lie deep in the past, the organization can be most directly traced to the formation of the Analysis Center by Circular Letter 39-42, signed by Weather Bureau Director Francis W. Reichelderfer on March 5, 1942. Operations began on March 16, 1942, with the unit collocated with the Weather Bureau Central Office at 24th and M Streets NW in Washington, D.C. Initially the unit was sometimes referred to as the Master Analysis Center.

In 1947, the Analysis Center was combined with the Air Force Master Analysis Center and the Navy Weather Central to create the Weather Bureau-Air Force-Navy (WBAN) Analysis Center. Their operations commenced on June 16, 1947, at 24th and M Streets NW. By early 1950 the WBAN Analysis Center consisted of 150 employees. Medium range forecasting was done nationally to 54 hours in the future. Charts and maps were created at this facility for national distribution.

In July 1954, the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit (JNWPU) was created to test out numerical weather prediction (NWP) techniques by computer. This unit co-located with the WBAN analysis center to form the National Weather Analysis Center, which was located in Suitland, Maryland. When the two units merged, the name changed to the National Meteorological Center (NMC) in January 1958. When the JNWPU dissolved in 1961, NMC became an independent organization from Global Weather Central and Fleet Numerical Weather Central. Research and computer processing abilities increased over the years, which allowed for the first global forecast model to run by June 1966. By January 1975, much of the facility, minus the computers, moved to the World Weather Building, located in nearby Camp Springs, Maryland.

NMC changed its name to NCEP, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction on October 1, 1995. The Hydrometeorological Prediction Center became a subunit of NCEP, as did a number of other national centers such as the Climate Prediction Center (CPC), Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), National Hurricane Center (NHC), Ocean Prediction Center (OPC), Storm Prediction Center (SPC), Aviation Weather Center (AWC), NCEP Central Operations, and the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC). During August 2012, HPC moved to a new building, the National Center for Weather and Climate Prediction (NCWCP), in College Park, Maryland. On March 5, 2013, HPC changed its name to the Weather Prediction Center.

==Mission==
The mission of the WPC is to provide forecast, guidance, and analysis products and services to support the daily public forecasting activities of the NWS and its customers, and to provide tailored support to other government agencies in emergency and special situations.

==Products and services==

===Quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPF)===

The QPF desks prepare and issue forecasts of accumulating (quantitative) precipitation, heavy rain, heavy snow, and highlights areas with the potential for flash flooding, with forecasts valid over the following five days. These products are sent to the National Weather Service forecast offices and are available on the Internet for public use. Heavy snow forecast products, in association with the short-range public forecast products (described below), serve as a coordinating mechanism for the national winter storm watch and warning program.

One desk of the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS) is co-located with the WPC QPF desks, which together form the National Precipitation Prediction Unit (NPPU). NESDIS meteorologists prepare estimates of rainfall and current trends based on satellite data, and this information is used by the Day 1 QPF forecaster to help create individual 6-hourly forecasts that cover the next 12 hours. With access to WSR-88D/Doppler weather radar data, satellite estimates, and NCEP model forecast data as well as current weather observations and WPC analyses, the forecaster has the latest data for use in preparation of short-range precipitation forecasts. Meteorological reasoning discussions are regularly written and issued with the forecast packages to explain and support the forecast.

===Winter weather forecasts===
The WPC Winter Weather Desk issues heavy snow and icing forecast products, which support the NWS winter weather watch/warning/outlook program. These forecasts are for the contiguous United States (CONUS) and issued from September 15 to May 15 each cold season. Graphical forecasts are issued twice daily at 0900 UTC and 2100 UTC (4AM/PM EST respectively), although updates may be warranted by rapidly changing conditions.

The Winter Weather Desk issues probabilistic heavy snow and icing guidance products for the next three days. The forecasts represent the probability that freezing rain or combined snow/sleet accumulations will meet specific criteria within a 24-hour period. These products are issued in probabilistic form to better represent the forecast uncertainty associated with a particular event. The Winter Weather Desk produces a heavy snow and icing discussion that provides the meteorological reasoning for the 24-hour probabilistic heavy snow and icing guidance graphics. This text message is used by internal and external clients including NWS field offices, Department of Homeland Security, FEMA, the White House, Department of Commerce, FAA, and the general meteorological community (private sector and the media).

===Graphical short term forecasts===
The short range forecasters are responsible for preparing forecasts for the time period of 6 through 60 hours. These products are issued twice daily using guidance from the NWS&#x27;s Global Forecast System (GFS) and North American Mesoscale Model (NAM), as well as guidance from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the United Kingdom&#x27;s Met Office (UKMET), the Meteorological Service of Canada, including ensembles. Coordination with the surface analysis, model diagnostics, quantitative precipitation, winter weather, and tropical forecast desks is performed during the short range forecast process to maintain internal consistency. The short range forecast products include surface pressure patterns, circulation centers and fronts for 6–60 hours, and a depiction of the types and extent of precipitation that are forecast at the valid time of the chart. In addition, discussions are written on each shift and issued with the forecast packages that highlight the meteorological reasoning behind the forecasts and significant weather across the continental United States.

===Medium range forecasts===

Medium range forecasters are responsible for preparing forecasts for three to seven days into the future. Surface pressure forecasts are issued three times per day, with temperature and probability of precipitation products issued twice per day, using guidance from the NWS medium range forecast model (GFS) as well as models from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF), the United Kingdom&#x27;s Meteorology Office (UKMET), Canadian model, the Navy NOGAPS model, and ensemble guidance from the GFS, ECMWF, Canadian, and North American Ensemble Forecast System (NAEFS).

The medium range forecast products include surface pressure patterns, circulation centers and fronts, daily maximum and minimum temperatures and anomalies, probability of precipitation in 12-hour increments, total 5-day precipitation accumulation for the next five days, and 500 hPa (mb) height forecasts for days 3–7. In addition, a narrative is issued for each set of forecasts highlighting forecast reasoning and significant weather over the Continental United States. Separate forecasts, similar to the 5-day mean products, are prepared for Hawaii.

===Alaska medium range forecasts===
The Alaska medium range forecasters review the latest deterministic and ensemble model guidance (similar to how the broader medium range forecasts are created) in an effort to compose the most likely forecast for Alaska and surrounding areas valid from four to eight days into the future.

The Alaska medium range discussion, 500 hPa height graphics, and surface fronts and pressures graphics for days 4–8 are issued once per day, year-round. Additionally, gridded guidance for the forecast period is issued for the following fields: maximum/minimum temperature grids, twelve-hour probability of precipitation grids, as well as derived dewpoint temperature, cloud cover, precipitation type, and wind speed/direction grids at a horizontal resolution.

===Model diagnostics and interpretation===
The purpose of the WPC Model Diagnostic Discussion is to provide objective information and subjective interpretation concerning the current runs of the NCEP short range numerical models. The WPC model diagnostic meteorologist prepares the Model Diagnostic Discussion twice per day in two parts, corresponding to the 0000 UTC and 1200 UTC model runs. This narrative consists of three sections: an evaluation of the initialization of the NAM and GFS, a review of model trends and biases, and a description of model differences and preferences. The meteorologist reviews how the suite of models from the latest forecast cycle differ from each other in their forecasts of significant features, and makes a preference based upon all relevant current information.

===Surface analysis===

The WPC Surface Analysis is part of the NWS Unified Surface Analysis and a collaborative effort with the Ocean Prediction Center, the National Hurricane Center, and the Honolulu Weather Forecast Office. The WPC focuses on the synoptic and mesoscale features over North America, primarily north of 31N. The surface analysis is a manual analysis of surface fronts and pressure over North America and adjacent oceans performed every three hours. The analysis utilizes a variety of weather data in addition to observations of surface weather conditions, such as upper air observations, global satellite imagery, Doppler weather radar, and model mass fields to ensure that the product is meteorologically consistent.

===Tropical cyclone forecast duties===
The WPC is the official backup center to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). In this capacity, the WPC is responsible for issuing all tropical cyclone products, including discussions, graphics and watches and warnings that would normally be issued by the NHC for any tropical system in the Atlantic Ocean, if NHC is unable to so.

During the tropical weather season which runs from May 15 – November 30, the WPC has several other routine duties pertaining to tropical weather forecasting. Through 2008, WPC provided track forecast guidance to the NHC whenever there is a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean basin west of 60W longitude. As required, this guidance is provided to the NHC four times daily for use in the tropical cyclone package issued by the NHC at 0300 UTC, 0900 UTC, 1500 UTC and 2100 UTC. The WPC participates in the Hurricane Hotline call with the NHC and other forecast offices and government agencies at 1700 UTC for tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean basin west of 60W longitude. Also, points for days 6 and 7 for existing tropical cyclones east of 140W longitude, and days 3–7 to possible future tropical cyclones, are coordinated between the medium range pressures desk and NHC each day at 1700 UTC during the hurricane season. This coordination call began between the Extended Forecast Section and the Miami Hurricane Warning Office prior to 1959.

Within the WPC tropical program, the lead forecaster on shift, who prepares the day 1 QPF, is to provide the rainfall statement for tropical cyclones that are expected to make landfall. This statement is included in the Public Advisory issued by the NHC, and is a forecast of expected rainfall amounts that will occur with the tropical cyclone.

Finally, the WPC surface analysis desk has the responsibility for issuing Public Advisories whenever a tropical cyclone has made landfall in the U.S. or adjacent parts of Mexico, has weakened below tropical storm status (i.e. to a tropical depression or post-tropical cyclone or low) and is not expected to re-emerge over water as a tropical cyclone, yet the system is still capable of producing flooding type rains. This WPC Public Advisory will continue to be issued until the flooding rainfall threat is over. The advisory will contain information on how much rainfall has occurred with a particular tropical system, and will also include forecast information on the remnants of the system. This responsibility has been held by the center since 1973.

===Short-term forecasts (mesoscale discussions)===
Short-term forecasts are made at the meteorological watch (metwatch) desk. It issues mesoscale precipitation discussions (MPDs) as flash flood guidance for NWS forecast offices (NWSFOs), NWS River Forecast Centers (RFCs), the media, emergency managers, and other users. MPDs contain technical discussions concerning heavy rainfall events and expected impacts on flash flooding. They are ideally issued 1–6 hours preceding an event, include graphical descriptions of the details and the area covered. Their size typically is about half the size of Kansas. There are three headlines ordered by severity: &quot;flash flooding likely&quot;, &quot;flash flooding possible&quot;, or &quot;flash flooding unlikely&quot;. Mesoscale discussions (MDs) once were issued by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) for both convective (MCDs) and precipitation (MPDs) events but WPC now covers this heavy rainfall function.

===International desks===
The International desks have a variety of responsibilities, primarily the training of foreign visitors in the use of Numerical Weather Prediction products. The International desk routinely hosts visitors from Central and South America and the Caribbean. Visiting meteorologists train, and also generate forecasts for their own national centers, and assist WPC forecasters with QPF related to tropical cyclones in Central America and the Caribbean.

<text>The Cincinnati Observatory, known locally as Mt. Lookout Observatory, is located in Cincinnati, Ohio (United States) on top of Mount Lookout. It consists of two observatory buildings housing an 11-inch (28 cm) and 16 inch (41 cm) aperture refracting telescope. It is the oldest professional observatory in the United States. It was a key facility for astronomical research and education at the University of Cincinnati and currently operates as a 19th-century observatory. There are regular viewings through both historical telescopes as well as tours and additional programs. The observatory also has an extensive outreach program, providing astronomical education for the Ohio/Kentucky/Indiana region.

The Cincinnati Observatory is a contributing property to the Observatory Historic District.

==History==
Cincinnati Observatory was built by Ormsby M. Mitchel at the peak of Mount Ida, a hill that overlooks downtown Cincinnati. Nicholas Longworth donated of land for the purpose. The Holy Cross Monastery and Chapel stands today at the site. The cornerstone was laid on November 9, 1843, and presiding over the occasion was former President John Quincy Adams, with an introduction by Judge Jacob Burnet. At 77 years old, it was to be his last public speech, and Mount Ida was renamed to Mount Adams in his honor.

The Merz refractor was the biggest telescope in the United States in the early 1840s.

In 1871, the Observatory came under the control of the University of Cincinnati and in 1873 it was transferred from Mt. Adams to Mt. Lookout in order to escape the smoke and dirt of the city, where it remains today. The ground on which it stands was given to the city by John Kilgour in 1872. A smaller structure, the Mitchel Building, holds the original telescope taken from the Mount Adams observatory. The 1873 building was built by the firm of Cincinnati architect Samuel Hannaford. From 1884 to 1930 the director of the Observatory was Jermain G. Porter. In 1998 the Observatory was declared a National Historic Landmark.

The asteroid 1373 Cincinnati was named to honor the staff of the observatory.

<doc id="1057906" wikidata="Q1135120" url="?curid=1057906" title="Terra (company)">
<text>Terra was a Spanish Internet multinational company owned by Telefónica. It was headquartered in Spain and had offices in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, the United States and Peru. Part of the Telefónica Group (the former Spanish public telephone monopoly), Terra operated as a web portal or Internet access provider in the United States, Spain and 16 Latin American countries. It was founded in 1999 as Terra Networks, S.A., a publicly traded company with Telefónica as its main shareholder. All outstanding shares were purchased by Telefónica in 2017, making Terra a wholly owned subsidiary.

== History ==
Terra was founded in 1999 as Terra Networks, S.A. by Juan Villalonga, Telefónica&#x27;s president between 1996 and 2000, and grew in size through the acquisitions of several local startups in Spain and the main Latin American markets: Olé (Spain), ZAZ (Brazil), Mexico, Gauchonet, Donde (Argentina) and Chevere (Venezuela).

Terra has created several digital portals, like Invertia, a successful finance portal, and Educaterra (e-learning). It also has had or has stakes in other Internet ventures: Uno-e (online banking), Rumbo (travel, in partnership with Amadeus), Atrea (real estate, in partnership with Spanish bank BBVA), and more.

In November 1999, still during the period known as the &quot;Internet bubble&quot;, Terra had a high-profile IPO both in the U.S. and Spain, and its shares skyrocketed. After that, the price fell sharply until it reached 2.75 euros in October 2004. This process sparked a lot of public controversy in Spain, where thousands of small investors acquired shares of Terra during the boom.

During 2003 and 2004 Terra expanded aggressively into the paid content business, mainly in Spain, Brazil, and Chile, launching ventures with Disney and Spanish football clubs Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. It also started several entertainment services, including an online multiplayer gaming platform (Terra Games) and a digital music service (Terra Música Premium) similar to Apple Computer&#x27;s iTunes.

== Terra and Lycos ==
In April 2000, Terra acquired Lycos, a U.S. portal, in a stock swap valued at US$12.5 billion. By that time, Lycos was the third most visited portal in the U.S., and had a strong presence in key European and Asian markets. Lycos CEO Bob Davis was moved to the position of CEO of the combined company, from where he stepped down in January 2001, being replaced by then Chairman Joaquim Agut.

Part of the deal was also German media giant Bertelsmann, owner of a stake in Lycos Europe. In exchange for keeping the control over Lycos Europe, Bertelsmann agreed to spend US$1 billion worth in advertising at Terra Lycos through a five-year period. That spending was crucial for Terra to survive the times of the Internet crash, when several Latin American-based Internet companies like Quepasa, Starmedia or El Sitio lost cash up to the point of filing for bankruptcy or being taken over by bigger companies.

In 2003 Bertelsmann executed an option to get itself out of the agreement, transferring to Terra&#x27;s parent company Telefónica the obligation to keep the ad spending. Soon after that, Telefónica decided to get more control over Terra and launched an offer for shares of Terra still floating on the stock market. Although it granted Telefónica control over more than 70% of Terra&#x27;s stock, the move was not successful enough to let Telefónica take Terra out of the public, as was allegedly its objective.

In October 2004, following Telefónica&#x27;s decision to re-focus their businesses, Terra sold Lycos to South Korean Internet portal company Daum Communications for US$105 million. Kim Faura was Terra&#x27;s last chairman. Joaquim Agut was the previous one, and now he is chairman of Endemol.

== Telefonica take-over ==
In February 2005, Telefónica announced its intention of taking full control of Terra by giving Telefónica shares in exchange for Terra&#x27;s remaining shares in the stock market. After this plan was approved by both Telefónica and Terra shareholders meetings, Terra&#x27;s shares were finally excluded from the market on July 15, 2005.

Terra Networks S.A. was then merged into Telefónica, S.A. and, therefore, disappeared from a legal point of view. A small portion of the former corporate headquarters became &quot;Terra Networks Asociadas, S.L.U.&quot; (a new company) and local Terra operations (and assets) were transferred to local fixed-line Telefónica companies.

== Terra.com ==
In the early 2000s, Terra was the largest Latin American online media company, ranked as the 31st most popular Internet destination in the world. The website primarily provided entertainment, news and sports to approximately 100 million monthly visitors, Terra was named as one of the most innovative company in the music area by Fast Company in 2011.

It has offices in cities such as São Paulo and Porto Alegre, Brazil.

<doc id="1057912" wikidata="Q13292" url="?curid=1057912" title="Saurashtra language">
<text>Saurashtra (Saurashtra script: , Tamil script: சௌராட்டிர மொழி, Devanagari script: सौराष्ट्र भाषा) is an Indo-Aryan language spoken primarily by the Saurashtrians of Southern India who migrated from the Lata region of present-day Gujarat to south of Vindhyas in the Middle Ages.

Saurashtra, an offshoot of Sauraseni Prakrit, once spoken in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat, is now chiefly spoken in various places of Tamil Nadu and are mostly concentrated in Madurai, Thanjavur and Salem Districts.

The language has its own script of the same name, but is also written in the Tamil, Telugu, and Devanagari scripts. The Saurashtra script is of Brahmic origin, although its exact derivation is not known. Unlike most of the surrounding Dravidian languages, Saurashtra is Indo-European. There is some debate amongst speakers of the Saurashtra language as to which script is best suited to the language. Census of India places the language under Gujarati. Official figures show the number of speakers as 247,702 (2011 census).

==Classification==
Saurashtra belongs to the western branch of the Indo-Aryan languages, a dominant language family of the Indian subcontinent. It is part of the greater Indo-European language family. It is also classified as being part of a Gujaratic languages that, alongside Saurashtra includes the languages like Gujarati (see SIL Ethnologue).

==Etymology==
According to the oral legends of the Saurashtra people, they migrated to South India from the Saurashtra region of modern-day Gujarat; however, scholars believe this account lacks historical basis, and that the Saurashtrans actually migrated from the area of Mandsaur.

The name &quot;Saurashtra&quot; itself is from Sanskrit (, ), the vṛddhi form of (, ), derived from (, ) + (, ). Thus the name literally means &quot;(of/from) a good country.&quot;

==History==
The oldest available inscriptions in Saurashtra are found in Mandasaur, which is a city in the Malwa region (present day Madhya Pradesh). The language is the modern living and active form of ancient Sauraseni Prakrit. However, it also shows some similarities with Maharashtri Prakrit, the ancestor of Marathi and Konkani.

Saurashtra was once commonly spoken in the coastal areas of Mahi and Tapti rivers, which extends throughout the Malwa region of Madhya Pradesh and Saurashtra region of southern Gujarat. It was also spoken by the people living along Konkan region, which extends throughout the western coasts of Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka.

Saurashtra is a amalgamation of various present day Indo-Aryan languages like Marathi, Konkani, Gujarati and the older dialects of Rajasthani and Sindhi. However, the current spoken form of Saurashtra is mixed with the Dravidian languages like Kannada, Telugu and Tamil and it might have originated in 16th or early 17th century.

==Geographical distribution==
Speakers of the Saurashtra language, known as Saurashtrians, maintain a predominant presence in Madurai, Thanjavur, Salem, Dindigul, Tiruchirappalli, Tirunelveli, Kanchipuram, Ramanathapuram, Kanyakumari, Chennai, Tiruvannamalai and Vellore Districts of Tamil Nadu. They are also present in significant numbers in Tirupati of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

==Dialects==

In the course of migration, Saurashtrians moved in groups and settled in different regions of South India and that caused a slight dialect variation between each group and is noticeable by a Saurashtrian speaker when interacting with another group. Saurashtra language has two dialects, which are broadly similar, with slight variations.

The two dialects are:

#Northern Saurashtra
#Southern Saurashtra

However, there are numerous variations and dialects of the Saurashtra language. The different dialects can be based on the location within northern and southern parts of Tamil Nadu. Those are Madurai, Thanjavur, Salem, Tirunelveli and Kanchipuram dialects and Tirupati dialect of Andhra Pradesh.

== Phonology ==
The phoneme inventory of Saurashtra is similar to that of many other Indo-Aryan languages, especially that of the Konkani language. An chart of all contrastive sounds in Saurashtra is provided below.

== Writing system ==

===Saurashtra script===

Saurashtra for most of the part had been an oral language lacking any script of its own. Around the 17th to 18th centuries some attempted to write it in Telugu script. Around 19th century a script was invented. There were attempts to revitalize the script in the latter half of the 19th century, ignoring most of the complex conjunct characters.

The Saurashtra script is an abugida, that is, each letter represents a consonant+vowel syllable. There are thirty-four such letters. An unmarked letter represents a syllable with the inherent vowel [a]; letters can be marked with one of eleven vowel diacritics to represent a syllable with a different vowel. Vowel diacritics are attached to the top right corner of a base letter or written alongside it. There are also twelve letters for writing independent vowels (i.e. word-initial vowels). The four vocalic liquid letters r, ru, l and lu behave in the same way as vowels, so are often included in the vowel class.

Early Saurashtra texts use a number of complex conjunct forms for writing consonant clusters. However, when the script was restructured in the 1880s these were abandoned in favour of a virama diacritic, which silences the inherent vowel of the first consonant in a cluster.

The script uses a letter called upakshara, a dependent consonant sign which attaches nasals and liquids to aspirate them. That is, the letter m with upakshara attached represents [mha]. An aspirated nasal or liquid which is followed by a vowel other than [a] is written with the vowel diacritic attached to the upakshara, not to the base letter. Some analyses of the script classify aspirated nasal and liquids as a separate set of single discrete letters divided into two parts.

There is a script-specific set of numbers 0–9, some of which closely resemble Devanagari digits. The widely attested Indic punctuation marks danda and double danda are used to mark the end of a sentence or clause. Latin comma, full stop and question mark symbols are also used.

The letter order of Saurashtra script is similar to other Brahmic scripts. The letters are vowels, consonants, and the compound letters which are formed essentially by adding a vowel sound to a consonant.

===Devanagari script===

Recently, the Saurashtrian community has largely switched to the use of the Devanagari script. The alphabet chart containing vowels, consonants and the compound letters in Devanagari script are as follows:
== Loanwords ==

The language itself is more similar to modern day Gujarati and Marathi as both originated from Prakrit. However, in the course of migration to South India, the language was influenced by Dravidian Languages such as Telugu and Kannada and accumulated words from those language in its vocabulary as loanwords. 
== Literature ==

The literature of Saurashtra is not as large as the literature of other literary languages such as Tamil, Sanskrit, Kannada, and Telugu. The earliest available Saurashtra literature that survives to this date is the Saurashtra translation of the great Sanskrit epic of Ramayana. It was written by &quot;Venkatasoori Swamigal&quot; (1800 AD), a Sanskrit scholar and disciple of Venkataramana Bhagavathar who lived in Ayyampettai of Thanjavur district.

Other important literary works in Saurashtra are:

* Bhagavad Gita (&quot;Bhagavat Giito&quot;) 1953 AD – written by T.R.Padman abhaiyer
* Thirukkural (&quot;Saurashtra Thirukural Payiram—Pitika Pragaranam&quot;) 1980 AD – translated by Sankhu Ram
* Mahabharata (&quot;Paandavun Khetho&quot;) 2013 AD – written by Kasin Anantham
*Silappatikaram 2018 AD – translated by S.D.Gnaneswaran

Besides Thirukkural, Sankhu Ram has done many literary works in Saurashtra like &quot;Gnanamritha Geetham&quot;, &quot;Shiddhashrama Prabhaavam&quot; and so on. The first Saurashtra dictionary was brought out by T.M. Rama Rai, the author of &quot;Vachana Ramayana,&quot; in 1908. It was printed in Saurashtra script and was in the form of slokas. Apart from these he is also credited for &quot;Niti Sambu&quot; and Natanagopala Nayaki Swami&#x27;s Kirthanas.

The Sahitya Akademi Award is given to authors writing in the Saurashtra language since 2007. A former Sanskrit Professor of Sourashtra College in Madurai, T.R. Damodaran won the award for his book &quot;Jiva Sabda Kosam&quot;, a compilation of 1,333 Saurashtra words with English and Tamil meanings. However, Saroja Sundararajan, was also awarded for &quot;Yogendran Monnum Singaru Latun&quot; (in Tamil, &#x27;Yogendra Thalaivarkalin Manathiley Ezhuntha Azhagiya Alaigal&#x27;), a rendition of works of Adi Sankara&#x27;s Soundaryalahiri, Kanagadhara stotra and Mahishasuramarthini stotra, Natana Gopala Nayagi Swami&#x27;s &#x27;Mooschi Deshad,&#x27; &#x27;Subramanian Mahatmiyam&#x27; and songs of Sai Baba.

<doc id="1057914" wikidata="Q383663" url="?curid=1057914" title="Wind &amp; Wuthering">
<text>Wind &amp; Wuthering is the eighth studio album by English progressive rock band Genesis. It was released on 17 December 1976 on Charisma Records and is their last studio album to feature guitarist Steve Hackett. Following the success of their 1976 tour to support their previous album &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot;, the group relocated to Hilvarenbeek in the Netherlands to record a follow-up album, their first recorded outside the UK. Writing and recording caused internal friction, as Hackett felt some of his contributions were dropped in favour of material by keyboardist Tony Banks.

The album received a positive response from critics and contributed to the band&#x27;s growing popularity in the US. It reached No. 7 in the UK and No. 26 in the US and sold steadily, eventually reaching Gold certification by the British Phonographic Institute and the Recording Industry Association of America. The single &quot;Your Own Special Way&quot; was the band&#x27;s first charting single in the US, reaching . The band&#x27;s 1977 tour, their last with Hackett, was their first with Chester Thompson hired as their live drummer. Three tracks left off the album were released during this time as an extended play, &quot;Spot the Pigeon&quot;. The album was reissued with a new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix in 2007.

== Background and production ==
By mid-1976, Genesis had survived the departure of original frontman Peter Gabriel, with drummer Phil Collins taking over lead vocals, and produced the critically and commercially successful album &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; and supporting tour. When they started work on a new album, keyboardist Tony Banks recalled a considerable amount of music had been written before the recording stage. Bassist and rhythm guitarist Mike Rutherford said it took an estimated six weeks to write the album. He pointed out the band wished to distance themselves from writing songs that were inspired by fantasy, something that their past albums &quot;were full of&quot;. They wanted to write songs that they enjoyed, rather than having to please all the fans.

Hackett requested time to do another solo album before recording &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot;, but was denied. He suggested ideas like dividing the song credits evenly so all four members had an equal number of songs on the album and bringing in outside musicians, which received a cold reception from the other members. He found himself arguing with the band as he felt his ideas were rejected in favour of material that Banks, in particular, had put forward. Having already released his first solo album, &quot;Voyage of the Acolyte&quot;, Hackett requested the band use more of his musical ideas on &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot;. Banks ended up with six writing credits on the album&#x27;s nine tracks, more than any other member. Collins spoke of Hackett&#x27;s request: &quot;We just wanted to use what we agreed was the strongest material, irrespective of who wrote it&quot;. He later said he did like Hackett&#x27;s songs, but just thought Banks won the popular vote with the band. Hackett was not interested in writing shorter and simpler songs, and felt &quot;the wackiness was being toned down&quot;.

Recording began in September 1976 with producer David Hentschel at Relight Studios in Hilvarenbeek, Netherlands, the first time Genesis recorded an album outside of the UK. The band learned that they could keep as much as 25 percent more of their earnings if they recorded an album overseas. Rutherford found the idea attractive, for the location offered fewer distractions. The band recorded quickly, and finished the basic tracks for the album in twelve days. Further work on the album was completed in October at Trident Studios in London; the album was mixed there in three weeks.

Collins explained that the album&#x27;s title derives from a combination of the early working titles of &quot;Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers...&quot; and &quot;...In That Quiet Earth&quot;, respectively. The first was named because of its &quot;wind-like evocations&quot;; the second as it has &quot;a bit of a corny mood&quot; like Emily Brontë&#x27;s novel &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; did. The songs took their titles from the last sentence in the novel. The &quot;Wind&quot; also has links to &quot;The House of the Four Winds&quot;, a piece guitarist Steve Hackett wrote that became the bridge on &quot;Eleventh Earl of Mar&quot;, plus the wind alluded to on &quot;Your Own Special Way&quot;. Banks suggested the album&#x27;s title which received some initial doubts from management &quot;because it isn&#x27;t zap-pow enough.&quot;

The album&#x27;s sleeve was designed and illustrated by Colin Elgie and Hipgnosis. Upon hearing the album&#x27;s title Elgie liked its visual title and immediately thought of Heathcliff, a prominent character from &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, and English moorland. He had remembered a scene from the Middle Ages film &quot;The War Lord&quot; (1965) which featured Charlton Heston standing beside a tree and the birds in it take flight. The cover is a watercolour by Elgie which took around three weeks to complete. He looked back on his design and wished to use &quot;a hint more colour, less monochromatic&quot;.

== Songs ==
===Side one===
&quot;Eleventh Earl of Mar&quot; refers to the historical figure of John Erskine, Earl of Mar, a Scottish Jacobite. Its working title was &quot;Scottish&quot;. The first line of the song, &quot;The sun had been up for a couple of hours&quot;, is the opening line of the novel &quot;The Flight of the Heron&quot; by D. K. Broster. Rutherford, who wrote the song&#x27;s lyrics, got the idea after reading a &quot;history book about a failed Scottish rising ... around 1715&quot;. Hackett wrote the music and lyrics to the song&#x27;s bridge, which was originally a section of a different song.

&quot;One for the Vine&quot; was a track that Banks wrote during the writing sessions for &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot;. He spent a year working on the song until he &quot;got it right&quot;. His aim was to piece together a variety of instrumental parts into a complete song without repeating a section. The lyrics, which came after Banks had arranged the track, are a musical fantasy about a man who had been declared a Christ-like religious figure, and was forced to lead people into battle, while the music featured a variety of styles. In the end, he becomes the prophet that he himself did not believe in, and becomes disillusioned. Banks was inspired by the science fiction novel &quot;Phoenix in Obsidian&quot; (1970) by Michael Moorcock. He likened the song to his earlier composition &quot;The Lamia&quot; from &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;, but felt &quot;One for the Vine&quot; was a much better song because his lyrics fit the music better than the lyrics Peter Gabriel wrote for &quot;The Lamia&quot;. The song became a live favourite, and regularly featured in the band&#x27;s setlist for several years.

&quot;Your Own Special Way&quot; is an acoustic ballad written by Rutherford in open tuning, which includes a previously unused instrumental piece in the middle. He later said it was easier to join bits of individual songs together than write a single cohesive short piece.

Collins picked &quot;Wot Gorilla?&quot; as one of his favourite Genesis tracks as it brought in his influences of jazz fusion and Weather Report. Rutherford said its main theme is from the middle instrumental section from &quot;One for the Vine&quot;, and that Collins suggested playing it in a &quot;fast, jazzy rhythm&quot; that built on the success of &quot;Los Endos&quot; from the previous album. Hackett was less enthusiastic and initially declared it &quot;a very inferior instrumental&quot;, but later said it was &quot;good rhythmically, but underdeveloped harmonically&quot;. Collins rearranged the piece with his big band project in the 1990s, and would play the drum pattern to see if his kick pedal was correctly adjusted.

===Side two===
&quot;All in a Mouse&#x27;s Night&quot; is a comical tale inspired by Tom and Jerry. Banks wrote the lyrics with a cartoon-like feel. The song started out what Rutherford called &quot;an involved epic&quot; until the group abandoned this idea and approached it in a different way.

&quot;Blood on the Rooftops&quot; is a song concerning &quot;the tedium and repetitiveness of television news and the overall mocking disgust that must sometimes accompany watching the news happen&quot;. The music to its chorus was written by Collins with Hackett writing the music to the verses, the song&#x27;s lyrics and its classical guitar introduction. According to Hackett, the song was a love song originally. He explained, &quot;When I heard the other lyrics on the album, there was a bit of a romantic tinge anyway, so I decided to go right the other way and make it as cynical as possible.&quot; It also addresses some political issues, which Genesis had previously stayed away from. Banks and Rutherford both claimed it was Hackett&#x27;s best song as a member of the group.

&quot;Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers...&quot; and &quot;...In That Quiet Earth&quot; are two linked instrumental tracks. The first one was based on a bass pedals sequence by Rutherford with Hackett adding other chords with the guitar; the second one has two sections, with the first one based on a chord sequence by Hackett and second on a riff by Rutherford, then the other members added improvisations and variations on them. The titles refer to the last paragraph of the novel which inspired the album&#x27;s title – &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, by Emily Brontë, which Banks had spotted in the book and thought the first title suited its mellow atmosphere. The tracks were written so that the band could showcase their instrumental talents, and stretch their musical skills as well as the songwriting.

&quot;Afterglow&quot; is a straightforward and concise love song, and an important development in the group&#x27;s career, as it proved to them they could write short songs that they still liked. In contrast to the amount of time it took Banks to develop &quot;One for the Vine&quot;, he wrote &quot;Afterglow&quot; &quot;just about in the time it took to play it&quot;. Banks said the song &quot;is about a reaction to a disaster and the realisation of what&#x27;s important to you, in a slightly cataclysmic way [... I] made the chorus the essence of what the person is actually thinking&quot;. The ending features Collins&#x27; layered vocals. A few days after he wrote it, he came to the sudden realisation that its melody resembles that of &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;, which led to him playing it back and concluding &quot;it wasn&#x27;t the same&quot;. A Moog Taurus, a foot-operated analog synthesiser, was used to create a drone effect. It was a staple on Genesis tours for over forty years.

===Unreleased material===
The group rehearsed Hackett&#x27;s &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Touch&quot; for &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot;, but decided not to record it after Collins felt he &quot;couldn&#x27;t get behind&quot; the song. The group picked &quot;Wot Gorilla?&quot; in its place. Hackett later recorded the song for his solo album of the same name.

In May 1977, Genesis released the extended play &quot;Spot the Pigeon&quot;, containing three songs recorded during the &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; sessions but left off the final track selection–&quot;Match of the Day&quot;, &quot;Pigeons&quot;, and &quot;Inside and Out&quot;. The first two are shorter, more commercial songs; the latter was left off because Collins said it was too long, did not &quot;quite fit&quot; with the overall sound of the album, and that insufficient space remained for it. He said the group considered including the EP of the extra tracks with the album, but decided against it as songs &quot;tend to get lost&quot; with the listener that way. &quot;Inside and Out&quot; remained a favourite of Hackett&#x27;s, who felt it was stronger than some material that ended up on the album. &quot;Spot the Pigeon&quot; reached No. 14 in the UK.

== Release ==
&quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; was released in the UK on 17 December 1976. Genesis biographer Armando Gallo claimed that the album had sold 100,000 copies in its first week, which should have equated to the album entering the UK chart at number one, but its release around the Christmas period meant that some record shops were unable to complete their returns for the chart data. The album reached No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart. In the US, the album peaked at No. 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. By April 1977, the album had sold roughly 150,000 copies there. &quot;Your Own Special Way&quot; was released as a single in the U.S. that reached No. 62 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart, the band&#x27;s first charting single with Collins as lead vocalist. In February 1977, the album was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry.

== Critical reception ==

When recording finished, Banks expressed some concern that the album would be too &quot;heavy&quot; and &quot;difficult&quot; for people on their first listen, but he knew fans would give the material a chance. He noted the three tracks recorded during the album&#x27;s sessions that were ultimately left off were &quot;quite simple&quot; and this meant the album had a heavier and more adventurous theme overall. Hackett and Banks have named it as one of their favourite of all Genesis records.

&quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; turned out to be favourable with several critics at the time of release. In a positive review for &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, David Brown opened with &quot;The grey misty, autumn cover gives away the mood of this album, with its mellow tones and airy songs&quot;. He believed the band&#x27;s new following after the success of &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; would not be disappointed. He thought the album is &quot;remarkably well-paced – the music flows ... in an almost undisturbed stream ... subtle instrumentals cleverly link the songs together&quot;. Barbara Sharone had multiple sessions listening to the album for &quot;Sounds&quot;. She found the album too dense to appreciate with just one listen, and &quot;less immediate but more substantial&quot; than &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot;. Genesis seemed to her more relaxed and self-confident, and &quot;One for the Vine&quot; was for her &quot;Genesis&#x27; finest moment&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a positive review, praising Genesis for being more experimental and steeped in conventional rock than their progressive rock contemporaries. They made particular note of &quot;Your Own Special Way&quot;, calling it &quot;a first-rate pop song&quot;. &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; was included in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Top Album Picks feature, which stated &quot;Genesis has grown into one of the premiere art-rock bands to come out of England and its fans will not be disappointed with the latest offering ... sometimes the music and the words are brilliant&quot;. Stephen Lavers for &quot;National RockStar&quot; named the album the best from Genesis at the time of its release and their most ambitious work since &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;. &quot;Circus&quot; magazine described the album as &quot;flawless&quot; with &quot;the most mature orchestration to date&quot; from the band. Bruce Malamut for &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; said the &quot;Unquiet Slumbers&quot; suite was &quot;majestic&quot; with its &quot;colourful sound textures&quot;.

The album continued to receive praise from retrospective critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine made note of &quot;Your Own Special Way&quot;, calling it &quot;the poppiest tune the group had cut and also the first that could qualify as a love song&quot;. His reaction to &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; as a whole was mild, and he summarised it as being in &quot;the same English eccentric ground that was the group&#x27;s stock in trade since &quot;Trespass&quot;&quot;. Andy Fyfe, writing for &quot;&quot;Q&quot;&quot;, named &quot;One for the Vine&quot; one of Genesis&#x27; &quot;moments of impressive songwriting&quot;.

== Tour ==
Following the album&#x27;s release, Genesis embarked on a world tour covering Europe, North America, and their first dates in South America. The tour marked the first time Chester Thompson was hired as their touring drummer; Thompson replaced Bill Bruford who played drums on the &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; tour. Bruford was critical of his stint with Genesis as he had no musical input, and consequently, had started rehearsing with John Wetton and Rick Wakeman. Collins had become a fan of Frank Zappa&#x27;s &quot;Roxy and Elsewhere&quot; album, which featured Thompson as one of two drummers, and consequently asked him to join the touring band without an audition.

The band concentrated their stage set with an elaborate lighting display, including two rows of 747 landing lights, and their own patented computer-controlled laser light system. The tour received enthusiastic responses from crowds. Collins recognised a growth in the size of their audience in some cities they visited in the US. The tour began on 1 January 1977 with a sold-out UK leg, beginning with three nights at London&#x27;s Rainbow Theatre where over 80,000 applications were made for the 8,000 available tickets. On 31 January, the live film &quot;Genesis In Concert&quot; premiered at the ABC Cinema, Shaftesbury Avenue with Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips in the audience.

The North American leg saw Genesis play their first show at several larger venues, including Madison Square Garden in New York City and the Los Angeles Forum. Their concerts in Brazil were attended by over 150,000 people, with a proposed 100,000-person gig cancelled for fear of rioting. Each band member was accompanied by an armed bodyguard during their stay. By the middle of the tour, Hackett had become frustrated with the band, having lost interest in touring and wanted to make a solo record. After the tour finished, and partway through mixing the live album &quot;Seconds Out&quot;, he decided to quit Genesis.

== Reissues ==
&quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; was first reissued on CD in 1985 by Charisma Records. A remastered CD followed in 1994 by Virgin and Atlantic Records. In 2007, the album was released in a new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix individually and as part of the &quot;Genesis 1976–1982&quot; studio album box set engineered by Nick Davis and Tony Cousins.

<doc id="1057920" wikidata="Q1397181" url="?curid=1057920" title="Ralph Nelson Elliott">
<text>Ralph Nelson Elliott (28 July 1871 – 15 January 1948) was an American accountant and author whose study of stock market data led him to develop the Wave Principle, a description of the cyclical nature of trader psychology and a form of technical analysis. It identifies trends and reversals in financial markets. These cyclical patterns in price movements are known among practitioners of the method as &quot;Elliott waves&quot;.

==Personal life and career==
Elliott was born in Marysville, Kansas, and later moved to San Antonio, Texas. He entered the accounting field in the mid-1890s and worked primarily in executive positions for railroad companies in Central America and Mexico. In 1903, Elliott married Mary Elizabeth Fitzpatrick (1869–1941), who accompanied him during his extended time working as an expatriate in Mexico. Civil unrest there brought the couple back to the United States and eventually to a residence in New York City, where Elliott started a successful consulting business. In 1924, the United States Department of State appointed Elliott to the post of Chief Accountant for Nicaragua, which was under American control at the time. Not long afterward, Elliott wrote two books based on his professional experiences: &quot;Tea Room and Cafeteria Management&quot;
and &quot;The Future of Latin America&quot;.

==Elliott Wave Principle==
In the early 1930s, Elliott began a systematic study of seventy-five years of stock market data, including index charts with increments ranging from yearly to half-hourly prices. In August 1938, he detailed his results by publishing his third book in collaboration with Charles J. Collins, entitled &quot;The Wave Principle.&quot; Elliott stated that, while stock market prices may appear random and unpredictable, they actually follow predictable, natural laws, and can be measured and forecast using Fibonacci numbers. Soon after the publication of &quot;The Wave Principle&quot;, &quot;Financial World&quot; magazine commissioned Elliott to write twelve articles under the book title, describing his method of market forecasting.

In the early 1940s, Elliott expanded the theory to apply to all collective human behavior. His final major work was his most comprehensive: &quot;Nature&#x27;s Law –The Secret of the Universe&quot; published in June, 1946, two years before he died.

In the years after Elliott&#x27;s death, other practitioners, including Charles Collins, Hamilton Bolton, Richard Russell, and A.J. Frost continued to use the wave principle and provide forecasts to investors. Glenn Neely published &quot;Elliott Waves in Motion&quot; in 1988 and &quot;Mastering Elliott Wave&quot; in 1990 using Elliott Wave theory to present an objective approach to market forecasting called Neowave theory. Neely&#x27;s Neowave theory is an expansion of Elliott Wave principles years after Elliott&#x27;s death, including new patterns discovered with: Neutral triangle, Diametric formation, Symmetrical formation, Extracting triangle, 3rd-Extension terminal with 5th failure, and Reverse alternation. Robert Prechter found out about Elliott&#x27;s work while he was working as a market technician at Merrill Lynch, and used it as a basis for the book &quot;Elliott Wave Principle&quot;, coauthored with Frost in 1978.

<doc id="1057949" wikidata="Q509818" url="?curid=1057949" title="Marabá, Pará">
<text>Marabá is a municipality in the state of Pará, Brazil. Its greatest geographic reference is the confluence of two large rivers near the historic city center, the Itacaiunas River and the Tocantins River, forming a &quot;Y&quot; if seen from space. It basically consists of six urban centers linked by five highways.

Marabá is the fourth-most-populous municipality in the state of Pará, approximately 283,542 inhabitants according to the IBGE/2020, and the fourth largest GDP in the state of Pará, with US$1.543.254,34 according to the IDESP/2010. It&#x27;s the main center of political, social, and economic development in southern of Pará and one of the most dynamic municipalities in Brazil.

Marabá has a strategic position and is crossed by five highways. It also has a large logistics infrastructure, with a port, airport, and railway. The municipality has a growing industrial park. The steel industry is especially important to Marabá&#x27;s vast agricultural frontier. Marabá also has a strong trade and services sector.

Marabá is characterized by its broad mix of peoples and cultures that do justice to the meaning of the town&#x27;s nickname: &quot;Son of Miscegenation.&quot;

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Marabá&quot; derives from the indigenous vocable &quot;Mayr-Abá&quot;, which simply means &quot;son of the indigenous woman with a white man.&quot;

A poem written by poet Gonçalves Dias inspired by the merchant Francisco Silva to its commercial name of &quot;Casa Marabá&quot; (Maraba House). This was located the banks of the Tocantins River, and served as a strategic business point for exchanging all kinds of products and services.

== History ==
The settlement of the river basin Itacaiunas played an important factor in shaping the city, because even though this region was later colonized by the Portuguese Empire in the sixteenth century, remained without a permanent settler occupation for almost 300 years. Only in 1894 is, in fact, the space was occupied by settlers.

=== Colonization ===
The first to participate in the colonization of the territory of Marabá, in 1894, were the political leaders who had escaped from political guerrillas in the northern Province of Goiás, specifically the city of Boa Vista. One of those leaders was Carlos Leitao, who traveled with his group to the southeast of the province of Grão-Pará and established its first camp in downstream Itacaiunas River, in December 1894. A definitive village was established on the left bank of the Tocantins River, about 10 km downstream from the other camp, the place that Carlos Leitao called &quot;Burgo do Itacayúna&quot; (Burgo&#x27;s Itacayúna). After a few months, the extraction of rubber latex began in the &quot;Burgo&#x27;s Itacayúna&quot; region.

In 1895 Carlos Gomes Leitão asks the President of the Province of Grão-Pará, José Paes de Carvalho, funding for the extraction and commercialization of rubber in addition to getting drugs to be used specifically to combat tropical diseases. To get funding, Carlos Leitão disseminating information on the extraction of rubber in small colony of Burgo&#x27;s Itacayúna and its surroundings. Immediately there is the first population explosion of the locality where the rubber tappers, fishermen and hunters settle in the village of Burgo.

=== Foundation of Pontal do Itacayúna ===
The merchant Francisco Coelho da Silva would have been the first to settle in the area downstream of Rio Itacaiunas, crucial to the foundation of the village of &quot;Pontal do Itacayúna&quot; (Pontal of Itacayúna). The goal of Francisco Silva, while riding the village of Pontal of Itacayúna, was to negotiate with the rubber tappers who sought to sell the rubber collected in the region.

The official historiography Francisco Silva assigns the authorship of the current name of the city. He had installed in the village of Pontal of Itacayúna a commercial point called &quot;Casa Marabá&quot; (House Marabá), which years later would be used to name the until then village Pontal of Itacayúna.

With the death of Colonel Carlos Leitão in 1903, the village of Burgo&#x27;s Itacayúna is disabled and Leitão family along with other residents move to the village of Pontal do Itacayúna. In 1904 the village of the Pontal shall be called &quot;Marabá&quot; and host the borough, with the installation of the police detachment.

=== Formation of the municipality ===

The economy of the village of Marabá grew considerably supported by the extractive base, anchored in exports of rubber and Brazil-nut to U.S. and European markets. The economic importance gained, influenced the political aspects, so that in the years 1908 to 1909 a major rebellion occurred in Maraba, called of &quot;Revolta dos Galegos&quot; (Revolt of the Galicians). The rebellion was demanding political autonomy from the county of Baião, and the low prices paid for rubber and the highest interest rate on loans for collecting nuts and rubber.

Retaliating against the rebellion of Maraba the government of the province of Grão-Pará does not meet demands by emancipation. However the enormous pressure and influence of the local society has made the provincial government gave in and finally initiate negotiations for the creation of the municipality of Marabá.

That culminated on February 27, 1913 Maraba achieved political autonomy and became a municipality. The first mayor of Maraba was the military Antonio Maia, who took office as appointed by the President of the Province of Grão-Pará.

In subsequent years the migratory flow to the region of Marabá increased considerably. During the 1920s, immigrants moved to Maraba mainly to participate in the extraction and sale of Brazil nuts, andiroba, copaiba oils and rubber. And from the 1930s moved to Maraba, in order to work in the diamond mines that were on the banks of the Tocantins River.

In 1929, Marabá becomes illuminated by a power plant that operated the base from burning wood. In November 1935 the local airport is opened and the first plane lands in this. Maraba in this period consists of 450 houses and 1.500 inhabitants fixed.

=== The 1970s ===
With the construction of Highway PA-70, in 1969, Maraba is connected to the Belém-Brasília Highway. The implementation of road infrastructure was part of the Brazilian military government&#x27;s strategy to integrate the Amazon region to the rest of the country. All this was part of the integration strategy of the Amazon territory, especially the region of Marabá, where was undertaken mainly the official plan of agricultural colonization, the construction of the Tucuruí Hydroelectric Power, the implementation of &quot;Projeto Grande Carajás&quot; (Greater Carajas Project), and even the discovery of large gold deposits of the Serra Pelada. All these projects were centered in Marabá, and contributed to the economic and population boom that occurred in the city between 1970 and 1980.

In 1970 the city was declared a National Security Area (legal position allowing direct intervention of the Brazilian central government), a condition that lasted until the end of the Brazilian military dictatorship in 1985. Besides having strategic importance to the policy of national integration, Marabá region was the only region of Brazil where there was fighting between the army and the guerrillas of the PCdoB party who want to topple the military regime and establish a communist regime in Brazil. Then performed an Araguaia guerrilla movement, which forced the Brazilian government to Marabá to send a large contingent of troops of the Brazilian Army. The city has become since then one of the bases for military operations troops of the Brazilian Armed Forces.

In 1970 it launched the &quot;Programa de Integração Nacional&quot; (National Integration Program), which, among other things, provided for the construction of the Trans-Amazon Highway, whose first section opened in 1971, along with the creation of a post of the National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform in Marabá. With the completion of construction of the Trans-Amazon Highway, the flow of immigrants towards Maraba became very large, and in less than a decade the city has been radically transformed, from a small urban center on the banks of the Tocantins River (in Maraba time had only 20,000 inhabitants), a main city in the region with over 100,000 inhabitants.

=== The 1980s ===
In 1980 the city was devastated by the biggest flood in its history, when the Tocantins River rose 17.42 meters. As a result, there was a redesign of the city&#x27;s expansion, with the construction of urban areas planned of the &quot;Cidade Nova&quot; (New City) and &quot;Nova Marabá&quot; (New Marabá), to the detriment of traditional urban area of the &quot;Velha Marabá&quot; (Old Marabá). New urban areas have also emerged over the decade, highlighting the &quot;São Félix&quot; (St. Félix) and the &quot;Morada Nova&quot; (New Morada).

In 1984, comes into operation the Carajás Railway, which has Marabá as center of operations; in 1988 and come into operation the first two steel mills for the production of pig iron.

In 1987 there was a conflict that became known as the Massacre of St. Boniface. The battle took place between the miners of Serra Pelada and the battalion of the &quot;Polícia Militar&quot; (Military Police of the state of Pará), with the support of the Brazilian Army. The event that preceded the massacre was blocking access to the Mixed Bridge of Marabá, in demonstration of the reopening of Serra Pelada mine and the lowering of the mining pit. A Police battalion was sent to unlock the bridge, but on reaching the spot shot with firearms against protesters to force their withdrawal. Officially nine people died in the conflict.

The municipality contains part of the Tapirapé Biological Reserve, a strictly protected conservation unit created in 1989.

=== Recent facts ===

In 2008, the industrial park of Marabá reaches its peak with the onset of steel production, declining in the same year due to the Great Recession that has hit the European, American and Chinese markets, which were the targets of local production.

The crisis greatly affected the collection of taxes and other local businesses, forcing layoffs and major disruptions of projects and investments. The effects in industrial park of Marabá were very large, forcing the closure of 10 of the 11 steel-metallurgical industries. The city&#x27;s economy is slowly recovering, with the reopening of some steel mills since 2013.

In 2011, Marabá actively participated in all of southeast Pará plebiscite on division that defined the state of Pará. Marabá established itself during the process as the center of discussions in the region about the project division, to be the leading candidate to be state capital of Carajás. The plebiscite took place on December 11, 2011. Municipality at 93.26% of the votes were in favor of establishing Carajás.

== Geography ==

Occupying an area of 15,092,268 km², Marabá counts, in 2017, with 271,594 inhabitants, being the tenth most populous municipality of the North region of Brazil. The municipal seat has the following geographical coordinates: 05º 21 &#x27;54 &quot;South latitude and 049º 07&#x27; 24&quot; longitude WGr. Located in southeastern Pará, in the Marabá microregion, it is bordered by the municipalities of: Novo Repartimento, Itupiranga, Nova Ipixuna and Rondon do Pará (to the north); São Geraldo do Araguaia, Eldorado dos Carajás, Curionópolis and Parauapebas (to the south); Bom Jesus do Tocantins, São João do Araguaia and São Domingos do Araguaia (to the east); and São Félix do Xingu (to the west).

The topography of the municipality of Marabá presents the highest altitudes in the Southeast region of Pará, through the Carajás, Sereno, Buritirama, Paredão, Encontro, Gray and Misteriosa mountains. Of this complex, stands out the Carajás mountain range, like the one of greater size. However, it is in the Serra do Cinzento that the maximum altitude of the municipality of Marabá is found, with 792 meters. The Carajás, Cinzento and Buritirana mountains are located in conservation areas, under federal jurisdiction, called the Tapirapé-Aquiri National Forest ( sustainable use conservation unit created in 1989.) and the Tapirapé Biological Reserve, where several caves are found. Its forms of relief are encompassed by the morphostructural unit denominated Peripheral Depression of the South of Pará, where they dominate the amazonian plateaus.

The vegetation cover of the municipality of Marabá is quite diverse. The fitofisionomy of the forests of the municipality of Marabá is characterized by three types: the open ombrophylous forest, the dense ombrophylous forest and the anthropic areas. In the urban area of Marabá, the anthropic forests predominate. Because of its diverse nature, the municipality holds one of the largest natural heritage sites in Brazil, housing large forest reserves such as the Tapirapé Biological Reserve, with 103,000 ha (1,030 km²), and the Tapirapé-Aquiri National Forest with 190,000 hectares ha (1,900 km²), in addition to the Mãe Maria Indigenous Land, with 64,488,416 ha (644.88 km²), which is close to the municipal seat of Marabá, belonging to the municipality of Bom Jesus do Tocantins.

Marabá is located in a low altitude area in the connexion of two rivers - Itacaiúnas and Tocantins - and suffers from annual floods due to the topography and direct influence of four rivers: Itacaiunas, Tocantins, Tauarizinho and Sororó. In addition to the basins related to these rivers, the municipality is inserted in the basins of the rivers Aquiri, Tapirape, Gray, Black, Parauapebas and Red. Of these, the basins of the Tapirapé, Cinzento and Preto rivers are included totally in the area of the municipality. The basin of Itacaiúnas stands out for bathing the whole municipality, in whose mouth is the municipal headquarters of Marabá and covers the largest area, that is, 5,383.4 km².

== Economy ==
The municipality of Maraba experienced various economic cycles. Until the early 1980s economy was based on the extraction plant. At first revolved around the extraction of latex rubber, whose lucrative attracted large numbers of the Northeast. Since the late nineteenth century (1892) until the late 1940s, was marked by the extraction of the rubber boom that has contributed greatly to the economy of the city and the region, however, the rubber crisis led the council to a new cycle . This time, the cycle of Brazil nuts, which for years led the municipal economy. There was also the cycle of diamonds between 1920 and 1940, which were mainly found on the river Tocantins. With the discovery of Serra Pelada Maraba went through cycles of mining mostly the extraction of gold.

Since the early 1970s installation of the Grande Carajás project and steel industries diversified and boosted the local economy.

=== Primary sector ===
Today, Maraba is the economic center and a vast administrative region of the Amazon agricultural frontier &quot;, the city has one of the most significant economic growth in the country. Livestock based on cattle ranching is an activity of great importance for the municipality, and ensure the livelihoods of the population, provides the regional and local development by creating large scale, and is marketed in different Brazilian regions and abroad. The herd area is highlighted by its superior quality, being one of the most important cattle herds of the state, a result arising from the use of advanced technology in the selection and fertilization. It has also herds of pigs, horses, sheep and poultry

The fishing sector also has a key role in local economic base by exporting its surplus for the entire north and northeast. Agriculture is diversified, with production cereals, pulses and oilseeds such as corn, rice and beans, fruits such as bananas and acai, and logging

Through the Industrial Development Company of Para - CDI, was installed at the end of the eighties, in an area of 1,300 hectares, the industrial district of Maraba - DIM, to create the base of a steel pole targeting the Carajas iron ore, exploited by the mining company Vale.

Metallurgical Industries and intense livestock activity, accounted for a large environmental devastation in the region. The activity of the steel industry requires large amounts of coal, leading to a devastation of native forests. As a result of public pressure the industries were forced to change its production model, investing in reforestation and charcoal production through the babassu coconut palm.

Besides, to have more than 200 industries, and the steel (pig iron) most important, second is the timber industry and the manufacture of tiles and bricks. The city&#x27;s economy also relies on the production of manganese and Agribusiness. In Maraba, Agribusiness works with pulp processing, cassava flour, rice processing, milk and palm.

The installation of steel plant came boost the local economy even more, forming a metal pole-mechanical, with a view to verticalize the local mineral production. There are still projects that seen during and after the installation of steel works, among them: The gas pipeline Açailândia-Maraba and construction of new port city.

The trade and services sector also has its share of contribution. Maraba has approximately 5 000 outlets divided between trade formed by micro, small, medium and large businesses and services, Hospital, Financial, Education, Construction and Public Utilities. It is a very powerful and comes with high rates of growth. This is because the strategy of state government, to decentralize services from the state capital, Belém.

Maraba is subdivided into six urban centers:
* Cidade Nova
* Industrial
* Morada Nova
* Nova Marabá
* São Félix
* Velha Marabá

== Infrastructure ==

Marabá has a significant infrastructure compared to the municipalities of the Carajás region, but compared to other medium cities in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, it is far below this level.

The service of water and sewage of Marabá is made by Sanitation Company of Pará (&quot;Companhia de Saneamento do Pará&quot; - &quot;Cosanpa&quot;). The water consumed by the inhabitants of Marabá comes from the Tocantins and Itacaiunas rivers, which goes through treatment in the municipal water treatment plants.

The electric power is provided by the company Power Plants of Pará (&quot;Centrais Elétricas do Pará&quot; - &quot;Celpa&quot;), which has four substations, one in the neighborhood of Folha 19, one in the Jardim Vitória neighborhood, one in the Gabriel Pimenta neighborhood (Morada Nova district) and another in the Industrial district.

<text>The .41 Remington Magnum, also known as .41 Magnum or 10.4×33mmR (as it is known in unofficial metric designation), is a center fire firearms cartridge primarily developed for use in large-frame revolvers, introduced in 1964 by the Remington Arms Company, intended for hunting and law enforcement purposes.

== Development ==

In 1963, Elmer Keith and Bill Jordan, with some help from Skeeter Skelton, petitioned Smith &amp; Wesson, Remington, and Norma to produce a pistol and ammunition in .41 caliber which would fall between the extant .357 Magnum and .44 Magnum cartridges in ballistic performance, and at the same time address perceived shortcomings with those loads. While as early as 1955 Keith had suggested a new, medium-powered &quot;.41 Special&quot; cartridge, this idea was passed over in favor of the higher-powered &quot;Magnum&quot; option, and the Special survives only as a custom wildcat cartridge, bearing roughly the same relation to the .41 Magnum as the .38 Special does to the .357 Magnum and as the .44 Special does to the .44 Magnum.

The .357 Magnum suffered from restricted terminal ballistic effectiveness in the early 1960s, as jacketed hollow point bullets were not yet commonly available, and the manufacturers&#x27; standard loadings consisted of simple lead bullets. The powerful .44 Magnum, primarily a heavy hunting round, was considered overkill for police use, generating too much recoil for control under rapid fire. In addition, the revolvers chambered for the .44 Magnum were considered too large, bulky, and heavy for police to carry.

Keith&#x27;s original vision called for dual power levels in the .41, a heavy magnum load pushing a JHP at a muzzle velocity of , and a milder police loading which was to send a semiwadcutter downrange at around .

These plans went awry due to an ongoing fascination in the firearms community with high-powered cartridges; Remington was swayed by this community&#x27;s influence and instead of following Keith&#x27;s blueprint, chose to emphasize the performance of the new cartridge. As a result, the .41 &quot;Magnum&quot; load was released at an advertised , and even the &quot;light&quot; police loading was introduced with a lead semiwadcutter &quot;warmed up&quot; to about . However, the police load as delivered was regarded as overpowered by most law enforcement agencies, many of which were still using .38 Special revolvers.

Additionally, Smith &amp; Wesson had simply adapted their large N-frame revolvers for the new cartridge, which did not address size and weight concerns. The Model 58, targeted for the law enforcement market, was introduced on July 10, 1964. Weighing , the Model 58 compared unfavorably with other revolvers available at the time, such as Smith&#x27;s own Model 10 in .38 Special.

These combined factors mostly eliminated the .41 Magnum from consideration for its intended market as a law enforcement firearm, although it continued to be touted as such and was adopted by a few law enforcement agencies.

For a handgun cartridge, the bolt thrust is considerable at C.I.P. conform maximum loads and an important factor in weapons design. The greater the bolt thrust, the stronger the locking mechanism has to be to withstand it. Smith &amp; Wesson produced a high-end, premium revolver in .41 Magnum, the Model 57, identical to the .44 Magnum-chambered Model 29. Magnum Research&#x27;s Desert Eagle division produced a .41 Magnum in their semi-automatic Mark VII. Sturm Ruger also produced their Blackhawk single-action revolver in .41 Magnum.

A couple of manufacturers have produced lever-action rifles chambered in .41 Magnum. Marlin produced four variants of its Model 1894, but no longer offers any model chambered for it. Henry Repeating Arms introduced a .41 Magnum variant of their Big Boy Steel model in 2016.

== Market reception ==
The .41 Magnum never enjoyed the popularity and success of either the .357 Magnum or .44 Magnum cartridges, but is still prized by handgun hunters as some feel it generates somewhat lighter recoil and slightly flatter bullet trajectory at long range than the .44 Magnum. Nevertheless, the .44 Magnum still catalogs a greater variety of heavier bullet weight offerings which are more effective on larger game, and boast a slight edge in power when using the heaviest factory loads, or if pushed to the edge by handloading (heavier bullets or bullets of different types). Marshall and Sanow called the .41 Magnum &quot;one of our most unappreciated calibers&quot;.

<doc id="1057955" wikidata="Q3611542" url="?curid=1057955" title="Super-Poincaré algebra">
<text>In theoretical physics, a super-Poincaré algebra is an extension of the Poincaré algebra to incorporate supersymmetry, a relation between bosons and fermions. They are examples of supersymmetry algebras (without central charges or internal symmetries), and are Lie superalgebras. Thus a super-Poincaré algebra is a [[Super-Poincaré algebra|Z]]2-graded vector space with a graded Lie bracket such that the even part is a Lie algebra containing the Poincaré algebra, and the odd part is built from spinors on which there is an anticommutation relation with values in the even part.

==Informal sketch==
The Poincaré algebra describes the isometries of Minkowski spacetime. From the representation theory of the Lorentz group, it is known that the Lorentz group admits two inequivalent complex spinor representations, dubbed formula_1 and formula_2. Taking their tensor product, one obtains formula_3; such decompositions of tensor products of representations into direct sums is given by the Littlewood–Richardson rule.

Normally, one treats such a decomposition as relating to specific particles: so, for example, the pion, which is a chiral vector particle, is composed of a quark-anti-quark pair. However, one could also identify formula_4 with Minkowski spacetime itself. This leads to a natural question: if Minkowski space-time belongs to the adjoint representation, then can Poincaré symmetry be extended to the fundamental representation? Well, it can: this is exactly the super-Poincaré algebra. There is a corresponding experimental question: if we live in the adjoint representation, then where is the fundamental representation hiding? This is the program of supersymmetry, which has not been found experimentally.

==History==
The super-Poincaré algebra was first proposed in the context of the Haag–Łopuszański–Sohnius theorem, as a means of avoiding the conclusions of the Coleman–Mandula theorem. That is, the Coleman–Mandula theorem is a no-go theorem that states that the Poincaré algebra cannot be extended with additional symmetries that might describe the internal symmetries of the observed physical particle spectrum. However, the Coleman–Mandula theorem assumed that the algebra extension would be by means of a commutator; this assumption, and thus the theorem, can be avoided by considering the anti-commutator, that is, by employing anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. The proposal was to consider a supersymmetry algebra, defined as the semidirect product of a central extension of the super-Poincaré algebra by a compact Lie algebra of internal symmetries.

==Definition==
The simplest supersymmetric extension of the Poincaré algebra contains two Weyl spinors with the following anti-commutation relation:
:formula_5
and all other anti-commutation relations between the &quot;Q&quot;s and &quot;P&quot;s vanish. The operators formula_6 are known as supercharges. In the above expression formula_7 are the generators of translation and formula_8 are the Pauli matrices. The index formula_9 runs over the values formula_10 A dot is used over the index formula_11 to remind that this index transforms according to the inequivalent conjugate spinor representation; one must never accidentally contract these two types of indexes. The Pauli matrices can be considered to be a direct manifestation of the Littlewood–Richardson rule mentioned before: they indicate how the tensor product formula_12 of the two spinors can be re-expressed as a vector. The index formula_13 of course ranges over the space-time dimensions formula_14

It is convenient to work with Dirac spinors instead of Weyl spinors; a Dirac spinor can be thought of as an element of formula_15; it has four components. The Dirac matrices are thus also four-dimensional, and can be expressed as direct sums of the Pauli matrices. The tensor product then gives an algebraic relation to the Minkowski metric formula_16 which is expressed as:

:formula_17
and
:formula_18

This then gives the full algebra

:formula_19

which are to be combined with the normal Poincaré algebra. It is a closed algebra, since all Jacobi identities are satisfied and can have since explicit matrix representations. Following this line of reasoning will lead to supergravity.

=== Extended supersymmetry ===
It is possible to add more supercharges. That is, we fix a number which by convention is labelled formula_20, and define supercharges
formula_21 with formula_22

These can be thought of as many copies of the original supercharges, and hence satisfy
:formula_23
:formula_24
and
:formula_25
but can also satisfy
:formula_26
and 
:formula_27
where formula_28 is the &quot;central charge&quot;.

== Super-Poincaré group and superspace ==

Just as the Poincaré algebra generates the Poincaré group of isometries of Minkowski space, the super-Poincaré algebra, an example of a Lie super-algebra, generates what is known as a supergroup. This can be used to define superspace with formula_20 supercharges: these are the right cosets of the Lorentz group within the formula_20 super-Poincaré group.

Just as formula_7 has the interpretation as being the generator of spacetime translations, the charges formula_21, with formula_33, have the interpretation as generators of superspace translations in the &#x27;spin coordinates&#x27; of superspace. That is, we can view superspace as the direct sum of Minkowski space with &#x27;spin dimensions&#x27; labelled by coordinates formula_34. The supercharge formula_35 generates translations in the direction labelled by the coordinate formula_36 By counting, there are formula_37 spin dimensions.

=== Notation for superspace ===

The superspace consisting of Minkowski space with formula_20 supercharges is therefore labelled formula_39 or sometimes simply formula_40.

==SUSY in 3 + 1 Minkowski spacetime==
In Minkowski spacetime, the Haag–Łopuszański–Sohnius theorem states that the SUSY algebra with N spinor generators is as follows.

The even part of the star Lie superalgebra is the direct sum of the Poincaré algebra and a reductive Lie algebra &quot;B&quot; (such that its self-adjoint part is the tangent space of a real compact Lie group). The odd part of the algebra would be
:formula_41
where formula_42 and formula_43 are specific representations of the Poincaré algebra. (Compared to the notation used earlier in the article, these correspond formula_44 and formula_45, respectively, also see the footnote where the previous notation was introduced). Both components are conjugate to each other under the * conjugation. &quot;V&quot; is an &quot;N&quot;-dimensional complex representation of &quot;B&quot; and &quot;V&quot;* is its dual representation. The Lie bracket for the odd part is given by a symmetric equivariant pairing {..} on the odd part with values in the even part. In particular, its reduced intertwiner from formula_46 to the ideal of the Poincaré algebra generated by translations is given as the product of a nonzero intertwiner from formula_47 to (1/2,1/2) by the &quot;contraction intertwiner&quot; from formula_48 to the trivial representation. On the other hand, its reduced intertwiner from formula_49 is the product of a (antisymmetric) intertwiner from formula_50 to (0,0) and an antisymmetric intertwiner &quot;A&quot; from formula_51 to &quot;B&quot;. Conjugate it to get the corresponding case for the other half.

===&quot;N&quot; = 1===

&quot;B&quot; is now formula_52 (called R-symmetry) and &quot;V&quot; is the 1D representation of formula_52 with charge 1. &quot;A&quot; (the intertwiner defined above) would have to be zero since it is antisymmetric.

Actually, there are two versions of &quot;N=1&quot; SUSY, one without the formula_52 (i.e. &quot;B&quot; is zero-dimensional) and the other with formula_52.

===&quot;N&quot; = 2===

&quot;B&quot; is now formula_56 and &quot;V&quot; is the 2D doublet representation of formula_57 with a zero formula_52 charge. Now, &quot;A&quot; is a nonzero intertwiner to the formula_52 part of &quot;B&quot;.

Alternatively, &quot;V&quot; could be a 2D doublet with a nonzero formula_52 charge. In this case, &quot;A&quot; would have to be zero.

Yet another possibility would be to let &quot;B&quot; be formula_61. &quot;V&quot; is invariant under formula_62 and formula_63 and decomposes into a 1D rep with formula_64 charge 1 and another 1D rep with charge -1. The intertwiner &quot;A&quot; would be complex with the real part mapping to formula_62 and the imaginary part mapping to formula_63.

Or we could have &quot;B&quot; being formula_67 with &quot;V&quot; being the doublet rep of formula_57 with zero formula_52 charges and &quot;A&quot; being a complex intertwiner with the real part mapping to formula_64 and the imaginary part to formula_62.

This doesn&#x27;t even exhaust all the possibilities. We see that there is more than one &quot;N&quot; = 2 supersymmetry; likewise, the SUSYs for &quot;N&quot; &gt; 2 are also not unique (in fact, it only gets worse).

===&quot;N&quot; = 3===

It is theoretically allowed, but the multiplet structure becomes automatically the same with
that of an &quot;N&quot;=4 supersymmetric theory. So it is less often discussed compared to &quot;N&quot;=1,2,4 version.

===&quot;N&quot; = 4===

This is the maximal number of supersymmetries in a theory without gravity.

===&quot;N&quot; = 8===

This is the maximal number of supersymmetries in any supersymmetric theory. Beyond formula_72, any massless supermultiplet contains a sector with helicity formula_73 such that formula_74. Such theories on Minkowski space must be free (non-interacting).

==SUSY in various dimensions==
In 0 + 1, 2 + 1, 3 + 1, 4 + 1, 6 + 1, 7 + 1, 8 + 1, and 10 + 1 dimensions, a SUSY algebra is classified by a positive integer &quot;N&quot;.

In 1 + 1, 5 + 1 and 9 + 1 dimensions, a SUSY algebra is classified by two nonnegative integers (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot;), at least one of which is nonzero. &quot;M&quot; represents the number of left-handed SUSYs and &quot;N&quot; represents the number of right-handed SUSYs.

The reason of this has to do with the reality conditions of the spinors.

Hereafter &quot;d&quot; = 9 means &quot;d&quot; = 8 + 1 in Minkowski signature, etc. The structure of supersymmetry algebra is mainly determined by the number of the fermionic generators, that is the number &quot;N&quot; times the real dimension of the spinor in &quot;d&quot; dimensions. It is because one can obtain a supersymmetry algebra of lower dimension easily from that of higher dimensionality by the use of dimensional reduction.

=== Upper bound on dimension of supersymmetric theories ===
The maximum allowed dimension of theories with supersymmetry is formula_75, which admits a unique theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity which is the low-energy limit of M-theory. This incorporates supergravity: without supergravity, the maximum allowed dimension is formula_76.

===&quot;d&quot; = 11===
The only example is the &quot;N&quot; = 1 supersymmetry with 32 supercharges.

===&quot;d&quot; = 10===
From &quot;d&quot; = 11, &quot;N&quot; = 1 SUSY, one obtains &quot;N&quot; = (1, 1) nonchiral SUSY algebra, which is also called the type IIA supersymmetry. There is also &quot;N&quot; = (2, 0) SUSY algebra, which is called the type IIB supersymmetry. Both of them have 32 supercharges.

&quot;N&quot; = (1, 0) SUSY algebra with 16 supercharges is the minimal susy algebra in 10 dimensions. It is also called the type I supersymmetry. Type IIA / IIB / I superstring theory has the SUSY algebra of the corresponding name. The supersymmetry algebra for the heterotic superstrings is that of type I.

<doc id="1057986" wikidata="Q4230447" url="?curid=1057986" title="Polish American Congress">
<text>The Polish American Congress (PAC) is an American umbrella organization of Polish-Americans and Polish-American organizations.
Its members include individuals as well as fraternal, educational, veterans, religious, cultural, social, business, and political organizations.

As of January 2009, it lists 20 national organizations as members.
It is subdivided into 41 divisions and chapters.

Traditionally, the PAC National President has also been the president of the largest Polish-American fraternal organization, the Polish National Alliance (PNA).

==History==

In response to the threat to Poland&#x27;s freedom caused by Soviet and German aggression, a large Congress of Polonia met in Buffalo, New York, from May 28 to June 1, 1944.
Composed of roughly 2,600 delegates representing Polish and Polish-American organizations, the Congress created the PAC, defining its goal of a free Poland and underscoring its support for the US war effort against the Axis powers. The PAC incorporated the two former Polish umbrella organizations in the United States, the moderate Polish American Council founded in 1939 and the right-wing National Committee of Americans of Polish Descent founded in 1941. The other umbrella organization, the left-leaning American Slav Congress, remained independent.

The PAC was the first umbrella organization representing a majority of Polish-Americans, who had been represented by a wide range of smaller, mostly local organizations. Creation of PAC was enthusiastically welcomed by most of the Polish-American community. Shortly after its creation, it boasted 6 million members and followers.

==Timeline==
=== Part I: 1944-1980 ===
* May 28-June 1, 1944: The Polish American Congress is founded at a massive rally in Buffalo, New York. Some 2,600 delegates from Polish American communities around the country take part in that significant event of World War II.
* 1945: Following President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s return from the Yalta Conference at Yalta with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin, Charles Rozmarek, President of the PAC, and the other members are among the first in America who publicly denounce the great power agreements on Poland and Eastern Europe as a betrayal of American reasons for participating in World War II.
* 1946: Rozmarek angrily denounces the handling of thousands of Polish displaced persons throughout Western and Central Europe by UN authorities and calls for immediate changes after observing the conditions in Germany and France. In Paris, Rozmarek calls for free elections in Poland to determine the country’s future.
* 1948: The PAC lobbies successfully for special congressional legislation signed by President Harry Truman that leads to the admission of 140,000 Polish displaced persons, war victims and veterans of the Polish armed forces in Western Europe to settle permanently in the US.
* 1949: The PAC backs the creation of Radio Free Europe as a voice of truth to the peoples of communist-enslaved Eastern Europe.
* 1952: A special committee of the US Congress strongly endorsed by the PAC investigates the murder of more than 14,000 Polish Army officers at the beginning of World War II by the Soviet Union.
* 1957: Following the collapse of the Stalinist regime in Poland in 1956 and its replacement by a new, seemingly-reforming communist regime headed by Wladyslaw Gomulka, the PAC backs a US government foreign aid initiative aimed at weaning Gomulka away from Moscow&#x27;s authority. Immigration to the US is renewed, enabling thousands of Polish families to be reunited in this country.
* 1960: Eisenhower is the first US President to speak at a meeting of the Polish American Congress when he addresses its fifth convention in Chicago. Senator John Kennedy, the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential nominee, also speaks to the assembly. In later years, Presidents Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton will all address the Polish American Congress or its leaders on issues pertaining to its concerns.
* 1964: The PAC endorses President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s policy of &quot;Building Bridges&quot; to &quot;peacefully engage&quot; the peoples of Eastern Europe and to encourage the democratization and independence of the entire region from Soviet domination.
* 1969: The first formal dialogues between the PAC and leaders of the American Jewish community begin in an effort to create new understanding and communication between two peoples who lived together in Poland for seven centuries until the Nazi occupation, devastation of Poland, and ruthless annihilation of the Jewish people.
* 1975: The PAC endorses President Gerald Ford’s signing of the international treaty on security and cooperation in Europe in Helsinki, Finland. Among other things, the Helsinki Accords legitimize a set of human rights for the people living under communist rule in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. 
* 1980: The forming of the Solidarity Trade Union Movement in Gdansk in August in a time of extreme economic and political crisis brings an immediate PAC endorsement for the union&#x27;s cause under the leadership of President Mazewski and Vice President Kazimierz Lukomski, a veteran observer of the Polish scene and a member of the World War II era Polish Combatants&#x27; Association. The PAC, working in cooperation with Professor Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter&#x27;s National Security Advisor, urges the United States to pressure the Soviet Union against intervening in the crisis, and calls on the Polish government to negotiate responsibly with Solidarity. The initial confrontation subsides.

===Part II: 1981- 1994===
* 1981: The PAC sponsored efforts begin to raise money and materials to meet the needs of Poles, who suffer in an economy that has nearly collapsed. The PAC Charitable Foundation initiates its work for Poland by delivering medical goods in short supply to Poland. In December, after Poland&#x27;s military suppresses Solidarity and proclaims martial law, the PAC backs American sanctions against the Soviet Union and Poland.
* 1982: The PAC, in co-operation with Witold Plonski of Brooklyn, wins substantial funding from the US National Endowment for the Humanities for its proposal to create a national &quot;Consortium for Humanities and Arts Programming.&quot; Over the next five years, his Polish American Committee in the Humanities sponsors several hundred lectures, conferences, and cultural exhibitions around the US that deal with the Polish and Polish American experience. Thar is the most successful effort in history to enlighten the American public and Polish Americans about Poland&#x27;s past, culture, and political experience.
* 1984: President Reagan meets with PAC leaders at the White House on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising. He reaffirms his administration’s support for the policy known as the National Endowment for Democracy and endorses the creation of a Polish agricultural foundation proposed by the Catholic Church.
* 1987: The PAC wins the Reagan administration&#x27;s termination of economic sanctions against Poland, a position in accord with the thinking of Pope John Paul II and Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
* 1989: In November, the PAC greets Lech Walesa in Chicago, where he receives a hero’s welcome. The PAC goes on record in lobbying for economic assistance proposals to Poland advanced by President Bush and the US Congress. The first result of these efforts is passage of the Support East European Democracy Act of 1989, which commits more than $800 million to help Poland in its transformation into a democratically governed society with a free market economy.
* 1990: PAC successfully lobbies President Bush for full US support to international confirmation of the permanence of Poland&#x27;s western border with the reunited Germany, which is crucial to the future stability of Central Europe.
* 1991: The disintegration of the Soviet Union follows upon a failed last-ditch attempt in August by old guard communist leaders to reverse Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms, but Gorbachev himself is soon swept aside by Russia&#x27;s elected president, Boris Yeltsin. Poland, the vast Solidarity movement, and the Roman Catholic Church all played major roles in helping bring about those incredible international developments.
* 1992: The PAC plays a leading role in the activities of an historic congress of Poles from more than 50 countries, including from the former Soviet Union, that takes place in Krakow, Poland, under the auspices of the &quot;Wspolnota Polska&quot; association. The congress is among other things, a great family reunion occurring in a Poland that is at last free and independent. President Lech Walesa, Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka, and Cardinal Jozef Glemp are among the Polish dignitaries who address the congress. An &quot;American Agenda&quot; is unanimously approved by the delegates to the eleventh national PAC convention in Washington in October. Accordingly, the Congress commits itself to giving renewed and vigorous attention to building broad knowledge and respect for Poland&#x27;s history and culture in this country and the advancement of worthy Polish-American nominees to every level of government responsibility in America. The task before the PAC is to put that agenda into effect.
* 1994: President Moskal, Vice President Wojcik, Treasurer Dykla and a delegation of Polish American Congress leaders play key roles in two meetings of Americans of Polish, Czech, Hungarian, and Slovak heritage that are held with the top leaders of the US government, including President Bill Clinton and Vice President Albert Gore. The meetings held in Milwaukee and Washington, DC, are themselves the direct result of a massive and unprecedented PAC campaign aimed at mobilizing Polish Americans and their friends to pressure the Administration to back NATO membership for Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. More than 100,000 letters and postcards and countless thousands of telephone calls and telegrams deluge the White House in an unprecedented display of PAC strength and resolve.

===Part III: 1995-2019===
* 1995: The PAC backs voter registration efforts in the Polish-American community and responds to a tragic fire in Gdansk, Poland, by sending special supplies to the many burn victims.
* 1996: During the presidential campaign, the PAC strongly urges the candidates to support Poland’s entry into NATO and immigration reform and to affirm the US commitment to the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. A major ally is US Representative William Lipinski of Illinois.
* 1997: President Clinton moves forward Poland&#x27;s admission to NATO. The PAC acts effectively on behalf of Polish flood victims and on immigration reform.
* 1998: The national ancestry question is retained for the 2000 census after PAC efforts.
* 1999: The admission of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to NATO is approved by all 16 of its members. PAC members take part in the celebrations in Washington. A US Congressional Caucus on Central and Eastern Europe is created through PAC efforts.
* 2000: The PAC effectively fights for justice against the policemen involved in the shakedowns of Polish immigrants in Chicago.
* 2001: The PAC Charitable Foundation raises $125,000 on behalf of the victims of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on September 11.
* 2002: The PAC defends thousands of Polish students who are victims of errors in the management of the J-1 visa work/travel program to the US. The PAC is invited by the Speaker of the Polish Senate to participate in the Polonia Advisory Council and also takes a lead role in the Council of World Polonia under National Executive Director Les Kuczynski. The Washington, DC, office introduces an internship in the capital for Polish-American university students.
* 2003: The City of Chicago settles a lawsuit brought by the PAC over the unfair gerrymandering of the city’s Polish-American community.
* 2005: Frank J. Spula becomes president of the PNA and the PAC following the death of President Moskal. He is still president of PAX.
* 2006: The Washington, DC, office begins to offer a number of programs in the capital to present the Polish-American contribution to the country.
* 2007: The PAC inaugurates its Medal of Freedom and honors Casimir Lenard as its first recipient. Senators Barbara Mikulski of Maryland in 2008 and George Voinovich of Ohio in 2009 are recipients of the PAC&#x27;s highest recognition.
* 2008: The PAC passes an amendment to its by-laws prohibiting collaborators with communist regimes from holding office in the organization. That action reaffirms the PAC&#x27;s historic position as stated in its by-laws. Annual Polish American Congress Days begin to be held in Washington, DC, and state capitals across the country. President Spula travels to Poland to reaffirm the PAC&#x27;s close ties with the Polish government.
* 2009: PAC remains active in working closely with the US administration and legislators on several legislative initiatives to include resolutions celebrating 90 years of diplomatic relations, commemorating 20 years since the round table talks and first free elections in Poland, urging the Postal Services to issue a stamp honoring Matt Urban, recognizing 6,135 Poles recognized by Yad Vashem as “Righteous Among the Nations” for helping their Jewish neighbors during World War II; recognizing 70th anniversary of the beginning of World War II as well as Soviet invasion of Poland; proclaiming Casimir Pulaski to be a posthumous honorary US citizen, to name a few. The PAC holds in Chicago its first National Conference, &quot;The Polish American Community in the 21st Century: Challenges and Opportunities,&quot; which is designed to bring together representatives of the Polish-American community nationwide and to initiate a discussion about its future.
* 2014: An electronic newsletter, &quot;Your Voice in America&quot; starts to be published.

==Leadership==
The Congress elected Karol Rozmarek as the first president of the PAC.
He was succeeded in 1968 by Aloysius Mazewski, who served until his death in 1988. Under Mazewski, Leonard F. Walentynowicz served as executive director of the PAC for a number of years. Edward Moskal was elected president in 1988, and he, too, served as president for the remainder of his life.
Its current president is Frank J. Spula.

== Activities ==
PAC has been credited with the unification of the Polish-American community.

=== International relations lobbying ===
One of the principal goals of PAC in its early years was to pressure the US government to support the Polish government in exile, and prevent the communist take-over of Poland. Over the coming decades, PAC would try to educate the American public about the fate of its once war-time ally, and to support a creation of a democratic Polish state. Its stance during that time has also been described as strongly anti-communist and anti-Soviet.

After the end of the Cold War, PAC was successful in lobbying the US government to include Poland in the membership of NATO.

===Criticism of anti-Polish racism and bigotry===
Outside of its goals related to international politics, PAC second main goal has been to improve the situation of the Polish-American community.

According to Michael Szporer PAC had a reputation of aggressiveness in its critique of anti-Polish sentiment.

In 1969 PAC created the Civic Alertness Commission (Komisji Obrony Imienia Polskiego) to focus on reducing the anti-Polish sentiment and related anti-Polish discrimination in American media and public life. Over the years, the CAC would change its name several times, including to Anti-Defamation Commission (1970) and Anti-Bigotry Committee (1980); at some point in time (around 1989) two similar sub organizations existed at the same time. The organization focused on pointing out racism and bigotry in Polish jokes, and related stereotypes. The Committee supported the US government plan to create the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and policies that made it illegal to tell ethnic jokes in workplaces.

In 1972, PAC demanded equal time to respond to Polish jokes aired on ABC&#x27;s The Dick Cavett Show. In the show, comedian Bob Einstein filled the role of the president of the imaginary Polish Anti-Defamation League. ABC had guest host Steve Allen apologize but refused equal time to PAC. PAC sued and lost in a case that reached the Supreme Court. PAC also threatened [[Steve Wozniak], himself of Polish heritage, with a lawsuit for telling Polish jokes.

In 1997 Frank Milewski of PAC&#x27;s Anti-Bigotry Committee wrote a letter to &quot;[[The New York Times]]&quot; complaining about the use of &quot;[[Polack]]&quot; in an article on light-bulb jokes by Daniel Harris.

In 1998, PAC criticized the &quot;[[Polish Wedding]]&quot; film, writing that &quot;No wedding takes place. It&#x27;s nothing but a contrived series of silly sexual escapades by a cheating wife and her promiscuous daughter shown as members of a crude and low-class family that Fox Films decided to give a Polish Catholic identity&quot;. PAC has also criticized [[The Drew Carey Show]], in particular the character Mimi Bobeck whose &quot;Polishness&quot; was toned down following the complaints.

<doc id="1058013" wikidata="Q331300" url="?curid=1058013" title="Mauá">
<text>Mauá () is a municipality in the state of São Paulo, in Brazil. It is part of the metropolitan region of São Paulo. The population as of 2020 is 477,552 inhabitants (11th largest city in population number of the state), the density is and the area is . The density is in fact bigger, since one third of the city is occupied by industries and 10% is countryside or forest. Its name comes from the Tupi language and means &quot;the one that is high&quot;. As it is a municipality, it can also be translated as &quot;high city&quot;. However, back when the city was a small village, its name was Pilar, then the name was changed in 1934 into Mauá as a homage to Visconde de Mauá, entrepreneur which built the Santos–Jundiaí railway that passes through the city.

Mauá has the 23rd largest GDP of São Paulo state.

It is the birthplace of Brazilian tableware industry.

==Economy==

Although there are various types of economic activity in the city (logistics, metallurgy, chemical and electrical materials, and petrochemical), Mauá is still known as the &quot;capital of china and pottery&quot;, because this activity was very important for the development of the municipality. There are two industrial centers (Capuava and Sertãozinho) and a large petrochemical complex plant where the refinery of Petrobras is located, the RECAP. These poles transformed Mauá into one of the largest industrial parks in the country. Major road interventions are being implemented (the Mário Covas Beltway and the prolongation of the Avenue Jacu-Pêssego/Nova Trabalhadores), which, due to the improved access to the city should influence the growth of industrial activity, who nowadays suffers with the bottleneck of the road network and its chronic lack of maintenance.

Some companies with headquarters or branches in the municipality of Mauá: ALCAN (Aluminum), CGE (metallurgical), Petrobras (petroleum refining, cooking gas and nitrogen), LED, Liquigas (cooking gas), Chevron-Oronite (petroleum products), Oxiteno-Ultrapar (gas oil products, except CNG), Firestone (tires), Saint-Gobain (automotive glass), Magneti Marelli-Cofap (metallurgy and automotive parts).

==Transport==

The city is served by CPTM Line 10, passing through the Capuava, Mauá and Guapituba stations. It is also served by the METRA bus rapid transit system, having one stop and a trolleybus line which goes to the Sônia Maria terminal.

Currently, the city bus system is operated by the company Suzantur.

==Geography==

===Climate===

The city is located above sea level, at the boundary between the Serra do Mar and the plateau. As a result, the city&#x27;s climate is considered subtropical, with average temperature during the year at around , rarely exceeding in summer. In winter the average is .

===Topography===

The landscape of Mauá is dominated by the formation of steep hills and peaks, as it is the usual Serra do Mar landscape, and by deep valleys and wetlands, today mostly grounded and occupied in a disordered way, which explains the high incidence of flooding there. Only the valley of Tamanduateí River on Capuava district is typically flat. Historical accounts describe the place as where the first bandeirantes, coming from São Vicente, saw the Planalto Paulista (São Paulo plateau) region and gave the name of Borda do Campo (that means Boundary of the Countryside) to the region, for making the transition between the Serra do Mar and the Planalto Paulista. The highest point in town is the Morro Pelado (Naked Hill), with 867 meters (the third highest of the Greater São Paulo), but the city is, on average, the highest of metropolitan region, due to the lack of flat areas.

===Hydrography===

The city has a special characteristic hydrographic: not be crossed by any water course from another city, since, due to the high altitude, all streams that cross the territory of Mauá has their sources inside the city limits.

Located in the city is the source of Tamanduateí River, the third largest affluent of the Tietê River in Greater São Paulo, the Oratório river and the Pinheirinho and Guaió rivers. The most important waterways in the urban area are the Taboão Stream, the Corumbé Stream and the Capitão João Stream (which flows under the XXII de Novembro square, in the downtown). Due to the disordered occupation of the floodplains, many places that before acted as absorbers of excessive rain water were grounded and the city has several points at high risk of flooding. The situation was eased with the construction of four reservoirs between the years 1998 and 2002. However, due to lack of maintenance, excessive garbage and siltation, the reservoirs cannot effectively avoid the flooding risk.
Besides the disordered occupation, lack of sewerage and waste treatment makes the urban waterways completely polluted.

===Vegetation===

Due to great variation in altitude, the city has a broad spectrum of natural landscapes, although much has been transformed by human occupation. The hillsides were originally occupied by a lush Atlantic Forest, though already mixed with species of Araucaria and Planalto Paulista typical of altitude climate. In the city, the Atlantic Forest areas most preserved are the wellsprings, the tank of Paulista, the Ecological Park Santa Luzia and the slopes of Guaraciaba. The wetlands were largely covered by reeds and cattails, plants typical of wetlands and marshlands. Currently, only the Taboão stream have the original vegetation in the urban environment, but will lose much of it due to rectification works to link up with the new Beltway. The valleys of the rivers Guaió and Pinheirinho and the region of Cappburgo are still with this vegetation, despite growing local slum. The peaks of the hills, especially the higher ones were covered by grasses and thin vegetation, currently the chief representative is the Morro Pelado, which takes its name from the very low vegetation cover.

== Demography ==
A large part of the population is descended from migrants from the Northeast, but also from Italian, German, Ukrainian, Spanish and Japanese immigrants.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica da Borda do Campo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<doc id="1058024" wikidata="Q4408145" url="?curid=1058024" title="USS Dorsey">
<text>USS &quot;Dorsey&quot; (DD–117), reclassified DMS-1 on 19 November 1940, was a in the United States Navy during World War I. She was named for John Dorsey.

&quot;Dorsey&quot; was launched on 9 April 1918 by William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia, sponsored by Mrs. A. Means, distant relative of Midshipman Dorsey. The destroyer was commissioned on 16 September 1918.

==Service history==
&quot;Dorsey&quot; sailed with a merchant convoy from Philadelphia on 20 September 1918, escorted it to Ireland, and returned to New York on 19 October. Between 28 October and 20 November, she voyaged on escort duty to the Azores, then operated locally out of New York until 13 January 1919 when she got underway for target practice and fleet maneuvers in Cuban waters, returning 2 March. Three days later she sailed to escort with President Woodrow Wilson embarked as far as the Azores, returning to Guantánamo Bay 21 March to join the fleet for maneuvers.

&quot;Dorsey&quot; sailed from Guantánamo Bay, Cuba on 9 April 1919, and arrived at Valletta, Malta on 26 April to report to Commander, Adriatic Squadron, for duty in the execution of the terms of the armistice with Austria. She served in the Mediterranean Sea until 9 July when she proceeded to New York arriving on 21 July.

&quot;Dorsey&quot; sailed from New York with her division on 17 September 1919 for the west coast, arriving at San Diego on 12 October. She joined in fleet maneuvers in the Panama Canal Zone and operated with seaplanes at Valparaíso, Chile, until clearing San Diego on 25 June 1921 to join the Asiatic Fleet.

&quot;Dorsey&quot; arrived at Cavite, Philippine Islands on 24 August 1921, and served in experimental submarine practice and long-range battle and torpedo practice. On 3 June 1922, she sailed from Manila to call at Shanghai and Chefoo, China, Nagasaki, Japan, and Pearl Harbor on her passage to San Francisco where she arrived on 2 October. She was placed out of commission at San Diego on 9 March 1923.

Recommissioned on 1 March 1930, &quot;Dorsey&quot; operated on the west coast, in the Canal Zone, and in the Hawaiian Islands acting as plane guard for aircraft carriers and participating in tactical maneuvers with the fleet. In reserve from 10 to 29 June 1935, she then entered Mare Island Navy Yard for the installation of gear for her new assignment as a high-speed towing vessel.

&quot;Dorsey&quot; continued to operate from San Diego providing high-speed target towing for ships in training along the west coast, in the Canal Zone, and, between 29 December 1938 and 25 April 1939, in the Caribbean Sea. From 3 July 1940 she was based at Pearl Harbor. She entered Pearl Harbor Navy Yard on 6 November for conversion to a high-speed minesweeper and was reclassified DMS-1 on 19 November 1940.

===World War II===
When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, &quot;Dorsey&quot; was at sea with TF 3 bound for Johnston Island. The force returned to its base on 9 December, and &quot;Dorsey&quot; was assigned to the Hawaiian Sea Frontier for patrol, local escort, and training duty. Except for at San Francisco from 1 January to 11 February 1943, she remained on this duty until 24 September 1943.

After scouting convoys to Efate, New Hebrides, and Noumea, New Caledonia, &quot;Dorsey&quot; sailed to the Solomon Islands for patrol and minesweeping operations. She swept and patrolled off Cape Torokina, Bougainville, and screened transports during the landings of 1 November, returning on 8 November and 13 November with reinforcement and supply convoys. She escorted from her base at Port Purvis on Florida Island to Noumea until 29 March 1944, then screened transports between Port Purvis, Kwajalein, Manus, and New Georgia until arriving at Majuro on 12 May for duty towing targets at high speed for ships in training. From 20 June to 9 July she guarded convoys between Kwajalein and Eniwetok, then escorted the escort carrier to Pearl Harbor, and proceeded to San Francisco for overhaul.

Returning to Pearl Harbor on 1 October 1944, &quot;Dorsey&quot; had towing duty and joined in minesweeping experiments until 9 November when she got underway as convoy escort for Port Purvis. On 1 December, she arrived at Manus for minesweeping operations until 23 December. Continuing to San Pedro Bay, Leyte, &quot;Dorsey&quot; sortied on 2 January 1945 for the invasion of Lingayen Gulf. During the pre-invasion minesweeping she accounted for several attacking planes and rescued five survivors from stricken .

&quot;Dorsey&quot; arrived off Iwo Jima for pre-invasion minesweeping on 16 February 1945. She patrolled during the assault landings, and towed to safety on 18 February. She sailed from Iwo Jima on 1 March for Ulithi to prepare for the invasion of Okinawa, where she arrived 25 March to sweep mines. On 27 March she was struck a glancing blow by a Mitsubishi Ki-51 &quot;kamikaze&quot; which killed three of her crew and wounded two. &quot;Dorsey&quot; remained on duty, screening assault shipping during the landings of 1 April and patrolling until 4 April when she departed for Pearl Harbor and battle damage repairs.

Returning to Okinawa 1 July 1945, &quot;Dorsey&quot; joined the minesweeping unit operating in conjunction with the 3rd Fleet raids on the Japanese home islands. She sailed on 14 September for minesweeping operations in the Van Diemen Straits, returning to Okinawa five days later. On 9 October, she was grounded by Typhoon Louise. Decommissioned on 8 December 1945, her battered hulk was destroyed on 1 January 1946.

==Awards and memorabilia==

&quot;Dorsey&quot; received six battle stars for World War II service.

As of 2004, no other ships in the United States Navy have gone by this name.

* Peak of 2 million instructions per second

The COP8 has a basic instruction cycle time 1/10 of the clock frequency; a maximum 10 MHz clock will result in a maximum 1 MHz instruction execution rate. (The 10 MHz clock is used directly by some timer peripherals.) The maximum instruction execution rate is 1 cycle per byte, and most 1-byte instructions operate in one instruction cycle. Some, particularly branch instructions, take one or two cycles more. Some models include a clock doubler, and although they still accept a maximum 10 MHz input clock, they internally double it to a 20 MHz master clock which then results in a 2 MHz instruction execution rate.

The chip is a static logic design which can tolerate an arbitrarily slow clock; most models include a second quartz clock crystal oscillator which can be used for the CPU clock while the high-speed clock is disabled to save power.

==Registers and memory map==

The COP8 uses separate instruction and data spaces (Harvard architecture). Instruction address space is 15-bit (32 KiB maximum), while data addresses are 8-bit (256 bytes maximum, extended via bank-switching).

To allow software bugs to be caught, all invalid instruction addresses read as zero, which is a trap instruction. Invalid RAM above the stack reads as all-ones, which is an invalid address.

The CPU has an 8-bit accumulator and 15-bit program counter. 16 additional 8-bit registers (R0–R15) and an 8-bit program status word are memory mapped. There are special instructions to access them, but general RAM access instructions may also be used.

The memory map is divided into half RAM and half control registers as follows:

If RAM is not banked, then R15 (S) is just another general-purpose register. If RAM is banked, then the low half of the data address space (addresses 0x00–7F) is directed to a RAM bank selected by S. The special purpose registers in the high half of the data address space are always visible. The data registers at 0xF&quot;x&quot; can be used to copy data between banks.

RAM banks other than bank 0 have all 128 bytes available. The stack (addressed via the stack pointer) is always on bank 0, no matter how the S register is set.

==Control transfers==
In addition to 3-byte and instructions which can address the entire address space, 2-byte versions of these instructions, and , can jump within a 4K page. The instruction specifies the low 12 bits, and the high 3 bits of the PC are preserved. (These are intended primarily for models with up to 4K of ROM.) For short-distance branches, there are 63 1-byte instructions, , which perform PC-relative branches from PC−32 to PC+31. This is a 15-bit addition, and no page boundary requirements apply.

There are also jump indirect and load accumulator indirect instructions which use the accumulator contents as the low 8 bits of an address; the high 7 bits of the current PC are preserved.

Conditional branches &quot;per se&quot; do not exist, nor does the processor provide the traditional ZCVN status flags, although the program status word contains carry and half-carry flags for multi-byte arithmetic. Rather, there are a number of compare-and-skip instructions. For example, compares its two operands, and skips the following instruction if they are unequal. Any instruction may be skipped; it is not limited to branches.

An interesting extension of this mechanism is the return-and-skip instruction, which lets any subroutine conditionally skip the instruction following the call. This provides a very compact way to return a boolean value from a subroutine.

Another feature unique to the COP8 architecture is the instruction. This one-byte instruction compares the low 4 bits of the B (memory pointer) register with a 4-bit immediate constant, and can be used to loop until B has reached the end of a small (up to 16 byte) buffer. There is also a one-byte instruction.

== Instruction set ==
COP8 operands are listed in destination, source order. Most instructions have the accumulator A as one of the operands. The other operand is generally chosen from an 8-bit immediate value, an 8-bit RAM address, or , the RAM address selected by the B register. The and (exchange with accumulator) instructions also support RAM addressing by the X register () and post-inc/decrement variants (, , , ).

Indirect addressing via B is particularly fast, and can be done in the same cycle that the instruction is executed; even is a one-cycle instruction.

On the other hand, absolute RAM addressing is only directly encoded for five instructions: codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, and codice_5. The latter is a &quot;direct addressing&quot; prefix opcode which may be prepended to any instruction with a operand, and changes the operand to the specified memory location. (Conditional-skip instructions skip the prefix and following instruction as a pair.) Using with the , and codice_6 instructions is not documented, as the dedicated instructions are more efficient.

All &quot;move&quot; instructions are called (load) even if the destination is a memory address (codice_4). Unusually, there are no instructions with the accumulator as a source; stores must be done with the instruction which &quot;exchanges&quot; the accumulator with the memory operand, storing A and loading the previous memory contents. 

There are instructions to fetch from tables in ROM. These combine the high 7 bits of the program counter (PCU) with the accumulator, fetch a byte from that address, and place it in the accumulator ( instruction) or the low 8 bits of the program counter PCL ( instruction). Because the next instruction executed must be in the same 256-byte page of ROM as the table itself, a 256-entry table is not possible.

<text>The National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame and Museum was founded in 1973. The mission of the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame is to recognize and preserve outstanding achievement by individuals of Polish heritage in the field of sports and to educate the entire community with the hope of encouraging and inspiring personal excellence. The hall is located in Troy, Michigan.

Each year, inductees are elected in a nationwide vote among NPASHF officers, Hall of Fame inductees and more than 500 members of the Sports Panel Council. With over 150 inductees, the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame has an outstanding collection of historic artifacts on display at the American Polish Cultural Center in Troy, Michigan. Stan Musial, the first inductee, is represented with items worthy of being in Cooperstown.
Visitors can also see uniforms worn by greats such as Steve Gromek, Carol Blazejowski, Mark Fidrych and Ed Olczyk; the boxing gloves used by 1940s heavyweight champion Tony Zale; basketballs, baseballs, footballs, and bowling balls used and signed by Mike Krzyzewski, Whitey Kurowski, Ted Marchibroda, and Eddie Lubanski. Among other items is a football signed by Bob Skoronski, Vince Lombardi and other members of the 1967 Super Bowl I Champion Green Bay Packers.

In 2013, the Hall of Fame instituted its NPASHF Excellence in Sports Award and race driver Brad Keselowski was the initial recipient. Other winners include Liz Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Gary Kubiak, Joe Maddon, Dave Dombrowski, Sam Mikulak and Natalie Wojcik.

The Hall of Fame on June 20, 2019, named its inaugural Excellence in Media Award the Tony Kubek Award and Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN was the inaugural recipient. Sportswriter Joe Posnanski won in 2021 and hockey broadcaster Ken Kal in 2024.

At the Avenue of Stars, &quot;Aleja Gwiazd Sportowców Polonijnych&quot;, of Rzeszów, Poland, bronze plates with handprints of outstanding sportsmen of Polish origin were unveiled July 15, 2023, including NPASHF inductees Bob Brudzinski and Ann Meyers Drysdale.

The National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame held its 49th Annual Induction Banquet in June 2022, inducting Mark Dantonio, Mark Gubicza, Loree Jon Hasson and John Danowski. Celebrating 50 years, the NPASHF hosted a gala banquet with almost two dozen inductees on hand. Ann Meyers Drysdale served as keynote speaker and Jon Paul Morosi as master of ceremonies.

It is situated in the center of the state of São Paulo, near the following cities: Dois Córregos (9 km), Barra Bonita (13 km), Jaú (18 km), São Manuel (45 km), Torrinha (35 km), Igaraçu do Tietê (15 km), Lençois Paulista (46 km), Pederneiras (45 km) and Bauru (82 km). It is located at an altitude of 669 meters, near the Tietê River.

==History==
In the middle of the 19th century settlers from Minas Gerais came to the area. Therefore, the settlement was initially named &quot;Barrio dos Mineiros&quot;. Around 1875, a chapel was built and houses sprung up around it. In 1891 the village &quot;Capela de Mineiros&quot; became a district of the municipality Dois Córregos. In August 1899, it was elevated to town status, and it became an independent municipality with the name of Mineiros. Its name was changed to &quot;Mineiros do Tietê&quot; (after the Tietê River) in 1944.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>CompactRISC is a family of instruction set architectures from National Semiconductor.
The architectures are designed according to reduced instruction set computing principles, and are mainly used in microcontrollers.
The subarchitectures of this family are the 16-bit CR16 and CR16C and the 32-bit CRX.

== Architectures==
Features of CR16 family: compact implementations (less than 1 mm2 with 250 nm), addressing of 2 MB (2), frequencies up to 66 MHz, hardware multiplier for 16-bit integers.

It has complex instructions such as bit manipulation, saving/restoring and push/pop of several registers with single command.

CR16 has 16 general purpose registers of 16 bits, and address registers of 21 bits wide. There are 8 special registers: program counter, interrupt stack pointer ISP, interrupt vector address register INTBASE, status register PSR, configuration register and 3 debug registers. Status register implements flags: C, T, L, F, Z, N, E, P, I.

Instructions are encoded in two-address form in several formats, usually they have 16-bit encoding, but there are two formats for medium immediate instructions with length of 32-bit. Typical opcode length is 4 bits (bits 9–12 of most encoding types. Basic encoding formats are:
* Register-to-register,
* Short 5-bit immediate value to register,
* Medium immediate of 16-bit value to register (32-bit encoding),
* Load/store relative with short 5-bit displacement (2-bit opcode),
* Load/store relative with medium 18-bit displacement (32-bit encoding, 2-bit opcode).

CR16C comes with a different opcode encoding format, has 23–32-bit-wide address registers and provides two 32-bit general purpose registers.

CR16 implements traps and interrupts. Implementations of CR16 has three-stage pipeline: fetch, decode, execute.

== CR16 products==
CR16 was used in several National Semiconductor microcontrollers, and since 2001 integrated microcontrollers were available having built-in flash memory. Since 2007 CR16-based IP was available to licensing

<text>Robert Plutchik (21 October 1927 – 29 April 2006) was an American psychologist who was professor emeritus at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and adjunct professor at the University of South Florida. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia University. He authored or coauthored more than 260 articles, 45 chapters and eight books and edited seven books. His research interests included the study of emotions, the study of suicide and violence, and the study of the psychotherapy process.

==Theory of emotion==
Plutchik proposed a psychoevolutionary classification approach for general emotional responses. He identified eight primary emotions—anger, fear, sadness, disgust, surprise, anticipation, trust, and joy. Plutchik argues for the primacy of these emotions by showing each to be the trigger of behaviour with high survival value, such as the way fear inspires the fight-or-flight response.

Plutchik&#x27;s psychoevolutionary theory of basic emotions has ten postulates.
# The concept of emotion is applicable to all evolutionary levels and applies to all animals including humans.
# Emotions have an evolutionary history and have evolved various forms of expression in different species.
# Emotions served an adaptive role in helping organisms deal with key survival issues posed by the environment.
# Despite different forms of expression of emotions in different species, there are certain common elements, or prototype patterns, that can be identified.
# There is a small number of basic, primary, or prototype emotions.
# All other emotions are mixed or derivative states; that is, they occur as combinations, mixtures, or compounds of the primary emotions.
# Primary emotions are hypothetical constructs or idealized states whose properties and characteristics can only be inferred from various kinds of evidence.
# Primary emotions can be conceptualized in terms of pairs of polar opposites.
# All emotions vary in their degree of similarity to one another.
# Each emotion can exist in varying degrees of intensity or levels of arousal.

=== Plutchik&#x27;s wheel of emotions ===
Plutchik also created a wheel of emotions to illustrate different emotions. Plutchik first proposed his cone-shaped model (3D) or the wheel model (2D) in 1980 to describe how emotions were related.

He suggested eight primary bipolar emotions: joy versus sadness; anger versus fear; trust versus disgust; and surprise versus anticipation. Additionally, his circumplex model makes connections between the idea of an emotion circle and a color wheel. Like colors, primary emotions can be expressed at different intensities and can mix with one another to form different emotions.

The theory was extended to provide the basis for an explanation for psychological defence mechanisms; Plutchik proposed that eight defense mechanisms were manifestations of the eight core emotions.

==Publications==
Plutchik contributed the &quot;Emotions&quot; article to the encyclopedia, &quot;World Book Millennium 2000&quot;.

<text>Alexander Hamilton Willard (1777–1865) was a blacksmith who joined the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

==Biography==

===Origin===
Alexander Hamilton Willard Sr. was born in July 1777 in the town Charlestown, New Hampshire, he was the oldest son of Lt Jonathan Willard and the only child of Betty Caswell. 

===Expedition===
Willard had enlisted in a U.S. Army artillery company in 1800. 

During an unsuccessful search for Baker Bay as part of the Lewis and Clark experdition, Willard and George Shannon were ordered to camp out and wait for the main party. While they were sleeping on the beach, a group of Native Americans took their guns, leaving them unarmed. The main party returned in such a timely manner as to startle the Native Americans into returning the guns. Although Willard had redeemed himself by this point, he had previously received the harshest punishment distributed to a member of the Corps of Discovery; &quot;Court Martial on the Trail&quot;. The charges were lying down and sleeping at his post while on guard duty: a military crime punishable by death. The punishment was issued on July 12, 1804, and consisted of 100 lashes divided evenly over four straight days at sunset.

During a portage around the Missouri River Falls in July 1805, Alexander Willard was attacked by a &quot;White Bear&quot;, Clark gathered three men and chased the bear off. The island nearby later became known as White Bear Island in memory of that event.
In 1806 during his stay at Fort Clatsop, Willard fell ill and then recovered.

With the Corps of Discovery, he assisted John Shields as a blacksmith. In 1808, Meriwether Lewis hired him as government blacksmith for the Sauk and Fox Indians; the following year, he was appointed to the same position for the Delawares and Shawnees. He later served in the War of 1812.

===Marriage===
Half a year after the completion of the expedition, February 14, 1807, Alexander married Eleanor McDonald. She gave birth to their twelve children. They lived for many years at Platteville, Wisconsin.

The .410 started off in the United Kingdom as a garden gun along with the .360 and the No. 3 bore (9 mm) rimfire, No. 2 bore (7 mm) rimfire, and No. 1 bore (6 mm) rimfire. .410 shells have similar base dimensions to the .45 Colt cartridge, allowing many single-shot firearms, as well as derringers and revolvers chambered in that caliber, to fire .410 shot shells without any modifications.

== Origin ==
Lancaster&#x27;s pattern centerfire and pinfire .410 shot cartridges first appeared in Eley Brothers Ltd. flysheets in 1857. By 1874, Eley were advertising modern centerfire .410 cartridges. It appears to have become popular around 1900, although it was recommended as &quot;suited to the requirements of naturalists, garden guns and for such weapons as walking-stick guns&quot;, presumably for self-defense, in 1892 by W. W. Greener. The first ammunition was 2.0 inches (50.8 mm) long, compared with the modern 2.5 (63.5 mm) and sizes. Aluminum shells are available but are not reloadable, as are paper or plastic shells. Full length brass shells can be found and are reloadable. Brass shells can be made from .444 Marlin rifle cartridges, and these are reloadable .

Shotguns in .410 loaded with shot shells are well suited for small game hunting and pest control. Such game or pests include rabbits, squirrels, snakes, rats, and birds. A .410 loaded with 1/4 ounce slugs is effective against larger animals such as coyotes and deer.

While a .410 is inferior to the traditional 12-gauge shotshell for defensive use, a number of companies market defensive guns chambered in .410, such as the Mossberg 500 Home Security Model shotgun, the Smith &amp; Wesson Governor revolver, and the Taurus Judge revolver. Defensive ammunition such as buckshot, slugs and combination loads are common. American Derringer and Winchester market ammunition loaded with five 000 buckshot pellets in shells and three pellets in shells. Combination shells such as Winchester Supreme Elite .410 shells are loaded with three 71 grain disks and twelve BB pellets.

== Survival arms ==

The small size of the .410 bore makes it popular for use in compact firearms carried for emergency use, and it is often found in over-and-under combination guns, with a .22 Hornet or .22 rimfire rifle barrel mounted above and a .410 bore shotgun barrel mounted below.

The Snake Charmer is a .410 bore, stainless-steel, single-shot, break-action shotgun with an exposed hammer, an barrel, black molded plastic furniture, and a short thumb-hole buttstock that holds four additional shotgun shells. These light-weight guns have an overall length of . They are commonly used by gardeners and farmers for pest control. It originally sold for $89.95 and was marketed as a general-purpose utility shotgun &quot;perfect&quot; for &quot;fishing — hunting — camping — back packing — survival — home defense — truck or Jeep gun&quot;.

The Savage Model 24 is an American-made, over-and-under, combination gun, manufactured by Savage Arms. The basic .22LR over .410 bore model weighs , has barrels, and an overall length of . It may also be disassembled for ease of stowage. Its predecessor was made by Stevens and sported a tenite stock and forearm. In WWII, 15,000 were ordered and issued in air crew survival kits for Army Air Force bomber crews to be used as survival arms in the event that they were shot down.

The M6 aircrew survival weapon was made for the US Air Force, with a .22 Hornet rifle barrel mounted over a .410 bore shotgun barrel and was first issued in the Korean War. The military also lists an aluminum .410 shell, with a rifle primer, as standard issue under the ammunition inventory name M-35. The civilian version Springfield Armory M6 Scout has a .22 rimfire or .22 Hornet over a .410 bore shotgun barrel. The original M6 has a barrel, the same length as the stock, and folds in half for storage, making a compact package. With the short barrel, this is legally classified as an &quot;any other weapon&quot; in the United States, so the M6 Scout is made with barrels for civilian sales. Special flare cartridges in .410 were issued with the USAF model.

== Handguns and shot pistols ==
The fact that the .410 bore shell fits in a .45 Colt chamber has resulted in some unusual applications. While shotguns are often limited in minimum length, a firearm chambered in .45 Colt, such as the Contender pistol, is not defined as a shotgun even though it can chamber shotgun shells. In the UK, .410 shot-pistols are used around pheasant pens to kill rats where a full-length shotgun would be inappropriate.

The Thompson Center Arms Contender pistols are commonly encountered with a special .45 Colt/.410 bore barrel. The barrel is rifled for the .45 Colt but has a special choke and vent rib to make it function as a shotgun. Due to the rifled barrel, the assembled firearm is considered a rifle or pistol (depending on barrel length) and thus is not subject to the United States&#x27; National Firearms Act&#x27;s minimum barrel length. Nonetheless, possession of a Thompson Center Arms .45/.410 pistol barrel is illegal in California, for both dealers and individuals, and such a barrel may not legally be shipped into the state, or even taken into California for a hunting trip, by reason of it being classified as a short barreled shotgun (SBSG) when used with a Contender receiver.

American Derringer has long offered .45 Colt-.410 bore Derringers.
Bond Arms also offers various Derringer models which chamber both .45 Colt cartridges and .410 shotshell.

Also, Taurus, Magnum Research, and Smith &amp; Wesson offer revolvers with extended cylinders, long enough to hold .410 shells as well. Magnum Research offers a single-action revolver in their BFR (big frame revolver) line, while the Taurus Judge is similar in price to their other double-action revolvers, with the Raging Judge model capable of chambering and firing the .454 Casull cartridge. The Smith &amp; Wesson Governor is a double-action revolver also capable of firing .45 Colt as well as .45 ACP cartridges with the aid of moon clips. The discontinued MIL Thunder 5 is also chambered in .410-bore. Over the years, a large number of devices have been made that will convert larger-gauge shotguns to accept .410 shotgun shells.

== Capacity, compared to other gauges ==

Most shotgun cartridges are measured in terms of &quot;shotgun gauge&quot;. Shotgun gauge is determined by the weight of a round lead ball that is sized to fit into its barrel. For example, the barrel of a 12-gauge shotgun is equal to the diameter of a 1/12 of a pound lead ball (0.729 in) and a 20-gauge can fit a 1/20 pound lead ball (0.615 in). Using this method, a .410 bore is equivalent to a (hypothetical) 67-gauge, instead of the incorrectly labeled 36 gauge (0.506) in Europe and South America.

<doc id="1058064" wikidata="Q1122422" url="?curid=1058064" title="Paraguayan Civil War (1947)">
<text>The Paraguayan Civil War (also known as the Barefoot Revolution and the Third Paraguayan Civil War) was a civil war in Paraguay that lasted from 7 March to 20 August 1947.

== Background ==

In 1940 President Higinio Morínigo suspended the constitution and banned political parties. Resistance to his rule took the form of general strikes and student riots. In 1946 Morínigo legalized political activity and formed a cabinet with the Febrerista Revolutionary Concentration and the Colorado Party. The Febreristas resigned from the coalition on January 11, 1947, angry that Morínigo seemed to be favoring the Colorados.

== Conflict ==
The Febreristas made common cause with the Liberal Party and the Paraguayan Communist Party. Former Paraguayan president and founder of the Febrerista Party Rafael Franco led a rebellion that mushroomed into a civil war as the Paraguayan armed forces, which had previously remained loyal, split.

The Communist Party became increasingly active, organizing rural peasants and workers and pushing for agrarian reform. Meanwhile, the United States began a campaign to combat communism throughout the Americas, which included supporting right-wing governments and political movements. As a result, the U.S. backed Juan Natalicio Gonzalez, a wealthy landowner and political ally, in leading the 1947 coup against President Morinigo. 

On the rebels&#x27; side were all the political parties except the Colorados, most of the bankers and administrators and 80% of military officers. Out of 11 army divisions, four joined the rebels: on March 8 the two infantry divisions at Concepcion rebelled, joined by the two Chaco infantry divisions a few days later.

On the government&#x27;s side were the Colorados, three cavalry divisions at Campo Grande; three Asunción divisions (infantry, signallers and engineers) and the artillery division from Paraguari equipped with World War II American weapons, specifically M1 Garand rifles and American-supplied captured weapons such as the German MP 40 submachine gun, giving the Colorados superior firepower. Most importantly, Argentina under Juan Perón gave vital support to the government without which they might well have fallen.

On April 27 the navy joined the rebellion and shelled Asunción; they were fought off by the artillery division that had come from Paraguarí, commanded by Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. The largest gunboats of the fleet, &quot;Paraguay&quot; and &quot;Humaita&quot;, were seized by the rebels in Buenos Aires while they were undergoing repairs.

Morínigo fought back and eventually gained the upper hand, and had won back control by August 1947. A third of the population had fled.

<doc id="1058065" wikidata="Q1765909" url="?curid=1058065" title="Rochester Community Sports Complex Stadium">
<text>Rochester Community Sports Complex Stadium, also called the &quot;downtown soccer stadium&quot;, is a soccer-specific stadium in Rochester, New York within the Rochester Community Sports Complex. It is home to the Flower City Union of the National Premier Soccer League. Previously to the Flower City Union, the stadium was home in 2018 to the Rochester Lancers and Lady Lancers of the NPSL and UWS, respectively. The stadium originally hosted the Rochester Rhinos of the USL, the Rochester Rattlers of MLL, and the Western New York Flash of the NWSL.

The stadium hosts other sporting events such as collegiate soccer, Rochester Rhinos Elite youth soccer games and practices, American football, field hockey and drum and bugle corps competitions as well as concerts, as well as occasionally hosting the New York State Public High School Athletic Association (NYSPHSAA) Section V football championship and Far West Regional championship (played between Sections V and VI). It is owned by the City of Rochester and is operated as a youth sports complex.

==History==
The stadium was designed by HOK Sport (now Populous). It was constructed on a filled-in section of the Erie Canal&#x27;s original routing through Rochester. This was also once the route of the Rochester Subway, which was built in the old canal bed and ended operations in 1956. The facility was funded jointly by the state of New York, the city of Rochester, and the Rhinos (the State of New York paying $23 million while the Rhinos and the city paid the remaining amount) with a total cost of some 30 million. Infrastructure improvements will be paid for by the city of Rochester.

The park hit some minor stumbling blocks even before the first shovel hit dirt: the original designs needed to be revised when it was revealed that the playing field was below the water table, and the environmental impact report revealed that the site had pockets of petroleum that needed to be treated. The groundbreaking took place on July 9, 2004, and the first phase of the construction was completed. The stadium had its grand opening (as PAETEC Park) on June 3, 2006, which featured the Rhinos&#x27; first home game of the season. The game was played in front of a capacity crowd of 13,768 fans and ended in a 2–2 draw against the Virginia Beach Mariners.

On August 22, 2018, it was announced that the Rhinos, then on a 1-year hiatus from the United Soccer League, would be leaving Marina Auto Stadium to pursue building a new stadium in the suburbs of Rochester.

In 2021, the city of Rochester added new facilities on the property that includes the stadium, by adding an indoor training facility to the Rochester Community Sports Complex.

===Naming rights===
Naming rights to the park were purchased by PAETEC Communications, a local telecommunications company, in 2004 for a reported total of $23 million over 12 years. When the club changed ownership, the agreement was voided at the end of the 2008 season.

The stadium then became known as Rochester Rhinos Stadium. In mid-2009, the team had a raffle to determine the naming rights for the stadium. For each $1,000 an individual, group, company, or other entity paid to the Rhinos, they were given one chance to win the right to name the stadium. On May 30, 2009, the night of the Rhinos&#x27; 2009 home opener, Marina Auto Group, a Webster-based automobile dealership group, won the raffle. The Marina Auto name was retained through 2010 under a traditional naming rights agreement.

On February 10, 2011, it was announced that the new name of the stadium would be Sahlen&#x27;s Stadium after the deal with Marina Auto expired. This was part of a five-year naming rights agreement with Sahlen&#x27;s Packing Company, Inc. of Buffalo, New York, with an option to renew the agreement for another five years. The cost of the agreement was not released, but was estimated at $2 million. In October 2015, the stadium operators announced that they would not exercise the option to continue the existing naming agreement with Sahlen&#x27;s, but would instead seek a new agreement. In the interim, the stadium reverted to being known as Rochester Rhinos Stadium. On January 24, 2017, Capelli Sport entered a corporate partnership with the Rhinos and the stadium was renamed Capelli Sport Stadium.

Marina Auto Group entered into a new naming rights deal in 2018, reverting the name of the stadium back to Marina Auto Stadium. Without a regular tenant from 2019 the facility became known as &quot;the downtown soccer stadium&quot; as part of the City of Rochester&#x27;s Community Sports Complex.

==Events==
The Rochester Rhinos and Rochester Rhinos Women soccer teams of the USL First Division and USL W-League, respectively, and the Rochester Rattlers of Major League Lacrosse moved to the facility in 2006. The Rattlers were dissolved following the 2008 MLL season but returned for the 2011 MLL season. The Rochester Rhinos Women dissolved and were replaced by the Rochester Ravens in 2009; the Ravens were replaced by the Western New York Flash in 2011. The Flash then played matches in the stadium until they were purchased in January 2017 and moved to Cary, North Carolina.

<doc id="1058067" wikidata="Q1470515" url="?curid=1058067" title="Jet Set Radio">
<text>(originally released in North America as Jet Grind Radio) is a 2000 action game developed by Smilebit and published by Sega for the Dreamcast. The player controls a member of a youth gang, the GG&#x27;s, as they use inline skates to traverse Tokyo, spraying graffiti, challenging rival gangs, and evading authorities.

Development was headed by director Masayoshi Kikuchi, with art by Ryuta Ueda. The team drew influence from late 1990s Japanese popular culture such as the rhythm game &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot; and the anti-establishment themes in the film &quot;Fight Club&quot;, and 1980s American hip hop culture such as graffiti. The environments were based on Tokyo shopping districts in Shibuya and Shinjuku, with graffiti designed by artists including Eric Haze. &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; was the first game to use a cel-shaded art style, developed in response to the team&#x27;s disappointment with the abundance of sci-fi and fantasy Sega games.

&quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; received acclaim and is considered one of the best games of its decade for its graphics, soundtrack and gameplay. It won several awards and was nominated for many others. A Game Boy Advance version, developed by Vicarious Visions, was released in 2003, along with versions for Japanese mobile phones. In 2012, &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; was rereleased for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, iOS, Windows, PlayStation Vita and Android. A sequel, &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot;, was released for the Xbox in 2002. Sega announced a new &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; game in 2023.

== Gameplay ==

The player controls a member of a gang of graffiti-tagging inline skaters. The game consists of three types of levels: Street, Rival Showdown, and Trial. The Street levels come in two categories. The first is to tag every graffiti point in each area previously tagged by a rival gang before the timer runs out while evading the authorities. The second category serves as a boss battle by chasing the rival gang members and spraying graffiti on them. The more graffiti points are sprayed, the more deadly the authorities become. Graffiti points are marked by arrows and require paint to tag them. Players can spray graffiti by either pressing a single button or inputting commands using the analog stick depending on the size of the graffiti spot. Players are unable to spray graffiti if they run out of paint, which must be refilled by obtaining yellow and blue spray cans scattered across the stage. Yellow spray cans refill a single spray can, and blue spray cans refill five. Enemies will pursue players and attempt to deplete their health. Health can be replenished by obtaining red and green spray cans. Performing tricks adds bonus points to the player&#x27;s overall score and can help the player gain access to areas difficult to reach.

In Rival Showdown levels, more playable characters can be unlocked after they are defeated by matching the rival&#x27;s movements in technique sections or by spraying graffiti before the rival in race sections. Trial levels are unlocked after Street and Rival Showdown levels are cleared in a specific area. There are three kinds of trials: Jet Graffiti, Jet Tech, and Jet Crash. In Jet Graffiti, the objective is to spray all the graffiti points within the time limit. Jet Tech prioritizes in obtaining the top score within the time limit. In Jet Crash, the objective is to reach the goal and spray graffiti on it before the opponent. Players can customize their graffiti by choosing presets, or create their own using the Graffiti editor. By using a VMU, players can upload their graffiti to the official website for other players to use or download graffiti from other players. More Graffiti presets can be unlocked by collecting Graffiti Soul icons scattered throughout stages.

== Plot ==
DJ Professor K broadcasts the pirate radio station Jet Set Radio to gangs of youths known as the Rudies, who roam Tokyo-to, skating and spraying graffiti as their means of expressing themselves to the world. One gang, the GG&#x27;s, competes for turf with the all-female jilted lovers Love Shockers in the shopping districts of Shibuya-cho, the cyborg otaku Noise Tanks in the Benten-cho entertainment district, and the kaiju-loving Poison Jam in the Kogane-cho dockyard. The authorities, led by Captain Onishima, pursue the gangs with riot police and military armaments. After the GG&#x27;s defeat Poison Jam, Noise Tanks, and Love Shockers in turf wars, they each drop a piece of a mysterious vinyl record. Professor K says that the mysterious vinyl record collected is the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Contract&quot; and has the power to summon a demon.

The GG&#x27;s are joined by Combo and Cube, who explain that their hometown, Grind City, has been overtaken by the Rokkaku Group business conglomerate. They ask the GG&#x27;s to help them to free their friend, Coin, who has been captured by the Rokkaku Group, due to their interest in his massive vinyl collection. The Rokkaku pursue the GG&#x27;s and steal the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Contract&quot;. Poison Jam explains that the Rokkaku CEO, Goji Rokkaku, plans to use the record to make a contract with the demon and take over the world. The GG&#x27;s defeat Goji in the rooftop of his headquarters by destroying his turntable and render him powerless to the evil powers summoned by tagging his forehead. Freedom is returned to the streets of Tokyo-to. In a twist, Combo reveals that the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Contract&quot; is an old record with no demonic powers and that wealth had driven Goji to insanity. DJ Professor K addresses to those with doubts in his audience that this story is up to them to believe, but he ends the transmission with &quot;On the streets, there&#x27;s no such thing as &#x27;The End&#x27;!&quot;

== Development ==

&quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; was developed by Smilebit, a Sega studio formed from members of Team Andromeda, the developers of the &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; games for the Sega Saturn. The development team consisted of fewer than 25 developers, with an average age of under 25. Programming began in mid-1999. The game was presented at the 1999 Tokyo Game Show and drew media attention for its cel-shaded style. During the early stages of development, director Masayoshi Kikuchi had difficulty leading the team without prior directing experience. The visual style was established prior to the gameplay; according to Kikuchi, it could have become an adventure game or role-playing game. His superiors were not satisfied with early concepts, and so Kikuchi used trial and error to develop a concept that he believed everyone would find interesting.

Ueda wanted to create something &quot;cool&quot; that dealt with popular culture and was completely unlike the team&#x27;s previous game, the 1998 role-playing game &quot;Panzer Dragoon Saga&quot;. Ueda&#x27;s drawings of a punky character with headphones and rollerblades became the foundation of the game. Ueda had joined Sega after being impressed by the &quot;freshness&quot; and international appeal of Sonic the Hedgehog, but was disappointed with the excessive focused saturation of overtly fantastical manga and anime-style designs, and hoped to create something original. Smilebit drew inspiration from games outside the typical game genres of science fiction and fantasy. Ueda was particularly inspired by a demonstration of the PlayStation rhythm game &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot; at the 1996 Tokyo Game Show: &quot;I think that&#x27;s the first game with pop culture like that. They did it first. After that I decided to make a true game, not just a visual experience, that was actually for adults.&quot; The anti-establishment themes of the 1999 film &quot;Fight Club&quot; were another influence.

Smilebit used thicker lines for stand-out objects. Smilebit developed a new cel-shading technique not used at the time as it would not have been possible on the Dreamcast or PlayStation 2. The game features graffiti by a variety of artists, including Eric Haze, who had designed album art for acts including the Beastie Boys and Public Enemy. Smilebit initially planned to make a skateboarding game, but this was changed due to the legs having to be fixed.

&quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; was one of the earliest games to feature an open 3D world, which presented the team&#x27;s biggest challenge. Kikuchi said: &quot;Making an entire town in a game was quite the prospect. It&#x27;s not hard with modern hi-spec hardware, but that wasn&#x27;t the case back then... It was very difficult from a programming standpoint.&quot; Another Sega game developed in that period, &quot;Shenmue&quot; (1999), also featured an open world, but Kikuchi said the games posed different technical challenges, as &quot;Shenmue&quot; does not allow the player to jump or move at speed. The team implemented grinding to allow players to enjoy speed without worrying about colliding with obstacles. Smilebit chose to have a fixed camera as an attempt to reduce motion sickness. They attempted to make the game impossible to duplicate on PlayStation 2 by pushing the Dreamcast limitations using bright colors, realistic shadows, and more than sixteen NPCs on-screen without lag that would have been impossible on PS2 due to its smaller memory.

The settings were inspired by Japanese locations such as the Tokyo shopping districts of Shibuya and Shinjuku, which Smilebit photographed to use as references. Sega feared that the game&#x27;s style might alienate players outside Japan and requested changes for the international versions. The team added stages modeled after New York City: one based on Times Square, and another on Roosevelt Avenue along Queens and Brooklyn, and changed the nationality of two characters to American. The interactive credits sequence of the Japanese version was also cut, as localizing it would have meant rebuilding the stage with English names. Sega sold the international version in Japan as &quot;De La Jet Set Radio&quot;. Ueda was unhappy about the changes, which he said diminished the game&#x27;s essential Japanese elements.

=== Soundtrack ===
The &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; soundtrack includes original and licensed tracks with a variety of genres including J-pop, hip hop, funk, electronic dance, rock, acid jazz, and trip hop. The main theme of the game is called &quot;Let Mom Sleep&quot;. The North American version and international rereleases add metal songs. The 2012 port omits &quot;Yappie Feet&quot; and &quot;Many Styles&quot; for licensing reasons. The music has been described as energetic, rhythm-heavy, defiant, and multicultural. Most of the soundtrack was composed by Hideki Naganuma, with additional tracks by Richard Jacques, Deavid Soul, Toronto, and B.B. Rights. Naganuma attempted to match the visual style, and experimented with voices, cutting, and rearranging samples to the point that they became nonsensical. In 2012, Naganuma said &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; and its sequel had been his favorite projects. Smilebit worked with Sega of America and Sega of Europe to include as many street culture elements as possible, hoping to create music that was internationally acceptable.

A soundtrack CD, &quot;Jet Grind Radio Music Sampler&quot;, was given to those who pre-ordered the game in the United States, featuring 10 tracks from the game, 4 of which do not appear in any version of &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot;. It was distributed by Interscope Records. The soundtrack CD, &quot;Jet Set Radio Original Soundtrack&quot; (UPCH-1048), featured 19 tracks including a data track from the game and was distributed by Polydor Records on December 20, 2000, in Japan. For the HD release, a new soundtrack CD titled &quot;Jet Set Radio: Original Soundtrack with Bonus Tracks from JSRF&quot;, was distributed by Sumthing Else on September 18, 2012, for North America and Europe, containing a total of 17 tracks, 10 from the game and 7 additional tracks from the sequel, &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot;. A second soundtrack for the HD version, &quot;Jet Set Radio Sega Original Tracks&quot;, was distributed by Sega, containing 15 tracks and was released on iTunes on October 3, 2012 alongside &quot;Jet Set Radio Future Sega Original Tracks&quot;.

=== Promotion and release ===
&quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; was released in Japan on June 29, 2000. In North America, it was released on October 31 as &quot;Jet Grind Radio&quot; due to trademark problems for &quot;Jet Set&quot; in the United States at the time. The PAL version was released later on November 24 under the original name. The North American and PAL versions contained two new maps, new songs, and other in-game content designed to increase the game&#x27;s appeal to Western audiences. To promote the North American release, Sega of America held a &quot;Graffiti is Art&quot; competition for contestants to enter their own graffiti art pieces to Sega. Sega chose five finalists and flew them into San Francisco, California on October 21, where they competed to make graffiti art pieces on a canvas within a 3 and a half-hour timeframe for a prize of $5000. Mayor of San Francisco, Willie Brown discovered the competition and attempted to revoke Sega of America&#x27;s permit, but was unsuccessful due to obtaining the permit legally.

== Alternative versions ==
Sega re-released the game in Japan under the name This version was released on October 18, 2001, in Japan via Dreamcast Direct (later renamed Sega Direct) and included a T-shirt featuring the protagonist Beat for those who pre-ordered. This version features content that was originally exclusive to PAL and North American versions, namely music from the PAL release, two playable characters, and two stages.

=== Mobile versions ===

&quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; was remade as two 2D mobile versions. The first, a side-scrolling game in which players escape police, was released for Japanese mobile phones by Sega on June 22, 2001. It was followed by a remake for Game Boy Advance developed by Vicarious Visions and published by THQ in North America on June 26, 2003, and in Europe on February 20, 2004. The Game Boy Advance version uses the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot; engine and an isometric perspective, and it emulates the cel-shaded graphics of the Dreamcast game, with some original stages and shortened songs.

=== High-definition remaster ===
In 2012, high-definition ports developed by BlitWorks were released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows, PlayStation Vita, iOS, and Android. The ports add features, including widescreen HD graphics, online leaderboards, achievements, and a new camera system. It combines the North American, European, and Japanese versions&#x27; soundtracks and adds bonus tracks from &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot;, but it omits the PAL version&#x27;s tracks &quot;Yappie Feet&quot; and &quot;Many Styles&quot;. To promote the ports, Sega ran a contest to allow players to submit their own artwork to be used as graffiti within the game. The game was made backwards-compatible with the Xbox One in May 2016.

In North America, the PS3 version was released on September 18, with PlayStation Plus members able to purchase it early on September 11. The PS3 version was released in Europe the following day alongside The Xbox Live Arcade and Windows version for both North America and Europe. The PlayStation Vita version was scheduled for release on October 16, but was delayed for development optimization reasons; it was released on November 20 in North America and in Europe the following day. The PS3, Xbox 360, and PlayStation Vita versions were released in Japan simultaneously on February 20, 2013.

The iOS and Android versions were released in North America and Europe on November 29, 2012. Japan received the iOS version on December 20, 2012 and Android on January 30, 2013. The smartphone versions were delisted as of 2015 due to compatibility problems with iOS updates.

The Xbox 360 version of Jet Set Radio was delisted off the Xbox Live Arcade store in February 2023, but is still available for download for those who own it. The Steam version of the game was similarly delisted on December 6, 2024; along with every other game that was featured in the Dreamcast Collection; except for Sonic Adventure and its sequel.

== Reception ==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; received acclaim for its gameplay, visual style, and music. &quot;Gamers&#x27; Republic&quot; called it flawless. &quot;IGN&quot; praised the extra gameplay modes, saying they added replay value. &quot;Official Dreamcast Magazine&quot; (&quot;ODCM&quot;) found the exaggerated physics and interactivity of the levels immersive. &quot;DC-UK&quot; described the gameplay as a combination of &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; and &quot;Tony Hawk&quot; and concluded that the gameplay was better than both. &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the pacing, stating that the beginning of the game is simple and slowly becomes more challenging as the player progresses. &quot;GameFan&quot; was not impressed with the early stages, but their opinion changed as they progressed the game and were happy with the result. &quot;Next Generation&quot; found the story modifications of the English versions jarring, although, he complimented the new stages, calling them &quot;impressive&quot; and &quot;a worthy addition to Japanese cityscapes of the original&quot;. The camera controls were commonly criticized, but most reviewers said the overall quality outweighed them.

&quot;IGN&quot; said the visual style &quot;looks like a moving cartoon, and every character, right down to the police dogs, is practically overflowing with personality ... It has the type of look that makes non-gamers can&#x27;t help but be impressed&quot;. &quot;ODCM&quot; called it &quot;gorgeous&quot; and compared it to the move to color television. &quot;DC-UK&quot; also praised it for resembling a 2D cartoon in 3D space, and considered it ground-breaking. &quot;GamePro&quot; wrote that the visuals were unique and that the stylized design was convincing and fun.

&quot;GamePro&quot; called &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; one of the best-sounding games of the year for its soundtrack, and &quot;ODCM&quot; said it had &quot;one of the best soundtracks ever&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; also praised the soundtrack, but was critical of the tracks added to the North American release, in particular songs from Rob Zombie. &quot;Next Generation&quot;, however, did not consider the new tracks to make a difference, stating the soundtrack was incredible from the start. &quot;GameSpot&quot; said the soundtrack fit perfectly into the game&#x27;s environment.

When reviewing the HD remaster, the game received mixed reactions from critics. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; praised how it is a joy to play even 12 years after its release. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; also gave positive statements, calling the visual style &quot;timeless&quot;, and complimented the HD remaster, stating &quot;12 years on and this is a surprisingly rigorous game built of oddball delights, then, and the HD updating has only enhanced its charms. The skating&#x27;s still great, the city&#x27;s still a joy to explore, and the soundtrack&#x27;s still one of the very best ever put together&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; was more critical, opining that the gameplay was archaic and frustrating. &quot;Game Informer&quot; further elaborated that in retrospect, the originally released visual style blinded them from its faulty gameplay. Both &quot;TouchArcade&quot; and &quot;Pocket Gamer&quot; criticized smartphone versions for the touchscreen controls and unable to keep up with the tasks the game requires.

Across all versions of the game combined, including the original and re-releases, sales of &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; surpassed 1 million copies worldwide.

===Accolades===
&quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; won the Best Console Game at the E3 Game Critics Awards in 2000 and was the runner up for Best in Show at the same event. The game won the category of &quot;Excellence in Visual Arts&quot; award, received a &quot;Game Spotlights Award&quot; and was nominated for Game of the year at the 2001 Game Developers Choice Awards. &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; received nominations for the &quot;Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Console Innovation&quot;, &quot;Art Direction&quot;, &quot;Game Design&quot;, &quot;Original Musical Composition&quot;, &quot;Sound Design&quot;, and &quot;Visual Engineering&quot; categories at the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards (the most nominated game at that ceremony). It won GameSpot&#x27;s annual &quot;Best Graphics, Artistic&quot; award among console games, and was nominated in the &quot;Best Game Music&quot; and &quot;Best Platform Game&quot; categories. &quot;Gamers&#x27; Republic&quot; awarded it &quot;Best 3D Game Design&quot; in its 2000 Year in Review. The game was also featured in &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; also holds a Guiness World Record for the first video game to use cel-shading.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; is recognized as one of the first games to feature cel-shaded graphics, with exaggerated shapes, thick lines, and flat, bright colors. Insomniac owner Ted Price credited it as an influence on their game &quot;Sunset Overdrive&quot;. Numerous indie developers have cited &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; as a major influence on their games, the most notable being the successfully crowdfunded &quot;Hover: Revolt of Gamers&quot;, &quot;Lethal League&quot;, and &quot;Bomb Rush Cyberfunk&quot;, all of which draw heavy inspiration from &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot;″s visuals and music and feature contributions from its composer, Hideki Naganuma. The game has also been speedrun at Games Done Quick multiple times. Other fan community-based &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; projects include &quot;Jet Set Radio Live&quot;, a 24/7 browser-based radio station based on the fictional radio station in-game created in January 2016 and the albums &quot;Memories of Tokyo-To&quot; released on February 20, 2018 and &quot;Sounds of Tokyo-To Future&quot; by American musician 2 Mello on August 24, 2021.

A sequel, &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot;, was released for the Xbox in 2002, early in the system&#x27;s life cycle. Two main characters, Beat and Gum, are playable characters in &quot;Sega Superstars Tennis&quot; and &quot;Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed&quot;, and the former appears in &quot;Sonic Universe&quot; issue #45, an adaptation of the game along with &quot;Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing&quot;.

In 2009, an early antagonist in the game, Captain Onishima, was ranked 95th in IGN&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Videogame Villains&quot; list. &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; and &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot; are highly requested games to be ported to the Xbox One, the Xbox Series X/S, and the Nintendo Switch. In 2021, Sega teased the possibility of a &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; reboot, and announced Beat as a playable character for &quot;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania&quot;. Sega announced a new &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; game at the Game Awards 2023.

However, it was often shown as Abbotsford, Waipawa and Waipawa was more commonly used alone after the opening of the Waipawa railway station and &quot;Waipawa Mail&quot; in the late 1870s.

A local newspaper, the &quot;Waipawa Mail&quot;, was published for most of the period from 1878 to 1980. It was one of 45 started by Joseph Ivess. In 1980 it merged to become the &quot;CHB Mail&quot;, which is now a free weekly paper, published in Waipukurau.

The local government is made up of a mayor (in Brazil, &quot;Prefeito&quot;) and a municipal council (in Brazil, &quot;Câmara Municipal.&quot;) The current mayor is Eduardo Ribeiro Barison, from the PSD, who was elected in the 2020 municipal elections.

== Demography ==
Total Population: 67,681 (IBGE/2022 est.)

Population density (inhab./km²): 79.14

=== Ethnicities ===

Source: Censo 2022

=== Immigration ===
After the abolition of slavery in 1888, Mococa began to receive a large number of immigrants to work on the coffee plantations. Among the immigrants, the majority were Italians, numbering between 9,000 and 10,000, coming mainly from the regions of Lombardy, Veneto, Lazio, Campania and Sicily. But there were also Germans, mainly from the Bavaria region, Austrians, Portuguese; Spanish from Andalusia and Galicia and, to a lesser extent, Lebanese, among others. The current population is the result of the miscegenation of these immigrants; it is estimated that the majority have at least one Italian ancestor.

<text>Euskal Herritarrok (, EH) was a Basque independentist and socialist political party in the Basque Country. EH was banned in 2003 by the Supreme Court of Spain on the grounds that it sympathized with ETA.

==History==
In February 2000, Batzarre and Zutik left EH after the rupture of the ETA 1998-2000 truce, due to the absence of any condemnation of that fact by EH. In June 2000 a sector of Herri Batasuna also decided to split and form the Aralar Party, that openly and fully rejected ETA and its rupture of the truce.

<doc id="1058083" wikidata="Q1027201" url="?curid=1058083" title="Bad Religion (EP)">
<text>Bad Religion (also referred to as The Bad Religion EP) is the first official recording by the Los Angeles punk rock band Bad Religion. It was released in February 1981 by guitarist Brett Gurewitz&#x27;s record label Epitaph Records, with the catalog number EPI 001.

==Recording==
The recording sessions for the EP took place in October 1980 at a demo studio called Studio 9, located above an office and drugstore in Los Angeles on Sunset Boulevard and Western Avenue. The EP was mastered by Stan Ross at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood. At the time of the EP&#x27;s release, vocalist Greg Graffin and bassist Jay Bentley were both 16 years old, while Gurewitz and drummer Jay Ziskrout were both 18. The EP was financed by a loan from Gurewitz&#x27;s father, Richard Gurewitz, who is listed as co-producer under the moniker &#x27;Big Dick&#x27;.

The song &quot;Drastic Actions&quot; is influenced by the Germs&#x27; track &quot;Shut Down (Annihilation Man)&quot;.

==Reissues==
The &quot;Bad Religion&quot; EP has been reissued a number of times, mostly on vinyl. It was initially released on 7-inch vinyl, and reissued in 1984 as a 12-inch with a different sound mix. In West Germany, a 7&quot; bootleg limited edition of the EP was released in 1989, packaged with then-current album &quot;No Control&quot;. The EP was also pressed on compact cassettes, but those editions are rare. While the &quot;Bad Religion&quot; EP has never been released as a standalone CD, it was included on the 1991 compilation album &quot;80–85&quot;, and on the 2004 CD reissue of the group&#x27;s 1982 debut studio album, &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot;, which featured the same track listing as &quot;80–85&quot;. The EP was reissued on April 18, 2009, in conjunction with Record Store Day, in a limited edition of 1,000.

==Reception==

At the time of the original release, the &quot;Bad Religion&quot; EP received positive reviews from various fanzines. Brenda Jamrus of the punk rock magazine &quot;Ripper&quot; called the EP &quot;a real powerful six song EP from Bad Religion&quot;. She added that &quot;when so many bands are moving away from political overtones, these four guys are keeping politics alive&quot; and described the songs as &quot;fast and solid&quot;.

Dave Stimson reviewed the EP for the 16th issue of &quot;Touch and Go&quot;. In it, he said, &quot;Unlike many LA based bands where all it takes is one listen and you&#x27;re already dripping slobber on the floor, Bad Religion takes some time before winning over their legion of fans, which must be many cuz [&quot;sic&quot;] this is a great record. When you first hear it, you say same old LA-styled punk, good, but nothing to get excited about. Now that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re wrong. This is perhaps the best debut record since &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot;. I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it...something like Black Flag meets Neg Trend&quot;.

<text>Hagemans Crossing is an unincorporated community in Union Township, Warren County, Ohio, United States. Located in the western part of the township, it is located on the old Cincinnati and Xenia Pike, now U.S. Route 42, about halfway between Lebanon and Mason. It was at the crossing of the Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad and the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway and was about two miles northwest of the M&amp;C&#x27;s eastern terminus at Middletown Junction.

Variant names were Camp Hageman, Camp Hagerman, Hageman Station, and Hagerman. A post office called Camp Hagerman was established in 1877, and remained in operation until 1908. The community was named for the Rev. R.S. Hageman, an early settler.

<doc id="1058086" wikidata="Q101833396" url="?curid=1058086" title="Number Munchers">
<text>Number Munchers is an educational video game and a spin-off of &quot;Word Munchers&quot;. It was released by MECC for Apple II in 1986, then MS-DOS and Mac in 1990. The concept of the game was designed by R. Philip Bouchard, who also designed &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;. Two versions of the game were released the Consumer Version (for home use) and the School Version (for classrooms). After The Learning Company acquired MECC, the game was rebranded as &quot;Math Munchers&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The player controls the muncher who must move around a grid and munch on numbers that match the logic rule above while avoiding the threatening troggles. As the player progresses the levels, the logic rules have bigger numbers, and harder difficulty and multiple troggles pursue the muncher.

=== Modes of play ===
There are five different modes of play in Number Munchers to advance players&#x27; mathematical skills. These modes include Multiples, Factors, Primes, Equalities, and Inequalities:

* Multiples - the objective is to find multiples of the number given. If presented with a 3, one would select numbers like 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.
* Factors - the objective is to find factors of the number given. If the number is 12, one would choose to eat 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
* Primes - this mode helps players find prime numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves, e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.
* Equality - this mode gives players the chance to find equations equaling the current number. If given the number 6, one would &#x27;munch&#x27; 3 x 2, 3 + 3, 12 / 2, and so on.
* Inequality - this mode gives players the number and they must select the equations that DO NOT equal the current number. If given 6, one would eat equations such as 4 X 2, 18 / 9, and 3 + 5.

=== Troggles ===
The Troggles are monsters with two legs and a large head, whose goal is to eat Muncher and/or disrupt his progress by rearranging things on the board. Levels 1, 2, and 3, contain only one Troggle on the grid at any given time. A second Troggle appears starting with level 4, and a third appears starting with level 8. After approximately level 18, the game (especially the movement of the Troggles) accelerates to make responsible munching more difficult.

There are several types of &quot;Troggles&quot;. Each type of Troggle moves in a specific pattern. There are five species of Troggle, each of which has an English and a mock-Latin (binomial) name:

* Reggies (&quot;Trogglus normalus&quot;) (magenta on Apple II, red in DOS, purple on Macintosh) - simply move in a line unless redirected by a safety square in its path.
* Bashfuls (&quot;Trogglus timidus&quot;) (green on Apple II, blue in DOS, pink on Macintosh) - moves arbitrarily on the gameboard, unless approached by a Muncher, in which case he moves away from the Muncher. It became purple in later releases in the series.
* Helpers (&quot;Trogglus assistus&quot;) (green on Apple II and DOS, magenta on Macintosh) - this ant-like Troggle eats all answers, leaving nothing behind. It became purple in later releases in the series.
* Workers (&quot;Trogglus laborus&quot;) (purple and white on Apple II and DOS, magenta and white on Macintosh) - this Troggle adds new answers and/or changes existing answers as he moves around.
* Smarties (&quot;Trogglus smarticus&quot;) (green on Apple II and Macintosh, yellow on DOS) - has large teeth and glasses, and is the most difficult Troggle to avoid; always follows the Muncher on the board.

Safety squares occasionally appear to help protect Muncher from the Troggles. These are temporary havens identified by four small white rectangles on the corner of the square. No Troggle may enter a safety square; if one appears on a square a Troggle currently occupies, that Troggle dies (but may be replaced afterwards). Safety squares may disappear as quickly and randomly as they appear; hence, one must take caution not to remain in one for long.

In addition, Troggles are quite cannibalistic; if one Troggle enters a square already occupied by another, or if two of them enter one square at the same time (even if they are of the same species), one Troggle will eat the other, although another Troggle may re-enter the board afterwards.

=== Levels ===
Players can choose from the five modes of play, or choose a &quot;challenge&quot; mode, which randomizes these modes. In the Multiples mode, Muncher must munch all numbers which are multiples of the number given; for example, if the designated number is 3 then Muncher must eat all 6&#x27;s, 9&#x27;s, and 12&#x27;s and avoid numbers such as 7. In Factors the muncher seeks to ingest the factors of a given number, in Primes, he craves prime numbers, and in the Equality and Inequality modes, the muncher devours expressions such as 2+4 which are equivalent or not equivalent (respectively) to the designated number.

Game play begins with four Muncher lives (the one currently in play, plus three others in reserve). After scoring a certain number of points, the player gains an extra life. Players lose a life if they munch an incorrect answer. Additionally, five different types of enemies (or &quot;Troggle&quot;) appear throughout the game. Players lose a life if they make contact with a Troggle.

=== Cutscenes ===
As in the other games in the series, a player is awarded a cutscene (reminiscent of Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner escapades) after every third level; in this game, these are dubbed as &quot;Great Moments in Muncher History&quot;. While these scenes are numbered (Act 1, Act 2, etc.), the order they appear varies from game to game. Once all six have been shown, they begin to repeat themselves (starting with the scene after Level 21). The six scenes are as follows:

* A Muncher is chased by a Reggie across the screen twice, then the Muncher gets in an old-timey automobile, outruns the Troggle and the Troggle falls and gives up.
* Two Munchers reenact the story of William Tell.
* A Muncher races a Bashful up a mountain, plants his flag, and sings a song (Ding Dong! the Witch is Dead).
* A Muncher prank-calls a Smartie and sings the nyah-nyah taunting melody.
* A Muncher beats two Troggles in a beauty contest. Later releases of the game replaced this cut scene with one in which a Muncher stumbles through his house in the dark and then turns on the light, only to discover that he has broken all of his furniture.
* A Muncher carves his image into Mount Rushmore.

=== Easter egg ===
As an Easter egg, between December 1 and 25, the Muncher would wear a Santa Claus hat. This only worked on a computer that had a built-in clock or that was never turned off, as the built-in clock was not common at the time the games were popular.

==Educational goals==
The game was designed for school and home use for grades four to eight with parental controlled options to set the difficulty level. It teaches multiples, factors, prime numbers, equalities, and inequalities. It helped introduce math skills to younger students, while helping older students to reinforce their existing math skills. In addition teachers could have their copy of the game networked to copies in class to monitor and control them. It has proven to be attention catching with the ability to train students&#x27; hand/eye coordination as well as building up self-esteem and instilling confidence.

==Reception==
Reviewer Benj Edwards regarded the game as one of the &quot;Top 10 Educational PC Games of the 80s&quot; in &quot;PC Magazine&quot; and one of the &quot;Best 17 Educational Games of the 70s, 80s and 90s&quot; in &quot;PC World&quot;. The number munching was commonly compared to a &quot;Pac-Man&quot; game. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; praised the game for its cartoony graphics and a viable way to make math fun. It was considered both an award-winner and best-seller from &quot;Parents&#x27; Choice&quot;, &quot;InCider Magazine&quot; and &quot;Media &amp; Methods&quot;.

<doc id="1058094" wikidata="Q6224698" url="?curid=1058094" title="John Cabot Academy">
<text>John Cabot Academy (formerly John Cabot CTC) is one of 15 City Technology Colleges that first opened for students in the 1993/1994 academic year. It has since converted to Academy status on 1 September 2007. It is located in east Greater Bristol, England in the Kingswood area of South Gloucestershire and is named after John Cabot, an explorer who set out from Bristol and reached the Americas in 1497. The academy has 1,078 students, about 220 of whom are in the sixth form.

==History==
The John Cabot City Technology College (CTC) became the John Cabot Academy in 2007. The present Academy is independent of local authority control, but enjoys a close relationship with both South Gloucestershire and Bristol Local Authorities.

The school served as the filming location for the TV show &quot;Skins&quot; from 2007 to 2013, where it was depicted as the fictional Roundview College.

==Information==
The principal is Kate Willis. The academy is part of an Academy Federation led by Sir David Carter, a previous Principal, who was knighted in the 2013 Birthday Honours List. The federation runs lessons throughout the several schools, with sixth formers moving between schools for some of their lessons.

The academy operates the PLTs Curriculum, which was developed at the academy. It focuses on inspiration and teaches students to empower over students to achieve greater feats together
The academy is divided into 6 tutor groups throughout each year (3 in x and 3 in y).

==Term system and school day==
From the start of the academic year 2009/10 the term system has been changed to be the same as other schools in England to make the Diplomas easier to coordinate. This turned out to be unpopular due to demand for public places and therefore became over crowded.

The typical school day begins at 8:40AM and ends at 3:00PM. The time is divided into 6 periods (not including tutor time and break times).

==Student Voice==
The academy has a student voice system which allows the students to give their opinions on issues related to the academy, such as sanctions and rewards, and the construction of new buildings. Two students from each tutor group are chosen each year. The chosen student becomes the representative of their tutor group, collecting opinions from their classmates to relay to the meeting.

<text>New Space () is a social democratic party in Uruguay.

== History ==
The party was founded in 1994 by Senator Rafael Michelini. It was born as a split of the centrist Party for the Government of the People (&quot;Partido por el Gobierno del Pueblo&quot;, PGB), whose leader was the former Vice-President Hugo Batalla, when the party decided to join the traditional liberal Colorado Party for the 1994 Uruguayan general election. &quot;New Space&quot; had originally been the name of an electoral alliance formed after the more centrist elements of the Broad Front had left the centre-left alliance, which they deemed too strongly dominated by the Marxist elements, in 1989 and included notably the PGB and the Christian Democratic Party (PDCU).

While the PDCU returned to the Broad Front in 1994, the New Space party ran separately, as the fourth force behind the two traditional ruling parties and the Broad Front. It obtained five seats in the Chamber of Deputies and one Senator. In 1999, the party was returned four deputies and its Senator. Michelini who ran as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate won 4.4% of the vote. The party positioned itself in the political center and won most of its supporters among the lower-middle and lower classes.

In 2001, the New Space decided to re-join the Broad Front for the 2004 campaign. As a result, there was a new crack in the party&#x27;s board. The Independent Party emerged, led by Deputy Pablo Mieres. The New Space has supported the governments of Presidents Tabaré Vázquez (2005–2010, 2015–2020) and José Mujica (2010–2015). In 2009, the New Space, alongside Uruguay Assembly and Progressive Alliance, founded the Liber Seregni Front as a moderate social democratic sub-group within the Broad Front.

The New Space party has been a member of the Socialist International since shortly after its foundation.

<text>Szekszárd (, formerly also &quot;Szegzárd&quot;; ; or ; ) is a small city in southern Hungary and the capital of Tolna County. By population, Szekszárd is the smallest county capital in Hungary; by area, it is the second-smallest (after Tatabánya).

==Location==
Szekszárd lies at the meeting point of the Transdanubian Hills and the Great Hungarian Plain, at the mouth of Sió into the flood plain of Danube.

== Etymology ==
The Etymological Dictionary of Geographical Names, somewhat differently from the above, derives the name of the locality from the old Hungarian colour name szegszár (sötétsárga, brownish yellow), which could have become a personal name with the diminutive -d and thus could have been a predecessor of the town name.

==History==
Szekszárd was first mentioned in 1015. The Benedictine monastery of the town was founded by King Béla I in 1061.

During the reign of King Matthias, Szekszárd was the estate of Bishop John, who was involved in a conspiracy against the king. Because of this, King Matthias ordered the castle of Szekszárd to be demolished.

In 1485, Szekszárd was already a significant town, holding five market days a year, but during the Turkish ascendancy of Hungary, the town became deserted and the monastery was destroyed.

By the 18th century, Szekszárd was again a significant town, it became a county seat (of Tolna), and got a coat of arms. The town was destroyed by a fire in 1794, but it could not stop the town&#x27;s development. Most of the important buildings—including the town hall, the County Hall and several churches—were built during the 19th century. By this time, Szekszárd already had 14,000 residents.

Mihály Babits, an important Hungarian poet was born in Szekszárd in 1883.

During World War II, Szekszárd was captured by Soviet troops of the 3rd Ukrainian Front on 30 November 1944 as part of the Budapest Offensive.

In 1994, Szekszárd was granted the rank of city with county rights, in accordance with a new law stating that all county seats are cities with county rights. (Previously only cities with a population over 50,000 were granted county rights, and Szekszárd was one of only two county seats that had a smaller population than 50,000; the other was Salgótarján).

==Transportation==
Szekszárd lies on a railway line Rétszilas - Bátaszék and on a junction of main roads No. 6, 56, 63 and 65. Motorways M6 and M9 cross each other near the city. There also are local bus lines for city transportation operated by Volánbusz.

<text>The Liberal Party () was a Uruguayan political party founded in 2002, espousing free market liberalism. The party thinks that the economic heyday of the Uruguay at the end of the 19th century was a consequence of the application of political initiatives founded in the liberal ideas, and that the abandonment of the same ones on the part of the successive governments from the Batlle period has determined the process of social and economic deterioration that the country suffers from 1955.

== History ==
On August 22, 2002, nine Uruguayan citizens founded the Liberal Party. They agreed on a &quot;Program of Principles&quot;, gave the Liberal Party an &quot;Organic Letter&quot;, named the first director and Julio Vera as its first president; one week later they presented to the Electoral Court the &quot;Request of Motto&quot; (see Ley de lemas).

After waiting more than a year, the Liberal Party obtained the necessary authorization from the Electoral Court, for official resolution of the above-mentioned corporation of January 21, 2004, communicated to the interested ones on January 30, 2004. From this moment, the Liberal Party is enabled to use the &quot;Partido Liberal&quot; (Liberal Party) motto in the electoral process that would celebrate the same year in the Eastern Republic of Uruguay.

In accordance with the current Constitution in 2004, the first instance of the electoral process is the internal elections, where every party chooses those who will integrate his Convention, and the candidate who will participate in the presidential election. In the above-mentioned instance, the Liberal Party obtained slightly more than 1.500 votes and Julio Vera was elected as candidate.

The first convention of the Liberal Party was held on August 22, 2004 at Montevideo. In accordance with the established for the constitution and the laws of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, the convention realized the election of authorities for the period 2004–2009 and the election of the &quot;formula companion&quot; (that is, the one who accompanies the candidate to President and who is &quot;elected&quot; as Vice-president in case the party prevails in the election). In this occasion, the election of authorities determined the continuity of Julio Vera as President of the Liberal Party, and Jorge Borlandelli as &quot;formula companion&quot; or Vice-president candidate.

In the national elections of 2004, the Liberal Party obtained 1.548 votes.

<text>Union Township is one of the eleven townships of Warren County, Ohio, United States, located in the central part of the county. It was established January 3, 1815 and named Union as it was formed from parts of Deerfield and Turtlecreek Townships. The population was 6,251 as of the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Located in the central part of the county, it borders the following townships:
*Turtlecreek Township - north
*Salem Township - east
*Hamilton Township - south, across the Little Miami River
*Deerfield Township - southwest

The smallest township in the county, it originally had fifteen full and six fractional sections of land totaling 11,970 acres (48 km). However, a large portion of the township has been annexed into South Lebanon, Lebanon, and Mason. The village of South Lebanon remains within the township, but Mason and Lebanon are not and that land has been lost. The township is prone to flooding from the Little Miami and Turtle Creek.

The entire township is in the Symmes Purchase and was surveyed in accordance with the unusual plan Symmes chose.

Union is the third most popular township name statewide; only Washington (43 townships) and Jackson (37 townships) are more common.

==History==
Union Township was organized in 1815.

==Government==
The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.

==Public services==
Telephone service is provided through South Lebanon, Lebanon, Mason, and Morrow exchanges, while the South Lebanon, Lebanon, Kings Mills, and Morrow post offices serve the township.

Interstate 71 crosses the township from southwest to northeast and State Route 48 from south to north. U.S. Route 42 clips the northwest corner of the township. Formerly, the Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad crossed the township, but all track southeast of US 42 has been abandoned and lifted. The city of Lebanon&#x27;s sewage treatment plant is in Union Township, along the Little Miami River.

===Education===
Most of the township is in the Kings Local School District, which was formerly known as the Deerfield-Union Local School District, while parts are in the Lebanon City School District, the Mason City School District, and the Little Miami Local School District.

<doc id="1058116" wikidata="Q4354941" url="?curid=1058116" title="Working-class culture">
<text>Working-class culture or proletarian culture is a range of cultures created by or popular among working-class people. The cultures can be contrasted with high culture and folk culture, and are often equated with popular culture and low culture (the counterpart of high culture). Working-class culture developed during the Industrial Revolution. Because most of the newly created working class were former peasants, the cultures took on much of the localised folk culture. This was soon altered by the changed conditions of social relationships and the increased mobility of the workforce and later by the marketing of mass-produced cultural artefacts such as prints and ornaments and commercial entertainment such as music hall and cinema.

In academia, working-class socio-economic circumstances are conventionally associated with smoking, alcoholism, domestic abuse, obesity and delinquency.

== Politics of working-class culture ==
===Socialism===
Many socialists with a class struggle viewpoint see working-class culture as a vital element of the proletariat which they champion. One of the first organisations for proletarian culture was &quot;Proletkult&quot;, founded in Russia shortly after the February Revolution, supported by Alexander Bogdanov, who had been co-leader of the Bolsheviks with Vladimir Lenin. The group included both Bolsheviks and their critics, and Bogdanov struggled to retain its independence following the Bolshevik Revolution in October 1917. His erstwhile ally Anatoly Lunacharsky had rejoined the Bolsheviks and was appointed Commissar for Education. 

In &quot;Literature and Revolution&quot;, Trotsky examined aesthetic issues in relation to class and the Russian revolution. Soviet scholar Robert Bird considered his work as the &quot;first systematic treatment of art by a Communist leader&quot; and a catalyst for later, Marxist cultural and critical theories. Trotsky presented a critique of contemporary literary movements such as Futurism and emphasised a need of cultural autonomy for the development of a socialist culture. According to literary critic Terry Eagleton, Trotsky recognised “like Lenin on the need for a socialist culture to absorb the finest products of bourgeois art”. Trotsky himself viewed the proletarian culture as “temporary and transitional” which would provide the foundations for a culture above classes. He also argued that the pre-conditions for artistic creativity were economic well-being and emancipation from material constraints. Political scientist Baruch Knei-Paz characterised his view on the role of the party as transmitters of culture to the masses and raising the standards of education, as well as entry into the cultural sphere, but that the process of artistic creation in terms of language and presentation should be the domain of the practitioner. Knei-Paz also noted key distinctions between Trotsky’s approach on cultural matters and Stalin&#x27;s policy in the 1930s.

Marxist–Leninist states have declared an official working-class culture, most notably socialist realism, whose constant aim is to glorify the worker, in contrast to typical independent working-class cultures. However, Lenin believed that there could be no authentic proletarian culture free from capitalism and that high culture should be brought to the workers. 

The millenarian nature of socialist working-class art is evident in the goals espoused by the leaders of revolutionary movements. The art forms for the masses were meant to shape a new consciousness and form the basis of a new culture and new man.

===Working-class culture and the American Dream===
Many Americans strongly believe the U.S. is a &quot;Land of Opportunity&quot; that offers every child an equal chance at social and economic mobility. The idea of Americans rising from humble origins to riches has been called a &quot;civil religion&quot;, &quot;the bedrock upon which the American story has been anchored&quot;, and part of the American identity (the American Dream) This theme is celebrated in the lives of famous Americans such as Benjamin Franklin and Henry Ford, and in popular culture (from the books of Horatio Alger and Norman Vincent Peale to the song &quot;Movin&#x27; on Up&quot;).

The American Dream Report, a study of the Economic Mobility Project, found that Americans surveyed were more likely than citizens of other countries to agree with statements like:

* &quot;People get rewarded for intelligence and skill&quot;,
* &quot;People get rewarded for their efforts&quot;;

and less likely to agree with statements like:

* &quot;Coming from a wealthy family is &#x27;essential&#x27; or &#x27;very important&#x27; to getting ahead,&quot;
* &quot;Income differences in my country are too large&quot; or
* &quot;It is the responsibility of government to reduce differences in income.&quot;

In the US only 32% of respondents agreed with the statement that forces beyond their personal control determine their success. In contrast, a majority of European respondents agreed with this view in every country but three (Britain, the Czech Republic and Slovakia). The Brookings Institution found Americans surveyed had the highest belief in meritocracy—69% agreed with the statement &quot;people are rewarded for intelligence and skill&quot;—among 27 nations surveyed.

Another report found such beliefs to have gotten stronger over the last few decades.

<doc id="1058120" wikidata="Q7754535" url="?curid=1058120" title="The Nutty Squirrels">
<text>The Nutty Squirrels were a jazz virtual band formed in imitation of Alvin and the Chipmunks. The Nutty Squirrels&#x27; music was characterized by their use of scat singing. They received a Top 40 hit in late-1959 as the song &quot;Uh! Oh!&quot;. They also preceded The Alvin Show in which they appeared on television in 1960 as &quot;The Nutty Squirrels Present&quot;, but the show&#x27;s success was rather decreased.

The group&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;The Nutty Squirrels&quot; and &quot;Bird Watching&quot;, were released in 1959. The Nutty Squirrels&#x27; final album, &quot;The Nutty Squirrels Sing A Hard Day&#x27;s Night and Other Smashes&quot;, marked a stylistic change from their first two albums, featuring covers of the Beatles songs.

==Biography==
After The Chipmunks&#x27; initial success in 1958, plans were almost immediately made to make them into an animated cartoon series. Unfortunately, there were some initial art direction snags (specifically with the character designs) and the show was delayed. This gap resulted in a race between the Chipmunks and an imitative group created by jazz musicians Don Elliott and Granville Burland, which they called the Nutty Squirrels.

Both musical groups featured the defining sped-up voices, but Ross Bagdasarian Sr.&#x27;s Chipmunks favored popular music while the Squirrels favored jazz, particularly of the bebop variety. Ultimately, the Squirrels made it to television first, in the animated series &quot;The Nutty Squirrels Present&quot; (appearing in September 1960), but its popularity was decreased as of the originals.

&quot;Uh! Oh! (Part 1)&quot; peaked at #45 on the Billboard Pop Singles Chart, while &quot;Uh! Oh! (Part 2)&quot; peaked at #14.

In the 2007 live-action/animated movie &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot;, during the credits, Ian Hawke (David Cross) is trying to get three squirrels to sing.

==Personnel==
* Don Elliott: vocals, trumpet, vibraphone, possible other instruments
* Granville Alexander &quot;Sascha&quot; Burland: vocals

Among the New York-based session musicians playing on these albums were Cannonball Adderley, (alto sax), Bobby Jaspar (flute), and Sam Most (clarinet)

==Reception==
In his 2019 autobiography, &quot;Mr. Know-It-All&quot;, John Waters wrote, &quot;I should have told my mother about the Nutty Squirrels. They did jazz and they &quot;weren&#x27;t&quot; junkies. This sped-up vocal group who imitated the Chipmunks actually beat them to television with an animated show called &quot;The Nutty Squirrels Present&quot;, and they looked down on the pop sound of Alvin and his gang. The Nutty Squirrels actually had a big jazz hit with &quot;Uh Oh, Part One and Two,&quot; but if you go back and listen to the rest of their discography, you&#x27;ll be blown away by some of their other riffs. These cats were smoking! If my mom had heard jazz like this at the wrong speed, she might have loved it.&quot;

<text>Kubota Garden is a Japanese garden in the Rainier Beach neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. A public park since 1987, it was started in 1927 by Fujitaro Kubota, a Japanese emigrant. Today, it is maintained as a public park by the Seattle Parks and Recreation and the Kubota Garden Foundation.

==History==
Fujitaro Kubota emigrated from Shikoku, Japan in 1907 and established the Kubota Gardening Company in 1923. Projects of his included the garden at Seattle University and the Japanese garden at Bloedel Reserve in Bainbridge Island. In 1927, he bought of swampland in Rainier Beach with the help of a friend, as he was not able to make the purchase because of his Japanese descent. In 1930, he went on to increase the size of the garden to . Kubota Garden served as cultural center for the Japanese community in Seattle, as well as a home, office and nursery for his business. During World War II, Kubota Garden was abandoned for four years as Kubota and his family were interned at Camp Minidoka in Idaho. During his internment, Kubota supervised the building of a community park, which included a Japanese rock garden. After the war, he and his sons Tak and Tom Kubota rebuilt the business.

The Japanese government awarded Kubota the Fifth Class Order of the Sacred Treasure in 1972 &quot;for his achievements in his adopted country, for introducing and building respect for Japanese Gardening in this area.&quot; Kubota maintained the garden until his death in 1973.

In 1981, the Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board declared the core of the park to be a historical landmark of the City of Seattle. In 1987, the City of Seattle bought the garden from the Kubota family, and it is now maintained by the Department of Parks and Recreation as well as volunteers from the Kubota Garden Foundation.

In addition, surrounding the park has been purchased by the Open Space Program in the City of Seattle in order to protect Mapes Creek, which runs through the park. The Tom Kubota Stroll Garden broke ground in 1999 and was opened in 2000. The garden received a new entrance gate designed by Gerard Tsutakawa in 2004.

A community newspaper noted in 1995 that the garden was being abused after staff left for the day, including graffiti and beer bottles being left behind.

In 2020, the book &quot;Spirited Stone: Lesson&#x27;s From Kubota&#x27;s Garden&quot; was released, entailing the importance of Kubota&#x27;s legacy through the stories of novelists, poets, and garden enthusiasts.

==Kubota Garden Foundation==

The Kubota Garden Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization founded in 1989 to &quot;support, enhance, and perpetuate the Kubota Garden within the spirit and vision of Fujitaro Kubota.&quot; Kubota&#x27;s vision included opening the garden to the public and increasing American understanding and appreciation of Japanese Gardens. The foundation provides additional fundraising, volunteer work, and publications to support the garden.

==Features and programs==
The garden is open to the public every day during daylight hours all year round. School children, senior groups, tourists, and garden clubs make up a large portion of their audience. The fourth Saturday between April and October, the Kubota Garden holds a public tour.

Major features of the Kubota Garden include the Kubota Terrace, the Bamboo Grove, the Necklace of Ponds, the Mountainside, and the Tom Kubota Stroll Garden.
==Flora==
Kubota Garden contains a variety of trees and plants including Kuretake (&quot;Phyllostachys nigra&quot; or Black Bamboo), Japanese Maple (&quot;Acer palmatum&quot;), Blue Atlas Cedar (&quot;Cedrus atlanticus Glauca&quot;), and Norway Spruce (&quot;Picea abies&quot;).

Kuretake: Native to the Hunan Province of China, this plant (also known as Black Bamboo) grows in an upright position to about 20 to 35 feet. The dark green, yellow, and black colors are the main source of attraction, as they are popularly used for decorative wood working.

Japanese Maple: Growing anywhere between 8 and 30 feet tall, the Japanese Maple is known for its radiantly beautiful color changes throughout the seasons—ranging from earthier tones of green and brown to warmer colors of red and orange.

Blue Atlas Cedar: The Blue Atlas Cedar gets its name from the blue pigmentation of its leaves; a needled evergreen tree that grows anywhere between 40 and 60 feet and can withstand extreme weather conditions such as droughts and treacherous winters.

Norway Spruce: The Norway Spruce (the fastest growing plant in the spruce family) grows to be about 40 to 60 feet high. The major attraction towards this tree is the homing of a variety of wildlife—anywhere from deer to a differentiation of bird species.

==Amenities and events==
* The Tom Kubota Stroll Garden allows wheel chair accessibility to the Terrace Overlook. However, main pathways are not as accessible, as they are made with hard-packed gravel.
* Dogs allowed at the garden
* There are picnic tables and benches placed throughout the garden
* There are portable toilets near the entrance of the garden

Individuals can reserve the Terrace Overlook feature for events. Events may include: Wedding ceremonies, musical performances, family reunions, photoshoots, etc. During this time, the garden is still open to the public, but the specific area is closed off for the event. There is a group limitation of 150 guests and alcohol, and amplified sounds are prohibited.

<doc id="1058128" wikidata="Q7398544" url="?curid=1058128" title="Safe seat">
<text>A safe seat is an electoral district which is regarded as fully secure, for either a certain political party, or the incumbent representative personally or a combination of both. With such seats, there is very little chance of a seat changing hands because of the political leanings of the electorate in the constituency concerned or the popularity of the incumbent member. This contrasts with a marginal seat in which a defeat for the seat holder is considered possible. In systems where candidates must first win the party&#x27;s primary election or preselection, the phrase &quot;tantamount to election&quot; is often used to describe winning the dominant party&#x27;s nomination for a safe seat.

==Definition==

There is a spectrum between safe and marginal seats. Supposedly safe seats can still change hands in a landslide election, such as Enfield Southgate being lost by the Conservatives (and then-potential future party leader Michael Portillo) to Labour at the 1997 UK general election, whilst other seats may remain marginal despite large national swings, such as Gedling, which Labour narrowly won in every election for twenty years until the 2019 general election, despite having both major victories and defeats during this time. Gedling would still be seen as a marginal seat, even though it had been held by Labour for a long time. Safe seats are usually seats that have been held by one party for a long time, but the two concepts are not interchangeable.

In countries with parliamentary government, parties often try to ensure that their most talented or influential politicians are selected to contest these seats – in part to ensure that these politicians can stay in parliament, regardless of the specific election result, and that they can concentrate on ministerial roles without needing to spend too much effort on managing electorate-specific issues.

Candidate selection for a party&#x27;s safe seats is usually keenly contested, although many parties restrict or forbid challenges to the nomination of sitting members. The selection process can see the incumbent party, untroubled by the need to have a representative that must appeal to a broader electorate, take the opportunity to choose a candidate from the more ideological reaches of the membership. Opposing parties will often be compelled to nominate much less well-known individuals (such as backroom workers or youth activists in the party), who will sometimes do little more than serve as paper candidates who do little or no campaigning, or will use the contest to gain experience so that they become more likely to be selected for a more winnable seat. In some cases (especially in the United States), these seats may go uncontested by other major parties.

Safe seats can become marginal seats (and vice versa) gradually as voter allegiances shift over time. This shift can happen more rapidly for a variety of reasons. The retirement or death of a popular sitting member may make a seat more competitive, as the accrued personal vote of a long-serving parliamentarian will sometimes have resisted countervailing demographic trends. An independent or third-party candidate with an ideology close to that of the incumbent party may also be able to make a more credible challenge than more established parties, but these factors can combine: a retiring third-party member may turn a safe seat for that party into a marginal seat. For instance, in Berwick-upon-Tweed, with the retirement of the popular incumbent Alan Beith, the seat was no longer safe for the Liberal Democrats.

Traditionally safe seats can also be more vulnerable in by-elections, especially for governing parties. Safe seats may also become marginal if the sitting member is involved in scandal: in 1997, Tatton was gained from the Conservatives by an anti-sleaze independent candidate, despite the majority previously being that of a very safe seat for the Conservatives. The incumbent, Neil Hamilton, had been mired in controversy, and was defeated by the veteran BBC journalist Martin Bell, who was aided by the decision of the main opposition parties (Labour and the Liberal Democrats) not to field candidates. Without such pacts, a split vote is more likely under a first past the post electoral system, as in the UK.

Opposition supporters in safe seats have restricted means to affect election outcomes, and thus the incumbent parties can, in theory, decide to ignore those supporters&#x27; concerns, as they have no direct effect on the election result. Even those voters who are moderate supporters of the incumbent party may be disenfranchised by having a representative whose views may be more extreme than their own. Political objectors in such areas may experience marginalisation from wider democratic processes and political apathy. This is often regarded as undemocratic, and is a major argument in favour of various multi-member proportional representation election methods. Safe seats may receive far less political funding than marginal seats, as the parties will attempt to &quot;buy&quot; marginal seats with funding (a process known in North America and Australia as &quot;pork barrelling&quot;), while ignoring safe seats which will reliably fall to the same party every time; this is especially true in cases where the safe seat is held by the minority party.

In countries that do not apply the first past the post system, many of which equally operate a geographic division-based system, selected or party sub-nominated candidates can be allocated a safer or more tenuous list position. If a party is strong enough nationwide to gather representations in all subdivisions, the top candidate(s) on each list tend to be very safely elected to parliament. This is seen in the extremely proportional election systems of the Nordic countries, for example. Safe seats and candidates can be avoided altogether by a purposefully marginal-preference allocation of all divisions, ensuring all divisions are near-identically demographically diverse which may be achieved by pairing non-adjoining areas.

==Australia==
The Australian Electoral Commission defines seat margins as follows:

In his election analysis, psephologist Antony Green puts the cutoff between &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;very safe&quot; at 12%.

In Australia&#x27;s federal system, most rural seats are safe seats for either the National Party or Liberal Party. Conversely, inner-city and poorer suburban seats are typically safe Australian Labor Party seats, and a few of the most affluent inner-middle urban seats are held by the Liberal Party. Marginals are generally concentrated in the middle-class outer-suburban areas of Australia&#x27;s larger state capitals, which therefore decide most Australian federal elections.

At the 2007 federal election, the governing Australian Labor Party&#x27;s safest seat was the seat of Division of Batman in Melbourne&#x27;s inner-northern suburbs, with a two-party-preferred margin of 26.0%. The safest seat for the opposition Liberal Party was the rural Victorian electorate of Murray, with a margin of 18.3%. The Liberal Party&#x27;s junior coalition partner, the National Party&#x27;s safest seat was the division of Mallee, also located in rural Victoria, with a margin of 21.3%.

==Canada==
Examples include:

*Beauséjour, a riding in southeastern New Brunswick, which is considered a safe seat for the Liberal Party. In 1990, when Jean Chrétien needed an open seat to become Leader of the Opposition, he chose Beauséjour in a by-election and won.
*Bow River, located in southern Alberta, is considered a safe seat for the Conservatives. In the 2015 federal election, the Conservative candidate won by 77% of the vote.
*Central Nova, located in east-central Nova Scotia, which has previously been called a safe seat for the Conservative Party and its predecessor, the Progressive Conservative Party, having been held by either Elmer MacKay or his son Peter for all but five of forty years until 2015. The only time the riding was not in Conservative control was from 1993 to 1997, when the Progressive Conservatives were reduced to just two seats nationwide and a socially conservative candidate ran for the Liberals. In 1983, when Brian Mulroney became Progressive Conservative leader and needed a seat in the House of Commons, he chose to run in Central Nova. Liberal MP Sean Fraser won the seat in 2015, and was re-elected in 2019 and 2021.
*Crowfoot, a Conservative stronghold located in southern Alberta, which has been called the safest seat in the entire country. In the 2008 election, Conservative candidate Kevin Sorenson won 82.04% of the vote, and in a ranking measuring the electoral competitiveness of ridings by &quot;National Post&quot; reporter Dan Arnold, the district came in last in all of Canada, having an average margin of victory of 74%.
*Battle River—Crowfoot, the successor to Crowfoot, is a solid Conservative stronghold and is considered one of the most solid seats in Canada. In the 2015 federal election, the Conservative candidate won by 80.91% of the vote.
*Mount Royal, a Liberal stronghold in Montreal, Quebec, held by a succession of Liberal MPs since 1940. Liberal Irwin Cotler won over 75% of the vote in the 2004 federal election.
*Ottawa—Vanier, a Liberal stronghold in the eastern part of Ottawa. It has elected a Liberal Member of Parliament each federal election since its creation in 1935, often in landslide victories. In fact, the previous electoral district which comprises most of the constituency, Russell, had been solidly Liberal since 1887.
*Portage—Lisgar, one of many rural, southern safe seats in the Prairies for the Conservative Party of Canada.
*Saint-Laurent—Cartierville, yet another Liberal safe seat in Montreal. It has been held by the Liberals since its creation. In the 2004 federal election, incumbent Stéphane Dion won with over 65% of the vote, and over 21,000 votes more than his closest rival.
*Wild Rose, a Conservative stronghold, also in southern Alberta. The incumbent, Blake Richards, won 72.9% of the vote in the 2008 election in what ranked as the largest majority win in its history. His predecessor, Myron Thompson, won 72% compared to 10% for his closest rival in the 2006 federal election.
*York Centre, a safe seat for the Liberals in Toronto. Since the district&#x27;s re-establishment in 1952, it has been out of Liberal hands only twice.
*The City of Toronto, which holds 25 ridings is often considered a Liberal stronghold, having shut out the Conservative Party from the city in the six elections between 1993 and 2008, and having lost at most two ridings in the 2004, 2006 and 2008 elections to the New Democratic Party. The 2011 Canadian Federal Election ended the Liberal fortress of Toronto when both Conservatives and New Democrats elected many new MPs in Toronto. The former Liberal strength was restored in 2015 as they won all 25 Toronto ridings. The city is not as safe at the provincial level; for instance, the Liberal Party of Ontario won only 3 of Toronto&#x27;s 41 ridings in the 2018 provincial election.
*Fundy Royal, a riding in Southern New Brunswick, is usually a safe seat for Conservatives. It has only been held by two Liberal MPs since its founding in 1914, its first having held one term from 1993 to 1997 and the latest having been elected in 2015.
*Southern Calgary, particularly Calgary Shepard, Calgary Heritage and Calgary Midnapore, is considered to be a solid Conservative stronghold. In the 3 April 2017 by-elections, the Conservative candidate for Midnapore won by 77% of the vote and the Conservative candidate for Heritage won by 71% of the vote. In the 2015 federal election, the Conservative candidate for Shepard won by 65% of the vote.
*Sturgeon River—Parkland, located in Alberta near Edmonton, is considered a Conservative stronghold. In the 23 October 2017 by-election, the Conservative candidate won by 77% of the vote.
*Battlefords—Lloydminster, located in Eastern Saskatchewan, is considered a Conservative stronghold, despite its low population. In the 11 December 2017 by-election, the Conservative candidate won by 69% of the vote.

==Fiji==
In Fiji, prior to the December 2006 military coup, elections were held under the 1997 Constitution, which allotted 46 of the House of Representatives&#x27; 71 seats on an ethnic basis. 23 were reserved for the indigenous majority, 19 for Indo-Fijians, 1 for Rotumans, and 3 for members of all other ethnic minorities. There was a strong tendency toward voting on ethnic lines. Thus, in the 1999 general election, although the indigenous seats were split between several parties, all 19 Indo-Fijian seats were won by the Fiji Labour Party – which won none of the indigenous seats. In the 2001 general election, the conservative indigenous nationalist Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua party won 18 of the indigenous seats, with the other 5 going to the ultra-nationalist Conservative Alliance – which later merged into the SDL. All 19 &quot;Indian&quot; seats were retained by the Labour Party. In the 2006 general election, all Indo-Fijian seats remained safely Labour, while the SDL won all 23 indigenous seats. Among other minorities, only the communal seat of West Central was a safe seat for the ethnic United Peoples Party.

The new Constitution adopted in 2013 abolished constituency representation altogether, in favour of party list seat allocation based on nationwide results. The 2014 general election was held on that basis, thus putting an end to all safe seats. The Labour Party suffered a near wipe-out.

== Hong Kong ==

There is no formal definition in Hong Kong, yet there are some functional constituency seats which are regarded as fully secured by a political party or a political camp.

Fully secured by the pan-democracy camp:
*Education, formerly called Teaching in the colonial period, has been a safe seat of HKPTU since 1985 until now. Except the incumbent Ip Kin-yuen, the LEGCO member elected in this constituency are members of the Democratic Party Hong Kong.
*Legal has been a safe seat of Pro-democracy camp since 1985, and a safe seat for Civic Party since 2008. Ip Sik On, who was elected by this constituency in 1991, is the only one who is not from the pro-democracy camp.

Fully secured by the pro-Beijing camp:
*Agriculture and Fisheries, which has been held by the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong since its creation in 1998, with the DAB candidate being unopposed from 2000 to 2008.

== Malaysia ==
In Malaysia, the percentage of votes secured by a winning candidate defines the seat margin. In this case:

* A seat with winning percentage under 55.9% by a candidate identified as &#x27;Margin&#x27; seat.
* A seat with winning percentage between 56% and 59.9% by a candidate identified as &#x27;Fairly safe&#x27; seat.
* A seat with winning percentage more than 60% by a candidate identified as &#x27;Safe&#x27; seat.

The northern, east coast, and rural constituencies have been safe seats for the Pan Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) and Perikatan Nasional (PN). Especially in Kelantan, PAS has been in government since 1990 (7 consecutive terms).

Pakatan Harapan, the senior coalition in the current government has been a dominant coalition in highly industrialized states, namely Penang, Selangor and Kuala Lumpur. Even prior to the 2008 elections which ended Barisan Nasional dominant over the country, PH and its predecessors performed well in these states despite never having a chance to rule over the states before. For Barisan Nasional, another major partner in the government, the southern states and Sabah are the safe seats for the coalition. During its dominant period, it also controlled Sarawak and west coast states.

Sabah and Sarawak are safe states for their local parties, with Gabungan Rakyat Sabah and Gabungan Parti Sarawak governing the states with supermajority. For Sabah, despite being described as a swing state in the past, it has been consistently ruled by parties that once a part in BN. Prior to the 2018 elections, these states were described as &#x27;fixed deposits&#x27; for BN as they won almost all seats there with a landslide.

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, many rural electorates, and those based in wealthy suburban areas, notably the North Shore and eastern suburbs of Auckland, are considered safe seats for the National Party. An example of a safe National seat is East Coast Bays, currently held by Erica Stanford, who gained 71.52% of votes in the 2023 election, with only 19% of votes going to her Labour rival. By contrast, inner-city and poorer suburban electorates such as those in South Auckland are typically safe Labour seats. For example, in 2023, the seat of Mangere was held by Labour list MP Lemauga Lydia Sosene with just under 60% of the vote, while her National rival won just under 20% of the vote even despite the nationwide Labour losses of that year.

Historically, some seats thought to be safe have witnessed surprise upsets. Perhaps the most dramatic recent case was the 1996 election, in which the Maori seats, safe Labour seats for the previous 60 years, were all won by New Zealand First. Meanwhile, in the 2023 election, Labour lost many seats that they had held for decades prior such as Mount Roskill, Rongotai and Wellington Central.

The adoption of proportional representation by New Zealand, beginning in 1996, has decreased the importance of winning votes in geographical electorates. It remains to be seen what long-term effect proportional representation will have on the safety of individual electorate seats.

== Philippines ==

While party-switching in the Philippines is rampant, certain congressional districts have been held by political families for generations. These are:

* Camarines Sur–4th: A Fuentebella has served in Congress since 1925. The Fuentebellas have held this district since its creation in 2010, held the 3rd district from 1992 to 2010, and the 2nd district from 1925 to 1972, except from 1931 to 1935, and from 1946 to 1953. A Fuentebella represented Bicol from 1978 to 1984.
* Cebu–5th: A Durano had held this seat until 2019 when they were defeated. Prior to redistricting, the Duranos held Cebu–1st since 1949. The Duranos have also held the mayorship of Danao, the largest city in the district, for generations.
* Isabela–1st: An Albano has held this seat since 1987. Prior to redistricting, an Albano has represented Isabela&#x27;s at-large district or the Cagayan Valley from 1957 to 1986, except from 1965 to 1969.
* La Union–1st: An Ortega has held this seat since 1945 except for two instances, and continually since 1969.
* Tarlac–1st: A Cojuangco has held this seat from 1907 to 1909, from 1934 to 1946, and continually since 1961.

Under the usual definition, Capiz–1st has been held by the Liberal Party since 1946, except from 1953 to 1957; as the Liberals have not nominated someone in this district in the 2025 election, their domination of this district will end. Bohol&#x27;s 3rd district has been held by the Nacionalista Party from 1912 to 1972.

== South Korea ==
From the 1960s, parliamentary constituencies in Gyeongsang region, especially Northern Gyeongbuk and Western Gyeongnam, are considered as safe seats for People Power Party.

City centres in Southeastern Gyeongnam, Southern Gyeogbuk and parliamentary constituencies in rural Gangwon, Chungbuk, Chungnam and Gyeonggi and affluent villages in such as Gangnam-gu, Seocho-gu, Songpa-gu and Yongsan-gu of Seoul, Haeundae-gu, Nam-gu, Dongnae-gu and Suyeong-gu of Busan are also considered as safe seats for People Power Party.

Parliamentary constituencies in industrial areas and built-up residential areas in Gyeonggi, Southeastern Gyeongnam, Cheongju – Daejeon – Sejong City and Jeolla regions such as Jeonbuk and Jeonnam are considered as safe seats for the Democratic Party.

== United Kingdom ==
On 6 April 2010, the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) estimated that going into the 2010 general election, of the 650 constituencies, 382 (59%) were safe seats. Some of these seats have since been lost by the parties that held them at the time, notably most of the Liberal Democrat seats and some Labour seats, meaning they can no longer be considered &quot;safe&quot;.

Examples of safe seats for the Labour Party are in major urban areas and the industrial centres, such as the North West (Liverpool, Manchester); the North East (Newcastle, Sunderland); South and West Yorkshire, the Valleys of South Wales; the West Midlands county and parts of Inner London (e.g. Hackney and Newham).

Many areas of the Central Belt of Scotland, such as Glasgow and Edinburgh, were seen as safe Labour seats until the 2015 election, when the Scottish National Party took all but one Labour seat in Scotland (Edinburgh South).

Safe seats for the Conservative Party tend to be in rural areas: the Home Counties (e.g. Surrey, Buckinghamshire), the shires (e.g. North Yorkshire and Cheshire) and affluent areas of London (e.g. Chelsea and Fulham).

The safest seat in the 2017 general election was Liverpool Walton, where Labour received 86% of the vote, giving them a 77% majority over the second-placed Conservatives (at 9%). Christchurch is a safe Conservative seat; in 2017 the party gathered 69.6% of the vote there, giving it a near-50% majority over Labour.

At the 2015 general election, seven out of eight of the Liberal Democrats&#x27; remaining seats were marginal, with their soon-to-be leader Tim Farron&#x27;s seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale being the only one considered safe. Orkney and Shetland has been held by the Liberal Democrats and their predecessor party, the Liberal Party, continuously since the 1950 general election, but was almost lost to the Scottish National Party in the latter&#x27;s national landslide. The seat of Sheffield Hallam was notable in the run up to the 2015 general election, when opinion polls were forecasting a Labour gain despite the incumbent MP, Nick Clegg, being the party leader and Deputy Prime Minister. Clegg held the seat, albeit with a much reduced majority of just 2,353 (4.2%). In 2017, several Lib Dem MPs either regained their seat, such as Vince Cable and Ed Davey, or won new ones. Despite the net gain in seats, several were still lost, such as Clegg&#x27;s, whilst Farron&#x27;s majority was reduced to less than 1,000.

The ERS identifies what it calls &quot;super safe seats&quot;, which have been held continuously by one party since the 19th century. In so doing, it equates seats with their rough equivalents under previous boundaries. For example, following the 2010 general election, it identifies the national representative of the area forming Haltemprice and Howden (drawn as a constituency in 1997) as having been a Conservative since the 1837 general election. Similarly, it considers that Wokingham (and a few others) have been held by the Conservative Party since 1885, Devon East, Fylde and Arundel and South Downs since 1868, Hampshire North East since 1857, and Rutland and Melton, Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, and East Worthing and Shoreham all since 1841. (For historical reasons, the Conservative Party being older than the other current main parties, it holds all the oldest safe seats.)

Even the safest of seats can be – and sometimes are – upset. Whilst it is rare for the opposition to take such seats, outside candidates may be able to. Examples include the election of Peter Law and George Galloway in very safe Labour seats in 2005, Jim Murphy in the Eastwood constituency in Scotland in 1997, Martin Bell in the safe Conservative seat of Tatton in 1997, and most recently, Helen Morgan in the Conservatives&#x27; historically safest seat, North Shropshire, in a by-election in 2021.

The loss of safe seats can become historic moments: the defeat of Michael Portillo in his &quot;safe&quot; Conservative seat in 1997 created the &quot;Portillo moment&quot;. That expression has since been used to describe huge voting swings that generally usher in a new government, as occurred in 1997. Similarly, in 2015, the Labour Party lost many formerly safe seats in Scotland, including Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, which had previously been held by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and Paisley and Renfrewshire South, the seat of shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander. In both cases, swings of over 25% to the SNP were recorded. In the 2019 general election, Labour lost many formerly safe seats that were part of its &#x27;Red Wall&#x27; in northern England. These defeats represented about 20% of the party&#x27;s overall 2017 vote in such seats.

==United States==

The Cook Partisan Voting Index rates congressional districts on how strongly they lean toward either major party. As of the 2022 redistricting, California&#x27;s 12th district is the most Democratic at D+40, while Alabama&#x27;s 4th district is the most Republican at R+33.

Other examples of a safe seat for the Democrats is California&#x27;s 11th congressional district, which currently covers most of the city of San Francisco. This district and its predecessors have been in Democratic hands without interruption since 1949. Its current representative, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was most recently reelected with 77.6 percent of the vote.

Safe Republican seats include Tennessee&#x27;s 1st congressional district and Tennessee&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, which are located in the eastern part of the state. Both districts have been held by Republicans or their predecessors (except for two terms in the 1st) since 1859. These districts elected some of the few truly senior Southern Republican Congressmen before the 1950s.

<doc id="1058129" wikidata="Q3035796" url="?curid=1058129" title="Don Gorske">
<text>Don Gorske (born ) is an American world record holder known as the &quot;ultimate Big Mac fan,&quot; having eaten over 34,128 such hamburgers from the U.S. fast food chain McDonald&#x27;s in his lifetime (as of March 2024), earning him a place in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;. A resident of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, Gorske claims the Big Mac constitutes 90–95% of his total solid food intake. He is featured in the documentaries &quot;Super Size Me&quot; (2004) and &quot;Don Gorske: Mac Daddy&quot; (2005), and is the author of &quot;22,477 Big Macs&quot; (2008).

==Diet==
Gorske claims that after getting his first car, the first place he went to was the McDonald&#x27;s on Military Road in his hometown of Fond du Lac on May 17, 1972. He purchased and ate three Big Macs at lunchtime. He returned two more times to consume nine Big Macs the same day he discovered the burger. He further claims to have eaten 265 Big Macs the following month, an average of 8.5 Big Macs daily. If true, this would equal over 4,600 calories and 247 grams of fat daily, for 143,100 calories and of fat in one month. He also claims to drink almost nothing but Coca-Cola and, according to &quot;Super Size Me&quot;, he rarely eats the fries. At first, Don kept all the boxes of Big Macs he ate in the back of his car. In addition, he has a statue of Ronald McDonald in his yard. Gorske had a single Burger King Whopper sandwich in 1984 and never ate one again. Gorske tried the Whopper after his friend bet him $5 to do so, later spending the winnings on Big Macs.

In 2003, Gorske ate 741 Big Macs, an average of 2.03 Big Macs daily. Gorske is , , and claims a cholesterol level of 140. Daily consumption of two Big Macs amounts to 1,080 calories, according to McDonald&#x27;s published nutritional information, compared to the USDA recommendation of 2,200 calories per day. Gorske consumes mainly calorie-rich food, but he maintains a stable weight by consuming fewer calories daily than the average American. He says his taste buds have always fluctuated in sensitivity, so he often eats a Big Mac without being able to taste it.

Gorske commented in 2008 that his obsessive–compulsive disorder is what fuels his love of Big Macs, noting he also records when and where he eats his Big Macs in a notebook he always carries and that he has kept every burger receipt in a box full.

On May 17, 2011, Gorske ate his 25,000th Big Mac at his favorite McDonald&#x27;s restaurant in Fond du Lac. On his birthdays, he puts candles in a Big Mac like a cake, and when Christmas time comes around, he treats himself to more Big Macs while his family has more traditional Christmas food. He claims that since he ate his first Big Mac, there have only been eight days on which he did not eat a single Big Mac. One of these days was when his mother died, and he did not eat a Big Mac to respect her request. Other days included a &quot;snow day&quot; when McDonald&#x27;s was unable to open due to snow, a Thanksgiving, days he was traveling and could not find a McDonald&#x27;s, and various days Gorske had to stay at work past midnight. Gorske has since started keeping an &quot;emergency stash&quot; of Big Macs in his freezer for emergencies and snow days.

Gorske ate his 30,000th Big Mac on May 4, 2018. On May 17, 2022, Gorske celebrated 50 years of eating Big Macs nearly every day since May 1972.

By March 2024, Gorske had surpassed eating 34,000 Big Macs.

Gorske claims to skip breakfast, and the only other food he eats is a small evening snack such as ice cream, a fruit bar, or potato chips. Gorske also does not order any side dishes with his Big Macs and takes a six mile walk daily. His favorite food other than Big Macs used to be lobster, but in 2024, Gorske, said the last time he ate it was &quot;over 28 years ago.&quot;

== Personal life and health==
Gorske was born in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Gorske met his wife, Mary, in September 1973, and he proposed to her in the parking lot of a McDonald&#x27;s three years later. Gorske ate a Big Mac before the start of their wedding ceremony. The couple had a son, Gideon.

Gorske was employed as a correctional officer at Waupun Correctional Institution for 25 years, retiring in May 2011. Just before retirement, at his first doctor visit since 1985, his cholesterol level was 156 mg/dl, below the average of 208 mg/dl.

==Appearances==
He appeared in the documentary &quot;Super Size Me&quot;. In the DVD extras for the film, it is revealed he works as a correctional officer. He also makes a cameo appearance in cartoon form in the film.

In 2006, Gorske appeared as a contestant on the game show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;. Celebrity panelist Billy Bean guessed the Big Mac as Gorske&#x27;s food of choice.

On May 25, 2009, Gorske was featured on &quot;The Rachael Ray Show&quot;.

To celebrate eating his 25,000th Big Mac, he appeared on &quot;The Kyle &amp; Jackie O Show&quot; on May 20, 2011, and &quot;Lopez Tonight&quot; on May 23, 2011.

The Netflix series &quot;History 101&quot; featured Gorske to start its 2020 episode examining fast food.

<doc id="1058131" wikidata="Q1049214" url="?curid=1058131" title="How Could Hell Be Any Worse?">
<text>How Could Hell Be Any Worse? is the debut studio album by American punk rock band Bad Religion, released on January 19, 1982, by Epitaph Records. Released almost a year after their self-titled EP, it was financed from the sales of the self titled EP and partly by a $1,000 loan by guitarist Brett Gurewitz&#x27;s father. Its success surprised the band when it sold 10,000 copies in under a year.

&quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; was recorded over two time periods at Track Record Studios in North Hollywood, California, during October–November 1980 and again in January 1981. After the original recording sessions, drummer Jay Ziskrout left Bad Religion and was replaced by his friend and the band&#x27;s roadie Pete Finestone, who was brought in to complete the rest of the album. Though not yet credited as a member of the band, future guitarist Greg Hetson, who was in Circle Jerks during this time, provided a guitar solo on &quot;Part III&quot;. &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; was also Bad Religion&#x27;s last album featuring Jay Bentley on bass for six years, until 1988&#x27;s &quot;Suffer&quot;.

The front cover photograph was taken by Edward Colver near the Hollywood Bowl, while the back cover featured one of Gustave Dore&#x27;s illustrations of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;.

==Background and production==
Bad Religion formed in 1980; their initial line-up consisted of high school students Greg Graffin on vocals, guitarist Brett Gurewitz of Quarks and drummer Jay Ziskrout. They wrote three songs, before Jay Bentley was drafted in on bass. The quartet recorded a demo tape that ended up getting played on local radio station KROQ-FM. A few weeks later, the band made their live debut while supporting Social Distortion. Bad Religion recorded a self-titled EP in late 1981, which was released through their own label Epitaph Records. They pressed 2,000 copies of it, recouping enough to fund the sessions for their debut studio album.

The band recorded most of the album at Track Record Studios in North Hollywood, California over two nights, from October 31 to November 1, 1980; seven songs were recorded on the first night and mixed on the following day. Throughout November of that year, Bad Religion continued to write new material, and Ziskrout soon left the band, replaced by his friend and roadie Pete Finestone. Graffin said regarding Ziskrout&#x27;s departure: &quot;It was for some really stupid reason. Like &#x27;you guys don&#x27;t listen to me enough, fuck you, I quit.&#x27; He walked out of the rehearsal studio, and left his drums and everything. We&#x27;re halfway finished with &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse&quot;, and Bad Religion was without a drummer&quot;. After &quot;some quick practices&quot; at Graffin&#x27;s mother&#x27;s garage, also referred to as The Hellhole, Bad Religion returned to recording &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; again in January 1981 and finished the album over the weekend. Author Dave Thompson, in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; (2000), described the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;clashing standard punky stop/start songs with a barely disguised debt to &#x27;70s hard rock.&quot;

==Reception==

Critical reception to &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; has been positive. Johnny Loftus of AllMusic awarded the album 3 out of 5 stars and stated that &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; is &quot;like cupping your ear against the garage door of their practice space. Greg Graffin&#x27;s vocal style isn&#x27;t fully formed here, nor is his lyrical agenda, but the building blocks are significant and affecting, bigger than piles of collapsed cathedrals&quot;. Thompson found the album to be partially more melodic than their local hardcore punk contemporaries &quot;but just as fast and furious&quot;.

Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s Zack de la Rocha spoke about Bad Religion to the &quot;OC Register&quot; during the band&#x27;s 30-year anniversary in 2010. Speaking about &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot;, he said: &quot;I remember hearing BR&#x27;s How Could Hell Be Any Worse? for the first time in 1985, I was fifteen. The first thing I remember is pulling the insert from the sleeve of the record and seeing those drawings from Dante&#x27;s Inferno, and that red wash over the blurry shot of Los Angeles, and I admit I was scared. A little terrified even. I had no idea what to expect. When the needle hit the record I have to say it was a defining moment for me. The music was darker than most punk records I had heard. It was almost gothic, and there was a genuine sadness to the melodies. Listening to the words I remember being overwhelmed. It wasn&#x27;t some revelation that god didn&#x27;t exist ... it was more like an injection of the sad truth. That our condition is the product of the mess of our own making ... and at fifteen that was as scary as the inferno drawings. I wasn&#x27;t reading Sartre or Nietzsche, and I&#x27;m convinced now that if I was it wouldn&#x27;t have had the same effect. Throughout the record there was very little relief from the sad truths except one: &#x27;there are two things you can do ... one is to turn and fight ... the other&#x27;s to go headlong into the night.&#x27; Truly one of the greatest L.A. bands&quot;. De la Rocha also said that the song &quot;Fuck Armageddon...This Is Hell&quot; changed his life.

==Track listing==


==Reissues==
&quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; has been reissued many times. It was first reissued in 1988 with a different catalogue number and Epitaph&#x27;s then-current address. It was released on CD as part of the 1991 compilation &quot;80–85&quot;, containing all of the band&#x27;s material from 1981 to 1985 (except &quot;Into the Unknown&quot;) in its entirety.

A CD remaster for &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; was released in 2004, along with &quot;Suffer&quot;, &quot;No Control&quot;, &quot;Against the Grain&quot;, &quot;Generator&quot; and a DVD reissue of their long-out of print 1992 live video &quot;Along the Way&quot;. The remastered version of &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; contained the same track listing as &quot;80–85&quot;.

<text>Charles Swann Roberts (February 3, 1930 – August 20, 2010, Baltimore, Maryland) was a wargame designer, railroad historian, and businessman. He is renowned as &quot;The Father of Board Wargaming&quot;, having created the first commercially successful modern wargame in 1952 (&quot;Tactics&quot;), the first wargaming company in 1954 (Avalon Hill), and designed the first board wargame based upon an actual historical battle (&quot;Gettysburg&quot;). He is also the author of a series of books on railroad history, published by the small publishing firm, &quot;Barnard, Roberts, and Company, Inc.&quot;

==As a wargame designer==
In 1952, Charles S. Roberts began working on the first mass market board wargame, &quot;Tactics&quot;, from his house in the Avalon neighborhood of Catonsville, Maryland. It was a revolutionary design in many ways that Roberts recalled confounded new players more accustomed to rules like chess and checkers. In 1954, he began selling it via mail-order as The Avalon Game Company; and Roberts formed gaming company Avalon Hill in 1958 to publish the next incarnation, &quot;Tactics II&quot; (1958). &quot;Tactics II&quot; improved on the basic game design of his earlier effort, and formed the genesis for the concept of the combat results table. In 1958 he published &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, considered to be the first board wargame based upon an actual historical battle, with subsequent versions in 1961 and 1964.

Hard hit by a recession, Roberts turned over Avalon Hill to one of his creditors, Eric Dott of Monarch Services, in December 1963. Tom Shaw, a longtime friend of Roberts and the last holdover from the original company, ran the company during Avalon Hill&#x27;s successful 1963-1982 period. After six years in Roberts home, the company moved to a dedicated building in the Parkville neighborhood of Baltimore.

Starting in 1988, Roberts&#x27;s name was given to the Charles S. Roberts Awards, given for excellence in the historical wargaming hobby. He was a charter member of the Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame.

In 1999 &quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine named Charles S. Roberts as one of &quot;The Millennium&#x27;s Most Influential Persons&quot; &quot;at least in the realm of adventure gaming.&quot;

==As a railroad historian==
Following the sale of his wargame company, Avalon Hill, Charles Roberts held various positions in the publishing industry. In 1973, he founded a small press, Barnard, Roberts, and Company, which he has described as &quot;publishing to the Catholic market&quot;, even though Roberts himself was not a Catholic. Over time, the company&#x27;s emphasis shifted away from religious publications and toward railroad history.

Roberts took pride in coming from a long line of railroaders. One of his great great uncles was Thomas Swann, president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from 1848 to 1853. Roberts&#x27;s father and grandfather (also named Charles Swann Roberts) had long careers with the Baltimore and Ohio. In one of his books, Roberts reminisced about childhood trips with his father to observe the operations of the Pennsylvania Railroad, of which Roberts had always been an enthusiast.

The firm of Barnard, Roberts, and Company published numerous books about railroad history, many written by Charles Roberts himself. Earlier volumes focused on the Baltimore and Ohio, and later books documented the Pennsylvania Railroad. The first in this series was &quot;Triumph I: Altoona to Pitcairn: 1846-1996&quot;, and the last was &quot;Triumph IX: Salt Sea to Bays, Valleys, Dells, and Firestorms: 1927-2007&quot;. In &quot;Triumph IX&quot;, Roberts includes reminiscences about his life and movingly pays tribute to his late first wife, Patricia.

<doc id="1058134" wikidata="Q438252" url="?curid=1058134" title="Old Zurich War">
<text>The Old Zurich War (; 1440–1446) was a conflict between the canton of Zurich and the other seven cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy over the succession to the Count of Toggenburg.

In 1436, Count Friedrich VII of Toggenburg died, leaving neither heir nor will. The canton of Zurich, led by burgomaster Rudolf Stüssi, claimed the Toggenburg lands; the cantons of Schwyz and Glarus made counter-claims, backed by the other cantons. In 1438, Zurich occupied the disputed area and cut off grain supplies to Schwyz and Glarus. In 1440, the other cantons expelled Zurich from the confederation and declared war. Zurich retaliated by making an alliance with Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor of the house of Habsburg.

The forces of Zurich were defeated in the Battle of St. Jakob an der Sihl on 22 July 1443 and Zurich was besieged. Frederick appealed to Charles VII of France to attack the confederates and the latter sent a force of about 30,000 Armagnac mercenaries under the command of the Dauphin via Basel to relieve the city. In the Battle of St. Jakob an der Birs near Basel on 26 August 1444, a blocking force of roughly 1,600 Swiss confederates was defeated, but inflicted such heavy losses on the French (2,000 killed) that the Dauphin decided to retreat. The confederacy and the Dauphin concluded a peace in October 1444, and his mercenary army withdrew from the war altogether.

In May 1444, the confederacy laid siege to Greifensee, and captured the town after four weeks, on May 27, beheading all but two of the 64 defenders the next day, including their leader, Wildhans von Breitenlandenberg, the so-called Murder of Greifensee. Even in this time of war, such a mass execution was widely considered a cruel and unjust deed.

By 1446, both sides were exhausted, and a preliminary peace was concluded. The confederation had not managed to conquer any of the cities of Zurich except Greifensee; Rapperswil and Zurich itself withstood the attacks. In 1450, the parties made a definitive peace and Zurich was admitted into the confederation again, but had to dissolve its alliance with the Habsburgs.

The significance of the war is that it showed that the confederation had grown into a political alliance so close that it no longer tolerated separatist tendencies of a single member.

<doc id="1058138" wikidata="Q7997862" url="?curid=1058138" title="Salem Township, Warren County, Ohio">
<text>Salem Township is one of the eleven townships of Warren County, Ohio, United States, located in the central part of the county. The population was 5,215 at the 2020 census. It is the second smallest township in the county with 13,459 acres (54 km). It is one of fourteen Salem Townships statewide.

==Geography==
Located in the southern part of the county, it borders the following townships:
*Washington Township - northeast
*Harlan Township - southeast
*Hamilton Township - southwest
*Union Township - west
*Turtlecreek Township - northwest

It is bisected by the Little Miami River.

The village of Morrow lies entirely within the township.

==History==
Salem Township was established June 8, 1818 from Hamilton Township and originally consisted of the part of Salem south of the Little Miami and what is now Harlan Township. By a special act of the Ohio General Assembly of March 16, 1860, Harlan Township was separated from it and Salem was renamed Corwin Township. Later that year the Warren County Commissioners renamed the township Salem and took a portion of Union across the Little Miami and attached it to Salem. Salem Township is in both the Symmes Purchase and the Virginia Military District.

==Government==
The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.

==Public services==
Most of the township is the Little Miami Local School District, but a part north of the Little Miami River is in the Lebanon City School District. Salem Township is within the Morrow, Lebanon, and Clarksville telephone exchanges and the Morrow post office&#x27;s territory.

<doc id="1058141" wikidata="Q182086" url="?curid=1058141" title="Agostino Casaroli">
<text>Agostino Casaroli (24 November 1914 – 9 June 1998) was an Italian Catholic priest and diplomat for the Holy See, who became Cardinal Secretary of State. He was an important figure behind the Vatican&#x27;s efforts to deal with the religious persecution of the Church in the nations of the Soviet bloc after the Second Vatican Council.

==Biography==
Casaroli was born in Castel San Giovanni in the province of Piacenza, Italy, to a family of humble roots. His father was a tailor in Piacenza. He was educated at the Collegio Alberoni in Piacenza; the Episcopal Seminary of Bedonia, Piacenza; the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome where he earned a doctorate in canon law; and at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy.

===Early career===
He was ordained to the priesthood on 27 May 1937 in Piacenza. He studied in Rome from 1937 to 1939. Beginning in 1940 he served in the Vatican Secretariat of State while also participating in pastoral ministry in the diocese of Rome from 1943. He was named Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on 4 January 1945. He served as chaplain of Villa Agnese from 1950 to 1998. He was raised to the rank of Domestic prelate of His Holiness on 22 December 1954.

He served as an assistant to Cardinal Adeodato Giovanni Piazza at the First General Conference of the Latin American Bishops in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1955. He served as a faculty member of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy from 1958 to 1961. On 24 February 1961, he was appointed Undersecretary of the Sacred Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, effectively deputy foreign minister. In 1964, he represented the Holy See at the exchange of instruments in ratification of the &quot;modus vivendi&quot; with Tunisia, concerning the situation of the Catholic Church. He was a signatory of the partial agreement between the Holy See and Hungary in Budapest on 15 September 1964. He negotiated with the Communist Czechoslovak government over the appointment of František Tomášek as apostolic administrator of the Archdiocese of Prague in February 1965. He was appointed secretary of the Sacred Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs on 29 June 1967.

Pope Paul consecrated him a bishop on 16 July 1967.

During the period following Vatican II, Casaroli gained a reputation as a highly skilled diplomat who was able to negotiate with regimes hostile to the Church. He headed the CSCE conference in Helsinki from 30 July to 1 August 1975. On 28 April 1979, he was appointed Pro-Secretary of State.

===Cardinal===
Casaroli was made a Cardinal-Priest of Ss. XII Apostoli in John Paul II&#x27;s first consistory in 1979, and at the same time he became Secretary of State. Although he was seen as less hardline than any other close associate of John Paul, Casaroli&#x27;s skillful diplomacy was seen by Wojtyła as an irreplaceable asset in the struggle against the Soviet Union.
In 1985 he became Cardinal Bishop of the suburbicarian diocese of Porto-Santa-Rufina, and in 1990 he retired as Secretary of State, being succeeded by Angelo Sodano (who became Pro-Secretary of State at that time). He was Vice-Dean of the College of Cardinals from 1993 until his 1998 death of cardiorespiratory disease.

==Views==

===Relations with Communism===
As the Holy See&#x27;s Secretary of State, Casaroli was a significant influence in the Holy See&#x27;s efforts to come to terms with the Communist countries.

Casaroli&#x27;s signing of treaties with Hungary in 1964 and Yugoslavia in 1966 was the first time the Holy See had opened itself in this way to Communist regimes. Although his 2000 memoirs revealed a man hostile to Communism, his diplomatic skill made this hostility appear non-existent.

According to John O. Koehler, the KGB and its &quot;brother organs&quot; in Eastern Europe were well aware of Cardinal Casaroli&#x27;s real opinions and influence. Therefore, his personal office was one of the primary espionage targets inside the Vatican.

The KGB was assisted in this by the Cardinal&#x27;s own nephew, Marco Torreta, and Torreta&#x27;s Czechoslovakian wife Irene Trollerova. According to Italian intelligence officials, Torreta had been a KGB informant since 1950.

According to Koehler:
Irene returned from Czechoslovakia in the early 1980s, with a ceramic statue of the Virgin Mary, about 10 inches high, a beautiful work of renowned Czech ceramic art. The couple presented the statue to Cardinal Casaroli, who accepted gratefully. What a betrayal by his own nephew! Inside the revered religious icon was a &quot;bug&quot;, a tiny but powerful transmitter, which was monitored from outside the building by the couple&#x27;s handlers from the Soviet Embassy in Rome. The statue had been placed in an armoire in the dining room close to Cardinal Casaroli&#x27;s office. Another eavesdropping device inside a rectangular piece of wood was hidden in the same armoire. Both were not discovered til 1990 during a massive probe initiated by Magistrate Rosario Priore in the aftermath of the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II.

On 10 June 1981, on the 100th anniversary of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin&#x27;s birth, &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot;, the official Vatican newspaper, published a letter by Casaroli that praised the &quot;astonishing resonance of his research, as well as the brilliance of his personality and richness of his thinking.&quot; Casaroli wrote that Teilhard had anticipated John Paul II&#x27;s call to &quot;be not afraid&quot;, embracing &quot;culture, civilization and progress&quot;. The letter was antedated 12 May 1981, the day prior to the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II, but was published during his convalescence. On 20 July 1981, a communiqué of the Press Office of the Holy See stated that the letter did not change the position of the warning issued by the Holy Office on 30 June 1962, which pointed out that Chardin&#x27;s work contained ambiguities and grave doctrinal errors.

<doc id="1058162" wikidata="Q7717650" url="?curid=1058162" title="The Big Gig">
<text>The Big Gig was a popular Australian television sketch comedy music/variety series based on the British TV series &quot;Saturday Live&quot;. It was produced and broadcast on ABC TV in the late 1980s and early 1990s and was produced and directed by Ted Robinson, who started his career as the director of the second series of the acclaimed &quot;The Aunty Jack Show&quot; in the early 1970s, and Neil Wilson.

==Program Synopsis ==
Largely based around performers sourced from the thriving Melbourne stand-up comedy scene of that time, the series brought a number of new comedy acts to national prominence and made major stars of its host, stand-up comedian Wendy Harmer, who later became a top-rating host on morning radio in Sydney in the 1990s, and the regularly featured act, the Doug Anthony All-Stars.

Starting in 1989 and running until 1992 and originally named &quot;Tuesday Night Live&quot;, &quot;The Big Gig&quot; showcased both comedy and music and offered opportunities not available to the performers otherwise.

The show typically started with a monologue from host Wendy Harmer (or, from mid-1989 to mid-1990, Glynn Nicholas) before launching into a musical act. Regulars on the show included the house band The Swinging Sidewalks (which included singer Rebecca Barnard), the Bachelors from Prague or Zydeko Jump; the same band would also close the show while the credits played over them.

A regular feature of &quot;The Big Gig&quot; was the character &#x27;Veronica Glenhuntly&#x27; (played by comedian Jean Kittson), an acid-tongued newsreader. Many storylines would run through her, including her on-air wooing, marriage and birth of twins (named Veronica, after herself, and Wayne, after her husband, golf-star Wayne &quot;Lightning&quot; Truscott). She was later joined by weather reporter Clinton Funt, played by musician and comedian Phillip Scott. The character partly parodied contemporary ABC (Victoria) newsreader Mary Delahunty, but her surname was also a reference to the elite Melbourne suburb of Glenhuntly. Kittson also played several other characters, including ditzy gym nut Candida Royale and sinister flight attendant Rose McCloud.

&quot;The Big Gig&quot; became known for showcasing many new comedy acts, including Judith Lucy, Anthony Morgan, Jimeoin, Greg Fleet, Lano and Woodley (at the time members of a trio called The Found Objects, with Scott Casley), Scared Weird Little Guys and The Umbilical Brothers,

Nevertheless, major drawcards for both the studio audience and viewers at home was the regular cast. Some played characters—for example, Glynn Nicholas portrayed saccharine children&#x27;s TV performer Paté Biscuit and her hand puppet Bongo (a broad send-up of 70s Aussie children&#x27;s TV star Patsy Biscoe who famously appeared with Nicholas on the show in 1990), and oafish policeman Sergeant F*kn Smith. Co-writing Nicholas&#x27;s material was the young Shaun Micallef. Comedians Matt Parkinson and Matthew Quartermaine, aka The Empty Pockets also played the Lager Boys. The Lager Boys featured in a popular series of anarchic blackout sketches, promoting fictitious products and/or TV programs, and which were noted for including brief intercuts taken from pornographic videos. Viewers often taped &quot;The Big Gig&quot; on their VCRs in order to replay the Lager Boys segments in slow motion.

After successful guest appearances on the first series Sydney comedian Anthony Ackroyd became a regular cast member. He provided stand up spots as well as the characters Addam (a parody of a coked up advertising guru), the Bard (a Shakespearean style poet) and Constable Constable (partner of Glynn Nicholas&#x27;s Sergeant Smith). Angela Moore, later a cast member of the children&#x27;s programme &quot;Play School&quot;, played another popular semi-regular character, the batty, screechy-voiced housewife Shirley Purvis, with fellow &quot;Play School&quot; alumnus Glenn Butcher playing her hopeless son Darren. Shirley and Darren were characters they had originated while members of popular comedy troupe The Castanet Club. Other regular cast members included Denise Scott, Tracy Harvey, Lynda Gibson, Phillip Scott and Paul Livingston (as Flacco).

The most popular featured act was the irreverent musical comedy trio the Doug Anthony All Stars, also known as DAAS, whose trademark pseudo-military uniforms and shameless attacks on sacred cows quickly garnered a reputation. The Dougs, as they became known, would often be on at the end of the program and were regulars up until 1991, when they left to produce their own show, &quot;DAAS Kapital&quot; (also shown on ABC TV). In 2008, all the DAAS appearances from the first two seasons, plus a performance of &quot;Warsong&quot; from 1992 to promote &quot;DAAS Kapital&quot;, were released on DVD.

<text>HMS &quot;Ceylon&quot; was a light cruiser of the Royal Navy. She was of the &quot;Ceylon&quot; sub class, named after the island and British colony of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The cruiser saw service in the Atlantic and Pacific theatres during the Second World War. In the postwar era, she participated in actions in Egypt and the Korean War. In 1960 she transferred to the navy of Peru and renamed . The cruiser was scrapped in 1985.

==Service history==

===Wartime career===

Built by Stephens at Govan and launched on 30 July 1942, she was completed on 13 July 1943. After two months in the Home Fleet she was transferred to the 4th Cruiser Squadron, with the Eastern Fleet and took part in many carrier raids, bombardments and patrols against Japanese-held territory, including Operations Cockpit, Meridian and Diplomat. In November 1944 she joined the British Pacific Fleet and sailed from Trincomalee on 16 January, taking part in a raid on Pankalan Bradan en route. By May 1945, however, she was back in the Indian Ocean, shelling the Nicobar Islands, and remained in that theatre until the end of the war. In October 1945 she returned to England for refit and lay-up.

===Postwar===
Post-war, she served in the Portsmouth Command during 1946/50, followed by the 5th and 4th Cruiser Squadrons on the Far East and East Indies stations. She was actively engaged in the Korean War, carrying out a number of bombardments.

&quot;Ceylon&quot;, in poor condition, was given a major refit from March 1955 to July 1956 to suit her for further service until the s could enter service. A Type 960 long range air warning radar replaced the existing Type 281B, while the Type 277 height finder radar was upgraded to 277Q standard and the UA-1 ESM system was fitted. Fire control for the ship&#x27;s 4-inch guns was provided by US-supplied Mark 63 systems, with radar mounted on the gun mounts, while short range anti-aircraft defence was provided by an outfit of 18 Bofors 40-mm guns in five twin Mark 5 mounts and eight single Mark 7 mounts, with the Mark 5 mounts provided with Simple Tachymetric directors (STD).

After trials with the new equipment, in late 1956, &quot;Ceylon&quot; was deployed to the Mediterranean where she provided long range gunfire support to suppress Egyptian shore battery emplacements at Port Said in support of the British Army and Royal Marine landings. A Communication Officer on the cruiser describes &quot;Ceylon&quot;″s bombardment as relatively brief, as the Egyptian batteries did not return fire. Later in the operation &quot;Ceylon&quot; served as an air direction picket, having been withdrawn for political reasons and the cruiser &quot;Jamaica&quot; lacking modern air warning and aircraft direction equipment. Between 1956 and 1959 she served in the Mediterranean Fleet, Home Fleet and East of Suez.

===Peruvian service===

On 18 December 1959, she returned to Portsmouth and was sold to Peru the same month. The disposal of the &quot;Ceylon&quot;, only three years after its modernisation, came as a shock to its last captain, Frank Twiss. On 9 February 1960, she was transferred to the Peruvian Navy and renamed . The sale of her and while the older Colony and Town cruisers – , , and – remained in service or reserve until the election of a Labour Government in 1964, probably reflected a good price on the sale to Peru and the need for cuts to save the &quot;Tiger&quot; class. The fact that &quot;Newfoundland&quot; and &quot;Ceylon&quot; remained in Peruvian service till the 1980s meant some crucial parts for the maintenance of the &quot;Tiger&quot;s were obtained from Peru in the 1970s.

She spent over twenty years with the Peruvians until she was finally deleted from the Navy List in May 1982 and towed to Taiwan in August 1985 to be scrapped.

<doc id="1058165" wikidata="Q3178883" url="?curid=1058165" title="Jim Marshall (defensive end)">
<text>James Lawrence Marshall (born December 30, 1937) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL) for 20 seasons, primarily with the Minnesota Vikings. He played college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes, before leaving to play for the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fourth round of the 1960 NFL draft.

Marshall recovered an NFL record 29 opponents&#x27; fumbles, including his 1964 &quot;wrong-way run&quot;, a play in which he recovered a fumble and returned it 66 yards in the wrong direction into his own end zone, where he threw the ball out of bounds, resulting in a safety for the San Francisco 49ers. He owns the career records for most consecutive starts (270) and most games played (282) by a defensive player.

==Early life==
Marshall was born on December 30, 1937, in Wilsonville or Danville, in Boyle County, Kentucky. His family moved to Columbus, Ohio when he was five, but he would spend summers in Wilsonville. He attended Columbus East High School. He was on the football team that was twice undefeated, and was selected All-State, All-City and a high school All-American.

==Football career==

=== College ===
Marshall played college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes (1957–58). In 1958, he was selected All-American at tackle. He was also a track star at Ohio State, setting school records at discus and shot put in 1958.

In 1957, the Buckeyes were 9–1 overall, 7–0 in the Big Ten Conference, and ended the season ranked second to Auburn in the Associated Press (AP) national poll, and ranked first by UPI and the Football Writers Association of American. Along with Marshall, the team included other future NFL players like Jim Houston, Dick LeBeau, and Bill Jobko. Marshall played in the 1958 Rose Bowl (January 1, 1958), which the Buckeyes won 10–7 over Oregon.

The 1958 Buckeye team ended the season ranked 8th in the AP poll. In a November 1958 game against Purdue, Mashall had a 25-yard interception return for a touchdown, and a 22-yard return of a blocked punt for another touchdown; Ohio State&#x27;s only two touchdowns in the game. Jim Houston had blocked the punt Marshall recovered, and deflected the pass Marshall intercepted.

In 1978, Marshall was inducted into the Ohio State Hall of Fame.

=== Canadian Football League ===
Marshall left school before his senior year, primarily for financial reasons, and played for the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League (CFL) in 1959. The Roughriders had obtained Marshall&#x27;s CFL rights from Ottawa in April 1959. Marshall typically played defensive line, but was used on offense as well. In one game he caught a touchdown pass against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, who were coached by Bud Grant, Marshall&#x27;s future head coach on the Vikings. After one year, he was traded to the Cleveland Browns in an NFL–CFL transaction, being swapped for Bob Ptacek, who had played against Marshall in college at the University of Michigan. Cleveland&#x27;s Paul Brown had selected Marshall in the fourth round of the 1960 NFL draft, obtaining the rights to sign him.

=== National Football League ===
Marshall played the 1960 season with the Browns. He contracted encephalitis during military training before the 1961 season, and was seriously ill, even being placed in an induced coma to save his life. He was traded along with five other players (including fellow defensive lineman Paul Dickson) to the expansion Minnesota Vikings in exchange for two draft picks in the 1962 NFL draft. He played from 1961 to 1979 with the Vikings and finished with a then-record 282 consecutive games played (since surpassed by punter Jeff Feagles). Marshall started 270 consecutive games while playing for the Vikings, an NFL record since surpassed by Brett Favre.

Marshall played in the Pro Bowl in 1968 and 1969. He recovered 30 fumbles during his career, an NFL record. He was a member of the Vikings&#x27; famous &quot;Purple People Eaters&quot; (which consisted of Marshall (DE), Alan Page (DT), Gary Larsen (DT), and Carl Eller (DE)), and was the final player from Minnesota&#x27;s initial expansion team of 1961 to retire. Marshall had 127 career quarterback sacks as a Viking, second-most in team history behind Eller. At the time of his retirement in 1979, Marshall had played in every game in Vikings history. In his final Vikings home game, he had two sacks, and was awarded a game ball, the first ever awarded by longtime Vikings coach Bud Grant.

Marshall is one of 11 players to have played in all four of the Vikings&#x27; Super Bowl appearances in the 1970s.

==Personal life==
Marshall resides in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. He has been married twice: firstly to Anita (with whom he has two daughters) and then a second time, to Susan. In September 2009, when quarterback Brett Favre was set to surpass Marshall&#x27;s record of consecutive games started, he could not attend the game as it coincided with his wedding anniversary. A few days later, Marshall visited the Vikings&#x27; practice facilities to congratulate Favre in person.

After retirement he was involved in the financial services industry, real estate and insurance. He is also involved with foundations serving the needs of homeless and unemployed youth.

==Legacy==
Marshall&#x27;s No. 70 has been retired by the Vikings and he is a member of the team&#x27;s Ring of Honor. In 2004, Marshall was named to the Professional Football Researchers Association Hall of Very Good in the association&#x27;s second HOVG class. Marshall was a finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2004, but was not elected. In 2008, NFL Network named Marshall the second-best player not in the Hall of Fame on their &quot;NFL Top 10&quot; program, behind only Green Bay Packers offensive lineman Jerry Kramer; Kramer would be inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2018. In 2023 and 2024, he was listed as a semifinalist for the senior nominees, but failed to advance to the final 12.

===The Wrong Way Run===

During his time with the Minnesota Vikings, Marshall&#x27;s most infamous moment took place. Marshall was playing in a game against the San Francisco 49ers on October 25, 1964.

After recovering an offensive fumble, Marshall ran 66 yards the wrong way into his team&#x27;s own end zone. After completing the run, thinking that he had scored a touchdown for the Vikings, Marshall then pitched the ball in celebration, and the ball landed out of bounds, resulting in a safety for the 49ers. Marshall didn&#x27;t realize what he&#x27;d done until 49ers lineman Bruce Bosley thanked him, and teammate Fran Tarkenton, who was on the near sideline followed by telling Marshall what he&#x27;d done. According to Marshall, when he approached Vikings head coach Norm Van Brocklin after the play, all Van Brocklin said was, &quot;Well Jim, you&#x27;ve done the most interesting thing in this game today.&quot; Despite the gaffe, the Vikings won the game 27–22, thanks to a forced fumble by Marshall, which Eller returned for a touchdown.

Marshall later received a letter from Roy Riegels, infamous for a wrong-way run in the 1929 Rose Bowl, stating, &quot;Welcome to the club.&quot; In 2019, Marshall&#x27;s miscue was ranked No. 54 among the NFL&#x27;s 100 Greatest Plays.

<text>Michael Arad (Hebrew: מיכאל ארד) is an Israeli-American architect who is best known for being the designer of the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum. He won the competition to design the memorial in 2004.

==Early life and education==
Arad, an Israeli citizen, was born in 1969 in London. London was where his father, Moshe Arad, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States and Mexico, was on a diplomatic mission. Arad lived in Jerusalem for nine years. He did his military service in a Golani Brigade commando unit.

Arad received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Dartmouth College, and a master&#x27;s degree from Georgia Institute of Technology&#x27;s College of Architecture.

==Career==
He moved to New York City in 1999 and worked as an architect at Kohn Pedersen Fox for three years. After KPF, Arad briefly worked for Leclere Associate Architects. When he submitted his design to the competition for the World Trade Center memorial, he was working for the New York City Housing Authority, designing police stations for the New York City Police Department. Arad now works for Handel Architects, which has offices in New York and San Francisco.

===World Trade Center designer===

===Ideas for design===
Unidentified human remains recovered from the World Trade Center site would be interred at the bottom of the North Tower footprint at the site&#x27;s deepest point, 70 feet underground. At street level, with the help of landscape architect Peter Walker, Arad proposed a cobblestone plaza with moss and grass and planted with eastern white pine trees.

&quot;This design proposes a space that resonates with the feelings of loss and absence that were generated by the death and destruction at the World Trade Center,&quot; Arad said in the statement.

Initially criticized for the starkness of the design and failure to differentiate the civilian victims from those who died in the line of duty, Arad presented a revised version in conjunction with Walker. The high cost of the project, originally estimated at $1 billion, also sparked controversy.

==Personal life==
Arad resides in Douglaston, Queens, New York with his wife, Melanie Arad Fitzpatrick, and his children, Nathaniel, Ariel and Daniella.

<doc id="1058169" wikidata="Q1341627" url="?curid=1058169" title="Rod McKuen">
<text>Rodney Marvin McKuen ( ; ; April 29, 1933 – January 29, 2015) was an American poet, singer-songwriter, and composer. He was one of the best-selling poets in the United States during the late 1960s. Throughout his career, McKuen produced a wide range of recordings, which included popular music, spoken word poetry, film soundtracks and classical music. He earned two Academy Award nominations for his music compositions. McKuen&#x27;s translations and adaptations of the songs of Jacques Brel were instrumental in bringing the Belgian songwriter to prominence in the English-speaking world. His poetry deals with themes of love, the natural world and spirituality. McKuen&#x27;s songs sold over 100 million recordings worldwide, and 60 million books of his poetry were sold as well.

==Early years==
McKuen was born as Rodney Marvin Woolever on April 29, 1933, in a Salvation Army hostel in Oakland, California to Clarice Woolever. Per &quot;The New York Times,&quot; he had &quot;two birth certificates, each giving conflicting dates and spelling his father&#x27;s name different ways.&quot; He never knew his biological father, who had left his mother. Sexually and physically abused by relatives, raised by his mother and stepfather, who was a violent alcoholic, McKuen ran away from home. He drifted along the West Coast, supporting himself as a ranch hand, surveyor, railroad worker, lumberjack, rodeo cowboy, stuntman, and radio disc jockey, always sending money home to his mother.

At some point, he began using the name &quot;McKuen&quot; as the best approximation of what he thought his father&#x27;s name was. His mother told him that his father&#x27;s name was &quot;Mac&quot; McKuen (although she was unsure how it was spelled). At one point later in life, McKuen hired a detective agency to try to locate his father. Per &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Whether or not he found his father, at least he (and the detectives) found a man 10 years deceased who satisfies him -- Rodney Marion McKune, a lumberman in Utah, twice married (the last time to a woman 20 years his senior), who at the close of his life was an iceman in Santa Monica, Calif., 20 miles from where McKuen was living. No relative of this McKune remembers him taking a trip from Utah to Oakland that summer of 1932 when the author was conceived, but a Mormon churchman remembers taking a trip there with him in 1931 or 1932.&quot;

To compensate for his lack of formal education, McKuen began keeping a journal, which resulted in his first poetry and song lyrics. After dropping out of Oakland Technical High School prior to graduating in 1951, McKuen worked as a newspaper columnist and propaganda script writer during the Korean War. He settled in San Francisco, where he read his poetry in clubs alongside Beat poets like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. He began performing as a folk singer at the famed Purple Onion. Over time, he began incorporating his own songs into his act. He was signed to Decca Records and released several pop albums in the late 1950s. McKuen also appeared as an actor in &quot;Rock, Pretty Baby&quot; (1956), &quot;Summer Love&quot; (1958), and the western &quot;Wild Heritage&quot; (1958). He also sang with Lionel Hampton&#x27;s band. In 1959, McKuen moved to New York City to compose and conduct music for the TV show &quot;The CBS Workshop&quot;. McKuen appeared on &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot; on June 18, 1962, as a decoy contestant and described himself as &quot;a published poet and a twist singer.&quot;

==Discovering Jacques Brel==
In the early 1960s, McKuen moved to France, where he first met the Belgian singer-songwriter and chanson singer Jacques Brel. McKuen began to translate the work of this composer into English, which led to the song &quot;If You Go Away&quot; – an international pop-standard – based on Brel&#x27;s &quot;Ne me quitte pas&quot;. McKuen translated Brel&#x27;s song &quot;Le Moribond&quot; loosely into &quot;Seasons in the Sun&quot;, and British folkbeat group The Fortunes charted with the song in the Netherlands in 1969. In 1974, singer Terry Jacks turned McKuen&#x27;s &quot;Seasons in the Sun&quot; into a best-selling pop hit, and also charted with a cover of &quot;If You Go Away.&quot; McKuen also translated songs by other French songwriters, including Georges Moustaki, Gilbert Bécaud, Pierre Delanoé, and Michel Sardou.

In 1978, after hearing of Brel&#x27;s death, McKuen was quoted as saying, &quot;As friends and as musical collaborators we had traveled, toured and written – together and apart – the events of our lives as if they were songs, and I guess they were. When news of Jacques&#x27; death came I stayed locked in my bedroom and drank for a week. That kind of self-pity was something he wouldn&#x27;t have approved of, but all I could do was replay our songs (our children) and ruminate over our unfinished life together.&quot;

==Poetry==
In the late 1960s, McKuen began to publish books of poetry, earning a substantial following among young people with collections like &quot;Stanyan Street &amp; Other Sorrows&quot; (1966), &quot;Listen to the Warm&quot; (1967), and &quot;Lonesome Cities&quot; (1968). His &quot;Lonesome Cities&quot; album of readings won a Grammy for Best Spoken Word Recording in 1968. McKuen&#x27;s poems were translated into eleven languages and his books sold over 1 million copies in 1968 alone. McKuen said that his most romantic poetry was influenced by American poet Walter Benton&#x27;s two books of poems. McKuen sold over 60 million books worldwide, according to the Associated Press.

==Songwriting==
McKuen wrote over 1,500 songs and released up to 200 albums which have accounted for the sale of over 100 million records worldwide according to the Associated Press. His songs have been performed by such diverse artists as Robert Goulet, Glenn Yarbrough, Barbra Streisand, Perry Como, Petula Clark, Waylon Jennings, The Boston Pops, Chet Baker, Jimmie Rodgers, Johnny Cash, Pete Fountain, Andy Williams, The Kingston Trio, Percy Faith, the London Philharmonic, Nana Mouskouri, Daliah Lavi,Julio Iglesias, Dusty Springfield, Johnny Mathis, Al Hirt, Greta Keller, Aaron Freeman, and Frank Sinatra.

In 1959, McKuen released his first novelty single with Bob McFadden, under the pseudonym Dor on the Brunswick label, called &quot;The Mummy&quot;. The McKuen-written song reached No. 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart. In 1961, he had a hit single titled &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. He co-wrote it along with Gladys Shelley and the Spiral label-issued single reached No. 76 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart. His hoarse and throaty singing voice on these and other recordings was a result of McKuen straining his vocal cords in 1961 due to too many promotional appearances.

He collaborated with numerous composers, including Henry Mancini, John Williams, Anita Kerr, and Arthur Greenslade. His symphonies, concertos, and other orchestral works have been performed by orchestras around the globe. His work as a composer in the film industry garnered him two Academy Award nominations for &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; (1969) and &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot; (1969), and his other film scores have included &quot;Joanna&quot; (1968), &quot;Me, Natalie&quot; (1969), &quot;Scandalous John&quot; (1971), &quot;The Borrowers&quot; (1973) and &quot;Emily&quot; (1976). McKuen&#x27;s contribution to &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;, the first feature-length animation based on Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; also included him singing the title song. McKuen also earned a mention in the &quot;Peanuts&quot; strip dated October 3, 1969, in which Sally Brown expresses her frustration that she was sent to the principal&#x27;s office for an outburst in art class, opining that Pablo Picasso and Rod McKuen surely must have had trouble drawing cows&#x27; legs when they were young.

In 1967, McKuen began collaborating with arranger Anita Kerr and the San Sebastian Strings for a series of albums featuring McKuen&#x27;s poetry recited over Kerr&#x27;s mood music, including &quot;The Sea&quot; (1967), &quot;The Earth&quot; (1967), &quot;The Sky&quot; (1968), &quot;Home to the Sea&quot; (1969), &quot;For Lovers&quot; (1969), and &quot;The Soft Sea&quot; (1970). Jesse Pearson was the narrator of &quot;The Sea&quot; and its follow-ups &quot;Home to the Sea&quot; and &quot;The Soft Sea&quot;, while most other albums in the series had McKuen narrating. In 1969, Frank Sinatra commissioned an entire album of poems and songs by McKuen; arranged by Don Costa, it was released under the title &quot;A Man Alone: The Words and Music of Rod McKuen&quot;. The album featured the song &quot;Love&#x27;s Been Good to Me&quot;, which became one of McKuen&#x27;s best-known songs.

McKuen performed solo in a half-hour special broadcast by NBC on May 10, 1969. The program, billed as McKuen&#x27;s &quot;first television special&quot;, featured the songs &quot;The Loner&quot;, &quot;The World I Used to Know&quot;, &quot;The Complete Madame Butterfly&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Been to Town&quot;, &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;, &quot;Stanyan Street&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Cities&quot;, &quot;Listen to the Warm&quot;, &quot;Trashy&quot;, and &quot;Merci Beaucoup&quot;. It was produced by Lee Mendelson, producer of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials, and directed by Marty Pasetta. James Trittipo designed a set that was &quot;evocative of waterfront pilings&quot; and Arthur Greenslade conducted the orchestra. In 1971, he hosted a series, &quot;The Rod McKuen Show&quot;, on BBC television in the UK.
McKuen&#x27;s Academy Award-nominated composition &quot;Jean&quot;, sung by Oliver, reached No.1 in 1969 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart and stayed there for four weeks. In 1971, his song &quot;I Think of You&quot; was a major hit for Perry Como. Other popular McKuen compositions included &quot;The World I Used to Know&quot;, &quot;Rock Gently&quot;, &quot;Doesn&#x27;t Anybody Know My Name&quot;, &quot;The Importance of the Rose&quot;, &quot;Without a Worry in the World&quot;, and &quot;Soldiers Who Want to Be Heroes&quot;.

In 1971, McKuen became popular in the Netherlands, where the singles &quot;Soldiers Who Want to Be Heroes&quot; and &quot;Without a Worry in the World&quot; reached number one in the charts, as did the album &quot;Greatest Hits, Vol. 3&quot;. All three discs earned him gold records; in 1971 he was voted the Netherlands&#x27; most popular entertainer by Radio Veronica&#x27;s audience.

During the 1970s, McKuen began composing larger-scale orchestral compositions, writing a series of concertos, suites, symphonies, and chamber pieces for orchestra. He continued publishing a steady stream of poetry books throughout the decade. In 1977, he published &quot;Finding My Father&quot;, a chronicle of his search for information on his biological father. The book and its publicity helped make such information more readily available to adopted children. He also continued to record, releasing albums such as &quot;New Ballads&quot; (1970), &quot;Pastorale&quot; (1971), and the country-rock outing &quot;McKuen Country&quot; (1976).

McKuen continued to perform concerts around the world and appeared regularly at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall throughout the 1970s, making sporadic appearances as recently as the early 2000s.

==Later years==
In 1973, at 40 years of age, McKuen radically changed his outward appearance: he no longer bleached his hair and he grew a beard.

McKuen retired from live performances in 1981. The following year, he was diagnosed with clinical depression, which he battled for much of the next decade. He continued to write poetry, however, and made appearances as a voice-over actor in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and on its spin-off TV series, as well as on the TV series &quot;The Critic&quot;.

2001 saw the publication of McKuen&#x27;s &quot;A Safe Place to Land&quot;, which contains 160 pages of new poetry. For 10 years he gave an annual birthday concert at Carnegie Hall or the Lincoln Center. He released the double CD &quot;The Platinum Collection&quot; and was remastering all of his RCA and Warner Bros. recordings for release as CD boxed sets. In addition to his artistic pursuits he was the Executive President of the American Guild of Variety Artists (AGVA), a post he held longer than any other man or woman elected to the position.

McKuen lived in Beverly Hills, California, with his partner Edward Habib, whom he called his &quot;brother&quot;, and four cats in a large rambling Spanish house built in 1928, which housed one of the world&#x27;s largest private record collections. He died of respiratory arrest, a result of pneumonia, at a hospital in Beverly Hills, California, on January 29, 2015.

==LGBT activism==
McKuen never publicly identified with a particular sexual orientation, though he did describe his sexuality by saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine choosing one sex over the other, that&#x27;s just too limiting. I can&#x27;t even honestly say I have a preference.&quot; He was active in the LGBT rights movement, and as early as the 1950s, was a key member of the San Francisco chapter of the Mattachine Society, one of the nation&#x27;s earliest LGBT advocacy organizations.

McKuen often avoided gender references in the lyrics of his love songs. He often gave benefit performances to aid LGBT rights organizations and to fund AIDS research.

Easy In&quot; featured a photo of popular gay adult actor Bruno&#x27;s arm gripping a handful of vegetable shortening; the can was a pastiche of Crisco – then widely used by gay men as a sexual lubricant for fisting– with the label instead reading &quot;Disco&quot;. An inscription on the cover stated &quot;this was a project everyone had to get into; not just on the surface, but deeply—and together. If you don&#x27;t feel &quot;easy in&quot; then perhaps your threshold of pain or pleasure needs looking into.&quot;

That same year, McKuen spoke out against singer Anita Bryant and her &quot;Save Our Children&quot; campaign to repeal an anti-discrimination ordinance in Miami, tagging Bryant with the nickname &quot;Ginny Orangeseed&quot;, and also including a song on &quot;Slide... Easy In&quot; titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Orange Juice&quot;—which the album cover states was written and recorded on her birthday—referencing Bryant&#x27;s fame as commercial spokesperson for the Florida Citrus Commission.

The last track on the album is titled &quot;Full Moon Over The Ansonia Hotel.&quot; Until 1976, the Ansonia had been home to the Continental Baths, a gay bathhouse and dance club.

==Criticism==
Despite his popular appeal, McKuen&#x27;s work was never taken seriously by critics or academics. Michael Baers observed in Gale Research&#x27;s &quot;St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture&quot; that &quot;through the years his books have drawn uniformly unkind reviews. In fact, criticism of his poetry is uniformly vituperative ...&quot; In a &quot;Washington Post&quot; obituary, Matt Schudel suggests that McKuen&#x27;s commercial success engendered a backlash from the literary community. McKuen himself quipped that &quot;The most unforgivable sin in the world is to be a bestselling poet&quot;.

Frank W. Hoffmann, in &quot;Arts and Entertainment Fads&quot;, described McKuen&#x27;s poetry as &quot;tailor-made for the 1960s ... poetry with a verse that drawled in country cadences from one shapeless line to the next, carrying the rusticated innocence of a Carl Sandburg thickened by the treacle of a man who preferred to prettify the world before he described it&quot;.

Philosopher and social critic Robert C. Solomon described McKuen&#x27;s poetry as &quot;sweet kitsch,&quot; and, at the height of his popularity in 1969, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine called him &quot;the King of Kitsch.&quot;

Writer and literary critic Nora Ephron said, &quot;[F]or the most part, McKuen&#x27;s poems are superficial and platitudinous and frequently silly.&quot; Pulitzer Prize-winning US Poet Laureate Karl Shapiro said, &quot;It is irrelevant to speak of McKuen as a poet. His poetry is not even trash.&quot;

In a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; interview with McKuen in 2001 as he was &quot;testing the waters&quot; for a comeback tour, Pulitzer Prize-winning culture critic Julia Keller claimed that &quot;Millions more have loathed him [...] finding his work so schmaltzy and smarmy that it makes the pronouncements of Kathie Lee Gifford sound like Susan Sontag,&quot; and that his work &quot;drives many people crazy. They find it silly and mawkish, the kind of gooey schmaltz that wouldn&#x27;t pass muster in a freshman creative-writing class&quot; while stating that &quot;The masses ate him up with a spoon, while highbrow literary critics roasted him on a spit.&quot; She noted that the third concert on his tour had already been canceled because of sluggish ticket sales.

In May 2019, Backbeat Books published &quot;A Voice of the Warm: The Life of Rod McKuen&quot; by Barry Alfonso. This was the first in-depth biography of McKuen. In his introduction to the book, singer and music historian Michael Feinstein wrote that McKuen&#x27;s life and work held a significant place in pop culture: &quot;[McKuen] knew how to create something that made a reader or listener say, &#x27;That&#x27;s me.&#x27; Like Gershwin&#x27;s, his work is a document of the time in which it was created. But what he did also transcends that time and still speaks fundamentally to the things that matter to people: romance, relationships, the human condition. Those things don&#x27;t change. He used the vernacular of his time to reach the widest audience. But at its essence, his work is still valid and, I think, timeless.&quot;

<text>Norman Augustine Cafik, (December 29, 1928 – September 30, 2016) was a Canadian politician.

Born in Toronto, Ontario of a Ukrainian-Polish father and a Scottish-Irish mother, Cafik was unsuccessful in his attempts to win a seat in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1962 and 1963 elections, but was elected as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Ontario in the 1968 election.

Cafik&#x27;s 1972 re-election, defeating former Diefenbaker era minister Frank Charles McGee was particularly notable. He was initially reported to have lost his riding, yielding a 108-seat tie between the Stanfield Progressive Conservatives and the Trudeau Liberals. Subsequent re-count confirmed Cafik&#x27;s victory over McGee by 4 votes, giving the Liberals a two-seat lead in the minority parliament.

He attempted to move to provincial politics, running in 1973 for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party. He lost on the third ballot of the leadership convention to Robert Nixon.

In 1977, he was the second person of Ukrainian descent to be appointed to the Canadian Cabinet when Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau made him Minister of State for Multiculturalism. (Michael Starr was appointed by John Diefenbaker as the first Ukrainian in Cabinet.)

<text>Back to the Known is the second EP released by American punk rock band Bad Religion. The name of the EP is a reference to the band abandoning the progressive rock influences of its previous album, 1983&#x27;s &quot;Into the Unknown&quot;, and returning to its punk roots.

The album features the fan favorite &quot;Along The Way&quot;, which is a staple of their live shows today. During a live show in the mid 1980s, they played the song twice in a row at a sped-up pace the second time.

== History ==
Frontman Greg Graffin partially brought Bad Religion back together in 1984 and hired two new members, Circle Jerks guitarist Greg Hetson (who would remain with the band until 2013) and bassist Tim Gallegos. Drummer Pete Finestone (who left in 1982) also rejoined during this time. The new line-up recorded a new EP, which had only five songs, and was just over ten minutes long. It was originally released in a 12&quot; format, with only one side of the vinyl containing all five tracks. The A-side contained no music or sound of any kind and was mirror-smooth. It was re-released as part of the 1991 compilation &quot;&#x27;80-&#x27;85&quot;, and again remastered for the 2004 reissue, &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot;.

There has been some confusion over when &quot;Back to the Known&quot; was released. Due to a typo on a number of internet sources and the back cover of the vinyl, many believe that the EP was released in 1984, but this appears to be false. According to a Bad Religion fan site, the EP was recorded in 1985 with then-former and now-current guitarist Brett Gurewitz producing it.

No songs from this EP made it on to the band&#x27;s 1995 compilation album, &quot;All Ages&quot;.

== Track listing ==
== Trivia ==
* Track 3, &quot;Bad Religion&quot;, is a remake of the song from their 1981 self-titled EP.
* In 2009, a fan poll cited &quot;Along the Way&quot; as one of the band&#x27;s best songs.

== Personnel ==
Adapted from the album liner notes.

* Greg Graffin – vocals, acoustic guitar on &quot;New Leaf&quot;, production
* Greg Hetson – electric guitar
* Tim Gallegos – bass
* Pete Finestone – drums
* Brett Gurewitz – production, engineering

<doc id="1058176" wikidata="Q1914762" url="?curid=1058176" title="De Gordel">
<text>De Gordel (Dutch, pronounced , meaning &quot;the belt&quot;) is a family cycling and walking event in the Brussels Periphery of Belgium. The event is organised by Sport Vlaanderen, each year since 1981 on the first Sunday of September. It is meant as a symbolic affirmation that the municipalities involved are part of Flanders. It also expresses the solidarity of the entire Flemish community with the Flemings living in these villages.

Depending on the weather, up to 100,000 participants (in 2005) attend, either cycling or walking. In 2008, bad weather resulted in the lower attendance number of 58,000. The 2010 edition saw more than 80,000 participants.

While opinion on the event varies, some French-speakers see participation as a political move by those who choose to take part (including Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt in 2005). In 2006, Minister-President of Flanders Yves Leterme said: &quot;The Gordel is a pleasant way to say that we want to keep the villages around Brussels Flemish.&quot;. As Prime Minister, Yves Leterme did not participate in 2008.

So close to Brussels, and passing through several Flemish towns with French-speaking majorities in some areas, this sports event gains wide television coverage through news reports and serves as a very visual reminder that linguistic and political divisions among neighbouring regions and even neighbours themselves remain alive in the area immediately surrounding Brussels.

==Incidents==
De Gordel has fallen victim to sabotage actions several times in the past. During the 2006 event, local police caught a well-known French-speaking lawyer, Sébastien Courtoy, and another person throwing thumbtacks on the road. In 2008 and 2010 an increase in thumbtack throwing was noted.

==Gordelroute permanent cycle route==
The &quot;Gordelroute&quot; is a permanent cycle route encircling Brussels, based on De Gordel. It does not follow the same route as that used in the event, mainly following quieter roads and cycle paths, but is approximately the same distance (100 km).

<text>Charles John O&#x27;Donnell (August 12, 1932 – November 1, 2010) was an American radio and television announcer, primarily known for his work on game shows, and for his distinctive baritone voice. Among them, he was best known for &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, where he worked from 1975 to 1980, and again from 1989 until his death. O&#x27;Donnell was also known for announcing &quot;American Bandstand&quot;.

==Early career==
O&#x27;Donnell was a Philadelphia native, and was of English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. He began his career as a teenager at WCHA in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. In 1956, he worked as program director at WHAT, a 250-watt R&amp;B station in Philadelphia, where he discovered and launched the career of future Philadelphia radio personality Hy Lit. When WIBG became top-40 in 1957, O&#x27;Donnell was named news director. In 1958, he became the sidekick of Dick Clark on WFIL-TV&#x27;s afternoon dance program, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. 

This led to several stints as a disc jockey on Los Angeles radio (most notably on Pasadena station KRLA, 1964–67), and later as news anchorman and staff announcer on Los Angeles television station KCOP-TV, where he performed double duty and often introduced his own newscasts with the self-referential cue &quot;and now Charlie O&#x27;Donnell with the news.&quot; Additionally, Barry &amp; Enright Productions taped &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; and &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot; at KCOP during its initial syndicated runs, which O&#x27;Donnell announced for. It was also in this period that he voiced the newscaster on the Simon &amp; Garfunkel recording &quot;7 O&#x27;Clock News/Silent Night.&quot;

He made a full-time career as an announcer on many television shows throughout the decades, with such series as &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;, &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot;, &quot;Bullseye&quot; and &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot; (again working with Dick Clark). He also served as announcer for the &quot;American Music Awards&quot;, the &quot;Emmy Awards&quot;, and the &quot;Academy Awards&quot;.

==&quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and other game shows==
O&#x27;Donnell was perhaps best known as the announcer of the game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. He filled this role from 1975 to 1980 (including two unaired pilots hosted by &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; actor Edd Byrnes), acted as a substitute for his successor, Jack Clark, and returned to the show permanently several months after Clark&#x27;s death in 1988. Between Clark&#x27;s death and O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s return, disc jockey M.G. Kelly announced the show for most of its 1988-89 season. O&#x27;Donnell also contributed to the 2010 video game based on Wheel of Fortune, which was released just a day after his death.

Among the game show companies O&#x27;Donnell worked for as a primary announcer were Merv Griffin Enterprises/Sony Pictures Television (1975–87 and 1989–2010), Barry &amp; Enright Productions (1981–86), and Barris Industries/The Guber-Peters Entertainment Company (1986–89) He also announced game shows for Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions (including &quot;Card Sharks&quot;, &quot;Trivia Trap&quot;, &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;); Bob Stewart Productions (&quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot;); Hill-Eubanks Group&#x27;s &quot;All Star Secrets&quot; and &quot;The Guinness Game&quot;; and Scotti Bros.-Syd Vinnedge&#x27;s &quot;Wordplay&quot;. 

He and John Harlan filled in for Rod Roddy on different occasions on &quot;Press Your Luck&quot;. He also announced on the game show version of &quot;Monopoly&quot;, and re-voiced the credits tags for episodes of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, &quot;Wheel&quot; and &quot;Headline Chasers&quot; (and several other library game shows acquired by Sony) airing on Game Show Network produced before 1994, when Columbia TriStar Television became the new name of what is now Sony Pictures Television, and their new closing credits card replaced those of Coca-Cola Television, Columbia Pictures Television, and King World Productions (now CBS Media Ventures). He also performed voice acting and host duties off-screen on most of the &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; video games which came out after 1992, either along with Vanna White, or entirely by himself, as Pat Sajak would not participate in any of the video games until his children were grown.

In addition to announcing on &quot;The All-New Dating Game&quot;, he appeared as a bachelor during the show&#x27;s 1987-88 season.

O’Donnell’s other, non-game show work includes, in addition to his duties on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, the music variety series &quot;Dance Fever&quot;, the talk shows &quot;The Toni Tennille Show&quot; and &quot;America&quot;, and the weekly music countdown series &quot;Solid Gold&quot;.

==Death==
O&#x27;Donnell died at his home in Sherman Oaks, California, of congestive heart failure at the age of 78 on the morning of November 1, 2010. He was survived by his second wife, Ellen Lerner, 4 children and two grandchildren. O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s funeral was held on November 11, 2010, at St. Charles Catholic Church in North Hollywood. O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s body was also cremated, with his ashes given to his family. 

After his death, the show began rotating announcing duties among several guest announcers, including &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; announcer Johnny Gilbert and former &quot;Price Is Right&quot; announcer Rich Fields who voiced some 55 episodes. &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; host Pat Sajak described O&#x27;Donnell as &quot;the perfect voice of the show.&quot; O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s last announced episode aired on October 29, 2010, three days before his death. O&#x27;Donnell was succeeded by veteran L.A. radio announcer Jim Thornton. He can still be heard on Wheel of Fortune slot machines.

The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia posthumously inducted O&#x27;Donnell into their Hall of Fame in 2011.

<text>Dominic James Howard (born 7 December 1977) is an English musician who is the drummer and co-founder of the rock band Muse.

==Early life==
Howard was born in Stockport, Greater Manchester, England. When he was around 8 years old he moved with his family to Teignmouth, a small town in Devon. He began playing drums at about the age of 12, when he was inspired by a jazz band performing at school.

Howard&#x27;s first band was named Carnage Mayhem, which he was in at school. Meanwhile, he befriended Matt Bellamy, who played guitar but did not have a stable band. Not long after, Bellamy was offered the chance to join Howard&#x27;s band. After two years of drop-outs, Bellamy suggested that they write their own songs, and only Howard and Bellamy remained. Chris Wolstenholme, who played drums in Fixed Penalty, then entered the scene and with a great &quot;spirit of sacrifice&quot; he began to play bass. In the first months of 1994 Gothic Plague was born, followed by Rocket Baby Dolls and then finally Muse.

==Muse==

Muse released their debut album, &quot;Showbiz&quot;, in 1999, showcasing Bellamy&#x27;s falsetto and a melancholic alternative rock style. Their second album, &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; (2001), expanded their sound, incorporating wider instrumentation and romantic classical influences, and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances. &quot;Absolution&quot; (2003) saw further classical influence, with orchestra on tracks such as &quot;Butterflies and Hurricanes&quot;, and became the first of five consecutive UK number-one albums.

&quot;Black Holes and Revelations&quot; (2006) incorporated electronic and pop elements, influenced by 1980s groups such as Depeche Mode, displayed in singles such as &quot;Supermassive Black Hole&quot;. The album brought Muse wider international success. &quot;The Resistance&quot; (2009) and &quot;The 2nd Law&quot; (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world&#x27;s major stadium acts. Their seventh album, &quot;Drones&quot; (2015), was a concept album about drone warfare and returned to a harder rock sound.

Muse have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, winning the Grammys for Best Rock Album for &quot;The Resistance&quot; and &quot;Drones&quot;, two Brit Awards, winning Best British Live Act twice, five MTV Europe Music Awards and eight NME Awards. In 2012 the band received the Ivor Novello Award for International Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. Muse have sold over 20 million albums worldwide.

Howard is left-handed and drums on a left-handed drum kit. He also played drums in the supergroup Vicky Cryer, featuring Jason Hill.

==Personal life==
In 2004, Howard&#x27;s father, William Howard, died of a heart attack shortly after watching Muse&#x27;s performance at Glastonbury Festival.

In a session where he and Bellamy answered questions from fans, Howard stated that the celebrity, alive or dead, he&#x27;d most like to meet is Jimi Hendrix. He once had a dog called Hendrix.

On 26 September 2008, Howard, along with Bellamy and Wolstenholme, was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Arts from the University of Plymouth.

<text>Christopher Tony Wolstenholme (born 2 December 1978) is an English musician. He is the bassist and backing vocalist for the rock band Muse. He combines bass guitar with effects and synthesisers to create overdriven fuzz bass tones, a motif of many Muse songs. He sang lead on two songs he wrote from Muse&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;The 2nd Law&quot; (2012), and in 2024 launched a solo project, Chromes.

== Early life ==
Chris Wolstenholme grew up in the English town of Rotherham before moving to Teignmouth, Devon, where he played drums for a post-punk band. He met guitarist Matt Bellamy and drummer Dominic Howard from another band while both bands rehearsed in the same building. Bellamy and Howard convinced Wolstenholme to take up bass and start a new band with them, initially called Rocket Baby Dolls. The band was renamed Muse in 1994.

The members of Muse played in separate school bands during their stay at Teignmouth Community College in the early 1990s. Bellamy successfully auditioned for Howard&#x27;s band, Carnage Mayhem, becoming the singer and songwriter. They asked Wolstenholme, at that time the drummer for the band Fixed Penalty, to join as the bassist; he agreed and took up bass lessons.

== Musicianship ==
Wolstenholme&#x27;s basslines are a central motif of many Muse songs. Rather than simply playing root notes, Wolstenholme&#x27;s basslines often perform a lead role, such as in the 2003 song &quot;Hysteria&quot;. He combines bass guitar with effects and synthesisers to create overdriven fuzz bass tones. Like Bellamy, Wolstenholme uses touch-screen controllers built into his instruments to control synthesisers and effects including Kaoss Pads and Digitech Whammy pedals.

Wolstenholme mostly plays with his fingers, rather than a plectrum, as he prefers the sound for most songs. According to the producer Rich Costey, who has worked with Muse on several occasions, &quot;His finger strength is staggering ... He hits the strings really goddamn hard. It sounds that way because that&#x27;s the way he plays.&quot; Wolstenholme wrote and sang lead vocals on two Muse songs, &quot;Liquid State&quot; and &quot;Save Me&quot;, from their sixth album, &quot;The 2nd Law&quot; (2012).

Wolstenholme played bass on Moriaty&#x27;s 2015 single &quot;Bones&quot;. He also contributed to Rick Parfitt&#x27;s posthumous solo album &quot;Over and Out&quot; (2018). In August 2024, Wolstenholme announced a solo project, Chromes, and released the singles &quot;Imaginary World&quot; and &quot;The Good Life&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Wolstenholme married his girlfriend, Kelly, on 23 December 2003. They have six children. In April 2010, the family moved to Foxrock, County Dublin, Ireland. After Wolstenholme and Kelly divorced, Wolstenholme married Caris Ball on 1 December 2018, the day before his 40th birthday. The couple have a daughter and a son, as well as Ball&#x27;s two previous daughters, giving Wolstenholme ten children in total. Wolstenholme is a supporter of Rotherham United, his hometown football team. He holds an honorary doctorate of arts from the University of Plymouth.

Wolstenholme has struggled with alcoholism. In a 2011 interview, he said he would drink so much he would vomit blood, but did not grasp the severity of his situation. His bandmates did not notice his problem for several years; according to Bellamy, &quot;He&#x27;s such a good musician that his motor skills or something just aren&#x27;t affected. So he would come in and play brilliantly and then we wouldn&#x27;t see him for a bit. We&#x27;d have a great gig and he&#x27;d go off to his room so we wouldn&#x27;t really know what was going on.&quot; His bandmates broached the subject of his drinking several times without success. 

During 2008, Wolstenholme began having panic attacks triggered by his drinking. He eventually realised that drinking would kill him, as it had his father. His alcoholism did not affect his playing until the recording of Muse&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;The Resistance&quot; (2009), at which point he went into rehab. He wrote two songs about his experience, &quot;Liquid State&quot; and &quot;Save Me&quot;, on Muse&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;The 2nd Law&quot; (2012). In 2012, Wolstenholme said: &quot;I threw myself into music in a way I hadn&#x27;t done for 10 years. It sounds corny but it was the only thing that made me feel peaceful.&quot;

<text>Montefalco is a historic small hill town in Umbria, Italy, with a population of 5,581 in August 2017. It has been settled since pre-Roman times, and retains many of its historic buildings. From 1446 to 1861 it was part of the Papal States. It is one of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;). 

Montefalco DOC is a regulated geographical area due to its red grape wine production, including the highly localized Sagrantino grape variety. The town&#x27;s museum is in a former church, which has a fresco cycle on the life of St. Francis by the Florentine artist Benozzo Gozzoli (1450–1452).

==History==
The town has been continuously inhabited since the times of the Umbri. It has been under the successive rule of the Romans, followed by the Lombards, being called Coccorone in the Middle Ages. In 1249 it was sacked by Frederick II, but was quickly rebuilt, and began being known by its modern name. Since the 13th century it had been a free &quot;comune &quot;under the rule of local nobles and merchants, but later, as with many other Umbrian locales, the comune gave way to government by a &quot;Signoria&quot; — in this case, that of the Trinci from the nearby Foligno (1383–1439). In 1446 it fell under the rule of the Papal States where it remained until the unification of Italy in 1861.

St. Clare of Montefalco, sometimes known as St. Clare of the Cross, was born in Montefalco and died there in 1308.

==Monuments and sites of interest==
=== Religious architecture or sites ===
Montefalco today has several churches in Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance styles.
*&quot;San Francesco&quot;: now the town&#x27;s museum, and an important museum in Umbria. The church is notable for its fresco cycle on the life of St. Francis, by the Florentine artist Benozzo Gozzoli (1450–1452). Other artists represented in the museum include Perugino, Francesco Melanzio, Pier Antonio Mezzastris, Antoniazzo Romano and Tiberio d&#x27;Assisi.
*&quot;Sant&#x27;Agostino&quot;
*&quot;Santa Chiara&quot;: sanctuary built in 1615, it rises adjacent to the Franciscan monastery linked to this local saint, and now includes the &quot;Chapel of the Holy Cross&quot;, the apse of the former &quot;Chiesa di Santa Croce&quot; with 14th century frescoes on the life of Chiara of Montefalco
*&quot;Santa Illuminata&quot;
*&quot;&quot;: built in the 4th century over the tomb of Fortunatus of Spoleto and renovated in the 15th century. It has frescoes by Gozzoli and Tiberio d&#x27;Assisi.

=== Secular architecture or sites ===
The 13th century &quot;Palazzo Comunale&quot; (&quot;Town Hall&quot;) has a mullioned window from the original edifice and a 15th-century portal. Also notable are the gates in the walls, including &quot;Porta Sant&#x27;Agostino&quot;, &quot;Porta Camiano&quot; and &quot;Porta Federico II&quot;.

==Wine==
The comune of Montefalco and a small area of the comune of Bevagna constitute the regulated geographical area for Montefalco wines. Every year around Easter, the town sponsors a major festival called Settimana Enologica — or Wine Week — where visitors can enjoy the principal wines produced in the area including the comparatively simple red table wine, Montefalco Rosso, the more complex DOCG red wines Sagrantino, for which the area is famous, and the Montefalco Sagrantino secco.
