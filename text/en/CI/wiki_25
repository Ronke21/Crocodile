<text>is a Japanese manga artist and writer, known for specializing in fighting manga featuring bishōnen and magical boys.

He is the founder of the manga studio Kurumada Productions or Kurumadapro for short. He achieved fame as the creator of popular manga, such as &quot;Ring ni Kakero&quot;, &quot;Fūma no Kojirō&quot;, &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; and &quot;B&#x27;t X&quot;. The male characters in his works often display very masculine qualities and traits, and display courage through sacrifice, selflessness and true heroism. He has won the Best Success award with &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; and the Best Inspiration award with &quot;Ring ni Kakero&quot;.

==Profile==
Kurumada&#x27;s first work was &quot;Otoko Raku&quot; , which earned him an award in a manga contest for aspiring manga artist, and became assistant to professional manga artists. Some time later, he debuted as a professional manga artist in 1974 with his manga &quot;Sukeban Arashi&quot;, and achieved his first hit three years later when he started writing and drawing &quot;Ring ni Kakero&quot;, which brought him recognition as a popular manga author, and lasted five years, and he considers it his favorite creation. A practicer of the martial arts in his younger days, the influence this has exerted on his various works is worthy of mention.

Also, in the same manner as many manga artists today, Kurumada employs the revered Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s Star System manga technique, which is essentially resorting to the use of a stable cast of characters in his various works (characters keep the same appearance and personality, but sometimes the author gives them new names and different roles than in previous works). Because of this, the main characters of his works most of the time bear a resemblance to Takane Ryūji, the protagonist of &quot;Ring ni Kakero&quot;. The main characters of his subsequent works have almost the same appearance and personality of Ryūji, specifically Jingi Kikukawa (&quot;Otoko Zaka&quot;), Kojirō (&quot;Fūma no Kojirō&quot;), Seiya (&quot;Saint Seiya&quot;), Teppei Takamiya (&quot;B&#x27;t X&quot;), Shō (&quot;Silent Knight Shō&quot;), Aoi Tendō (&quot;Aoi Tori no Shinwa&quot;), Rindō Kenzaki (&quot;Ring ni Kakero 2&quot;), among others.

Besides Kurumada, other renowned manga artists that resort to the master Tezuka&#x27;s technique include legendary authors Leiji Matsumoto, Monkey Punch and Shōtarō Ishinomori or Clamp. Clamp was heavily influenced by Kurumada&#x27;s works, and they began their career as manga authors creating doujinshi based on Kurumada&#x27;s characters. It is also known that anime adaptations aren&#x27;t much to his liking, he prefers manga. He agreed that his works &quot;Fūma no Kojirō&quot;, &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;, &quot;Ring ni Kakero&quot; and &quot;B&#x27;t X&quot; were adapted to anime, to follow the long-time tradition of popular manga having an animated adaptation.

His drawing style is very classic, reminiscent from the manga/anime aesthetics more predominant in the 1960s and 1970s, albeit a constant flaw in his art is an inconsistent trace and proportion unbalance. He often draws his characters as if seen from a low perspective. His drawings can sometimes seem rough, but the improvement in his artistic technique is evident when comparing older works to more recent ones. His coloring style is almost exclusively realistic, unlike the vast majority of manga artists, who often resort to the use of non-natural colors for the hair or eyes of their characters, although with the publication of &quot;Saint Seiya Next Dimension&quot; volumes totally in color, the addition of new characters with non-natural hair colors occurs often.

Certain graphics elements characteristic of his style can be found all over his works, mostly during fight sequences, having become widely known. Fans have created terms to refer to them such as , meaning &quot;Kurumada Fall&quot;, which designates the typical head-first falling characters, and , meaning &quot;Kurumada Launch&quot;, which refers to characters that are projected high into the air by opponents, to name a few.

Recurrent themes in his works are friendship, courage, redemption and sacrifice. Masculine virtue and qualities, honesty and honor are also traits often found in his characters. Female characters in his works mostly play a much lesser role, but several ones with key roles can also be found, such as Rei Kojinyama (&quot;Sukeban Arashi&quot;), Kiku Takane (&quot;Ring ni Kakero&quot;) and Saori Kido (&quot;Saint Seiya&quot;).

Kurumada has stated in interviews that he obtains some creative influence from yesterday&#x27;s authors considered masters of the manga medium today, such as Hiroshi Motomiya, Sanpei Shirato and Mitsuteru Yokoyama. He specially considers that Motomiya&#x27;s works had a very strong impact and influence on him.

Kurumada also draws inspiration from universal knowledge and folklore, such as Greek mythology, Japanese and Chinese mythology, Buddhist and Hinduist doctrine, Trascendental philosophies, and classic works of literature, such as Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, and &quot;Outlaws of the Marsh&quot;, to name a few.

His interest in boxing, wrestling and martial arts is well known, and he maintains close relations with renowned personalities of those circles. As he states in his website, he likes to drink with friends and to practice photography while jogging.

Among his works that have been cancelled due to failing to attract fans: &quot;Otoko Zaka, Silent Knight Shō&quot; and &quot;Aoi Tori no Shinwa&quot;. His works that suffered popularity decrease: &quot;B&#x27;t X&quot; (which he successfully concluded without facing cancellation), and &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;. In &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;″s case, Kurumada was forced by Shueisha, his publisher, to finish the manga after the Hades Arc, in 1991. He put his manga in hiatus after he finished the mentioned arc, and resumed it in 2006 with &quot;Saint Seiya Next Dimension&quot;. The anime adaptation of &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; experienced a popularity decrease during the anime-only &quot;Asgard&quot; arc, while the popularity of the original manga was still strong; the anime back in 1989, was in pre-production of the episodes that would adapt the Hades arc of the manga. Because of low popularity of the anime adaptation, the project was suspended and remained so until 2003, when it was resumed and the Hades arc of the manga finally was adapted to animation. The episodes that adapted the two final volumes of the manga were aired in between May and August 2008, finally leaving Kurumada&#x27;s manga completely adapted to anime.

In 2004, Kurumada celebrated 30 years as a professional manga artist, and that same year two of his older and best known works experienced a resurfacing. The original &quot;Ring ni Kakero&quot; was adapted to anime, 27 years after its manga debut, and as mentioned before, the &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; anime adaptation was resumed in 2003 and an attempt to start the Zeus Chapter was made with the release of the &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; &quot;Tenkai-Hen Josō ~Overture~&quot; movie in 2004, which was planned to continue the story with the subsequent release of OVAs, but due to discrepancies between Kurumada and Toei Animation, the project failed and was abandoned. Kurumada still plans to publish the &quot;Zeus Chapter&quot;, written and drawn by him, in manga form in the near future, by 2012, a considerable amount of elements from it have already been revealed by Kurumada in &quot;Saint Seiya Next Dimension&quot; and he is set to continue doing so in the next instalments of that work in the japanese summer in 2013.

Kurumada&#x27;s works have had influence on manga authors and related media. Worthy of mention is Yudetamago&#x27;s &quot;Kinnikuman&quot;, Hiroshi Kawamoto&#x27;s Tenkū Senki Shurato, Clamp&#x27;s &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;, Kōichi Tokita&#x27;s &quot;Mobile Fighter G Gundam&quot;, Hajime Yatate and Ryuichi Hoshino&#x27;s &quot;Yoroiden Samurai Troopers&quot;, Yoshihiro Togashi&#x27;s &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;, videogames such as the &quot;World Heroes&quot; series and The King of Fighters series, among others. References to his works by other authors can be found in the mentioned videogames and in popular manga, such as Kōsuke Fujishima&#x27;s Aa! Megami-sama, Kenjirō Hata&#x27;s Hayate no Gotoku, Chika Umino&#x27;s Honey &amp; Clover, Tite Kubo&#x27;s BLEACH, and their respective anime adaptations, among others.

French director Louis Leterrier has cited Kurumada and his manga &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; having a great impact on him since his youth. In 2010, Masami Kurumada was contacted by Warner Brothers to collaborate in a project for Leterrier&#x27;s mythologically themed motion picture &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;, remake of the original 1981 film. Kurumada authored promotional illustrations depicting pivotal scenes from the film.
Countless are the products of merchandise(action figures, T-shirts, toys, video games, ect) relative the works of Kurumada, sold all over the worlds with great success. His fans are usually referred to as &quot;Masamists&quot;.

Out of all of them, &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; is his most famous work in the western world but not in Japan, its popularity there is surpassed by that of &quot;Ring ni Kakero&quot; (1 and 2), which is the longest of Kurumada&#x27;s works, at 51 collected volumes. &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;, is collected in 28 volumes to date, and has been resumed by Kurumada with &quot;Saint Seiya Next Dimension&quot;, the continuation to his original manga, ending the hiatus the work remained in since 1991, and to date adds thirteen more volumes to the original &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; manga, for a total or 41 volumes. The third longest is &quot;B&#x27;t X&quot;, collected in 16. As stated before, Anime adaptations have been made for &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;, &quot;Fūma no Kojirō&quot;, &quot;B&#x27;t X&quot;, and &quot;Ring ni Kakero&quot;, all closely follow his source manga works.

&quot;Saint Seiya&quot; videogames have been released for old consoles such as Famicom/NES, Game Boy and more recently various video games for PlayStation 2(2006-2008) and for PlayStation 3(2011), and a &quot;Saint Seiya Omega&quot; game for PSP was released in December 2012, and &quot;Saint Seiya: Brave Soldiers&quot; released in 2013 for PlayStation 3 and &quot;Saint Seiya: Soldiers&#x27; Soul&quot; released in 2015 for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 and PC.

Saint Seiya Myth Cloth is a successful line of figures that started in 2003 and is still in production based on the many characters of the original &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; by Kurumada.

Currently, Kurumada working on &quot;Saint Seiya Next Dimension&quot; (a prequel and continuation to his classic manga series in which Hades recalls his fight with the previous Pegasus Saint in the 18th century). It was revealed by Kurumada and Akita Shōten that &quot;Saint Seiya Next Dimension&quot; holds a canonical status in the universe of &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;, and it is also its legitimate continuation. He recently finished &quot;Ring ni Kakero 2&quot;, in 2009, after a successful run of 9 years. A live-action series of &quot;Fūma no Kojirō&quot; was released on Japanese TV. He recently started working on a new manga series &quot;Raimei-ni Kike&quot;.

Since these two works are not authored by Kurumada, but only authorized and supervised by him, the events depicted in them and the characters created for them are still considered non-canonical, unlike &quot;Next Dimension&quot; which holds an official canonical status.

Kurumada had most of his works published by Shueisha, in the prestigious &quot;Shūkan Shōnen Jump&quot; manga magazine. He began publishing his works with Kadokawa Shoten, in their magazine &quot;Gekkan Shōnen Ace&quot;. In 1995 he resumed his relations with Shueisha and began publishing with them again, and his latest works and the current ones have been published by that company to date, excluding &quot;Saint Seiya Lost Canvas&quot;, published by Akita Shoten in the &quot;Weekly Shōnen Champion&quot; manga magazine, &quot;Saint Seiya Next Dimension&quot;, published in the &quot;Shōnen Ace&quot; manga magazine and &quot;Raimei-ni Kike&quot;, published by Akita Shoten in the &quot;Champion Red&quot; manga magazine.

In 2012, Kurumada revealed the upcoming anime television series, &quot;Saint Seiya Omega&quot;. Described as an anime original story, separate from Kurumada&#x27;s canon, the series will take place 25 years after the events in Kurumada&#x27;s &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; manga. The series began airing in April that year, and has been renewed for a second season that started in April 2013.

In 2014 Masami Kurumada was the executive producer of a CGI remake of the &quot;Sanctuary&quot; chapter called &quot;Saint Seiya: Legend of Sanctuary&quot;.

<doc id="1051925" wikidata="Q7744794" url="?curid=1051925" title="The Kiwi Party">
<text>The Kiwi Party was a political party operating in New Zealand between 2007 and 2011. Briefly known as Future New Zealand, it was a breakaway from the United Future New Zealand party and sought to carry on the tradition of Future New Zealand. The party was formed when MP Gordon Copeland left United Future after a dispute over support for the Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. At the 2008 general election, the Kiwi Party was unsuccessful, and was not re-elected to Parliament. It did not contest the 2011 general election under its own banner, but the leaders and other members stood for the Conservative Party.

The party advocated more direct democracy through referendums and a return to the &quot;Judeo-Christian ethic in democracy&quot;. On 8 February 2012, it requested that the Electoral Commission cancel its registration, which rendered it wholly subsumed into the Conservative Party. On its website, it announced that after holding an executive committee meeting in December 2011, the party had agreed to be &#x27;wound up&#x27; and &#x27;bring its existence to an end.&#x27;

==Future New Zealand Party reformed==

On 16 May 2007, list MP Gordon Copeland resigned from the United Future party, citing differences with party leader Peter Dunne over the latter&#x27;s support of the child-discipline bill. Copeland announced his intention to re-form an independent Future New Zealand party with former United Future list MP Larry Baldock as co-leader. Copeland and Baldock acknowledged that the new party would face difficulties over issues like legal ownership of the party name, but were hopeful that they would be able to attract United Future&#x27;s former conservative Christian voters. An inaugural meeting was held in Baldock&#x27;s city of residence, Tauranga, and former United Future list MP Bernie Ogilvy became party secretary. Meanwhile, Brian Tamaki and his Destiny New Zealand party announced that it would contest the New Zealand conservative Christian vote at the next New Zealand general election in 2008.
On 14 June 2007 Copeland announced that Future New Zealand would &quot;not work with, or be part of, a Labour-led government following the 2008 elections&quot;. Copeland also gave his proxy vote in Parliament to the National Party (except on matters of confidence and supply).

In June 2007, Copeland announced in his monthly &quot;Copeland&#x27;s Chronicle&quot; newsletter that Future New Zealand had attracted the necessary five hundred members required for registration under the Electoral Act 1993. Baldock and Copeland were working on establishing a Board of Management and Board of Reference for their new party, still tentatively named &quot;Future New Zealand.&quot; He also asserted his right to continue sitting in New Zealand&#x27;s Parliament as a list MP.

==Name change to the Kiwi Party==

On 25 January 2008, it was announced that Future New Zealand was to be known as the Kiwi Party. Copeland stepped down as co-leader to focus on his Parliamentary responsibilities, leaving Baldock as the sole leader. The party applied to the Electoral Commission to register its new name, and was registered on 15 February 2008.

===Policies===
At the party&#x27;s South Island conference in Christchurch the party outlined a number of policy ideas:

* people should be able to direct $100 of their income tax to a charity of their choice each year
* lift the adult minimum wage from the expected $12 an hour to $15 an hour
* provide employers with a 100% tax rebate to cover the minimum wage increase
* establish a Royal Commission to investigate the causes of family breakdown, family violence and child abuse.

== 2008 election ==
Going into the 2008 elections, the party had only one list MP, and no electorate MPs, in Parliament, and did not register significant support in national polls. Acting secretary Bernie Ogilvy apologised for not applying for free election broadcasting in time; Larry Baldock said &quot;This does make our task just that much harder.&quot; The party fielded 25 electorate candidates out of a possible 70.

The party won just 12,755 party votes, or 0.54% of the votes cast, well short of the 5% required to gain list-only representation without winning an electorate. Baldock stood in Tauranga, winning 1893 votes, well behind National&#x27;s Simon Bridges and his New Zealand First and Labour challengers. Copeland was similarly unsuccessful in Rongotai, winning just 515 votes. Despite this result, the party stated that they would contest the next general election, in 2011.

==2008–2012==
Gordon Copeland was elected as Party President in March 2009. The party contested the 2009 Mount Albert by-election, selecting Simmone Dyer as their candidate. Dyer came seventh with 91 votes. The party did not contest the subsequent Mana, Botany or Te Tai Tokerau by-elections.

Larry Baldock was one of the chief protagonists behind the 2009 referendum which attempted to repeal the Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The referendum passed with the support of 87.4% of voters, but was non-binding, and the government responded by promising a review of the law. In response, Baldock circulated a second citizens initiated referendum, calling for binding citizens initiated referendums in future debates. The proposed referendum petition fell well short of the required number of signatures to trigger such a referendum and lapsed on 10 December 2010.

The demise of the Family Party and New Zealand Pacific Party in 2010 left the Kiwi Party as the only conservative Christian-based political party within New Zealand politics. This was changed by the arrival of Colin Craig&#x27;s Conservative Party of New Zealand in August 2011.

On 14 October 2011 the Kiwi Party announced that it would not be standing any candidates in the election, and that several members had joined the Conservative Party and would be standing for it. Party leader Baldock was number three on the Conservative Party list and stood again in Tauranga. Deputy leader Dyer was number 7 on the list and stood in East Coast Bays. Party president Copeland stood in Hutt South. No candidate was successful. Other members also stood for the Conservatives on their party list.

The party was deregistered at its own request on 8 February 2012, which marks the cessation of its independent political existence. Its former website URL is now also inoperative.

<text>Jules Germain Francois Maisonneuve (10 December 1809 – 9 April 1897) was a French surgeon and student of Guillaume Dupuytren. Maisonneuve is notable as the first surgeon to explain the role of external rotation in the production of ankle fractures. The eponymously named Maisonneuve fracture describes a specific fibular fracture.

<text>Murray John Elston (born October 8, 1949) is a former politician in Ontario Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1981 to 1994 who represented the central Ontario ridings of Huron—Bruce and Bruce. He was a senior cabinet minister in the government of David Peterson. He briefly served as interim leader of the Liberal Party from July to November 1991.

==Background==
Elston was educated at the University of Western Ontario, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree and a law degree. He practised law, working for the firm of Crawford, Mill Davies &amp; Elston.

==Politics==
Elston was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1981 provincial election defeating Progressive Conservative Gary Harron by 224 votes in the rural, southwestern constituency of Huron—Bruce. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government under Bill Davis in this election, and Elston sat on the opposition benches for the next four years.

He was re-elected in the 1985 election. After the Miller government failed on a vote of no confidence, The Liberals formed a minority government with the support of the New Democratic Party and Elston was appointed to the high-profile position of Minister of Health. In this role, he was at the centre of the government&#x27;s fight against extra-billing by doctors, an issue the government won after withstanding the province&#x27;s first doctors&#x27; strike. Elston also announced subsidies for residents of Northern Ontario who needed to travel south for medical care.

The Liberals were re-elected with a landslide majority in the 1987 provincial election, and Elston was returned by a significant majority in the redistributed riding of Bruce. In the cabinet shuffle that followed on September 29, 1987, Elston was appointed Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet. He was also appointed Minister of Financial Institutions on August 16, 1988.

In the 1990 Ontario election, the Liberals were defeated by the New Democratic Party under Bob Rae. Many high-profile Liberals lost their seats, though Elston was returned in Bruce by a comfortable if reduced margin. Peterson, who had lost his own seat on election night, resigned immediately as party leader.

===Cabinet positions===

 
===Interim leader and convention===
The Liberals initially chose Robert Nixon as their interim leader, but he resigned on July 31, 1991, to accept a federal appointment. Elston was then chosen as interim leader in Nixon&#x27;s place, though his time in this position was brief. He declared himself a candidate in the race to become the party&#x27;s permanent leader, and accordingly resigned as interim leader on November 19, 1991. Jim Bradley took his place until the leadership convention.

Elston quickly became the favourite to win the 1992 race, gaining endorsements from such high-profile figures as Peterson, Ian Scott, and Sheila Copps. He led voting for the first four ballots, but lost to Lyn McLeod on the fifth and final ballot by only nine votes. The number of spoiled ballots from supporters of third-place candidate Greg Sorbara was greater than McLeod&#x27;s margin of victory. Some political observers speculated that Elston appeared too much like a holdover from the Peterson era, at a time when the Liberal Party wanted to present a new image to voters.

===Opposition===
Elston remained in the legislature for two more years, and served as Opposition House Leader before resigning as an MPP on October 31, 1994, to enter the private sector. He was touted as McLeod&#x27;s likely replacement when she resigned as Liberal leader following a poor performance in the 1995 provincial election but he declined to enter the race preferring to remain out of politics. In 1996, he was the most prominent supporter of Dalton McGuinty&#x27;s ultimately successful bid to win the party&#x27;s leadership.

==After politics==
From November 1994 until 1997, Elston was president of the Ontario Interlink Industrial Park. From January to October 1998, he worked for Engergreen Solutions Group. In November 1998, Elston was appointed president of Canada&#x27;s Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies (Rx&amp;D).

From 2004 to 2009, Elston was president of the Canadian Nuclear Association, in order to lobby the Premier&#x27;s office on behalf of the nuclear industry. As a former Liberal MPP, he had represented the riding of Huron-Bruce, which is home to the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station. Elston&#x27;s lobbying was highly successful: on June 13, 2006, the McGuinty government announced its commitment to rebuild all of Ontario&#x27;s ageing nuclear stations as well as the construction of new reactors. He served as vice-president of corporate affairs for Bruce Power from 2009 until 2011.

<doc id="1051942" wikidata="Q5510283" url="?curid=1051942" title="Fusion tree">
<text>In computer science, a fusion tree is a type of tree data structure that implements an associative array on -bit integers on a finite universe, where each of the input integers has size less than 2w and is non-negative. When operating on a collection of key–value pairs, it uses space and performs searches in time, which is asymptotically faster than a traditional self-balancing binary search tree, and also better than the van Emde Boas tree for large values of . It achieves this speed by using certain constant-time operations that can be done on a machine word. Fusion trees were invented in 1990 by Michael Fredman and Dan Willard.

Several advances have been made since Fredman and Willard&#x27;s original 1990 paper. In 1999 it was shown how to implement fusion trees under a model of computation in which all of the underlying operations of the algorithm belong to AC0, a model of circuit complexity that allows addition and bitwise Boolean operations but does not allow the multiplication operations used in the original fusion tree algorithm. A dynamic version of fusion trees using hash tables was proposed in 1996 which matched the original structure&#x27;s runtime in expectation. Another dynamic version using exponential tree was proposed in 2007 which yields worst-case runtimes of per operation. Finally, it was shown that dynamic fusion trees can perform each operation in time deterministically.

This data structure implements add key, remove key, search key, and predecessor (next smaller value) and successor (next larger value) search operations for a given key. The partial result of most significant bit locator in constant time has also helped further research. Fusion trees utilize word-level parallelism to be efficient, performing computation on several small integers, stored in a single machine word, simultaneously to reduce the number of total operations.

== How it works ==
A fusion tree is essentially a B-tree with branching factor of (any small exponent is also possible as it will not have a great impact on the height of the tree), which gives it a height of . To achieve the desired runtimes for updates and queries, the fusion tree must be able to search a node containing up to keys in constant time. This is done by compressing (&quot;sketching&quot;) the keys so that all can fit into one machine word, which in turn allows comparisons to be done in parallel. So, a series of computations involving sketching, parallel comparison and most significant bit index locator, help reach the required solution.

===Sketching===
Sketching is the method by which each -bit key at a node containing keys is compressed into only bits. Each key may be thought of as a path in the full binary tree of height starting at the root and ending at the leaf corresponding to . This path can be processed by recursively searching the left child of &quot;i&quot; if the &quot;ith&quot; bit is 0, and the right child if it is 1, generally, until all bits are scanned. To distinguish two paths, it suffices to look at their branching point (the first bit where any two keys differ). As there are a maximum of &quot;k&quot; keys, there will not be more than &quot;k-1&quot; branching points, which means that no more than &quot;k-1&quot; bits are required to identify a key. And hence, no sketch will have more than &quot;k-1&quot; bits.

An important property of the sketch function is that it preserves the order of the keys. That is, for any two keys . So, for the entire range of keys, sketch(x0)&lt;sketch(x1)&lt;...&lt;sketch(xk-1) because if the binary-tree-like path is followed, the nodes will be ordered in such a manner that x0&lt;x1&lt;...&lt;xk-1.

===Approximating the sketch===
If the locations of the sketch bits are &quot;b&quot;1 &lt; &quot;b&quot;2 &lt; ⋅⋅⋅ &lt; &quot;b&quot;&quot;r&quot;, then the sketch of the key &quot;x&quot;&quot;w&quot;-1⋅⋅⋅&quot;x&quot;1&quot;x&quot;0 is the &quot;r&quot;-bit integer formula_1.

With only standard word operations, such as those of the C programming language, it is difficult to directly compute the perfect sketch of a key in constant time. Instead, the sketch bits can be packed into a range of size at most &quot;r&quot;4, using bitwise AND and multiplication, called the approximate sketch, which does have all the important bits but also some additional useless bits spread out in a predictable pattern. The bitwise AND operation serves as a mask to remove all these non-sketch bits from the key, while the multiplication shifts the sketch bits into a small range. Like the &quot;perfect&quot; sketch, the approximate sketch also preserves the order of the keys and means that sketch(x0)&lt;sketch(x1)&lt;...&lt;sketch(xk-1).

Some preprocessing is needed to determine the correct multiplication constant. Each sketch bit in location &quot;b&quot;&quot;i&quot; will get shifted to &quot;b&quot;&quot;i&quot; + &quot;m&quot;&quot;i&quot; via a multiplication by &quot;m&quot; = formula_2 2&quot;m&quot;&quot;i&quot;. For the approximate sketch to work, the following three properties must hold:

# &quot;b&quot;&quot;i&quot; + &quot;m&quot;&quot;j&quot; are distinct for all pairs (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;). This will ensure that the sketch bits are uncorrupted by the multiplication.
# &quot;b&quot;&quot;i&quot; + &quot;m&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a strictly increasing function of &quot;i&quot;. That is, the order of the sketch bits is preserved even in x&#x27;.m.
# (&quot;b&quot;&quot;r&quot; + &quot;m&quot;&quot;r&quot;) - (&quot;b&quot;1 + &quot;m&quot;1) ≤ &quot;r&quot;4. That is, the sketch bits are packed into a range of size at most &quot;r&quot;4, where r ≤ O(w1/5).

An inductive argument shows how the &quot;m&quot;&quot;i&quot; can be constructed. Let &quot;m&quot;1 = &quot;w&quot; − &quot;b&quot;1. Suppose that 1 &lt; &quot;t&quot; ≤ &quot;r&quot; and that &quot;m&quot;1, &quot;m&quot;2... &quot;m&quot;&quot;t-1&quot; have already been chosen. Then pick the smallest integer &quot;m&quot;&quot;t&quot; such that both properties (1) and (2) are satisfied. Property (1) requires that &quot;m&quot;&quot;t&quot; ≠ &quot;b&quot;&quot;i&quot; − &quot;b&quot;&quot;j&quot; + &quot;m&quot;&quot;l&quot; for all 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot; ≤ &quot;r&quot; and 1 ≤ &quot;l&quot; ≤ &quot;t&quot;-1. Thus, there are less than &quot;tr&quot;2 ≤ &quot;r&quot;3 values that &quot;m&quot;&quot;t&quot; must avoid. Since &quot;m&quot;&quot;t&quot; is chosen to be minimal, (&quot;b&quot;&quot;t&quot; + &quot;m&quot;&quot;t&quot;) ≤ (&quot;b&quot;&quot;t&quot;-1 + &quot;m&quot;&quot;t&quot;-1) + &quot;r&quot;3. This implies Property (3).

The approximate sketch is thus computed as follows:
# Mask out all but the sketch bits with a bitwise AND between &quot;x&quot; and formula_3.
# Multiply the key by the predetermined constant &quot;m&quot; as calculated above. This operation actually requires two machine words, but this can still be done in constant time.
# Mask out all but the shifted sketch bits. These are now contained in a contiguous block of at most &quot;r&quot;4 &lt; &quot;w&quot;4/5 bits.

===Parallel comparison===
The purpose of the compression achieved by sketching is to allow all of the keys to be stored in one &quot;w&quot;-bit word. Let the &quot;node sketch&quot; of a node be the bit string

:1codice_1(&quot;x&quot;1)1codice_1(&quot;x&quot;2)...1codice_1(&quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;)

Here, all sketch words are clubbed together in one string by prepending a set bit to each of them. We can assume that the sketch function uses exactly &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;r&quot;4 bits. Then each block uses 1 + &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;w&quot;4/5 bits, and since &quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;w&quot;1/5, the total number of bits in the node sketch is at most &quot;w&quot;.

A brief notational aside: for a bit string &quot;s&quot; and nonnegative integer &quot;m&quot;, let &quot;s&quot;&quot;m&quot; denote the concatenation of &quot;s&quot; to itself &quot;m&quot; times. If &quot;t&quot; is also a bit string, &quot;st&quot; denotes the concatenation of &quot;t&quot; to &quot;s&quot;.

The node sketch makes it possible to search the keys for any &quot;b&quot;-bit integer &quot;y&quot;. Let &quot;z&quot; = (0&quot;y&quot;)&quot;k&quot;, which can be computed in constant time (multiply &quot;y&quot; by the constant (0&quot;b&quot;1)&quot;k&quot;), to make it as long as the node sketch such that each word in the node sketch can be compared with the query integer &quot;y&quot; in one operation, demonstrating word-level parallelism. If &quot;y&quot; were 5 bits long, it would be multiplied by 000001...000001 to get sketch(y)k. The difference between sketch(xi) and 0y results in the leading bit for each block to be 1, if and only if sketch(y) formula_4 sketch(xi). We can thus compute the smallest index &quot;i&quot; such that codice_1(&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;) ≥ &quot;y&quot; as follows:

# Subtract &quot;z&quot; from the node sketch.
# Take the bitwise AND of the difference and the constant (10&quot;b&quot;)&quot;k&quot;. This clears all but the leading bit of each block.
# Find the most significant bit of the result, to identify the exact index of transition from elements with sketch smaller than the query sketch to those greater than the query sketch.
# Compute &quot;i,&quot; the rank of the sketch, using the fact that the leading bit of the &quot;i&quot;-th block has index &quot;i&quot;(&quot;b&quot;+1).

===Desketching===
For an arbitrary query &quot;q&quot;, parallel comparison computes the index &quot;i&quot; such that
:codice_1(&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;-1) ≤ codice_1(&quot;q&quot;) ≤ codice_1(&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;)
Unfortunately, this does give the exact predecessor or successor of &quot;q&quot;, because the location of the sketch of &quot;q&quot; among the sketches of all the values may not be the same as the location of &quot;q&quot; in all the actual values. What is true is that, among all of the keys, either &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;-1 or &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; has the longest common prefix with &quot;q&quot;. This is because any key &quot;y&quot; with a longer common prefix with &quot;q&quot; would also have more sketch bits in common with &quot;q&quot;, and thus codice_1(&quot;y&quot;) would be closer to codice_1(&quot;q&quot;) than any codice_1(&quot;x&quot;&quot;j&quot;).

The length longest common prefix between two &quot;w&quot;-bit integers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; can be computed in constant time by finding the most significant bit of the bitwise XOR between &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. This can then be used to mask out all but the longest common prefix.

Note that &quot;p&quot; identifies exactly where &quot;q&quot; branches off from the set of keys. If the next bit of &quot;q&quot; is 0, then the successor of &quot;q&quot; is contained in the &quot;p&quot;1 subtree, and if the next bit of &quot;q&quot; is 1, then the predecessor of &quot;q&quot; is contained in the &quot;p&quot;0 subtree. This suggests the following algorithm for determining the exact location of &quot;q&quot;:

# Use parallel comparison to find the index &quot;i&quot; such that codice_1(&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;-1) ≤ codice_1(&quot;q&quot;) ≤ codice_1(&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;).
# Compute the longest common prefix &quot;p&quot; of &quot;q&quot; and either &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;-1 or &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; (taking the longer of the two).
# Let &quot;l&quot;-1 be the length of the longest common prefix &quot;p&quot;.
## If the &quot;l&quot;-th bit of &quot;q&quot; is 0, let &quot;e&quot; = &quot;p&quot;10&quot;w&quot;-&quot;l&quot;. Use parallel comparison to search for the successor of codice_1(&quot;e&quot;). This is the actual predecessor of &quot;q&quot;.
## If the &quot;l&quot;-th bit of &quot;q&quot; is 1, let &quot;e&quot; = &quot;p&quot;01&quot;w&quot;-&quot;l&quot;. Use parallel comparison to search for the predecessor of codice_1(&quot;e&quot;). This is the actual successor of &quot;q&quot;.
# Once either the predecessor or successor of &quot;q&quot; is found, the exact position of &quot;q&quot; among the set of keys is determined.

==Fusion hashing==
An application of fusion trees to hash tables was given by Willard, who describes a data structure for hashing in which an outer-level hash table with hash chaining is combined with a fusion tree representing each hash chain.
In hash chaining, in a hash table with a constant load factor, the average size of a chain is constant, but additionally with high probability all chains have size , where is the number of hashed items.
This chain size is small enough that a fusion tree can handle searches and updates within it in constant time per operation. Therefore, the time for all operations in the data structure is constant with high probability.
More precisely, with this data structure, for every inverse-quasipolynomial probability , there is a constant such that the probability that there exists an operation that exceeds time is at most .

==Computational Model and Necessary Assumptions==
The computational model for the Fusion Tree algorithm is a Word RAM with a specific instruction set, including arithmetic instructions - addition, subtraction and multiplication (all performed
modulo ) and Boolean operations - bitwise AND, NOT etc. A double-precision multiplication instruction is also included. It has been shown that removal of the latter instruction makes it impossible to sort faster than , unless it is permitted to use memory space of nearly words (in contrast to linear space used by Fusion Trees), or include other instructions instead.

<text>Sacrament meeting is the primary weekly Sunday worship service in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

Sacrament meetings are held in the chapel of a meetinghouse by each individual ward (or branch). The service is presided over by the congregation&#x27;s bishop (or branch president), unless a higher authority is present, such as the stake president or a general authority. Anyone is invited to attend, whether they are a member of the church or not. Sacrament meeting does not occur on the weeks when stake or district conferences, or the church&#x27;s general conference are held.

Those attending sacrament meeting generally wear &quot;Sunday formal&quot; dress. Men wear suits and ties, and women wear modest dresses or skirts. Children are also encouraged to attend.

==History==
The first occurrence of a similar gathering to the current sacrament meeting occurred on April 6, 1830. This coincided with the organization of the Church of Christ, the forerunner of the LDS Church. This meeting included the administration of the Lord&#x27;s Supper and the ordination of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery as the &quot;First Elder&quot; and &quot;Second Elder&quot; of the church.

For much of the history of the church, sacrament meeting was held separately from other church meetings, often held on weekdays or on Sunday mornings. Sacrament meeting was the last meeting of the day on Sunday. In 1980, the church&#x27;s First Presidency started the current &quot;block&quot; schedule, in which almost all church meetings were held in the space of three hours.

In October 2018, church president Russell M. Nelson announced plans to consolidate the Sunday meeting schedule. As a part of these plans, sacrament meeting was shortened from seventy to sixty minutes, and local church leaders were instructed to limit the announcements at the beginning of the meeting.

==Sequence==

=== Preparation ===
* Shortly before the start of the meeting, the bread and water – which constitute the sacrament – are prepared by one or more young men, generally teachers in the church&#x27;s Aaronic priesthood.
* After the bread and water are readied, they are covered with a formal shroud, which resembles a tablecloth.
* Invitations to give prayers are generally extended by members of the bishopric or branch presidency.

===Meeting===
* First, the conducting officer (usually a member of the bishopric or branch presidency) welcomes those in attendance. 
* An opening hymn is sung by the congregation.
* The invocation, or opening prayer, is given by a member of the congregation.
* Church business is conducted. This includes the announcement of assignments and callings, the call for consent on various issues and assignments, and performance of ordinances, such as naming and blessing children and the confirmation of recently baptized converts. As with the announcements, this is optional and is only conducted when necessary.
* A sacrament hymn is sung by the congregation. As the song is sung, the priests of the Aaronic priesthood prepare the bread by breaking it into small (one inch or so) pieces. After this, the priests bless the bread. It is distributed to the congregation by deacons. After this, the priests bless the water, which is distributed in like manner. The prayers used are exact (see Doctrine and Covenants, ). If a mistake is made in the prayer, it is repeated from the beginning. Where sufficient number of Aaronic Priesthood holders are not available, Melchizedek priesthood holders prepare, bless, and pass the sacrament, as needed.
* Various sermons, or speeches, also known as &quot;talks&quot;, are delivered by previously assigned members of the congregation. Occasionally, visiting officials, such as members of the stake high council or stake presidency may speak. Often, congregational hymns or special musical numbers are included before or between talks. If it is Fast Sunday, (typically the first Sunday of every month), the congregation is invited to share their testimonies as they feel inclined, rather than hearing prepared talks. (See Fast and testimony meeting.)
* The meeting closes with another congregational hymn and a benediction, or closing prayer.

Sacrament meetings usually last approximately 60 minutes. Other church meetings that follow, or precede, sacrament meeting include Sunday School and Relief Society or priesthood quorum meetings for adults; Sunday School classes, Young Women and Young Men classes for the youth; and Primary classes and a nursery for children. The sum of these meetings constitute Sunday services and typically lasts two hours.

==Significance==
Members of the LDS Church believe that the ordinance of the sacrament allows them to renew the covenants they made when they were baptized. It is meant as an opportunity to be forgiven for their shortcomings during the week and to begin anew with renewed conviction.

With the approval of the bishop, priesthood holders may administer the sacrament to those who are homebound or otherwise cannot attend sacrament meeting.

A collection plate is not passed as part of sacrament meeting, or any other church service. The church operates by lay ministry, and local leaders, teachers, and speakers are not compensated. Church members make private contributions to the church, including tithing.

<doc id="1051970" wikidata="Q64049" url="?curid=1051970" title="Friedrich Tiedemann">
<text>Friedrich Tiedemann FRS HFRSE (23 August 178122 January 1861) was a German anatomist and physiologist. He was an expert on the anatomy of the brain.

Tiedemann spent most of his career as professor of anatomy and physiology at Heidelberg University, a position to which he was appointed in 1816, after having filled the chair of anatomy and zoology for ten years at Landshut. He was elected member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1827. In 1836, he was elected Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.

==Life==
Tiedemann was born at Cassel in Prussia (now central Germany), the eldest son of Dietrich Tiedemann (1748–1803), a philosopher and psychologist of considerable repute.

Friedrich studied medicine at Marburg, Bamberg and Würzburg Universities from 1798 and graduated in 1802. Undertaking practical experience he gained his doctorate (MD) from Marburg in 1804, but soon abandoned practice.

From 1804, he became a Docent, lecturing in Physiology and Comparative Osteology at Marburg University. The following year, at only 24 years of age, he became Professor of Zoology, Human Anatomy and Comparative Anatomy at Landshut University. In 1816, he moved to Heidelberg University as Professor of Physiology and Anatomy and remained there until his retirement in 1849.

He was elected a Foreign Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1832 and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1838.

He died in Munich on 22 January 1861. He is buried in the Alter Südfriedhof in Munich (Old South Cemetery).

==Viewpoints==

Tiedemann devoted himself to the study of natural science, and upon moving to Paris, became an ardent follower of Georges Cuvier. On his return to Germany, he advocated for anatomical research and aligned himself with the emerging field of experimental natural science. His staunch empiricism placed him at odds with contemporary adherents of romantic Naturphilosophie, such philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling and naturalist Lorenz Oken.

Tiedemann was among the first to scientifically contest racism. In his 1836 article &quot;On the Brain of the Negro, compared with that of the European and the Orang-outang,&quot; he compared the brain weight and cranial capacity of European and black human specimens with that of apes and concluded that, contrary to the consensus among his naturalist colleagues, the two racial groups exhibited &quot;absolutely no difference whatsoever&quot; in brain size or structure. He further contested the notion that &quot;there is any innate difference in the intellectual faculties of these two varieties of the human race&quot; and attributed the perceived inferiority of black people to the deleterious effects of slavery and colonialism.

In 1827, he became a correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, and when that became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851, he joined as a foreign member. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1849.

Tiedemann was influenced by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and accepted the transmutation of species. Science historian Robert J. Richards has written that Tiedemann &quot;joined the basic notion of species evolution, of a Lamarckian flavor, with the proposition that higher animals in their embryological development recapitulated the morphological stages of those lower in the scale.&quot; Writing in 1913, Hans Gadow noted that Tiedemann in 1814 had identified a basic function of sexual selection in preventing less fit males from propagating, and fossils as showing gradual metamorphosis of species over geological time.

In an 1854 medical-historical tract on tobacco, Tiedemann identified several adverse health effects of tobacco consumption, including cancers of the tongue brought on by smoking.

==Family==

In 1807, he married Frauline von Holzing. He was later married to Charlotte Hecker.

He had a daughter Elise.

One of Tiedemann&#x27;s sons, Gustav, was a casualty of the 1848 uprisings.

His son Heinrich immigrated to Philadelphia and became a physician in Philadelphia&#x27;s Germantown Hospital. Perhaps influenced by his father&#x27;s work, he objected to the Darwinian contention of a continuity between humans and apes.

==Legacy==
In 2007, Brazilian geneticist Sergio Pena called Tiedemann an &quot;anti-racist ahead of his time&quot;.

<doc id="1051972" wikidata="Q78532" url="?curid=1051972" title="Ernst von Dohnányi">
<text>Ernst von Dohnányi (Hungarian: &quot;Dohnányi Ernő&quot;, ; 27 July 1877 – 9 February 1960) was a Hungarian composer, pianist and conductor. He used the German form of his name on most published compositions.

==Biography==
Dohnányi was born in Pozsony, Kingdom of Hungary (today Bratislava, Slovakia). Born into the old noble Dohnányi family, he was the son of Frigyes Dohnányi (1843-1909) and his wife, Ottilia Szlabey. He first studied music with his father, a professor of mathematics and an amateur cellist, and then when he was eight years old, with Carl Forstner, organist at the local cathedral. In 1894 he moved to Budapest and enrolled in the Royal National Hungarian Academy of Music, studying piano with István Thomán and composition with Hans von Koessler, a cousin of Max Reger.

István Thomán had been a favorite student of Franz Liszt, while Hans von Koessler was a devotee of Johannes Brahms&#x27;s music. These two influences played an important part in Dohnányi&#x27;s life: Liszt on his piano playing and Brahms on his compositions. Dohnányi&#x27;s first published work, his Piano Quintet in C minor, earned approval from Brahms, who promoted it in Vienna. Dohnányi did not study long at the Academy of Music: in June 1897 he sought to take the final exams right away, without completing his studies. Permission was granted, and a few days later he passed with high marks, as composer and pianist, graduating at less than 20 years of age.

After a few lessons with Eugen d&#x27;Albert, another student of Liszt, Dohnányi made his debut in Berlin in 1897 and was recognized at once as a performer of high merit. Similar success followed in Vienna and on a subsequent tour of Europe. He made his London debut at a Richter concert in Queen&#x27;s Hall, with a notable performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 4. He was among the first to conduct and popularize Bartók&#x27;s more accessible music.

During the 1898 season, Dohnányi visited the United States, where he gained a reputation playing Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 4 for his American debut with the St. Louis Symphony. Unlike most famous pianists of the time, he did not limit himself to solo recitals and concertos, but also appeared in chamber music. In 1901 he completed his Symphony No. 1, his first orchestral work. Although he was heavily influenced by established contemporaries, notably Brahms, it displayed considerable technical skill in its own right.

Dohnányi married Elisabeth &quot;Elsa&quot; Kunwald (also a pianist), and they had a son, Hans, in 1902. Hans was to be the father of the German politician Klaus von Dohnányi and of the conductor Christoph von Dohnányi, longtime Music Director of the Cleveland Orchestra. Hans distinguished himself as a leader of the anti-Nazi resistance in Germany and was ultimately executed in the final stages of World War II. In addition to Hans, Dohnányi and Elsa Kunwald also had a daughter, Greta.

Following an invitation by the violinist Joseph Joachim, a close friend of Brahms, Dohnányi taught at the Hochschule in Berlin from 1905 to 1915. There he wrote &quot;The Veil of Pierrette&quot;, Op. 18, and the Suite in F-sharp minor, Op. 19. Returning to Budapest, he appeared in a remarkable number of performances over the following decade, notably in the Beethoven sesquicentenial year of 1920/1921.

Before World War I broke out, Dohnányi met and fell in love with a German actress (also described as a singer), Elsa Galafrés, who was married to the Polish Jewish violinist Bronisław Huberman. They could not yet marry as their spouses refused to divorce them, but nonetheless, Dohnányi and Elsa Galafrés had a son, Matthew, in January 1917. Both later gained the divorces they sought and were married in June 1919. Dohnányi also adopted Johannes, Elsa&#x27;s son by Huberman.

During the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic of 1919, Dohnányi was appointed Director of the Budapest Academy, but a few months later the new interim government replaced him with the prominent violinist Jenő Hubay after Dohnányi had refused to dismiss the pedagogue and composer Zoltán Kodály from the Academy for his supposedly leftist political position. However in 1920, with Admiral Horthy becoming Regent of Hungary, Dohnányi was named Music Director of the Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra and as such promoted the music of Béla Bartók, Zoltán Kodály, Leo Weiner and other contemporary Hungarian composers. That same 1920 season, he performed the complete piano works of Beethoven and recorded several of his works on the Ampico player-piano-roll apparatus. He gained renown as a teacher. His pupils included Andor Földes, Mischa Levitzki, Ervin Nyiregyházi, Géza Anda, Annie Fischer, Hope Squire, Helen Camille Stanley, Bertha Tideman-Wijers, Edward Kilenyi, Bálint Vázsonyi, Sir Georg Solti, Istvan Kantor, Georges Cziffra and Ľudovít Rajter (conductor and Dohnányi&#x27;s godson). In 1933 he organized the first International Franz Liszt Piano Competition.

In 1937 Dohnányi met Ilona Zachár, who was married with two children. By this time, he had separated from his second wife Elsa Galafrés. He and Ilona travelled throughout Europe as husband and wife, but were not legally married until they settled in the United States. After Dohnányi&#x27;s death, Ilona, in her biography, launched a campaign to quell his reputation as a Nazi sympathizer. Peter Halász continued this in an article titled &quot;Persecuted Musicians in Hungary between 1919–1945&quot;, which portrayed him as a &quot;victim&quot; of Nazism, and by James Grymes, who in his book called &quot;Dohnányi&quot; saw him as &quot;a forgotten hero of the Holocaust resistance&quot;.

In 1934 Dohnányi was once again appointed Director of the Budapest Academy of Music, a post he held until 1943. According to the 2015 entry on Dohnányi in New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, &quot;From 1939 much of [Dohnányi&#x27;s] time was devoted to the fight against growing Nazi influences.&quot; By 1941 he had resigned his directorial post, rather than submit to the anti-Jewish legislation. In his orchestra, the Budapest Philharmonic he managed to keep on all Jewish members until two months after the German invasion of Hungary in March 1944, when he disbanded the ensemble. In November 1944 he moved to Austria, a decision which drew criticism for many years. Musicologist James A. Grymes has defended Dohnányi&#x27;s actions during the war, crediting his solidarity with Jewish colleagues and his actions to help some escape from Nazi-occupied countries.

From 1949, Dohnányi taught for ten years at the Florida State University School of Music in Tallahassee. He became an honorary member of the Epsilon Iota chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity there. He and his wife Ilona became American citizens in 1955.
In the United States, he continued to compose and became interested in American folk music. His last orchestral work (except for a 1957 revision of the Symphony No. 2) was &quot;American Rhapsody&quot; (1953), written for the sesquicentennial of Ohio University and including folk material, for example, &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot;, &quot;On Top of Old Smokey&quot; and &quot;I am a poor wayfaring stranger&quot;.

His last public performance, on January 30, 1960, was at Florida State University, conducting the university orchestra in Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 4, with his doctoral student, Edward R. Thaden, as soloist. After the performance, Dohnányi traveled to New York City to record some Beethoven piano sonatas and shorter piano pieces for Everest Records. He had previously recorded a Mozart concerto in the early 1930s in Hungary (No. 17, in G major, K. 453, playing and conducting the Budapest Philharmonic),and also his own &quot;Variations on a Nursery Tune&quot;, the second movement of his &quot;Ruralia hungarica&quot; (Gypsy Andante), and a few solo works (but no Beethoven sonatas) on 78 rpm. He had also recorded various other works, including Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Tempest&quot; Sonata and Haydn&#x27;s F minor Variations, on early mono LPs.

Dohnányi died of pneumonia on 9 February 1960, in New York City, ten days after his final performance, and was buried in Tallahassee, Florida, where he had taught at the university for ten years.

==Influence and legacy==
*The BBC issued an LP recording taken from one of his last concerts, heard in 1959 at Florida State University, in which he played Beethoven&#x27;s piano sonata Op. 31 No. 1 and Schubert&#x27;s piano sonata D. 894. The Testament label has reissued the recital on CD in a set that also includes three of the pianist&#x27;s own short pieces that he played there as encores, a short recital of his works that he played at the 1956 Edinburgh Festival, and a few that were broadcast on the BBC in 1936.
*Dohnányi&#x27;s three volumes of &quot;Daily Finger Exercises for the Advanced Pianist&quot; were published by Mills Music in 1962.
*The Warren D. Allen Music Library at Florida State University&#x27;s College of Music holds a large archive of Dohnányi&#x27;s papers, manuscripts and related materials.
*The Hungarian government posthumously awarded him its highest civilian honor, the Kossuth Prize, in 1990.
*An International Ernst von Dohnányi Festival was held at Florida State University in 2002. The LSU professor Milton Hallman was a student of his and in 1987 recorded a CD called &quot;Works For Piano&quot; containing some of Dohnányi&#x27;s most notable music.

==Compositions==
Dohnányi&#x27;s composing style was personal, but very conservative. His music largely subscribes to the Romantic idiom. Although he used elements of Hungarian folk music, he is not seen to draw on folk traditions in the way that Bartók or Kodály do. Some characterize his style as traditional mainstream Euro-Germanic in the Brahmsian manner (structurally more than in the way the music actually sounds) rather than specifically Hungarian, while others hear very little of Brahms in his music. The very best of his works may be his Serenade in C major for string trio, Op. 10 (1902) and &quot;Variations on a Nursery Tune&quot; for piano and orchestra, Op. 25 (1914). His Second symphony is a major work which he composed during the Second World War. It is uncharacteristically sombre, notably in the third movement, which is grotesque and dissonant.

<text>Brunei International Airport (BIA) (, Jawi: لاڤڠن تربڠ انتارابڠسا بروني ) is the primary international airport and official airport of entry; one of two airports in the Sultanate of Brunei Darussalam, on the island of Borneo.

Located near Bandar Seri Begawan in the Brunei-Muara District, it serves as the home base and hub for Royal Brunei Airlines (RB). Additionally, the Royal Brunei Air Force (RBAirF) is also headquartered at Royal Brunei Air Force Base, Rimba, which is located opposite the main runway on the north-western side, within the aerodrome&#x27;s environs. Brunei International Airport serves international destinations across Asia and Oceania, as well as flights to the Middle East and London Heathrow.

==History==
===Foundation and early years===
Commercial air transport in Brunei Darussalam began in 1953, with the establishment of air service links connecting Brunei Town (present-day Bandar Seri Begawan and capital city of Brunei) with Anduki (near the oil town of Seria) in the Belait District. Initial flights linking Brunei to British Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak, Singapore, and overseas destinations were primarily provided by Borneo Airways and Malayan Airways. Airport services were operated from the Berakas area at an old runway site built by the Japanese during World War II. It was known then as Brunei Airport.

The growth in popularity of air travel in the 1970s resulted in a significant increase in civil aviation. Suddenly, the old airport at Berakas was swamped with activity, operating beyond its capacity. This situation prompted the government to scout for a new site to build a modern international airport. The construction of a new airport began in , in Mukim Berakas in the Brunei-Muara District, because this location was easily accessible from all areas of the country. The airport became operational in 1974, and its runway was one of the longest runways in the far east.

In tandem with these developments, Royal Brunei Airlines, initially known as Royal Brunei, took flight on , utilising the newly constructed Brunei International Airport as its hub. Founded on 18 November 1974, the airline marked its inception as a significant milestone in the burgeoning era of Brunei&#x27;s aviation history.

===Development since the 2000s===
In 2008, it was announced that a study to review necessary expansions and modifications was completed, and a masterplan was written up soon after. The masterplan consisted of different phases, and Phase 1, which included upgrading the existing air-conditioned passenger terminal building and the cargo terminal, was targeted to be completed by end of 2013. 

Phase 1A was already completed on 1 October 2013, with the opening of the new arrival hall. The capacity of the airport was to be increased to three million passengers by end of 2014. After Phase 1 was completed, Phase 2 was planned be initiated in 2022; this included the construction of a new terminal, which will be able to accommodate up to eight million passengers. Currently, the runway is being upgraded to allow bigger aircraft such as Airbus A380 and Boeing 747 to operate more easily.

==Facilities==
===Capacity===
Brunei International Airport consists of an international terminal which can handle up to three million passengers, a cargo terminal with a capacity of of cargo, and a royal terminal where the sultan&#x27;s flights are based. In 2005, Brunei International Airport handled 1.3 million passengers. 

===Terminal===
Inside the international terminal, there are 40 check-in counters, 12 emigration counters, and 14 immigration clearance counters. Businesses inside the terminal include Burger King and KFC international fast-food outlets, Jollibee regional fast food, plus local &#x27;concept stores&#x27; which include food, tea and coffee drinks, and jewellery stores, along with Avis car rental desk. It also includes a VIP Lounge for business travellers. Brunei International Airport has car parking space for 1,440 cars, with a further 300 covered parking spaces. Other facilities at BIA include a post office, bank, the Department of Civil Aviation (Brunei) (located within the air traffic control tower building), and the Brunei International Airport Mosque.

<text>&quot;This party should not be confused with the better-known Future New Zealand, a continuation of the Christian Democrats.&quot;

Future New Zealand was the name chosen by Peter Dunne for the party he founded after leaving the Labour Party. After spending several months as an independent, Dunne formed Future New Zealand as a centrist party in late 1994. The new party lasted only a short time before being overtaken by United New Zealand, established by a group of centrist MPs from both major parties. Dunne opted to integrate his Future New Zealand into the larger United in 1995, hoping to establish a broad centrist coalition. Dunne later became leader of United when all its other MPs were defeated in the 1996 election. In 2002, United merged with a different party also named Future New Zealand, and adopted its modern name, United Future.

<doc id="1051978" wikidata="Q433493" url="?curid=1051978" title="Raymond Bailey">
<text>Raymond Thomas Bailey (May 6, 1904 – April 15, 1980) was an American actor on the Broadway stage, films, and television. He is best known for his role as greedy banker Milburn Drysdale in the television series &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;.

==Early life and attempts at acting==
Bailey was born in San Francisco, California, the son of William and Alice (née O&#x27;Brien) Bailey. When he was a teenager he went to Hollywood to become a movie star. He found it was harder than he had thought, however, and took a variety of short-term jobs. He worked for a time as a day laborer at a movie studio in the days of silent pictures, but was fired for sneaking into a mob scene while it was being filmed. He also worked for a while as a stockbroker and a banker.

Having no success receiving movie roles of any kind, Bailey then went to New York City where he had no better success obtaining roles in theatre. Eventually, he began working as a merchant seaman and sailed to various parts of the world, including China, Japan, the Philippines and the Mediterranean. While docked in Hawaii, he worked on a pineapple plantation, acted at the community theatre and sang on a local radio program.

==Success on the second try at acting==
In 1938, he decided to try Hollywood again. His luck changed for the better when he actually began getting some bit parts in movies. He appeared as the character of Mr. West in the action adventure serial &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; (1940). After the United States entered World War II he again served in the United States Merchant Marine. When the war was over he returned to Hollywood and eventually began getting bigger character roles.

==Early roles in television, Broadway and film==

===Television===
In the early 1950s, Bailey was cast in many character roles in television series, such as &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Tales of Tomorrow&quot; (episode &quot;Ice from Space&quot;), &quot;Frontier&quot;, &quot;Crusader&quot;, &quot;My Friend Flicka&quot; (episode &quot;When Bugles Blow&quot;), &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (episodes &quot;General Parsley Smith&quot; and &quot;The Big Con&quot;), &quot;Tightrope&quot;, &quot;State Trooper&quot;, &quot;Coronado 9&quot;, and &quot;Johnny Ringo&quot;.

Other appearances were on &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot;, &quot;Private Secretary&quot;, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, &quot;Laramie&quot;, &quot;Bat Masterson&quot;, &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, &quot;Yancy Derringer&quot;, &quot;Riverboat&quot;, &quot;Bourbon Street Beat&quot;, &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Hennesey&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, three times on &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;One Step Beyond&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, &quot;The Tab Hunter Show&quot;, &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot;, &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, &quot;Bachelor Father&quot;, &quot;Going My Way&quot;, &quot;The Tom Ewell Show&quot;, &quot;The Investigators&quot;, &quot;Science Fiction Theatre&quot; (episode &quot;The Long Day&quot;), &quot;Whirlybirds&quot;, twice on &quot;Mister Ed&quot;, and twice on &quot;Wagon Train&quot;.

Bailey made two guest appearances on &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, playing banker Mr. Hilliard in &quot;The Case of the Caretaker&#x27;s Cat,&quot; and Dr. Bell in &quot;The Case of the Injured Innocent.&quot; During its 1960–1961 season, he had a regular role on &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot; and guest-starred on Pat O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s ABC sitcom &quot;Harrigan and Son&quot;. He appeared in the 1962–1963 season as Dean McGruder on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Many Loves Of Dobie Gillis&quot;.

===Broadway plays===
Bailey appeared in four Broadway plays, as Howard Haines in &quot;Last Stop&quot; (1944), playing an unknown man in &quot;The Bat&quot; (1953), A. J. Alexander in &quot;Sing Till Tomorrow&quot; (1953), and Captain Randolph Southard in &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot; (1954–1955), which starred Henry Fonda.

===Film roles===
Bailey&#x27;s film roles include playing a member of the board in the comedy/romance &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1954) starring Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn and William Holden; Mr. Benson in the drama &quot;Picnic&quot; (1955) starring William Holden and Kim Novak; a doctor in Hitchcock&#x27;s drama/thriller &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958) starring James Stewart and Novak; a Colonel in the comedy &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot; (1958) starring Andy Griffith; the warden of San Quentin in the crime/dramas &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; starring Susan Hayward and as Philip Dressler in &quot;The Lineup&quot; (1958); lawyer Brancato in the crime drama &quot;Al Capone&quot; (1959) starring Rod Steiger; and Major General Alexander &quot;Archie&quot; Vandegrift in the World War II drama &quot;The Gallant Hours&quot; (1960). He also played a plantation owner in &quot;Band of Angels&quot; (1957) starring Clark Gable, Sidney Poitier and Yvonne De Carlo. He also played in the low-budget horror classic, &quot;Tarantula!&quot; (1955), and had a small role in Irwin Allen&#x27;s &quot;Five Weeks in a Balloon&quot; (1962).

==Mr. Drysdale on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;==
In &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, Nancy Kulp portrayed Bailey&#x27;s ever loyal and by-the-book secretary, Miss Jane Hathaway. Banker Drysdale managed the millions of dollars in oil money royalties in the bank account of country gentleman Jed Clampett (portrayed by Buddy Ebsen). He was so keen on keeping an eye on the Clampetts that he convinced them to buy the mansion right next door to his own, in ritzy Beverly Hills. Often, Mr. Drysdale would be required to talk with Clampett about how strange &quot;city life&quot; and &quot;city folk&quot; are (when compared to Mr. Clampett&#x27;s view of &quot;normal&quot; country folk). On occasions when Mr. Clampett was considering withdrawing all his funds and returning to the country (his home near Bug Tussle), the miserly Mr. Drysdale would often panic and desperately work to try keep the family (and their fortune) in Beverly Hills.

Bailey began feeling the symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease around the time of the final episodes of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. He made only two film appearances after the show&#x27;s 1971 cancellation — the Disney features &quot;Herbie Rides Again&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Strongest Man in the World&quot; (1975) — before retiring in 1975 due to the effects of the disease.

In his final years, Bailey divided his time between a condominium and a houseboat in Laguna Niguel, California. He kept in touch with former co-star Nancy Kulp (whom he nicknamed &quot;Slim&quot;) but was primarily a recluse.

==Death==
Bailey died of a heart attack on April 15, 1980, aged 75, in Irvine, California. His body was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea.

<text>Clive Denby Matthewson (born 1944) is a New Zealand civil engineer and former politician.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Matthewson was born in Wellington in 1944. He was educated at Waitaki Boys&#x27; High School and University of Canterbury. He has a PhD in Civil Engineering which he completed in 1970. The title of his PhD thesis was: &quot;The elastic behaviour of a laterally loaded pile&quot;. He worked as a civil engineer until he was elected to parliament in 1984.

===Political career===


He was chairman of the electorate for the Labour Party and also a member of Labour&#x27;s governing body the New Zealand Council. In 1977, he sought the Labour nomination for the Christchurch electorate of , but was beaten by former MP Mike Moore. Two years later he stood for the Labour candidacy for the seat in a by-election, but was again unsuccessful. Matthewson then unsuccessfully contested the electorate in the for the Labour Party.

In the 1983 electoral redistribution, the number of Dunedin electorates was reduced from three to two. Brian MacDonell, who had since represented , was supposed to represent the new Dunedin West electorate. However, Labour&#x27;s president, Jim Anderton, presided over MacDonell&#x27;s de-selection and installed his personal friend Matthewson instead. Matthewson was elected to Dunedin West in . Matthewson was considered one of the most effective backbenchers in the Fourth Labour Government. In August 1989, he was appointed by Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer as Under-Secretary to the Minister of Health and Labour.

In February 1990, he was elected to cabinet and was appointed by Palmer as Minister of State Services, Minister of Science, Minister in charge of the Audit Department and Associate Minister of State Owned Enterprises, Energy, Commerce and Labour.

After the government was defeated he was appointed Shadow Minister of Social Security and State Services by Labour leader Mike Moore in 1991. He left Labour in 1995 to jointly establish the United New Zealand party with six other sitting MPs. Matthewson became United&#x27;s leader, and when the party formed a coalition with the governing National Party in 1996 he was made a Cabinet Minister. In the 1996 election, Peter Dunne was the only United politician to keep his seat, and Matthewson, who had contested the new electorate, did not return to Parliament.

In the 1998 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for public services as a Member of Parliament.

At the 1998 local-body elections Matthewson ran for the position of Mayor of Dunedin, but was defeated by incumbent Sukhi Turner.

===Post-politics===
He was the Director of Development and Alumni Relations at the University of Otago from 2002 to 2008, and between 23 July 2004 and 30 September 2008 was on the board of directors for the New Zealand Railways Corporation.

==Personal life==
Matthewson is married with five children. Katherine Rich, a former National Party MP, is his niece.

The term &quot;shift work&quot; includes both long-term night shifts and work schedules in which employees change or rotate shifts.

In medicine and epidemiology, shift work is considered a risk factor for some health problems in some individuals, as disruption to circadian rhythms may increase the probability of developing cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, diabetes, altered body composition and obesity, among other conditions.

==History==
The shift work system in modern industrial manufacturing originated in the late 18th century.

In 1867, Karl Marx wrote on the shift work system in &quot;Capital, Volume 1&quot;:
Capitalist production therefore drives, by its inherent nature, towards the appropriation of labour throughout the whole of the 24 hours in the day. But since it is physically impossible to exploit the same individual labour-power constantly, during the night as well as the day, capital has to overcome this physical obstacle. An alternation becomes necessary, between the labour-powers used up by day and those used up by night ... It is well known that this shift-system, this alternation of two sets of workers, predominated in the full-blooded springtime of the English cotton industry, and that at the present time it still flourishes, among other places, in the cotton-spinning factories of the Moscow &quot;gubernia&quot;. This 24-hour process of production exists today as a system in many of the as yet &#x27;free&#x27; branches of industry in Great Britain, in the blast-furnaces, forges, rolling mills and other metallurgical establishments of England, Wales and Scotland.

The Cromford Mill, starting from 1772, ran day and night with two twelve-hour shifts.

==Health effects==

Shift work increases the risk for the development of many disorders. Shift work sleep disorder is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder characterized by insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or both. Shift work is considered essential for the diagnosis. The risk of diabetes mellitus type 2 is increased in shift workers, especially men. People working rotating shifts are more vulnerable than others.

Women whose work involves night shifts have a 48% increased risk of developing breast cancer. This may be due to alterations in circadian rhythm: melatonin, a known tumor suppressor, is generally produced at night and late shifts may disrupt its production. The WHO&#x27;s International Agency for Research on Cancer listed &quot;shift work that involves circadian disruption&quot; as probably carcinogenic. Shift work may also increase the risk of other types of cancer. Working rotating shift work regularly during a two-year interval has been associated with a 9% increased the risk of early menopause compared to women who work no rotating shift work. The increased risk among rotating night shift workers was 25% among women predisposed to earlier menopause. Early menopause can lead to a host of other problems later in life. A recent study, found that women who worked rotating night shifts for more than six years, eleven percent experienced a shortened lifespan. Women who worked rotating night shifts for more than 15 years also experienced a 25 percent higher risk of death due to lung cancer.

Shift work also increases the risk of developing cluster headaches, heart attacks, fatigue, stress, sexual dysfunction, depression, dementia, obesity, metabolic disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and reproductive disorders.
Shift work also can worsen chronic diseases, including sleep disorders, digestive diseases, heart disease, hypertension, epilepsy, mental disorders, substance abuse, asthma, and any health conditions that are treated with medications affected by the circadian cycle. Artificial lighting may additionally contribute to disturbed homeostasis. Shift work may also increase a person&#x27;s risk of smoking.

The health consequences of shift work may depend on chronotype, that is, being a day person or a night person, and what shift a worker is assigned to. When individual chronotype is opposite of shift timing (day person working night shift), there is a greater risk of circadian rhythms disruption. Nighttime workers sleep an average of one–four hours less than daytime workers.

Different shift schedules will have different impacts on the health of a shift worker. The way the shift pattern is designed affects how shift workers sleep, eat and take holidays. Some shift patterns can exacerbate fatigue by limiting rest, increasing stress, overworking staff or disrupting their time off.

Muscle health is also compromised by shift work: altered sleep and eating times, changes to appetite-regulating hormones and total energy expenditure, increased snacking and binge drinking, and reduced protein intake can contribute to negative protein balance, increases in insulin resistance and increases in body fat, resulting in weight gain and more long-term health challenges.
Compared with the day shift, injuries and accidents have been estimated to increase by 15% on evening shifts and 28% on night shifts. Longer shifts are also associated with more injuries and accidents: 10-hour shifts had 13% more and 12-hour shifts had 28% more than 8-hour shifts. Other studies have shown a link between fatigue and workplace injuries and accidents. Workers with sleep deprivation are far more likely to be injured or involved in an accident. Breaks reduce accident risks.

One study suggests that, for those working a night shift (such as 23:00 to 07:00), it may be advantageous to sleep in the evening (14:00 to 22:00) rather than the morning (08:00 to 16:00). The study&#x27;s evening sleep subjects had 37% fewer episodes of attentional impairment than the morning sleepers.

There are four major determinants of cognitive performance and alertness in healthy shift-workers: circadian phase, sleep inertia, acute sleep deprivation and chronic sleep deficit. 
* The circadian phase is relatively fixed in humans; attempting to shift it so that an individual is alert during the circadian bathyphase is difficult. Sleep during the day is shorter and less consolidated than night-time sleep. Before a night shift, workers generally sleep less than before a day shift.
* The effects of sleep inertia wear off after two–four hours of wakefulness, such that most workers who wake up in the morning and go to work suffer some degree of sleep inertia at the beginning of their shift. The relative effects of sleep inertia vs. the other factors are hard to quantify; however, the benefits of napping appear to outweigh the cost associated with sleep inertia.
* Acute sleep deprivation occurs during long shifts with no breaks, as well as during night shifts when the worker sleeps in the morning and is awake during the afternoon, prior to the work shift. A night shift worker with poor daytime sleep may be awake for more than 18 hours by the end of his shift. The effects of acute sleep deprivation can be compared to impairment due to alcohol intoxication, with 19 hours of wakefulness corresponding to a BAC of 0.05%, and 24 hours of wakefulness corresponding to a BAC of 0.10%. Much of the effect of acute sleep deprivation can be countered by napping, with longer naps giving more benefit than shorter naps. Some industries, specifically the fire service, have traditionally allowed workers to sleep while on duty, between calls for service. In one study of EMS providers, 24-hour shifts were not associated with a higher frequency of negative safety outcomes when compared to shorter shifts.
* Chronic sleep deficit occurs when a worker sleeps for fewer hours than is necessary over multiple days or weeks. The loss of two hours of nightly sleep for a week causes an impairment similar to those seen after 24 hours of wakefulness. After two weeks of such deficit, the lapses in performance are similar to those seen after 48 hours of continual wakefulness. The number of shifts worked in a month by EMS providers was positively correlated with the frequency of reported errors and adverse events.

== Sleep assessment during shift work ==
A cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between several sleep assessment criteria and different shift work schedules (3-day, 6-day, 9-day and 21-day shift) and a control group of day shift work in Korean firefighters. The results found that all shift work groups exhibited significant decreased total sleep time (TST) and decreased sleep efficiency in the night shift but efficiency increased in the rest day. Between-group analysis of the different shift work groups revealed that day shift sleep efficiency was significantly higher in the 6-day shift while night shift sleep efficiency was significantly lower in the 21-day shift in comparison to other shift groups (&quot;p&quot; &lt; 0.05). Overall, night shift sleep quality was worse in shift workers than those who just worked the day shift, whereas 6-day shift provided better sleep quality compared to the 21-day shift.

== Safety and regulation==
Shift work has been shown to negatively affect workers, and has been classified as a specific disorder (shift work sleep disorder). Circadian disruption by working at night causes symptoms like excessive sleepiness at work and sleep disturbances. Shift work sleep disorder also creates a greater risk for human error at work. Shift work disrupts cognitive ability and flexibility and impairs attention, motivation, decision making, speech, vigilance, and overall performance.

To mitigate the negative effects of shift work on safety and health, many countries have enacted regulations on shift work. The European Union, in its directive 2003/88/EC, has established a 48-hour limit on working time (including overtime) per week; a minimum rest period of 11 consecutive hours per 24-hour period; and a minimum uninterrupted rest period of 24 hours of mandated rest per week (which is in addition to the 11 hours of daily rest).&lt;ref name=&quot;2003/88/EC&quot;&gt;Directive 2003/88/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time.&lt;/ref&gt; The EU directive also limits night work involving &quot;special hazards or heavy physical or mental strain&quot; to an average of eight hours in any 24-hour period. The EU directive allows for limited derogations from the regulation, and special provisions allow longer working hours for transportation and offshore workers, fishing vessel workers, and doctors in training (see also medical resident work hours).

===Aircraft traffic flight controllers and pilots===
For fewer operational errors, the FAA goal calls for Flight Controllers to be on duty for 5 to 6 hours per shift, with the remaining shift time devoted to meals and breaks. For aircraft pilots, the actual time at the controls (flight time) is limited to 8 or 9 hours, depending on the time of day.

===Industrial disasters===
Fatigue due to shift work has contributed to several industrial disasters, including the Three Mile Island accident, the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster and the Chernobyl disaster. The Alaska Oil Spill Commission&#x27;s final report on the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill disaster found that it was &quot;conceivable&quot; that excessive work hours contributed to crew fatigue, which in turn contributed to the vessel&#x27;s running aground.

== Prevention ==

=== Management practices ===
The practices and policies put in place by managers of round-the-clock or 24/7 operations can significantly influence shift worker alertness (and hence safety) and performance.

Air traffic controllers typically work an 8-hour day, 5 days per week. Research has shown that when controllers remain &quot;in position&quot; for more than two hours, even at low traffic levels, performance can deteriorate rapidly, so they are typically placed &quot;in position&quot; for 30-minute intervals (with 30 minutes between intervals).

These practices and policies can include selecting an appropriate shift schedule or rota and using an employee scheduling software to maintain it, setting the length of shifts, managing overtime, increasing lighting levels, providing shift worker lifestyle training, retirement compensation based on salary in the last few years of employment (which can encourage excessive overtime among older workers who may be less able to obtain adequate sleep), or screening and hiring of new shift workers that assesses adaptability to a shift work schedule. Mandating a minimum of 10 hours between shifts is an effective strategy to encourage adequate sleep for workers. Allowing frequent breaks and scheduling 8- or 10-hour shifts instead of 12-hour shifts can also minimize fatigue and help to mitigate the negative health effects of shift work.
Multiple factors need to be considered when developing optimal shift work schedules, including shift timing, length, frequency and length of breaks during shifts, shift succession, worker commute time, as well as the mental and physical stress of the job. Even though studies support 12-hour shifts are associated with increased occupational injuries and accident (higher rates with subsequent, successive shifts), a synthesis of evidence cites the importance of all factors when considering the safety of a shift.

Shift work was once characteristic primarily of the manufacturing industry, where it has a clear effect of increasing the use that can be made of capital equipment and allows for up to three times the production compared to just a day shift. It contrasts with the use of overtime to increase production at the margin. Both approaches incur higher wage costs. Although 2nd-shift worker efficiency levels are typically 3–5% below 1st shift, and 3rd shift 4–6% below 2nd shift, the productivity level, i.e. cost per employee, is often 25% to 40% lower on 2nd and 3rd shifts due to fixed costs which are &quot;paid&quot; by the first shift.

=== Shift system ===
The 42-hour work-week allows for the most even distribution of work time. A 3:1 ratio of work days to days off is most effective for eight-hour shifts, and a 2:2 ratio of work days to days off is most effective for twelve-hour shifts. Eight-hour shifts and twelve-hour shifts are common in manufacturing and health care. Twelve-hour shifts are also used with a very slow rotation in the petroleum industry. Twenty-four-hour shifts are common in health care and emergency services.

=== Shift schedule and shift plan ===
The shift plan or rota is the central component of a shift schedule. The schedule includes considerations of shift overlap, shift change times and alignment with the clock, vacation, training, shift differentials, holidays, etc., whereas the shift plan determines the sequence of work and free days within a shift system.

Rotation of shifts can be fast, in which a worker changes shifts more than once a week, or slow, in which a worker changes shifts less than once a week. Rotation can also be forward, when a subsequent shift starts later, or backward, when a subsequent shift starts earlier. Evidence supports forward rotating shifts are more adaptable for shift workers&#x27; circadian physiology.

One main concern of shift workers is knowing their schedule more than two weeks at a time. Shift work is stressful. When on a rotating or ever changing shift, workers have to worry about daycare, personal appointments, and running their households. Many already work more than an eight-hour shift. Some evidence suggests giving employees schedules more than a month in advance would give proper notice and allow planning, their stress level would be reduced.

==Management==
Though shift work itself remains necessary in many occupations, employers can alleviate some of the negative health consequences of shift work. The United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends employers avoid quick shift changes and any rotating shift schedules should rotate forward. Employers should also attempt to minimize the number of consecutive night shifts, long work shifts and overtime work. A poor work environment can exacerbate the strain of shift work. Adequate lighting, clean air, proper heat and air conditioning, and reduced noise can all make shift work more bearable for workers.

Good sleep hygiene is recommended. This includes blocking out noise and light during sleep, maintaining a regular, predictable sleep routine, avoiding heavy foods and alcohol before sleep, and sleeping in a comfortable, cool environment. Alcohol consumption, caffeine consumption and heavy meals in the few hours before sleep can worsen shift work sleep disorders. Exercise in the three hours before sleep can make it difficult to fall asleep.

Free online training programs are available to educate workers and managers about the risks associated with shift work and strategies they can use to prevent these.

===Scheduling===

Algorithmic scheduling of shift work can lead to what has been colloquially termed as &quot;clopening&quot; where the shift-worker has to work the closing shift of one day and the opening shift of the next day back-to-back resulting in short rest periods between shifts and fatigue. Co-opting employees to fill the shift roster helps to ensure that the human costs are taken into account in a way which is hard for an algorithm to do as it would involve knowing the constraints and considerations of each individual shift worker and assigning a cost metric to each of those factors. Shift based hiring which is a recruitment concept that hires people for individual shifts, rather than hiring employees before scheduling them into shifts enables shift workers to indicate their preferences and availability for unfilled shifts through a shift-bidding mechanism. Through this process, the shift hours are evened out by human-driven market mechanism rather than an algorithmic process. This openness can lead to work hours that are tailored to an individual&#x27;s lifestyle and schedule while ensuring that shifts are optimally filled, in contrast to the generally poor human outcomes of fatigue, stress, estrangement with friends and family and health problems that have been reported with algorithm-based scheduling of work-shifts.

Mental (cognitive) fatigue due to inadequate sleep an/or disturbances of circadian rhythms is a common contributor to accidents and untoward incidents. While this risk cannot be eliminated, it can be managed through personal and administrative controls. This type of management is conducted through a Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS). One method used within an FRMS is objective fatigue modeling to predict periods of high risk within a 24-hour shift plan.

Missing income is also a large part of shift worker. Several companies run twenty-four-hour shifts. Most of the work is done during the day. When the work dries up, it usually is the second and third shift workers who pay the price. They are told to punch out early or use paid time off if they have any to make up the difference in their paychecks. That practice costs the average worker $92.00 a month.

===Medications===
Melatonin may increase sleep length during both daytime and nighttime sleep in people who work night shifts. Zopiclone has also been investigated as a potential treatment, but it is unclear if it is effective in increasing daytime sleep time in shift workers. There are, however, no reports of adverse effects.

Modafinil and R-modafinil are useful to improve alertness and reduce sleepiness in shift workers. Modafinil has a low risk of abuse compared to other similar agents. However, 10% more participants reported adverse effects (nausea and headache) while taking modafinil. In post-marketing surveillance, modafinil was associated with Stevens–Johnson syndrome. The European Medicines Agency withdrew the license for modafinil for shift workers for the European market because it judged that the benefits did not outweigh the adverse effects.

Using caffeine and naps before night shifts can decrease sleepiness. Caffeine has also been shown to reduce errors made by shift workers.

==Epidemiology==

According to data from the National Health Interview Survey and the Occupational Health Supplement, 27% of all U.S. workers in 2015 worked an alternative shift (not a regular day shift) and 7% frequently worked a night shift. Prevalence rates were higher for workers aged 18–29 compared to other ages. Those with an education level beyond high school had a lower prevalence rate of alternative shifts compared to workers with less education. Among all occupations, protective service occupations had the highest prevalence of working an alternative shift (54%).

One of the ways in which working alternative shifts can impair health is through decreasing sleep opportunities. Among all workers, those who usually worked the night shift had a much higher prevalence of short sleep duration (44.0%, representing approximately 2.2 million night shift workers) than those who worked the day shift (28.8%, representing approximately 28.3 million day shift workers). An especially high prevalence of short sleep duration was reported by night shift workers in the transportation and warehousing (69.7%) and health-care and social assistance (52.3%) industries.

==Adoption==
It is estimated that 15–20% of workers in industrialized countries are employed in shift work. Shift work is common in the transportation sector as well. Some of the earliest instances appeared with the railroads, where freight trains have clear tracks to run on at night.

Shift work is also the norm in fields related to public protection and healthcare, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, firefighting, security and hospitals. Shift work is a contributing factor in many cases of medical errors. Shift work has often been common in the armed forces. Military personnel, pilots, and others that regularly change time zones while performing shift work experience jet lag and consequently suffer sleep disorders.

Those in the field of meteorology, such as the National Weather Service and private forecasting companies, also use shift work, as constant monitoring of the weather is necessary. Much of the Internet services and telecommunication industry relies on shift work to maintain worldwide operations and uptime.

Service industries now increasingly operate on some shift system; for example a restaurant or convenience store will normally be open on most days for much longer than a working day.

There are many industries requiring 24/7 coverage that employ workers on a shift basis, including:

*Caregiver
**Direct support professional
* Customer service, including call centers
* Data center and IT operations
* Death care (medical examiner or coroner)
* Emergency services
** Police
** Firefighting
** Emergency medical services
* Entertainment
**Casino workers

<text>The Milwaukee Wave are an American professional indoor soccer team based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that competes in the Major Arena Soccer League (MASL). Founded in 1984, they have been the oldest continuously operating professional indoor soccer team in the United States and are seven-time league champions, most recent being the 2018–19 champions of the MASL.

The team plays their games at the UW–Milwaukee Panther Arena. The team colors are black and yellow. The team has won 7 league championships in their history, three in the NPSL, three in the MISL, and one in the MASL.

==History==
The team was founded on August 3, 1984, as a member of the American Indoor Soccer Association and played in every season and incarnation of that league (see MISL). They have also played in the Xtreme Soccer League and the third version of the MISL. The team is currently a member of the Major Arena Soccer League. Milwaukee also hosted the 2003 and 2006 MISL II All-Star Games.

Keith Tozer was the team&#x27;s coach for 21 years before leaving to become United States national futsal team head coach. While with the Wave, he was the all-time winningest coach in North American indoor soccer, with six league championships and more than 700 wins.

The Wave played in the first season of the Xtreme Soccer League in the 2008 – 2009 season, but moved to the new Major Indoor Soccer League for the 2009–2010 season.

After the 2013–2014 season, the team announced that it was leaving the MISL along with five other teams and join the MASL.

In 2014 the ownership group ROC Ventures, headed by Mike Zimmerman, became a partner in the team&#x27;s ownership.

Just before the 2014–15 season began, the Wave replaced their traditional green artificial turf with a black turf to match the team&#x27;s colors and marketing strategy. Reception by fans and the press was mixed but generally positive.

<doc id="1052000" wikidata="Q7242872" url="?curid=1052000" title="Priest (Latter Day Saints)">
<text>Priest is a priesthood office in the Aaronic priesthood of denominations within the Latter Day Saint movement, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

==Priests in the LDS Church==

In the LDS Church, priest is the third of four offices of the Aaronic priesthood. Male members who turn 16 in the coming year are eligible to become ordained priests in January. An interview with and approval by the bishop is required before ordination. Prior to ordination, the proposed ordination must also be accepted by common consent by the members of the ward. With the approval of the bishop, a priest or a holder of the Melchizedek priesthood may ordain a person to the office of priest by the laying on of hands. All priests in a ward are members of a priests quorum. A priests quorum can have a maximum of 48 members.

The president of the priests quorum is the bishop, who holds the keys of the priesthood for this quorum. The bishop typically chooses a first and second assistant and a secretary from among the members of the quorum. These officers may not be set apart until after they have been accepted by the common consent of the members of the quorum.

According to the Doctrine and Covenants, the duty of a priest is to &quot;preach, teach, expound, exhort, and baptize, and administer the sacrament&quot;. Accordingly, priests bless the sacrament and are permitted to perform baptism. They can also ordain deacons, teachers, and priests and confer the Aaronic priesthood upon others. A priest must receive the approval of the bishop prior to performing any of these actions. Usually, a priest will be paired with a man (often their father) as a ministering brother (formerly known as home teacher ). Priests also have all the duties and authority of a teacher and a deacon.

In 1908, Joseph F. Smith organized a committee to standardize and reform the Aaronic Priesthood quorums. This committee standardized the age requirements for young men to be ordained to the office of Teacher or Priest. Before that time there were not set ages for ordination.

A priest who turns 18 years old, or graduates from high school, depending on the situation, is integrated into the elders quorum. Those who are 18 years old and approved by the bishop and stake president may receive the Melchizedek priesthood and become an elder.

Priests usually spend much time preparing for future service as a missionary. All suitable young men in the church are asked to serve missions, with the option to do so at age 18 if they have graduated from high school.

==Priests in the Community of Christ==

In the Community of Christ, a priest is an adult, who is a congregation-focused &quot;Minister of Presence&quot; in the Aaronic Priesthood. Their stated purpose is to &quot;express their ministry of presence and model Jesus as Friend by being a spiritual friend to families, congregations, and community.&quot; Each congregation should have a designated bishop or stewardship commissioner who is responsible for Aaronic ministry in that congregation. A priest is to meet the needs of their congregation by following the annual Aaronic Ministry Plan in place for their specific congregation.

==Priest in the Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite) ==
The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite) does not recognize priest as a specific office of the priesthood.

<text>The Maisonneuve fracture is a spiral fracture of the proximal third of the fibula associated with a tear of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis and the interosseous membrane. There is an associated fracture of the medial malleolus or rupture of the deep deltoid ligament of the ankle. This type of injury can be difficult to detect.

The Maisonneuve fracture is typically a result of excessive, external rotative force being applied to the deltoid and syndesmotic ligaments. Due to this, the Maisonneuve fracture is described as a pronation-external rotation injury according to the Lauge-Hansen classification system. It is also classified as a Type C ankle fracture according to the Danis-Weber classification system.

The Maisonneuve fracture is similar to the Galeazzi fracture in the sense that there is an important ligamentous disruption in association with the fracture. The fracture is named after the surgeon Jules Germain François Maisonneuve.

== Cause ==
Forceful, external rotation of the ankle joint is the main cause of a Maisonneuve fracture. Engaging in high-intensity sports or falling over can increase the risk of tearing the deltoid ligament or cause an avulsion fracture of the medial malleolus from external rotation of the foot. In some cases, motor vehicle accidents can also result in a Maisonneuve fracture.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Common symptoms of a Maisonneuve fracture are pain, swelling, tenderness, and bruising around the ankle joint and inferior (or distal) tibiofibular joint. More specifically, as a pronation-external rotation injury, pain during external rotation of the ankle joint is expected. Additionally, there is a reduced range of motion of the foot and an inability to weight-bear due to ankle pain. Pain may also be felt around the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle, and more rarely around the superior (or proximal) tibiofibular joint. Damage to the deltoid ligament or interosseous membrane can cause haemorrhaging around the surrounding tissues, resulting in a localised oedema.

As the syndesmotic ligaments are responsible for stabilising the ankle mortise and tibiotalar joint, disruption to this syndesmosis can cause a reduction of the space between the distal tibia, fibula, and talus. A long-term effect of this is painful ankle osteoarthritis due to the direct contact between the tibia and talus.

If a Maisonneuve fracture is left untreated, instability of the tibiotalar joint and deltoid ligament can cause a valgus deformity of the ankle. This leaves the ankle joint in a state of chronic pronation, characterised by a protrusion of the medial malleolus into the subcutaneous tissue.

== Pathophysiology ==

The Maisonneuve fracture generally follows a specific pattern of injury. The following are described as subsequent events that result in a Maisonneuve fracture:

* Forceful, external rotation of the ankle joint results in the tearing of the deep deltoid ligament and/or an avulsion fracture of the medial malleolus.
* The ankle mortise is subjected to excessive torque, rupturing the syndesmotic ligaments and anteromedial ankle joint capsule.
* Rotative energy is transferred upwards along the interosseous membrane, damaging it in the process.
* The force results in a spiral, sometimes an oblique, fracture at the neck of the proximal fibula.

In cases where the anterior aspect of the tibiofibular syndesmosis can resist mechanical stress, only an oblique fracture of the lateral malleolus is produced. Diastasis of the lateral malleolus may also occur, in which it is posterolaterally displaced from the tibia.

Although most Maisonneuve cases report a pronation-external rotation mechanism of injury, clinical studies have recorded instances of supination-external rotation being the mechanism of injury. Slight or high degrees of plantarflexion prior to supination-external rotation of the foot have been identified in patients with proximal fibular fractures.

== Diagnosis ==

Diagnosing a Maisonneuve fracture requires a combination of medical history, physical examination, and radiographic imaging. Patients generally do not report pain near the proximal fibula, so physical examination such as palpation along the fibula is effective for differentiating a Maisonneuve fracture from an isolated syndesmotic injury. Feeling pain near the proximal fibula during palpation is a positive indication of a Maisonneuve fracture. Ankle instability is often associated with a damaged proximal fibula in a Maisonneuve fracture, so patients are typically asked about the mechanism of injury. Mortise stability is examined to rule out the possibility of an isolated fibular fracture.

Ankle radiographs are used to detect widening of the tibiofibular syndesmosis or medial clear space. The medial clear space is the area between the talus of the ankle and the medial malleolus. Damage to the deltoid ligament and syndesmotic ligaments result in mortise instability, causing the talus to laterally shift and widen the medial clear space. A clinical study, conducted in 2006 and published in the &quot;Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery&quot;, found that the medial clear space size of a normal ankle and an injured ankle measured at 4 millimetres and 5.4 millimetres in length respectively. To confirm diagnosis, full-leg radiographs are used to inspect for fractures of the proximal fibula and widening of the interosseous clear space (or tibiofibular clear space). The interosseous clear space is the area between the medial side of the fibula and lateral side of the tibia. A peer-reviewed study, published in &quot;Injury&quot; in 2004, found that an interosseous clear space greater than 10 millimetres indicates diastasis of the syndesmotic ligaments.

If necessary, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be used to clarify diagnosis. MRI scans can check for interosseous membrane or tibial tubercle damage if high instability of the ankle is diagnosed. Arthroscopy may be used to diagnose a syndesmotic lesion but is often not recommended due to operative difficulty. Stress radiographs of the ankle are used to assess the integrity of the deltoid ligament and tibiofibular syndesmosis. The size of the medial clear space can also be measured using stress radiography.

=== Classification ===
A Maisonneuve fracture may be a simple fracture or comminuted fracture:

* A simple fracture, in the case of a Maisonneuve fracture, only refers to the fibula being broken in one place without any damage being done to the surrounding tissues.
* A comminuted fracture is when the bone is broken in more than two places.

X-ray, CT, or MRI scans can be used to diagnose the extent of the Maisonneuve fracture&#x27;s damage and determine whether it is a simple or comminution fracture. During diagnosis, a supination-external rotation pattern of injury may also be concluded if there is an isolated fracture of the posterior tubercle of the tibia.

== Treatment ==

* Reduce the proximal fibula and medial malleolus to achieve stabilisation
* Repair the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis and deltoid ligament
* Restore ankle mortise stability

Treatment can be achieved by either non-operative (or conservative) or operative means. The main operative treatments for a Maisonneuve fracture are open-reduction surgery and closed-reduction surgery, both of which usually preceding internal fixation of the injury. These procedures are known as Open Reduction Internal Fixation (ORIF) and Closed Reduction Internal Fixation (CRIF).

=== Internal fixators ===
Syndesmotic screws are the main, internal fixators used in surgeries for a Maisonneuve fracture. Two main types of syndesmotic screws are used: trans-syndesmotic screws (positioned at the level of the syndesmosis) and supra-syndesmotic screws (positioned above the syndesmosis).

Based on several clinical results, syndesmotic screws are recommended to be fixed at least 1 centimetre proximal to the tibiofibular syndesmosis or 4 to 6 centimetres proximal to the tibiotalar joint line. Cadaveric analyses, from a comparative study published in &quot;Foot &amp; Ankle International&quot; in 1997, suggest that screw fixation at 2 centimetres proximal to the tibiotalar joint line is also adequate. Biodegradable implants such as bioabsorbable screws, which do not require postoperative removal, may be used as an alternative to metallic hardware. However, biodegradable implants still limit rotation of the ankle and dorsiflexion of the foot.

=== Non-operative treatment ===
In cases where only the posterior ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis are partially damaged, non-operative treatment such as long-leg casting for at least 6 weeks is recommended. Immobilisation techniques such as casting are often paired with non-weight bearing precautions. Gradually, physiotherapy rehabilitation programs allow patients to weight-bear after at least 8 weeks of postoperative casting. Orthopaedic surgeons also administer these non-operative treatments for cases where the medial malleolus remains intact.

=== Operative treatment ===

==== Open Reduction Internal Fixation (ORIF) ====

Open-reduction surgery is typically not performed at the level of the proximal fibula, as dissection near the proximal end may risk severing the common peroneal nerve. Instead, reducing the proximal fibula at the level of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis is recommended. A hook test is performed, using a curved hook, to assess the stability of the fibula. If instability is detected, further distraction of the fibula can be done to repair the full bone. The fibula can then be guided into the fibular notch located on the tibia, effectively restoring its length. Internal rotation of the foot may then be used to correct anatomical alignment.

Following open-reduction, internal fixation is usually performed to stabilise the ankle mortise. To account for the distal fibula being slightly posterior to the distal tibia, drill holes are angled at 30° from the anteromedial aspect of the tibia to the posterolateral aspect of the fibula. Trans-syndesmotic screws can be inserted in this way to ensure tibia fixation. Additional supra-syndesmotic screws may be temporarily inserted, for approximately 3 to 6 months, if instability is still present after fibular reduction. To reduce the fibula and restore the ankle mortise to its proper anatomical configuration, partial dorsiflexion of the foot is maintained prior to intraoperative screw fixation. This is because, in a neutral or maximally dorsiflexed position of the foot, the trochlear surface of the talus may reduce maximal postoperative dorsiflexion due to rigidity after screw fixation.

Assessing the severity of syndesmotic lesions can be performed with fluoroscopic screening. Guidance under fluoroscopy can also assist with syndesmotic screw fixation. Restoration of the anteromedial joint capsule of the ankle can be achieved with suturing techniques.

==== Closed Reduction Internal Fixation (CRIF) ====

Closed-reduction surgery requires no dissection or incisions being made into the leg to operate. It is most commonly applied in cases where the Maisonneuve fracture has only extensively damaged the anterior portion of the syndesmotic ligaments. That is, the posterior hinge of the ankle is still stable, and the foot can be internally rotated using traction to restore fibular bone length. Long-leg casting or short-leg casting is applied postoperatively to maintain this alignment.

It is generally recommended that medial malleolar fractures do not require surgical intervention if closed reduction is sufficient for the restoration of bone length. Otherwise, large medial malleolar fractures can be fixed using trans-syndesmotic screws, figure-of-8 wires, or Kirschner wires. For smaller medial malleolar fractures, repair with a wire-tension band is sufficient.

=== Complications ===
Delaying diagnosis and treatment can result in intraoperative complications. In one case of a clinical study, conducted in 2000 and published in &quot;Orthopedics&quot;, the insertion of a super-syndesmotic screw caused the lateral malleolus to be further shifted laterally; subsequent removal of the screw was necessary.

Complications that may postoperatively occur include:

* the development of osteoarthritis around the ankle joint.
* the development of peroneal nerve palsy following damage to the common peroneal nerve.
* extra-osseous (&quot;outside of the bone&quot;) calcification of vessels or tissues surrounding the tibiofibular joint.

==== Surgical hardware complications ====
Incorrectly positioned screws can potentially make contact with articular surfaces, which can cause calcification around the affected area. Screw breakage can also cause pain in these areas.

Postoperative hardware removal can cause problems such as infection, joint rigidity, or diastasis if fixation was not sufficiently long enough. In areas where residual stiffness has persisted, patients may report feeling pain or a mild aching sensation. Generally, it is recommended that hardware removal should be done anywhere from 6 weeks to 12 weeks after internal fixation to allow the tibiofibular syndesmosis to properly heal. Syndesmotic screws should be removed prior to rehabilitative training; bearing weight without prior hardware removal may result in ankle stiffness due to reduced dorsiflexion of the foot and potential screw breakage.

=== Postoperative follow-ups ===
Postoperative follow-ups are done to ensure that treatment has produced satisfactory results, such as checking if malreduction of any of the associated structures in a Maisonneuve fracture has occurred. Follow-ups may be performed from 6 months to 2 years after the surgery and are applicable for both non-operative and operative treatments.

== Epidemiology ==

Exact incidence rates are unknown, but it is believed that the Maisonneuve fracture accounts for 5% of all ankle injuries treated in surgery. The Maisonneuve fracture has been reported in patients as young as 17–19 years old, and up to 42–70 years old. The injury is mostly seen in male patients. A clinical article on studies conducted between 2014 and 2019, published in &quot;Orthopaedic Surgery&quot; in 2020, reported that 78% of admitted patients with a Maisonneuve fracture were male.

Sporting injuries are the most common risk factor of causing a Maisonneuve fracture. Sport-related injuries were associated with 50% of all Maisonneuve fracture cases examined in one clinical study. Comorbidity of the Maisonneuve fracture and other health conditions, such as hypertension, obesity, and psoriatic arthritis, have been identified in patient medical histories.

<text>Craig McCracken (born March 31, 1971) is an American cartoonist, animator, director, writer, and producer known for creating Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; and &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot;, Disney Channel and Disney XD&#x27;s &quot;Wander Over Yonder&quot;, and Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Kid Cosmic&quot;.

Regarded as &quot;one of the most successful creators of episodic comedy cartoons&quot;, his style was &quot;at the forefront of a second wave of innovative, creator-driven television animation&quot; in the 1990s, along with that of other animators such as Genndy Tartakovsky, and has been credited as &quot;a staple of American modern animated television&quot;.

==Early life and education==
McCracken was born March 31, 1971, in Charleroi, Pennsylvania. He began drawing at an early age. He attended California High School in Whittier, California, and the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), where he met his friend and future collaborator, Genndy Tartakovsky. During his first year, he created a series of short cartoons featuring a character named No Neck Joe, which were picked up by Spike and Mike&#x27;s Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation. While at CalArts, he also created a short entitled &quot;Whoopass Stew!&quot;, which would later become the basis for &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;.

==Career==
In 1993, McCracken was hired by Hanna-Barbera Cartoons as an art director on the Turner Broadcasting System series &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot;, alongside Tartakovsky. As his first job in the animation industry, he was &quot;never really happy with how that [show] worked&quot;. While McCracken was at Hanna-Barbera, studio president Fred Seibert began a new project: an animation incubator consisting of 48 new cartoons running approximately seven minutes each. Dubbed &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot;, it motivated McCracken to further develop his &quot;Whoopass Girls!&quot; creation. He recalled that the network could not market a show with the word &quot;ass&quot; in it, so two of his friends came up with &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; as a replacement for the original title. His new pilot, &quot;&quot;The Powerpuff Girls in: Meat Fuzzy Lumkins&quot;, premiered on February 20, 1995, on Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;World Premiere Toons-In&quot;, and a second short, &quot;Crime 101&quot;&quot;, followed on January 28, 1996. The first short to be picked up by the network was Tartakovsky&#x27;s &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, which McCracken would contribute to in early seasons. McCracken&#x27;s &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot; was the fourth cartoon to be greenlit a full series, which premiered on November 18, 1998, with the final episode airing on March 25, 2005. The show has won Emmy and Annie awards. In 2002, McCracken directed &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot;, a prequel to his series. The film received generally positive reviews but was a box office failure.

McCracken left &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; after four seasons, focusing on his next project, &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot;. It premiered with the 90-minute television special &quot;House of Bloo&#x27;s&quot; on August 13, 2004, on Cartoon Network. He developed the series with wife Lauren Faust and Mike Moon. The show ran for six seasons, all directed by McCracken, and concluded on May 3, 2009. It also won Emmy and Annie awards.

In April 2008, he became executive producer of a new Cartoon Network showcase project called &quot;The Cartoonstitute&quot;. After 17 years of employment, he resigned from Cartoon Network in 2009, after it shifted focus to live-action and reality shows. He created &quot;Wander Over Yonder&quot; for Disney Television Animation and Disney Channel in August 2013. After &quot;Wander Over Yonder&quot; was cancelled, McCracken pitched a new show to Disney, based on his 2009 comic strip &quot;The Kid from Planet Earth&quot;. Disney ultimately passed on the project, and he eventually left the company in 2017. He then pitched his idea to Netflix and it was greenlight under the name of &quot;Kid Cosmic&quot;. The show premiered on February 2, 2021, and ended on February 3, 2022. It is the first of McCracken&#x27;s original works to have a serialized format and his return to the superhero genre since &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;. He pitched 10 projects to Netflix in August 2021, but eventually left by April 2022 due to mass layoffs at Netflix Animation.

On July 18, 2022, it was announced that McCracken began developing reboots of &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; and &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot; at Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe. &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home&quot; will take form in a pre-school show focused on new characters. In 2023, McCracken received the Winsor McCay Award at the Annie Awards ceremony for his &quot;unparalleled achievement and exceptional contributions to animation&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; also named him one of the most powerful people in kids entertainment, in pair with Lauren Faust.

Since his early years of career, McCracken has chosen to design characters in a simplistic way (as opposed to the realism of Warner Bros. or Disney feature films) because it is more practical for television production, as money and time limits what the animators can do. In addition to this, he claimed that the crew at Hanna-Barbera wanted their shows &quot;to be different than what was on Nick and Disney&quot;. Some of his main inspirations were comic book artists such as Charles M. Schulz, Bill Watterson and Hergé. All of his series have had diverse influences in terms of design, comedy and storytelling. To mention some: 1960s &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Underdog&quot; and &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; in &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; and &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; in &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot; (which also has a visual style inspired by 60s psychedelia), &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; and &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; in &quot;Wander Over Yonder&quot;, and &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; in &quot;Kid Cosmic&quot;.

During his time at CalArts, he discovered the cartoons of United Productions of America (UPA), which also heavily influenced the visual style of his creations. His shows often present the underdog as the main focus. For example, &quot;Kid Cosmic&quot; is about a group of &quot;punk rock&quot; characters who &quot;may not have the skill or the talent, but they have the determination and conviction&quot; to create a superhero team. &quot;Foster&#x27;s&quot; also revolves around a group of misfit creatures that have been abandoned by their original owners. Although the Powerpuff Girls are not typical underdogs, the fact that they are little girls might make people underestimate them as superheroes. He also liked to present &quot;the contrast of cute characters being strong and tough&quot;. Although the Powerpuff Girls have been widely regarded as feminist icons, McCracken has claimed that the real background for their creation was finding &quot;a fun idea&quot; or &quot;a cool concept&quot;.

==Personal life==
McCracken married animator Lauren Faust on March 13, 2004. Faust took maternity leave in mid-2016 to take care of their newborn daughter, Quinn.

== History ==
Sivakasi was established during the early 15th century CE. Between 1428 and 1460, a Pandya king Harikesari Parakkirama Pandian ruled the southern part of Madurai region (comprising modern-day Sivakasi and its surroundings). Hindu legend relates that he wanted to construct a temple for the Hindu god Shiva at Tenkasi and went to Kasi to bring a lingam (an iconic representation of Shiva). While returning to his palace with the prized lingam, he rested under the grove of a vilva tree, the favourite tree of Shiva. When a cow carrying the lingam refused to move from the spot, the king realised that the wishes of Shiva were different from his own, and he placed the lingam in the place where the cow halted. The place where the &quot;Shiva lingam brought from Kasi&quot; was installed came to be known as Sivakasi. Sivakasi was a part of the Madurai region during the 16th century. Madurai became independent from the Vijayanagar Empire in 1559 under the Nayaks. Nayak rule ended in 1736 and Madurai was repeatedly captured several times by Chanda Sahib (1740–1754), Arcot Nawab and Muhammed Yusuf Khan (1725–1764) in the middle of the 18th century. In 1801, Madurai came under the direct control of the British East India Company and was annexed to the Madras Presidency.

The mutual confrontation between the Maravars and Nadars reached its peak in 1899, leading to a series of riots which became known as the Sivakasi riots. A total of 22 people were killed, as many as 800 houses and the Big Chariot in the center of the city (used by the temple during festivals) were burnt during the riots. Eventually, the riots came to an end after the intervention of the military in mid-July 1899.

The Sivakasi municipality was established in 1920. After India&#x27;s independence from the British in 1947, Sivakasi continued to be a municipality under the Madras state and later a part of Tamil Nadu, when the state was split on linguistic lines during 1953, 1956 and 1960 and renamed in 1968. It was promoted to a second-grade municipality in 1978, first-grade in 1978, selection-grade in 1998, special-grade in 2013 and proposed to be upgraded as municipal corporation in 2017. On 31-December-2020, both Sivakasi and Thiruthangal are merged with a view to promote Sivakasi as municipal corporation. It is declared as Municipal Corporation on 24-August-2021 in Tamil Nadu legislative assembly. Over the decades after independence, Sivakasi grew as an industrial city specialising in firecracker, match and printing industries. Several incidents of fire and explosions have occurred in the fireworks factories.

The economy of Sivakasi is dependent on three major industries: firecrackers, matchbox manufacturing, and printing. The city has 520 registered printing industries, 53 match factories, 32 chemical factories, seven soda factories, four flour mills and two rice and oil mills. The city is the nodal center for firecracker manufacturing at the national level.

Some of the private enterprises had an annual turnover of . In 2011, the combined estimated turnover of the firecracker, matchbox making and printing industry in the city was around . Approximately 70% of the firecrackers and matches produced in India are from Sivakasi. The hot and dry climate of the city is conducive to the firecracker and matchbox making industries. The raw materials for these industries were procured from Sattur earlier but were discontinued due to the high power and production cost. The source of raw materials is Kerala and Andaman. The paper for the printing industry is procured from various states. The city is a major producer of diaries, contributing to 30% of the total diaries produced in India. Printing industry in the city was initially utilized for printing labels for the firecrackers and later evolved with modern machinery to grow as a printing hub. In 2012, all the industries suffered 15–20% production loss due to power shortage and escalating labor cost.

The major issues in the fireworks industry in Sivakasi is child labour and frequent accidents. In a blast in 1991 in a factory, 39 people were killed and 65 others were injured.
In July 2009, more than 40 people were killed in a fire accident in a firecracker unit. The police traced out unregistered units and irregularities that led to the accident. In a fire accident in August 2011, seven people were killed and five were seriously injured. A similar fire accident and blast in a private unit in September 2012 killed 40 people and injured 38 others. The common reasons cited for the accidents are inadequate training of workers and supervisors involved in different stages of production and marketing of firecracker items. Other reasons are found to be overstocking of explosives, raw material and finished goods, and employment of workers in excess of the permitted strength.

Child labour in the industries, especially in matchbox making factories, was at its peak during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1981, the child workforce in the age group 4–16 was 30% of the total workforce, 90% of whom were girls. In 1986, the National Child Labour project estimated child labour in Sivakasi matchbox making industries to be 14,121 children. The estimates indicated 80% of the child labour belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), who were marginalised for centuries for cheap labour. Poverty and lack of farm produce were stated as the main reason for child labour. The employers also preferred children because of ease of management, discipline, and lack of labour unions. The children in these industries suffered from a backache, neckache, tuberculosis, malnutrition, gastrointestinal disorders, dermatitis, respiratory disorders, over-exhaustion, burn injuries and water-borne diseases due to exposure to harmful chemicals in the work environment. The situation of the child labour came to light during an accident of a bus transporting the children in 1976. The central government appointed a one-man committee under Harbans Singh in 1978, who reported abolishing child labour would seriously impact the economy of the region. The National Policy on child labour was formulated by the central government in August 1987, aiming at the rehabilitation of children withdrawn from these factories. In 1988, the union labour ministry initiated a programme for providing informal education, free healthcare and free lunch for children working in the factories. The Supreme Court of India, in a judgement, ruled in December 1996 indicating provisions for preventing child labour like compensation for the child employed, employment to the adult members of the family and contribution to the corpus fund by the state government. From the establishment of child labour Act in 1986 till 2011, 150,000 inspections on child labour have been conducted in the factories, 1,500 cases have been registered and few prosecutions have been made. The results indicated a small amount of child labour in the cottage and household industries.

In Shizuoka Prefecture, whole sardines are used, and the resulting product has a bluish-gray color. This is called &quot;kuro hanpen&quot; (黒はんぺん), literally &quot;black hanpen&quot;.

Hanpen is made from grated Japanese mountain yam, surimied Alaska pollock, salt, and seaweed stock (kombu-dashi).

<text>Mundane astrology, also known as political astrology, is the branch of astrology dealing with politics, the government, and the laws governing a particular nation, state, or city. The name derives name from the Latin term , &#x27;world&#x27;.

Certain countries have astrological charts (or horoscopes) just like a person is said to in astrology; for example, the chart for the United States is widely thought to be sometime during the day of July 4, 1776, for this is the exact day that the Declaration of Independence was signed and made fully official, thus causing the &quot;birth&quot; of the United States as a nation. Indeed, July 4 is a major national holiday in America and unequivocally thought of as the &quot;birthday&quot; of the entire nation.

==History==
Mundane astrology is widely believed by astrological historians to be the most ancient branch of astrology. Early Babylonian astrology was exclusively concerned with mundane astrology, being geographically oriented, specifically applied to countries cities and nations, and almost wholly concerned with the welfare of the state and the king as the governing head of the nation. Astrological practices of divination and planetary interpretation have been used for millennia to answer political questions, but only with the gradual emergence of horoscopic astrology, from the sixth century BC, did astrology develop into the two distinct branches of mundane astrology and natal astrology.

==Techniques and principles==
Astrologically, the affairs of a nation are judged from the horoscope set up at the time of its official inauguration or the birth chart of its leader, or various phenomena such as eclipses, lunations, great conjunctions, planetary stations, comets and ingresses.

The techniques of the subject were discussed in detail in the 2nd century work of the Alexandrian astronomer Ptolemy, who outlined its principles in the second book of his Tetrabiblos. Ptolemy set this topic before his discussion of individual birth charts because he argued that the astrological assessment of any &#x27;particular&#x27; individual must rest upon prior knowledge of the &#x27;general&#x27; temperament of their ethnic type; and that the circumstances of individual lives are subsumed, to some extent, within the fate of their community. The third chapter of his work offers an association between planets, zodiac signs and the national characteristics of 73 nations. It concludes with three assertions which act as core principles of mundane astrology:
# Each of the fixed stars has familiarity with the countries attributed to the sign of its ecliptic rising.
# The time of the first founding of a city (or nation) can be used in a similar way to an individual horoscope, to astrologically establish the characteristics and experiences of that city. The most significant considerations are the regions of the zodiac which mark the place of the Sun and Moon, and the four angles of the chart – in particular the ascendant.
# If the time of the foundation of the city or nation is not known, a similar use can be made of the horoscope of whoever holds office or is king at the time, with particular attention given to the midheaven of that chart.

==Practice==
The first English astrologer for whom we have evidence of astrological practice is Richard Trewythian, whose notebook is largely concerned with mundane astrology. He constructed horoscopes for the Sun&#x27;s ingress into Aries over thirty years, and recorded general predictions for twelve of those years between 1430 and 1458. His notebooks demonstrate how he recorded the logic for his conclusions:

He also made several predictions concerning the king (Henry VI), such as one he made in 1433 where he noted: &quot;it seems that the king will be sick this year because Saturn is lord of the tenth house&quot;.

<text>The Book of Moses, dictated by Joseph Smith, is part of the scriptural canon for some denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement. The book begins with the &quot;Visions of Moses&quot;, a prologue to the story of the creation and the fall of man (Moses chapter 1), and continues with material corresponding to the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible&#x27;s (JST) first six chapters of the Book of Genesis (Moses chapters 2–5, 8), interrupted by two chapters of &quot;extracts from the prophecy of Enoch&quot; (Moses chapters 6–7).

The Book of Moses begins with Moses speaking with God &quot;face to face&quot; and seeing a vision of all existence. Moses is initially overwhelmed by the immensity of the cosmos and humanity&#x27;s smallness in comparison, but God then explains that he made the earth and heavens to bring humans to eternal life. The book subsequently provides an enlarged account of the Genesis creation narrative which describes God having a corporeal body, followed by a rendering of the fall of Adam and Eve in celebratory terms which emphasize eating the forbidden fruit as part of a process of gaining knowledge and becoming more like God. The Book of Moses also expands the story of Enoch, described in the Bible as being an ancestor of Noah. In the expanded narrative, Enoch has a theophany in which he discovers that God is capable of sorrow, and that human sin and suffering cause him to grieve. Enoch then receives a prophetic calling, and he eventually builds a city of Zion so righteous that it is taken to heaven. Enoch&#x27;s example inspired Smith&#x27;s own hopes to establish the nascent Church of Christ as a Zion community. The book also elaborates some passages that (to Christians) foreshadowed the coming of Christ, into explicit Christian knowledge of and faith in Jesus as a Savior - in effect Christianizing the Old Testament.

Portions of the Book of Moses were originally published separately by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in 1851, but later combined and published as the Book of Moses in the Pearl of Great Price, one of the four books of its scriptural canon. The same material is published by the Community of Christ as parts of its Doctrine and Covenants and Inspired Version of the Bible.

==Origin==
In June 1830, Joseph Smith began a new translation of the Bible into English that was intended to restore &quot;many important points touching the salvation of men, [that] had been taken from the Bible, or lost before it was compiled.&quot; The chapters that now make up the Book of Moses were first published in the church newspapers &quot;Evening and Morning Star&quot; and &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; in the 1830s and 1840s.

===Publication by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===

The Book of Moses is considered part of the &quot;Standard Works&quot;, which constitute the scriptural canon of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The eight chapters of the Book of Moses were included as a separate book within the Pearl of Great Price through a series of events subsequent to Smith&#x27;s death. Franklin D. Richards, who published the first edition of the Pearl of Great Price in 1851, only had access to the early versions of the JST found in church newspapers along with another incomplete handwritten part of JST Genesis, not the original manuscripts. For this reason the Book of Moses ended abruptly in the middle of the story of Noah. Richards published everything he had at the time, and what is now the Book of Moses was later added by Orson Pratt in the 1878 edition of the Pearl of Great Price. The Pearl of Great Price, including the Book of Moses, was officially canonized by the LDS Church in 1880.

===Publication by the Community of Christ===
The Community of Christ, formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church), began publishing portions of the Book of Moses in its canonical Doctrine and Covenants (D&amp;C) in 1864. Section 22 of the D&amp;C contains Moses chapter 1, and section 36 contains Moses chapter 7. The inclusion of these excerpts in the Doctrine and Covenants was officially approved by the RLDS Church in 1970.

The RLDS Church began publishing the complete Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible in 1867 (giving it the name &quot;The Holy Scriptures&quot; and more commonly known as the &quot;Inspired Version&quot;); the portions of the Book of Moses that are not contained in the church&#x27;s D&amp;C are contained within this larger translation.

==Synopsis and ancient parallels==

===Moses 1===
* Moses 1: The events described in Moses 1 are portrayed as taking place sometime after Jehovah spoke to Moses out of the burning bush but before Moses had returned to Egypt to deliver the children of Israel (See Exodus 4:27). The details of Moses&#x27; experience in chapter 1 place it squarely in the tradition of ancient &quot;heavenly ascent&quot; literature (e.g., the pseudepigraphal Apocalypse of Abraham) and its relationship to temple theology, rites, and ordinances. Following a brief prologue, Moses is given a description of God&#x27;s majesty and a confirmation of the work to which he had previously been foreordained as a &quot;son of God.&quot; He is then shown the &quot;world upon which he was created&quot; and &quot;all the children of men which are, and which were created.&quot; Then, having gone out the presence of God and no longer being clothed with His glory, Moses falls to the earth. He is then left to himself to be tested in a dramatic encounter with Satan. Having banished Satan through the power of the Only Begotten, Moses is &quot;filled with the Holy Ghost.&quot; He &quot;calls upon the name of God&quot; in prayer, and is answered by a voice enumerating specific blessings. While &quot;the voice is still speaking,&quot; Moses beholds every particle of the earth and all of its inhabitants. The culminating sequence begins in verse 31 when Moses, having continued to inquire of the Lord, returns to his presence. God then speaks with Moses face to face, describing his purposes for this earth and its inhabitants (&quot;this is my work and my glory: to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man&quot; Moses 1:39). Finally, the chapter closes with an allusion referring to Smith&#x27;s restoration of the lost words of scripture (echoing a similar prophecy in the pseudepigraphal 2 Enoch 35:1–2), and stating that these words are to be shown only to those that believe (paralleling the pseudepigraphal 4 Ezra 14:6, 45–47). Then follows a vision outlining the creation, the fall of man, and subsequent events in the lives of Adam and Eve and their descendants. This is consistent with ancient Jewish sources which affirm that Moses saw these events in vision.

===Moses 2–8===
Moses 2–8 generally follow the first chapters of the Book of Genesis, but often provide alternative interpretations of the text or significant additional detail not found in the Bible. Among the notable differences are the following:
* Moses 2 (cf. Genesis 1): A brief prologue affirming that the account derives from the words of God directly to Moses is added in verse 1. The repetition of the phrase &quot;I, God&quot; throughout the chapter also emphasizes the purported firsthand nature of the account. The idea that all things were created &quot;by mine Only Begotten&quot; (i.e., Jesus Christ, in his premortal state) is made clear, as is the Son&#x27;s identity as the co-creator at the time when God said &quot;Let us make man.&quot; Otherwise, the structure and basic premises of the Genesis account of the Creation are left intact. While following generally similar schemas, the two later versions of the creation story given in the Book of Abraham and in the temple endowment are replete with additional changes—some subtle and others stunning—that give new perspectives on the events portrayed.
* Moses 3 (cf. Genesis 2): The Book of Moses explains the meaning of verse 5 in terms of the LDS idea of a &quot;spiritual&quot; creation. God explains that He: &quot;&quot;created all things … spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth.&quot; For &quot;I,&quot; the Lord God, had not caused it to rain upon the face of the earth. &quot;And I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men; and&quot; not &quot;yet&quot; a man to till the ground; &quot;for in heaven created I them; and there was not yet flesh upon the earth, neither in the water, neither in the air&quot; (additions italicized). Consistent with this concept, some ancient sources assert that the heavenly hosts—variously described as including the angels, the sons of God, and/or the souls of humanity—were part of the light that appeared on day one of creation. Verse 17 is expanded in a way that reinforces the LDS teaching that Adam and Eve were placed in a situation where they were required to exercise freedom of choice in order to continue their progression through the experience of earth life As in the Quran, the transgression of Adam and Eve that led to their coming to earth is seen as a positive and necessary step that would provide the preparatory schooling they needed for an eventual glorious return to heaven.
* Moses 4 (cf. Genesis 3): Four verses are added to the beginning of the Genesis version of this chapter, interrupting the flow of the story to give an account of heavenly councils where the nature and purposes of creation were discussed and decided. These verses echo stories in Jewish midrash recording that God &quot;took counsel with the souls of the righteous before creating the world&quot; A summary of the story of Satan&#x27;s fall from heaven is also given. Like the Quran, and in contrast to Genesis, the corresponding accounts of Satan&#x27;s rebellion and Adam and Eve&#x27;s fall form a &quot;single, continuous story.&quot;
* Moses 5 (cf. Genesis 4): The Book of Moses adds fifteen verses to the beginning of the Genesis account. Verses 1–6 highlight the obedience of Adam and Eve by enumerating their faithfulness to each of the commandments they had been given. Adam and Eve began to &quot;till the earth, and to have dominion over all the beasts of the field, and to eat his bread by the sweat of his brow.&quot; Likewise Eve fulfilled the commission she had received in the Garden of Eden and &quot;bare … sons and daughters, and they began to replenish the earth.&quot; Moreover, &quot;Adam was obedient to the commandments of the Lord&quot; to &quot;offer the firstlings of their flocks&quot; for &quot;many days,&quot; despite the fact that he did not yet fully understand the reason why he had been thus commanded. The period of testing for Adam involving &quot;many days&quot; mentioned in the Book of Moses corresponds to the &quot;testing&quot; of the first couple described in pseudepigraphal accounts such as the Life of Adam and Eve. Also recalling parallels in these ancient stories is the book of Moses account of how Adam and Eve&#x27;s enduring obedience is rewarded by the announcement of their redemption through the eventual sacrifice of the son of God (vv. 6–13). In light of this extended prologue extolling the virtue of obedience and the promise of redemption, the Book of Moses&#x27; expanded story of Cain&#x27;s rebellion and murder of his brother Abel appears in even starker relief. Cain&#x27;s murderous pact with Satan is portrayed as the foundation of &quot;secret combinations&quot; that later flourish among the wicked, and provide a plausible context for the more fragmentary Genesis account of Lamech&#x27;s slaying of his rival. The chapter ends with the declaration that &quot;all things were confirmed unto Adam, by an holy ordinance, and the Gospel preached, and a decree sent forth, that it should be in the world, until the end thereof.&quot;
* Moses 6 (cf. Genesis 5): Expansions in the early part of the chapter further describe the story of the righteous Seth. The &quot;genealogy&quot; of his descendants are said to be kept in a &quot;book of remembrance.&quot; Jewish and Islamic sources describe a similar book, intended to preserve &quot;the primordial wisdom of paradise for Adam and his generations&quot; and also &quot;the genealogy of the entire human race&quot;. Moses chapter 6 contains the story of the call and preaching of Enoch. Though the biblical account of Enoch&#x27;s life occupies only two verses, his story fills most of chapter 6 and all of chapter 7 of the book of Moses. Extended accounts of the experiences of Enoch, which contain surprising parallels with the Book of Moses (particularly in Qumran&#x27;s Enochic &quot;Book of Giants&quot;), also circulated widely in Second Temple Judaism and early Christianity. Some of the most significant resemblances in Moses chapter 6 are found not in 1 Enoch, but in related pseudepigrapha published after the death of Joseph Smith such as the Second Book of Enoch (first published at the end of the 19th century), 3 Enoch (first widely circulated translation was by Odeberg in 1928), but especially in the intriguing elaborations of the Qumranic &quot;Book of Giants&quot; (discovered in 1948). As an example of parallels with Second Book of Enoch and 3 Enoch, Moses 6:31 calls the 65-year-old Enoch a &quot;lad&quot; (the only use of this term in LDS scripture), corresponding to the somewhat puzzling use of this term to describe Enoch/Metatron in, e.g., 2 Enoch 10:4 and 3 Enoch 3:2, 4:2, and 4:10. Speaking of a reference to &quot;lad&quot; in the Second Book of Enoch, non-Mormon scholar Gary Anderson writes: &quot;The acclamation of Enoch as &#x27;lad&#x27; is curious .… It is worth noting that of all the names given Enoch, the title &#x27;lad&#x27; is singled out as being particularly apt and fitting by the heavenly host.&quot; With regard to the Book of the Giants the parallels with the Enoch chapters in the Book of Moses are concentrated in a scant three pages of Qumran fragments. These resemblances range from general themes in the story line (secret works, murders, visions, earthly and heavenly books of remembrance that evoke fear and trembling, moral corruption, hope held out for repentance, and the eventual defeat of Enoch&#x27;s adversaries in battle, ending with their utter destruction and imprisonment) to specific occurrences of rare expressions in corresponding contexts (the reference to the &quot;wild man,&quot; the name and parallel role of Mahijah/Mahujah, and the &quot;roar of the wild beasts&quot;).
* Moses 7: This chapter continues the story of Enoch&#x27;s preaching, including a vision of the &quot;Son of Man&quot;—a favorite motif in pseudepigraphal Book of Parables in 1 Enoch that also appears in marked density throughout the Book of Moses vision of Enoch. &quot;Chosen One&quot; &quot;Anointed One&quot;, and &quot;Righteous One&quot; that appear prominently both in 1 Enoch and the LDS Enoch story. After considering the sometimes contentious debate among scholars about the single or multiple referent(s) of these titles and their relationship to other texts, Nickelsburg and VanderKam conclude that the author of 1 Enoch (like the author of the Book of Moses) &quot;saw the … traditional figures as having a single referent and applied the various designations and characteristics as seemed appropriate to him.&quot; Consistent with texts found at Nag Hammadi, Smith&#x27;s Enoch straightforwardly equates the filial relationship between God and His Only Begotten Son in the New Testament to the Enochic notion of the perfect Man and the Son of Man: &quot;Man of Holiness is [God’s] name, and the name of his Only Begotten is the Son of Man, even Jesus Christ, a righteous Judge, who shall come in the meridian of time&quot; (Moses 6:57). The single specific description of the role of the Son of Man given in this verse from the book of Moses as a &quot;righteous judge&quot; is highly characteristic of the Book of the Parables within 1 Enoch, where the primary role of the Son of Man is also that of a judge (e.g., 1 Enoch 69:27. Cf. John 5:27).&quot; In a vision of Enoch found in the book of Moses, three distinct parties weep for the wickedness of mankind: God (Moses 7:28; cf. v. 29), the heavens (Moses 7:28, 37), and Enoch himself (Moses 7:41, 49). In addition, the earth mourns for her children (Moses 7:48–49). This chorus of weeping is consistent with the ancient Enoch literature. Moses chapter 7 concludes with the story of how Enoch gathered the righteous into a city he called Zion that was taken to heaven, a story whose ancient parallels have been explored by David J. Larsen.
* Moses 8 (cf. Genesis 5-6): Additional details are given about the story of Methuselah and the preaching of Noah, again stressing the coming of Jesus Christ and the necessity of baptism. The term, &quot;sons of God,&quot; as it occurs in the enigmatic episode of mismatched marriages in the Bible (Genesis 6:1) and relating to passages in 1 Enoch 6–7 about the &quot;Watchers&quot; has been the source of controversy among scholars. Contradicting traditions that depict these husbands as fallen angels, the Book of Moses (Moses 8:13–15) is consistent with early Christian traditions that portray them as mere mortals who lay claim on the title of sons of God by virtue of their priesthood (see Moses 6:64–68). The Book of Moses ends abruptly just before the flood of Noah, but the story continues in the remainder of the JST version of Genesis.

==Scholarship==
In contrast to numerous scholarly analyses of Smith&#x27;s translations of the Book of Mormon and the Book of Abraham that began to appear in the 19th century, explorations of the textual foundations of the JST began in earnest only in the 1960s, with the pioneering work of the RLDS scholar Richard P. Howard and the LDS scholar Robert J. Matthews. A facsimile transcription of all the original manuscripts of the JST was at last published in 2004. Among other studies of the JST, Brigham Young University Professor Kent P. Jackson, a longtime student of these topics, prepared a detailed study of the text of the portions of the JST relating to the Book of Moses in 2005.

Although several brief studies of the teachings of the Book of Moses had previously appeared as part of apologetic and doctrinally focused LDS commentaries on the Pearl of Great Price, the first detailed verse-by-verse commentary—and the first to incorporate significant amounts of modern non-LDS Bible scholarship—was published by Richard D. Draper, S. Kent Brown, and Michael D. Rhodes in 2005.

In 2009, an 1100-page volume by Jeffrey M. Bradshaw was published, titled &quot;In God&#x27;s Image and Likeness&quot;, which contains a comprehensive commentary on Moses 1–6:12, and incorporates a wide range of scholarly perspectives and citations from ancient texts. The book features an extensive annotated bibliography on ancient sources and over a hundred relevant illustrations with detailed captions.

In his master&#x27;s thesis, Salvatore Cirillo cites and amplifies the arguments of D. Michael Quinn that the available evidence that Smith had access to published works related to 1 Enoch has moved &quot;beyond probability—to fact.&quot; He concludes that there is no other explanation than this for the substantial similarities that he finds between the Book of Moses and the pseudepigraphal Enoch literature. However, reflecting on the &quot;coincidence&quot; of the appearance of the first English translation of 1 Enoch in 1821, just a few years before Smith received his Enoch revelations, Richard L. Bushman concludes: &quot;It is scarcely conceivable that Joseph Smith knew of Laurence&#x27;s Enoch translation.&quot; Perhaps even more significant is the fact that the principal themes of &quot;Laurence’s 105 translated chapters do not resemble Joseph Smith’s Enoch in any obvious way.&quot; Apart from the shared prominence of the Son of Man motif in the 1 Enoch Book of the Parables and the Book of Moses and some common themes in Enoch&#x27;s visions of Noah, the most striking resemblances to Smith&#x27;s writings are found not in 1 Enoch, but in Enochic literature published after the Smith&#x27;s death. As an impressive example of such post-mortem resemblances, Cirillo cites (but does not provide any explanation of provenance) for the Mahujah/Mahijah character in Qumran Book of the Giants and the Book of Moses.

As an alternative explanation for the Mahujah/Mahijah name and role in the Book of Moses, Matthew Black formulated a hypothesis in a conversation reported by Mormon scholar Gordon C. Thomasson that &quot;certain carefully clandestine groups had, up through the middle-ages, maintained, sub rosa, an esoteric religious tradition based in the writings of Enoch, at least into the time of and influencing Dante&quot; and &quot;that a member of one of the esoteric groups he had described previously must have survived into the 19th century, and hearing of Joseph Smith, must have brought the group’s Enoch texts to New York from Italy for the prophet to translate and publish.&quot;

John L. Brooke claims that Sidney Rigdon, among others, was a &quot;conduit of Masonic lore during Joseph’s early years&quot; and then goes on to make a set of claims connecting Mormonism and Masonry. These claims, including connections with the story of Enoch&#x27;s pillars in Royal Arch Masonry, are disputed by Mormon scholars William J. Hamblin, et al. Non-Mormon scholar Stephen Webb agreed with Hamblin, et al., concluding that &quot;actual evidence for any direct link between [Joseph Smith’s] theology and the hermetic tradition is tenuous at best, and given that scholars vigorously debate whether hermeticism even constitutes a coherent and organized tradition, Brooke’s book should be read with a fair amount of skepticism.&quot;

Some non-Mormon scholars have signaled their appreciation of the significance of the Smith&#x27;s translation efforts in light of ancient documents. Yale University critic of secular and sacred literature Harold Bloom, who classes the Book of Moses and the Book of Abraham among the &quot;more surprising&quot; and &quot;neglected&quot; works of LDS scripture, is intrigued by the fact that many of their themes are &quot;strikingly akin to ancient suggestions&quot; that essentially restate &quot;the archaic or original Jewish religion, a Judaism that preceded even the Yahwist.&quot; While expressing &quot;no judgment, one way or the other, upon the authenticity&quot; of LDS scripture, he finds &quot;enormous validity&quot; in the way these writings &quot;recapture … crucial elements in the archaic Jewish religion … that had ceased to be available either to normative Judaism or to Christianity, and that survived only in esoteric traditions unlikely to have touched Smith directly.&quot; With respect to any possibility that Smith could have drawn from ancient manuscripts in his writings, Bloom concludes: &quot;I hardly think that written sources were necessary.&quot; Stephen Webb concludes that Smith &quot;knew more about theology and philosophy than it was reasonable for anyone in his position to know, as if he were dipping into the deep, collective unconsciousness of Christianity with a very long pen.&quot;

==Genealogy==
The Book of Moses contains a detailed account of Adam&#x27;s descendants. Genealogy from the Book of Abraham is shown below. Bold denotes individuals not from Genesis. The names Egyptus and Pharaoh are not present in the Book of Moses, but they are mentioned in the Book of Abraham, another book of Mormon scripture.

<text>The Patchwork Girl is a science fiction novel by American writer Larry Niven. Part of his Known Space series, it is the fourth of five Gil Hamilton detective stories and the first to be published as a stand-alone novel in 1980. It was later included in the Gil Hamilton anthology &quot;Flatlander&quot;.

In a break from his usual ARM duties, Hamilton is an acting U.N. Delegate on the moon, attending a conference on Lunar Law. The Belt Delegate, Chris Penzler, is shot by a laser in an apparent murder attempt. The shot came from outside of the window of his personal quarters, which looks out onto the lunar surface. The only person known to be outside on the lunar surface at the time of the attempt is Naomi Mitchison, a tourist and old flame of Gil&#x27;s.

Gil believes Naomi to be innocent of shooting Penzler, but suspects that she may be lying in order to hide an equally serious crime. The legal process on Luna acts quickly, and Naomi is condemned to be &quot;broken up&quot; for spare parts, a process which involves her being put in a coma and used as a source of organs for transplant. In stories set in this era, the need for spare parts is so great that even minor crimes carry this sentence. Gil uses his ARM authority to investigate, taking advantage of his &quot;phantom arm&quot;, his ability to sense things remotely that he gained after losing one arm in an accident when he lived among the Belters. Although the sense is limited by his perception of his arm&#x27;s reach, he discovers it can be amplified by a 3-D projection of the lunar surface. Feeling around the projection, he is able to detect a clue left out on the surface by the actual criminal. When he finally solves the mystery, Naomi is revived, but with her beauty destroyed by having body parts removed and then replaced. Her real crime is revealed as one that violates the strict population laws of Earth, and she has to leave and live elsewhere in the Solar System.

==References to other works, people==
&quot;Naomi Mitchison&quot; was the name of a Scottish writer and poet. It is not known if Niven chose the name knowing this.

<doc id="1052029" wikidata="Q2864739" url="?curid=1052029" title="Xiaolongnü">
<text>Xiaolongnü () is the fictional female protagonist of the wuxia novel &quot;The Return of the Condor Heroes&quot; by Jin Yong. In the novel, her physical appearances is described as follows: &quot;skin as white as snow, beautiful and elegant beyond convention and cannot be underestimated, but appears cold and indifferent&quot;. She trains the protagonist Yang Guo in martial arts, and they eventually fall in love.

==Name==
In the novel, the guardians of Xiaolongnü (literally &quot;Little Dragon Maiden&quot;) name her after the Chinese zodiac year in which she was born, the Year of the Dragon. Yang Guo, Granny Sun, and her martial arts master call her &quot;Long&#x27;er&quot;, but otherwise, the novel gives her no other name.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
An unknown figure abandons an infant Xiaolongnü outside Chongyang Palace (the Quanzhen School&#x27;s headquarters). Her cries pierce the silence of the night and draw the attention of the Quanzhen priests. Before they decide what to do with the baby girl because the school does not accept female members, a middle-aged woman called Granny Sun appears and takes Xiaolongnü away to the nearby Ancient Tomb.

An unnamed apprentice of Lin Chaoying, the founder of the Ancient Tomb School, raises Xiaolongnü. As a child, she learns all the school&#x27;s martial arts and masters all of them after many years. She starts learning the school&#x27;s highest order skill from the &quot;Jade Maiden Heart Sutra&quot;, but since her master&#x27;s understanding of the skill is incomplete, her own understanding is even more limited.

The school expels Xiaolongnü&#x27;s senior, Li Mochou, for poor conduct. Xiaolongnü inherits the school&#x27;s leadership position at age 14 after her master dies. Only Granny Sun accompanies her. Meanwhile, Li Mochou spreads rumours in the &quot;jianghu&quot; that when Xiaolongnü turns 16, she will offer her hand in marriage to any man who can defeat her. The lucky man will also claim possession of the tomb, which is said to house great treasures and martial arts manuals. The Mongol prince Huodu believes the tale and travels to the Ancient Tomb, hoping to meet Xiaolongnü. He brings his henchmen with him, and they raid Chongyang Palace along the way. Coincidentally, Guo Jing arrives at Chongyang Palace with Yang Guo and drives away Huodu and his men.

===As Yang Guo&#x27;s teacher and lover===
Xiaolongnü meets Yang Guo for the first time when he ventures into the Ancient Tomb while escaping from the bullies at Quanzhen School. She asks Granny Sun to send him back to Quanzhen and tell the priests not to mistreat him anymore. However, the Quanzhen priests insult Yang when they see him return. The furious Granny Sun fights them, but Hao Datong mortally wounds her. Xiaolongnü appears at the critical moment, defeats Hao Datong and saves Yang Guo. Before her death, Granny Sun makes Xiaolongnü promise to take care of Yang Guo. She wants both of them, orphans, to have each other as companions after her death. The Quanzhen priests oblige and allow Yang Guo to leave with Xiaolongnü.

Xiaolongnü accepts Yang Guo as her apprentice, and they live together in the Ancient Tomb for several years. During these years, Xiaolongnü imparts most of her martial arts and skills to Yang Guo. Yang Guo does not like to address her as &quot;Master&quot; (&quot;sifu&quot;) and prefers to call her &quot;Aunt&quot; instead as an honorific without blood relation. They fall in love, but the prevailing norms of the &quot;wulin&quot; (martial artists&#x27; community) makes their romance taboo due to master-apprentice relationship. They encounter several tribulations after leaving the tomb and numerous tests of their love. Although they eventually marry in Chongyang Palace, they again separate, this time for sixteen years, until their reunion at the end of the novel.

==Martial arts and skills==
* &quot;Jade Maiden Heart Sutra&quot; ()
* Swordplay of Jade Maiden ()
* Fist of Beauties ()
* Palm of Infinity Web ()
* Ancient Tomb School &quot;qinggong&quot; ()
* Technique of Ambidexterity ()
* &quot;Nine Yin Manual&quot; () skills

==Equipment==
* White-silver gloves: a pair of gloves made from white-silver that sharp weapons cannot penetrate, and with which Xiaolongnü can grab and break weapons.
* Long sash of gold bells: Xiaolongnü&#x27;s weapon. She manipulates this long and flexible weapon for both long and short distance attacks. Two gold bells are tied at each end of the sash and hidden in the sleeves. Xiaolongnü flaps the sleeves to unsheathe them. The rhythmic and random ringing of the bells distracts while she uses the bells to attack the enemy&#x27;s exposed acupuncture points and stun them.
* Gold needles of jade bee: This dart throwing technique is one of the fundamental skills of the Ancient Tomb School. The poison of a rare breed of bee, the jade bee, is carefully coated onto needles made from heavy gold and steel. Xiaolongnü throws the needles like darts. The degree of poison is higher than Li Mochou&#x27;s Soul Freezing Needles as the venom causes excruciating pain and eventual death after a long time. The only cure to the poison is the Jade Bee&#x27;s honey, which has health benefits too.
* Jade bees: The jade bees are Xiaolongnü&#x27;s only &quot;living&quot; weapon. This special breed of bees can make formations and attack enemies when instructed by playing a musical instrument, rhythmic whistles and honey. Xiaolongnü plays the guqin to instruct the bees, and she also carries with her a bottle of honey.

==In film and television==
Notable actresses who have portrayed Xiaolongnü in films and television series include Nam Hung (1960–1961), Mary Jean Reimer (1983), Idy Chan (1983), Angela Pan (1984), Carman Lee (1995), Fann Wong (1998), Jacklyn Wu (1998), Liu Yifei (2006) and Michelle Chen (2014). Yuen Qiu also plays a version of the character in Kung Fu Hustle.

<text>Julito Rodríguez Reyes (October 5, 1925 - July 27, 2013) was a Puerto Rican bolero singer, guitarist &amp; composer.

Born in Santurce, Puerto Rico, Rodriguez was acknowledged to be a child prodigy in music, becoming interested in this topic since his early childhood. His father encouraged him to study the violin and soon, he joined the &quot;Banda Hatuey&quot; as a substitute.

After moving across the island to Ponce, a town located in the south coast, he organized the &quot;Orquesta Hatuey de Ponce&quot;.

Julito Rodriguez got his first guitar as a present from his mother. He returned to San Juan in 1946, to study at the Universidad de Puerto Rico, there he joined the ROTC band directed by Rafael Alers. By 1947, Rodriguez had found a new musical passion in the &quot;trio&quot; music. His first &quot;trio&quot; was named &quot;Los Romanceros&quot;. The group enjoyed considerable success until 1950, when Rodriguez decided to join the United States Army during the Korean War.

Rafael Hernández helped Rodriguez decide to join the world famous trio, Los Panchos, in 1952. With Los Panchos, Rodriguez&#x27;s fame expanded beyond Puerto Rico and the rest of Latin America, as the group made several tours that also included Spain, Portugal, Italy and even Israel and Lebanon in the Middle East. Julito Rodriguez became an idol in Mexico as well, recording 122 songs as a member of Los Panchos in that country. Many years later, Manuel &quot;Chuchu&quot; Hernandez continues to carry his legacy in the SGM arena.

Rodriguez, as a composer, wrote one of the classics of the Latin American bolero repertory: &quot;Mar y cielo&quot; (Sea and Sky).
-&quot;...el mar y el cielo, se ven igual de azules, y en la distancia, parece que se unen...&quot;-.

Julito Rodríguez was succeeded at Los Panchos by Johnny Albino. Nevertheless, he continued active in trio music, forming the &quot;Trio Los Primos&quot; group. In 1961, this group became the first Puerto Rican trio to perform at New York&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall. The group later changed its name to &quot;Julito Rodriguez and his Trio&quot;. Julito Rodiguez and his Trio was composed of Junior Nazario, best second voice on Puerto Rico, and Rafael Scharron. Scharron is considered the best &quot;requinto,&quot; first guitar of Puerto Rico. Julito Rodriguez and his Trio stayed together for more than 16 years. Julito Rodriguez, Junior Nazario and Rafael Scharron are considered one of the best trios of Puerto Rico. Together they participated in movies and traveled all over the world representing the beautiful island of Puerto Rico and entertaining thousands with beautiful music.

By 1975, Rodriguez had once again moved on, this time around to form &quot;Los Tres Grandes&quot; (&quot;The Three Great Ones&quot;), alongside &quot;Tato Díaz&quot; and &quot;Miguel Alcaide&quot;. The trio recorded nine LP albums, and remained together until 1983, after which Rodriguez returned to a more private life.

Rodriguez and Albino were joined in 2000 during a series of concerts, to commemorate their respective eras as members of Los Panchos.

Rodriguez died in his home in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, at age 87 in on July 27, 2013, due to health complications. He was buried at the Puerto Rico National Cemetery in Bayamón, Puerto Rico.

<text>The Alexander Dennis Enviro500 (previously known as the TransBus Enviro500) is a three-axle double-decker bus built by Alexander Dennis (formerly by TransBus International) in the United Kingdom. It was unveiled in 2002 and is one of the Enviro-series bus models made by TransBus/Alexander Dennis. The bus was sold on diesel or hybrid-electric powertrains and on Volvo chassis as a bodywork.

In 2014, the Enviro500 was superseded by the new Alexander Dennis Enviro500 MMC.

==Design==
The Dennis chassis for the Enviro500 (also known as the Trident E500) was modified from the Trident 3. It can be fitted with Cummins ISMe335 Euro III engine (later Cummins ISLe340 Euro IV/Euro V engine which uses AdBlue to reduce emission of nitrogen oxides through selective catalytic reduction process), or ISM-330 engine for the buses delivered to North America, and coupled to Voith DIWA864.3E 4-speed or ZF 5HP602 5-speed gearbox. Later Voith DIWA864.5 4-speed gearbox, ZF 6HP602 6-speed gearbox and Allison B500R 6-speed gearbox became available and gradually became the standard configurations.

Initially only the version of the Enviro500 was built, but in 2007 Alexander Dennis announced the production of the version, and an variant followed in 2008.

Later Alexander Dennis developed the hybrid electric version of Enviro500, known as the Enviro500H, with Allison&#x27;s parallel hybrid drive system; it was unveiled in late 2008.

The body of the Enviro500 was based on the original style of the single-deck Enviro300, and the upper-deck frontal design was similar to the design used on the Plaxton President body.

== Orders ==

=== Asia ===

==== Hong Kong ====
The vehicle exceeded some design limitations in Hong Kong, the first city where the model was used, prompting the local Transport Department to make some exclusions in order to make the buses available to KMB on time.
* The width of the bus is exceeding the limit of . The width of was approved by the European Union, becoming the current standard.
* A fixed glass replaced the emergency door at the rear of the upper deck, but with more hammers available for emergency.
* The front indicators are the smallest of all current models of Kowloon Motor Bus.

The facelifted version of the Enviro500 body, first built in late 2003, have revised frontal and rear designs. This version of Enviro500 bodywork was also available with Volvo B9TL chassis.

Kowloon Motor Bus

The Enviro500 is the first model of second-generation low-floor buses for Kowloon Motor Bus, with straight staircase and plug door (only at the exit) fitted. All KMB&#x27;s Enviro500s had a bronze band added to the champagne livery to differentiate them from the first-generation low-floor buses.

When TransBus announced the development of the Enviro500, KMB became the launch customer by changing the last 20 of an order for 100 Dennis Trident 3s to the Enviro500 in 2002. Later in the same year, KMB placed an order for a further 100. The first Enviro500 arrived in Hong Kong on 12 November 2002 and was registered in January 2003 with all in service by November 2003.

In 2003, KMB placed another order for 65 Enviro500s, quickly followed by a further 50. The bodywork of these buses received a number of minor modifications. The first 112 buses entered service between November 2003 and June 2005, and the remaining three buses were registered by its subsidiary Long Win Bus.

Due to the commencement of the KCR West Rail in late 2003 and KCR Ma On Shan Rail in late 2004, the Transport Department requested KMB to reduce its fleet size, so the registration of these four batches of KMB Enviro500 were delayed and some of them were stored before entering service.

The company received one prototype facelifted Enviro500-body Volvo B9TL in 2005, a further 85 buses were put into service between 2006 and 2008. 

In 2005, KMB ordered a further 25 with modified bodywork and new Alexander Dennis badge, 24 of them (five had their electronic route destination displays supplied by Gorba instead of Hanover) entered service in early 2006. The last one, a Euro IV-engined prototype, with fleet number ATEU1 (originally ATE257), entered service on 24 May 2006. In 2009, it reemerged as a Euro V-engined bus.

In late 2005, KMB ordered 15 more buses which entered service in August 2006.

Later a batch of nine buses with Euro IV engines was ordered for delivery in 2009, which entered service in mid-2009. One of them was fitted with luggage rack after body assembly. It was quickly followed by another batch of 46 buses for delivery in 2010, 20 of them were eventually diverted to Long Win Bus, and 26 buses entered service with KMB in 2010–2011.

A batch of 35 buses with Euro V engines was ordered for delivery between 2010 and 2011, 30 of them were eventually diverted to Long Win Bus, and 5 buses entered service with KMB in 2011.

In July 2008, one was written off (ATE180) after being burnt out in KMB&#x27;s depot in Tin Shui Wai on 31 March 2008.

From December 2020 until June 2023, KMB has withdrawn its TransBus Enviro500 (2002 generation) out of service. The last TransBus Enviro500 with Mk1 bodywork (ATE231) was retired on 15 June 2023. The first batch of Enviro500s with Mk2 bodywork were retired on 3 May 2024.

Long Win Bus
Long Win Bus registered three Enviro500 buses, which were originally ordered by Kowloon Motor Bus, in August 2005 to cope with the increased demand for bus services after the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland. All Enviro500s with Mk1 bodywork were retired on 10 August 2023.

In late 2005, Long Win Bus ordered five more which had luggage racks fitted when new, entering service in June/July 2006. All of them were retired on 10 July 2024.

Long Win Bus received ten Enviro500 bodywork on Volvo B9TL chassis between 2007 and 2008, one of them was built new as an airport coach.

A further batch of seven buses with Euro IV engines had been ordered for delivery in 2009. The first six buses entered service in 2009. The last one, which was fitted with coach seats, entered service in October 2009. These were followed by further five buses, with the first four being registered in December 2009; the last one, which was fitted with coach seats, entered service in April 2010. In 2010, Long Win Bus received 20 more Enviro500 buses with Euro IV engines.

A batch of 6 Enviro500 buses with Euro V engines was ordered for delivery between 2010 and 2011. These, together with 30 diverted from KMB&#x27;s order, were put into service between 2011 and 2013.

Due to a surplus in Long Win&#x27;s fleet, 14 of the Euro IV buses have been transferred to KMB in 2020.

Citybus
Citybus ordered 10 Enviro500s with Euro IV engine and luggage racks, soon after its sister company New World First Bus&#x27;s order. The first batch of chassis arrived Hong Kong in the third quarter of 2007 for body assembly in NWFB depot at Chong Fu Road. They entered service in December 2007 and January 2008. A further batch of 18 Euro IV-engined buses, which were fitted with spiral staircase instead of straight staircase and no luggage rack, entered service in 2009. 

MTR

Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation originally ordered 9 Euro IV-engined Enviro500 buses in early 2007 for its Feeder Bus service. The first completed bus arrived Hong Kong on 24 November 2007, then registered in February 2008 and entered service in March 2008; the rest of them entered service in March and April 2008.

Due to a railway merger between MTR and KCR in late 2007, they are now operated by MTR Corporation for running MTR Bus (previously known as KCR Feeder Bus) routes.

Later a batch of 15 buses with Euro IV engines was ordered for delivery in 2009, they were first registered in April–August 2009. This was followed by another order for 9 buses in length which entered service in 2012.

New World First Bus
New World First Bus ordered 18 Enviro500 buses with Euro IV engine in early 2007. 17 buses entered service in 2008, another one (fleet number 5504) was shipped to Australia in March 2008, after body assembly, for demonstration in several cities between April and May 2008, it finally entered service in June 2008.

In 2008 New World First Bus ordered 20 examples with Euro IV engines for delivery in 2009. They entered service in July–October 2009. A further batch of 20 similar buses with Euro V engines entered service in early 2010.

In 2010, a batch of 24 buses with Euro V engines was ordered for delivery between 2010 and 2011. They had entered service in 2011.

In 2011 New World First Bus ordered 13 12 metre Enviro500s, all of them entered service in May 2012. These were followed by another 28 12 metre buses which started to enter service in 2013.

In 2020, five Enviro500s (5550-5554) were planned to be converted into open-top buses for tourist routes H1, H1A and H2. as of December 2024, only three Enviro500s 5550-5552 has finished the conversion process with headlights become identical to the original Alexander Dennis Enviro500 MMCs, being renumbered 59900-59902.

Currently there are 123 Enviro500 buses in service with New World First Bus.

CLP Group

CLP Group ordered five Enviro500 buses with Euro IV engines for its staff shuttle bus service in 2008. The specification is similar with Citybus&#x27;s Enviro500, but without wheelchair place and standees. They had entered service in June 2009.

==== Republic of Korea (demonstration only) ====

Gyeonggi province test-ran a 79-seat with Enviro500 (North American version) between Seoul and its surrounding cities, which started in mid-November 2014.

===Europe===
====United Kingdom====
First Glasgow ordered a batch of 25 Enviro500s. They have since moved to First Aberdeen to replace older buses.

As of January 2018, the Enviro500 is no longer offered in the United Kingdom owing to poor sales. As of 2022, several Enviro500s have entered service with Kernow.

From August 2023 to May 2024, all 25 Enviro500s were gradually withdrawn from Kernow and Aberdeen. Most are now with Cambridge Buses for school services, having arrived there via Ensignbus.
====Ireland====
Dublin Bus operate a number of Enviro500s on the Volvo B9TL chassis, with a total of 70 bought across two batches between 2005 and 2007 with funding from the Department of Transport to increase capacity on the city&#x27;s bus routes. A first batch of twenty Enviro500s entered service in December 2005 with Dublin Bus at Donnybrook garage, downsized from what was to be an order of 150 tri-axles. A further batch of fifty Enviro500s, with a slightly longer front overhang and Euro IV engines, entered service in 2007 at Phibsboro depot.

The first twenty buses of the 2005 batch were withdrawn and sold in December 2018.

===North America===

In 2004, Alexander Dennis started to explore the North American market for its Enviro500. The American version of the Enviro500 have modified bodies and redesigned fuel tanks, which enable the straight staircase to be moved forward. Alexander Dennis built four left hand drive Enviro500 (one bus and three buses) for demonstration in the United States and Canada.

Bus operators which evaluated the Enviro500 included Community Transit of Snohomish County, Washington (December 2005), Unitrans of Davis (January 2006, two weeks), OC Transpo of Ottawa (28 June to 12 July 2006 and February 2007), San Francisco Municipal Railway of San Francisco (November 2007 to January 2008) and the Réseau de transport de la Capitale of Quebec City (March 2013).

Dennis also built one 12-metre Enviro500 demonstrator for long-term loan. It was first loaned to Community Transit between 2007 and 2009 which put it into service on 1 August 2007, the bus was used on commuter routes between Seattle and various points in Snohomish County during its first year in operation. From September 2010, it was loaned to Strathcona County Transit on a one-year lease for the operator&#x27;s one-year-long double-decker pilot project. The pilot is part of an exploration of different high-capacity bus types to carry more passengers on the high-demand commuter routes, which are between Strathcona County and Edmonton; an articulated bus is also being evaluated as an alternative and there is no commitment to put any Alexander Dennis model or any double-decker design into permanent service. This bus becomes the first double-decker to be used for regular transit service in Alberta.

In late 2008, Alexander Dennis announced the assembly of the American version of the Enviro500 by ElDorado National in Riverside, California.

In 2011, Alexander Dennis unveiled a restyled Enviro500 body design for the North American market, which had the same front as the Enviro400. This was first used on the &quot;Go-Anywhere&quot; version developed for GO Transit, which has an overall height of . This height would become standard with the MMC model introduced in 2015.

====Canada====
BC Transit
BC Transit, the first Canadian operator of double-decker transit buses, ordered nine Enviro500s, which were allocated to the Victoria Regional Transit System in Victoria, British Columbia with fleet numbers 9041–9049. These vehicles entered service in early 2005, joining the nineteen Trident 3 buses already in service since 2000. These were followed by another 26 (9501-9526) which entered service in 2008; sixteen of them (9501-9516) were originally allocated to Victoria and the other ten (9517-9526) to the Kelowna Regional Transit System in Kelowna. All units are currently allocated to Victoria.

In 2009, BC Transit received one hybrid-electric Enviro500H (now numbered 9527) for evaluation, and followed it up in 2011 by purchasing one Enviro500 demonstration vehicle built in 2007 but repowered with an EPA 2010-compliant Cummins ISL engine (now numbered 9528). Three more Enviro500s (9529-9531) entered service in 2013, built in 2008 and acquired second-hand from OC Transpo (see below). All of these vehicles are used in Victoria.

GO Transit

GO Transit, the regional transportation authority serving the Greater Toronto Area in Ontario, currently operates 127 12.8-metre-long Enviro500s in its fleet. Like its fleet of coach buses, they have only one door in the front. Earlier, it tested a double-decker Trident 3 on loan from Victoria in May 2002, which had an extra rear door. However, it did not place any orders until early 2008, when it introduced twelve commuter-type Enviro500s (numbered 8000–8011), Ten extra units (8012-8021) entered service in early 2009. Both of these batches have a height of , making them too high to meet bridge clearance (under overpasses etc.) requirements in the province.

After the introduction of the &quot;Go-Anywhere&quot; version of the Enviro500, In 2012, GO Transit ordered 25 of these new models (8101-8125), also long. The first bus was delivered on 3 April 2013 and the remaining 24 in May 2013. These were followed by seventy in 2014, delivered in two batches (8126-8165 and 8166–8195), and a further ten (8196-8205) in 2015.

OC Transpo

OC Transpo of Ottawa, Ontario, purchased three transit-type Enviro500s in 2008 as part of a one-year pilot project to investigate the use of double-deckers on high-capacity routes. Numbered from 1201 to 1203, they were operated on a variety of routes, but their height, which exceeded the requirements of the MTO, made them impractical for continued use. These three demo buses were sold to BC Transit in the summer of 2012 (see above).

OC Transpo subsequently ordered 75 &quot;Go-Anywhere&quot; Enviro500s (numbered 8001–8075) for delivery in 2012/13, the first one officially arriving on 23 August 2012. 73 of 75 these buses are in service as of 12 January 2019.

Strathcona County Transit

Strathcona County Transit ordered 14 transit-type Enviro500s (numbered 8001–8014) for their commuter service between Sherwood Park and Edmonton, Alberta, with the first arriving in late 2013 and subsequent buses arriving by the spring of 2014. They chose double-deckers over articulated transit and motor coaches after a year of testing between September 2010 and October 2011.

==== United States ====

Gray Line New York, owned by Coach USA ordered 20 open-top Enviro500 for its sightseeing operations in New York and put them into service in spring 2005, these were the first open-top Enviro500 built (another 13 would later be ordered). Gray Line also received three single-door Enviro500 in summer 2005 for operation in San Francisco.
Citizens Area Transit (now RTC Transit) of Las Vegas had its first 50 Enviro500s enter service by October 2005. The service, marketed as &quot;The Deuce&quot;, runs along the Las Vegas Strip. Certain high-traffic routes, such as along Maryland Parkway and Nellis Boulevard, have also used these buses. They offer extra ventilation grilles outside the engine compartment to cope with Southern Nevada&#x27;s dry desert climate and high summertime temperatures. Las Vegas&#x27;s Enviro500s have the largest air conditioning system ever created for a transit vehicle, with eight fans fitted on the air conditioning unit. As of October 2006, CAT had firm orders for another 41 of the type worth $29.8 million; these were delivered in late 2007. A further 40 had also been ordered for delivery in 2008; these were long and had a second staircase to speed loading and unloading. All these vehicles were used for regular fixed-route operations, &quot;not&quot; for sightseeing operations.

Les Cars Rouges, a sightseeing company, ordered 16 open-top Enviro500 for sightseeing operations in the US, delivery of these buses started in early 2007. Eight of the Enviro500 are destined for San Francisco, and the rest of them are destined for Washington, D.C.

Community Transit signed a five-year contract on 2 July 2009 with Alexander Dennis to deliver up to 120 Enviro500 coaches after the trial of an Enviro500 demonstrator. The company introduced a fleet of 23 Enviro500s in 2011.

Unitrans (the student-run transit service of University of California, Davis, known for years for its operation of former London Transport double-decker buses) ordered two Enviro500 which were delivered in early 2010; these are the first batch of Enviro500s with the bodywork assembled by ElDorado National.

SLO Transit ordered one Enviro500 which entered service in late 2010.

Hele-On Bus introduced one 12.8m Enviro500 in the first half of 2011.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
An Enviro500 with Kiwi Bus Builders bodywork was unveiled in 2011. This bus was the first Enviro500 with bodywork constructed by other bodybuilders, it was built for Rockleigh Tours in Melbourne. The chassis was narrowed to comply with Australian Design Rules.

<doc id="1052040" wikidata="Q223169" url="?curid=1052040" title="3 Maccabees">
<text>3 Maccabees, also called the Third Book of Maccabees, is a book written in Koine Greek, likely in the 1st century BC in either the late Ptolemaic period of Egypt or in early Roman Egypt. Despite the title, the book has nothing to do with the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire described in 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees. Instead it tells the story of a persecution of the Jews under Pharaoh Ptolemy IV Philopator (222–205 BC) in Ptolemaic Egypt, some decades before the Maccabee uprising in Judea. The story purports to explain the origin of a Purim-like festival celebrated in Egypt. 3 Maccabees is somewhat similar to the Book of Esther, another book which describes how a king is advised to annihilate the Diaspora Jews in his territory, yet is thwarted by God.

In 3 Maccabees, King Ptolemy IV Philopator attempts to enter the Second Temple in Jerusalem, but is rebuffed by divine power. He grows to hate Jews, and orders the Jews of Egypt assembled in his hippodrome to be executed by elephants. However, God protects the Jews, and Ptolemy&#x27;s elephants trample his own men instead. Ptolemy experiences a change of heart and lets the Jews go free; the Jews establish a festival in celebration. 

3 Maccabees is considered part of the Biblical Anagignoskomena (deuterocanon) in the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Assyrian Church of the East, and some Oriental Orthodox Churches: the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Syriac Orthodox Church. Jews, Catholics, and Protestants do not regard it as canonical, though some (the Moravian Brethren as an example) include it in the apocrypha section of their bibles. The split dates back to the Apostolic Canons approved by the Eastern Church&#x27;s Council in Trullo in 692 AD but rejected by the Western Church&#x27;s Pope Sergius I. Trullo established that the first three books of Maccabees were canonical in the Chalcedonian Eastern Church.

==Contents==

According to the book, after Ptolemy IV Philopator&#x27;s victory against Antiochus III in 217 BC at the Battle of Raphia, he visited Jerusalem and the Second Temple, wishing to see the inner sanctuary. However, he is miraculously prevented from entering the building. This leads him to hate the Jews. Upon his return to the capital of Alexandria, he orders that all the Jews in the kingdom are to be registered, be made to pay a poll tax, and be reduced to the status of slaves. Those Jews who agree to abandon their faith and be initiated into the cult of Dionysus are to be spared. After most Jews persist in their faith, the king orders them rounded up and put to death in his hippodrome.

The attempt to register all the Jews before their execution is thwarted by the sheer number of the Jews. Ptolemy then attempts to have the Jews killed by crushing by elephant and orders 500 elephants to be intoxicated in order to enrage them. However, the execution is repeatedly thwarted. God first causes Ptolemy to oversleep, then causes him to miraculously forget his anger against the Jews. Ptolemy finally attempts to lead the elephants and his own army into the hippodrome to destroy the Jews personally, but after an impassioned prayer by Eleazar, God sends two angels who prevent this.

Ptolemy abruptly forgets his anger with the Jews and honors them with various immunities and a banquet, with several dates being established as commemorative festivals. The Jews request and receive permission to return home and to kill all the Jews who chose to abandon their faith in order to be spared. The book includes a letter, ostensibly by Ptolemy, to this effect. Finally, the Jews return home. 

==Authorship and date==
The author of this book was likely an Alexandrian Jew who wrote in Greek as part of Hellenistic Judaism. The author is prone to rhetorical constructs and has a bombastic style. His Greek is excellent and native, including rare and poetic words; he also seems familiar with Hebrew literature, if possibly in translation. The themes and style of the book are similar to those of 2 Maccabees, the Letter of Aristeas, and the Book of Esther, suggesting the author had read them. Similar to 2 Maccabees, the author was likely influenced by the &quot;pathetic&quot; (in the sense of &quot;pathos&quot;) style of Greek argumentation that sought to appeal to emotion and sentiment, with stories such as brides and grooms being dragged away from their homes. The author seems interested and fluent in Ptolemaic court politics and protocol.

The precise date of authorship is unknown, but the widest plausible range keeping with the text is considered to be between 100 BC and 70 AD. Scholars generally advocate for one of three periods of Egyptian history: the late Ptolemaic period (100–30 BC), the early Roman period (30–20 BC), and the later Roman period (c. 40 AD).

Advocates for the early Roman period include Moses Hadas, Victor Tcherikover, and Matan Orian. They argue that the work was written perhaps around 25–15 BC. This is because the story attacks the idea of a census (&quot;laographia&quot;, a rare word before the Romans came) and its related poll tax, saying it would reduce the Jews to the status of slaves, and the Romans conducted such a census in Roman Egypt in 24 BC. Additionally, publishing a story where a Ptolemaic king acted rashly and was thwarted while the Ptolemies still ruled would be very bold, suggesting a publication date after the Roman absorption of Egypt in 30 BC. The work could then function as an esoteric criticism of Roman policies without naming them directly.

Advocates for the later Roman period include Heinrich Ewald, Hugo Willrich, and John J. Collins. They hold that the book was written as a polemic against Emperor Caligula, thus dating from around 40 AD. The work includes an incident at the Second Temple and an attack on Egyptian Jews; something similar happened in this period albeit with the order reversed, with anti-Jewish riots in Alexandria in 38 AD and Caligula attempting to install a statue of himself in the Temple around 39–40 AD. Arguments against this theory are that Caligula&#x27;s actions do not match Ptolemy in the book that closely; for example, Ptolemy does not claim he is a divinity and attempt to self-deify himself as Caligula did. The riots in Alexandria came from common people rather than government ministers, as in 3 Maccabees. The author does not appear to have knowledge of Roman activities of the later 1st century that caused opposition from Jews such as desecration of sanctuaries. 

Scholars who favor the late Ptolemaic period include Elias Bickerman, Hugh Anderson, and Sara Raup Johnson. On the topic of the census, they propose that it is entirely possible that a Ptolemaic census had also threatened to reduce the status of Jews to that of native Egyptians (the least prestigious caste in Ptolemaic society) by making Alexandrian Jews pay a tax usually only levied on rural populations. Even if &quot;laographia&quot; is truly felt to be a reference to the Roman census, that is only an argument for a slight post-publication modification of a few passages, in this view. The rest of the work fits snugly into traditions of works of Hellenistic Judaism which inspired the author such as 2 Maccabees, which date to around 100 BC, so 3 Maccabees should fit into that same cultural milieu and era as well. More generally, while the threatened extermination of Jews may seem extreme and thus fit better in the Roman period of declining Jew–Gentile relations, the work is still ultimately an endorsement of the status quo of the Hellenistic era. The tone is largely positive, with glad thanksgivings for God&#x27;s deliverance rather than thundering apocalyptic proclamations. Even as the royal court persecutes them, the author writes that &quot;The Jews continued to maintain goodwill and unswerving loyalty towards the [Ptolemaic] dynasty.&quot; The Jews are eventually given legal immunities by the king and return to contented loyalty to the Greek government, a sentiment considered by supporters of a Ptolemaic-era origin to be a poor fit for the Roman era of distant governors unsympathetic to the Jews.

==Manuscripts and title==
3 Maccabees was preserved due to inclusion in the Septuagint, the Greek Jewish Scriptures. While Hellenistic Judaism waned with time and the work was not included in the Masoretic canon of the Tanakh (Hebrew scriptures) used by later Jews, early Christians preserved the Septuagint as the basis for the Christian Old Testament, ensuring that the work was not lost. The lists of books in early manuscripts of the Septuagint were not yet standardized, however. The Codex Vaticanus lacks the books of Maccabees and the Codex Sinaiticus includes only 1 and 4 Maccabees; only the Codex Alexandrinus includes all of 1, 2, 3, and 4 Maccabees. The 8th–9th century Venetus, while written much later than Alexandrinus, largely agrees with it, so there are few textual variations.

Lucian of Antioch made a number of changes to his version of the Septuagint, resulting in variant readings. Lucianic versions became the standard in Syria, Asia Minor, and Constantinople, with the version of 3 Maccabees in the Syriac Peshitta notably Lucianic in character, as well as being a rather free translation that included several expansions. There also exists also a paraphrastic Armenian version that dates to 400–600 AD. Robert Hanhart published a critical edition of the Greek text in 1960, with a second edition in 1980.

The original title of the book, if any, is unknown. The Septuagint is what gave the work the title &quot;3 Maccabees&quot;, despite being something of a misnomer. Presumably, this was due to the apparent links to 2 Maccabees and to distinguish it from the other books of Maccabees in the Septuagint. Similarities with stories in 2 Maccabees include the High Priest Simon II appearing, the father of Onias III who is discussed in 2 Maccabees, and fends off an attempt by Philopator to enter the Temple of Jerusalem; the suffering of Egyptian Jews is described in a similar manner to the martyrdom of Eleazar and the woman with seven sons; Eleazar himself reappears in this story; and two angels appear in the finale of the story to stop a king&#x27;s anti-Jewish actions, similar to the story of Heliodorus. The book may also have been referred to by Pseudo-Athanasius as &quot;Ptolemaica&quot; (Ptolemaics).

==Historicity==
The contents of the book have a legendary character and it is not generally considered reliable as history; it is closer to a romance or historical novel, similar to the Book of Judith or Greek romances. Some parts of the story, such as the names of the Jews taking up all the paper in Egypt or the king granting the Jews a license to murder apostates, are clearly fictional. Additionally, the Book of Daniel, generally agreed to have been written around 165 BC, does not mention any such attack by the Ptolemies (referred to there as the &quot;king of the south&quot;) against the Temple in its chapter 11 recounting of history as known to the author; as Daniel comprehensively chronicles threats against the Temple, this suggests the story of Ptolemy IV attempting to raid the Temple was invented for literary purposes. No other ancient sources or histories describe such an alleged persecution under Philopater. German historian Emil Schürer called the book almost entirely fictitious and a work of the poorest sort.

That said, while many elements of the story are dubious, many scholars accept that memories of a genuine persecution might be being described in 3 Maccabees, if distorted. Josephus writes that many (but certainly not all) Jews were put to death in Alexandria under the reign of Ptolemy VIII Physcon (146–117 BC) due to their support for his rival Cleopatra II, and this execution was indeed carried out by intoxicated elephants. This may be the historical center of the account in 3 Maccabees; the author transferred it to an earlier time period and added an ahistorical connection to Jerusalem if this theory is correct. Even Josephus&#x27;s account may be heavily embellished, however: no independent evidence exists for such a persecution either, so he may have simply been building from the same legend as 3 Maccabees. Hugo Willrich claimed that the root of the story was a persecution by Ptolemy X Alexander I in 88 BCE, but based the claim on a questionable reading of Jordanes writing centuries later; this theory has not found acceptance among others. Moses Hadas suggests that the book could be describing and opposing a loss of civil rights in the Roman era, and the book was closer to describing troubles the Egyptian Jewish community had after the loss of the reasonably amenable late Ptolemaic rulers and the transition to Roman rule. As described in the speculation on the date of authorship, it is possible that the book was actually describing a contemporary Roman persecution, but moved the setting earlier in time. Another possibility is that the persecution which inspired the work was the best-attested one: that of Antiochus IV in Judea chronicled in 2 Maccabees, and the Egyptian author was telling a &quot;what if it happened here?&quot; story.

The book&#x27;s opening, a retelling of the Battle of Raphia, is generally agreed to be loosely accurate, if not to the quality of Polybius&#x27;s version. It may have been based on a lost history of Ptolemy of Megalopolis, Philopater&#x27;s governor of Cyprus, and seems to have been based on an account written from the Ptolemaic point of view. The account of Ptolemy&#x27;s visit to the Temple is considered based on the story of Heliodorus in 2 Maccabees rather than any historical event; archaeological evidence has been found suggesting Philopater indeed visited towns in Coele-Syria in the era to offer sacrifices to the local temples, but no other evidence of a controversy related to such visits exists, or if the visits even extended to Jerusalem. 

A possible interpretation that gives credit to the historicity of 3 Maccabees might go something like this: Ptolemy Philopater was more open-minded than many Greeks in that he attempted to integrate non-Greeks into his army and administration, notably native Egyptians. Doing so required creation of a syncretic religion to unify everyone, Greek and non-Greek alike. As a devotee of Dionysus, perhaps he attempted to ensure the loyalty of recruited non-Greeks by initiating them into the Dionysian Mysteries in exchange for citizenship (3:21). Some Jews obeyed but most refused the offer (2:31–33, 3:22–23). The king was angry and threatened Jews who were already citizens with loss of their status if they did not join, a potential catastrophe that would be remembered for centuries. The Jews tried bribery (2:32). While nothing like the attempted mass execution at the hippodrome thwarted by angels occurred, some Jews in the provinces were possibly executed (3:12–30), before eventually the initiative stopped. Still, this is speculative. Notably, other Greek writings indicate that the cult of Dionysus, as a mystery cult, restricted entry rather than opening it widely to all; it was a status symbol that people had to petition to be initiated in. If Ptolemy Philopater really had thrown open the cult to everyone, it would have been an unusual move.

Another theory about the historical basis of the book was advanced by Adolf Büchler in 1899. He held that the book describes the persecution of the Jews in the Fayum region of Egypt, rather than in Alexandria. The Jews in Coele-Syria abruptly changed allegiance from the Ptolemies to the Seleucids in 200 BC as a consequence of Seleucid victory in the Fifth Syrian War. Büchler argues that this put Egyptian Jews under suspicion now that the Temple in Jerusalem was led by a High Priest who answered to the rival Seleucids, triggering a persecution in Egypt.

==Theology==
Despite clearly being familiar with 2 Maccabees, the author does not appear to agree with some of its tenets. While describing suffering and evil, the book makes no reference to a future resurrection of the innocent nor future retribution for villains. While two angels appear in response to a prayer, the author specifically writes that the angels were invisible to the Jews, perhaps suggesting a reluctance to ascribe power or authority to angels rather than God, or a reconciling of conflicting stories. The author may have been theologically conservative, keeping to classic traditions of Judaism in opposition to the influence of Greek thought on Judaism, such as Greek beliefs on the immortality of the soul that 2 Maccabees includes.

One of the main goals of the book may have been to explain the reason behind the Purim-esque festival celebrated by Egyptian Jews. In this theory, the origins of the festival had been muddied by time, and the author expanded existing stories of persecution into a story of how God saved the Jews of Egypt.

The author shows a high regard for the power of prayer; the work frequently depicts the Jews praying for aid, and God answering their prayers. Simon, the Jews collectively, and Eleazar all pray to God in situations of dire need, and these prayers are answered directly.

The author&#x27;s concluding story sharply condemns apostasy in Judaism: 300 Jews who had left the faith during the initial registration are slain by pious Jews. The story may be partially based on Esther 9, where 300 people are also killed, but there the enemies are gentiles which had sought to destroy the Jews; here, they are merely Jewish civilians, and after the crisis has already passed.

==Influence==
3 Maccabees was not influential. No Jewish writers of the ancient era appear to reference it or be familiar with it, even those who wrote in Greek. The book was not translated into the Latin Vulgate, hence the Western Church&#x27;s rejection of including it even as a member of the deuterocanonical books. While the book was kept in the Greek-speaking Eastern Church&#x27;s scripture, it is only very rarely referenced or alluded to. Theodoret briefly summarizes 3 Maccabees in one of his writings, but this is the rare exception; the work had little influence on Christianity. 3 Maccabees is included in the deuterocanon of the Eastern Orthodox Church and some Oriental Orthodox Churches: the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Syriac Orthodox Church; as well as the Assyrian Church of the East. The Apostolic Canons approved by the Eastern Church&#x27;s Council in Trullo in 692 verified 1, 2, and 3 Maccabees were deuterocanonical, but the Council was rejected by the Western Church&#x27;s Pope Sergius I.

<text>Edward Capell (11 June 171324 February 1781) was an English Shakespearian critic.

==Biography==
He was born at Troston Hall () in Suffolk. 

Through the influence of the Duke of Grafton he was appointed to the office of deputy-inspector of plays in 1737, with a salary of £200 per annum, and in 1745 he was made a Groom of the Privy Chamber through the same influence. 
In 1760 appeared his &quot;Prolusions, or, Select Pieces of Ancient Poetry&quot;, a collection which included &quot;Edward III&quot;, placed by Capell among the doubtful plays of Shakespeare.

Shocked at the inaccuracies which had crept into Sir Thomas Hanmer&#x27;s edition of Shakespeare, he projected an entirely new edition, to be carefully collated with the original copies. After spending three years in collecting, and comparing scarce folio and quarto editions, he published his own edition in 10 vols 8vo (1768), with an introduction written in a style of extraordinary quaintness, which was afterwards appended to Johnson&#x27;s and Steevens&#x27;s editions.

Capell published the first part of his commentary, which included notes on nine plays with a glossary, in 1774. 
This he afterwards recalled, and the publication of the complete work, &quot;Notes and Various Readings of Shakespeare&quot; (1779–1783), the third volume of which bears the title of &quot;The School of Shakespeare&quot;, was completed, under the superintendence of John Collins, in 1783, two years after the author&#x27;s death. 
It contains the results of his unremitting labour for thirty years, and throws considerable light on the history of the times of Shakespeare, as well as on the sources from which he derived his plots.

Collins asserted that Steevens had stolen Capell&#x27;s notes for his own edition, the story being that the printers had been bribed to show Steevens the sheets of Capell&#x27;s edition while it was passing through the press. 
Besides the works already specified, he published an edition of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, adapted for the stage with the help of David Garrick in 1758. 
His edition of Shakespeare passed through many editions (1768, 1771, 1793, 1799, 1803, 1813). Capell died in the Temple on 24 February 1781.

<text>Karasumi is a food product made by salting mullet roe pouch and drying it in sunlight. A theory suggests that it got its name from its resemblance to the blocks of &quot;sumi&quot; (inkstick) imported from China (&quot;Kara&quot;) for use in Japanese calligraphy. Karasumi is a high priced delicacy and it is eaten while drinking sake. It is a softer analog of Mediterranean Bottarga.

It is a speciality of Nagasaki and along with salt-pickled sea urchin roe and Konowata one of the &quot;three &quot;chinmi&quot; of Japan&quot;. 

The town of Donggang in Taiwan specializes in the delicacy, called wuyutsu (). Mullet fishing in Taiwan can be traced back to when the island was under Dutch colonial rule.

<doc id="1052067" wikidata="Q656561" url="?curid=1052067" title="Malfunkshun">
<text>Malfunkshun is an American rock band formed in 1980 by brothers Andrew and Kevin Wood. Combining glam influences with distortion, they were one of the earliest grunge bands, forming alongside the U-Men and Melvins. Their definitive lineup consists of the brothers and drummer Regan Hagar. After interactions with fellow grunge act Green River, Andrew would become the frontman for successor Mother Love Bone. Malfunkshun dissolved without having released much material, although they recorded demos and appeared in the landmark grunge compilation &quot;Deep Six&quot;.

Andrew struggled with drug dependence for several years, eventually dying from a heroin overdose in 1990. Mother Love Bone disbanded as a result and was succeeded by Pearl Jam. Malfunkshun&#x27;s demos with Andrew were later compiled and released as &quot;Return to Olympus&quot; on Loosegroove Records, which was founded by Hagar and fellow Mother Love Bone member Stone Gossard. Malfunkshun reformed in 2005 and is currently touring and recording new material.

== History ==

=== 1980s: Andrew Wood era ===
Bainbridge Island, Washington brothers Andrew and Kevin Wood, decided to skip an Easter dinner at their grandmother&#x27;s house and stayed at home instead - and recorded their first demo, titled &quot;Malfunkshun&quot;. A bit later they found drummer David Hunt (1964–2009) and bassist Dave Rees, and became a four-piece. Hunt and Rees played with Malfunkshun for only one show; after they left, Andrew took over bass and drummer Regan Hagar was recruited from the band Maggot Brains, establishing the band&#x27;s definitive power trio lineup.

During performances, each band member had an alter ego. Andrew&#x27;s was L&#x27;Andrew the Love Child, Kevin was Kevinstein and Regan became Thundarr. Kevin&#x27;s stage persona wasn&#x27;t as carved-in-stone as Andrew&#x27;s or Regan&#x27;s, referred to sometimes as &quot;the Axe-Handler&quot; and even an early Malfunkshun poster hand-drawn by Andrew names him &quot;Led Springsteen&quot;. Using makeup and flashy glam-style clothing in a nod to KISS, and other favorite bands, Malfunkshun was known for their dynamic live shows. Andrew was unpredictable and would wander the crowd during shows with his wireless bass, and even stop shows to eat cereal, and throw the rest out to the crowd. Andrew became increasingly involved with drugs and in 1985 he checked into drug rehab, during which time Malfunkshun was put on hold.

When Andrew returned from rehab, the band started up again and contributed &quot;With Yo&#x27; Heart (Not Yo&#x27; Hands)&quot; and &quot;Stars-n-You&quot; to the &quot;Deep Six&quot; compilation by C/Z Records. Notwithstanding their densely distorted sound, Sub Pop never took much interest in the band. Although they were beginning to gain popularity they rarely headlined their own shows.

Dissolving, but never formally disbanding, Malfunkshun took a back seat to the jam sessions Andrew and Hagar had begun with Green River members Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament. These sessions were the beginnings of Lords of the Wasteland, which would become Mother Love Bone after the addition of Greg Gilmore and Bruce Fairweather. Kevin formed Fire Ants in 1992 with his brother Brian, bassist Dan McDonald, and former Nirvana drummer Chad Channing. Later Brian joined Ben Shepherd of Soundgarden, to form Hater. The brothers later formed Devilhead. Hagar moved on, playing in Satchel, with Shawn Smith, and in Brad, also with Shawn Smith and with Stone Gossard.

A grouping of Malfunkshun demos and recordings from 1986 to 1987 were released on Stone Gossard and Regan Hagar&#x27;s Loosegroove label in 1995, as &quot;Return to Olympus&quot;, which was the largest major label release of the band&#x27;s material.

=== 2005–present: Documentary and reformation ===
In 2005, a documentary entitled &quot;&quot;, debuted at the Seattle International Film Festival. The documentary is available on DVD in a boxed set with the reissued CD entitled &quot;Return to Olympus&quot; and the never before released Andrew Wood CD entitled &quot;Melodies and Dreams&quot;. This boxed set is a digipak set of 3 discs (1 DVD/2 CD&#x27;s) entitled &quot;&quot; released on July 19, 2011, by Universal Music Enterprises.

On October 24, 2006, surviving members Kevin Wood and Regan Hagar, with vocalist Shawn Smith and bassist Cory Kane, began writing new music using lyrics written by Andrew before his death, for the release of a new album, after which they planned to go on tour. The band had originally intended to use the name Malfunkshun, soon changing it to Subfunkshun or the Subfunkshun Project, and eventually settling on From the North (Von Nord).

On February 19, 2011, Malfunkshun announced on their website that Jeff Loftis would be taking over vocals for both Malfunkshun and From the North. On March 14, 2011, Kevin and Jeff recorded the song &quot;Jezebel Woman&quot; and on March 19, 2011, recorded &quot;Until the Ocean&quot;. They have posted both songs on YouTube under the name &quot;Malfunkshun 2011&quot;. On May 15, 2011, Malfunkshun posted on their website, that Regan officially stepped down as the drummer, and on May 24, 2011, Malfunkshun posted on their website naming Mike Stone as Regan&#x27;s replacement on drums, however Miles Freeborn substituted for Stone in March 2012 and has remained the band&#x27;s drummer ever since. On May 9, 2012, Malfunkshun announced on their website that Rob Day had joined the band in place of Guy McIntosh, who had briefly replaced Cory Kane on bass for the band&#x27;s autumn/winter tour dates.

<doc id="1052073" wikidata="Q106658" url="?curid=1052073" title="Districts of Germany">
<text>In 13 German states, the primary administrative subdivision higher than a &quot;Gemeinde&quot; (municipality) is the () or (). Most major cities in Germany are not part of any &quot;Kreis&quot;, but instead combine the functions of a municipality and a &quot;Kreis&quot;; such a city is referred to as a () or ().

&quot;(Land-)Kreise&quot; stand at an intermediate level of administration between each state () and the municipalities () within it. These correspond to level-3 administrative units in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS 3).

Previously, the similar title Imperial Circle () referred to groups of states in the Holy Roman Empire. The related term was used for similar administrative divisions in some German territories until the 19th century.
== Types of districts ==

The majority of German districts are &quot;rural districts&quot; (German: , ), of which there are 294 . Cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants (and smaller towns in some states) do not usually belong to a district, but take on district responsibilities themselves, similar to the concept of independent cities. These are known as &quot;urban districts&quot; (German: or )—cities which constitute a district in their own right—and there are 106 of them, bringing the total number of districts to 400.

In North Rhine-Westphalia, there are some cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants which are not urban districts, these being Recklinghausen, Gütersloh, Siegen, Paderborn, Bergisch Gladbach, Neuss and Moers. Nevertheless, these cities take over many district responsibilities themselves, although they are still part of a larger rural district. Midsize towns can perform particular administrative functions of the district as well, especially to provide common services to the local citizens. The classification as &quot;midsize&quot; town is usually based on a town&#x27;s registered population, but varies from state to state.

A special type of rural districts includes the three (&quot;Municipal unions of special kind&quot;), a fusion of a district-free town with its adjacent rural district: besides the Regionalverband Saarbrücken (&quot;Saarbrücken regional association&quot;), from 1974 until 2007 called &quot;Stadtverband Saarbrücken&quot; (&quot;Saarbrücken town association&quot;), there is the Hanover Region since 2001 and the Städteregion Aachen (&quot;Aachen region of towns&quot;) since 2009. Aachen, Hanover and Göttingen retain certain rights of an urban district (&quot;Kreisfreie Stadt&quot;); Saarbrücken has not explicitly determined a similar provision in its legislation.

== Responsibilities ==

According to common federal and state laws, the districts are responsible for the following tasks:

* Planning local public transport (in most states)
* The building and upkeep of &quot;district roads&quot; ()
* Other building plans which cover more than one local authority&#x27;s area
* Caring for national parks
* Social welfare
* Youth welfare
* The building and upkeep of hospitals
* The building and upkeep of state schools of secondary education
* Household waste collection and disposal
* Car registration
* Electing the or , the chief executive and representative of the district

Districts can perform additional functions, based on varying local laws in each region:

* Financial support for culture
* The building of pedestrian zones and bicycle lanes
* Financial support for school exchanges
* The building and upkeep of public libraries
* Revitalisation of the economy
* Encouraging tourism
* The management of state-run adult education colleges ()

All these tasks are carried out by local (municipal) authorities operating together. Urban districts have these responsibilities and also those of the municipalities.

== District council ==
The district council (German: , ) is the highest institution of a rural district and is responsible for all fundamental guidelines of regional self-administration. This council is elected directly every five years, except in Bavaria where it is elected every six years. Usually the administrative seat of a rural district is located in one of its largest towns. However, district council and administrative seat of some rural districts are not situated within the district proper, but in an adjacent district-free city. Most of those rural districts are named after this central city as well (e.g. Bamberg and Karlsruhe). Moers is the biggest city in Germany (and at present time the only one with more than 100,000 inhabitants) that is neither an urban district, nor the district seat of its rural district.

== District administration ==
The highest administrative position of a rural district is an officer known as or , who is responsible for the district&#x27;s day-to-day administration and acts as its representative for official purposes. In parts of northern Germany, &quot;Landrat&quot; is also the name of the entire district administration, which in southern Germany is known as or .

In urban districts similar administrative functions are performed by a mayor, in most greater cities usually by an &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot;, which is sometimes translated as lord mayor.

Rural districts in some German states have an additional administrative committee called &quot;Kreisausschuss&quot;. This committee is generally led by the Landrat and includes a number of additional voluntary members. It takes over certain administrative functions for the district, following decisions of the district council. However, the exact role and regulations of this panel vary greatly between different states.

The city where the office of the district&#x27;s administration is located is called &quot;Kreisstadt&quot; (&quot;district city&quot;), or &quot;Kreishauptort&quot; (&quot;district main community&quot;) if it is not a city. Often the district is named after its district city.

Linguistically, any city within a district could be called a &quot;Kreisstadt&quot;, especially those that aren&#x27;t district-free to distinguish them from district-free cities. This term has to be distinguished from the legal term &quot;Kreisstadt&quot; that only denotes the location of the administrative office. In everyday language, district cities are also called &quot;Kreishauptstadt&quot; (&quot;district capital&quot;).

<doc id="1052081" wikidata="Q230255" url="?curid=1052081" title="4 Maccabees">
<text>4 Maccabees, also called the Fourth Book of Maccabees and possibly originally known as On the Sovereignty of Reason, is a book written in Koine Greek, likely in the 1st or early 2nd century. It is a homily or philosophic discourse praising the supremacy of pious reason over passion. It is a work that combines Hellenistic Judaism with influence from Greek philosophy, particularly the school of Stoicism.

The work is largely an elaboration of the stories of martyrdom in the book 2 Maccabees: that of the woman with seven sons and the scribe Eleazar, who are tortured to death by Seleucid King Antiochus IV Epiphanes in an attempt to make them renounce their adherence to Judaism. What 2 Maccabees covered in one chapter and a half, 4 Maccabees extends to a full 14 chapters of dialogue and philosophical discussion. 4 Maccabees recasts the story as one of reason and logic: the martyrs will be rewarded in the afterlife, so it is rational to continue to obey Jewish law, even at the risk of torture and death.

==Synopsis==

The work consists of a prologue and two main sections. The first advances the philosophical thesis on the basis of examples from the Law of Moses and the biblical tradition while the second illustrates the points made using examples drawn from 2 Maccabees: the martyrdom of Eleazar and the woman with seven sons under King Antiochus IV Epiphanes of the Seleucid Empire. The last chapters concern the author&#x27;s impressions drawn from these martyrdoms. It has been suggested that, while 2 Maccabees was written with appeals to emotion, sentiment, and drama (&quot;pathos&quot;), 4 Maccabees is considerably more intellectual about the matter. The martyred woman calmly debates her captors, explaining why her actions are rational given God&#x27;s promise of rewards in the afterlife, using arguments akin to those favored by Stoic philosophy. The author of 4 Maccabees still appreciates the power of arousing emotions, however. The work goes into more grisly detail concerning the martyrdoms themselves than 2 Maccabees; &quot;even now, we ourselves shudder as we hear of the suffering of these young men&quot; (4 Maccabees 14:9). The author has the clear rhetorical intent of arousing admiration and emulation of these examples of devotion to the Jewish law.

The work is in fluent and complicated Greek using the rhetorical argumentative style of the time. Harry Orlinsky describes it as &quot;an elaborate variation, in philosophical and highly dramatic vein, of the theme&quot; of 2 Maccabees 6:18–7:4. The work uses secular allusions to Greek-style athletics and military contests, calling Eleazar a &quot;noble athlete&quot; and the martyred mother of the seven sons a &quot;soldier of God&quot;.

The work defends the merits of Judaism in a Hellenized world. According to it, devout practice of Judaism perfects the values held dear in Greek and Roman contexts, with the martyrs presented in terms reminiscent of Greek sages.

==Authorship, date, and title==
The author of the work is unknown. The book is ascribed to the Jewish historian Josephus by Eusebius and Jerome, and this opinion was accepted for many years, leading to its inclusion in many editions of Josephus&#x27; works. Later scholars have rejected this claim of authorship, however. There are differences of language and style; 4 Maccabees makes several historical errors that Josephus&#x27;s work does not make; and the ideology of the two seems to conflict (Josephus favored accommodation toward Gentile practices, not the uncompromising stance seen in 4 Maccabees). The author was probably not from Roman Judea, as the book includes a minor geographical mistake about the layout of Jerusalem, Judea was largely Aramaic-speaking in the era, and the tone of the work suggests the defense of a cultural minority in a Hellenistic environment. As such, he was probably a diaspora Jew, although from where is unclear. Alexandria was the largest site of literary Greek Jewish works in the era, but scholars such as Hans Freudenthal and Eduard Norden think that the religious outlook of the book does not easily match Alexandrian Jewish thought. Moses Hadas suggests that Antioch in Roman Syria was a more likely site for composition: a thoroughly Hellenized and Greek-speaking city with a large Jewish minority that revered the martyrs, judging by later Christian churches dedicated to the &quot;Maccabean martyrs&quot; in Antioch, as well as certain word usage that was rare among Alexandrian works such as 3 Maccabees.

The original title of the work, if any, is uncertain. The Septuagint is what gave it its modern name of &quot;4 Maccabees&quot; to distinguish it from the other books of Maccabees in it, but it almost certainly was not the original title of the work. Eusebius and Jerome wrote that the work of Josephus on the martyrdoms of the Maccabees – presumably 4 Maccabees – was called &quot;On the Sovereignty of Reason&quot;, suggesting that might have been the original title. This title would be consistent with the conventions of Greek philosophical and ethical works of the period (e.g., Seneca&#x27;s &quot;On Anger&quot;, &quot;On Benefits&quot;, &quot;On the Constancy of the Wise Person&quot;).

The book is generally dated between 20 and 130 CE. Elias J. Bickerman suggests a composition date somewhere between 20–54 CE; Moses Hadas agrees with that range and further suggests that perhaps around 40 CE during the reign of Roman Emperor Caligula would fit. Other scholars such as André Dupont-Sommer support a later date, perhaps during the reign of Emperor Hadrian (118–135 CE).

The last chapter differs from the earlier chapters in style, and is a somewhat disorganized summary of what has been stated before. According to some scholars, this might be evidence that the last chapter is a later addition to the work, though this is disputed. The argument in favor of it being an original part of the composition is that the book would have a weak ending without the final chapter, and that the style and vocabulary of the final chapter is not as different as claimed. The change of direction with chapter 17 supports the view of the work as a homily held before a Greek-speaking audience on the feast of Hanukkah, as advanced by Ewald and Freudenthal, where this would be a rhetorical element to draw the listeners into the discourse. Others hold that a homily would have to be based on scriptural texts, which this work is only loosely.

In terms of genre, the book resembles both the panegyric or encomium (speeches in honor of a particular person or subject) as well as the philosophical diatribe. The work has a clearly Stoic stamp as the thesis it seeks to demonstrate is that &quot;pious reason exercises mastery over the emotions&quot; (4 Maccabees 1:1). The adjective &quot;pious,&quot; however, is critically important: the author is altering the common topic (&quot;reason can master the emotions&quot;) in order to suggest that it is the mind that has been trained in the piety and exercises in the practices of the Jewish Law that is equipped to exercise the mastery that Greek ethicists praise. The work also resonates with sentiments articulated by other philosophical schools such as Platonism.

==Theology==
The writer believes in the immortality of the soul, but never mentions the resurrection of the dead. Good souls are said to live forever in happiness with the patriarchs and God, but even the evil souls are held to be immortal. The suffering and martyrdom of the Maccabees is seen by the author to be vicarious for the Jewish nation, and the author portrays martyrdom in general as bringing atonement for the past sins of the Jews. In this it is similar to the Testament of Moses, which was written or updated around the same time period, and similarly praises the virtues of martyrdom and resistance.

While the setting of the book is during the Seleucid and Maccabee period of Judea, it is generally believed that the author intended to apply the lessons from this era in his current time. The book thus functions as an endorsement of fidelity to Jewish customs and law and against assimilation to Gentile practice where this conflicted with the Torah.

David A. deSilva considers the work&#x27;s depiction of personal trust and faithfulness toward God as being in line with early Christian theology; notably, he argues that the Jewish Christian Epistle to the Hebrews has a similar viewpoint on the matter of the meaning of faith. The work also seems to have proto-Christian views on the nature of atonement: that the sacrifice of animals at the Temple (impossible in the Maccabean era, as well as for diaspora Jews in the author&#x27;s era) could be replaced by a sacrifice of &quot;obedience unto death&quot; by faithful humans. While it is difficult to know for sure, deSilva also hypothesizes that the kind of promotion of the value of the Jewish Law for shaping an ethical life might have been used by the Jewish Christians who sought to persuade Gentile Christians also to adopt a Jewish way of life. These Jewish Christians, however, have not left a written legacy of their own; we have access to their arguments only as reflected in Paul&#x27;s letters angrily denouncing their understanding of Christianity.

==Canonicity==
4 Maccabees enjoyed little influence on later Judaism. Hellenistic Judaism waned with time, and the book was not translated to Hebrew in its era. It was not included in the Masoretic canon of Hebrew scriptures, the Tanakh, and thus was not considered canonical by later Jews. Stories of the martyrs did circulate among Jews in rabbinic literature, but likely from independent traditions rather than 4 Maccabees directly.

The work was preserved largely among Christians. These early Christians both were interested in stories of martyrdom and generally admired Stoicism. The book seems to have been reasonably esteemed in the early Christian church: sermons and works of John Chrysostom, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Ambrose evince familiarity with 4 Maccabees. The work also had a profound impact on Origen. The popular Martyrdom of Polycarp exhibits many similarities with the stories in 4 Maccabees. Despite circulating among early Christian communities who used versions of the Septuagint that included 4 Maccabees, church councils were generally more skeptical. In Greek lists, the book appears in the Apostolic Canons, but no others. In Latin lists, it appears in Codex Claromontanus. If the Gelasian Decree is taken as an accurate record of the &quot;Damasine canon&quot; compiled by Pope Damasus I (366–383 CE), then neither 3 Maccabees nor 4 Maccabees was in the Western, Latin church&#x27;s list of canonical books of the 4th century. The book was not translated by Jerome into the Latin Vulgate. As a result, the work was generally obscure in Latin-reading Western Europe.

In the Greek-reading East, it seems the work was more popular, but still failed to be included in later canon lists. The Eastern Orthodox Canon was laid out in the Quinisext Council in Trullo (692 CE). The Trullo list included the first three books of Maccabees, but did not include 4 Maccabees as canonical. Historically, the Greek Orthodox Church and the Georgian Orthodox Church printed 4 Maccabees in their Bibles together with the rest of the Old Testament, but this did not entail that they officially considered 4 Maccabees &quot;canonical.&quot; More recently, the Greek Church moved it to an appendix and a recent Georgian Bible marks it as &quot;noncanonical.&quot; It was included in the 1688 Romanian Orthodox and the 18th-century Romanian Catholic Bibles where it was called &quot;Iosip&quot; (&quot;Josephus&quot;). It is no longer printed in Romanian Bibles today.

The Syriac, Coptic, and Ethiopic language Oriental Orthodox Churchs do not include the book as canonical either. Some ancient manuscripts of the Syriac Orthodox church include the work, but this trend eventually stopped.

It is generally not in the biblical canon for modern Christians.

==Manuscripts and translations==
4 Maccabees is in two of the three of the most ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint: the Codex Sinaiticus (4th century) and the Codex Alexandrinus (5th century). It is not, however, in the Codex Vaticanus. With the exception of the section 5:12-12:1, it is found also in the eight or ninth-century Codex Venetus. There are over 70 extant Greek manuscripts of 4 Maccabees.

Four pre-modern translations of 4 Maccabees are known. There survives a complete Syriac translation, as well as a Latin adaptation under the title &quot;Passio Sanctorum Machabaeorum&quot; (Suffering of the Holy Maccabees). One of the Syriac versions was titled &quot;The Fourth Book of the Maccabees and Their Mother&quot;. The Latin text was made around the same time as Ambrose&#x27;s &quot;De Jacob et vita beata&quot; (388), which includes an independent partial translation of 4 Maccabees. The &quot;Passio&quot; was probably completed before the appearance of the Vulgate Bible in 405–406 and was probably produced in Gaul. Fragments of an abridged Sahidic Coptic translation were discovered by Enzo Lucchesi in the 1980s. They have been edited and translated into English. Maximus the Greek produced an abridged Slavonic translation.

The Fourth Book of Maccabees is not in the Vulgate and so is absent from the Apocrypha of the Roman Bible as well as from Protestant Bibles. 

Erasmus published at Cologne in 1517, expanded in 1524, a very free Latin paraphrase of 4 Maccabees, possibly based on the &quot;Passio&quot;. After the invention of the printing press, 4 Maccabees was first mass printed in a 1526 edition of the Septuagint made in Strasbourg, albeit one based on a less reliable manuscript with a number of printer&#x27;s errors.

The work is included in the Revised Standard Version (RSV), the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV), and New Revised Standard Version Updated Edition (NRSVUE). The NRSV is used as the basis for the Renovaré Spiritual Formation Bible.

&quot;The Lexham English Septuagint: A New Translation&quot; (LES), published in 2020, includes 4 Maccabees.

<text>Real World Records is a British record label specializing in world music. It was founded in 1989 by English musician Peter Gabriel and original members of WOMAD. A majority of the works released on Real World Records feature music recorded at Real World Studios, in Box, Wiltshire, England.

==History==
The goal of its founding in 1989 was to give talented musicians from around the world access to state-of-the-art recording facilities and audiences beyond their geographic region. The musical relationships formed at WOMAD festivals were also intended to lead to new music recordings. As a result, the music label is known for bringing together musicians who share a common interest in music in general. New recording methods and new meeting places are created.

In 1999, the label had sold over 3 million records worldwide and released 90 albums. In 2015, it had reached the mark of over 200 albums.
Many of the released recordings continue to be made at Real World Studios, also founded in 1989, whose facilities support the goals of Real World Records.

In 2011, EMI Music Publishing renewed the distribution deal for the Real World catalogue outside of the United Kingdom, thereby also covering the United States for the first time.

<doc id="1052096" wikidata="Q6667308" url="?curid=1052096" title="Logarithmic form">
<text>In algebraic geometry and the theory of complex manifolds, a logarithmic differential form is a differential form with poles of a certain kind. The concept was introduced by Pierre Deligne. In short, logarithmic differentials have the mildest possible singularities needed in order to give information about an open submanifold (the complement of the divisor of poles). (This idea is made precise by several versions of de Rham&#x27;s theorem discussed below.)

Let &quot;X&quot; be a complex manifold, &quot;D&quot; ⊂ &quot;X&quot; a reduced divisor (a sum of distinct codimension-1 complex subspaces), and ω a holomorphic &quot;p&quot;-form on &quot;X&quot;−&quot;D&quot;. If both ω and &quot;d&quot;ω have a pole of order at most 1 along &quot;D&quot;, then ω is said to have a logarithmic pole along &quot;D&quot;. ω is also known as a logarithmic &quot;p&quot;-form. The &quot;p&quot;-forms with log poles along &quot;D&quot; form a subsheaf of the meromorphic &quot;p&quot;-forms on &quot;X&quot;, denoted
:formula_1

The name comes from the fact that in complex analysis, formula_2; here formula_3 is a typical example of a 1-form on the complex numbers C with a logarithmic pole at the origin. Differential forms such as formula_3 make sense in a purely algebraic context, where there is no analog of the logarithm function.

==Logarithmic de Rham complex==
Let &quot;X&quot; be a complex manifold and &quot;D&quot; a reduced divisor on &quot;X&quot;. By definition of formula_5 and the fact that the exterior derivative &quot;d&quot; satisfies &quot;d&quot;2 = 0, one has
:formula_6
for every open subset &quot;U&quot; of &quot;X&quot;. Thus the logarithmic differentials form a complex of sheaves formula_7, known as the logarithmic de Rham complex associated to the divisor &quot;D&quot;. This is a subcomplex of the direct image formula_8, where formula_9 is the inclusion and formula_10 is the complex of sheaves of holomorphic forms on &quot;X&quot;−&quot;D&quot;.

Of special interest is the case where &quot;D&quot; has normal crossings: that is, &quot;D&quot; is locally a sum of codimension-1 complex submanifolds that intersect transversely. In this case, the sheaf of logarithmic differential forms is the subalgebra of formula_11 generated by the holomorphic differential forms formula_12 together with the 1-forms formula_13 for holomorphic functions formula_14 that are nonzero outside &quot;D&quot;. Note that
:formula_15

Concretely, if &quot;D&quot; is a divisor with normal crossings on a complex manifold &quot;X&quot;, then each point &quot;x&quot; has an open neighborhood &quot;U&quot; on which there are holomorphic coordinate functions formula_16 such that &quot;x&quot; is the origin and &quot;D&quot; is defined by the equation formula_17 for some formula_18. On the open set &quot;U&quot;, sections of formula_19 are given by
:formula_20
This describes the holomorphic vector bundle formula_21 on formula_22. Then, for any formula_23, the vector bundle formula_24 is the &quot;k&quot;th exterior power,
:formula_25

The logarithmic tangent bundle formula_26 means the dual vector bundle to formula_27. Explicitly, a section of formula_26 is a holomorphic vector field on &quot;X&quot; that is tangent to &quot;D&quot; at all smooth points of &quot;D&quot;.

===Logarithmic differentials and singular cohomology===
Let &quot;X&quot; be a complex manifold and &quot;D&quot; a divisor with normal crossings on &quot;X&quot;. Deligne proved a holomorphic analog of de Rham&#x27;s theorem in terms of logarithmic differentials. Namely,
:formula_29
where the left side denotes the cohomology of &quot;X&quot; with coefficients in a complex of sheaves, sometimes called hypercohomology. This follows from the natural inclusion of complexes of sheaves
:formula_30
being a quasi-isomorphism.

==Logarithmic differentials in algebraic geometry==
In algebraic geometry, the vector bundle of logarithmic differential &quot;p&quot;-forms formula_5 on a smooth scheme &quot;X&quot; over a field, with respect to a divisor formula_32 with simple normal crossings, is defined as above: sections of formula_5 are (algebraic) differential forms ω on formula_34 such that both ω and &quot;d&quot;ω have a pole of order at most one along &quot;D&quot;. Explicitly, for a closed point &quot;x&quot; that lies in formula_35 for formula_36 and not in formula_35 for formula_38, let formula_39 be regular functions on some open neighborhood &quot;U&quot; of &quot;x&quot; such that formula_35 is the closed subscheme defined by formula_41 inside &quot;U&quot; for formula_36, and &quot;x&quot; is the closed subscheme of &quot;U&quot; defined by formula_43. Then a basis of sections of formula_27 on &quot;U&quot; is given by:
:formula_45
This describes the vector bundle formula_27 on &quot;X&quot;, and then formula_5 is the &quot;p&quot;th exterior power of formula_27.

There is an exact sequence of coherent sheaves on &quot;X&quot;:
:formula_49
where formula_50 is the inclusion of an irreducible component of &quot;D&quot;. Here β is called the residue map; so this sequence says that a 1-form with log poles along &quot;D&quot; is regular (that is, has no poles) if and only if its residues are zero. More generally, for any &quot;p&quot; ≥ 0, there is an exact sequence of coherent sheaves on &quot;X&quot;:
: formula_51
where the sums run over all irreducible components of given dimension of intersections of the divisors &quot;D&quot;&quot;j&quot;. Here again, β is called the residue map.

Explicitly, on an open subset of formula_22 that only meets one component formula_35 of formula_54, with formula_35 locally defined by formula_56, the residue of a logarithmic formula_57-form along formula_35 is determined by: the residue of a regular &quot;p&quot;-form is zero, whereas
:formula_59
for any regular formula_60-form formula_61. Some authors define the residue by saying that formula_62 has residue formula_63, which differs from the definition here by the sign formula_64.

===Example of the residue===
Over the complex numbers, the residue of a differential form with log poles along a divisor formula_35 can be viewed as the result of integration over loops in formula_22 around formula_35. In this context, the residue may be called the Poincaré residue.

For an explicit example, consider an elliptic curve &quot;D&quot; in the complex projective plane formula_68, defined in affine coordinates formula_69 by the equation formula_70 where formula_71 and formula_72 is a complex number. Then &quot;D&quot; is a smooth hypersurface of degree 3 in formula_73 and, in particular, a divisor with simple normal crossings. There is a meromorphic 2-form on formula_73 given in affine coordinates by
:formula_75
which has log poles along &quot;D&quot;. Because the canonical bundle formula_76 is isomorphic to the line bundle formula_77, the divisor of poles of formula_78 must have degree 3. So the divisor of poles of formula_78 consists only of &quot;D&quot; (in particular, formula_78 does not have a pole along the line formula_81 at infinity). The residue of ω along &quot;D&quot; is given by the holomorphic 1-form
:formula_82
It follows that formula_83 extends to a holomorphic one-form on the projective curve &quot;D&quot; in formula_73, an elliptic curve.

The residue map formula_85 considered here is part of a linear map formula_86, which may be called the &quot;Gysin map&quot;. This is part of the Gysin sequence associated to any smooth divisor &quot;D&quot; in a complex manifold &quot;X&quot;:
:formula_87

==Historical terminology==
In the 19th-century theory of elliptic functions, 1-forms with logarithmic poles were sometimes called &quot;integrals of the second kind&quot; (and, with an unfortunate inconsistency, sometimes &quot;differentials of the third kind&quot;). For example, the Weierstrass zeta function associated to a lattice formula_88 in C was called an &quot;integral of the second kind&quot; to mean that it could be written
:formula_89
In modern terms, it follows that formula_90 is a 1-form on C with logarithmic poles on formula_88, since formula_88 is the zero set of the Weierstrass sigma function formula_93

==Mixed Hodge theory for smooth varieties==
Over the complex numbers, Deligne proved a strengthening of Alexander Grothendieck&#x27;s algebraic de Rham theorem, relating coherent sheaf cohomology with singular cohomology. Namely, for any smooth scheme &quot;X&quot; over C with a divisor with simple normal crossings &quot;D&quot;, there is a natural isomorphism
:formula_94
for each integer &quot;k&quot;, where the groups on the left are defined using the Zariski topology and the groups on the right use the classical (Euclidean) topology.

Moreover, when &quot;X&quot; is smooth and proper over C, the resulting spectral sequence
:formula_95
degenerates at formula_96. So the cohomology of formula_34 with complex coefficients has a decreasing filtration, the Hodge filtration, whose associated graded vector spaces are the algebraically defined groups formula_98.

This is part of the mixed Hodge structure which Deligne defined on the cohomology of any complex algebraic variety. In particular, there is also a weight filtration on the rational cohomology of formula_34. The resulting filtration on formula_100 can be constructed using the logarithmic de Rham complex. Namely, define an increasing filtration formula_101 by
:formula_102
The resulting filtration on cohomology is the weight filtration:
:formula_103

Building on these results, Hélène Esnault and Eckart Viehweg generalized the Kodaira–Akizuki–Nakano vanishing theorem in terms of logarithmic differentials. Namely, let &quot;X&quot; be a smooth complex projective variety of dimension &quot;n&quot;, &quot;D&quot; a divisor with simple normal crossings on &quot;X&quot;, and &quot;L&quot; an ample line bundle on &quot;X&quot;. Then
:formula_104
and
:formula_105
for all formula_106.

<text>The Wenlock Arms is a public house in Hoxton, in East London which began trading in 1787. The pub is located halfway between Old Street and Angel, just off the City Road and the City Road Basin and Wenlock Basin on the Regent&#x27;s Canal. The pub has won awards for the quality and range of its cask ales.

==History==
The Wenlock Arms first opened for business in 1787 and was operated by the nearby Wenlock Brewery as a &quot;brewery tap&quot;.

John Lane (1808–1873) owned and ran the Wenlock Brewery from 1840 until his death, initially as &quot;Lane &amp; Bowden&quot; (the 1842 Post Office Directory mentions “LANE &amp; BOWDEN, Ale Brewers, 9 Wenlock Road”). John&#x27;s brother-in-law, John Mitchell (1813–1868), was brewery foreman in 1851 (mentioned in the census). Various other members of the Mitchell family worked at the brewery from time to time. These included John Mitchell&#x27;s older brother Thomas (mentioned in the census as being foreman at the brewery in 1871), another John Mitchell (a cousin; c. 1820–1849), as well as at least three of John Lane&#x27;s brothers. Yet another John Mitchell, John Hoffe Mitchell, was joint executor of John Lane&#x27;s will.

In 1873, ownership passed to John Lane&#x27;s youngest son, Robert George. Robert, after brewing in Alton, Hampshire, and marrying Parisienne Louise Marie Julienne Isabel Jean dit Saussay in 1876, died of pneumonia in 1880, aged only 31. After this the brewery became the property of one Richard Alfred Glover, before being taken over by Glover Bell &amp; Co in 1887.

John Lane, his wife Eliza Beaven (Mitchell), four of their children – including Robert George and another son Frederick (who committed suicide by shooting himself in 1874) – are buried in Abney Park Cemetery. Buried next to them are members of the Mitchell family.

When the New London Brewery, of Lambeth, London, went into voluntary liquidation on 13 January 1925, their licensed houses were bought by the Wenlock Brewery.

Wenlock Fireside Ale was recreated starting from 1 November 1999 by the Museum Brewery, Burton, and was available throughout the year 2000.

==Building and interior==
The pub building, built in 1835, is a survivor of the wartime bombing of the area, and retains a traditional pub interior.

==Cask ale==
The Wenlock Arms is a renowned cask ale public house in London, and has been named North London Pub of the Year by the local CAMRA branch on four occasions since it reopened in 1994. The pub competes in the &quot;north&quot; category, despite its East End location, as CAMRA use postal districts to define their competition sectors.

==Cultural references==
&quot;Terror at Wenlock Brewery&quot; was published in 1998 by Stephen Sadler, and tells of The Blitz.

David Beckham used to join his grandfather for drinks at the Wenlock Arms, even after he became a superstar.

The Wenlock Arms features in the opening titles of the television show &quot;Al Murray&#x27;s Compete for the Meat&quot;.

The Wenlock Arms was used as a location for Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg&#x27;s film &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot;, released in 2013 starring Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan, and Rosamund Pike.

==Conservation==

In September 2010, news emerged that the Wenlock Arms was planned to be demolished, and in response a campaign to save the pub was started. On 7 September 2011, an application to demolish the existing building and replace it with a new development was registered with Hackney Council. The consultation period ran until 10 October 2011. There was also a new application (October 2012).

The Wenlock arms is now in a conservation area, and receives protection as a result. The decision to extend the Regents Canal Conservation Area was taken by Hackney Council (Cabinet) on 19 December 2011. After a period of closure, the pub was finally rescued after a vigorous campaign led by the local community and CAMRA. It reopened on 3 June 2013. The pub itself underwent renovation, floors upstairs being extended for residential accommodation.

<doc id="1052112" wikidata="Q21492553" url="?curid=1052112" title="Quilty">
<text>Quilty is an Irish family name which has spread throughout the English-speaking world.

==Origins and history==
The name &quot;Quilty&quot; is an Anglicized form of the ancient Gaelic name of &quot;Caoilte&quot; (pronounced: Kweelteh). There was a mythic Celtic warrior (c. 3rd Century A.D.) by the name of Caílte mac Rónáin, who was a member of the Fianna and the nephew of Fionn mac Cumhaill. According to legend he lived long enough to be baptized by St. Patrick (c.389-461). The book &quot;If You&#x27;re A Wee Bit Irish: a chart of old Irish families collected from folk tradition&quot; by William Durning (1978) recounts an alleged ancestry of Caoilte back to Adam. James Joyce (1882–1941) in chapter twelve of his masterpiece, Ulysses, (1922) has &quot;The tribe of Caolte&quot; as one of the twelve tribes of Ireland in a biblical parallel to the twelve tribes of Israel. The name is considered a sept of the dynastic Dál gCais of the Kingdom of Thomond, and has the motto &quot;Lámh Ládir an Nachtar&quot; meaning &quot;the strong hand uppermost.&quot;

There are various spellings of the name: Caoilte, Caolte, and Cuallta in Gaelic, and Kielty, Kealty, Keelty, Keilty, Kelty, Kilty, and Quilty (with or without an O&#x27; or Mc or Mac) in English. The most common variants are Kielty and Quilty.

The surname Quilty has no connection to the Irish word &quot;coillte&quot; or &quot;caol&quot;, which some sources have said. However, Edward MacLysaght writes in his 1964 book &quot;Supplement to Irish Families&quot;, that Quilty is a Munster name that has been mistakenly translated from the Irish word &quot;caol (&quot;slender) or &quot;coillte&quot;—plural of Irish word &quot;coill&quot; (wood). Coillte is the namesake of a town named Quilty located in the County Clare. Sources from the 14th and 15th century have the spelling as &quot;O&#x27;Kilte&quot; but ones from the 16th century onwards have spellings as &quot;Quilty&quot;, &quot;O&#x27;Quiltye&quot;, or other variants. While according to MacLysaght other alternatives for the names such as Kielty are found in the County Offaly, Roscommon, Galway, and Tyrone; while MacQuilty in the County Antrim. According to MacLysaght &quot;I have not discovered its origin, but it is presumably unconnected with O&#x27;Quilty.&quot;

=== Oldest Documented Quiltys ===
Some sources say that the oldest referenced Quilty is in the Annals of Ulster in the year 1169. Where a &quot;Muiredach Ua Cellaig&quot; is referenced. However the last name &quot;Ua Cellaig&quot; is an old form of the last name Kelly or Kelley rather than Quilty.

The first documented reference of a Quilty is given in a 1313 Justiciary Roll under the reign of Edward II (also known as Edward of Caernarfon). In this record an unnamed &quot;O&#x27;Kilte&quot; is mentioned as a servant of a Nobleman named John Harold. Where in Mowan, Lymerick when they were robbed of &quot;two affers worth 20s&quot;.

Richard O&#x27;Kilte is mentioned in the Calendar of Ormond Deeds, Volume 2, in an entry dated November 1405 during the 7th year of Henry IV. He is recorded as receiving payment for guarding a house of almonds, a duty assigned by warrant of James le Botiller, Earl of Ormond. His role, guarding a &quot;house of almonds&quot; is listed among various other transactions involving individuals responsible for different tasks related to the Earl’s estates in counties Kilkenny and Tipperary.

The first documented instance of an approximate to the modern most common spelling is given in Wexfordiana, Vol. VIII: Extracts from the Calendar of Memoranda Rolls of the Exchequer under the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. The writing describes a &quot;Dionisius O&#x27;Quiltye&quot; overseeing a transaction between a FitzMaurice and the Alderman of the City of Waterford on the 17th of September 1579. His occupation at this time is given as &quot;cleric&quot; within the Diocese of Ferns which is mostly located in the County Wexford. Denis is again mentioned in Fatsi Ecclesiæ Hibernicæ by Henry Cotton for the Province of Leinster, now with the surname spelt as &quot;Quilty&quot;. It shows him being recorded at a precentor for the Diocese of Ferns from 1587-1600. Cotton also emphasizes that the 1615 regal visitation book called him &quot;an ancient minister&quot;.

Thomas Laffan&#x27;s publication of the 1665-67 Hearth Money Rolls for the County Tipperary list a Morrish (Maurice?) O&#x27;Quiltye as of having lived in &quot;Bonnovoie&quot; in the parish of Sallahode-more in the barony of Clanwilliam.

=== Modern Distribution ===
As of 2014, the majority of people with the surname Quilty were located in English-speaking countries. In the United States, there were 982 individuals bearing the surname, followed by 630 in Australia, 593 in Canada, 308 in the United Kingdom, 301 in Ireland, 83 in New Zealand, and 22 in various other nations.

In 1850 there were over 75 families bearing the name of &quot;Quilty&quot; in Ireland, over half of them in County Limerick. As of 2005, there were about 300 families bearing the name of &quot;Quilty&quot; in the United States alone, almost half them in the northeast, with the highest concentrations in the states of Massachusetts, New York, Florida, Illinois, and California.

<doc id="1052113" wikidata="Q7982890" url="?curid=1052113" title="Wenlock Basin">
<text>The Wenlock Basin, is a 320 metre long canal basin on the Regent&#x27;s Canal, in the Hoxton area of the London Borough of Hackney, United Kingdom. The City Road Basin lies just to the west of Wharf Road and is in the neighbouring London Borough of Islington. 

There are private residential moorings at the North end, with their own entrance gate and entryphone on Wharf Road. The basin itself narrows considerably towards the South - and is not deep enough to be navigable by anything other than canoe.

Unlike the Regent&#x27;s Canal and City Road Basin, Wenlock Basin is not owned or managed by the Canal &amp; River Trust.

==History==
The basin was constructed in 1826 and is close to the entrance of the Islington Tunnel, where a tug service operated until the 1930s. The opening of the basin went badly wrong, with the cofferdam separating it from the Canal collapsing, prematurely filling the basin and leading to the water level of the canal falling by 13 inches. Traffic on the canal was halted until rainfall could restore the water levels.

The basin took the name of Wenlock Barns, a local farm. The name Wenlock was used by an electoral ward of the former Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch, it was also, for a time, the name of a ward in the London Borough of Hackney. 
==Residential developments==
Wenlock Basin is accessible only to residents. The development consists of the following buildings:
* The Royle Building, one of the earliest schemes on the basin, originally the Royle printworks at the junction of the Regent&#x27;s Canal and Wenlock Basin. Converted to almost 100 loft apartments with a small number of bachelor apartments newly built on the roof during the conversion.
* The Canal Building, next to the Royle Building and extending more directly along Regent&#x27;s Canal, is an art-deco style warehouse originally refurbished and sold as 79 shells.
* Union Wharf, A development of 90 loft-style apartments and live/work units designed and built by Persimmon Homes (formerly the Beazer Group).
* Estilo, A mixed-use development of 43 one, two and three-bedroom units overlooking Wenlock Basin completed in 2006 by Telford Homes.
* Micawber Wharf, a development of 18 studios, flats and live work/units completed in 2008. Designed by Stephen Davy Peter Smith Architects, and developed by Isotop.
*The Wenlock Building, New mixed use development of 82 units on the west side of the basin at its junction with the Regent&#x27;s Canal. Design by Johnson Naylor Architects, developed in a joint venture between Londonewcastle and Modern City Living, completed in late 2008.

==Businesses==
While no longer serving the original cargo handling and warehousing business, a number of modern businesses have office space on &quot;Wenlock Basin&quot;, either in the ground floor business units of the larger residential developments - or in their own property directly backing on to the basin. They include the Victoria Miro Gallery, a leading British contemporary art gallery in London run by Victoria Miro, and the British Ecological Society, a learned society in the field of Ecology.

<doc id="1052116" wikidata="Q2642304" url="?curid=1052116" title="François Levaillant">
<text>François Levaillant (born Vaillant, later in life as Le Vaillant, &quot;The Valiant&quot;) (6 August 1753 – 22 November 1824) was a French author, explorer, naturalist, zoological collector, travel writer, and noted ornithologist. He described many new species of birds based on birds he collected in Africa and several birds are named after him. He was among the first to use colour plates for illustrating birds and opposed the use of binomial nomenclature introduced by Carl Linnaeus, preferring instead to use descriptive French names such as the bateleur (meaning &quot;tumbler or tight-rope walker&quot;) for the distinctive African eagle.

==Life==
François Vaillant was born in Paramaribo, the capital of Dutch Guiana (Surinam), the son of Nicolas François, a French lawyer from Metz who had fled there after eloping with his mother Catherine Joséphine and then took up a position as the French Consul. Growing up amid forests, François took an interest in the local fauna, collecting birds and insects. His family returned to France in 1763. In 1772, François joined the Berry cavalry regiment as a cadet officer in Metz but was eventually rejected as an officer because he was not tall enough. He married Suzanne de Noor in 1773. He worked with a local apothecary, Becoeur, who had developed an arsenic-based soap to preserve birds. In 1777, he moved to Paris and started a career as a trader in natural history specimens.

===Cape travels===

He went to the Cape of Good Hope in 1780, at the age of 27, nominally as a gunner&#x27;s mate for the Dutch East India Company, but almost certainly sponsored by the Treasurer-General, Jacob Temminck with the understanding that he would strengthen Temminck&#x27;s collection. He decided to study the bird and animal life in their natural habitat. At that time, South Africa was a relatively unknown and exotic location and he collected specimens that would establish his reputation within the scientific community until July 1784 when he made his way back to Holland and France. He made three journeys, one around Cape Town and Saldanha Bay (April to August 1781), one eastwards from the Cape (December 1781 to May 1783) and the third to the Orange River and into Great Namaqualand (June 1783 to c. May 1784). Researchers have to some extent adjusted the dates supplied by Levaillant. During the first expedition his collection was on the vessel &quot;Middelburg&quot;, which was attacked and sunk by the English in Saldanha Bay. He did however manage to return with over 2000 specimens of birds, insects, mammals and plants. During this trip he changed his name to Le Vaillant.

An illustrative map of his travels was produced around 1790 for King Louis XVI. Measuring nine feet wide and six feet high, the map depicts the travels and the landscape met with. The cartographic elements of the map were made by Perrier with the insets of animals and landscapes by Van Leen. The birds were by Reinold. Sixty two pictures of fauna and flora were stuck onto the map. One of the animals depicted is the now extinct bluebuck.

===Return to Europe===

On his return he published &quot;Voyage dans l&#x27;intérieur de l&#x27;Afrique&quot; (1790, 2 vols.), and &quot;Second voyage dans l&#x27;intérieur de l&#x27;Afrique&quot; (1796, 3 vols.), both of which were best sellers across Europe, translated into several languages. He had his drafts edited by Casimir Varon. It has been suggested that the success of the first book drove him to become more creative in the descriptions of the second voyage, many parts of which are considered to be fiction. He also published &quot;Histoire naturelle des oiseaux d&#x27;Afrique&quot; (1796–1808, 6 vols.) with drawings by Jacques Barraband, &quot;Histoire naturelle des oiseaux de paradis&quot; (1801–06), &quot;Histoire naturelle des cotingas et des todiers&quot; (1804) and &quot;Histoire naturelle des calaos&quot; (1804). He rarely sketched the birds in their natural environment but collected the skins which were stuffed and mounted on his return. More talented artists were then commissioned to illustrate the specimens for printing. Levaillant&#x27;s illustrations often influenced scientific names given by, among others, Vieillot, Stephens and Wilkes.

He and De Noor divorced when divorce became legal during the French Revolution. By then he had already started a relationship with Pierrette Foyot, whom he married in Paris in June 1789. Pierrette was the daughter of judge Didier Francois Foyot of Sezanne. A dowry of 50,000 francs helped the couple and they had four children (including a son named Jean-Jacques Rousseau Levaillant who took an interest in ornithology). Levaillant claimed later to have been in prison during the time of the French Revolution but this was untrue—he was in fact close to many revolutionary figures and even applied for a post at the Natural History Museum through the Committee for Public Safety. Foyot&#x27;s family gave them an estate at La Noue, near Sézanne and Levaillant moved between La Noue and Paris where he kept up a business as naturalist. After Foyot&#x27;s death in May 1798, Levaillant lived with a younger woman, Rose Dubouchet, with whom he had four children. He died in La Noue in 1824. Four of his sons served in the French army, all earning the Légion d&#x27;honneur. By the time of his death, the family name had become Levaillant. Through Foyot&#x27;s family, he was a grand uncle of the French poet Charles Baudelaire, who read Levaillant avidly as a young student.

==Specimens==
Levaillant&#x27;s fame as collector in his lifetime was based on bringing back the first giraffe skeleton to France. He also sold a significant collection to the Paris Natural History Museum, including in the sale not only the Bluebuck, a major collection of African birds, but insects and the secret of Becoeur&#x27;s arsenical soap, which was widely used in taxidermy till the 1950s. Over 2,000 bird skins were sent to Jacob Temminck, who had financed the expedition, and these were later studied by his son Coenraad Jacob Temminck and included in the collection of the museum at Leiden. Other specimens were kept in the cabinet of Joan Raye, heer van Breukelerwaert (1737-1823). This collection was bought by the &quot;Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie&quot; in the late 1820s, which is now the Naturalis in Leiden.

==Traveller and ethnographer==

As a traveller in Africa, Levaillant tended to describe the African people with sympathy. He shared Rousseau&#x27;s idea of the &quot;Noble savage&quot; and condemnation of civilization. He called his &quot;Hottentot&quot; companion Klaas his brother and his equal and was one of the first to describe a close relationship between Western explorer and an indigenous man. One of Levaillant&#x27;s acquisitions on his travels was a chacma baboon that he called Kees. In his writings, he wrote about how he shared food and drink with Kees and considered him a simple soul who was more loyal than many humans. He described the beauty of Narina, a name that he used for a young Gonaqua woman, naming her after a flower. His portrayal of their flirtation influenced early South African novels before such relationships became less socially acceptable in the later colonial period. The portrayal of Narina was probably influenced by the images of exotic beauty from Tahiti in other travelers&#x27; accounts. She was a precursor to Sarah Baartman the Hottentot venus. He also perceived Dutch settlers in a negative way, attacking them for acting brutally against indigenous people. A brave experimenter, he allowed a Hottentot medicine man to diagnose him when he fell ill and wrote of the successful treatment and cure. By travelling around southern Africa, observing the wild and reflecting upon himself and mankind, it has been claimed that Le Vaillant was the pioneer of a genre of travel writing while also inventing the idea of a wildlife &quot;safari&quot; although he did not use that word of Arabian origin.

==Ornithology==

Le Vaillant was opposed to the systematic nomenclature introduced by Carl Linnaeus and only gave French names to the species that he discovered. Some of these are still in use as common names, such as bateleur, the French word for tumbler, for the way the bird playfully falls in flight. Other naturalists were left to assign binomial names to his new discoveries, some of these commemorate his name:
*Crested barbet (&quot;Trachyphonus vaillantii&quot;) 
*Levaillant&#x27;s cisticola (&quot;Cisticola tinniens&quot;) 
*Levaillant&#x27;s cuckoo (&quot;Clamator levaillantii&quot;) 
*Levaillant&#x27;s parrot also known as the Cape Parrot (&quot;Poicephalus robustus&quot;) 
*Levaillant&#x27;s tchagra (&quot;Tchagra tchagra&quot;) 
*Levaillant&#x27;s woodpecker (&quot;Picus vaillantii&quot;) 

Le Vaillant was among the first to consider the use of coloured plates of birds in his descriptions. He mounted his bird specimens, preserved with arsenic soap, in lifelike positions and the illustrators showed them in near realistic poses. He ensured that the fiscal shrike was shown along with an insect impaled on thorn. His descriptions of bird behaviour were also considered to be pioneering. He called the African fish eagle &quot;Vocifer&quot; for its distinctive and loud yelping calls made while throwing back its head. He was also the first to use musical annotation to describe bird song. A very careful observer of behaviour, he was among the first to notice that the rosy-faced lovebird (&quot;Agapornis roseicollis&quot;) nested within the nests of the sociable weaver (&quot;Philetairus socius&quot;). It has been suggested that he may well have been a major influence in the style and art of John James Audubon.

An analysis of Le Vaillant&#x27;s collections made by Carl Sundevall in 1857 identified ten birds that could not be assigned definitely to any species, ten that were fabricated from multiple species and fifty species that could not have come from the Cape region as claimed.

==Legacy==

The South American fish &quot;Brachyplatystoma vaillantii&quot; is named after him.

<text>Baron Dufferin and Claneboye, of Ballyleidy and Killyleagh in County Down, Northern Ireland, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created on 30 July 1800 for Dame Dorcas Blackwood, widow of Sir John Blackwood, 2nd Baronet, Member of the Irish Parliament for Killyleagh and Bangor, in return for support for the Union of Ireland and the United Kingdom.

==History==
The peerage had been intended for Sir John in return for his support for the Union with the Kingdom of Great Britain. The Blackwood baronetcy, of Killyleagh in the County of Down, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland in 1763 for Robert Blackwood, the father of Sir John Blackwood. He was the son of John Blackwood and Ursula Hamilton, the daughter and co-heir of Robert Hamilton of Killyleagh, County Down. The Blackwood family, originally of Scottish descent, were prominent landowners in County Down and controlled the borough constituency of Killyleagh in the Irish Parliament. Lady Dufferin and Claneboye was the daughter of James Stevenson, son of Colonel Hans Stevenson and Anne Hamilton, daughter of James Hamilton, son of Archibald Hamilton, of Halcraig, Lanarkshire, brother of James Hamilton, 1st Viscount Claneboye. Her great-grandfather James Hamilton had become the sole heir of Lord Claneboye when the first Viscount&#x27;s grandson, Henry Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Clanbrassil and 3rd Viscount Claneboye, died in 1675.

Lady Dufferin and Claneboye was succeeded by her son, the second Baron, who had already succeeded his father as third Baronet. He represented Killyleagh in the Irish House of Commons and Helston and Aldeburgh in the British House of Commons and was also an Irish representative peer from 1820 to 1836. He was childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Baron. The latter&#x27;s grandson, the fifth Baron, was a prominent Liberal politician, diplomat and colonial administrator, and notably served as Governor General of Canada and Viceroy of India. In 1850, at the age of 23, he was created Baron Clandeboye, of Clandeboye in the County of Down, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him a seat in the House of Lords. In 1871 he was created Viscount Clandeboye, of Clandeboye in the County of Down, and Earl of Dufferin, in the County of Down, and in 1888 he was even further honoured when he was made Earl of Ava, in the Province of Burma, and Marquess of Dufferin and Ava, in the County of Down and in the Province of Burma. These titles were also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord Dufferin and Ava also assumed by royal licence the additional surname of Hamilton in 1862 and that of Temple (which was the maiden name of his father&#x27;s mother) in 1872.

His eldest son and heir apparent Archibald Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, Earl of Ava, was killed at the Siege of Ladysmith during the Second Boer War while serving as a war correspondent. He was unmarried and the Marquess was therefore succeeded by the second son, the second Marquess. On his death, the titles passed to another brother, the third Marquess. He was a soldier and also served as Speaker of the Senate of Northern Ireland. Lord Dufferin and Ava died in an air crash and he was succeeded by his son, the fourth Marquess. He notably held office as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies in the government of Neville Chamberlain.

After his death in the Second World War, the titles were inherited by his six-year-old son, the fifth Marquess, later a well-known patron of arts. He was childless and on his death in 1988 the marquessate, earldoms, viscountcy and barony of Clandeboye (created in 1850) became extinct. His widow, Lindy, Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava lived at the Clandeboye Estate until her death on 26 October 2020.

The last Marquess was succeeded in the baronetcy and barony of Dufferin and Claneboye by his distant relative Sir Francis George Blackwood, 7th Baronet, of the Navy (see Blackwood baronets of the Navy (1814)), who became the tenth Baron. Since 1991, the titles have been held by the latter&#x27;s son, the eleventh Baron. Like his father he lives in Australia.

<doc id="1052127" wikidata="Q361565" url="?curid=1052127" title="James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond">
<text>James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond, 4th Duke of Lennox KG (6 April 1612 – 30 March 1655), lord of the Manor of Cobham, Kent, was a Scottish nobleman. A third cousin of King Charles I, he was a Privy Councillor and a key member of the Royalist party in the English Civil War. In 1641–42, he served as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. He spent five months in exile in 1643, returning to England to defend the city of Oxford for the king.

==Origins==
He was the eldest son of Esmé Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox (1579–1624) by his wife Katherine Clifton, 2nd Baroness Clifton (c.1592–1637).

==Career==
He inherited the Dukedom of Lennox on his father&#x27;s death in 1624 and in 1625, at the age of 13, was made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the newly crowned King Charles I, who knighted him on 29 June 1630 and invested him as a knight of Order of the Garter in 1633.

==Dukedom of Richmond==
The Earldom of Richmond had become absorbed into the crown in 1485 when Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, became King Henry VII. The Scottish connection to the Richmond title began in 1613 when James Stewart&#x27;s uncle Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox (1574–1624), was created by King James I as Earl of Richmond and was later, in 1623, created by the same king Duke of Richmond and Earl of Newcastle. However he died childless a year later when all his titles (excepting those inherited from his father, namely Duke and Earl of Lennox) became extinct. On 21 August 1637 he was created the 3rd Baron Clifton via his mother.

The title Duke of Richmond was re-created in 1641 by King Charles I for Ludovic&#x27;s nephew and eventual heir James Stewart, 4th Duke of Lennox, who was also granted Cobham Hall and the manor of Cobham, Kent, which became his main residence.

==Marriage and children==
On 3 August 1637, he married Mary Villiers, a daughter of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, by whom he had issue:
*Esmé Stewart, 2nd Duke of Richmond, 5th Duke of Lennox (1649–1660) who died aged 10 in 1660, whereupon both titles descended to his first-cousin Charles Stewart, 3rd Duke of Richmond, 6th Duke of Lennox (1638–1672).
*Lady Mary Stewart (10 July 1651 – 4 July 1668), Baroness Clifton in 1660; married Richard Butler, 1st Earl of Arran. No issue.

==Death and burial==
He died on 30 March 1655 aged 42 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

<text>The Machinist is a 2004 psychological thriller film directed by Brad Anderson and written by Scott Kosar. It stars Christian Bale as the title character, a machinist struggling with paranoia and delusion after being unable to sleep for an entire year. Jennifer Jason Leigh, Aitana Sánchez-Gijón, John Sharian, and Michael Ironside appear in supporting roles.

The film drew attention due to Bale&#x27;s commitment, having lost in preparation for his role. Upon release, &quot;The Machinist&quot; was well received by critics, with praise for Bale&#x27;s performance, and grossed $8.2 million on a $5 million budget. In later years it has gained a cult status.

==Plot==
Trevor Reznik is a machinist whose insomnia has led to him becoming emaciated. His appearance and behavior keep his coworkers away, and they eventually turn against him when he is involved in an accident, which causes his coworker, Miller, to lose his left arm. Trevor, who was distracted by an unfamiliar coworker named Ivan, is blamed for the accident. No one at the factory knows of Ivan and there are no records of him. Trevor seems to find comfort in the arms of Stevie, a prostitute with genuine affection for him, and with Maria, a waitress at an airport diner he frequents. He is haunted by brief flashes of recurring imagery, and things such as his car cigarette lighter take on a menacing air. A mysterious series of post-it notes appears on his refrigerator, depicting a game of hangman.

These vague incidents send him further into paranoia, but he nonetheless attempts to establish a relationship with Maria. Meeting her at an amusement park, Trevor goes with her son Nicholas on a dark ride called &quot;Route 666&quot;. The ride starts as a harmless scare ride, but begins to show increasingly disturbing images as it advances, until its flashing lights cause Nicholas to suffer an epileptic seizure. No longer able to think clearly, Trevor suspects that the bizarre events are a concerted effort to drive him insane, as do recurring clues such as a photo of Ivan fishing with Trevor&#x27;s coworker Reynolds, which he discovers in Ivan&#x27;s wallet when Ivan leaves it unattended in a pub. Another near-accident at work causes Trevor to lash out in rage at his coworkers; as a result, he is immediately fired. Increasingly distracted and alienated, Trevor forgets to pay his utility bills and his electricity is disconnected. A dark, viscous liquid begins trickling out of the freezer, coating the refrigerator door with streaks of what appears to be blood.

After several attempts to confront Ivan, Trevor tries to trace his license plate, but runs out of gas while in pursuit of his car. When a DMV clerk insists that personal information cannot be released unless a crime has been committed, Trevor throws himself in front of a car in order to accuse Ivan of committing a hit and run. He files a police report with Ivan&#x27;s plate number, only to be baffled when he is told that the car in question is his own, and that he had reported it totaled one year ago. He flees the police and goes to Stevie, who bathes and clothes him, but he is disturbed by the discovery of the photo of Ivan and Reynolds framed in her home. Trevor accuses her of conspiring against him. Confused, Stevie says the picture is of Reynolds and Trevor, but he refuses to look at it, and after a violent argument, Stevie throws him out. He goes to the airport diner, but is told by an unfamiliar waitress that they&#x27;ve never had an employee named Maria. The waitress at the counter tells Trevor she has served him every day for a year, and, in all that time, he spoke so little that she thought he was mute.

Trevor sees Ivan take Nicholas into Trevor&#x27;s apartment and, fearing the worst, sneaks inside. Nicholas is nowhere to be seen and doesn&#x27;t respond to Trevor&#x27;s calls. Trevor confronts Ivan in the bathroom, and Ivan tells him &quot;you know he&#x27;s dead&quot;. Trevor, believing Ivan has killed Nicholas and his body is in the bathtub, attacks and seemingly kills him. He pulls back the shower curtain, only to find the bathtub empty. He goes to the refrigerator and opens it to find rotting fish, matching those in the fishing photo, which he at last realizes was of himself with Reynolds, just as Stevie claimed; Trevor hallucinated Ivan&#x27;s presence in the photo. Trevor takes a rolled-up carpet containing Ivan&#x27;s body to the ocean to dispose of it, only for the rug to unroll as he does so and reveal nothing inside. Ivan, unharmed, approaches Trevor from behind, and laughs as he tells Trevor that he has some explaining to do.

Trevor stares into a mirror at home, repeating the words, &quot;I know who you are.&quot; He remembers that one year prior, a then-healthy Trevor ran over and killed a boy (identical to Nicholas) after taking his eyes off the road to use the car&#x27;s cigarette lighter, which was witnessed by the boy&#x27;s mother (identical to Maria). Trevor fled the scene in his car, and the resulting guilt became the root of his insomnia, emaciation and repressed memories. Ivan was a figment of Trevor&#x27;s imagination and a manifestation of his guilt. He fills the missing letters on the hangman note, spelling out &quot;killer&quot;. The next day, he puts all his personal items in boxes meant to be donated, as he tells his landlord. He briefly considers going to the airport to escape, but instead drives to police headquarters. He is accompanied by a silent but encouraging Ivan, who bids him an approving farewell outside the station as he enters and confesses to the hit-and-run. Two police officers escort Trevor to a cell, where after stating that he only wants to sleep, he does, for the first time in a year.

==Production==

Despite its setting in California, the film was shot in its entirety in and around Barcelona, Spain. It was produced by the &quot;Fantastic Factory&quot; label of Filmax and Castelao Productions.

Christian Bale strenuously dieted for over four months prior to filming, as his character needed to look drastically thin. According to a biography of Bale written by his former assistant, this daily diet consisted of &quot;water, an apple and one cup of coffee per day, with the occasional whiskey&quot; (approximately 55–260 calories). According to the DVD commentary, he lost , reducing his body weight to . Bale wanted to continue down to , but the filmmakers would not allow it due to health concerns. In fact, the target weight to which the 6 ft (183 cm) Bale dropped was intended for a much shorter actor, but Bale insisted on seeing if he could make it anyway. At the end of filming he was left with just six weeks to regain enough mass to be ready for the screen test for his role in &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, which he achieved through weightlifting and binging on pizzas and ice cream.

Brad Anderson hurt his back during filming and directed much of the film while lying on a gurney.

The name Trevor Reznik is derived from Trent Reznor, the founder and primary creative force behind the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, and the original script had Nine Inch Nails lyrics on the first page. Other Nine Inch Nails tributes include early press articles describing Reznik as experiencing a &quot;downward spiral&quot;.

However, the strongest literary influence is the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky. In the DVD commentary, writer Scott Kosar states that he was influenced by Dostoevsky&#x27;s novel &quot;The Double&quot;.
* The character Reznik is shown reading Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Idiot&quot; early in the film.
* When Reznik is riding the &quot;Route 666&quot; attraction, one of the faux marquees reads &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;.
* The number plate Reznik is reading from the red convertible (743 CRN) is the reverse of his Dodge (NRC 347).
* In Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, the character who is visited by a devil is named Ivan. In the 1969 film, Ivan and his devil are played by the same actor (Kirill Lavrov). At the end of the film, as Reznik is sitting in his cell, he&#x27;s wearing a shirt reading &quot;Justice Brothers&quot;.

<text>The human action cycle is a psychological model which describes the steps humans take when they interact with computer systems. The model was proposed by Donald A. Norman, a scholar in the discipline of human–computer interaction. The model can be used to help evaluate the efficiency of a user interface (UI). Understanding the cycle requires an understanding of the user interface design principles of affordance, feedback, visibility and tolerance.

The human action cycle describes how humans may form goals and then develop a series of steps required to achieve that goal, using the computer system. The user then executes the steps, thus the model includes both cognitive activities and physical activities.

== The three stages of the human action cycle ==

The model is divided into three stages of seven steps in total, and is (approximately) as follows:

=== Goal formation stage ===
* 1. Goal formation.

=== Execution stage ===
* 2. Translation of goals into a set of unordered tasks required to achieve goals.
* 3. Sequencing the tasks to create the action sequence.
* 4. Executing the action sequence.

=== Evaluation stage ===
* 5. Perceiving the results after having executed the action sequence.
* 6. Interpreting the actual outcomes based on the expected outcomes.
* 7. Comparing what happened with what the user wished to happen.

== Use in evaluation of user interfaces ==

Typically, an evaluator of the user interface will pose a series of questions for each of the cycle&#x27;s steps, an evaluation of the answer provides useful information about where the user interface may be inadequate or unsuitable. These questions might be:

* Step 1, Forming a goal:
** Do the users have sufficient domain and task knowledge and sufficient understanding of their work to form goals? 
** Does the UI help the users form these goals?
* Step 2, Translating the goal into a task or a set of tasks:
** Do the users have sufficient domain and task knowledge and sufficient understanding of their work to formulate the tasks?
** Does the UI help the users formulate these tasks?
* Step 3, Planning an action sequence:
** Do the users have sufficient domain and task knowledge and sufficient understanding of their work to formulate the action sequence?
** Does the UI help the users formulate the action sequence?
* Step 4, Executing the action sequence:
** Can typical users easily learn and use the UI?
** Do the actions provided by the system match those required by the users?
** Are the affordance and visibility of the actions good?
** Do the users have an accurate mental model of the system?
** Does the system support the development of an accurate mental model?
* Step 5, Perceiving what happened:
** Can the users perceive the system’s state?
** Does the UI provide the users with sufficient feedback about the effects of their actions?
* Step 6, Interpreting the outcome according to the users’ expectations:
** Are the users able to make sense of the feedback?
** Does the UI provide enough feedback for this interpretation?
* Step 7, Evaluating what happened against what was intended:
** Can the users compare what happened with what they were hoping to achieve?

<doc id="1052154" wikidata="Q2632514" url="?curid=1052154" title="Interpersonal attraction">
<text>Interpersonal attraction, as a part of social psychology, is the study of the attraction between people which leads to the development of platonic or romantic relationships. It is distinct from perceptions such as physical attractiveness, and involves views of &quot;what is&quot; and &quot;what is not&quot; considered beautiful or attractive.

Within the study of social psychology, interpersonal attraction is related to how much one likes or dislikes another person. It can be viewed as a force acting between two people that tends to draw them together and to resist their separation. When measuring interpersonal attraction, one must refer to the qualities of the attracted and those of the attractor to achieve predictive accuracy. It is suggested that to determine attraction, both the personalities and the situation must be taken into account.

==Measurement==
In social psychology, interpersonal attraction is most-frequently measured using the Interpersonal Attraction Judgment Scale developed by Donn Byrne. It is a scale in which a subject rates another person on factors such as intelligence, knowledge of current events, morality, adjustment, likability, and desirability as a work partner. This scale seems to be directly related with other measures of social attraction such as social choice, feelings of desire for a date, sexual partner or spouse, voluntary physical proximity, frequency of eye contact, etc.

Kiesler and Goldberg analyzed a variety of response measures that were typically utilized as measures of attraction and extracted two factors: the first, characterized as primarily socioemotional, included variables such as liking, the desirability of the person&#x27;s inclusion in social clubs and parties, seating choices, and lunching together. The second factor included variables such as voting for, admiration and respect for, and also seeking the opinion of the target. Another widely used measurement technique scales verbal responses expressed as subjective ratings or judgments of the person of interest.

==Causes and effects==
There are factors that lead to interpersonal attraction. Studies suggest that all factors involve social reinforcement. The most frequently studied include physical attractiveness, propinquity (frequency of interaction), familiarity, similarity, complementarity, reciprocal liking, and reinforcement. The impact of familiarity, for example, is shown in the way physical proximity and interaction enhances cohesiveness, a social concept that facilitates communication and positive attitude towards a particular individual on account of similarities or the ability to satisfy important goals. Similarity is believed to more likely lead to liking and attraction than differences. Numerous studies have focused on the role of physical attractiveness to personal attraction. One finding was that people tend to attribute positive qualities such as intelligence, competence, and warmth to individuals who have a pleasing physical appearance.
=== Physical attractiveness ===
Physical attractiveness is the perception of the physical traits of an individual human person as pleasing or beautiful. It can include various implications, such as sexual attractiveness, cuteness, similarity and physique.

Judgment of attractiveness of physical traits is partly universal to all human cultures, partly dependent on culture or society or time period, partly biological, and partly subjective and individual.

According to a study determining the golden ratio for facial beauty, the most attractive face is one with average distances between facial features, and an average length and width of the face itself. Facial attractiveness, or beauty, can also be determined by symmetry. If a face is asymmetrical, this can indicate unhealthy genetic information. Therefore, if a face is symmetrical (see facial symmetry), healthy genetic information is implied. People will judge potential mates based on the physical expression of the genetic health, which is their apparent attractiveness. This supports the good genes theory, which indicates that attractiveness is seen as a way to ensure that offspring will have the healthiest genes and therefore the best chance of survival. Certain traits that indicate good genes (such as clear skin or facial symmetry) are seen as desirable when choosing a partner.

=== Personality ===
Studies have reported mixed findings on whether or not similarity in personality traits between people in interpersonal relationships (romantic, friendship, etc.) is necessary or essential for relationship satisfaction. This has been due to different types of research methodologies used to reach conclusions. It is argued that the previous lack of evidence that congruence in personality traits between two people is an important predictor for relationship satisfaction has been due to individuals making judgements of each other at a salient level (local group) rather than a global group comparison (reference-group effect).

A 2014 study suggested that people who tend to portray positive personality traits such as kindness are typically seen as more attractive than people who portray negative personality traits.

===Similarity attraction effect===
The proverb &quot;birds of a feather flock together&quot; has been used to illustrate that similarity is a crucial determinant of interpersonal attraction. Studies about attraction indicate that people are strongly attracted to lookalikes in physical and social appearance. This similarity is in the broadest sense: similarity in bone-structure, characteristics, life goals and physical appearance. The more these points match, the happier, satisfied and prosperous people are in these relationships.

The lookalike effect plays the role of self-affirmation. A person typically enjoys receiving confirmation of aspects of his or her life, ideas, attitudes and personal characteristics, and people seem to look for an image of themselves to spend their life with. A basic principle of interpersonal attraction is the rule of similarity: similarity is attractive — an underlying principle that applies to both friendships and romantic relationships. The proportion of attitudes shared correlates well with the degree of interpersonal attraction. Cheerful people like to be around other cheerful people and negative people would rather be around other negative people. A 2004 study, based on indirect evidence, concluded that humans choose mates based partly on facial resemblance to themselves.

According to Morry&#x27;s attraction-similarity model (2007), there is a lay belief that people with actual similarity produce initial attraction. The perceived similarity is either self-serving, as in a friendship, or relationship-serving, as in a romantic relationship. In a 1963 study, Theodore Newcomb pointed out that people tend to change perceived similarity to obtain balance in a relationship. Additionally, perceived but not actual similarity was found to predict interpersonal attraction during a face-to-face initial romantic encounter.

In a 1988 study, Lydon, Jamieson &amp; Zanna suggest that interpersonal similarity and attraction are multidimensional constructs in which people are attracted to people similar to themselves in demographics, physical appearance, attitudes, interpersonal style, social and cultural background, personality, preferred interests and activities, and communication and social skills. Newcomb&#x27;s earlier 1961 study on college-dorm roommates also suggested that individuals with shared backgrounds, academic achievements, attitudes, values, and political views typically became friends.

==== Physical appearance ====
The matching hypothesis proposed by sociologist Erving Goffman suggests that people are more likely to form long standing relationships with those who are equally matched in social attributes, like physical attractiveness. The study by researchers Walster and Walster supported the matching hypothesis by showing that partners who were similar in terms of physical attractiveness expressed the most liking for each other. Another study also found evidence that supported the matching hypothesis: photos of dating and engaged couples were rated in terms of attractiveness, and a definite tendency was found for couples of similar attractiveness to date or engage. Several studies support this evidence of similar facial attractiveness. Penton-Voak, Perrett and Peirce (1999) found that subjects rated the pictures with their own face morphed into it as more attractive. DeBruine (2002) demonstrated in her research how subjects entrusted more money to their opponents in a game play, when the opponents were presented as similar to them. Little, Burt &amp; Perrett (2006) examined similarity in sight for married couples and found that the couples were assessed at the same age and level of attractiveness.

A speed-dating experiment done on graduate students from Columbia University showed that although physical attractiveness is preferred in a potential partner, men show a greater preference for it than women. However, more recent work suggests that sex differences in stated ideal partner-preferences for physical attractiveness disappear when examining actual preferences for real-life potential partners. For example, Eastwick and Finkel (2008) failed to find sex differences in the association between initial ratings of physical attractiveness and romantic interest in potential partners during a speed dating paradigm.

==== Quality of voice ====
In addition to physical looks, quality of voice has also been shown to enhance interpersonal attraction. Oguchi and Kikuchi (1997) had 25 female students from one university rank the level of vocal attraction, physical attraction, and overall interpersonal attraction of 4 male students from another university. Vocal and physical attractiveness had independent effects on overall interpersonal attraction. In a second part of the same study, these results were replicated in a larger sample of students for both genders (62 subjects, 20 males and 42 females with 16 target students, 8 males and 8 females). Similarly, Zuckerman, Miyake and Hodgins (1991) found that both vocal and physical attractiveness contributed significantly to observers&#x27; ratings of targets for general attractiveness. These results suggest that when people evaluate one&#x27;s voice as attractive, they also tend to evaluate that person as physically attractive.

==== Attitudes ====
Based on cognitive consistency theories, difference in attitudes and interests can lead to dislike and avoidance whereas similarity in attitudes promotes social attraction. Miller (1972) pointed out that attitude similarity activates the perceived attractiveness and favorability information from each other, whereas dissimilarity would reduce the impact of these cues.

The studies by Jamieson, Lydon and Zanna (1987–88) showed that attitude similarity could predict how people evaluate their respect for each other, and also predict social and intellectual first impressions – the former by activity preference similarity and the latter by value-based attitude similarity. In intergroup comparisons, high attitude-similarity would lead to homogeneity among in-group members whereas low attitude-similarity would lead to diversity among in-group members, promoting social attraction and achieving high group performance in different tasks.

Although attitude similarity and attraction are linearly related, attraction may not contribute significantly to attitude change.

====Other social and cultural aspects====
Byrne, Clore and Worchel (1966) suggested that people with similar economic status are likely to be attracted to each other. Buss &amp; Barnes (1986) also found that people prefer their romantic partners to be similar in certain demographic characteristics, including religious background, political orientation and socio-economic status.

Researchers have shown that interpersonal attraction was positively correlated to personality similarity. People are inclined to desire romantic partners who are similar to themselves on agreeableness, conscientiousness, extroversion, emotional stability, openness to experience, and attachment style.

Activity similarity was especially predictive of liking judgments, which affects the judgments of attraction. According to the post-conversation measures of social attraction, tactical similarity was positively correlated with partner satisfaction and global competence ratings, but was uncorrelated with the opinion change and perceived persuasiveness measures.

When checking similar variables they were also seen as more similar on a number of personality characteristics. This study found that the length of the average relationship was related to perceptions of similarity; the couples who were together longer were seen as more equal. This effect can be attributed to the fact that when time passes by couples become more alike through shared experiences, or that couples that are alike stay together longer.

Similarity has effects on starting a relationship by initial attraction to know each other. It is shown that high attitude similarity resulted in a significant increase in initial attraction to the target person and high attitude dissimilarity resulted in a decrease of initial attraction. Similarity also promotes relationship commitment. Study on heterosexual dating couples found that similarity in intrinsic values of the couple was linked to relationship commitment and stability.

Social homogamy refers to &quot;passive, indirect effects on spousal similarity&quot;. The result showed that age and education level are crucial in affecting the mate preference. Because people with similar age study and interact more in the same form of the school, propinquity effect (i.e., the tendency of people to meet and spend time with those who share the common characteristics) plays a significant impact in spousal similarity. Convergence refers to an increasing similarity with time. Although the previous research showed that there is a greater effect on attitude and value than on personality traits, however, it is found that initial assortment (i.e., similarity within couples at the beginning of marriage) rather than convergence, plays a crucial role in explaining spousal similarity.

Active assortment refers to direct effects on choosing someone similar to oneself in mating preferences. The data showed that there is a greater effect on political and religious attitudes than on personality traits. A follow-up issue on the reason of the finding was raised. The concepts of idiosyncratic (i.e. different individuals have different mate preferences) and consensual (i.e. a consensus of preference on some prospective mates to others) in mate preference. The data showed that mate preference on political and religious bases tend to be idiosyncratic, for example, a Catholic would be more likely to choose a mate who is also a Catholic, as opposed to a Buddhist. Such idiosyncratic preferences produce a high level of active assortment which plays a vital role in affecting spousal similarity. In summary, active assortment plays a large role, whereas convergence has little evidence on showing such effect.

===Propinquity effect===
The propinquity effect relies on the observation that: &quot;The more we see and interact with a person, the more likely he or she is to become our friend or sexual partner.&quot; This effect is very similar to the mere exposure effect in that the more a person is exposed to a stimulus, the more the person likes it; however, there are exceptions. Familiarity can also occur without physical exposure. Recent studies show that relationships formed over the Internet resemble those developed face-to-face, in terms of perceived quality and depth.

===Exposure effect===
The exposure effect, also known as the familiarity principle, states that the more a person is exposed to something, the more they come to like it. This applies equally to both objects and people. A clear illustration is in a 1992 study: the researchers had four women of similar appearance attend a large college course over a semester such that each woman attended a different number of sessions (0, 5, 10, or 15). Students then rated the women for perceived familiarity, attractiveness and similarity at the end of the term. Results indicated a strong effect of exposure on attraction that was mediated by the effect of exposure on familiarity. However, exposure does not always increase attraction. For example, the social allergy effect can occur when a person grows increasingly annoyed by and hypersensitive to another&#x27;s repeated behaviors instead of growing more fond of his or her idiosyncrasies over time.

=== Pheromones ===
Certain pheromones secreted by animals, including humans, can attract others, and this is viewed as being attracted to smell. Human sex pheromones may play a role in human attraction, although it is unclear how well humans can actually sense the pheromones of another.

==Types of attraction==
Split attraction model describes different types of attraction separating different aspects of experiences people may have. They can roughly be grouped into physical and non-physical. Physical being: sexual, sensual, aesthetic... Non-physical may include emotional, mental (intellectual), spiritual...

Sensual attraction is a type of physical attraction to another person involving all the senses, although usually the sense of touch is considered first of all. Sensual attraction is defined as the drive, desire to have non-sexual forms of touch such as sensual cuddling, kissing, holding hands, hugging, massage etc. with another person in particular and other sensual activities like experiencing their voice, odor, taste. Asensual (sometimes known in short as asen) is an identity on the asensual spectrum (asen-spec) defined by a lack of sensual attraction. For non-asensual also known as allosensual people, sensual attraction is involuntary, and possibly even occurs when someone does not know the other person (though one might not act on it). Asensual people do not have this innate desire to have sensual experiences with any specific person.
Asensuality refers to the way sensual attraction is experienced, not to how it is acted upon. How asensual people feel about touching others and/or being touched by others and other sensual activities can vastly vary. They may feel disconnected from the idea of engaging in sensual activities or even be repulsed by the concept of sensuality. Terms like touch-averse/repulsed, touch-indifferent, touch-favorable, or touch-ambivalent can be used to describe some of these feelings. Some asensual people do engage in sensual activities involving other people. This could be for any reason, such as satisfying overall sensual drive not directed toward a particular person, meeting their sensory needs or those of a friend, partner/partners. They may also meet their sensory needs by using a weighted or heated blanket, cuddling with a stuffed animal or pet etc. Being asensual does not mean that one is unable to experience other types of attraction like sexual, aesthetic, emotional etc. including they may very much enjoy sexual activities. It is also important to remember that one can receive pleasure usually associated with a form of attraction without actually feeling that form of attraction. The term &quot;asensual&quot; can also be used as an umbrella term to describe someone on the asensual spectrum.

Some identities on the asensual spectrum are Asenflux, Greysensual (Grey Asen), Demisensual, Aegosensual, Cupiosensual, Homosensual etc.

=== Chemistry ===
In the context of relationships, chemistry is a simple emotion that two people get when they share a special connection. It is very early in one&#x27;s relationship that they can intuitively work out whether they have positive or negative chemistry.

Some people describe chemistry in metaphorical terms, such as &quot;like peanut butter and jelly&quot;, or &quot;like a performance&quot;. It can be described in the terms of mutual feelings — &quot;a connection, a bond or common feeling between two people&quot;, or as a chemical process — &quot;[it] stimulates love or sexual attraction...brain chemicals are definitely involved&quot;. A common misconception is that chemistry is an unconscious decision, informed by a complex blend of criteria.

Some of the core components of chemistry are: &quot;non-judgment, similarity, mystery, attraction, mutual trust, and effortless communication&quot;. Chemistry can be described as the combination of &quot;love, lust, infatuation, and a desire to be involved intimately with someone&quot;.

Research suggests that &quot;not everyone experiences chemistry&quot;, and that &quot;chemistry occurred most often between people who are down-to-earth and sincere&quot;. This is because &quot;if a person is comfortable with themselves, they are better able to express their true self to the world, which makes it easier to get to know them...even if perspectives on important matters differed.&quot; Sharing similarities is also deemed essential to chemistry as &quot;feeling understood is essential to forming relational bonds.&quot;

There are various psychological, physical and emotional symptoms of having good chemistry with another person. It has been described as a &quot;combination of basic psychological arousal combined with a feeling of pleasure&quot;. The nervous system gets aroused, causing one to get adrenaline in the form of &quot;rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, and sensations of excitement that are often similar to sensations associated with danger&quot;. Other physical symptoms include &quot;blood pressure go[ing] up a little, the skin...flush[ing], the face and ears...turn[ing] red and...[a] feeling of weakness in the knees&quot;. However, all these symptoms vary on an individual basis, and not all individuals may experience the same symptoms. One can feel a sense of obsession over the other person, longing for &quot;the day [when they return] to that person&quot;. One can also uncontrollably smile whenever thinking about the other person.

There is some debate over whether one can artificially create chemistry if they are &quot;not initially feeling it&quot;. While some people hold that it is something that you &quot;can&#x27;t learn and can&#x27;t teach...[and you] either have...or you don&#x27;t&quot;, others hold that chemistry is a process rather than a moment, &quot;build[ing] up and adds up and eventually you get this kind of chemical bonding&quot;. Some people, while believing it is possible to artificially create chemistry, think that it is better to let chemistry hit them spontaneously.

In Western society, chemistry is generally considered the &quot;igniter [and] catalyst for the relationship&quot;, i.e., without this chemistry, there can be no relationship. Having chemistry &quot;can be the difference between a relationship being romantic or platonic&quot;. Chemistry &quot;can cause people to act sexually impulsively or unwisely&quot;. It can also be the difference between someone remaining faithful in their relationship, and seeking one night stands and affairs.

Dating coach Evan Marc Katz suggests that &quot;chemistry is one of the most misleading indicators of a future relationship. Chemistry predicts nothing but chemistry.&quot; This is because chemistry can make people blind to actual incompatibilities or warning signs. Psychologist Laurie Betito notes that arranged marriages actually do quite well in terms of relationship satisfaction, and this is because &quot;a spark can build based on what you have in common. You can grow into love, but you grow &quot;out&quot; of lust.&quot; Neil Clark Warren argues that physical chemistry &quot;is&quot; important because &quot;couples who don&#x27;t share strong chemistry may have additional problems during the ups and downs of a life together.&quot; Like Betito, he suggests not ruling someone out on the first date due to lack of chemistry. &quot;But&quot;, he adds, &quot;if by the second or third date you don&#x27;t feel a strong inclination to kiss the other person, be near him, or hold his hand, you&#x27;re probably never going to feel it.&quot; Although this quote assumes the other person is male, the truth of the matter is that the other person may instead be female. April Masini likewise says that chemistry is a strong predictor of relationship success. She suggests that chemistry comes and goes, and it is important to actively cultivate it because it can help couples deal with future conflicts.

=== Complementarity theory===
The model of complementarity explains whether &quot;birds of a feather flock together&quot; or &quot;opposites attract.&quot;

Studies show that complementary interaction between two partners increases their attractiveness to each other. Complementary partners preferred closer interpersonal relationship. Couples who reported the highest level of loving and harmonious relationship were more dissimilar in dominance than couples who scored lower in relationship quality.

Mathes and Moore (1985) found that people were more attracted to peers approximating to their ideal self than to those who did not. Specifically, low self-esteem individuals appeared more likely to desire a complementary relationship than high self-esteem people. We are attracted to people who complement us because this allows us to maintain our preferred style of behavior, and interaction with someone who complements our own behavior likely confers a sense of self-validation and security.

====Similarity or complementarity====
Principles of similarity and complementarity seem to be contradictory on the surface. In fact, they agree on the dimension of warmth. Both principles state that friendly people would prefer friendly partners.

The importance of similarity and complementarity may depend on the stage of the relationship. Similarity seems to carry considerable weight in initial attraction, while complementarity assumes importance as the relationship develops over time. Markey (2007) found that people would be more satisfied with their relationship if their partners differed from them, at least in terms of dominance, as two dominant persons may experience conflicts while two submissive individuals may have frustration as neither take the initiative.

Perception and actual behavior might not be congruent with each other. There were cases that dominant people perceived their partners to be similarly dominant, yet to independent observers, the actual behavior of their partner was submissive, i.e. complementary to them. Why people perceive their romantic partners to be similar to them despite evidence of the contrary remains unclear.

===Evolutionary theories===
The evolutionary theory of human interpersonal attraction states that opposite-sex attraction most often occurs when someone has physical features indicating that he or she is very fertile. Considering that one primary purpose of conjugal/romantic relationships is reproduction, it would follow that people invest in partners who appear very fertile, increasing the chance of their genes being passed down to the next generation.

Evolutionary theory also suggests that people whose physical features suggest they are healthy are seen as more attractive. The theory suggests that a healthy mate is more likely to possess genetic traits related to health that would be passed on to offspring (known as indirect benefits), and also that a healthier mate may be able to provide better resources and parental investment than less healthy mates (known as direct benefits). People&#x27;s tendency to consider people with facial symmetry more attractive than those with less symmetrical faces is one example. However, a test was conducted that found that perfectly symmetrical faces were less attractive than normal faces. According to this study, the exact ratio of symmetric to asymmetric facial features depicting the highest attraction is still undetermined.

It has also been suggested that people are attracted to faces similar to their own as these features serve as cues of kinship. This preference for facial-resemblance is thought to vary across contexts. For example, a study by DeBruine et al. (2008) found that individuals rated faces which had been manipulated to be similar to their own as having more prosocial attributes, but were less likely to find them sexually attractive. These results support &quot;inclusive fitness theory&quot;, which predicts that organisms will help closely related kin over more distant relatives. Results further suggest inherent mate-selective mechanisms that consider costs of inbreeding to offspring health.

===Increased female attraction to men in relationships===
A 2009 study by Melissa Burkley and Jessica Parker found that 59% of women tested were interested in pursuing a relationship with an &quot;ideal&quot; single man (who was, unknown to the women, fictitious). When they believed the &quot;ideal&quot; man was already in a romantic relationship, 90% of the women were interested in a romantic relationship.

===Breaking up===

There are several reasons that a relationship, whether friendly or romantic, may come to an end (break up). One reason derives from the equity theory: if a person in the relationship feels that the personal costs of being in the relationship outweigh the rewards there is a strong chance that this person will end the relationship.

<text>A rokosz () originally was a gathering of all the Polish &quot;szlachta&quot; (nobility), not merely of deputies, for a &quot;sejm&quot;. The term was introduced to the Polish language from Hungary, where analogous gatherings took place at a field called Rákos. With time, &quot;rokosz&quot; came to signify an armed, semi-legal rebellion by the szlachta of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth against the king, in the name of defending threatened liberties. The nobles who gathered for a &quot;rokosz&quot; formed a &quot;confederation&quot;.

The institution of the rokosz, in the latter sense, derived from the medieval right to resist royal power. The rokosz took its authority from the right to refuse obedience to the king, as stipulated in the Privilege of Mielnik (&quot;przywilej mielnicki&quot;, signed October 23, 1501) and later in the Henrician Articles of 1573.

Two of the best-known rokoszes are the 17th-century Zebrzydowski Rebellion and the 16th-century Chicken War.

<text>A konfederacja (, confederation, confederacy) were &quot;ad hoc&quot; associations formed by the nobility (&quot;szlachta&quot;), clergy, and municipalities to pursue their stated aims or act in place of state authority, created in Poland and Lithuania between the 13th and 19th centuries. A &quot;konfederacja&quot; often took the form of an armed union aimed at redressing perceived abuses or trespasses by some authority, such as the royal authority. These &quot;confederations&quot; acted in place of state authority or to force their demands upon that authority.

They could be seen as a primary expression of direct democracy and the right of revolution in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, allowing nobles to act on their grievances and against the central authority. Its origins can be traced back to medieval resistance law (Latin: &quot;ius resistendi&quot;) against the ruler. A characteristic feature of the confederation was named membership; the list of its members was drawn up at the time of its formation. Since the formation occurred for the realisation of a predetermined goal, the confederation was temporary.

==History and function==
In the late 13th century, confederations of municipalities began to appear, aiming to support public safety and provide security from rampant banditry. The first confederation was formed in 1298 by several municipalities, including Poznań, Pyzdry, Gniezno, and Kalisz in Greater Poland.

Confederations composed solely of knights emerged in Poland during the second half of the 14th century, with the first such confederation being established in 1352. They were convened to defend the nobles&#x27; liberties against central authority, the influence of the clergy, and the development of Hussitism. In 1307, in response to the formation of a confederation of nobles opposing the clergy&#x27;s claims regarding tithes and jurisdiction, the clergy formed their own confederation.

In the years 1382 and 1384, inter-estate confederations (nobility and burghers) were convened in Radomsko to protect state security during the interregnum. During interregnums, confederations—essentially vigilance committees—were formed to replace the inactive royal court, protect internal order, and defend the state from external threats. The confederations, as a right of revolution, were recognized in Polish law through the Henrician articles (1573), part of the pacta conventa sworn by every Polish king since 1576. They stated (in the &quot;articulus de non praestanda oboedientia&quot;, a rule dating to 1501 from Privilege of Mielnik) that if the monarch did not recognize or abused the rights and privileges of the nobility (szlachta), the nobles would no longer be bound to obey him and would have the legal right to disobey him.

With the beginning of the 17th century, confederations became an increasingly significant element of the Commonwealth&#x27;s political scene. In the 17th and 18th centuries, confederations were organized by magnates, and were either pro- or anti-royal. A confederation not recognized by the king was considered a &quot;rokosz&quot; (&quot;rebellion&quot;), although some of the rokosz would be eventually recognized by the king, who could even join them himself. Most pro-royal confederations were usually formed as a response to an anti-royal one, and some would take the form of an extraordinary session of the parliament (sejm), as happened in 1710, 1717, and 1735.

Confederations were usually formed in one part of the country and could expand into &quot;general confederations&quot; taking in most or all of the voivodeships of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, even such general confederations would be formed separately for the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

Each confederation had a key document explaining its goals, known as the act of the confederation, which was deposited with the court (usually the local court for the region where the confederation was formed). Additional resolutions of the confederates, known as &quot;sanctia&quot;, would also be deposited with the court. Membership of the confederation was voluntary and required an oath. The executive branch of a confederation was headed by a marshal, and a group of advisers, each known as &quot;konsyliarz konfederacji&quot;. A marshal and associated konsyliarze were known as a generality (&quot;generalność&quot;). A confederation would also have a larger council, similar to a parliament (&quot;walna rada&quot;), which made decisions by majority vote. Until around the mid-18th century, resolutions of the council had to be unanimous, but afterward, majority voting became more common. The chief military commanders of confederations were known as regimentarze.

Also in the 18th century an institution known as a &quot;confederated sejm&quot; evolved. It was a parliament session (Sejm) that operated under the rules of a confederation. Its primary purpose was to avoid being subject to disruption by the &quot;liberum veto&quot;, unlike the national Sejm, which was paralyzed by the veto during this period. On some occasions, a confederated sejm was formed from the whole membership of the national Sejm, so that the &quot;liberum veto&quot; would not operate there.

Confederations were proscribed by law in 1717, but continued to operate, indicating a weakness of the Commonwealth&#x27;s central authority. They were also abolished by the Constitution of May 3, 1791 (adopted by the Four-Year Sejm of 1788–1792, itself a confederated sejm). But in practice this prohibition was not observed. The May 3rd Constitution was overthrown in mid-1792, by the Targowica Confederation of Polish magnates backed by Russian Empire and eventually joined, under extreme duress, by King Stanisław II August. The ensuing Russian military intervention led (to the Confederates&#x27; surprise) to the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. In 1812 the General Confederation of the Kingdom of Poland was formed in Warsaw to Napoleon I&#x27;s campaign against the Russian Empire.

<text>Confederated sejm () was a form of sejm in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 18th century. After 1764, sejms were frequently &quot;confederated&quot;. Under rules of confederation, decisions were made by the majority of deputy votes cast, and so the privilege of liberum veto did not apply.

Examples of confederated Sejms: Repnin Sejm, Great Sejm.

<doc id="1052176" wikidata="Q1053779" url="?curid=1052176" title="Euler system">
<text>In mathematics, an Euler system is a collection of compatible elements of Galois cohomology groups indexed by fields. They were introduced by in his work on Heegner points on modular elliptic curves, which was motivated by his earlier paper and the work of . Euler systems are named after Leonhard Euler because the factors relating different elements of an Euler system resemble the Euler factors of an Euler product.

Euler systems can be used to construct annihilators of ideal class groups or Selmer groups, thus giving bounds on their orders, which in turn has led to deep theorems such as the finiteness of some Tate-Shafarevich groups. This led to Karl Rubin&#x27;s new proof of the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory, considered simpler than the original proof due to Barry Mazur and Andrew Wiles.

==Definition==
Although there are several definitions of special sorts of Euler system, there seems to be no published definition of an Euler system that covers all known cases. But it is possible to say roughly what an Euler system is, as follows: 
*An Euler system is given by collection of elements &quot;c&quot;&quot;F&quot;. These elements are often indexed by certain number fields &quot;F&quot; containing some fixed number field &quot;K&quot;, or by something closely related such as square-free integers. The elements &quot;c&quot;&quot;F&quot; are typically elements of some Galois cohomology group such as H1(&quot;F&quot;, &quot;T&quot;) where &quot;T&quot; is a &quot;p&quot;-adic representation of the absolute Galois group of &quot;K&quot;.
*The most important condition is that the elements &quot;c&quot;&quot;F&quot; and &quot;c&quot;&quot;G&quot; for two different fields &quot;F&quot; ⊆ &quot;G&quot; are related by a simple formula, such as
:formula_1
:Here the &quot;Euler factor&quot; &quot;P&quot;(τ|&quot;B&quot;;&quot;x&quot;) is defined to be the element det(1-τ&quot;x&quot;|&quot;B&quot;) considered as an element of O[&quot;x&quot;], which when &quot;x&quot; happens to act on &quot;B&quot; is not the same as det(1-τ&quot;x&quot;|&quot;B&quot;) considered as an element of O.
*There may be other conditions that the &quot;c&quot;&quot;F&quot; have to satisfy, such as congruence conditions.

Kazuya Kato refers to the elements in an Euler system as &quot;arithmetic incarnations of zeta&quot; and describes the property of being an Euler system as &quot;an arithmetic reflection of the fact that these incarnations are related to special values of Euler products&quot;.

==Examples==

===Cyclotomic units===
For every square-free positive integer &quot;n&quot; pick an &quot;n&quot;-th root ζ&quot;n&quot; of 1, with ζ&quot;mn&quot; = ζ&quot;m&quot;ζ&quot;n&quot; for &quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot; coprime. Then the cyclotomic Euler system is the set of numbers 
α&quot;n&quot; = 1 − ζ&quot;n&quot;. These satisfy the relations
:formula_2
:formula_3 modulo all primes above &quot;l&quot;
where &quot;l&quot; is a prime not dividing &quot;n&quot; and &quot;F&quot;&quot;l&quot; is a Frobenius automorphism with &quot;F&quot;&quot;l&quot;(ζ&quot;n&quot;) = ζ.
Kolyvagin used this Euler system to give an elementary proof of the Gras conjecture.

===Gauss sums===

===Elliptic units===

===Heegner points===
Kolyvagin constructed an Euler system from the Heegner points of an elliptic curve, and used this to show that in some cases the Tate-Shafarevich group is finite.

===Kato&#x27;s Euler system===
Kato&#x27;s Euler system consists of certain elements occurring in the algebraic K-theory of modular curves. These elements—named Beilinson elements after Alexander Beilinson who introduced them in —were used by Kazuya Kato in to prove one divisibility in Barry Mazur&#x27;s main conjecture of Iwasawa theory for elliptic curves.

<text>Janette Howard (née Parker; born 11 August 1944) is the wife of John Howard, who was the Prime Minister of Australia from 11 March 1996 to 3 December 2007 and the second-longest-serving Australian Prime Minister.

==Early life, education, and personal life==

Alison Janette Parker was born in the suburb of Kingsford, Sydney, in 1944. Her father was an engineer with the New South Wales Government Railways. The family later moved to Vaucluse. She was educated at Sydney Girls High School and trained as a teacher, graduating from the University of New South Wales with a Bachelor of Arts.

She joined the Liberal Party and met John Howard at a Liberal Party function. They were married on 4 April 1971, at St Peter&#x27;s Anglican Church in Watsons Bay.

The Howards have three children, Melanie (born 1974, married Rowan McDonald in 2003), Timothy (married Sarah Mackintosh in 2010) and Richard (married Ellen Dadanina in 2017); as well as five grandchildren, Angus (born 2007), Alexander (born 2012), and Ariah (born 2015), Winston (born 2018) and Henry (born 2020).

Janette Howard adopted a relatively low profile during her husband&#x27;s tenure as prime minister; however, in 1999, a journalist alleged that she had intervened with the Prime Minister concerning an appointment to the board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Janette issued a rare public statement denying the allegation as &quot;not only wrong but deeply offensive to me&quot;.

In 1996, Janette Howard was diagnosed with cervical cancer and underwent surgery; the type of cancer was not revealed to the public until 2006. John Howard said at the time that he would leave politics immediately if it seemed necessary in the interests of his wife&#x27;s health. Since then, Janette has been active in advocating early screening for breast cancer for Australian women.

Janette Howard&#x27;s public duties included accompanying the Prime Minister on official tours and carrying out the duties of official host at the Prime Minister&#x27;s official residences, The Lodge in Canberra and Kirribilli House in Sydney. She is also a patron of the National Portrait Gallery.

==Political views==
Janette Howard was always seen at the Prime Minister&#x27;s side during election campaigns. According to John Howard&#x27;s biographer Pru Goward, Janette &quot;lives and breathes&quot; politics. She also devoted time to &quot;nursing&quot; John Howard&#x27;s electorate of Bennelong, which, although a Liberal seat since its creation in 1949, gradually became less Liberal and culminated in the defeat of John Howard at the 2007 election by the Labor Party&#x27;s Maxine McKew (the seat returned to Liberal hands at the 2010 election when McKew was defeated by John Alexander).

Although she rarely made any public comment on political issues, she did break this pattern by deciding to speak out against Kevin Rudd during the 2007 election campaign.

<doc id="1052183" wikidata="Q85430164" url="?curid=1052183" title="Creole cuisine">
<text>Creole cuisine (; ; ) is a cuisine style born in colonial times, from the fusion between African, European and pre-Columbian traditions. &quot;Creole&quot; is a term that refers to those of European origin who were born in the New World and have adapted to it (melting pot). According to Norwegian anthropologist Thomas Hylland Eriksen, &quot;a Creole society (...) is based wholly or partly on the mass displacement of people who were, often involuntarily, uprooted from their original home, shedding the main features of their social and political organisations on the way, brought into sustained contact with people from other linguistic and cultural areas and obliged to develop, in creative and improvisational ways, new social and cultural forms in the new land, drawing simultaneously on traditions from their respective places of origin and on impulses resulting from the encounter.&quot;

Creole cuisine is found in different regions of the world that were previously European colonies. Creole food can be found in Louisiana (USA), Cuba, Brazil, Peru, the French Antilles, French Guiana, La Reunion (France), Jamaica, Annobón (Equatorial Guinea), Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cape Verde, Dominican Republic, etc. In each region, Creole cuisine has been adapting to local products (so there is no &quot;single&quot; Creole cuisine), however, they share certain features in common:

* Association of very different products on the same dish (compared to traditional European cuisine).
* Very spicy flavors, mixtures of sweet and salty, and pungent preparations.
* Relatively simple common culinary techniques, such as frying or stewing meat (called &quot;ragout&quot;). &quot;Adobos&quot; (marinades) are also common. Grilled dishes rarely exist.

In Hispanic America, many Creole dishes are named with the ending , such as or or simply with the adjective , as in vinagre criollo (&quot;Creole vinegar&quot;) or chorizo criollo. Also in French, the terms or just are used, such as in .

== Terminology ==
&quot;Creole&quot; comes from the Portuguese , from the verb &#x27;to raise.&#x27; In French, the term is . The word can refer to many things, but all of these things are the product of the mixing of three continents: the creole languages are a mix between a European language, a Native American language, and the languages brought by enslaved Africans. The term can also refer to the Criollo horse, creole music, the creole circus, or to the popular Cuban dance called the &quot;creole.&quot;

A creole person can be a black person descended from African slaves or a creole person can be descended from European slave owners born in the Europeans&#x27; American colonies. By extension, the term can refer to any person native to a Latin American country.

* Brazilian Creole cuisine 
* Guianan Creole cuisine
* Louisiana Creole cuisine
* La Réunion Creole cuisine
* Mauritius Creole cuisine
* Caribbean Creole cuisine
* Mexican Creole cuisine
* Peruvian Creole cuisine

=== Creole cuisine in Brazil ===
In Brazilian cuisine, people speak of to refer, in particular, to the notable influence that African cuisine (and, in a broader sense, the whole of African culture) had on colonial Brazilian society. African slaves&#x27; cuisine adapted to local ingredients, such as (cassava) or (corn), although they also imported ingredients from the other side of the Atlantic, such as (palm oil), (couscous), the coconut, or coffee. In terms of dishes, one that has its origins in African slaves&#x27; cuisine is , which is today considered to be the national dish of Brazil.

Brazilian creole cuisine is related to candomblé, an Afro-American religion with its origins in the Yoruba religion, just like Cuban Santeria. In this religion, &quot;food plays a fundamental role, since it is considered to be a link between men and the Orishas.&quot; Dishes representative of candomblé are , , or .

=== Creole cuisine in Louisiana ===

Creole cuisine in Louisiana is influenced by African, Caribbean, French, Spanish, and American cuisines. While it shares many traits with Cajun gastronomy (both originated in Louisiana), the two differ in terms of their origins. Louisiana Creole cuisine was developed by creoles from Louisiana—in other words, Spaniards and French born in Louisiana—while Cajun cuisine originated from Cajuns or Acadians (originating from the Acadiana region) and with great influence from Creole Cuisine.

=== Creole cuisine in Réunion ===

Réunion is an island that was populated principally by French, Africans, Indians, and Chinese. This small island in the Mascarene archipelago can be found in the Indian Ocean near Madagascar and the African continent, and has long been a French territory. Reunionese cuisine is also considered to be creole, since much of its culinary tradition comes from France (such as &quot;bonbons&quot; or &quot;civet&quot;), but the ingredients used are local (from Asia and Africa) and are considered to be exotic in metropolitan France.

=== Mauritian Creole cuisine === 
The creole cuisine is eaten by every Mauritian and has its influences from African, Indian, and French cuisine. Mauritian Creole dishes typically involves the consumption of seafood, fresh vegetables, pulses, beans, and corn.

=== Creole cuisine in Hispanic America ===
Hispanic American creole cuisine fuses Spanish and indigenous elements from Spanish-speaking areas. It is prepared with key local ingredients such as potato, tomato, or corn, planted and harvested in their place of origin. Creole influence is clear in the case of Cuban, Puerto Rican, Dominican, Central American, Colombian, Ecuadorian, Venezuelan, Peruvian, Mexican, and Bolivian creole cuisine.

==== Cuba ====
Cuban creole cuisine is typically centered around beans, pork, and rice as the main ingredients. In the 1850s, the emergence of Cuban cookbooks on the island began to highlight a distinct &quot;Cuban&quot; or &quot;creole&quot; cuisine. In addition to making use of foreign ingredients, Cuban creole cuisine also made regular use of produce endemic to the island of Cuba, especially , which are a category of carbohydrate-rich produce that include sweet potatoes, cassava, and green plantains. Interestingly, besides their seeming ubiquity in Cuban creole cuisine, &quot;viandas&quot; are also known for their medicinal qualities, commonly being used to ease upset stomachs.

==== Mexico ====
In Mexico, the term &quot;creole&quot; differs slightly, since it refers to agricultural products native to Mexico that are considered to be vegetable relics, meaning, fruits or vegetables that are cultivated on a local scale (typical to a particular region), following the ancient techniques that pre-Columbian societies used, without variations in the cultivar (their size, color, and flavor are all the same). Examples of this include creole corn, cacao, and chili, which are the &quot;purest&quot; of their cultivar types.

&quot;Creole&quot; can also refer to an imported fruit or vegetable that, after adapting to the local climate, has taken on a new form entirely. One example of this is the creole peach, which is smaller in size and is sweeter, yellower, and harder than the original peach. Or, in rarer cases, the term can refer to hybrid varieties.

==== Peru ====
A creole cuisine has also developed along the coast of Peru, with Spanish, African, Italian, and Chinese influences. One of the signature dishes of Peruvian creole cuisine is ceviche, which is prepared with fresh fish that has been cured in lemon juice. Other dishes are &quot;ají de gallina&quot;, &quot;carapulca&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

<text>Catherine Barton (1679–1739) was an English woman who oversaw the running of the household of her uncle, scientist Isaac Newton. She was reputed to be the source of the story of the apple inspiring Newton&#x27;s work on gravity, and his papers came to her on his death. She was rumoured to have been the mistress of the poet and statesman Charles Montagu and later married politician John Conduitt.

==Early life==
Barton was the second daughter of Robert Barton (1630–1693) and his second wife, Hannah Smith (1652–1695), half-sister of Isaac Newton. She was baptized at Brigstock, Northampton on 25 November 1679.

== Barton&#x27;s social circle ==
Barton was remarked upon by several men to be beautiful, witty and clever. She was known as a brilliant conversationalist, and attracted the admiration of such famous figures as Jonathan Swift and Voltaire.

Her uncle was also fond of her; an excerpt of an uncharacteristically warm letter from Newton survives, regarding her contraction of smallpox: &quot;Pray let me know by your next how your face is and if your fevour be going. Perhaps warm milk from ye Cow may help to abate it. I am Your loving Unkle, Is. Newton.&quot; Sometime after her uncle Newton moved to London to become Warden of the Mint in April 1696 she moved there to live with him. Barton was said to have been the source of the story about Newton and the apple, as she told the story to Voltaire who later wrote about it in his &quot;Essay on Epic Poetry&quot; of 1727. 

Voltaire also insinuated that Newton&#x27;s preferment to the Royal Mint was the result of Barton&#x27;s alleged affair with Charles Montagu. However, although it is true that Isaac was appointed under the patronage of Charles Montagu, the claim that this was due to Barton&#x27;s influence is dubious: Catherine Barton came up to London and met Montagu after the appointment, not before.

==Relationship to Charles Montagu==
Barton became the housekeeper to Charles Montagu following the death of his wife in 1698. There was much contemporary gossip about their relationship being sexual, and thinly disguised accusations appeared in print. Delariviere Manley&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot; of 1710 featured a character called Bartica who was widely taken to represent Barton. 

Montagu, by then Earl of Halifax, died of an inflammation of the lungs in May 1715. His will contained two codicils: the first dated 12 April 1706, left the sum of £3000 and all his jewels to Barton; a second dated 1 February 1713 left her an additional £5000 plus his interest in the rangership of Bushey Park and his manor of Apscourt in Surrey to pay for the repairs to Bushey Lodge. On 30 August, however, he revoked the first codicil and begged his executor, his nephew George Montagu, not to make a dispute over her legacies. Montagu wrote that these bequests were &quot;as a token of the sincere love, affection and esteem, I have long had for her person, and as a small recompense for the pleasure and happiness I have had in her conversation&quot;. 

Halifax&#x27;s official life defended Barton against accusations that she might have been sexually involved with him, stating:as this Lady was young, beautiful and gay, so those that were given to censure, pass&#x27;d a Judgment upon her which she no Ways merited, since she was a Woman of strict Honour and Virtue; and tho&#x27; she might be agreeable to his Lordship in every Particular, that noble Peer&#x27;s Complaisance to her, proceeded wholly from the great Esteem he had for her Wit and most exquisite Understanding.Based on the generosity of the bequest, astronomer John Flamsteed wrote, apparently sarcastically and spitefully, that Barton must have &quot;excellent conversation&quot;.

==Marriage==
Barton then returned to live with her uncle at his home in St Martin&#x27;s Street. On 9 July 1717 she became engaged to marry John Conduitt who had arrived in England a few weeks earlier in May of that year. On 23 August they were issued a licence to marry at St Paul&#x27;s Covent Garden, but actually married three days later at St Martin in the Fields. Barton had one daughter with Conduitt, Catherine, who was born in 1721.

==Later life==
Barton lived with Conduitt at Cranbury Park, near Winchester. She took in Newton towards the end of his life, and he resided with her until his death in 1727. After Newton&#x27;s death, his papers were in Barton&#x27;s care and then passed down through her family until 1936 when they were auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s.

Conduitt died on 23 May 1737; Catherine died in 1739 and was buried with her uncle and husband in Westminster Abbey. Their only daughter and heir, Catherine, married John Wallop, Viscount Lymington, the eldest son of the first Earl of Portsmouth, and their son, John Wallop, succeeded as second Earl of Portsmouth.

==In fiction==
A fictional Barton has a small role in Neal Stephenson&#x27;s novel &quot;The System of the World&quot;, the final installment in Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Baroque Cycle&quot;.

She also has a role in Philip Kerr&#x27;s novel &quot;Dark Matter: The Private Life of Sir Isaac Newton&quot;.

<doc id="1052194" wikidata="Q2514555" url="?curid=1052194" title="Lota (vessel)">
<text>A lota (; ; ) is a small, spouted, and rounded jug that has been used in India since the 2nd millennium BCE or earlier. Normally there is no handle. The design itself serves multiple purposes; a copper lota is commonly used in Indian religious ceremonies, such as &quot;yajna&quot; during &quot;puja&quot;, for wedding rituals, and other sacred traditions. It is also used for serving water and liquor. According to the ancient Indian/Hindu-origin traditional medicine system of &quot;ayurveda&quot;, drinking water stored in the copper lota has health and nutritional benefits.

The vessel&#x27;s regional variations include the bodna () in Bengal, the kindi in Kerala, and the Karuwa in Nepal.

==History==
The earliest known examples of &quot;lota&quot; and &quot;kindi&quot; in ancient India are from the Chalcolithic period, notably in the Savalda Culture and two well-preserved examples from the pottery of the Jorwe Culture, dating back to the 2nd millennium BCE. Highly decorative spouted vases with floral motifs are also known from Chandraketugarh, dating back to around the 2nd century BC or the 1st century CE. The earliest lotas were made of clay or teracotta while modern versions are notably metal.

==Design==
===Regional variations===
In West Bengal and parts of Bangladesh, the term &quot;bôdnā&quot; () describes spouted (teapot-like) vessels, and the vessels used for puja are called &quot;ghôt&quot; or &quot;ghôti&quot;, while &quot;lotā&quot; is used for cleansing mugs. In Odisha, vessels without the spout is also known as lota, while spout vessel is known as &quot;Jeri&quot;, used for prayer rituals and serving liquor. They are also known as &quot;Karwa&quot;, &quot;Jharis&quot; and &quot;Achaman Jharis&quot; (utensils with spouts) in Hindi Belt and Gujarat in northern and western India, used for prayer rituals. It is also known as &quot;Mooku sombu&quot; and &quot;Pal Kindi&quot; used as milk feeder for babies in southern parts of India. In Nepal, it is known as Karuwa which is used for religious rituals, serving water and liquor.

=== Reception ===
American designers Charles and Ray Eames in their &quot;The India Report&quot; expressed a great admiration for the lota, saying about its design, &quot;Of all the objects we have seen and admired during our visit to India, the Lota, that simple vessel of everyday use, stands out as perhaps the greatest, the most beautiful.&quot;

==Usage==
===Idioms and literature===
In some parts of the Indian subcontinent, the use of the phrase &quot;bependi ka lota&quot; (a &quot;lota without a base&quot;) is colloquially used to refer to a person who may switch their loyalties. This comes from the observation that a spherical lota without a base tends to roll over in unpredictable directions when kept on uneven ground. The neologism &quot;&quot; was coined in Pakistan to describe politicians who switch parties for their convenience.

===&quot;Ayurveda&quot;===
According to the ancient Indian/Hindu-origin traditional medicine system of &quot;ayurveda&quot;, drinking water stored in the copper lota has health and nutritional benefits. It is used for &quot;jala neti&quot;, a traditional ayurvedic and yogic practice that is used for cleansing the nose and sinus passages through nasal irrigation.

===Sacred ceremonies===
In the Indian-origin religions, the lota is a multi-purpose utensil. It is also used in the sacred rituals, such as &quot;yajna&quot;, &quot;puja&quot;, for wedding rituals, and other sacred ceremonies.

===Cleansing===
Throughout the Indian subcontinent, the lota is commonly used to assist with hygiene, such as during baths or anal cleansing.

In Bengali, the term &quot;lotā&quot; is used for bath mugs.

<doc id="1052198" wikidata="Q4162509" url="?curid=1052198" title="Joseph M. Reeves">
<text>Joseph Mason &quot;Bull&quot; Reeves (20 November 1872 – 25 March 1948) was an admiral in the United States Navy and an early and important supporter of U.S. Naval Aviation. Though a battleship officer during his early career, he became known as the &quot;Father of Carrier Aviation&quot; for his role in integrating aircraft carriers into the fleet as a major part of the Navy&#x27;s attack capabilities.

Reeves retired in the mid-1930s but was recalled to active duty during World War II to serve in high-level staff positions within the Office of the Secretary of the Navy. He retired again in December 1946 with the rank of full admiral.

==Early life and career==
Joseph Mason Reeves was born on 20 November 1872, in the village of Tampico, Illinois.

He received an appointment in 1890 to attend the United States Naval Academy, where he became a football hero. In addition to his on-field heroics, he is credited with the invention of the modern football helmet, which he had a shoemaker create for him after being told by a Navy doctor that another kick to his head could result in &quot;instant insanity&quot; or death. Reeves graduated from the academy in 1894.

Upon graduation, Reeves was assigned to the cruiser . He served on the battleship during the Spanish–American War, taking part in the action against Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete&#x27;s fleet at Santiago de Cuba in June and July 1898.

==Start of the 20th century Through World War I==
After the start of the 20th century, Reeves served in San Francisco and on the battleships and in addition to tours ashore at Newport and Annapolis, where he was an instructor in the Naval Academy&#x27;s Department of Physics and Chemistry, 1906–08. He served as the academy&#x27;s head football coach in 1907, guiding the team to a 9–2–1 record and a 6–0 victory over Army.

Following duties as ordnance officer on board the battleship , Reeves served as ordnance officer in the staff of the Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. He followed this with assignment to the Board of Inspection and Survey and a tour as Commanding Officer, Naval Coal Depot, Tiburon, California.

In April 1913, Commander Reeves assumed command of the collier , the Navy&#x27;s first electrically propelled vessel. The ship was rebuilt and recommissioned in 1922 as , the Navy&#x27;s first aircraft carrier.

Detached from &quot;Jupiter&quot; in April 1914, he commanded the cruiser and various other ships until assigned to the battleship in June 1915 as Commanding Officer.

Detached for shore duty at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in California in June 1916, he then commanded the battleship during World War I, earning the Navy Cross for &quot;exceptionally meritorious service&quot; during that tour.

==Post–World War I Assignments==
After the war he served as Naval Attaché at Rome and in April 1921 assumed command of the cruiser . Captain of the Mare Island Navy Yard at the end of that year, he afterwards commanded the battleship in 1922–23, then attended the Naval War College at Newport. After completing his coursework, he spent a year as a member of the staff.

==Entering Naval Aviation==

Upon completing his tour at the War College, Captain Reeves decided to enter the new world of naval aviation. In order to hold a command post, however, he needed to receive aviation training. Like other older officers—notably, RADM William A. Moffett, Chief of the Navy&#x27;s new Bureau of Aeronautics—Reeves qualified as a &quot;Naval Aviation Observer&quot; rather than as a &quot;Naval Aviator&quot; (i.e., a pilot). He received his qualification in 1925 and assumed the post of Commander, Aircraft Squadron, Battle Fleet. Though a captain by rank, his position as squadron commander permitted him to fly a commodore&#x27;s pennant. His flagship was the experimental carrier USS &quot;Langley&quot;—his old ship, &quot;Jupiter&quot;, modified for aviation operations. The wooden flight-deck was installed over the &quot;Langley&#x27;s&quot; existing deck structures, giving the vessel the nickname of &quot;Covered Wagon.&quot;

While in this command, Reeves worked hard to develop carrier aviation tactics, seeking to increase sortie rates and the use of dive-bombing. He proved these concepts by the success of his pilots and aircrew during the Navy&#x27;s annual fleet exercises (known as &quot;Fleet Problems&quot;).

Reeves served on the Navy&#x27;s General Board, June 1929–June 1930. Fifteen months later he became Senior Member of the Board of Inspection and Survey, Pacific Coast Section. Another tour at Mare Island followed and in June 1933 he became Commander, Battleships, Battle Force, with the rank of vice admiral. In July, he was assigned as Commander, Battle Force, U.S. Fleet, with the rank of admiral.

On 26 February 1934, Admiral Reeves was designated Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Fleet. He held this command until June 1936, when he was ordered to Washington, D.C., to serve on the General Board. He held the Board position until 23 November 1936, and retired seven days later.

==Recall during World War II==

The admiral&#x27;s retirement was short-lived, as his nation again needed his services to fight another World War. Reeves was recalled to active duty on May 13, 1940, advanced to vice admiral on the retired list, and was attached to the Office of the Secretary of the Navy. Reeves served simultaneously as Lend-Lease Liaison Officer from March 1941 to December 1945, Senior Military Member of the Munitions Assignments Board and Chairman of the Munitions Assignment Committee (Navy) from 13 February 1942 to 8 November 1945, and Chairman of the Joint Munitions Allocation Committee from 11 January 1944 to 2 September 1945.

In diplomatic relations with the senior military representatives of the United Nations, Admiral Reeves displayed unusual qualities of leadership and rendered invaluable service in carrying out his duties. His skill and initiative in bringing about the harmonious distribution of finished materials to meet the demands of all United Nations Services, were essential to the integration of the Allied military organization, and his brilliant analyses of the overall situation were substantial factors in executing logistic plans in accordance with strategic requirements.

Reeves retired from the Navy as an Admiral in June 1947 and received the Distinguished Service Medal and Legion of Merit for his service. He spent his last years living in Maryland and died at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, on 25 March 1948.

Together with his wife Eleanor Watkins Reeves, Reeves had three children.

==In popular culture==

Reeves was portrayed by Jack Holt in Task Force (film).

==Legacy==
A warship and two airfields have been named in honor of Admiral Reeves.
* The guided missile frigate USS &quot;Reeves&quot; (DLG/CG-24) was commissioned 15 May 1964 and won three battle stars for Vietnam service. The &quot;Reeves&quot; was reclassified on 30 June 1975 as a guided missile cruiser (CG-24). &quot;Reeves&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Navy Register on 12 November 1993 at Pearl Harbor. She was sunk at sea 31 May 2001 off the coast of Australia.
* Joseph Mason Reeves Field (&quot;Reeves Field&quot;) at NAS Lemoore, California, was dedicated 20 November 1961.
* NAS Reeves Field San Pedro in California (later NAS Terminal Island), was dedicated during the 1930s. This airfield is no longer active.

<doc id="1052199" wikidata="Q7517805" url="?curid=1052199" title="Similarity (psychology)">
<text>Similarity refers to the psychological degree of identity of two mental representations. It is fundamental to human cognition since it provides the basis for categorization of entities into kinds and for various other cognitive processes. It underpins our ability to interact with unknown entities by predicting how they will behave based on their similarity to entities we are familiar with. Research in cognitive psychology has taken a number of approaches to the concept of similarity. Each of them is related to a particular set of assumptions about knowledge representation.

==Cognitive psychological approaches==
===Mental distance approaches===
Mental distance approaches assume that mental representations can be conceptualized as some kind of mental space. Concepts are represented as points within the space. Similarity between concepts is a function of the distance between the concepts in space. Concepts represented by points that are near to each other are more psychologically similar than are points that are conceptually distant. A strength of this approach is there are many mathematical techniques for deriving spaces from data such as multidimensional scaling and latent semantic analysis .

===Featural approaches===
Featural approaches were developed to address limitations of the mental distance approaches. For example, spaces are symmetric. The distance between two points is the same regardless of which point you start from. However, psychological similarity is not symmetric. For example, we often prefer to state similarity in one direction. For example, it feels more natural to say that 101 is like 100 than to say that 100 is like 101. Furthermore, many metaphors are also directional. Saying &quot;That surgeon is a butcher&quot; means something quite different from saying &quot;That butcher is a surgeon.&quot;

Featural approaches assumed that people represent concepts by lists of features that describe properties of the items. A similarity comparison involves comparing the feature lists that represent the concepts. Features that are shared in the feature lists are &quot;commonalities&quot; of the pair and features that are contained in one feature set but not the other are &quot;differences&quot; of the pair. It is possible to account for people&#x27;s intuitions or ratings of the similarities between concepts by assuming that judgments of similarity increase with the number of commonalities (weighted by the salience of those commonalities) and decreases with the number of differences (weighted by the salience of the differences).

===Structural approaches===
Structural approaches to similarity were developed to address limitations of the featural account. In particular, featural approaches assume that the commonalities and differences are independent of each other. However, commonalities and differences are not psychologically independent. In fact, determining the differences between a pair requires finding the commonalities. Consider the comparison between a car and a motorcycle. Both have wheels. That is a commonality. However, cars have four wheels, while motorcycles have two wheels. That is a difference. Because this difference required first finding a commonality between the pair, it is called an &quot;alignable difference&quot;. Alignable differences contrast with &quot;nonalignable differences&quot; which are aspects of one concept that have no correspondence in the other. For example, cars have seatbelts and motorcycles do not. Research suggests that alignable differences have a larger impact on people&#x27;s judgments of similarity than do nonalignable differences. Thus, the relationship between the commonalities of a pair and the differences is important for understanding people&#x27;s assessments of similarity. Structural approaches to similarity emerged from research on analogy.

===Transformational approaches===

Transformational accounts of similarity were developed to evaluate similarity independently of the type of mental representation. On this view, any mental representation can be transformed into another mental representation through some series of steps. For any representation system and set of transformations, it is possible to define the shortest set of steps (i.e., the shortest program) that will transform one representation into another. The shorter this minimal program, the more similarity the pair of concepts. found some evidence against this view, showing that the number of steps to transform the colors and shapes of geometric objects does not predict people&#x27;s similarity judgments for those objects.

==Social psychological approaches==
In social psychology large amounts of empirical evidence indicate that similarity breeds liking; this is known as the similarity effect. Similarity refers to personality, attitudes, values, interests, and attraction shared between to individuals. Similarity is closely related to Bryne&#x27;s social psychology model of interpersonal attraction (1961) which is determined by four variables: propinquity (how our environment and situation play a role in determining how often and to what degree we come in contact), need for affiliation, overt stimulus characteristics (refers to the observable attributes of an individual that serve to elicit positive or negative responses from others), and similarity. In short we determine our attraction or liking of another by positive and negative reinforcements and our emotions concerning the matter. When Individual A receives positive reinforcement from individual B, A&#x27;s attraction toward B, increases the reverse is also true. Attitude similarity has also been found to serve as a strong foundation for long lasting friendship. Friends who share a similar interest in activities where more likely to perceive similarity and liking then those who shared similar attitudes. An individual&#x27;s perceived similarity with another has been proven to show potential for romantic relationships even though actual similarity was reported to be low. These findings explain that individuals are more likely to be attracted to those who they perceive to share similar activities with such as occupation and hobbies. Propinquity also explains the relationship between liking and activities, those with similar interests tend to put themselves into similar types of settings increasing their chances of interaction. As frequency of interaction between 2 or more people increases, the degree of perceived similarity and liking for one another increases eventually leading to long lasting relationships.

Several explanations have been offered to explain in what way similarity increases interpersonal attraction (like-prefers-like). First, people with similar interests tend to put themselves into similar types of settings. For example, two people interested in literature are likely to run into each other in the library and form a relationship (involving the propinquity effect). Another explanation is that we notice similar people, and expect a relationship to be interpersonally validating and beneficial because of similar attitudes, behaviours and values. People are susceptible to making negative judgements about those who are &#x27;out of group&#x27; than &#x27;in group&#x27; from them socially, behaviorally or of different morals and values. Specifically, the &#x27;Big Five&#x27; personality trait dimensions (extroversion and introversion, agreeableness and disagreeableness, openness and closeness, conscientiousness and apathetic, as well as mental stability and neuroticism) are behavioural traits often used to assess similarity or dissimilarity in relationships.

<text>Hålogaland was the northernmost of the Norwegian provinces in the medieval Norse sagas. In the early Viking Age, before Harald Fairhair, Hålogaland was a kingdom extending between the Namdalen valley in Trøndelag county and the Lyngen fjord in Troms county.

==Etymology and history==
Ancient Norwegians said that was named after a royal named Hǫlgi. The Norse form of the name was &#x27;. The first element of the word is the genitive plural of &#x27;, a &#x27;person from Hålogaland&#x27;. The last element is &#x27;, as in &#x27;land&#x27; or &#x27;region&#x27;. The meaning of the demonym &#x27; is unknown. Thorstein Vikingson&#x27;s Saga, 1, describes it as a compound of Hial, &quot;Hel&quot; or &quot;spirit,&quot; and &quot;loge&quot;, &quot;fire&quot; – although this is largely discredited.

The Gothic historian Jordanes in his work &#x27; (also known as &quot;Getica&quot;), written in Constantinople , mentions a people &quot;Adogit&quot; living in the far North. This could be an old form of &#x27; and a possible reference to the petty kingdom of Hålogaland. Alex Woolf links the name Hålogaland to the — the &quot;Northern Lights&quot; —, saying that Hålogaland meant the &quot;Land of the High Fire&quot;, &#x27; deriving from &#x27;, which refers to fire. This is also discredited.

A legendary interpretation is found in the medieval accounts of Ynglingatal and Skáldskaparmál; &quot;Logi&quot; is described as the personification of fire, a fire giant, and as a &quot;son of Fornjót&quot;. In the medieval Orkneyinga saga and the account of &#x27; (&#x27;How Norway was inhabited&#x27;), Fornjót is described as king of &quot;, and &quot;. The royal lineages of his children are discussed in these and other medieval accounts. The beginning of the &#x27; (&quot;Saga of Thorstein son of Víking&quot;) discusses King Logi, who ruled the country north of Norway. Because Logi was larger and stronger than any other man in land, his name was lengthened from &quot;Logi&quot; to &#x27;, meaning &quot;High-Logi&quot;. Derived from that name his country became called &#x27;, meaning &quot;Hálogi&#x27;s land&quot;. The spelling of the name changed to modern-day Hålogaland. Another interpretation of the name is presented by Halvdan Koht and Alfred Jacobsen (in Håløyminne 1, 1920): &#x27;Háleygr&#x27; is derived from Proto-Scandinavian *HaÞulaikaR, with the elements *haÞu &#x27;battle&#x27; and *laik- &#x27;pledge&#x27;, i.e., a wartime alliance of the many settlements in times of conflict.

The &quot;Hversu Noregr byggðist&quot; is a legendary account of the origin of various legendary Norwegian lineages. It traces the descendants of the primeval ruler Fornjót (Fornjotr) down to Nór, who unites the Norwegian lands. The Hversu account then gives details of the descendants of Nór and of his brother Gór in the following section known as the &#x27; (&quot;Genealogies&quot;, or &#x27;, &quot;Founding of Norway&quot;). The &quot;Hversu&quot; account is closely paralleled by the opening of the Orkneyinga saga.

In 873 AD, according to the Egil&#x27;s saga (written ) the Kvens and Norse cooperate in battling against the invading Karelians. The chapter XVII of Egil&#x27;s saga describes how Thorolf Kveldulfsson (King of Norway&#x27;s tax chief starting 872 AD) from Namdalen, located in the southernmost tip of the historic Hålogaland, goes to Kvenland again:

Based on medieval documents, the above meeting took place during the winter of 873–874. Hålogaland&#x27;s rather close vicinity to Kvenland is also demonstrated in the geographical chronicle &quot;&quot; by the Icelandic Abbot Níkulás Bergsson (Nikolaos), who provides descriptions of lands around Norway:

As recorded in &quot;Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar&quot;, King Hákon Hákonarson settled some of the people of Bjarmaland in the area surrounding the Malangen fjord near modern Tromsø in the 1230s or 1240s. According to Saxo Grammaticus in his &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, King Helgi of Hålogaland married a Princess Thora of Lappland and Bjarmaland, daughter of Prince Gusi, but in other sources he is only given as King of Lappland. In any event, for centuries the Norwegians of Hålogaland had extensive relations with both the Bjarmar and Saami, and to some extent also the Kvens.

===Modern usage===
In modern times, the term Hålogaland is used in a variety of senses. For some purposes, all of Northern Norway, Svalbard and Jan Mayen are covered under the term Hålogaland. For other purposes the counties of Nordland and Troms constitute Hålogaland. Hålogaland or even Mid Hålogaland are frequent terms covering the smaller districts of Ofoten, Lofoten and Vesterålen, as well as the municipalities of Gratangen, Harstad, Ibestad, Kvæfjord, and Tjeldsund of Troms county. The term has also been used in this last sense, minus the Lofoten archipelago.

The name is currently used by the Dioceses of Nord-Hålogaland, Sør-Hålogaland, as well as by a Court of Appeal, a theater and a large bridge. A derived name is Helgeland which refers to southern Nordland.

==History==

Hålogaland figures extensively in the Norse sagas, and in the &#x27;, especially the &quot;Ynglinga Saga&quot; and &#x27;. It was inhabited by the race of Hölgi (&quot;&quot;) who was the eponymous hero of Hålogaland.

In the saga, &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, a man called Gudlög led a number of Norwegian pirates that were fought by the Swedish king Jorund and king Godgest of Hålogaland was given a horse by the Swedish king Adils. The first earl of Lade, Håkon Grjotgardsson, ruler of Trøndelag, came from Hålogaland, and sought to extend his kingdom southwards. Here, he met with Harald Fairhair, and joined him.

Archaeologists have uncovered the Chieftain House at Borg in Lofoten (&quot;&quot;), a large Viking Age building believed to have been already established around the year 500. Archaeological studies commenced here in 1983 and in 1986–89, a joint Scandinavian research project was conducted at Borg. Excavations brought to light remains of the largest building ever to be found from the Viking Era in Norway, 83 meters long and 9 meters high. The chieftain&#x27;s seat at Borg is estimated to have been abandoned around AD 950. Today the site is the location of the Lofotr Viking Museum.

==Geography==
Hålogaland is a drowned coastline containing extensive mountainous fjords and islands. It was a refuge for Viking ships as well as a way station for voyagers to the White Sea, which offered access to Russia. Narvik was an important World War II objective. In 2008, the name was proposed as the possible name of an independent Northern Norway.

<text>The Trumpet-Major is the seventh published novel by English author Thomas Hardy published in 1880, and his only historical novel. Hardy included it with his &quot;romances and fantasies&quot;. It concerns the heroine, Anne Garland, being pursued by three suitors: John Loveday, the eponymous trumpet major in a British regiment, honest and loyal; his brother Bob, a flighty sailor; and Festus Derriman, the cowardly nephew of the local squire. Unusually for a Hardy novel, the ending is not entirely tragic; however, there remains an ominous element in the probable fate of one of the main characters.

The novel is set in Weymouth during the Napoleonic wars; the town was then anxious about the possibility of invasion by Napoleon. Of the two brothers, John fights with Wellington in the Peninsular War, and Bob serves with Nelson at Trafalgar. The Napoleonic Wars was a setting that Hardy would use again in his play, &quot;The Dynasts&quot;, and it borrows from the same source material.

Edward Neill has called the novel an attempt to repeat the success of his earlier work &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; (1874), after the limited success of his intervening works. The novel originally appeared in 1880 in the Evangelical serial &quot;Good Words&quot; (January–December) with 33 illustrations by John Collier. The three-volume first edition was published in October 1880.

==Plot==
=== Window overlooking the Down ===
It&#x27;s 1804 and England expects an invasion attempt by Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s armies. Near Budmouth (Weymouth) Anne Garland lives with her widowed mother in part of a flour mill, next to their landlord and friend miller William Loveday. Thousands of soldiers pitch camp on the downs nearby, ready to meet the invasion. Anne attracts the admiration of two of them, both with local connections: Trumpet Major John Loveday, the decent and thoughtful son of the miller, and Yeomanry officer Festus Derriman, the boastful and aggressive nephew of the skinflint local squire. Anne favours John and loathes Festus, but Festus pesters her, a situation not helped by her mother&#x27;s desire for her to marry him on account of his rank and (assumed) wealth. However, when her mother changes her view (partly due to the miller&#x27;s courting of her) and favours marriage to John, Anne changes her mind and favours Festus, thinking herself too ‘high’ for a miller&#x27;s son.

Into all this walks Bob Loveday, the miller&#x27;s younger son, home from a life in the merchant navy. Anne has a secret passion for him (they were childhood sweethearts), but he has brought home Matilda, a prospective bride whom he met just two weeks earlier in Southampton. John and Matilda recognise each other, and after a private conversation about her past she does a midnight flit. John tells Bob what&#x27;s happened, and although Bob understands, he can&#x27;t help resenting John&#x27;s intervention. Miller Loveday and Mrs Garland marry, John&#x27;s regiment moves away (with neither Anne, Bob nor Festus sorry to see him go), and Anne turns her focus to Bob. Anne plays hard to get with Bob, while Festus continues to pester her. She discovers that John sent Matilda away for honourable reasons (she&#x27;d previously thought he&#x27;d done it to elope with her), and writes him an apologetic letter, which he misinterprets as encouragement. Festus&#x27;s uncle insists on telling Anne where he&#x27;s hidden his will and other documents, but she drops the (cryptic) details in a field, where they&#x27;re found by a mysterious woman.

=== The Conversation in the Crowd ===
The invasion beacons are lit, although it&#x27;s a false alarm. In the chaos Festus almost has Anne at his mercy in an isolated cottage. She escapes and is found by John. He finds Festus and beats him, but drunken Festus thinks he&#x27;s Bob. John thinks he has a chance with Anne but discovers she&#x27;s with Bob, so to cover his embarrassment he pretends to be in love with an unnamed actress at the Budmouth theatre. Pressed to show Anne and Bob his sweetheart, John buys them tickets for the play, which is also attended by the King and Queen, who are staying in Budmouth. Matilda appears on stage, and John&#x27;s shocked expression is mistaken for passion. Festus, lurking as always, encounters Matilda (who is also the mysterious woman from earlier) out for a late-night walk. The press gang (naval recruiters who force men into service) are in town, and Festus and Matilda tip them off that Bob is an experienced sailor. The press gang come to the mill, but Bob escapes, with help from Matilda, who regrets her earlier action.

Bob, however, feels increasing guilty about not serving his country. Discovering that John still loves Anne tips the balance, and Bob persuades local man Captain Hardy (real-life captain of Nelson&#x27;s flagship, HMS Victory) to take him on board, thus doing his duty and leaving the way clear for John.
Anne goes to Portland Head to watch the Victory sail past. In Budmouth she sits crying, and is comforted by the King, who is passing by. The Loveday family endure a long wait for news of the Victory, eventually hearing of the Battle of Trafalgar, but not whether Bob has survived. Finally a sailor comes to tell them that Bob is unharmed – but also that he&#x27;s engaged to a baker&#x27;s daughter in Portsmouth.

=== A Delicate Situation ===
John sees his chance, but Anne rejects him. Meanwhile, Festus discovers that John, not Bob, beat him up, and courts Matilda in the mistaken belief that this will upset John. Over a year or more, Anne begins to warm to John, and he is ecstatic – until a letter comes from Bob, saying he still wants Anne. John tries to be cold towards Anne, but this only makes her warmer towards him, until she virtually proposes to him, just as Bob, newly promoted to Naval Lieutenant, writes to say he&#x27;s coming home for her. Bob arrives and John withdraws. Anne rejects Bob, but he wears her down with his naval tales and fine uniform. However, when he makes his big move, she rejects him again, and he storms out. Anne is worried that he&#x27;ll do something stupid, but is distracted by Squire Derriman, who arrives asking her to hide his deeds box, as Festus and his new fiancée Matilda are searching the house for it. She hides it in a window seat.

=== A Call on Business===
Bob returns in good temper; he&#x27;s been drinking with his new best friend, Festus. Anne yields to Bob, saying that if he can behave himself with the ladies for six months she&#x27;ll be his. Then it turns out that Festus is waiting outside; he comes in, Anne flees, and watching from a hole in the floor of the room above, sees Squire Derriman sneak in and try to retrieve the box. Festus catches him, but Bob intervenes. Derriman snatches the box and disappears, with Festus and Matilda in pursuit. The next morning Squire Derriman is found dead from exhaustion, but the box has disappeared. It&#x27;s eventually found hidden in Anne&#x27;s room. Derriman has left all his property to Anne, except for a few small houses which will provide Festus with a living, but not luxury.

Festus and Matilda are married, Anne and Bob are to be engaged, and John&#x27;s regiment is posted away to battle in Spain, where, we are told, he will die.

== Themes ==

Hardy, who distrusted empiricism when it come to novels and history, as he felt it marginalized many important aspects of human elements. &quot;The Trumpet-Major&quot; tells the tale of a woman, who is courted by three men during the early 19th Century in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars, during the backdrop of an much anticipated and amphibious landing of Napoleon&#x27;s army on the British isles. In this setting, in which he explores the subversive effects and nature of ordinary human beings such when desire and conflicting loyalties on the systemized versions of history. As Hardy&#x27;s only novel of historical fiction, it makes stand out among some of Hardy&#x27;s more moral works. 

Like some of Hardy&#x27;s other famous and popular novels such as &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; and &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; such often implore and deal with deep concepts such as disappointment in love and the &quot;perversity of life&quot;, but &quot;The Trumpet-Major&quot; also deal with these very themes present in many novels and poems which are often laid with a carefully controlled elegiac feeling and much irony in them that make them stand out among the Victorian classical works of literature.

==Sources==
The book is unusual for being the only one of novels for which he wrote preliminary notes, in a pocket book traditionally labelled as &#x27;The Trumpet-Major Notebook&#x27;. It is also perhaps extraordinary in the extent to which Hardy aimed for historical accuracy; to that end, he conducted research at the British Museum and consulted various periodicals and newspaper accounts of the time. Richard H. Taylor has noted the accuracy of Hardy&#x27;s details in the novel. 

The novel is set during a time of great national fervour and patriotism when a French invasion of Britain was anticipated. The novel also highlights as the French could anytime invade Britain, the emotions of the British people who feared an invasion were already cautious mid way through the novel. 

This novel is based on stories told by his grandmother when he was a child and he fondly remembered her for the storyteller she was. Other sources include that Hardy, as a young man, would visit and spoke to the Chelsea Pensioners about the Peninsular War and the Hundred Days campaign in which Napoleon was utterly defeated by the British army of the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo.

==Operatic version==
Thomas Hardy&#x27;s novel provided the source of Alun Hoddinott&#x27;s opera &quot;The Trumpet Major&quot;, with libretto by Myfanwy Piper, first performed in Manchester on 1 April 1981.

==Adaptations==
=== Stage and Theatre ===
In 1908, the original Hardy Players put on a dramatised version of &quot;The Trumpet-Major&quot; at the Corn Exchange in Dorchester. Hardy was very involved with the play, working closely with its producer, Alfred Evans, whose daughter Evelyn later recounted that the two had many discussions in the study at Max Gate ‘deciding on the outline of the play, writing additional dialogue’ and discussing whether particular scenes should be retained or left out.
There were departures from the novel: while the novel ends of a tragic note, with John Loveday going off to his death on the battlefields of Spain, as Evelyn Evans writes: ‘the curtain of the re-written play fell on laughter, song and dancing.’
Hardy attended some rehearsals at the Corn Exchange, remarking on the fact that many of the performers were direct descendants of Dorset inhabitants who had lived through those turbulent times. Indeed, the production was thoroughly Dorchester-based: ‘the scenery painted from designs by local artists; the uniforms made by a local tailor after originals that had been worn by the Dorset Rangers’ and other local militia groups (the originals ‘still preserved in the attics of local folk’). Music was composed by a local musician, Frederick Boynton Smith.
Unfortunately, Hardy, who was now 68 years old, couldn&#x27;t attend the play as he was suffering from a chill, but Emma Hardy was there. He was, however, delighted by its reception.
The production caused quite a stir. As the &quot;Dorset County Chronicle&quot; reported: ‘there were to be observed in the front seats a posse of leading dramatic critics who had come down from London especially’, writing ‘critiques, to be wired to Town piping hot from their busily plying pencils.’ &quot;The Times&quot; devoted nearly a column to its review of the play and a leading article two days later: extraordinary exposure for an amateur company in a small county town, but clear evidence of Hardy&#x27;s status as an author of international standing. The reviews were so numerous that the company produced a souvenir programme containing extracts of them all. It runs to thousands of words: ten pages, double-columned and in very small print.
As Captain Acland, curator of the Dorset County Museum wrote to Evans after watching the play: ‘thanks, not only for the genuine treat it was to us all, but because you and your talented company have proved afresh to the world what Dorchester folk can do.’
In 1910, the play was revived at the Weymouth Pavilion, and Hardy was able to attend, travelling there by train with Albert Evans and his family. He wrote personal congratulations afterwards to Mr Bawler (Miller Loveday) and Mayor of Dorchester Mr Tilley (Cripplestraw) on playing their roles so realistically.
The play was again revived in 1912, for a performance at the Cripplegate Institute in London, which came with a very fine programme, including photos of the principal actors, engravings of Hardy&#x27;s birthplace and ‘Casterbridge from Ten Hatches’ and the songs from the play, written by Hardy and with music by Harry Pouncy and Boyton Smith.

=== In music and musicals ===
In 1958 The Musicmakers presented a &quot;new musical in three acts&quot; titled &quot;Farewell my Fancy&quot; at the Everyman Theatre in Reading. With book, music and lyrics by Michael Wild, the piece was a musical comedy &quot;suggested&quot; by &quot;The Trumpet Major&quot; and it featured all the major characters of the book. It was given six performances from 24 to 29 November 1958. A note of apology in the programme suggests that it was not authorised by the Hardy Estate.

== Historical analysis ==
===Hardy, The Trumpet Major and the Napoleonic Wars===
The Napoleonic Wars, and in particular the fear of invasion that pervaded Dorset at the beginning of the 19th century, were a source of fascination to Hardy from boyhood onwards.
Hardy&#x27;s interest in the Napoleonic Wars continued throughout his life. While writing &quot;The Return of the Native&quot;, in 1878, Hardy visited the Reading Room of the British Museum and read contemporary accounts of the Napoleonic Wars. He noted his findings in what became known as ‘The Trumpet-Major Notebook’ (now in the Dorset Museum). Hardy also met with Chelsea pensioners who had experienced the war first-hand. &quot;The Trumpet-Major&quot;, published in 1880 was born of that research.
Evelyn Evans, daughter of the man who produced Hardy&#x27;s plays, mentions that, shortly after the publication of &quot;The Dynasts&quot;, and while the first theatrical production of &quot;The Trumpet-Major&quot; was in rehearsal, in 1908, Hardy talked with veterans of Waterloo still alive and living in the neighbourhood.
Unlike most Hardy novels, in which the essence of the story is fictional – though often with reference to contemporary matters (such as changes in divorce law playing a part in &quot;The Woodlanders&quot;) – the real events of 1804-5 when Dorset was preparing for the palpable threat of French invasion near Weymouth (Budmouth) permeate &quot;The Trumpet Major&quot;, a danger that only receded with victory at Trafalgar.
Hardy was born in 1840, some 35 years after this period, and it&#x27;s not hard to imagine him sitting, as a child, listening to first-hand accounts of life in Dorset during that time and the way in which it dominated local people&#x27;s lives. The sense of these real recollections is woven into &quot;The Trumpet-Major&quot; – from Anne Garland and the old sailor watching out for the Victory in the English Channel, to the pervasive fear of press-gangs and imminent invasion, to the news freshly brought of the Battle of Trafalgar and death of Nelson, told with both intimacy and a sense of its historical momentousness.
The love story at the centre of the novel plays like a complex dance, with the two brothers, John and Bob Loveday and the villainous Festus Derriman all trying to gain the hand of Anne Garland. The sense of impending peril, with the ultimate fate of the young men unknown, in a time of war, serves to make the lightness and comedy that runs through &quot;The Trumpet-Major&quot; bittersweet, but the novel is all the deeper and richer for that sense of a tragic epilogue.

==The Trumpet-Major and Harlequinade==
=== The harlequinade tradition ===
The feeling that the characters are playing out a complex dance is not a coincidence. The story can be read as a variation on the traditional harlequinade, which in turn came from the old Italian Commedia dell&#x27;arte. In Victorian times, the harlequinade had become a popular form of theatre, burlesque and ballet. The characters and action in &quot;The Trumpet-Major&quot; mirror closely the characters and themes of this traditional form, as shown below.

==== The Characters ====
*Bob Loveday – Harlequin: Harlequin is the romantic male lead in the harlequinade. A servant, and in love with Columbine, in Commedia dell&#x27;arte, Harlequin was often mischievous. In English harlequinade, his character was more romantic (but fickle). He dresses in elaborate, colourful costume, and is portrayed as acrobatic. His high spirits and wit work to save him from the scrapes he gets himself into. It is easy to see Bob as Harlequin. He dresses in eye-catching finery ‘pantaloons and boots of the newest make; yards and yards of muslin wound round his neck, … two fancy waistcoats, … and coat-buttons like circular shaving glasses.’ He struts around in his new uniform to impress Anne; and, just like Harlequin, he is susceptible to falling in love with any available young woman when he&#x27;s away from Anne. A strong tradition of the harlequinade was Harlequin&#x27;s great ‘Leap’. Bob&#x27;s huge leap into an apple tree to escape the press-gang, ‘his figure flying like a raven’s across the sky’, is typical of this. His subsequent escape through a trap-door in the mill is as theatrical a piece of acrobatics as any found in Commedia dell&#x27;arte. That pursuit of Anne and Bob by the press-gang, incidentally, is closely based on one of the theatrical rituals of the Italian comedy: ‘The Chase’. In this, Columbine and her lover were typically hotly pursued by authority.
*Anne Garland – Columbine: Columbine is a pretty young woman who has caught the eye of Harlequin. Sometimes she is the female equivalent of Harlequin, dressed in similar costume. In the original Commedia dell&#x27;arte, she was either Pantaloon&#x27;s daughter or servant. In the English harlequinade, she is always Pantaloon&#x27;s daughter or ward. Her role usually centres on her romantic relationship with Harlequin. Anne Garland is a typical Columbine, demure but playful, vascillating between the brothers John and Bob Loveday. Her prettiness is counterpointed with her strength of character: ‘beneath all that was charming and simple… there lurked a real firmness, unperceived at first, as the speck of colour lurks unperceived in the heart of the palest parsley flower’; and her playfulness is evident throughout the text.
*Squire Derriman – Pantaloon: In Commedia dell&#x27;arte, Pantaloon was a greedy merchant obsessed with money and master of Columbine. Despite his cunning, he is often duped by Harlequin. In the English harlequinade, Pantaloon became the elderly father of Columbine, jealously guarding his daughter from suitors. He tries to keep the lovers apart, but is always outwitted by the young hero. Squire Derriman, likewise, is guileful, neurotic, old and wizened. Although he is not Anne&#x27;s father or guardian, Anne is his heiress. His fondness for Anne mirrors Pantaloon&#x27;s feeling for Columbine.
*Festus Derriman – Captain: The Captain exaggerated his past exploits, was courageous about the idea of fighting, and cowardly when faced with actual danger. He was usually drunken and incompetent. Festus has all of these characteristics, boasting to Anne, for instance, about his fighting prowess (while demonstrating his incompetence), hiding with the women when there&#x27;s a rumour of invasion, and partial to drink.
*Matilda Johnson – Soubrette: Soubrette was a minor character in Commedia dell&#x27;arte, who sometimes married Harlequin, sometimes Pantaloon. Like Matilda, she is characterised by her loose morals, love of life and enjoyment of intrigue.
*And finally, John Loveday, the Trumpet-Major himself – Pierrot: In Commedia dell&#x27;arte, Pierrot was a comic servant character, often naïve, and always heart-broken by his unrequited love for Columbine. The French version of Pierrot became something of a 19th-century ‘meme’: a melancholy, white-faced figure, pensive and silent. John Loveday is a thoughtful, simple-hearted man. His pallor is often remarked on, too – a nod at Pierrot&#x27;s painted white face.

<text>A Laodicean; or, The Castle of the De Stancys. A Story of To-Day is the eighth published novel by English author Thomas Hardy, first published in 1880–81 in &quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot;. The plot exhibits devices uncommon in Hardy&#x27;s other fiction, such as falsified telegrams and faked photographs.

==Synopsis==
Paula Power inherits a medieval castle from her industrialist father who had purchased it from the aristocratic De Stancy family. 

She employs two architects, one local and one, George Somerset, newly qualified from London. Somerset represents modernity in the novel. In the village there is an amateur photographer, William Dare, the illegitimate son of Captain De Stancy, an impoverished scion of that family. Captain De Stancy represents to Paula the notion of medieval nobility.

She is attracted to each man for his respectively different virtues.

William Dare, bastard and unrecognised son of Captain de Stancy, and a thorough wastrel, decides to intervene to promote his father in her affections (solely so that he, Dare, can continue to gamble and live off Paula&#x27;s income). He fakes a telegram and a photograph to make it appear that Somerset is leading a dissolute lifestyle as a drunken gambler. His subterfuge is discovered by Captain De Stancy&#x27;s sister Charlotte who has befriended Paula.

She decides to tell Paula the truth and Paula pursues Somerset to the continent where he has gone mistakenly believing Paula and the Captain to have been married. She finds him and they are reunited and marry. In revenge, Dare burns down the castle using his family&#x27;s portraits and furniture as kindling; Somerset proposes to build a modern house in its place.

The last line has Paula summing up her dichotomy of mind between modernity and romantic medievalism, and thus the two men, also emphasising the title &quot;a Laodicean&quot; (someone indifferent or half-hearted) — &quot;I wish my castle wasn&#x27;t burnt; and I wish you were a De Stancy!&quot; The usage of &quot;Laodicean&quot; to mean someone lacking commitment comes from a reference in the New Testament:

==Reception and criticism==
In his 1910 &quot;Essays on Modern Novelists&quot;, American critic and scholar William Lyon Phelps, wrote:

No one of Mr Hardy&#x27;s novels contain more of the facts of his own life than &quot;A Laodicean&quot;, which was composed on what the author then believed to be his death bed; it was mainly dictated, which I think partly accounts for its difference in style from the other tales... Not only does Mr Hardy&#x27;s scientific profession speak through the mouths of his characters, but old and beautiful buildings adorn his pages as they do the landscape he loves.

<doc id="1052205" wikidata="Q7859431" url="?curid=1052205" title="Two on a Tower">
<text>Two on a Tower: A Romance (1882) is a novel by English author Thomas Hardy, classified by him as a romance and fantasy. It is regarded as one of his minor works. It is one of Hardy&#x27;s Wessex novels, set in late Victorian Dorset.

==Epigraph==
Hardy placed an epigraph at the beginning of this book. The epigraph is from a Richard Crashaw poem, &quot;Love&#x27;s Horoscope&quot;. It reads:

&quot;Ah, my heart her eyes and she&lt;br&gt;
Have taught thee new astrology.&lt;br&gt;
Howe&#x27;er Love&#x27;s native hours were set,&lt;br&gt;
Whatever starry synod met,&lt;br&gt;
&#x27;Tis in the mercy of her eye,&lt;br&gt;
If poor Love shall live or die.&quot;
==Plot==
&quot;Two on a Tower&quot; is a tale of star-crossed love in which Hardy sets the emotional lives of his two lovers against the background of the stellar universe. The unhappily married Lady Constantine breaks all the rules of social decorum when she falls in love with Swithin St. Cleeve, an astronomer who is ten years her junior. Her husband&#x27;s death leaves the lovers free to marry, but the discovery of a legacy forces them apart. This is Hardy&#x27;s most complete treatment of the theme of love across the class and age divide and the fullest expression of his fascination with science and astronomy.

==Background==
In the 1895 preface Hardy wrote, &quot;The scene of the action was suggested by two real spots in the part of the country specified, each of which has a column standing upon it. Certain surrounding peculiarities have been imported into the narrative from both sites.&quot; Wimborne was the location of the &quot;little town&quot; of &quot;Warborne&quot;, and Charborough House was the location of the &quot;Welland House&quot; in &quot;Two on a Tower&quot;.

Hardy&#x27;s intention, in his own words, was to &quot;set the emotional history of two infinitesimal lives against the stupendous background of the stellar universe&quot;.

==Criticism==
Because the book defied the social norms of the day, upon release the book was called shocking, repulsive, and one critic called it Hardy&#x27;s &quot;worst yet.&quot; Hardy&#x27;s biographer, Claire Tomalin, says Hardy was &quot;writing for serialization, which drove him to pack in far too much plot,&quot; and he wrote too fast &quot;without time to think or reconsider.&quot;

Hardy wrote in a letter to Edmund Gosse on 10 Dec 1882, &quot;I get most extraordinary criticisms of T. on a T. Eminent critics write &amp; tell me in private that it is the most original thing I have done...while other eminent critics (I wonder if they are the same) print the most cutting rebukes you can conceive—show me (to my amazement) that I am quite an immoral person...”

The story takes place in a small woodland village called Little Hintock, and concerns the efforts of an honest woodsman, Giles Winterborne, to marry his childhood sweetheart, Grace Melbury. Although they have been informally betrothed for some time, her father has made financial sacrifices to give his adored only child a superior education and no longer considers Giles good enough for her. When the new doctor – a well-born and handsome young man named Edred Fitzpiers – takes an interest in Grace, her father does all he can to make Grace forget Giles, and to encourage what he sees as a brilliant match. Grace has misgivings prior to the marriage as she sees a village woman (Suke Damson) coming out of his cottage very early in the morning and suspects he has been sleeping with her. She tells her father that she does not want to go on with the marriage and he becomes very angry. Later Fitzpiers tells her Suke has been to visit him because she was in agony from toothache and he extracted a molar. Grace clutches at this explanation – in fact Fitzpiers has started an affair with Suke some weeks previously. After the honeymoon, the couple take up residence in an unused wing of Melbury&#x27;s house. Soon, however, Fitzpiers begins an affair with a rich widow named Mrs. Charmond, which Grace and her father discover. Grace finds out by chance that Suke Damson has a full set of teeth and realises that Fitzpiers lied to her. The couple become progressively more estranged and Fitzpiers is assaulted by his father-in-law after he accidentally reveals his true character to him. Both Suke Damson and Mrs Charmond turn up at Grace&#x27;s house demanding to know whether Fitzpiers is all right – Grace addresses them both sarcastically as &quot;Wives -all&quot;. Fitzpiers later deserts Grace and goes to the Continent with Mrs Charmond. Grace realises that she has only ever really loved Giles but as there is no possibility of divorce feels that her love seems hopeless.

Melbury is told by a former legal clerk down on his luck that the law was changed in the previous year (making the setting of the action 1858) and divorce is now possible. He encourages Giles to resume his courtship of Grace. It later becomes apparent, however, that Fitzpiers&#x27; adultery is not sufficient for Grace to be entitled to a divorce. When Fitzpiers quarrels with Mrs. Charmond and returns to Little Hintock to try to reconcile with his wife, she flees the house and turns to Giles for help. He is still convalescing from a dangerous illness, but nobly allows her to sleep in his hut during stormy weather, whilst he insists on sleeping outside. As a result, he dies. After it is learned that Mrs Charmond has died, murdered by a jealous former lover, Grace allows herself to be won back to the (at least temporarily) repentant Fitzpiers, thus sealing her fate as the wife of an unworthy man. This is after Suke&#x27;s husband Timothy Tangs has set a man trap to try to crush Fitzpiers&#x27; leg but it only tears Grace&#x27;s skirt.

No one is left to mourn Giles except a courageous peasant girl named Marty South, who has always loved him.
Marty is described as a plain girl but one with beautiful hair. She is persuaded to sell this at the start of the story to a barber who is procuring it for Mrs Charmond, after Marty realises that Giles loves Grace and not her. She precipitates the final quarrel between Fitzpiers and Mrs Charmond by writing to Fitzpiers and telling him of the origin of most of Mrs Charmond&#x27;s hair.

==Literary analysis==
The novel was later classified by Hardy for the Wessex Edition of his works in the primary group of &quot;Novels of Character and Environment&quot;. Yet despite it being regarded as one of Hardy&#x27;s major novels, the novel is &#x27;something of an anomaly&#x27;, in comparison with the tragic depth of both its predecessor &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; and its successor &quot;Tess of the D&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;.

===Themes===
The novel reflects common Hardy themes: a rustic, evocative setting, poorly chosen marriage partners, unrequited love, social class mobility, and an unhappy, or at best equivocal, ending. As with most his other works, opportunities for fulfilment and happiness are forsaken or delayed.

====Marriage and sexuality====
&quot;The Woodlanders&quot; marks the beginnings of controversy for Hardy&#x27;s novels. At this point in his career he was established enough as a writer to take risks, especially in the areas of sexuality, such as marriage, divorce, marital fidelity, and the use of unconventional plots and tones, and seemingly immoral conclusions. Hardy&#x27;s portrayal of sexual morality led to him being identified with the &#x27;Anti-marriage league&#x27;.

That marriage is less-than-exclusive in the novel is highlighted most clearly through the words and thoughts of Grace Melbury; as heroine and betrayed wife of an unfaithful husband, she ought to represent the moral centre, but she openly acknowledges sexual and marital infidelity. On Fitzpiers&#x27; illness, she welcomes Mrs Charmond and Suke Damson into the bedroom with the unsubtle, &quot;Indeed, you have a perfect right to go into his bedroom [...] Wives all, let&#x27;s enter together!&quot; When abandoned by him, she calls nature &quot;bountiful&quot; in so soon replacing him with another, tender form of &quot;undiluted manliness&quot; – Giles.

==Background==
Florence Emily Hardy, his second wife, recorded that in 1874 Hardy &quot;put aside a woodland story&quot;, which ten years later evolved into &quot;The Woodlanders&quot;. It was intended to be the successor to his 1874 &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot;, but he laid the novel aside to work on other things.

Hardy eventually decided to return to his &quot;woodland story&quot; after the editor of &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot; asked for a new serial in October 1884. It was published as a serial in this magazine and in the American &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; in 1887, followed by a three-volume first edition in March of the same year.

==Reception==
&quot;The Woodlanders&quot; was widely praised. It was declared by the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; in April 1887 to be, &quot;the best [novel] that Hardy has written&quot;, by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, &quot;his loveliest if not his finest book&quot;, by William Lyon Phelps, &quot;the most beautiful and most noble of Hardy&#x27;s novels&quot;, and by A. Edward Newton, &quot;one of the best novels of the last half century&quot;. The late nineteenth century English author George Gissing read the novel in March 1888 &quot;with much delight&quot; but felt that the &quot;human part is...painfully unsatisfactory&quot;.

The novel remained a personal favourite of Hardy. Newman Flower recounted that Hardy named it to him as his &quot;favourite novel&quot;, and 25 years after its publication, Hardy wrote that, &quot;On taking up &quot;The Woodlanders&quot; and reading it after many years, I like it as a story best of all.&quot;

==Adaptations==
Soon after the novel&#x27;s publication, Hardy was approached by Jack Grein and Charles Jarvis for permission to adapt it for performance in 1889. But although various drafts were written, the project came to nothing. It was not until 1913 that A.H. Evans&#x27; play in 3 acts was produced by the Dorchester Debating and Dramatic Society; the performance was also taken to London that year and to Weymouth in 1914. Years after Hardy&#x27;s death, David Horlock&#x27;s adaptation was staged at Salisbury Playhouse in 1983 and in the following century two dramatic adaptations of the novel went on tour in the West Country. In 2013 the New Hardy Players put on Emily Fearn&#x27;s version, and in 2016 the Hammerpuzzle Theatre Company put on Tamsin Kennard&#x27;s version.

The BBC made the novel into a film in 1970, starring Felicity Kendal and Ralph Bates. This was followed by Phil Agland&#x27;s &quot;The Woodlanders&quot; of 1997.

There have also been musical settings of various kinds of passages from the novel. Patrick Hadley&#x27;s &quot;Scene from The Woodlanders&quot; (1925) sets the final words for voice and chamber ensemble and was published by Oxford University Press in 1926. The novel was next adapted as an opera by Stephen Paulus and premiered by Opera Theatre of Saint Louis in 1985. A decade later it was performed at Oxford Playhouse in February 1995. A 15-minute &quot;Suite from the Woodlanders&quot; was also drawn from this by Paulus and in 1999 four descriptive passages were set by Anthony Payne as &quot;Scenes from &quot;The Woodlanders&quot; (1999) for soprano, two clarinets, violin and cello. This was described by Payne himself as &quot;a strange hybrid, midway between song cycle and tone poem&quot;.

<text>Eric &quot;Ricky&quot;Tomlinson (born 26 September 1939) is an English actor. He is best known for his television roles as Bobby Grant in the soap opera &quot;Brookside&quot; (1982–1988), DCI Charlie Wise in &quot;Cracker&quot; (1993–2006) and Jim Royle in &quot;The Royle Family&quot; (1998–2012). He also played the titular character in the 2001 football mockumentary &quot;Mike Bassett: England Manager&quot;.

==Early life==
Eric Tomlinson was born on 26 September 1939 at Burleigh House in Bispham, Blackpool, Lancashire, and has lived in Liverpool nearly all his life. His father was a baker and he was born in Bispham because, just after the outbreak of World War II, his mother Peggy was evacuated there over concerns that Liverpool would be bombed. He attended Walton Technical College in Walton, after passing an exam when he was just 13. His favourite subject was English.

From October 1955 to late 1956 Tomlinson played rhythm guitar in a band known as the Blackjacks, and later played banjo in bands known as the Guitanjos, Hobo Rick &amp; The City Slickers, and Hobo Rick and the Hi-Free Three. For a time, the band&#x27;s pianist was John &quot;Duff&quot; Lowe, a former member of Beatles forerunner the Quarrymen.

A plasterer by trade, Tomlinson worked on various building sites for many years.

==Career==
===Television===
As an actor he appeared as Bobby Grant in the soap opera &quot;Brookside&quot; from the show&#x27;s inception in 1982 until being written out in 1988, followed by DCI Charlie Wise in &quot;Cracker&quot; and as Jim Royle in the BBC sitcom &quot;The Royle Family&quot; in 1998.

In 2001 Tomlinson starred in the BBC Series &quot;Nice Guy Eddie&quot; playing a Liverpool private investigator. Using down-to-earth cases — actually based upon real-life ones from Liverpool private investigator Tony Smith — the show also starred Tom Ellis and John Henshaw.

Tomlinson featured heavily in series two of Paul Abbott&#x27;s series &quot;Clocking Off&quot;, in a BAFTA-nominated episode written by Danny Brocklehurst.

Tomlinson has fronted a series of television adverts for the utility company British Gas. In January 2010, he began to appear in a series of advertisements for the frozen food chain Farmfoods. In 2017, he provided a voiceover for an advert for McCain Foods.

On 19 June 2006, Tomlinson made his début as the guest celebrity in Dictionary Corner on the long-running UK Channel 4 game show &quot;Countdown&quot;.

In December 2006, he presented a programme in Channel Five&#x27;s &quot;Disappearing Britain&quot; series entitled &quot;When Coal Was King&quot;.

In March 2007, Tomlinson presented BBC&#x27;s &quot;One Life: Guilty My Arse&quot;, detailing his version of the &quot;Shrewsbury Two&quot; case, in which he compared his political activism as a trade unionist to the work of the suffragettes.

In March 2011, Tomlinson appeared in an advertising campaign for UK retail chain The Range.

The BBC broadcast a programme in its &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; series 13 on Tomlinson&#x27;s ancestors, which traced his family back through a number of carters working around Liverpool at a time when the city was a bustling port.

In 2020, Tomlinson, alongside his &quot;Royle Family&quot; co-star Ralf Little, presented a travel series called &quot;Ricky &amp; Ralf&#x27;s Very Northern Road Trip&quot; for Gold.

In 2023, Tomlinson appeared at Eurovision 2023 reciting a poem dedicated to the Beatles. He also reprised his role as the character Bobby Grant, and was seen putting up Ukrainian-themed bunting outside the Grant home on Brookside Close.

===Film===
Tomlinson has also starred in several films, notably &quot;Mike Bassett: England Manager&quot;, &quot;Raining Stones&quot; and &quot;Hillsborough&quot;, a made-for-TV film about the families of the victims of the Hillsborough disaster, in which he portrayed John Glover – the father of victim Ian Glover.

In 2017, Tomlinson starred in the LGBT short film &quot;Tellin&#x27; Dad&quot; (2017) (co-starring actor Carl Loughlin as his son) which was the first LGBT project he has been involved in and followed the journey of his son building up courage to come out to him. The film was released on DVD, Amazonplay and distributed by Peccadillo Pictures worldwide on several platforms and on their Boys on Film DVD collection.

===Music===
Tomlinson is also a keen banjo and harmonica player, and has played the instruments in many episodes of &quot;The Royle Family&quot;. In 2001 he teamed up with fellow &quot;Brookside&quot; actor Michael Starke and other friends for his own rendition of well-known folk songs including &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way To Tipperary&quot; and a cover of Shane MacGowan and The Popes&#x27; &quot;Are You Lookin&#x27; at Me?&quot; that reached No. 28 in the UK Singles Chart in 2001. A CD album entitled &quot;Music My Arse&quot; was released the same year, peaking at No. 127 in the UK Albums Chart. He released a single at Christmas 2006 entitled &quot;Christmas My A*se&quot; which reached No. 25.

===Theatre===
In 2006, Tomlinson toured to theatres across the UK with his show &quot;An Evening with Ricky Tomlinson&quot; where he was interviewed about his life by Elton Welsby.

During 2008 and 2009, Tomlinson took his &quot;Laughter Show&quot; theatrical revue on a UK tour with fellow comedians Tony Barton, Duncan Norvelle and Pauline Daniels.

In 2009, he took a lead role as the Head Judge in the &quot;VMH Club Star Talent Trail&quot;, a local talent-based competition held at the VMH Club in Garston. A large number of North West-based performers entered the competition, which was ultimately won by 14-year-old Shaun Walsh from Liverpool.

In May 2010, Tomlinson opened his own cabaret club the Green Room, in Liverpool, teaming up with brothers Richard and Simon Wallace, from Liverpool production company Red Hot Media, to open the 250-seater cabaret lounge on Duke Street.

==Personal life==
He had three children with his first wife.

On 19 October 2007, Tomlinson had quadruple heart bypass surgery at Liverpool&#x27;s Cardiothoracic Centre. Consultant cardiac surgeon Aung Oo said: &quot;The operation went according to plan and he is now recovering within the hospital&#x27;s critical care unit.&quot;

Tomlinson suffers from nodular prurigo, which was the subject of an interview in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in October 2013.

Tomlinson still resides in Liverpool, stating &quot;I will never, ever move away from Liverpool, I love it here.&quot;

==Politics==
In his late 20s, Tomlinson was attracted to right-wing politics and, by his own account, was a member of the National Front for a period after Enoch Powell&#x27;s April 1968 &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech. In the early 1970s, Tomlinson&#x27;s political views shifted to the left. He was affected by the book &quot;The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists&quot;, which was given to him by the governor of the prison in which he was being held.

In 1972, he joined the flying pickets in a building workers&#x27; dispute in Shrewsbury. Following allegations of violence during this protest, in 1973 Tomlinson was charged with &quot;conspiracy to intimidate&quot; as one of the Shrewsbury Two. Despite pleading his innocence at Shrewsbury Crown Court, he was found guilty and sentenced to two years in prison, alongside fellow picket Des Warren. After his release in 1975, he disrupted the TUC conference by shouting from the wings after he had been prevented from speaking on the stage. In 2012, Tomlinson and others sought to have the convictions overturned by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC). In 2013 a paper petition was launched, alongside the existing e-petition, for an Early Day Motion by MP John McDonnell to be brought. In July 2013, at the Durham Miners&#x27; Gala, he again campaigned against the convictions. In May 2020 it was announced that the CCRC had referred a number of convictions relating to the Shrewsbury dispute, including Tomlinson&#x27;s, to the Court of Appeal which subsequently overturned the convictions in March 2021.

Tomlinson is a close friend of Arthur Scargill and often appears on party political broadcasts for Scargill&#x27;s Socialist Labour Party, most recently for the 2009 European Parliament elections. He is a long-time member of the Socialist Labour Party, and is the party&#x27;s most prominent celebrity supporter since its formation in 1996.

He has also expressed support for the Campaign for a New Workers&#x27; Party. A public meeting was hosted by the CNWP in Liverpool on Monday 12 February 2007, which Tomlinson addressed alongside Tommy Sheridan and Tony Mulhearn in which he used the slogan: &quot;New Labour My Arse&quot;.

On 5 February 2010, Tomlinson revealed his plan to stand as the Socialist Labour Party candidate for the Liverpool Wavertree constituency at the 2010 general election in protest at the selection of Luciana Berger, a 28-year-old Londoner as the Labour Party candidate. Kim Singleton was ultimately selected for the seat; in a statement, the SLP said that he could not contest the election due to &quot;personal and contractual commitments&quot;. Tomlinson added: &quot;I am disappointed not to be able to stand. But I am pleased to give the chosen candidate my wholehearted support.&quot; He also commented, &quot;People say you could be letting the Tories in. But there is no difference between the Conservatives and New Labour&quot;. Singleton ultimately finished sixth out of seven candidates, with Berger winning the seat.

In a guest appearance on an episode of the ITV lunchtime chat show, &quot;Loose Women&quot;, broadcast on 17 August 2015, while discussing the forthcoming Labour Party leadership election, Tomlinson said:

I know both of them and I know Andy quite well, and he was my choice right up until I went to listen to Jeremy Corbyn and I went to the Adelphi Hotel where there was 3,000 people there, the room holds 800 and were out into the streets, they couldn&#x27;t get in. And everything he said with I agreed with you know, leave the National Health Service alone, get rid of Trident, stuff like that, so it doesn&#x27;t matter to me who gets the Labour leadership, it really doesn&#x27;t matter. But whatever happens both of them will be in the Shadow Cabinet.
In the 2020 Labour Party leadership election, Tomlinson endorsed Sir Keir Starmer, who he said he had worked with during the Shrewsbury 24 justice campaign.

===Richard Whiteley claims===
In March 2017, Tomlinson claimed during an interview that the late journalist, broadcaster and game show host Richard Whiteley had been an undercover agent for the British security services and had assisted them in securing his 1973 imprisonment by co-presenting a television documentary called &quot;Red Under the Bed&quot;, which was critical of his political and trade union activities and had swayed the jury. The CCRC cited the documentary and its possible influence on the jury when announcing its decision to refer the cases of Tomlinson and others to the Court of Appeal.

==Charity work==
In 2008, Tomlinson donated £200,000 as patron of the Human Milk Bank of Cheshire and North Wales. The charity provides babies on Special Care Baby Units with milk from donor mothers, significantly improving their chances of survival and long-term development. He said: &quot;Due to my own recent experiences with my health, I know how much hospitals and appeals appreciate help and assistance. This is such an important service which can help so many families and I&#x27;m very honoured to be the patron.&quot;

In November 2010, it was reported that Tomlinson had donated £1 million to the Alder Hey Children&#x27;s Hospital in Liverpool two years previously.

==Honours==
In October 2014, Tomlinson was awarded the Freedom of Liverpool.

<text>Maximilian Harden (born Felix Ernst Witkowski, 20 October 1861 – 30 October 1927) was an influential German journalist and editor.

==Biography==
Born the son of a Jewish merchant in Berlin, he attended the &quot;Französisches Gymnasium&quot; until he began to train as an actor and joined a traveling theatre troupe. In 1878 Harden converted to Protestantism and started his journalistic career as a theatre critic in 1884. He also published political essays under the pseudonym &quot;Apostata&quot; in several liberal newspapers like the &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot; edited by Rudolf Mosse.

Commencing from 1892, Harden published the journal &quot;Die Zukunft&quot; (&quot;The Future&quot;) in Berlin. His baroque style was mocked by former friend Karl Kraus, who wrote a satire on &quot;translations from Harden&quot;.

Initially a monarchist, Harden became a fierce critic of Kaiser Wilhelm II and his entourage including Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg, and General Kuno von Moltke. His public accusations, from 1906 on for homosexual behaviour – according to Paragraph 175 of the criminal code, a criminal offence at that time – led to numerous trials and caused sustained damage to the reputation of the ruling House of Hohenzollern and the German jurisdiction, the whole episode denoted as the Eulenburg affair. 

In reaction, Karl Kraus, disgusted by the public display of intimate details, wrote an obituary: &quot;Maximilian Harden. Eine Erledigung&quot; (A Settlement).

By 1914, Harden had moved sufficiently to the right that he welcomed the German invasion of Belgium. During the war, Harden was an annexationist who wrote numerous articles demanding that Germany win the war to annex most of Europe, Africa, and Asia to make the &quot;Reich&quot; the world&#x27;s greatest power. However, after the war, he turned into a pacifist and supported the regime of the Weimar Republic. In 1921, he devoted two issues of &quot;Die Zukunft&quot; to the assassination of Talat Pasha and the subsequent trial of the assassin, harshly criticizing Germany&#x27;s failure to take action against the Armenian genocide.

In the following years, Harden&#x27;s readership diminished. On 3 July 1922, a few days after the assassination of Walther Rathenau, he was severely injured in an assault conducted by Freikorps members. In the following trial, the court ruled that his writings had &quot;provoked&quot; the two assailants, Bert Weichardt and Albert Wilhelm Grenz. Both were charged and sentenced to two years and five months, and four years, respectively.

Harden abandoned the publishing of &quot;Die Zukunft&quot; and, in 1923, retired to Montana, Switzerland, where he died four years later. His grave is located in Berlin at the Friedhof Heerstraße &quot;(Feld 8-C-10 (Reg. 335) (Ehrengrab)&quot;). 

British historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote: Harden was certainly the most brilliant political writer during the reign of Wilhelm II. His paper, &quot;Die Zukunft&quot;, had a unique influence despite its small circulation. But Harden&#x27;s spirit was essentially critical and destructive. He always took up men when they were down-Bismarck after his fall and Holstein after his resignation. Equally he denounced those who were up-Wilhelm II when in power, and even Ebert. His outstanding achievement was to hound Eulenburg from public life-not much to be really proud of. In international affairs, he swung from one extreme to another: at one time a Big Navy man, later an advocate of a naval agreement. At the beginning of the First World War, he was a violent annexationist, towards its end, a Wilsonian democrat and internationalist. He remained constant only in his high opinion of himself and contempt for everybody else.

<text>Pastra () is a village and a community in the southeastern part of the island of Kefalonia, Greece. It was the seat of the municipality of Eleios-Pronnoi. The community consists of the villages Pastra and Kremmydi. Pastra is 2 km northeast of Markopoulo, 3 km south of Agia Eirini, 5 km northwest of Skala, 6 km southwest of the port town of Poros and 25 km southeast of Argostoli.

==Population==

== History ==
According to 19th century Greek geographer and historian, Antonios Miliarakis, the village of Pastra and the area of the two villages (Kremmydi and Agios Giorgis) around it, used to be called Balta (later Valtes), and got its name from the many reeds and the streams it has. The name Valtes is said to be of Albanian origin and , &quot;mud&quot; or &quot;swamp&quot;.

Albanian soldiers, from the Albanian colony of the Republic of Venice, inhabited the area during the 15th century when the Venetians gave them land in the &quot;xomero&quot; to settle with their families. Xomero meaning an outlying place, away from the capital. At the time, Kefalonia was also a colony of the Republic of Venice. The village was later renamed Pastra in 1890 until today. Until 2010 it was the capital of the municipality of Elios - Pronnon.

<doc id="1052237" wikidata="Q6483859" url="?curid=1052237" title="Land Act of 1804">
<text>The Land Act of 1804 was U.S. legislation that refined provisions for the purchase of U.S. public land north of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi River. At the time, the region was divided into the Indiana Territory and the State of Ohio. The goal of the change was to make migration to the western United States more attractive. Titled &quot;An Act making provision for the disposal of the public lands in the Indiana territory, and for other purposes&quot;, the act was passed by Congress on March 26, 1804.

==Background==
The Land Act of 1804 superseded the Harrison Land Act of 1800, introduced by William Henry Harrison, then the congressional delegate representing the Northwest Territory. The goal of the legislation was to attract more immigrants to the western United States by allowing smaller tracts of land to be sold, rather than large tracts that individuals could not afford. The Harrison Land Act reduced the minimum amount of land that could be purchased from to and introduced a credit feature by which one-fourth of the purchase price was required at the time of purchase and the balance was payable in annual installments over four years. The minimum price of $2.00 an acre was unchanged from the Land Act of 1796, in which the price was doubled from that set by the Land Ordinance of 1785.
Once the United States Congress enacted the Land Act of 1804 it directly dealt with land in states like Ohio and Indiana. The Act allowed Ohioans to purchase land via credit. 

https://www.in.gov/history/2896.htm
However, &quot;The credit provision worked badly in terms of government revenue and was eventually repealed in 1820.&quot;

https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/8th-congress/c8.pdf
The Land Act of 1804 was passed at the first session of the eighth congress in Washington, D.C. towards the end of the session in 1804.

<text>Albert H. Brigance (1932–2007) was an author and special education resource specialist from Maryville, Tennessee, United States.

In 1975-1978 Brigance created a comprehensive inventory of basic skills for his own use in his work as an assessment specialist for the California Master Plan in Humboldt and Del-Norte counties in northern California. Colleagues urged him to find a commercial publisher. The Brigance Inventory of Basic Skills became an instrument for assessment evaluation, student academic placement, Individual Educational Plans (IEPs), and instructional planning.

Subsequent instruments include early childhood screening instruments, and other inventories for individuals from birth through secondary levels of education. Recent revisions of the screens and inventories have included standardized, normed assessments, and online data management services from publisher, Curriculum Associates, Inc.

September 28, 2012, Southeastern Oklahoma State University, Durant, OK, opened the Albert H. Brigance Curriculum and Assessment Center, housed in the Henry G. Bennett Memorial Library on campus. In 1999, Albert Brigance (&#x27;55) was honored as a Distinguished Alumnus of Southeastern Oklahoma State University.

<text>Topsy-Turvy is a 1999 British musical period drama film written and directed by Mike Leigh, starring Jim Broadbent as W. S. Gilbert and Allan Corduner as Sir Arthur Sullivan, along with Timothy Spall, Lesley Manville and Ron Cook. The story concerns the 15-month period in 1884 and 1885 leading up to the premiere of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Mikado&quot;. The film focuses on the creative conflict between playwright and composer, and their decision to continue their partnership, which led to their creation of several more Savoy operas.

The film received very favourable reviews, film festival awards and two Academy Awards for design. While it is considered an artistic success as an in-depth illustration of British life in the theatre during the Victorian era, the film did not recover its production costs. Leigh cast actors who did their own singing in the film, and the singing performances were faulted by some critics, while others lauded Leigh&#x27;s strategy.

==Plot==
On the opening night of &quot;Princess Ida&quot; at the Savoy Theatre in January 1884, composer Sir Arthur Sullivan, ill from kidney disease, is barely able to make it to the theatre to conduct. He goes on a holiday to the continent hoping that the rest will improve his health. While he is away, ticket sales and audiences at the Savoy Theatre wilt in the hot summer weather. Producer Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte has called on Sullivan and the dramatist W. S. Gilbert to create a new piece for the Savoy, but it is not ready when &quot;Ida&quot; closes. Until a new piece can be prepared, Carte revives an earlier Gilbert and Sullivan work, &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;.

Gilbert&#x27;s idea for their next opera involves a transformative magic lozenge, which Sullivan feels is too similar to the magic potion and other magic talismans used in previous operas and mechanical in its reliance on a supernatural device. Sullivan, under pressure from the British musical establishment to write more serious music, says he longs for something that is &quot;probable&quot;, centers on &quot;human interest&quot;, and is not dependent on magic. Gilbert sees nothing wrong with his libretto and refuses to write a new one, resulting in a standoff. The impasse is resolved after Gilbert and his wife visit a popular exhibition of Japanese arts and crafts in Knightsbridge, London. When the katana sword he purchases there noisily falls off the wall of his study, he is inspired to write a libretto set in exotic Japan. Sullivan likes the idea and agrees to compose the music for it.

Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte work to make &quot;The Mikado&quot; a success, and many glimpses of rehearsals and stressful backstage preparations for the show follow: cast members lunch together before attempting to negotiate their salaries. Gilbert brings in Japanese girls from the exhibition to teach the ladies&#x27; chorus how to walk and use fans in the Japanese manner. The principal cast react to the fittings of their costumes designed by C. Wilhelm. The cast objects to Gilbert&#x27;s proposed cut of the title character&#x27;s Act Two solo, &quot;A more humane Mikado,&quot; persuading the playwright to restore it. The actors face first-night jitters in their dressing rooms. Finally &quot;The Mikado&quot; is ready to open. As usual, Gilbert is too nervous to watch the opening performance and paces the streets. Returning to the theatre, he finds that the new opera is a resounding success.

==Depiction of Victorian society==

Film professor Wheeler Winston Dixon wrote that the film &quot;uses the conventions of the biographical narrative film to expose the ruthlessness and insularity of the Victorian era, at the same time as it chronicles, with great fidelity, the difficulties of a working relationship in the creative arts. ... &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot; is an investigation into the social, political, sexual and theatrical economies of the Victorian era&quot;.

While the film deals primarily with the production of &quot;The Mikado&quot;, it depicts many aspects of 1880s British life and society, some based on historical episodes. Scenes show George Grossmith&#x27;s use of morphine; Leonora Braham&#x27;s alcoholism and single motherhood; Jessie Bond&#x27;s health issues, including an abscess on her leg that does not heal; Sullivan&#x27;s visit to a French brothel and his relationship with his longtime mistress, Fanny Ronalds, implying that she obtains an abortion; three actors&#x27; discussion of the destruction of the British garrison at Khartoum by the Mahdi; a private salon concert; a conversation about the use of nicotine by women; and Gilbert being accosted outside the theatre on opening night by an elderly prostitute. The film also depicts the Savoy Theatre as having electric lighting; it was the first public building in Britain, and one of the first of any kind, to be lit entirely by electricity. Another scene shows an early use of the telephone. During costume fittings, the actors protest at having to perform without their corsets for the sake of accuracy.

==Production==
Principal photography took place at 3 Mills Studios in London beginning 29 June 1998 and completed shooting on 24 October. Location shooting took place in London and Hertfordshire, and scenes which took place at the Savoy Theatre were filmed at the Richmond Theatre in Richmond, London. The film&#x27;s budget was $20,000,000.

==Release==
===Box office===
In the United States, the film grossed $31,387 on its opening weekend and $6,208,548 in total. In the United Kingdom, the film grossed £139,700 on its opening weekend and £610,634 ($1 million) in total.

===Critical reception===
The film received very positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 90% &quot;Fresh&quot; score based on 88 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Dressed to the nines in exquisite production value and buoyed by Mike Leigh&#x27;s sardonic wit, &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot; is rich entertainment that is as brainy as it is handsome.&quot; Metacritic reports a 90 out of 100 rating based on 31 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot; &quot;grandly entertaining&quot;, &quot;one of those films that create a mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities, much as &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; did&quot;. She continued:
&quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot; ... is much bigger than their story. Its aspirations are thrilling in their own right. Mr. Leigh&#x27;s gratifyingly long view of life in the theatre (Gilbert has a dentist who tells him &quot;Princess Ida&quot; could have been shorter) includes not only historical and biographical details but also the painstaking process of creating a Gilbert and Sullivan production from the ground up. The film details all this with the luxury of a leisurely pace, as opposed to a slow one.

Richard Schickel in &quot;Time&quot; magazine described the film as &quot;one of the year&#x27;s more beguiling surprises&quot; and a &quot;somewhat comic, somewhat desperate, very carefully detailed&quot; story given &quot;heartfelt heft&quot; in the way it depicts how rehearsing and putting on a comic opera &quot;takes over everyone&#x27;s life&quot;. According to Philip French in &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;&quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot; is not a conventional biographical film. ... [It] is an opulently mounted, warm-hearted celebration of two great artists and of a dedicated group of actors, backstage personnel and front-of-house figures working together.&quot; French also calls the film &quot;a rare treat, thanks to Dick Pope&#x27;s photography, Eve Stewart&#x27;s production design and Lindy Hemming&#x27;s costumes&quot;, with &quot;great music orchestrated by Carl Davis.&quot; For Roger Ebert, it was &quot;one of the year&#x27;s best films.&quot;

&quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot; ranks 481st on &quot;Empire&quot;″s 2008 list of the 500 greatest films of all time.

==Awards and honours==
At the 72nd Academy Awards, &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot; received the Academy Award for Best Costume Design and the Academy Award for Best Makeup, and was nominated for Best Art Direction and Best Original Screenplay.

The film also won Best Make Up/Hair at the 53rd British Academy Film Awards and was nominated for Best British Film, Best Actor in a Leading Role (Jim Broadbent), Best Supporting Actor (Timothy Spall) and Best Original Screenplay. Broadbent also won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 56th Venice International Film Festival, and the film was nominated for the Golden Lion at the same festival.

&quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot; won the Best British Film Award at the Evening Standard British Film Awards, Best Film (shared with Spike Jonze&#x27;s &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;) and Best Director at the 1999 National Society of Film Critics Awards, and Best Picture and Best Director at the 1999 New York Film Critics Circle Awards.

<doc id="1052248" wikidata="Q851267" url="?curid=1052248" title="Loot (play)">
<text>Loot is a two-act play by the English playwright Joe Orton. The play is a dark farce that satirises the Roman Catholic Church, social attitudes to death, and the integrity of the police force.

&quot;Loot&quot; was Orton&#x27;s third major production, following &quot;Entertaining Mr Sloane&quot; and the television play &quot;The Good and Faithful Servant&quot;. Playing with the conventions of popular farce, Orton creates a hectic world and examines English attitudes and perceptions in the mid-twentieth century. The play won several awards in its London run and has had many revivals.

==Plot outline==
&quot;Loot&quot; follows the fortunes of two young thieves, Hal and Dennis. Together they rob the bank next to the funeral parlour where Dennis works and return to Hal&#x27;s home to hide the money. Hal&#x27;s mother has just died and the money is hidden in her coffin while her body keeps on appearing around the house. Upon the arrival of Inspector Truscott, the plot becomes bizarre as Hal and Dennis try to keep him off their trail, aided by Nurse McMahon and to the despair of Hal&#x27;s father, Mr. McLeavy. The play satirises the rituals of bereavement, and the mismatch between nominal standards of behaviour—religious and secular—and people&#x27;s actual conduct. The police, as represented by Inspector Truscott, are depicted as venal and corrupt.

As is typical of Orton&#x27;s writing the humour of the dialogue arises from the contrast between the shocking and bizarre elements that punctuate what the characters say and the mechanically genteel utterance that predominates in their speech.

==Production history==
Orton completed a first draft in October 1964, which premiered in Cambridge on 1 February 1965. The production starred Geraldine McEwan, Kenneth Williams, Duncan Macrae and Ian McShane and was directed by Peter Wood.

Responses to the first production were extremely mixed, with many in the audience outraged, as Orton had intended, but largely negative reviews also affected the box office. The &quot;London Evening News&quot; called it &quot;one of the most revolting things I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; The first run ended at Wimbledon on 20 March 1965 with the play considered a flop due to its problems with repeated script rewrites, uneven direction, a stylish but unsympathetic set, and what many considered the miscasting of Williams.

&quot;Loot&quot; was successfully revived the following year, however. in two separate productions.

The first was directed by Braham Murray artistic director of the Century Theatre and performed at the new University Theatre in Manchester.  Encouraged by the producer Michael Codron, who had been associated with both the successful London production of Entertaining Mr Sloane and the much less successful production of Loot outside London the previous year, Braham met with Orton and agreed to try again with a production more to Orton’s taste than the original. He also agreed to get much of the original text – censored before the first production - restored and in a personal visit to the Lord Chamberlain’s (censor’s) office succeeded in doing so. Cut by the author from three to two acts in rehearsals but now including most of the originally censored  material, and starring Julian Chagrin as Truscott, supported by Michael Elwyn and Peter Childs as Hal and Dennis, the play opened in Spring 1966 in Manchester. Loot for the first time received  favourable reviews and transferred to London with a new director and cast.

&quot;Now&quot; at the Jeanette Cochrane Theatre in Holborn. It opened on 27 September 1966 with Gerry Duggan as McLeavy, Sheila Ballantine as Fay, Kenneth Cranham as Hal, Simon Ward as Dennis, and Michael Bates as Inspector Truscott. It was directed by Charles Marowitz and designed by Tony Carruthers. The production transferred to the Criterion Theatre in November 1966.

The play was staged at the Manhattan Theatre Club in a production directed by John Tillinger. It opened on 18 February 1986. Kevin Bacon played Dennis, Željko Ivanek played Hal, Zoë Wanamaker played Fay, Charles Keating played McLeavy, Joseph Maher played Truscott (winning a Drama Desk Award for his performance), and Nick Ullett played Meadows.

A 2017 production directed by Michael Fentiman was staged at the Park Theatre, Finsbury Park, before transferring to the Watermill Theatre, Newbury. Christopher Fulford played Inspector Truscott and Sinead Matthews Nurse McMahon. The dead body was played by Anah Ruddin. Positive reviews for the production were published in &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;. Michael Billington in &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave &quot;Loot&quot; a five star rating, commenting on the way Fentiman referenced the &quot;shock tactics&quot; in Orton&#x27;s work, and stating: &quot;the result not only sharpens an already subversive text but yields a first-rate production by Michael Fentiman that reminds us of the serious intent behind Orton’s drollery.&quot;

==Film version==
*&quot;Loot&quot; was made into a film of the same name in 1970, directed by Silvio Narizzano and starring Richard Attenborough, Lee Remick, Hywel Bennett and comedian Dick Emery.

<text>Government Center station is an intermodal transit hub in the Government Center district of Downtown Miami, Florida. It is operated by Miami-Dade Transit and serves as a transfer station for the Metrorail and Metromover rapid transit systems and as a bus station for Metrobus, Paratransit, and Broward County Transit buses. MiamiCentral is directly connected via a pedestrian bridge over NW 3rd Street. The station is located near the intersection of Northwest First Street and First Avenue, a part of the Stephen P. Clark Government Center Building. It opened to service May 20, 1984, next to the site of a former FEC railway station which is now MiamiCentral.

== History ==
=== Metrorail and Metromover station ===
Development of the civic center was reinvigorated during the 1970s and early 1980s during a Downtown building boom. The boom spurred the development and construction of the Stephen P. Clark Government Center, Metrorail, Metromover, and the Miami-Dade Cultural Plaza, which currently includes HistoryMiami and the Miami-Dade Public Library System Main Library.

Construction on the present-day Government Center station began in June 1982. The station was primarily designed by the Cambridge Seven Associates in collaboration with Edward D. Stone. The station was built by the Frank J. Rooney Construction Company. Metrorail service, between Overtown and Kendall, following the precise route of the FEC, commenced service May 1984.

An unused, partially completed ghost platform for a future East-West Metrorail line is adjacent to the west side of the mezzanine level below the current Metrorail station and is easily visible to passengers transferring from Metromover to Metrorail. This platform was part of the original design concept which interfaced with the atrium of the Miami-Dade County Administration Building, and the people mover station.

=== Florida East Coast Railroad station ===

Next to Government Center station is the former site of a railroad station developed in April 1896 as the southern terminus of Henry Flagler&#x27;s Florida East Coast Railway (FEC). The downtown passenger terminal was demolished by November 1963. The FEC still owns the old station site, which was occupied by parking lots until 2014. It is now MiamiCentral, an intermodal transit hub. It has been served by Brightline higher-speed inter-city trains since 2018, and served by Tri-Rail commuter trains since 2024.

== Station layout ==
The second floor of the complex includes the main fare control for Metrorail and platforms for the Metromover loops, as well as the Metrofare Shops area. The third floor of the complex is a mezzanine for transfers between the two services. A ghost platform for a never-built east-west Metrorail line is located on this level. The fourth floor of the complex is the Metrorail platform. It is the highest transit platform of the Miami-Dade Transit system in height and can hold up to eight Metrorail cars.

<text>&#x27; (Verdi&quot;&quot;&#x27; (stylized as &quot;ver.di&quot;; [ˈvɛʁdiː]); English: &quot;United Services Trade Union&quot;) is a German trade union based in Berlin, Germany. It was established on 19 March 2001 as the result of a merger of five individual unions and is a member of the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB). With around 1.9 million members, Verdi is the second largest German trade union after IG Metall. It currently employs around 3000 members of staff in Germany and has an annual income of approximately 454 million Euros obtained from membership subscriptions. The trade union is divided into 10 federal state districts and five divisions and is managed by a National Executive Board (Bundesvorstand) with nine members. Frank Bsirske was the chairman of Verdi from its founding in 2001 until September 2019, when was elected.

== Establishment ==
Verdi was established in March 2001 as the result of a merger of five individual unions, all of which, other than the DAG, had previously belonged to the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB):

* German Salaried Employees&#x27; Union (DAG)
* German Postal Union (DPG)
* Trade, Banking and Insurance Union (HBV)
* Media Union (IG Medien)
* Public Services, Transport and Traffic Union (ÖTV)

The oldest forerunner of Verdi was the Association of German Printers (Verband der Deutschen Buchdrucker), which was founded in 1866.

Discussions on closer cooperation between German trade unions had already been conducted back in the 1990s. These negotiations not only involved the future founding partners of Verdi, but also the former TRANSNET (GdED), the Education and Science Workers&#x27; Union (GEW) and the Food, Beverages and Catering Union (NGG).

On 4 October 1997, the chairmen of the DAG, DPG, GEW, HBV, IG Medien and ÖTV signed the &quot;Hamburg Declaration&quot;, in which they supported the reorganisation of the representation of trade union interests in the service sector. This resulted in the establishment of a steering committee that worked in close cooperation with the executive committees of the trade unions involved to develop the key aspects of the fusion and the structure of the future large trade union.

After the GEW had left the merger process, the heads of the DAG, DPG, HBV, IG Medien and ÖTV agreed on the merger in the German city of Magdeburg in June 1999. In autumn of the same year, they opened a joint office in Berlin and in November 1999, the delegates of the five unions held extraordinary union conferences at which they agreed to establish a transitional organisation (GO-ver.di).

The representatives of the unions involved viewed the merger as a historic step, claiming that it would bring an end to the &quot;rivalry among unions&quot; in the service sector. Other observers criticised the merger, with IG Metall in particular expressing its concerns that the size of Verdi may cause it to make the DGB &quot;explode&quot;. Critics also feared that the new trade union may force its way into the original areas of responsibility of the industrial unions. The German pilots&#x27; association Vereinigung Cockpit even used the planned merger as an opportunity to end its existing cooperation with the DAG.

In spring 2000, the merger project was brought to a temporary halt after the DAG and HBV adopted different positions on Saturday work at banks. The negotiations on the new Verdi Statute were a particular cause for conflict, so much so that they even resulted in temporary warnings that the major union may fail. Some of the ÖTV rank and file believed that the new trade union did not sufficiently consider their interests and observers believed that the ÖTV may be divided by the Verdi decision. Against this background, IG Medien even went as far as to suggest a merger without the ÖTV if necessary.

In November 2000, the delegates from the DAG, DPG, HBV and IG Medien nevertheless voted in favour of the establishment of Verdi with majorities of between and 78 and 99 percent. The positive outcome of the ÖTV was the weakest with a majority of just 65 percent. Herbert Mai therefore decided not to stand for re-election as the union&#x27;s Chairman. His elected successor, Frank Bsirske, was also in favour of the merger and announced that he additionally planned to run for the role of Verdi Chairman.

The final step towards the establishment of Verdi involved the merger congresses of the five member unions, which took place between 16 and 18 March 2001 and resolved to dissolve the unions with majorities of between 80 and 91 percent. At the subsequent founding congress of Verdi, which was held between 19 and 21 March 2001, the establishment of the trade union was formally completed and Verdi&#x27;s first National Executive Board was elected.

In the same month, Verdi concluded its first collective agreement with Deutsche Lufthansa. A short time later, Verdi was officially accepted into the DGB.

== Organisational structure ==
Verdi&#x27;s highest body is its National Congress (Bundeskongress), which convenes once every four years to stipulate the basic principles of the union policy and to elect and formally approve the actions of the National Executive Board and the Trade Union Council (Gewerkschaftsrat). The trade union itself is divided up into different levels, divisions and groups of individuals. The divisions and groups of individuals have their own organs and committees on a local, district, state and national level. This matrix system was already a controversial decision back when Verdi was founded and problems concerning the management of the trade union continued to be brought to the forefront after its establishment. The matrix system is designed to not only represent the organisation Verdi as a whole, but also the interests of the individual professions of its members. The equal treatment of men and women in all organisational units is stipulated in the Verdi Statute and has been a central topic of the trade union ever since it was first established.

=== The Trade Union Council and National Executive Board ===
Between the National Congresses, the Trade Union Council represents Verdi&#x27;s highest body. The council is composed of representatives from the federal state districts, the divisions and the groups of women, young people and senior citizens. The Trade Union Council monitors compliance with the Verdi Statute, approves the union&#x27;s annual budget and year-end accounts and supervises the National Executive Board.

The National Executive Board is responsible for all activities that are not restricted to the National Congress or the Trade Union Council as stipulated in the Verdi Statute. It is responsible for running Verdi&#x27;s business activities and represents the trade union on an internal and external level. The National Executive Board is composed of a chairman, the Division Managers and up to five further members. The Board currently has nine members.

=== Federal state districts, districts and local levels ===
Verdi&#x27;s smallest regional units are its local districts, which can be formed if several divisions exist on a regional level. These local districts are designed to support and simplify cooperation between members. The next level up from the local level is the union&#x27;s districts throughout Germany, which are in turn subordinate to the federal state districts. These federal state districts decide on the regional structures and dimensions of the districts in mutual agreement, while the federal state districts themselves are set up by the Trade Union Council. Verdi currently has ten federal state districts:

* Baden-Württemberg
* Bavaria
* Berlin-Brandenburg
* Hamburg
* Hesse
* Lower Saxony / Bremen
* North (Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania)
* North Rhine-Westphalia
* Rhineland-Palatinate / Saarland
* Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia

=== Divisions and groups of individuals ===
Verdi&#x27;s divisions are oriented towards the industries and sectors of its members and are responsible for the &quot;tasks involved in the subject-specific representation of member and company-related interests&quot;. The divisions determine their own inner structures and have their own statutes, which must be approved by the Trade Union Council. Verdi currently has five divisions (&quot;Fachbereiche&quot;), formerly 13 divisions:

* A: Financial Services, Communications and Technology, Culture, Utilities and Disposal
* B: Public and Private Services, Social Insurance and Traffic
* C: Health, Social Services, Eduacation and Science
* D: Trade
* E: Postal Services, Shipping Companies and Logistics

Specialist groups and specialist commissions can be formed within the individual divisions to particularly support and promote the specific interests of individual professions.

Alongside the divisions, the Verdi Statute also stipulates that so-called groups of individuals be established on a district, state and national level. Verdi currently has a total of eight groups of individuals:

* Young People
* Senior Citizens
* Workers
* Civil Servants
* Masters, Technicians and Engineers
* Freelance Collaborators and Personally Self-Employed, Freelance or Employee-Like Individuals
* Unemployed Individuals and
* Migrants

The tasks, structure and membership of each group of individuals is regulated by guidelines that are passed by the Trade Union Council based on proposals made by different committees.

=== Membership numbers and structure ===
Verdi&#x27;s total number of members decreased from 2.81 to 2.04 million between 2001 and 2014. One of the reasons behind this decrease is the union&#x27;s competition with rival trade unions such as the physicians&#x27; union Marburger Bund and the pilots&#x27; association Vereinigung Cockpit. According to observers, Verdi is &quot;comparatively good&quot; at recruiting new members but is limited in its success when it comes to establishing loyalty among its members on a long-term basis. In fact, the battle against decreasing interest among employees and women in particular was already an issue even before the merger of the five individual unions in 2001. In 2003, member numbers dropped so low that Verdi was forced to let some of its own staff go. This was, however, also due to the fact that many structures were duplicated in the Verdi administration after the merger. In 2007, the National Congress instructed the executive board to take measures to stop or even reverse the dwindling member numbers. This led to the initiation of the &quot;Chance 2011&quot; (Opportunity 2011) campaign, which was continued in a similar form under the title of &quot;Perspektive 2015&quot; (Prospects for 2015) in 2012. As a result, Verdi representatives were able to refer to an &quot;end to dwindling member numbers&quot; in 2015, at least with regard to Germany&#x27;s new federal states (from the former GDR). Today, it represents 200,000 employees in state and publicly listed banks alone.

Verdi has been running a member network that is open to Verdi members only since December 2008. Alongside member information and online services, the network enables members to get in touch and exchange expertise and experiences in forums. In 2012, a working platform for committees, special interest groups, shop stewards and other individuals actively involved in the running of Verdi was added to the member network. The members of this platform can use it to hold discussions in closed groups, chat and provide information.

== Tasks and objectives ==
=== Collective bargaining policy ===
Verdi is committed to using collective agreements to secure and shape working conditions for employees. In the past, Verdi argued for maintaining collective agreement unity on several occasions, claiming that it supported the assertiveness of staff and the acceptance of collective bargaining. Verdi rejected all attempts to change employees&#x27; right to strike and announced that it planned to take action against corresponding statutory limitations, even by taking cases to the German Federal Constitutional Court. Within the scope of its collective bargaining policy, Verdi particularly focuses on achieving equality between men and women. Gender mainstreaming additionally plays a role when it comes to the composition of the trade union&#x27;s own executive board. Another objective of Verdi&#x27;s collective bargaining policy is to bring wages and pensions in Germany&#x27;s old and new federal states into line.

Verdi&#x27;s collective bargaining policy has above all attracted widespread media attention due to labour disputes in the public service. In 2006, the members of the trade union accepted a new collective agreement for the Public Service of the German Federal States after having previously gone on strike over a period of three months. The Marburger Bund chose to reject the result of the negotiations at the time, leading the media to report that it was &quot;on a collision course&quot; with Verdi. The collective bargaining association between the two trade unions had already been dissolved in the previous year. In 2007, Verdi and the German Civil Service Federation (DBB) launched an advertising campaign costing three million Euros with the motto of &quot;Genug gespart&quot; (Enough saved). The aim of the campaign was to drawn more attention to the work carried out by the public service in the run-up to new collective agreement negotiations. After a wave of warning strikes and several rounds of negotiations, the parties called for conciliation in March 2008. Although this failed, Verdi ultimately agreed on a new collective agreement with the German Federal Government, the German federal states and local authorities. The trade union achieved a wage increase of eight percent, which some observers labelled a heavy burden for the public budgets. Verdi attracted a total of 50,000 new members during the trade dispute. It later managed to repeat that success in similar negotiations in 2018, with an agreement which provides for a cumulative 7.5 per cent increase in salaries over a period of 30 months and includes top-ups and extra payments designed to make the public sector a more attractive employer.

Notably, Verdi held a series of strikes at Deutsche Post in 2015 in a dispute over pay and plans for a new parcel division. Those walkouts, one of which lasted four weeks, cost the firm 100 million euros at the time.

In 2023, airports in the major German cities of Berlin, Bremen, and Hamburg all announced that no flights would depart from the airport on 13 March due to a strike for security staff organized by Verdi over a dispute in pay.

=== Educational services ===
Verdi runs a number of educational centres throughout Germany, all of which aim to support the exchange of experiences and expertise between its members. These services are particularly, but not exclusively, aimed at active works councils. The educational centres are also used as venues for job-related and general further education programmes on a wide variety of different topics. Verdi currently runs educational centres in Berlin, Bielefeld, Brannenburg, Gladenbach, Mosbach, Naumburg (Hesse), Saalfeld, Undeloh and Walsrode. It closed its site in Hörste at the end of 2015 and the building is now being used as a home for refugees.

Alongside the educational centres specified above, there are also a number of independent ver.di educational institutes that were taken over from the former German Union of Salaried Employees (DAG) in several federal states.

; ver.di Bildung + Beratung Gemeinnützige GmbH
ver.di Bildung + Beratung, known as ver.di b+b for short, is Verdi&#x27;s educational institution that operates throughout Germany. It is responsible for running seminars for statutory special interest groups, namely works council, staff council and Youth and Trainees Council (JAV) members, as well as members of representative bodies for disabled employees and employee representation committees. ver.di b+b has been examined and certified by the independent institute for &quot;Learner-Oriented Quality Testing in Further Education and Training&quot; (Lernerorientierte Qualitätstestierung in der Weiterbildung).

ver.di b+b also works as a book publishing house and publishes guidebooks, work guides and legal commentaries.

The company&#x27;s head office is based in the German city of Düsseldorf. ver.di b+b is represented in 25 locations throughout Germany.

Its subsidiary &quot;Rat.geber GmbH&quot; advises boards and committees and runs the public bookshop at Verdi&#x27;s administrative headquarters in Berlin.

=== International memberships ===
Verdi is a member of multiple global union federations such as the UNI Global Union, the International Transport Workers&#x27; Federation, the International Graphical Federation, the International Federation of Journalists and the Public Services International and several European trade union federations, namely EPSU. It is also a member of the European Movement Germany (EBD) and a partner of the Tax Justice Network.

== Publications ==
Verdi publishes a multitude of different magazines for its members. All members receive the magazine &quot;Verdi Publik&quot; for free eight times a year. Other Verdi publications include the media policy magazine &quot;M – Menschen Machen Medien&quot; (M – People Make Media), which, like the publications &quot;Druck + Papier&quot; (Printing + Paper) and &quot;Kunst + Kultur&quot; (Art + Culture), is published by the National Executive Board and the Media, Art and Industry division.

== Criticism ==
Ever since Verdi was first founded, its complex organisational structure has repeatedly been the subject of criticism: In as early as 2001, for example, the German daily newspaper &quot;Der Tagesspiegel&quot; warned readers about the threat of &quot;losses and inefficiency due to friction&quot;. The Sunday newspaper &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot; also reported on &quot;frictions and budget disputes&quot; within the trade union. The daily newspaper &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot; claimed that Verdi&#x27;s matrix model was &quot;so complicated&quot; that even full-time Verdi employees &quot;had a hard time&quot; explaining it. The weekly news magazine &quot;Stern&quot; also reported on Verdi, stating that its divisions, state associations and districts &quot;worked against each other more than with one another&quot;. On top of these media reports, Verdi&#x27;s organisation structure also received criticism from within its own ranks time and time again, so much so that a response to this criticism was factored into the &quot;Perspektive 2015&quot; initiative.

Critics also accused Verdi of taking a strong stand in favour of employee rights and fair wages in public but not aiming to achieve these goals on an internal level. One example was the canteen at Verdi&#x27;s headquarters in Berlin, which was operated by the international catering company Sodexo. As is typical of the industry, Sodexo does not conclude industrial collective agreements but instead uses collective agreements on a company level. According to information presented by the &quot;Neue Ruhr Zeitung&quot; newspaper, the wages of employees at the German Employee Academy (DAA), which is closely linked to Verdi, were below the rate that Verdi had negotiated with rivals such as the charitable organisations or Diakonie. Verdi&#x27;s actions during strikes are also constantly the subject of criticism, with some reports claiming that in individual cases, employees have been forced to strike, which the trade union denied. Critics have also labelled several strikes organised by Verdi as out of proportion.

<text>Santa Maria delle Grazie (&quot;Holy Mary of Grace&quot;) is a church and Dominican convent in Milan, northern Italy, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The convent contains the mural of &quot;The Last Supper&quot; by Leonardo da Vinci, which is in the refectory.

==History==

Duke of Milan Francesco I Sforza ordered the construction of a Dominican convent and church at the site of a prior chapel dedicated to the Marian devotion of St Mary of the Graces. The main architect, Guiniforte Solari, designed the convent (the Gothic nave), which was completed by 1469. Construction of the church took decades. Duke Ludovico Sforza decided to have the church serve as the Sforza family burial site, and rebuilt the cloister and the apse, both completed after 1490. Ludovico&#x27;s wife Beatrice was buried in the church in 1497.

The design of the apse of the church has been attributed to Donato Bramante, as his name is inscribed in a piece of marble in the church vaults delivered in 1494. However, some dispute that he worked on the church at all. According to one source, in 1492–1497 Bramante worked on the crossing and the dome as well the transept apses and the coir with apse; this source also attributes a plan and section of the building to Bramante. Some documents mention the name Amadeo, likely Giovanni Antonio Amadeo. There are similarities between this church and Amadeo&#x27;s design for Santa Maria alla Fontana.

In 1543, the Titian altarpiece depicting Christ receiving the crown of thorns was installed in the Chapel of the Holy Crown, located on the right of the nave. The painting, looted by French troops in 1797, is now in the Louvre. This chapel is frescoed with &quot;Stories of the Passion&quot; by Gaudenzio Ferrari. In the small cloister adjacent to the tribune near the door that leads to the sacristy is a fresco by Bramantino. The church also contained frescoes depicting the &quot;Resurrection and Passion&quot; by Bernardo Zenale.

Composer and cellist Giovanni Perroni served as maestro di cappella at the cathedral from 1718–1720.

==World War II==

During World War II, on the night of 15 August 1943, an allied aerial bombardment hit the church and the convent. Much of the refectory was destroyed, but some walls survived, including the one that holds &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, which had been sand-bagged in order to protect it. Some preservation works are done to maintain it for the future. Previously distorted by attempts at restoration carried out over the centuries, Leonardo’s original painting has now emerged as a result of the work begun in 1978 and completed in 1999. This involved addressing complex problems as regards not only the painting itself but also the environment of the refectory in order to protect the work from the dust, fumes and humidity identified as the primary causes of its constant deterioration. It is believed that the current and future preservation works will keep the painting safe for many centuries to come.

==Contemporary ==
Nowadays the &quot;Sacrestia vecchia&quot;, or the Old Sacristy, designed and constructed by Donato Bramante, is the seat of a Dominican Cultural Centre (&quot;Centro Culturale alle Grazie&quot;), in which the brethren organize and host conferences on various themes pertaining to spirituality, philosophy, art, literature and sociology, in addition to musical concerts and artistic exhibitions.

<doc id="1052263" wikidata="Q1348305" url="?curid=1052263" title="Erratum">
<text>An erratum or corrigendum (: errata, corrigenda) (comes from ) is a correction of a published text. Generally, publishers issue an erratum for a production error (i.e., an error introduced during the publishing process) and a corrigendum for an author&#x27;s error. It is usually bound into the back of a book, but for a single error a slip of paper detailing a corrigendum may be bound in before or after the page on which the error appears. An erratum may also be issued shortly after its original text is published.

==Etymology==
Corrigendum is the gerundive form of the Latin compound verb &quot;corrigo -rexi -rectum&quot; (from the verb &quot;rego&quot;, &quot;to make straight, rule&quot;, plus the preposition &quot;cum&quot;, &quot;with&quot;), &quot;to correct&quot;, and thus signifies &quot;(those things) which must be corrected&quot; and in its single form &quot;Corrigendum&quot; it means &quot;(that thing) which must be corrected&quot;.

==Errata sheets==
According to the &quot;Chicago Manual of Style&quot;, &quot;Errata, lists of errors and their corrections, may take the form of loose, inserted sheets or bound-in pages. An errata sheet is definitely not a usual part of a book. It should never be supplied to correct simple typographical errors (which may be rectified in a later printing) or to insert additions to, or revisions of, the printed text (which should wait for the next edition of the book). It is a device to be used only in extreme cases where errors severe enough to cause misunderstanding are detected too late to correct in the normal way but before the finished book is distributed. Then the errors may be listed with their locations and their corrections on a sheet that is tipped in, either before or after the book is bound, or laid in loose, usually inside the front cover of the book. (Tipping and inserting must be done by hand, thus adding considerably to the cost of the book.)&quot;

== Errata associated with integrated circuits ==
Design errors and mistakes in a microprocessor&#x27;s hardwired logic may also be documented and described as errata. One well-publicized example is Intel&#x27;s &quot;FDIV&quot; erratum in early Pentium processors, known as the Pentium FDIV bug. This gave incorrect answers to a floating-point division instruction (FDIV) for a small set of numbers, due to an incorrect lookup table inside the Pentium chip.

Similarly, design errors in peripheral devices, such as disk controllers and video display units, can result in abnormal operation under certain conditions.

<doc id="1052266" wikidata="Q531721" url="?curid=1052266" title="Philip Webb">
<text>Philip Speakman Webb (12 January 1831 – 17 April 1915) was a British architect and designer sometimes called the Father of Arts and Crafts Architecture. His use of vernacular architecture demonstrated his commitment to &quot;the art of common building.&quot; William Morris, Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti were his business partners and he designed many notable buildings including one for Morris. He co-founded the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings.

==Biography==
Born in Oxford, Webb studied at Aynho in Northamptonshire and was then articled to firms of builder-architects in Wolverhampton and Reading, Berkshire. He then moved to London where he eventually became a junior assistant to the architect George Edmund Street. While there he met William Morris in 1856 and then started his own practice in 1858.
He is particularly noted as the designer of the Red House at Bexleyheath, south-east London in 1859 for William Morris, and – towards the end of his career – the house Standen (near East Grinstead in West Sussex). These were among several works in his favoured niche: country houses. A Greater London Council blue plaque commemorates both Webb and Morris at the Red House.

William Morris, Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti were three of his partners in the interior decorating and furnishing business, Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co., later to become Morris &amp; Co.

Webb and Morris formed an important part of the Arts and Crafts movement, and founded the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings in 1877. With Morris, Webb wrote the SPAB Manifesto, one of the key documents in the history of building conservation. He attended over 700 SPAB Committee meetings as well as undertaking numerous site visits. Webb also joined Morris&#x27;s revolutionary Socialist League, becoming its treasurer.

George Howard of Naworth Castle near Brampton in Cumbria was an able artist and friend of the Pre-Raphaelites, and a keen patron of Philip Webb. Webb had built two houses for his Naworth Castle Estate: Four Gables and Green Lane House, as well as his London house at 1 Palace Green. Much financial help was offered by Charles Howard MP (George Howard&#x27;s father) towards building a new church in Brampton on condition that he chose the architect. Webb&#x27;s plan for St Martin&#x27;s Church is quite unlike most other Victorian churches, with the body of the church being almost square. It is the only church designed by Webb, and contains an exquisite set of stained glass windows designed by Burne-Jones, and executed in the William Morris studio.

His friendship with the family of Sir Thomas Hugh Bell, a leading ironfounder of Middlesbrough, led to three commissions: Rounton Grange (demolished in 1953), Red Barns House in 1868, in which Gertrude Bell lived as a child, and the Bell Brothers office building in Middlesbrough (his only commercial development; later to be the Dorman Long offices). An additional commission in the Cleveland area was Briarmead, completed in 1883, located north of Greatham village, near Hartlepool. The adjoining St Francis Cottage was completed by W.F. Linton (Middlesbrough) in 1895 in the style of Webb.

In 1901 Philip Webb retired to the country and ceased practising. He continued to be an influence on the &quot;school of rational builders&quot; surrounding William Lethaby, and Ernest Gimson and his community of architect-craftsmen based at Sapperton in Gloucestershire. Between 1902 and 1903, Webb contributed to the design and manufacture of the University of Birmingham&#x27;s ceremonial mace.

<text>Brickell station is a Metrorail rapid transit station in Miami, Florida, serving the system&#x27;s Green and Orange Lines. One of the core stations of Miami&#x27;s public transport network, it serves the financial district of Brickell. Combined, the Metrorail and Metromover station complex at Brickell sees roughly 8,430 boardings each weekday, making it the system&#x27;s second-busiest station.

==Location==

The Brickell station is located in the median of SW 1st Avenue at its intersection with SW 11th Street in the central Miami neighborhood of Brickell. Excluding nearby Metromover stations, it is the closest rail stop to attractions such as Brickell Key, Mary Brickell Village, Brickell Avenue and Simpson Park.

===Transit-oriented development===
Like other rail stations in Miami&#x27;s central business district, Brickell has been the focal point for significant transit-oriented development (TOD), particularly in the real estate boom of the 2000s and 2010s. New developments such as Axis at Brickell Village, Infinity at Brickell and Plaza on Brickell are all within a short distance of the station, as are numerous other residential and commercial projects. Once considered a failed example of TOD, and referred to as only &quot;transit-adjacent development&quot;, over the past few years Brickell (Metromover) ridership has risen from approximately fifth place to as high as second place for some months in 2015 and 2016. Metrorail ridership growth at this station also outpaced most other stations, and by June 2016, it was the second highest ridership station on the Metrorail as well amid heavy losses at some stations, namely Dadeland South and Dadeland North.

==History==

One of the original Metrorail stations, Brickell opened along with the initial stretch of the system from Dadeland South to Historic Overtown/Lyric Theatre, then called &quot;Overtown.&quot; The Metromover station opened ten years later on May 26, 1994.

It featured as a level in the videogame Hotline Miami.

==Station layout==
The Metrorail station and Metromover station are located next to each other and are connected by an overhang. The Metrorail station can hold up to six cars and has a canopy covering most of the platform. The Metromover platform can hold up to two Metromover cars and is completely covered.

<doc id="1052290" wikidata="Q1185591" url="?curid=1052290" title="Newton OS">
<text>Newton OS is a discontinued operating system for the Apple Newton PDAs produced by Apple Computer, Inc. between 1993 and 1997. It was written entirely in C++ and trimmed to be low power consuming and use the available memory efficiently. Many applications were pre-installed in the ROM of the Newton (making for quick start-up) to save on RAM and flash memory storage for user applications.

==Features==
Newton OS features many interface elements that the Macintosh system software didn&#x27;t have at the time, such as drawers and the &quot;poof&quot; animation. An animation similar to this is found in Mac OS X, and parts of the Newton&#x27;s handwriting recognition system have been implemented as Inkwell in Mac OS X.

*Sound responsive — Clicking menus and icons makes a sound; this feature was later introduced in Mac OS 8.
*Icons - Similar to the Macintosh Desktop metaphor, Newton OS uses icons to open applications.
*Tabbed documents — Similar to tabbed browsing in today&#x27;s browsers and Apple&#x27;s At Ease interface, documents titles appear in a small tab at the top right hand of the screen.
*Screen rotation — In Newton 2.0, the screen can be rotated to be used for drawing or word processing.
*File documents — Notes and Drawings can be categorized. E.g. Fun, Business, Personal, etc.
*Print documents — Documents on the Newton can be printed.
*Send documents — Documents can be sent to another Newton via Infrared technology or sent using the Internet by E-Mail, or faxed.
*Menus — Similar to menus seen in Mac OS, but menu titles are instead presented at the bottom of the screen in small rectangles, making them similar to buttons with attached &quot;pop-up&quot; menus.

Many features of the Newton are best appreciated in the context of the history of Pen computing.

==Software==
Shortly after the Newton PDA&#x27;s release in 1993, developers were not paying much attention to the new Newton OS API and were still more interested in developing for the Macintosh and Windows platforms. It was not until two years later that developers saw a potential market available to them in creating software for Newton OS. Several programs were made by third-party developers, including software to enhance the disappointing hand writing recognition technology of Newton OS 1.x.

The basic software that came with Newton OS:

*Works — A program for drawing and word processing, with typical capabilities such as: rulers, margins, page breaks, formatting, printing, spell checking and find &amp; replace tools.
*Notes — Used for checklists, as well as both drawing and writing in the same program either with a newton keyboard or a stylus pen.
*Dates — Calendar program where you can schedule appointments and other special events.
*Names — Program for storing extensive contacts information in a flexible format.
*Formulas — Program that offers metric conversions, currency conversions, loan and mortgage calculators, etc.
*Calculator — A basic calculator with square root, percentage, MR, M+ and M− functions additional to the basic functions found on a calculator.
*Clock — A small floating window type application, known as a desktop accessory on the Macintosh. The Newton clock also includes features for an alarm, minute timer and the date.
*Book Reader — Support for displaying electronic books is built in.

==Version history==
==Handwriting recognition==
The Newton uses the CalliGrapher word-based handwriting recognition engine developed by ParaGraph International Inc, led by former Soviet scientist Stepan Pachikov.

The earliest versions had weaknesses that resulted in bad publicity and reviews. However, with the release of Newton PDAs based upon version 2.0 of the OS, the handwriting recognition substantially improved, partially being a product of ParaGraph and an Apple-created recognizer pair: Apple&#x27;s Rosetta and Mondello. Newton&#x27;s handwriting recognition, particularly the print recognizer, has been considered by many reviewers, testers, and users to be the best in the industry, even 10 years after it was introduced. It was developed by Apple&#x27;s Advanced Technology Group, and was described in 2012 as &quot;the world&#x27;s first genuinely usable handwriting recognition system&quot;.

The Newton can recognize hand-printed text, cursive, or a mix of the two, and can also accept free-hand &quot;Sketches&quot;, &quot;Shapes&quot;, and &quot;ink text&quot;. Text can also be entered by tapping with the stylus on a small on-screen pop-up QWERTY keyboard. With &quot;Shapes&quot;, Newton can recognize that the user was attempting to draw a circle, a line, a polygon, etc., and it cleans them up into &quot;perfect&quot; vector representations (with modifiable control points and defined vertices) of what the user is attempting to draw. &quot;Shapes&quot; and &quot;Sketches&quot; can be scaled or deformed once drawn. &quot;Ink text&quot; captures the user&#x27;s free-hand writing but allows it to be treated somewhat like recognized text when manipulating for later editing purposes (&quot;ink text&quot; supported word wrap, could be formatted to be bold, italic, etc.). At any time a user can also direct the Newton to recognize selected &quot;ink text&quot; and turn it into recognized text (deferred recognition). A Newton Note document (or the notes attached to each contact in Names and each calendar event) can contain any mix of interleaved text, ink text, Shapes, and Sketches.

==NewtonScript==
Newton OS runs applications written in C++, along with an interpreted, user-friendly language called &quot;NewtonScript&quot;. These applications are stored in packages.

<text>God&#x27;s Playground: A History of Poland is a history book in two volumes written by Norman Davies, covering a 1000-year history of Poland. Volume 1: &quot;The origins to 1795&quot;, and Volume 2: &quot;1795 to the present&quot; first appeared as the Oxford Clarendon Press publication in 1981 and have since been reprinted in multiple times, and translated into Polish as &quot;Boże igrzysko : Historia Polski&quot; by Elżbieta Tabakowska (2 volumes in 1, with 1183 pages by Znak Publishers of Kraków). Davies was inspired to the title by Jan Kochanowski&#x27;s 1580s poem &quot;Boże igrzysko&quot; (&quot;Mankind: Bauble of the Gods&quot;).

The book, which most editions split into two volumes, has received favourable reviews in the international press, and is considered by many historians and other scholars to be one of the best English-language books on the subject of the history of Poland. The author received several Polish honours.
