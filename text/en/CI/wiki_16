<text>The Punters Club is a pub and live music venue located on Brunswick Street, Fitzroy, in inner Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

During its original run as the Punters Club, it developed a reputation as one of the city&#x27;s premier live music venues, drawing comparisons to the likes of New York&#x27;s CBGB. It was also noted for its rough, alternative, yet casual atmosphere with audiences sometimes sitting on the floor while watching bands.

==History==
=== Prehistory and rebranding (1863-1993) ===
The building was constructed between 1863 and 1865, and was originally known as the Wheatsheaf Hotel. In 1893, the venue rebranded as the Moonee Valley Hotel.

In 1987, Rob Guerini and Ric DiPietro became the new owners of the Moonee Valley Hotel, and the venue was renamed to the Punters Club Hotel. The new owners began to promote the hotel as a live music venue. It played a broad and eclectic range of music, such as rock, indie rock, electronica, nu country, lo-fi, metal, Celtic and ska. The venue helped launch the careers of a number of successful Australian bands, including Frente!, Magic Dirt, Something for Kate, Spiderbait and You Am I.

=== Matt Everett&#x27;s ownership and closure (1993-2002) ===
Mat Everett took over the Club in 1993 and operated it for the remainder of its life.

From 1995, the Punters Club nurtured a close relationship with local purveyors of live electronic music, such as IF? Records (with their Zoetrope (sessions) and Clan Analogue, and regularly played host to live acts like Zen Paradox, Little Nobody, Artificial, Andrez Bergen, Voiteck, TR-Storm, Blimp, Son Of Zev, Isnod, Soulenoid, Guyver 3, Frontside, Half Yellow, and Honeysmack.

During the late 1990s Brunswick Street began to change, with a number of more mainstream establishments replacing what had been a much more alternative area. This resulted in a significant increase in property rents all along the strip, and when the Punters Club&#x27;s lease came up for renewal in 2002, Everett saw continuing as unsustainable. The club closed its doors on 17 February 2002, with a twelve-hour music marathon that featured Gaslight Radio, Rocket Science, Pre-Shrunk, TISM and The Beat End Profilers.

=== Bimbo Deluxe and reunions (2002-2018) ===
The venue later became a pizza bar, Bimbo Deluxe. After a two-year hunt for another venue, Everett bought the Commercial Hotel in High Street, Northcote—an area that was developing a similar atmosphere to that of Brunswick Street in the 1980s. In late 2004 he reopened the venue as the Northcote Social Club, which maintains a very similar nature, bands and clientele to that of the Punters Club.

Melbourne band The Lucksmiths wrote a song entitled &quot;Requiem for the Punters Club&quot; as a tribute to the venue.

On 27 and 28 November 2010, Punters Club reunion gigs were held at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne, featuring bands such as Spiderbait, Hoss, Guttersnipes, The Glory Box, Frente!, The Fauves and The Hollowmen.

=== Upstairs fire, Kewpie and new Punters Club (2018-present) ===
Bimbo Deluxe suffered a fire in the upstairs level in May 2018. It was reopened that August, and continued until closing down in 2020 due to COVID-19. In November 2021, Kewpie Nightclub opened in the premises and operated until abruptly closing in mid-2024. 

On 2 July 2024, it was announced that the building had been purchased by new owners, aiming to restore the former &quot;Punters Club&quot; name to the complex and create a space paying tribute to Australia&#x27;s 90s music scene, while restoring the exterior of the building to match the venue&#x27;s appearance in the 1990s. Two days later, the new owners were revealed to be a consortium composed of Jet bassist Mark Wilson and several prominent Melbourne pub owners. It was also stated that a new bandroom would be opened on the upstairs level of the venue.

On 20 August 2024, it was announced that Frente! would be performing at the reopened club on the 31st. The venue opened on the 22nd.

<doc id="1048377" wikidata="Q7889837" url="?curid=1048377" title="United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois">
<text>The United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois (in case citations, S.D. Ill.) is a federal district court covering approximately the southern third of the state of Illinois.

Appeals from the Southern District of Illinois are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).

It has three courthouses, at Benton, Cairo, and East St. Louis. At present, four judges are assigned to this district.

== History ==
 The United States District Court for the District of Illinois was established by a statute passed by the United States Congress on March 3, 1819, . The act established a single office for a judge to preside over the court. Initially, the court was not within any existing judicial circuit, so the district court exercised the jurisdiction of both a district court and a circuit court, with appeals and writs of error taken directly to the United States Supreme Court. In 1837, Congress placed the District of Illinois within the newly created Seventh Circuit, and the district court resumed its normal jurisdiction, .

The Southern District itself was created by a statute passed on February 13, 1855, , which subdivided the District of Illinois into the Northern and the Southern Districts. The boundaries of the District and the seats of the courts were set forth in the statute: 

The district has since been re-organized several times. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Illinois was created on March 3, 1905 by , by splitting counties out of the Northern and Southern Districts. It was later eliminated in a reorganization on October 2, 1978 which replaced it with a Central District, , formed primarily from parts of the Southern District, and returning some counties to the Northern District.

== Jurisdiction ==
The jurisdiction of the Southern District of Illinois comprises the following counties: Alexander, Bond, Calhoun, Clark, Clay, Clinton, Crawford, Cumberland, Edwards, Effingham, Fayette, Franklin, Gallatin, Hamilton, Hardin, Jackson, Jasper, Jefferson, Jersey, Johnson, Lawrence, Madison, Marion, Massac, Monroe, Perry, Pope, Pulaski, Randolph, Richland, Saline, St. Clair, Union, Wabash, Washington, Wayne, White, and Williamson. The district was created in 1979. It has jurisdiction over the eastern suburbs of St. Louis and the city of Carbondale.

The United States Attorney&#x27;s Office for the Southern District of Illinois represents the United States in civil and criminal litigation in the court. The current United States Attorney is Rachelle Crowe, who was sworn in on June 21, 2022.

<doc id="1048388" wikidata="Q832105" url="?curid=1048388" title="Hot Shots!">
<text>Hot Shots! is a 1991 American comedy film directed by Jim Abrahams, co-writer and co-director of &quot;Airplane!&quot;, and written by Abrahams and Pat Proft. It stars Charlie Sheen, Cary Elwes, Valeria Golino, Lloyd Bridges, Jon Cryer, Kevin Dunn, Kristy Swanson, Bill Irwin, and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. The film is primarily a parody of &quot;Top Gun&quot;, with some scenes spoofing other popular films, including &quot;9½ Weeks&quot;, &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot;, &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;, &quot;Marathon Man&quot;, &quot;Rocky&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. A sequel, &quot;Hot Shots! Part Deux&quot;, was released in 1993, with Sheen, Golino, Bridges and Jerry Haleva reprising their roles.

== Plot ==
The film begins at Flemner Air Base 20 years in the past. A pilot named Leland &quot;Buzz&quot; Harley loses control of his plane and ejects, leaving his co-pilot Dominic &quot;Mailman&quot; Farnham to crash. Although Mailman survives, he is mistaken for a deer owing to the branches stuck to his helmet and is shot by a hunter.

Topper Harley wakes up from a nightmare he is having about the event when Lt. Commander Block asks him to return to active duty as a pilot in the U.S. Navy, to help on a new top secret mission: Operation Sleepy Weasel, commanded by the senile and accident-prone Admiral Benson. Harley experiences intense psychological problems, especially when his father is mentioned. His therapist, Ramada, tries to stop Topper from flying, but she relents, and also starts to fall in love with him. Meanwhile, Topper gets into a feud with another fighter pilot, Kent Gregory, Mailman&#x27;s son and a former boyfriend of Ramada, who blames Buzz Harley for his father&#x27;s death and believes Topper is dangerous.

Block starts privately meeting with an airplane tycoon, Mr. Wilson, who has recently built a new &quot;Super Fighter&quot; that will make the American pilots superior. Block reveals that he brought back Topper for the reason of making Sleepy Weasel fail. Block would then report that it was the Navy&#x27;s planes that were the real reason for the mission failure and that they need to be replaced with Wilson&#x27;s planes. During one of the last training missions, an accident between Pete &quot;Dead Meat&quot; Thompson and Jim &quot;Wash Out&quot; Pfaffenbach leaves Dead Meat killed and Wash Out demoted to radar operator. Block believes this is enough to convince the Navy to buy new fighters, but Wilson calls it a &quot;minor incident&quot;, saying the planes need to fail in combat.

Topper develops a strong emotional attachment to Ramada, but she is haunted by her past with Gregory. On the carrier S.S. &quot;Essess&quot;, Benson reveals the mission to be an attack of an Iraqi nuclear plant and Block assigns Topper to lead the mission, much to Gregory&#x27;s protest. Wilson, who is also on board, instructs a crew member to sabotage the planes, putting the pilots&#x27; lives at risk. In the midst of the mission, Block mentions Buzz Harley to Topper, who has a panic attack and is unable to lead. Block just starts to call out for the mission to be aborted when Iraqi fighters attack the squadron. All the planes&#x27; weapons fail, and Block, realizing what has happened, tells Topper that he saw what really happened with Buzz and Mailman: That Buzz tried to do everything possible to save Mailman, but ended up falling out of the plane, failing in his attempts.

With his self-confidence restored, Topper single-handedly beats the Iraqi fighters and bombs the nuclear plant, dropping a bomb directly on Saddam Hussein. Back aboard the ship, Wilson&#x27;s plan is revealed, and his standing with the military is lost. Back in port, Gregory hails Topper as a great pilot and gives his blessing to Ramada to be with Topper. The end credits show Dead Meat and Mailman in spirit with Dead Meat saluting and Mailman giving a thumbs up with Elvis Presley (who was mentioned earlier in the film).

The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Hot Shots!&quot; hits most of its parodic targets with aplomb, excelling as a daffy good time thanks to inspired gags and Charlie Sheen&#x27;s crack comedic timing&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale. The film was chosen for the 1991 Royal Film Performance.

<doc id="1048389" wikidata="Q6039151" url="?curid=1048389" title="Pirbright Institute">
<text>The Pirbright Institute (formerly the Institute for Animal Health) is a research institute in Surrey, England, dedicated to the study of infectious diseases of farm animals. It forms part of the UK government&#x27;s Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). The institute employs scientists, vets, PhD students, and operations staff.

==History==
It began in 1914 to test cows for tuberculosis. More buildings were added in 1925. Compton was established by the Agricultural Research Council in 1937. Pirbright became a research institute in 1939 and Compton in 1942. The Houghton Poultry Research Station at Houghton, Cambridgeshire was established in 1948. In 1963 Pirbright became the Animal Virus Research Institute and Compton became the Institute for Research on Animal Diseases. The Neuropathogenesis Unit (NPU) was established in Edinburgh in 1981. This became part of the Roslin Institute in 2007.

In 1987, Compton, Houghton and Pirbright became the &quot;Institute for Animal Health&quot;, being funded by BBSRC. Houghton closed in 1992, operations at Compton ended in 2015.
The Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research was sited at Compton until October 2005, when it merged with the vaccine programmes of the University of Oxford and the Institute for Animal Health.

The Pirbright site was implicated in the 2007 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak, with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) concluding that a local case of the disease was a result of contaminated effluent release either from the Pirbright Institute or the neighbouring Merial Animal Health laboratory.

Significant investment (over £170 million) took place at Pirbright with the development of new world-class laboratory and animal facilities. The institute has been known as &quot;The Pirbright Institute&quot; since October 2012.

On 14 June 2019 the largest stock of the rinderpest virus was destroyed at the Pirbright Institute.

==Directors of note==

* John Burns Brooksby 1964 until 1980

==Structure==
The work previously carried out at Compton has either moved out to the university sector, ended or has been transferred to the Pirbright site. The Compton site currently carries out work on endemic (commonplace) animal diseases including some avian viruses and a small amount of bovine immunology whilst Pirbright works on exotic (unusual) animal diseases (usually caused by virus outbreaks). Pirbright has national and international reference laboratories of diseases. It is a biosafety level 4 laboratories (commonly referred to as &quot;P4&quot; or BSL-4).

===Funding===
25% of its income comes from a core grant from the BBSRC of around £11 million. Around 50% comes from research grants from related government organisations, such as DEFRA, or industry and charities (such as the Wellcome Trust). The remaining 25% comes from direct payments for work carried out.

The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has provided funding to the institute for research into veterinary infectious diseases and universal flu vaccine development.

==Function==
The Pirbright Institute carries out research, diagnostics and surveillance of viruses carried predominantly by farm animals, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), African swine fever, bluetongue, lumpy skin disease and avian and swine flu. Understanding of viruses comes from molecular biology.

It carries out surveillance activities on farm animal health and disease movement in the UK.

== Services ==

* Arthropod supplies
* Diagnostics &amp; Surveillance
* Disinfectant testing
* Flow cytometry &amp; cell sorting
* Products – Includes positive sera, inactived antigens, diagnostic kits, viral cultures and live midges.
* Training courses

== Location ==
The institute had two sites:
* Compton in Berkshire – closed in August 2015 with services relocated to new facilities at Pirbright.
* Pirbright in Surrey – shared with commercial company Merial

<doc id="1048393" wikidata="Q3573082" url="?curid=1048393" title="Yuen Kay-shan">
<text>Yuen Kay-shan (), nicknamed Yuen Lo-jia () was a Grandmaster of Wing Chun. The youngest of five brothers, he became known as &quot;Foshan Yuen Lo-jia&quot; (Yuen the Fifth of Foshan).

 He was the fifth child of wealthy firework monopoly owner Yuen Chong Ming, and was known as an undefeated champion of 1000 death duels during the 1920-1950s representing the Wing Chun.

==Wing Chun studies==
Yuen&#x27;s family ancestral estate home was named Song Yuen (Mulberry Gardens), and located in Foshan, China. Initially, Kay-shan&#x27;s father paid for him and his older brother Yuen Chai-wan to become students of Fok Bo-Chuen (; also transliterated &quot;Kwok Bo-chuen&quot;).Wong Wah-bo and &quot;Dai Fa Min&quot; Kam from the Red Boat Opera Company also taught Yuen Kay-shan.

Yuen Kay-shan and his older brother Yuen Chai-wan had developed an interest in the martial arts. Yuen Kay-shan&#x27;s older brother Yuen Chai-wan was known as &quot;Pock Skin Chai&quot; and later became the founder of Yiu Choi and Vietnamese Branches of Wing Chun. Their father Yuen Chong Ming housed and paid a large sum of money to imperial constable Fok Bo Chuen to teach both of the Yuen brothers Wing Chun. From Fok Bo-chuen, Yuen learned all the extensive open hand patterns in Wing Chun, he structured them into and created three forms, Siu Lien Tau, Chum Kiu and the Biu Jee. In addition he mastered the knives, six and a half point pole and the flying darts. He had also been taught the Wooden Dummy, Bamboo Dummy and several different jong variations, as well as Red Sand Palm.

Later, Ma Bok-Leung, Jiu Gan-Heung, Lo Hao-Po, Ng Ngau Si, Leung Yan as well as Yuen Kay-shan and his brother, invited Fung Siu-Ching to come and teach. Fung stayed at the Yuen ancestral home, where the two brothers combined the teachings of their past and present teacher. From Fung Siu Ching they learned his skills in close body applications which included the kum Na, Fa Kum Na, body wrapping, sweeping, breaking and throwing skills. Fung Siu Chiong was a disciple of red boat master Dai Fai Min Kam. The Yuens cared for Fung Siu Ching until his death in 1936. 1936 also marked the year when Yuen Kay-shan and Yuen Chai-wan had gone their separate ways. Yuen&#x27;s brother eventually was invited to teach in Vietnam, where he founded the Nguyễn Tế-Công branch (Vietnam WingChun 永春) branch of the art. Yuen Kay-shan remained in Foshan, where he became friends with other Wing Chun notables like Ip Man, Yiu Choi, Yip Chung Hong, Lai Hip Chi, Tong Gai and others. Yuen Kay-shan became close enough with Yip Man that he taught Yip&#x27;s son, Yip Chun, the first form of the art.

In addition to having a high caliber skill in Wing Chun, Yuen Kay-shan had also been an educated man who had worked as a part-time lawyer. By being an educated individual he was also one of the first Wing Chun masters to document the theories, concepts, philosophies and strategies of the system. He is also considered a major contributor to luk dim boon gwun and had at one point was even challenged by a monk from Jianxi Province. Death waivers had been signed and the duel took place in the Palace of 1000 years longevity. Both fighters were armed with iron poles. Yuen Kay-shan disarmed the monk and spared his life in the duel, not only demonstrating his skills in kung fu but also demonstrating his nobility as a martial artist. Yuen Kay-shan never looked for fights, but when challenges could not be avoided, he took them as learning opportunities. Of the 1000 death duels Yuen Kay-shan fought in, he was never defeated.

Yuen&#x27;s disciple Sum Nung initially didn&#x27;t believe he could learn anything from Yuen, because he was already proficient with the Wing Chun he had learnt from Cheung Bo. As a test Yuen placed a raw egg in each of his two pockets and challenged Sum to break an egg while he stood in the middle of a circle on the ground. Sam could not break an egg or even push Yuen out of the circle; this convinced Sum that he could learn a lot from Yuen and he became Yuen&#x27;s disciple.

==Ip Man movie controversy==

Sin Kwok-lam (Ip Man&#x27;s son&#x27;s student and producer) apologized and served tea to Yuen Jo Tong for misrepresenting his grandfather Yuen Kay-shan&#x27;s reputation and status in Wing Chun history. (In the movie, Yuen was portrayed as Ip Man&#x27;s younger kung fu brother, not as skillful as Ip Man). This had the Yuen and Yiu families criticize the movie in interviews. After the Yuen and Yiu families voiced their displeasure about Yuen&#x27;s portrayal in the movie on Ip Man, movie producer Kwok Si-lam and co-producer Ip Chun apologized six times and &quot;served tea&quot; to Yuen Kay-san&#x27;s grandson, Yuen Jo Tong, for misrepresenting, and being disrespectful to, the legendary 1000 death duel champion during the 1920-1950s, Yuen Kay-shan.

==Three Heroes of Wing Chun==
Yao Wing Ken (Yoa Choy&#x27;s grandson) explains that, &quot;in the old days of Foshan, his grandfather Yao Choy, Ip Man and Yuen Kay-shan were called the &quot;Three Heroes of Wing Chun&quot; and often mentioned together. Yuen Kay-shan&#x27;s disciple Leung Jan Sing also provided an ancestral document indicating that Yuen studied with Fung Siu-ching, while Ip Man and others studied under Yuen. This record was passed down in the 1970s. Although Ip Man is not necessarily Yuen&#x27;s official student, in the order of seniority on the family tree, Yuen ranked at the first level, with Ip Man being last. It would be normal for Ip Man to ask Yuen Kay-shan for instruction.

Below is the original Chinese quoted from the original article in the Dayoo Newspaper of Guangzhou:

　　“咏春三雄”齐名
　 　姚永强介绍，当年在佛山，他的爷爷姚才与叶问、阮奇山并称“咏春三雄”，三人齐名，武功不相上下。阮奇山的徒孙梁湛声还提供了祖传的记录，记录上写明， 阮奇山师从冯少青，而叶问与其他多个咏春武者一同在阮奇山的门下。“这本记录是上世纪70年代留下的， 这也不能说叶问是他的徒弟，但论资历，阮奇山排第 一，叶问最后，叶问向他请教很正常。.

<doc id="1048398" wikidata="Q3968324" url="?curid=1048398" title="Dark Empire">
<text>Dark Empire is a &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic book metaseries produced by Dark Horse Comics. It consists of a six-issue limited series written by Tom Veitch and drawn by Cam Kennedy, followed by a second six-issue limited series by Veitch and Kennedy, followed in turn by a two-issue limited series written by Veitch and drawn by Jim Baikie. The initial series is notable for being one of the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; comics to be produced by Dark Horse, which retained the comic rights to the franchise for over two decades.

Part of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe, the trilogy picks up six years after the events of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and just a year after Timothy Zahn&#x27;s &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy (1991–1993). The story deals with the resurrection of primary series antagonist Palpatine, revealed to have cheated death by transferring his spirit into a succession of cloned bodies. Other highlights include Luke Skywalker temporarily succumbing to the dark side of the Force, the return of Boba Fett (who seemingly died in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;), and the first appearance of Princess Leia and Han Solo&#x27;s youngest son Anakin Solo.

The series received mixed-to-positive reviews, and is credited as helping revive interest in the franchise in the early 1990s. Audio dramas and action figures were produced, and the series has been referenced in various other &quot;Star Wars&quot; media. As of 2000, over 100,000 issues had been printed. Although the comic was amongst many works declared non-canon to the franchise in 2014, the final film of the Skywalker Saga, 2019’s &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, utilized the plot element of Palpatine returning via cloning.

== Publication history ==
The &quot;Dark Empire I&quot; story was originally developed by Tom Veitch and Cam Kennedy for Marvel Comics. Veitch and Kennedy were approached by Lucasfilm based on their success with &quot;The Light and Darkness War&quot;. After difficulties with Marvel, the project was picked up by Dark Horse Comics. According to Veitch, he pitched franchise creator George Lucas the idea of a different character wearing Darth Vader&#x27;s armor, which Lucas rejected but said he would allow Palpatine&#x27;s return, as well as his use of a clone body. However, &quot;Star Wars Insider&quot;&#x27;s series of retrospectives on the creation of the series in 2015 clarified that Veitch&#x27;s editorial contact throughout the development of the series was Lucy Autrey Wilson. This was further illuminated in 2022, when Wilson spoke about the development of the series, saying: &quot;Tom Veitch, the story he wrote... You know, we were kind of letting people do what they wanted then. He wrote his story. I didn&#x27;t ask George anything.&quot;

&quot;Dark Empire I&quot; was a six-issue limited series published bimonthly in 1991 and 1992. &quot;Dark Empire II&quot; was also a six-issue limited series published from 1994 to 1995. The final installment, &quot;Empire&#x27;s End&quot;, was a two-issue limited series published in 1995. The trilogy is set after Timothy Zahn&#x27;s &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy, which was published from 1991 to 1993.

The individual comic issues each feature several pages of prose &quot;endnotes&quot; that provide additional background for the story, such as contextualizing Palpatine&#x27;s goals and worldview through excerpts of encyclopedic volumes called the &quot;Dark Side Compendium&quot; written from his in-universe perspective.

=== Collections ===
The various series have been collected into trade paperbacks:

* &quot;Dark Empire&quot; (collects &quot;Star Wars: Dark Empire&quot; #1–6, 182 pages, May 1993, )
* &quot;Dark Empire II&quot; (collects &quot;Star Wars: Dark Empire II&quot; #1–6, 168 pages, September 1995, )
* &quot;Empire&#x27;s End&quot; (collects &quot;Star Wars: Empire&#x27;s End&quot; #1–2, 64 pages, September 1997, )

The entire metaseries has also been collected into a single hardcover, which also includes &quot;Star Wars Handbook 3: Dark Empire&quot;, a collection of illustrated essays on the characters, locations, and other elements of the story:
* &quot;Dark Empire Trilogy&quot; (352 pages, Dark Horse Comics, September 2010, , Titan Books, December 2010, )

It was collected again under Marvel&#x27;s Epic Collection as Volume 5 of the New Republic series. This volume collects the three parts of the &quot;Dark Empire&quot; storyline, as well as some strips from Star Wars Tales, and the Star Wars Handbooks for &quot;X-Wing Squadron&quot; and &quot;Dark Empire&quot; (496 Pages, Marvel Comics, March 2021, ).

==Plot==

===&quot;Dark Empire&quot;===
Six years after the events of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; leads a Rebel task force to Coruscant. Han Solo, Leia Organa, Chewbacca, and are heading to the planet to rescue Luke Skywalker, R2-D2 and Lando Calrissian, who have spent the past several days holding out against Imperial attacks after an earlier raid using the captured Star Destroyer &quot;Liberator&quot; goes awry and the warship crashes. The Rebels successfully rescue the survivors, but a massive energy storm appears. Luke sees the storm as a large disturbance in the Force, and asks everybody to leave him behind; he lets himself be devoured by the storm.

The taskforce returns to the Rebel fleet in the Da Soocha system. Rebel commanders discuss the appearance of the Imperials coming out of the Deep Core and discover that Admiral Ackbar&#x27;s homeworld of Mon Calamari is now under attack by a fleet of Imperial war machines. Called the World Devastators, the machines are designed to convert everything in their path into raw materials for building more war machines on the spot. Lando leads another taskforce with a second captured Star Destroyer leading the charge to aid in Mon Calamari&#x27;s defense.

Meanwhile, Luke awakes from the light of the Force storm and finds out he is aboard an old Imperial prison ship heading to Byss. The ship docks and Luke is closely escorted to a chamber, where he is stunned to see Emperor Palpatine alive. The Emperor explains that he has revived himself in a clone body and makes Luke doubt any attempt to kill him knowing he will quickly manifest in another clone. Sensing the futility and seeing the horror of what is happening on Mon Calamari, Luke humbly surrenders to becoming the Emperor&#x27;s new apprentice.

Leia has visions of Luke being pulled to the dark side of the Force and wants to travel to Byss and save him. She and Han travel to Nar Shaddaa and try to arrange a ship to bring them past Byss&#x27; security network. Han reunites with smuggler friends Shug Ninx, Salla Zend, and Mako Spince to make it happen. Along the way, an old woman named Vima-da-Boda—a former Jedi who survived the Empire&#x27;s purge—feels Leia&#x27;s Force energy and gives her an old Jedi artifact. However, the Hutts have put a large bounty on Han and Leia, with Spince selling him out to Boba Fett (revealed to have survived being devoured by the sarlacc during the events of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;); the two escape Nar Shaddaa aboard Salla&#x27;s ship, the Starlight Intruder, with the Falcon attached. The Intruder has the proper codes to get inside Byss, and Imperial security lets them in (but lock out a pursuing Fett). Han, Leia, Chewie, and the droids are brought before Luke and Palpatine.

Leia discovers that he holds hostage an even greater treasure: a mysterious and intelligent artifact called the Jedi Holocron, a holographic cube that contains historical information about the Jedi. When Leia discovers that Palpatine is interested in possessing her third child, she steals the Holocron and the group successfully breaks out of Byss while having to leave behind Luke again. Luke faces the already frail Palpatine and destroys his clone tanks, but Palpatine possesses one living clone and subdues him to his will.

Han&#x27;s group travels to Mon Calamari as Rebel commando forces lay siege to the World Devastators, which have been shut down by a special master code Luke was able to steal and give to R2 and C3PO for transmission to the machines. The Imperials aboard the machines still have the factories running and attack the Rebels. R2 rigs the World Devastators to destroy each other.

As the Rebels celebrate on Mon Calamari, Alliance command determines that the World Devastators are part of a larger Imperial offensive to conquer the galaxy. Leia studies the Holocron and sees an old prophecy about a pregnant woman coming to save the Jedi from doom. At the same time, a small Imperial fleet, led by the massive flagship &quot;Eclipse&quot;, appears above Da Soocha. The Emperor demands that the Alliance surrender Leia to him and Luke. Leia travels on her own and appeals to Luke to break away from the Emperor. Palpatine creates a large Force storm to destroy the Rebel fleet, but Leia and Luke work together to amplify the storm beyond the Emperor&#x27;s power and turn it against him. The siblings escape the doomed warship, and as Luke sees the last remnants of the Eclipse being vaporized, he declares the Jedi Knights will rise again.

===&quot;Dark Empire II&quot;===
With Emperor Palpatine apparently perishing aboard the Eclipse, more worlds defy Imperial edicts, especially those that have been recently reconquered. One of these is the arms manufacturing planet Balmorra, whose planetary governor, Beltane, has begun supplying the Rebels with the latest military vehicles, such as the Viper X1 Automadon, a war droid designed to convert energy from enemy laser fire into power for its own turbolaser cannons. The Emperor&#x27;s Dark Side Executor Sedriss leads a force to subdue the planet, but Beltane&#x27;s troops hold the line and Sedriss is compelled to negotiate a supply agreement with him. Sedriss returns to Byss, where he kills two Dark Side Adepts who&#x27;ve been killing other clones of Emperor Palpatine that Luke missed. Palpatine possesses one clone to Sedriss&#x27; surprise and orders the Imperial offensive to continue.

Having pledged to reestablish the Jedi Order by finding any surviving Jedi in the galaxy, Luke Skywalker returns to Pinnacle Base on the moon Da Soocha V (orbiting Da Soocha in the Cyax System of Hutt Space of the Outer Rim) with Kam Solusar, a former Dark Jedi. Beltane tips the Rebel Alliance of a shipment of new Vipers bound for the Empire&#x27;s Deep Core stronghold of Byss, and Alliance commanders accept Wedge Antilles&#x27; suggestion of intercepting the shipment for a surgical strike using the droids, with Rebel commandos in the attack. Although Luke presses for liberating more worlds to provide more staging areas for an all-out strike on Byss, Mon Mothma asks him to concentrate on rebuilding the Jedi Order instead. The Jedi Holocron educates Luke about the planet Ossus, a former Jedi-populated world destroyed by the Sith thousands of years earlier.

Han, Leia and Chewie fly back to Nar Shaddaa to find Vima-da-Boda, at least where Leia last saw her. However, Vima has disappeared and every bounty hunter on the moon is still out for them, including Boba Fett, as well as an Imperial force led by two Dark Side Elites. Leia successfully fetches Vima after flying into the deeper reaches of Nar Shaddaa. Aboard Nar Shaddaa&#x27;s traffic control tower, Mako Spince sees Han and guides an Imperial Star Destroyer&#x27;s tractor beam on him. Han turns the tables by flying close to the tower, forcing the tractor beam to lock onto the structure and pull it instead at full power. The tower impales the Star Destroyer and it crashes into Nar Shaddaa. Fett, back in his old ship Slave I, chases the Millennium Falcon into a nearby acidic gas cloud. Han takes the risk and flies into the cloud, surprisingly appearing on the other side and stumbling onto the long-lost world of Ganath. Ganathan engineers repair the Falcon and equip it with a lightning cannon while the team meets Ganath&#x27;s ruler, Empatojayos Brand, a veteran Jedi who survived the Empire&#x27;s Jedi Purge. Inspired by the possibility of a Jedi rebirth, Brand joins Han&#x27;s party while leaving Ganath in the hands of a military officer. Han takes out Fett and heads to a secret hideout on New Alderaan, where Han and Leia&#x27;s twin children are under care.

Luke and Kam fly to Ossus and chances upon the Ysanna, a warrior tribe which has rudimentary Force powers. They fight off the Ysanna attacks and sensing they are indeed Jedi, the Ysanna chief welcomes them. Having known about the trip, Palpatine orders Sedriss and fellow Dark Side Elite Vill Goir to capture them. Solusar kills Goir, but Sedriss takes one of the Ysanna hostage and leans against a tree. To everybody&#x27;s surprise, the tree is a millennia-old Neti Jedi Master named Ood Bnar, who wraps Sedriss in a fatal embrace and they die in an explosion of Force energy. Bnar&#x27;s heroic sacrifice leaves a part of him in the soil and a hole underneath his location reveals an old cache of lightsabers; Luke successfully discovers an old Jedi library. Two Ysanna tribe members, siblings Ralf and Jem, join Luke and Kam in leaving the planet with their elders&#x27; blessing.

Lando leads the Rebel infiltration into Byss and start the attack when the Viper droids are offloaded. The droids prove superior to existing Imperial defenses until Palpatine releases an army of dark side-mutated monsters on the attackers. The Vipers, which are attuned against energy attacks, are cut to shreds under the monsters&#x27; mauling. Salla Zend and Shug Ninx mobilizes fellow smugglers nearby to rescue the Rebel strike group and escape Byss.

On New Alderaan, Leia prepares for the birth of her third child as Han and Chewie attempt to rendezvous with Lando&#x27;s group. Luke&#x27;s party arrives with grim news: he had reached Da Soocha to see a large missile appear and destroy the planet, with the Rebel Alliance command presumably killed. He uses the time to train the Ysanna siblings as Kam and Empatojayos practice their Jedi skills as well. Unknown to them, Palpatine&#x27;s Dark Side Elites have tortured a Rebel pilot into revealing the location of New Alderaan. Palpatine sees this as an opportunity to capture the Skywalker siblings and Leia&#x27;s offspring in one fell swoop. The Darksiders attempt to poison Luke, but Vima saves him as the entire settlement goes into action to fight the Imperials, who have deployed AT-ATs as backup. In the course of the fighting, Jem is killed and Rayf saves Leia&#x27;s twins from being kidnapped. The Millennium Falcon and Lando&#x27;s forces arrive and defeat the Imperial assault, then evacuate the New Alderaan survivors.

The Rebels relocate to the space stations of Nespis VIII, where they discover that the Alliance had evacuated Pinnacle Base before it was destroyed. On Nespis VIII, Han and Leia&#x27;s son Anakin (named after his deceased grandfather) is born and the Alliance plots the final destruction of the Empire.

===&quot;Empire&#x27;s End&quot;===

After perishing in battle with Luke and Leia Skywalker in &quot;Dark Empire I&quot;, Emperor Palpatine is forced to occupy an inferior clone body, since it was the last clone body that remained. Unknown to him, his personal physician had been corrupted by Carnor Jax, backed by a number of other high-ranking Imperial personnel. The physician had deliberately inserted genetic material and contaminants into all stored samples of the Emperor&#x27;s original body, to the effect that the resulting bodies would be nowhere as resistant to the ravaging effects of the dark side as the original.

The last clone body not destroyed by Skywalker or traitorous Imperials is now aging rapidly, and Palpatine&#x27;s final end is near, unless he can either fix his genetic material (an impossibility since no unaltered samples remain) or insert his spirit into another body. After consulting with ancient Sith Lords on the mausoleum planet Korriban, Palpatine learns that Han and Leia&#x27;s youngest child, Anakin, has the only workable body.

Palpatine follows the Solos to Onderon in order to gain a new body, to ensure the future of his rule. A fierce duel occurs between Luke Skywalker and his Jedi team and Palpatine; finally, Han Solo wrongly shoots the Emperor, allowing him to be out of his physical form and get what he wanted: Anakin&#x27;s body. He desperately tries to send his spirit into the infant Anakin, but he is blocked by the soul of the dying Jedi Empatojayos Brand, who makes the ultimate sacrifice in willingly sending his eternal soul into the &quot;madness beyond death&quot; that is the dark side, to ensure Palpatine would go as well and can never return. Luke then vows to revive the Jedi Order. After the death of Palpatine, a projectile from the Galaxy Gun is shot into Byss (since the crew were frightened by the potential collision, and also misfired), utterly destroying Byss, and destroying the second &quot;Eclipse&quot;-class Star Destroyer, &quot;Eclipse II&quot;, which was steered into a collision course with the Galaxy Gun by R2-D2, thus ending the Empire&#x27;s harsh rule.

Later in 1995, a &quot;Dark Empire: Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; CD set was released that collected the two &quot;Dark Empire&quot; audio dramas as well as an exclusive adaptation of &quot;Empire&#x27;s End&quot;.

==Impact==
Along with Timothy Zahn&#x27;s books, &quot;Dark Empire&quot; has been credited with sustaining the profitability of &quot;Star Wars&quot; during the 1990s. By the end of the decade, it had sold over 100,000 copies.

Kenner released four action figures based on the series in 1998: Luke, Leia, Palpatine, and an Imperial sentinel (originally intended to be a new character called &#x27;Atha Prime&#x27; for Kenner&#x27;s aborted 1984 &#x27;Power of the Force&#x27; line of toys); the cases for each of the figures folded out into backdrops based on the comic. In 2008, figures of Luke and Palpatine from &quot;Dark Empire II&quot; were released.

&quot;Dark Empire&quot; has appeared on a number of lists of best Expanded Universe works. In a review for &quot;The Sci-Fi Block&quot;, Robert Ring called the series &quot;an essential &quot;Star Wars&quot; classic&quot; but commented that the ending was rushed. Writing for &quot;Tor.com&quot;, Ryan Britt stated that the first &quot;Dark Empire&quot; miniseries was superior to its sequels and praised it for taking stylistic departures from other works.

The later Dark Horse comic &quot;Crimson Empire&quot; trilogy takes place after and references events from the &quot;Dark Empire&quot; trilogy.

Following its 2012 acquisition by Disney, in April 2014 Lucasfilm branded most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film as non-canonical &#x27;Legends&#x27; to create a clean slate for the sequel trilogy.

Following the release of the final sequel trilogy film, &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019), several critics interpreted the circumstances of Palpatine&#x27;s return as amounting to a tribute to &quot;Dark Empire&quot;. The film&#x27;s novelization reveals that Palpatine returned using a clone body, much like his return in the comic. Additionally, both the comic and film invoke the spirits of past Jedi to defeat Palpatine permanently.

Although first glimpsed prior to &quot;Dark Empire&quot; in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic, Boba Fett&#x27;s survival was canonically depicted in the second season of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; (2020) and its spinoff series &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot; (2022).

<doc id="1048404" wikidata="Q1759235" url="?curid=1048404" title="Jaú">
<text>Jaú is a municipality in the center of the state of São Paulo, in Brazil. The population is 151,881 (2020 est.) in an area of . The elevation is . The city takes its name from the native fish species &quot;jau&quot;.

== History ==

The history of the city goes back to 1853, when a group of people decided to settle and found a village. Not until 1889, however, did it achieve the status of town. Its most widely known inhabitant is João Ribeiro de Barros, the first man to travel from Europe to South America by plane, in 1927, 23 days before Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s flight.

== Economy ==
Jaú is located in a tropical weather region, known for its very fertile lands, which were once called &quot;terra roxa&quot; (purple land). The city is known as the national capital of female shoes, which are exported to the whole world.

== Sports ==
Esporte Clube XV de Novembro is a traditional sport club of the town, founded in 1924. The club plays its home matches at Estádio Zezinho Magalhães. Jaú is also the birthplace of freestyle swimmer Renata Burgos, who represented Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.

=== Polibol ===
The city is the birthplace of polibol, a court game created in 1980 by physical education teacher Fernão de Toledo Castro. Based on the philosophy of judo, polibol combines fundamentals of handball, futsal, basketball, dodgeball and volleyball. It is played on a multi-sports court by two teams of six players each, including a goalkeeper, and the goal is to score points through goals, baskets and dodgeball. Polibol is currently implemented in municipal, state and private schools in Jaú, and is practiced in other regions of São Paulo and in other states, such as Rio de Janeiro, Pernambuco, Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul. In 2018, it was recognized by the Panathlon Internacional Jaú - Distrito Brasil as a sport focused on Fair Play. In 2019, it became a Cultural Heritage of Jahu, by Legislative Law No. 5262 of November 6, 2019.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<doc id="1048406" wikidata="Q3835531" url="?curid=1048406" title="Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine">
<text>The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) is a post-graduate teaching and research institution based in Liverpool, England, established in 1898. It was the first institution in the world dedicated to the study of tropical medicine. LSTM conducts research in areas such as malaria and insect-borne diseases and operates as a higher education institution with degree-awarding powers.

LSTM is also a registered charity, with a research portfolio exceeding £220 million, supported by funding from organizations such as the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust. In partnership with the University of Liverpool, LSTM co-founded the Centre of Excellence in Infectious Diseases Research (CEIDR), which focuses on improving global healthcare and medical technologies.

==History==

LSTM was founded on 12 November 1898 by Sir Alfred Lewis Jones, a prominent local ship owner. At the time, Liverpool was a prominent port city which carried on an extensive trade with overseas regions such as West and Southern Africa. Consequently, the number of patients in the region admitted to hospital with &#x27;tropical&#x27; diseases soared. Recognising the need for a solution to this problem Jones, together with a number of fellow business men and health pioneers, pledged an annual donation of £350 for three years to promote the study of tropical diseases in the city. This offer of financial support was announced at the annual dinner of students of Liverpool&#x27;s Royal Southern Hospital and was warmly accepted by the hospital&#x27;s president who later went on to suggest that his hospital should act as the clinical focus of the studies in view of its proximity to the docks.

This initial endeavour later led to Jones&#x27;s participation in helping to set up the School of Tropical Medicine. Having received news that the RSH greatly appreciated the collection of the hospital&#x27;s &#x27;tropical&#x27; cases into one centre rather than &#x27;leaving them scattered about in the general wards&#x27; the suggestion was made that the arrangement might be made permanent. In light of this, the professional members of the hospital&#x27;s committee were asked to meet and plan the new school; this they did and in due course the committee communicated its intention to the Colonial Office (which was, at the time, responsible for such matters).
In its response, the Colonial Office acknowledged the creation of the School of &#x27;Tropical Diseases&#x27; at University College, Liverpool and commented on how &#x27;excellently equipped for teaching of tropical medicine&#x27; it was, but made quite clear that no financial aid would be forthcoming as a similar Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had so recently been established in London with the support of the Colonial Secretary of the day, Joseph Chamberlain. The Colonial Office did concede, however, that all future candidates for the service who had attended training programmes in Liverpool would be given preference when applying.

Apparently the Liverpool School was nevertheless still unsuitable for doctors joining the Colonial Service since the letter continued: &#x27;I propose that Officers already in the Colonial Service should be allowed to receive their instruction in Liverpool instead of at the School in London, but newly appointed Officers will always be sent to the latter School&#x27;. Liverpool did not accept this compromise and continued its pressure for full recognition. At last, on 12 July 1900 the Colonial Office finally acquiesced and the school was placed on the same terms as London with regard to newly appointed Officers. Similar recognition was given by the Foreign Office, which was responsible for Britain&#x27;s protectorates. Thus, although the Liverpool School came into active being six months before the school in London, it took another year to persuade the Colonial Office to recognise it officially.
It was not long before the school, helped largely by private donations from individuals like Mary Kingsley (the author of &quot;Travels in West Africa&quot; and an expert in African culture), began to flourish. The school soon recruited the eminent physician Rubert Boyce as its inaugural dean. Boyce then set about the business of appointing teaching staff and secured the services of Ronald Ross as the school&#x27;s first lecturer in Tropical Medicine. The department was based in the Thompson Yates Laboratory until 1903 when the Johnston Laboratories opened. In 1902 Ross became the first British recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on malaria transmission and in the same year a separate department of Tropical Veterinary medicine was set up with a dedicated laboratory at Crofton Lodge in Runcorn to allow for the study of large animals. Other notable staff of the time included Joseph Everett Dutton who discovered one of the trypanosomes that cause sleeping sickness, Harold Wolferstan Thomas who developed the first effective treatment for the disease, and his collaborator Anton Breinl, who later became &#x27;the father of tropical medicine&#x27; in Australia.

When Alfred Lewis Jones died in 1909 he left a large bequest to the school. Thanks to this and other donations that it received the school was able to set up its own laboratory and teaching premises in Pembroke Place, separate from the University of Liverpool, upon whose facilities it had previously relied. The laboratory was completed in 1914 but due to the advent of the war occupation of the building by LTSM was deferred and it was used as a Tropical Diseases Hospital offering courses to officers of the Royal Army Medical Corps. Professor R M Gordon joined the school in 1919 and by 1920 teaching had resumed and the school finally moved into its own building.
In 1921, the school opened its first overseas research laboratory in Freetown, Sierra Leone. This laboratory functioned continuously until the early stages of World War II and made many important discoveries in West Africa, including demonstrating that a species of black fly was responsible for transmission of filarial worm to humans, causing river blindness. It was work like this that was essential for the Liverpool school to understand tropical diseases and subsequently the school completed 32 expeditions to Africa and Central and South America over the following years.

In 1946, the appointment of LSTM&#x27;s longest serving Dean, Brian Maegraith, marked a broadening of the School&#x27;s size and curriculum. Maegraith famously declared &#x27;Our impact on the tropics should be in the tropics!&#x27; which resulted in the school forging links with other research institutions across the globe and bringing research innovations to those most in need. An ongoing example of this is the Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme which conducts research into local diseases of importance to Malawi.

From 2000 until 2019 LSTM was directed by Janet Hemingway, who initiated large financial investment and expansion. The school received higher education institution status in 2013 and in 2017 was awarded its own degree awarding powers by the Privy Council.

==Location==

The school is located in buildings in Liverpool close to Royal Liverpool University Hospital. 

==Organisation and administration==
The school&#x27;s traditional emblem depicts a Viking longboat under sail and was designed by the famed Glaswegian designer Herbert MacNair. The elements of the emblem all have meaning.

The Viking longboat depicted in the emblem is a reference to Liverpool&#x27;s maritime heritage and the school&#x27;s location in Northern England, an area with significant historical links to Scandinavia that was subject to Viking invasion and the Danelaw throughout the tenth century. The fact that the ship is depicted under sail refers to &#x27;journeys to unknown destinations&#x27;, a reflection on the school&#x27;s mission to research and treat tropical diseases. Similarly, the rising sun placed directly behind the ship indicates the beginning of the journey and pays respect to its auspicious motives. Finally, the eye depicted on the ship&#x27;s sail pays homage to ancient deities connected with healing, particularly in Greek mythology.

The school&#x27;s current logo is derived from its traditional emblem and depicts a stylised red-maroon sail.

The school&#x27;s director is elected by its governing council every three to five years, with no limit on the number of terms that any individual director can be re-elected to. While Sir Rubert Boyce became the school&#x27;s first director upon its foundation in 1898 there would not be another &#x27;director&#x27; for almost ninety years. This is because the director post that Boyce held became associated with the newly endowed chair of tropical medicine upon its creation in 1902. From this date the title of director was replaced with that of &#x27;Dean&#x27; until it was brought back into use with the election of David Molyneux in 1991.

==Academic profile==

LSTM has a broad portfolio of basic and translational research and policy activities in infectious diseases and public health research. To achieve this, the school is split into four departments: (a) International Public Health (b) Tropical Disease Biology (c) Clinical Sciences and (d) Vector Biology.

===Department of International Public Health===
The Department of International Public Health specialises in the use of research to guide policies, strengthen health systems and improve health care. This is achieved through work on monitoring and evaluation, gender equity, capacity strengthening and research into the role of human resources in policy development. The Department also leads research into the development and scale-up of large scale, complex interventions to prevent the spread of HIV and houses the rapidly expanding Centre for Maternal and Newborn Health.

===Department of Tropical Disease Biology===
The Department of Tropical Disease Biology conducts internationally rated basic research on tropical parasites such as malaria, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, soil-transmitted helminths, schistosomiasis, trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis, as well as research into snakebite and neglected tropical diseases. Housed in LSTM&#x27;s Centre for Tropical and Infectious Disease the department is a global leader in drug and diagnostics discovery and disease pathogenesis.

===Department of Clinical Sciences===
The Department for Clinical Sciences focuses on improving the management of important diseases in the tropics. Researchers work across a broad spectrum of clinical sciences, including: experimental medicine; evidence synthesis; clinical trials; implementation and evaluation; teaching and clinical practice. 
Specific areas of interest include clinical infectious disease epidemiology, developing preventative and therapeutic strategies for respiratory infections, and improving child and adolescent health.

The Department also hosts the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group who help inform global policy by working closely with the World Health Organization and others to prepare systematic reviews in tropical infectious diseases.

===Department of Vector Biology===
The Department of Vector Biology has a research profile that spans from functional genomics of disease vectors to clinical trials, implementation research and the development of tools for monitoring and evaluation of disease transmission. The Department&#x27;s research is centred on improving the control of vector borne diseases in the developing world, with a focus on neglected tropical diseases and malaria. 
Understanding mosquito behaviour, evolutionary genomics and the extent, causes and impact of insecticide resistance on malaria control is major research strength of the department.

This Department has long been one of the world&#x27;s premier sites of research on African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT, nagana), the major livestock disease in Africa.

===Cross cutting themes===
Overlaid on this structure are five cross-cutting themes, which draw upon expertise from all four research departments. The themes are: Capacity Development; Centre for Applied Health Research and Delivery; Evidence-based Medicine; Neglected Tropical Diseases and the Centre for Health in the Eastern Mediterranean.

===Teaching===
LSTM offers a range of postgraduate education programmes, teaching over 600 students from around the world. These vary from taught master&#x27;s degrees in humanitarian assistance and international public health, diplomas and short courses in tropical and infectious diseases, to research degrees leading to MPhil, DrPH and PhD.

===Awards===
The Mary Kingsley Medal was instituted by LSTM co-founder John Holt in 1903 and is awarded for outstanding contributions in the field of tropical medicine. It is named in honour Mary Kingsley, a noted traveller and writer of the late 19th century, who had a powerful influence on the way Africa was perceived at the time, and who died in South Africa at the age of 38 from suspected typhoid. The 100th award was made in 2015.

Recipients of the award include Patrick Manson, David Bruce, Waldemar Haffkine, Bernard Nocht, Hans Vogel, and Frederick Vincent Theobald.

<text>Betty Lou Holland (December 26, 1925 – January 10, 2021), also known as Betty Lou Cordier, was an American actress who worked on stage, in television, and in film during the decades of the 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s. She was best known for her work on Broadway and as a lead in a 1960 television adaptation of &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot;.

== Biography ==
Betty Lou Holland was born in New York City on December 26, 1925. She began acting on the stage in the 1940s and appeared on Broadway, in &quot;Call Me Mister&quot;, &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot;.

In &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot;, the actress was in her 20s when she played a 12 year old.

She continued to act on stage through the 1950s, playing a leading role in &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot;, and the George Bernard Shaw play, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot;.

Holland acted in television programs in the 1950s. Holland was one of the principal roles of the NBC television adaptation of &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot;.

Holland played in the NBC-television special, &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot; in 1958. She also appeared in a TV version of Daphne Du Maurier&#x27;s &quot;The Birds&quot; on the CBS series &quot;Danger&quot; on May 31, 1955. In 1958 she portrayed a secretary recovering from mental illness in the TV drama series &quot;Decoy&quot;.

She was in only two motion pictures, playing the role of Mrs. Faulkner, mother of Kim Stanley&#x27;s character, in &quot;The Goddess&quot; (1958) and playing Roz Moreland in &quot;The Man in the Net&quot; (1959).

In &quot;The Goddess&quot;, Holland recalled that the religious conversion scene, which was long, was applauded by the Hollywood crew, not for the acting, but because all actors had remembered their lines.

== Personal life ==
She married Robert Cordier, a Belgian-Franco-American director and poet, in January 1962 in New York. They had two children, Cecilia Cordier and Horace Cordier. Robert Cordier died in Paris in April 2020, from complications of COVID-19. Betty Lou Cordier survived a COVID-19 infection, but died some months later in New York City on January 10, 2021, at the age of 95.

<text>North Hobart is a suburb of the city of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. As its name suggests, it lies directly north of the Hobart City Centre.

The main street of North Hobart is Elizabeth Street, which extends northward from the Elizabeth Street Mall in the city, through North Hobart, and then becomes the Main Road in New Town and continues through many suburbs to Glenorchy and beyond.

The most recent median house price for North Hobart is $420,855 and the median unit price is $410,000.

== Amenities ==
Two colleges are located in the area - Elizabeth College, one of Hobart&#x27;s four public secondary colleges, and The Friends&#x27; School, a private school for years K-12. North Hobart was also home of the former Hobart High School from 1918 to 1984 - one of the first schools in the city. The building has been preserved and used by many educational establishments over the years, and is now a Millingtons funeral home.

Other places in North Hobart include:
*The historic North Hobart Post Office, which still exists in its original form.
*North Hobart Oval, one of the larger sports grounds in Hobart. It is the site of the Brickfields Hiring Depot during the mid 1800s, and is now predominantly used for Australian rules football matches. The suburb is represented by the North Hobart Football Club in the Tasmanian State League.
*The State Cinema, Tasmania&#x27;s largest independent cinema, generally shows independent and underground films

== Restaurant strip ==

Elizabeth Street (between Tasma and Federal Streets) contains many of the restaurants and cafes for which North Hobart is known. The area could be compared with Lygon Street in Melbourne, except on a much smaller scale.

Restaurants in the area include two Italian restaurants and two fish bars. Asian food dominates the strip with Indian, Thai, Japanese and Chinese food, all being popular. Other restaurants serve Mexican and Turkish food. Several chain restaurants are located here as well.
==Redevelopment==
In 2004 the area was redeveloped, including footpath widening and lining Elizabeth Street with trees. Alderman Zucco unsuccessfully proposed that the area be lined with olive trees to promote the multiculturalism that exists in the area.

<doc id="1048415" wikidata="Q5188294" url="?curid=1048415" title="Cross Examination Debate Association">
<text>The Cross Examination Debate Association (CEDA) ( ) is the largest intercollegiate policy debate association in the United States. Throughout the school year, CEDA sanctions over 60 tournaments throughout the nation, including an annual National Championship Tournament that brings together over 175 individual debate teams from across the nation to compete on the basis of research, persuasive speaking, argumentation, and philosophy.

For a number of years, CEDA employed a two-person team value debate format. CEDA utilized two topics each year, one governing the fall semester and the second governing the spring semester. For the spring 1996 topic, it was voted to continue debating the fall topic about Mexico. Beginning with the 1996–1997 season, however, CEDA has employed a single, year-long policy debate topic.

==Controversy==
In the 2013 tournament, the winning team from Emporia State University was criticized for using personal memoirs and rap music to criticize white privilege during the debate, while failing to address the stated resolution. CEDA President Paul Mabrey points to the value of limited actual formal rules in CEDA debate and the ways that a variety of forms of debate raise the educational value of the activity and call these objections &quot;nothing other than thinly-veiled racism.&quot; Other teams participating in the debates have said &quot;the pedagogical goals of policy debate are not being met-and are even being undermined.&quot;

In 2014, despite winning the tournament, the team from Towson University was criticized by observers for referencing racial slurs, failing to adhere to standard debate practices and arguing a topic unrelated to the proposed resolution. These types of debate strategies &quot;[have] received mainstream acceptance, sympathy, and awards&quot;, despite objections and complaints from tournament participants, labelling the strategies as offensive. In the wake of this controversy, CEDA President Paul Mabrey stated in an official CEDA video of that the accusations of poor preparation and incomprehensibility &quot;...[R]epresent the worst of our human bigotry. These attacks on Towson, Oklahoma, and others in our debate community are motivated by racism and fear.&quot;

==National Tournament results==
*2013 - Champion: Emporia State University (Ryan Walsh and Elijah Smith) 
*2014 - Champion: Towson University (Ameena Ruffin and Korey Johnson) Runner-up: University of Oklahoma (Rashid Campbell and George Lee) 
*2019 - Champion: University of Oklahoma (Jazmine Pickens and Darius White) Runner-up: University of Kansas (Azja Butler and Kenny Delph)
*2020 - Cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic

<text>Fourplay (stylized as fOURPLAY) is a contemporary American smooth jazz quartet. The original members of the group were Bob James (keyboards), Lee Ritenour (guitars), Nathan East (bass), and Harvey Mason (drums).

In 1997, Ritenour left the group and Fourplay chose Larry Carlton as his replacement. In 2010, Carlton left Fourplay and was replaced by Chuck Loeb, who died on July 31, 2017. During Loeb&#x27;s illness, saxophonist Kirk Whalum joined the group for performances.

The group has enjoyed consistent artistic and commercial success by grafting elements of R&amp;B and pop to jazz, appealing to a broad mainstream audience. Their debut album, &quot;Fourplay&quot; (1991), sold over a million copies and remained at the number one position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; contemporary jazz chart for 33 weeks. Their next album, &quot;Between the Sheets&quot; (1993), reached number one, went gold, and received a Grammy Award nomination. In 1995, their third gold album, &quot;Elixir&quot;, also was number one and remained on the chart for more than 90 weeks. In 2015 the band celebrated its 25th anniversary with the release of the album &quot;Silver&quot; with former members Ritenour and Carlton.

<doc id="1048437" wikidata="Q1754616" url="?curid=1048437" title="Junqueirópolis">
<text>Junqueirópolis is the name of a city and the surrounding municipality in the western region of the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The population is 20,831 (2020 est.) in an area of 583 km2 (5 km2 of which is city). Its elevation is 421 m. &quot;Rio do Peixe&quot; (Fish River) and &quot;Rio Aguapeí&quot; (Aguapeí River) are major rivers of the region.

==History==
At the start of the 20th century this area was largely unexplored and undeveloped. It was not until 1941 that the &quot;Companhia Paulista de Estrada de Ferro&quot; (São Paulo Locomotive Company) ran railroad tracks through this remote hinterland.

Over the next few years Alvaro de Oliveira Junqueira, a wealthy inhabitant of the city of São Paulo, began buying up land here upon which he established coffee plantations. On 1 November 1944 the municipal division of &quot;Patrimônio de Junqueira&quot; (Junqueira&#x27;s Patrimony) was established and land development proceeded as lots were sold to investors.

Horácio Cajado de Oliveira, Enrique Coutinho and Jose Amatruda were among those that settled here during this period. Another early settler was Torataro Takitami, a representative of the country&#x27;s growing Japanese Brazilian population.

The municipality was created by state law in 1948.

The place name has been formed by joining Junqueira&#x27;s surname with the Greek language-derived suffix &quot;-polis&quot; meaning &quot;city&quot;.

==Geography==
The municipality contains 16.5% of the Aguapeí State Park, created in 1998.

==Economy==
===Agriculture===

Outside the urban area, Junqueirópolis is a hilly, agricultural region that produces valuable crops that thrive in a subtropical climate. For this reason the municipality promotes itself as &quot;Cidade Verde&quot;, &quot;Green City&quot;.

Among the fruits grown here, acerola is important enough to the local economy that Junqueirópolis has another nickname -- &quot;Capital da Acerola&quot;, the &quot;Acerola Capital&quot;. In the 1998–1999 season Junqueirópolis produced 2,450 tons of this fruit. The predominant type of acerola produced here is the &quot;Olivier&quot;, a variety that is packed with the Vitamin C (1.200 mg/100ml of juice and 1.400 mg/100g of pulp) for which this plant is primarily cultivated and can be cultivated with little pesticide.

Junqueirópolis is also known for its grapes. Among the most widely cultivated varieties of grape in Junqueirópolis are Itália, Benitaka, Brazil and Ruby. Grapes from this region are made into table wines of excellent quality.

Other major crops grown in Junqueirópolis are maize, cotton, and coffee. The importance of produce production to this region is demonstrated in the depiction of the municipal coat of arms shown above which has been illustrated with acerola, grapes, sugarcane, etc.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

==Penitentiary==
The penitentiary in Junqueirópolis was the site of some of the violence of 2006 that swept the prisons of São Paulo state and involved deadly clashes between Primeiro Comando da Capital (a prison gang) and Polícia Militar do Estado de São Paulo (the state police).

== Religion ==

Christianity is present in the city as follows:

=== Catholic Church ===
The Catholic church in the municipality is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Marília.

=== Protestant Church ===
The most diverse evangelical beliefs are present in the city, mainly Pentecostal, including the Assemblies of God in Brazil (the largest evangelical church in the country), Christian Congregation in Brazil, among others. These denominations are growing more and more throughout Brazil.

<doc id="1048445" wikidata="Q1372350" url="?curid=1048445" title="Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon">
<text>Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon (), of the Ibn Tibbon family, also known as Prophatius, was a Jewish astronomer; born, probably at Marseilles, about 1236; died at Montpellier about 1304. He was a grandson of Samuel ben Judah ibn Tibbon. His Provençal name was Don Profiat Tibbon; the Latin writers called him Profatius Judæus. Jacob occupies a considerable place in the history of astronomy in the Middle Ages. His works, translated into Latin, were quoted by Copernicus, Reinhold, and Clavius. He was also highly reputed as a physician, and, according to Jean Astruc (&quot;Mémoires pour Servir à l&#x27;Histoire de la Faculté de Médecine de Montpellier,&quot; p. 168), Ibn Tibbon was regent of the faculty of medicine of Montpellier.

In the controversy between the Maimonists and the anti-Maimonists, Jacob defended science against the attacks of Abba Mari and his party; the energetic attitude of the community of Montpellier on that occasion was due to his influence.

== Works ==

Jacob became known by a series of Hebrew translations of Arabic scientific and philosophical works, and above all by two original works on astronomy. His translations are:
* the &quot;Elements&quot; of Euclid, divided into fifteen chapters
* the treatise of Qusta ibn Luqa on the armillary sphere, in sixty-five chapters
* &quot;Sefer ha-Mattanot,&quot; the &quot;Data&quot; of Euclid
* Autolycus&#x27; &quot;On the Moving Sphere&quot;
* Theodosius&#x27; &quot;Spherics&quot;
* Menelaus&#x27; &quot;Spherics&quot;
* &quot;Ma&#x27;amar bi-Tekunah,&quot; or &quot;Sefer &#x27;al Tekunah,&quot; in forty-four chapters
* a treatise on the use of the astrolabe
* compendium of the &quot;Almagest&quot; of Ptolemy
* &quot;Iggeret ha-Ma&#x27;aseh be-Luaḥ ha-Niḳra Sofiḥah&quot;
* preface to Abraham bar Ḥiyya&#x27;s astronomical work
* an extract from the &quot;Almagest&quot; on the arc of a circle
* &quot;Ḳiẓẓur mi-Kol Meleket Higgayon,&quot; Averroes&#x27; compendium of the &quot;Organon&quot; (Riva di Trento, 1559)
* Averroes&#x27; paraphrase of books xi–xix of Aristotle&#x27;s history of animals
* &quot;Mozene ha-&#x27;Iyyunim,&quot; falsely attributed to Ghazali, including also a large part deriving from the Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity (&quot;Rasā’il Ikhwān al-Ṣafā’&quot;)

The two original works of Jacob are:
* a description of the astronomical instrument called the quadrant (Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, MS. No. 1054), in sixteen chapters, the last of which shows how to construct this instrument. This was translated several times into Latin (once by Armengaud Blaise)
* astronomical tables, beginning with 1 March 1300 (Munich MS. No. 343, 26). These tables were translated into Latin and enjoyed great repute.

<doc id="1048452" wikidata="Q1995186" url="?curid=1048452" title="Flash powder">
<text>Flash powder is a pyrotechnic composition, a mixture of oxidizer and metallic fuel, which burns quickly (deflagrates) and produces a loud noise regardless of confinement. It is widely used in theatrical pyrotechnics and fireworks (namely salutes, e.g., cherry bombs, M-80s, firecrackers, and cap gun shots) and was once used for flashes in photography.

Different varieties of flash powder are made from different compositions; most common are potassium perchlorate and aluminium powder. Sometimes, sulfur is included in the mixture to increase the sensitivity. Early formulations used potassium chlorate instead of potassium perchlorate.

Flash powder compositions are also used in military pyrotechnics when production of large amount of noise, light, or infrared radiation is required, e.g., missile decoy flares and stun grenades.

==History==

Lycopodium powder is a yellow-tan dust-like powder historically used as a flash powder. Today, the principal use of the powder is to create flashes or flames that are large and impressive but relatively easy to manage safely in magic acts and for cinema and theatrical special effects.

==Mixtures==

Normally, flash powder mixtures are compounded to achieve a particular purpose. These mixtures range from extremely fast-burning mixtures designed to produce a maximum audio report, to mixtures designed to burn slowly and provide large amounts of illumination, to mixtures that were formerly used in photography.

===Aluminium and chlorate===
The combination of aluminium powder and potassium chlorate is unstable, and a poor choice for flash powder that is to be stored for more than a very short period. For that reason, it has been largely replaced by the potassium perchlorate mixtures. Chlorate mixes are still used when cost is the overriding concern because potassium chlorate is less expensive than perchlorate. 

The simplest is a two-component chlorate mix, although this is rarely used.
:KClO3 + 2Al → Al2O3 + KCl

The composition is approximately 70% KClO3 : 30% Al by weight for the reactants of the above stoichiometrically balanced equation.

It is considered critically important to exclude sulfur and any acidic components from these mixtures. Sulfur oxidises and absorbs moisture to produce sulfuric and thionic acids; any acid in the mixture makes it unstable. Sometimes a few percent of bicarbonate or carbonate buffer is added to the mixture to ensure the absence of acidic impurities.

Sulfur is deliberately added as a third component to this mixture in order to reduce the activation energy. However this gives the problem with acid production and instability and so these mixtures are generally considered too unstable to be stored and must be mixed immediately before use. Antimony trisulfide may be used as an alternative, and is more stable in storage.

===Potassium nitrate, aluminium and sulfur===
This composition, usually in a ratio of 5 parts potassium nitrate, to 3 parts aluminum powder, to 2 parts sulfur, is especially popular with hobbyists. It is not very quick-burning unless exceptionally fine ingredients are used. Although it incorporates sulfur, it is in fact fairly stable, sustaining multiple hits from a hammer onto a hard surface. Adding 2% of its weight with boric acid is reputed to significantly increase stability and shelf life, through resistance to dampening through ambient humidity. Other ratios such as 6 KNO3/3 Al/1 S and 5 KNO3/2 Al/3 S also exist and work. All ratios have similar burn times and strength, although 5 KNO3/3 Al/2 S seems to be dominant.

:2 KNO3 + 4 Al + S → K2S + N2 + 2 Al2O3

The composition is approximately 59% KNO3 : 31.6% Al : 9.4% S by weight for the reactants of the above stoichiometrically balanced equation.

For best results, &quot;German Dark&quot; aluminum should be used, with air float sulfur, and finely ball milled pure potassium nitrate. The finished mixture should never be ball milled together.

===Aluminium and perchlorate===
Aluminium powder and potassium perchlorate are the only two components of the pyrotechnic industry standard flash powder. It provides a great balance of stability and power, and is the composition used in most commercial exploding fireworks.

The balanced equation for the reaction is:-

:3 KClO4 + 8 Al → 3 KCl + 4 Al2O3

The stoichiometric ratio is 34.2% aluminum and 65.8% perchlorate by mass.
A ratio of seven parts potassium perchlorate to three parts dark pyro aluminium is the composition used by most pyrotechnicians. 

For best results, the aluminium powder should be &quot;Dark Pyro&quot; grade, with a flake particle shape, and a particle size of fewer than 10 micrometres. The KClO4 should be in powder form, free from clumps. It can be sieved through a screen, if necessary, to remove any clumps prior to use. The particle size of the perchlorate is not as critical as that of the aluminium component, as much less energy is required to decompose the KClO4 than is needed to melt the aluminium into the liquid state required for the reaction.

Although this composition is fairly insensitive, it should be treated with care and respect. Hobbyist pyrotechnicians usually use a method called &quot;diapering&quot;, in which the materials are poured separately onto a large piece of paper, which is then alternately lifted at each corner to roll the composition over itself and mix the components. Some amateur pyrotechnicians choose to mix the composition by shaking in a closed paper container, as this is much quicker and more effective than diapering. One method of mixing flash is to put the components in the final device and handling the device will mix the flash powder. Paper/cardboard is chosen over other materials, such as plastic, as a result of its favorable triboelectric properties.

Large quantities should never be mixed in a single batch, as they are difficult to handle safely and can put bystanders at risk. In the event of accidental ignition, debris from a multiple-pound flash powder explosion can be thrown hundreds of feet with sufficient force to kill or injure. (Note: 3 grams of mixture is enough to explode in open air without constraint other than air pressure.)

No matter the quantity, care must always be taken to prevent any electrostatic discharge or friction during mixing or handling, as these may cause accidental ignition.

===Magnesium and nitrate===
Another flash composition common among amateurs consists of magnesium powder and potassium nitrate. Other metal nitrates have been used, including barium and strontium nitrates. Compositions using nitrate and magnesium metal have been used as photographic flash powders almost since the invention of photography. Potassium nitrate/magnesium flash powder should be mixed and used immediately and not stored due to its tendency of self-ignition.

If magnesium is not a very fine powder, it can be passivated with linseed oil or potassium dichromate. The passivated magnesium flash powder is stable and generally safe to store.

:2 KNO3 + 5 Mg → K2O + N2 + 5 MgO
The composition is 62.4% KNO3 : 37.6% Mg by weight for the reactants of the above stoichiometrically balanced equation. Below is the same reaction but involving barium nitrate.

:Ba(NO3)2 + 5 Mg → BaO + N2 + 5 MgO

Mixtures designed to make reports are substantially different from mixtures designed for illumination. A stoichiometric ratio of three parts KNO3 to two parts Mg is close to ideal and provides the most rapid burn. The magnesium powder should be smaller than 200 mesh, though up to 100 mesh will work. The potassium nitrate should be impalpable dust. This mixture is popular in amateur pyrotechnics because it is insensitive and relatively safe as such things go.

For photographic use, mixtures containing magnesium and nitrates are made much more fuel rich. The excess magnesium is volatilized by the reaction and burns in air providing additional light. In addition, the higher concentration of fuel results in a slower burn, providing more of a &quot;poof&quot; and less of a &quot;bang&quot; when ignited. A formula from 1917 specifies 5 parts of magnesium to 6 parts of barium nitrate for a stoichiometry of nine parts fuel to one part oxidizer. Modern recreations of photographic flash powders may avoid the use of barium salts because of their toxic nature. A mixture of five parts 80 mesh magnesium to one part of potassium nitrate provides a good white flash without being too violent. Fuel rich flash powders are also used in theatrical flash pots.

Magnesium based compositions degrade over long periods, meaning the metallic Mg will slowly react with atmospheric oxygen and moisture. In military pyrotechnics involving magnesium fuels, external oxygen can be excluded by using hermetically sealed canisters. Commercial photographic flash powders are sold as two-part mixtures, to be combined immediately before use.

=== Magnesium and PTFE ===
A flash composition designed specifically to generate flares that are exceptionally bright in the infrared portion of the spectrum use a mixture of pyro-grade magnesium and powdered polytetrafluoroethylene. These flares are used as decoys from aircraft that might be subject to heat-seeking missile fire.

:2n Mg + (C2F4))n → 2n MgF2 (s) + 2n C (s)

=== Antimony trisulfide and chlorate ===
This mixture, and similar mixtures sometimes containing pyro aluminium have been used since the early 1900s for small &quot;Black Cat&quot; style paper firecrackers. Its extremely low cost makes it popular among manufacturers of low-grade fireworks in China. Like all mixtures containing chlorates, it is extremely sensitive to friction, impact and electrostatic discharge, and is considered unsafe in pyrotechnic devices that contain more than a few tens of milligrams of the mixture.

:3 KClO3 + Sb2S3 → Sb2O3 + 3 SO2 + 3 KCl

This mixture is not highly energetic, and in at least some parts of the United States, firecrackers containing 50 mg or less of this mixture are legal as consumer fireworks.

==Safety and handling==
Flash powders even within intended usages often release explosive force of deadly capacity. Nearly all widely used flash powder mixtures are sensitive to shock, friction and electrostatic discharge. In certain mixtures, it is not uncommon for this sensitivity to spontaneously change over time, or due to change in the environment, or to other unknowable factors in either the original manufacturing or in real-world storage. Additionally, accidental contaminants such as strong acids or sulfur compounds can sensitise them even more. Because flash powder mixtures are so easy to initiate, there is potentially a high risk of accidental explosions which can inflict severe blast/fragmentation injuries, e.g. blindness, explosive amputation, permanent maiming, or disfigurement. Fatalities have occurred. The various flash powder compositions should therefore not be handled by anyone who is unfamiliar with their properties, or the handling techniques required to maintain safety. Flash powder and flash powder devices pose exceptionally high risks to children, who typically cannot understand the danger and may be less adept with safe handling techniques. As a result, children tend to suffer more severe injuries than adults.

Flash powders—especially those that use chlorate—are often highly sensitive to friction, heat/flame and static electricity. A spark of as little as 0.1–10 millijoules can set off certain mixtures. Certain formulations prominent in the underground press contain both sulfur and potassium chlorate. These mixtures are especially shock and friction sensitive and in many applications should be considered unpredictable. Modern pyrotechnic practices call for never using sulfur in a mix containing chlorate salts.

Some flash powder formulations (those that use single-digit micrometre flake aluminium powder or fine magnesium powder as their fuel) can self-confine and explode in small quantities. This makes flash powder dangerous to handle, as it can cause severe hearing damage and amputation injury even when sitting in the open. Self-confinement occurs when the mass of the pile provides sufficient inertia to allow high pressure to build within it as the mixture reacts. This is referred to as &#x27;inertial confinement&#x27;, and it is not to be confused with a detonation.

Flash powder of any formulation should not be mixed in large quantities by amateur pyrotechnicians. Beginners should start with sub-gram quantities, and refrain from making large devices. Flash powder should only be made at the site at which it will be used. Additionally, the mixture should be made immediately before use. When mixed, the transportation, storage, usage, various possession, and illegal &quot;firearms&quot; laws (including felonies) may come into effect that do not apply to the unmixed or pre-assembled components.

<doc id="1048453" wikidata="Q7540657" url="?curid=1048453" title="Slimming World">
<text>Slimming World is a weight loss organisation based in Derbyshire in England that caters for men and women of all ages. It was founded in Derbyshire in 1969 by Margaret Miles-Bramwell, who remained its chairperson until her death on 2 February 2025.

Its focus is predominantly weight loss, and supports members to maintain a healthy weight once they reach their target. It operates through a network of 3,500 &quot;consultants&quot; across the country.

Slimming World offers an eating plan based on food satiety and energy density as well as a group support service called IMAGE Therapy.

==Company history==

The company began in 1969 with a handful of groups in Derbyshire before expanding into Yorkshire. By the 1980s, Slimming World had 700 classes in the United Kingdom and by 2012 there were more than 10,000 groups, making it the largest slimming club in the UK and Ireland.

Slimming World launched its charity SMILES (Slimmers Making It a Little Easier for Someone) in 1997 and has since raised more than £25,000,000 for good causes.

Slimming World publishes recipe books and directories for group members and launched &quot;Slimming World&quot; magazine in 1998.

In 2001, the company launched a referral scheme in which GPs could &quot;prescribe&quot; 12 weeks&#x27; attendance to patients wishing to lose weight. In 2011, a paper in the journal Obesity Facts showed patients attending at least 10 sessions achieved a clinically significant loss of 5% of their body weight.

Slimming World now works with about 60 UK health authorities and more than 100,000 patients had been referred by April 2011. It also signed the Government&#x27;s Public Health Responsibility Deal, in which participants pledged to help the public eat more healthily and exercise more.

==Diet overview==

===Efficacy===
In its 2014 guidance, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence lists Slimming World alongside the Rosemary Conley and Weight Watchers programmes as being &quot;effective at 12 to 18 months&quot;.

===Physical activity===

<text>Palmela () is a town and municipality in Portugal. As of 2011, the population was 62,831, covering an area of 465.12 km².

The municipality is located in the Lisboa Region and Setúbal District, about south of Lisbon. The municipal holiday is celebrated on 1 June.

==Communes==
Administratively, the municipality is divided into four civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):
* Palmela
* Pinhal Novo
* Poceirão e Marateca
* Quinta do Anjo

==General information==
The area has been settled since at least Neolithic times, as evidenced by excavations at sites such as the artificial caves of Casal do Pardo and the Castro of Chibanes. The town&#x27;s name originates from its Roman founder, Cornelius Palma (&quot;Palmella&quot;). Palmela, which was once a fortress, was conquered by the Portuguese in the 12th century. It is a semi-rural town situated on a hill in the Arrábida area, within Portugal&#x27;s largest urban area. Many people are relocating to Palmela from larger cities like Lisbon. Wildfires in the region pose a threat to the environment.

In 1165, during the Reconquista, a battle was fought near Palmela in which the Portuguese defeated a large Muslim army.

The castle, Castelo de Palmela, offers a unique view of the entire Setúbal Peninsula, Lisbon, and the Atlantic Coast. It was a strategic location in past centuries and remains a major junction in Portugal&#x27;s road and rail networks today.

Palmela is home to several multinational industrial units, such as Volkswagen and Coca-Cola, and a significant number of foreign families reside in the area. The local radio often broadcasts in Ukrainian.

Palmela&#x27;s traditional products include its wine, which has won international awards at several festivals such as the Bordeaux Wine Festival, and &quot;Queijo de Azeitão&quot; (Azeitão cheese). There are several festivals dedicated to these products, with the most famous being the &quot;Festa das Vindimas&quot; (Harvest&#x27; Festival) and the &quot;Festival do Queijo, Pão e Vinho&quot; (Festival of Cheese, Bread and Wine).

Palmela is the birthplace of the Portuguese explorer Hermenegildo Capelo. Additionally, some other famous individuals, such as Hans Christian Andersen, were briefly hosted there.

==Economy==
The municipality is renowned for its production of fruit and wine.

In the 1990s, the joint-venture Volkswagen-Ford AutoEuropa vehicle production plant opened to produce the Mk1 MPV, sold under three marques: Volkswagen Sharan, SEAT Alhambra and Ford Galaxy. After Ford left the joint venture, the plant continued to produce Volkswagen and SEAT models and added the Volkswagen Eos, Volkswagen Scirocco and Volkswagen T-Roc.

== Notable people ==
* Hermenegildo Capelo (1841 in Palmela - 1917) an officer in the Portuguese Navy and an explorer, charted territory between Angola and Mozambique
* Hugo José Jorge O&#x27;Neill (1874 – 1940 in Palmela) the head of the Clanaboy O&#x27;Neill dynasty
* Octávio Machado (born 1949) a retired footballer and coach with 307 club caps and 19 for Portugal
* Ricardo Pateiro (born 1980 in Palmela) a Portuguese retired footballer with 270 club caps

Their recruitment went into a high gear when Dong Fang Xiang, a legendary basketball player, transferred to their school.

Around the same time, Yuan Da Ying fell for Zhan Jie Er, a scholarship student who reminds him of his childhood friend Gu Gu Ji.

== Company history ==
Founded by John Bell in 1990, Bell Shakespeare began as a theatre company dedicated to producing the plays of William Shakespeare in a way that was relevant and exciting to Australian audiences. With the support of an enlightened philanthropist, the late Tony Gilbert AM, and a small number of imaginative corporate and private supporters, Bell Shakespeare was able to mount productions and attract audiences.

Bell Shakespeare is listed as a Major Festival in the book &quot;Shakespeare Festivals Around the World&quot;.

In 2016, the Australian Federal Government announced a $1 million contribution to the Bell Shakespeare capital campaign, which will help the Company secure a permanent home at Sydney&#x27;s Pier 2/3, Walsh Bay.

In 2012, John Bell announced the promotion of associate artistic director Peter Evans to the position of co-artistic director. In 2015, John Bell retired from the company, and Peter Evans was made sole artistic director.

Bell Shakespeare&#x27;s artistic director is Peter Evans and the Executive Director is Gill Perkins.

<text>Böhse Onkelz (; sensational spelling of (German for &quot;evil uncles&quot;)) is a German rock band formed in Frankfurt in 1980. The band reunited in 2014. Despite mass-media criticism concerning their past as skinheads, several of their later records topped the German album charts (selling over 5,338,000 records and 425,000 videos or DVDs). &quot;E.I.N.S.&quot; was their most successful album, with over 510,000 copies sold.

==History==

===1980–1981: Founding===

Inspired by bands like the Sex Pistols and the Ramones, Böhse Onkelz began in November 1980 in Hösbach as a punk rock band. Founding members were Stephan &quot;Der W&quot; Weidner, Kevin Russell and Peter &quot;Pe&quot; Schorowsky. According to the official band biography, its name originated when teenagers in their neighbourhood warned their younger siblings about them with the words &quot;Vorsicht, da sind die bösen Onkels!&quot; Their name was an intentionally incorrect spelling of &quot;evil uncles&quot; (&quot;böse Onkel&quot;). Before that, they called themselves &quot;Beulenpest&quot; (bubonic plague) for two weeks (as seen on the Tour 2000 film). Initially, the band played primarily in the Frankfurt am Main area.

Böhse Onkelz maintained its initial lineup until Matthias Röhr (nicknamed &quot;Gonzo&quot;, after the Ted Nugent album of the same name) joined them in 1981. Musically he was the most experienced of the group, having played guitar for six years and playing in other bands (such as Antikörper). Since Weidner played guitar, Matthias started out on bass; however, they switched instruments before their first recordings for the punk sampler &quot;Soundtracks zum Untergang 2&quot;.

===1981–1985: Skinhead scene===
&quot;Soundtracks zum Untergang 2&quot; (&quot;Soundtracks for the Downfall, Vol. 2&quot;) was a left-wing-oriented punk sampler, on which Böhse Onkelz featured in the band&#x27;s first widely released recording. However, the movement behind that sampler - which at that time has been seen as being apolitical - moved further towards anarchism, so the band lost interest in that subculture. Football became more important in their lives, particularly the fights surrounding it.

The band initially considered itself part of the (originally nonpolitical) Oi! subgenre, but it made its first shift to the political right during the early 1980s. The album &quot;Der nette Mann&quot; was released in 1984 by the Rock-O-Rama label, which had left its punk roots behind and concentrated on records by neo-Nazi and far-right bands. This album was &#x27;indexed&#x27; in September 1986 because of its (alleged) sexism and glorification of violence. The album also contained the patriotic songs &quot;Stolz&quot; (&quot;Pride&quot;) and &quot;Deutschland&quot; (&quot;Germany&quot;), which endeared the band to the far-right scene. The album was followed by &quot;Böse Menschen – Böse Lieder&quot; in 1985. Shortly after the release of the &quot;Mexico&quot; EP in late 1985, the band split with Rock-O-Rama; it had been defrauded of royalties and was concerned about the growing far-right reputation of the label, which did not represent its viewpoint.

In 1985, Böhse Onkelz appeared in the TV movie &quot;Zagarbata&quot; by Tabea Blumenschein. The film was a ZDF co-production, directed by Christoph Dreher, about the skinhead and punk subcultures of the early 1980s.

===1986–1992: Banning and media attention===

Apart from the indexing of &quot;Der nette Mann&quot; in 1986, things were calm around the band after its departure from the skinhead scene. After one charity concert, there were no live performances until 1989. In 1987 they released the album &quot;Onkelz wie wir...&quot;, followed by &quot;Kneipenterroristen&quot; in 1988. The albums contained songs about drinking and violence, but were richer musically and lyrically. Despite Russell&#x27;s alcohol and heroin addictions, the band continued to work together. During this period the band was ignored by the media; however, this changed with the growing album sales of &quot;Es ist soweit&quot;, &quot;Wir ham’ noch lange nicht genug&quot; and &quot;Heilige Lieder&quot;.

On 16 June 1990 the band&#x27;s best friend, Andreas &quot;Trimmi&quot; Trimborn, was stabbed to death during an incident at a bar in Frankfurt&#x27;s Sachsenhausen district. Two days later, Böhse Onkelz supporters located the assailant: a &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; soldier whose father held high military rank. The killer was acquitted; the judge stated that Böhse Onkelz and its entourage were known to be violent, and the stabbing was committed in self-defense. Even today, all witnesses reject the claim that Trimmi threatened the killer and his companion (both of whom had allegedly snorted cocaine minutes before the incident). Russell fell into a deep depression over the loss of his friend, masking his grief with drugs and alcohol; his substance-abuse habits became so destructive that he almost died. The songs &quot;Nur die besten sterben jung&quot; (&quot;Only the best die young&quot;) and &quot;Der Platz neben mir&quot; (&quot;The place beside me&quot;) were written for Trimmi.

===1992–1997: Commercial success and criticism===

In 1992, with no marketing, the album &quot;Heilige Lieder&quot; rose to No. 5 on the German LP charts. Despite its increasing commercial success, the band bore the stigma of being part of the right wing until its end. The Onkelz faced considerable criticism, which led to radio stations refusing to play their songs. Many observers did not believe that the band had &quot;seen the light&quot;, considering their exit from the skinhead scene as a stratagem to avoid bans and prosecution. The band&#x27;s reputation suffered, due to several poorly researched articles written about them. In response, Weidner wrote songs such as &quot;Fahrt zur Hölle&quot; (&quot;Go to Hell&quot;) for &quot;Weiß&quot; and &quot;Danke für nichts&quot; (&quot;Thanks for Nothing&quot;) for &quot;Hier sind die Onkelz&quot; (&quot;Here are the Onkelz&quot;).

Large department stores, such as Media Markt, World of Music (WOM) and Saturn, refused to sell their albums. By the end of the 1990s, however, Media Markt and WOM relented. Only Saturn refused to sell them until the band&#x27;s final album, &quot;Adios&quot; in 2005 (which, with their other later albums, topped the charts for several weeks).

Since the early 1990s the Onkelz repeatedly took public positions against extremism of any kind, referring to themselves as outsiders with no political affiliation. In 1993, on their album &quot;Weiß&quot; (referring to the Riot of Rostock-Lichtenhagen), the band recorded its first song clearly disapproving of right-wing extremism: &quot;Deutschland im Herbst&quot; (&quot;Germany in Autumn&quot;). Singing about &quot;braune Scheiße&quot; (&quot;brown scum&quot;) (referring to the colour of the NSDAP), &quot;ich sehe blinden Hass, blinde Wut, feige Morde, Kinderblut&quot; (&quot;I see blind hatred, blind anger, cowardly murders, children&#x27;s blood&quot;) and &quot;blinde Parolen von Idioten und Verlierern&quot; (&quot;blind slogans from idiots and losers&quot;). The song &quot;Ohne mich&quot; (&quot;Without me&quot;) from their 1998 album &quot;Viva los Tioz&quot; speaks out against right- and left-wing extremism. The lyrics of the first verse argue that anti-fascists were, in fighting the band, not seeing their real enemy and were no better than fascists (at whom the second verse, which consists mostly of swearing, is directed). The band also acknowledges its past in the skinhead scene, singing: &quot;Ihr seid dumm geboren, genau wie ich. Doch was ich lernte, lernt ihr nicht.&quot; (&quot;You were born dumb just like me. But what I learned, you did not.&quot;)

In 1994 the band moved to Virgin Records (its first major label), for which they released the album &quot;Hier sind die Onkelz&quot; a year later; it reached No. 5 on the album charts. The 1996 album &quot;E.I.N.S.&quot; followed (No. 4 on the charts), and its title was interpreted by some in the media as &quot;Eigentlich immer noch Skins&quot; (&quot;In Fact, Still Skins&quot;). The album featured a song, &quot;Enie Tfahcstob rüf Ediona-RAP&quot;, addressing this criticism. &quot;E.I.N.S&quot; was named in reader polls of music magazines (&quot;Rock Hard&quot; and &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;) one of the top 10 Best Metal Album of All Time (although it was not their best-seller). Since the mid-1990s, the band referred to their fans as &quot;nephews&quot; and &quot;nieces&quot;, strengthening the communal spirit expressed in the song &quot;Danke&quot; from their album &quot;Ein böses Märchen...aus tausend finsteren Nächten&quot;.

===1997–2004: No. 1 on the charts===

The band has a large fan base, and is one of the most successful German music groups. In 1998, they sold about 300,000 copies of the album &quot;Viva los tioz&quot; within the first 48 hours after release. In 2000 they released &quot;Ein böses Märchen&quot;, their first album under their new record label (rule23 Recordings) and produced their first music video for the single &quot;Dunkler Ort&quot;, which was broadcast on MTV. Later, an &quot;MTV Masters&quot; special about the Onkelz was made (which the band disliked). In 2002 they released the diss track &quot;Keine Amnestie für MTV&quot; (&quot;No Amnesty for MTV&quot;), indicating that they would never work together in the future. In 2002 the Onkelz released the album &quot;Dopamin&quot;, which was recorded on the Spanish island of Ibiza and mastered at Abbey Road Studios in London.

On 8 August 2003, despite negative publicity, the Böhse Onkelz were a supporting act for The Rolling Stones at their concert in the open-air arena at the Hanover Fairground. That year they played a club tour in Germany under their alias, &quot;Los Tioz&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Die Onkelz&quot;).

===2004–2005: Career end===

When the band&#x27;s five-year contract with Virgin ended in 2003 they found a new distributor in SPV GmbH for their final album, &quot;Adios&quot;. On 24 May 2004 the Onkelz officially announced their retirement from the music business. After the release of the album, a performance at the Wacken Open Air in August 2004 and the sold-out &quot;La Ultima&quot; tour, their farewell show took place on 17 and 18 June 2005 at the EuroSpeedway Lausitz (in Lusatia, Brandenburg) under the name Vaya Con Tioz before an audience of approximately 120,000. It was the largest open-air show by a German band in history. Supporting bands included Motörhead, Machine Head, JBO, In Extremo, Psychopunch, Children of Bodom, Pro-Pain and the Onkelz cover bands Enkelz and Kneipenterroristen.

===2005–2013: Aftermath===
On 16 February 2007 their last concert was released on four DVDs entitled &quot;Vaya Con Tioz&quot; (Spanish for &quot;go with the Onkelz&quot;), a play on &quot;Vaya con dios&quot; (&quot;Go with God&quot;). In 2008 it was given an Echo (music award) in the category &quot;Musik-DVD-Produktion (national)&quot;. In November 2007 the Onkelz released a new version of their album &quot;Onkelz wie wir...&quot; as their only chance to regain musical rights for their songs (which still belonged to their former label, Metal Enterprises. Weidner and Röhr have since released two solo albums and one Live album.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2009, Russell was involved in a hit-and-run auto accident under the influence of drugs in which two young men were seriously injured. On 4 October 2010, he was sentenced to two years and three months in prison by the Frankfurt am Main court.

Events concerning Böhse Onkelz are organised in Germany, such as G.O.N.D. (&quot;Größte Onkelz Nacht Deutschlands&quot;) (Biggest Onkelz Night of Germany) which has been held since 2006. In 2011, around 20,000 people attended.

===2014: Comeback===
In late 2013 the E.I.N.S GmbH was founded by the two band members Matthias &quot;Gonzo&quot; Röhr and Peter &quot;Pe&quot; Schorowsky. E.I.N.S. GmbH was founded for planning and realizing concerts. From 20 January rumors began to spread around, that the band plans a comeback. On 1 February 2014 they launched a trailer on their official website, stating they would play a concert together and revealed the date and the location, which will be on 20 June on the German race track Hockenheimring.
Later, the band posted a statement on Facebook in which they announced, that further things (like a tour or a new album) could happen, if the fans do want so.

== Music and lyrics ==
The band&#x27;s musical style has changed several times. Originally they played punk rock, beginning with their demo album. They were heavily inspired by punk bands (such as the Sex Pistols and the Ramones) and Oi! bands like Sham 69, Cock Sparrer and Angelic Upstarts. Their music was stylistically similar to Oi! during the early and mid-1980s, and later to heavy metal and hard rock. Russell&#x27;s vocals have been a distinctive part of the band&#x27;s style.

On later albums, the band experimented with a variety of musical styles. The song &quot;1000 Fragen&quot; (&quot;1000 Questions&quot;) is a tribute to The Doors, featuring metaphysical lyrics and organ music. On the album &quot;Viva los tioz&quot; they combined hard rock rhythms with electronic music. An Indian sitar was used in the song &quot;Einmal&quot; from the album &quot;Adios&quot;. The nickname of guitarist &quot;Gonzo&quot; is derived from the album &quot;Double Live Gonzo&quot; by Ted Nugent (an influence on Gonzo). He and Stephan Weidner were also fans of American blues rock musician Stevie Ray Vaughan, to whom they dedicated the instrumental &quot;Tribute to Stevie&quot; on their 1993 album &quot;Weiß&quot;.

The first song on most of their albums serves as an introduction to the band. Many of their songs are directed against their critics (particularly journalists)—for example, &quot;Danke für nichts&quot;, &quot;Zeig mir den Weg&quot;, &quot;Jaja&quot;, &quot;Keine Amnestie für MTV&quot;. In earlier years, the Onkelz also sang drinking songs such as &quot;Heute trinken wir richtig&quot;, &quot;Alkohol&quot; and &quot;Freibier&quot;.

The lyrics of later albums concern the meaning of life, as a line from &quot;Finde die Wahrheit&quot; demonstrates: &quot;Denn die Wege sind lang, und selbst der Tod ist nicht ihr Ende, wach endlich auf!&quot; (&quot;For the paths are long, and even death isn&#x27;t their end, wake up already!&quot;). Similar songs include &quot;Wieder mal &#x27;nen Tag verschenkt&quot;, &quot;Stand der Dinge&quot;, &quot;Das Problem bist Du&quot; and &quot;Dunkler Ort&quot;. The trial of the murderer of Andreas &quot;Trimmi&quot; Trimborn was mentioned in several songs (&quot;Nur die Besten sterben jung&quot;, &quot;So geht&#x27;s Dir (Deine Hölle)&quot;, &quot;Das Messer und die Wunde&quot;, &quot;Ganz egal&quot; and &quot;Der Platz neben mir&quot;).

Other subjects addressed in the band&#x27;s lyrics are individualism, finding oneself and self-love. In &quot;Wenn Du wirklich willst&quot;, they sing &quot;Sei du selbst, steh zu dir, die Wahrheit wird gelebt und nicht doziert. Du bist was du warst und du wirst sein was Du tust, beginne dich zu lieben, und du findest, was du suchst&quot; (&quot;Be yourself, stand for you, the truth is lived and is not taught. You are what you were and you will be what you do, begin to love yourself and you will find what you are searching for.&quot;). Songs like &quot;Das Wunder der Persönlichkeit&quot;, &quot;Mutier mit mir&quot;, &quot;Ich mache was ich will&quot; and &quot;Ich bin wie ich bin&quot; are other examples.

In later albums the past is repeatedly addressed, often concerning the wild experiences of band members. The song &quot;Erinnerungen&quot; contains the lines &quot;Ich erinner&#x27; mich gern an diese Zeit, eine Zeit die man nie vergißt. Doch ich muss mein Leben leben, meinen Weg alleine gehn, mach&#x27;s gut, Du schöne Zeit, auf Wiederseh&#x27;n&quot; (&quot;I gladly remember that time, a time that you never forget. But I have to live my life, have to go my way alone. Farewell, beautiful time, goodbye&quot;), referring to the band&#x27;s exit from the skinhead scene. The songs &quot;Ein langer Weg&quot;, &quot;Scheiße passiert&quot;, &quot;Nie wieder&quot;, &quot;Flammen&quot;, &quot;Deutschland im Herbst&quot;, &quot;Buch der Erinnerungen&quot; and &quot;Ohne mich&quot; have a similar motif.

==Accusations of right-wing extremism==
The band has been accused—despite many protests—of extreme right-wing tendencies, with their 1981 song &quot;Türken raus&quot; cited as an example. This song was written during their punk phase, and the band says it was written as a reaction to a specific Turkish gang with whom they often fought. Critics claim that the song does not refer to a specific group, but demands that &quot;all Turks have to go&quot;. The band contends that it was only an example of their primitive way of thinking at that time. The 1983 song &quot;Deutschland den Deutschen&quot; (&quot;Germany For Germans&quot;) is also often mentioned; however, the band says that this song was also written in reaction to their experiences on the street.

Another song from 1981, &quot;SS-Staat&quot; (&quot;SS State&quot;) on &quot;Kill the Hippies – Oi!&quot;, is (according to the band) &quot;a glaringly provocative anti-Nazi song&quot;. Due to poor recording quality, the line &quot;SS-Staat im Staate, wir wollen&#x27;s nicht erleben&quot; (&quot;SS state in the state, we don&#x27;t want to experience it&quot;) can be misunderstood as &quot;SS-Staat im Staate, wir wollen&#x27;s mit erleben&quot; (&quot;SS state in the state, we want to experience it&quot;).

&quot;Türken raus&quot; and &quot;Deutschland den Deutschen&quot; were never officially released; they were distributed by copying the demo tapes. Weidner said: &quot;The lyrics were stupid, and of course there was never a release of this song; of course, there will be never such a release.&quot;

The first two records of the band were released on the Rock-O-Rama label, during the mid 80&#x27;s mostly known by releasing neonazi bands like Skrewdriver. 

The band has denied all right-wing accusations since 1985, and has written several songs against extremism, totalitarianism and racism. Later political songs promote independent opinion and oppose hate.

<doc id="1048489" wikidata="Q2915951" url="?curid=1048489" title="Vasa vasorum">
<text>Vasa vasorum are networks of small blood vessels that supply the walls of large blood vessels, such as elastic arteries (e.g., the aorta) and large veins (e.g., the venae cavae). 

The name derives . Occasionally, two different singular forms are seen: vasa vasis () and vas vasis ().

==Structure==
Studies conducted with 3D micro-CT on pig and human arteries from different vascular beds have shown that there are three different types of vasa vasorum: 
* &quot;Vasa vasorum internae&quot;, that originate directly from the main lumen of the artery and then branch into the vessel wall.
* &quot;Vasa vasorum externae&quot;, that originate from branches of the main artery and then dive back into the vessel wall of the main artery.
* &quot;Venous vasa vasorae&quot;, that originate within the vessel wall of the artery but then drain into the main lumen or branches of concomitant vein.

Depending on the type of vasa vasorum, it penetrates the vessel wall starting at the intimal layer (vasa vasorum interna) or the adventitial layer (vasa vasorum externa). Due to higher radial and circumferential pressures within the vessel wall layers closer to the main lumen of the artery, vasa vasorum externa cannot perfuse these regions of the vessel wall (occlusive pressure).

The structure of the vasa vasorum varies with the size, function and location of the vessels. Cells need to be within a few cell-widths of a capillary to stay alive. In the largest vessels, the vasa vasorum penetrates the outer (tunica adventitia) layer and middle (tunica media) layer almost to the inner (tunica intima) layer. In smaller vessels it penetrates only the outer layer. In the smallest vessels, the vessels&#x27; own circulation nourishes the walls directly and they have no vasa vasorum at all.

Vasa vasorum are more frequent in veins than arteries. Some authorities hypothesize that the vasa vasorum would be more abundant in large veins, as partial oxygen pressure and osmotic pressure is lower in veins. This would lead to more vasa vasorum needed to supply the vessels sufficiently. The converse argument is that generally artery walls are thicker and more muscular than veins as the blood passing through is of a higher pressure. This means that it would take longer for any oxygen to diffuse through to the cells in the tunica adventitia and the tunica media, causing them to need a more extensive vasa vasorum.

A later method of scanning is optical coherence tomography that also gives 3D imaging.

==Function==
The vasa vasorum are found in large veins and arteries such as the aorta and its branches. These small vessels serve to provide blood supply and nourishment for tunica adventitia and outer parts of tunica media of large vessels.

==Clinical significance==
* In the human descending aorta, vasa vasorum cease to supply the arterial tunica media with oxygenated blood at the level of the renal arteries. Thus, below this point, the aorta is dependent on diffusion for its metabolic needs, and is necessarily markedly thinner. This leads to an increased likelihood of aortic aneurysm at this location, especially in the presence of atherosclerotic plaques. Other species, such as dogs, do have vasa vasorum below their renal vasculature, and aneurysms at this site are substantially less likely. Cerebral blood vessels are devoid of vasa vasorum; however, these vessels have rete vasorum, which have similar function to vasa vasorum.
*A relationship exists between changes in the vasa vasorum and the development of atheromatous plaques. It is not understood whether changes in the vasa vasorum, especially in terms of their appearance and disappearance, is a cause or merely an effect of disease processes. In 2017 Haverich proposed that the formation of plaques is not from inside the vessel, but the result of inflammation of the vasa vasorum. Haverich noted that arteries fed by vasa vasorum are subject to development of arteriosclerotic plaques. He postulated that inflammation compromises the integrity of the arterial wall. He noted that arteries with thin walls, not having vasa vasorum, do not develop arteriosclerosis. Damage by inflamed vasa vasorum leads to cell death within the wall and subsequent plaques formation. Vasa vasorum inflammation can be caused by viruses, bacteria, and fine dust among others. According to his view this concept conforms to observations that cardiac infarctions are more common when influenza has occurred or fine particles have been inhaled. 
* Small vessels like vasa vasorum and vasa nervorum are particularly susceptible to external mechanical compression, and thus are involved in pathogenesis of peripheral vascular and nerve diseases.
* A tear in vasa vasorum situated in tunica media layer of aorta may start pathologic cascade of events leading to aortic dissection.
* Presence of corkscrew collateral vessels in vasa vasorum is a hallmark of Buerger&#x27;s disease and distinguishes it from Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon.
* T cells found near vasa vasorum are implicated in pathogenic process of giant cell arteritis.
* Inflammation and subsequent destruction of the vasa vasorum is the cause of syphilitic aortitis in tertiary syphilis. Obliterating endarteritis of the vasa vasorum results in ischemia and weakening of the aortic adventitia, which may lead to aneurysm formation in the thoracic aorta.

<text>Ip Chun (born Ip Hok-chun; 10 July 1924), also known as Yip Chun or Yip Jun, is a Chinese martial artist and actor in the style of Wing Chun. He is the elder of two sons. Chun&#x27;s father, Ip Man, was the Wing Chun teacher of Bruce Lee.

==Early life==
He was born Ip Hok-chun in Foshan, Kwangtung (now Guangdong) on 10 July 1924 to police officer and martial artist Ip Man and his wife Cheung Wing-sing.

In 1949, after the Communists established the People&#x27;s Republic of China on the Chinese mainland, Ip&#x27;s father left for Hong Kong and Ip, then 24, remained in Foshan to continue his studies in university. However, due to the Cultural Revolution, Ip and his younger brother, Ip Ching, were forced to leave Foshan and move to Hong Kong to join their father.

==Education==
Ip studied Chinese history, philosophy, poetry, traditional music, and Buddhism. In 1950, Ip had completed his studies and he chose teaching as a profession. In addition to teaching Chinese history, music and science, Ip also helped the Chinese Foshan Entertainment Department organise opera plays. During that time, he was awarded &quot;The Person with the Most Potential in Chinese Art&quot; award for his research in music.

==Professional career==
In Hong Kong, Ip worked as an accountant and newspaper reporter in the day and practiced Wing Chun in the evening under his father&#x27;s tutelage. In accordance with his father&#x27;s wishes, in 1965, Ip participated in the affairs of the Ving Tsun Athletic Association and became one of its founding members when it was formally established in 1968. During the first three years in the association, Ip took on the role of treasurer and was later appointed as chairman.

==Teaching accomplishments==
In 1967, Ip began teaching Wing Chun in Hong Kong and some of his first students, such as Leung Chung-wai and Ho Kay, chairman of Wing Chun Ip Chun Academy and a student of Ip for three decades, still train with him at present. Ip&#x27;s father died in December 1972 and entrusted the film footage of his Siu Nim Tao, Chum Kiu and Muk Yan Jong forms to his sons for posterity. In 2014 Ip Chun was selected as a nominee to represent Wing Chun as the inheritor of the legacy of Wing Chun-style kung fu. Ip Chun has taught and held seminars in many cities, including countries such as Australia, England and the United States.
==In film==
Ip Chun had a small role in the 1976 film &quot;Bruce Lee: The Man, The Myth&quot; as Bruce Lee&#x27;s &quot;Wing Chun Sifu&quot; (Ip Man). Ip made a special appearance as Ip Man in the 1999 film &quot;What You Gonna Do, Sai Fung?&quot; ( &quot;1959 某日某&quot;). Ip served as a consultant for &quot;Ip Man&quot;, a 2008 Hong Kong film about the life of his father. He also made another special appearance as Leung Bik (son of Leung Jan) in another film, &quot;The Legend Is Born: Ip Man&quot;. In 2013, he made a cameo appearance in another Ip Man film, &quot;Ip Man: The Final Fight&quot;.

== Later life ==
He turned 100 on July 31, 2024.

==Awards and achievements==
*Ip Chun received a Fellowship (FSMA) from the Society of Martial Arts (U.K.), the only professional and Educational Charity to introduce the first degree program in martial arts in the world, from its Founder and President Prof. Eugene de Silva PhD, FRSA in 2000.
*Received &quot;The Person with the Most Potential in Chinese Art&quot; award for his research in music.
*Winner of the China Movie Channel Media Awards for Best Male Supporting Role at Shanghai International Film Festival 2010.
*Nominated at the &quot;China Movie Channel Media Awards&quot; for Best New Actor at &quot;Shanghai International Film Festival 2010.&quot;

<text>Ashima (; ) is an ancient Semitic goddess.

==Ancient Middle East==
Ashima was a West Semitic goddess of fate related to the Akkadian goddess Shimti (&quot;fate&quot;), who was a goddess in her own right but also a title of other goddesses such as Damkina and Ishtar. Damkina, for example, was titled &quot;banat shimti&quot;, &quot;creator of fate&quot;. The name Ashima could be translated as &quot;the name, portion, or lot&quot; depending on context. It is related to the same root as the Arabian &quot;qisma&quot; and the Turkish &quot;kismet&quot;. Asima was one of several deities worshipped in the individual cities of Samaria who are mentioned specifically by name in 2 Kings () in the Hebrew Bible.

Julian Obermann suggests a close association with between the concept of &quot;name&quot; and &quot;fate or purpose&quot; from the West Semitic root &quot;šm&quot; and cites several examples in the Ugaritic text in which the naming of a person or object determines future function which is a familiar theme in many mythologies. Godfrey Rolles Driver translates 𐎌𐎎𐎚 &quot;šmt&quot; as &quot;charge, duty, function&quot; in his glossary of Ugaritic and links this with the Akkadian &quot;shimtu&quot; which he translates as &quot;appointed lot&quot;. As a personification of fate, Ashima was cognate with the South Semitic goddess Manathu (or Manāt) whose name meant &quot;the measurer, fate, or portion&quot; who was worshiped by the Nabataean peoples of Jordan and other early South Semitic and Arabian peoples. Both names appear in alternate verses in Ugaritic texts. (&quot;In the same way, the name of the goddess&quot; Asherah &quot;appears in alternate verses with&quot; Elath to indicate that both names refer to the same goddess). Ashim-Yahu and Ashim-Beth-El are forms of her name and a variant of her name is also attested in the Hebrew temple in Elephantine in Egypt. The divine name or epithet Ashima-Yaho (haShema YHWH) which is attested in the papyri from the Yahweh temple of Elephantine in Egypt has been connected in both theme and structure with a title of Astarte which appears in the Ugaritic texts as Astarte Name-of-Baal (e.g., KTU (&quot;Keilalphabetische Texte aus Ugarit&quot;) 1.16.vi.56).

According to the Talmud, the Ashima idol took the form of a &quot;bald sheep&quot; (possibly a goat or ram), while Rabbi Saadia Gaon explains that it was in the shape of a cat. Rabbi Elias Levita writes that Ashima was a monkey-shaped idol.

<text>Gergovia was a Gaulish town in modern Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes in the upper part of the basin of the Allier, near present-day Clermont-Ferrand. It was the capital of the Averni. The city of Gergovia had strong walls and was located on a giant raised plateau surrounded by hills.

It was the chief town (oppidum) of the Arverni and the site of the Battle of Gergovia in 52 BC. The battle was fought between a Roman Republic army, led by proconsul Julius Caesar, and Gallic forces led by Vercingetorix. Caesar marched south with six legions to take the hill town of Gergovia. The Gauls won the battle, which led to increased cavalry support for Vercingetorix&#x27;s campaign for future battles. This was a significant failure in Gallia for Caesar and the Roman army.

<text>The Battle of Gergovia took place in 52 BC in Gaul at Gergovia, the chief oppidum (fortified town) of the Arverni. The battle was fought between a Roman Republican army, led by proconsul Julius Caesar, and Gallic forces led by Vercingetorix, who was also the Arverni chieftain. The Romans attempted to besiege Gergovia, but miscommunication ruined the Roman plan. The Gallic cavalry counterattacked the confused Romans and sent them to flight, winning the battle.

The site is identified with Merdogne, since renamed Gergovie, a village located on a hill within the town of La Roche-Blanche, near Clermont-Ferrand, in south central France. Some walls and earthworks still survive from the pre-Roman Iron Age. The battle is well known in France as an example of a Gallic victory.

==Prelude==
As with much of the conflict between Rome and Gaul in the first century BC, information about this battle comes principally from Julius Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic War&quot; (). There are no surviving Gallic accounts.

Vercingetorix had earlier been expelled from Gergovia, the capital of the Arverni, by its government. In winter 53 BC, while Caesar was gathering his forces for a strike against the Gauls, Vercingetorix came back to Gergovia but was now supported by the Arverni, his people. Caesar states that he was left with a difficult decision. He could have kept his forces safe over the winter, but would have shown Roman weakness in defending its allies the Aedui and thus losing their support. However, he chose to bring Vercingetorix to open battle but risked running out of supplies.

Leaving two legions and all of his baggage train behind in Agedincum, Caesar led the remaining legions to Gergovia. His sieges of Vellaunodunum, Genabum, and Noviodunum en route caused Vercingetorix to march to meet Caesar in open battle at Noviodunum, which Caesar won. Caesar then besieged and captured Avaricum and resupplied there. After resting his forces at Avaricum, he sent his top legate, Titus Labienus, with four legions north; this to keep the northern Gauls from interfering with his campaign against the Arverni.

Caesar then set out in the direction of Gergovia, which Vercingetorix was probably able to guess easily once he had remarked his direction. The heights of Gergovia stand 360 metres (1200 feet) above the plain that they overlook. It is a plateau that is 1500 metres long (0.9 mi) by 700 metres (0.4 mi) wide. It was an advantageous place to hold, as there was only one way in, and a small body of troops could hold the entrance to the place.

Vercingetorix therefore crossed the powerful river Elave (now Allier, a tributary to the Loire) at Nevers, and started marching up and down the bank, mirroring Caesar&#x27;s movements and destroying all the bridges to keep him from crossing, the purpose presumably being to destroy part of his force as he attempted to cross. Realizing Vercingetorix&#x27;s plan, Caesar resolved to trick him and cross under his very nose.

Caesar one night camped near the town of Varennes-sur-Allier, where there had previously been a bridge before Vercingetorix had destroyed it. That night, he divided his force into two parts, one part being two thirds of the force, the other being one third of the force. He ordered the larger force to march in six corps as if it were really the full army of six legions. He then ordered it to continue its march south. Vercingetorix, duped, took the bait and followed this part of the force.

Caesar, with the two legions still at Varennes, speedily rebuilt the bridge that had been present there. He then sent for the other force, which the next day stole a march on Vercingetorix and completed a junction with the original force, and crossed the rebuilt bridge. Realizing that he had been duped, Vercingetorix set out south to beat Caesar to Gergovia.

==Battle==
Five days later Caesar reached Gergovia, the first march being short because most of the troops were tired after marching up the river and back and the last march because the legions arrived at the town. Realizing that its mountainous location made a frontal assault risky, he decided to rely on his superior siege tactics. Upon arriving, Caesar discovered that there was a small hill that the Gauls held that was essential to their holding Gergovia itself. From there, they were able to provide water, grain, and forage.

Caesar took this in a night raid and swiftly stationed two legions there. He then linked it to his main camp by digging a double trench, twelve feet (3.6 metres) wide, with a parapet. The result was a barrier that kept the Gauls from their supplies, which they needed desperately. They were forced to subsist on the meager stream that supplied water to Gergovia itself.

The loyalty of the Aedui to Rome was not entirely stable. Caesar suggests in his writing that Aeudui leaders were both bribed with gold and sent misinformation by emissaries of Vercingetorix. Caesar had agreed with the Aedui that 10,000 men would protect his line of supplies. Vercingetorix convinced the chief, Convictolitavis, who had been made chief of the tribe by Caesar, to order the same men to join him upon their arrival at the oppidum. They attacked the Romans who were accompanying their supply train, leaving Caesar in an embarrassing position.

His rations threatened, Caesar took four legions from the siege, surrounded the Aedui army, and defeated it. The pro-Roman faction retook control of the Aedui leadership, and Caesar returned to Gergovia with 10,000 pro-Roman Aedui horsemen. The two legions that he had left to continue the siege had been hard-pressed to keep Vercingetorix&#x27;s much larger force at bay.

Caesar realized that his siege would fail unless he could get Vercingetorix off the high ground. He used one legion as a decoy while the rest moved onto better ground, capturing three Gallic camps in the process. He then ordered a general retreat to lure Vercingetorix off the high ground. However, the order was not heard by most of Caesar&#x27;s force. Instead, spurred on by the ease with which they captured the camps, they pressed on toward the town and mounted a direct assault on it, exhausting themselves. The Romans were largely unable to escalade over the walls of Gergovia, lacking ladders. The Aedui arrived to support the Romans; however the Romans mistook them for enemies at first, proceeding to attack them. Caesar could do little more than cover the retreat.

The noise of the assault alerted Vercingetorix, who arrived and saw the Roman and Aedui in dissension just beneath the walls of Gergovia. Vercingetorix then led a cavalry charge that crushed the Roman lines. Then the warriors left their horses and joined the infantry in their fight against the Romans, who soon had suffered heavy casualties. Caesar&#x27;s work records 46 centurions and 700 legionaries as losses. Modern historians are skeptical; the depiction of the battle as a rout, and one where there were 20,000-40,000 allied Roman soldiers deployed, leads to suspicion that Caesar was downplaying the casualty figures, even if his figures were excluding losses among allied auxiliaries.

==Aftermath==

Given his losses, Caesar ordered a retreat. In the wake of the battle, Caesar lifted his siege and retreated from the Arverni lands northeastwards in the direction of Aedui territory. Vercingetorix pursued Caesar&#x27;s army, intent on destroying it. Because of this, Caesar had to quickly withdraw his army from Galia. Meanwhile, Labienus had finished his campaign in the north and marched back to Agedincum, Caesar&#x27;s base in the centre of Gaul. After linking up with Labienus&#x27;s corps, Caesar marched his united army from Agedincum to confront Vercingetorix&#x27;s victorious army. The two armies met in the Battle of the Vingeanne, Caesar won the subsequent victory. Caesar then pursued Vercingetorix and the remnant of his army to Alesia where Caesar laid siege to and eventually won the Battle of Alesia, a decisive victory over Vercingetorix.

Even under Roman control, Gergovia continued to be an influential stronghold for decades. In AD 10–20, the local capital was moved to Augustonemetum, and Gergovia&#x27;s importance declined.

==Legacy==
Emperor Napoleon III was a patron of archaeology and funded research into France&#x27;s Gallic past, including the battles of Gergovia and Alesia. As a result of the sponsored dig at Gergovia, the town of Merdogne, the closest to the commonly agreed likely site of the battle, was renamed to Gergovie in honor of its past in 1865. Interest has continued since the 1800s. On the plateau where the battle occurred, the Gergovie Monument was constructed in 1900 in honor of the event. An archaeological dig in the 1990s discovered what they believe to be the trench that Caesar describes being dug between the two Roman camps as well as various Roman artifacts from the period. A new museum was constructed from 2015–2019 dedicated to the battle, the &quot;Musée de Gergovie&quot;; the museum opened in October 2019.

The famous French comic &quot;Asterix&quot; loosely references the battle in the 1967 book &quot;Asterix and the Chieftain&#x27;s Shield&quot;.

<doc id="1048505" wikidata="Q452017" url="?curid=1048505" title="Francisco de Paula Santander">
<text>Francisco José de Paula Santander y Omaña (April 2, 1792 – May 6, 1840) was a Neogranadine military and political leader who served as Vice-President of Gran Colombia between 1819 and 1826, and was later elected by Congress as the President of the Republic of New Granada between 1832 and 1837. Santander played a pivotal role in the Colombian War of Independence being one of the main leaders of the Patriot forces and helped lead the Patriot Army alongside Simón Bolívar to victory. He&#x27;s often credited with creating the legal foundations for democracy in Colombia, as well as creating the country&#x27;s first system of public education. For these reasons he is considered a National Hero in Colombia and has thus commonly been known as &quot;The Man of the Laws&quot; (&quot;El Hombre de las Leyes&quot;) as well as the &quot;Organizer of Victory&quot; (&quot;El Organizador de la Victoria&quot;).

Francisco de Paula Santander was born into a wealthy criollo family in Villa del Rosario, in the Viceroyalty of New Granada and spent most of his formative years there. In 1805 he left his home to continue his education in the Viceregal capital of Santa Fe de Bogotá, while finishing his studies on July 20, 1810 he joined in the revolutionary fervor that would be movement for New Granadan Independence. At the age of 18 Santander abandoned his studies to begin his military career fighting for the Patriot cause against the Royalists initially with the Centralists but switched sides and became an officer in the army of the Federalist United Provinces of New Granada.

In 1813 he would be wounded and captured during the civil war between the Federalists and the Centralists, but was released to serve under Manuel del Castillo y Rada and Simón Bolívar in the defense of the Cucuta Valley from the Royalists. For the next 3 years Santander defended the valley from Royalist Incursion until he was defeated at the Battle of Cachirí during the Spanish Reconquest of New Granada. With the collapse of the first republic, he fled to the Casanare Province and joined forces with Venezuelan Patriot forces there first under the command of José Antonio Páez, and then joined Bolívar&#x27;s forces in Guayana in 1817. Under the command of Bolívar during the 1819 Campaign to Liberate New Granada, Santander led his troops valiantly at the battles of Paya, Gameza, Vargas Swamp, and at Boyacá liberating his homeland from Spanish Rule.

With the creation of Gran Colombia in December 1819, Santander was initially chosen as Vice-President of Cundinamarca, in 1821 at the congress of Cúcuta he was elected as Vice-President of Gran Colombia with Bolívar as President. For the next 6 years, with Bolívar away on campaign, Santander became acting president of the new nation, using his administrative skills to create the foundations for the new republic. In 1827 political differences between him and Bolívar led to a rupture in their relationship, culminating in 1828 when Bolívar accused of him of having masterminded a plot to assassinate him. While no evidence was ever found to corroborate this, Santander was sentenced to the death however this punishment was changed and Santander was instead stripped of his titles and positions and sent into exile where he would spend next 4 years in Europe and in the United States. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia, in 1832 the newly established congress of the Republic of New Granada elected him as President where he served his term from 1832 to 1837. After the end of his presidency he was elected as a representative for Bogotá in the chamber of representatives, however his health began to rapidly decline resulting in his death on May 6, 1840.

==Early life (1792-1810)==
Francisco José de Paula Santander y Omaña was born in Villa del Rosario, in the Pamplona Province of the Viceroyalty of New Granada not far from Cúcuta, on April 2, 1792. 11 days later on April 13 he was baptized at the Santa Ana chapel in Villa del Rosario. His parents were Juan Agustín Santander Colmenares who was governor of the rural town of San Faustino de los Ríos as well as a cocoa and coffee plant grower, his mother; Antonia Manuela de Omaña Rodríguez. Both were descendants of aristocratic Spanish families who had settled in the New Kingdom of Granada. The couple had two children before Santander, a boy Pedro José and a girl Josefa Teresa who died in their infancy. 2 years after Santander was born the couple had another girl Josefa Dolores. Santander grew up in a family that was both socially and economically privileged and that had a large influence in the region where he was born through the ownership of various haciendas and properties.

He received his primary education in a private school in Villa del Rosario, and upon learning how to read became a voracious reader combing through the various books his father&#x27;s library possessed. He was also taught Latin by a local clergyman. Even at a young age Santander noticed how there was considerable lack of schools for public education as well as trained teachers in the New Kingdom of Granada. Discrimination based on social class often meant that the majority of the population was excluded from a getting even a primary education, and even those who did receive one were taught a very basic curriculum that was often a victim of censorship by colonial authorities. This left a lasting impact on Santander who later in life as President would implement a policy of promoting creating public schools with trained teachers operated by the government for the general population.

As Santander&#x27;s family was an aristocratic one, it was common for the family to send their children to receive further education in the viceregal capital, Santa Fé. In the capital there were essentially 2 career paths offered by higher education institutions, those being Law or Religion. Juan Agustin Santander then asked his brother-in-law, the priest Nicolás Mauricio de Omaña y Rodriguez, to try to get the young Francisco de Paula a scholarship at the Colegio de San Bartolomé. Santander now 13, was sent by his father Juan Agustin to Santa Fe in 1805 and enrolled in the Colegio Mayor y Seminario de San Bartolomé.

 After arriving in Santa Fe, the young Francisco de Paula lived in the Colegio de San Bartolomé where his maternal uncle lived at that time, the priest Nicolás Mauricio de Omaña, who occupied the position of vice-rector of that establishment. Nicolás Mauricio de Omaña was a well known figure in the city, and was friends with many of the enlightened and cultured criollos of Santa Fe. His teachings had a large influence over the young Santander who wrote in his memoirs that his uncle had taught him &quot; To know the justice, convenience and need for these countries to shake Spanish domination.&quot;
This sentiment was shared by many of the professors at the Colegio Mayor de San Bartolomé who would also play a big role in the independence movement. By 1808, Santander had received his secondary education and began to study law at the University of Santo Tomás. The education he received at the Colegio de San Bartolomé left a big impact on Santander. The legal doctrines extracted from the Roman, Spanish and Indian laws shaped his thinking. This helped him to later organize Colombia with exemplary method and order.

==Military career==
 As a young law student, Santander was finishing his studies at the University of Santo Tomás when he witnessed first hand the events of the Revolt of July 20, 1810, which would be later known as the cry of independence, where the criollos of Santa Fe revolted against to the Viceregal government of Viceroy Antonio José Amar y Borbón and began the establishment of juntas in 1810, which began the process of independence in New Granada. At the age of 18, Santander abandoned his studies and enlisted on October 26, 1810, as a sub-lieutenant in the National Guard (&quot;Guardias Nacionales&quot;) infantry battalion as a flag-bearer. In 1811 the Government of Santa Fe, seeking to impose their hegemony over the other provinces that had begun to form their own independent juntas, deployed a number of military expeditions to incorporate these provinces. The young Santander would be part of a military expedition of some 300 men under the command of cartagenian captain Manuel del Castillo y Rada to the Mariquita province. This expedition would culminate successfully with the Mariquita province being successfully annexed into the Cundinamarca province, with this his unit returned to Santa Fe in June 1811. After returning to Santa Fe Santander was assigned to the Military Inspection Unit of Santa Fe. In January 1812 general Antonio Baraya returned to Santa Fe after having defeated the Royalist forces who had tried to reconquer the independent cities of the Cauca Valley in the northern part of the Popayán Province, as a result of this Santander was made his secretary on January 17, 1812.

That same year a conflict would arise between the 2 main groups of New Granadan Patriots; the Centralists in Santa Fe under the leadership of Antonio Nariño and the Federalists under the leadership of Camilo Torres who had set up a federal congress in Tunja, this congress had gathered delegates from 5 provinces in New Granada to form a confederation through the Federation Act of 1811 creating the United Provinces of New Granada. Nariño refused to recognize the authority of this Union and thus dispatched a force under the command of general Antonio Baraya to dissolve the congress in Tunja and reincoporate these provinces back under the authority of Santa Fe. Santander as Baraya&#x27;s secretary, was part of this force as they set out in April 1812, Baraya however along with all his officers including Santander would defect to the Federalist United Provinces of New Granada and recognized the authority of the Federal congress. Santander would then be promoted two times in quick succession by the Federal congress, being promoted to lieutenant on May 25, 1812 and to captain of June 1, 1812.

The tensions between the Federalists and Centralists would eventually burst into a civil war in December 1812 when the two armies faced each other at the Battle of Ventaquemada where the Federalists turned back another Centralist attempt to advance on Tunja forcing them to retreat back to Santa Fe. The Federalist Army while victorious did not pursue Centralists immediately, and waited a week before doing so as they reached Santa Fe in January 1813. At the Battle of San Victorino on January 9, 1813 the Federalists encircled the city taking key vantage points such as Monserrate from the west while penetrating the city through the San Victorino neighborhood. Despite the Federalists having a numerical advantage, Nariño had successfully mounted an effective defense since the Federalists hadn&#x27;t pressed their advantage after Ventaquemada resulting in a resounding defeat for the Federalists. Captain Santander was wounded and taken prisoner along with 23 other officers as a result of the battle, his wounds were so grave that he himself said: &quot;That only a miracle of Providence could have saved me.&quot;

Santander would remain in captivity for just a month as he was later exchanged in a prisoner swap when the Centralists and Federalists signed a truce ending the conflict as both sides became alarmed by the Royalist threat in the south and north of the country. After this exchange he arrived in the federal capital of Tunja on February 10, 1813, where congress promoted him to the rank of sergeant major.

Cúcuta Campaign

After receiving his promotion, Santander was then assigned to the 5th Battalion of the Union under the command of now Colonel Castillo y Rada, with orders to march at once to the city of Cúcuta in order to repel an imminent Royalist Invasion from Venezuela. He arrived in the valley in March 1813 after the neogranadine victory at the Battle of Cúcuta had repelled the Royalist Invasion. This victory had been the work of exiled Venezuelan Colonel Simón Bolívar, this would be the first time the two would meet. Santander later participated in a cross-border incursion into Venezuela on April 13 when he and his men under Castillo y Rada attacked the remaining Royalist forces that had been repelled in the Battle of Cúcuta at La Grita. Santander took command of the 1st and 3rd companies of the 5th battalion of the Union and attacked the royalist left flank. The attack was a success and allowed the patriots to take control of the towns of La Grita and Bailadores. Santander&#x27;s actions in the battle earned him a commendation by part of Bolívar in his official report to the Federal congress. However he and Castillo y Rada would come into conflict with Bolívar&#x27;s plans to conduct an invasion to liberate Venezuela, with Santander and Castillo y Rada argued that deploying the New Granadan army across the border on a liberation campaign would deprive the republic of its forces necessary for its defense. The Federal Congress in Tunja however would promote Bolívar to general and authorize the expedition disregarding both their opinions on the matter.

After receiving confirmation that Bolívar would indeed begin his campaign to liberate Venezuela, Castillo y Rada resigned his command in protest and returned to Cartagena where he was named military commander there. This left his army, the 5th Line Battalion, now under the command of Manuel Ricaurte who also resigned leaving the command of the troops to Santander. Santander did not accompany Bolívar in his campaign but instead remained per Bolívar&#x27;s command in Cúcuta to defend it from a possible threat to Bolívar&#x27;s rear. The circumstances as to why Santander remained in Cúcuta and did not accompany Bolívar are controversial, in a letter to the president of the Federal congress he states.Stopped my march to the army of Venezuela for the commissions I received from the supreme congress, before the term of fifteen days was fulfilled, for which General Bolívar allowed me to come to Cúcuta from La Grita to carry the particular interests of the 5th battalion that I then commanded accidentally, the command of the Cúcuta valley fell on me by chance, which I never requested.This account coincides with the that of Colombian historian Jose Manuel Restrepo who wrote that: To defend the valleys of Cúcuta, he left two hundred and ninety men commanded by Sergeant Major Francisco de Paula Santander, of the militias of Cartagena, who had been claimed the Government of that province. Given these provisions, Bolívar extended his campaign headquarters to give independence and freedom to Venezuela, his beloved homeland&quot;.However, another account provided by Bolívar&#x27;s Irish aid-de-camp Daniel Florence O&#x27;Leary describes that there was serious confrontation between the two with Bolívar in a severe tone ordering Santander to &quot;march at once&quot; barking at him &quot;You have no choice in the matter! March! Either you shoot me or by God, I will certainly shoot you.&quot; This account of events has been called into question due to the fact the O&#x27;Leary was not present at the time of these events and wouldn&#x27;t arrive in Venezuela to join Bolívar until 1818 some 5 years later.

On May 14, 1813, Bolívar departed for Venezuela with the army of the United Provinces and would begin what would be later known as the Admirable Campaign. In Cúcuta, for the defense of this strategic border city 21-year-old Sergeant Major Santander had been officially left with 80 soldiers, 72 working muskets, and 1800 paper cartridges, this force would be later augmented to around 200 with troops recruited from the area. Over the next months Santander would wage a brilliant campaign in defending the city from Royalist Invasions dispatched from their stronghold in Maracaibo. He often had to do this at a numerical disadvantage as well as with a limited supply of munitions. He fought off these attempts at Loma Pelada on August 13, San Faustino on September 30, and Limoncito and Capacho on October 6 and 10, however due to his small force and limited number of munitions he was unable to pursue these attackers allowing them to regroup in Venezuela.

From October 10 to 18, a large Royalist force under the command of Bartolomé Lizón invaded the valley from four different points with 1,300 troops in what would be known as the Battle of Llano de Carrillo. With only 260 troops, Santander convened a war council with his officers and realizing that their position was untenable given the number of enemy troops, ordered the evacuation of Cúcuta and began a withdrawal towards Pamplona positioning himself in an area known as Llanura de Carrillo. Lizón was informed of this by Royalist sympathizers when he took Cúcuta and attacked Santander&#x27;s forces on October 18 in only what could be described as a massacre. Of the 260 men Santander had, only 50 survived, many Patriot prisoners were executed by order of Lizon along with their supporters in Cúcuta and Pamplona including many of Santander&#x27;s own family members.

The defeat at the Llanura de Carrillo and the loss of Cúcuta was bitter event for Santander he wrote to Congress &quot;asking for a court martial&quot; which the congress refused, he then asked &quot;that he be removed from the army for his failures&quot; which was refused as well. In Tunja congress named Gregor MacGregor as the commander of the Army of the North and dispatched him immediately, Santander would be his second-in-command. In early 1814, this army waged a successful counteroffensive to reconquer the Cúcuta Valley and forced Lizon back into Venezuela. For his actions during the counteroffensive, congress promoted Santander to Colonel on May 31, 1814. MacGregor would not remain commander for long however as he resigned his commission due to serious health problems.

=== Reconquest of New Granada ===
In 1814, Ferdinand VII of Spain deployed an expeditionary force to reconquer Venezuela and New Granada, this force of over 10,600 men was under the command of General Pablo Morillo, a veteran of Peninsular War who had fought alongside the Duke of Wellington. They departed Spain in early 1815 arriving off the coast of Venezuela in early April, in August he began a campaign to Reconquer New Granada, by laying a 105 day siege to the republican stronghold of Cartagena. After the city fell in December of that year Morillo began a march into the interior following the Magdalena River, this was done in tandem with General Sámano&#x27;s forces from the south and Colonel Sebastian de la Calzada&#x27;s forces marching from Venezuela. In July 1815 prior to his siege of Cartagena, Morillo landed his force in the royalist province of Santa Marta while most of his force would participate in the siege he also raised a division of 1,000 men known as &quot;Volante&quot; under the command of brigadier Pedro Ruiz de Porras, who would take the vital river port of Mompox, doing so that same month. Porras&#x27;s next objective would be to take the city of Ocaña which was along the main route to Santa Fe. The government of the United Provinces alarmed by this ordered Colonel Santander to march from Cúcuta to the city of Ocaña and recruit a force capable of retaking Mompox. Santander arrived in Ocaña in late July with 200 lancers and 200 fusiliers the government also sent him 150 troops under the command of colonel José Maria Vergara y Lozano as reinforcements. At Ocaña, by August Santander had a force of around 500 men, but a plan to attack Mompox was considered unfeasible as Porras had received more reinforcements from Morillo and had fortified the port. To make matters worst Colonel Calzada invaded New Granada entering the Casanare Province and defeating general Urdaneta&#x27;s defense forces there allowing him to march north towards the Cúcuta valley on November 25 and quickly took the provincial capital of Pamplona on the 26. Santander now found himself caught between two forces, with Morillo&#x27;s forces to the north and Calzada to south, on December 22, 1815 he skillfully withdrew his men south through an abandoned path that led to Girón eventually arriving in Piedecuesta. There he was able to meet up with Custodio Garcia Rovira who had been named commander of the Army of the North, where they would attempt to defend the main route that led to the capital of the United Provinces.

While Santander wanted to position the army more towards Bucaramanga, Garcia Rovira overruled him and instead placed the army in a defensive position on the Páramo de Cachirí an area in between Bucaramanga and Pamplona. Sebastian de la Calzada&#x27;s army continued their march toward Bucaramanga and met the New Granadan army at the Battle of Cachirí on February 21 and 22. The New Granadan army was no match for the troops of Spanish Army, the republicans received a heavy defeat, of the 2,000 strong army that Rovira had commanded, only 300 were able to escape including Rovira and Santander. With the road to Santa Fe practically open, the Spanish continued their march. Rovira was then relieved of command with French born Brigadier General Manuel de Serviez now in command of what remained of the republican army. Serviez had been ordered by the republican government to retreat with what was left of the army to the south where the rest of the government had fled, however Serviez decided against this and decided to take the army and withdraw towards the plains of Casanare where he could reorganize the army and fight a war of guerillas against the Spanish.

The republican government then ordered Santander to prevent Serviez from doing this however, he too disobeyed this order and agreed with Serviez&#x27;s plan. During their retreat they were pursued by Spanish Colonel Miguel de la Torre who was able to catch up to them at times, such as at the Negro River crossing where the Spanish attacked the patriots during the ir crossing at the Negro River. The battle was a disaster with most of the army still unable to cross Serviez was forced to cut the bridge which allowed the few on the other side to escape. Serviez&#x27;s dramatic retreat to the plains of Casanare finally concluded when they reached Chire in July 1816 where they were met with General Rafael Urdaneta&#x27;s Venezuelan cavalry. The retreat had saved many of the best of the neogranadine officer corps such as Santander and Jose Maria Cordova, and other offices who would form an important part of the army that would fight in the Liberation Campaign of 1819. The other part of the republican army, who had fled south, would be defeated at the Battle of Cuchilla del Tambo with many of their officers perishing in battle or executed along with almost the entirety of the officials that made up the government of the First Republic.

With that the First Republic ceased to exist, apart from a small area in the plains of Casanare.

===Apure Campaign of 1816===
After arriving in the llanos and joining up with Urdaneta&#x27;s forces, the beleaguered patriot forces withdrew further into the vast plains. In the vast and sparsely populated eastern Llanos of New Granada there were three groups of Patriot forces that operated in the area, although they did so independently of one another. One group was led by Venezuelan Colonel Miguel Valdés, commander of the Casanare troops or army of the East, whose main operations center was located in the town Guasdualito. The second group was commanded by colonel Nepomuceno Moreno, a native of Casanare and the titular governor of Casanare, and the third was the one led by the Venezuelan general Rafael Urdaneta. As mentioned, this last group had received the remains of the neogranadine troops commanded by General Serviez and Colonel Santander after their retreat.

The diverse amount of groups and their leaders led to a chaotic situation akin to anarchy as there was no unified command structure for these troops. In order to solve this Colonel Valdés proposed a meeting between the various leaders in the town of Arauca which lay on the Arauca river on the border of Venezuela and New Granada. Serviez and Urdaneta agreed and sent Santander to the meeting as their representative.

On July 16 the meeting was convened in the town of Arauca where the delegates formed a junta. At the meeting Colonel Valdés expressed the impossibility of continuing his command, given his declining health. The junta then unanimously agreed to appoint Fernando Serrano, former governor of the Pamplona province, as president. The lawyer Francisco Javier Yañez was appointed secretary general minister and Generals Serviez and Rafael Urdaneta as advisors to the civilian government.

The junta then decided to vote on who would be given command of the unified army, with colonel Santander being voted as commander of the army. Santander was commander for 2 months, during his short command the patriots withdrew further east crossing the border into the llanos of Apure in Venezuela as the Spanish penetrated further into the llanos.

In September 1816, Lieutenant Colonel José Antonio Páez would end up taking control of the army, despite his inferior rank, Santander agreed with this decision and followed his orders. Páez assumed control of the army as well as provisional civilian government that was under president Serrano who Páez ordered that he cease his duties. As a result Serviez abd Urdaneta were relieved of their positions as advisors to the government and put back into active duty. Páez then went about reorganizing the army into 3 Cavalry divisions with the 1st division under the command of general Urdaneta, the 2nd division under Serviez, and the 3rd division under the command of Santander.

By the end of September Páez and the &quot;Army of Apure&quot; went on the offensive, they headed for the town of Achaguas where the Spanish army had placed their forces.

On October 8, 1816 the patriot army clashed with the Colonel Francisco Lopez&#x27;s Spanish cavalry at the Battle of El Yagual. Santander and his division fought valiantly in the bloody battle, conducting a violent cavalry charge that threw the enemy into the river. The battle was resounding victory for Páez&#x27;s army of Apure, who captured horses, weapons, and uniforms from the Spanish that were badly needed. Despite the victory tragedy would strike again when General Serviez was murdered only a few weeks after the battle. The death of Serviez left Santander as the most senior Neogranadine officer within the &quot;Army of Apure&quot;. Santander spent the rest of the year fighting under Paesz in the Apure campaign of 1816.

In 1817, the 25 year old Santander requested a passport to travel to Guyana to join General Simón Bolívar&#x27;s forces who had been waging a renewed a campaign against the Spanish forces under Morillo . Bolivar made him part of his general staff as well as his aid-de-camp. For his actions during the Center Campaign of 1818 campaign on July 16, 1818, Bolívar awarded him the &quot;Order of the Liberators,&quot; one month later he was promoted to Brigadier General on August 12, 1818.

=== Liberation Campaign of 1819 ===
&quot;See Main Article: Bolívar&#x27;s campaign to liberate New Granada&quot;

With the war in Venezuela essentially a stalemate by late 1818, Bolívar sought to end the stalemate by shifting his tactics and opening a new front against Morillo by conducting a military operation to invade New Granada which had been firmly under Spanish control since 1816. With the majority of the Royalist Army in Venezuela, and a large contingent of his Patriot army composed of New Granadan exiles eager to liberate their homeland, occupied New Granada seemed like a promising target that could tip the war in his favor. In preparation for this campaign, Bolívar named Santander as &quot;Commander of the Vanguard of the Liberator Army of New Granada&quot; and gave him 1,200 muskets and gave him the task of raising and organizing an army in the eastern plains region of the Casanare Province in New Granada. Santander left the Guayana Region on August 27 arriving in the Casanare Province on November 29, 1818 along with other New Granadan officers who Bolívar had assigned to his command to assist in the creation of the army.

Upon arriving in the province the situation was critical as the Casanare Province, while one of the few regions not under full Spanish control, was a &quot;miserable province, with no resources and no capable men.&quot; The New Granadan Patriot forces in the province were in complete chaos upon his arrival due to infighting and lack of resources especially between the 2 most senior officers, Nonato Perez and Antonio Arredondo, who had been in the province prior to Santander&#x27;s arrival. Santander was able to eventually impose his authority over the two as &quot;his presence inspired confidence, as well as his emphasis in unity in order to solve the situation&quot; his officers began the arduous task of recruiting and training this new army. He also established a provisional government in the name of the previous United Provinces of New Granada, with it being subservient to the previous constitution of 1815, with Casanare as its sole province and Pore as the provisional capital of New Granada and, while at the same time formally establishing its alliance with Venezuela and recognizing Simón Bolívar as captain-general of both the New Granadan and Venezuelan armies on December 18, 1818.

During his time as commander in chief in the &quot;Llanos,&quot; Santander took to the task of establishing supply caches for the army, he also ordered the production of uniforms and 1,000 straw hats. He also set up system of rudimentary logistics for food provisions to keep his troops fed. He imposed strict discipline on his new army through a permanent war council and instituting a system of passports that all soldiers were required to have on their person to control their movements and prevent desertion. By February 1819, Santander along with his officers such as the young Sergeant major Joaquin Paris as well as Lt. Colonels Antonio Obando and Jacinto Lara, were able to build a respectable force of around 1,200 men divided in 2 infantry battalions the &quot;Cazadores Constantes Battalion&quot; and the &quot;First Line Battalion of New Granada&quot; as well as a cavalry contingent recruited from the local population. These efforts did not go unnoticed however, Spanish intelligence had informed Morillo of Santander&#x27;s presence in Casanare since late 1818, Morillo informed the Viceroy of New Granada Juan de Samano as well as the commander of III Division of the Royalist Army tasked with the protection of that kingdom, Colonel Jose Maria Barreiro of Santander&#x27;s presence. In early 1819 Morillo ordered Barreiro to invade Casanare as soon as possible to destroy the possible insurgent threat.

Barreiro crossed the eastern andes with an army of around 1,800 troops in late March 1819 and invaded the province, the Royalist army took the deserted town of Pore on April 9. Santander&#x27;s strategy during this campaign would be one of evasion as he withdraw deeper into the &quot;Llanos&quot; in order to stretch Barreiro&#x27;s supply line as well as exhaust his troops who were not accustomed to the harsh climate of the &quot;Llanos&quot;. This strategy would succeed as the campaign became harsh on the royalist troops who lacked sufficient supplies for a further penetration into the vast &quot;Llanos,&quot; these troops were also subject to ambushes by mobile Patriot troops, and with the rain season only one month way Barreiro decided to withdraw across the andes back into the central New Granada, the withdrawal was complicated further by Santander who ordered a small counteroffensive against the Royalists which further demoralized Barreiro&#x27;s men. On April 17 Barreiro&#x27;s army eventually withdrew back to central New Granada and garrisoned the army in Tunja to wait out the winter rain season, the failure of this campaign was further confirmed when Santander ordered colonel Obando to attack the garrison at La Salina which Barreiro had left behind to cover his retreat with the attack being a victory for the patriots resulting in the capture of the garrison. News of successful defense of the province was sent to Bolívar with Santander stating in his letter dated April 21.Barreiro, general commander of this expedition, has seen with his own eyes that it is not with three or four thousand men that Casanare is conquered, and that it is not with terror that he can erase the feelings of patriotism that her own troops have for freedom of their homeland.In late May, Santander notified Bolívar of his final preparations and the favorability of the local population&#x27;s support for a liberation campaign, he also dispatched one of his officers Colonel Jacinto Lara to Bolívar&#x27;s camp to report these advances in person. Bolívar upon receiving these reports made his decision on May 20, and revealed this plan to his officers on May 23 who agreed to the plan. He then marched his army from their camp in Manteca in the Apure region of Venezuela on May 27, 1819. On June 4 Bolívar&#x27;s army crossed the Arauca river and reached town of Tame on June 12, where he met with Santander&#x27;s forces. At Tame, Bolívar organized the army as well as informed his officers of the military strategy for the campaign. The combined New Granadan and Venezuelan army of around 2,500 troops was named the &quot;Liberator Army of New Granada and Venezuela&quot; comprised two divisions, with Bolívar as commander-in-chief, General Soublette as chief-of-staff, Santander as commander of the vanguard division and General José Antonio Anzoátegui commander of the rearguard division. While at Tame, Bolívar finalized the route the army would take, whilst he originally planned to the route through La Salina de Chita, Santander suggested taking the route that passed through the Parámo de Pisba which was the fastest and least guarded route but also the most difficult and challenging. Bolívar agreed with this suggestion and on July 17 the army left Tame and marched towards Pore in the direction of the eastern andes mountain range. The campaign, conducted during the winter rain season which flooded the Llanos, made marching extremely difficult for the army.

As his division was at the front of the army, the vanguard division was usually one day&#x27;s march ahead of the rest of the army. As a result they often made first contact with Royalist forces such as when they came upon a 300 strong Royalist garrison at Paya on June 27. Santander ordered the commander of the &quot;Cazadores&quot; battalion under Lt. Colonel Antonio Arredondo to attack the Royalist through a flanking maneuver on the right while he would lead the rest of the vanguard and march down the main road to support him. After a few hours of combat the Spanish forces withdrew and the Patriot Forces continued onward, however that same day June 27 Bolívar, one-days march behind, sent a letter informing Santander of the exhaustion of the Venezuelan troops who were also skeptical of the success of the campaign. Bolívar considered calling the campaign off, however Santander responded by stating he preferred &quot;a certain death in the planned operation against the enemy then retreating back to the llanos&quot; this sentiment was also supported by the officers of the vanguard division as well as General Anzoátegui. The determination demonstrated by Santander and his officers inspired confidence in Bolívar and the campaign continued.

From July 1 to 6 the army began their grueling crossing of the Andes Mountains through the Paramo de Pisba enduring extremely harsh conditions and its limits tested as they endured cold temperatures and constant rain storms further complicated by the abundant lack of uniforms the soldiers causing many to perish. Santander and his division arrived on the other side on July 5 reaching the town of Socha in the Tunja Province, with the rearguard arriving on July 6. The army was in a sorry state as it lost almost all of its horses, cattle, as well a number of men and equipment with Santander describing that &quot;the army was a dying body.&quot; Over the next few days elements of Santander&#x27;s Vanguard division were deployed to take the surrounding towns of Corrales and Gameza, there they skirmished with the forces of Barreiro&#x27;s royalist army on July 10. On July 11, a larger battle occurred, the Battle of Gámeza, where Santander led his division in an attempt to take the Gámeza bridge. As his forces were at the front of the army they bore the brunt of the Spanish musketry preventing them from taking the bridge, 

At Gámeza on July 11, Santander himself would be lightly wounded as a Royalist musketball grazed his neck with Sergeant Major Paris urgently coming to his side to review his wound. This battle would also result in the death of the commander of his Cazadores infantry Battalion, Colonel Arredondo, who would be replaced by Joaquin Paris now promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. On July 25 he participated in the Battle of Vargas Swamp leading his Vanguard Division on the left flank trying take Picacho Hill, the fight was difficult as they were pushed back 3 times by Spanish King&#x27;s 1st infantry battalion. After 5 hours of grueling combat Santander supported by Colonel James Rooke of the British Legion led a desperate bayonet charge that finally dislodged the Spanish off the hill, this was done as Colonel Juan José Rondón led his lancers in an uphill charge on Cangrejo Hill resulting in a hardfought Patriot victory. Of the battle Santander later stated that:The glory of Vargas belongs to Colonel Rondon and Lieutenant Colonel Carvajal, both from the plains of Venezuela. To no one else was it granted but to them, on that glorious day those renown brave men were given honorable mention in the army bulletin.

After the victory at Vargas Swamp, the Patriot Army tricked the Royalists by conducting a feint march back to Venezuela while on that same night they conducted a countermarch allowing them capture the important city of Tunja behind the backs of the Royalists who now had their main line of communication with the capital Santa Fe, severed, Santander commented that this action &quot;without dispute what sealed the success of our campaign&quot;. Barreiro hurriedly marched towards Tunja but informed of its capture, took the alternate route around the city through Motavita during a night march in the rain in order to gain the lead on the race to the capital. On August 7 at 9am Bolívar informed by his spies of Barreiro&#x27;s march, observed the Royalist army march towards the Boyacá Bridge, he then ordered Santander and Anzoátegui to intercept the Royalists before they could cross the bridge. At the Battle of Boyacá, Santander would play a pivotal role as his men spotted the Royalist Vanguard force at the nearby &quot;Casa de Teja&quot; guarding the bridge as they waited for the bulk of the Royalist Army to arrive. The two forces spotted each other and exchanged fire with the Royalists charging after the Patriots thinking they were a small observation force. Santander marching down the&quot;Camino Real&quot; with the rest of the patriot vanguard upon seeing this unfold ordered Lieutenant Colonel Joaquín París commander of the &quot;Cazadores&quot; Battalion to attack the Royalist forces at the &quot;Casa de Teja&quot;. The &quot;Cazadores&quot; forced the Royalists to fall back towards the bridge, eventually being forced across the other side as the two forces faced each other. Santander then ordered Colonel Antonio Bejar to take some forces down the river and cross it in order to attack the Spanish vanguard from the rear. While this was happening Anzoátegui marching behind Santander, spotted the main bulk of Royalist Army and immediately attacked causing panic and decimating the main force. Bejar&#x27;s forces eventually managed to ford the river and were approaching the rear of the Royalist vanguard force, the two forces engaged in battle. When this occurred Santander led a bayonet charge across the bridge with a company from the &quot;First Line Battalion of New Granada&quot; to deliver the final blow ending the battle around 4:30pm as the Patriot Army decimated the Royalist Army, culminating the campaign.

Santander along with the rest of the Patriot army entered triumphantly into Bogotá on August 10, the Viceroy and the rest of the Spanish government had fled the city after receiving new of their defeat at the Boyacá Bridge. In recognition of his actions during these battle, 11 days later he was promoted to the rank of General of Division, the equivalent of a modern major general. During the victory ceremony that was held in Bogotá on September 18, he was paid tribute to alongside the other generals of the army and awarded along with all those who participated in the campaign the &quot;Cross of Boyacá&quot; (Modern equivalent: Order of Boyacá).

== Santander&#x27;s Presidency ==
With most of New Granada liberated from Spanish rule, on August 10 Bolívar named Santander as military governor and commander of all forces in the Province of Santa Fe. On September 11 he became Vice President of New Granada and was given &quot;all the broad powers in all branches of government&quot; Bolívar also gave him the task &quot;of liberating the country from Spanish domination at all costs.&quot; Shortly after Bolívar departed for Angostura to propose the union of liberated territories of Venezuela and New Granada to the congress there.

After Bolívar left, on October 10, 1819 Santander ordered the execution of 38 Spanish officers captured at the Battle of Boyacá, among them Colonel José María Barreiro. These executions caused a great deal controversy, as Bolívar had the month prior sent a letter to Viceroy Sámano in Cartagena proposing a prisoner exchange. Santander attempted to justify the executions by stating that the presence of these prisoners in the capital presented a threat as the city was lightly defended as Bolívar had taken the rest of the army with him to Venezuela and other units had been deployed to the Caribbean coast where the Spanish still had control. Another justification was that the executions were carried out in accordance with the War of death and revenge for the executions of the generation of 1810 that were executed during Morillo&#x27;s regime of terror during the Reconquest of New Granada in 1816. While in private Bolívar, expressed his sadness and disapproval through a letter he wrote in Pamplona to Santander, he refrained from doing so publicly. The ramifications of these executions would continue to be a stain on Santander&#x27;s career for the rest of his life. 
On December 17, 1819 the delegates of the Congress of Angostura approved the fundamental law that united New Granada and Venezuela and established the Republic of Colombia(referred to as Gran Colombia). The territories of New Granada and Venezuela became the departments of Cundinamarca and Venezuela, with Santander as Vice President of Cundinamarca and Juan Germán Roscio and Vice President of Venezuela.

Come 1820 Vice President Santander dealt with crippling fiscal situation that the department suffered from, as commerce and trade were at a standstill and state funds depleted. With great difficulty he managed to administer and send funds to the army that was currently on campaign in the Caribbean coast under Colonels Jose Maria Cordova and Hermógenes Maza. .

Midway through 1820, Santander attempted to resign as Vice president and return to active duty in the army, Bolívar however refused to accept his resignation considering that no one else could replace him and that no other person had the merits or know how to occupy such an important position. Santander tried again to resign this time in the hopes of receiving a diplomatic position in Chile or in Argentina however Bolívar again refused to accept it.

===First administration===
In October 1821, after the Constitution of Cúcuta was proclaimed, Santander was elected by the newly gathered Congress as Vice President of Gran Colombia, in a heated election, where he overcame the other strong candidate for the post, the former leader of Cundinamarca, General Antonio Nariño, by a margin of 38 to 19 votes. Santander was placed in charge of the government of New Granada, while Bolívar returned to Venezuela to propose the union of Venezuela and New Granada to the Venezuelan congress.

Since General Simón Bolívar, despite being the President of the new republic, decided to continue leading the republican forces in their southern campaigns in Ecuador and Peru, the office of President of Gran Colombia was entrusted to General Santander. The Constitution mandated that the vice-president remain in Bogotá in such cases and handle the functions of the executive branch of government. As acting ruler, Santander had to deal with a grave economic crisis—that was one of the direct consequences of a decade of constant warfare—pockets of royalist sentiment in Gran Colombian society, supplying the logistics of the continuing military operations, administrative and legislative reactivation, and the establishment of internal political divisions. During this period Santander definitely moved towards a centralist political philosophy and upheld the legitimacy of the Cucutá Constitution against federalist and regionalist pretensions. Santander also made a concerted move toward free trade. He removed and reduced many taxes which had been left in place from Spanish rule and opened ports to all foreign nations. He also created incentives for immigrants, including expedited naturalization—applicants were allowed to leave the country for up to six months without interrupting their legally &quot;required&quot; stay—and land grants. Bolívar undid many of Santander&#x27;s actions after he returned in 1826 and reassumed his position as president, often ruling through emergency decree.

==Political differences==

Initially, Santander and Bolívar were considered close friends and allies, but gradually political and ideological differences emerged. It is considered by modern scholars that Santander believed in the sanctity of constitutional government and in the rule of law, perhaps to a greater degree than Bolívar, who would have allegedly thought that those concerns were secondary to what he perceived as the actual needs and solutions that historical circumstances demanded, and thus could be subject to flexibility .

In 1826, when the first Venezuelan uprising occurred, Santander and Bolívar came to disagree about how to handle the situation. Santander believed that the rebels, led by José Antonio Páez and federalist sympathizers, should be punished or at least made to openly submit to the established constitutional order. When Bolívar, who had returned from Peru and reassumed his executive powers, arranged for an amnesty and placed Páez as supreme military chief of the department of Venezuela, Santander felt that the central government&#x27;s authority and the rule of law were being undermined by the constitutional President himself in a personalist manner.

Santander also disagreed with Bolívar&#x27;s attempt to promote a reform of the 1821 constitution before it was legally permitted (the constitution stated that ten years had to go by), and especially with Bolívar&#x27;s attempted nationwide implementation of the constitution that he had previously drafted for Bolivia, which among other provisions called for a lifelong presidency with the ability to select a direct successor. In Santander&#x27;s opinion, this could place the country dangerously close to monarchism .

In 1828, growing internal conflicts continued. Santander was elected as one of the delegates to the Ocaña constitutional convention, during which both his supporters and other opposition political factions blocked Bolívar&#x27;s attempts at reform. This led to the sudden exit of many of the delegates supporting Bolívar, who disagreed with the Convention&#x27;s potential outcome.

These events eventually led Bolívar to declare himself dictator in August of that year, while the office of the vice president was abolished.

Santander and his political sympathizers felt that this act betrayed liberalism and the ideology of the Age of Enlightenment, some even comparing Bolívar to Napoleon or Julius Caesar.

On September 25, 1828, Bolívar escaped an assassination attempt. Among those blamed was Santander who, in a quick military trial headed by General Rafael Urdaneta, was originally sentenced to die without specific proof of his participation in the event, but Bolívar pardoned him, commuted his sentence and ordered his exile.

Even today, the details are not totally clear and the evidence appears to be inconclusive. Some historians consider that Santander knew about the possibility of an assassination attempt and initially opposed it, but eventually allowed it to happen without his direct participation. This position was eventually assumed by Santander himself later in his life. Others consider that Santander may have been involved in the plan from the beginning as it would benefit him politically, though no direct proof of his role has been found.

==Exile==
After receiving his sentence, Santander left Bogotá on November 15, 1828, where he was taken as a prisoner to the city of Cartagena de Indias where he planned to board a ship and go into exile. This plan would change however as when he arrived near outskirts of the city in December 1828 his guards were instructed by General Mariano Montilla, chief of the Magdalena district, that Santander would not be allowed into the city itself but instead be taken to the fortress of San Fernando de Bocachica. Although Santander was sentenced to exile by the Council of Ministers, Montilla together with Urdaneta decided to detain him illegally and imprison him in the fortress where he would remain December 4 to 19. Santander, who had left Bogotá sick, saw his health decline due to conditions of the cell where he was placed, he sent several letters complaining about the situation to both Bolívar and Montilla.

On December 19, he was transferred to the castle of San José de Bocachica where his health worsened and his access to paper and ink were also restricted by order of Montilla, in addition his letters were also censored. Friends of Santander attempted to help him by writing letters to Bolívar protesting on his behalf. Santander would remain imprisoned in the castle for almost a year until General Antonio José de Sucre intervened and got into a heated argument with Bolívar about the matter. Bolívar finally acquiesced to Sucre&#x27;s demands and the result of this was the transfer of Santander aboard the frigate &quot;Cundinamarca&quot; to Puerto Cabello in Venezuela on June 16, 1829. He arrived on August 19 in Puerto Cabello, where Paéz granted him a passport to be allowed to go into exile aboard the merchant ship &quot;María&quot;, on August 27 arriving at the port of Hamburg about 48 days later on October 15, 1829.

During his stay in Europe, Santander traveled to several countries, visiting museums, factories, libraries, and met with several personalities from the Old Continent who treated him as if he were a head of state. During his stay in Hamburg he had his portrait taken by a local newspaper in the city. After a while he moved to Brussels where he met the &quot;Liberator of Argentina&quot; General José de San Martín, the two spoke for several hours about the state of affairs in South America, this would not be the only time the two would meet while in Europe. Of the meeting between the two, Santander remarked: &quot;I have treated General San Martín. I think he is a good soldier, very alive and shrewd, but a friend of monarchies&quot; From there he traveled to France, arriving in Paris on February 17, 1830, during his stay in the French capital he was presented to French society thanks to General Joaquín Acosta who was in the city by a government commission. During his stay in Paris he met the Marquis de La Fayette, the two had several conversations and also had the opportunity to visit his house, of this meeting the general commented in a letter to Bogotá:

&quot;The first time I saw the venerable Lafayette, I was frozen with admiration and respect; this gentleman has given me such a benevolent and distinguished welcome, that I am confused&quot;

Notably Lafayette made several serious efforts to reconcile Bolívar and Santander, he even sent a long and meaningful letter addressed to Bolívar that did not arrive on time, by the time it arrived in Bogotá, Bolívar had already departed for the coast to go into exile.

After a while, he left France to travel to England; in London he was able to meet the English philosopher and utilitarian Jeremy Bentham a person who Santander deeply admired and followed. Bentham invited him to a meal at his residence in London. Bentham gifted him several books and brochures, Santander was delighted to meet him and visited him again the following year. Shortly after he departed England for a brief stopover in the Netherlands on his way to Germany where he returned to Hamburg to visit some friends from there he traveled to Prussia arriving in the capital, Berlin, on July 16, 1830. Whilst in Berlin he met several members of the Prussian aristocracy, the most notable of them being Alexander Von Humboldt where the two spoke about Colombia and Bolívar during a lunch offered at the house of the Prussian nobleman. He also toured several German cities such as Dresden and Munich, in September 1830 he crossed the border with Italy and traveled through Verona and then arrived in Venice on October 6, 1830.

When he arrived in Florence on October 13, he was received by Grand Duke Lepold II and Princess Maria Ana Carolina of Saxony in his palace who took a certain interest in the Colombian general, asking him about his life, Colombia, and if he was thinking of returning to South America. He also met Camillo Borghese, Prince of Sulmona, who accompanied him during his visit to the different museums and art academies in the city. Santander left the city on Monday, December 6 in a rented carriage, accompanied by Francisco García, a native of Havana, traveled to Rome where he had the opportunity to visit the Vatican, the monuments, and the Roman ruins. Santander left Rome on February 23, 1831 arriving in Florence, it would be there where he learned of the death of the Bolívar, writing down in his diary:

&quot;Today I read in the Journal du Commerce of February 21 the death of General Bolívar near Santa Marta on December 17, 1830. A Loss for Independence&quot;

When one of his servants, José Delfín Caballero, commented with joy about the news of Bolívar&#x27;s death, Santander responded angrily &quot;In America only the miserable can rejoice in Bolívar&#x27;s death.&quot;

Santander returned once again to Paris in April 1831, on the way to the French capital he traveled through Switzerland. In June he returned to England where he ate with Bentham once again before leaving for Scotland where he arrived in Edinburgh, then he went to Ireland before returning for the third time to Paris. In Paris he met with Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera who presented General Santander to the court of King Louis Philippe I of France on September 16, 1831 where he had a placid conversation with the king and queen.

Later, in an attempt to be closer to New Granada, Santander traveled to the United States where he arrived in New York City on November 10, he then traveled to Philadelphia. During his stay in the US he became friends with Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon&#x27;s older brother. He also had the opportunity to visit the capital of Washington D.C., visiting the white house where he met and conversed with President Andrew Jackson.

==Return from Exile==
After Bolívar died and Gran Colombia broke up, Santander returned from exile in 1832 and served as President of the Republic of New Granada from 1832 to 1836. Santander had spent a great deal of time in Europe absorbing how the ideas of the Enlightenment were affecting European politics in the early 19th century. As his diary shows, Santander was an assiduous art and music lover, and attended the opera almost every evening. In 1830, he was in Brussels, where he saw various performances of &quot;La muette de Portici&quot;, whose liberal political implications caused a riot that sparked the Belgian Revolution, although he was in Berlin in August 25 when the riots occurred. When he returned, these concepts influenced his decisions to a great extent.

==Second Administration==

In 1832, Santander was elected by Congress as President for a second term. This administration was quite different from the first, in that he moved away from free trade and stressed an alternate form of protectionism. He first reverted most of his original changes from Bolívar&#x27;s undoing, although some were devalued somewhat. He did not close New Granada to international trade, but rather sought safety for New Granada under the auspices of industrialized nations, instead of discouraging trade with them. He set up economic contacts in eleven United States cities, hoped that by creating strong ties with them, he would promote industrial development in New Granada while avoiding the use of high tariffs, which he inherently disliked.

During his second administration, just like he did during his first administration, he ordered the execution of most of the rest of the Spanish officers still in captivity, who had been saved by Bolívar in the first round of Santander&#x27;s murderous pursuit; among them General José Sardá. They were executed in Bogotá, on July 23, 1833, in front of Santander himself.

== Later years and death ==

After his term expired, he remained an important and influential political figure and was elected as a representative for the chamber of the representatives of New Granada. Santander attended the sessions in the chamber, but stopped attending in April 1840 when he became gravely ill and became bedridden. From April 27, a diary was kept describing Santander&#x27;s health&#x27;s rapid decline. On May 6, 1840 at approximately 6:30 pm, Santander passed away in his bedside surrounded by his friends and family.

==Personal life==

Santander was described as relatively tall compared to his contemporaries, as well as having a &quot;good figure&quot; but later in life became more portly. He was also described as having a serious tone and of having good oratory skills when he talked and of having a strong Cucuteño accent. Personality wise, Santander was described as a hard worker and a voracious reader who was serious and behaved much like the military officers of his time, however once he became more involved in politics his personality became more jovial and that of an intelectual. Santander also enjoyed conversing with people and could often be found conversing with anyone regardless of social class or economic status. He often attended parties and balls, and was an avid lover of popular music and art.

While much is known about Santander&#x27;s public life as he left a rich amount of documents and letters, his personal life remains much of a mystery. Many of his personal letters were burned as per his instructions laid out in his last testament, his letters to his lover Nicolasa Ibáñez were taken by her when she moved to Europe and have never been found.

Santander&#x27;s father died in 1808 while he was studying in Santa Fe, his mother died in 1819 while he was on campaign during the New Granada campaign of 1819. Santander had only sibling who survived to adulthood his sister Maria Josefa, whom he was very close to. On July 19, 1820 she married a Venezuelan man, Colonel José María Briceño Méndez who had been wounded during the war of independence and was the brother of Colonel Pedro Briceño who also took part in New Granada Campaign of 1819 and was wounded at the Battle of Vargas Swamp. He maintained a good relationship with his brother-in-law, who even accompanied him during his march to Cartagena when he was exiled.

===Marriage and Children===
For much of his youth Santander was often on military campaigns and thus did not marry young like many of his generation. However he did have 5 children, 2 of these being out of wedlock, and 3 with his wife.

His first child, Manuel Santander, was born when Santander was only 19 years old and a second lieutenant in the National Guard Battalion while he was posted in the town of Honda with a local woman of that town. His second son Francisco de Paula Jesús Bartolomé Santander Piehdrahita, was born on August 23, 1833, to Paz Piehdrahita Saenz, despite being born out of wedlock Santander recognized him as his legitimate son in his testament, and also referred to him affectionately by his nickname &quot;Pachito&quot;. &quot;Pachito&quot; would follow his father&#x27;s footsteps and served in the Colombian military reaching the rank of general and would pass away in 1916.

Santander&#x27;s three other children were a result of his marriage to Sixta Pontón Piedrahita who he married on February 15, 1836 in the parish of San Bernardino in the town of Soacha. Amongst historians there is confusion regarding his marriage with Sixta as the relationship between the too was not romantic and was often cold at times. Leading historians speculate that Santander married her out of convenience as her father was one of the richest men in the country. Their marriage produced 3 children, a boy Juan born on December 20, 1836, who died only minutes after being born and who would later be buried in the recently inaugurated Central Cemetery of Bogotá, and two girls Clementina and Sixta Tulia, who both survived into adulthood. Apart from his marriage to Sixta, for almost two decades Santander maintained a relationship with a married woman, Nicolasa de Ibáñez and the few letters that survive show that the two were very in love with each other and even maintained a relationship when Santander was exiled in 1828.

== Legacy ==
Santander&#x27;s legacy has long been controversial, although his administrative importance in the vice-presidency of Gran Colombia has always been recognized, as well as his military leadership alongside Bolívar and Anzoátegui during the Liberation campaign. His reputation was heavily overshadowed by that of Bolívar, and affected by dark patches, such as the execution of prisoners after Boyacá. Nor after death did he become an object of veneration in his own country. Colombian political divisions did not permit that, as he was often vilified by ultra hard line Conservatives, such as former President Laureano Gomez, due to his opposition to the church and their influence over public education.

However over time he has been rehabilitated as the division between the nation&#x27;s two founding fathers has helped prevent party-political cults of Bolívar. In Colombia, Bolívar stands as the Liberator of the nation while Santander as the Lawgiver, the man who built the foundations for democracy in Colombia. Bolívar was &quot;the genius of the activity, Santander was the genius of order,&quot; in this sense they were, more than an opposition, a complement to each other.

<text>Gerard Henderson (born 1945) is an Australian author, columnist and political commentator noted for his right-wing Catholic and conservative views. He founded and is the executive director of The Sydney Institute, a privately funded Australian current affairs forum.

==Education and earlier career==
Henderson was educated at Melbourne&#x27;s Catholic, Jesuit-run Xavier College, one of the city&#x27;s elite private schools. He went on to study arts and law at the prestigeous University of Melbourne during the second half of the 1960s. He later completed a PhD.

Henderson taught at the Tasmania and La Trobe universities before working for four years on the staff of Kevin Newman in the Fraser government. He moved to the Department of Industrial Relations in 1980; from 1984 to 1986 he was chief-of-staff to John Howard, during which time Howard was deputy leader, then leader, of the Liberal Party of Australia.

The Keating government appointed Henderson to the board of the Australia Foundation for Culture and the Humanities. Later, the Howard government appointed him to the Foreign Affairs Council. He was one of the people invited to Kevin Rudd&#x27;s Australia 2020 Summit held in April 2008.

==Works==
For several years, Henderson had a weekly column in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;. He also writes &quot;Media Watch Dog&quot;, a weekly compendium of media criticism, written from the perspective of a blue heeler named Nancy. In December 2013, his column moved to &quot;The Weekend Australian&quot;, which also carries Media Watch Dog.

He has written several books.
* &quot;Mr Santamaria and the Bishops&quot; (Hale &amp; Iremonger, 1982; )
* &quot;Australian Answers&quot; (Random House Australia, 1990; )
* &quot;Gerard Henderson Scribbles On&quot; (Wilkinson Books, 1993; )
* &quot;Menzies&#x27; Child: The Liberal Party of Australia&quot; (HarperCollins, 1994; second edition 1998: )
* &quot;A Howard Government? Inside the Coalition&quot; (HarperCollins, 1995; )
* &quot;B. A. Santamaria&quot; (HarperCollins, 2005; )
* &quot;Santamaria: A Most Unusual Man&quot; (MUP, 2015; )
* &quot;Cardinal Pell, the Media Pile-On &amp; Collective Guilt&quot; (Connor Court Publishing, 2021; )

==Media appearances==
In 1994, Henderson profiled former prime minister Bob Hawke for the ABC TV program &quot;Four Corners&quot;. He was a regular political commentator on radio, and appeared occasionally on &quot;Insiders&quot;, another ABC TV program. In early 2020, Henderson was dropped from the show after new host David Speers reportedly wanted to try new conservative voices amid claims from sources in the ABC that Henderson failed to sufficiently engage with issues during panel discussions.

==Views==
In 2006, Henderson said John Howard had lost the ongoing culture wars, writing, &quot;In my view, there is only one area where the Coalition has failed to have a significant impact – namely, in what some have termed &#x27;the culture wars&#x27;.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

Henderson has supported the movement for Australia to become a republic.

<doc id="1048518" wikidata="Q756449" url="?curid=1048518" title="Supramolecular chemistry">
<text>Supramolecular chemistry refers to the branch of chemistry concerning chemical systems composed of a discrete number of molecules. The strength of the forces responsible for spatial organization of the system range from weak intermolecular forces, electrostatic charge, or hydrogen bonding to strong covalent bonding, provided that the electronic coupling strength remains small relative to the energy parameters of the component. While traditional chemistry concentrates on the covalent bond, supramolecular chemistry examines the weaker and reversible non-covalent interactions between molecules. These forces include hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, hydrophobic forces, van der Waals forces, pi–pi interactions and electrostatic effects. 

Important concepts advanced by supramolecular chemistry include molecular self-assembly, molecular folding, molecular recognition, host–guest chemistry, mechanically-interlocked molecular architectures, and dynamic covalent chemistry. The study of non-covalent interactions is crucial to understanding many biological processes that rely on these forces for structure and function. Biological systems are often the inspiration for supramolecular research.

==History==
The existence of intermolecular forces was first postulated by Johannes Diderik van der Waals in 1873. However, Nobel laureate Hermann Emil Fischer developed supramolecular chemistry&#x27;s philosophical roots. In 1894, Fischer suggested that enzyme–substrate interactions take the form of a &quot;lock and key&quot;, the fundamental principles of molecular recognition and host–guest chemistry. In the early twentieth century non-covalent bonds were understood in gradually more detail, with the hydrogen bond being described by Latimer and Rodebush in 1920.

With the deeper understanding of the non-covalent interactions, for example, the clear elucidation of DNA structure, chemists started to emphasize the importance of non-covalent interactions. In 1967, Charles J. Pedersen discovered crown ethers, which are ring-like structures capable of chelating certain metal ions. Then, in 1969, Jean-Marie Lehn discovered a class of molecules similar to crown ethers, called cryptands. After that, Donald J. Cram synthesized many variations to crown ethers, on top of separate molecules capable of selective interaction with certain chemicals. The three scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1987 for &quot;development and use of molecules with structure-specific interactions of high selectivity”. In 2016, Bernard L. Feringa, Sir J. Fraser Stoddart, and Jean-Pierre Sauvage were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, &quot;for the design and synthesis of molecular machines&quot;.
The term supermolecule (or supramolecule) was introduced by Karl Lothar Wolf &quot;et al.&quot; (&quot;Übermoleküle&quot;) in 1937 to describe hydrogen-bonded acetic acid dimers. The term supermolecule is also used in biochemistry to describe complexes of biomolecules, such as peptides and oligonucleotides composed of multiple strands.

Eventually, chemists applied these concepts to synthetic systems. One breakthrough came in the 1960s with the synthesis of the crown ethers by Charles J. Pedersen. Following this work, other researchers such as Donald J. Cram, Jean-Marie Lehn and Fritz Vögtle reported a variety of three-dimensional receptors, and throughout the 1980s research in the area gathered a rapid pace with concepts such as mechanically interlocked molecular architectures emerging.

The influence of supramolecular chemistry was established by the 1987 Nobel Prize for Chemistry which was awarded to Donald J. Cram, Jean-Marie Lehn, and Charles J. Pedersen in recognition of their work in this area. The development of selective &quot;host–guest&quot; complexes in particular, in which a host molecule recognizes and selectively binds a certain guest, was cited as an important contribution.

==Concepts==
===Molecular self-assembly===
Molecular self-assembly is the construction of systems without guidance or management from an outside source (other than to provide a suitable environment). The molecules are directed to assemble through non-covalent interactions. Self-assembly may be subdivided into intermolecular self-assembly (to form a supramolecular assembly), and intramolecular self-assembly (or folding as demonstrated by foldamers and polypeptides). Molecular self-assembly also allows the construction of larger structures such as micelles, membranes, vesicles, liquid crystals, and is important to crystal engineering.

===Molecular recognition and complexation===
Molecular recognition is the specific binding of a guest molecule to a complementary host molecule to form a host–guest complex. Often, the definition of which species is the &quot;host&quot; and which is the &quot;guest&quot; is arbitrary. The molecules are able to identify each other using non-covalent interactions. Key applications of this field are the construction of molecular sensors and catalysis.

===Template-directed synthesis===
Molecular recognition and self-assembly may be used with reactive species in order to pre-organize a system for a chemical reaction (to form one or more covalent bonds). It may be considered a special case of supramolecular catalysis. Non-covalent bonds between the reactants and a &quot;template&quot; hold the reactive sites of the reactants close together, facilitating the desired chemistry. This technique is particularly useful for situations where the desired reaction conformation is thermodynamically or kinetically unlikely, such as in the preparation of large macrocycles. This pre-organization also serves purposes such as minimizing side reactions, lowering the activation energy of the reaction, and producing desired stereochemistry. After the reaction has taken place, the template may remain in place, be forcibly removed, or may be &quot;automatically&quot; decomplexed on account of the different recognition properties of the reaction product. The template may be as simple as a single metal ion or may be extremely complex.

===Mechanically interlocked molecular architectures===
Mechanically interlocked molecular architectures consist of molecules that are linked only as a consequence of their topology. Some non-covalent interactions may exist between the different components (often those that were used in the construction of the system), but covalent bonds do not. Supramolecular chemistry, and template-directed synthesis in particular, is key to the efficient synthesis of the compounds. Examples of mechanically interlocked molecular architectures include catenanes, rotaxanes, molecular knots, molecular Borromean rings and ravels.

===Dynamic covalent chemistry===
In dynamic covalent chemistry covalent bonds are broken and formed in a reversible reaction under thermodynamic control. While covalent bonds are key to the process, the system is directed by non-covalent forces to form the lowest energy structures.

===Biomimetics===
Many synthetic supramolecular systems are designed to copy functions of biological systems. These biomimetic architectures can be used to learn about both the biological model and the synthetic implementation. Examples include photoelectrochemical systems, catalytic systems, protein design and self-replication.

===Imprinting===
Molecular imprinting describes a process by which a host is constructed from small molecules using a suitable molecular species as a template. After construction, the template is removed leaving only the host. The template for host construction may be subtly different from the guest that the finished host binds to. In its simplest form, imprinting uses only steric interactions, but more complex systems also incorporate hydrogen bonding and other interactions to improve binding strength and specificity.

===Molecular machinery===
Molecular machines are molecules or molecular assemblies that can perform functions such as linear or rotational movement, switching, and entrapment. These devices exist at the boundary between supramolecular chemistry and nanotechnology, and prototypes have been demonstrated using supramolecular concepts. Jean-Pierre Sauvage, Sir J. Fraser Stoddart and Bernard L. Feringa shared the 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the &#x27;design and synthesis of molecular machines&#x27;.

==Building blocks==
Supramolecular systems are rarely designed from first principles. Rather, chemists have a range of well-studied structural and functional building blocks that they are able to use to build up larger functional architectures. Many of these exist as whole families of similar units, from which the analog with the exact desired properties can be chosen.

===Synthetic recognition motifs===
*The pi-pi charge-transfer interactions of bipyridinium with dioxyarenes or diaminoarenes have been used extensively for the construction of mechanically interlocked systems and in crystal engineering.
*The use of crown ether binding with metal or ammonium cations is ubiquitous in supramolecular chemistry.
*The formation of carboxylic acid dimers and other simple hydrogen bonding interactions.
*The complexation of bipyridines or terpyridines with ruthenium, silver or other metal ions is of great utility in the construction of complex architectures of many individual molecules.
*The complexation of porphyrins or phthalocyanines around metal ions gives access to catalytic, photochemical and electrochemical properties in addition to the complexation itself. These units are used a great deal by nature.

===Macrocycles===
Macrocycles are very useful in supramolecular chemistry, as they provide whole cavities that can completely surround guest molecules and may be chemically modified to fine-tune their properties.
*Cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils and crown ethers are readily synthesized in large quantities, and are therefore convenient for use in supramolecular systems.
*More complex cyclophanes, and cryptands can be synthesised to provide more tailored recognition properties.
*Supramolecular metallocycles are macrocyclic aggregates with metal ions in the ring, often formed from angular and linear modules. Common metallocycle shapes in these types of applications include triangles, squares, and pentagons, each bearing functional groups that connect the pieces via &quot;self-assembly.&quot;
*Metallacrowns are metallomacrocycles generated via a similar self-assembly approach from fused chelate-rings.

===Structural units===
Many supramolecular systems require their components to have suitable spacing and conformations relative to each other, and therefore easily employed structural units are required.
*Commonly used spacers and connecting groups include polyether chains, biphenyls and triphenyls, and simple alkyl chains. The chemistry for creating and connecting these units is very well understood.
*nanoparticles, nanorods, fullerenes and dendrimers offer nanometer-sized structure and encapsulation units.
*Surfaces can be used as scaffolds for the construction of complex systems and also for interfacing electrochemical systems with electrodes. Regular surfaces can be used for the construction of self-assembled monolayers and multilayers.
* The understanding of intermolecular interactions in solids has undergone a major renaissance via inputs from different experimental and computational methods in the last decade. This includes high-pressure studies in solids and &quot;in situ&quot; crystallization of compounds which are liquids at room temperature along with the use of electron density analysis, crystal structure prediction and DFT calculations in solid state to enable a quantitative understanding of the nature, energetics and topological properties associated with such interactions in crystals.

===Photo-chemically and electro-chemically active units ===
*Porphyrins, and phthalocyanines have highly tunable photochemical and electrochemical activity as well as the potential to form complexes.
*Photochromic and photoisomerizable groups can change their shapes and properties, including binding properties, upon exposure to light.
*Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and quinones have multiple stable oxidation states, and therefore can be used in redox reactions and electrochemistry.
*Other units, such as benzidine derivatives, viologens, and fullerenes, are useful in supramolecular electrochemical devices.

===Biologically-derived units===
*The extremely strong complexation between avidin and biotin is instrumental in blood clotting, and has been used as the recognition motif to construct synthetic systems.
*The binding of enzymes with their cofactors has been used as a route to produce modified enzymes, electrically contacted enzymes, and even photoswitchable enzymes.
*DNA has been used both as a structural and as a functional unit in synthetic supramolecular systems.

==Applications==

===Materials technology===
Supramolecular chemistry has found many applications, in particular molecular self-assembly processes have been applied to the development of new materials. Large structures can be readily accessed using bottom-up synthesis as they are composed of small molecules requiring fewer steps to synthesize. Thus most of the bottom-up approaches to nanotechnology are based on supramolecular chemistry. Many smart materials are based on molecular recognition.

===Catalysis===
A major application of supramolecular chemistry is the design and understanding of catalysts and catalysis. Non-covalent interactions influence the binding reactants.
===Medicine===
Design based on supramolecular chemistry has led to numerous applications in the creation of functional biomaterials and therapeutics. Supramolecular biomaterials afford a number of modular and generalizable platforms with tunable mechanical, chemical and biological properties. These include systems based on supramolecular assembly of peptides, host–guest macrocycles, high-affinity hydrogen bonding, and metal–ligand interactions.

A supramolecular approach has been used extensively to create artificial ion channels for the transport of sodium and potassium ions into and out of cells.

Supramolecular chemistry is also important to the development of new pharmaceutical therapies by understanding the interactions at a drug binding site. The area of drug delivery has also made critical advances as a result of supramolecular chemistry providing encapsulation and targeted release mechanisms. In addition, supramolecular systems have been designed to disrupt protein–protein interactions that are important to cellular function.

===Data storage and processing===
Supramolecular chemistry has been used to demonstrate computation functions on a molecular scale. In many cases, photonic or chemical signals have been used in these components, but electrical interfacing of these units has also been shown by supramolecular signal transduction devices. Data storage has been accomplished by the use of molecular switches with photochromic and photoisomerizable units, by electrochromic and redox-switchable units, and even by molecular motion. Synthetic molecular logic gates have been demonstrated on a conceptual level. Even full-scale computations have been achieved by semi-synthetic DNA computers.

<doc id="1048523" wikidata="Q1746326" url="?curid=1048523" title="Haspe–Voerde–Breckerfeld Light Railway">
<text>The Haspe–Voerde–Breckerfeld Light Railway () was a narrow-gauge railway linking the towns of Breckerfeld and Voerde with the Elberfeld–Dortmund railway at Haspe. Construction lasted from 1901 to 1906. The original owners were:

*The country of Prussia
*The &quot;Provinzialverband&quot; of Westphalia
*Voerde, formerly a municipality; now belongs to Ennepetal
This narrow-gauge railway was 18.39 km (11.43 mi) long and ran 2.4 km (1.5 mi) over publicly owned roads. The majority of the span was sub-graded. The line&#x27;s most important role was the provision of goods services in the valley of Hasperbach and from the Breckerfeld plateau. For this purpose, standard gauge freight wagons were put onto narrow gauge transporter wagons. One of the locomotives is now in display in a museum railway in Switzerland.

After World War I, the company went into financial crisis and had to suspend passenger services in 1921 due to the economic downturn. The assets were bought by the streetcar company of the city of Hagen in 1927. The railway was then electrified, using 1200 V DC, and passenger and freight services were opened again. In 1954 freight services were suspended, and in 1963 the last passenger service was stopped. 

Today only the station at Breckerfeld, the viaduct below the Haspe dam, the locomotive shed and the transformer works at Hagen-Haspe by the shooting range are left. The trackbed is now largely used as a walking route and cycle path. The inclines do not exceed 3% at any point, so it is a very comfortable route for those cycling from the Ruhrgebiet into the Sauerland.

The route of the &quot;Kleinbahn&quot; was one of the most picturesque rural railway lines in Germany. It runs out of the narrow valley of the Hasperbach with a horseshoe curve near the Haspe Dam and a reversing station at Voerde onto the broad plateau of Breckerfeld, that dominates the surrounding area at a height of 350 m above sea level.

<doc id="1048524" wikidata="Q924318" url="?curid=1048524" title="Wheaton College (Massachusetts)">
<text>Wheaton College is a private liberal arts college in Norton, Massachusetts. Wheaton was founded in 1834 as a female seminary. The trustees officially changed the name of the Wheaton Female Seminary to Wheaton College in 1912 after receiving a college charter from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. It remained one of the oldest institutions of higher education for women in the United States until men began to be admitted in 1988. It enrolls 1,669 undergraduate students.

==History==
In 1834, Eliza Wheaton Strong, the daughter of Laban Wheaton, died at the age of thirty-nine. Eliza Baylies Chapin Wheaton, his daughter-in-law and a founder of the Trinitarian Congregational Church of Norton, persuaded him to memorialize his daughter by founding a female seminary.

The family called upon noted women&#x27;s educator Mary Lyon for assistance in establishing the seminary. Lyon created the first curriculum with the goal that it be equal in quality to those of men&#x27;s colleges. She also provided the first principal, Eunice Caldwell. Wheaton Female Seminary opened in Norton, Massachusetts on 22 April 1835, with 50 students and three teachers.

Lyon and Caldwell left Wheaton to open Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in 1837 (now Mount Holyoke College). After their departure, Wheaton endured a period of fluctuating enrollment and frequent changes in leadership until 1850, when Caroline Cutler Metcalf was recruited as the new principal. Metcalf made the hiring of outstanding faculty her top priority, bringing in educators who encouraged students to discuss ideas rather than to memorize facts. The most notable additions to the faculty were Lucy Larcom, who introduced the study of English Literature and founded the student literary magazine &quot;The Rushlight;&quot; and Mary Jane Cragin, who used innovative techniques to teach geometry and made mathematics the favorite study of many students.

Metcalf retired in 1876. A. Ellen Stanton, a teacher of French since 1871, served as principal from 1880 to 1897. She led the seminary during a difficult time, when it faced competition from increasing numbers of public high schools and colleges granting bachelor&#x27;s degrees to women.

In 1897, at the suggestion of Eliza Baylies Wheaton, the trustees hired Samuel Valentine Cole as the seminary&#x27;s first male president. Preparing to seek a charter as a four-year college, Cole began a program of revitalization that included expanding and strengthening the curriculum, increasing the number and quality of the faculty, and adding six new buildings.

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts granted Wheaton a college charter in 1912, and the trustees changed the name of the school to Wheaton College. The Student Government Association was organized to represent the &quot;consensus of opinion of the whole student body&quot;, and to encourage individual responsibility, integrity, and self-government. Wheaton received authorization to establish a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa in 1932, twenty years after achieving college status.

Cole died unexpectedly in 1925 after a brief illness. During his career as president, Cole oversaw the expansion of the campus from three to 27 buildings, the growth of enrollment from 50 to 414, and the establishment of an endowment. On the campus, Cole Memorial Chapel is named after him. Its approximate geographical coordinates are: .

John Edgar Park, who became president in 1926, continued Cole&#x27;s building program, and saw the college through the Great Depression, the celebration of its centennial in 1935 and World War II. He retired in 1944, and was succeeded by Dartmouth College Professor of History Alexander Howard Meneely. During his tenure, the trustees voted to expand the size of the college from 525 to 800 to 1000 students, and construction of &quot;new campus&quot; began in 1957.

Meneely died in 1961 after a long illness and was succeeded in 1962 by William C.H. Prentice, a psychology professor and administrator at Swarthmore College. In the early 1960s, Wheaton successfully completed its first endowment campaign. The development of new campus continued, and student enrollment grew to 1,200. Wheaton students and faculty joined in nationwide campus protests against United States actions in Indochina in 1970.

In 1975, Wheaton inaugurated its first woman president, Alice Frey Emerson, dean of students at the University of Pennsylvania. During her tenure, Wheaton achieved national recognition as a pioneer in the development of a gender-balanced curriculum. Emerson would go on to receive the Valeria Knapp Award from The College Club of Boston in 1987 for establishing the Global Awareness Program at Wheaton College. Wheaton celebrated its Sesquicentennial in 1984/85 with a year-long series of symposia, concerts, dance performances, art and history exhibits, and an endowment and capital campaign. In 1987, the trustees voted to admit men to Wheaton. The first coeducational class was enrolled in September 1988.

Dale Rogers Marshall, Academic Dean at Wellesley College, was inaugurated as Wheaton&#x27;s sixth president in 1992. She led the college in &quot;The Campaign for Wheaton&quot;, to build endowed and current funds for faculty development, student scholarships, and academic programs and facilities. Enrollment growth encouraged the construction of the first new residence halls since 1964 (Gebbie, Keefe and Beard residence halls), the improvement of classroom buildings and the renovation and expansion of the college&#x27;s arts&#x27; facilities.

Wheaton&#x27;s Board of Trustees appointed Ronald A. Crutcher as the seventh president of the college on March 23, 2004. Crutcher came to Wheaton from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he served as provost and executive vice president for academic affairs and professor of music. During his tenure, he ran the most successful funding campaigns in Wheaton&#x27;s history, funding the new $37M Mars Science Center, more than $53M in new scholarship endowments, as well as new athletic facilities, faculty-mentored research, and career services.[1]

Dennis M. Hanno was appointed as the eighth president in 2014 and served until 2021. Hanno accentuated Wheaton&#x27;s emphasis on diversity and a student-centered approach to education. He advocated and implemented programs to apply liberal arts teachings to social entrepreneurship and making the world a better place. One of his initiatives offers a full scholarship to one refugee student each year, with preference for students from countries subject to immigration restrictions proposed by Donald Trump in 2016.

Wheaton&#x27;s current president is Michaele Whelan.

===Presidents===
The following is a list of Wheaton College presidents with the years of their presidential tenures.

* Samuel Valentine Cole (1912–1925)
* George Thomas Smart, Acting President (1925–1926)
* John Edgar Park (1926–1944)
* A. Howard Meneely (1944–1961)
* Elizabeth Stoffregen May, Acting President (1961–1962)
* William Courtney Hamilton Prentice (1962–1975)
* Alice Frey Emerson (1975–1991)
* Hannah Goldberg, Acting President (1991–1992)
* Dale Rogers Marshall (1992–2004)
* Ronald Crutcher (2004–2014)
* Dennis M. Hanno (2014–2021)
* Michaele Whelan (2022–present)

==Academics==
Wheaton offers a liberal arts education leading to a Bachelor of Arts degree in more than 100 majors and minors. Students are permitted to work with faculty members to design self-declared majors. Wheaton College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education. The most popular majors, based on 2021 graduates, were:
*Business Administration and Management (53)
*Psychology (47)
*Biology/Biological Sciences (29)
*Neuroscience (26)
*Film/Cinema/Media Studies (20)
*Political Science and Government (19)
*Computer Science (18)
*English Language &amp; Literature (18)

Foundations courses focus on writing, quantitative analysis, foreign language study and non-Western perspectives. In their first semester at Wheaton, all freshmen take a First Year Seminar in which they explore contemporary issues and gain academic skills needed for college-level study. The major concentration and elective courses are also central to the Wheaton Compass Curriculum, which culminates in a senior capstone experience—a thesis, research project, seminar or creative project.

=== Partnerships with other schools ===
The course selection is extended further through the college&#x27;s cross-registration programs with Brown University and nine local colleges involved in SACHEM (Southeastern Association for Cooperation in Higher Education in Massachusetts). Wheaton also offers dual-degree programs, enabling its undergraduates to begin graduate-level study in studio art, communications, engineering, business, theology and optometry.

Among several study abroad opportunities unique to Wheaton is its partnership with Royal Thimphu College in Bhutan.

=== Interdisciplinary study ===
Students must take either three linked courses or two sets of two-course connections. These courses are intended to encourage students to explore and think beyond their primary academic interests. For instance, the connection entitled &quot;Communication through Art and Mathematics&quot; links Arts 298 (Graphic Design I) with Math 127 (Advertising Math). Although students may complete one of the numerous pre-designed connections, students are encouraged to consider proposing their own.

In 2014, the college won a $500,000 grant from the Sherman Fairchild Foundation to fund the IMAGINE Network, &quot;an interdisciplinary, campus-wide collaboratory connecting spaces, people, resources and ideas.&quot; While much of that grant was used in development of new interdisciplinary facilities, it also supports several interdisciplinary research groups each semester, and supports students and faculty in developing the next generation of liberal arts curriculum.

=== Hands-on learning ===
Wheaton&#x27;s &quot;Semester in the City&quot; program places students in internships around Boston where they work while taking two related courses for the duration of the semester, to offer a more real-world living-working-learning experience. Wheaton guarantees funding for students pursuing unpaid extracurricular experiences, including internships, research, or any suitable experiential learning opportunity. The Wheaton Institute for the Interdisciplinary Humanities (WIIH) develops and exposes programming exploring liberal arts education&#x27;s weight in the ever-changing and increasingly complex &quot;real world.&quot;

Much of this emphasis was initiated by college president Dennis M. Hanno, who took some inspiration from Babson College, where he was a Senior Vice President and Provost. One of his primary efforts in this area is WIN, short for Wheaton Innovates, which prepares students to launch social enterprises, applying liberal arts skill sets to create social change. That&#x27;s included a new partnership with MassChallenge to partner students with startups, and led to a $10M commitment by the Diana Davis Spencer Foundation to continue expansion of social entrepreneurship programs starting in 2018.

=== Arts ===
In 2003, the Evelyn Danzig Haas &#x27;39 Visiting Artists Program was initiated; the program brings writers, musicians, actors, directors, dancers and artists to campus for short-term residencies to share their work through lectures, master classes, concerts and exhibitions. Arts in the City complements the visiting artists program by taking students and faculty members on trips to Boston, Providence and elsewhere to explore the arts and cultural offerings of the region.

Wheaton also has an extensive Permanent Collection of artworks which are often implemented in classes and student projects, including in some innovative learning experiences, like a semi-annual student-curated exhibition and student-driven provenance research.

College galleries often exhibit work from the Permanent Collection, but also notable visiting artist. During the 2016–2017 school year, there was a student-curated show, a show of student work, and an installation by Judy Pfaff.

=== Scholarships and fellowships ===
Wheaton prioritizes scholarships and fellowships both at the college and for its alumni. In 2016, Wheaton ranked tenth in its number of Fulbright scholars and was recognized as a top producer for 11 consecutive years. Since 2000, Wheaton students have received over 200 external scholarships, including 3 Rhodes Scholarships.

Wheaton itself provides substantial scholarships opportunities for current and prospective students. From 2004 to 2014, Wheaton added $53M in scholarships for students, and guarantees funding for internships and experiential learning opportunities. Support for the most academically curious students extends beyond financial funding to include the cohort-based May Fellows program and the Beard Hall living-learning community.

Wheaton also has a chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa Honor Society.

== Campus ==

=== Architecture ===
Austin House, designed by The Architects Collaborative, sits at the edge of campus and serves as housing for guest speakers, artists, etc. It won &quot;Architectural Record&quot;″s &quot;House of the Year&quot; in 1962, and remains an important example of mid-century modernism.

In 1938, Wheaton sponsored a competition to build a new arts center, cosponsored by Museum of Modern Art and Architectural Forum. They fielded proposals from some of the most famous architects of that era, including Louis Kahn and Walter Gropius, the latter of which took second prize. First prize went to two relatively unknown architects, Caleb Hornbostel and Richard Bennett, and while never actually built, accelerated the college&#x27;s embrace of modernist architecture. In 1962, Watson Fine Arts was finally built in the Brutalist International Style.

=== Student living ===
Wheaton students live in a variety of ways. There are 18 traditional residence halls; some, like Meadows and Beard, were built in the 2000s, while others date back to the late 1800s. Most have single and double rooms, with two buildings dedicated to suites of 3-6 people.

There&#x27;s also a rich history of &quot;Theme Houses,&quot; bringing together a number of students with shared interests or purpose. In the 2017–2018 year, there were 17 theme houses on campus. They range from Farm House, which is an active farm, to the United World College Davis House, to the Feminist Perspective House.

=== Recent facilities developments ===
Wheaton&#x27;s 2014 Sherman Fairchild Foundation grant supported development of a network of interdisciplinary creative spaces around campus, including a Makerspace called Lab 213 (housing 3D printers, Laser cutters, five-axis CNC milling equipment, electronics workspace), the HATCH Lab (digital classroom with virtual reality and eye tracking tools for digital humanities), and a Fiberspace (with digital jacquard loom, sewing machines, and other fibers and textiles tools).

Also included in that network are Arts spaces like the Wheaton Sculpture Studio (wood and metal working, ceramics, molding and casting, etc.), WCCS Student-run recording studio, Machine Shop for precision fabrication, and an experimental theater and dance studio.

In 2011, Wheaton completed its new Mars Science Center, a Gold LEED certified building housing the majority of the schools science classrooms and research (including greenhouses and observatory). It&#x27;s also connected by underground passages to the old science center and library.

In 2000, Wheaton also expanded its Arts facilities.

The school has been pursuing infrastructure projects outside academics, too. In 2016, Wheaton renovated its dining halls, including Emerson Dining Hall, the Hood Cafe, and the Davis Spencer Cafe. They also rebuilt Chase Dining Hall. The next year, they erected solar panels on the roof of the old science center and in fields nearby.
==Athletics==

Wheaton fields 21 varsity NCAA Division III teams, nine for men and 12 for women, in addition to 14 club sports programs and a variety of intramural activities.

== Reputation ==
In 2018, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; ranked Wheaton among the Top 40 U.S. Colleges for liberal arts. For 2015, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked it 69th in Best National Liberal Arts Colleges, and top 50 by high school counselor rankings. Kiplinger notes Wheaton as a &quot;Best Value School&quot;, and College Raptor and College Recruiter independently identify Wheaton as a &quot;hidden gem.&quot; The Princeton Review also recognizes Wheaton as a standout Northeastern college, one of the 373 best colleges in the United States and among the Top 200 Colleges That Pay You Back. Since 2000, over 250 prestigious scholarships have gone to Wheaton students, including 3 Rhodes Scholarships. In 2011 &quot;Newsweek&quot;/&quot;The Daily Beast&quot; placed Wheaton at number 19 of 25 in their &quot;Braniacs&quot; schools ranking.

Niche ranked Wheaton sixth for most liberal colleges in 2018, and the college does generally have a reputation for liberalism. College leadership has spoken out at numerous occasions against the Trump presidency, in favor of remaining signed on to the Paris Climate Accord and establishing a scholarship for refugees adversely affected by Trump&#x27;s immigration policies. The school is not to be confused with the much more conservative Wheaton College (Illinois), and college leadership has at times publicly denounced the other institution&#x27;s regressive stances and actions to make that clear.

<text>Donald Newton Wilber (November 14, 1907, Wisconsin – February 2, 1997, Princeton, New Jersey), American writer and spy.

Wilber, along with MI6 agent Norman Darbyshire was one of the two principal architects of the MI6-CIA project &quot;Operation Ajax&quot; (or &quot;Operation Boot&quot; as it was called by the British), a successful plot to overthrow the government of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq. The plot replaced Iran&#x27;s first democratically elected Prime Minister with General Fazlollah Zahedi; the government fell back into the hands of its disempowered Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, who had supported the coup.

Wilber served as a United States intelligence officer with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), and was an active participant in the power struggles of nations, especially during the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union in Iran after World War II.

In addition to orchestrating the coup in Iran, in his spare time, Wilber wrote histories, travelogues and commentaries on Iran, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. He was considered an authority on ancient Persia.

==Background==
Wilber studied the ancient and modern Middle East. He received his A.B. (1929), M.F.A., and Ph.D. (1949) from Princeton University, where he was the first student to receive a doctorate in architectural history.

In 1939 Wilber married Margaret Patterson Surre; they had two daughters, Sara Wilber Cohen and Margaret Newton Wilber, who later changed her name to Valentine Margaret Wilber.

His book, &quot;Iran, Past and Present&quot;, was published in nine editions. Wilber collected oriental rugs and was president of the Princeton Rug Society for many years. He spent forty years in the Middle East.

His memoir, which partially recounts his role in the coup, is &quot;Adventures in the Middle East: Excursions and Incursions&quot;.

==Publications==
Wilber is the author of articles and books, including:

* &quot;The Islamic Architecture of Iran and Turan: The Timurid Period&quot; (with Lisa Golombek, Princeton University Press, 2 vols.)
* &quot;Iran, Past and Present&quot; (Princeton University Press)

<doc id="1048537" wikidata="Q2429588" url="?curid=1048537" title="Thrombectomy">
<text>Mechanical thrombectomy, or simply thrombectomy, is the removal of a blood clot (thrombus) from a blood vessel, often and especially endovascularly as an interventional radiology procedure called endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). It thus contrasts with thrombolysis (clot dissolution) by thrombolytic medications (e.g., alteplase, reteplase), as either alternative or complement thereto. It is commonly performed in the cerebral arteries (interventional neuroradiology) as treatment to reverse the ischemia in some ischemic strokes (i.e., those in which the blockage is a suitable candidate for such retrieval). Open vascular surgery versions of thrombectomy also exist. The effectiveness of thrombectomy for strokes was confirmed in several randomised clinical trials conducted at various medical centers throughout the United States, as reported in a seminal multistudy report in 2015.

== Applications in brain ==
Ischemic stroke represents the fifth most common cause of death in the western world and the number one cause of long-term disability. Until recent times, systemic intravenous fibrinolysis was the only evidence-based therapy for patients with acute onset of stroke due to large vessel occlusion.

=== History ===
The world&#x27;s first thrombectomy (in case of blood clot in the brain) was performed in 1994 at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden by senior physician Gunnar Wikholm.

In 2015, the results of five trials from different countries were published in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot;, demonstrating the safety and efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy with stent-retrievers in improving outcomes and reducing mortality for patients who present within six hours from their time last known well. It is now a widespread procedure performed in many hospitals around the globe, especially comprehensive stroke centers, although many other hospitals are not yet able to supply the service enough to meet the need. Large obstacles to making EVT more widely available are both systematic hurdles at the prehospital stages and the intrahospital barrier of a scarcity of interventional neuroradiologists. They concern TTR (time to reperfusion), which is the same underlying problem as the golden hour in general, albeit several hours in the case of TTR: that is, EVT performed within 2 or 3 hours can help vastly, whereas EVT performed after 6 to 12 hours is often (although not always) too late to prevent the permanent sequelae of the ischemia. In this respect, the dissemination of EVT into clinical practice shows how translational medicine has various layers, some easier to solve and some harder: it was in some respects straightforward to develop the technology of EVT in the 2000s and 2010s (that is, the catheter tips and procedures), but it is not easy to revamp the standard of care in prehospital settings (such as awareness among family members and bystanders, optimal techniques for emergency medical services, and so on), which deployment of timely EVT requires.

In 2018 the DAWN and DEFUSE-3 trials were published. These trials showed that mechanical thrombectomy is a safe and effective treatment for individuals who have an acute ischemic stroke, even (in some cases) out to 24 hours after symptom onset. Most studies, however, have focused on thrombectomies in anterior circulation strokes. In recent years, increasing evidence on the efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy in posterior circulation strokes has been published.

=== Stent-retriever thrombectomy ===
The procedure can be performed with general anesthesia or under conscious sedation in an angiographic room. A system of coaxial catheters is pushed inside the arterial circulation, usually through a percutaneous access to the right femoral artery. A microcatheter is finally positioned beyond the occluded segment and a stent-retriever is deployed to catch the thrombus; finally, the stent is pulled out from the artery, usually under continuous aspiration in the larger catheters.

=== Direct aspiration ===
A different technique for mechanical thrombectomy in the brain is direct aspiration. It is performed by pushing a large soft aspiration catheter into the occluded vessel and applying direct aspiration to retrieve the thrombus; it can be combined with the stent-retriever technique to achieve higher recanalization rates, but the complexity of the procedure increases.

Direct aspiration has not been studied as thoroughly as stent-retriever thrombectomy, but it is still widely performed because of its relative simplicity and low cost.

==Delivery==
Patients in London who suffered stroke were found to be much more likely to get thrombectomy in 2022 than those in other parts of England. 42% of thrombectomy units only operated during office hours and Monday to Friday, largely due to a shortage of neurointerventionalists.

<text>Breckerfeld is a town in the district of Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis, in North Rhine-Westphalia, (Germany). It is located in the southeasternmost part of the Ruhr area in northern Sauerland. The town is a member of Regionalverband Ruhr (association).

==Geography==
Breckerfeld is a rural community in a hilly area. The weather around the city is generally cool with a substantial amount of rain. The town consists of two administrative parts: Breckerfeld proper and Waldbauer.

==History==
Breckerfeld has had town rights since 1396 and was a member of the Hanseatic League. From 1907 until 1963 the Haspe–Voerde–Breckerfeld Light Railway connected Breckerfeld with the Elberfeld–Dortmund railway at Haspe. In 1970, the independent municipality of Dahl joined the town of Breckerfeld. In 1975, the federal parliament decided to reorganize this area into falling within the boundaries of the nearby district-free city, Hagen.

Nena, one of Germany&#x27;s most successful pop-singers, spent the first several years of her life in Breckerfeld.

==Politics==
The current mayor of Breckerfeld is André Dalhaus of the CDU. In the most recent mayoral election on 13 September 2020, he was elected unopposed with 88% of votes in favour and 12% against.

===Local council===

The Breckerfeld municipal council governs the city alongside the Mayor. The most recent council election was held on 13 September 2020, and the results were as follows:

<doc id="1048552" wikidata="Q4765175" url="?curid=1048552" title="Animerica Extra">
<text>Animerica Extra was a monthly manga magazine published in by Viz Media. Established as a companion to the anime news and review magazine &quot;Animerica&quot;, &quot;Animerica Extra&quot; primarily published English-language translations of Japanese manga. The magazine shifted towards publishing &quot;shōjo&quot; manga (girls&#x27; manga) in 2003, before ceasing publication in 2004.

==History==
&quot;Animerica Extra&quot; was conceived as a sister publication to &quot;Animerica&quot;, Viz&#x27;s general interest anime and manga magazine. Amid the anime boom of the 1990s, &quot;Animerica Extra&quot; and the Viz manga magazines &quot;Manga Vizion&quot; and &quot;Pulp&quot; were among the first English-language manga magazines to publish manga titles aimed at demographics outside of children&#x27;s manga, and have been noted as being &quot;instrumental in disseminating manga culture&quot; in North America. The magazine principally published English-language translations of manga, though it published non-manga content such as the short stories of Mitsuru Adachi, and feature stories on manga, anime, and Japanese culture. Certain issues featured original cover artwork by manga artists, including Haruhiko Mikimoto and Chiho Saito.

Sales for the magazine were initially strong; in August 2001, &quot;ICv2&quot; reported that &quot;Animerica Extra&quot; had grown its circulation month-over-month for over a year, and cited the magazine&#x27;s growth as proof of uncaptured potential in the American &quot;shōjo&quot; market. &quot;Animerica Extra&quot;&#x27;s readership was roughly 70 percent female; &quot;ICv2&quot; additionally noted that retailers such as Mile High Comics were able to capitalize on the success of &quot;Animerica Extra&quot; to attract female customers to comic book stores. Following the cancellation of &quot;Pulp&quot; in 2002, the magazine&#x27;s serialization of &quot;Banana Fish&quot; continued in &quot;Animerica Extra&quot;. In July 2003, the magazine began publishing &quot;shōjo&quot; manga exclusively and began printing certain manga in its original right-to-left format, as opposed to the flipped artwork it had previously published.

In December 2004, &quot;Animerica Extra&quot; ceased publication. The magazine was replaced by the manga magazine &quot;Shojo Beat&quot;, which was published by Viz from July 2005 until July 2009.

<doc id="1048556" wikidata="Q5882505" url="?curid=1048556" title="Hollywood, Maryland">
<text>Hollywood is an unincorporated community located within St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. It was named in 1867, when a storeowner at Thompson&#x27;s General Store near the Uniontown section of Hollywood required a name for the post office inside the store. The storeowner was inspired by the gigantic holly tree planted in front of the store and named the post office Hollywood.

==History==
Hollywood is home to distinctive landmarks such as the congregation of St. John Francis Regis Catholic Church, which was founded in 1690. The area also includes the nationally renowned Sotterley Plantation on the banks of the Patuxent River. Sotterley was founded in 1703 by James Bowles, a wealthy planter, eventually changing hands to former Maryland Governor George Plater and through the 20th century to Louisa Satterlee (daughter of J.P. Morgan) and her husband. The town is also home to a recently demolished manor house, Resurrection Manor, which was thought to have been built in 1640 by Thomas Cornwalleys, the grandfather of the General Lord Cornwallis who surrendered to George Washington at the Battle of Yorktown during the American Revolutionary War.

On December 24 1947, Fulton Lewis Jr. broadcast his nightly Mutual Broadcasting System program as a Christmas special from a small church in Hollywood, hosted by his daughter Betsy Lewis, while Lewis Jr. himself accompanied her narration on the organ. The broadcast was so well received that it was re-broadcast by transcription the following night on Christmas. The transcription disc for this broadcast is housed at American University in the John R. Hickman Collection. 

==Economy==
The contemporary community of Hollywood now serves as a small rural community with extensive farms that produce soybean, corn, hay, grains, wheats, and formerly tobacco. It currently hosts an industrial park where corporations such as Northrop Grumman have branch offices. There is a training/conference center for engineers attached to the nearby Patuxent River Naval Air Station. Numerous roads lead to the shore of the Patuxent River. Hollywood is not an incorporated town, residing under the direct authority of the St. Mary&#x27;s County Commissioners.

==Schools==
Hollywood is home to Hollywood Elementary School on Joy Chapel Road, which is divided into multiple &quot;houses&quot; that each emphasize a different culture from around the world.
Hollywood is also the home of St. John Francis Regis Catholic School. St. John&#x27;s School was opened on September 12, 1923 under the leadership of Rev. Joseph M. Johnson, S.J. The first four grades were taught in the sacristy of the church and grades five through eight were held in a second story room over the sacristy.

From the 1920s until the 1980s, the school was staffed by the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, Kentucky. On May 20, 1924 the white frame section of the school was completed as a four-room school building. On June 15, 1952 a brick addition of two classrooms, auditorium and full basement were completed. Later, part of the auditorium was partitioned to make two additional classrooms and the remaining auditorium space was converted to a library.

In February 2010, the roof above the library, auditorium, fourth grade, and fifth grade classrooms collapsed due to a major snowstorm. Community volunteers as well as volunteer firefighters from HWVFD came together to help clear the debris and, after the snow melted, reconstruction began. The white frame section was remodeled and the brick addition was rebuilt, with the reconstructed building finally reopening the following January.

==Socks the cat==
Socks, the cat of President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, lived in Hollywood after the Clintons left the White House in 2001. Socks, who lived with Bill Clinton&#x27;s secretary Betty Currie, was euthanized in 2009 at an age of nearly twenty after several years of declining health.

<doc id="1048567" wikidata="Q567422" url="?curid=1048567" title="Annus Mirabilis (poem)">
<text>Annus Mirabilis is a poem written by John Dryden published in 1667. It commemorated 1665–1666, the &quot;year of miracles&quot; of London. Despite the poem&#x27;s name, the year had been one of great tragedy, including the Great Fire of London. The title was perhaps meant to suggest that the events of the year could have been worse. Dryden wrote the poem while at Charlton in Wiltshire, where he went to escape one of the great events of the year: the Great Plague of London.

==Historical context==
The title of Dryden&#x27;s poem, used without capitalisation, &quot;annus mirabilis&quot;, derives its meaning from its Latin origins and describes a year of particularly notable events. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, Dryden&#x27;s use of the term for the title of his poem constitutes the first known written use of the phrase in an English text.
The first event of the miraculous year was the Battle of Lowestoft fought by English and Dutch ships in 1665. The second was the Four Days Battle of June 1666, and finally the victory of the St. James&#x27;s Day Battle a month later. The second part of the poem deals with the Great Fire of London that ran from September 2–7, 1666. The miracle of the Fire was that London was saved, that the fire was stopped, and that the great king (Charles II) would rebuild, for he already announced his plans to improve the streets of London and to begin great projects. Dryden&#x27;s view is that these disasters were all averted, that God had saved England from destruction, and that God had performed miracles for England.

==Structure==
The poem contains 1216 lines of verse, arranged in 304 quatrains. Each line consists of ten syllables, and each quatrain follows an abab rhyme scheme, a pattern referred to as a decasyllabic quatrain. Rather than write in the heroic couplets found in his earlier works, Dryden used the decasyllabic quatrain exemplified in Sir John Davies&#x27; poem &quot;Nosce Teipsum&quot; in 1599. The style was revived by William Davenant in his poem &quot;Gondibert&quot;, which was published in 1651 and influenced Dryden&#x27;s composition of &quot;Annus Mirabilis&quot;. This particular style dictates that each quatrain should contain a full stop, which A. W. Ward believes causes the verse to become &quot;prosy&quot;.

<doc id="1048571" wikidata="Q4839219" url="?curid=1048571" title="Back bacon">
<text>Back bacon is a cut of bacon that includes the pork loin from the back of the pig. It also includes a portion of the pork belly in the same cut. It is much leaner than side bacon made only from the pork belly. Back bacon is derived from the same cut used for pork chops. It is the most common cut of bacon used in British and Irish cuisine, where both smoked and unsmoked varieties of bacon are found.

In the United States, this is called Canadian bacon and goes in such recipes as eggs Benedict; in the U.K. and Canada it is called back bacon. 

The &quot;normal&quot; U.S. bacon is made from pork belly instead and called streaky bacon there. 

In Ireland, this is known as a rasher. In addition, streaky bacon is the name given to U.S. bacon, generally side bacon. Both back bacon and side bacon are colloquially known as rashers. 

==&quot;Canadian&quot; bacon==
Canadian bacon (or Canadian-style bacon) is the term commonly used in the United States for a form of back bacon that is cured, smoked and fully cooked, trimmed into cylindrical medallions, and sliced thick. The name was created when this product was first imported from Toronto to New York City. &quot;Canadian&quot; bacon is made only from the lean eye of the loin and is ready to eat. Its flavor is described as more ham-like than other types because of its lean cut. 

The term &quot;Canadian bacon&quot; is not used in Canada, where the product is generally known simply as &quot;ham&quot; while &quot;bacon&quot; alone refers to the same streaky pork belly bacon as in the United States. Peameal bacon is a variety of back bacon popular in Ontario where the loin is wet cured before being rolled in cornmeal (originally yellow pea meal); it is unsmoked.

<doc id="1048592" wikidata="Q2915712" url="?curid=1048592" title="Coogee, New South Wales">
<text>Coogee () is a beachside suburb in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, eight kilometres south-east of the Sydney central business district.

The Tasman Sea and Coogee Bay along with Coogee Beach lie towards the eastern side of the suburb. The boundaries of Coogee are formed mainly by Clovelly Road, Carrington Road and Rainbow Street, with arbitrary lines drawn to join these thoroughfares to the coast in the north-east and south-east corners.

==History==

===Aboriginal===
The name Coogee is said to be taken from a local Aboriginal word &quot;koojah&quot; which means &quot;smelly place&quot;. Another version is &quot;koo-chai&quot; or &quot;koo-jah&quot;, both of which mean &quot;the smell of the seaweed drying&quot; in the Bidigal language, or &quot;stinking seaweed&quot;, a reference to the smell of decaying kelp washed up on the beach. Early visitors to the area, from the 1820s onwards, were never able to confirm exactly what &quot;Coogee&quot; meant, or if it in fact related to Coogee Beach. Some evidence suggests that the word &quot;Coogee&quot; may in fact be the original Aboriginal place name for the next bay to the north, now known as Gordons Bay. Another name, &quot;Bobroi&quot;, was also recalled as the indigenous name for the locality.

The Aboriginal population had largely relocated by the mid-19th century after being decimated by disease and violent clashes with early settlers, though some Aboriginal people still live in the area today.

===European settlement===

Coogee was gazetted as a village in 1838. The first school was built in 1863, and the building was converted into the Coogee Bay Hotel in 1873. Three years later, Coogee Public School was established. Baths there were the only place swimming was permitted in daylight hours. Ocean swimming was not widely commented upon. In late 1887, Coogee Palace Aquarium and swimming baths were constructed. The Coogee Pleasure Pier, a large attraction including a theatre, restaurant and ballroom, was constructed in 1928, but was later demolished in 1934.

Coogee was connected to the City of Sydney by electric tram in 1902. The suburb&#x27;s popularity as a seaside resort was then guaranteed. The line branched from the line to Clovelly at Darley Road in Randwick. It ran down King Street beside the Randwick Tram Workshops, then ran in its own reservation to Belmore Road. It then ran down Perouse Road, St Pauls Street, Carr Street and Arden Street before terminating in a balloon loop in Dolphin Street at Coogee Beach. It ran through several small tram reservations on its way down from Randwick to the beach. The line from Randwick to Coogee opened in 1883, and electric services were introduced in 1902. The line closed in 1960. It follows the current route of Transdev John Holland bus route 373. Sections of the disused tramways are now maintained by local residents as a community garden.
The 1888 paintings of Coogee Bay by Charles Conder and Tom Roberts are among the earliest masterpieces of the Heidelberg School or Australian impressionism.

The Coogee Surf Life Saving Club was founded in 1907 by local people who believed swimmers needed protection from the dangers of the surf. The CSLSC prides itself on being a pioneer in the realm of surf life saving. In fact, the first mass rescue, night surf carnival, shark attack and the development of the resuscitation technique are attributed to the CSLSC. In 2017 a lost-and-found room, first-aid room, kiosk, surf-board store room and amenities were finished building.
It was closed in 2020 because of COVID-19 and but is now re-opened.

Built in the early 1890s and occupied by a Mrs T.M. Alcock was a large mansion known as &quot;Maidstone&quot;, which stands in Waltham Street beside St Brigid&#x27;s Church. The house features a metal cupola and cedar fittings inside. The Catholic Church bought the building in 1922 and it was restored to its original style by Provincial House of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart.

Located in Alison Road is a two-storey Federation mansion named &quot;Ocean View&quot;. The house was built in 1916 by Philip Wirth, of Wirth&#x27;s Circus, and is heritage-listed. Other notable buildings in the area include &quot;Roslyn&quot;, a large Italianate house in Arcadia Street. It is heritage-listed.

===Coogee Palace Aquarium (1887–1986)===

The Coogee Aquarium and Swimming Baths were officially opened on 23 December 1887. It covered a block of land bordered by Arden Street, Beach Street, Bream Street, and Dolphin Street. The Palace included an indoor Swimming pool (25 x 10 metres), an aquarium featuring the tiger shark from the famous Shark Arm case, a great hall that could be used as a roller skating rink, Canadian toboggan ran down the hillside for over 70 metres, and a herd of 14 donkeys to ride, as well as swings, whirligigs, rocking horses, toy boats, aviaries, flower beds, bandstand, and an open-air bar.

In June 1945, a strong storm caused the large dome to collapse. In 1987, the Coogee Palace and Dome was re-built and converted to restaurants and bars. The former hotel on the premises was owned by investment banker David Kingston and was known both as The Beach Palace Hotel and The Aquarium. In August 2014, the building re-opened as the Coogee Pavilion in a $30 million+ renovation by the Merivale group, and its director Justin Hemmes.

===Eileen O&#x27;Connor and Our Lady&#x27;s Nurses for the Poor (1913)===
Eileen O&#x27;Connor, a devout but severely disabled young woman, met the first Catholic priest in charge of the Coogee parish, Fr Ted McGrath, in 1911. Together they determined to found an order of nurses dedicated to looking after the sick poor in their own homes. Despite the pain and partial paralysis from her spinal condition, O’Connor proved to be an indefatigable and intelligent organizer and teacher whose love and faith inspired her own and later generations of nurses. On 15 April 1913 in Coogee the pair co-founded Our Lady&#x27;s Nurses for the Poor. A donor bought for them a house at 35 Dudley Street, Coogee, which, with extensions, still houses the order. Despite many difficulties from Church authorities the order was firmly established by the time of Eileen&#x27;s death aged 28 in 1921. Under the leadership of Theresa (Cissie) McLaughlin and later superiors, it has continued to provide a range of services to those in need in inner Sydney and elsewhere. Eileen is buried in the Dudley Street property. The cause for her canonisation is under way and she is likely to become the second Australian canonised Catholic saint.


===The Coogee Pier (1928–1934)===
In 1924, construction started on an &quot;English seaside style&quot; amusement pier at Coogee Beach. On 24 July 1928, the pier was officially opened, reaching 180 metres out into the sea complete with a 1400-seat theatre, a 600 capacity ballroom, a 400-seat restaurant upstairs, small shops and a penny (machine) arcade. Unfortunately, Coogee&#x27;s rough surf damaged the pier and it was demolished in 1934. Lifeguards recently discovered remains of the pier on the ocean floor about 50 metres out from shore.

===Shark Arm murder case (1935)===

The Shark Arm case was an incident at the Coogee Aquarium Baths in 1935, when a captured tiger shark regurgitated a human arm. The arm belonged to a missing person, James Smith, who was identified by a tattoo. The arm had been cut off, which led to a murder investigation. Nobody was ever charged over the murder, although another local criminal, Reginald Holmes, was found shot in a car near the Sydney Harbour Bridge the day before the inquest into Smith&#x27;s death was due to start.

===Alleged Marian apparition (2003)===

In January 2003, it was noticed that one of the fence rails on Dolphin Point, just north of Coogee Beach, when viewed from a particular angle and distance, resembled a veiled woman. A local laundrette was one of the first to draw attention to it, and set up a gallery of photos to attract visiting &quot;pilgrims&quot;.

When this example of pareidolia, a human tendency to perceive vague visual stimuli as human faces, was reported in newspapers many Christians (predominantly Roman Catholic) came daily to worship what they interpreted as an apparition of Mary, the mother of Jesus, although the Roman Catholic Church never officially recognised this alleged apparition.

No particular supernatural powers were attributed to the shadow (dubbed &quot;Our Lady of the Fence Post&quot; by the media, aka &quot;Rail Mary&quot;) and interest waned within a few weeks. The section of fence that created the image was destroyed by vandals within days of it being publicised, although the local council had the fence replaced. While some continued to petition the Catholic Church and the New South Wales government to build a chapel, their claims were not seriously considered.

== Heritage listings ==
Coogee has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 45-51 Beach Street: &quot;Cliffbrook&quot;
* Grant Reserve: McIver Women&#x27;s Baths
* 4b Neptune Street: Wylie&#x27;s Baths
* St Brigid&#x27;s Catholic Church

==Transport==
Sydney&#x27;s steam tramways first reached Coogee in 1883 and were electrified in 1902. The trams were replaced by buses from time to time in the 1940s and 1950s as the infrastructure suffered severe neglect during and after World War II. The tracks were deemed too expensive to repair and the power supply was so inadequate that trams would grind to a halt in inconvenient locations. Eventually, the entire Sydney tram network was scrapped and replaced by buses. The last trams ran to Coogee in 1960.

There are usually many taxis in the area and there is a late night taxi rank on Friday and Saturday nights just behind the main bus stand on Arden Street. The suburb is now well served by buses; there is a bus interchange at the beach with three stands. The following outlines routes and their stands.

==Geography and landmarks==

Coogee Bay Road runs from Randwick to Coogee Beach which is relatively protected through its formation as a bay. The surrounding coastline is mostly cliffs, decreasing in height down to the beach in the western part of the bay. The bay is sheltered from the roughest seas by Wedding Cake Island, a rocky reef about 800m off the southern headland. There is an bi-annual swimming event around the island, normally in November &amp; April.

The beach itself drops off rapidly at the edge of the water, which can result in a dangerous shore break particularly when the surf is large. The combination of this shore break and high visitor numbers mean that Coogee has more spinal injuries than any other Australian beach.

In larger surf, there are often rip currents at both the northern end and at the southern ends, and also quite frequently in the centre of the beach. These are simply the places where the incoming water escapes most naturally. It is claimed by some locals that the rip in the centre of the beach is partly caused by the remaining foundations of the old entertainment pier (see above – history).
At the northern end of the beach are stairs leading from Dolphin Point down to the old Giles baths. This is now an open rock pool carved out of the surrounding rocks. This area is now known as &quot;Dolphin Point&quot;. The doorway and a four-metre high bronze sculpture serve as a memorial to twenty of the Australian victims of the 2002 Bali bombing who were residents of Coogee and its neighbouring suburbs, including six members of the Coogee Dolphins rugby league team.

A short walk further to the north is Gordons Bay, which is a popular location for snorkeling. At the southern end is the Ross Jones Memorial Pool just below the Coogee Surf Life Saving Club. Also at the southern end are two small reefs, the inner and the outer. Further south is a coastal walk that goes past the women&#x27;s baths and Wylie&#x27;s Baths.

Coogee is one of Australia&#x27;s more densely populated areas, with apartment buildings in every style from the 1930s onwards. Some free-standing houses remain.

<doc id="1048596" wikidata="Q253591" url="?curid=1048596" title="Winepress">
<text>A winepress is a device used to extract juice from crushed grapes during winemaking. There are a number of different styles of presses that are used by wine makers but their overall functionality is the same. Each style of press exerts controlled pressure in order to free the juice from the fruit (most often grapes). The pressure must be controlled, especially with grapes, in order to avoid crushing the seeds and releasing a great deal of undesirable tannins into the wine. Wine was being made at least as long ago as 4000 BC; in 2011, a winepress was unearthed in Armenia with red wine dated 6,000 years old.

==Press types==
===Casket===
A basket press consists of a large basket filled with the crushed grapes. Pressure is applied through a plate that is forced down onto the fruit. The mechanism to lower the plate is often either a screw or a hydraulic device. The juice flows through openings in the basket. The basket style press was the first type of mechanized press to be developed, and its basic design has not changed in nearly 10000 years.

===Horizontal screw===
A horizontal screw press works using the same principle as the basket press. Instead of a plate being brought down to put pressure on the grapes, plates from either side of a closed cylinder are brought together to squeeze the grapes. Generally the volume of grapes handled is significantly greater than that of a basket press.

===Bladder===
A bladder press consists of a large cylinder, closed at each end, into which the fruit is loaded. To press the grapes, a large bladder expands and pushes the grapes against the sides. The juice then flows out through small openings in the cylinder. The cylinder rotates during the process to help homogenize the pressure that is placed on the grapes.

===Continuous screw===
A continuous screw press differs from the above presses in that it does not process a single batch of grapes at a time. Instead it uses an Archimedes&#x27; screw to continuously force grapes up against the wall of the device. Juice is extracted, and the pomace continues through to the end where it is extracted. This style of press is rarely used to produce table wines, and some countries forbid its use for higher quality wines.

===Flash release===
Flash release is a technique used in winepressing. The treatment consists of heating the grapes with steam almost to boiling and then submitting them to a strong vacuum. The technique allows for a better extraction of phenolic compounds.

<doc id="1048606" wikidata="Q5332707" url="?curid=1048606" title="Echo Hill Ranch">
<text>Echo Hill Ranch is a summer ranch camp of about 400 acres (1.6 km2) in the Texas Hill Country. 
The ranch was founded in 1953 by Dr. S. Thomas Friedman and Minnie Samet Friedman. It is located south of 
Kerrville near Medina. Echo Hill was founded as a noncompetitive, child-centered ranch camp for boys and girls ages 6–14. It operated from the summer of 1953 through the summer of 2013 as a private camp for generations of children by the Friedman family. Campers and staff were mostly from Texas though a few came from international locations. Minnie Friedman died in 1985 but her family and close friends, Floyd and Joan Potter, continued the tradition of running the summer camp. The Friedmans were active in the American Camping Association (ACA), even setting the standards for what became best practices in summer camping. The staff taught children to swim, ride horses, play a number of different sports, enjoy arts and crafts, performing arts, camping, and things such as archery and riflery. Teens were taught leadership development and how to become staff members themselves. At the time of Dr. Tom Friedman&#x27;s death in 2002, it was decided that Roger, the middle child of the founders and resident of Maryland would become the director. Roger and his wife Roselynn (Roz) ran the camp, largely unchanged, for the next 10 summers before making the decision to shut it down. On July 24, 2013 the camp announced via their Facebook page that it would not reopen for summer of 2014.
Tom and Minnie&#x27;s youngest child, Marcie Friedman, is accredited by the ACA as a camp director. While she has been working for the state department for decades, she has been able to make new connections with military families and other interested parties to recreate Echo Hill Ranch as a place for Gold Star families (children who have lost a parent in the military) to come to camp, tuition free, with volunteer staff and operated by generous donations given by organizations and individuals interested in supporting such families. The inaugural year of Echo Hill Ranch Gold Star Camp was planned for the summer of 2020 but was instead pushed to 2021 because of COVID-19 concerns. 
Echo Hill Gold Star Camp attracts children from all over the country and volunteers, mostly military, assist in the upkeep of the facility and the large number of responsibilities associated in running a summer camp.
Echo Hill Ranch was the residence of Texas musician, writer, and gubernatorial candidate Kinky Friedman until his death on June 26, 2024.

<doc id="1048608" wikidata="Q6235201" url="?curid=1048608" title="John Gerretsen">
<text>John Philip Gerretsen (born June 9, 1942) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2014 who represented the eastern Ontario riding of Kingston and the Islands. He served as a Minister in the Cabinets of Premiers Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne.

==Early life==
Gerretsen was born in Hilversum, Netherlands during World War II, and moved to Canada with his parents in 1954. He was educated at Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario, receiving a BA degree in 1964 and an LL.B in 1967. He subsequently worked as a solicitor, serving with Manulife Insurance Company in Toronto from 1969 to 1970. His son Mark Gerretsen served as a Kingston, Ontario city councillor and was elected mayor in 2010.

==Municipal politics==
Gerretsen&#x27;s political career began in the early 1970s at the municipal level. He was elected as a Kingston Alderman in 1972, and remained on the City Council until 1980 (serving as Deputy Mayor from 1976 to 1980). Gerretsen was elected Mayor of the city in 1980, and was re-elected twice before stepping down in 1988. He was also President of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario from 1986 to 1987, and a trustee of Queen&#x27;s University from 1981 to 1992.

After retiring from municipal politics, Gerretsen served as the Chair of the Ontario Housing Corporation (1989–1992) and was a Deputy Judge in the province&#x27;s Small Claims Court (1993–1995). He also became active in politics at the provincial and federal levels. Gerretsen was an Executive Member of the Ontario Liberal Party&#x27;s Kingston and the Islands riding association from 1989 to 1993, and was President of the Liberal Party of Canada&#x27;s federal riding association from 1993 to 1995.

==Provincial politics==
Gerretsen was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Progressive Conservative candidate Sally Barnes and incumbent New Democrat Gary Wilson in Kingston and the Islands. This was a close three-way race—Gerretsen received 10,314 votes, Barnes 8,571, and Wilson 8,052.

The general election was won by the Progressive Conservatives and Gerretsen entered parliament as a member of the opposition, serving as Opposition Critic on Municipal Affairs and Housing and Chief Opposition Whip.

In 1996, he ran to succeed Lyn McLeod as leader of the Ontario Liberal Party. Gerretsen was generally regarded as being on the right-wing of the party, and achieved some support in his home base of eastern Ontario. He placed fifth out of seven candidates on the first ballot, and dropped out after the second ballot. After withdrawing, he gave his support to Dalton McGuinty, the eventual winner.

Gerretsen was easily re-elected in the 1999 provincial election, although the Progressive Conservatives were again victorious across the province. Gerretsen continued as Opposition Whip, and remained a vocal Liberal MPP for the next four years.

===McGuinty government===
The Liberal Party won the 2003 election with 72 seats out of 103, and Gerretsen was re-elected with over 60% support. On October 23, 2003, he was named Minister of Municipal Affairs, with responsibility for seniors. In March 2004, his portfolio was renamed the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing.

Gerretsen was the primary spokesperson for the McGuinty government in its controversial decision to permit further housing expansion on the Oak Ridges Moraine, despite an election promise not to do so. The Liberals claimed that they lacked the legal authority to prevent further development in the area. His main legislative success has been in leading in the enactment of a 1.8 million acre (7,300 km2) green belt surrounding the City of Toronto in 2005.

After a cabinet shuffle on June 29, 2005, the responsibility for seniors issues was transferred to another government minister. Gerretsen was retained as Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing.

In the 2007 election of October 10, 2007, Gerretsen won re-election with just under 50% support. On October 29, 2007, Gerretsen was appointed as Minister of the Environment.

On August 18, 2010, Gerretsen was moved to the post of Minister of the Consumer Services.

He won re-election in the October 6, 2011 election. He was appointed Attorney General of Ontario and was re-appointed when Kathleen Wynne became premier in early 2013.

On October 25, 2013, Gerretsen announced that he would not run in the next election. Just before his retirement at the June 2014 election, Gerretsen was moved from the Attorney-General portfolio to that of Chair of Cabinet.

===Cabinet positions===



==Electoral record==












==Personal life==
On March 19, 2020, amid the coronavirus pandemic, Gerretsen tested positive for COVID-19, with his wife Assunta testing positive earlier that week, after they were both repatriated to Canada from the &quot;Grand Princess&quot; cruise ship; they were quarantined at CFB Trenton.

<doc id="1048610" wikidata="Q2118549" url="?curid=1048610" title="Allograph">
<text>In graphemics and typography, the term allograph is used of a glyph that is a design variant of a letter or other grapheme, such as a letter, a number, an ideograph, a punctuation mark or other typographic symbol. In graphemics, an obvious example in English (and many other writing systems) is the distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters. Allographs can vary greatly, without affecting the underlying identity of the grapheme. Even if the word &quot;cat&quot; is rendered as &quot;cAt&quot;, it remains recognizable as the sequence of the three graphemes , , . 

Letters and other graphemes can also have significant variations that may be missed by many readers. The letter g, for example, has two common forms in different typefaces, and a wide variety in people&#x27;s handwriting. A positional example of allography is the long s , a symbol which was once a widely used as a non-final allograph for the lowercase letter s. 

A grapheme variant can acquire a separate meaning in a specialized writing system, such as the International Phonetic Alphabet used in linguistics. Several such variants have distinct code points in Unicode and thus are not allographs for some applications.

== Typography ==
In typography, the term &#x27;allograph&#x27; is used more specifically to describe the different representations of the same grapheme or character in different typefaces. The resulting glyphs may look quite different in shape and style from the reference character or each other, but nevertheless their meaning remains the same. 

In Unicode, a given character is allocated a code point: all allographs of that character have the same code point and thus the essential meaning is retained irrespective of font choice at time of printing or display. Typically, for example, is given a loop tail in serif typefaces but not in sans-serif faces (e.g., Times New Roman: g, Helvetica: g) but its code point is constant and its meaning persists irrespective of typeface.

=== Typography of Han characters ===

In the Han script, there exist several graphemes that have more than one written representation. Han typefaces often contain many variants of some graphemes. Different regional standards have adopted certain character variants. For instance:

==Homoglyph==
The concept of the allograph may be compared and contrasted with that of the homoglyph glyphs of different meaning that are visually similar. For example, the letter O and the figure 0 have similar shape but have different meanings; the three letters A, Α and А look identical but are characters from three different scripts (Latin, Greek and Cyrillic).

<text>Kathleen Walsh (15 November 1911 – 16 April 2005) was an English actress, dancer, and screenwriter. Her film career prospered after she met her future husband, film director David Lean, with whom she worked on productions such as &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Walsh was born on 15 November 1911 in Chelsea, London. She was raised in Pimlico by her grandmother. She began her career as a dancer in West End music halls, and at the age of 17 she began going out with Pownoll Pellew (later 9th Viscount Exmouth), and they shared an interest in sports cars. She made her film debut in &quot;How&#x27;s Chances?&quot; (1934) in a small part, and had a larger role in &quot;Get Your Man&quot;, another 1934 film. She continued to act in &quot;quota quickies&quot; films for several years. Walsh first met David Lean, then a film editor, in 1936, during the filming of &quot;Secret of Stamboul&quot;. They began a relationship, and Walsh broke her engagement to Pellew. Walsh and Lean married on 23 November 1940. She appeared in the films &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; (1942) and &quot;This Happy Breed&quot; (1944), both directed by Lean and written by Noël Coward. Walsh campaigned for Lean to receive co-director credit on &quot;In Which We Serve&quot;.

Walsh contributed dialogue to the 1938 film of &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, and devised the scenario for the closing sequence of Lean&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1946), receiving a writing credit on the latter film. She devised the opening sequence of Lean&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1948) and played Nancy. Walsh and Lean divorced in 1949 on grounds of infidelity based on Lean&#x27;s relationship with actress Ann Todd. Walsh continued to work as a character actress in films through the 1950s, including films with Alfred Hitchcock and Ronald Neame. Her own favourite film role was that of the barmaid Miss D. Coker in Neame&#x27;s 1958 film of &quot;The Horse&#x27;s Mouth&quot;, with Alec Guinness.

Between films, Walsh appeared regularly in plays and farces at the Strand and Aldwych theatres, directed by Basil Dean. She starred with Peter Coke in the 1938 thriller &quot;Death on the Table&quot; and Ralph Lynn at Aldwych in the 1940 comedy &quot;Nap Hand&quot;. She was a semi-regular on the 1979 Anglo-Polish TV series &quot;Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson&quot;, and remained active in films until her retirement in 1981. Her last role was in &quot;Night Crossing&quot; (1982).

==Second marriage, later life and death==
Walsh&#x27;s second marriage was to the Canadian psychoanalyst Elliott Jaques, and they adopted daughter Gemma in 1956. This marriage also ended in divorce.

Walsh lived in retirement in London. She died on 16 April 2005 at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, aged 93, from multiple burns, following an accident.

<text>Mürzzuschlag () is a town in northeastern Styria, Austria, the capital of the former Mürzzuschlag District. It is located on the Mürz river near the Semmering Pass, the border with the state of Lower Austria, about southwest of Vienna. The population is 8,684 (1 January 2016). Originally an industrial area, the nearby mountains are today a popular ski resort.
==History==
The settlement in the Duchy of Styria was first documented in 1227. The minnesinger Ulrich von Liechtenstein in his 1265 poem &quot;Frauendienst&quot; mentioned &quot;Murzuslage&quot;, which he passed on his journey from Venice to Vienna. In 1360 the Habsburg duke Rudolf IV confirmed the inhabitants&#x27; privilege of iron production, competing with the town of Leoben.

In 1854 the Semmering railway opened, by which the Austrian Southern Railway company provided direct access to Vienna, largely promoting the local economy. The Bleckmann steel mill was founded in 1862, it is today part of Böhler-Uddeholm. 
A railway museum exhibits a collection of steam locomotives, associated equipment and rolling stock.

In the late 19th century, the mountainous Semmering area was the site of the first alpine skiing attempts in Central Europe, which made it one of the oldest ski resorts of Austria, documented by the world&#x27;s largest skiing and winter sports museum. Mürzzuschlag received town privileges in 1923.

===1931 Workers&#x27; Olympiad===
On February 5–8, 1931 the second winter Workers&#x27; Olympiad organised by the Socialist Workers&#x27; Sport International was held in the town. The games were larger (both in number of participants and spectators) than the 1932 Winter Olympics held in Lake Placid, New York, United States.

==Population==

==Twin towns — sister cities==

Mürzzuschlag is twinned with:
* Arusha, Tanzania
* Blansko, Czech Republic
* Chillán, Chile

== Notable people ==

* Johannes Brahms (1833–1897) wrote his Symphony No. 4 locally during his in 1884/1885 summer vacations, this led to the establishment of the local Brahms museum

<text>William of Kilkenny (died 21 September 1256) was a Lord Chancellor of England and Bishop of Ely.

==Life==
William may be the same William of Kilkenny who was elected Bishop of Ossory in 1231, but resigned the office in 1232 before being consecrated. Whether or not that was the case, the man who later became bishop of Ely was a king&#x27;s clerk by 1234. He was sent to Rome on royal business twice, once in 1234–1235 and again in 1237. In 1238 he left royal service, and was employed by two successive bishops of Durham, Nicholas of Farnham and Richard Poore. By May 1247 he was back in royal service, for in that month King Henry III of England sent him overseas.

William was Archdeacon of Coventry, from November 1247, as well as controller of the wardrobe from 1249 to 1252, and chancellor from 1250 to 1255.

William was elected to the see of Ely about 29 September 1254 and consecrated on 15 August 1255 at Bellay in Savoy by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Boniface of Savoy.

William died on 21 September 1256, in Spain where he had gone on a diplomatic mission for the king. His heart was sent to Ely for burial in Ely Cathedral. His only known relative was a nephew who held land in Waterford and was knighted in 1254. He had constructed an elaborate tomb that remained empty, and is now located near the high altar in the north choir aisle of Ely Cathedral. His heart was buried near the altar of Saint Etheldreda.

<doc id="1048637" wikidata="Q6173905" url="?curid=1048637" title="Jeff Godwin">
<text>Jeffrey Godwin is a Christian fundamentalist preacher and author from Bloomington, Indiana, USA. He is best known for his numerous books critical of both secular and Christian rock music. Godwin is a former drug addict and rock musician. He claims that he survived the stampede that claimed the lives of 12 fans of The Who at their Cincinnati concert on December 3, 1979.

==Conversion==
Godwin was converted to fundamentalist Christianity in 1984 by his future wife&#x27;s family. Subsequently, Godwin became a King James Only fundamentalist very much in line with Jack Chick, who published his first three works.

==Teachings on rock music==
According to Godwin, rock and roll music traces its origins back thousands of years. Its rhythms were written by Satan and his demons and have a subliminal power to control a listener&#x27;s mind. The rhythms eventually found their way, via Africa, into blues, jazz and other forms of African American music before they appeared in rock music. In addition, rock music is loaded with references to sexual behavior of all kinds, and he believes it encourages fornication amongst youths and inspires lust. He also believe it inspires rage and it preaches &quot;rebellion, hatred, drug abuse, suicide, fornication and the dark things of Satan&quot;.

When Ozzy Osbourne bit the head off a dove, Godwin viewed it as Osbourne&#x27;s desire to destroy the Holy Spirit, which is often represented by a dove. Satanic symbols dating back centuries, Godwin maintains, can be found in the album covers of rock music, testifying to Satan&#x27;s power. While Godwin believes that Satanic messages have been backmasked (recorded backwards) on rock albums, he believes that Satan&#x27;s presence in rock music has rarely required hiding. Godwin sees Satan&#x27;s influence in music as being maintained by secret alliances between rock musicians, producers and promoters uniting with demons and Satan himself. He further believes that Christian rock is another diversion created by Satan, as the rock music industry itself is compromised by Satan. The Christianity preached in Christian rock, he says, is feel good, inoffensive and does not genuinely preach Christ.

<doc id="1048640" wikidata="Q3442521" url="?curid=1048640" title="Flinders Street, Melbourne">
<text>Flinders Street is a street in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Running roughly parallel to the Yarra River, Flinders Street forms the southern edge of the Hoddle Grid. It is exactly in length and one and a half chains () in width.

The street is named after the English explorer, Matthew Flinders, who was erroneously credited with discovering Port Phillip at the time of its naming. It extends eastwards as far as Spring Street and the Treasury Gardens and, originally, westwards to Spencer Street, but now continues past Batman&#x27;s Hill to the Melbourne Docklands. As the closest street to the river, Flinders Street served Melbourne&#x27;s original river port. The Customs House, now the site of Victoria&#x27;s Immigration Museum, is on Flinders Street.


The street is home to Flinders Street station, the central station in Melbourne&#x27;s suburban rail network. Tram routes 70 and 75, as well as the City Circle route, run along Flinders Street, and the Flinders Street Viaduct runs roughly parallel to the street, linking the city&#x27;s two major railway stations.

Other landmarks along Flinders Street include Federation Square, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Young and Jackson Hotel, the Banana Alley Vaults, the old Herald &amp; Weekly Times building, Melbourne Aquarium and Batman Park, which adjoins the Yarra River. The land between the south side of Flinders Street and the railway viaduct between Spencer and King Streets was once home to the Melbourne City Markets, an ornate building constructed in 1890, covering 23,000 square metres. The market buildings were demolished between 1958 and 1960, after which the site became a public carpark. The site is now home to the three towers of the Northbank Place complex which includes office space, residential apartments, retail outlets and a multi-level carpark. The Melbourne Fish Market was situated on the south side of the railway viaduct, facing Spencer Street, having been displaced from the south-west corner of Flinders and Swanston Streets when the present Flinders Street station was constructed in the early 1900s. The site of the former Fish Market now forms the western end of Batman Park.

==King Street Overpass==
In the late 1950s, an overpass was built to take King Street over its intersection with Flinders Street, as part of the construction of the King Street Bridge and Kings Way. The overpass extended from Downie Street to just east of Custom House Lane.

Excavation commenced on the foundations of the southern side of the overpass on 6 January 1959 and, by 7 September, the first steel girders were erected. Upon completion of the first stage on 21 November 1959, trams were diverted onto temporary tracks laid by the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board on that part of the structure. On 23 November 1959, construction on the foundations on the northern side of the overpass commenced and, by 20 February 1960, the remainder of the steelwork on that portion was erected. Following the erection of beams and the concreting of decks and permanent tram tracks, trams were diverted from the temporary tracks during the weekend of 11–13 June 1960. The northern traffic lanes heading eastbound were opened to traffic on 1 July 1960, with southbound lanes open not long afterwards.

Many businesses and properties were overshadowed by the overpass which resulted in property values dropping and the closure of hotels, shops and showrooms. Plans to revitalise the area in the early 1960s never eventuated. In May 2002, the state government announced it would be demolished, but it was May 2005 before work commenced, with preparations for Melbourne&#x27;s 2006 Commonwealth Games acting as a catalyst. The project concluded in August.

==2017 car attack==

On 21 December 2017, a driver ploughed through a crowd on Flinders Street, injuring 19 pedestrians. The perpetrator, Saeed Noori, appeared in court on 23 December, charged with 18 counts of attempted murder and one count of reckless conduct endangering life. According to the Melbourne Police, Noori, a 32-year-old Australian of Afghan descent, had a history of assault, drug use and mental health issues. He was remanded in custody and ordered to undergo a psychiatric assessment.

<text>Nicholas of Ely was Lord Chancellor of England, Bishop of Worcester, Bishop of Winchester, and Lord High Treasurer in the 13th century.

==Life==

Nicholas was Archdeacon of Ely when he was first appointed chancellor by Henry III in 1260, but he was sacked in favour of Walter de Merton in 1261. His politics were in favour of the Montfortian dispensation in parliament created by the Provisions of Oxford. He supported the new activism for which compromises could be extracted on liberties from the King in exchange for voting money. But on his return from France, Henry III was absolved by the Pope from upholding the provisions. A bull was published in which the reforms were renounced. Both the Justiciar, Hugh Despenser, and the Chancellor were dismissed in favour of the faction around the Marcher Lords. However the offices of state were not abolished, and nor would the overthrow of the provisions mean punishment for the former officials.

Nicholas also held prebends in the diocese of London and was a papal chaplain. Nicholas was a popular reformist figure when he returned to office, although De Montfort insisted that the Council now had the power to appoint, he was appointed Treasurer at the Oxford parliament in April 1263. Montfort&#x27;s victory at Windsor and Bristol over the royalists could mean that Nicholas would once more be favoured by his ally, he was granted the office of Chancellor in August, but lost both offices later in the year. He was elected to the see of Worcester about 8 June 1266 and consecrated on 19 September 1266. He was enthroned at Worcester Cathedral on 26 September 1266.

Nicholas was translated to the see of Winchester on 2 March 1268 by Pope Clement IV. He was enthroned at Winchester Cathedral on 27 May 1268.

Nicholas died on 12 February 1280.

<text>The City of Tea Tree Gully is a local council in the Australian state of South Australia, in the outer north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide. The major business district in the city is at Modbury, where Westfield Tea Tree Plaza, Modbury Hospital, the Civic Centre and the library are located.

Howard, Lord Florey, Australian pathologist and co-discoverer of penicillin, was a resident of the City of Tea Tree Gully. 

== History ==

The Tea Tree gully itself passes through the Adelaide foothills roughly marking the easiest path eastwards from Grand Junction Road to Gumeracha. The 1850s settlement at the entrance to the gully (approximately where North East Road enters the foothills) was known as the village of &#x27;Steventon&#x27; after local resident and miller, John Stevens, who was a major landowner in the area. The name Steventon is retained as one of the electoral wards of the City of Tea Tree Gully.

The council was originally proclaimed in October 1858 as the District Council of Tea Tree Gully, when the northern half of the District Council of Highercombe, which had been created in 1853, successfully seceded to form its own municipality. In the early 1930s, the two councils were considered unviable, being very small in relative size and population. The District Council of Highercombe was included in a Local Government Commission list of 53 local councils with annual revenue of less than £2000. Following the commission recommendation, the two councils were recombined under the name Tea Tree Gully in May 1935.

It inherited the former 1855 Highercombe council chambers, which had been built in Tea Tree Gully, and used that building until 1967. The Old Tea Tree Gully Council Chambers survive today and are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register, having been the first purpose-built district council chambers in South Australia. In 1967 the Tea Tree Gully civic centre was opened, comprising a new council chamber and civic hall. The municipality was granted city status and proclaimed as the City of Tree Gully in 1968.

A council-owned colonial building was converted into a community art gallery, and is now known as Gallery 1855. The gallery hosts regular contemporary art and craft exhibitions and artist-led workshops.

From 1954 to 1971 the population of Tea Tree Gully council rose from just over 2,500 to almost 37,000, and in 1975 it had reached approximately 55,000 as urban residential development quickly expanded. By 2004 the population had exceeded 100,000.

==Council==

== Geography ==

The gully to which the city name refers actually exists and is known to be sizable as it provided a gradient negotiable only by bullock wagons travelling through the Mt. Lofty Ranges. Additionally the gully had permanent freshwater springs which promoted the growth of tea trees in the area – thus the eventual name &#x27;Tea Tree Gully&#x27;.

The Anstey Hill Recreation Park is adjacent to the suburbs of Vista and Tea Tree Gully.

<text>Raum the Old (Old Norse: &quot;Raumr inn gamli&quot;) is a legendary king in Norway in the &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot; and in Thorsteins saga Víkingssonar. The saga of &quot;Hversu Noregr byggðist&quot; tells of two kings known as Raum. It is not simple to tell them apart; although the author of the saga appears to have put in some clues. 

==In &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot;==
The first King Raum is son of the eponymous first king of Norway, King Nór and Queen Hedda (&quot;Höððu)&quot;. The second Raum is the first King Raum&#x27;s and Queen Bergdis&#x27; grandson through their son Jötunbjörn the Old. The second Raum is by all probability King Raum the Old. In &quot;Hversu Noregr byggðist&quot;, as well as other sagas, such as Örvar Odd&#x27;s saga, the cognomen &quot;inn gamli&quot; - the Old - refers to the person&#x27;s longevity, not as in the elder or younger of two. Quite specifically the cognomen &quot;inn gamli&quot; refers to a certain capability of death-defiance acquired by certain sacrifices (&quot;bloþ),&quot; typically lasting for three hundred years (signifying 360 years as hundred in Norse meant 120, not 100). This is explained in the saga itself. At least three kings in this and other sagas has aquired this cognomen explicitly this way:

- Snœr the Old, the grandfather of King Nór, father to King Raum the First, who is grandfather to Raum the Old

- Halfdan the Old, grandson to Raum the Old and father to nine royal lineages, among them Næfill, the eponymous anchestor of the Niebelungen, famous through Richard Wagner&#x27;s operacycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;

- Örvar Odd, by Saxo Grammaticus depicted as father to Rurik, the eponymous anchestor to the first tsar-dynasty, the Rurikids. In the Primary Chronicle he is called Oleg the Wise.

It is not specified that Jötunbjörn the Old, or Raum the Old performs the same death-defying ritual sacrifice, yet they are in the specific lineage of kings that performs it.

In concordance with the apparent meaning of Raumr&#x27;s name, the sagas tell that he looks more like a jotun than a human. It is stated that his daughter Bryngerd, who was married to Álf the Old, grandfather of Gandalf, was not beautiful, in spite of being the first queen of the Elves; because Raumr had a terryfying look (&quot;ljótr&quot;). Indeed, the word raumr meant in norse times an ugly, terrifying, or even disgusting person, sometimes clumsy, clownish. This Raum who is the father of Bryngerd, narrated in Þorstein saga Vikingsonar, appears less likely to be King Raum the Old Björnson but his grandfather Raum Nórson, as the crossreferences regarding the lineage of Alf and that of Raum seems more compelling.

===King Raum Nórson and Queen Bergdis===
In &quot;Hversu Noregr byggðist&quot;, Raum is one of the three sons of Nór, the legendary first king of Norway, and succeeds his father as king. His brothers are Thrond (&quot;Þranðr&quot;), the namesake of Trondheim (&quot;Þranðheim&quot;) and Gard (&quot;Garðr)&quot; who is called Agde (&quot;Agði),&quot; which is the name of the southernmost county in Norway - Agder. 

Raum attended a Yule feast given by Bergfin (&quot;Bergfinnr&quot;) son of Thrym (&quot;Þrymr&quot;) the Giant of Vermland and bedded Bergfin&#x27;s sister Bergdís (&quot;Bergdís&quot;). Bergdís subsequently bore three sons: Björn (&quot;Bjǫrn&quot; &#x27;bear&#x27;), Brand (&quot;Brandr&quot; &#x27;torch&#x27;, &#x27;fire&#x27;, &#x27;prow or stern-plank&#x27;, &#x27;sword-blade&#x27;), and Álf (&quot;Álfr&quot; &#x27;elf&#x27;). Álf was fostered by Bergfin himself and so became known as Finnálf (&quot;Finnálfr&quot;). Björn was kept by his mother and his name was expanded to Jötunbjörn (&quot;Jǫtunbjǫrn&quot; &#x27;Giant-bear&#x27;). Brand was sent to his father Raum who dedicated him to the gods (whatever &quot;guðunum&quot; means exactly), and so he was afterwards known as Gudbrand (&quot;Guðbrandr&quot; &#x27;God-sword&#x27;, &#x27;Goth-torch&#x27;). Jotunbjörn in turn gets a son known as Raum the King

Raum the Old Björnsson 

It is not obvious who is the mother of Hrossbjörnar by the text of &quot;Hversu Norégr byggðist&quot; alone, but the lineage may provide some answers from other sagas and texts. Vatsdælasaga starts with the third Raum, Ketil Raum, great grandson of Raum son of Jotunbjörn. 

It seems quite clear that it is Raum, the son of Jotunbjörn, that after having the son Hrossbjörn had Hild (&quot;Hildr&quot;) daughter of Gudröd the Old (&quot;Guðrǫðr inn gamli&quot;) the son of King Sölvi (&quot;Sǫlvi&quot;) who first ruled the land now called Sóleyjar (cognate with the modern region of Solør comprising the municipalities of Grue, Åsnes, and Våler). 

The passage in Ynglinga saga about Olaf Treteglju is one of the more obscure, or cryptic. Both &quot;Hversu Noregr byggðist&quot; and &quot;Ynglingasaga&quot; refers to King Sölva the Old who first cleared Sóleyar. Yet there are some distinctions. Actually &quot;Ynglingasaga&quot; doesn&#x27;t refers directly to King Sölva, but tells that Olaf, through whom the ancient bloodline of the Uppsala High Kings of the Ynglings goes, gets Sölva, or Sölveig.. The text of Snorre Sturlasson&#x27;s &quot;Ynglingesaga&quot; is curiously expressing a gender-confusion regarding the wife of Olaf Treteglju:
&quot;Ólafr fékk konu þeirrar, er Sölveig hét eða Sölva, dóttir Hálfdanar gulltannar vestan af Sóleyjum. Hálfdan var son Sölva, Sölvarssonar, Sölvasonar hins gamla, er fyrstr ruddi Sóleyjar.&quot; 
Olaf got his wife who was named Sölveig, or Sölva, daughter to Hálfdan Goldtooth west of Soleyjum. Halfdan was son to Sölva, the sons of Sölvar, sons of Sölva the Old, that cleared the land of Sóleyjar first. 
It may seem at first glance that there is a huge gap of generations, impossibilitating a coherence between the two sagas, but on the other hand not. The plurality of Sölvas, as well as the explicitly stated death defiance of several of the ones with the cognomen &quot;the Old,&quot; makes the puzzle possible; not as historical realism, but as in holding an inherent coherence. 
lived much later, making this Sölvi to be the father of a second Sölvi, the father of Halfdan Goldtooth (&quot;Hálfdanr Gulltanni&quot;), the father of Sólveig or Sölva who married Ólaf Woodcutter (&quot;Ólafr Trételgja&quot;). But &quot;Af Upplendinga Konungum&quot; claims that Olaf&#x27;s wife Sölva was the sister of King Sölvi the Old.

By his wife Hild, Raum the Old became father of four sons: Gudröd (&quot;Guðröðar&quot;), Hauk (&quot;Haukr&quot;), Hadding (&quot;Haddingr&quot;), and Hring (&quot;Hringr&quot;).

===Descendants of Raum Nórson===
====Descendants of Gudbrand====
Gudbrand inherited the valley Gudbrandsdal from his father Raum. King Gudbrand was father of King Audleif (&quot;Auðleifr&quot;), father of King Gudmund (&quot;Guðmundr&quot;), father of Gudbrand who refused to be king, gave himself an earl&#x27;s name (&quot;Jarl Guðbrand)&quot; instead, as he wanted to become the mightiest earl (or most rich) in the northern lands. Jarl Gudbrand&#x27;s son was Jarl Geirmund (&quot;Geirmundr&quot;), father of Jarl Hródgeir (&quot;Hróðgeirr&quot;), father of Gudbrand who refused the title of jarl (earl) and called himself &quot;hersir&quot; (cf. centaurion, chief of a hundred) as did his descendants.

====Descendants of Jötunbjörn====
Jötunbjörn the Old inherited Raumaranes Dale from his father King Raum. (Raums Dale is the modern district of Romerike in the county of Akershus. Jötunbjörn was father of King Raum, father of Hrossbjörn (&quot;Hrossbjǫrn&quot;), father of Orm Broken-shell (&quot;Ormr Skjelamoli&quot;), father of Knatti who had two sons: Thórolf (&quot;Þórolfr&quot;) and Ketil Raum (&quot;Ketill Raumr&quot;). A variant of this genealogy appears at the beginning of the &quot;Vatnsdæla saga&quot; in which Ketil the Large is the direct son of Orm Broken-shell with no mention of either Knatti or of Ketil&#x27;s brother Thórolf. Also nothing is said of Jötunbjörn&#x27;s ancestry, only that he was from the north of Norway.
The &quot;Hversu&quot; then relates that Thórolf was father of Helgi, the father of Bersi, the father of Thormód (&quot;Þormóðr&quot;), the father of Thórlaug (&quot;Þórlaugr&quot;) who was the mother of Tungu-Odd (&quot;Tungu-Oddr&quot;). In the &quot;Landnámabók&quot; (1:15) it is said that two brothers whose ancestry is not given settled the Akraness in Iceland between Kalman&#x27;s river (&quot;Kalmansár&quot;) and Char river (&quot;Aurridaár&quot;). One was Thormod who settled the land to the south of Reymir, and dwelt at Holm; he was the father of Bersi and Geirlaug, the mother of Tungu-Odd (&quot;Tungu-Oddr&quot;). The other was named Ketil. Further information appears in the Landnámabók (1.20). Tungu-Odd is a major character in &quot;Hænsna-Thóris saga&quot; (&quot;Hen-Thórir&#x27;s saga&quot;). Geirlaug rather than Thorlaug is the name of Tungu-Odd&#x27;s mother in all accounts except for that of the &quot;Hversu&quot;.

====Descendants of Finnálf the Old====
According to the &quot;Hversu&quot;, Finnalf inherited the land of East Dale (&quot;Eystri-Dal&quot;, modern day Østerdalen) and all the land north of Lake Vænir (modern Lake Vänern) from the Gautelfr (the modern Göta älv river) north to the Raumelfi (the modern Rauma (river) ), and that the land was then called Álfheim.

Finnálf married Svanhild (&quot;Svanhildr&quot;) who was called Gold-feather (&quot;Gullfjǫðr&quot;) and was the daughter of Day (&quot;Dagr&quot;) son of Dayspring (&quot;Dellingr&quot;) by Sun (&quot;Sól&quot;) daughter of &quot;Mundilfari&quot;. Dag as a personification of day and the sun-goddess Sól are mentioned elsewhere, but only the &quot;Hversu&quot; mentions their daughter. Svanhild bore Finnálf a son named Svan the Red (&quot;Svanr inn rauðr&quot;) who was father of Sæfari, father of Úlf (&quot;Úlfr&quot;), father of Álf, father of Ingimund (&quot;Ingimundr&quot;) and Eystein (&quot;Eysteinn&quot;).

According to the eddic poem &quot;Hyndluljód&quot; (stanza 12), Óttar, whose genealogy is the subject of this poem, was son of Innstein (&quot;Innsteinn&quot;), son of Álf the Old, son of Úlf, son of Sæfari, son of Svan the Red. So the Innstein of the &quot;Hyndluljód&quot; and &quot;Eystein&quot; of the &quot;Hversu&quot; are presumably identical.

=== Descendants of Raum the Old Björnsson ===

====Descendants of Gudröd====
Gudröd, Raum&#x27;s eldest legitimate son, inherited the largest portion of his father&#x27;s lands. Gudröd&#x27;s son was Eystein the Wicked (&quot;Eysteinn illráði&quot;) who conquered part of Trondheim and set his son Önund over it. When Önund was killed in a revolt, Eystein made his dog, Saur, king of the territory. The tale is also told more fully as a deed of long ago in the &quot;Saga of Hakon the Good&quot; in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; where Eystein (no parentage given) is said to be King of the Uplands in Norway, part of the modern county of Oppland. See Snær for another use of the dog king motif.

====Descendants of Höd====
Höd ruled over Hadeland (&quot;Haðaland&quot;). Höd was father of Höddbrodd (&quot;Hǫðbroddr&quot;). (The name Höd is identical to that born by the slayer of the god Baldr in other tales. And while the Höd of the &quot;Hversu&quot; is said to be father of a son named Höddbrodd, in Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (Book 3) Høtherus, the slayer of Balderus, is the son of Hothbrodus or Hothbroddus.) 

The &quot;Hversu&quot; relates that Höddbrodd son of Höd was the father of Hrólf (&quot;Hrólfr&quot;), father of Hrómund Berserk (&quot;Hrómundr berserkr&quot;), father of three children: Hámund (&quot;Hámundr&quot;), Haki, and Gunnlöd (&quot;Gunnlǫð&quot;).

Hámund was Earl of Hordaland and father of Hrók the Black (&quot;Hrókr inn svartr&quot;) and Hrók the White (&quot;Hrókr inn hvítr&quot;). Haki was father of Hródgeir (&quot;Hróðgeirr&quot;), father of Haki Berserk. Gunnlöd was the mother of Útstein (&quot;Ústeinn&quot;) and Innstein (&quot;Innsteinn&quot;). In &quot;Hálfs saga ok Hálfsrekka&quot; (&#x27;The saga of Hálf and his heroes&#x27;), the two brothers named Hrók and the brothers Útstein (&quot;Útstein&quot;) and Innstein play prominent roles. This saga names the father of Útstein and Instein as a Jarl named Álf the Old of Hordaland, which is one of Hálf&#x27;s kingdoms.

Hrók the Black was the father of Gunnlöd (&quot;Gunnlǫð&quot;) the mother of Hrómund Gripsson, the protagonist of &quot;Hrómundar saga Gripssonar&quot; (&#x27;Saga of Hrómund Gripsson&#x27;). Two sons of Hrómund named Björnólf (&quot;Bjǫrnólfr&quot;) and Hróald (&quot;Hróaldr&quot;) appear among the first Norse settlers in Iceland in the &quot;Landnámabók&quot; (1.3) and are mentioned in other sagas.

====Descendants of Hadding====
The &quot;Hversu&quot; tells that Hadding (&quot;Haddingr&quot;) son of Raum ruled over Haddingjadal and Telemark (&quot;Þelamǫrk&quot;). He was father of son also named Hadding, who himself was father of another Hadding, father of Högni the Red. The &quot;Hversu&quot; then comments cryptically that after him the three Haddings (&quot;Haddingjar&quot;) took power, that they ruled one after the other, and that Helgi Hadding-prince (&quot;Haddingjaskati&quot;) was one of them.

The &quot;Haddingjar&quot; are otherwise known as two of the sons of Arngrim of which the fullest account is in &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; and are certainly not the Haddingjar spoken of by the &quot;Hversu&quot;. (But some suspect all references to the Haddingjar are garblings of old traditions about the divine twins.) Helgi &quot;Haddingjaskati&quot; is mentioned in the prose epilogue to the eddic poem &quot;Helgavida Hundingsbana II&quot; which states that Helgi Hundingsbane and his Valkyrie and his lover Sigrún were afterwards reincarnated as Helgi &quot;Haddingjaskati&quot; and Kára as told in the &quot;Káraljód&quot; (&quot;Káraljóðr&quot;), a poem no longer extant. A version of this tale survives only in &quot;Hrómundar saga Gripssonar&quot; in which the &quot;Haldingjar&quot; are two concurrent kings of Sweden and Helgi is their champion. Helgi conquers in part through the magic of his lover, the sorceress Kára, who appears in the form of a swan. When Helgi accidentally kills her, he meets his own doom and the Halding kings flee. &quot;Haldingjar&quot; seems to a garblings of &quot;Haddingjar&quot;. The &quot;Hversu&quot; account probably indicates a version in which both Helgi and the two Haddingjar proper (probably here the sons of Högni the Red) were all three called Haddingjar and ruled in rotation. Also, in the text the name of Helgi&#x27;s lover actually appears as &quot;Cára&quot;, which should have been normalized as &quot;Kára&quot;. But &quot;Cára&quot; was instead misread and transcribed as &quot;Lára&quot; in Jónsson and Vilhjálmsson&#x27;s &quot;Fornaldarsögur Norðurlanda&quot; and so appears in most later discussion.

====Descendants of Hring====
Raum&#x27;s son Hring was the eponym and ruler of Ringerike (&quot;Ringeríki&quot;) and also ruled Valdres (a valley of modern Oppland). Hring married the daughter of a sea-king named Vifil (&quot;Vifill&quot;) by whom he was the father of Halfdan the Old (&quot;Hálfdan gamli&quot;). See Halfdan the Old to follow this lineage further.

<text>Glued laminated timber, commonly referred to as glulam, is a type of structural engineered wood product constituted by layers of dimensional lumber bonded together with durable, moisture-resistant structural adhesives so that all of the grain runs parallel to the longitudinal axis. In North America, the material providing the laminations is termed &quot;laminating stock&quot; or &quot;lamstock&quot;.

== History ==

The principles of glulam construction are believed to date back to the 1860s, in the assembly room of King Edward VI College, a school in Southampton, England. The first patent however emerged in 1901 when Otto Karl Freidrich Hetzer, a carpenter from Weimar, Germany, patented this method of construction. Approved in Switzerland, Hetzer&#x27;s patent explored creating a straight beam out of several laminations glued together. In 1906 he received a patent in Germany for curved sections of glulam. Other countries in Europe soon began approving patents and by 1922, glulam had been used in 14 countries.

The technology was first brought to the United States by Max Hanisch Sr., who had been associated with the Hetzer firm in 1906 before emigrating to the United States in 1923. With no financial backing, it was not until 1934 that Hanisch was able to first use glulam in the United States. The project, a school and community gym in Peshtigo, Wisconsin, took time to get started, as manufacturers were hard to find, but eventually the Thompson Brothers Boat Manufacturing Company took on the project. The Wisconsin Industrial Commission, however, rejected the arches as they had no previous experience working with glulam. A compromise was reached in which the arches could be used if they were used in conjunction with bolts, lags, metal strapping, and angles to reinforce the structure. Though the reinforcements were unnecessary, ground finally broke in late 1934 featuring four spans of three-hinged arches with clear spans of . The partnership for this project lead to the creation of Unit Structures Inc., a construction firm for glulam owned by both the Hanisch and Thompson families.

In 1936, Unit Structures patented both the forming equipment used to produce glulam arches and the glulam arches themselves. A second project, this time for the Forest Products Laboratory (FPL), gave Unit Structures the opportunity to prove the strength and stiffness of glulam members to architects and engineers. Full-scale load tests conducted by placing of sandbags on the roof exceeded the design specs by 50%. The noted deflections were also in favor of the system. While the results took some time to get published, the test enabled Unit Structures to continue building with glulam. At this time, I-sections featuring plywood webs and glulam flanges became popular in Europe while rectangular sections became the norm in America. The I-sections saved on lumber, which was beneficial to Europeans as they had high lumber costs but were more labor intensive, which was expensive in the States. The glulam system piqued the interest of those on the west coast and many firms began to engage with it.

In 1942, the introduction of a fully water-resistant phenol-resorcinol adhesive enabled glulam to be used in exposed exterior environments without concern of glue line degradation, expanding its applicable market. During the midst of World War II, glulam construction became more widespread as steel was needed for the war effort. In 1952, leading fabricators of engineered and solid wood joined forces to create the American Institute of Timber Construction (AITC) to help standardize the industry and promote its use. The first U.S. manufacturing standard for glulam was published by the Department of Commerce in 1963. Since then, glulam manufacturing has spread within the United States and into Canada and has been used for other structures, such as bridges, as well. It is currently standardized under ANSI Standard A190.1.

==Manufacturing==
The manufacturing of glulam is typically broken down into four steps: drying and grading the lumber, joining the lumber to form longer laminations, gluing the layers, and finishing and fabrication. The lumber used to produce glulam may come to the manufacturers pre-dried. A hand-held or on the line moisture meter is used to check the moisture level. Each piece of lumber going into the manufacturing process should have a moisture content between 8% and 14% in accordance with the adhesive used. Lumber above this threshold is redried.

Knots on the ends of the dried lumber are trimmed. Lumber is then grouped based on the grade. To create lengths of glulam longer than those typically available for sawn lumber, the lumber must be end-jointed. The most common joint for this is a finger joint, in length that is cut on either end with special cutter heads. A structural resin, typically RF curing melamine formaldehyde (MF) or PF resin, is applied to the joint between successive boards and cured under end pressure using a continuous RF curing system. After the resins have cured, the lumber is cut to length and planed on each side to ensure smooth surfaces for gluing.

Once planed, a glue extruder spreads the resin onto the lumber. This resin is most often phenol-resorcinol-formaldehyde, but PF resin or melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF) resin can also be used. For straight beams, the resinated lumber is stacked in a specific lay-up pattern in a clamping bed where a mechanical or hydraulic system presses the layers together. For curved beams, the lumber is instead stacked in a curved form. These beams are cured at room temperature for 5 to 16 hours before the pressure is released. Combining pressure with RF curing can reduce the time needed for curing. 

The wide-side faces faces of the beams are sanded or planed to remove resin that was squeezed out between the boards. The narrow top and bottom faces may also be sanded if necessary to achieve the desired appearance. Corners are often rounded as well. Specifications for appearance may require additional finishing such as filling knot holes with putty, finer sanding, and applying sealers, finishes, or primers.

== Technological developments ==
=== Resin glues ===
When glued laminated timber was introduced as a building material in the early twentieth century, casein glues (which are waterproof but have lower shear strength) were widely used. Joints with casein glues had detachment failures due to inherent stresses in the wood. Cold-curing synthetic resin glues were invented in 1928. &quot;Kaurit&quot; and other urea-formaldehyde resin glues are inexpensive, easy to use, waterproof and enable high adhesive strength. The development of resin glues contributed to the wide use of glued laminated timber construction. Also, there is today another technique for gluing green wood (of high moisture content) to fabricate such laminated products.

=== Finger joints ===
The use of finger joints with glulam allowed for production of glulam beams and columns on large scale. Glulam finger joints provide a large surface area for gluing. Automatic finger-jointing machines cut the pointed joints, connect and glue them together under pressure, allowing for a strong, durable joint, capable of carrying high loads comparable to natural wood with the same cross-section.

=== Computer numerical control ===
Computer numerical control (CNC) allows to cut glued laminated timber into unusual shapes with a high degree of precision. CNC machine tools can utilize up to five axes, which enables undercutting and hollowing-out processes. The cost-effective CNC machines carve the material using mechanical tools, like a router.

== Advantages ==

Advantages to using glulam in construction:

* &quot;Size and shape -&quot; By laminating a number of smaller pieces of lumber into a single large structural member, the dimensions of glulam members are only limited by transport and handling rather than the size of a tree like sawn lumber. This also enables the use of smaller trees harvested from second-growth forests and plantations rather than relying on old-growth forests. Glulam can also be manufactured in a variety of shapes, so it offers architects artistic freedom without sacrificing structural requirements.
* &quot;Versatility -&quot; Because the size and shape of glulam members can be so variable, they are able to be used as both beams and columns.
* &quot;Strength and stiffness -&quot; Glulam has a higher strength to weight ratio compared to both concrete and steel. Glulam also reduces the impact defects in the wood have on the strength of the member making it stronger than sawn lumber as well.  Glulam has also been proven to have a higher resistance to lateral-torsional buckling than steel.
* &quot;Environmentally friendly -&quot; Glulam has much lower embodied energy than reinforced concrete and steel because the laminating process allows the timber to be used for much longer spans, heavier loads, and more complex shapes than reinforced concrete or steel. The embodied energy to produce it is one sixth of that of a comparable strength of steel. Also, as glulam is a wood product, it naturally sequesters carbon, keeping it from being released into the atmosphere. As long as the wood used to manufacture the glulam members comes from a sustainably managed forest, glulam is a renewable resource.
* &quot;Fire safety -&quot; While glulam is inherently flammable because it is made of wood, if it catches on fire a char layer forms that protects the interior of the member and thus maintains the strength of the member for some time.

== Disadvantages ==

* &quot;Material cost -&quot; Glulam may be more costly than concrete at high axial loads, though this depends on location and availability/ abundance of either material. While glulam beams may be cheaper than HEA steel beams in some cases, it is not a significant difference.
* &quot;Moisture -&quot; Glulam, especially when used for bridge projects, is susceptible to changes in moisture which can impact its strength. The bending strength of glulam exposed to a number of wet/dry cycles can decrease dramatically (by 43.5% in one study).
* &quot;Dimensions -&quot; Compared to steel and reinforced concrete, glulam generally requires larger members to support the same load. The cross-sectional area and height of glulam members are significantly greater than those of steel. Compared to concrete, glulam columns will be smaller for small axial loads, but once large axial forces come into play, concrete columns have a smaller cross-sectional area.
* &quot;Biodegradation -&quot; As a wood product, glulam is subject to concern regarding biodegradation. In regions with higher risk, measures to protect the glulam need to be taken.

== Applications ==
=== Sport structures ===
Large stadium roofs are a common application for wide-span glulam beams. Advantages are the light weight of the material and the ability to furnish long lengths and large cross-sections. Prefabrication is invariably employed and the structural engineer needs to specify methods for delivery and erection of the large members at an early stage in the design. 

The PostFinance Arena is an example of a wide-span sports stadium roof using glulam arches reaching up to 85 metres. The structure was built in Bern in 1967, and has subsequently been refurbished and extended. Eastern Kentucky University&#x27;s Alumni Coliseum was built in 1963 with the world&#x27;s largest glued laminated arches, which span .

The roof of the Richmond Olympic Oval, built for speed skating events at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, features one of the world&#x27;s largest clearspan wooden structures. The roof includes 2,400 cubic metres of Douglas fir lamstock lumber in glulam beams. A total of 34 yellow cedar glulam posts support the overhangs where the roof extends beyond the walls.

Anaheim Ice rink in Anaheim, California was built in 1995 by Disney Development Company and architect Frank Gehry using large double-curved yellow pine glulam beams.

=== Bridges ===

Glulam has been used for pedestrian, forest, highway, and railway bridges. 
Pressure-treated glulam timbers or timbers manufactured from naturally durable wood species are well suited for creating bridges and waterfront structures. Wood is naturally resistant to corrosion by salt used for de-icing roadways.

One North American glulam bridge is Keystone Wye in the Black Hills of South Dakota, constructed in 1967. The da Vinci Bridge in Norway, completed in 2001, is almost completely constructed with glulam. The Kingsway Pedestrian Bridge in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, is constructed of cast-in-place concrete for the support piers, structural steel and glulam for the arch, a post tensioned precast concrete walking deck, and stainless steel support rods connecting the arch to the walking deck.

=== Religious buildings ===
Glulam is used for the construction of multi-use facilities such as churches, school buildings, and libraries. The Cathedral of Christ the Light in Oakland, California, is one such example and uses glulam to enhance the ecological and aesthetic effect. It was built as the replacement of the Cathedral of Saint Francis de Sales, which became unusable after the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. The , -shaped building formed the frame with a glued-laminated timber beam and steel-rod skeleton covered with a glass skin. Considering the conventional mode of construction with steel or reinforced concrete moment-frame, this glulam-and-steel combination case is regarded as an advanced way to realize the economy and aesthetic in the construction.

As an alternative to new-felled oak trees, glued laminated timber was proposed as the structural material in the replacement spire of , destroyed by fire in 2019.

=== Public buildings ===
Glulam is used extensively in public facilities due to its ability to span large spaces without the need for intermediate supports. This quality is particularly beneficial in creating open, airy interiors that are both functional and visually striking. The Lokameru Sunsetfalls in Salatiga, Indonesia, is one notable application of glulam is in the construction of wedding chapels. The use of glulam in these structures provides several advantages:

Aesthetic Appeal: Glulam offers a warm, natural look that enhances the romantic and serene atmosphere of a wedding chapel. The exposed wooden beams can be crafted into elegant arches or intricate patterns, adding to the visual interest of the space.

Structural Strength: Glulam&#x27;s high strength-to-weight ratio allows for the creation of large, open spaces free of columns or other supports that could obstruct views. This is especially important in wedding chapels, where an unobstructed view of the ceremony is desirable.

Versatility in Design: Glulam can be shaped into various forms, including curves and angles that traditional solid wood might not easily achieve. This versatility allows architects to design unique and iconic wedding chapels that stand out for their architectural beauty.

Sustainability: Glulam is a sustainable building material, often sourced from sustainably managed forests. Its use in wedding chapels aligns with the growing trend toward environmentally conscious construction practices.

=== Other ===
In 2019, the world&#x27;s tallest structure employing the use of glulam was Mjøstårnet, an 18-story mixed-use building in Brumunddal, Norway. In 2022, the Ascent MKE building in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, surpassed it with 26 stories, measuring over 86 meters tall.

The roof of the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in France is composed of sixteen kilometers of glued laminated timber intersecting to form hexagonal units. With a surface area of 8,000 m2, the irregular geometry of the roof, featuring various curves and counter-curves, resembles a Chinese hat.

==Failures==

In 2005, researchers at Lund University, Sweden, found a number of failures of glulam structures in Scandinavian countries. They concluded that construction faults or design errors were responsible.
In January 2002 the roof of the Siemens velodrome arena in Copenhagen collapsed when a joint between glulam trusses failed at the point of its dowel fastenings.
In February 2003 the roof of a newly built exhibition hall in Jyväskylä, Finland, collapsed. It was found that during construction the specified number of dowels at joints between glulam timbers were missing or had been wrongly placed.

The collapse of the Perkolo bridge in Sjoa, Norway, in 2016 was caused by a design miscalculation of stresses at joints. Following this incident thirteen road bridges of glulam construction were checked, with only minor faults found.

On 15 August 2022 Tretten Bridge in Gudbrandsdalen, Norway, collapsed as two vehicles were crossing. It was made with glulam and steel construction and had been erected in 2012, with a design life of &quot;at least 100 years&quot;. The cause of the failure was not immediately apparent, although during the 2016 inspection , one joint was found to have dowels that were too short.

<doc id="1048680" wikidata="Q2154043" url="?curid=1048680" title="Algebraic normal form">
<text>In Boolean algebra, the algebraic normal form (ANF), ring sum normal form (RSNF or RNF), &quot;Zhegalkin normal form&quot;, or &quot;Reed–Muller expansion&quot; is a way of writing propositional logic formulas in one of three subforms:

* The entire formula is purely true or false:
** formula_1
** formula_2
* One or more variables are combined into a term by AND (formula_3), then one or more terms are combined by XOR (formula_4) together into ANF. Negations are not permitted: formula_5
* The previous subform with a purely true term: formula_6

Formulas written in ANF are also known as Zhegalkin polynomials and Positive Polarity (or Parity) Reed–Muller expressions (PPRM).

== Common uses ==
ANF is a canonical form, which means that two logically equivalent formulas will convert to the same ANF, easily showing whether two formulas are equivalent for automated theorem proving. Unlike other normal forms, it can be represented as a simple list of lists of variable names—conjunctive and disjunctive normal forms also require recording whether each variable is negated or not. Negation normal form is unsuitable for determining equivalence, since on negation normal forms, equivalence does not imply equality: a ∨ ¬a is not reduced to the same thing as 1, even though they are logically equivalent.

Putting a formula into ANF also makes it easy to identify linear functions (used, for example, in linear-feedback shift registers): a linear function is one that is a sum of single literals. Properties of nonlinear-feedback shift registers can also be deduced from certain properties of the feedback function in ANF.

== Performing operations within algebraic normal form ==
There are straightforward ways to perform the standard Boolean operations on ANF inputs in order to get ANF results.

XOR (logical exclusive disjunction) is performed directly:
: ⊕ 
: 1 ⊕ 1 ⊕ x ⊕ x ⊕ y
: y

NOT (logical negation) is XORing 1:
: 
: 1 ⊕ 1 ⊕ x ⊕ y
: x ⊕ y

AND (logical conjunction) is distributed algebraically
: ⊕ 
: (1 ⊕ x ⊕ y) ⊕ (x ⊕ x ⊕ xy)
: 1 ⊕ x ⊕ x ⊕ x ⊕ y ⊕ xy
: 1 ⊕ x ⊕ y ⊕ xy

OR (logical disjunction) uses either 1 ⊕ (1 ⊕ a)(1 ⊕ b) (easier when both operands have purely true terms) or a ⊕ b ⊕ ab (easier otherwise):
: 1 ⊕ (1 ⊕ )(1 ⊕ )
: 1 ⊕ x(x ⊕ y)
: 1 ⊕ x ⊕ xy

== Converting to algebraic normal form ==
Each variable in a formula is already in pure ANF, so one only needs to perform the formula&#x27;s Boolean operations as shown above to get the entire formula into ANF. For example:
: x + (y ⋅ ¬z)
: x + (y(1 ⊕ z))
: x + (y ⊕ yz)
: x ⊕ (y ⊕ yz) ⊕ x(y ⊕ yz)
: x ⊕ y ⊕ xy ⊕ yz ⊕ xyz

== Formal representation ==
ANF is sometimes described in an equivalent way:
:where formula_7 fully describes formula_8.

=== Recursively deriving multiargument Boolean functions ===
There are only four functions with one argument:
* formula_9
* formula_10
* formula_11
* formula_12

To represent a function with multiple arguments one can use the following equality:
: formula_13, where
:* formula_14
:* formula_15

Indeed,
* if formula_16 then formula_17 and so formula_18
* if formula_19 then formula_20 and so formula_21

Since both formula_22 and formula_23 have fewer arguments than formula_8 it follows that using this process recursively we will finish with functions with one variable. For example, let us construct ANF of formula_25 (logical or):
* formula_26
* since formula_27 and formula_28
* it follows that formula_29
* by distribution, we get the final ANF: formula_30

<text>In the Latter Day Saint movement, a general conference is a meeting for all members of the church for conducting general church business and instruction. When Joseph Smith established the Church of Christ in 1830, he was instructed by revelation that the church &quot;are to meet in conference once in three months, or from time to time as said conferences shall direct or appoint; And said conferences are to do whatever church business is necessary to be done at the time.&quot; The church met in conferences regularly until Smith&#x27;s death in 1844.

Since Smith&#x27;s death, the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement have continued the tradition of meeting in regular general conferences.

==Frequency and locations==
The first general conference of the newly formed Church of Christ was held on June 9, 1830, in Fayette, New York, presided over by Joseph Smith. It included a gathering of 27 members of the two-month-old church.

Originally, conferences of the church were held approximately every three months, as suggested by a revelation which outlined the initial organization of the church. Beginning in 1832, the conferences were held less frequently, usually to conduct special church business or to respond to special church needs. At these early conferences, Smith would occasionally receive revelations, which were later canonized as part of the Doctrine and Covenants. During this time, rather than convening a general conference, often the church would hold local conferences that were held in various locations. Once the majority of the church gathered in Nauvoo, Illinois, it settled into a more regular pattern of holding general conferences twice per year, in April and October.

The following are the dates and locations of the general conferences from the establishment of the church until Smith&#x27;s death in 1844:

==After Smith&#x27;s death==
Following Smith&#x27;s death and the resulting succession crisis, general conferences have been practiced in different forms by the various denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement.

===General Conferences of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===

In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), general conferences are a semiannual meeting where general authorities and other church leaders preach sermons and give guidance to church members. Changes to church leadership are also proposed and sustained through the principle of common consent. General conferences are held on the weekends containing the first Sunday in April and the first Sunday in October.

The conferences have been held in Salt Lake City, Utah, since 1848; they were held in the Salt Lake Tabernacle on Temple Square from 1867 to 2000 and in the Conference Center after that. 

Various speakers will generally include all members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, along with other selected church leaders. Almost every general authority of the church is present, though outside the First Presidency and Twelve only a few speak. Non–general authority speakers may include male and female officers of church organizations.

During one session the conducting officer presents all the church&#x27;s general authorities and general officers for a formal sustaining vote of the membership, and it is usually at this time that any changes among the general church leadership are announced.

Frequently, significant announcements are made at general conference, which may include building sites for new temples or the institution of new policies or programs.

The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square along with the organist at the Conference Center generally provide the majority of the music at LDS Church general conferences.

===World Conference in Community of Christ===
World Conference is the name given to the triennial meeting of delegates of Community of Christ. They were originally called General Conferences and were held semiannually, or as need arose.

The World Conference is the highest legislative body in the Community of Christ and is empowered to act for the entire church. Delegates to the conference are elected by Mission Center conferences. Motions are often debated vigorously and the results are sometimes controversial. World Conferences are traditionally held at Community of Christ World Headquarters, with the legislative and main worship services held in the Auditorium.

<text>Die preparation is a step of semiconductor device fabrication during which a wafer is prepared for IC packaging and IC testing. The process of die preparation typically consists of two steps: wafer mounting and wafer dicing.

== Wafer mounting ==
Wafer mounting is a step that is performed during the die preparation of a wafer as part of the process of semiconductor fabrication. During this step, the wafer is mounted on a plastic tape that is attached to a ring. Wafer mounting is performed right before the wafer is cut into separate dies. The adhesive film upon which the wafer is mounted ensures that the individual dies remain firmly in place during &#x27;dicing&#x27;, as the process of cutting the wafer is called.

The picture on the right shows a 300 mm wafer after it was mounted and diced. The blue plastic is the adhesive tape. The wafer is the round disc in the middle. In this case, a large number of dies were already removed.

== Semiconductor-die cutting ==

In the manufacturing of micro-electronic devices, die cutting, dicing or singulation is a process of reducing a wafer containing multiple identical integrated circuits to individual dies each containing one of those circuits.

During this process, a wafer with up to thousands of circuits is cut into rectangular pieces, each called a die. In between those functional parts of the circuits, a thin non-functional spacing is foreseen where a saw can safely cut the wafer without damaging the circuits. This spacing is called the &quot;scribe line&quot; or &quot;saw street&quot;. The width of the scribe is very small, typically around 100 μm. A very thin and accurate saw is therefore needed to cut the wafer into pieces. Usually the dicing is performed with a water-cooled circular saw with diamond-tipped teeth.

== Types of blades ==

The most common make up of blade used is either a metal or resin bond containing abrasive grit of natural or more commonly synthetic diamond, or borazon in various forms. Alternatively, the bond and grit may be applied as a coating to a metal former. See diamond tools.

<text>The SEAL Recon Rifle (nicknamed the &quot;Sniper M4&quot; and &quot;Recce&quot;) is an American designated marksman rifle and assault rifle used by the United States Navy SEALs. Essentially a heavily modified M16 rifle, it is intended to provide SEAL snipers and designated marksmen with a versatile, accurate, lightweight, and relatively compact weapon chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO.

==History==
The concept of an accurized rifle based on the 5.56 NATO cartridge was first observed in 1993 during the Battle of Mogadishu. This led to the development of various options for improving accuracy in the field, including improved ammunition and triggers, a range of optics, free-floating handguards, and rail systems.

Developed in-house by SEAL team armorers, the rifle was centered less around a rigid specification and more around the concept of an accurized rifle that could share the duties and ammunition of fielded M4 carbines, whilst also being able to engage targets beyond the carbines&#x27; range.

When further development was handed over to Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division, the United States Army incorporated their own concepts and funding into the joint program, resulting in the Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle which many SEALs were disappointed with. 

Former SEAL sniper Kyle Defoor recounts:

==Specifications==
Initially, SEAL Recon Rifles were built in-house with the only requirements being a 16&quot; barrel (406mm), and the ability to shoot any 5.56×45mm cartridge in inventory, including the first iterations of the 77-grain (5 gram) Mk262 Mod0 cartridge. Otherwise, the rifle was individualized to the tastes of the user by the armorer or the SEAL themselves.

The stainless-steel barrels were sourced from Lilja Precision Rifle Barrels with a 1:8 (203mm) twist and a unique heavy profile, beginning at 0.980 inches (25mm) in diameter for the first 2.60 inches (66mm) of length, then narrowing down to 0.850 inches (22mm) in diameter, 0.750 inches (19mm) in diameter underneath the front sight block, and 0.725 inches (18mm) in diameter to the muzzle. 

These barrels were mated to flat-top upper receivers featuring an M1913 rail, to which optics and back-up iron sights could be attached. Operators commonly chose to install back-up iron sights manufactured by Knight&#x27;s Armament Company, ARMS Inc, and Troy Industries with the rifles. 

Recon rifles were reportedly fitted with free-float handguards, the most popular being the KAC M4 Match RAS and a longer-length LaRue free-float handguard, either of which provides plentiful rail space to mount accessories. KAC free-floated rails (P/N 20214) were part of the Mk12 Mod 1 package and were in common use during the war on terror. 

Barrels were sometimes fitted with Ops Inc. 12th model suppressors and their accompanying muzzle brakes.

<doc id="1048693" wikidata="Q196295" url="?curid=1048693" title="Active camouflage">
<text>Active camouflage or adaptive camouflage is camouflage that adapts, often rapidly, to the surroundings of an object such as an animal or military vehicle. In theory, active camouflage could provide perfect concealment from visual detection.

Active camouflage is used in several groups of animals, including reptiles on land, and cephalopod molluscs and flatfish in the sea. Animals achieve active camouflage both by color change and (among marine animals such as squid) by counter-illumination, with the use of bioluminescence.

Military counter-illumination camouflage was first investigated during the Second World War for marine use. More recent research has aimed to achieve crypsis by using cameras to sense the visible background, and by controlling Peltier panels or coatings that can vary their appearance.

==In animals==


Active camouflage is used in several groups of animals including cephalopod molluscs, fish, and reptiles. There are two mechanisms of active camouflage in animals: color change and counter-illumination.

===Counter-illumination===
Counter-illumination is camouflage using the production of light to blend in against a lit background. In the sea, light comes down from the surface, so when marine animals are seen from below, they appear darker than the background. Some species of cephalopod, such as the eye-flash squid and the firefly squid, produce light in photophores on their undersides to match the background. Bioluminescence is common among marine animals, so counter-illumination may be widespread, though light has other functions, including attracting prey and signaling.

===Color change===


Color change permits camouflage against different backgrounds. Many cephalopods including octopuses, cuttlefish, and squids, and some terrestrial amphibians and reptiles including chameleons and anoles can rapidly change color and pattern, though the major reasons for this include signaling, not only camouflage. Cephalopod active camouflage has stimulated military research in the United States.

Active camouflage by color change is used by many bottom-living flatfish such as plaice, sole, and flounder that actively copy the patterns and colors of the seafloor below them. For example, the tropical flounder &quot;Bothus ocellatus&quot; can match its pattern to &quot;a wide range of background textures&quot; in 2–8 seconds. Similarly, the coral reef fish, the seaweed blenny can match its coloration to its surroundings.

==In research==

Active camouflage provides concealment by making an object not merely generally similar to its surroundings, but effectively invisible with &quot;illusory transparency&quot; through accurate mimicry, and by changing the appearance of the object as changes occur in its background.

===Early research===


Military interest in active camouflage has its origins in Second World War studies of counter-illumination. The first of these was the so-called diffused lighting camouflage tested on Canadian Navy corvettes including . This was followed in the United States Army Air Forces with the airborne Yehudi lights project, and trials in ships of the Royal Navy and the US Navy. The Yehudi lights project placed low-intensity blue lights on aircraft. As skies are bright, an unilluminated aircraft (of any color) might be rendered visible. By emitting a small, measured amount of blue light, the aircraft&#x27;s average brightness better matches that of the sky, and the aircraft is able to fly closer to its target before being detected.
Bell Textron filed for a patent on 1/28/2021, # 17/161075 Active Aircraft Visual Cloaking System, that proposes using electroluminescent paint along with an active camera system to project and control a luminescent paint scheme to blend the aircraft exterior structure with the sky.

===Possible technologies===

Active camouflage may now develop using organic light-emitting diodes and other technologies which allow for images to be projected onto irregularly shaped surfaces. Using visual data from a camera, an object could perhaps be camouflaged well enough to avoid detection by the human eye and optical sensors when stationary. Camouflage is weakened by motion, but active camouflage could still make moving targets more difficult to see. However, active camouflage works best in one direction at a time, requiring knowledge of the relative positions of the observer and the concealed object.

In 2003 researchers at the University of Tokyo under Susumu Tachi created a prototype active camouflage system using material impregnated with retroreflective glass beads. The viewer stands in front of the cloth viewing the cloth through a transparent glass plate. A video camera behind the cloth captures the background behind the cloth. A video projector projects this image on to the glass plate which is angled so that it acts as a partial mirror reflecting a small portion of the projected light onto the cloth. The retroreflectors in the cloth reflect the image back towards the glass plate which being only weakly reflecting allows most of the retroreflected light to pass through to be seen by the viewer. The system only works when seen from a certain angle.

Phased-array optics would implement active camouflage, not by producing a two-dimensional image of background scenery on an object, but by computational holography to produce a three-dimensional hologram of background scenery on an object to be concealed. Unlike a two-dimensional image, the holographic image would appear to be the actual scenery behind the object independent of viewer distance or view angle.

===Military prototypes===
In 2010, the Israeli company Eltics created an early prototype of a system of tiles for infrared camouflage of vehicles. In 2011, BAE Systems announced its &quot;Adaptiv&quot; infrared camouflage technology. Adaptiv uses about 1000 hexagonal Peltier panels to cover the sides of a tank. The panels are rapidly heated and cooled to match either the temperature of the vehicle&#x27;s surroundings, or one of the objects in the thermal cloaking system&#x27;s &quot;library&quot; such as a truck, car or large rock.

== In fiction ==

Active camouflage technology, both visual and otherwise, is a commonly used plot device in science fiction stories. The &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise incorporated the concept (&quot;cloaking device&quot;), and &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; depicts humans using &quot;bio-dampeners&quot; to infiltrate a Borg Cube without the antagonists realizing they are there. The eponymous antagonists in the &quot;Predator&quot; films also use active camouflage. In many video games, such as the &quot;Halo&quot; series, &quot;Deus Ex: Human Revolution&quot;, and the &quot;Crysis&quot; series, players can obtain and use cloaking devices. In the 2002 James Bond film &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, Bond&#x27;s Aston Martin V12 Vanquish is fitted with an active camouflage system.

<doc id="1048695" wikidata="Q568123" url="?curid=1048695" title="Dracula (1979 film)">
<text>Dracula is a 1979 gothic horror film directed by John Badham. The film starred Frank Langella in the title role as well as Laurence Olivier, Donald Pleasence and Kate Nelligan.

The film was based on Bram Stoker&#x27;s 1897 novel &quot;Dracula&quot; and its 1924 stage adaptation, though much of Stoker&#x27;s original plot was revised to make the film more romantic, as advertised by the tagline &quot;A Love Story&quot;. The film received mostly positive reviews and was a moderate box office success. It won the 1979 Saturn Award for Best Horror Film.

== Plot ==
In Whitby, Yorkshire in 1913, Count Dracula arrives from Transylvania via the ship &quot;Demeter&quot; one stormy night. Mina Van Helsing, who is visiting her friend Lucy Seward, discovers Dracula&#x27;s body after his ship has run aground and rescues him. The Count visits Mina and her friends at the household of Lucy&#x27;s father, Dr. Jack Seward, whose clifftop mansion also serves as the local asylum. At dinner, he proves to be a charming guest and leaves a strong impression on the hosts, especially Lucy. Less charmed by this handsome count is Jonathan Harker, Lucy&#x27;s fiancé.

Later that night, while Lucy and Jonathan are having a secret rendezvous, Dracula reveals his true nature as he descends upon Mina to drink her blood. The following morning, Lucy finds Mina awake in bed, struggling for breath. Powerless, she watches her friend die, only to find wounds on her throat. Lucy blames herself for Mina&#x27;s death, as she had left her alone.

At a loss for the cause of death, Dr. Seward calls in Mina&#x27;s father, Professor Abraham Van Helsing, who suspects what might have killed his daughter: a vampire. He begins to worry about what fate his seemingly dead daughter may now have. Seward and Van Helsing investigate their suspicions and discover a roughly clawed opening within Mina&#x27;s coffin, leading them to the local mines. It is there that they encounter the ghastly form of an undead Mina and it is up to a distraught Van Helsing to destroy what remains of his daughter.

Lucy has in the meantime been summoned to Carfax Abbey, Dracula&#x27;s new home. She reveals herself to be in love with this foreign prince and openly offers herself to him as his bride. After a surreal &quot;wedding night&quot; sequence, Lucy, like Mina before her, is now infected by Dracula&#x27;s blood. The two doctors manage to give Lucy a blood transfusion to slow her descent into vampirism, but she remains under Dracula&#x27;s spell.

Now aided by Jonathan, the doctors realize that the only way to save Lucy is by destroying Dracula. They manage to locate his coffin within the grounds of Carfax Abbey, but the vampire is waiting for them. Despite it being daylight, Dracula is still a very powerful adversary. Dracula escapes their attempts to kill him, bursts into the asylum to free the captive Lucy and also scolds his slave, Milo Renfield, for warning the others about him. Renfield apologizes and pleads for his life, but Dracula kills him by breaking his neck. Dracula makes preparations to return to Transylvania with Lucy.

Harker and Van Helsing board the ship carrying Dracula and Lucy as cargo bound for Transylvania. Below decks, Harker and Van Helsing find Dracula and Lucy sleeping in a coffin. Van Helsing attempts to stake Dracula, but Lucy protests, waking Dracula. In the struggle, Van Helsing is fatally wounded by Dracula as he is impaled with the stake intended for the vampire. Dracula now concentrates his attention on Harker. Van Helsing uses his remaining strength to throw a hook attached to a rope, tied to the ship&#x27;s rigging, into Dracula&#x27;s back. Harker seizes his chance and hoists the count up through the cargo hold to the top of the ship&#x27;s rigging, where he dies a painful death when the rays of the sun burn his body.

Van Helsing dies from his wounds. Lucy is now apparently herself again. Lucy smiles enigmatically as she notices Dracula&#x27;s cape blow away into the horizon.

== Production ==

Like Universal&#x27;s earlier 1931 version starring Bela Lugosi, the screenplay for this adaptation of Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel &quot;Dracula&quot; is based on the stage adaptation by Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston, which ran on Broadway and also starred Langella in a Tony Award-nominated performance. Set in the Edwardian period, and strikingly designed by Edward Gorey, the play ran for over 900 performances between October 1977 and January 1980. Langella also appeared in the play for a limited run in the West End. The play is also known for switching the names of the characters of Mina Harker and Lucy Westenra. When Badham was asked why he had also switched their names in his film, he said that he could not quite remember but that maybe he and Richter &quot;felt like Mina was a dopey name and that Lucy was kind of a nice name&quot;.

The film was shot on location in England, at Shepperton Studios and Black Park, Buckinghamshire. Locations in Cornwall doubled for the majority of the exterior Whitby scenes; Tintagel (for Seward&#x27;s Asylum), and St Michael&#x27;s Mount (for Carfax Abbey). The Castle Dracula was a glass matte painted by Albert Whitlock.

Gilbert Taylor was the cinematographer, and the original music score was contributed by John Williams.

According to Frank Langella, Count Dracula was &quot;a dominant, aggressive force. He must have Miss Lucy or he dies. He wants what he wants and he doesn&#x27;t analyze it. Dracula as a character is very erotic. ... A woman can be totally passive with Dracula: &#x27;he made me drink, I couldn&#x27;t help it.&#x27; ... Dracula seems to represent a kind of doorway to sexual abandonment not possible with a mere mortal. Besides, he&#x27;s offering immortality. Actually, I can&#x27;t think of a woman who wouldn&#x27;t like to be taken if it&#x27;s with love. If you take a woman by force and at the same time gently, you can&#x27;t fail.&quot;

Langella wanted to explore sides of the character which weren&#x27;t shown before: &quot;I decided he was a highly vulnerable and erotic man, not cool and detached and with no sense of humour or humanity. I didn&#x27;t want him to appear stilted, stentorian or authoritarian as he&#x27;s often presented. I wanted to show a man who, while evil, was lonely and could fall in love&quot;.

Langella held this view many years after the release of the movie. In his 2017 interview during SITGES film festival he said that he &quot;saw a gentleman in [Dracula], while the bad guys were the ones who wanted to destroy him, and we see that today in many instances: ignorance leads to the desire to destroy different people, there is the suffering of homosexuals, or women.&quot; Langella remembers that the beginning of shooting was very disorganized. The cinematographer was changed and they had continual changes of plans. However, the actor said that the process &quot;turned out well&quot; in the end.

However, Langella&#x27;s most vivid memories were his efforts to create a different Dracula. &quot;I did not want to look like Bela Lugosi, or Christopher Lee&quot;, remembers Langella. He thus read the novel and found the character to be &quot;gothic, elegant, lonely, without anyone who understood his problem, which consisted of the need for blood to survive.&quot; Langella also understood that the attraction that the character produced among women was key to realize his enormous &quot;power of seduction&quot;, which Langella did not hesitate to use.

Badham hired composer John Williams to write the musical score for the film. Williams was originally set to score Ronald Neame&#x27;s sci-fi disaster &quot;Meteor&quot;, but numerous production delays forced Williams to step back from the project, freeing him to work with Badham. Williams recorded the score with the renowned London Symphony Orchestra in the spring of 1979. The original soundtrack album was released by MCA Records, followed by a Deluxe Edition encompassing the complete score by Varèse Sarabande in 2018.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
In 1979, at least three Dracula films were released around the world: this film, West German director Werner Herzog&#x27;s retelling as &quot;Nosferatu the Vampyre&quot;, and the comedy &quot;Love at First Bite&quot;. The success of the jokey &quot;Love at First Bite&quot;, starring George Hamilton, may have been relevant to the muted response this version experienced. The film opened at number one at the US box office with an opening weekend gross of $3,141,281 nationally from 455 theaters but performed modestly at the box office, grossing $20,158,970 domestically, and was seen as something of a disappointment by the studio.

=== Critical response ===
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave the film 3½ stars out of 4, writing: &quot;What an elegantly seen Dracula this is, all shadows and blood and vapors and Frank Langella stalking through with the grace of a cat. The film is a triumph of performance, art direction and mood over materials that can lend themselves so easily to self-satire...This &quot;Dracula&quot; restores the character to the purity of its first film appearances...&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, stated: &quot;In making this latest trip to the screen in living color, &quot;Dracula&quot; has lost some blood. The movie version ... is by no means lacking in stylishness; if anything, it&#x27;s got style to spare. But so many of its sequences are at fever pitch, and the mood varies so drastically from episode to episode, that the pace becomes pointless, even taxing, after a while.&quot; Film historian Leonard Maltin gave the film 1.5 out of a possible 4 stars, describing it as &quot;Murky...with Langella&#x27;s acclaimed Broadway interpretation sabotaged by trendy horror gimmicks and ill-conceived changes to Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
== Home video ==
The movie made it onto &quot;Variety&quot;″s All-Time Horror Rentals in 1993, but it fell into relative cinematic obscurity for several years, partly due to it having a very limited video release outside of the US.

=== Video recolouring ===
The 1979 theatrical version looks noticeably different from later prints. When the film was reissued for a widescreen laserdisc release in 1991, the director chose to alter the colour timing, desaturating the look of the film.

John Badham had intended to shoot the film in black and white (to mirror the monochrome 1931 film and the stark feel of the Gorey stage production), but Universal Studios executives objected. Cinematographer Gilbert Taylor was prompted to shoot the movie in warm, &quot;golden&quot; colours, to show off the distinctive production design. The original version has not been widely screened since the 1980s. Other than an occasional broadcast, such as on TCM in a pan and scan format, the movie has effectively been out of print.

In 2018, a 2.35:1 aspect ratio fan edit restored the theatrical colour timing based on the original laserdisc and VHS releases, as well as set photography and reference materials prompting an official release the following year.

A July 2019 Shout! Factory announcement revealed that the movie had been licensed to release the original 1979 theatrical colour version of &quot;Dracula&quot; on Blu-ray; it was released in November 2019. This is the first time the original 1979 &quot;Dracula&quot; has been made commercially available since first being released on VHS and laserdisc in 1982. It also includes the previously available desaturated version on another disc.

In November 2020, Black Hill Pictures and KOCH Media released a newly restored &quot;cinema edition&quot; featuring the 1979 colour version of &quot;Dracula&quot; on Blu-ray (Region B/2). This is the second time the original 1979 version has been made commercially available making use of higher quality source materials after the release of Shout! Factory&#x27;s more aged uprint.

<text>The , sometimes romanized as &#x27; or &#x27;, is a Japanese aerophone, an end-blown bamboo flute, crafted from root sections of bamboo. The bamboo root is cleaned and sanded, resulting in a surface patterned with many small, circular knots where the roots formerly joined the stalk. The same part of the bamboo plant is also used to produce the but, unlike the , the &#x27;s inside (bore) and outside surfaces are left unlacquered, and an inlay is not used in the mouthpiece.

The instrument is capable of a range of at least two octaves, and more if the instrument is well-crafted and in the hands of an experienced player; they can be fashioned to any length, suitable bamboo permitting, with longer instruments having their frequency range shifted proportionally lower. are typically longer than other variations of the , and almost always thicker and heavier.

The angle of the , or blowing edge, of a is closer to perpendicular to the bore axis than that of a modern , but this is mostly a choice of the maker depending upon the size of the bamboo. Older and also share this trait, though unlike they usually have an inlaid blowing edge. This property, along with the unlacquered bore, results in a rough and breathy timbre.

Playing traditional is generally only attempted by highly skilled musicians, since the blowing and fingering techniques required for have to be altered considerably. Since are not generally tuned to a standard musical scale, they do not commonly accompany other instruments.

==Distinctions between and traditional ==

The term was popularized by Watzumi Doso. Traditional were quite similar, with three primary differences. First, modern performers such as Doso and Okuda often prefer exceptionally long , while rarely exceeded 2.1 . Second, had an inlaid mouthpiece, which protects the blowing edge from taking on excess moisture and rotting out. Thirdly, though is not used, the inside is painted with , a natural lacquer made from the sap of the urushi tree, used in Japan from antiquity. Like the mouthpiece inlay, this protects the bore from taking on excess moisture and contributes to the flute&#x27;s longevity.

Lacking and a mouthpiece inlay, gradually take on moisture as they are played, making the tone less stable. Though were not tuned to a precise scale either, they could generally be played together. As their hole positions were either calculated or copied from another , a particular piece could be played roughly the same way on any . take even more freedom; some of Watazumi Doso&#x27;s instruments were literally a piece of bamboo cut down with some holes seemingly randomly bored into it.

Distinguishing from in general can be difficult, as there are many types of . In addition to , there are also modern , such as those made by John Kaizan Neptune, which are tuned to be played with modern (Western) musical instruments. Again, since the abolition of the Fuke sect in 1871, modern have been made in two halves in order to tune them more precisely, but used for Zen practice have been primarily since the beginning. The term encompasses all of these, including , and should not be understood as referring only to the modern, more musical iteration of the instrument.

<doc id="1048702" wikidata="Q3077165" url="?curid=1048702" title="Forest Park (Portland, Oregon)">
<text>Forest Park is a public municipal park in the Tualatin Mountains west of downtown Portland, Oregon, United States. Stretching for more than on hillsides overlooking the Willamette River, it is one of the country&#x27;s largest urban forest reserves. The park, a major component of a regional system of parks and trails, covers more than of mostly second-growth forest with a few patches of old growth. More than of recreational trails, including the Wildwood Trail segment of the city&#x27;s 40-Mile Loop system, crisscross the park.

As early as the 1860s, civic leaders sought to create a natural preserve in the woods near Portland. Their efforts led to the creation of a municipal park commission that in 1903 hired the Olmsted Brothers landscape architectural firm to develop . Acquiring land through donations, transfers from Multnomah County, and delinquent tax foreclosures, the city eventually acted on a proposal by the City Club of Portland and combined parcels totaling about to create the reserve. Formally dedicated in 1948, it ranks 19th in size among parks within U.S. cities, according to the Trust for Public Land.

More than 112 bird species and 62 mammal species frequent the park and its wide variety of trees and shade-loving plants. About of rain falls on the forest each year. Many small tributaries of the Willamette River flow northeast through the woods to pipes or culverts under U.S. Route 30 at the edge of the park. One of them, Balch Creek, has a resident trout population, and another, Miller Creek, supports sea-run species, including salmon.

Threats to the park include overuse, urban traffic, encroaching development, invasive flora, and lack of maintenance money. Occasional serious crimes and more frequent minor crimes occur in the park.

==Geology and geography==
Solidified lava from Grande Ronde members of the Columbia River Basalt Group underlie Forest Park. About 16 million years ago during the Middle Miocene, the Columbia River ran through a lowland south of its modern channel. Eruptions from linear vents in eastern Oregon and Washington flowed down this channel through what later became the Willamette Valley. These flows, some of which reached the Pacific Ocean, recurred at intervals between 16.5 and 15.6 million years ago and covered almost . About eight separate Grande Ronde Basalt flows have been mapped in the Tualatin Mountains (West Hills), where they underlie the steepest slopes of Forest Park and form the columned rocks visible along Balch Creek Canyon and Northwest Cornell Road. The West Hills were later covered by wind-deposited silts that become unstable when saturated with water. Stream bank instability and siltation are common, and landslides deter urban development at higher elevations.

Roughly long, the park is less than wide near downtown Portland and about wide at its northwestern end. It extends along the West Hills from West Burnside Street near downtown Portland to where the Willamette River divides to flow around Sauvie Island. Covering most of the east face of the ridge above the Willamette River, it is bounded by West Burnside Street on the south, Northwest Skyline Boulevard on the west, Northwest Newberry Road on the north, and Northwest St. Helens Road (U.S. Route 30) on the east. Elevations above sea level vary from near U.S. Route 30 at the base of the ridge to about near the crest of the ridge along Northwest Skyline Boulevard.

In 2008 Forest Park ranked 19th in size among the largest city parks in the United States, according to The Trust for Public Land. The trust&#x27;s list included state parks, national parks, county parks, regional parks, and national wildlife refuges, as well as municipally owned parks located within cities. Chugach State Park in Anchorage, Alaska, was in first place with .

Portland author Marcy Houle says that the park &quot;captures the essence of what is natural and wild and beautiful about the Northwest... From this forest sanctuary, panoramic views of the city of Portland, the Willamette and Columbia rivers, and five major peaks of the Cascade Range ... can be seen through the tall fir trees. From its inception ..., Forest Park has been a refuge for both people and wildlife, and an integral part of the environment of Portland.&quot;

==Ecology==

===Vegetation===
Forest Park lies in the Coast Range ecoregion designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In its natural state, the forest consists mainly of three tree species: Douglas-fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar. It also includes smaller numbers of grand fir, black cottonwood, red alder, bigleaf maple, madrone, and western yew. Much of the forest that existed there before 1850 was gone by 1940. The stage of regrowth in the forest depends on when it was last logged or burned.

In the mid-1990s, about 1% of the total vegetation in the park consisted of grasses, bracken, thistle, and fireweed in sections of the forest cleared two to five years earlier. Another 2% had reached the shrub stage, between three and thirty years old, with small trees dominated by such plants as thimbleberry, salmonberry, and blackberry. Forest areas 10 to 30 years old that contained tall alder and maple trees and smaller conifers accounted for about 20% of the park.

Larger areas were occupied by forests in which conifers had grown taller than the alders and maples. About 50% of Forest Park consists of these areas, which are between 30 and 80 years old and in which Douglas-firs have begun to dominate. Another 25% of the park contains forests dominated by middle-aged conifers, 80 to 250 years old. In these areas, red alders, which live for about 100 years, have begun to die, and the Douglas-firs, which can live for 750 years, attain heights up to about . Under the big trees are shade-tolerant trees such as western red cedar, western hemlock, and grand fir and smaller plants such as Oregon-grape, vine maple, and salal.

The last forest stage, old growth, is reached after 250 years and includes many snags, downed and dead trees, and fallen logs. Timber-cutting and fires reduced old growth in Forest Park to &quot;almost nothing&quot; by 1940, and most of the forest has not yet attained this stage. Patches exist near Macleay Park and further west near Germantown Road and Newton Road. The largest tree in Forest Park is a Douglas-fir near the Stone House, the remains of a former public restroom near Balch Creek. It is high, and the trunk is in circumference.

Among the prominent wildflowers are Hooker&#x27;s fairy bells, vanilla leaf, evergreen violet, and trillium. Invasive species include English ivy, European holly, clematis, morning glory, and Himalayan blackberry. Citizen groups such as the No Ivy League. and The Forest Park Conservancy engage in projects to remove ivy, maintain trails, and plant native species.

===Wildlife===
Wildlife in Forest Park is strongly affected by contiguous tracts of nearby habitat that make the park accessible to birds and animals from the Tualatin River valley, the Oregon Coast Range, the Willamette River, Sauvie Island, the Columbia River, and the Vancouver, Washington, lowlands. Sixty-two mammal species, including the northern flying squirrel, black-tailed deer, creeping vole, bobcat, coyote, Mazama pocket gopher, little brown bat, Roosevelt elk, and Pacific jumping mouse frequent Forest Park. Blue grouse, great horned owl, hairy woodpecker, Bewick&#x27;s wren, orange-crowned warbler, osprey, northern pygmy-owl, and hermit thrush are among the more than 112 species of birds that have been observed in the park. In Balch Creek Canyon adjacent to Forest Park, the Audubon Society of Portland maintains a wildlife sanctuary with more than of trails, a wildlife care center, and avian exhibits. Amphibian species frequenting the Audubon Society pond include rough-skinned newts, Pacific tree frogs, and salamanders.

Pressure from habitat loss, pollution, hunting, and urban development has reduced or eliminated the presence of wolves, bears, and wild cats and has led to increased numbers of weasels, raccoons, and other small predators. Invasive plant species such as English ivy have made the habitat simpler and less supportive of native insects and the salamanders and other amphibians that feed on them. Roads in the area severely hamper the movement of large animals. Multnomah County has designated Northwest Cornell Road and Northwest Germantown Road as &quot;rural collector&quot; streets, carrying traffic of less than 3,000 vehicles per day but more than streets designated as &quot;local roads&quot;. Dogs allowed to run (illegally) off-leash in the park pose threats to birds, fish, and other wildlife.

===Creeks===
About of rain falls on Forest Park each year. Many small creeks, only a few of which are named, flow northeast through the park from the ridge at the top of the West Hills to the base of the hills near U.S. Route 30. The five named streams from east to west are: Balch Creek, Rocking Chair Creek, Saltzman Creek, Doane Creek, and Miller Creek. Rocking Chair Creek is a tributary of Saltzman Creek. After leaving the park, the streams pass through culverts and other conduits before reaching the Willamette River. These conduits block fish migration to and from the Willamette River except on Miller Creek, where the conduits are short and have been modified to assist the fish.

Near the east end of the park, the free-flowing reaches of Balch Creek support a population of resident cutthroat trout. Near the west end, furthest from the city center, Miller Creek retains much of its historic nature and supports a greater diversity of aquatic organisms than other Forest Park streams. Biological field surveys of Miller Creek in 1990 noted sea-run cutthroat trout, coho salmon, and short-head cottid, as well as abundant macroinvertebrate species including stoneflies, mayflies, caddisflies, water striders, and crayfish.

==History==

Before settlers arrived, the land that became known as Forest Park was covered by a Douglas-fir forest. By 1851, its acreage had been divided into donation land claims filed by settlers with plans to clear the forest and build upon the property. After logging, the steep slopes and unstable silt loosened by heavy rains caused landslides that defeated construction plans, and claims were defaulted or donated to the city.

Civic leaders beginning with the Reverend Thomas Lamb Eliot, a minister who moved to Portland in 1867, sought to create a natural preserve in the woods that eventually became Forest Park. By 1899, Eliot&#x27;s efforts led to the formation of the Municipal Park Commission of Portland, which in 1903 hired the highly regarded landscape architecture firm, the Olmsted Brothers of Brookline, Massachusetts, to study the city&#x27;s park system and recommend a plan. John Charles Olmsted, the stepson of Frederick Law Olmsted, spent May 1903 in Portland. , received in December, emphasized creation of a system of parks and linking parkways that would take advantage of natural scenery. It proposed a formal square for Union Station, squares along the downtown waterfront, and parks in places later known as Forest Park, Sellwood Park, Mount Tabor Park, Rocky Butte, and Ross Island, as well as Terwilliger Parkway, the 40-Mile Loop, and other connecting parkways. Proposed parks for Swan Island, in the Willamette River, and other places in Portland did not develop. Others like Forest Park came into being only many years later.

The city acquired land for Forest Park bit by bit over several decades. In 1897, Donald Macleay, a Portland merchant and real-estate developer, deeded a tract of land along Balch Creek to the city to provide an outdoor space for patients from nearby hospitals. In the 1890s, Frederick Van Voorhies Holman, a Portland lawyer and a president of the Oregon Historical Society, proposed a gift of of nearby land that was added to the city&#x27;s holdings in 1939 when his siblings, George F. and Mary Holman, completed the donation. Clark and Wilson Timber Company donated in 1927 to create a Western Oregon timber park near Northwest Germantown Road. Nine years later, the estate of Aaron Meier, one of the founders of the Meier &amp; Frank chain of department stores, donated land for Linnton Park near Portland&#x27;s Linnton neighborhood along Highway 30. These smaller parks became part of the larger park when it was finally created. Some of them, such as Macleay Park, are still referred to by their original names even though they are part of Forest Park.

 Other parcels were acquired through government action. In 1928, the City Council&#x27;s Delinquent Tax Committee transferred land to the Parks Bureau for a wildflower garden along Balch Creek. Multnomah County in that year gave the bureau perpetual use of about of land north of Washington Park. Encouraged by the City Club of Portland, which conducted a park feasibility study in 1945, civic leaders supported the Forest Park project. In 1948, Multnomah County transferred to the city another acquired through delinquent tax foreclosures. On September 23, 1948, the city formally dedicated of land as Forest Park, which as of 2009 covered more than . It is one of the largest urban forest reserves in the U.S., though its exact ranking has been questioned. The city&#x27;s Parks and Recreation Department claims it is the &quot;largest forested natural area within city limits in the United States&quot;. However, an article in the &quot;Portland Tribune&quot; said Forest Park ranked no higher than third among U.S. urban forests in 2006.

In 1991, Metro, the regional governmental agency for the Oregon portion of the Portland metropolitan area, began budgeting for what became its Natural Areas Program aimed at protecting these areas in Multnomah, Washington, and Clackamas counties. By 1995, the program had targeted next to or within Forest Park for acquisition. A 2006 bond measure allowed for the purchase of more land to expand the park, to protect its creeks&#x27; headwaters and those of nearby streams in Washington County, and to link Forest Park to other public lands to the northwest. In addition to purchases to directly expand the park, since 1990 the Forest Park Conservancy has acquired 14 conservation easements covering to create a buffer of undeveloped land surrounding the park.

===Crime and other human impacts===

Multiple crimes have occurred in Forest Park, including two murders. In 2001, Todd Alan Reed, a man who preyed on heroin addicts and prostitutes, pleaded guilty to the 1999 murders of three women whose bodies were found in Forest Park near Northwest Saltzman Road, though forensic analysis showed the murders took place elsewhere and the bodies were brought to Forest Park. In 2003, jurors convicted another man of the 1996 murder of his ex-girlfriend on a Forest Park trail. Less serious crimes have included assault (rarely), car break-ins and petty theft (frequently at trail heads), rare arsons, rare indecent exposure, and marijuana cultivation. Multnomah County Sheriff&#x27;s deputies in 2007 seized 114 mature marijuana plants found growing in the park on a hillside near Portland&#x27;s Linnton neighborhood. Deputies had seized another small grow operation in the park in 2005. More common has been illegal camping by homeless transients and others. An illegal bicycling trail, about long, was discovered in a remote part of the park in February 2010. In 2014, hikers found a booby trap meant to fire a shotgun shell across a path leading to the park. Portland police removed the device.

In 2004, authorities found a 53-year-old man and his 12-year-old daughter living in the park in a tarp-covered structure stocked with encyclopedias for homeschooling. They told police they had been living in the park for four years. &quot;My Abandonment&quot;, a novel by Peter Rock, tells a story built around the incident. The novel was adapted into a film, &quot;Leave No Trace&quot; (2018). Forest scenes were shot in Eagle Fern Park, near Estacada in Clackamas County.

In 1951, a drought-related blaze started by a campfire burned near the western end of the park. In 2005, a reporter for &quot;The Oregonian&quot; newspaper interviewed biologists, conservationists, Parks and Recreation officials, and others about the health of Forest Park and its future prospects. Collectively they identified threats to the park: urban development that restricts the movement of wild animals and birds; overuse; invasive plants; loose dogs; fire risk; increasing rates of tree death; lack of rule enforcement, and lack of money. In 2010, the city hired a full-time ranger assigned to Forest Park. In 2021 and 2022, the city took additional steps to handle wildfire risk in the park, with Portland Fire &amp; Rescue requesting additional budget to plan for mitigation, and the city designating the park plus surrounding areas a high-risk hazard zone where homeless encampments are banned during wildfire season.

==Recreational access==
Forest Park is a major component of a regional network of parks, trails, and natural areas managed by Metro. At the southeastern end of the park, Wildwood Trail, the centerpiece of the Forest Park trail system, passes through Macleay Park. This part of the larger park, which includes the Forest Park field headquarters, is heavily used by pedestrians entering Balch Creek Canyon from nearby city streets. Further southeast, Wildwood Trail, while still in Forest Park, passes Pittock Mansion and its panoramic views of Portland and five volcanic peaks: Mounts Rainier, Adams, St. Helens, Hood, and Jefferson. Beyond the mansion, the trail connects to adjoining Washington Park and attractions such as the Oregon Zoo via the Barbara Walker Crossing, a pedestrian bridge over Burnside Street. From here and from more remote Forest Park trailheads near the St. Johns Bridge, other components of the 40-Mile Loop system of trails encircle the city. They follow the Willamette and Columbia rivers, the Columbia Slough and the Springwater Corridor along Johnson Creek and extend to the eastern suburbs of Fairview, Gresham and Boring. This trail network links more than 30 separate parks that offer diverse recreational opportunities, such as horse-back riding, in-line skating, canoeing, and viewing of wetland wildlife, in addition to hiking and biking. It connects to other trail systems such as Discovery Trail in Clark County, Washington, and the Terwilliger Trail running through Tryon Creek State Natural Area to Lake Oswego.

As of 2015, this network of parks and trails is still expanding. Metro, the regional government, plans to link the 40-Mile Loop to trails along the Willamette River to Wilsonville, south of Lake Oswego. The regional government has also proposed connecting Wildwood Trail to the partly completed Westside Trail running north–south through Washington County to the Tualatin River. Another planned trail would extend the Springwater Corridor along a proposed Cazadero Trail to Barton on the Clackamas River. Longer-term goals include trail links to the Sandy River Gorge Trail east of Gresham and the Pacific Crest Trail, which runs from Mexico to Canada and follows the Cascade Range through Oregon.

===Wildwood Trail===
 More than of trails and firelanes cut through the park. The longest trail in the park is the Wildwood Trail, of which about is in Forest Park and about in Washington Park. It is also the longest section of the 40-Mile Loop, a trail network of roughly reaching many parts of the Portland metropolitan area. The trail runs southeast to northwest from trail marker 0 in Washington Park to Northwest Newberry Road, just beyond trail marker 30 on the ridge above the southeastern end of Sauvie Island. The straight-line distance from beginning to end is about , but because the trail includes many and hairpin turns, it is long. In 2019, the City of Portland constructed Barbara Walker Crossing to allow Wildwood Trail users to safely pass over West Burnside Street.

Wildwood Trail begins in Washington Park near the Oregon Zoo, a light rail stop, the Oregon Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the World Forestry Center and the Hoyt Arboretum. Blue diamonds placed about above the ground appear on trees along the trail every . The diamonds and the mileage markers above them are visible to hikers traveling in either direction on the path. In its first , the trail passes near the Portland Japanese Garden, Pittock Mansion, the Audubon Society of Portland wildlife sanctuary, and the Stone House in Balch Creek Canyon. From this point west, Wildwood Trail runs through forest generally uninterrupted by buildings but crisscrossed by shorter trails, small streams, roads, and firelanes.

===Other paths, streets, easements===
Many shorter Forest Park trails, roads, and firelanes intersect the Wildwood Trail. Most of the trails are open only to hikers and runners, but several roads and firelanes are open to bicycles or horses or both. Leif Erikson Drive, a road closed to motorized traffic, runs at lower elevation than and roughly parallel to the Wildwood Trail for about from the end of Northwest Thurman Street to Northwest Germantown Road. Originally called Hillside Drive, it was renamed in 1933 at the request of the Sons of Norway, a fraternal organization. Easements for an oil line, a gas line, and electric transmission lines for the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) cross the park. Paved roads surround the park, which is crossed or entered by other roads including Northwest Pittock Drive, Northwest Cornell Road, Northwest 53rd Drive, Northwest Saltzman Road, Northwest Springville Road, Northwest Germantown Road, Northwest Newton Road, and BPA Road.

<text>KXUA (88.3 FM) is a student-run college radio station broadcasting an eclectic radio format. Licensed to Fayetteville, Arkansas, it serves the university campus and surrounding community. The university also owns the more powerful 91.3 KUAF, which broadcasts news, information and classical music as an NPR member station.

== History ==
From 1973 to 1986, the University of Arkansas had a student radio station known as KUAF, broadcasting at 91.3FM. However, in 1986, KUAF became a network affiliate of National Public Radio, gaining a wide following but at a loss of student input. Three years later, a group of students decided to form a new student radio station, named KRFA, which would be based on the college radio format. Their callsign was a reference to Radio Free Europe, the acronym meaning Radio Free Arkansas. The &quot;broadcasting&quot; was done via cable and carrier current, rather than FM or AM, which was available to on-campus facilities only. In the spring of 1994 KRFA disbanded.

In the fall of 1994, KRZR was formed as student organization at the University of Arkansas with the goal of creating an FM station to serve the university and surrounding communities. A consulting engineer was hired to do a frequency check and complete the technical portion for a 500 watt station at 90.1FM.

In the Spring of 1996, a communications lawyer was hired to complete the non-technical portion of the government application for 90.1 FM and it was filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The American Family Association (AFA), a Christian radio organization, also filed for 90.1 FM. Subsequently, KRZR filed for 88.3FM; so did the AFA. After several months, the AFA and the University of Arkansas came to a settlement and the student radio station was given 88.3 FM, while 90.1 FM became a religious outlet. At some point during this process, the callsign KRZR was claimed by a station simulcasting KALZ, a talk radio station. On April 28, 1999, the station ran a search for unused callsigns beginning with the letter K, and of those open callsigns, they chose KXUA.

In the spring of 1999, the University of Arkansas Media Board accepted the student radio station as a campus organization, among the ranks of the Arkansas Traveler (the student newspaper), the Razorback Yearbook, the AuxArc Review (a literary magazine), and UATV. KXUA signed on with its first broadcast on April 1, 2000. In the spirit of April Fools&#x27; Day, the first listeners were led to believe that the station wasn&#x27;t allowed to play music, a stunt upheld by the DJs playing nothing but political speeches. Soon enough the prank was dismissed, and listeners got their first taste of real programming.

For the ten year anniversary, the station promoted a switch in formatting to education programming, and broadcast lectures, quantum physics texts, and audio versions of esoteric Wikipedia articles. Listeners called in and complained all day long filling up the answer machine, and then calling other offices on campus. The joke was revealed at the end of the day during a special retrospective show in the evening, during which many former DJs called in and talked about their experiences with the station.

While the station was originally located at the Student Union Building, in 2020, it moved to Kimpel Hall, in the newly renovated Candace Dixon-Horne Radio Broadcast Center, which includes an office for the DJs and staff, a live studio, and a production studio.

For the twenty-first anniversary, in 2021, the station began a new tradition of producing a zine every year, for the anniversary of the founding of the station. These can be viewed on the station&#x27;s website. They also produce and distribute physical copies of a zine at the time of its publishing.

==Format==

KXUA&#x27;s format is non commercial. The station usually does not play any music that has appeared on the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the last 40 years. Eclectic music, mainly the newest arrivals, plays in the rotation schedule, which is what plays when no DJ-hosted shows are on air. DJs host freeform shows throughout the week, excluding most dates that the university is closed. These shows include music shows, where DJs create a track list and discuss it, as well as podcasts. The rules for what makes a show a music or podcast-form show are generally loose enough to allow the creation of shows that border on both, such as shows that discuss a smaller volume of music much more in-depth than a traditional music show. KXUA also sponsors local events, and schedules in-studio performances from local and traveling musicians. Most genre shows are recorded and made available through the KXUA website and individual DJs websites and on iTunes for free.

All DJs are directly affiliated with the university, either as students or employees, and are volunteers. The executive staff controls the station and is made up entirely of students that and are elected each year. They are the only paid members of the station. The executive staff includes a Station Manager, two music directors, a Social Media Director, a Programming Director, and a Podcasting Director.

KXUA is unique for the Northwest Arkansas region, though somewhat similar to many college stations across the nation. KXUA prides itself in not only providing an opportunity for students to learn broadcasting experience, but as a major source for music education on the campus and community.

<text>The Battle of Baltimore (September 12–15, 1814) took place between British and American forces in the War of 1812. American forces repulsed sea and land invasions off the busy port city of Baltimore, Maryland, and killed the commander of the invading British forces. 

The British and Americans first met at the Battle of North Point. Though the Americans retreated, the battle was a successful delaying action that inflicted heavy casualties on the British, halted their advance, and allowed the defenders at Baltimore to prepare for an attack.

The resistance of Baltimore&#x27;s Fort McHenry during bombardment by the Royal Navy inspired Francis Scott Key to compose the poem &quot;Defence of Fort M&#x27;Henry&quot;, which later became the lyrics for &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner,&quot; the national anthem of the United States.

Future U.S. president James Buchanan served as a private in the defense of Baltimore.

==Background==
Until April 1814, Britain was at war against Napoleonic France, which limited British war aims in America. Meanwhile, the British primarily used a defensive strategy and repelled American invasions of the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada. The Americans gained naval control over Lake Erie in 1813 and seized parts of western Ontario. In the Mississippi Territory, in an area in modern central Alabama, General Andrew Jackson destroyed the military strength of the Creek nation at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814.

Although Great Britain was unwilling to draw military forces from the war with France, it still enjoyed a naval superiority on the ocean, and vessels of North America and West Indies Squadron, based at Bermuda, blockaded American ports on the Atlantic throughout the war, strangling the American economy. Initially, the north-eastern ports were spared this blockade as public sentiments in New York and New England were against the war. The Royal Navy and Royal Marines also occupied American coastal islands and landed military forces for raids along the coast, especially around the Chesapeake Bay, encouraging enslaved blacks to defect to the Crown and recruiting them into the Corps of Colonial Marines.

Following the defeat of Napoleon in the spring of 1814, the British adopted a more aggressive strategy, intended to compel the United States to negotiate a peace that restored the pre-war status quo. Thousands of seasoned British soldiers were deployed to British North America. Most went to the Canadas to re-enforce the defenders. The British Army, Canadian militias, and their First Nations allies drove the American invaders back into the United States. Without naval control of the Great Lakes they were unable to receive supplies, resulting in the British failure to capture Plattsburgh in the Second Battle of Lake Champlain and their withdrawal from US territory. 

A brigade under the command of Major General Robert Ross was sent in early July with several naval vessels to join the forces already operating from Bermuda. The combined forces were to be used for diversionary raids along the Atlantic coast, intended to force the Americans to withdraw forces from Canada. Some historians claim that they were under orders not to carry out any extended operations and were restricted to targets on the coast. 

However, the British had launched three major operations targeting the three largest ports of America at Baltimore, New York City, via Lake Champlain and the Hudson River, and in New Orleans from August 1814 to February 1815. Each of these three expeditions had over 10,000 British Army troops, many of them the best soldiers and officers from the Peninsular War, so they were not just minor diversionary raids. Britain had already captured most of modern-day Maine and re-established the Crown colony of New Ireland in September 1814.

An ambitious raid was planned as the result of a letter sent to Bermuda on 2 June by Sir George Prévost, Governor General of The Canadas, who called for retaliation in response to the &quot;wanton destruction of private property along the north shores of Lake Erie&quot; by American forces under Colonel John Campbell in May, the most notable being the Raid on Port Dover. Prévost argued that,

... in consequence of the late disgraceful conduct of the American troops in the wanton destruction of private property on the north shores of Lake Erie, in order that if the war with the United States continues you may, should you judge it advisable, assist in inflicting that measure of retaliation which shall deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages.

The letter was considered by Ross and Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, who had replaced Sir John Borlase Warren earlier that year as the Commander-in-Chief of the North America and West Indies Station of the Royal Navy, headquartered at Admiralty House in Bermuda, in planning how to use their forces. Cochrane&#x27;s junior, Rear Admiral George Cockburn, had been commanding ships of the squadron in the operations on the Chesapeake Bay since the previous year.

On 25 June he wrote to Cochrane stressing that the defenses there were weak, and he felt that several major cities were vulnerable to attack. Cochrane suggested attacking Baltimore, Washington and Philadelphia. On 17 July, Cockburn recommended Washington as the target, because of the comparative ease of attacking the national capital and &quot;the greater political effect likely to result&quot;.

On 18 July, Cochrane ordered Cockburn that to &quot;deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages...&quot; You are hereby required and directed to &quot;destroy and lay waste such towns and districts as you may find assailable&quot;. Cochrane instructed, &quot;You will spare merely the lives of the unarmed inhabitants of the United States&quot;.

In August, the vessels in Bermuda sailed from the Royal Naval Dockyard and St. George&#x27;s to join those already operating along the American Atlantic coast. After defeating a US Navy gunboat flotilla, a military force totaling 4,370, composed of British Army, Royal Marines, and Royal Navy detachments for shore service, under Ross was landed in Virginia. After beating off an American force of 1,200 on the 23rd, on the 24th they attacked the prepared defenses of the main American force of roughly 6,400 US Army soldiers, militiamen, US Marines, and US Navy sailors in the Battle of Bladensburg. 

Despite the considerable disadvantage in numbers, as standard military logic dictates that a three-to-one advantage is needed in carrying out an attack on prepared defenses, and sustaining heavy casualties, the British force routed the American defenders and cleared the path into the capital. President James Madison and the entire government fled the city, and went North, to the town of Brookeville, Maryland.

On 24 August 1814, British troops led by Rear Admiral George Cockburn and Major General Robert Ross entered Washington and captured the city with a force of 4,500 &quot;battle-hardened&quot; men, during the burning of Washington. British troops, commanded by Ross, set fire to a number of public buildings, including the White House and the United States Capitol. Extensive damage to the interiors and the contents of both were reported. The British forces returned to their ships.

The British sent a fleet up the Potomac to cut off Washington&#x27;s water access and threaten the prosperous ports of Alexandria, just downstream of Washington, and Georgetown, just upstream. The mere appearance of the fleet cowed American defenders into fleeing from Fort Warburton without firing a shot, and undefended Alexandria surrendered. The British spent several days looting hundreds of tons of merchandise from city merchants.

They then turned their attention north to Baltimore, where they hoped to strike a powerful blow against the demoralized Americans. Baltimore was a busy port and was thought by the British to harbor many of the privateers who were raiding British shipping. The British planned a combined operation, with Ross launching a land attack at North Point, and Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane laying siege to Fort McHenry, which was the point defensive installation in Baltimore Harbor.

Baltimore&#x27;s defenses had been planned and overseen by the state militia commander, Major General Samuel Smith.

The city&#x27;s defense was under the overall command of Major General Samuel Smith, an officer of the Maryland Militia. He dispatched roughly 3,000 men under the command of General John Stricker to meet the British in a forward engagement. General Stricker was to stall the British invasion force to delay the British advance long enough for Major General Smith to complete the defenses in Baltimore.

The land invasion force for the British was led by Ross, who was killed in the second shift of the American defense by an American sharpshooter. It has been suggested that either Daniel Wells or Henry McComas of Captain Aisquith&#x27;s rifle company, of the 5th Maryland Militia regiment was responsible, and both were killed shortly afterwards.

After Ross&#x27;s death, the British army came under the command of Colonel Arthur Brooke. The Americans had already begun to form an organized retreat back to the main defenses of Baltimore, where they awaited a British assault.

===Hampstead Hill===
Rodgers Bastion, also known as Sheppard&#x27;s Bastion, located on Hampstead Hill, now part of Patterson Park, was the centerpiece of a 3-mile-wide earthworks from the outer harbor in Canton, north to Belair Road, dug to defend the eastern approach to Baltimore against the British. The redoubt was assembled and commanded by U.S. Navy Commodore John Rodgers, with General Smith in command of the overall line. At dawn on September 13, the day after the Battle of North Point, some 4,300 British troops advanced north on North Point Road, then west along the Philadelphia Road (now Maryland Route 7) toward Baltimore. U.S. troops were forced to retreat to the main defensive line around the city. The British commander, Col. Arthur Brooke, established his new headquarters at the Sterret House on Surrey Farm, now called Armistead Gardens, about two miles east-northeast of Hampstead Hill.

When the British began probing actions on Baltimore&#x27;s inner defenses, the American line was defended by 100 cannons and more than 10,000 regular troops, including two shadowing infantry regiments commanded by general officers Stricker and Winder as well as a few thousand local militia and irregulars. The defenses were far stronger than the British anticipated. The American defenders at Fort McHenry successfully stopped British naval forces but a few ships were still able to provide artillery support.

Once the British had taken the outer defenses, the inner defenses became the priority. The British infantry had not anticipated how well defended they would be, so the first attack was a failure. However, Brooke&#x27;s forces managed to outflank and to overrun American positions to the right. After a discussion with lower ranking officers, Brooke decided that the British should bombard the fort instead of risk a frontal assault and, at 3:00 a.m. on September 14, ordered the British troops to return to the ships.

===Fort McHenry===
At Fort McHenry, some 1,000 soldiers under the command of Major George Armistead awaited the British naval bombardment. Their defense was augmented by the sinking of a line of American merchant ships at the adjacent entrance to Baltimore Harbor in order to further thwart the passage of British ships.

The attack began on September 13, as the British fleet of some nineteen ships began pounding the fort with Congreve rockets (from rocket vessel HMS &quot;Erebus&quot;) and mortar shells (from bomb vessels &quot;Terror&quot;, &quot;Volcano&quot;, &quot;Meteor&quot;, &quot;Devastation&quot;, and &quot;Aetna&quot;). After an initial exchange of fire, the British fleet withdrew to just beyond the range of Fort McHenry&#x27;s cannons and continued to bombard the American redoubts for the next 25 hours. Although 1,500 to 1,800 cannonballs were launched at the fort, damage was light because of recent fortification that had been completed prior to the battle.

After nightfall, Cochrane ordered a landing to be made by small boats to the shore just west of the fort, away from the harbor opening on which the fort&#x27;s defense was concentrated. He hoped that the landing party might slip past Fort McHenry and draw Smith&#x27;s army away from the main British land assault on the city&#x27;s eastern border. That gave the British a good diversion for half an hour and allowed them to fire again and again. 

On the morning of September 14, the oversized American flag, which had been made a year earlier by local flagmaker Mary Pickersgill and her 13-year-old daughter, was raised over Fort McHenry, replacing the tattered storm flag which had flown during battle. It was responded to by a small encampment of British riflemen on the right flank, who fired a round each at the sky and taunted the Americans just before they too returned to the shore line.

Originally, historians said that the oversized Star Spangled Banner Flag was raised to taunt the British, but that is not the case. The oversized flag was used every morning for reveille, as was the case on the morning of September 14.

Brooke had been instructed not to attack the American positions around Baltimore unless he was certain that there were fewer than 2,000 men in the fort. Because of his orders, Brooke had to withdraw from his positions and returned to the fleet, which would set sail for New Orleans.

==Aftermath==
Colonel Brooke&#x27;s troops withdrew, and Admiral Cochrane&#x27;s fleet sailed off to regroup before his next (and final) assault on the United States, at the Battle of New Orleans. Armistead was soon promoted to lieutenant colonel. Much weakened by the arduous preparations for the battle, he died at 38, only three years after the battle.

Three active battalions of the Regular Army (1-4 Inf, 2-4 Inf and 3-4 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of the old 36th and 38th Infantry Regiments, both of which were at Fort McHenry during the bombardment. The lineage of the 5th Maryland Infantry Regiment, which played a major role in the Battle of North Point, is perpetuated by the Maryland Army National Guard&#x27;s 175th Infantry Regiment.

The battle is commemorated in the Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine.

===Star Spangled Banner===
An American lawyer and amateur poet, Francis Scott Key, was on a mercy mission for the release of Dr. William Beanes, a prisoner of the British. Key showed the British letters from wounded British officers praising the care that they received from Dr. Beanes. The British agreed to release Beanes, but Key and Beanes were forced to stay with the British until the attack on Baltimore was over. 

Key watched the proceedings from a truce ship in the Patapsco River. On the morning of the 14th, Key saw the American flag waving above Fort McHenry. Inspired, he began jotting down verses on the back of a letter he was carrying. Key&#x27;s poem, originally named &quot;Defence of Fort M&#x27;Henry&quot;, was printed on pamphlets by the &quot;Baltimore American&quot;.

Key&#x27;s poem was later set to the tune of a British song called &quot;To Anacreon in Heaven&quot;, the official song of the Anacreontic Society, an 18th-century gentlemen&#x27;s club of amateur musicians in London. The song eventually became known as &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. The US Congress made it the national anthem of the United States in 1931.

<text>Vsevolod Mikhaylovich Abramovich (; August 11, 1890 – April 24, 1913) was a pioneering aviator.

==Biography==
Abramovich was born on August 11, 1890, in Odessa, son of poet Mikhail Abramovich and grandson of the Yiddish writer Mendele Mocher Sforim. He studied at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin). In 1911 he earned a pilot&#x27;s licence. He began working for the Wright brothers&#x27; German subsidiary, Flugmaschinen Wright in Johannisthal, and became their chief test pilot.

In 1912, Abramovich built his own aircraft, the Abramovich Flyer, based on what he had learned at the Wright factory. He flew it to Saint Petersburg, Russia to participate in a military aircraft competition.

The same year, he set a world altitude record of 2,100 meters (6,888 feet) and an endurance record for carrying four passengers for 46 minutes and 57 seconds. He was killed in an aviation accident while instructing a student pilot, Evgeniya Shakhovskaya, at Johannisthal on April 24, 1913.

<text>Tangiteroria is a small rural community in the North Island of New Zealand. It is located halfway between Whangārei and Dargaville on State Highway 14 on the banks of the Northern Wairoa river.

It consists of a primary school, pub (currently closed), Catholic Church (currently closed), petrol station (currently closed), marae, and a sports complex/community centre (open for meals fortnightly). The sports complex and community centre were destroyed by a fire in the early hours of January 16, 2020, but rebuilt and opened in September 2023. 

Kirikopuni and Pukehuia both had railway stations on the Dargaville Branch for the movement of stock throughout Northland and a passenger service.

==History and culture==
A Wesleyan mission station was set up by James Wallis in 1836, and then run by James Buller. The station lasted until 1853. Kauri logs were sent down the river to be milled in the mid-1860s. A flax mill operated in the late 19th century.

A steamer service up the Wairoa River was established to Tangiteroria by the &quot;Tangihua&quot; in 1878, and Watson&#x27;s Landing and store flourished there in 1881. The S.S. &quot;Blanche&quot; ran a service between Dargaville and Tangiteroria in 1891-2, and the S.S. &quot;Ethel&quot; was doing the run twice a week in 1896. It was replaced by the S.S. &quot;Naumai&quot; from 1903-1920. The service finished in 1929. Road access was established in the 1890s.

==Marae==

<doc id="1048718" wikidata="Q5467681" url="?curid=1048718" title="Ford CHT engine">
<text>The Ford CHT engine is an inline four-cylinder internal combustion engine family produced by the Ford Motor Company in Brazil during the 1980s and 1990s. It was derived from the Renault Cléon-Fonte engine. It is unrelated to the similarly-named Ford CVH engine.

==Ford Cléon-Fonte==
Ford do Brasil acquired manufacturing rights for the Cléon-Fonte engine when they took over Willys&#x27; Brazilian operation in the late 1960s. The engine was part of the Renault-based &quot;Projeto M&quot; (Project M) joint venture between Willys do Brasil and Renault. The Cléon-Fonte has a wet linered cast iron block with five main bearings, an aluminum cylinder head, and a single, high-mounted cam-in-block that drives two overhead valves per cylinder via short pushrods and rocker arms, all features retained in the CHT.

Projeto M came to market as the Ford Corcel in 1968. The Cléon-Fonte in early cars displaced 1.3 L. Ford later raised this to 1.4 L by increasing the bore diameter, creating the &quot;1300-B&quot; when fitted with a single barrel carburetor, or the &quot;1300-C&quot; and later &quot;XP&quot; when fitted with a two barrel carburetor. Ford enlarged the Cléon-Fonte&#x27;s dimensions again in 1979, resulting in a displacement of 1.6 L.

==Redesign==
In mid-1981, Ford do Brasil began &quot;Projeto Zeta&quot;, to adapt the new MkIII series front-wheel-drive (FWD) Ford Escort to the Brazilian market. When the car debuted in August 1983, one of the biggest changes was the substitution of a Brazilian-developed engine for the CVH engine used in other markets. Ford do Brasil had argued for the change, saying that a revised Cléon-Forte would be more economical and easier for the Brazilian engineers to convert to run on ethanol.

The design effort for the new engine was led by Luc de Ferran. While considered a Brazilian design, it is reported that Ford of Europe had some input to the work, and that Renault was consulted. Ford began with their largest Cléon-Fonte block, whose bore and stroke gave a displacement of . They also created a smaller version with a bore.

The goal of the redesign was to improve combustion efficiency by swirling the intake charge entering the combustion chambers. Ford had their engineers design a new cylinder head for the Cléon-Fonte block, and renamed the resulting engine the CHT, which stands for &quot;Compound High Turbulence&quot;. Changes were also made to the intake and exhaust manifolds, valve timing and compression ratio.

The CHT became known as a smooth running engine with good performance at low engine speeds, but as an OHV design it suffered in comparison to the contemporary SOHC Volkswagen EA827 engine, while also producing less power. The engine earned a reputation for simplicity and toughness, and for producing good torque at low speeds, making it suitable for most common driving conditions.

==Production use==

The CHT was introduced in 1983 in the Brazilian MkIII Escort, the first of the Escort series released in Brazil. The highest output ethanol engines were reserved for the Escort XR3. Ford also used the CHT in other new car lines, or substituted it for the Cléon-Fonte in existing lines, including the Corcel II sedan and related Belina II wagon, Del Rey two- and four-door sedans and Del Rey Belina wagon, first generation Verona two-door sedan, and Pampa coupé utility.

In March 1992, spurred by changes to vehicle taxation laws, a smaller version was released, with a bore and stroke and displacement of . It was used in the Escort Hobby. 

After 1996, the CHT was first replaced by the Kent Endura-E engine, then by the 1.0 L and 1.6 L Zetec RoCam from 2000 onward.

==Versions==
Initially available in 1.35 L or 1.6 L displacements, the CHT was also offered in both gasoline and ethanol fuel versions. Two different levels of engine tune were developed; the regular CHT engine, and the CHT E-MÁX (&quot;Economia Maximizada&quot; — maximised economy) that was optimized for fuel efficiency. A CHT E-MÁX engine received an award for most economical engine of its time in Brazil, returning on gasoline.

Early in the project, up to seven versions of the engine were under development. Variants included regular and high-compression gasoline engines in 1.35 L and 1.6 L sizes, ethanol fueled engines in 1.35 L and 1.6 L sizes, and a high-performance ethanol engine:

* 1341 cc CHT E-MÁX, gasoline, 9.0:1 Compression ratio (CR), at 5000 rpm, 
* 1341 cc CHT E-MÁX, gasoline, 9.5:1 CR, at 5000 rpm, 
* 1341 cc CHT E-MÁX, ethanol, 12.0:1 CR, at 5000 rpm, 
* 1555 cc CHT, gasoline, 9.0:1 CR, at 4800 rpm, 
* 1555 cc CHT, gasoline, 9.5:1 CR, at 5400 rpm, 
* 1555 cc CHT, ethanol, 12.0:1 CR, at 5200 rpm, 
* 1555 cc CHT, ethanol, 12.0:1 CR, — , —

In 1983, five versions were offered in the Ford Escort:
* 1341 cc CHT E-MÁX, gasoline, 9.0:1 CR, at 5000 rpm, at 2800 rpm
* 1341 cc CHT E-MÁX, ethanol, 12.0:1 CR, at 5000 rpm, at 2800 rpm
* 1555 cc CHT, gasoline, 9.0:1 CR, at 4800 rpm, at 2400 rpm
* 1555 cc CHT, ethanol, 12.0:1 CR, at 5200 rpm, at 3600 rpm
* 1555 cc CHT, ethanol, 12.0:1 CR, at 5600 rpm, at 4000 rpm

The engine was revised in 1987 with the release of the MkIV Ford Escort. New versions included a 1.6 L CHT E-MÁX. The 1988 Ford Escort offered one gasoline and two ethanol fueled options:
* 1555 cc CHT E-MÁX, gasoline, 9.0:1 CR, at 5200 rpm, at 2400 rpm
* 1555 cc CHT E-MÁX, ethanol, 12.0:1 CR, at 5000 rpm, at 2400 rpm
* 1555 cc CHT E-MÁX, ethanol, 12.0:1 CR, at 5600 rpm, at 4000 rpm

Ford only used the 1.0 L CHT in the Escort Hobby:
* 997 cc gasoline at 5800 rpm, at 3600 rpm

==Volkswagen==
From 1987 to 1996, Ford and Volkswagen in Brazil operated as a joint venture under the name AutoLatina. During this time, the CHT was renamed the AE engine, for &quot;Alta Economia&quot; (High Economy). Volkswagen began selling rebadged Ford models, some of which carried forward the 1.6 L CHT, now called the AE-1600, and some of which did not. The Volkswagen Apollo coupé, a rebadged first generation Ford Verona, never offered the AE-1600. The Escort-based Volkswagen Logus two-door coupé was sold with an AE-1600 option, while the related first generation four-door Volkswagen Pointer was not.

The only line native to Volkswagen that adopted the AE engine was the Volkswagen Gol. VW offered the AE-1600 in the first generation Gol hatchbacks, Voyage sedan, Parati station wagon, and Saveiro coupé utility. VW offered the 1.0 L AE-1000 in the hatchbacks when the laws changed to favor sub-1 L vehicles. The second generation Gol added single-point fuel injection, and was the last car to use the engine, dropping it after 1996. The AE-1000 was replaced by the EA111, and the AE-1600 by the EA827.

<text>Russian philosophy includes a variety of philosophical movements. Authors who developed them are listed below sorted by movement.

While most authors listed below are primarily philosophers, also included here are some Russian fiction writers, such as Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, who are also known as philosophers.

Russian philosophy as a separate entity started its development in the 19th century, defined initially by the opposition of Westernizers, advocating Russia&#x27;s following the Western political and economical models, and Slavophiles, insisting on developing Russia as a unique civilization. The latter group included Nikolai Danilevsky and Konstantin Leontiev, the early founders of eurasianism. The discussion of Russia&#x27;s place in the world has since become the most characteristic feature of Russian philosophy.

In its further development, Russian philosophy was also marked by deep connection to literature and interest in creativity, society, politics and nationalism; cosmos and religion were other notable subjects.

Notable philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include Vladimir Solovyev, Vasily Rozanov, Lev Shestov, Leo Tolstoy, Sergei Bulgakov, Pavel Florensky, Nikolai Berdyaev, Pitirim Sorokin, and Vladimir Vernadsky.

From the early 1920s to late 1980s, Russian philosophy was dominated by Marxism.

A handful of dissident philosophers survived through the Soviet period, among them Aleksei Losev. Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 gave way for new schools of thought to spring up, among them Moscow Logic Circle, and Tartu-Moscow Semiotic School.

The Glenorchy local government area has a population of 50,411, covering the suburbs north of central Hobart on the western shore of the Derwent River, including its namesake suburb, Glenorchy.

== History ==
Tasmanian Aboriginals were the first inhabitants of the area where Glenorchy lies today. The first European to arrive in Glenorchy was a Frenchman, who was a member of Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux&#x27;s crew, in 1793. An English expedition arrived two months later, under the command of John Hayes. Hayes sailed up the river which he referred to as the Derwent. He named Prince of Wales Bay and called the area around New Town and Moonah &quot;King George&#x27;s Plains&quot;. Hayes named the Glenorchy area as New Cumberland.

This French presence was the main influence in Lieutenant Governor Bowen&#x27;s decision to settle where Hobart now exists.

The period between 1840 and 1860 was when steady growth was seen in Glenorchy, culminating in the area becoming a municipality in 1864. Glenorchy is believed to have been so named by governor Lachlan Macquarie after his wife&#x27;s home in Scotland. The name means &#x27;glen of tumbling waters&#x27;.

City status was given to Glenorchy on 24 October 1964, exactly one hundred years after it was first proclaimed a municipality.

== Geography ==
The city spans the area along the Derwent River, from just north of the Queens Domain in the south, to the Bridgewater Bridge and Causeway in the north, and extends west as far as the foothills of Mount Wellington.

== Demographics ==
The greater Hobart area has a population of around 222,000 as at the 2016 Census, with the city of Glenorchy local government area having a population of over 46,000. This makes Glenorchy the third most populated city in the greater area of Hobart.

Glenorchy is classified as urban, fringe and medium (UFM) under the Australian Classification of Local Governments.

=== Events ===
The city hosts several annual events, including a regatta at Montrose Bay while at the showgrounds there is the annual Royal Hobart Show and the Hobart Cup at Tattersalls Park.

The Moorilla Estate often holds musical performances during the period of summer. Artists who have played at this venue include Grinspoon, Paul Kelly and The Pretenders.

The Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) opened on the Moorilla estate in 2011, and quickly became a popular tourist attraction.

<text>The Three Sisters Wilderness is a wilderness area in the Cascade Range, within the Willamette and Deschutes National Forests in Oregon, United States. It comprises , making it the second-largest wilderness area in Oregon, after the Eagle Cap Wilderness. It was established by the United States Congress in 1964 and is named for the Three Sisters volcanoes. The wilderness boundary encloses the Three Sisters as well as Broken Top, which is southeast of South Sister.

Three Sisters was designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve under the Man and the Biosphere Programme in 1976, and was one of 17 reserves in the United States withdrawn from the programme in June 2017.

Oregon Route 242 separates the Three Sisters Wilderness from the Mount Washington Wilderness to the north, while the Waldo Lake Wilderness shares the southern boundary.

The three peaks were known by pioneers as Faith, Hope and Charity. Nearby landmarks include The Husband, The Wife, and the Little Brother.

==Geology==
Many types of landforms make up the wilderness area, but the most common are volcanic features, the most notable being the Cascades which are stratovolcanoes having formed around 1.6 million years ago. Numerous cinder cones have formed on their flanks as well as many lava flows that contain hundreds of lava tubes.
==Topography==
The Three Sisters Wilderness ranges in elevation from . The Three Sisters—North Sister at , Middle Sister at , and South Sister at — are found in the eastern portion of the Wilderness. Including Broken Top—just to the south at — there are 14 glaciers offering one of the best examples of the effects of glaciation in the Pacific Northwest. Collier Glacier, between North and Middle Sister, is the largest glacier in Oregon. The headwaters of the Wild and Scenic Whychus Creek (formerly Squaw Creek) emerge in the Wilderness.

==Climate==
==Vegetation==
Forest cover in the Three Sisters Wilderness includes Douglas fir, Pacific silver fir, subalpine fir, mountain hemlock, western hemlock, lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine. A large area of the wilderness above timberline contains alpine meadows.

==Recreation==
Popular recreational activities in the Three Sisters Wilderness include camping, hiking, climbing and fishing. South Sister and Middle Sister are not technically difficult climbs, but summiting North Sister requires technical expertise and equipment. More than of trails cross the wilderness, including of the Pacific Crest Trail. The French Pete Trail and its surrounding old-growth forest, a nationwide political issue in the 1970s, are located on the western edge of the wilderness near Cougar Reservoir.

<text>William Haggard (born Croydon 11 August 1907, died Frinton-on-Sea 27 October 1993) was the pseudonym of Richard Henry Michael Clayton, the son of the Rev. Henry James Clayton and Mabel Sarah Clayton. He was an English writer of fictional spy thrillers set in the 1960s through the 1980s, or, as the writer H. R. F. Keating called them, &quot;action novels of international power.&quot; Like C. P. Snow, he was a quintessentially British Establishment figure who had been a civil servant in India, and his books vigorously put forth his perhaps idiosyncratic points of view. The principal character in most of his novels is the urbane Colonel Charles Russell of the fictional Security Executive, (clearly based on the actual MI5 or Security Service), who moves easily and gracefully along Snow&#x27;s Corridors of Power in Whitehall. During the years of the fictional spy mania initially begun by the James Bond stories, Haggard was considered by most critics to be at the very top of the field.

Keating, however, also observes that &quot;...the books were fore-runners in a trend that was noticeable in both British and American crime writing from the late 1960&#x27;s onwards, a turning of the tide to flow to the right. After the revolution carried out in the late 1930s by Eric Ambler in the espionage field... a revolution which swung crime writing generally to the left... there had been little change. With the Haggard books the first signs of a silent swing began to show.&quot;

Writing about his fiction, Haggard himself said: My novels are chiefly novels of suspense with a background of international politics. A Colonel Charles Russell of the Security Executive, a not entirely imaginary British counter-espionage organization, while not a protagonist in the technical sense, holds the story line together in the background by his operations, while the characters in the foreground carry the action.&quot;

==Life==

Born in Croydon, Surrey, Haggard was educated at Lancing College and received his B.A. from Christ Church, Oxford. He entered the Indian Civil Service and eventually became a judge. He was then on the General Staff in the Indian Army from 1939 to 1946, at least part of the time as an intelligence officer, rising to Lieutenant Colonel. He obtained a M.A. from Oxford University in 1947 and served on the Board of Trade from 1947 to 1969, from 1965 to 1969 being the Controller of Enemy Property. He married Barbara Myfanwy Sant in 1936; they had one son and one daughter. Haggard&#x27;s writing career began in 1958 with the publication of his first novel, Slow Burner. He chose his &quot;nom de plume&quot; from his mother&#x27;s maiden name, Haggard; she was said to be a distant relative of the well-known Victorian adventure writer H. Rider Haggard.

<text>Grażyna Bacewicz Biernacka (; 5 February 1909 – 17 January 1969) was a Polish composer and violinist of Lithuanian origin. She is the second Polish female composer to have achieved national and international recognition, the first being Maria Szymanowska in the early 19th century.

== Life ==
Bacewicz was born in Łódź. Her father and her brother Vytautas, also a composer, identified as Lithuanian and used the last name Bacevičius; her other brother Kiejstut identified as Polish. Her father, Wincenty Bacewicz, gave Grażyna her first piano and violin lessons. In 1928 she began studying at the Warsaw Conservatory, where she studied violin with Józef Jarzębski and piano with Józef Turczyński, and composition with Kazimierz Sikorski, graduating in 1932 as a violinist and composer. She continued her education in Paris, having been granted a stipend by Ignacy Jan Paderewski to attend the École Normale de Musique, and studied there in 1932–33 with Nadia Boulanger (composition) and André Touret (violin). She returned briefly to Poland to teach in Łódź, but returned to Paris in 1934 in order to study with the Hungarian violinist Carl Flesch.

After completing her studies, Bacewicz took part in numerous events as a soloist, composer, and jury member. From 1936 to 1938 she was the principal violinist of the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra, which was directed then by Grzegorz Fitelberg. This position gave her the chance to hear much of her own music. During World War II, Grażyna Bacewicz lived in Warsaw. She continued to compose and gave secret underground concerts, where she premiered her Suite for Two Violins.

Bacewicz also dedicated time to family life. She was married in 1936, and in 1942 gave birth to a daughter, , who became a recognized painter. Following the Warsaw uprising they escaped the destroyed city and temporarily settled in Lublin.

After the war, she took up the position of professor at the State Conservatoire of Music in Łódź. At this time she was shifting her musical activity towards composition, drawn by her many awards and commissions. Composition finally became her only occupation from 1954, the year in which she suffered serious injuries in a car accident. She died of a heart attack in 1969 in Warsaw.

== Compositions ==
Many of her compositions feature the violin. Among them are seven violin concertos, five sonatas for violin with piano, three for violin solo (including an early, unnumbered one from 1929), a Quartet for four violins, seven string quartets, and two piano quintets. Her orchestral works include four numbered symphonies (1945, 1951, 1952, and 1953), a Symphony for Strings (1946), and two early symphonies, now lost.

<text>CSS &quot;Oregon&quot; was a wooden sidewheel steamer that served as a gunboat in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Built in 1846 for the Mobile Mail Line, she transported mail between New Orleans, Louisiana, and Mobile, Alabama, before the war. In 1861, she was seized by the Governor of Louisiana, Thomas Overton Moore, and served as a blockade runner before being selected for use by the Confederate Army. After transferring men and supplies to Ship Island, she was formally converted into a gunboat and armed with four cannon. Remaining behind on Lake Pontchartrain when many Confederate warships were transferred up the Mississippi River, &quot;Oregon&quot; served in the Mississippi Sound and Pass Christian areas. She took part in several minor actions involving USS &quot;New London&quot;, two of which resulted in the Confederates moving into shallow water to avoid close-range action, and the third ending when the Confederate ships abandoned the Pass Christian area. In April 1862, Union pressure confined her and other Confederate ships to Lake Pontchartrain. Later that month, with Union forces closing in on New Orleans, &quot;Oregon&quot; was sunk as a blockship. Her wreck was removed and destroyed in the early 1870s.

== Construction and pre-war career ==
&quot;Oregon&quot; was built at New York City in 1846. A sidewheel steamer, she also had a single mast. With a hull that was made from wood, she had one deck and a billethead. She was long, had a beam of , weighed 532 tons, and had a draft of . &quot;Oregon&quot; is reported by the &quot;Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships&quot; to have resembled the steamer &quot;California&quot;. Built for the Mobile Mail Line, &quot;Oregon&quot; was used to transport mail between Mobile, Alabama, and New Orleans, Louisiana. As of April 1861, the Geddes family of New Orleans and Cincinnati had a 60 percent ownership stake in the vessel, with the remainder being in the hands of two Mobile residents: R. A. Heirn and Samuel Wolff. Heirn had been listed as the ship&#x27;s master in 1854.

==American Civil War==
After the outbreak of the American Civil War in April 1861, Governor of Louisiana Thomas Overton Moore had the ship seized. While the United States Navy had a number of vessels at the beginning of the war, the Confederates had to build a navy from nothing with limited infrastructure and manufacturing. At a decided disadvantage in the naval sphere, the Confederates relied heavily on blockade running and to a lesser degree privateering. &quot;Oregon&quot; repeatedly ran the Union blockade, and under the command of Captain A. P. Boardman made 92 &quot;entrance and clearances&quot; to ports through the blockade. Both the Confederate States Army and the Confederate States Navy were selecting vessels for military service, and &quot;Oregon&quot; and the steamer &quot;J. D. Swain&quot; were chosen by the Confederate Army that summer. &quot;Oregon&quot; was armed with an 8-inch (20cm) columbiad and a 12-pounder (5 kg) howitzer, while &quot;J. D. Swain&quot; was armed with a 32-pounder (15 kg) rifled cannon and another howitzer.

In July, the two ships participated in a joint Army-Navy expedition. Launches from the Union blockading force were harassing the Confederate coastline, and the Confederates formed an expedition to counter the threat. About 135 sailors and marines were loaded onto &quot;Oregon&quot; and &quot;J. D. Swain&quot;, and the two ships left Lake Pontchartrain on July 5 and headed to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. After spending the next day unsuccessfully looking for Union vessels, the vessels landed at Ship Island, which was located in a strategic place off of the Confederate coastline. The sailors and marines began constructing a small fortification, while &quot;Oregon&quot; inspected two fishing boats in the area before releasing them. The four cannons on the Confederate ships were taken ashore to defend the island. &quot;Oregon&quot; and &quot;J. D. Swain&quot; returned to New Orleans on July 7, and the former returned with the steamer CSS &quot;Gray Cloud&quot; the next day to bring further men and supplies for the fort. On July 13, &quot;Oregon&quot; and the steamer CSS &quot;Arrow&quot; attempted to lure the gunboat USS &quot;Massachusetts&quot; into the range of the Confederate cannon on Ship Island, but the Union vessel remained at a distance.

&quot;Oregon&quot; was one of two ships that was used to run supplies to the position on Ship Island. The Confederate Army eventually fitted her as a gunboat and placed her under the command of Captain Abraham L. Myers. She was armed with one 8-inch (203 mm) cannon, one 32-pounder (15 kg) gun, and two small howitzers. Worried that the garrison at Ship Island could be easily cut off by the Union Navy and starved into submission, Confederate Major General David Twiggs ordered the island abandoned on September 13. &quot;Oregon&quot; helped evacuate supplies from the island, and the withdrawal was completed on September 16. In late 1861 and early 1862, much of the Confederate fleet in New Orleans was transferred up the Mississippi River to support the Confederate defenses of Columbus, Kentucky, but &quot;Oregon&quot; remained behind, serving on Lake Pontchartrain and intended to help other ships defend the coasts of Louisiana and Mississippi. On December 7, 1861, the gunboat CSS &quot;Pamlico&quot; sighted Union vessels entering Mississippi Sound. &quot;Oregon&quot; was present at Mississippi City, Mississippi, to transport equipment for a powder mill from there to New Orleans, and joined &quot;Pamlico&quot; in confronting the Union ships, which turned out to be the steamers USS &quot;New London&quot; and USS &quot;De Soto&quot;. Remaining in shallow water that the Union vessels could not enter, the Confederates fired on them with two rifled cannon. &quot;Oregon&quot; and &quot;Pamlico&quot; ignored a challenge from &quot;New London&quot; for a closer quarters fight, and the Union ships withdrew.

&quot;Pamlico&quot; then escorted &quot;Oregon&quot; back to New Orleans, where the latter unloaded the power mill equipment, which increased the city&#x27;s capacity for gunpowder production. After meeting a blockade runner in Lake Borgne, &quot;Pamlico&quot; and &quot;Oregon&quot; attempted to escort her into the Gulf of Mexico on December 20, but were detected by Union forces near Ship Island and forced to withdraw back to Lake Borgne. On March 25, 1862, &quot;Oregon&quot; was escorted by &quot;Pamlico&quot; to the Pass Christian area to deliver supplies and then on her own moved towards Ship Island to scout Union positions. Withdrawing to Pass Christian after being sighted, she was pursued by &quot;New London&quot;. &quot;Oregon&quot; and &quot;Pamlico&quot; moved to engage the Union ship, and began firing from a range of . Two of &quot;Pamlico&quot;″s cannons were unable to be fired safely due to defective ammunition, and after &quot;Pamlico&quot;″s third cannon was rendered unusable after a projectile became stuck in the barrel, the two ships withdrew into shallow water, where &quot;New London&quot; could not pursue. The Union ship fell back several hours later.

On April 3, &quot;New London&quot;, the steamer USS &quot;John P. Jackson&quot;, and the troop transport USS &quot;Henry Lewis&quot; left Biloxi, Mississippi, to move against Pass Christian. &quot;Pamlico&quot;, &quot;Oregon&quot;, and the gunboat CSS &quot;Carondelet&quot; were mobilized to counter the threat. In an action offshore of Pass Christian, Confederate fire forced &quot;Henry Lewis&quot; to withdraw, and the other Union vessels suffered light damage. &quot;Oregon&quot; suffered a hit to her ship&#x27;s wheel, and her pilot was wounded when a projectile entered the pilothouse. With &quot;Carondelet&quot;″s wheel also damaged in the battle and the steamer USS &quot;Hatteras&quot; approaching, the Confederate vessels withdrew to Lake Pontchartrain and the Union forces moved on to Pass Christian. The 1,200 troops aboard &quot;Henry Lewis&quot; landed, and the area was captured. With Union forces preparing to attack New Orleans, &quot;Oregon&quot;, &quot;Pamlico&quot;, &quot;Carondelet&quot;, &quot;Arrow&quot;, and the gunboat CSS &quot;Bienville&quot; remained at Lake Pontchartrian, guarding Chef Menteur Pass and the Rigolets.

On April 24, Union Navy forces under Flag Officer David Glasgow Farragut pushed passed the Confederate defenses at Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip, and then moved past the defenses at Chalmette, Louisiana, the next day. New Orleans was largely indefensible after the fall of those positions, and &quot;Oregon&quot; was sunk as a blockship. Naval historian Neil P. Chatelain states that she was sunk in the Rigolets between Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Borgne, while historian W. Craig Gaines places the sinking in either the Tchefuncte River or the Bogue Falaya River. The wreck later interfered with the escape of other Confederate vessels from Lake Pontchartrain, and remained there until a contractor for the United States Army Corps of Engineers removed it between 1872 and 1873. Any iron debris was removed by the contractor, while the rest of the wreck was burned on shore.

<text>Tadeusz Baird (26 July 19282 September 1981) was a Polish composer.

==Biography==
Baird was born in Grodzisk Mazowiecki, in Poland. His father Edward was Polish, while his mother Maria (née Popov) was Russian. In 1944 at the age of 16 he was deported to Germany as a forced labourer, and after a failed escape attempt was imprisoned in a concentration camp. After liberation by the Americans he spent six months recovering at the military hospital in Zweckel before returning to Poland. Between 1947 and 1951 Baird studied composition and musicology in Warsaw under Piotr Rytek and Kazimierz Sikorski, and piano with Tadeusz Wituski. In 1949 he founded Group 49 along with Kazimierz Serocki and Jan Krenz. The aim of Group 49 was to write communicative and expressive music according to socialist realism, the dominant ideology in the Eastern Bloc at the time.

After Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 he increasingly turned to serialism. In 1956, along with Kazimierz Serocki, he founded the Warsaw Autumn international contemporary music festival. In 1974 he began to teach composition at the National College of Music (currently the Music Academy) in Warsaw. In 1977, now a full professor, he was offered a post to teach a composition class at the Warsaw Academy of Music, and also membership in the Academie der Künste der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik – Berlin in 1979.

Baird died in 1981, aged 53.

==Compositions==
He wrote both large-scale symphonies and chamber music; however, of great importance in his output are numerous vocal cycles inspired by poetry. He was also a composer of film and theatre music. Baird&#x27;s music is usually melodic, lyrical, very expressive, and intensely subjective. It is often rooted in the post-Romantic tradition, despite the use of serial techniques. Alistair Wightman identifies Baird as &quot;a late Romantic lyricist and successor not only to Berg, but Mahler and Szymanowski&quot;. Like Berg, his use of serialism was always very free and expressive, as in his String Quartet (1957).

But the later works, starting with the 1966 one-act opera &quot;Jutro&quot; (&quot;tomorrow&quot;, based on the short story by Joseph Conrad) become darker, particularly in the orchestral piece &quot;Psychodrama&quot; (1972) and in his final work, the song cycle for baritone and orchestra &quot;Głosy z oddali&quot; (‘Voices from afar’), which sets a bleak text by Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz on the subject of death and personal extinction. This change in perspective was a result of the traumatic experiences he faced during World War II and on into the early 1950s. Barbara Literska sees him as &quot;a prophet of the future of music (postmodernity)&quot;.

<text>The Billancourt engine was an automotive engine designed by Renault for the Renault 4CV, used subsequently until 1985. It later received the internal code &quot;B&quot;, for Billancourt. The &quot;sport&quot; version is called Ventoux engine.

== History ==
The engine is liquid-cooled, with four cylinders in line. It is also characterised by its three main bearing design and its piston stroke of . It has a cast-iron block, aluminium cylinder head and uses a lateral camshaft to operate overhead valves, which also operated the fan belt on its other end.
In June 1940, Louis Renault appointed Fernand Picard, who became deputy technical director in the automobile engine department. During World War II, he participated in the study of a small car: the future 4CV. Its engine was ready in 1942 and a year later, it first turned a wheel. Renault replaced this engine with the Cléon-Fonte engine, a completely new design.

This engine designed by Fernand Picard was produced from 1947 to 1985, in displacements of , , , and . These differences were carried out by changing the cylinder bore diameter

== Different displacement ==

=== 760 cc ===
Commercialized in 1947 with the Renault 4CV, the first version of the &quot;engine Billancourt&quot; was a of SAE. In 1950, a SAE version was fitted to the Renault 4CV Grand Luxe, produced only in 1950.

=== 747 cc ===
In October 1950, the replaced the . The slightly lower displacement was obtained by slightly reducing the size of the bore from , while the stroke remained unchanged. This change was decided by the leaders of Renault in order to be able to use this extremely undersquare engine in competitions where it was necessary to stay below to homologate the car in its category. This new displacement offered six power levels, from SAE, all of 4 fiscal horsepower.

=== 782 cc ===
In 1971, the appeared with an increased bore, from , always with an unchanged stroke of . This engine was proposed in both variants developing . The less powerful one was mounted under the hood of the Renault 4L produced between 1971 and 1980, while the variant developing was used on the Renault 5 produced between 1972 and 1976.

=== 845 cc ===
The highest engine capacity of the Billancourt engine appeared in 1956 at the launch of the Renault Dauphine, one of the main models equipped with this engine; it displaces . The rear-engine version was codenamed 670. It also equipped the Renault 4 from 1964 and the Renault 6 base model; in these front-engined, front-wheel drive applications the engine was codenamed 800. The bore was increased to . The power ranged between SAE for standard (non-Gordini) engines.

The fourth and final version developed maximum power and torque at 2,500 rpm. This was made possible by machining the cylinder head, with new valves and valve seats, as well as improvements in engine cooling. It was fitted on the Renault 5L from 1977 to 1984. Later models were called B1B, reflecting Renault&#x27;s new engine numbering system.

=== 603 cc ===
This was the cheapest Billancourt engine to produce. The bore was reduced to for a total displacement of . The maximum power reached SAE, DIN at 4,800 rpm, while the maximum torque was . This engine was mounted only on the Renault 3 (1961–1962), an ultra-Spartan version of The Renault 4.

== Ventoux Engine ==
The &quot;sport&quot; version is called Ventoux engine, named after the Mont Ventoux Hill Climb.

=== 747 cc Ventoux ===
The sport variant of the engine, which equipped the Alpine A106 and the Renault 4 CV R1063, underwent major modifications which affected, among other things, the connecting rods (now more powerful and duralumin), the camshaft, the (larger) valves and the Solex carburetor. Significantly higher values were obtained, ranging from SAE nominal for a Renault 4 CV R1063 standard (up to SAE and more for the versions used in racing) to SAE for the engine used on the A106 (some were prepared at SAE). For this last application, the Solex twin-choke carburetor was preferred to a twin-choke Weber carburetor.

=== Ventoux Gordini ===
The more powerful versions were developed by Amédée Gordini from the original engine. The machining of the inclined valve seats allows for a greater range but leaving intact the camshaft spindle, improved cylinder head cooling, and the engine is fitted with a new Solex carburettor. This, in conjunction with the increase in compression ratio, results in a maximum power of SAE at 5,000 rpm with a maximum torque of at 3500 rpm. This engine made its debut in the fall of 1957, then, in 1959, it underwent further modifications and its power was increased to SAE. The &quot;Sorcerer&quot; then makes a small preparation, thus the Dauphine Gordini (type R1091) is born in 1957.

The power of the block increases to SAE and the top speed to thanks to a new cylinder head, increased compression ratio and the use of a carburetor, springs Harder valves and larger intake and exhaust ducts. The first modifications made by Amedée Gordini (cylinder head with vertical outlet) will not however be kept on the model of series for reasons of cost.

The engine will win three horses on the 1960 models. The Dauphine Gordini will appear in the catalog from the summer of 1957 to 1963 and reappear in 1965.

In 1960 and 1965, new modifications improved the torque. Then came a much more powerful version, obtained by a new camshaft, new valves, a Solex double body carburettor, and by increasing the compression ratio to 9.2:1. bringing the maximum power to SAE, DIN.

=== Ventoux 1093 ===
Renault called on Amédée Gordini to produce a supertuned version of the Renault Dauphine: The Dauphine 1093 (type R1093), a sporty derivative of the Dauphine which appeared at the end of 1961. The modifications mainly concerned the engine. It used pistons with convex heads (compression ratio increased to 9.2:1), a reversed Solex twin-choke carburetor type 32 PAIA 3, a special camshaft, double valve springs and Autobleu intake manifolds and exhaust. The sprockets were reinforced as well as the clutch. With a capacity of SAE, DIN, the car reached .

The 4th gear was modified compared to the box of the Dauphine Gordini. The original braking system was improved by the addition of cooling fins on the perimeter of the front drums. The suspension was that of the Dauphine type &quot;bad roads&quot; but with shorter springs without lowering the ground clearance. The 1093 was the only Dauphine to have been marketed in France with 12-volt electrical equipment similar to the export versions instead of the original 6 volts.

Externally, the 1093 was distinguished from the Dauphine Gordini by its large-diameter headlights borrowed from the US version, its body white cream &quot;Réjane&quot; having two blue strips glued in the axis of the vehicle and &quot;1093&quot; badging to the right rear as well as the right front wing.

Inside, an additional tachometer was fitted to the left of the speedometer graduated up to .

Despite its very sporty character for &quot;everyone&quot;, the 1093 series could not be competitive without having been prepared. The preparation consisted of modifying and polishing the existing mechanics because the new sports regulations in force as early as 1960 prohibited any increase in displacement as well as changes of parts. Ferry dealt with many of the 1093 Dauphine competitors who became &quot;1093 Enhanced&quot;.

Only 2,140 copies (plus an additional 8 pre-series cars) were produced in two series. The first consisted of 1,650 units for homologation purposes (1,500 copies minimum), with a second batch of 490 units, fitted with disc brakes and painted white gray &quot;Valois&quot;, built to meet additional customer demand. The 1093 is the most sought after of all the Dauphines. Today, it is estimated that around a hundred of 1093 have survived, half of which are still rolling.

In 1962, the Dauphine 1093 was seen at the Tour of Corsica Rally. However, its late launch and relatively modest performance improvements did not allow for a long sports career. The 1093 remains an engaging car that ensures the transition between the artisanal 4CV 1063 and the R8 Gordini that would revolutionize the car competition &quot;tourism series&quot;.

== Succession ==
In 1962, the Sierra engine, later renamed &quot;Cléon-Fonte engine&quot;, appeared on the Renault Floride S and the Renault 8. It innovated with its five-bearing crankshaft. It was a medium-displacement engine, not replacing the Billancourt engine which remained to power lower-range models. Over the years, cars became heavier and more efficient, forcing Renault to abandon the Billancourt engine and, as a result, the Cléon-Fonte engine came to be considered a small-displacement engine by 1980, when the Billancourt engine disappeared.

The Cléon-Fonte engine is not an evolution of the Billancourt engine but an entirely new engine designed by the engineer René Vuaillat. Both engines have a lateral camshaft and a chain or sprocket drive, and so a distant resemblance.

<doc id="1048768" wikidata="Q323483" url="?curid=1048768" title="Lee Greenwood">
<text>Melvin Lee Greenwood (born October 27, 1942) is an American country music singer. Active since 1962, he won a Grammy Award and he has charted 33 singles on the Hot Country Songs with seven singles reaching the number one. He has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide.

Greenwood is known for his patriotic signature song &quot;God Bless the U.S.A.,&quot; which was originally released in the spring of 1984 and became a popular song, especially among members of the Republican Party (of which Greenwood is a member). That summer, it was included in a film about President Ronald Reagan, the Republican presidential nominee, that was shown at the 1984 Republican National Convention. &quot;God Bless the U.S.A.&quot; gained prominence during the 1988 United States presidential election campaign, when Greenwood performed the song at the 1988 Republican National Convention and at rallies for the Republican nominee, George H. W. Bush. The song was also featured in television advertisements for Bush. It later became popular again during the Gulf War in 1991 and after the September 11 attacks (becoming his highest charting pop hit, reaching number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100), and again during the 2016, 2020 and 2024 presidential elections as President Donald Trump&#x27;s rally introduction track. 

His seven number-ones on the U.S. Hot Country Songs list in his career: &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Gonna Love You&quot;, &quot;Going, Going, Gone&quot;, &quot;Dixie Road&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Mind the Thorns (If You&#x27;re the Rose)&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Underestimate My Love For You&quot;, &quot;Hearts Aren&#x27;t Made to Break (They&#x27;re Made to Love)&quot;, and &quot;Mornin&#x27; Ride&quot;. His 1983 single &quot;I.O.U.&quot; was also a top-five hit on the adult contemporary charts, and a number 53 on the Billboard Hot 100.

==Early life==
Greenwood was born in 1942 in South Gate, California, a few miles south of Los Angeles. He has German, English, Irish, Scottish ancestry. His father joined the U.S. Navy after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and his mother was a piano player who had several jobs. After his parents separated, he grew up in Sacramento, on the farm of his maternal grandparents. At the age of seven, he started singing in church. 

Greenwood did not serve in the United States military despite the universal draft at the time. He has said that he was given a 3A deferment for family hardship due to having children at age 17. He eloped to Reno, Nevada, with his first wife, Edna Greenwood, in 1960.

==Career==


Greenwood founded his first band, The Apollos, in 1962. The band, which changed its name later to Lee Greenwood Affair, played mostly pop music and appeared mostly in casinos in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 1969, he joined the Chester Smith Band and had his first television appearance. A short time later, he worked with the country musician Del Reeves. A few records were recorded in Los Angeles with the Paramount label. After the band broke up in the 1970s, Greenwood moved back to Las Vegas, where he worked as a blackjack dealer during the day and as a singer at night.

In 1979, he was &quot;discovered&quot; in Reno, Nevada, by Larry McFaden, the bandleader and bassist for Mel Tillis. After making some demo tapes, Greenwood was signed in 1981 by the Nashville division of the MCA label (which had recently absorbed the Paramount label), and McFaden became his manager.

The first single, the Jan Crutchfield-penned &quot;It Turns Me Inside Out&quot;, made it to a spot in the top 20 of the country chart in 1981. The song had been written for Kenny Rogers, Rogers recorded a version but decided to pass on it due to the sheer volume of songs he had been offered to record at the time. &quot;Ring on Her Finger, Time on Her Hands&quot; landed him in the country top 10. Each song was marketed heavily, particularly in the South Florida market by MCA Account Service Representative, Brad Fitzgerald, among others.

Greenwood is known for writing and recording &quot;God Bless the U.S.A.&quot; in the early 1980s, and later &quot;God Bless You Canada&quot;. The song gained renewed popularity following the launch of in 1991, and again, 10 years later, following the September 11 attacks. &quot;God Bless the U.S.A.&quot; re-entered the top 20 of the country charts in late 2001. Since then, Greenwood has played across the US, at many public events and commemorations of the attacks.

The day before the inauguration of Donald Trump in 2017, Greenwood performed at the Make America Great! Welcome Celebration. &quot;God Bless the U.S.A.&quot; was used by Donald Trump as one of his campaign songs during the 2016 presidential election and the 2018 midterm elections, and was used again during the 2020 presidential election.

Greenwood performed for Marsha Blackburn after her victory in her Senate election.

On May 19, 2018, Lee Greenwood was awarded the Mississippi Music Project (MMP) Award for his lifelong contribution to the music industry. He was inducted into the MMP Hall of Fame by &quot;Commander&quot; Joseph W. Clark, an honor shared by Elvis Presley tribute musician David Fontana, reality TV star and erstwhile country singer Joe Exotic, and notable others. 

Greenwood made a surprise appearance at the 2024 RNC Convention on July 15, 2024, and performed &quot;God Bless the U.S.A&quot; while then former-President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican Presidential Nominee, entered the arena which served as Trump&#x27;s first appearance at a public event since surviving an assassination attempt two days prior.

==National Council on the Arts==
In September 2008, President George W. Bush nominated Greenwood to succeed Makoto Fujimura for a six-year term to the National Council on the Arts expiring in 2014. He was confirmed by the Senate via voice vote in October 2008. In 2015, President Barack Obama nominated Esperanza Spalding to succeed Greenwood; however, the nomination was not acted upon by the Senate, allowing Greenwood to continuing serving under Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump until the Senate confirmed a nominated successor. In June 2021, President Joe Biden nominated Kamilah Forbes to succeed Greenwood. In September 2021, Greenwood told Fox and Friends that the Biden administration sent him an email informing him that the president had already nominated his replacement on the National Council on the Arts and expressed his &quot;shock&quot; at being replaced. Forbes got confirmed by the Senate on February 17, 2022, via voice vote.

==Theater==
In 1995, Greenwood took a break from his touring schedule to spend more time with his family. In his time off, he elected to build a theater in Sevierville, Tennessee, and in April 1996, the Lee Greenwood Theater opened its doors. This gave Greenwood the opportunity to perform daily shows, in addition to being with his family. The theater operated for five seasons, and closed for Greenwood to continue touring. The former theater building is host to a church.

==The &quot;God Bless the USA&quot; Bible==
In May 2021, to commemorate the September 11 attacks, Greenwood published the &quot;God Bless the U.S.A. Bible&quot;. This edition of the Bible has the U.S. flag on its leather cover and includes the texts of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Pledge of Allegiance, and the chorus of &quot;God Bless the USA&quot; in Greenwood&#x27;s handwriting. These augmentations have sparked controversy among certain Christians, who argue that it violates Scriptural prohibitions, such as those contained in Deuteronomy 4:2 and Revelation 22:18, against &quot;add[ing] anything&quot; to &quot;the commands of the Lord your God.&quot; The text of the Bible was intended to be the New International Version, but Zondervan, the division of HarperCollins that owns the rights to the New International Version, withheld them rather than associate Christianity with U.S. nationalism, and it used the King James Version, which is in the public domain in the United States. It created further controversy in 2024 when former president Donald Trump promoted a new edition of it that later became known as printed in China.

==Family==
Greenwood is married to former Miss Tennessee USA Kimberly Payne, his fourth wife and fifth marriage. The former Miss Payne is 25 years his junior. They have two sons together, Dalton and Parker Greenwood. Previously he was married four times, the first two of them to Edna Greenwood, whom he divorced and remarried. The second was Melanie Cronk, and the third was Roberta Taylor. He has four children from his earlier marriages.
