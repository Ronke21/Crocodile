<text>Avenged Sevenfold (abbreviated as A7X) is an American heavy metal band from Huntington Beach, California, formed in 1999. The band&#x27;s current lineup consists of vocalist M. Shadows, rhythm guitarist Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist Synyster Gates, bassist Johnny Christ, and drummer Brooks Wackerman.

Avenged Sevenfold are known for their diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise. The band emerged with a metalcore sound on their debut album &quot;Sounding the Seventh Trumpet&quot; and largely continued this sound through their second album &quot;Waking the Fallen&quot;. The band&#x27;s style had evolved by their third album and first major label release, &quot;City of Evil&quot;, into a more traditional heavy metal style. The band continued to explore new sounds with its self-titled release and enjoyed continued mainstream success before their founding drummer, Jimmy &quot;The Rev&quot; Sullivan, died in 2009. Despite his death, Avenged Sevenfold continued on with the help of Dream Theater member Mike Portnoy, and released and toured in support of their fifth album &quot;Nightmare&quot; in 2010, which debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, their first number one debut.

In 2011, drummer Arin Ilejay joined the band on tours and recording. The band&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Hail to the King&quot;, which was released in 2013, marked the only Avenged Sevenfold album featuring Ilejay. It would feature a heavy metal and hard rock style, with it being written as a tribute to their influences. &quot;Hail to the King&quot; charted as number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the UK Albums chart, as well as the Finnish, Brazilian, Canadian, and Irish charts. Ilejay left the band in late 2014 and was replaced by former Bad Religion drummer Brooks Wackerman, but the lineup change was not announced to the public until 2015. The band then surprise-released their seventh studio album &quot;The Stage&quot; in October 2016, which debuted as number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in the US. &quot;The Stage&quot; is their first conceptual album and marked another stylistic change for the band, moving towards a progressive metal sound. The band released their eighth studio album, &quot;Life Is But a Dream...&quot;, a highly experimental record, in June 2023.

To date, Avenged Sevenfold have released eight studio albums, one live album/DVD, two compilation albums and eighteen singles and have sold over 8 million albums worldwide, and their records have received numerous certification awards, including five platinum album awards from their home country&#x27;s institution (RIAA). They have also created four original songs for the &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot; series, all of which were compiled together in the 2018 EP &quot;Black Reign&quot;. The band were ranked No. 47 on &quot;Loudwire&#x27;s&quot; list of Top 50 Metal Bands of All Time.

== History ==

=== Formation and &quot;Sounding the Seventh Trumpet&quot; (1999–2002) ===
Avenged Sevenfold was formed in 1999 in Huntington Beach, California by Matt Sanders, James Sullivan, Zachary Baker and Matt Wendt. Although they are not a religious band, Sanders came up with the name as a reference to the story of Cain and Abel from the Bible, which can be found in Genesis 4:24. All four members already had experience performing in bands, with Sanders being the vocalist and Wendt the bassist for the punk band Successful Failure, Baker playing guitar in the punk bands Society Down and MPA (short for Mad Porn Action/Addiction), and Sullivan being the drummer for the ska band Suburban Legends (formerly known as Bomb Squad).

Avenged Sevenfold&#x27;s first creative output was a three-song-demo recorded in October 1999 at the A-Room Studios in Orange County, California. The band played their first show at the Walnut, California City Hall on February 11, 2000. Around this time, they were asked by Sadistic Records to contribute to two compilations, so the band recorded two new songs and released them along with the previously recorded songs on a second demo. They sent this demo to the Belgian label Good Life Recordings and were subsequently signed. Afterwards, the band participated in another two compilation albums, their label&#x27;s &quot;GoodLife 4&quot; and Novocaine Records&#x27; &quot;Scrape III&quot; compilations. Around this time, Matt Wendt left for college and Justin Meacham, the previous bassist of Suburban Legends, joined Avenged Sevenfold. In late 2000, the foursome took on their initial stage names – M. Shadows, Zacky Vengeance, Justin Sane and The Rev – and recorded their debut album, &quot;Sounding the Seventh Trumpet&quot;. In early 2001, lead guitarist and old friend Synyster Gates joined the band and they re-recorded the introductory track &quot;To End the Rapture&quot; for the album&#x27;s lead-single/EP, &quot;Warmness on the Soul&quot;, released in April 2001. Although their debut album&#x27;s release was initially planned for the same month, it was pushed back multiple times and eventually released on July 24, 2001, on Good Life Recordings.

Around August 2001, Meacham attempted suicide by drinking excessive amounts of cough syrup. This event was the reason for Avenged Sevenfold to join the Take Action Tour in 2003. During Meacham&#x27;s hospitalization, he remained in poor condition and had to leave the band. In an interview, lead singer M. Shadows said of Meacham that &quot;he perma-fried his brain and was in a mental institution for a long time, and when you have someone in your band who does that, it ruins everything that&#x27;s going on all around you, and it makes you want to do something to prevent it from happening to other people.&quot; His replacement was Frank Melcom, stage name Dameon Ash, who performed with the band for the following months, but does not appear on any releases.

On January 18, 2002, Avenged Sevenfold left Good Life Recordings and signed with Hopeless Records. They re-released their debut album on March 19 and also appeared on the &quot;Hopelessly Devoted To You Vol. 4&quot; sampler in April. The band started to receive recognition, performing with bands such as Mushroomhead and Shadows Fall. They spent the year touring in support of their debut album and participated in the Vans Warped Tour. In September, Dameon Ash left Avenged Sevenfold and their current bassist Johnny Christ joined them, completing their best known line-up.

=== &quot;Waking the Fallen&quot; and &quot;City of Evil&quot; (2003–2005) ===

Having found a new bassist, the group released their second studio album titled &quot;Waking the Fallen&quot; on Hopeless Records in August 2003. The album featured a more refined and mature sound production in comparison to their previous album. The band received profiles in &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, and again played on the Vans Warped and Take Action tours. Shortly after the release of &quot;Waking the Fallen&quot;, Avenged Sevenfold left Hopeless Records and were officially signed to Warner Bros. Records on November 1, 2003. In 2004, Avenged Sevenfold toured again on the Vans Warped Tour and recorded a video for their song &quot;Unholy Confessions&quot; which went into rotation on MTV2&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;.

&quot;City of Evil&quot;, the band&#x27;s third album and major label debut, was released on June 6, 2005, and debuted at No. 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling over 30,000 copies in its first week of release. It utilized a more classic metal sound than Avenged Sevenfold&#x27;s previous albums, which had been grouped into the metalcore genre. The album is also notable for the absence of screamed and growled vocals; M. Shadows worked with vocal coach Ron Anderson—whose clients have included Axl Rose and Chris Cornell—for months before the album&#x27;s release to achieve a sound that had &quot;grit while still having the tone&quot;. The album received positive reviews from several magazines and websites and is credited for propelling the band into international popularity.

=== &quot;Avenged Sevenfold&quot; (2006–2008) ===

After playing Ozzfest in 2006, Avenged Sevenfold memorably beat out R&amp;B Singers Rihanna and Chris Brown, Panic! at the Disco, Angels &amp; Airwaves and James Blunt for the title of Best New Artist at the MTV Video Music Awards, thanks in part to their &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;-inspired song &quot;Bat Country.&quot; They returned to the Vans Warped Tour, this time headlining and then continued on their own &quot;Cities of Evil Tour.&quot; In addition, their lead single &quot;Bat Country&quot; reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Charts, No.6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Charts and the accompanying video made it to No. 1 on MTV&#x27;s Total Request Live. Propelled by this success, the album sold well and became Avenged Sevenfold&#x27;s first Gold record. It was later certified platinum in August 2009.
Avenged Sevenfold was invited to join Ozzfest tour on the main stage, alongside other well known rock/heavy metal acts such as DragonForce, Lacuna Coil, Hatebreed, Disturbed and System of a Down for the first time in 2006. That same year they also completed a worldwide tour, including the US, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. After a sixteen-month promotion of &quot;City of Evil&quot;, the band announced that they were cancelling their Fall 2006 tour to record new music. In the interim, the band released their first DVD titled &quot;All Excess&quot; on July 17, 2007. &quot;All Excess&quot;, which debuted as the No. 1 DVD in the US, included live performances and backstage footage that spanned the band&#x27;s eight-year career. Two tribute albums, &quot;Strung Out on Avenged Sevenfold: Bat Wings and Broken Strings&quot; and &quot;Strung Out on Avenged Sevenfold: The String Tribute&quot; were also released in October 2007.

On October 30, 2007, Avenged Sevenfold released their self-titled album, the band&#x27;s fourth studio album. It debuted at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with over 90,000 copies sold. Two singles, &quot;Critical Acclaim&quot; and &quot;Almost Easy&quot; were released prior to the album&#x27;s debut. In December 2007, an animated video was made for &quot;A Little Piece of Heaven&quot;. Due to the song&#x27;s controversial subject matter, however, Warner Brothers only released it to registered MVI users over the internet. The third single, &quot;Afterlife&quot; and its video was released in January 2008. Their fourth single, &quot;Dear God&quot;, was released on June 15, 2008. Although critical reception was generally mixed the self-titled album went on to sell over 500,000 copies and was awarded &quot;Album of the Year&quot; at the Kerrang! Awards.

Avenged Sevenfold headlined the 2008 Taste of Chaos tour with Atreyu, Bullet for My Valentine, Blessthefall and Idiot Pilot. Footage from their last show in Long Beach was used for the band&#x27;s next release, &quot;Live in the LBC &amp; Diamonds in the Rough&quot;, released on September 16, 2008. Its content includes live DVD from their performance at Long Beach, and a CD containing B-sides from &quot;Avenged Sevenfold&quot;, and other rarities, such as covers from Pantera&#x27;s &quot;Walk&quot; and Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;Flash of the Blade&quot;.

=== Death of The Rev and &quot;Nightmare&quot; (2009–2011) ===

In January 2009, M. Shadows confirmed that the band was writing the follow-up to their self-titled fourth album within the upcoming months. They also played at Rock on the Range, from May 16–17, 2009. On April 16, they performed a version of Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot; onstage with Slash, at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles. On December 28, 2009, the band&#x27;s drummer James &quot;The Rev&quot; Sullivan was found dead at his home at the age of 28. Autopsy results were inconclusive, but on June 9, 2010, the cause of death was revealed to have been an &quot;acute polydrug intoxication due to combined effects of Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, Diazepam/Nordiazepam and ethanol&quot;. In a statement by the band, they expressed their grief over the death of The Rev and later posted a message from Sullivan&#x27;s family which expressed their gratitude to his fans for their support. The band members admitted in a number of interviews that they considered disbanding at this point in time. On February 17, 2010, Avenged Sevenfold stated that they had entered the studio, along with Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy, to drum for the album, in place of The Rev.
The single &quot;Nightmare&quot; was digitally released on May 18, 2010. The song was leaked on May 6, 2010, on Amazon.com, but was removed soon after. Mixing for the album had been completed in New York City, and &quot;Nightmare&quot; was finally released on July 27, 2010, in the United States. It met with mixed to positive reviews from music critics but was well received by the fans. &quot;Nightmare&quot; beat sales projections easily, debuting at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with sales of 163,000 units in its first week. After finishing recording, in December, Portnoy and the band posted simultaneous statements on their websites stating that he would not be their replacement for The Rev. However, Portnoy did travel with the band overseas in December 2010 for three shows in Iraq and Kuwait sponsored by the USO. They played for U.S. Soldiers at Camp Adder, Camp Beuhring, and Balad Air Base. On January 20, 2011, Avenged Sevenfold announced via Facebook that former Confide drummer Arin Ilejay would begin touring with them that year. He was not yet considered a full-time member at this point.

Avenged Sevenfold performed at the Rock am Ring and Rock im Park festivals on June 3–5, 2011 alongside other bands such as Alter Bridge, System of a Down, and In Flames. In April 2011, the band headlined the Golden God Awards held by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;. The same night the band won three awards for &quot;Best Vocalist&quot; (M. Shadows), &quot;Epiphone Best Guitarist(s)&quot; (Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance), and &quot;Affliction&#x27;s Album of The Year&quot; for &quot;Nightmare&quot;, while Mike Portnoy won the award for &quot;Drum Workshop&#x27;s Best Drummer&quot; for his work on the album.

Avenged Sevenfold headlined the 2011 Uproar Festival with supporting acts Three Days Grace, Seether, Bullet for My Valentine, Escape the Fate, among others. In November and December 2011, the band went on their &quot;Buried Alive&quot; tour with supporting acts Hollywood Undead, Asking Alexandria, and Black Veil Brides.

=== &quot;Hail to the King&quot; and &quot;Waking the Fallen: Resurrected&quot; (2012–2014) ===
On April 11, 2012, Avenged Sevenfold won the award for &quot;Best Live Band&quot; and &quot;Most Dedicated Fans&quot; at the &quot;Revolver&quot; Golden Gods awards.
The band toured through Asia into April and early May, and played at the Orion Music + More, Festival on June 23 and 24 in Atlantic City, New Jersey alongside Metallica and Cage the Elephant among many others.
On September 24, 2012, Avenged Sevenfold released a new song, titled &quot;Carry On&quot;; it was featured in the video game &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops II&quot;. On November 15, 2012, vocalist M. Shadows said that the band had been working on a new album since the recording of &quot;Carry On&quot; in August 2012. The band began recording material for the album in January 2013. The band then started streaming snippets of the album in May 2013 on their new radio app. There, Arin Ilejay was confirmed as an official band member and replacement of deceased The Rev. M. Shadows said that the album would sound more blues rock-influenced and more like classic rock/metal like Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin.

The band was confirmed to play at the 2013 Rock in Rio festival on September 22, 2013. On May 24, 2013, the band have announced dates for their European tour with Five Finger Death Punch and Device serving as their support bands.

The album, entitled &quot;Hail to the King&quot;, was released on August 23, 2013. This is the first Avenged Sevenfold album without any musical contributions from late drummer, The Rev. The album&#x27;s lead single and title track was released on July 15, 2013. &quot;Hail to the King&quot; charted as No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the UK albums chart, as well as the Finnish, Brazilian, Canadian, and Irish charts, and was commercially and critically acclaimed.

The reissue charted No. 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

=== Drummer change and &quot;The Stage&quot; (2015–2017) ===
In October 2014, M. Shadows confirmed that the band would begin writing their seventh album during mid-2015.

In July 2015, the band announced on their website that they would part ways with drummer Arin Ilejay, due to &quot;creative differences&quot;. In October 2015, the band announced on their website that they had been working with a new drummer for over a year, making sure that it was a good fit before making sudden changes. On October 21, in an interview with &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine, guitarist Zacky Vengeance revealed that the band had been working on the new album for the past couple of months and that a couple of songs had already been completely written. On November 4, 2015, the band announced that Brooks Wackerman would replace Arin Ilejay as the drummer for Avenged Sevenfold. In an interview with &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine on December 3, guitarist Zacky Vengeance said that the new album went in all sorts of aggressive and melodic directions and described it as very &quot;aggro&quot;.

On January 14, 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that Avenged Sevenfold had been sued by Warner Bros. for trying to leave the label. The band later released a statement clarifying that they wanted to leave because a majority of the executives who helped sign the band to Warner Bros were no longer at the label. They also revealed that the band was going to be entering the studio to record their new album very soon, intending to release it later in 2016. On March 31, the band posted a teaser of their upcoming album on their website.

On August 18, 2016, the band performed a free live show for 1500 people in Minnesota, marking it the first live performance with new drummer Brooks Wackerman. The band was announced as support for Metallica with Volbeat in the U.S. Bank Stadium on August 20, 2016, making it the first ever rock show in the stadium. The band was announced as a headliner of Monster Energy Rock Allegiance 2016, along with Alice in Chains, Slayer, The Offspring, Breaking Benjamin and others.

After that, Deathbat also started appearing in Berlin, Toronto and Paris, indicating a release of the new album. On October 12, Chris Jericho posted an Instagram photo of the Deathbat logo with a date 12/9/16 underneath it. He then revealed the supposed title of the album, &quot;Voltaic Oceans&quot;, It was later revealed that the new album would actually be called &quot;The Stage&quot;, a concept album about artificial intelligence, which was released on October 28, 2016, via Capitol Records. The album was released to generally favorable reviews, and the band decided to make a unique stage production for it, hiring Cirque du Soleil directors for its making.

The band also announced a series of 2017 US headlining summer shows of &quot;The Stage World Tour&quot;, with Volbeat, Motionless in White, and A Day to Remember as special guests across various dates.

On December 22, 2017, the band released a deluxe edition of &quot;The Stage&quot; that included one new original track, six cover songs, and four live tracks from their European tour earlier that year.

In a December 2017 interview with Billboard, M. Shadows revealed that the band are planning &quot;a big US summer 2018 tour&quot;, and that the band would start working on the follow-up to &quot;The Stage&quot; in late 2018. &quot;End of the World&quot; tour with Prophets of Rage was later announced for summer 2018. The band was also announced as one of the headliners of 2018&#x27;s Rock on the Range and Download Festival, in addition to appearing at Hellfest, Graspop Metal Meeting, Rock am Ring and Rock im Park the same year. Due to a blood blister forming in M. Shadows&#x27; throat, the band cancelled remaining dates from their summer tour with Prophets of Rage.

Avenged Sevenfold was nominated at 60th Annual Grammy Awards in &quot;Best Rock Song&quot; category for &quot;The Stage&quot;.

The band released a single titled &quot;Mad Hatter&quot; in September 2018, which was made specifically for the video game &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops 4&quot;. It would later be a part of the &quot;Black Reign&quot; EP released later that month, which comprises all four of the songs Avenged Sevenfold made for the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; franchise.

=== &quot;Life Is But a Dream...&quot; (2018–present) ===
In a December 2017 interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, M. Shadows revealed that the band are planning &quot;a big US summer 2018 tour&quot;, and that the band would start working on the follow-up to &quot;The Stage&quot; in late 2018. Bassist Johnny Christ in a May 2018 interview confirmed that the band is currently getting ideas and writing in their own studios to start the next record in September or October 2018.

In September 2018, Synyster Gates revealed in an interview with Loudwire that the band has started working on their eighth studio album, saying &quot;It&#x27;s still early on, but we&#x27;re working on a bunch of stuff&quot;. In March 2019, Zacky Vengeance stated the band would take the rest of the year off tour to concentrate on the upcoming album, saying the band is really focused on the new material. In January 2020, Avenged Sevenfold released &quot;Set Me Free&quot;, an unreleased song recorded during the &quot;Hail to the King&quot; recording sessions. They also announced that the song would be included in a remastered re-release of &quot;Live in the LBC &amp; Diamonds in the Rough&quot;, released on March 6. A limited edition clear vinyl of &quot;Diamonds in the Rough&quot; was also released.

On March 14, 2023, after several days of teaser videos, the band released the first single, &quot;Nobody&quot;, along with a music video. At the same time, they officially announced that their eighth studio album, &quot;Life Is But a Dream...&quot;, was set for release on June 2, 2023 while also revealed the album cover and the track list.

== Musical style and influences ==
Members of Avenged Sevenfold cite In Flames, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Slayer, Mr. Bungle, Elton John, Leonard Cohen, At the Gates, Helloween, Dream Theater, Pennywise, NOFX, Pantera, Def Leppard, Guns N&#x27; Roses, the Beatles, Anthrax, Testament, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and the Rolling Stones as influences.

Avenged Sevenfold&#x27;s musical style has consistently evolved throughout the duration of the band&#x27;s career. As a result, the band has been categorized under several genres of heavy and extreme music, primarily heavy metal, alternative metal, hard rock, and progressive metal (most notably in their album &quot;The Stage&quot;). The band&#x27;s initial style in their first two albums has been primarily categorized as metalcore. The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Sounding the Seventh Trumpet&quot;, while consisting almost entirely of a hardcore or metalcore sound, has several deviations from this genre, most notably in &quot;Warmness on the Soul&quot;, which is a piano ballad. On &quot;Waking the Fallen&quot;, the band displayed a metalcore style once more, but added more clean singing and leaned a bit more towards metal and bit less close to hardcore. In the band&#x27;s DVD &quot;All Excess&quot;, producer Andrew Murdock explained this transition: &quot;When I met the band after &quot;Sounding the Seventh Trumpet&quot; had come out before they had recorded &quot;Waking the Fallen&quot;, M. Shadows said to me &#x27;This record is screaming. The record we want to make is going to be half-screaming half-singing. I don&#x27;t want to scream anymore. And the record after that is going to be all singing&#x27;.&quot;

On Avenged Sevenfold&#x27;s third album &quot;City of Evil&quot;, the band chose to outright abandon the metalcore genre, creating a sound consistent with hard rock, heavy metal, and progressive metal. Avenged Sevenfold&#x27;s self-titled album experiments with an even wider array of musical genres than that from &quot;City of Evil&quot;, most notably in &quot;Dear God&quot;, which shows a country style and &quot;A Little Piece of Heaven&quot;, which is circled within the influence of Broadway show tunes, using primarily brass instruments and stringed orchestra to take over most of the role of the lead and rhythm guitar. &quot;Nightmare&quot; contains further deviations, including a piano ballad called &quot;Fiction&quot;, progressive metal-oriented track &quot;Save Me&quot; and a heavy metal sound with extreme vocals and heavier instrumentation on &quot;God Hates Us&quot;. The band&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Hail to the King&quot; shows more of a classic metal sound and a riff-oriented approach. On their seventh album &quot;The Stage&quot;, the band explores further into progressive metal, blending it with elements of thrash metal. Their eighth album, &quot;Life Is But a Dream...&quot; shows the band taking on more of an avant-garde metal sound.

Avenged Sevenfold has been criticized for &quot;not being metal enough&quot;. In response to this, vocalist M. Shadows said: &quot;we play music for the sake of music, not so that we can be labeled a metal band. That&#x27;s like telling us we aren&#x27;t punk enough. Who cares?&quot; Avenged Sevenfold is one of the notable acts of the new wave of American heavy metal.

<doc id="1047975" wikidata="Q1850272" url="?curid=1047975" title="Sadus">
<text>Sadus is an American thrash metal band from Antioch, California, active from 1985 to 2015, and reunited in 2017. Originally a quartet, the band&#x27;s sound fuses thrash metal with death metal, featuring highly technical musicianship. They are known for the unique death growl of vocalist Darren Travis, and bassist Steve Di Giorgio. During their career, Sadus has released six studio albums, one compilation album and four demos, and has undergone a few lineup changes, with guitarist Darren Travis as the only constant member of the band.

== History ==
=== Formation, early albums and split with Rob Moore (1985–1993) ===
Sadus was formed in 1985 by vocalist Darren Travis, guitarist Rob Moore, bassist Steve Di Giorgio and drummer Jon Allen. A year later, the band would release their demo tape &quot;D.T.P. (Death to Posers)&quot;. These sessions led directly to the inclusion of two tracks on the 1987 &quot;Raging Death&quot; compilation album. Quick to capitalize on this achievement Sadus stuck their hands in their pockets to self finance the debut album pulling in Metal Church guitarist John Marshall as producer. The pace of progress was quickened as a deal with label Roadrunner Records was secured resulting in a further album &quot;Swallowed in Black&quot; and touring with the likes of Sepultura and Obituary.

Sadus was put on hold in 1991 as Di Giorgio opted to assist Death for their &quot;Human&quot; album. With this added exposure Roadrunner re-released the &quot;Illusions&quot; debut retitled &quot;Chemical Exposure&quot; as Sadus regrouped for a summer American tour opening for Morbid Angel. Although a further album for Roadrunner, 1992&#x27;s &quot;A Vision of Misery&quot;, resulted in a European headline tour, Sadus found itself labelless upon their return. Further setbacks occurred when Di Giorgio was enticed back to Death for the &quot;Individual Thought Patterns&quot; album and a subsequent year-long bout of touring. Di Giorgio was to return for club shows with Sadus but before any momentum could be gained Moore bailed out.

=== Sadus as a trio, &quot;Elements of Anger&quot; and hiatus (1993–2005) ===
Instead of replacing Moore, Sadus continued as a trio crafting the Scott Burns produced &quot;Elements of Anger&quot; in 1997. The in demand Di Giorgio, along with drummer Jon Allen, also operated a side project Dragonheart (later Dragonlord) with former Vicious Rumours and present day Testament guitarist Steve Smyth and his fellow Testament six-stringer Eric Peterson. Di Giorgio teamed up with Iced Earth in late 2000. News during the summer of 2002 would reveal that frontman Darren Travis and bassist Steve Di Giorgio were embarking on another all star union billed as Suicide Shift. The project allied the Sadus pairing with Testament vocalist Chuck Billy as well as drummer Per Moller Jensen of The Haunted and guest guitar from the much travelled, Death and Cancer guitarist James Murphy. The Hammerheart label would put the band&#x27;s original &quot;Death To Posers&quot; 1986 demo onto CD in 2003, adding a brace of cuts from a 1988 session, &quot;Certain Death&quot;, as a bonus.

Sadus announced they were to partner up with fellow thrash veterans Nasty Savage and high-profile Finnish act Finntroll for European mainland dates in December. However, just days after the official press release confirming these shows the band withdrew as drummer Jon Allen&#x27;s commitments to his 11-year-old daughter, who had just undergone open heart surgery, took precedence.

Despite Steve Di Giorgio commitments in 2004 to Testament, the band did increase activity that year. In April the group toured Europe, taking in shows in Greece, Italy, Sweden and appearing at Norway&#x27;s Inferno Metal Festival in Oslo. Di Giorgio then took time out to record with Artension then hit the European festival circuit with Testament. Gigs in August marked a first for Sadus as they toured Chile alongside Torturer whilst on South American dates. New Sadus material would be laid down throughout September and October before Di Giorgio joined the ranks of Sebastian Bach&#x27;s band for further European touring in December. The bassist would also be announced as a contributor to recordings for Norwegian act Scariot in early 2005.

=== &quot;Out for Blood&quot; and another hiatus (2006–2016) ===
Sadus, together with producer Brage Finstad, entered Trident Studios in Pacheco, California to record their fifth album for a late summer 2006 release via Mascot Records. In March 2006 Jon Allen manned the drum kit for live work with Testament. That same month found Di Giorgio involving himself in a studio collaboration with singer Björn Strid, of Soilwork, Terror 2000 and Coldseed, Glen Alvelais from Forbidden, Testament and LD/50 and Jeremy Colson of the Steve Vai band, Marty Friedman, Michael Schenker, Apartment 26, Dali&#x27;S Dilemma and LD/50 repute.

On November 18 the band appeared at the Monterrey Metal Fest event at the Auditorio Coca-Cola in Mexico alongside Blind Guardian, Cathedral, U.D.O., Edguy, Obituary, Deicide, Leaves&#x27; Eyes, Bludgeon, Vainglory, Hydrogyn and Joe Stump&#x27;s Reign of Terror. Sadus was announced as teaming up with Destruction, Hirax and Municipal Waste for a North American tour throughout January and February 2007. However, the group dropped off these dates as new year broke. Sadus lined up the South American &#x27;Fuera Por Sangre&#x27; dates hitting Venezuela, Ecuador and Colombia in April prior to supporting Obituary in Mexico during May. In 2009 Sadus veterans Jon Allen and Steve Di Giorgio were noted as founder members of Futures End. Di Giorgio rejoined Testament in 2014 and played on their 2016 album &quot;Brotherhood of the Snake&quot;.

=== Reunion (2017–present) ===
On August 20, 2017, Darren Travis confirmed via Facebook that Sadus would be releasing new material. In October of that year, Travis posted two videos from the studio teasing new music from the band. Former bassist Steve Di Giorgio was not part of the reunion. In November 2017, Travis told Blabbermouth.net: &quot;I have been working on new material for quite sometime with drummer Jon Allen in his personal studio in Texas. I am going to record again in Trident Studios in the next few weeks for two/three new tracks. Guitars and voice. Teasers will be posted on Facebook via YouTube links. Then full songs soon.&quot;

On November 18, 2022, Sadus announced that they had signed a deal with Nuclear Blast Records for the 2023 release of their new album, and on the same day, they released their first song in 16 years called &quot;It&#x27;s the Sickness&quot;. The band&#x27;s sixth studio album, and their first in 17 years, &quot;The Shadow Inside&quot; was released on November 17, 2023.

On December 4, 2024, Allen was fired from the band following allegations and leaked video footage of abuse toward Allen&#x27;s significant other, who was hooked up to a dialysis machine. The video also appeared to show his significant other&#x27;s son unsuccessfully attempting to intervene. Travis released a statement saying, &quot;Upon recent allegations of misconduct.. Sadus will be parting ways with Jon Allen.. I do not condone any type of malicious behavior towards any person.&quot; Allen&#x27;s firing leaves Travis as the only remaining original member left in Sadus. The allegations also resulted in the band getting dropped from both Nuclear Blast and a then-ongoing European tour with Obituary.

<text>Port Isaac () is a small fishing village on the Atlantic coast of north Cornwall, England, in the United Kingdom. The nearest towns are Wadebridge and Camelford, each ten miles (16 km) away. A nearby hamlet, Port Gaverne, is sometimes considered to be part of Port Isaac. The meaning of the village&#x27;s Cornish name, &quot;Porthysek&quot;, is &quot;corn port&quot;, indicating a trade in corn from the arable inland district.

From 2004 to 2022, the village served as the backdrop to the ITV television series &quot;Doc Martin&quot;. It also is home to the sea-shanty singing group Fisherman&#x27;s Friends.

==History==

The origins of Port Isaac are likely Celtic and the development of the village can be roughly divided into three phases. Through the Middle Ages and up to the coming of the railways, Port Isaac was a thriving port serving the area inland. During the Tudor period the harbour was dredged, a good illustration of its importance. Once goods from locations further inland were better served by the North Cornwall Railway, the economy of the port relied on pilchard fishing, probably a centuries-old industry. However the pilchard shoals began to decline, and after World War I tourism became the mainstay of the economy.

==Port==
Port Isaac&#x27;s pier was constructed during the reign of Henry VIII. A 1937 history said, &quot;...Tudor pier and breakwater have now yielded to a strong new sea-wall balanced by an arm on the opposite side of the cove, and we do not doubt that the fishermen sleep more soundly in their beds on stormy nights.&quot; The village centre dates from the 18th and 19th centuries, from a time when its prosperity was tied to local coastal freight and fishing. Apart from the corn that gave the town its name, the port handled cargoes of coal, wood, stone, ores, limestone, salt, pottery and heavy goods which were conveyed along its narrow streets. Small coastal sailing vessels were built below Roscarrock Hill.

The pilchard fishery began here before the 16th century and in 1850 there were 49 registered fishing boats and four fish cellars. Fishermen still work from the Platt, landing their catches of fish, crab and lobsters. The historic core of the village was designated a Conservation Area in 1971 and North Cornwall District Council reviewed this in 2008 with the endorsement of a detailed Port Isaac Conservation Area Appraisal document and a related Conservation Area Management Plan. The village has around 90 listed buildings (all Grade II).
==Lifeboat==

A Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station was opened at Port Isaac in 1869. The &quot;Richard and Sarah&quot; was kept in a boat house on Fore Street, from where it had to be taken through the narrow streets of the village on a carriage to be launched. A new lifeboat station was built in 1927 next to the beach but this closed in 1933. An Inshore Lifeboat has been stationed at Port Isaac from 1967. Since 1993 it has been kept in the lifeboat station built in 1927; the original lifeboat station is now a shop. Port Isaac&#x27;s lifeboat has been the D-class &quot;Copeland Bell&quot; since 2009.

==Transport==
The first link from Port Isaac to the railways was started by John Prout, who ran a service to Bodmin Road station, more than distant, from 1861. The railways came much closer when the North Cornwall Railway opened the section from Delabole to Wadebridge in 1895, which included a station at Port Isaac Road from the village. Produce from the area, including fish, flowers and fruit, was transported through the steep and narrow lanes to the station, with 150 tons of fish being transported by cart for onward shipment in 1897.

The horse-drawn connection to the railway was replaced by a motor bus in 1920, and when this service was taken over by the Southern National Omnibus Company in 1930, Prouts merged the passenger service into the freight cartage service that they ran for the Southern Railway. The Okehampton to Wadebridge railway line closed in 1966. Due to the sparsely populated area, ticket sales were always low: 4,500 annually in 1928, dropping to less than 2,000 in 1936; freight dropped in a similar way over the same period.

The village was served by Western Greyhound&#x27;s 584 bus service from Wadebridge to Camelford, which ran five times daily in each direction, except for Sundays. A summer Sunday service provided up to four return journeys. 

In 1997, FirstGroup route 96 provided five buses each way, between Wadebridge and Bude.

Newquay Cornwall Airport, located in Newquay, is the closest airport to the village.

In 2016, a local taxi service – Port Isaac Shuttle Service – was asked to change the way that it displayed its name after Cornwall Council deemed it offended good taste.

==Recreation and tourism==
Port Isaac is located on the South West Coast Path, and apart from people walking the long National Trail there are shorter walks in the area using this path as part of their route.

There is an alley in Port Isaac, known as Temple Bar, that is particularly narrow. In the 1978 edition of &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, it was dubbed the world&#x27;s narrowest thoroughfare. Locals refer to it as Squeeze-belly Alley.

==Places of worship==
The church of St Peter was built as a chapel-of-ease in the parish of St Endellion in 1882–84; Port Isaac became a separate parish in 1913, though more recently it has returned to St Endellion parish. The church is built of granite and stone and the style adopted was Early English.
The village has had three Nonconformist places of worship: the oldest was a Quaker meeting house, 1806; from 1832 it was used by the Baptists but was converted to a dwelling house in 1871. The United Methodist chapel (1846) and the Wesleyan Methodist chapel are both now closed. The nearest Roman Catholic church is in Tintagel.

==Cornish wrestling==
Cornish wrestling tournaments, for prizes, were held in Port Isaac at the football field.

<doc id="1047978" wikidata="Q730758" url="?curid=1047978" title="Control Denied">
<text>Control Denied was a progressive metal band formed by death metal musician and Death co-founder Chuck Schuldiner.

==History==
===Background and origins===
Schuldiner had spoken about the possibility of ending Death and forming a more melodic band after he returned from Europe following the 1992 tour, as he was fed up with it, though he decided that he did not want to &quot;get off track&quot; with Death and instead put the idea &quot;on hold&quot;. Schuldiner mentioned the general idea of teaming up with a Rob Halford-esque singer in a September 1993 interview with Guitar School and expanded on it in a Terrorizer interview with Borivoj Krgin that same year, explaining that it would allow him to do &quot;things that ... can&#x27;t be totally expressed through this band&quot;. He would discuss the idea further in multiple 1995 interviews, including Guitar World, the Italian magazine Metal Shock and the Dutch magazine Watt mentioning Ronnie James Dio as another example of the type of singer he would like to partner with. He had already started working on Control Denied riffs by the time Death was touring in Japan for the album Symbolic, which took place in September 1995. Death drummer Gene Hoglan has stated that after the Symbolic tour, Schuldiner broke up Death as he was unhappy with Roadrunner Records, which had released the album.

B.C Richards joined the band in 1995 as vocalist, though he temporarily left the same year to focus on Wicked Ways. Schuldiner attempted to get Andy LaRocque as a lead guitarist, but the lack of a label hindered it. Drummer Chris Williams also joined around this time; Williams recruited Shannon Hamm on guitar and Scott Clendenin on bass. By 1996, Richards had rejoined; the following year he had left the band again, while Clendenin was replaced by Brian Benson. The name of the album at the time was &quot;The Moment of Clarity&quot;; other tracks from the album included What If and Cut Down to Size. Psycho Scream guitarist Jim Dofka had sent Schuldiner demo material and was interested in joining Control Denied alongside his bandmate, singer Tim Aymar. However, Schuldiner had already selected Hamm as the guitarist. After a brief audition, and demo, (which included the tracks What If, Believe and Cut Down), Aymar was chosen as the new singer, while Rob Halford of Judas Priest was also in the running. Earlier, Warrel Dane of Nevermore was almost selected as the singer, though the scheduling did not work out as Dane was dedicated to Nevermore and didn&#x27;t have the time. Williams left the band as he couldn&#x27;t &quot;hang around waiting&quot; any longer and went on to form Beyond Unknown.

===The Fragile Art of Existence===

Schuldiner signed with the record label Nuclear Blast in 1997, though the label required that another Death album be released before a Control Denied album could be issued. This led to the release of Death&#x27;s &quot;The Sound of Perseverance&quot; in 1998. Though Clendenin was expected to be on the debut Control Denied album and it was announced in early April that the recording was completed by the TSOP lineup (with the addition of Aymar), Schuldiner let the bassist go later in April and brought on DiGiorgio. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Fragile Art of Existence&quot;, was released in 1999. &quot;The Fragile Art of Existence&quot; was reissued in October 2010 by Relapse Records in a 2-disc standard format, with one hour of bonus material, and a 3-disc deluxe version, with two hours of bonus material.

===When Man and Machine Collide===
Schuldiner completed writing the last song for the second Control Denied album in March of 2000 and signed with Hammerheart Records in December of 2000.

The second album (which began to be recorded at Morrisound with Jim Morris under the initial title of &quot;When Hate Strikes Down&quot;, but which was later tentatively titled &quot;When Man and Machine Collide)&quot;, was partly recorded in November 2000. According to an interview with Hamm originally done in the Tampa Metal Music Examiner, Schuldiner and Christy had completed their tracks, while Hamm recorded three of his tracks before the funds were diverted to pay for Schuldiner&#x27;s medical bills. The death of Schuldiner in 2001 put the recordings on hold. Remaining band members had expressed a wish to complete and release the material. However, there existed a longstanding legal dispute over the rights of the material with Hammerheart Records, further postponing the completion and release of the album.

Schuldiner&#x27;s mother, Jane, affirmed in January 2003 that the album would be released. Hammerheart indicated in a 2003 press release that it would release the &quot;incomplete recordings&quot;, to which Schuldiner responded that it would be &quot;sacrilege.&quot; Schuldiner initially announced in March 2004 that they would be uploaded and made available for free download. The following month, she indicated that rather than release the rehearsal tracks, the entire completed album should be released instead. Part of these incomplete recordings were released without authorization on the &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; album, which was announced as the title by Karmageddon Media in March 2004. Schuldiner estate lawyer and Death manager Eric Greif settled all matters with the label by 2009, allowing for the possibility of completing the album.

On December 4, 2010, Aymar released a statement saying that plans were being made to record and release the album, stating that Jim Morris of Morrisound Studios (with whom Chuck Schuldiner recorded several albums during his career) had been in contact with Greif to begin planning and booking studio time to record the remaining parts of &quot;When Man and Machine Collide&quot;. Plans were cut short by a break-in at Morrisound in the spring of 2011 that saw much of their equipment stolen, pushing back the completion of the album. An exploratory meeting between producer Jim Morris and guitarist Shannon Hamm was held in December 2012. Greif stated in October 2016 that the recordings would not be completed. The progressive metal band Black Water Sunset released a tribute album featuring re-recorded versions of the four leaked tracks in May of 2024, marking what would have been Schuldiner&#x27;s birthday.

<text>Wadebridge (; ) is a town and civil parish in north Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The town straddles the River Camel upstream from Padstow. The permanent population was 6,222 in the census of 2001, increasing to 7,900 in the 2011 census. There are two electoral wards in the town (East and West). Their total population is 8,272.

Originally known as &quot;Wade&quot;, it was a dangerous fording point across the river until a bridge was built here in the 15th century, after which the name changed to its present form. The bridge was strategically important during the English Civil War, and Oliver Cromwell went there to take it. Since then, it has been widened twice and refurbished in 1991.

Wadebridge was served by a railway station between 1834 and 1967; part of the line now forms the Camel Trail, a recreational route for walkers, cyclists and horse riders. The town used to be a road traffic bottleneck on the A39 road until it was bypassed in 1991, and the main shopping street, Molesworth Street, is now pedestrianised.

The town has a secondary school where several notable sports-people were educated. The Royal Cornwall Show is a three-day agricultural show held at the nearby Royal Cornwall Showground every June, and the 5-day Cornwall Folk Festival takes place around the August Bank Holiday.

== History ==
===Early history===
The initial settlement of Wade (the name of Wadebridge before the bridge was built) came about due to a ford in the River Camel (Camel probably meaning &quot;crooked one&quot;). The early crossing had a chapel on each side of the river, &quot;King&#x27;s&quot; chapel on the north side and &quot;St Michael&#x27;s&quot; on the south side. People would pray for a safe crossing at one of the chapels before wading across at low tide, once they had made it the other side they would give thanks to God in the other chapel. In 1312, a licence was granted for a market at Wade by Edward II who also granted two fairs annually; on the feast of Saint Vitalis and at Michaelmas. Wade was part of the parish of St Breock and the river separated it from the neighbouring parish of Egloshayle.

At some time the ford was supplemented by a ferry until the Reverend Thomas Lovibond (the vicar of Egloshayle) became distressed at the number of humans and animals that died during the crossing of the River Camel so he planned the building of a bridge which was completed in 1468. Wade then became known as Wadebridge. When John Leland travelled through Cornwall in the early 16th century he wrote that the piers were resting on packs of wool. Begun in 1468 and completed in 1485, the bridge was traditionally known as the &quot;Bridge on Wool&quot; because it was reputedly built on wool sacks. In fact, however, it has been proven to be founded directly on the underlying bedrock.

The bridge was a strategic position in the English Civil War as in 1646 Oliver Cromwell came with 500 Dragoons and 1,000 horsemen to take the bridge. When the bridge was first completed tolls were charged for its maintenance. In 1853, it was widened from . A second widening took place in 1952 and then in 1963 it was again widened taking it to .

=== Railway ===
The Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway from Wadebridge to Wenfordbridge with branch lines to Bodmin and Ruthernbridge was built at a cost of £35,000 following a study commissioned in 1831 by local landowner Sir William Molesworth of Pencarrow. The line was intended to carry sand from the Camel Estuary to inland farms for use as fertiliser. It was opened on 30 September 1834 with the locomotive &quot;Camel&quot; pulling a train load of 400 passengers (one of the first railways in Britain to carry passengers). When the company ordered its second locomotive it came with a name plate already affixed. It had been named the &quot;Elephant&quot; as the makers had failed to realise that the first engine had been named after the river and not an animal.

The last passenger train left Wadebridge railway station in 1967 following railway cutbacks. The old railway trackbed is now the Camel Trail, and the Bodmin and Wenford Railway heritage railway runs on part of the route.

=== Quays ===
Wadebridge was the highest navigable town on the River Camel providing the main trade route before the building of the railway, and coasters would bring goods from Bristol and coal from South Wales. Timber was also imported from the Baltic, while stone from inland was sent to destination throughout England. The first locomotives used on the railway were also imported through the quay, being manufactured by Neath Abbey Ironworks, and the railway initially linked with river traffic well having been designed to distribute sand from the river to the local farms via a &quot;sand dock&quot; constructed upstream of the bridge at the point where the Treguddick Brook (Polmorla Brook) flows into the River Camel. This commodity, brought up from Padstow in barges, had previously been taken as far as Michaelstow and Blisland using pack animals.

In 1843 apart from the dock for the barges bringing sand for onward movement there was another dock capable of holding 5 vessels and construction of a breakwater was considered, while in 1880 there were quays on both sides of the river below the bridge with that on the west bank being served by the railway although the &quot;sand dock&quot; had been filled in by 1895. In the 1900s vessels such as the M.V. Florence brought cargos including slag (for fertiliser), grain and coal, and flour was also a regular cargo brought from Ranks at Avonmouth. However, in the 1950s the river silted badly so that the ketch &quot;Agnes&quot; was possibly the last vessel to bring cargo to Wadebridge when she was recorded there in 1955.

=== Eddystone Road ===
In 1877, after cracks appeared in the rock on which the Eddystone Lighthouse was positioned, a new lighthouse was commissioned from James Nicholas Douglass. Granite quarried from De Lank quarry was brought down to Wadebridge where stonemasons dovetailed each segment of stone not only to each other but also to the courses above and below. As each layer was completed and checked to fit with the layer above, it was sent out to the Eddystone rocks by sea. The lighthouse was completed in 1882. This resulted in the road where the masons worked being called Eddystone Road.

===World War I===
During World War I Wadebridge was home to refugees from the Netherlands and Belgium. In order to support them, a property in Park Street was converted into a Calvinist chapel.

===World War II===
Despite the rural nature of the area and the lack of military installations, during World War II there was a single recorded air raid when three bombs were dropped on the hill above Fernleigh Road. Residents report hearing the bombs whistling as they fell and landed in a field above the nearest houses. There were no casualties and only minor damage.

=== 21st century ===
In 2003, the Perch Garage murders occurred outside the town on the A39 road (Atlantic Highway).

==Government==
Wadebridge is in the constituency of North Cornwall which is currently held by the Liberal Democrat MP Ben Maguire. The main offices of the former North Cornwall District Council were at Trenant Road in the town. Wadebridge Town Council is based at Wadebridge Town Hall which was officially opened by Sir Paul Molesworth as the Molesworth Hall and Exchange on 23 May 1988.

Historically Wadebridge was part of St Columb Rural District Council until the creation of Wadebridge Urban District Council in April 1898.

==Geography==
The town straddles the River Camel, upstream from Padstow; the town centre being on the west bank of the river.

On St. Swithin&#x27;s day 1965, there was a flood in Wadebridge town centre after five and a half inches of rain fell in four and a half hours around high tide. The Swan Hotel on The Platt was flooded to a depth of one and a half feet.

==Transport==
For many years, Wadebridge was a traffic-congested town, through which the route of the A39 trunk road passed; however, in 1991, the Wadebridge bypass was opened, together with the Egloshayle bypass, enabling the two settlements to regain much of their former charm. The main shopping street in Wadebridge (Molesworth Street) has subsequently been pedestrianised through construction of an inner link road, allowing traffic-free shopping.

Local bus services are operated by Go Cornwall Bus and Kernow, with routes to Boscastle, Bude, Launceston, Padstow and Truro.

Wadebridge no longer has its own national railway station, since its closure in 1967. The nearest is now Bodmin Parkway, on the Cornish Main Line, which is served by services to Plymouth, Cardiff, London Paddington and Penzance.

==Culture and community==

The Molesworth Arms is one of the oldest Inns in Wadebridge. Previously known as The Fox, The King&#x27;s Arms and The Fountain, this coaching Inn got its current name in 1817.

Since 2014 the first of the annual events in and around Wadebridge has been the MayPlay festival, a weekend of free children&#x27;s activities.

The Royal Cornwall Agricultural Show is held at the Royal Cornwall Showground, west of Wadebridge over three days in early June each year. The show began in 1793 at Bodmin and was then held every year in East and West Cornwall alternately until 1960 when it came to its present site. The showground, run by the Royal Cornwall Agricultural Association, is used for many different functions from Scout Jamborees to point-to-point horse racing.

The Big Lunch, organised by the local chamber of commerce, is a free street party in the pedestrianised part of Molesworth St in the centre of Wadebridge, where around 500–750 people get together to share food, chat, and enjoy music and other entertainment. The idea grew out of a project by the Eden Project, and was started by a former local councillor, Harriet Wild. In 2012 it also served as a celebration of the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee.

Later in June, the Wadebridge Lions organise a Beer Festival, with brews from across Cornwall, and plenty of live music.

July sees the Rock Oyster Festival on fields just outside the town on the Camel River. Oysters are, of course, on the menu, along with bands from the local area, the South West and further afield.

Wadebridge Carnival is held annually in August, with a Carnival Queen and there is the Eglos Craft Fayre at Egloshayle Church.

The Cornwall Folk Festival, one of the UK&#x27;s longest-running folk festivals started in 1972, now runs for fives days around the August Bank Holiday. The focus is on contemporary folk music, bluegrass music, Americana (music), celtic music and acoustic music, with the likes of Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee Gretchen Peters, Scotland&#x27;s Eddi Reader MBE and Dougie Maclean OBE, The Unthanks, Martin Carthy MBE and Irish singer Cara Dillon rubbing shoulders with Cornish and bands. The &quot;musician&#x27;s musician&quot; Wiz Jones and father of the Lakeman clan (Seth Lakeman, Sam Lakeman and Sean Lakeman) Geoff Lakeman are the festival&#x27;s patrons. The festival was featured in the German travel documentary Wunderschön in Spring 2023.

Depending on the tides, the Camel River Festival is held around August or September. The main attraction is a set of raft races on the river, with bar, food, stalls and more live music.

In October, The Bikelights procession through the town centre showcases decorated bicycles and involves many youngsters.

In November the Prime Stock Show and the Garden Produce Association and Chrysanthemum Show are held.

A footbridge called the Challenge Bridge links the Egloshayle playing fields to the Jubilee fields on the other side of the river. The bridge was constructed in 1991 by Anneka Rice and her team for the TV series &quot;Challenge Anneka&quot;. Locally, the bridge is known as Anneka&#x27;s Bridge, but its real name is the Bailey Bridge.

The newspaper is a local edition of the weekly &quot;Cornish Guardian&quot;.

The town is twinned with Langueux (Langaeg) in Brittany, France.

In April 2013 Wadebridge was short-listed as one of Britain&#x27;s top eco-towns and is home to Wadebridge Renewable Energy Network a grass roots enterprise aiming to make the town the first solar powered and renewable energy powered town in the UK.

Wadebridge and District Museum opened in 2007 and moved to their current location on Chapel Lane in 2013.

== Demographics ==
The town has two primary schools which have academy status, Wadebridge Primary Academy which OfSTED graded as a ‘GOOD’ school in November 2012 and St. Breock Primary School. There is also a secondary school, Wadebridge School.

There are two health care practices: the Wadebridge and Camel Estuary Practice and the Bridge Medical Centre. There has been a group practice in Wadebridge since the early 20th century; many of the early doctors had their surgeries operating from their homes.

In the 1901 census the population of Wadebridge was 3470, while in 2001 the population was 6222.

== Sport ==

Wadebridge has been a centre for Cornish wrestling for centuries. Places used for Cornish wrestling tournaments include:
* Bodieve Park, including the Interceltic games in 1965 and 1967. 
* Cricket Ground, including the Interceltic games in 2006 and 2008.

<doc id="1047985" wikidata="Q725629" url="?curid=1047985" title="Larry Evans (chess player)">
<text>Larry Melvyn Evans (March 22, 1932 – November 15, 2010) was an American chess player, author, and journalist who received the FIDE title of Grandmaster (GM) in 1957. He won or shared the U.S. Chess Championship five times and the U.S. Open Chess Championship four times. He wrote a long-running syndicated chess column and wrote or co-wrote more than twenty books on chess.

==Chess career==

===Early years===
Evans was born on March 22, 1932, in Manhattan, the son of Bella (Shotl) and Harry Evans. His family was Jewish. He learned much about the game by playing for ten cents an hour on 42nd Street in New York City, quickly becoming a rising star. At age 14, he tied for 4th–5th place in the Marshall Chess Club championship. The next year he won it outright, becoming the youngest Marshall champion at that time. He also finished equal second in the U.S. Junior Championship, which led to an article in the September 1947 issue of Chess Review. At 16, he played in the 1948 U.S. Chess Championship, his first, tying for eighth place at 11½–7½. Evans tied with Arthur Bisguier for first place in the U.S. Junior Chess Championship of 1949. By age 18, he had won a New York State championship as well as a gold medal in the Dubrovnik 1950 Chess Olympiad. In the latter, his 90% score (eight wins and two draws) on sixth board tied with Rabar of Yugoslavia for the best result of the entire Olympiad.

===U.S. champion===

In 1951, Evans first won the U.S. Championship, ahead of Samuel Reshevsky, who had tied for 3rd–4th in the 1948 World Championship match-tournament. Evans won his second championship the following year by winning a title match against Herman Steiner. He won the national championship three additional times: in 1961–62, 1967–68, and 1980, the last in a tie with Walter Browne and Larry Christiansen.

===Grandmaster===
FIDE awarded Evans the titles of International Master (1952) and International Grandmaster (1957). In 1956 the U.S. State Department appointed him a &quot;chess ambassador&quot;.

Evans performed well in many U.S. events during the 1960s and 1970s, but his trips abroad to international tournaments were infrequent and less successful. He won the U.S. Open Chess Championship in 1951, 1952, 1954 (he tied with Arturo Pomar but won the title on the tie-break) and tied with Walter Browne in 1971. He also won the first Lone Pine tournament in 1971.

===Olympiad successes===
Evans represented the U.S. in eight Chess Olympiads over a period of twenty-six years, winning gold (1950), silver (1958), and bronze (1976) medals for his play, and participating in team gold (1976) and silver (1966) medals.

===Best international results===
Evans&#x27; best results on foreign soil included two wins at the Canadian Open Chess Championship, 1956 in Montreal, and 1966 in Kingston, Ontario. He tied for first–second in the 1975 Portimão, Portugal International and for second–third with World Champion Tigran Petrosian, behind Jan Hein Donner, in Venice, 1967. However, Evans&#x27; first, and what ultimately proved to be his only, chance in the World Chess Championship cycle ended with a disappointing 14th place (10/23) in the 1964 Amsterdam Interzonal.

At his peak in October 1968 he was rated 2631 by the United States Chess Federation.

===Working with Bobby Fischer===

He never entered the world championship cycle again, and concentrated his efforts on assisting his fellow American Bobby Fischer in his quest for the world title. He was Fischer&#x27;s second for the Candidates matches leading up to the World Chess Championship 1972 against Boris Spassky, though not for the championship match itself, after a disagreement with Fischer.

He also wrote the introductions to Fischer&#x27;s &quot;My 60 Memorable Games&quot; (1969) and urged Fischer to publish when he had initially been reluctant to do so.

==Chess journalism==
Evans had always been interested in writing as well as playing. By the age of 18, he had already published &quot;David Bronstein&#x27;s Best Games of Chess, 1944–1949&quot; and the &quot;Vienna International Tournament, 1922&quot;. His book &quot;New Ideas in Chess&quot; was published in 1958, and was reprinted in 2011. He wrote or co-wrote more than twenty books on chess.

He wrote the tenth edition of the important openings treatise &quot;Modern Chess Openings&quot; (1965), co-authored with editor Walter Korn. Some of Evans&#x27;s other books are &quot;Modern Chess Brilliancies&quot; (1970), &quot;What&#x27;s The Best Move&quot; (1973), and &quot;Test Your Chess I.Q.&quot; (2001).

Evans began his career in chess journalism during the 1960s, helping to found the &quot;American Chess Quarterly&quot;, which ran from 1961 to 1965. He was an editor of &quot;Chess Digest&quot; during the 1960s and 1970s. For over thirty years, until 2006, he wrote a question-and-answer column for &quot;Chess Life&quot;, the official publication of the United States Chess Federation (USCF), and has also written for Chess Life Online. His weekly chess column, &quot;Evans on Chess&quot;, has appeared in more than fifty separate newspapers throughout the United States. He also wrote a column for the World Chess Network.

Evans also commentated on some of the most important matches for &quot;Time&quot; magazine and &quot;ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports&quot;, including the 1972 Fischer versus Spassky match, the 1993 PCA world title battle between Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short, and the Braingames world chess championship match between Vladimir Kramnik and Kasparov in 2000.

Evans also contributed a large amount of tutorial and other content to the &quot;Chessmaster&quot; computer game series, most notably an endgame quiz and annotations of classic chess games. He was inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame in 1994.

===Criticism of writings===
Larry Evans was a prolific author, with many who both liked and disliked his works.

Noted chess author and trainer International Master John L. Watson made the following observations on Evans&#x27;s books and columns: &quot;huge bias&quot;; &quot;long histories of ignoring and distorting evidence&quot; and &quot;Evans&#x27; absurd arguments&quot;.

By contrast, chess author and International Master Anthony Saidy noted that Evans brought to his journalism a &quot;taste for intriguing chess&quot;, his personal experience at &quot;the summit of US chess&quot;, and &quot;sharp opinions&quot; regarding the politics of chess, which contributed to his &quot;spicy, concise columns&quot;.

Author and USCF National Master Bruce Pandolfini described Larry Evans&#x27;s &quot;New Ideas in Chess&quot; as influential and a &quot;first-rate chess book&quot;.

Leading chess historian Edward Winter, however, has noted numerous factual errors in Evans&#x27; work as well as several examples of possible plagiarism.

On page 175 of Evans&#x27; book, &quot;Modern Chess Brilliancies&quot;, he claims Lodewijk Prins adjourned a clearly lost position against Cuban master Quesada and was lucky enough when the latter died of a heart attack the &quot;next day&quot;. Prins noted that he had actually resigned the position, as is proven by the tournament crosstables showing it as a loss for him, and that Quesada played three more games in the tournament before dying five days after the game against Prins. While Evans acknowledged the error, he defended it with &quot;you must admit it makes a good story.&quot;

==Death==
On November 15, 2010, Evans died in Reno, Nevada, from complications following gallbladder surgery.

<text>Charleswood is a residential community and neighbourhood in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Situated in the southwest of the city, it is bordered by the neighbourhoods of Tuxedo to the east, Whyte Ridge to the south, and the Rural Municipality of Headingley to the west. The area&#x27;s boundaries are defined by Roblin Boulevard and the Assiniboine River to the north, Shaftesbury Boulevard to the east, Wilkes Avenue to the south, and the Perimeter Highway to the west.

Historically, the region was known for &quot;The Passage,&quot; a ford across the Assiniboine River that served as an essential route for Indigenous and Métis traders and settlers. In 1869, the area was ceded by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to the Dominion of Canada, becoming a focal point for European settlement. Charleswood was incorporated as a Rural Municipality in 1913 and maintained its independence until 1972, when it was merged with the City of Winnipeg during the city&#x27;s amalgamation. Since the 1930s, Charleswood has been recognized as &quot;The Suburb Beautiful.&quot;

Today, Charleswood is part of the city ward of Charleswood-Tuxedo-Westwood; and is situated within the provincial electoral district of Roblin (formerly the Charleswood electoral district). The community is also served by the Pembina Trails School Division.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name &quot;Charleswood&quot; is unclear, as it has at least two possibilities: it may have been named for Charles Kelly, who served on the first municipal council and was the son of early settler Patrick Kelly; or it is a combination of the Parish name &quot;St. Charles&quot; and the dense woodland that encompassed the area. Charleswood was briefly named Kelheau after Kelly.

==History==
Indigenous peoples have inhabited the region that is now Charleswood for at least 3,000 years. The area is home to a natural ford known as &quot;the Passage&quot;. This was a part of the Assiniboine River that was shallow enough for people and animals to cross safely. The ford was used by American bison for thousands of years. By the 19th century, it had become the main crossing for Indigenous and Métis traders, Red River Settlers travelling to Pembina, and independent traders looking to bypass the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company at the Forks. This attracted Métis and later Red River Settlers, and was the site of Kuypers’ farm

When the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company ceded Rupert&#x27;s Land to the Dominion of Canada in 1869, the regions south of the Assiniboine River were incorporated for further European settlement as the Rural Municipality of Assiniboia. This new R.M. combined the Parishes of Headingley, St. Charles, St. James, and a portion of St. Boniface. In 1899, a highway, now Roblin Boulevard, was surveyed along the south side of the Assiniboine River

Patrick H. Kelly (1847–1940) is widely regarded as the founder of what is now Charleswood. He was a farmer and municipal official who moved from Perth County, Ontario, in 1906 and settled in the then-Rural Municipality of Assiniboia, taking over of land. He built a general store in 1907; was key in establishing the community&#x27;s first post office; and was instrumental in developing the community&#x27;s school. He also convinced the Winnipeg Electric Railway Company to extend the street railway so that the community had a connection with the City of Winnipeg.

Kelly eventually came to persuade residents of the community to apply for the creation of Charleswood as a separate municipality. Kelly was successful and the Rural Municipality of Charleswood was incorporated on 15 February 1913. The municipality was formed from parts of the R.M. of Assiniboia and Parishes of Headingley and St. Charles, while excluding territories held by the Town of Tuxedo and the City of Winnipeg. The first four meetings of the new municipal council were held in a room in his store.

During the 1910s, the area was marketed as &quot;Rydal&quot;, a prospective residential locale by the developers of Tuxedo. There was little housing in Charleswood before 1920 and only limited growth between 1920 and 1946. The local economy at the time was chiefly agricultural with dairy and poultry farms, market gardens, and mink ranchers. Following World War II, it became popular with European immigrants who wanted to avoid living too close to the centre of Winnipeg. Development of the area increased, and new houses were constructed in the Roblin Park, Marlton, and Varsity View neighbourhoods. A ferry service was in operation in the region as late as 1958, and a trail leading to the ford was visible until fairly recently. The area experienced particularly strong growth in the 1970s, with at least 7,500 homes built during that decade.

In 1972, the Rural Municipality of Charleswood was among several municipalities that amalgamated into the City of Winnipeg. With Headingley seceding in 1992, the former municipalities on the north and south sides of the Assiniboine River—Charleswood and St. James-Assiniboia, respectively—were reunited as the Assiniboia Community. In 1995, the Charleswood Bridge opened over the Assiniboine River, physically connecting the two communities.

==Points of interest==
The Assiniboine Forest is a 700-acre forest in Charleswood and hosts 18 km of walking paths, which connect to Assiniboine Park and to the Harte Trail. The Harte Trail is a 6.5 km multi-use trail that follows an old railway, and forms a part of the Trans Canada Trail.

There are two designated historical structures in Charleswood. Located in Caron Park, Caron House is one of the last remaining original farmhouses in Charleswood. Odd Fellows Home is a building originally built as a home for elderly members of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and their spouses, as well as orphanage for children of deceased members. Charleswood&#x27;s former Municipal Hall has also been converted to the Charleswood Community Museum.

==Sports==
Charleswood is home to the Charleswood Hawks hockey team playing out of the MMJHL. It is also home to the Charleswood Curling Club, home club of 6 time provincial, 2 times national, and 1996 world curling champion Jeff Stoughton.

==Education==
Charleswood is served by Ward 1 of the Pembina Trails School Division.

It has 9 elementary schools: Pacific Junction School, Royal School, École Charleswood School, École Dieppe, Beaumont School, Beaverlodge School, Westdale School, Westgrove School and River West Park School. It has one secondary school, École secondaire Oak Park High School.

Charleswood is host to the main campus of Canadian Mennonite University, which includes the former Manitoba School for the Deaf.

==Transportation==
Charleswood is served by the 98, 95, 78, 67, 66, 65 and 18 Winnipeg Transit buses.

==Crime==
Charleswood has very low crime rates. The table below shows the crime rates of various crimes in each of the Charleswood neighbourhoods. The crime data spans 5 years from the year 2017 to the year 2021. The rates are &quot;crimes per 100,000 residents per year.&quot;

<text>Disembowelment, often styled as diSEMBOWELMENT, were an Australian death-doom band that formed in November 1989 featuring Renato Gallina on guitar and vocals, and Paul Mazziotta on drums. In early 1991 Jason Kells joined on lead guitar and at the end of that year the group&#x27;s line-up was completed by Matthew Skarajew on bass guitar. In 1992 they issued an extended play, &quot;Dusk&quot;, on Relapse Records and followed with a studio album, &quot;Transcendence into the Peripheral&quot;, in 1993. They disbanded shortly thereafter – never having performed live. AllMusic&#x27;s Eduardo Rivadavia described them as &quot;[s]till revered in underground circles as doom-grind pioneers ... [their works] remain genre classics&quot;.

==History==
Disembowelment formed in Melbourne in November 1989 from the demise of a two-piece grind band Bacteria, featuring Renato Gallina on guitar and vocals, and Paul Mazziotta on drums. With the help of Dean Ruprich from Melbourne death/grind band Necrotomy providing session bass guitar, the band released its first demo, &quot;Mourning September&quot; in September 1990. Disembowelment played a very slow form of doom – with occasional bursts of great speed – that relied equally on the atmospheric effects of droning guitars and constant riffing. The band was known for its atmospheric chanting, slow riffs and spiritual dark elements present in their symphonic, heavily distorted style. They are often credited with spawning the funeral doom movement that developed years later.

In 1991, Jason Kells joined the band on lead guitar. The song &quot;Extracted Nails&quot; was recorded in April 1991 at Double Tea Studios for a compilation on the German label &quot;Mangled Beyond Recognition&quot;, released the following year. The compilation featured Therion, God Macabre, Rottrevore, Cadaver, Crematory, Pan.Thy.Monium, Cenotaph, and Hydr Hydr. On 3–4 August 1991, the band went back to Double Tea studios to record their second demo, &quot;Deep Sensory Perception into Aural Fate&quot;. This recording marked a big step forward in the maturity of the songwriting, performance and overall production. The demo sparked the interest of Relapse Records, who signed them up and released the demo as the &quot;Dusk&quot; extended play in 1992. It was an edited version of the demo which omitted the linking piece of music between the two tracks. It included the first recorded version of &quot;Cerulean Transience of all My Imagined Shores&quot;, a third track not featured on the earlier demo.

At the end of 1991, Matthew Skarajew (ex-Sanctum, lead guitar) had joined the group on bass guitar and they recorded &quot;Cerulean Transience of all My Imagined Shores&quot; the following year. Initially as full time bass guitarist for his early sessions, later he added guitar work (acoustic and melodic). In 1993 Disembowelment released their debut studio album, &quot;Transcendence into the Peripheral&quot;, which featured a slowly executed drumming style, accompanied by death metal vocals, chants and passages of dark ambience. Disembowelment split up after the album&#x27;s release. Prior to breaking up, they had mentioned the possibility of a one-off live show that &quot;would be an event, a unique concert&quot;. However it never eventuated. At the time they had rehearsed and prepared five cover versions for a potential EP. &quot;Slaughtered Remains&quot; (cover of a Necrovore track) was a demo track which appeared in 2005 on a bonus disc of the limited release of &quot;Disembowelment&quot; compilation. This featured Mazziotta on drums, Skarajew on guitars and Gallina layered a new vocal track onto it 3 years later.

Allmusic&#x27;s Eduardo Rivadavia described Disembowelment as &quot;[s]till revered in underground circles as doom-grind pioneers ... [their works] remain genre classics&quot;. Justin Donnelly of &quot;Metal Forge&quot; declared they were &quot;the legendary unground Australian doom/grindcore/ambient act&quot; and &quot;often referred to as merely a doom band, the sort of music ... is actually far more than eclectic and broad sounding than simply labelling them to one particular genre&quot;.

Gallina and Skarajew continued working together in the ethno ambient act, Trial of the Bow, which Skarajew had initiated during his time in Disembowelment. The group released an EP, &quot;Ornamentation&quot;, and an album, &quot;Rite of Passage&quot;, to critical approval, notably &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Wired Magazine&quot;. Trial of the Bow was licensed to Rykodisc soon after. From 2004 Skarajew and Mazziotta formed a grind band, Pulgar. In October 2005 Disembowelment&#x27;s catalogue was re-released as a double and limited edition triple CD, &quot;Disembowelment&quot; by Relapse Records. Two different limited edition vinyl box sets were later released. A related band, d.USK, formed in 2010 with original Disembowelment members Skarajew and Mazziotta and played some their former group&#x27;s material as a live band. In late 2011 d.USK split and re-emerged under the name Inverloch, which plays a different form of death/doom than Disembowelment and d.USK.

In 2019 Renato revisited the track &quot;Nightside of Eden&quot; gifting it to the forum Doom-Metal.com. The track was released alongside a statement and digital download links for both WAV and mp3 formats. 

2020 saw the limited repressing of &quot;Transcendence into the Peripheral&quot; and the release of &quot;Dusk / Deep Sensory Procession into Aural Fate&quot; under Relapse Records, which combined Disembowelment&#x27;s only EP and a remaster of their second demo.

<text>Antyfaszystowska Organizacja Bojowa (Polish for &quot;Anti-Fascist Military Organisation&quot;), AOB, was an underground organization formed in 1942 in the Ghetto in Białystok by former officers of the Polish Land Forces. It took part in the Białystok Ghetto uprising.

Its tasks included organisation of escape routes for the people incarcerated in the Ghetto as well as gathering arms and equipment for the future fight against the Germans. Since February 1943 it carried over many attacks on German authorities and armed forces operating in the Ghetto. On August 15, 1943, the AOB members started an ill-fated struggle against the liquidation of the Ghetto, which is known as the Białystok Ghetto Uprising.

<text>Michael William Kaluta, sometimes credited as Mike Kaluta or Michael Wm. Kaluta (born August 25, 1947), is an American comics artist and writer best known for his acclaimed 1970s adaptation of the pulp magazine hero &quot;The Shadow&quot; with writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil. He is the godfather of comedian and gamemaster Brennan Lee Mulligan.

==Early life==
Born in Guatemala to U.S. citizens, Kaluta studied at the Richmond Professional Institute (now Virginia Commonwealth University).

==Career==
Kaluta&#x27;s early work included a three-page adventure story, &quot;The Battle of Shiraz&quot;, in Charlton Comics &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; #18 (Jan. 1970) and an adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27;s &quot;Carson of Venus&quot; novels for DC Comics.

Kaluta&#x27;s influences and style are drawn from pulp illustrations of the 1930s and the turn-of-the-century poster work of Alphonse Mucha – his signature motif is elaborate decorative panel designs – rather than the comic books of the Silver Age. He has rarely worked with the superhero genre, although one of his early contributions for DC was a &quot;World of Krypton&quot; backup story in &quot;Superman&quot; #240 (July 1971).

His first cover for a comic book was &quot;House of Mystery&quot; #200 (March 1972). Associated during the 1970s with Bernie Wrightson and Jeffrey Jones, he contributed illustrations to Ted White&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic&quot; and &quot;Amazing&quot;. Kaluta co-created Eve in &quot;Secrets of Sinister House&quot; #6 (Aug.–Sept. 1972), a horror comics &quot;host&quot; character later turned into a supporting character in &quot;The Sandman&quot;. He and writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil produced a comics adaptation of &quot;The Shadow&quot; for DC in 1973–1974. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that &quot;Kaluta&#x27;s style [on &quot;The Shadow&quot;] is an homage to Graves Gladney, master of the pulp magazine covers of the 1930s.&quot; Kaluta left the series after drawing five of the first six issues.

Kaluta was one of the four comic book artists/fine illustrator/painters (along with Jeffrey Jones, Barry Windsor-Smith, and Bernie Wrightson) who formed the artists&#x27; commune The Studio in a loft in Manhattan&#x27;s Chelsea district in 1975 and continuing to 1979. In addition to many comic book stories and covers, Kaluta has done a wide variety of book illustrations.

Kaluta drew the cover for the &quot;Madame Xanadu&quot; one-shot in 1981 which was DC&#x27;s second direct sales only comic. He and writer Elaine Lee crafted &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; #13 &quot;Starstruck: The Luckless, the Abandoned and Forsaked&quot; which led to an ongoing series which ran for six issues. Kaluta and O&#x27;Neil reunited on &quot;The Shadow: 1941 – Hitler&#x27;s Astrologer&quot; graphic novel published in 1988. In 2006, Kaluta was one of the artists on the &quot;1001 Nights of Snowfall&quot; graphic novel written by Bill Willingham.

In 1984 he drew the illustrations for and directed the music video of &quot;Don&#x27;t Answer Me&quot; by The Alan Parsons Project, which became one of the most requested videos of the year on the cable video channel MTV.

Among music fans, Kaluta is known as the cover artist of Glenn Danzig&#x27;s instrumental album &quot;Black Aria&quot; and for the interior illustration of Danzig&#x27;s fourth album, the latter of which appeared in 1994 and 1995 as a pendant sold at Danzig concerts, and on Danzig T-shirts and sweaters produced in the same period. Kaluta created the CD covers and interior booklet illustrations for &quot;Nativity in Black I&quot; and &quot;II&quot;, tribute albums to the music of Black Sabbath. Kaluta drew the cover art for the Bobby Pickett album &quot;The Original Monster Mash&quot; when it was reissued in 1973.

Kaluta has worked for role-playing game companies such as White Wolf Publishing. He has done artwork for collectible card games companies, including a comic book for Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and illustrating cards on Last Unicorn Games&#x27; &quot;&quot;.

In the early 1990s, he was active in Compuserve&#x27;s Macintosh Gaming Forum, in the flight simulator enthusiast group which called itself VFA-13 Shadow Riders. He contributed a number of designs for airplane nose art and flight suit unit patches.

==Awards==
Kaluta&#x27;s work has won him a good deal of recognition, including the Shazam Award for Outstanding New Talent in 1971, the Inkpot Award in 1977, and the 2003 Spectrum Award for Grand Master.

<text>Macmillan Publishers (occasionally known as the Macmillan Group; formally Macmillan Publishers Ltd in the UK and Macmillan Publishing Group, LLC in the US) is a British publishing company traditionally considered to be one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; English language publishers (along with Penguin Random House, Hachette, HarperCollins and Simon &amp; Schuster). Founded in London in 1843 by Scottish brothers Daniel and Alexander MacMillan, the firm soon established itself as a leading publisher in Britain. It published two of the best-known works of Victorian-era children&#x27;s literature, Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865) and Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1894).

Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Harold Macmillan, grandson of co-founder Daniel, was chairman of the company from 1964 until his death in December 1986. Since 1999, Macmillan has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Holtzbrinck Publishing Group with offices in 41 countries worldwide and operations in more than thirty others.

==History==

Macmillan was founded in London in 1843 by Daniel and Alexander MacMillan, two brothers from the Isle of Arran, Scotland. Daniel was the business brain, while Alexander laid the literary foundations, publishing such notable authors as Charles Kingsley (1855), Thomas Hughes (1859), Francis Turner Palgrave (1861), Christina Rossetti (1862), Matthew Arnold (1865) and Lewis Carroll (1865), with the latter first meeting Alexander in London on 19 October 1863. Alfred, Lord Tennyson joined the list in 1884, Thomas Hardy in 1886 and Rudyard Kipling in 1890. 

Other major writers published by Macmillan included W. B. Yeats, Rabindranath Tagore, Nirad C. Chaudhuri, Seán O&#x27;Casey, John Maynard Keynes, Charles Morgan, Hugh Walpole, Margaret Mitchell, C. P. Snow, Rumer Godden and Ram Sharan Sharma.

Beyond literature, the company created such enduring titles as &quot;Nature&quot; (1869), the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; (1877) and Sir Robert Harry Inglis Palgrave&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Political Economy&quot; (1894–99).
George Edward Brett opened the first Macmillan office in the United States in 1869 and Macmillan sold its U.S. operations to the Brett family, George Platt Brett, Sr. and George Platt Brett, Jr. in 1896, resulting in the creation of an American company, Macmillan Publishing, also called The Macmillan Company (later known as Macmillan Inc.). Even with the split of the American company from its parent company in England, George Brett, Jr. and Harold Macmillan remained close personal friends. Macmillan Publishers held stake in the American company before divested it in 1951 and later re-entered the American market in 1952 under the name St. Martin&#x27;s Press. 

Macmillan of Canada was founded in 1905; Maclean-Hunter acquired the company in 1973. Following numerous mergers, Macmillan Canada dissolved in 2002 after John Wiley &amp; Co. acquired it.

After retiring from politics in 1964, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Harold Macmillan, grandson of co-founder Daniel, became chairman of the company, serving until 1974 when he handed on the chairmanship to his son Maurice Macmillan(who in turn left the government, having been Paymaster General in the defeated government of Edward Heath) and took on the more honorific position of President until his death in December 1986.
He had been with the family firm as a junior partner from 1920 to 1940 (when he became a junior minister), and from 1945 to 1951 while he was in the opposition in Parliament.

The German Holtzbrinck Publishing Group purchased the company in 1999.

===21st century===
Pearson acquired the Macmillan name in America in 1998, following its purchase of the Simon &amp; Schuster educational and professional group (which included various Macmillan Inc. properties and trademarks). Holtzbrinck purchased it from them in 2001. McGraw-Hill continues to market its pre-kindergarten through elementary school titles under its Macmillan/McGraw-Hill brand. The US operations of Holtzbrinck Publishing changed its name to Macmillan in October 2007. Its audio publishing imprint changed its name from Audio Renaissance to Macmillan Audio, while its distribution arm was renamed from Von Holtzbrinck Publishers Services to Macmillan Publishers Services. Pan Macmillan purchased Kingfisher, a British children&#x27;s publisher, from Houghton Mifflin in October 2007. Roaring Brook Press publisher Simon Boughton would oversee Kingfisher&#x27;s US business.

By some estimates, as of 2009, e-books account for three to five per cent of total book sales, and are the fastest growing segment of the market. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Macmillan and other major publishers &quot;fear that massive discounting [of e-books] by retailers including Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble and Sony could ultimately devalue what consumers are willing to pay for books.&quot; In response, the publisher introduced a new boilerplate contract for its authors that established a royalty of 20 per cent of net proceeds on e-book sales, a rate five per cent lower than most other major publishers. Following the announcement of the Apple iPad on 27 January 2010—a product that comes with access to the iBookstore—Macmillan gave Amazon.com two options: continue to sell e-books based on a price of the retailer&#x27;s choice (the &quot;wholesale model&quot;), with the e-book edition released several months after the hardcover edition is released, or switch to the agency model introduced to the industry by Apple, in which both are released simultaneously and the price is set by the publisher. In the latter case, Amazon.com would receive a 30 per cent commission. Amazon responded by pulling all Macmillan books, both electronic and physical, from their website (although affiliates selling the books were still listed). On 31 January 2010, Amazon chose the agency model preferred by Macmillan. In April 2012, the United States Department of Justice filed &quot;United States v. Apple Inc.&quot;, naming Apple, Macmillan, and four other major publishers as defendants. The suit alleged that they conspired to fix prices for e-books, and weaken Amazon.com&#x27;s position in the market, in violation of antitrust law. In December 2013, a federal judge approved a settlement of the antitrust claims, in which Macmillan and the other publishers paid into a fund that provided credits to customers who had overpaid for books due to the price-fixing.

In 2010, Macmillan Education submitted to an investigation on grounds of fraudulent practices. The Macmillan division admitted to bribery in an attempt to secure a contract for an education project in southern Sudan. As a direct result of the investigation, sanctions were applied by the World Bank Group, namely a six-year debarment (reduced from eight years due to an early acknowledgment of misconduct by the company) declaring the company ineligible to be awarded Bank-financed contracts.

In December 2011, Bedford, Freeman, and Worth Publishing Group, Macmillan&#x27;s higher education group, changed its name to Macmillan Higher Education while retaining the Bedford, Freeman, and Worth name for its k–12 educational unit. Also, that month, Brian Napack resigned as Macmillan president while staying on for transitional purposes.

In 2012, parent company Holtzbrinck reorganized; Macmillan&#x27;s consumer publishing operations were now led by John Turner Sargent from New York City.

In May 2015, London-based Macmillan Science and Education merged with Berlin-based Springer Science+Business Media to form Springer Nature, jointly controlled by Holtzbrinck Publishing Group and BC Partners. The following month, it dissolved its British-based imprint Boxtree Limited, which Macmillan had operated since 1986.

In January 2019, Toronto, Canada-based online writing community Wattpad announced an agreement with Macmillan [sic, Springer Nature America] for handling sales and distribution in the U.S. for its new publishing division Wattpad Books, alongside rival Penguin Random House that will handle the U.K. and India market, and Raincoast Books for the Canadian market.

In November 2019, Macmillan announced that libraries would be able to buy only one copy of e-books for the first eight weeks after publication, in an effort to boost sales by creating long waits for borrowers at large library systems. This prompted complaints and some libraries boycotted the company; the policy was reversed in March 2020.

In September 2020, Macmillan announced that CEO John Sargent will be leaving at the end of the year due to &quot;a disagreement regarding the direction of Macmillan.&quot; According to Holtzbrinck spokesperson Erin Coffey, the decision was made by Stefan von Holtzbrinck, CEO of the Holtzbrinck group.

<doc id="1048015" wikidata="Q68963" url="?curid=1048015" title="Jürgen Bartsch">
<text>Jürgen Bartsch (born Karl-Heinz Sadrozinski; November 6, 1946 – April 28, 1976) was a West German serial killer who murdered four boys aged between 8 and 13 and attempted to kill a fifteen-year-old boy. The case of this sexual offender was the first in German jurisdiction history to include psycho-social factors of the defendant, who came from a violent early surrounding, to set down the sentence.

==Early life==
Bartsch was born an illegitimate child whose birth mother died of tuberculosis five months after his birth, and so he spent the first months of his life being cared for by nurses. At 11 months he was adopted by a butcher and his wife in Langenberg (today Velbert-Langenberg), who gave him the name Jürgen Bartsch. Bartsch&#x27;s adoptive mother, who suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder, was fixated on cleanliness. He was not permitted to play with other children, lest he become dirty. This continued into adulthood; his mother personally bathed him until he was 19. At the age of 10, Bartsch entered school. Because, in his parents&#x27; opinion, it was not sufficiently strict, he was moved to a Catholic boarding school.

Bartsch was physically abused as a baby and was often discovered with visible scars and bruises. His mother also physically beat him, often in the same room where his father, the butcher, cut up carcasses. He was detained in an underground cellar for six years and was also sexually abused by his mother during bathing sessions. Bartsch was sexually abused by his thirteen-year old cousin when he was only eight years old and was also later abused by his teacher when he was thirteen years old.

==Murders==
Bartsch began killing at the age of fifteen. His first victim was Klaus Jung who was murdered in 1962. His next victim was Peter Fuchs who was killed three years later in 1965. He persuaded all of his victims to accompany him into an abandoned air-raid shelter, where he forced them to undress and then sexually abused them. He dismembered his first four victims. His intended fifth victim, 15-year-old Peter Frese, however, escaped by burning through his bindings with a candle that Bartsch had left burning after leaving the shelter that he has been keeping his victims in. Bartsch was arrested in 1966.

==Sentence==
Upon arrest, Bartsch openly confessed to his crimes. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on December 15, 1967, by the Wuppertal regional court (&quot;Landgericht Wuppertal&quot;). Initially, the sentence was upheld on appeal. However, in 1971, the Federal Court of Justice of Germany, returned the case to the &quot;Landgericht&quot; Düsseldorf, which reduced the sentence to 10 years of juvenile detention and had Bartsch placed under psychiatric care in Eickelborn. There, he married Gisela Deike of Hanover on January 2, 1974.

==Death==
The forensic psychiatrists considered various therapy concepts: psychotherapy, castration and even psychosurgery. Bartsch initially refused any surgery but finally agreed to voluntary castration on April 28, 1976, in order to avoid lifetime incarceration in a mental hospital. This was about ten years after incarceration, two years after his marriage, and after his depressive condition did not improve. The doctors of Eickelborn State Hospital chose a castration methodology that accidentally resulted in Bartsch&#x27;s death. An official autopsy and investigation determined that Bartsch had been intoxicated with a halothane overdose (factor 10) due to a mistake during surgery.

==Victims==
*March 31, 1962: Klaus Jung, 8
*August 6, 1965: Peter Fuchs, 13
*August 14, 1965: Ulrich Kahlweiss, 12
*May 6, 1966: Manfred Grassmann, 12
*June 18, 1966: Peter Frese, 15 (escaped)

==Influence==
The 2002 film &quot;Ein Leben lang kurze Hosen tragen&quot; (released in the U.S. in 2004, as &quot;The Child I Never Was&quot;) depicts Bartsch&#x27;s life and crimes.

Bartsch is referenced in Elfriede Jelinek&#x27;s novel &quot;Die Kinder der Toten&quot; as someone who had no difficulty dismembering his victims.

German metal band Bethlehem, whose bass player is also named Jürgen Bartsch, dedicated their album &quot;Hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia&quot; to Bartsch.

<doc id="1048019" wikidata="Q6824330" url="?curid=1048019" title="Metric typographic units">
<text>Metric typographic units have been devised and proposed several times to overcome the various traditional point systems. After the French Revolution of 1789 one popular proponent of a switch to metric was Didot, who had been able to standardise the continental European typographic measurement a few decades earlier. The conversion did not happen, though. The Didot [[Point (typography)|point]] was metrically redefined as  m (≈ 0.376 mm) in 1879 by Berthold.

The advent and success of desktop publishing (DTP) software and word processors for office use, coming mostly from the non-metric United States, side stepped this metrication process in typography. DTP commonly uses the PostScript point, which is defined as of an inch (0.3527 mm).

== Metric Didot Point ==

With the introduction of phototypesetting in the 1970s metric units were increasingly used in typography. The Didot point was redefined once again to 375 μm, exactly  mm.

== Quart ==

Also in the 1970s, the new unit quart (&quot;quarter millimetre&quot;, abbreviated &#x27;q&#x27;) of 250 μm ( mm) was devised. The German draft standard DIN 16507-2 has suggested that digital typography will be specified using millimeters, with sizes in multiples of 0.250  mm. In some special cases where finer resolution is required, it is permitted with sizes in multiples of 0.100 or 0.050 mm (respectively 2.5 and 5 times finer step sizes).

German graphic designer and typographer Otl Aicher (1922 – 1991) vividly encouraged the use of the quart, and provided a suggested list of common sizes:

Note that Aicher&#x27;s font sizes are based on the DIN standard then in development, which uses the H-height, whereas in lead typesetting the larger cap height was used. Some typographers have proposed using the x-height instead, because the psychological size depends more on the size of default, lowercase letters.

== Device resolutions ==
The resolution of computer screens is often denoted in millimetres pitch, whereas office printers are usually denoted reciprocally in dots per inch (&#x27;dpi&#x27;, &#x27;d/in&#x27;). Phototypesetters have long used micrometres. 

To convert dpi resolution to μm resolution, the formula to be used is &quot;&quot;, where &quot;R&quot; is the resolution in dpi. So for example 96 dpi translates to a resolution of 265 μm.

The CSS3 media queries draft introduces the unit dots per centimetre (dpcm) for resolution.

* Dots per centimeter, a metric unit of dot density in printing, video or images, proposed to replace dots per inch (DPI).

<doc id="1048026" wikidata="Q613260" url="?curid=1048026" title="Aline Kominsky-Crumb">
<text>Aline Kominsky-Crumb (née Goldsmith; August 1, 1948 – November 29, 2022) was an American underground comics artist. Kominsky-Crumb&#x27;s work, which is almost exclusively autobiographical, is known for its unvarnished, confessional nature. In 2016, ComicsAlliance listed Kominsky-Crumb as one of twelve women cartoonists deserving of lifetime achievement recognition. She was married to cartoonist Robert Crumb, with whom she frequently collaborated. Their daughter, Sophie Crumb, is also a cartoonist.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Aline Goldsmith was born to a Jewish family in the Five Towns area of Long Island, New York. Her father was a largely unsuccessful businessman and organized crime associate. As a teenager, she turned to drugs and the counterculture, and was a hanger-on to New York countercultural musicians such as The Fugs. Relocating to East Village during her college years, she began studying art at The Cooper Union.

In 1968, Aline married Carl Kominsky, with whom she relocated to Tucson, Arizona. Their marriage did not last long. However, she retained the surname Kominsky after their split. During this time, she attended University of Arizona, graduating with a BFA in 1971.

=== Career ===
Kominsky-Crumb was introduced to underground cartoonists Spain Rodriguez and Kim Deitch by former Fugs drummer Ken Weaver, who was living in Tucson at the same time. Rodriguez and Deitch introduced her to underground comix, inspiring her to begin making underground comics herself and to relocate to San Francisco.

In 1972, soon after arriving in San Francisco, Aline was introduced to Robert Crumb by mutual friends, who had noted an uncanny resemblance between her and the coincidentally-named Crumb character Honeybunch Kaminski (who had been created in 1970). Their relationship soon became serious, and they began living together.

Kominsky-Crumb also fell in with the &quot;Wimmen&#x27;s Comix&quot; collective, and contributed to the first few issues of that series. After she and Diane Noomin had a falling out with Trina Robbins and other members of the collective, they started their own title, &quot;Twisted Sisters&quot;. Kominsky-Crumb later claimed that a large part of her break with the &quot;Wimmen&#x27;s Comix&quot; group was over feminist issues and particularly over her relationship with Robert Crumb, whom Robbins particularly disliked.

Kominsky-Crumb married Crumb in 1978. Their daughter Sophie was born in 1981. Starting in the late 1970s, Aline and Robert produced a series of collaborative comics called &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot; (also known as &quot;Aline &amp; Bob&#x27;s Dirty Laundry&quot;), a comic about the Crumb family life. They both drew their own characters for the comic. Around this time, Kominsky-Crumb began calling her comics avatar &quot;The Bunch,&quot; a reference to the similarly named Crumb character. Later installments of &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot; feature contributions by Sophie, who also began producing comics in her teens.

From 1986 to 1993, Kominsky-Crumb was editor of &quot;Weirdo&quot;, a leading alternative comics anthology of the time, taking over the editorship from Peter Bagge, who had previously taken over from original editor Robert Crumb. Her editorial reign was known as &quot;Twisted Sisters&quot;, reviving that title; Noomin was a frequent &quot;Weirdo&quot; contributor during this period, which also featured Kominsky-Crumb&#x27;s own comics.

From 1991, Robert and Aline lived as expatriates in a small French village in the Languedoc-Roussillon region. Aline had long been an avowed Francophile, while Robert had become especially disgusted with American culture, and they believed it would be a better environment for their daughter.

Kominsky-Crumb was featured in a number of scenes in &quot;Crumb&quot;, the 1994 documentary about the Crumb family.

Kominsky-Crumb and her husband had an open marriage, and Kominsky-Crumb&#x27;s &quot;second husband&quot;, French printmaker Christian Coudurès, lived with the family (as did his daughter, Agathe McCamy, who assisted Kominsky-Crumb in coloring her comics).

In addition to her comics work, Kominsky-Crumb was a painter. After moving to France, she focused more on painting and less on producing comics. In February 2007 she released a memoir entitled &quot;Need More Love: A Graphic Memoir&quot;, a collection of her comics and paintings, along with photographs and autobiographical writings.

In 2018, Kominsky-Crumb&#x27;s &quot;Love That Bunch&quot;, which was originally published in 1990, was expanded by Drawn &amp; Quarterly with new comics and an introduction written by Hillary Chute.

===Death===
Kominsky-Crumb died from pancreatic cancer at her home in France on November 29, 2022, at the age of 74.

==In popular culture==
In the 2015 movie, &quot;The Diary of a Teenage Girl&quot; set in San Francisco during the mid-1970&#x27;s, the heroine, an aspiring cartoonist, imagines herself talking with Kominsky, and apparently writes a letter to Kominsky, and receives a response, encouraging her to continue drawing.

<text>FactCheck.org is a nonprofit website that aims to reduce the level of deception and confusion in U.S. politics by providing original research on misinformation and hoaxes. It is a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, and is funded primarily by the Annenberg Foundation.

Kathleen Hall Jamieson&#x27;s 1993 book &quot;Dirty Politics&quot;, in which she criticized the presidential campaigns of George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis in 1988, provided the idea for FactCheck.org.

Most of its content consists of rebuttals to inaccurate, misleading, or false claims made by politicians. FactCheck.org has also targeted misinformation from various political action committees. Other features include:
* Ask FactCheck: users can ask questions that are usually based on an online rumor.
* Viral Spiral: a page dedicated to the most popular online myths that the site has debunked. It clarifies the answer as well as links readers to a full article on the subject.
* Party Lines: talking points that have been repeatedly used by multiple members of a political party.
* Mailbag: page for readers&#x27; sent letters and praise or disapproval of something said on the site.

==History==
FactCheck.org was launched in December 2003 by Brooks Jackson, a former Associated Press, Wall Street Journal, and CNN reporter who had covered Washington and national politics since 1970. As a special assignment correspondent at CNN during the 1992 political campaign season, Jackson became well known for his &quot;Ad Police&quot; reports, which monitored candidates&#x27; advertising and financing strategies throughout the campaign. In 2003, Kathleen Hall Jamieson of the Annenberg Public Policy Center approached Jackson about forming FactCheck.org, and the site was online in December of that year.

In 2007, &quot;UnSpun&quot; was published. This book was co-written by Brooks Jackson, the director emeritus of Factcheck.org and by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center. It teaches readers how to be aware of the deceptions, or &quot;spin&quot;, that is commonly used in media and by politicians.

In January 2013, Jackson stepped down as director of FactCheck.org. He now holds the title of director emeritus. Eugene Kiely, a former reporter and editor at &quot;The Record&quot; (of Hackensack, New Jersey), &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot;, is now the site&#x27;s director. FactCheck.org employs a staff of four full-time journalists, and offers yearly fellowships to undergraduate students at the University of Pennsylvania.

In 2019, Factcheck.org celebrated its 15th anniversary.

===2004 vice-presidential debate===
FactCheck.org became a focus of political commentary following the 2004 vice-presidential debate between Dick Cheney and John Edwards. Cheney cited the website, claiming that the independent site defended his actions while CEO of Halliburton. Cheney&#x27;s claim was disputed by FactCheck.org as wrong, saying that &quot;Edwards was mostly right&quot; when talking about &quot;Cheney&#x27;s responsibility for earlier Halliburton troubles&quot;.

Cheney&#x27;s reference created some controversy because he incorrectly cited the web site&#x27;s address as &quot;FactCheck.&quot;com&quot;.&quot; At the time of the debate, factcheck.com was controlled by Frank Schilling&#x27;s company Name Administration Inc., who quickly redirected the address to point to an anti-Bush website owned by Bush critic George Soros.

===2012 presidential election===
FactCheck.org also became a focus of national attention in the summer of 2012, during the presidential race between incumbent Democrat Barack Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney. The Obama campaign ran a TV ad accusing Romney of involvement in the outsourcing of American jobs overseas by Bain Capital, the venture capital firm that he had founded in 1984. FactCheck.org ruled this ad to be false, claiming that the acts of outsourcing occurred after Romney had left the company to head the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. In response, the Obama campaign contested FactCheck.org&#x27;s ruling in a six-page letter that was distributed to major news corporations, holding that Romney still retained responsibility for the company&#x27;s actions.

=== 2016 presidential election ===
Since November 2014, FactCheck.org has published twenty-eight pages of articles checking the facts on the many 2016 presidential candidates. As of April 2016, the five remaining candidates had dedicated archives to their fact-checked claims.

In 2016, FactCheck.org became a fact-checking partner of Facebook.

The findings of the fact checking process can be seen publicly and have been broken down.

==Awards and recognition==
The site has gained recognition and won numerous awards for its contributions to political journalism. In 2004, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named FactCheck.org as one of the &quot;50 best websites 2004&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named FactCheck.org one of the &quot;25 Sites We Can&#x27;t Live Without.&quot; In 2008, &quot;PC Magazine&quot; called it one of the &quot;20 Best Political Websites.&quot; In 2009, the Association for Women in Communications awarded FactCheck.org the Clarion Awards. In 2010, FactCheck.org won the Delta-Chi-Price of the Society of Professional Journalists.

Between 2008 and 2012, the site won four Webby Awards in the Politics category, in 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012; as well as four People&#x27;s Voice Awards in Politics, in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012. FactCheck.org also won a 2010 Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists for reporting on deceptive claims made about the federal health care legislation.

<doc id="1048043" wikidata="Q1252289" url="?curid=1048043" title="Douglas F6D Missileer">
<text>The Douglas F6D Missileer was a proposed carrier-based fleet defense fighter designed by Douglas Aircraft Company in response to a 1959 United States Navy requirement. It was designed to be able to loiter for extended periods at a relatively long distance from the Navy&#x27;s aircraft carriers, engaging hostile aircraft away with its powerful radar and long-range missiles. Since the enemy would be fired on long before they reached visual range, the aircraft had little dogfighting capability and was strictly subsonic. When doubts were expressed about the Missileer&#x27;s ability to defend itself after firing its missiles, the value of the project was questioned, leading to its cancellation. Some of the Missileer&#x27;s systems, primarily the engines, radar, and missiles, continued development in spite of the cancellation, eventually emerging on the ill-fated General Dynamics–Grumman F-111B and successful Grumman F-14 Tomcat years later.

==Development==

===Background===
Through the later part of the 1950s and into the 1960s, military air planners increasingly believed that future air combat would be carried out almost entirely by long-range missile fire. This changed the basic requirements for a fighter design considerably. The pilots would be expected to fight primarily through their radar and fire control systems, hopefully never even seeing their opponent. Because of this, the emphasis was on &quot;head down&quot; combat and an all-round view was considered unimportant. Radar systems were so complex that a pilot could not be expected to operate both the aircraft and the radar, so a second crewman, the &quot;radar intercept officer&quot;, or &quot;RIO&quot;, became a common fixture.

In the case of the Navy, the primary threat to their air operations would be high-speed aircraft attacking their aircraft carriers, potentially with long-range anti-ship missiles that were assumed to have nuclear warheads. Even if detected at long distances, these aircraft would be traveling so fast that the carrier-borne interceptors simply would not have enough time to launch and attack them before they had closed with the carriers. For instance, given a range on the shipboard radars, an aircraft traveling at Mach 2, about 1,400 mph (2,300 km/h), would close from initial detection to a firing range in just over four minutes. In this time, an interceptor would have to launch, climb to altitude, maneuver into position, and fire.

One solution to this problem was to keep the interceptors in the air at all times. But given the short loiter times of high-performance aircraft like the F-4 Phantom, this would require huge fleets of fighters in order to keep a top cover in place while others were refueling. An aircraft with dramatically improved loiter times would be needed to make this approach practical. Another solution would be to increase the detection range, allowing more time for an interception. However, the detection range is largely a function of the radar horizon as seen from the radar mast, and there was little that could be done to extend this much beyond . The solution here was to mount the search radar on aircraft, pushing the range out hundreds of miles from the ships.

===Missileer forms===
In 1957, the Navy began the formal process of ordering what they referred to as a &quot;fleet defense fighter&quot;. They envisioned a large aircraft with loiter times on the order of six hours, supported by a dedicated radar aircraft providing early warning. In order to get the loiter times they wanted, the aircraft had to carry a large fuel load and was thus very large. The complex radar required dedicated operators, which resulted in a three-man crew. Additionally, they specified a side-by-side layout so both the pilot and co-pilot could concentrate on a single, centered radar display, avoiding duplication of equipment and helping reduce communications errors that could occur if they were looking at different screens. Since dogfighting was out of the question, the aircraft was strictly subsonic and did not require all-round visibility, suggesting a cockpit layout similar to the Grumman A-6 Intruder.

The process formally started in December 1958 when Bendix was awarded a contract to develop the AAM-N-10 Eagle missile system After launch, the Eagle was boosted to Mach 3.5 by a large solid-propellant rocket booster, and then after a glide period, a long-burning sustainer motor slowly increased speed to Mach 4.5. Using a lofted trajectory that flew up and over the targets at high altitudes, the missile had an effective range of . On final approach the missile activated its onboard radar, based on the AN/DPN-53 used in the CIM-10 Bomarc surface-to-air missile, using these signals for terminal active radar homing.

At the same time, Westinghouse won the contract to develop the AN/APQ-81 radar for the aircraft. This was an advanced pulse-Doppler radar system with a maximum range against bomber-sized targets at about , and was able to track eight targets at a time in its track while scan mode at up to . The radar also broadcast midcourse corrections to the missiles, and was in charge of calculating their lofted trajectories. The range of the AN/APQ-81 meant the Eagle could not be fired at its maximum effective range of , but the Eagle also had a home-on-jam capability that allowed it to attack targets at its maximum range, although this was reduced in practice as it did not use midcourse corrections and flew directly at the target at lower altitudes.

To support the fighters, an improved early warning radar aircraft was needed, and Grumman won the contract with the W2F Hawkeye. It was equipped with the AN/APS-125 radar, which had a search range of . This allowed a single Hawkeye to cover an area serviced by several of the fighters. Operators on these aircraft would pass information to the pilots of the interceptors, who would then use their own radars to lock on to the targets.

Finally, in July 1960, Douglas Aircraft won the contract for the aircraft itself, being selected over designs from North American Aviation and McDonnell Aircraft. They proposed using the relatively new turbofan engine design to improve fuel economy, and thus loiter time. Pratt &amp; Whitney was selected to start development of the TF30 to fill this role. Other than that, the F6D design was typical of subsonic designs of years earlier, like their Douglas F3D Skyknight. It featured a large cockpit area well forward on the aircraft, above the large radar and avionics section in a somewhat bulbous arrangement with windows on the front area only. The two engines were mounted on the side of the aircraft under the straight wings, and the rest of the fuselage and tail section were very simple.

===Cancellation===
In order for the F6D &quot;system&quot; to work, a large number of technologies had to work at the same time. Among these were the new engines, radar, missiles, and the supporting early warning aircraft. Development of the F6D itself was highly likely to be successful and low cost, but the system as a whole was very risky and expensive.

Throughout the program, others in the Navy questioned the entire concept. They argued that, once the Missileer had fired its missiles, it would be completely unable to defend itself, and would have to return to the carrier as quickly as possible to re-arm. During that time, its slow speed and lack of dogfighting ability would make it an easy target for any escorting forces in the strike package. These arguments eventually won out, and, when combined with a desire to cut military spending in pursuit of a balanced budget, led to the cancellation of the F6D in December 1961.

However, the idea of a long-range interceptor was accepted even by those that did not support the F6D. Around this time, the Air Force had been studying its own interceptor needs and had made some progress on their North American XF-108 Rapier design, along with supporting radars and missiles. With the ending of the Missileer, the Navy turned to these projects to see if they could be adapted to their needs. Hughes had been working on the GAR-9 Falcon, a very large missile design similar to the Eagle in many ways. Hughes was also supplying the AN/ASG-18 radar system for the F-108, and while it was less advanced than the AN/APQ-81 and lacked track-while-scan, it had even greater range.

Although the F-108 was cancelled at about the same time as the Missileer, the Air Force was interested in keeping the weapons and radar programs alive for their Lockheed F-12 interceptor project. Hughes proposed that the systems could be adapted for Navy use as well, offering a newer version of the Falcon as the AAM-N-11 Phoenix, and a modified version of the radar as the AN/AWG-9. The Navy was eventually forced to participate in the TFX joint-services program that resulted in the General Dynamics/Grumman F-111B, which would have used these systems. When the F-111B ran into intractable problems in terms of aircraft performance as an air-to-air fighter and operational difficulties as a sea-based aircraft aboard aircraft carriers, the same systems were instead fitted to the F-14 Tomcat.

The Missileer&#x27;s lasting contribution was not only its systems, but its engines. The TF30, with an afterburner, was used on both the F-111 and F-14, and turbofans are now commonplace in military jets. But while the TF30 was well-suited to the land-based fighter-bomber performance parameters of the F-111s and FB-111s operated by the U.S. Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force, it was highly susceptible to compressor stalls in high angle-of-attack flight regimes and proved to be a marginal powerplant for the U.S. Navy&#x27;s air superiority fighter-oriented F-14A Tomcat. Later versions of the F-14, the F-14B and F-14D, would replace the problematic TF30s with two General Electric F110 afterburning turbofan engines.

==Design==
The F6D-1 would have weighed approximately . It would have been powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30-P2 non-afterburning turbofan engines which were more fuel efficient than the turbojets common at the time. It would have had subsonic performance, but a loiter time of six hours on station from its carrier. Of conventional design with straight wings, and the engines in pods at the root, it resembled a larger version of the company&#x27;s earlier F3D Skyknight. The Missileer&#x27;s radar was to be the Westinghouse AN/APQ-81 pulse Doppler set, with a range of and &quot;track while scan&quot; capability. It was to be able to engage up to six targets simultaneously with the -range Eagle air-to-air missiles. The Eagle was to have a choice of conventional or nuclear warhead, and the Missileer would carry six of the weapons under its straight wings.

<doc id="1048049" wikidata="Q810663" url="?curid=1048049" title="Bastion host">
<text>A bastion host is a special-purpose computer on a network specifically designed and configured to withstand attacks, so named by analogy to the bastion, a military fortification. The computer generally hosts a single application or process, for example, a proxy server or load balancer, and all other services are removed or limited to reduce the threat to the computer. It is hardened in this manner primarily due to its location and purpose, which is either on the outside of a firewall or inside of a demilitarized zone (DMZ) and usually involves access from untrusted networks or computers. These computers are also equipped with special networking interfaces to withstand high-bandwidth attacks through the internet.

==Definitions==
The term is generally attributed to a 1990 article discussing firewalls by Marcus J. Ranum, who defined a bastion host as &quot;a system identified by the firewall administrator as a critical strong point in the network security. Generally, bastion hosts will have some degree of extra attention paid to their security, may undergo regular audits, and may have modified software&quot;.

It has also been described as &quot;any computer that is fully exposed to attack by being on the public side of the DMZ, unprotected by a firewall or filtering router. Firewalls and routers, anything that provides perimeter access control security can be considered bastion hosts. Other types of bastion hosts can include web, mail, DNS, and FTP servers. Due to their exposure, a great deal of effort must be put into designing and configuring bastion hosts to minimize the chances of penetration&quot;.

==Placement==
There are two common network configurations that include bastion hosts and their placement. The first requires two firewalls, with bastion hosts sitting between the first &quot;outside world&quot; firewall, and an inside firewall, in a DMZ. Often, smaller networks do not have multiple firewalls, so if only one firewall exists in a network, bastion hosts are commonly placed outside the firewall.

==Use cases==
Though securing remote access is the main use case of a bastion server, there are a few more use cases of a bastion host such as:
* Authentication gateway
* VPN alternative
* Alternative to internal admin tools
* Alternative to file transfers
* Alternative way to share resource credentials
* Intrusion detection
* Software inventory management

==Examples==
These are several examples of bastion host systems/services:
* DNS (Domain Name System) server
* Email server
* FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server
* Honeypot
* Proxy server
* VPN (virtual private network) server
* Web server

<text>The is a type of traditional Japanese topknot haircut worn by men. It is most commonly associated with the Edo period (1603–1868) and samurai, and in recent times with sumo wrestlers. It was originally a method of using hair to hold a samurai kabuto helmet steady atop the head in battle, and became a status symbol among Japanese society.

In a traditional Edo-period , the top of the head is shaved. The remaining hair was oiled and waxed before being tied into a small tail folded onto the top of the head in the characteristic topknot.

==History==

The origins of the can be traced back to the Heian period (794–1185). During this period, aristocrats wore special cap-like crowns as part of their official clothing. To secure the crown in place, the hair would be tied near the back of the head.

Between the 1580s (towards the end of the Warring States period, 1467–1615) and the 1630s (the beginning of the Edo period, 1603–1867), Japanese cultural attitudes to men&#x27;s hair shifted; where a full head of hair and a beard had been valued as a sign of manliness in the preceding militaristic era, in the ensuing period of peace, this gradually shifted until a beard and an unshaven pate were viewed as barbaric, and resistant of the peace that had resulted from two centuries of civil war. This change was also enforced during the Japanese invasion of Joseon (1592–1598), where some Japanese commanders forced the submitted Koreans to shave their heads to this hairstyle, as a method of converting their identities to that of Japanese.

A shaven pate (the ) became required of the samurai classes by the early Edo period, and by the 1660s, all men, commoner or samurai, were forbidden from wearing beards, with the deemed mandatory. The style of the (&quot;topknot&quot;) was dependent on the social status of the wearer, with that of the samurai being more pronounced than artisans or merchants. Ronin, samurai who did not serve a Lord, were not required to shave their heads. This became an easy way to identify such men.

Under the Meiji Restoration, the practices of the samurai classes, deemed feudal and unsuitable for modern times following the end of in 1853, resulted in a number of edicts intended to &#x27;modernise&#x27; the appearance of upper class Japanese men. With the Dampatsurei Edict of 1871 issued by Emperor Meiji during the early Meiji Era, men of the samurai classes were forced to cut their hair short, effectively abandoning the .

==Sumo==

In modern Japan, the only remaining wearers of the are sumo wrestlers and kabuki actors. Given the uniqueness of the style in modern times, the Japan Sumo Association employs specialist hairdressers called to cut and prepare sumo wrestlers&#x27; hair.

The sumo style of the is slightly different, in that the pate is no longer shaved. However, the hair may be thinned in this region or the crown of the head shaved, called , to allow the topknot to sit more neatly. This is done around once every three months.

All professional sumo wrestlers wear a as soon as their hair is long enough to do so. Sumo wrestlers with status are required on certain occasions, such as during a , to wear their hair in a more elaborate form of topknot called an , where the end of the topknot is splayed out to form a semicircle, resembling a ginkgo leaf.

The is of such symbolic importance in sumo that snipping it off is the centerpiece of a wrestler&#x27;s retirement ceremony. Dignitaries and other important people in a wrestler&#x27;s life are invited to take one snip, with the final one taken by his trainer. For most wrestlers who never reached a rank, his retirement ceremony will be the only time he wears the more elaborate .

<text>Standen is an Arts and Crafts house located to the south of East Grinstead, West Sussex, England. The house and its surrounding gardens belong to the National Trust and are open to the public. It is a Grade I listed building.

==House==
Between 1891 and 1894 architect Philip Webb, who was a friend of William Morris, designed the house for a prosperous London solicitor, James Beale, his wife Margaret, and their family of seven children. The house is constructed in the Wealden vernacular style with sandstone quarried from the estate and locally made bricks and tiles. The interior is decorated with Morris carpets, fabrics and wallpapers, with furnishings also by Morris, and the garden complements the beauty of the house. From the start the house had electric power, originally generated by a donkey engine in a shed by the old barn. The house still has its original electric light fittings, designed by William Arthur Smith Benson.

After Beale&#x27;s death in 1912, Margaret Beale continued to live at Standen. When she died in 1936, their unmarried daughter, Margaret, succeeded her, and after her death in 1947, Standen came into the possession of Helen, their youngest daughter, also unmarried. On Helen&#x27;s death in 1972 the house passed by bequest to the National Trust.

==Estate and garden==
The estate was formed from three farms which the Beales purchased in 1890. The Beales started planting a garden almost immediately after they had purchased the land, using the site of an 18th-century garden and orchard. In early 1891 trees were planted, a yew hedge established and the kitchen garden begun.

The Beales consulted a London landscape gardener, G.B. Simpson, who drew up a layout that assumed that the new house would be located on the line of the existing terrace. However, Webb suggested that it rather be placed further into the hillside. The proposed planting schemes were characterised by strict geometrical layouts of colourful flowerbeds and shrubs. Webb preferred something else, however: a mixture of natural styles combining old-fashioned formality and compartmentalised gardens. Webb also designed a number of elements in the garden.

The resulting Arts and Crafts garden used local materials for its formal elements, and loose plantings amongst yew hedges, trellis and pergolas, emphasising natural colour schemes and subtle combinations of colour and foliage.

==Standen Wood==
The National Trust acquired Standen Wood, originally part of the larger estate at the property, in 2001. The wood had been owned and managed as a nature reserve since the 1970s and is a haven for birds.

<text>A is a traditional Japanese hairdresser specializing in the theatrical arts (kabuki and ) and professional sumo. The trade is the result of a slow evolution from the traditional Japanese barbers of the Edo period, some of whom gradually started to specialize in hairstyles of actors, puppets, and . The word uses a Japanese character meaning &#x27;floor&#x27;, because in the Edo period barbers had shops on simple raised floors.

 use a variety of traditional techniques and tools, mainly combs, spikes and strings, to style the hair after oiling it. Although maintain the use of techniques inherited from the Edo period, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain a traditional practice with the gradual disappearance of the craftsmen producing the oils and tools needed for traditional hairdressing.

 maintain close relationships with those whose hair they arrange, often assigned to the particular service of a small group of people. In kabuki, this relationship leads the to choose a specialization that will lead them to follow only actors dedicated to a particular style of acting. In , the hairdressers carry out the decisions of stewards who choose the hairstyles. In sumo, are seen as essential elements of the sport, helping to maintain its traditional appearance.

==Traditional theater==
===Kabuki===

In kabuki, the hairstyle, and more specifically the wig, is an important element of the art, as no actor appears on stage without one. The craftsmen who comb the actors&#x27; hair are called . They are not responsible for creating the wigs (which is the responsibility of wig makers called the ), but for fitting and finishing them before the actors go on stage. Kabuki are the only ones to be divided into groups called and . These names were inspired by the floors of the Kabuki-za on which the work on their wigs. With each group of comes a specialization, and the &#x27;second floor&#x27; specialize in styling the hair of actors playing female roles, while the &#x27;third floor&#x27; specialize in styling male characters. Cases where a does not specialize are rare, but they do exist. Kabuki are assigned to specific actors on a full-time basis. 
======
In , puppets are coiffed like real actors. puppet theater is organized into two guilds. One, the , groups together the artists ( players, puppeteers and narrators), while the other, the National Bunraku Theatre, groups together the support professions (costume and doll-head stewards). belong to the latter organization. Unlike in kabuki, the in are responsible for both creating the wig and styling it. In , the receives instructions from the , a theater steward selecting puppet heads from about 400 options, to show subtle differences in what the characters are expressing. Once the wig has been chosen, the is then responsible for styling it to match the puppet. There are about 120 different hairstyles, with about 80 for men and 40 for women.

==Sumo==
In professional sumo, the are employed by the Japan Sumo Association to cut and prepare wrestlers&#x27; hair, which is then styled in a style. Historically, wrestlers went to public barbershops to get their hair done. However, during the Meiji era, traditional barbers gradually disappeared as Western hairstyles became fashionable. To continue styling the hair of wrestlers who had maintained the tradition of wearing the topknot, were borrowed for a time from kabuki theaters to serve wrestlers during tournaments. Eventually, became an integral part of professional sumo and began training specifically to style the wrestlers&#x27; hair.

Today, the Sumo Association employs the and ranks them according to experience and ability. There are around 50 employed by the Sumo Association at all times, but new positions can be created if a stable with more than 12 wrestlers and no hairdresser requests so. Apprentices, all men aged 15 to 19, are attached to a sumo stable like other personnel such as (referee) or (handymen). Stables that do not have their own can rely on hairdressers from other stables belonging to the same (clan) to do their wrestlers&#x27; hair. Each learns his trade from a senior member of staff. If a &#x27;s stable doesn&#x27;t have a more experienced hairdresser, a hairdresser from the same will take over the apprenticeship. must train for at least seven years before they are considered capable of working on their own. Only the most senior are entitled to prepare the more ornate , the ginkgo leaf shaped topknot which -ranked wrestlers wear in their bouts and on other formal occasions. This usually only happens after ten years&#x27; experience.

 are divided into a hierarchical system that does not follow the names of sumo divisions, unlike the and . Beginners start at and are promoted according to their years of service and skills until they reach . are not considered qualified craftsmen () until they are promoted to the rank of . Promotion to third class takes around 10 years, while promotion to second and first class takes around 20 and 30 years respectively. When promoted to second class, receive a higher salary and a bonus during tournaments. When they have reached first class and have demonstrated exceptional skill, can ascend to , or &#x27;special class&#x27; . Promotion to this rank has very strict prerequisites and the must have served for around 45 years and have demonstrated &quot;excellent talents&quot;. There is normally a maximum of two at this rank, although three special class coexisted in 2019 (Tokohachi, Tokomatsu and Tokoyodo). Special class are the only ones allowed to style the topknot of a , a sumo wrestler of the highest rank. are subject to mandatory retirement at the age of 65.

In professional sumo, work under a pseudonym that always starts with the kanji for &#x27;floor&#x27; or &#x27;bed&#x27; (, pronounced ) in their names. The rest of the &#x27;s name is usually derived from a kanji in his personal name, or from a kanji borrowed from the stable to which he belongs. Unlike , names cannot be passed on and are therefore unique. 

Special class have also appeared on the since January 2008 and in January 2012, first-class were also added. 

Wrestlers&#x27; hairstyles are so important in the culture of sumo that the profession is highly valued, with some former wrestlers employing their own hairdressers on their own money, like Taihō. Some wrestlers create close ties with their hairdresser, such as former Hakuhō, whose hair was combed throughout his career by the same , former special class Tokohachi. The importance of also extends to the founding of new stables, as their opening may be called into question if they are unable to obtain a hairdresser.

==Styling the haircut==
Depending on the environment in which they work, may use strictly traditional tools, while others have more freedom and also use modern tools. Regardless of their professional environment, all the use a special ointment called (also spelled ), renowned for its sturdiness, making it ideal for elaborate hairstyles. In sumo, the only use produced by a company in Edogawa, Tokyo. In , can make the most use of modern tools in hairstyling, such as hairsprays and hair dryers. However, they can not use oil in puppet headgear, as the puppet heads, made of cypress, would lose adhesion when color pigments are applied during restoration.

In both sumo and kabuki, the use two kinds of oil (called and ) produced specifically for the manufacture of wigs. Sumo use a ointment made traditionally from rapeseed, Japan wax and vanilla fragrance. This ointment has a distinctive scent that is associated with professional sumo.

Professional sumo and kabuki use combs and picks of various sizes. The special handmade combs are called . Generally, these tools were made in the Kyoto Prefecture, although it seems that the last company to manufacture them is now based in Nagoya. Each type of comb is made from a different type of wood. An comb is first used on the hair, followed by a to spread out the ointment and shine the hair. A is used to tidy up the hair when everything is done. A is used only to make the style of topknot, where the hair is then spread out using a metal pick called a . In sumo, it is also common for to grow a thumbnail to facilitate styling.

As of the 2020s, however, it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain the traditional tools and balms used to style the haircuts, as the craftsmen who produce them are all gradually retiring without replacement. This is notably the case of paper strings (called ) used to tie up the hair of sumo wrestlers and kabuki actors&#x27; wigs, which were made by just one craftsman in Iida, Nagano until he was forced to close down his business for good in 2020, when all activities requiring his strings (sumo, kabuki, period drama) ceased due to COVID-19. In recent years, however, a few craftsmen have taken over the traditional manufacturing activities and two craftsmen now continue to produce . Ointment for wrestlers&#x27; heads is also in short supply, with fewer and fewer companies able to manufacture it due particularly to recruitment difficulties and the lack of a market with sufficient demand, and existing family businesses are unable to continue their activities after the current managers retire.

<text>SmealSearch (now BizSeer) was a web portal, search engine and digital library for academic business documents that was originally hosted at the defunct eBusiness Research Center at the Pennsylvania State University. It was based on the CiteSeer digital library and search engine technology. Due to lack of support, it moved to the College of Information Sciences and Technology and became BizSeer. It was enhanced and modified by many including Lee Giles (project manager), Yang Sun (technical lead), Sandip Debnath, Isaac Councill, Arvind Rangaswamy, Nirmal Pal, Yves Petinot and Pradeep Teregowda.

BizSeer&#x27;s goal was to intelligently crawl and harvest academic business documents on the web and use autonomous citation indexing to permit querying by citation or by document. Currently, it was publicly available on the World Wide Web at the College of Information Sciences and Technology at the Pennsylvania State University, and has over 150,000 documents, primarily in the fields of business, and related areas. The goal was to have the document collection continuously grow. BizSeer harvested business school information from the web and created a large database of business schools from around the world. BizSeer&#x27;s goals were to assist students, professors, researchers and others with business related research and other information needs.

BizSeer, formerly SmealSearch, grew from and consumed a similar search engine, eBizSearch, designed to harvest and index academic documents related to e-business. Currently, BizSeer is no longer supported.

<text>Gorguts is a Canadian death metal band formed near Sherbrooke, Quebec, in 1989. The band has gone through various membership changes since its inception; its only constant member has been guitarist-vocalist and co-founding member Luc Lemay, who remains the driving force of the band. To date, they have released five full-length albums and one EP. Their most recent release, &quot;Pleiades&#x27; Dust&quot;, was released on May 13, 2016. Their latest full-length album, &quot;Colored Sands&quot; was released in 2013 and was nominated for a Juno Award. Musically the band is known for its complex, musically dense form of technical death metal, and has become &quot;one of the most advanced, experimental, and challenging groups in the entire genre.&quot;

==History==
===Formation, &quot;Considered Dead&quot;, and &quot;The Erosion of Sanity&quot; (1989–1993)===
Gorguts was formed in 1989 by Luc Lemay (vocals and guitar), Sylvain Marcoux (guitar), Éric Giguère (bass guitar) and Stephane Provencher (drums); the band name was suggested by one of Provencher&#x27;s friends. They released their first demo, &quot;...And Then Comes Lividity&quot;, in 1990 which led them to be signed to Roadrunner Records. Their first album, &quot;Considered Dead&quot;, had guest appearances by James Murphy (a guitar solo on &quot;Inoculated Life&quot;) and Chris Barnes (backing vocals on &quot;Bodily Corrupted&quot;, &quot;Rottenatomy&quot; and &quot;Hematological Allergy&quot;).

In 1993, they released their second album &quot;The Erosion of Sanity,&quot; which was more experimental and technical than &quot;Considered Dead.&quot; However, this coincided with the decline of death metal&#x27;s popularity as a genre, and Roadrunner Records subsequently decided to drop the band from their roster. The band ceased performing for five years, with many fans believing that they had broken up.

===&quot;Obscura&quot;, &quot;From Wisdom to Hate&quot;, MacDonald&#x27;s death and break-up (1998–2005)===
In fact, the writing for the following album had been completed by the end of 1993, but due to a lack of label interest the release of the album was severely delayed. Lemay, the only remaining original member, returned in 1998 on Olympic Recordings with a new line-up consisting of Steeve Hurdle (guitar), Steve Cloutier (bass guitar) and Patrick Robert (drums). Under this lineup they released their third full-length album, &quot;Obscura&quot;, which has come to be regarded as &quot;one of the most pungently progressive albums ever made, in or out of metal.&quot;

After &quot;Obscura&quot;, Hurdle left and was replaced by Dan Mongrain of the technical death band Martyr, and Robert was replaced by Steve MacDonald on drums. Gorguts&#x27; next album, &quot;From Wisdom to Hate&quot;, was released in 2001. This album is stylistically a mix between the earlier albums and &quot;Obscura&quot;. Lemay, the primary songwriter on the album, experimented more with the use of sounds, rather than notes, in riffs, such as the opening riff of the album, on the song &quot;Inverted&quot; which uses a combination of pick-slides, pick tapping and traditional picking.

Steve MacDonald, who had a history of recurrent depression, committed suicide in 2002, which eventually led to the split-up of Gorguts in 2005. In an interview, Lemay said that &quot;When I decided to end the band in 2002 or 2003...after Steve MacDonald passed away, I was done with music and I wanted to devote myself to woodworking full time. I was very happy with all the achievements that the band accomplished so it was all good for me...no bitterness and no feeling of unfinished business.&quot; Lemay moved away from Montreal, &quot;because I was done living there. I wanted to be closer to where I was raised and be closer to nature in a way. After Steve&#x27;s death I wasn&#x27;t interested in playing music anymore. I was very content with the musical legacy of the band at that point and I was ready to start a new chapter in my life.&quot;

===Reformation and &quot;Colored Sands&quot; (2008–2014)===

In 2006, Steeve Hurdle asked Lemay to join Hurdle&#x27;s band Negativa. Lemay accepted &quot;on the condition that everything would be low key. It was all about having fun playing music for me. After a rehearsal Steeve pointed out that it would be cool to make a new Gorguts record to commemorate Gorguts&#x27; 20 years of existence. I was all for it and from that point the idea came to play with John (Longstreth – drums), Kevin (Hufnagel – guitar) and Colin (Marston – bass) and create a new record.&quot;

In December 2008, a Gorguts demo track with guitar and programmed drums surfaced online, and Lemay himself confirmed an upcoming reunion with Colin Marston, Kevin Hufnagel and John Longstreth. While the new Gorguts had been performing live and writing new material, Lemay said that the band would not be recording until &quot;late fall&quot; 2010 with a release date some time in 2011; In May 2012, Steeve Hurdle died from post-surgical complications. Legal issues surrounding the band&#x27;s previous contract to Olympic Records delayed the release of the album. Olympic were taken over by Century Media, and Lemay wanted to renegotiate the band&#x27;s contract. &quot;They agreed to, but in the end, we didn&#x27;t see eye to eye on things and we mutually agreed it was better to go our separate ways. Dissolving the contract was a very time consuming and complicated legal affair.&quot;

The band signed to Season of Mist and revealed that its forthcoming album would be titled &quot;Colored Sands&quot;, which was released on August 30, 2013. Inspired by Opeth and the album &quot;The Incident&quot; by Porcupine Tree, Lemay intended to write more progressive songs with longer running times and increased dynamics. The classical piece &quot;The Battle of Chamdo&quot; was written by Lemay on piano and recorded with a string quintet. &quot;Colored Sands&quot; was nominated for a Juno Award.

=== &quot;Pleiades&#x27; Dust&quot; (2014–2019) ===
John Longstreth, whose schedule with Origin was incompatible with Gorguts, departed the band in 2014. His replacement was Patrice Hamelin, who had been performing live with Gorguts since 2011. Lemay announced that Gorguts was working on a new album that would consist of one long song. &quot;Pleiades&#x27; Dust&quot;, the resulting EP, was released on May 13, 2016. It is a concept album about the House of Wisdom in Baghdad during Europe&#x27;s Dark Ages, and is the band&#x27;s first recording with Hamelin.

On July 25, 2016, the band announced that they would be touring North America in October 2016 with Intronaut and Brain Tentacles in support of &quot;Pleiades&#x27; Dust&quot;. Following this tour, Gorguts entered another period of relative inactivity.

=== Upcoming album (2020–present) ===
On June 29, 2020, Luc Lemay announced that Gorguts was returning from yet another hiatus and was beginning work on a new album. The band announced a new line-up and live work for 2024. 

== Musical style and legacy ==

Gorguts&#x27; style of metal has evolved considerably since the formation of the band, evolving from a relatively straightforward death metal sound into an increasingly complex style of avant-garde technical death metal. More recently, the band&#x27;s music is characterised by technically demanding, structurally complex songwriting, with strong use of dissonant and atonal guitarwork. Luc Lemay has noted the influence of Opeth, Deathspell Omega, and Porcupine Tree on his more recent songwriting.

The band&#x27;s early music, particularly their debut album &quot;Considered Dead&quot; in 1991, is characterised by a relatively straightforward death metal sound, with conventional instrumentation and song structures. Lemay credits Swedish death metal band Entombed as a major influence on this album. However, on their second album &quot;The Erosion of Sanity&quot; in 1993, the band began to experiment more, incorporating pianos and acoustic guitars into their sound. The band took a break after this album but reformed with a new lineup and released &quot;Obscura&quot; in 1998. &quot;Obscura&quot; represented a significant shift in the band&#x27;s style of music, often attributed to then-guitarist Steeve Hurdle. The album made increasing use of complex song structures, unorthodox sounds, dissonant guitarwork, unconventional time signatures, and esoteric lyrical themes. &quot;Even by today&#x27;s standards &quot;Obscura&quot; is considered to be one of the most complex and technical records in the genre, due to its unprecedented dissonance and experimentation brought by the band&#x27;s late guitarist Steeve Hurdle.&quot; The following album, 2001&#x27;s &quot;From Wisdom to Hate&quot;, represents a balance between &quot;Obscura&quot; and the previous album &quot;The Erosion of Sanity&quot;. The complexity and unpredictability of the song structures were scaled back, while still incorporating technically complex compositions, leading to a slightly more streamlined sound. The band&#x27;s next album, 2013&#x27;s &quot;Colored Sands&quot;, represents a significant evolution in this style of metal, with critics noting that the &quot;huge wall of dissonant lead work and dizzying rhythm riffs have been crafted into something far more atmospheric, but with the heaviness and weight only Gorguts could take to this level, making Colored Sands not only near-immaculately put together, but perhaps one of the most absorbing albums of their genre.&quot;

Gorguts&#x27; influence on metal has been extensive. They are routinely credited as being key pioneers in the use of dissonance and atonality in metal. They are considered key influences on a range of bands, including Ulcerate, Spawn of Possession, Obscura, Beyond Creation, and many others. Obscura is named after the Gorguts album of the same name.

<doc id="1048084" wikidata="Q7641749" url="?curid=1048084" title="Sunwise">
<text>Sunwise, sunward or deasil (sometimes spelled &quot;deosil&quot;), are terms meaning to go clockwise or in the direction of the sun, as seen from the northern hemisphere. The opposite term is &quot;widdershins&quot; (Lowland Scots), or &quot;tuathal&quot; (Scottish Gaelic). In Scottish culture, this turning direction is also considered auspicious, while the converse is true for counter-clockwise motion.

==Irish culture==

During the days of Gaelic Ireland and of the Irish clans, the Psalter known as was used as both a rallying cry and protector in battle by the Chiefs of Clan O&#x27;Donnell. Before a battle it was customary for a chosen monk or holy man (usually attached to the Clan McGroarty and who was in a state of grace) to wear the Cathach and the cumdach, or book shrine, around his neck and then walk three times sunwise around the warriors of Clan O&#x27;Donnell.

According to folklorist Kevin Danaher, on St. John&#x27;s Eve in Ulster and Connaught, it was customary to light a bonfire at sunset and to walk sunwise around the fire while praying the rosary. Those who could not afford a rosary would keep tally by holding a small pebble during each prayer and throwing it into the bonfire as each prayer was completed.

Similar praying of the rosary or other similar prayers while walking sunwise around Christian pilgrimage shrines or holy wells is also traditional in Irish culture during pattern days.

==Scottish culture==
This is descriptive of the ceremony observed by the druids, of walking round their temples by the south, in the course of their directions, always keeping their temples on their right. This course (&quot;diasil&quot; or &quot;deiseal&quot;) was deemed propitious, while the contrary course is perceived as fatal, or at least unpropitious. From this ancient superstition are derived several Gaelic customs which were still observed around the turn of the twentieth century, such as drinking over the left thumb, as Toland expresses it, or according to the course of the sun.

Similarly to the pre-battle use of the Cathach of St. Columba in Gaelic Ireland, the Brecbannoch of St Columba, a reliquary containing the partial human remains of the Saint, was traditionally carried three times sunwise around Scottish armies before they gave battle. The most famous example of this was during the Scottish Wars of Independence, shortly before the Scots under Robert the Bruce faced the English army at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. 

Martin Martin says:

The use of the sunwise circle was also traditional in the Highlands during Christian pilgrimages in honour of St Máel Ruba, particularly to the shrine where he is said to have established a hermitage upon Isle Maree.

==&quot;Deosil&quot; and other spellings==
Wicca uses the spelling &quot;deosil&quot;, which violates the Gaelic orthography principle that a consonant must be surrounded by either broad vowels (a, o, u) or slender vowels (e, i). The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives precedence to the spelling &quot;deasil&quot;, which violates the same principle, but acknowledges &quot;deiseal&quot;, &quot;deisal&quot;, and &quot;deisul&quot; as well.

==Other cultures==
This distinction exists in traditional Tibetan religion. Tibetan Buddhists go round their shrines sunwise, but followers of Bonpo go widdershins. The former consider Bonpo to be merely a perversion of their practice, but Bonpo adherents claim that their religion, as the indigenous one of Tibet, was doing this prior to the arrival of Buddhism in the country.

The Hindu &quot;pradakshina&quot;, the auspicious circumambulation of a temple, is also made clockwise.

<text>The Boeing Bird of Prey is an American black project aircraft, intended to demonstrate stealth technology. It was developed by McDonnell Douglas and Boeing in the 1990s. The company provided $67 million of funding for the project; it was a low-cost program compared to many other programs of similar scale. It developed technology and materials which would later be used on Boeing&#x27;s X-45 unmanned combat air vehicle. As an internal project, this aircraft was not given an X-plane designation. There are no public plans to make this a production aircraft. It is characterized as a technology demonstrator.

==Design and development==

Development of the Bird of Prey began in 1992 by McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s Phantom Works division for special projects, at Area 51. The aircraft&#x27;s name is a reference to the Klingon Bird of Prey warship from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series. Phantom Works later became part of Boeing Integrated Defense Systems after the Boeing–McDonnell Douglas merger in 1997.

The first flight was in 1996, and 39 more flights were performed through the program&#x27;s conclusion in 1999. The Bird of Prey was designed to prevent shadows and is believed to have been used to test active camouflage, which would involve its surfaces changing color or luminosity to match the surroundings.

Because it was a demonstration aircraft, the Bird of Prey used a commercial off-the-shelf turbofan engine and manual hydraulic controls rather than fly-by-wire. This shortened the development time and greatly reduced its cost. (A production aircraft would have computerized controls.)

The shape is aerodynamically stable enough to be flown without computer correction. Its aerodynamic stability is in part due to lift provided by the chines, as used in other aircraft including the SR-71 Blackbird. This provided lift for the nose in flight. This configuration, which can be stable without a horizontal tailplane and a conventional vertical rudder, is now a standard in later stealth unmanned aerial vehicles such as the X-45 and X-47, tailless aircraft which use drag rudders (asymmetrically used wingtip airbrakes) for yaw control.

The aircraft, which had given the designation &quot;YF-118G&quot; as a cover, was made public on October 18, 2002.

==Aircraft on display==

The Bird of Prey was put on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio on July 16, 2003. It is now on display at the museum&#x27;s Modern Flight Gallery above their F-22 Raptor.

<text>Several councils were held at Quierzy, a royal residence under the Carolingians, but now an insignificant village on the Oise in the French Department of Aisne in Picardy. The synod of September 838, ordered the monks of the abbey of Saint-Calais in the Diocese of Le Mans to return to their monastery, from which they falsely claimed to have been expelled by their bishop. It also condemned some of the liturgical opinions of Amalarius of Metz. 

The two succeeding councils, held respectively in 849 and 853, dealt with Gottschalk and his peculiar teaching respecting predestination. The first of these meetings sentenced the recalcitrant monk to corporal castigation, deposition from the priestly office and imprisonment; his books were to be burned. At the second synod (853) the famous four decrees or chapters (&quot;capitula&quot;) drawn up by Hincmar on the predestination question were published. They asserted:
* the predestination of some to salvation, and, in consequence of Divine foreknowledge, the doom of others to everlasting punishment;
* the remedy for the evil tendencies of free will through grace;
* the Divine intention of saving all men;
* the fact of universal redemption.

The council held in February 857 aimed at suppressing the disorders then so prevalent in the kingdom of Charles the Bald. The synod in 858 was attended by the bishops who remained loyal to Charles the Bald during the invasion of his dominions by Louis the German. It addressed a firm but conciliatory letter to the invader stating its attitude towards him for the intentions which he expressed, but which his actions belied. Incidentally, it provides a &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; for the forgeries known as the False Decretals, which were quoted on the question of immunity for Church property.

<doc id="1048094" wikidata="Q2006357" url="?curid=1048094" title="Rowlatt Act">
<text>The Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act of 1919, popularly known as the Rowlatt Act, was a law, applied during the British India period. It was a legislative council act passed by the Imperial Legislative Council in Delhi on 18 
March 1919, indefinitely extending the emergency measures of preventive indefinite detention, imprisonment without trial and judicial review enacted in the Defence of India Act 1915 during the First World War. It was enacted in the light of a perceived threat from revolutionary nationalists of re-engaging in similar conspiracies as had occurred during the war which the Government felt the lapse of the Defence of India Act would enable.
==Purpose and introduction==
The British Colonial Government passed the &quot;Rowlatt Act&quot; which gave power to the police to arrest any person without any reason. The purpose of the Act was to curb the growing nationalist upsurge in the country. Mahatma Gandhi called upon the people to perform &quot;satyagraha&quot; against the act.
Passed on the recommendations of the Rowlatt Committee and named after its president, Sir Sidney Rowlatt, the act effectively authorized the colonial British government to imprison any person suspected of terrorism living in British India for up to two years, and gave the colonial authorities power to deal with all revolutionary activities.

The unpopular legislation provided for stricter control of the press, arrests without warrant, indefinite detention without trial, and juryless &quot;in camera&quot; trials for proscribed political acts. The accused were denied the right to know the accusers and the evidence used in the trial. Those convicted were required to deposit securities upon release, and were prohibited from taking part in any political, educational, or religious activities.
On the report of the committee, headed by Justice Rowlatt, two bills were introduced in the Central Legislature on 6 February 1919. These bills came to be known as &quot;Black Bills&quot;. They gave enormous powers to the police to search a place and arrest any person they disapproved of without warrant. Despite much opposition, the Rowlatt Act was passed on 18 March 1919. The purpose of the act was to curb the growing nationalist upsurge in the country. Under the Rowlatt act 1919, the chief justice was empowered to decide on the immediate custody of the accused between the trial and release on bail for smooth implementation of the act. The act also provides a penalty for disobedience of any order promulgated

==Effect==
Mahatma Gandhi, among other Indian leaders, was extremely critical of the Act and argued that not everyone should be punished in response to isolated political crimes. Madan Mohan Malaviya, Mazarul Haque and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, a member of the All-India Muslim League resigned from the Imperial legislative council in protest against the act. The act also infuriated many other Indian leaders and the public, which caused the government to implement repressive measures.Gandhi and others thought that constitutional opposition to the measure was fruitless, so on 6 April, a hartal took place. This was an event in which Indians suspended businesses and went on strikes and would fast, pray and hold public meetings against the &#x27;Black Act&#x27; as a sign of their opposition and civil disobedience would be offered against the law. Mahatma Gandhi bathed in the sea at Mumbai and made a speech before a procession to Madhav Baug temple took place. This event was part of the Non-cooperation movement. One of the largest protests occurred in Ambala, Punjab Province in early 1919 under the chairmanship of the lawyer Jhanda Singh Giani. 

It was the Rowlatt Act which brought Gandhi to the mainstream of the Indian struggle for independence and ushered in the Gandhian Era of Indian politics. Jawaharlal Nehru described Gandhi&#x27;s entry into the protests in his Glimpses of World History:

Early in 1919 he was very ill. He had barely recovered from it when the Rowlatt Bill agitation filled the country. He also joined his voice to the universal outcry. But this voice was somehow different from others. It was quiet and low, and yet it could be heard above the shouting of the multitude; it was soft and gentle , and yet there seemed to be steel hidden away somewhere in it; it was courteous and full of appeal, and yet there was something grim and frightening in it; every word used was full of meaning and seemed to carry a deadly earnestness. Behind the language of peace and friendship there was power and quivering shadow of action and a determination not to submit to a wrong...This was something very different from our daily politics of condemnation and nothing else, long speeches always ending in the same futile and ineffective resolutions of protest which nobody took very seriously. This was the politics of action, not of talk.
However, the success of the hartal in Delhi, on 30 March, was overshadowed by tensions running high, which resulted in rioting in the Punjab, Delhi and Gujarat. Deciding that Indians were not ready to make a stand consistent with the principle of nonviolence, an integral part of &quot;satyagraha&quot; (disobeying the British colonial government&#x27;s laws without using violence), Gandhi suspended the resistance.

The Rowlatt Act came into effect on 21 March 1919. In Punjab the protest movement was very strong, and on 10 April two leaders of the congress, Dr. Satyapal and Saifuddin Kitchlew, were arrested and taken secretly to Dharamsala. On 13 April people from neighbouring villages gathered for Baisakhi Day celebrations and to protest against their deportation in Amritsar. Subsequently, the army was called into Punjab, which resulted in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919.

==Revocation==
Accepting the report of the Repressive Laws Committee, the British colonial government repealed the Rowlatt Act, the Press Act, and twenty-two other laws in March 1922.

<doc id="1048095" wikidata="Q1571081" url="?curid=1048095" title="Orthokeratology">
<text>Orthokeratology, also referred to as Night lenses, Ortho-K, OK, Overnight Vision Correction, Corneal Refractive Therapy (CRT), Accelerated Orthokeretology, Cornea Corrective Contacts, Eccentricity Zero Molding, and Gentle Vision Shaping System (GVSS), is the use of gas-permeable contact lenses that temporarily reshape the cornea to reduce refractive errors such as myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism.

==History==
Doctors discovered the reshaping phenomena of glass lenses as early as the 1940s. This history of orthokeratology includes contributions made by multiple authors to the use of contact lenses for myopia reduction.

George Jessen created what was probably the first orthokeratology design in the 1960s made from PMMA material, which he marketed as &quot;Orthofocus&quot;. These early designs had generally unpredictable results, leading to the belief that applied orthokeratology was more art or luck than science. Many groups and individuals claim to have been the first to develop modern orthokeratology solutions. However, Dr. Richard Wlodyga, Dr. Philip B. Hanisch and Nick Stoyan, in particular, are generally credited with developing the first reverse zone lens design in the 1980s.

However, it was not until computerized corneal topography became available during the 1990s that it became possible to apply the theory to create designs with repeatable results through being able to accurately map the surface curvature of the cornea using a non-invasive, painless imaging procedure. Additionally, the development of new base materials for rigid gas permeable lenses which provided much higher levels of oxygen permeability opened up the possibility of orthokeratology becoming an overnight procedure rather than being used for daytime wear alone. Finally, the introduction of computer-controlled precision lathes meant that lens designs could be manufactured to sub-micrometer levels of accuracy thereby offering the prospect of high volume production becoming commercially viable.

Nightwear ortho-k solutions were available to consumers in many countries outside the US much earlier than within the US, due to international differences between regulatory controls and bodies. In 1994, the FDA granted the first ever daily wear approval for a lens indicated for Orthokeratology to a type of lens called the Contex OK-Lens. In June 2002, the FDA granted approval for overnight wear of a type of corneal reshaping called &quot;Corneal Refractive Therapy&quot; (CRT), more than fifteen years after Europe.

=== Professional organizations ===
In the summer of 2000, at an educational meeting of optometrists in Toronto, the Orthokeratology Academy of America (OAA) was formed to support, promote and advance orthokeratology. In parallel, the British Orthokeratology Society (BOKS) was established in the UK with similar objectives to promote orthokeratology as a new procedure to correct myopia. The Orthokeratology Society of Oceania (OSO), formerly known as the Orthokeratology Society of Australia (OSA), is an Australia-based association of orthokeratology optometrists and researchers representing Australia and the South Pacific region.

=== Research into slowing of myopia progression in children ===
In 2006 and 2007, papers presented at the British Contact Lens Association and the Global Orthokeratology Symposium indicated the possibility of orthokeratology slowing or stopping myopic progression. This was found to be effective in children in Hong Kong and is the subject of wider study to verify this data. Multiple other research evidence suggest that the reduction in myopic progression is roughly 50%, comparable to that of 0.01% atropine treatment, with remaining uncertainty regarding possible rebound effect after the Ortho-K use is discontinued.

==Mechanism and use==
Tissue growth and propagation studies indicate that epithelial cells adjust growth in response to presence of a foreign material. CRT lens proximity to the cells therefore is thought to stimulate cell growth where less RoR proximity coincides with added growth and more proximity coincides with growth repression thereby creating a &#x27;proximal pressure&#x27; on the epithelial cells.

The orthokeratology website &quot;ortho-k.net&quot; explains in lay-terms that the mechanism behind ortho-k is that around 60% of the eye&#x27;s focusing power is provided by the cornea, and this is extremely sensitive to very small changes: 6 μm flattening of corneal thickness (around 5% of the thickness of a human hair) results in 1 diopter of changed vision in myopia. Therefore, a specially shaped lens can be used to lightly press the cornea, causing it gradually to be reshaped to the correct shape for focused vision. The corrective effect lasts up to 72 hours once initially acclimatized, which is long enough to be a practical means of eyesight correction. There is some evidence (see above) that unlike other eyesight correction mechanisms, Ortho-K may also reduce future or ongoing eyesight changes or increased myopia, although this is still being researched.

Risks are comparable to or safer than ordinary contact lenses, since they are typically worn for much shorter periods (6–8 hours rather than daytime or 24/7) and while asleep rather than while active. They also compare favorably to surgical correction since no surgery is involved, corrections to the eye&#x27;s shape can be handled over time (surgery corrects vision at a single point in time, but post-operative ongoing changes to eyesight will continue to occur during the patient&#x27;s lifetime), and it is considered generally safe for younger patients. In addition, Ortho-K is broadly not &#x27;new&#x27; from a safety viewpoint; contact lens safety generally speaking is considered to be well understood. However it is important, as with all contact lenses, to maintain good cleaning and hygiene discipline.

Rigid lenses are generally considered to be not as comfortable as soft lenses, but Ortho-K is claimed to avoid the feeling during waking hours of the eyelids moving over the lens edges while blinking. When Ortho-K lenses are worn, the eyes are closed for sleep, although the same issues that accompany wearing contact lenses during sleep (rapid eye movements and lower tear production) remain.

=== Adaptation, success rates, and discontinuation ===
The cornea experiences a significant degree of adaptation within hours to days, although full adaptation often requiring 2 – 3 weeks. During this initial period vision may be affected for some people. Once adapted, FDA trials showed over 65% of patients achieved 20/20 eyesight and over 90% achieved 20/40 or better (the typical US requirement for driving without glasses).

The corrective effect is stable but not permanent. Left to itself, the eye will slowly lose its adjusted shape, taking approximately 3 days to return to its former vision. The Ortho-K lenses must therefore be worn regularly so the corrected corneal shape is preserved and maintained. Usually they are worn only for part of the day (typically only when asleep at night); some users may only need to use them one night out of every two or three nights.

==Health considerations ==

===Indications and counter-indications===
The US FDA overnight orthokeratology is approved up to -6.00 diopters of myopia and a maximum of 1.75 diopters of astigmatism.

In the United Kingdom, the procedure is offered primarily for myopic correction up to −5.00 diopters and up to −1.50 diopters of astigmatism. Fitting evidence for the leading lens designs indicates that procedures undertaken within these parameters have the highest probability of success. Some patients with higher degrees of myopia are successfully treated by specialist practitioners with &quot;off-label&quot; uses of these same lenses.

In South Africa, Australia and Taiwan, practitioners using the GOV orthokeratology system have achieved successful fits as high as −10.00D of myopia and +5.00D of hyperopia. Not every patient within these parameters will be suitable for the procedure and conditions such as flat or steep corneas may result in the procedure being less successful.

Counter-indications may include:
* Inflammations or infection of the anterior segment of the eye or the cornea
* Disease, injury or abnormality affecting the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelid, or impacting contact lens wear
* Very dry eyes or low eye moisture
* Corneal hypoesthesia (low sensitivity)
* Eye related allergies, including allergies to contact lens solutions

===Adverse effects===
During the first month of lens wear when the treatment zone on the surface of the cornea is in the process of becoming fully formed, some users may experience vision issues such as ghosting, double vision, contrast problems and/or starbursting, especially at night. These issues are generally resolved by the end of the first month of lens wear. If these issues persist beyond this initial period, the cause may be due to lack of centration of the lens on the eye and/or overly large pupil size (in light or dark). Resolution may be possible through redesign, material changes, better eye moisture retention (night eye masks, duct blocking, etc.) or other techniques.

Orthokeratology showed few severe side-effects, according to a March 2004 report of a very small sample of cases in China where supply of lenses at that time was not subject to any regulatory regime covering safety and efficacy. More typically, complications can occur due to the patient&#x27;s failure to follow appropriate hygiene recommendations when handling or cleaning the lenses. One common issue being the use of tap water to rinse (although some systems allow for or suggest the use of &quot;clean&quot; tap water) or store as this may cause unwanted buildup of minerals on the contact as well as other issues. Complications may also be due to relative corneal hypoxia (lack of oxygen) with prolonged or overnight contact lens wear in lenses made from the wrong material. However, the use of high or hyper oxygen-permeable materials as approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) significantly reduces hypoxia, and these are the materials that are normally used in orthokeratology.

Safety advice applicable to most modes of contact lens wear, also applies to ortho-k night-time lenses. An article in the January 2005 issue of &quot;Eye &amp; Contact Lens: Science &amp; Clinical Practice&quot; discusses two case reports of children who developed corneal ulcers when fit with Paragon CRT contact lenses, which were worn nightly. Each patient presented with a bacterial corneal ulcer after wearing CRT contact lenses for less than 6 months. In the first patient, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; was identified as the causative organism. In the second patient, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; was cultured from the ulcer. Both patients were treated with antibiotics, resulting in a rapid resolution of the corneal ulcers and preservation of vision. The writers conclude that &quot;Paragon CRT lenses have been approved for use in patients of all ages. When used in children, these lenses may present unique problems. The absolute incidence of bacterial corneal ulcers in patients with CRT lenses are unknown. Severe caution should be used before prescribing CRT lenses for children and informed consent should include potential sight-threatening corneal ulcers.&quot; Although sight threatening corneal ulcers are rare, informed consent should routinely be obtained for all new contact lens wearers, whether worn overnight or not.

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported two cases in Canada in which Acanthamoeba infections during ortho-k treatment, possibly related to rinsing the lenses in tap water, led to temporary or permanent blindness.

==Lens types==
Orthokeratology lenses are made by a number of companies and all use special gas-permeable contact lenses to reshape the cornea. The lens material – and especially its oxygen permeability measured by its &#x27;Dk&#x27; rating (the higher the value, the greater the degree of oxygen permeability) – is important for maintaining eye-health during the treatment.

Materials and methods vary globally, as does individual country approval. For example, lenses &quot;Menicon Z Night&quot; are generally used overnight only, but in USA they are also FDA-approved for up to 30-day wear, on a regular GP schedule.

Some practitioners have also designed their own orthokeratology lenses typically by using various software packages which combine corneal topographical data with the practitioners&#x27; own knowledge and experience to determine the appropriate lens parameters for individual patient prescriptions. These practitioners are obviously doing so &quot;off-label&quot; since their designs are not approved for safety by the FDA.

<text>Horsey Windpump is a windpump or drainage windmill in the care of the National Trust in the village of Horsey, on The Broads near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, England. The structure is a grade II* listed building.

== History ==

The present structure was built in 1912 on the foundations of the 18th-century Horsey Black Mill.

The windpump was working until it was struck by lightning in 1943. It was acquired by the National Trust in 1948 from the Buxton Family and has been restored. The mill&#x27;s damaged sails were removed in 1956, and replacement sails and fantail were installed in 1962. The Great Storm of 1987 caused further damage, and repair works were required before the building could reopen to visitors in 1990.

Having succumbed to the ravages of time and the elements, the sails were removed again in 2014. A restoration project started in 2016 to repair and reinstate the cap and sails, with the ambition of restoring the Windpump to full working order. Finally, after a four-month wait of unsuccessful tests in unfavourable wind, the sails eventually turned on the evening of Wednesday 29 May 2019 for the first time since 1943. This restoration work was awarded &#x27;Building Conservation Project of the Year 2019&#x27; at The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) regional awards.

But whilst the sails have now turned successfully, this was only the first step in testing the sails with more shutters needing to be added and putting them through their paces in different wind conditions. The hope is that the sails will be turning regularly for visitors later on in the year.

The Buxton family continue to manage the Horsey estate, emphasising nature conservation. Because of this, the estate has become an internationally important wildlife site. On the estate there are waymarked circular walks, the main one being the path via Brograve Mill; the walk provides great views across Horsey Mere and access to the beach at Horsey Gap. There are many windmills in this particular area, including West Somerton Mill, Heigham Holmes Mill, Brograve Mill, and Lambrigg Mill. Horsey Windpump is open daily from March to October.

<text>Nicolaas Thomas Bernhard (; 9 February 1931 – 12 February 1989) was an Austrian novelist, playwright, poet and polemicist who is considered one of the most important German-language authors of the postwar era. He explored themes of death, isolation, obsession and illness in controversial literature that was pessimistic about the human condition and highly critical of post-war Austrian and European culture. He developed a distinctive prose style often featuring multiple perspectives on characters and events, idiosyncratic vocabulary and punctuation, and long monologues by protagonists on the verge of insanity.

Born in the Netherlands to his unwed Austrian mother, for much of his childhood he lived with his maternal grandparents in Austria and in boarding homes in Austria and Nazi Germany. He was closest to his grandfather, the novelist Johannes Freumbichler, who introduced him to literature and philosophy. As a youth, he contracted pleurisy and tuberculosis and lived with debilitating lung disease for the rest of his life. While recovering in a sanatorium he began writing poetry and stories and met Hedwig Stavianicek, a wealthy heiress who supported his literary ambitions and whom he later described as the most important person in his life.

After his breakthrough novel &quot;Frost&quot; (1963), he established himself over the next twenty years as a leading novelist and playwright in German. His major works include the novels &quot;Correction&quot; (1975) and &quot;Extinction&quot; (1986) and his memoirs &quot;Gathering Evidence&quot; (197582). George Steiner called him &quot;at his best, the foremost craftsman of German prose after Kafka and Musil&quot;. He influenced the Austrian vernacular and a younger generation of Austrian writers including Elfriede Jelinek.

Bernhard was controversial in Austria for his public polemics against what he saw as his homeland&#x27;s post-war cultural pretensions, antisemitism, provincialism and denial of its Nazi past. While critics labelled him a &quot;Nestbeschmutzer&quot; (one who fouls his own nest), he described himself as a troublemaker. He died of heart failure in his apartment in Gmunden, Upper Austria, in February 1989. Controversy extended beyond his death when it was revealed that his will sought to prohibit the publication or performance of his works in Austria for 70 years.

== Life and work ==

=== Early life (19311950) ===
Thomas Bernhard was born on 9 February 1931 in Heerlen, the Netherlands, where his unmarried Austrian mother, Herta Bernhard, worked as a maid. In the autumn of 1931, Herta took Thomas to Vienna to live with her parents: Anna Bernhard and her de facto husband, the novelist Johannes Freumbichler. (Thomas never met his biological father, Alois Zuckerstätter, who refused to acknowledge him and committed suicide in 1940.)

In 1935, Herta&#x27;s parents moved with Thomas to Seekirchen, near Salzburg. In 1936, Herta married Emil Fabjan and the following year moved with him and Thomas to Traunstein, Bavaria, in Nazi Germany. Fabjan never adopted Thomas, and Bernhard always referred to him as his guardian rather than his stepfather. Herta&#x27;s parents moved to the nearby village of Ettendorf in 1939. Bernhard was closest to his grandfather and later called him &quot;an anarchist, if only in spirit.&quot; Freumbichler introduced Bernhard to literature and philosophy and was a major influence on his life.

Bernhard was miserable in the Nazi school system where he was required to join the &quot;Deutsches Jungvolk&quot;, a branch of the Hitler Youth, which he hated. At age eight, he was sent to a home for maladjusted children and at age 12 to a boarding school in Salzburg where he experienced allied bombing raids. After the war, the Fabjan and Freumbichler families moved to Salzburg where Bernhard continued his schooling. In 1947, Bernhard left school to start an apprenticeship with a grocer.

Bernhard took private singing lessons and aspired to become an opera singer. In early 1949, he developed pleurisy and was eventually diagnosed with tuberculosis. He stayed in various hospitals and sanatoriums until January 1951. Bernhard&#x27;s grandfather died in 1949 and his mother died of cancer the following year.

In 1950, while staying at the Grafenhof sanatorium in Sankt Veit im Pongau, Bernhard met Hedwig Stavianicek (1894–1984), a wealthy heiress who was more than thirty-seven years his senior. Stavianicek was to provide him with financial and emotional support and introductions to patrons of art and culture. Bernhard later called her his &quot;Lebensmensch&quot; (a predominantly Austrian term coined by Bernhard which refers to the most important person in one&#x27;s life). He cared for her in her home in Vienna in the last months of her life in 1984.

=== Literary apprenticeship (19511963) ===
From 1951 to 1955, Bernhard worked as a court reporter and cultural journalist for the Salzburg newspaper &quot;Demokratisches Volksblatt&quot;. He continued his private singing lessons and had poems and short stories published in the &quot;Volksblatt&quot; and other publications. In late 1955, he published a scathing critique of the Salzburger Landestheater and the ensuing controversy ended his journalistic career. From autumn 1955 to 1957, with the financial support of Stavianicek, he studied acting and singing at the Salzburg Mozarteum. There he met a music student Ingrid Bülau. They became lifelong friends and at one point considered marriage.

From 1956 to 1960, Bernhard was associated with the literary and cultural groups centred on the magazine &quot;Stimmen der Gegenwart&quot; (Voices of the Present) and the composer Gerhard Lampersberg and his wife, the singer Maja Lampersberg. At this time, Bernhard&#x27;s first volumes of poetry were published: &quot;Auf der Erde und in der Hölle&quot; (On Earth and in Hell, 1957), &quot;In hora mortis&quot; (at the hour of death, 1958), and &quot;Unter dem Eisen des Mondes&quot; (Under the Steely Moon, 1958). His libretto for Gerhard Lampersberg&#x27;s &quot;Die Rosen der Einöde&quot; (Roses of the Wasteland) was also published in 1958.

From 1960 to 1963 Bernhard travelled extensively in Austria, England and mainland Europe. In 1962, he wrote a novel &quot;Frost&quot;, which was revised and published in 1963.

=== Established author (19631978) ===
Bernhard&#x27;s poetry received little critical attention but &quot;Frost&quot; sparked controversy and divided critical opinion. Novelist Carl Zuckmayer praised the novel and it won the Julius Campe Prize and the Bremen Literature Prize. Bernhard&#x27;s novella &quot;Amras&quot; was published in 1964 and, according to biographer Gitta Honegger, consolidated his favourable critical reputation. In 1965, Bernhard bought a disused farmhouse in Obernathal, Upper Austria. For the rest of his life he divided most of his time between his farmhouse and Stavianicek&#x27;s apartment in Vienna.

In 1967, after completing his second novel &quot;Gargoyles,&quot; Bernhard had surgery to remove a tumour from his lungs and spent several months recovering in the Baumgartnerhöhe sanatorium. The following year he was awarded the Austrian Little State Prize for emerging talent. His acceptance speech, in which he stated: &quot;We are Austrians, we are apathetic; we are life as crass disinterest in life; in the process of nature we are megalomania...&quot; caused an uproar and an angry response from the Austrian minister for culture. The following year, the ceremony for the Anton Wildgans Prize was cancelled when the organisers learned that Bernhard intended to deliver a revised version of the same speech.

In 1970, Bernhard&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lime Works&quot; was published and his first professionally produced play, &quot;A Party for Boris&quot;, premiered at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus, Hamburg. The production was overseen by German director Claus Peymann who went on to direct most of Bernhard&#x27;s premiers. &quot;The Lime Works&quot; and &quot;A Party for Boris&quot; earned Bernhard the Georg Büchner Prize. When Bernhard was awarded the Grillparzer Prize for the same play in 1972, he staged a protest because the organisers of the ceremony did not recognise him and escort him to his seat.

The 1970s was Bernhard&#x27;s most productive decade. His plays &quot;The Ignoramus and the Madman&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Force of Habit: A Comedy&quot; (1974) premiered at the Salzburg Festival, &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; (1974) and &quot;The President&quot; (1975) premiered at the Vienna Burgtheater, and &quot;Minetti&quot; (1976), &quot;Immanuel Kant&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Eve of Retirement&quot; (1979) premiered at the Stuttgart Staatstheater under Peymann. His novel &quot;Correction&quot; (1975) is widely considered his masterpiece and his five volumes of memoirs (1975-82) (collected in English translation as &quot;Gathering Evidence&quot;) achieved critical acclaim.

=== Final years and late work (197889) ===
In 1978, Bernhard was diagnosed with sarcoidosis and a terminal heart complaint. His half-brother Peter Fabjan, a doctor of medicine, moved to Gmunden, near the author&#x27;s farmhouse, and became his unofficial medical adviser. In 1979, Bernhard resigned from the German Academy for Language and Literature when it made the former West German president Walter Scheel an honorary member. In a letter to the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; he called the academy pretentious and hypocritical for admitting mediocre politicians.

Bernhard continued his prolific output in the 1980s. Eight new full-length plays were premiered and he wrote a series of novels comprising long monologues by ageing and ill protagonists who Honegger compares to Bernhard in their &quot;race against death.&quot; His 1984 novel &quot;Woodcutters&quot; was controversial for its attack on Austrian culture and cultural figures. Gerhard Lampersberg sued him for defamation but later withdrew his suit. The novel was Bernhard&#x27;s most commercially successful, selling 60,000 copies within six weeks of publication.

Bernhard frequently engaged in public controversies, writing letters, opinion pieces and satirical sketches for newspapers and magazines in which he attacked politicians, public figures and European culture. He was often criticised as a &quot;Nestbeschmutzer&quot; (one who fouls his own nest; that is, Austria) but preferred to call himself a troublemaker. His final play &quot;Heldenplatz&quot; (1988), commissioned by Vienna&#x27;s Burgtheater for the celebrations of its centenary, sparked another controversy when the press revealed that it would include attacks on Austria for antisemitism and denial of its Nazi past. Numerous politicians and public figures called for a ban on the production, Bernhard received death threats, and the Burgtheater was guarded by 200 police officers on the opening night of the play in November 1988.

Following the &quot;Heldenplatz&quot; dispute, Bernhard&#x27;s health deteriorated. He died of heart failure in his apartment in Gmunden on 12 February 1989. His reputation as a troublemaker continued beyond the grave when a clause of his will was published, stipulating that none of his works or plays could be performed in Austria for the duration of copyright:

== Themes and style ==
=== Themes ===
Most of Bernhard&#x27;s work has autobiographical elements, although fact and fiction are freely mixed. According to Honegger: &quot;Bernhard&#x27;s life and work are inextricably intertwined with Austria&#x27;s convulsive history in the twentieth century.&quot;

Bernhard&#x27;s work presents a pessimistic view of the human condition in which death is an inescapable presence. Critic Mark Anderson states, &quot;death in his writing comes as a random, unjustifiable, but unavoidable cut in existence that cancels all previous hope and striving&quot;. Literary critic Stephen Dowden states that in Berhard&#x27;s fiction there is no redemption for man in religion, politics, art or history.

The typical Bernhard protagonist is a middle-aged male who, according to Dowden, is &quot;self-absorbed, histrionically pessimistic, and motivated by a deep loathing of culture and self,&quot; but who is nevertheless &quot;strangely charismatic because of the powerful musical language with which he expresses his inner life.&quot; His protagonists must &quot;learn to live without recourse to metaphysical lies or utopian deceptions.&quot;

Bernhard depicts a postwar Austria steeped in cultural pretensions, antisemitism, denial of its Nazi past and devotion to a morally bankrupt Catholicism. Dowden argues that Austria is often used as a metaphor for the human condition. Just as Austrian history is a story of decline into insignificance, so human beings struggle pointlessly against death; just as Austria engages in self-deception regarding its past and its place in the world, so human beings engage in self-deceptions about the redemptive power of religion, family and culture.

Recurring motifs in Bernhard&#x27;s work include isolation, incest, madness, chronic illness and suicide. Many of Bernhard&#x27;s characters suffer from mental and physical illness which Dowden sees as metaphors for Bernhard&#x27;s moral pessimism and the decline of European society and culture. His protagonists are often engaged in failed intellectual and artistic projects in a futile and destructive attempt to achieve perfection and thus transcend death.

In the face of inevitable death, Bernhard&#x27;s characters often demonstrate a will to survive. Honegger states, &quot;The &quot;Überlebenskünstler&quot; is Bernhard&#x27;s central archetype: the survival artist as a virtuoso performance artist.&quot; Dowden argues that Bernhard&#x27;s works also attest to a will to rebel against conformity and to develop an independent self-identity: &quot;His entire oeuvre amounts to one unswerving experiment in thinking against the grain, in forcing the imagination to explore the parts of life it resists the most.&quot;

=== Style ===
Bernhard developed a distinctive prose style which is often described as musical, emphasising the rhythms of Austrian German, repetition of key phrases, and variations on recognisable themes. Anderson states that his prose works &quot;all spring, or appear to spring, from the obsessive monologue going on inside Bernhard’s head, a continuous text uttered by a single droning voice that is endlessly reformulated, corrected, and filtered through a hundred different registers.&quot; Honegger distinguishes between Bernhard&#x27;s early prose which was characterised by multiple perspectives and stylistic experimentation and the late works beginning with &quot;Yes&quot; (1978) which she calls &quot;concerts for a solo mind.&quot;

Bernhard&#x27;s works are known for their distinctive punctuation and vocabulary. Many comprise a stream of long sentences, unbroken by any paragraph or chapter markings. Honegger states: &quot;His verbal inventions have entered the German vocabulary. His constructions of interminably interlocked clauses and sub-clauses stretch the German language to its limit.&quot;

The tone of Bernhard&#x27;s work is often described as satirical, ironic, polemical and unsentimental. Dowden argues that the extreme and often contradictory views of his protagonists invite the reader to detect ironies and read them as satires. Readers are not expected to accept or reject the opinions of Bernhard&#x27;s protagonists but to engage with their &quot;verbal struggle against death&quot;.

Bernhard&#x27;s pessimism is often undercut by comedy and black humour. According to Anderson: &quot;The death narrative is always also the record of survival, a survival through a grotesquely jubilant, at times comic writing.&quot; Dowden states that &quot;comedy arises when people attempt to create meaning or convince themselves that the world holds something for them...[It is] an austere comedy of catastrophe, despair and mockery.&quot;

== Reception and legacy ==
Bernhard is widely considered one of the most important German-language writers of the second half of the 20th century. Critics generally consider his major prose works to be &quot;Correction&quot; (1975), &quot;Extinction&quot; (1986) and his five volumes of memoirs (1975-82) (collected in English translation as &quot;Gathering Evidence&quot;.)

Bernhard wrote 18 full-length plays, many of which premiered at leading German-language venues including the &quot;Deutsches Schauspielhaus&quot; in Hamburg, the Salzburg Festival and the Vienna Burgtheater. His plays polarised audiences and critics and often caused media and political controversy for their pessimism and polemics against Austrian and European culture and institutions. According to Dowden: &quot;His public was eager to see what powerful figure he would insult next, what enraged outcry he would elicit, who would try to sue him, and how he would respond.&quot;

Honegger states that Bernhard&#x27;s prose style has influenced the German language: &quot;his performative grammar and incendiary vocabulary have been appropriated by politicians of all persuasions, exploited by the media, and imitated by lesser writers.&quot; Bernhard has influenced younger Austrian writers including Elfriede Jelinek, Lilian Faschinger, Robert Menasse and Josef Haslinger. His works have been translated into over 20 languages, and Dagmar Lorenz states that he is one of the few Austrian authors that have won international acclaim.

In 1999, Bernhard&#x27;s literary executor lifted the ban on the performance of his plays in Austria. Although Bernhard stipulated in his will that none of his unpublished writings should be published, this has sometimes been circumvented. Notably, a memoir &quot;My Prizes&quot; appeared in 2009 and his correspondence with his publisher Siegfried Unseld from 1961 to 1989 – about 500 letters – was published in December 2009. Bernhard&#x27;s collected works were published in 22 volumes from 2003 to 2015.

Bernhard&#x27;s half-brother and literary executor, Peter Fabjan, is honorary secretary of the International Thomas Bernhard Society. The Thomas Bernhard house in Ohlsdorf/Obernathal is open to the public.

<doc id="1048115" wikidata="Q7287904" url="?curid=1048115" title="Ralph Neville">
<text>Ralph Neville (or Ralf Nevill or Ralph de Neville; died 1244) was a medieval clergyman and politician who served as Bishop of Chichester and Lord Chancellor of England. Neville first appears in the historical record in 1207 in the service of King John, and remained in royal service throughout the rest of his life. By 1213 Neville had custody of the Great Seal of England, although he was not named chancellor, the office responsible for the seal, until 1226. He was rewarded with the bishopric of Chichester in 1222. Although he was also briefly Archbishop-elect of Canterbury and Bishop-elect of Winchester, both elections were set aside, or quashed, and he held neither office.

As keeper of the seal, and subsequently as chancellor, Neville was noted for his impartiality, and he oversaw a number of changes in the way the chancery operated. Neville was deprived of the Great Seal in 1238 after quarrelling with King Henry III, but continued to hold the title of chancellor until his death. He died in his London palace, built on a street later renamed Chancery Lane owing to his connection with the chancery.

==Early life==

Neville, who was illegitimate, had at least three brothers: Nicholas de Neville, a canon at Chichester Cathedral; William de Neville, treasurer of the see of Chichester; and Robert de Neville, holder of a prebend at Chichester. The identity of their father is unknown, but another likely sibling was Roger, who held land in Lincolnshire. Robert became Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Nicholas a baron of the Exchequer. Ralph Neville was also related to Hugh de Neville, King John of England&#x27;s chief forester.

Neville was a royal clerk to King John in the spring of 1207, and in December of that year was at Marlborough Castle on royal business. Earlier references to a Ralph Neville who in 1207 delivered items to Hugh de Neville, or the Ralph Neville who was the same Hugh de Neville&#x27;s chaplain, may be to the future bishop, but the evidence is inconclusive. Hugh de Neville and Neville subsequently worked together, and corresponded on both business and personal affairs. Both men claimed the other as a kinsman.

Neville&#x27;s activities during the years immediately after 1207 are unknown, owing to the lack of royal records, but in December 1213 he was given custody of the Great Seal of the kingdom. He was Dean of Lichfield by 11 April 1214, at which time he held a prebend in the diocese of London. Neville was appointed to the royal chancery in about 1214, largely through the patronage of Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester and one of the king&#x27;s favourites. From March to October 1214, Neville was in France with the king. After the king returned to England after 1214, Neville remained in royal service until at least May 1216, although without custody of the Great Seal. His activities during the final period of John&#x27;s reign prior to the king&#x27;s sudden death in October 1216 are unknown.

==Royal service and Bishop of Chichester==

Neville was keeper of the royal seal under the new king, Henry III (r. 1216–1272) from about 6 November 1218. He had been at the royal court since May 1218, and was given custody of the seal as soon as it was made up. One of the first documents subsequently sealed was a declaration that no charters or other rights would be granted in perpetuity until Henry attained his majority. Neville was also vice-chancellor of England under the chancellorship of Richard Marsh, who had been elected as Bishop of Durham in 1217 and spent most of his time attending to ecclesiastical affairs in his northern diocese. In fact, if not in name, Neville was responsible for all the duties of the chancellorship, and he exercised most of the power of that office, although Marsh continued to hold the title of chancellor until his death in 1226. When instability threatened the royal government in May and June 1219 Neville was ordered by Pandulf, the papal legate, to remain in London with the Great Seal while a royal council was held at Gloucester. The council resulted in royal government coming under the control of Hubert de Burgh the Justiciar, Pandulf, and Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester.

Neville received a papal dispensation for his illegitimacy on 25 January 1220, on the recommendation of the king, Stephen Langton the Archbishop of Canterbury, other bishops, and the papal legate Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, all of whom testified to his good reputation and character. In late October he was named chancellor of the see of Chichester, but was then elected Bishop of Chichester on about 1 November 1222. He was given control of the temporalities of the bishopric on 3 November 1222, and was consecrated on 21 April 1224. In April 1223 Neville was ordered by Pope Honorius III to cease using the Great Seal on the command of the justiciar or other members of the minority council, but instead to do so only at the king&#x27;s command, essentially ending the royal minority. But it did not finally end until December 1223, and even then, as the king had not yet been officially declared of age, the ban on grants without a fixed time limit remained in force.

==Lord Chancellor==

Neville was named Lord Chancellor of England on 17 May 1226. The appointment was made by the great council during the minority of King Henry III, and Neville obtained a grant of the office for life. Unlike Hubert de Burgh, who lost his offices when Henry III attained his majority and took control of the government, Neville remained chancellor with only slight disagreements until 1238, although a confirmation of the lifetime nature of his tenure was made in 1232. Under Neville, the first signs that the chancery was becoming a department of the government, rather than just a royal department that was part of the royal household, began to emerge. The contemporary writer Matthew Paris praised Neville for his actions as chancellor, claiming that he treated all equally and was transparent in discharging his duties, which was important, as the chancellor&#x27;s office controlled access to the king. Neville oversaw a number of changes in chancery procedures, splitting off the liberate rolls from the letters close in 1226 and reviving the keeping of the Charter Rolls in 1227. He also issued writs on his own authority, the so-called writs &quot;de cursu&quot;. Neville received a number of gifts and privileges from the king while chancellor, including the right of exemption from the seizure of his possessions by any royal or other secular official. The king also agreed not to interfere with the execution of Neville&#x27;s last will and testament.

Surviving letters from the precentor of Chichester Cathedral beg the bishop to come to Chichester over Easter to celebrate the Easter Mass and to deal with pressing issues in the diocese. Neville&#x27;s duties as chancellor kept him from attending to much of the business of his diocese, but he employed clerics to administer the ecclesiastical offices of his diocese and in general his relationship with his cathedral chapter appears to have been good. He employed a teacher of theology for his cathedral, and supported students at schools in Lincoln, Oxford, and Douai. He worked to protect the rights, lands, and privileges of his diocese and cathedral chapter from encroachment by others, both secular and clerical. On one occasion he threatened to excommunicate the Earl of Arundel or the earl&#x27;s men for hunting on land the bishop considered to be his own.

Neville was elected Archbishop of Canterbury on about 24 September 1231 by the monks of Canterbury, but his election was quashed in early 1232 by Pope Gregory IX, on the grounds that Neville was an or illiterate, even though he had been found to be &quot;literatus&quot; in 1214 when appointed dean; &quot;literatus&quot; in this sense meant &quot;learned&quot; rather than &quot;literate&quot;. Other concerns were that Simon Langton, the Archdeacon of Canterbury, described Neville as a courtier instead of a true priest, and claimed that Neville&#x27;s goal was to free England from its feudal ties to the papacy.

As well as his chancery duties, Neville occasionally sat with the barons of the exchequer or with royal justices, and he had a role in the appointment of royal justices. In 1230 he was regent of England while Henry was absent in France, during which time he met with Llywelyn the Great in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate an agreement that would resolve the disputes between the English and the Welsh. In 1232, during the events surrounding the de Burgh&#x27;s downfall Neville, along with Ranulf, the Earl of Chester, urged that de Burgh should not be dragged from sanctuary to face the royal accusations against him. Neville&#x27;s pleas prevailed for a time, but eventually de Burgh was removed from sanctuary.

The king attempted to deprive Neville of the chancellorship in 1236, which the bishop countered by claiming that as he had been appointed during the royal minority with the consent of the great council, only the council could dismiss him. In 1238 the cathedral chapter of the see of Winchester elected as Bishop of Winchester first William de Raley in opposition to the king&#x27;s choice of William the Bishop of Valence, and when that election was quashed, they elected Neville. His election to Winchester was quashed in 1239, leading to a quarrel with Henry III. Valence was the uncle of Eleanor of Provence, whom Henry had married in 1236. Valence had gained much influence with the king quite quickly, and worked to eliminate the older royal officials and institute reforms in the royal administration. This, along with the disputed election to Winchester, was the cause of Neville&#x27;s fall from favour. Although Henry deprived Neville of the custody of the Great Seal from 1238 until 1242, Neville retained the title of chancellor until his death, thus entitling him to the revenues he would normally have received from the office. The Great Seal itself was held by a number of minor officials, probably to allow Henry greater control over its use by preventing the establishment of another powerful official who might interfere with his plans. But they lacked the power base that Neville had possessed, which enabled him to oppose the king.

In 1239 Neville may have been offered the custody of the Great Seal, which he refused. In May 1242 Neville was once again responsible for the seal while Henry was in France, a responsibility apparently shared with the regent. After the king&#x27;s return in September 1243 Neville did seal a few documents with the Great Seal until his death a few months later.

==Death and writings==

Neville died between 1 and 4 February 1244 at the palace he had built in London in what was then New Street, subsequently renamed Chancery Lane because of his being Lord Chancellor. He was buried in Chichester Cathedral, behind the high altar. After Neville&#x27;s death Matthew Paris described him as &quot;a man laudable in all things, and a pillar of fidelity in the business of the kingdom and the king&quot;. Some of the provisions of his will are known: he left some jewellery and gems to the king, some of his lands were given to his successors as bishop, and other lands and items were bequeathed to his cathedral chapter at Chichester. He also endowed a distribution of bread to the poor residents of Chichester, a gift that continued into the 20th century. Neville also endowed a chapel near Chichester with two clergy to pray for the soul of King John.

Many of Neville&#x27;s letters survive, as they were collected by him during his lifetime. They are currently in the National Archives of the United Kingdom, having previously formed part of the Public Record Office. The letters were published in &quot;Sussex Archaeological Collections&quot; volume 3 in 1850 and were edited by William Henry Blaauw. Neville was instrumental in promoting the career of his brother William, but non-relatives also benefited from his patronage: one of Neville&#x27;s clerks, Silvester de Everdon, was a member of the chancery until 1246, when he was selected as Bishop of Carlisle.

<doc id="1048116" wikidata="Q326816" url="?curid=1048116" title="GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development">
<text>The GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development is a regional organization of four post-Soviet states: Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova.

Conceived in 1997 to harmonize and integrate commercial, diplomatic and democratic relations among its member states, the GUAM treaty charter was signed in 2001 and today covers a population of over 49.8 million people. Uzbekistan was also a member of GUAM in the 1999–2005 period. In 2003, GUAM became an observer in the UN General Assembly. In 2007, GUAM also established a military peacekeeping force and organized joint military exercises. Such increasingly deepened integration and relationships led to GUAM playing an important role in the region&#x27;s diplomatic and commercial affairs.

The agreement on a Free Trade Area was signed in 2002. In 2017, additional agreements on a free-trade area were announced, but as of 2022 reportedly the FTA has not been ratified and has not entered into force. The WTO was notified only in 2017 and the Agreement is designated as &quot;Plurilateral&quot; and &quot;In Force&quot;. According to the WTO database, the GUAM FTA agreement was signed in 2002 and entered into force in 2003. International Trade Centre says there is no free trade area in operation with distinct rules from an Agreement on Creation of CIS Free Trade Area, was signed on 15 April 1994 by 12 CIS countries.

The database of agreements of the International Trade Centre does not indicate that a GUAM FTA agreement has been concluded, but it does indicate that the 1994 Agreement on CIS FTA is in force for Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova. and the 1999 Agreement on CIS FTA version is listed as the current text of the FTA agreement.

The official negotiating language of GUAM was Russian, but it was scrapped in favor of English in 2014.

Election monitoring by GUAM has been described as &quot;low-quality&quot;, as observers from the group validate flawed elections.

==History==
===Origins and foundation, Uzbek membership (1997–2005)===
Cooperation between Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova started with the &quot;GUAM consultative forum&quot;, established on 10 October 1997, in Strasbourg and named after the initial letters of each of those countries. In 1999, the organisation adopted the name GUUAM due to the membership of Uzbekistan. A summit in Yalta on 6 and 7 June 2001 was accompanied by the signing of GUUAM&#x27;s charter, which formalized the organization. According to the former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko, the charter set objectives for cooperation, such as promoting democratic values, ensuring stable development, enhancing international and regional security, and stepping up European integration.

In 2002, Uzbekistan announced that it planned to withdraw from the organization and following this announcement started to ignore GUUAM summits and meetings. In May 2005, shortly after the Andijan massacre, Uzbekistan finally gave official notice of withdrawal from the organization to the Moldovan presidency, thus changing the group&#x27;s name back to GUAM.

A summit of GUUAM took place in Chișinău, Moldova, on 22 April 2005. The US Department of State special representative for Eurasian conflicts, Steven Mann, and the OSCE Secretary General, Ján Kubiš, participated in the summit. The Russian ambassador in Chișinău criticized the fact that Russia was not invited to attend. Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan, said after the summit: &quot;Our organization is emerging as a powerful force, participating in resolving problems in the Caspian—Black Sea region&quot; while the president of Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko, said that a new page had been written in the history of the organization.

===Deepening of relations and integration (2006–2013)===
Given the growth of its influence in the region, and the existence of the Russian—led Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), GUAM was seen in Russia as a way of countering the Russian influence in the area and as part of a strategy backed by the United States. However, GUAM leaders repeatedly and officially dismiss such claims and declare their strong willingness to develop close friendly relations with Russia. Moreover, Azerbaijan, the group&#x27;s main energy power, has managed to avoid any conflicts with Russia in recent years.

In April 2006, three GUAM nations supported Ukraine&#x27;s proposal to condemn the Holodomor, the 1930s famine in Ukraine which killed millions of people, as a genocide.

In May 2006, Ukraine and Azerbaijan announced plans to further increase the GUAM member relations by renaming the organization &quot;GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development&quot; and establishing its headquarters in the Ukrainian capital. The other members said this was a remarkable step and development. The summit participants were also expected to adopt GUAM by—laws, a declaration and a communique. Also in May 2006 the Ukrainian Defense Ministry announced plans to establish GUAM peacekeeping forces. The following year, GUAM nations agreed to form a 500-personnel joint peacekeeping force to battle separatism.

In June 2007, presidents of Lithuania, Poland and Romania joined the leaders of GUAM member states at the GUAM summit in Baku, Azerbaijan. Also participating at the summit were the Vice-President of Bulgaria, the Vice-Speaker of the Estonian parliament, the Minister of Economy of Latvia, and the high—level representatives of the United States, Japan, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC), UNESCO, and heads of diplomatic missions accredited in Azerbaijan.

===After Russian invasion and annexation of Crimea (2014–present)===
In December 2014, then-Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin proposed that GUAM should use English during meetings, instead of Russian, which was also the main language used in official gatherings in the Soviet Union. GUAM representatives agreed.

In March 2017, GUAM officially established agreements on a free-trade area and harmonization of customs procedures among its member states.

In May 2021, three of the four members, Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia, joined the Association Trio in order to jointly facilitate further European integration.

==Free trade area negotiations==
An Agreement on Establishment of Free Trade Area between the GUUAM Participating States was signed on 20 July 2002. 

In 2017 Ukraine announced agreements on a free-trade area and harmonization of customs procedures among its member states.

At the 77th Session of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly held in New York on 20 September 2022, the Foreign Ministers of the Organization for Democracy and Economic Development (GUAM) members came together on the sidelines and held the 39th Cabinet meeting of GUAM. After the meeting, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova signed a protocol on the determination of the country of origin of the goods. In addition, it was announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine that a free trade zone was established between the GUAM countries.

The Free Trade Area has not been ratified and has not entered into force. It is too soon to be sure whether GUAM member states will ratify the free trade area soon or if the project will be placed on hiatus. There is also the question about to what extent an FTA could help financially GUAM countries compared to other projects, such as European Union membership or the Middle Corridor. GUAM is a regional bloc that has not demonstrated its usefulness to its member states compared to other organizations or projects that GUAM member states are part of.

<text>Brunswick Street is a street in inner northern Melbourne, known for cafés, live music venues and alternative fashion shops.

==Route==
Brunswick Street runs north–south through the inner northern Melbourne suburbs of Fitzroy and Fitzroy North, from Victoria Parade at its southernmost end, crossing Gertrude Street and Alexandra Parade through Fitzroy, and north continuing until it reaches St Georges Road in Fitzroy North, near the Edinburgh Gardens; there, its former northward course is continued by a much smaller residential street named Brunswick Street North.

Tram route 11 (West Preston to Victoria Harbour) runs along the entire length of Brunswick Street.

==History==


Brunswick Street, believed to be named after Captain George Brunswick Smyth, owes its origins to Benjamin Baxter, who owned land along Victoria Parade in the recently proclaimed township of Newtown (now Fitzroy South). Baxter owned Crown Allotment 49, which was adjacent to Allotment 48 at the northwest corner of the government roads Victoria Parade and Nicholson Street. In 1839 Baxter subdivided his land into quarters, creating roads between the subdivisions. These became Brunswick Street and Gertrude Street. Initially Brunswick Street only ran as far as what is now Hanover Street, Fitzroy. In 1840, Mr Robert Saunders Webb subdivided Crown Allotment 70, to the north of Baxter&#x27;s land. This extended Brunswick Street further north to Bell Street (originally known as Hamburg Street). The street was officially proclaimed in 1851, by which time it extended as far as Reilly Street (now Alexandra Parade), at that stage an incomplete open drain.

In 1867 allotments in the cleared scrubland to the north of Reilly Street were put up for sale. The Government survey plan included a road in the same alignment as Brunswick Street leading to a cricket ground reserve to the north, but it was unnamed. During residential development in the 1870s, this road became known as Harker Street and was extended as far north as today&#x27;s Holden Street. In 1876 Harker Street changed its name to Brunswick Street North, but by 1900 the wide Government section south of St Georges Road had dropped the &#x27;North&#x27; in its title while the remainder, narrower and offset from the main road due to its formation by private land subdivisions, retained the name Brunswick Street North.

Shops had appeared in the southern end of Brunswick Street as early as the 1840s and by 1854 the strip rivaled Bourke Street as a shopping district.

After World War II, large numbers of immigrants (principally from Mediterranean Europe) settled in the inner suburbs of Melbourne, including Fitzroy. Among them, there were many Italians, who in turn imported espresso machines and established the foundations of Melbourne&#x27;s café culture. Building on these foundations and established in 1986, Mario&#x27;s Cafe is an iconic venue on Brunswick street serving both coffee and Italian cuisine.

For some decades, the suburb of Fitzroy was a working-class area of low rents and cheap shops. This area began to attract students, artists, and bohemians. The T. F. Much Ballroom commenced in Cathedral Hall (now called Central Hall, just opposite St Vincents Hospital, in Brunswick Street, in 1970. The T. F. Much was the heart of Melbourne&#x27;s music scene and saw stand out performances by Daddy Cool, Spectrum (and Murtceps), Carson, Capt Matchbox as well as several of Joe Camilleri&#x27;s earlier incarnations.

In the 1980s, 3RRR established its studios in Victoria Street, off Brunswick Street, the Punters Club established itself as a significant live music venue, as did the Evelyn Hotel, and independent record shop PolyEster Records opened. These businesses cemented Brunswick Street&#x27;s status as a nexus of Melbourne&#x27;s indie music and post punk/new-wave subcultures, which in turn drew in waves of suburban tourists in their teens and 20s. Brunswick Street also served as the home base for integral techno/electronic label/promoter IF? Records, from 1994 to 2001.

Gentrification was not long in following, though the economic recession of the 1990s slowed it somewhat. One by one, the few remaining regular shops closed and were replaced by cafés, fashion boutiques, and bars, a shift that has played a large role in Fitzroy being named one of the most unique neighbourhoods in the world in 2016. The Punters Club closed in 2002 (however it would reopen in 2024), and 3RRR has relocated further out to Brunswick.

From the start of the 21st century, Brunswick Street has become home to artisans, young professionals, and baby boomers with retirement savings.

===Road classification===
Brunswick Street was signed as Metropolitan Route 45 between Fitzroy and Fitzroy North, in 1989, continuing north along St Georges Road.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: in 2004, VicRoads re-declared the road as Brunswick Street (Arterial #5114), from St Georges Road to Alexandra Parade through Fitzroy, the remainder of the road to Victoria Parade remains undeclared.

==In popular culture==
Helen Garner&#x27;s novel &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; (1977) featured locations set in and around Brunswick Street, including the Fitzroy Swimming Pool on Alexandra Parade. Brunswick Street has also been used in the filming of many local Melbourne-based television series, such as &quot;Offspring&quot; and &quot;Rush&quot;. A song based on the streets&#x27; reputation features on English singer-songwriter Kiran Leonard&#x27;s debut album &#x27;Bowler Hat Soup&#x27;.

==Major intersections==
Brunswick Street is entirely contained within the City of Yarra local government area.

<doc id="1048130" wikidata="Q4337596" url="?curid=1048130" title="Autumn Visits">
<text>Autumn Visits is a science fiction novel by Russian writer Sergey Lukyanenko, published in 1997 in book form. It is a novel written in a very unusual style for the author—shifting perspective of narrative.

==Plot introduction==
In a poor, downtrodden Russia, a vector of future development of the world is being decided. Six Forces send their champions—Envoys, copies of real people, typical of their kind; they are &quot;almost&quot; the same as their prototypes. An Envoy can do only that what prototype can, but unlike them, envoys believe in their own forces, and thus can change the world. The Envoys have a main directive—to survive. The last surviving Envoy is deemed to be the most fit for the world, and guides it in the future.

==Plot summary==
Six forces: Love, Growth, Knowledge, Power, Strength, and Art.

===Kindness===
This world (actually, the whole action takes place in Russia and Ukraine) lacks love; but the love this Envoy would bring the Kindness of fervent religion - leading to witch hunts and crusades. The Original for this Envoy is a female doctor, who has seen the consequences of love, kindness and compassion neglected in her patients dying without access to medicines and treatments. She believes her Envoy to be God, or a divine messenger, but appears rather blind to her other aspects.

===Knowledge===
The force of Knowledge would create a better, more reasonable world, but is hampered by physical fraility, and always ends up subjugated by power. The Envoy of knowledge would change that, but his Original is an old scientist suffering from terminal cancer, who is intelligent and wise, but physically impotent. Knowledge remembers his past incarnations with clarity, unlike the other Envoys and can extrapolate the actions of the others much better.

===Art===
The force of Art is rarely able to take action, hampered by its own imagination of the consequences. When it does, however, the actions are impassioned, and the result is rarely savoury, like the actions of a certain painter Schicklgruber. Art is represented by a &#x27;hack&#x27; writer, cranking out several fantasy and sci-fi novels a year for money. The novel implies that some of Lukyanenko&#x27;s other books are actually written by the Original of this Envoy. Specifically, he makes numerous references to having written &quot;The Boy and the Darkness&quot;.

===Strength===
Strength is the force that guarantees peace and security. A country with a strong army, without crime; a place to which warriors can proudly come home. Strength&#x27;s Envoy is a copy of an Army Colonel who fought in Afghanistan. He is Ukrainian, and is in the Ukrainian army, but seems to regard the countries as close kin, almost as one. This Envoy and his Original don&#x27;t see eye-to-eye on their vision of the future, because the Original has lost faith in his cause, while the copy retains his belief.

===Power===
Power represents a strong state, claiming people&#x27;s loyalty, guiding their lives, and focusing their strength on a single purpose, but also punishing individual action, turning people into a herd being driven by a stern and beloved shepherd. This force is represented by an ambitious and corrupt politician, seeking to ascend to presidency. The Envoy murders and supplants his Original as soon as he arrives, because &quot;power can&#x27;t be shared&quot;. The novel implies that the current state of the world is in part the result of Power winning the last contest; Joseph Stalin and Napoleon Bonaparte are both implied to have been an Envoys of Power.

===Growth===
The forth of Growth represents progress and development, potential limited only by motivation. Unfortunately, Growth lacks direction, and has potential for both good and evil. Growth is, appropriately, represented by a teenager—a somewhat dour and cynical boy, who is implied to have lost his faith in the world. This Envoy and his Original begin to grow apart as the novel progresses, diverging, and even spending a lot of time away from each other, unlike most other Envoy/Original pairs. Unlike the other Envoys, Growth does not remember his past incarnations, as experience would defeat the purpose of growing.

===Darkness===
Although not mentioned as part of the six Forces, Darkness intervenes in the contest. Darkness is presented as ultimate freedom, even from the consequences of one&#x27;s own actions. Darkness doesn&#x27;t have an Envoy, but it still has a champion—a determined and driven professional hitman, whom Darkness empowers and directs to kill all the Envoys and their Originals.

===Light===
Although not part of this contest, the force of Light has intervened in past contests, and has won at least one. Jesus Christ is implied to have been a champion of Light. His death was a short-term loss but a long-term victory.

==Awards and nominations==
In 1998 the 1st Moscow SF&amp;F Forum awarded this novel the &quot;Sigma-F&quot; distinction.</text><links>

<doc id="1048143" wikidata="Q3809418" url="?curid=1048143" title="John Lexington">
<text>Sir John Lexington (or Lexinton or Lessington; also de Lexington) (died 1257) was a baron and royal official in 13th century England. He has been described as having been Lord Chancellor, but other scholars believe he merely held the royal seals while the office was vacant or the chancellor was abroad. He served two terms, once from 1247 to 1248, and again from 1249 to 1250.

==Life==
Lexington was a member of a prominent family whose name came from the village of Lexington, now Laxton, in Nottinghamshire. 
His father Richard was a royal judge and married Mathilda de Cauz (or Calz), a widow with holdings that included Sherwood Forest. 
His youngest brother was Robert of Lexinton, a judge and royal official; another brother, Henry of Lexington, held royal offices before becoming Dean of Lincoln and then Bishop of Lincoln.
A fourth brother, Stephen of Lexington, became a Cistercian monk and administrator, ultimately serving as Abbot of Clairvaux.

John Lexington was sent by Henry III to a proposed papal conference in 1241 and was present at a naval battle near the Isola del Giglio in which Pisan and Sicilian ships defeated the Genoese and a number of prelates were captured; he helped save the life of his brother Stephen, who was present.
On his return he was part of the expedition against Dafydd ap Llywelyn of Wales and conveyed the hostage Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr, Dafydd&#x27;s half-brother, to London. In 1242 he was appointed to a truce commission to correct infringements of the truce with France. He served as the king&#x27;s seneschal in 1247 and possibly at other times.
After 1248 there is evidence that he served as a judge. In 1250, he inherited the barony and lands of his brother Robert. By 1255 he was serving as chief justice of the forests north of the Trent, and warden of Bamburgh, Pickering, and Scarborough castles.

In response to the death of Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln, he imprisoned a Jew named Copin or Jopin and obtained a confession in return for a promise to save his life (a promise the king repudiated). Given Lexington&#x27;s personal relationship with the Bishop and other clerics in Lincoln, there is considerable suspicion that he pushed King Henry towards dealing with the Jews severely, and with the knowledge that the accusations had no basis in fact. Langmuir says of Lexington:

what he did powerfully affected those predisposed to think evil of Jews then and for centuries to come. He incited the weakly credulous Henry III to give the ritual murder fantasy the blessing of royal authority, and he inspired Matthew Paris to write a vivid garbled yarn that would ring in men&#x27;s minds for centuries and blind modern historians. A century and a half later, Geoffrey Chaucer, after letting the legend of the singing boy slip from the prioress&#x27; lips, would inevitably be reminded of England&#x27;s most famous proof of Jewish evil and conclude with an invocation to young Hugh — whose alleged fate neither he nor his audience were likely to question. John de Lexington died in January, 1257, and his elegant learning will not be described in any history of mediaeval thought, yet his tale of young Hugh of Lincoln became a strand in English literature and a support for irrational beliefs about Jews from 1255 to Auschwitz. It is time he received his due credit.

Matthew Paris called him a man of weight and learning and a brave and accomplished knight. His arms were a cross azure on a shield argent. He married a woman named Margaret (or Margery) de Merlay, daughter of Richard d&#x27;Umfraville of Prudhoe and widow of Roger de Merlay, Baron Morpeth. They had no children.

His estate went to his brother Henry, the bishop of Lincoln, and on his death in 1258 to the descendants of their two sisters, Alice and Cecilia, wives of Roland de Sutton and William Markham, since none of his brothers left heirs.

<text>Richard Quine (November 12, 1920June 10, 1989) was an American director, actor, and singer.

He began acting as a child in radio, vaudeville, and stage productions before being signed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in his early twenties. When his acting career began to wane after World War II, Quine began working as a film director. He later moved into producing and directing television. Quine&#x27;s films as director include &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot; (1958), &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot; (1960), &quot;Paris When It Sizzles&quot; (1964), &quot;How to Murder Your Wife&quot; (1965), and &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1979).

==Career==
===Child actor===
Born in Detroit, Quine&#x27;s father was an actor. Quine&#x27;s family moved to Los Angeles when he was six years old.

As a child, he began working as a radio actor and became a minor radio star. He then appeared in vaudeville before moving on to stage roles.

Quine made his film debut in the drama &quot;Cavalcade&quot; (1933). He could also be seen in &quot;The World Changes&quot; (1933) (alongside a young Mickey Rooney), &quot;Counsellor-at-Law&quot; (1933), &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1934, as John Reed), &quot;Dames&quot; (1934), &quot;Wednesday&#x27;s Child&quot; (1934) with Frankie Thomas, &quot;Little Men&quot; (1934), &quot;Life Returns&quot; (1935), &quot;A Dog of Flanders&quot; (1935) with Thomas, and &quot;Dinky&quot; (1935) with Jackie Cooper.

===New York===
Quine left Los Angeles for New York City to return to stage acting.

In 1939, Quine made his Broadway debut in the Jerome Kern/Oscar Hammerstein II stage musical &quot;Very Warm for May&quot; in 1939, which ran for 59 performances. The following year, he was cast as Frank Lippincott in the hit Broadway production of &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot; starring Shirley Booth which was a hit.

===MGM actor===
His role in the stage version of &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot; led to Quine&#x27;s being signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Quine&#x27;s first film for MGM was &quot;Babes on Broadway&quot; (1941), starring Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney. Rooney and Quine had been friends since childhood.

While at MGM, Quine also appeared in &quot;Tish&quot; (1942), with Susan Peters who would later become his second wife, and &quot;For Me and My Gal&quot; (1942), playing Judy Garland&#x27;s brother. Columbia borrowed him to reprise his stage role in &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot; (1942).

At MGM he had a good role in &quot;Dr. Gillespie&#x27;s New Assistant&quot; (1942), alongside Peters, and was in &quot;Stand by for Action&quot; (1942) and the propaganda short &quot;The Rear Gunner&quot; (1943).

Walter Wanger borrowed Quine for &quot;We&#x27;ve Never Been Licked&quot; (1943), a wartime propaganda drama, where Quine was top billed.

Just as his acting career seemed about to take off, he had to serve in the United States Coast Guard. While in the Coast Guard, he became a lieutenant and served in public relations department in San Diego, California.

After the war, Quine&#x27;s acting career stalled. He appeared in &quot;The Cockeyed Miracle&quot; (1946), &quot;Words and Music&quot; (1948) and &quot;Command Decision&quot; (1948).

===Columbia and becoming a film director===
Quine and friend William Asher then decided to get into production and directing. The two set about adapting &quot;Leather Gloves,&quot; a short story that appeared in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;. The story was later adapted by another writer, but Quine and Asher were hired to produce and direct the 1948 film version released by Columbia Pictures.

Reportedly Harry Cohn offered to buy the script outright but they wanted to direct. Cohn responded: &quot;How the hell do you think you can make a picture?&quot; But then later another Columbia executive told Quine, &quot;Mr. Cohn tells me you&#x27;re going to direct a picture.&quot;
He was still under contract to MGM when the film was made. The film was successful and Quine was hired to a long-term contract at Columbia.

Quine continued to act for a while. He was third billed in &quot;The Clay Pigeon&quot; (1949), a low budget noir directed by Richard Fleischer and written by Carl Foreman at RKO. He had support roles in &quot;No Sad Songs for Me&quot; (1950) and &quot;Rookie Fireman&quot; (1950), both at Columbia.

At Columbia he directed some comedy shorts: &quot;A Slip and a Miss&quot; (1950) with Hugh Herbert, &quot;Foy Meets Girl&quot; (1950) with Eddie Foy, Jr, &quot;The Awful Sleuth&quot; with Bert Wheeler, and &quot;Woo-Woo Blues&quot; (1951) with Herbert.

In July 1951 he signed a seven-year contract with Columbia to direct.

Quine&#x27;s first solo effort as director was the musical comedy &quot;The Sunny Side of the Street&quot; (1951) starring Frankie Laine. He followed it with &quot;Purple Heart Diary&quot; (1951) with Frances Langford.

===Collaboration with Blake Edwards===
Quine then directed a series of films he co wrote with Blake Edwards: &quot;Sound Off&quot; (1952) with Mickey Rooney, &quot;Rainbow &#x27;Round My Shoulder&quot; (1952) with Frankie Laine, &quot;All Ashore&quot; (1953) with Rooney and Dick Haymes, and &quot;Cruisin&#x27; Down the River&quot; (1954) with Haymes. These were all musicals but they also made a film noir, &quot;Drive a Crooked Road&quot; (1954) with Rooney. Without Edwards, Quine directed &quot;Siren of Bagdad&quot; (1953), for producer Sam Katzman.

Quine and Edwards entered television with &quot;The Mickey Rooney Show&quot; (1954–55) which lasted for a season of 34 episodes. Quine created it and Edwards was chief writer.

Without Edwards, Quine directed episodes of &quot;Footlights Theater&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, and &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot;.

Quine directed the film noir &quot;Pushover&quot; (1954) that launched Kim Novak as a star. Universal-International borrowed him to direct Tony Curtis in a musical, &quot;So This Is Paris&quot; (1954).

Quine helped Edwards write the film that became Edwards&#x27; first feature as director, &quot;Bring Your Smile Along&quot; (1955) with Laine. Edwards and Quine wrote the script for a musical remake of &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot; (1955), which Quine directed, and &quot;He Laughed Last&quot; (1956), which Edwards directed.

===Leading director/producer===
By then Quine was established as one of Columbia&#x27;s leading directors. His films included &quot;The Solid Gold Cadillac&quot; (1956) and &quot;Full of Life&quot; (1956) with Judy Holliday; &quot;Operation Mad Ball&quot; (1957) with Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs, with Blake Edwards helping write the script; &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot; (1958) with James Stewart, Novak, Kovacs and Lemmon. He made &quot;It Happened to Jane&quot; (1959) with Doris Day and Lemmon, produced by Day&#x27;s film production company, Arwin Productions.

Quine set up his own film production company, Quine Productions, and secured a financing and distribution deal through Columbia Pictures. Quine Productions&#x27; first film was &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot; (1960) with Kirk Douglas, Novak and Kovaks; the film was co-produced with Douglas&#x27; film production company, Bryna Productions.

Ray Stark hired him at the last minute to replace Jean Negulesco on &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot; (1960) with William Holden and Nancy Kwan at Paramount. Back at Columbia Quine did the narration for &quot;The Wackiest Ship in the Army&quot; (1960) with Lemmon.

Quine announced he would do several projects for his own company: &quot;The Image Makers&quot; with Glenn Ford, &quot;Roar Like a Dove&quot; with Doris Day, and &quot;The Fannie Brice Story&quot; for Ray Stark. He was also going to do &quot;Man Hunt in Kenya&quot; with William Holden. None of these films were made.

He produced and directed Lemmon, Fred Astaire and Novak in &quot;The Notorious Landlady&quot; (1962), co written by Edwards.

He was going to make &quot;A Bolt Out of the Blue&quot; and &quot;Fair Game&quot; with Holden and direct &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; on Broadway. None of these projects happened.

Quine directed and produced &quot;Paris When It Sizzles&quot; (1964) with Holden and Audrey Hepburn, done for his own company via Paramount. He went to Warner Bros. to direct &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot; (1964) with Curtis and Natalie Wood, then did &quot;How to Murder Your Wife&quot; (1965) with Lemmon.

Quine produced and directed &quot;Synanon&quot; (1965) for Columbia, a little seen film about addicts. He returned to TV producing and directing episodes of the short-lived &quot;The Jean Arthur Show&quot; (1966). That series also lasted one season.

Quine directed &quot;Hotel&quot; (1967) for Warners. He was going to film &quot;Across the River and into the Trees&quot; but it was never made.

Instead he did two films for Paramount, &quot;Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma&#x27;s Hung You in the Closet and I&#x27;m Feelin&#x27; So Sad&quot; (1967) for Ray Stark, and &quot;A Talent for Loving&quot; (1969). He was also meant to film &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; but Herbert Ross ended up doing it, with Barbra Streisand and George Segal.

===Lyricist===
In addition to producing, directing and screenwriting, Quine was a lyricist. He wrote the lyrics &quot;Be Prepared,&quot; a song included in the film &quot;It Happened to Jane&quot; (1959), which he also produced and directed. In 1962, Quine wrote two songs, &quot;Going Steady With a Dream&quot; and &quot;Strangers When We Meet,&quot; the latter the theme to the 1960 film of the same name, which Quine directed, and also for the film &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Twist&quot;. Quine also wrote the theme song to his 1964 film &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot;.

===1970s===
Quine returned to acting with a role in the movie &quot;&quot; (1972).

In the 1970s, Quine directed &quot;The Moonshine War&quot; (1970) at MGM and a pilot for a show based on &quot;Catch-22&quot; starring Richard Dreyfuss.

He directed three episodes of Peter Falk&#x27;s &quot;Columbo&quot;, including &quot;Dagger of the Mind,&quot; an episode set in Britain. He also worked on another, much less successful &quot;NBC Mystery Movie&quot; series, &quot;McCoy&quot;, reuniting him with star Tony Curtis, whom Quine had directed in &quot;So This Is Paris&quot; and &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot; (1964).

Quine&#x27;s other directorial credits include &quot;W&quot; (1974) with Twiggy, and &quot;The Specialists&quot; (1975), and episodes of &quot;Hec Ramsey&quot;, &quot;McCloud&quot; and &quot;Project U.F.O.&quot;.

His final completed film as a director was the film &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1979) starring Peter Sellers. Quine was hired to direct another Sellers film, &quot;The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; (1980). Before the script was even completed, Quine was fired owing to &quot;creative differences&quot; with Sellers.

==Personal life==
Quine was married five times and had three children. His first marriage was in January 1942 to showgirl and model Susan Paley, several years his senior. His second marriage was to actress Susan Peters. They were married on November 7, 1943, at the Westwood Community Church in Los Angeles. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1945, the couple were on a duck hunting trip when Peters dropped her rifle. The gun discharged, hitting Peters in the stomach. The bullet lodged in her spine, leaving her paralyzed from the waist down. On April 17, 1946, the couple adopted a ten-day-old baby boy whom they named Timothy Richard Quine. They separated on March 1, 1948, and were divorced later that year. In October 1952, Peters died of a chronic kidney infection and bronchial pneumonia, both of which were hastened by dehydration and starvation because she had stopped eating and drinking in the last few weeks of her life.

In September 1951, Quine married Barbara Bushman, the granddaughter of actor Francis X. Bushman. The couple had two children before separating in May 1958. They were divorced in March 1960.

While Quine was separated from his third wife, he began dating actress Kim Novak, whom he had previously directed in &quot;Pushover&quot; (1954) and &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot; (1958). In 1959 the two became engaged while working on their third film together, &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot; (1960). They planned to marry when shooting completed on &quot;Strangers&quot; but Novak ended the relationship shortly before the film was completed. He later dated actresses Judy Holliday, whom he had directed in &quot;Full of Life&quot; and &quot;The Solid Gold Cadillac&quot; (both 1956) and Natalie Wood (whom he also directed in &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot; (1964). While directing &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot;, Quine met and began dating one of the film&#x27;s stars, Fran Jeffries. On January 4, 1965, they married in Rosarito Beach, Mexico. The couple separated on June 10, 1968. In July 1969, Quine filed for divorce, citing &quot;extreme cruelty.&quot; Their divorce became final in December 1970.

In 1977, Quine married Diana Balfour. They remained married until Quine&#x27;s death in 1989.

==Death==
After an extended period of depression and poor health, Quine shot himself in the head at his Los Angeles home on June 10, 1989. He was taken to UCLA Medical Center, where he died at the age of 68. His remains are interred in the Room of Prayer columbarium at Westwood Memorial Park in Los Angeles.

<doc id="1048152" wikidata="Q1604722" url="?curid=1048152" title="Naknek Lake">
<text>Naknek Lake is a lake in southern Alaska, near the base of the Alaska Peninsula. Located in Katmai National Park and Preserve, the lake is long and wide, the largest lake in the park. The lake drains west into Bristol Bay through the Naknek River. The elevation of the lake has lowered over the past 5,000 years as it has cut through a glacial moraine, separating Naknek Lake and Brooks Lake and creating Brooks Falls about 3500 years ago.

The earliest Russian explorer reported the lake&#x27;s name as &quot;Naknek&quot;, but a later one said its name was &quot;Akulogak&quot;. Ivan Petrof named the lake Lake Walker, for Francis Amasa Walker, Superintendent of the 1880 United States census.

The lake is famous for its sport fishing, supporting one of the largest king salmon fisheries in southwestern Alaska, though the king salmon are greatly outnumbered by sockeye salmon as well as pink and chum salmon. Large rainbow trout are also common around the lake, along with northern pike, lake trout and Arctic char. Brooks Camp is located on the lake&#x27;s shore where the Brooks River enters the lake over rapids.

==Animals==

Naknek Lake harbors a wide variety of life, typical of the Alaska Peninsula. Typically observed around the lake are Alaska moose, wolves, and occasionally wolverines. However, the lake is most famous for sockeye salmon and grizzly bears. The bears are often seen wandering around the lake or wading into it to catch fish, but they are found in the greatest abundances at Brooks Camp. Bears are seen frequently at Brooks Falls, catching salmon there; they are the main attraction to the lake and Brooks Falls and Camp.

<doc id="1048154" wikidata="Q918843" url="?curid=1048154" title="Yogi Bhajan">
<text>Yogi Bhajan (born Harbhajan Singh Puri) (August 26, 1929 – October 6, 2004), also known as Siri Singh Sahib to his followers, was an American entrepreneur, yoga guru, and putative spiritual teacher. He introduced his version of Kundalini yoga to the United States. He was the spiritual director of the 3HO (Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization) foundation (and business ventures), with over 300 centers in 35 countries. He was accused of sexual abuse by several dozen of his female followers; an investigation called the Olive Branch Report found the allegations most likely true.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Harbhajan Singh Khalsa was born on August 26, 1929 into a Sikh family in Kot Harkarn, Gujranwala district in the province of Punjab (now in Pakistan). His father, Dr. Kartar Singh Puri, served the British Raj as a medical doctor. His mother was named Harkrishan Kaur. His father was raised in the Sikh tradition and young Harbhajan was educated in a Catholic school run by nuns. Singh learned the fundamentals of Sikhism from his paternal grandfather, Sant Bhai Fateh Singh. Theirs was a well-to-do landlord family, owning most of their village in the foothills of the Himalayas.

Singh&#x27;s schooling was interrupted in 1947 by the violent partition of India, when he and his family fled to New Delhi as refugees. There, Harbhajan Singh attended Camp College – a hastily put together arrangement for thousands of refugee students – and was an active member of the Sikh Students Federation in Delhi. Four years later, he graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in economics.

In 1953, Singh entered the service of the Government of India. He served in the Revenue Department, where his duties took him all over India. Eventually, Harbhajan Singh was promoted to a customs inspector at Delhi airport.

In his final years in India, he also learned from Baba Virsa Singh at Gobind Sadan Institute.

=== Coming west ===
In 1968, Singh emigrated to Toronto, Canada equipped with an endorsement from that country&#x27;s High Commissioner to India, James George, who was also a student of his. Harbhajan Singh made a considerable impact in the predominantly Anglo-Saxon metropolis. In three months, he established classes at several YMCAs, co-founded a yoga centre, was interviewed for national press and television, and helped set in motion the creation of eastern Canada&#x27;s first Sikh temple in time for Guru Nanak&#x27;s five hundredth birthday the following year.

=== Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization ===
In 1969, Singh established the 3HO (Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization) Foundation in Los Angeles, California to further his missionary work. His brand of Sikhism appealed to the hippies who formed the bulk of his early converts. The Sikh practice of not cutting one&#x27;s hair or beard was already accepted by the hippie culture, as was Sikh vegetarianism. They liked to experience elevated states of awareness and they also deeply wanted to feel they were contributing to a world of peace and social justice. He offered them all these things with vigorous yoga, an embracing holistic vision, and an optimistic spirit of sublime destiny.
Interest in yoga increased worldwide at this time. To serve the changing times, Singh created the International Kundalini Yoga Teachers Association, dedicated to setting standards for teachers and the propagation of the teachings. 

In 1984 he started the famous Yogi Tea brand.

In 1994, the 3HO Foundation joined the United Nations as a non-governmental organization in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council, representing women&#x27;s issues, promoting human rights, and providing education about alternative systems of medicine.

=== Aquarian age timeline ===

Singh incorporated the storyline of the dawning new age into his teachings, a case of melding Western astrology with Sikh tradition. He proclaimed that &quot;Guru Nanak was the Guru for the Aquarian Age.&quot; It was, he declared, to be an age where people first experienced God, then believed, rather than the old way of believing and then being liberated by one&#x27;s faith.

=== Inter-faith work ===

In the summer of 1970, Singh participated in an informal &quot;Holy Man Jam&quot; at the University of Colorado at Boulder with Swami Satchidananda (another Eastern yogi who has been accused of sexual abuse of his students), Stephen Gaskin of The Farm in Tennessee, Zen Buddhist Jakusho Kwong, and other local spiritual leaders. A few weeks later, he organized a gathering of spiritual teachers to engage and inspire the 200,000 attendees of the Atlanta International Pop Festival on the stage between the performances of the bands.

=== Political influence in U.S. ===
When U.S. President Nixon called drugs America&#x27;s &quot;Number one domestic problem&quot;, Singh launched a pilot program with two longtime heroin addicts in Washington, D.C., in 1972. The program attempted to treat heroin addiction through the practice of yoga and the consumption of garlic juice.

=== Death ===
Harbhajan Singh died of complications of heart failure at his home in Española, New Mexico, on October 6, 2004, aged 75. He was survived by his wife, sons, daughter and five grandchildren. Obituaries appeared in &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, the &quot;Times of India&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;Yoga Journal&quot;. Khalsa&#x27;s passing was noted by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, which closed its offices to commemorate his death.

The State of New Mexico honored him by renaming State Highway 106 as the Yogi Bhajan Memorial Highway. The New Mexico Government took the unprecedented measure of flying its flags at half-mast for two days (Oct 7–8) in honour of Yogi Bhajan after his death on Oct 6, and declared Oct 23 &quot;Yogi Bhajan Memorial Day&quot;.

== Allegations of sexual abuse ==
In 2019, Yogi Bhajan&#x27;s former secretary Pamela Saharah Dyson published the book &quot;Premka: White Bird in a Golden Cage: My Life with Yogi Bhajan&quot;, reporting that she and other women had sexual relationships with Harbhajan Singh.

In March 2020, anti-cult activist Be Scofield published an article in her magazine &quot;The Guru&quot; reporting sexual abuse and rape of female followers and assistants including Dyson by Harbhajan Singh, based on &quot;over a dozen original interviews&quot;.

Later that month (March 2020), the Siri Singh Sahib Corporation commissioned An Olive Branch (AOB) to look into the allegations. The AOB report, published in August, found that it was &quot;more likely than not&quot; that Yogi Bhajan raped three women, injured eight women during sex, engaged in nonconsensual touching of nine people, showed pornography to minors, used sexually offensive language, directed women to shave their pubic hair, and directed women to have sex with other women, that his followers&#x27; claims that he was celibate were inaccurate, and that he &quot;employed a variety of methods to control his students including compartmentalization, quid pro quo, promises, threats, slander, phone calls, guarding, and/or telling women they were his wife.&quot; 

The report acknowledged &quot;the convictions of Yogi Bhajan&#x27;s Supporters as accurate representations of their beliefs&quot; rather than deliberate falsehoods. Soon after, other media published stories based on the report that considered the allegations to be true. The 2023 book &quot;Under the Yoga Mat&quot; by former member GuruNischan includes testimonials of traumatizing experiences shared by former members.

== Reception ==
=== Media coverage ===
In 1977, &quot;Time&quot; published a critical article, titled &quot;Yogi Bhajan&#x27;s Synthetic Sikhism&quot;. The article alleged that Gurucharan Singh Tohra, former President of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), had stated that Harbhajan Singh is not the leader of Sikhism in the Western World as he claimed, and that Tohra had denied the SGPC had ever given Singh the title of Siri Singh Sahib.

Harbhajan Singh is featured in books discussing the successes of Sikhs who migrated from India to the West, including Surjit Kaur&#x27;s &quot;Among the Sikhs: Reaching for the Stars&quot;. and Gurmukh Singh&#x27;s &quot;The Global Indian: The Sikhs&quot;.

=== Scholars&#x27; views ===
Scholars including Verne A. Dusenbery and Pashaura Singh have concurred that Harbhajan Singh&#x27;s introduction of Sikh teachings into the West helped identify Sikhism as a world religion while at the same time creating a compelling counter-narrative to that which identified Sikhs solely as a race with a shared history in India.

Philip Deslippe, a historian of American religion, wrote a 2012 article &quot;From Maharaj to Mahan Tantric: The Construction of Yogi Bhajan&#x27;s Kundalini Yoga&quot;, using 3HO source archive material and news articles to reveal how Harbhajan Singh recreated his own story after his first trip back to India:

=== Popular culture ===
In October 2024, HBO premiered the series Breath of Fire, which talks about the mental and sexual abuse of Yogi Bhajan.

<doc id="1048157" wikidata="Q113329" url="?curid=1048157" title="Magic Kaito">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Gosho Aoyama. It premiered in Shogakukan&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; in June 1987. It is Aoyama&#x27;s first serialized manga. The story depicts the adventures of Kaito Kuroba, a teenage magician who secretly operates as the internationally-wanted phantom thief Kaito Kid.

Though the series was popular in its initial run, Aoyama placed it on hiatus in late 1988—after two volumes had been published—in order to focus on &quot;Yaiba&quot; and later &quot;Case Closed&quot;. Since then, new installments have been produced very sporadically, often years apart; a third volume was compiled in 1994, a fourth in 2007, and a fifth in 2017; three more chapters were published in 2024. Notwithstanding this, Kaito Kid has (along with several associated characters) made numerous appearances in &quot;Case Closed&quot; and various spinoff media, achieving much wider recognition through them.

12 animated television specials based on the series have been produced by TMS Entertainment and aired between 2010 and 2012. A 24-episode anime series titled Magic Kaito 1412 was produced by A-1 Pictures and aired from October 2014 to March 2015.

==Synopsis==
High-school class clown Kaito Kuroba, son of world-famous—and deceased—magician Toichi Kuroba, leads a carefree life in Tokyo with his childhood friend Aoko Nakamori. However, on the eighth anniversary of his father&#x27;s death, he stumbles across a hidden section of his home that reveals his father&#x27;s double life: that of the internationally-notorious thief Kaito Kid. Shortly after, he finds his father&#x27;s elderly aide Konosuke Jii masquerading as Kid in a new series of burglaries; when cornered, Jii admits the &quot;accident&quot; which had killed the elder Kuroba in his final show was actually murder, and the culprits remain at large.

Vowing to avenge his father, Kaito personally assumes Kaito Kid&#x27;s mantle, and continues the heists for the same reason as Jii: to draw out his father&#x27;s killers. By day, he maintains the guise of an ordinary high-schooler and his friendship with Aoko, all while knowing her father is a police inspector long-obsessed with capturing Kid.

After many outlandish adventures, Kaito eventually discovers that the killers belong to a mysterious crime syndicate pursuing a legendary jewel known as &quot;Pandora&quot;. Per their sources, Pandora is a doublet—a gem hidden within a larger gem—that glows red under moonlight and sheds &quot;tears&quot; during the passing of the Volley Comet, every 10,000 years. These tears, if drunk, will bestow immortality.

With the comet&#x27;s next pass fast approaching, Kaito sets out to find—and destroy—Pandora first, turning his focus exclusively to large, long-storied gemstones.

===Characters===
:A smart, quirky and arrogant 17-year-old master illusionist. As Kaito Kid, he occasionally appears in the &quot;Case Closed&quot; series as an antagonist, but slowly develops a Lupin-esque complex. He has some feelings for his childhood friend Aoko Nakamori who he teases constantly. His alter ego is Kaito Kid, a gentleman thief who publicly announces his heists; after his heists, he returns the stolen items to their owners. Throughout his escapades he has made many enemies, from semi-friendly detectives (such as Saguru Hakuba and Conan Edogawa/Jimmy Kudo) and policemen to rival phantom thieves and vicious professional gangsters. His Japanese voice actor is Kappei Yamaguchi and his English voice actors are Jerry Jewell for Funimation and Griffin Burns for Bang Zoom and Macias Group.
:Kaito&#x27;s best friend since childhood and love interest. She is an obstinate, impulsive and lighthearted girl. She often bickers with Kaito at school. She has feelings for Kaito, although she is afraid of admitting to him. She gets along well with Akako, but unknown to her, Akako envies her. Both girls vie for Kaito&#x27;s affections. As the daughter of Inspector Nakamori, she despises Kaito Kid, though she is unaware of the irony. Her Japanese voice actresses are Ayumi Fujimura in the specials and Mao Ichimichi in &quot;Magic Kaito 1412&quot;, Yukiko Iwai in episode 76 of &quot;Case Closed&quot;, Minami Takayama in episode 219 and the fourth OVA of &quot;Case Closed&quot;.
:Aoko&#x27;s father (known as Mace Fuller in Funimation&#x27;s &quot;Case Closed&quot; dub), is a loud, aggressive Tokyo Metropolitan Police inspector assigned to capture Kaito Kid. Tirelessly devoted to his work, he is (much to Aoko&#x27;s dismay) frequently absent-minded at home. His Japanese voice actors are Unshō Ishizuka (1997–2018) and Kōji Ishii (2019–present) and his English voice actor is Jay Jones.
:An elderly man who assisted Toichi Kuroba as both a magician and thief. Eight years after his master&#x27;s murder, he began a masquerade as Kaito Kid in hopes of luring out the killers; when confronted by Kaito, he confessed the truth and conceded the mantle, becoming Kaito&#x27;s assistant. By day he owns and operates the Blue Parrot billiards bar, which Kaito and Aoko sometimes patronize.
:Kaito&#x27;s (supposedly) deceased father. A world-famous magician, he originated the Kaito Kid costume as a gimmick for a Parisian performance, but became a genuine thief in order to divert attention from his wife Chikage&#x27;s own criminal career, allowing her to retire in peace. Initially known as Phantom Thief 1412 (after his Interpol criminal code), he embraced &quot;Kaito Kid&quot; as a moniker after Booker Kudo publicly misread a journalist&#x27;s scrawl of &quot;1412&quot; as &quot;KID&quot;. Toichi was killed after impeding a criminal syndicate&#x27;s pursuit of Pandora. His Japanese voice actor is Shūichi Ikeda.
:Kaito&#x27;s mother, initially shown as a plain housewife but later revealed to have once been the international thief Phantom Lady. During a heist in Paris, she fell in love with Toichi Kuroba and quit her criminal career to marry him. Even in retirement, she remains a free-spirited globetrotter, and frequently leaves Kaito alone at the Kuroba home in Japan, periodically checking in via video calls. She once tried to persuade her son to give up robbery and start a new life as a magician in Las Vegas. It is strongly implied in the &quot;Midnight Crow&quot; Arc that she knows who is Kaito Corbeau, the mysterious rival of Kaito Kid, who had recently become active in Las Vegas.
:A haughty teenage witch, the world&#x27;s last practitioner of &quot;Red&quot; sorcery. She delights in magically charming men to worship her, and becomes obsessed with Kaito Kid upon learning that he is destined to be the only man on Earth immune to her. By happenstance she attends the same school as Kaito and Aoko, and realizes Kaito&#x27;s secret identity when he defies her advances on Valentine&#x27;s Day. Initially, she acts with very few morals, regularly scheming to magically enslave (or even kill) him; in time, however, she comes to admit a genuine affection for him, and begins using her magical resources to warn and aid him against other perils. Her Japanese voice actresses are Miyuki Sawashiro in the &quot;Magic Kaito&quot; specials, Eri Kitamura in &quot;Magic Kaito 1412&quot;, and Megumi Hayashibara in &quot;Case Closed&quot;.
:The half-British, half-Japanese son of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Superintendent-General. Renowned across Europe as an amateur detective, he takes an interest in capturing Kaito Kid and resettles in Japan to do so, becoming a major school rival to Kaito. He is highly sophisticated and arrogantly proud of his skills, suspecting Kaito&#x27;s secret identity almost immediately after their first meeting. However, he never succeeds in securing definitive proof. His Japanese voice actors are Akira Ishida in the &quot;Magic Kaito&quot; specials and in &quot;Case Closed&quot;, and Mamoru Miyano in &quot;Magic Kaito 1412&quot;.
:The main representative of the syndicate that killed Toichi Kuroba, and continues to pursue the Pandora gem. A vicious hitman, he possesses limited intelligence, but is always well-armed and often supported by several subordinates.

===Connections with &quot;Case Closed&quot;===
While &quot;Magic Kaito&quot; has always shared a number of elements with Aoyama&#x27;s later series &quot;Case Closed&quot; (such as the Tropical Land amusement park), Aoyama did not originally view them as a serious shared universe. When planning a &quot;Case Closed&quot; storyline in 1997 guest-starring Kaito Kid and Inspector Nakamori (with cameo appearances from Kaito Kuroba in his civilian identity and Aoko Nakamori), he intended for it to be a standalone, with no impact on either series&#x27; continuity besides a retroactive origin for Kid&#x27;s alias. However, the story&#x27;s unexpected popularity inspired many more Kid appearances throughout &quot;Case Closed&quot;, and even a &quot;Magic Kaito&quot; storyline guest-starring a full-grown Jimmy Kudo.

In 2006, Aoyama explicitly tied &quot;Kaito&quot;&#x27;s backstory into that of &quot;Case Closed&quot;, revealing that Toichi Kuroba had not only maintained a rivalry with Booker Kudo as the first Kaito Kid, but tutored both Vivian Kudo and Sharon Vineyard in disguise arts. A 2010 storyline tied the two series closer still, with a &quot;Case Closed&quot; story introducing Chikage Kuroba&#x27;s identity as the Phantom Lady immediately followed by a &quot;Magic Kaito&quot; story explaining her past (as well as the context of Kaito&#x27;s actions in the present-day).

Despite this, Aoyama has repeatedly stated that the two series exist in separate continuities, in particular citing Akako&#x27;s sorcery as an element that cannot coexist with &quot;Case Closed&quot;. He has also denied longstanding fan theories that Snake belongs to the &quot;Black Organization&quot; serving as &quot;Case Closed&quot;&#x27;s main antagonists, and maintained that—with the one-time exception of 2012&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Train&quot; arc—Kaito Kid would not have any story involvement with the latter.

==Production==
In 1985, having been convinced by university friends to pursue a professional manga career, Aoyama drafted a 40-page one-shot titled . This story, inspired by Aoyama&#x27;s childhood love of mystery and phantom-thief fiction in addition to Zoetrope Studios&#x27; &quot;The Escape Artist&quot; (1982), featured a mischievous teenage magician named Kaito Lupin trying to save his childhood friend Aoko Holmes from corrupt school officials.

Aoyama initially sent &quot;Lupin&quot; to Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot;, where he met enough approval to win an honorable mention at the thirty-fifth New Manga Awards, but was warned by an editor that his art-style would need modification to &quot;fit&quot; the magazine&#x27;s general aesthetic if he were hired. The following year, Aoyama approached Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;, which made no such stipulations; heartened, Aoyama quickly expanded &quot;Lupin&quot; into the basis for an ongoing series, renaming its lead characters Kaito &quot;Kuroba&quot; and Aoko &quot;Nakamori&quot; and converting its mostly-metaphorical Arsène Lupin motifs into an actual phantom thief identity.

==Media==
===Manga===
Written and illustrated by Gosho Aoyama, &quot;Magic Kaito&quot; has been sporadically serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; since June 10, 1987. It was halted in 1988 after two volumes, but new chapters have been occasionally released since then; a third volume was published in 1994, a fourth volume in 2007 and a fifth volume in 2017. In 2011 the first four volumes were republished in &quot;Treasured Editions&quot; from August 15 to December 16. Two versions of each volume were released, one containing a DVD of one of the TV specials. Three more chapters, not yet collected in a volume, were published between April 10 and April 24, 2024.

====Volumes====


===Anime===
====Original video animations====

&quot;Magic Kaito&quot; received its first anime adaptation in 2000, with the launch of &quot;Case Closed&quot;&#x27;s direct-to-video OVA series: the first of these OVAs adapted &quot;Yaiba VS. Kaito!&quot; (Vol. 3&#x27;s fifth chapter, originally published in 1989). The fourth, released in 2004, adapted &quot;Crystal Mother&quot; (Vol. 4&#x27;s first chapter, originally published in 1995).

Between these two OVAs, the &quot;Case Closed&quot; anime also adapted &quot;Black Star&quot; (Vol. 4&#x27;s third and fourth chapters, originally published in 1999) as part of its 219th episode, a two-hour special. This occupied roughly one-third of the episode, with the other two-thirds adapting an unrelated Kaito Kid story from the &quot;Case Closed&quot; manga.

====Specials====
TMS Entertainment produced twelve animated television specials based on &quot;Magic Kaito&quot; between 2010 and 2012. All have been directed by Toshiki Hirano, and aired on Yomiuri TV during &quot;Case Closed&quot;&#x27;s regular time slot. The first three were titled as &quot;&quot;Detective Conan&quot; Specials&quot; despite the fact that none have had anything to do with the &quot;Case Closed&quot; / &quot;Detective Conan&quot; series. The first aired on April 17, 2010.

=====Episodes=====
====Television series====

A 24-episode anime series titled was created by A-1 Pictures and aired on NNS from October 4, 2014, to March 28, 2015. The series was announced as a new simulcast beginning with episode 13 on Crunchyroll for audiences in North America.

<text>The Edward Gorey House, also known as the Elephant House, is the home on Cape Cod in which Edward Gorey—author, illustrator, puppeteer, and playwright—lived and worked from 1986 until his death in 2000. The house currently serves as a museum celebrating Gorey&#x27;s life and work.

Gorey had a respect and passion for animals, cats in particular. The activities of the house, from art education to interactive exhibits, reflect Gorey&#x27;s support of animal welfare.

== Description ==
Gorey collected all sorts of objects; some of them discarded objects found at the side of the road. He arranged and displayed such items on his porch and in the rooms of the house. He also had a large collection of books and an overflowing library.

Elephant House is also notable for the presence of a large southern magnolia tree in its yard, a species not usually found so far north.

== Gallery ==
The Museum has a display of the Edward Gorey binding project.
== Preservation ==
A 2002 grant from the Highland Street Foundation allowed the house to be purchased and the museum to be established.

<text>Roy Owen West (October 27, 1868November 29, 1958) was a Chicago politician who served as U.S. Secretary of the Interior from 1928 until 1929 in President Calvin Coolidge&#x27;s cabinet.

==Biography==
West was born in Georgetown, Illinois, on October 27, 1868, the son of Helen Anna Yapp and Pleasant West. He graduated from DePauw University and was the admitted to the Illinois bar in 1890. West served as assistant attorney for the Cook County, Illinois and then as city attorney for Chicago. In 1898, West was elected to the Cook County Board of Review.

West formed a close political alliance with future Governor of Illinois Charles S. Deneen. West served as the Secretary to the GOP National Committee from 1924 until 1928. President Coolidge appointed West United States Secretary of the Interior from 1928 until before Hoover&#x27;s inauguration in 1929, but after his cabinet service, West returned to Illinois. He was a member of the National Methodist Board of Education from 1936 to 1940. During World War II, West worked as a federal hearing officer for conscientious objector cases.

He died in Chicago, Illinois, and was buried in Rosehill Cemetery there. The Roy O. West Library at DePauw University was named for him.

<text>Woodham Brothers Ltd is a trading business, based mainly around activities and premises located within Barry Docks, in Barry, South Wales. It is noted globally for its 1960s activity as a scrapyard (hence its colloquial name of Barry Scrapyard), where 297 withdrawn British Railways steam locomotives were sent, from which 213 were rescued for the developing railway preservation movement.

==History==
Established in 1892 as Woodham &amp; Sons by Albert Woodham, the company was based at Thomson Street, Barry. The company bought old rope, dunnage wood and scrap metal from the ships, boats and marine businesses which used the newly created Barry Docks, which it then resold or scrapped.

Albert retired in 1947, when his youngest son, Dai, was demobbed from the British Army after World War II. Dai renamed the business Woodham Brothers Ltd in 1953, creating four lines of business under four separate companies, which between them employed 200 people: Woodham Brothers, Woodham Transport, Woodham Marine and Woodham Metals.

===1955 Modernisation Plan/Beeching Report===
As a result of the 1955 Modernisation Plan the decision was made by the British Railways Board in the late 1950s to:
*accelerate the move to diesel- and electric-powered trains, consequently leading to the scrapping of 16,000 steam locomotives
*reduce the wagon fleet from 1.25 million to 600,000

The strategy chosen to replace the steam locomotive fleet initially involved the replacement of steam shunting and branch line locomotives with diesel-electric traction, and the movement of the replaced small steam locomotives to the major railway works for scrapping. In 1958 the British Transport Commission reappraised the speed of the programme, and the decision was taken to accelerate the disposal of the steam fleet. Although the capacity of the locomotive works was considerable, as a result of the 1958 acceleration the amount of storage and technical scrapping capability of the works became stretched. The British Railways Board decided to out-source via tender to selected scrap merchants the work of scrapping the steam locomotives.

===Woodhams scrapyard===
By the mid-1950s, Woodham Brothers was trading mainly as a scrap metal merchants, producing high quality scrap metal for the newly nationalised steel industry. Dai Woodham, as a result of the British Rail decision, negotiated a contract in 1957 to scrap metal mainly from the Western Region, covering like other scrap merchants the easily handled railway line and rolling stock; the more complex steam locomotives were to be handled solely by the railway works. As none of the many South Wales-based scrap merchants knew how long the work from scrapping the short-wheelbase coal wagons from the former South Wales coalfield would last, they all chose to scrap these first.

Each lot of metal was bought at an auction as a piece of rolling stock or infrastructure, with each lot having a priority for scrapping as detailed by British Railways. Woodham&#x27;s premises which were based at Barry Docks, agreed an extended lease with the British Transport Docks Board, over the former marshalling yards of the almost redundant Barry Docks, close to what were the locomotives works of the former Barry Railway Company close to Barry Island. This allowed them to store large quantities of rolling stock that they had bought from British Railways, before they were scrapped.

The 1958 decision resulted in Woodham Brothers winning a tender to scrap locomotives, and in 1959 Dai Woodham went to Swindon Works for a week to learn how to scrap steam locomotives: &quot;It was a completely different job from what we were used to.&quot; On 25 March 1959, the first batch of engines was despatched from Swindon to Barry: GWR 2-6-0&#x27;s numbers 5312/60/92/97 and a single 2-6-2T Prairie tank, 3170 a week later.

However, on delivery of both scrap rail and rolling stock, Woodham&#x27;s found that commercially it was easier to both comply with the contract terms and conditions and turn a profit if they concentrated on the easier to scrap rail profile and rolling stock. There was also at least ten times the volume of wagons, which took up more space and reduced Woodham&#x27;s capacity to bid on more contracts. Hence it was agreed internally to leave the more difficult locomotives until later, perhaps picking up the work when the volume of rolling stock and railway line abated.

From mid-1964, Woodham Brothers won additional contracts to scrap Southern Region stock, and as a result expanded their Barry Docks yard leases to cover more of the former marshalling yards. In 1965, 65 locomotives had arrived at the scrapyard, of which 28 were scrapped, but the additional volume of Southern rail, wagons and brake vans meant that the autumn of 1965 was the last year that mass-scrapping of steam locomotives occurred at Woodham Brothers. Dai Woodham continued to purchase steam locomotives until the end of steam, bringing total purchases by August 1968 to 297 locomotives, including four Austerity saddle tanks acquired from the Longmoor Military Railway, of which 217 then remained at the Barry scrapyard. The scrapyard continued to purchase withdrawn steam locomotives until the end of steam with the last ones to enter the yard including LMS 8Fs No. 48151 and No. 48305, LNER B1 No. 61264, BR Class 4 Moguls No. 76077/79/84, and BR 9F No. 92212. All of them eventually left the scrapyard.

===Preservation centre===

The rows of redundant steam locomotives were a picturesque sight for holidaymakers travelling to Barry Island, and became a centre for pilgrimage for steam enthusiasts from the emerging steam railway preservation movement.

While there was still a significant number of steam locomotives in the yard, railway preservationists began buying the better examples from the late 1960s in order to restore them to working order. The first locomotive to be the subject of a rescue appeal was GWR 4300 Class 5322, which eventually did leave Barry in March 1969, becoming the third locomotive to leave, but the first to be bought and actually moved from the yard was Midland Railway 3835 Class No. 43924 in September 1968. The engine was taken on by the 4F Locomotive Society, and the engine now resides at the Worth Valley Railway.

However, this did not stop the engines from being scrapped as a whole, as in 1972, 4MT Mogul No. 76080 was cut up and the following year, 2884 class No. 3817 was cut up as well.

Under the terms of the contract from British Rail, Woodhams could not sell complete locomotives onwards that had been sold to them for scrap, unless payment of a levy was made. Woodham&#x27;s set the price for each locomotive at its exact scrap value (each type had an exact metal content breakdown from BR, so this was simply taken and multiplied by that day&#x27;s scrap rate for each metal component), plus the BR levy; with the sale price completed by the addition of Value Added Tax, initially set at 10% but raised to 15% in 1979. For most of the time that locomotives were being &#x27;rescued&#x27; from Barry, it became accepted commercial practice by the company for preservation groups to pay a deposit for a particular locomotive, which was then protected/reserved until the group could pay for the locomotive in full and arrange transport.

Initially, locomotives were both mostly complete and able to move easily, although British Rail only allowed them to be towed by one of their own diesels, accompanied by a brake van to act as extra braking. Purchased locomotives were hence moved to a holding siding, inspected by British Rail, and then attached to a special train direct to the purchaser&#x27;s site. However, after some minor incidents involving overheated axle boxes due to a lack of lubrication, BR banned movement by rail from 1976, and all locomotives were thereafter transported out by road to the M4 motorway.

The movement of locomotives to the holding sidings for inspection was also an issue, due to the deteriorating condition of the track in Woodham&#x27;s yard. With the need to occasionally move locomotives in order to retrieve another which had been purchased for preservation, derailments would sometimes occur due to the poor state of the track. As Woodham&#x27;s lacked the necessary equipment to re-rail the locomotives, it was easier to simply cut part of the derailed wheelset away, allowing the movement of the affected locomotive to continue. During this period, Woodham&#x27;s also began scrapping locomotive tenders with the intention of then re-selling the rolling tender frames to other users. The majority of these frames were purchased by the Duport Steelworks at Briton Ferry for conversion to ingot carriers.

From the start of locomotive preservation, owners were allowed to remove components from similar types of locomotives to make up a complete kit of bits, on the condition that the donor locomotive was not reserved and that no substantial damage was incurred in removing the parts. However, this policy combined with ease of access to the extensive yards resulted in petty pilfering and trophy/memorabilia collection in the early years, to mass criminal activity. Although Woodham&#x27;s had allowed weekend working parties to access reserved locomotives, by 1981 illegal removal of valuable scrap had got so bad that Woodham&#x27;s employed a 24-hour security guard team, and a total ban was placed on weekend working parties.

===Barry Steam Locomotive Action Group===
As the number of locomotives dropped below 100, the number of wagons coming for scrap also slowed, making it more likely that Woodham&#x27;s would return to scrapping steam locomotives. Following a meeting of interested parties on 10 February 1979 the Barry Steam Locomotive Action Group was formed with the aim of putting potential purchasers and Woodham Brothers together, as well as funders and financial contributors. BSLAG undertook basic surveys of the remaining locomotives, listing types and conditions and acting as a media liaison point.

However, during the summer of 1980 BR were unable to offer any quantity of redundant wagons to Woodham&#x27;s for scrap. Rather than lay off staff, Dai Woodham authorized the scrapping of two steam locomotives, BR Standard Class 9F No. 92085, and GWR 5101 Class No. 4156. By August, more former steel coal wagons had been delivered to the yard, making 4156 and 92085 the last locomotives to be broken up at Barry.

==Locomotives scrapped at Woodham Brothers scrapyard==
While most steam locomotives made it out of Barry Scrapyard, some were scrapped from 1958 to 1980 and all of the diesel engines, 4 in total, that entered the yard were scrapped, despite some attempts to preserve them.

==Final engines==

Woodham Brothers continued dealing as scrap metal merchants, and continued scrapping locomotives on behalf of British Railways. These included some of the earlier types of diesels ahead of the remaining steam locomotive stock. British Rail Class 21 No. D6122 was the last of its class to survive, arriving in August 1968 and cut up by Woodhams in 1980 because no one wanted to buy it.

After Dai Woodham announced that he was going to retire, a concerted effort was made to clear the remaining hulks. One result of this was that ten locomotives, known as the Barry Ten, were taken on by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and stored in &#x27;scrapyard&#x27; condition. All under the care of the Barry Tourist Railway, eight locomotives are still in Barry only a few hundred yards away from where they were removed, while two are under restoration at different locations around the country. GWR 4575 Class No. 5553 was the last steam engine to leave Woodham Brothers, in January 1990 for the West Somerset Railway. The last member of the Barry 10 GWR 2800 Class No. 2861 left the yard in May 2013 for the Llangollen Railway.

A total of 213 locomotives were &#x27;rescued&#x27; from Woodham&#x27;s yard and many have been restored from 1968 to 1990. By March 2019, 151 ex-Barry locomotives had been restored to working order (the 149th, 150th, and 151st, being BR Standard Class 4 2-6-4T No. 80097, GWR 6959 Class No. 6989 &quot;Wightwick Hall&quot;, and BR Standard Class 9F No. 92134 respectively ), although many of these have since been withdrawn for overhaul and are out of use or awaiting further work.

In the early 1970s, Dai Woodham started building what are now called the Romily Units at the Woodham Road site on No.2 Dock, Barry Docks, for the purpose of giving local business-people access to cheap industrial units. By 1987 he had managed to build up the site to contain 23 industrial units to rent, ranging in size from to , with access to the docks, the railway and the M4 motorway. The main Woodham Brothers business continues to be these industrial units.

==In popular culture==
On their 2008 debut album, London band Silvery released &quot;Warship Class&quot;, a song about a childhood trip to the scrapyard in search of the remaining British Rail Class 41 (Warship Class) locomotive - D601 - &#x27;Ark Royal&#x27;.

One of the engines rescued, and arguably the most famous one of them all, from Barry Scrapyard is GWR 4900 Class No. 5972 Olton Hall, which was rescued in 1981, restored to working order in 1998, and became a pop culture icon in the 2000s for being a part of the Harry Potter films.

Several books have been published about the area, its history, and Dai Woodham&#x27;s work in railway preservation.

<doc id="1048168" wikidata="Q2314929" url="?curid=1048168" title="Big Thing (Duran Duran album)">
<text>Big Thing is the fifth studio album by the English pop rock band Duran Duran. It was released on 17 October 1988 by EMI Records. Produced by the band, Jonathan Elias and Daniel Abraham, it continued the sonic musical change the band explored with their previous album &quot;Notorious&quot; (1986).

Unlike &quot;Notorious&quot; which was funk and R&amp;B oriented, &quot;Big Thing&quot; strives for a more diverse approach. Side 1 consists of intense techno tracks with synthesized bass lines and rhythmic guitar riffs, while Side 2 leans towards a more avant-garde feel with a post modern atmosphere. The band features drummer Sterling Campbell and guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, who previously started work with the band on &quot;Notorious&quot; after the departure of Andy Taylor. Both would become members of the group in 1989.

The album was a moderate commercial success, reaching number 15 on the UK Albums Chart and number 24 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album received mixed reviews by critics, but some praised the experimental compositions and the band&#x27;s evolving musical style. The album would be spearheaded by two top 20 hits: the first, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want Your Love&quot;, which went to number 14 in the UK and number 4 in the US, with the second single &quot;All She Wants Is&quot; reaching number 9 in the UK and number 22 in the US, the last of Duran Duran&#x27;s top 10 hits during the 1980s.

Like &quot;Notorious&quot;, the album would develop a cult following for the band&#x27;s changing musical direction. A CD reissue (with one bonus track) was released in 1994. The album was reissued again by EMI in 2010.

<text>Ian Dawson Tyson (25 September 1933 – 29 December 2022) was a Canadian singer-songwriter who wrote several folk songs, including &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; and &quot;Someday Soon&quot;, and performed with partner Sylvia Tyson as the duo Ian &amp; Sylvia.

==Early life and education==
Ian Dawson Tyson was born on 25 September 1933, in Victoria, British Columbia to George and Margaret Tyson. His father George was an insurance salesman and polo enthusiast who emigrated from England in 1906. Growing up in Duncan, British Columbia, he learned to ride horses on his father&#x27;s farm, and eventually became a rodeo rider in his late teens and early twenties. He took up the guitar while in hospital recovering from a broken ankle sustained in a rodeo accident. Fellow Canadian country artist Wilf Carter was a musical influence. He graduated from the Vancouver School of Art in 1958.

==Career==
After graduation, Tyson moved to Toronto where he began a job as a commercial artist. There he performed in local clubs and in 1959 began to sing on occasion with Sylvia Fricker. By early 1959 Tyson and Fricker were performing part-time at the Village Corner as Ian &amp; Sylvia. The pair became a full-time musical act in 1961 and married three years later. In 1969, they formed and fronted the group The Great Speckled Bird. Residing in southern Alberta, the Tysons toured all over the world. During their years together, the pair released 13 albums of folk and country music.

From 1970 to 1975, Tyson hosted a national television program, &quot;The Ian Tyson Show&quot;, on CTV, known as &quot;Nashville North&quot; in its first season. Sylvia Tyson and the Great Speckled Bird appeared often in the series.

In 1980, Tyson became associated with Calgary music manager and producer Neil MacGonigill. Tyson decided to concentrate on country and cowboy music, resulting in the well-received 1983 album &quot;Old Corrals and Sagebrush&quot;, released on Columbia Records.

In 1989, Tyson was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame. His next albums were cowboy music: &quot;I Outgrew the Wagon&quot; (1989), &quot;And Stood There Amazed&quot; (1991), and &quot;Eighteen Inches of Rain&quot; (1994). Tyson credited Adrian Chornowol with creating a unique sound for his platinum album &quot;Cowboyography&quot;, a unique style that he maintained for the rest of his recording career.

In 2005, CBC Radio One listeners chose his song &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; as the greatest Canadian song of all time on the series &quot;50 Tracks: The Canadian Version&quot;. There was strong momentum for him to be nominated the Greatest Canadian, but he fell short. He has been a strong influence on many Canadian artists, including Neil Young, who recorded &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; for &quot;Comes a Time&quot; (1978). Johnny Cash would also record the same song for &quot;American V: A Hundred Highways&quot; (2006). Judy Collins recorded a version of his song &quot;Someday Soon&quot; in 1968.

Bob Dylan and the Band recorded his song &quot;One Single River&quot; in Woodstock, New York, in 1967. The recording can be found on the unreleased Genuine Basement Tapes, vol. I.

In 2006, Tyson sustained irreversible scarring to his vocal cords as a result of a concert at the Havelock Country Jamboree followed a year later by a virus contracted during a flight to Denver. This resulted in a notable loss of the vocal quality and range he was known for; he has self-described his new sound as &quot;gravelly&quot;. Notwithstanding, he released the album &quot;From Yellowhead to Yellowstone and Other Love Stories&quot; in 2008 to high critical praise. He was nominated for a 2009 Canadian Folk Music Award for Solo Artist of the Year. The album includes a song about Canadian hockey broadcasting icon Don Cherry and the passing of his wife, Rose, a rare Tyson cover written by Toronto songwriter Jay Aymar.

Sylvia joined Ian to sing their signature song, &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot;, at the 50th anniversary of the Mariposa Folk Festival on 11 July 2010, in Orillia, Ontario.

Tyson has also written a book of young adult fiction about his song &quot;La Primera&quot;, called &quot;La Primera: The Story of Wild Mustangs&quot;.

==Personal life==
Tyson&#x27;s first marriage, to his musical partner Sylvia Fricker, ended in an amicable divorce in 1975. Their son Clay (Clayton Dawson Tyson, born 1966) was also a musical performer and has since moved to a career modifying racing bikes.

After the divorce, Tyson returned to southern Alberta to farm and train horses but also continued his musical career on a limited basis. In 1978, Neil Young recorded &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot;, and Tyson used the royalties for a down payment on a cattle and horse ranch. He started playing regularly at Calgary&#x27;s Ranchman&#x27;s Club around this time.

Tyson&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Long Trail: My Life in the West&quot;, was published in 2010. Co-written with Calgary journalist Jeremy Klaszus, the book &quot;alternates between autobiography and a broader study of [Tyson&#x27;s] relationship to the &#x27;West&#x27; – both as a fading reality and a cultural ideal.&quot; CBC&#x27;s Michael Enright said the book is like Tyson himself – &quot;straightforward, unglazed and honest.&quot;

Ian Tyson married Twylla Dvorkin in 1986. Their daughter Adelita Rose was born . Tyson&#x27;s second marriage ended in divorce in early 2008, several years after he and Dvorkin had separated.

A book by John Einarson, &quot;Four Strong Winds: Ian &amp; Sylvia&quot;, was published in 2012. A few years later, Ian said that Evinia Pulos (Bruce) was his &quot;soulmate&quot;; since she lived in Kelowna, a city in south central British Columbia, he said that he was unable to see her often. &quot;We’ve been lovers for 55 years. ... How many people can say that?&quot; Tyson said. In 2018, Tyson made concert appearances in British Columbia and Alberta. His website indicated that in 2019, he was to make two concert appearances, one in Calgary and the other in Bragg Creek, Alberta.

===Death===
Tyson died at his ranch near Longview, Alberta, on 29 December 2022, at the age of 89. According to his manager Paul Mascioli, this followed several health issues, including a heart attack and open heart surgery in 2015.

==Awards and recognition==

Tyson became a Member of the Order of Canada in October 1994 and was inducted into the Alberta Order of Excellence in 2006. In 2003, Tyson received a Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award.

Tyson&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Cowboyography&quot; contained two songs that were later chosen by the Western Writers of America as among the Top 100 Western Songs of all time: &quot;Navajo Rug&quot; and &quot;Summer Wages&quot;.

He was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, with Sylvia, in 1992.

Ian Tyson was inducted into the Mariposa Hall of Fame, with Sylvia, in 2006 

He was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame in 1989. (Sylvia Tyson was inducted in 2003.)

The song &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot;, written by Ian Tyson, was named as the greatest Canadian song of all time by the CBC-Radio program &quot;50 Tracks: The Canadian Version&quot; in 2005.

An announcement in July 2019 stated that Ian Tyson and Sylvia Tyson would be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, individually, not as a duo. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation article stated that &quot;the duo&#x27;s 1964&#x27;s hit, &#x27;Four Strong Winds&#x27;, has been deemed one of the most influential songs in Canadian history&quot;. The report also referenced the song &quot;You Were on My Mind&quot;, written by Sylvia Tyson, as well as her four albums (1975–1980).

===Tribute recordings===
A tribute CD to Ian Tyson, &quot;The Gift&quot;, was released in 2007 on Stony Plain Records featuring &quot;Someday Soon&quot; done by Doug Andrew with Buddy Cage on pedal steel guitar (Buddy played in Great Speckled Bird), &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; recorded by Blue Rodeo, plus another 13 of Tyson&#x27;s best known songs done by major folk and country artists. The album is titled after a song of Tyson&#x27;s, which itself is a tribute to Charles Marion Russell.

<doc id="1048181" wikidata="Q626947" url="?curid=1048181" title="Yaiba">
<text>Yaiba (stylized as Y∀IBA) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Gosho Aoyama. It was serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from September 1988 to December 1993, with its chapters collected in 24 volumes. The manga has been licensed for English release in North America by Viz Media.

The story follows Yaiba Kurogane, a samurai boy raised in the forest by his father who ends up returning to city life in Japan. Yaiba encounters a rival swordsman, Takeshi Onimaru, but when the battle just so happens to end in a stalemate, a humiliated Onimaru is lured into malevolence upon stumbling across a magical katana, culminating in his plans to take over the world with an army of demons. This forces Yaiba and his allies to go on a quest to defeat the newly transformed demon lord, while also encountering several figures from Japanese history and mythology along the way.

A 52-episode anime television series adaptation by Pastel, titled Kenyū Densetsu Yaiba, aired on TV Tokyo and Television Hokkaido from April 1993 to April 1994. A second anime television series adaptation produced by Wit Studio, titled Yaiba: Samurai Legend, is set to premiere in April 2025. The second anime television series adaptation has been licensed by Viz Media.

By May 2024, the manga had over 17 million copies in circulation. In 1993, &quot;Yaiba&quot; received the 38th Shogakukan Manga Award for the category.

==Story==

Yaiba Kurogane is an adventuring boy who knows how to be a samurai and little else. Yaiba lives with his father, Kenjurou, in the forest. One day, while Yaiba was eating, a troop of gorillas came to attack. Yaiba and his father escaped and hid inside a box, but they did not know that the box was full of pineapples and was going to be transported into the city. In the city, Yaiba finds out that he is a legendary warrior and has to fight the evil of a demonic looking high-school student named Takeshi Onimaru.

The people that Yaiba meets along his journey to become a true samurai encourage him, train him, or inspire him to greatness, though at heart he is still a child, and his incredible skill with a sword is matched only by his kindness towards his friends. Though he tends to leap before he looks, and his thick-headedness tends to turn potential allies into enemies, his friends soon clobber him, and salvage the situation. This unlikely group embarks on a host of incredible adventures where they meet legendary figures from Japanese history, and finally overcome impossible odds, and put everything on the line, to save the entire planet from a threat not of this world.

<doc id="1048183" wikidata="Q7756058" url="?curid=1048183" title="The Paradise Motel">
<text>The Paradise Motel are an independent Australian rock band that formed in Hobart, Tasmania. In 1994, they relocated to Melbourne and issued two albums on Mushroom Records, &quot;Still Life&quot; (1996) and &quot;Flight Paths&quot; (1998). After relocating to the United Kingdom, they released a third, &quot;Reworkings&quot; (1999), before disbanding in early 2000. The group reformed in January 2008 and released the albums, &quot;Australian Ghost Story&quot; (2010), &quot;I Still Hear Your Voice at Night&quot; (2011) and &quot;Oh Boy&quot; (2013).

==History==
===1994–1998: Formation and early releases===
The Paradise Motel were formed in Hobart, Tasmania with Matt Aulich on electric guitar, Matt Bailey on bass guitar and Charles Bickford on acoustic guitar. After playing one concert at Kaos Cafe they relocated to Melbourne in 1995. Mérida Sussex, who worked in the St Kilda Public Library, joined on lead vocals. Their line-up was completed by Mark &quot;BJ&quot; Austin on Hammond organ and Tim O&#x27;Shannassy on drums. O&#x27;Shannassy had replaced a &quot;succession of other percussionists [who] had passed through&quot; the band.

Their first Melbourne concert was on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1995 at the Carlton Movie House, beginning a penchant for performing at atypical venues. They joined Bruce Milne&#x27;s management company, The Shining Path, and signed to Mushroom Records which, in 1996, released their début six-track extended play, &quot;Left Over Life to Kill&quot;, via the label&#x27;s offshoot, Infectious Records.

&quot;Left Over Life to Kill&quot; was variously described as &quot;An assured and extremely vivid piece of music&quot;, &quot;In 25 minutes they might very well change the way you listen to music, 9.5/10&quot;, and &quot;Possibly the finest début EP by a band in Australian music history&quot;. McFarlane felt it &quot;contained a number of melancholy pieces&quot; typified by &quot;German Girl&quot;, &quot;Ashes&quot; and &quot;North of God&quot;. &quot;Left Over Life to Kill&quot; reached No. 2 on the Australian Alternative Charts, and became one of the highest selling alternative releases of 1996. A second EP, &quot;Some Deaths Take Forever&quot;, followed – titled from graffito seen at the Brisbane venue, The Zoo. This EP has remixes of two tracks and out-takes from &quot;Left Over Life to Kill&quot;, and a cover version of The Triffids&#x27; song &quot;Raining Pleasure&quot;; it was produced by the band. 2,000 hand-numbered copies were pressed and soon sold out. The cover art on these EPs and some subsequent releases maintained a stylistic uniformity, reminiscent of Penguin Books&#x27; Penguin Classics series. In September 1996 the group toured nationally supporting Tex Perkins.

Early in 1997 The Paradise Motel issued their first full-length album, &quot;Still Life&quot;. Early editions featured an accompanying bonus disc, &quot;Junk Mail&quot;, which consisted of 32-minutes of out-takes. Ahead of the album, in October 1996, they released a single, &quot;Bad Light&quot;. It was described as &quot;a perfect example of the band&#x27;s self-described technique: &#x27;The violence and the silence&#x27;&quot;. In February 1998 they issued a single, &quot;Heavy Weather&quot;, with an attendant film clip. Both highlighted a new lush styling for the band as Mushroom and Infectious Records prepared them for an overseas market. &quot;Calling You&quot; was promoted in the United Kingdom as a CD single. In June they followed with another single, &quot;Derwent River Star&quot;, for the Australian market. In January 1998, they supported the band Stereolab, on their Australian tour. In March, they toured the UK supporting indie rock band Grandaddy and Sparklehorse in July.

===1998–2000: Move to London and disbandment===
In September 1998, The Paradise Motel relocated to the UK and issued their second album, &quot;Flight Paths&quot;. It indicated a denser production, other singles and a UK tour followed. UK magazine, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; had described them as &quot;a deliciously unsettling proposition&quot;. Mushroom and Infectious Records had the group as their first signing to the London-based branch. After touring Europe they followed with a North American tour supporting Mercury Rev, including at the College Music Journal Festival in New York and the North by Northwest Festival. In March 1999 the band released a cover version of The Cars&#x27; 1984 track, &quot;Drive&quot;. In October they followed with &quot;Reworkings&quot;, a compilation of remixes by guests including Mogwai, Mark Eitzel and Echoboy. The remix by Lee Ranaldo, &quot;Lee&#x27;s Trees&quot; was released as a single. The group continued to play shows in the UK with acts such as The Divine Comedy, Smog and Drugstore, though they released no new material and disbanded in early 2000.

===2000–2008: Intervening years===
Following the disbandment of The Paradise Motel, Aulich, Sussex, Austin and O&#x27;Shannassy remained in the UK. Aulich joined indie band, Drugstore before returning to Australia where he formed an alternative country band, Small Sips, with Bailey and Karl Smith of Sodastream. In 2009, Smith and Bailey formed the Melbourne-based band Lee Memorial. Sussex released a solo album before forming Candy with guitarist and producer Paul Jones. In 2003 Sussex co-founded the Stolen Recordings label with Jones and Rachael Robb.

Austin furthered his studies in architecture and married Gina Morris (ex-&quot;NME&quot; journalist and ex-member of Stereolab). O&#x27;Shannassy completed a Doctorate of Philosophy in music and literature in London, and then taught at a number of colleges in New York. Bickford lived in Melbourne for 12 months, before returning to London where he married publicist and journalist Lauren Zoric in 2004. He joined the London band, Paloma &amp; The Penetrators, playing keyboard behind lead singer Paloma Faith. In 2005 he developed and appeared as the resident expert and co-host on a weekly prime time ITV program, &quot;The Golden Lot&quot;, co-hosted with Carol Vorderman. Bickford and Zoric returned to Melbourne in 2007.

===2008–present: Reunification===
In January 2008 The Paradise Motel had reformed with Aulich, Austin, Bickford and Sussex joined by new members Damien Hill on drums and ex-Penthouse bassist Esme MacDonald. They began recording their third studio album, &quot;I Still Hear Your Voice at Night&quot; however the album was not released until 29 January 2011 due to the suicide of Hill in December. Thematically it was considered an extension of their earlier preoccupations; death, disappearances and the Australian wilderness. After the recording Campbell Shaw joined on violin.

Work on a fourth studio record, &quot;Australian Ghost Story&quot; began mid-2009, with the addition of drummer Andy Hazel (ex-Tacoma Radar, School of Emotional Engineering and The Ruby Suns). The album concerns the Azaria Chamberlain disappearance and was issued on the 30th anniversary of her birth, 11 June 2010. The album received positive reviews upon its release.

The following album Oh Boy was released in September 2013. It was announced as the second album in a thematic trilogy examining Australian self-criticism and drive for cultural approbation.

==Musical style==
The Paradise Motel&#x27;s instrumentation typically features two guitars (acoustic and electric), bass, drums, Hammond organ, pedal steel, and occasional accompaniment from a string quartet. The group was considered to be &quot;sonically adventurous&quot; with their frequent deconstruction and reinterpretation of their own songs. Their aesthetic was one of sparseness and melancholia, punctuated by bursts of manic loudness; or, as they once said in an interview, &quot;the violence and the silence&quot;. Their lyrical subjects and vocal style often veered towards the melancholy and macabre. Much of the Paradise Motel&#x27;s songwriting came from Bickford, whilst Aulich was responsible for most string and instrumental arrangements.

<doc id="1048185" wikidata="Q830650" url="?curid=1048185" title="Contestable market">
<text>In economics, the theory of contestable markets, associated primarily with its 1982 proponent William J. Baumol, held that there are markets served by a small number of firms that are nevertheless characterized by competitive equilibrium, and therefore desirable welfare outcomes, because of the existence of potential short-term entrants.

==Theory==
A perfectly contestable market has three main features:
# No entry or exit barriers
# No sunk costs
# The same level of technology is available to incumbent businesses and new entrants.

A perfectly contestable market is not possible in real life. Instead, the degree of contestability can be observed within markets. The more contestable a market is, the closer it will be to a perfectly contestable market.

Some economists argue that determining price and output is actually dependent not on the type of market structure (whether it is a monopoly or perfectly competitive market) but on the threat of competition.

Thus, for example, a monopoly protected by high barriers to entry (for example, it owns all the strategic resources) will make supernormal or abnormal profits with no fear of competition. However, in the same case, if it did not own the strategic resources for production, other firms could easily enter the market, which would lead to higher competition and thus lower prices. That would make the market more contestable. Sunk costs are those costs that cannot be recovered after a firm shuts down. For example, if a new firm enters the steel industry, the entrant needs to buy new machinery. If, for any reason, the new firm cannot cope with the competition of the incumbent firm, it will plan to move out of the market. However, if the new firm cannot use or transfer the new machines that it bought for the production of steel to other uses in another industry, the fixed costs on machinery become sunk costs so if there are sunk costs in the market, they impede the first assumption of no exit barriers. That market will not be contestable, and no firms would enter the steel industry.

It is very important for firms to have access to the same level of technology as that helps determine the average cost of the product. An incumbent firm having more knowledge and access to a technology for the production of a commodity could enjoy higher economies of scale in the form of lower average cost of production. A new firm entering the market, with insufficient information or technology, could incur a higher average cost of production and so be unable to compete with the incumbent firm. That would lead to the incumbent firm enjoying monopoly power and supernormal profit in the market, as the new firm will exit the market. A solution to the problem could be governments providing equal access to knowledge and technology, as well as financial resources for the same.

Its fundamental features are low barriers to entry and exit; in theory, a perfectly contestable market would have no barriers to entry or exit (&quot;frictionless reversible entry&quot; in economist William Brock&#x27;s terms). Contestable markets are characterized by &quot;hit and run&quot; competition; if a firm in a contestable market raises its prices so as to begin to earn excess profits, potential rivals will enter the market, hoping to exploit the high price for easy profit. When the original incumbent firm(s) respond by returning prices to levels consistent with normal profits, the new firms will exit. Because of that, even a single-firm market can show highly competitive behavior.

A concise theoretical statement of contestable markets with an illustrative graph is at Economics Online.

==Application==
The theory of contestable markets has been used to argue for weaker application of antitrust laws, as simply observing a monopoly market may not prove that a firm is exploiting its market power to control the price level. Baumol himself argued based on the theory for both deregulation in certain industries and for more regulation in others.

The applicability of the theory to real-world situations may be questioned, however, particularly as there are very few markets which are completely free of sunk costs and entry and exit barriers. Low-cost airlines remain a commonly referenced example of a contestable market; entrants have the possibility of leasing aircraft and should be able to respond to high profits by quickly entering and exiting. However, it is now generally admitted that Baumol&#x27;s judgment that the US airline industry was therefore best left deregulated was incorrect since the now duly deregulated industry is &quot;well on its way&quot; to evolving into a concentrated oligopoly. More generally, experimental evidence collected since the publication of Baumol&#x27;s paper has suggested that perfectly competitive markets would, if they existed, behave in the way Baumol outlined, but the performance of imperfectly contestable markets (i.e. real-world markets) depends &quot;on actual rather than potential competition&quot; perhaps in part due to the range of &quot;strategic responses&quot; available to incumbents that were not considered by Baumol as part of his theory.

<text>Mark Lucovsky is an American software developer who was previously employed by Google as an Operating System Engineering Director. He also served as the General Manager of Operating Systems at Facebook. Prior to this, he worked at Microsoft and VMware. He is noted for being a part of the team that designed and built the Windows NT operating system, which, starting with Windows XP, became the basis of all current Windows releases.

Lucovsky earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in computer science in 1983 from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. He worked at Digital Equipment Corporation, where he came to the attention of Dave Cutler and Lou Perazzoli. When Cutler and Perazzoli moved to Microsoft to work on their next generation operating system after the cancellation of the PRISM and MICA projects at Digital, they asked him to join them.

Among his contributions to Windows NT was an eighty-page manual that he wrote with Steve R. Wood defining the Windows application programming interfaces for software developers working on the Windows NT platform. He also managed check-ins to the Windows NT source code, tracking each check-in and discussing it with the developer before allowing it to be committed. Lucovsky was instrumental in moving the Windows team from the homegrown SLM revision control system to a custom version of Perforce (SourceDepot).

Lucovsky has stated that Steve Ballmer, on being informed that Lucovsky was about to leave Microsoft for Google, picked up a chair and threw it across his office, hitting a table. Lucovsky also described Ballmer as saying: &quot;Fucking Eric Schmidt is a fucking pussy. I&#x27;m going to fucking bury that guy, I have done it before, and I will do it again. I&#x27;m going to fucking kill Google,&quot; then resumed trying to persuade Lucovsky to stay at Microsoft. Ballmer has described this as a &quot;gross exaggeration of what actually took place.&quot;

Lucovsky worked on the Microsoft .NET My Services product (codenamed Hailstorm) prior to moving to Google. At Google, he served as a Technical Director for the Ajax Search API. He joined VMware in July 2009.

<text>The Atlanta Gladiators are a professional minor league ice hockey team based in Duluth, Georgia. The Gladiators play in the South Division of the ECHL&#x27;s Eastern Conference. They play their home games at Gas South Arena, approximately northeast of Atlanta.

The franchise originated as the Mobile Mysticks in 1995. They suspended operations in 2002 and moved to Duluth in 2003 where they were originally known as the Gwinnett Gladiators. In 2015, they changed their name to the Atlanta Gladiators. They were the South Division and American Conference champions in 2006, falling four-games-to-one to the Alaska Aces in the Kelly Cup finals.

==History==
===Birth of the Gladiators===
The franchise originated as the Mobile Mysticks who played in Mobile, Alabama, from 1995 to 2002. It suspended operations in 2002 due to declining attendance. After a year off, Toby Jeffreys, the owner of the Mysticks, relocated his franchise to Gwinnett County, Georgia, in 2003 and was rebranded the Gwinnett Gladiators. He then sold minority stakes of the franchise to local business owners to create Gwinnett County Hockey, LLC. Jeff Pyle—who served as the Mysticks&#x27; head coach starting in 1998—returned to the franchise for their first season.

The Gladiators made an appearance in the 2006 Kelly Cup Finals, losing to the Alaska Aces in five games.

On July 13, 2011, Pyle was named head coach of the American Hockey League&#x27;s Texas Stars. The Gladiators announced on August 3, 2011, that John Wroblewski, former assistant coach for the Wheeling Nailers, had been selected to take Pyle&#x27;s place as the team&#x27;s head coach. The Gladiators won the ECHL South Division in the two years of Wrobelski&#x27;s tenure.

On August 7, 2013, Wroblewski was hired by the AHL&#x27;s Rochester Americans as an assistant coach. Rick Emmett, a former defenseman for the Gladiators, took over as head coach.

Emmett was relieved of his duties as head coach on December 2, 2014. At the time, assistant coach, and former Gladiator captain, Andy Brandt was named the interim head coach. Brandt would remain the interim head coach through the remainder of the 2014–15 season before being named to head coach on March 21, 2015. Former Valpellice Bulldogs head coach Mike Flanagan also joined the coaching staff in December 2014, serving as the team&#x27;s assistant coach.

=== Rebranding as Atlanta Gladiators ===
Following the 2014–15 season, the Gladiators became the affiliate of the Boston Bruins and their AHL affiliate, the Providence Bruins. On September 9, 2015, the Gladiators organization announced that they would be known as the Atlanta Gladiators to expand their brand to include the entire Atlanta metropolitan area. As part of the name change, the Gladiators updated their “primary” and “wordmark” logos to reflect the Atlanta designation. The rest of the Gladiators logos remained the same, as did the team colors.

After two seasons as head coach, Andy Brandt left to take the associate coaching position with St. Norbert College in 2017. The Gladiators would then hire two-time Kelly Cup winning coach Chuck Weber as his replacement.

During the 2017–18 season, the franchise was purchased by Virginia-based ownership group called Danor Vienna LLC, headed by real estate developer P. Daniel Orlich. Head coach Weber left after one season to take an assistant coaching position with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) NCAA Div. I men&#x27;s team in order to be closer to home. Jeff Pyle was then brought back as head coach and general manager after leaving for the AHL in 2011.

In 2019, the Gladiators updated their primary colors from garnet and black to navy blue and gold.

On October 1, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the Gladiators enacted the ECHL&#x27;s COVID-19 voluntary suspension policy and opted out of playing in the 2020–21 season. The team announced they would return to play in the 2021–22 season.

Prior to the start of the 2022–23 season on October 19, 2022, ownership of the team was transferred to ATL Hockey Group, LLC, led by businessman Alex Campbell with former NHL player and NHL on TNT commentator Anson Carter holding a minority stake. On November 7, 2022, the Gladiators unveiled plans to take on the identity of the former Atlanta Thrashers for a single game on December 16 against the Greenville Swamp Rabbits.

On June 6, 2023, the Gladiators announced former team captain Derek Nesbitt as the sixth head coach in team history. Jeff Pyle, who had served as the team&#x27;s head coach for the previous four seasons, was promoted to Director of Hockey Operations for the club.

==Affiliations==
The Gladiators served as the ECHL affiliate of the NHL&#x27;s Atlanta Thrashers and their AHL affiliate Chicago Wolves from their inception in 2003 until 2011, when the Thrashers franchise moved to Winnipeg and the Gladiators ended their affiliation with the franchise. The team also served as an affiliate for the Chicago Blackhawks during the 2008–09 season and for the Columbus Blue Jackets during the 2009–10 season.

On August 17, 2011, the Gladiators announced their affiliation with the Phoenix Coyotes and the Portland Pirates for the 2011–12 season. They later announced an affiliation agreement with the Buffalo Sabres, and their AHL affiliate, the Rochester Americans. That affiliation lapsed at the end of the 2011–12 season, leaving the Gladiators affiliated exclusively with Phoenix for the 2012–13 season. The Gladiators would carry that affiliation through the end of the 2014–15 season.

On August 6, 2015, the Gladiators announced a two-year affiliation deal with the Boston Bruins and their AHL affiliate, the Providence Bruins. In February 2017, the Gladiators and Bruins extended their affiliation for another two seasons and then added fifth season for 2019–20. In 2021, the Bruins switched their ECHL affiliation to the Maine Mariners and the Gladiators affiliated with the Ottawa Senators.

On August 25, 2022, the Gladiators became the ECHL affiliate for the Arizona Coyotes for the second time.

On June 6, 2023, the Gladiators became the ECHL affiliate for the NHL&#x27;s Nashville Predators and AHL&#x27;s Milwaukee Admirals.

<doc id="1048212" wikidata="Q945437" url="?curid=1048212" title="Marshall Meyer">
<text>Rabbi Marshall T. Meyer (March 25, 1930 – December 29, 1993) was an American Conservative rabbi who became a recognized international human rights activist while living and working in Argentina from 1958 to 1984, during the period of the &quot;Dirty War&quot; in the 1970s. He was elected by president Raúl Alfonsín to be one of the members of the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons.
After the restoration of democracy in 1983, Meyer was awarded the nation&#x27;s highest honor, the Order of the Liberator General San Martín, by the new president.

He has been accused of sexual assault - allegations that were found credible by B&#x27;nai Jeshurun&#x27;s investigation. 

In Argentina Meyer also led the congregation Comunidad Bet El and founded &quot;Seminario Rabínico Latinoamericano,&quot; a Conservative Jewish rabbinical school in Buenos Aires that has trained generations of Spanish-speaking rabbis.

Rabbi Meyer returned to the United States in 1984 and that year became rabbi of Congregation Bnai Jeshurun in New York City. He was called to revive the congregation of the oldest Ashkenazi synagogue in the city.

He was one of those honored by president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner to those who fought for the restoration of democracy in Argentina.

==Early life and education==
Marshall Theodore Meyer was born in Brooklyn New York in a Jewish family and raised in Norwich, Connecticut. He attended Dartmouth College, graduating in 1952. After meeting Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, he enrolled in the Jewish Theological Seminary. Heschel became his mentor and spiritual guide, whose influence and example profoundly affected Meyer&#x27;s career as a religious leader. After receiving ordination in 1958, Meyer was called as a rabbi to the Congregación Israelita de la República Argentina (Templo Libertad), where he worked for two years. He then left and started the Comunidad Bet El in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

==Career in Argentina==

Rabbi Marshall T. Meyer used his energy and charisma to contribute to the Argentine Jewish community. He founded the Seminario Rabínico Latinoamericano&quot;,&quot; a rabbinical school in Buenos Aires that soon became the center of Conservative Judaism in Latin America. In it were ordained dozens of Spanish-speaking rabbis who served communities in Argentina, Latin America, and the rest of the world.

Rabbi Meyer led Comunidad Bet El&quot;,&quot; a congregation that became a model of many other Conservative synagogues, both in Argentina and Latin America. The congregation established its own day-school.

During the years of the military regime of 1976–1983, Rabbi Meyer became a strong critic of the military government and its violations of human rights. He worked to save the lives of hundreds of people who were being persecuted by the regime. He visited political prisoners in jails. He worked with the Israeli government to free the renowned journalist, Jacobo Timerman, who had been persecuted, imprisoned and subjected to extended house arrest. Timerman dedicated his memoir of that time, &quot;Prisoner Without A Name, Cell Without A Number&quot; (1981), to the rabbi. Timerman wrote that Meyer had &quot;brought solace to Jewish, Christian and atheist prisoners&quot;. Meyer additionally founded the Movimiento Judío por los Derechos Humanos, an organization that played a key role in the fight for human rights in Argentina.

In 1983, when democracy was restored in Argentina, the newly elected president, Raúl Alfonsín, recognized the work of Rabbi Meyer by awarding him the highest Argentine decoration, Order of the Liberator General San Martín. Rabbi Meyer returned the United States in 1984.

==Later period==
After a short stay at the University of Judaism (now the American Jewish University) in Los Angeles, in 1984 Rabbi Meyer accepted the position of rabbi at Congregation Bnai Jeshurun in New York City. It is the oldest Ashkenazic synagogue in the city, and he had the mission of reviving the congregation.

Between 1984 and 1993, B&#x27;nai Jeshurun became a thriving liberal community that attracted thousands of Jewish people. The challenging theology espoused by Rabbi Meyer, the spiritually uplifting religious services, an agenda that emphasized social action as a central part of the synagogue&#x27;s principles, ecumenical work with Christian and Muslim clergy, and a leading role in the peace movement in regard to the Arab–Israeli conflict, led to the rapid growth of the congregation. It became a model for many other synagogues in the United States.

== Personal life ==
Meyer married Naomi Meyer, and they had three children: Anita, Dodi and Gabriel.

He died of cancer in 1993 and was buried in the cemetery of the synagogue of his home town in Norwich, Connecticut.

<text>A supporting actor or supporting actress is an actor who performs a role in a play or film below that of the leading actor(s), and above that of a bit part. In recognition of important nature of this work, the theater and film industries give separate awards to the best supporting actors and actresses.

These range from minor roles to principal players and are often pivotal or vital to the story as in a best friend, love interest, sidekick (such as Robin in the Batman series), or antagonist (such as the villain). They are sometimes but not necessarily character roles. In earlier times, these could often be ethnic stereotypes. A supporting actor should usually not upstage the main actor or actress, but often do.

In television, the term day player is used to refer to most performers with supporting speaking roles hired daily without long-term contracts.

In Academy Awards, an annual award is given for the Best Performance by an actor/ actress in a supporting role. There is currently no specific criteria for the difference between nominations for supporting or lead actor/actress roles, so long as the actor&#x27;s dialogue has not been dubbed. Determination of supporting and lead roles are determined by the members of the academy. Critics have pointed out that the leading/supporting roles have &quot;no set rules, no general rational, just vibes&quot; that may stem from racial, social, or gender identity bias.

<doc id="1048228" wikidata="Q5315628" url="?curid=1048228" title="Dunnville">
<text>Dunnville is an unincorporated community located near the mouth of the Grand River in Haldimand County, Ontario, Canada, near the historic Talbot Trail. It was formerly an incorporated town encompassing the surrounding area with a total population of 12,000.

==History==
Dunnville was the site of a Cayuga settlement called &quot;Detgahnegaha&#x27;gó:wah&quot;. The European settlement was originally built as the entrance to the Welland &quot;feeder&quot; canal, and the town once boasted several water-powered mills and a once-bustling canal port. The feeder canal closed in the late 1880s, and the last mill was destroyed and replaced with a condominium complex. There is an impassable dam at Dunnville which regulates the level of the Grand River at Port Maitland, which, in the 19th century, also helped regulate the level of the Welland Canal (from 1829 to 1887 when the third canal began to intake its water directly from Lake Erie). Dunnville was incorporated as a village in 1860 and then as a town in 1900. In 1974, the town amalgamated with the Dunn, Canborough, Moulton and Sherbrooke townships into an enlarged Dunville. In 2001, Dunnville was amalgamated with Haldimand and half of Nanticoke to form Haldimand. What was the incorporated town of Dunnville now consists of Wards 5 and 6 in Haldimand County.
It is located only a few kilometres from Lake Erie, so Dunnville has many private vacation properties.
Dunnville has many events and natural attractions. In June, the annual Mudcat Festival is held to celebrate one of the Grand River&#x27;s most well-known inhabitants. The festival includes a parade, strongman contests, midway and fireworks. Another popular event is the Dunnville Agricultural Fair, held in late August, which includes heavy, light, miniature horse shows, and sheep and goat shows. Dunnville has tennis, golf and swimming facilities and many Bed and Breakfasts and campsites. Tuesday and Saturday are Farmers Market days since the relocation of the local arena. Dunnville is currently constructing a new Farmers Market Pavilion, providing more protection from the elements while helping to support what the local farming has to offer (heating may still be an issue).
The former World War II RCAF Training Base, the Dunnville Airport, offers a unique window on history with its massive hangars and runways. Previously used for recreational flying and skydiving, the airport is now closed due to six large wind-turbine power generators on the airfield. The airport is also home to Haldimand County&#x27;s newest museum, the No. 6 RCAF Dunnville Museum. It has also been the home of the Driver Rehabilitation Centre for the reality television program &quot;Canada&#x27;s Worst Driver&quot; since 2010. The Grand River and nearby Lake Erie offers aquatic activities including swimming, sailing, windsurfing, canoeing and features prime locations for fishing. Nearby are Byng Island Conservation Area, Rock Point Provincial Park and Port Maitland&#x27;s new pier. In the fall, Rock Point hosts thousands of monarch butterflies heading south. Dunnville is also the site of one of Ontario&#x27;s largest expanses of provincially significant wetlands where bird watching and nature photography are popular activities. Smuckers Foods of Canada Co., which operates the Bick&#x27;s Pickle Plant (Dunnville&#x27;s largest factory), employs a small percentage of the town&#x27;s population, mainly students. In 2001, Bick&#x27;s head office facility in Scarborough, Ontario was shut down, and operations were transferred to the Dunnville location, where it remained until the end of November 2011, at which point it closed. This community is the easternmost city that belongs to the Green Energy Hub of Southern Ontario.

===2009 Grand River flood===
On February 13, 2009, the Grand River flooded when the river ice thawed, damaging Cayuga and Dunnville. The next day, the CCGC &quot;Griffon&quot; proceeded up the river to help clear ice.

==Demographics==
===Ethnicity===
Only those populations that comprise more than 1% of the population have been included.
===Language===
As of the 2021 census, 5,585 citizens spoke English only, 140 that spoke both official languages and five that spoke neither.

===Religion===
As of the 2021 census, 3,255 citizens were identifying as Christian and 2,395 as non-religious and secular perspectives.

Public education is administered by the Grand Erie District School Board. Schools located in Dunville include:
* Dunnville Secondary School
* Mapleview Elementary School
* Thompson Creek Elementary School

Catholic Education is administered by the Brant Haldimand Norfolk Catholic District School Board. Catholic schools located in Dunnville include:

<doc id="1048229" wikidata="Q1737299" url="?curid=1048229" title="Kawasaki Ninja 250R">
<text>The Kawasaki Ninja 250R (codenamed EX250; previous generations had market-specific names) is a motorcycle in the Ninja sport bike series from the Japanese manufacturer Kawasaki originally introduced in 1986. As the marque&#x27;s entry-level sport bike, the motorcycle has undergone few changes throughout its quarter-century lifetime, having received only three substantial redesigns. In some markets the Ninja 250R has been succeeded by the Ninja 300.

== Nomenclature ==
Since 2008, the bike is marketed as the Ninja 250R in all markets. It is also referred to by its platform designation, EX250, to which a generational suffix is attached. In the United States, previous models (EX250-E/F/G/H) were already being marketed as members of the Ninja family of sport bikes, while outside of the U.S. the bike was known variously as the ZZR-250, ZX-250, or as the GPX-250R. One of the earliest models, the EX250-C, was given the name GPz-250 (the lower case z representing the air-cooled engine) and was a variant of the GPz-305.

== Model history ==

The Ninja 250R&#x27;s particular ergonomics, chassis design, and engine placement have resulted in a motorcycle that straddles the standard and sport classes. The Ninja&#x27;s riding posture also falls between standard and sport.

=== 1983–1985 (EX250-C) ===
The first generation was produced between 1983 and 1985, and known by the production number EX250-C. It was sold as the GPz-250. Sold only in its home market of Japan, this earliest, belt-driven version was first produced in 1983, and shares no commonality with later generations, but is a variant of the z-250-Scorpion and the GPz-305 range. The bike has 32 mm fork tubes.

=== 1986–1987 (EX250-E) ===
Produced between 1986 and 1987 was the EX250-E. This model was sold as the Ninja 250R in Canada and the U.S. between 1986 and 1987. It was known as the GPZ-250R elsewhere. When originally introduced, it was more costly than the Honda Rebel, and reviewers complained that while the 14,000 rpm redline was nice, the engine was slow to rev.


=== 1988–2007 (EX250-F/EX250-G/EX250-H) ===
For the 1988 model year, there were both cosmetic changes and changes in engine tuning. While the bore and stroke, and other major engine components, were unchanged, minor tuning adjustments were made. The carburetor diameters were reduced 2 mm to , the cylinder compression ratio was increased from 12.0:1 to 12.4:1, ignition timing advance was increased, and the rear sprocket was increased by three teeth to 45. Reviewers reported that this made the engine more free-revving, reaching the high 14,000 redline more quickly, and the tested top speed increased by a few miles per hour. The new, more fully enclosed bodywork was complimented for being stylish, at the time, and easily mistaken for the larger Ninja 750.

The third generation of production of the Ninja 250R encompassed three models:

* EX250-F - The most widespread EX250 variant, the E model was completely revamped and sold as the F model between 1988 and 2007 in the United States. Canada received the model between 1988 and 1999, and it was available elsewhere as the GPX-250R as early as 1987.

* EX250-G - Sold only in its home market of Japan, this version was known as the GPX-250R-II. It had dual front brakes and a wider wheel and tire (110/80-16). All other parts were identical to the -F model. It was sold after 1988.
* EX250-H - This model came to Canada as the Ninja 250R between 2000 and 2002, after which it received a new name: &quot;ZZR-250&quot;, in line with the -H model&#x27;s name elsewhere in the world, where it had existed since 1992. This motorcycle has parts in common with the -F model, though it shares the same engine, albeit with different casings. It sports a lateral aluminum frame, a different fairing (designed to make it look sportier), larger 17-inch wheels, an adjustable rear shock absorber, adjustable brake and clutch levers, a smaller drive sprocket, computer-controlled timing advance, and a revised electrical system. It also had a smaller carburetor, &amp; slightly different compression ratio, both of which were designed for quicker revving and slightly higher top end power. However, these upgrades came at a 6 kg weight gain. 

=== 2008–2012 (EX250-J) ===

In 2008, Kawasaki gave the EX250 its most extensive redesign in twenty years. The EX250-J model is known as the Ninja 250R worldwide, regardless of market.

Parts from the third generation are still found on the -J, but its redesigned exterior panels bring the Ninja&#x27;s appearance out of the 1990s and into line with late-2000s sportbikes. The engine and drivetrain retain 30% of the -F model&#x27;s parts, according to Kawasaki. The engine&#x27;s compression and maximum torque have been lowered to provide better midrange performance. The redesign of the engine resulted in improvements in engine response at low engine speeds, making the bike smoother and &quot;much easier to ride.&quot;

Though the previous generation Ninja 250R had a peak power advantage of , the new version&#x27;s 20 or 30 percent increase in mid-range power allows the bike to pull from 3,000 rpm where previously it had to be revved to 4,000 rpm.
The U.S. -J model uses dual carburetors like the -F model, but the European, Brazilian and Thai models have fuel injection. The wheels were increased in size to 17 inches, the front suspension was improved, and the brake rotors were replaced with a larger petal shape. On the carbureted version, a fuel gauge was added in place of the temperature gauge. With the additional and redesigned equipment, the EX250-J suffered a increase in wet weight over its predecessors.

With the arrival of the EX250-J, manufacturing continues to be located in Thailand.



=== 2013–2017 (EX250-L/EX250-M) ===

The 2013 Ninja 250R had a new bodywork, twin headlights, a digital instruments cluster, new wheels with a wider rear tire, and a reworked engine and exhaust. ABS is available as an option. Like the previous generation, the engine is fuel injected in some markets and carbureted in others. For 2013, in some markets, the Ninja 250R was replaced by the Ninja 300 (EX300), while in others they are sold alongside each other.

=== 2018– (EX250-P) ===
At the 2017 Tokyo Motor Show, Kawasaki introduced the 2018 Ninja 250R along with the all-new 2018 Ninja 400, with the latter to be sold in Europe and America, replacing the Ninja 300.

<doc id="1048232" wikidata="Q3483846" url="?curid=1048232" title="Silent Scope (video game)">
<text>is a 1999 arcade game by Konami. The game puts the player in the shoes of a sniper during a series of terrorist incidents. It is the first in the &quot;Silent Scope&quot; series.

== Plot ==
The U.S. First Family, including the president of the United States, returns from a function in Chicago when their convoy is ambushed by terrorists. In the resulting confusion, the terrorists manage to capture the entire First Family, and are demanding the release of their leader (the dictator) in exchange for the safe return of the president. Washington officials have decided to resolve the problem quietly, using military force.

The player assists police at the scene of the kidnapping, from several high rise structures and after making a choice on tactics, the player defeats one of the terrorist leaders and manages to rescue the president&#x27;s daughter in the process. Next the player pursues a terrorist boss in order to safely rescue the President&#x27;s Wife. Finally, the player makes an invasive entry into the terrorist base. After fighting through the heavily guarded mansion, the player defeats Monica and liberates the President himself. However, the dictator is making a getaway and the player exhausts nearly an entire magazine on bulletproof glass and has only one bullet left to eliminate the dictator.

== Gameplay ==
The game uses a rifle that is mounted on the console, requiring players to physically alter their position in order to shoot accurately. In addition, the rifle&#x27;s scope displays a close-up view of a small portion of the screen, representing the sniper&#x27;s long-range view of the area where the rifle is pointed. Certain stage areas are dark and require players to use night vision scopes to spot and shoot opponents. The player can fire five shots in succession before reloading is required.

Players have limited time and health during gameplay. Extra time can be gained by killing certain enemies, while training the scope on an attractive woman awards extra health and bonus points. The game consists of three stages corresponding with the members of the First Family. In each stage, the player(s) must kill as many enemies as possible in short time facing sub bosses along the way and a large boss at the end. Unless a precise, lethal head shot is made, it will take more than one bullet to kill a sub-boss or boss. Enemies can shoot the player if they are not killed fast enough. Players must take care not to shoot innocent civilians in the crossfire. During game stages the player is able to choose one of two (easy, hard) or three (easy, medium or hard) paths to progress, facing a different boss and doing a different following mission depending on the choice made.

Points are scored based on where an opponent is hit, multiplied by the number of successful shots the player has made. In arcade mode, the best points are given for headshots, but on the practice range, bonus points are obtained for shooting the human shaped targets&#x27; guns.

The home versions have a cheat code where one can exchange life for time and vice versa. There are also secret codes for all versions that will make the game more difficult, such as hiding target indicators on enemies.

== Reception ==
The initial console ports of &quot;Silent Scope&quot; received moderately positive reviews from magazines of the time. The review aggregation website Metacritic places its average score at 63%, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot; however this score is based on a low, unrepresentative sample of reviews.

Brett Alan Weiss of &quot;AllGame&quot; said the arcade version was &quot;a blast to play, though a few more realistic sniper missions would be nice. Graphics are acceptable with decent animation, but the music is indiscernible during the action. The voice acting is unintentionally hilarious.&quot; Major Mike of &quot;GamePro&quot; said of the PlayStation 2 version in its November 2000 issue, &quot;In a field devoid of competition, &quot;Silent Scope&quot; is a strong first-generation offering and a picture-perfect arcade conversion. While a debatable purchase, &quot;Scope&quot; easily qualifies as a must-rent title.&quot; An issue later, Jake The Snake said that the Dreamcast version&#x27;s several training courses &quot;offer diverse fun, including no-missed-shots allowed, pop-up targets, and moving targets. But you should rent &quot;Silent Scope&quot; before buying to see if you&#x27;ll want to keep playing after a few hours.&quot; &quot;Edge&quot; gave the same Dreamcast version a score of seven out of ten, saying that &quot;it won&#x27;t take most players long to complete the game, but &quot;Silent Scope&quot; is all about high scores through high accuracy. That&#x27;s what Konami needed to port the consoles, and the one shot, one kill moments moments of euphoria and despar crystallise this as a success.&quot; Randy Nelson of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the PS2 version, &quot;It&#x27;s not groundbreaking, but it&#x27;s a solid shooting game with unique play mechanics.&quot; In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave the GBA version a score of 23 out of 40.

Also in Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the arcade version in their September 1, 1999, issue as the second most-successful dedicated arcade game of the month.

<doc id="1048241" wikidata="Q2303566" url="?curid=1048241" title="2004 Israeli operation in the northern Gaza Strip">
<text>The 2004 Israeli operation in the northern Gaza Strip took place when the Israel Defense Forces launched Operation &quot;Days of Penitence&quot; (), otherwise known as Operation &quot;Days of Repentance&quot; in the northern Gaza Strip. The operation lasted between 29 September and 16 October 2004. About 130 Palestinians, and 1 Israeli were killed.

The operation, focused on the town of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia and Jabalia refugee camps, which were said to have been used as launching sites of Qassam rockets on the Israeli town of Sderot and Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip, and in particular in response to the death of two children in Sderot.
The operation&#x27;s name corresponds to the Hebrew name for the High Holiday season during which the operation was carried out.

== Overview ==

Following the death of two Israeli children from a Qassam rocket launched by Palestinian militants, Israel launched a major military invasion of the northern Gaza Strip, focusing on the towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia and the Jabaliya refugee camp. The stated goal of the operation, code-named &quot;Days of Penitence&quot; (ימי תשובה) by the Israeli Defence Force, was to prevent Palestinians from launching rockets and mortar shells into Israeli settlements in Gaza and the town of Sderot in Israel.

During this 17 day attack the Israeli military killed some 130 Palestinians; demolished at least 85 houses and damaged hundreds more; damaged public facilities, including schools, kindergartens and mosques, and destroyed farmland. According to Israeli soldiers, many of the buildings that were demolished were used by Palestinian militants as a cover for launching Qassam rockets and for shooting anti-tank missiles.

During the UN Security Council deliberations over censuring Israel for this military attack, Israel accused the United Nations Relief and Welfare Agency (UNRWA) of complicity in Palestinian attacks by allowing its vehicles to transport rockets. The Israeli government released a video claiming that it showed rockets being loaded into the UNRWA ambulance. UNRWA denied the accusation and demanded an apology stating that the object was a stretcher, not a rocket (the person in the video was carrying the lightweight object with just one hand). On October 6, Israel retracted the accusation.(Reuters)
&quot;See further discussion here&quot;.

The attack resulted in a proposed Security Council resolution condemning the Israeli action, calling for Israeli withdrawal and respect for human rights of Palestinians. The resolution was vetoed by the United States on October 5 who criticized it for ignoring terrorism against Israelis.

Over the weekend of October 17, the Israeli military announced that its troops withdrew from the Jabalia refugee camp and other populated areas and redeployed to positions nearby and proclaimed the attack a success, with a warning that the troops would return if the rocket attacks resume, which analysts from both sides say is likely. Israel &#x27;redeploys&#x27; in Gaza, but who won?

Both sides claimed victory in the operation.

Capt. Jacob Dallal, an Israeli Defence Forces spokesman, acclaimed the operation&#x27;s success: &quot;We really impaired the ability to shoot Qassams from Jabalya. We engaged many cells and now there are fewer Hamas members to shoot rockets,&quot; he says. &quot;We dealt a hard blow to the whole Hamas infrastructure in Jabalia.&quot; Israel &#x27;redeploys&#x27; in Gaza, but who won?

The Palestine Information Center published a statement by Hamas spokesman Ismail Hanneya who asserted that the problem was not in resistance or in Qassam missiles but rather in what Hamas views as the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land: &quot;Hamas achieved a victory over the Zionist enemy ... the blows of the resistance and the steadfastness of the people caused the occupying forces to withdraw without achieving any of their goals.&quot; Hamas: Resistance forced occupation to retreat

Tanks fired shells towards the densely populated block killing Ismail Muhammad As Sawalha, 70, Ahmad Salih Al Tahrawi, 21, and Ali Abdul Kareem Shaath, 23. In addition, Khadra Shoman, 75, was wounded by shrapnel wound to the head. Israeli press, however, reported that the Tahrawi and Shaath were armed militants.

===October 15===
* Israeli Defence Forces prevented a launch of Qassam rocket from Jabalia refugee camp. According to soldiers from the Golani Brigade, militants were accompanied by children, who helped carry the rockets to the launch site. The army refrained from using a helicopter gunship because of the presence of children allegedly being used as human shields. Israeli forces report that infantry units engaged the militants with warning shots causing them to flee, abandoning the launcher and other equipment. (Haaretz)
* At 12:05am today, Israeli forces launched a missile towards Block (7) in Jabalia camp. Two Palestinians, Muhyi Ad Din Al Madhoun, 19, and Nidal Harb Masoud, 20, were killed. Several homes were also damaged in the attack.
* Three armed militants, two of al Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades and one of Hamas were killed in Jabalia by Israeli Air Force strike. (Haaretz)
* IDF begins to redeploy in northern Gaza area. Troops, armored forces and engineers pull-back from Jabalia, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun. The forces remain on alert to reenter the area if a Qassam rocket should be launched. (Haaretz)
* An IDF investigation regarding the death of Iman Darweesh Al Hams in Rafah on October 5 cleared the Givati Brigade platoon commander on the scene of charges by fellow soldiers that he emptied his rifle magazine into the girl&#x27;s body as she lay wounded. The IDF accepted the commander&#x27;s claim that he fired into the ground near the girl after coming under fire in a dangerous area. The officer was suspended from duty pending the outcome of a police investigation. (BBC)(Maariv)
* In Rafah, two soldiers are lightly injured from an anti-tank missile. (Haaretz)
* The Israeli army in the evening began withdrawing from Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza as &quot;a gesture to the Palestinians ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan&quot;, which began that Friday and entered Rafah in southern Gaza, to continue their military operations.

===October 16===
* One al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades militant, hit on Friday, died from his wounds.(Haaretz)
* The US State Department welcomed the Israeli withdrawal and stressed the U.S. government position that Palestinians were responsible &quot;for ending violence and terror, and particularly for ensuring that this area - that no area is used for attacks on Israel with rockets.&quot;

== Allegations of Israeli war crimes ==

In 2005 and 2006 Adalah requested the Military Advocate General (MAG) to initiate a criminal investigation into events that took place during &quot;Operation Rainbow&quot;. In 2007 also for &quot;Operation Days of Penitence&quot;. All requests had been denied. On 15 April 2007, Adalah, PCHR and Al-Haq filed a petition, in which they asked the Israeli High Court of Justice to order a criminal investigation, referring to many local and international organizations who had accused Israel of committing war crimes. Not earlier than two years later, on 6 May 2009, the Court held a hearing. Another 1.5 years later, on 8 December 2011, the Court rejected the petition because, according to the Israeli judges, the request was too late and too unspecific, the aim of the operations was justified, and a criminal investigation was not the most appropriate tool.

== Casualties ==

The casualties from 28 September to 16 October 2004 are as follows:

===Israelis===

* One soldier
* One woman
* Two children

===Palestinians===
* According to Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, from 28 September to 14 October: 129 people killed, including 31 children
* According to Haaretz: 129 Palestinians: 68 members of the military wing of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad; 42 civilians
* According to B&#x27;Tselem: 133 Palestinians, including at least 50 civilians
* According to IDF: circa 130 people, most of them armed militants; 9 or 10 civilians
* According to Reuters: some 50 Hamas fighters; at least 62 militants and 43 other Palestinians believed to be civilians

<text>Smithville is a community in the township of West Lincoln, Niagara Region, Ontario, Canada. The former police village is located on Highway 20 between Hamilton and Niagara Falls. Smithville is the largest population centre and governing centre of the township of West Lincoln.

==History==
Smithville was first settled by Richard Griffin and his family, including his sons Abraham, Edward, Nathaniel, Isaiah, Smith, Jonathan, and Richard Jr., United Empire Loyalists who came from Nine Partners, New York in 1787. They settled on Lots 8, 9, 10, Concession IX, on the Twenty Mile Creek in Grimsby (later South Grimsby) Township. Solomon Hill, who married Bethia, daughter of Richard Griffin, settled on Lot 6, Charles Meridith on Lot 7; Thomas Harris on Lot 11, and Thomas North on Lot 12. These lots, all in the 9th Concession became the settlement first known as Griffintown, but later renamed after Mrs. Griffin, whose maiden name was Mary Smith.

Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Griffin is sometimes claimed to be the real founder of the village. He was the one who felled the first tree, chose the village site, cleared the first acre of land, built the first house, and lived his entire life in the village. His brother, Smith Griffin, another of Richard Griffin&#x27;s sons is credited with building a treadwheel in 1810. Settlers who wanted their grain ground were required to provide their own motive power by putting their oxen on the tread. Later, Smith Griffin built a dam and mill on the Twenty Mile Creek, making the treadmill obsolete. Smith also started an ashery, while Edward opened a general store.

By 1849, Smithville had reached a population of about 150, and had been granted a post office with twice-weekly delivery. The settlement had a grist mill, a saw mill, a carding machine and cloth factory, four stores, one machine shop, one tannery, two blacksmiths, two tailors and two shoemakers.

Smithville first became a police village in 1887, however the arrangement was unsatisfactory and the village again became part of South Grimsby Township in 1889. It was not until 1914 that Smithville was reorganized into a police village on a more permanent basis. By the 1950s, the population had grown to approximately 1,000.

Smithville, along with the remainder of South Grimsby Township was amalgamated into the newly formed Township of West Lincoln on January 1, 1970.

==Demographics==
Population:
* Population in 2016: 5489
* Population in 2011: 4391
* Population in 2006: 4122
* Population in 2001: 3317

Mother tongue:
* English as first language: 92.2%
* French as first language: 0.6%
* English and French as first language: &gt;0.1%
* Other as first language: 7.2%

Patron:
* Lord S. Grey

==Economy==
Retail establishments in Smithville are congregated amongst two major nodes: the downtown core, and the Village Square Mall.

==Arts and culture==

Until 2017, Smithville held an annual agricultural festival called PoultryFest.

The Smithville Fair was historically held at the West Lincoln Mixed Use Recreation Site (formerly Smithville Fairgrounds). The Smithville Agricultural Society merged with the Lincoln Agricultural Society in 2012, and the fair was moved to the nearby West Niagara Fairgrounds, where the agricultural fair is held annually before Labour Day.

==Attractions==
===Parks===
Parks in Smithville include the Smithville Conservation Area, and the Mixed Use Recreational Site (MURS).

The &quot;Murgatroyd Parkette&quot; is at the corner of Griffin and St. Catharines Street. It has trees and benches, and features the town clock (from the original post offices) mounted on a pedestal. Once was a tie factory, this location was occupied by Hellbender Ink Vintage Tattoo, becoming it&#x27;s very first tattoo shop in 2013.

The Smithville Branch of the West Lincoln Public Library is located at the West Lincoln Community Complex and Arena on West St. and is open six days a week.

The Kiwanis of West Lincoln was chartered in May 2018 and currently meets at the Smithville Legion (172 Saint Catharines St.) every Tuesday at 7 pm

==Government==
In some ways Smithville acts as the &quot;administrative centre&quot; of the Township of West Lincoln. The council chambers and the largest branch of the municipal library are located in town, as well as the major fire station. The public works yard is also centralized in a Smithville location.

From 1970 to 2018, Smithville fell just north of the boundary of two municipal wards. The area north of Townline Road, the bulk of the community, was part of Ward 3, the former Township of South Grimsby. New development south of Townline, mainly the Alma Acres, fell into Ward 2, the former Township of Gainsborough. In 2018, a revision of ward boundaries placed Smithville and its environs into a new, smaller Ward 3.

West Lincoln elects one regional councillor, in addition to the Mayor who also serves as the local regional council.

Federally and provincially, Smithville is located in the riding of Niagara West.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Smithville is located on two regional roads . Regional Road 20, formerly King&#x27;s Highway 20, goes primarily east-west, connecting Smithville with Niagara Falls and Hamilton. Regional Road 14 connects Smithville to Grimsby and the Queen Elizabeth Way in the north, and Highway 3 in the south. 

Smithville is located he Canadian Pacific&#x27;s Hamilton Subdivision, the mainline of the former-Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway. Smithville had a passenger station until 1981, when all such service along the line was discontinued. The former station (built 1903) is a local landmark, and serves as the headquarters of the West Lincoln Historical Society.

Smithville was also the junction with the railroad&#x27;s Dunnville spur. Passenger service along the Dunnville line was suspended in 1933. Freight service lasted until 2003, when the line was abandoned. The tracks were subsequently lifted and the bridges over the Twenty Mile Creek and Highway 20 demolished.

==Education==
Smithville has five schools, including four elementary and one secondary.

Smithville Public School, on Colver Street, opened in 2018 in the former South Lincoln High School. Coincidentally, the now disused College Street Public School had been the location of Smithville High School until 1948.

St. Martin&#x27;s, on West Street (Highway 20) is an elementary school in the Catholic (separate) board. John Calvin (Station Street) associated with the Canadian Reformed Church and Cairn Christian (Townline Road) are private Christian schools.

Smithville Christian High School, formerly Smithville District Christian High School, is a Christian secondary school and the only remaining secondary school in town, after the closure of South Lincoln High School for the 2017-2018 school year, which ended over 150 years of public secondary education in the community.

<text>Ninetynine (styled as ninetynine) is an indie band based in Melbourne, Australia. The band was founded by Laura MacFarlane, who played drums in Sleater-Kinney, in 1996 as a solo project. The first album, &quot;99&quot;, was recorded with her playing all the instruments. Not long after she assembled a band with Cameron Potts, Rhonda Simmonds (who has since left the group) and Iain McIntyre (who played with Laura in several earlier bands). Other former members of the band include Michelle Mansford and Amy Clarke. Meg Butler joined in 2006.

Ninetynine&#x27;s music has been described as art-pop, combining elements of indie rock, post punk and power pop with strong melodic elements and a playful approach. Some of their songs incorporate experimental elements such as unusual time signatures or exotic scales. One of the band&#x27;s trademarks is the use of Casiotone keyboards and chromatic percussion (typically a vibraphone) in their music, with the musicians frequently swapping instruments between songs, even sometimes in the middle of songs.

<text>Meryn Cadell is an American-Canadian writer and performance artist. He is an assistant professor of song lyrics and libretto writing in the Creative Writing Program at University of British Columbia.

==Early life and education==
Cadell was born in Brooklyn, New York, grew up in Waterloo, Ontario, and later moved to Toronto in the mid-1980s. Cadell is a graduate of the Ontario College of Art and Design.

==Career==
Cadell re-released an independent cassette titled &quot;Mare-In Ka-Dell&quot; in 1988 while active as a performance artist in Toronto&#x27;s Queen Street West scene. As a performance artist, Cadell was particularly known for performing with a heating duct to add reverb.

Cadell soon signed to Intrepid Records, and recorded with Jim Creeggan of Barenaked Ladies, Bob Wiseman and members of Rheostatics. Those sessions were released in 1991 as the album &quot;Angel Food for Thought&quot;, whose first single &quot;The Sweater&quot; became a surprise hit in Canada in 1992 and was very popular on college radio and alternative stations in the United States. &quot;The Sweater&quot; is a spoken word monologue with a musical backing track—a remixed sample of Syd Dale’s jazzy instrumental track “Walk and Talk”. The monologue revolves around a girl&#x27;s thoughts about a boy&#x27;s sweater. Canadian figure skater Josée Chouinard performed a memorable, high-scoring routine to &quot;The Sweater&quot; at the 1997 Ladies&#x27; Professional Championships final in Pensacola, Florida.

In 1993, Cadell released a follow-up album, &quot;Bombazine&quot;, on Sire Records. This album featured guest appearances by Rheostatics, Ben Mink, Tyler Stewart, Anne Bourne and John Alcorn. Following the album, Cadell took a hiatus from music to do human rights work with PEN Canada. Cadell also wrote an independent film, which was never produced.

In 1997, Cadell returned to music with the album &quot;6 Blocks&quot; on the independent label Handsome Boy Records.
Guest performers on this outing included Anne Bourne, Mary Margaret O&#x27;Hara, Chris Wardman and Jason Sniderman (Blue Peter), Paul Brennan (Odds) and Martin Tielli.

Following that album, Cadell retired from the music business. He publicly came out as transgender on Bill Richardson&#x27;s CBC Radio One program &quot;Bunny Watson&quot; on October 2, 2004, although he had already been out to friends and family for a number of years.

In 2007, Bongo Beat released an expanded edition of &quot;Angel Food for Thought&quot;, including two tracks that were previously available only on cassette as well as the video for &quot;The Sweater&quot;. The CD was remastered by Graemme Brown. Cadell is also known for the Christmas song &quot;The Cat Carol&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cadell is a transgender man who transitioned in 2003.

<text>The 1997 MLS Expansion Draft was held November 6, 1997. Two teams participated, the Chicago Fire and Miami Fusion F.C., both expansion Major League Soccer clubs starting play in the 1998 season.

==Format==
Each team in the league made ten players, including at least one foreign player, available for the Fire and Fusion to select. From this pool of available players, the two teams then selected twelve players. Although Paul Caligiuri of the Los Angeles Galaxy was listed as exposed, he had recently won a lawsuit against the league which forced the league to place him with the Galaxy as his original contract with the league had stipulated. Consequently, he was not available for selection. The Fire won the first selection through a coin toss. The draft was held via conference call.

<doc id="1048289" wikidata="Q5048950" url="?curid=1048289" title="Casiotone">
<text>Casiotone was a series of home electronic keyboards made by Casio in the early 1980s. Casio promoted the Casiotone 201 (CT-201) as &quot;the first electronic keyboard with full-size keys that anyone could afford&quot;. The name &quot;Casiotone&quot; disappeared from Casio&#x27;s keyboard catalog when more accurate synthesis technologies became prevalent, but the brand was reused for new models launched in 2019.

The first Casiotone keyboards used a sound synthesis technique known as vowel-consonant synthesis to approximate the sounds of other instruments (albeit not very accurately). Most Casiotone keyboards were small, with miniature keys designed for children&#x27;s fingers, and were not intended for use by professional musicians; they usually contained a rhythm generator, with several user-selectable rhythm patterns, and often the means to automatically play accompaniments. 

==Families==

The original Casiotone keyboards came in three distinct families, separated by the method of synthesis. 

* The famous VL-Tone VL-1 (1981) uses a method of sound synthesis based on the Walsh function.
* Keyboards such as the CT-202 () use vowel-Consonant synthesis. The later model of this family, the MT-65, is one of the more well known and sought after models, as it also contains auto-accompaniment drum beats and bass lines.
* Some other keyboards (such as the MT-35 and MT-45) use a combination of two different binary weighted numbers (1 and 64). The larger weight bit provides the fundamental, and the smaller weight bit provides the harmonic complexity.

The later, more professional range of keyboards, the CZ series (1984–1986), used phase distortion synthesis, which is mathematically almost identical to Yamaha&#x27;s frequency modulation synthesis, although implemented slightly differently in order to avoid patent infringement.

After the release of the Casio SK-1 in 1985, gradually PCM sample-based tone generators became dominant in Casio&#x27;s keyboards line. After the 1990s, most Casio keyboards utilized PCM tone generator or its variants.

Some early 1980s models in the PT series of keyboards, such as the PT-30, PT-50, PT-80 and PT-82, were not marketed under the Casiotone name. The name was revived again later for models such as the PT-87 (which is basically the same as the PT-82) which was again sold as Casiotone.

==ROM packs==

Some models sold from 1983 onwards included a cartridge bay to accept Casio ROM Packs which contained sheet music in a digital format. The keyboards could play the notes automatically, or (with the exception of the PT-50) illuminate LEDs above each key to teach the user how to play the song. Most keyboards came with one ROM Pack as standard, but a large number of additional packs, covering a wide range of musical genres, were available to purchase separately. The last ROM Pack model was the CT-840, which came out in 1990. 
== Users ==
The low cost and abundance of Casiotone keyboards made them fairly common fixtures in garage rock bands. Musicians and bands known to use Casiotone keyboards include Alexis Taylor of Hot Chip, TG Miller of Black Camaro, Dan Deacon, Lettie, Maurizio Arcieri of Krisma, Kevin Parker of Tame Impala, Turnstyle, Trio, Ozma, Hedluv, and Chiara Lee of Father Murphy.

== Relaunch ==
In 2019, Casio relaunched the series with three new Casiotone keyboards.

<doc id="1048294" wikidata="Q969667" url="?curid=1048294" title="Ubykh people">
<text>The Ubykh ( ; ; ; ) are an ethnic group of the Circassian nation, represented by one of the twelve stars on the green-and-gold Circassian flag. Along with the Circassian tribes of Natukhai and Shapsug, the Ubykh formed the Circassian Assembly (Adyghe: Адыгэ Хасэ) in 1860. Historically, they spoke a distinct Ubykh language, which never existed in written form and went extinct in 1992 when Tevfik Esenç, the last speaker, died.

==History==

The Ubykh used to inhabit the capital of Circassia, Sache (Circassian: &quot;Шъачэ&quot;, lit. seaside) — present-day Sochi, Krasnodar Krai, Russia. The province of the Ubykh tribe was situated between the Shapsug tribe near Tuapse and the Sadz (Dzhigets) in the north of Gagra. The Ubykh tribe were mentioned in book IV of Procopius&#x27; &quot;De Bello Gothico&quot; (&quot;The Gothic War&quot;), under the name βροῦχοι (&quot;Bruchi&quot;), a corruption of the native term tʷaχ. In the 1667 book of Evliya Çelebi, the Ubykh were mentioned as Ubúr without any other information.

The Ubykh were semi-nomadic horsemen, and had a finely-differentiated vocabulary related to horses and tack. Some Ubykh also practiced favomancy and scapulimancy. However, the Ubykh gained more prominence in modern times. By 1864, during the reign of Tsar Alexander II, the Russian conquest of the Northwestern Caucasus had been completed. The other Circassian tribes and the Abkhaz were decimated, and the Abaza were partially driven out of the Caucasus.

Faced with the threat of subjugation by the Russian army, the Ubykh, as well as other Muslim peoples of Caucasus, left their homeland &quot;en masse&quot; beginning on 6 March 1864. By May 21, the entire Ubykh nation had departed from the Caucasus. They eventually settled in a number of villages in western Turkey around the municipality of Manyas.

In order to avoid discrimination, the Ubykh elders encouraged their people to assimilate into Turkish culture. Having abandoned their traditional nomadic culture, they became a nation of farmers. The Ubykh language was rapidly displaced by Turkish and other Circassian dialects; the last native speaker of Ubykh, Tevfik Esenç, died in 1992.

Today, the Ubykh diaspora has been scattered about Turkey and—to a much lesser extent—Jordan. The Ubykh nation &quot;per se&quot; no longer exists, although those who are of Ubykh ancestry are proud to call themselves Ubykh, and a couple of villages are still found in Turkey where the vast majority of the population is Ubykh by descent.

Ubykh society was patrilineal; many Ubykh descendants today know five, six, or even seven generations of their agnatic ancestry.

<text>Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands is a graphic adventure game, developed by Zombie LLC, published by Activision, and released in 1996 for Windows 95, MS-DOS, and Macintosh. It is the eleventh game in the &quot;Zork&quot; series, and is the first title not to be marketed under the Infocom label.

The story, which is darker and less comical than previous &quot;Zork&quot; games, focuses on players investigating the sudden disappearance of four prominent figures and their children at the hands of a mysterious being known as the &quot;Nemesis&quot;, uncovering a sinister plot during their investigations that they must thwart. The game&#x27;s live-action cast included Lauren Koslow, W. Morgan Sheppard, Allan Kolman, Stephen Macht, Paul Anthony Stewart, Merle Kennedy, and Bruce Nozick.

The game received favorable reviews, despite some criticism of the puzzles and lack of relevance to the Zork setting, and won the 1996 Spotlight Award for &quot;Best Prerendered Art&quot;. The game was later re-released by GOG to be compatible with later Windows editions.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Zork Nemesis&quot; operates from a first-person perspective and uses a simple point-and-click system. The cursor fundamentally allows for interaction with the player&#x27;s surrounding, changing to symbolize what can be done; a bronze arrows for movement between locations or for changing view angles; a gold arrow for interaction with objects; and a hand icon for objects that can be picked up, or highlight where collected objects can be used. Each location, ranging from corridors, small rooms, and vast halls, can be viewed in panoramic 360-degree to find objects to examine and interact with, with a still screen used when zooming in to examine an object in more detail (i.e. a book). Items collected by the player are stored in a simple inventory that be cycled through with the right mouse-button.

Puzzles in the game generally require the player to find clues that will help them solve it, with puzzles being solved by either finding the right objects to use on them, or finding the right combination of actions to trigger an effect; a score system mostly denotes when a player has completed a section of the game&#x27;s story.

==Story==
===Setting===
The game takes place in the fantasy world of Zork, in a region called the Forbidden Lands found within the boundaries of the Great Underground Empire. The player initially is restricted to exploring an ancient temple complex called the Temple of Agrippa, but later gains access to further areas to explore: the Frigid River Branch Conservatory, a musical school and performance hall situated close to Flood Control Dam #7; Steppinthrax Monastery, an abandoned monastery that has fallen into disrepair; Grey Mountains Asylum, a mental institution in the frigid, frozen peaks of the Grey Mountains; and Castle Irondune, a military fort and private museum situated in the Irondune desert.

===Characters===
* Alexandria Wolfe (portrayed by Merle Kennedy) - A young woman gifted with a talent for music, who mysteriously died at the Temple of Agrippa.
* Doctor Erasmus Sartorius (portrayed by Allan Kolman) - Head of the Grey Mountains Asylum, conducting alchemical research to complete his father&#x27;s work into finding the fifth alchemical element.
* Bishop Francois Malveaux (portrayed by W. Morgan Sheppard) - Head priest of the Steppinthrax Monastery, and foster father of Alexandria.
* General Thaddeus Kaine (portrayed by Stephen Macht) - Decorated army officer, serving as the commander of Castle Irondune.
* Lucien Kaine (portrayed by Paul Anthony Stewart) - A soldier based at Castle Irondune, son of Thaddeus.
* Madame Sophia Hamilton (portrayed by Lauren Koslow) - Head of the Frigid River Branch Conservatory, and Alexandria&#x27;s music teacher.
* &quot;Nemesis&quot; (voiced by Bruce Nozick; portrayed by Paul Anthony Stewart) - A mysterious entity that took over the Temple of Agrippa, seeking out the fifth element by torturing the missing people at Agrippa.
* The Player - A nameless adventurer, charged to investigate the Forbidden Lands and the disappearance of four prominent citizens.
* Karlok Bivotar - An agent of the Empire, assigned by Syovar to the mission the Player assumes in the wake of Bivotar&#x27;s death.

===Plot===
Vice Regent Syovar the Strong, ruler of the Great Underground Empire, assigns the Player with the task of continuing an investigation that was previously assigned to one of Syovar&#x27;s agents, Karlok Bivotar. The investigation sought to uncover what happened to four prominent members of the Empire - Doctor Erasmus Sartorius, General Thaddeus Kaine, Bishop Francois Malveaux, and Madame Sophia Hamilton - and investigatage rumours of a curse across a region known as the Forbidden Lands. The Player is sent to the Temple of Agrippa, within the Forbidden Lands, where Bivotar had tracked down the missing people before dying at the hands of a being called &quot;Nemesis&quot;. Upon arriving, they encounter the spirit of a young woman named Alexandria, who claims the temple has fallen under a great evil.

Inside the main building of the complex, the Player finds that Sartorius and the others secretly were working as alchemists, each mastering one of the four main alchemical elements - Air, Fire, Earth, and Water - and were seeking the fifth element when Nemesis killed them. Finding their elements and using them to revive them partially, the group reveal how Nemesis is seeking the fifth element, known as &quot;the Quintessence&quot;, for their own reasons, and was responsible for not only killing them, but also Alexandria, Francois&#x27; daughter, and Thaddeus&#x27; son Lucien. Subduing Nemesis with what magical power they have, Sartorius implores the player to find the labs each created for themselves, and create their respective element&#x27;s alchemical metal in order to fully restore them to life.

Visiting each location, the Player learns how the group came together. Sartorius sought to find the fifth element, continuing his father&#x27;s research, but found that it required mastery of the four alchemical elements and their metals. He thus recruited the aid of Francois, Thaddeus, and Sophia, each of whom agreed to help for their own personal reasons. To achieve their aim, they found they needed the pure soul of a person born during a solar eclipse that coincided with an alignment of the planets linked to the elements. Sartorius found such a child was due to be born at his asylum, and thus separated it from the mother to be raised by Francois, the child being Alexandria. Sophia then helped educate her in music, all while secretly teaching her a musical song that would cleanse her soul when the group used her to acquire the fifth element.

Upon creating the pure metals, the group are restored, whereupon the Player learns that the Nemesis is really Lucien, who was against their plans to sacrifice Alexandria, whom he had fallen in love with. Lucien had managed to disrupt the ritual, killing the alchemists, and was seeking to revive Alexandria. Imploring the Player to prevent the ritual being completed, he hands them a gold ring, whereupon they recover another that Alexandria had. Uncovering a hidden lab beneath the temple, the Player purifies the rings to form the fifth element, powered by love, which they then use on the ritual. The fifth element kills the alchemists, destroys the temple, and revives Lucien and Alexandria back to normal, who choose to move on and live in peace, inviting the Player to join them.

==Production==
&quot;Zork Nemesis&quot; employed technology Activision dubbed &quot;Z-Vision Surround Technology,&quot; which gives users a simulated 360-degree view of each location visited. It was one of the first games to employ such technology, though &quot;Zork Nemesis&quot; only allows panning in either horizontal or vertical where both panning options are available, unlike in later games such as &quot;The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time&quot; or &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot;. Furthermore, details were far more difficult to make out in the panoramic scenes than in the still screens; the sequel, &quot;&quot;, made significant improvements to the Z-Vision system. Technical director Laird Malamed felt the game suffered from time constraints, saying that once the advanced game engine was completed, the team didn&#x27;t have enough time left to implement anything more than simple control panel puzzles.

Like other adventure games of its time, &quot;Zork Nemesis&quot; made use of live actors. The game features a significant amount of screen-time for the actors, thanks to its use of flashbacks at key locations (or objects) and the use of monologues in which characters address the player explaining and justifying their actions.

The game&#x27;s plot was written by Cecilia Barajas, Nick Sagan and Adam Simon and is a departure from the series usual comedic treatment in its games, by featuring a much darker and less humorous story than previous games. The budget of &quot;Zork Nemesis&quot; surpassed $3 million. The live-action scenes contributed to this cost, which ultimately rose to around USD$3.5 million. The game was heavily marketed, with an estimated $1 million spent on this aspect.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. &quot;Next Generation&quot; said, &quot;With 3D sound and stunning graphics (the game is almost worth the price just to examine the fantastic architectural environments), this game was destined for five stars, until the puzzles – and these are what really count, to us, anyway – dragged the game back down.&quot;

&quot;Zork Nemesis&quot; placed 10th on &quot;PC Data&quot;″s monthly computer game sales chart for April 1996. It secured positions 12 and 11 the following two months, respectively. By November 1996, &quot;Zork Nemesis&quot; had sold above 100,000 units. According to Activision, strong sales of the game during the 1996 holiday shopping season contributed to high revenues in the company&#x27;s third quarter, which increased 78% over the third quarter of 1995.

&quot;Zork Nemesis&quot; won the 1996 Spotlight Award for &quot;Best Prerendered Art&quot; from the Game Developers Conference. It was also nominated for the 1996 &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot; awards of &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot;, &quot;PC Gamer&quot;, CNET Gamecenter and &quot;Computer Game Entertainment&quot;, but these went variously to &quot;The Neverhood&quot;, &quot;The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery&quot; and &quot;The Pandora Directive&quot;. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; highlighted &quot;Nemesis&quot;″s &quot;charm and vitality&quot;, and called it &quot;graphically gorgeous&quot;.

In 2011, &quot;Adventure Gamers&quot; named &quot;Zork Nemesis&quot; the 51st-best adventure game ever released.

<text>John Varley (17 August 177817 November 1842) was an English watercolour painter and astrologer, and a close friend of William Blake. They collaborated in 1819–1820 on the book &quot;Visionary Heads&quot;, written by Varley and illustrated by Blake. He was the elder brother of a family of artists: Cornelius Varley, William Fleetwood Varley, and Elizabeth, who married the painter William Mulready.

==Life and work==
John Varley was born at the &quot;Old Blue Post Tavern&quot;, Hackney, on 17 August 1778. His father, Richard Varley, born at Epworth in Lincolnshire, had settled in London after the death of his first wife in Yorkshire. His mother was an alleged descendant of the regicide Oliver Cromwell through the marriage of his daughter, Bridget, and the Parliamentarian soldier and politician General Charles Fleetwood. Varley&#x27;s parents discouraged his leanings towards art, and placed him under a silversmith. But on their death he was for a brief time employed by a portrait painter in Holborn and then, at the age of 15 or 16, he became a pupil of Joseph Charles Barrow (fl. 1789–1802) who had an evening drawing school twice a week at 12 Furnival&#x27;s Inn Court, Holborn. It was Barrow who took Varley on a sketching tour to Peterborough from which he emerged as a professional painter. In 1798 he exhibited a highly regarded sketch of Peterborough Cathedral at the Royal Academy and became a regular exhibitor at the RA until the foundation of the &quot;Old Watercolour Society&quot; in 1805.

In 1799 he visited North Wales, and in its wild mountain scenery found the subjects best suited to his brush. He returned there in 1800, and again in 1802, and the impressions then received powerfully influenced the whole course of his art. He married Esther Gisborne on 14 November 1803 at St. James, Piccadilly, London, and became brother-in-law to Muzio Clementi in 1810 when the latter married Emma Gisborne.

Varley exhibited more than 700 works at the OWS, of which he was one of the founders. He also became a highly successful drawing master, his pupils including Copley Fielding, David Cox, John Linnell and William Turner (artist) of Oxford. Despite his success, his growing family meant he was constantly in financial difficulties, &quot;since he was both a hopeless businessman and by temperament something of a Micawber&quot;. (Mallalieu). Varley was particularly skilled at the laying of flat washes of watercolour which suited the placid, contemplative mood that he often sought to evoke.

Varley published &quot;A Treatise on the Principles of Landscape Drawing&quot;, 1816–21 and &quot;A Practical Treatise on the Art of Drawing in Perspective&quot;. He also wrote an astrological text (with illustrations) entitled &quot;A Treatise on Zodiacal Physiognomy&quot; in 1828.

He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;Varley&#x27;s landscapes are graceful and solemn in feeling, and simple and broad in treatment, being worked with a full brush and pure fresh transparent tints, usually without any admixture of body-colour. Though his works are rather mannered and conventional, they are well considered and excellent in composition. Some of his earlier water-colours, including his &quot;Views of the Thames,&quot; were painted upon the spot, and possess greater individuality than his later productions, which are mainly compositions of mountain and lake scenery, produced without direct reference to nature.&quot;

<text>Minimum Chips were an Australian electronic and rock band formed in Brisbane, Queensland in 1993. They issued their debut studio album, &quot;Kitchen Tea Thankyou&quot;, in November 2005. The group had disbanded by early 2007.

== History ==

Minimum Chips were formed in Brisbane in 1993 by Julian Patterson on guitars, drums, keyboard and electric piano; Nicole Thibault on vocals, organ, synthesiser and trombone; and Ian Wadley on drums, guitar, trumpet and synthesiser. During their Brisbane years Minimum Chips supported international acts: Stereolab, Bikini Kill and Pavement.

Minimum Chips&#x27; first release was a split 7-inch five-track extended play on Chapter Records in September 1995. Two tracks were supplied by Perth-based band Molasses. The group&#x27;s three tracks were recorded in June of that year at Fortitude Valley, Queensland. Guy Blackman, the label&#x27;s co-owner, eventually joined them on bass guitar in 1998.

In 1996 the group followed with a four-track EP, &quot;Blip&quot;, and then a split single, with &quot;Postal&quot; by Minimum Chips, and Alastair Galbraith providing the other side. Their next EP, &quot;Swish&quot;, appeared in 1997 via Varispeed Records, with five tracks, which featured their signature song &quot;Furniture&quot;.

Matt Thrower of &quot;Rave Magazine&quot; caught their gig at The Capitol in October 1998, he opined, &quot;A mantra-like effect was conjured by simple guitar and keyboard melodies. The vocals melded well with the heady surrounds and the overall atmosphere was warm and inviting... this was the Minimum Chips sound I like to hear, as opposed to their more peculiar work supporting Tortoise earlier in the week.&quot;

The group relocated to Melbourne in the late 1990s, where they signed to a local label, Trifekta. Their first release there was an eight-track EP, &quot;Freckles&quot;, in September 1999, which featured the vocals of Pat Ridgewell of cult Brisbane band, Small World Experience. In 2002 Chapter Records released a CD compilation album, &quot;Portfolio&quot;, of Minimum Chips&#x27; early material. Also in that year Patterson and Thibault undertook a side project, Letraset, which issued an album, &quot;Snowy Room&quot;. By August 2003 Blackman (also in Sleepy Township) had relocated to Tokyo and was replaced in Minimum Chips by Ellen Turner on bass guitar. Blackman returned to the group after Turner relocated to China.

Their influences are varied and include 1960s film soundtracks—&quot;Sunny Spot&quot; from &quot;Gardenesque&quot; (21 July 2003) contains portions of &quot;Les Caids&quot; from French composer François de Roubaix—and French pop, indie rock and krautrock. Using a small but effective palette of instruments from guitar, bass and drums to Yamaha Electone organ, trombone and glockenspiel, Minimum Chips have managed to achieve a cult following in Australia.

&quot;Australian Music Online&quot;″s Andrew White felt that &quot;Gardenesque&quot; was &quot;22 minutes&#x27; worth of musical ambiguity seems to me the best way to describe this short record. Ambiguity I say, because when you first listen it&#x27;s all oh-so-vague to you; moreover, it struggles to define itself between any two tracks, but I&#x27;m not complaining, don&#x27;t get me wrong.&quot; Releases such as &quot;Gardenesque&quot; and &quot;Sound Asleep&quot; show further musical progression and exploration into more complicated structures while still retaining their evocative, intimate and eclectic sound.

On 14 November 2005 Minimum Chips issued their debut studio album, &quot;Kitchen Tea Thankyou&quot;, via Trifekta. Sophie Best of &quot;The Age&quot; felt it was &quot;a surprising, intoxicating work evoking the exotic and faraway, rather than the local and familiar.&quot; It was co-produced by Patterson with Greg Walker, who Best observed had &quot;created fluorescent textures and shimmering surfaces that don&#x27;t entirely disguise the home-made charm suggested in the title.&quot;

Minimum Chips released a second compilation album, &quot;Lady Grey&quot;, in 2006 via Moteer Records. They disbanded in early 2007, but briefly reunited in November 2012 to play a gig to celebrate Chapter Music&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

<text>What a Cartoon! (later known as The What a Cartoon! Show and The Cartoon Cartoon Show) is an American animated anthology series created by Fred Seibert for Cartoon Network. The shorts were produced by Hanna-Barbera Cartoons; by the end of the run, a Cartoon Network Studios production tag was added to some shorts to signal they were original to the network. The project consisted of 48 cartoons, intended to return creative power to animators and artists, by recreating the atmospheres that spawned the iconic cartoon characters of the mid-20th century. Each of the shorts mirrored the structure of a theatrical cartoon, with each film being based on an original storyboard drawn and written by its artist or creator. Three of the cartoons were paired together into a half-hour episode.

&quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; premiered under the &quot;World Premiere Toons&quot; title on February 20, 1995. The premiere aired alongside a special episode of Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; called &quot;World Premiere Toon-In&quot;, which features interviews with animators Craig McCracken, Pat Ventura, Van Partible, Eugene Mattos, and Genndy Tartakovsky, as well as model Dian Parkinson. During the original run of the shorts, the series was retitled to &quot;The What a Cartoon! Show&quot; and later to &quot;The Cartoon Cartoon Show&quot; until the final shorts aired on August 23, 2002.

The series is influential for helping to revive television animation in the 1990s and serving as a launching point for the Cartoon Network animated television series &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot;, &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot;, &quot;I Am Weasel&quot;, and &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;. Once it had several original shorts, those became the first Cartoon Cartoons. From 2005 to 2008, &quot;The Cartoon Cartoon Show&quot; was revived as a block for reruns of older Cartoon Cartoons that had been phased out by the network.

== History ==
=== Origins and production ===

Fred Seibert became president of Hanna-Barbera Cartoons in 1992 and helped guide the struggling animation studio into its greatest output in years with shows like &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot; and &quot;SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron&quot;. Seibert wanted the studio to produce short cartoons, in the vein of the Golden age of American animation. Although a project consisting of 48 shorts would cost twice as much as a normal series, Seibert&#x27;s pitch to Cartoon Network involved promising 48 chances to &quot;succeed or fail&quot;, opened up possibilities for new original programming, and offered several new shorts to the thousands already present in the Turner Entertainment library. According to Seibert, quality did not matter much to the cable operators distributing the struggling network, they were more interested in promising new programs.

With Turner Broadcasting CEO Ted Turner and Seibert&#x27;s boss Scott Sassa on board, the studio fanned out across the world to spread the word that the studio was in an &quot;unprecedented phase&quot;, in which animators had a better idea what cartoons should be than executives and Hanna-Barbera supported them. The company started taking pitches in earnest in 1993 and received over 5,000 pitches for the 48 slots. The diversity in the filmmakers included those from
various nationalities, race, and gender. Seibert later described his hope for an idealistic diversity as &quot;The wider the palette of creative influences, the wider and bigger the audiences.&quot;

Seibert&#x27;s idea for the project was influenced heavily by &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;. Hanna-Barbera founders and chairmen William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, as well as veteran animator Friz Freleng, taught Seibert how the shorts of the Golden Age of American animation were produced. John Kricfalusi, creator of &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, became a teacher of sorts for Seibert and was the first person Seibert called while looking for new talent for the project.

As was the custom in live action film and television, the company did not pay each creator for the storyboard submitted and pitched. For the first time in the studio&#x27;s history, individual creators could retain their rights, and earn royalties on their creations. While most in the industry scoffed at the idea, encouragement, according to Seibert, came from the cartoonists who flocked to Hanna-Barbera with original ideas.

=== Format ===
The format for &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; was ambitious, as no one had ever attempted anything similar in the television animation era. The shorts produced would be a product of the original cartoonists&#x27; vision, with no executive intervention: for example, even the music would be an individually crafted score. Each 7-minute short would debut, by itself, as a stand-alone cartoon or a stand-alone series on Cartoon Network. Three of the 7-minute cartoons are paired together into a half-hour episode. Seibert explained the project&#x27;s goal in a 2007 blog post: &quot;We didn’t care what the sitcom trends were, what Nickelodeon was doing, what the sales departments wanted. [...] We wanted cartoons.&quot;
=== Crew ===

The &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; staff had creators from Europe (Bruno Bozzetto), Asia (Achiu So), and the United States (Jerry Reynolds and colleague Seth MacFarlane). The crew also contained young series first-timers (like Genndy Tartakovsky, Craig McCracken, Rob Renzetti, Butch Hartman, and John R. Dilworth), but veterans as well (like Don Jurwich, Jerry Eisenberg, and Ralph Bakshi). In addition to the veterans, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera each produced two shorts each for &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot;. Many of the key crew members from previous Hanna-Barbera series &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot; joined the team of &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; as well.

Many of its crew members later went on to write and direct for &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot;, &quot;I Am Weasel&quot;, and &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, including those named above. &quot;The Kitchen Casanova&quot; director John McIntyre is particularly known for directing several &quot;Dexter&quot; episodes. Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s series (&quot;Malcom and Melvin&quot;) was considered too risqué to be shown. It has been rumored that John Kricfalusi was slated to direct several new &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; shorts of his own (produced by his production company, Spümcø). However, both &quot;Yogi Bear&quot;-influenced cartoons were commissioned separately by Seibert, and instead premiered as their own: &quot;Boo Boo Runs Wild&quot; and &quot;A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith&quot; both premiered in 1999.

Inspired by Seibert&#x27;s interest in the modern rock posters of Frank Kozik, each of the shows&#x27; creators worked with the internal Hanna-Barbera Creative Corps creative director Bill Burnett, and senior art director Jesse Stagg, to craft a series of high quality, limited edition, fluorescent art posters. The Corps launched a prolonged guerrilla mailing campaign, targeting animation heavyweights and critics leading up to the launch of &quot;World Premiere Toons&quot;. The first poster campaign of its kind introduced the world to the groundbreaking new stable of characters.

=== Broadcast ===
The first cartoon from the &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; project broadcast in its entirety was &quot;The Powerpuff Girls in &quot;Meat Fuzzy Lumkins&quot;&quot;, which made its world premiere on Monday, February 20, 1995, during a television special called the &quot;World Premiere Toon-In&quot; (termed &quot;President&#x27;s Day Nightmare&quot; by its producers, Williams Street). The special was hosted by Space Ghost and the cast of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, and featured comic interviews and a mock contest with the creators of the various cartoons. The Toon-In was simulcast on Cartoon Network, TBS Superstation, and TNT. To promote the shorts, Cartoon Network&#x27;s marketing department came up with the concept of &quot;Dive-In Theater&quot; in 1995 to showcase the 48 cartoon shorts. The cartoons were shown at water parks and large municipal swimming pools, treating kids and their parents to exclusive poolside screenings on 9&#x27; x 12&#x27; movie screens.

Beginning February 26, 1995, each &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; short began to premiere on Sunday nights, promoted as &quot;World Premiere Toons&quot;. Every week after the premiere, Cartoon Network showcased a different World Premiere Toons made by a different artist. After an acclimation of cartoons, the network packaged the shorts as a half-hour show titled &quot;World Premiere Toons: The Next Generation&quot;, featuring reruns of the original shorts but also new premieres.

Eventually, all of the cartoons were compiled into one program which was used the name &quot;World Premiere Toons: The Show&quot; until the summer of 1996 when it started bearing the name of the original project: &quot;The What a Cartoon! Show&quot;. The show&#x27;s initial premieres for each short preceded Cartoon Network&#x27;s Sunday night movie block, &quot;Mr. Spim&#x27;s Cartoon Theatre&quot;. The shorts continued to air on Sundays until 1997, when the network moved the shorts to Wednesdays at 9pm. Following the premiere of &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; and &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot; as full series in July 1997, the series shifted to Thursday nights, where it remained.

&quot;The What a Cartoon! Show&quot; continued airing new episodes on Thursdays until November 28, 1997, when the final short of the 48 contracted during Seibert&#x27;s era aired. In 1998, Cartoon Network debuted two new short pilots and advertised them as &quot;World Premiere Toons&quot;: &quot;Mike, Lu &amp; Og&quot; and &quot;Kenny and the Chimp&quot;, both of which were produced by outside studios and produced after Time Warner&#x27;s acquisition of Turner Broadcasting in 1996. The two pilots were later compiled into &quot;The Cartoon Cartoon Show&quot;, while both shorts eventually garnered their own series, &quot;Mike, Lu &amp; Og&quot; in 1999 and &quot;&quot; in 2002. One pilot entitled &quot;King Crab: Space Crustacean&quot;, which released in 1999, was also retconned into &quot;The Cartoon Cartoon Show&quot; anthology.

On June 9, 2000, &quot;The What a Cartoon! Show&quot; was relaunched as &quot;The Cartoon Cartoon Show&quot;. In this new format, it aired reruns and new episodes of the full-series Cartoon Cartoons, as well as new Cartoon Cartoon shorts and old &quot;WAC!&quot; shorts. From 2000 to 2001, the pilot shorts appearing on the network&#x27;s viewer&#x27;s poll that lost to &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot; and &quot;&quot; (except for &quot;Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?&quot;) were added to the anthology. The show continued to air until October 16, 2003, when it was temporarily dropped from the network&#x27;s schedule.

On September 12, 2005, &quot;The Cartoon Cartoon Show&quot; was revived, this time as a half-hour program featuring segments of older Cartoon Cartoons that were no longer shown regularly on the network, such as &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot;, &quot;I Am Weasel&quot;, and others. Some Cartoon Cartoons were moved exclusively to this show and the Top 5, though there was also some overlap with shows that already had regular half-hour slots outside the series. In 2006, the programming was expanded to also include non-Cartoon Cartoons that &quot;were&quot; regularly shown on the network, such as &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot;, &quot;Camp Lazlo&quot;, &quot;My Gym Partner&#x27;s a Monkey&quot;, and &quot;Squirrel Boy&quot;. The show ended on June 21, 2008.

In 2007, reruns of &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; played briefly on Cartoon Network&#x27;s retro animation sister channel, Boomerang.

In 2020, a selection of shorts were added to the Cartoon Network website and app.

On July 29, 2024, reruns of &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; returned to Cartoon Network, airing only on Monday evenings as part of Adult Swim&#x27;s Checkered Past block.

== Legacy ==
&quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; is the first short cartoon incubator created by Fred Seibert. Starting with &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; and continuing throughout his cartoon career, his Frederator Studios has persisted in the tradition of surfacing new talent, characters, and series with several cartoon shorts &quot;incubators,&quot; including (as of 2016): &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; (Cartoon Network, 1995), Nickelodeon/Nicktoons&#x27; own &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot; (1998), &quot;Nicktoons Film Festival&quot; (2004), &quot;Random! Cartoons&quot; (2008), &quot;The Meth Minute 39&quot; (Channel Frederator, 2008), &quot;The Cartoonstitute&quot; (Cartoon Network, 2009/unfinished), &quot;Too Cool! Cartoons&quot; (Cartoon Hangover, 2012), and &quot;GO! Cartoons&quot; (Cartoon Hangover, 2016). These laboratories have spun off notable series like: &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot;, &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;, &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, &quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot;, &quot;Nite Fite&quot;, &quot;The Mighty B!&quot;, &quot;Fanboy &amp; Chum Chum&quot;, &quot;Adventure Time&quot;, &quot;Regular Show&quot;, &quot;Bravest Warriors&quot;, &quot;Secret Mountain Fort Awesome&quot;, &quot;Gravity Falls&quot;, &quot;Bee and PuppyCat&quot;, and &quot;Uncle Grandpa&quot;.

&quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; was the most popular short series according to a vote held in 1995 and eventually became the first spin-off of &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; in 1996. Two more series based on shorts, &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; and &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot;, premiered in 1997, and &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; became a weekly half-hour show in 1998. &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot; (spun off from the Oscar-nominated short &quot;The Chicken from Outer Space&quot;) followed as the final spin-off in 1999. In addition, the &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot; short &quot;I Am Weasel&quot; eventually was also spun off into a separate series: in all, six cartoon series were ultimately launched by the &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; project, any one of which earned enough money for the company to pay for the whole program. In addition to the eventual spin-offs, the &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; short &quot;Larry and Steve&quot; by Seth MacFarlane featured prototypes of characters that would later go on to become MacFarlane&#x27;s massively successful &quot;Family Guy&quot;.

The &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; project and its assorted spin-offs brought Cartoon Network more commercial and critical success, and the network became an animation industry leader as the 1990s drew to a close. In 2001, coinciding with the death of William Hanna, Hanna-Barbera Productions absorbed into Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network opened its own production arm, Cartoon Network Studios, in Burbank, as the rightful Hanna-Barbera successor to produce original programming for the network and future projects. Two &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; shorts, &quot;Wind-Up Wolf&quot; and &quot;Hard Luck Duck&quot;, were the last cartoon shorts directed and produced by co-founder and co-chairman William Hanna. In addition, &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; and spin-offs were the final original productions released by Hanna-Barbera.

Creator of &quot;The What a Cartoon! Show&quot;, Fred Seibert, left Hanna-Barbera in late 1996 to open up his own studio, Frederator Studios, and has persistently continued in the tradition of surfacing new talent, characters, and series with similar shorts &quot;incubators&quot;, including (as of 2015) &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot; (Nickelodeon, 1998), &quot;Nicktoons Film Festival&quot; (Nickelodeon, 2004), &quot;The Meth Minute 39&quot; (Channel Frederator, 2008), &quot;Random! Cartoons&quot; (Nickelodeon/Nicktoons, 2008), &quot;Too Cool! Cartoons&quot; (Cartoon Hangover, 2012), and &quot;GO! Cartoons&quot; (Cartoon Hangover, 2016). &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot; showcased &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; alumni (Butch Hartman, Rob Renzetti) and launched several successful Nickelodeon series, including &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, &quot;ChalkZone&quot; and &quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot;. Frederator Studios also launched an animation film festival, &quot;Nicktoons Film Festival&quot; from 2004 to 2009; only to have &quot;The Mighty B!&quot; greenlit as a series based on the &quot;Super Scout&quot; short; though one short from Alex Hirsch would later go on to make &quot;Gravity Falls&quot; for Disney Channel/Disney XD. The studio launched another animation showcase in 2006, titled &quot;Random! Cartoons&quot;, which in turn produced Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Fanboy &amp; Chum Chum&quot; in 2009, Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Adventure Time&quot; in 2010, and Cartoon Hangover&#x27;s &quot;Bravest Warriors&quot; in 2012.

A sequel-of-sorts to the &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; project, a Cartoon Network project titled &quot;The Cartoonstitute&quot;, was announced on April 3, 2008. Created by the channel executive Rob Sorcher and headed by &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; creator Craig McCracken and &quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot; creator Rob Renzetti, the project was to &quot;establish a think tank and create an environment in which animators can create characters and stories&quot;, and also create new possible Cartoon Network series. However, the project was eventually scrapped as a result of the late 2000s recession and only 14 of the 39 planned were completed. Nevertheless, J. G. Quintel&#x27;s &quot;Regular Show&quot; short and Peter Browngardt&#x27;s &quot;Secret Mountain Fort Awesome&quot; were greenlit to become full series. A recurring character on the show, Uncle Grandpa, would get his own series two years later. The Big Cartoon DataBase cites &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; as a &quot;venture combining classic 1940s production methods with the originality, enthusiasm and comedy of the 1990s&quot;.

On April 15, 2021, Cartoon Network announced it debuted a new iteration of &quot;Cartoon Cartoons&quot;. The lineup of the first nine shorts were announced on November 24, 2021: &quot;Accordions Geoffery &amp; Mary Melodica&quot; by Louie Zong (of &quot;The Ghost and Molly McGee&quot; and &quot;We Bare Bears&quot;), &quot;Dang! It&#x27;s Dracula&quot; by Levon Jihanian (of &quot;Tig n&#x27; Seek&quot;), &quot;Hungy Ghost&quot; by Jesse Moynihan (of &quot;Adventure Time&quot;), &quot;Fruit Stand at the End of the World&quot; by Rachel Liu, &quot;Off the Menu&quot; by Shavonne Cherry (of &quot;Ren and Stimpy&quot; and &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;), &quot;Harmony in Despair&quot; by Andrew Dickman (of &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot;), &quot;Unravel&quot; by Alexis Sugden, &quot;Mouthwash Madness&quot; by Lisa Vandenberg (of &quot;Animaniacs&quot;), and &quot;Scaredy Cat&quot; by J.J. Villard (of &quot;King Star King&quot;). On June 7, 2022, more Cartoon Cartoons were announced. The next seven shorts include &quot;The All-Nimal&quot; by Nick Edwards (of &quot;Apple &amp; Onion&quot; and &quot;The Fungies!&quot;), &quot;Buttons&#x27; Gamezone&quot; by Fernando Puig (of &quot;The Cuphead Show!, Middlemost Post&quot; and &quot;Tig n&#x27; Seek&quot;), &quot;Tib Tub, We Need You&quot; by Sean Godsey and Mike Rosenthal, &quot;I Love You Jocelyn&quot; by Tracey Laguerre (Art and Animation Director for brands like Google, DreamWorks Animation, BuzzFeed, etc.) , &quot;Pig in a Wig&quot; by Sam Marin (of &quot;Regular Show&quot;), &quot;The Good Boy Report&quot; (based on the webcomic of the same name) by Kasey Williams (of &quot;Niko and the Sword of Light&quot; and &quot;Harley Quinn&quot;) and &quot;Maude Macher and Dom Duck&quot; by Kali Fontecchio (of &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; and &quot;Jellystone!&quot;). On March 21, 2024, GiAnna Ligammari (of &quot;Niko and the Sword of Light&quot; and &quot;Inside Job&quot;) announced a Cartoon Cartoons short &quot;ISCREAM&quot; created by her. Four days after, the short was announced as being completed. The shorts were showcased in a screening on April 25, 2024.

==Filmography==
== List of shorts ==
=== Original show (1995–97) ===
The following is a list of the original shorts produced under Fred Seibert&#x27;s management for &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; by Hanna-Barbera. The shorts are listed in the order that they originally aired.

=== &quot;The Cartoon Cartoon Show&quot; (1998–2002) ===

After &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; ended its run in 1997, Fred Seibert left Hanna-Barbera in 1997 to launch Frederator Studios. In 1998, Sam Register, who was Cartoon Network&#x27;s vice president at the time, took over &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot;, and two years later, turned them into &quot;The Cartoon Cartoon Show&quot;. Register would later create &quot;Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi&quot; for Cartoon Network in 2004. Two Cartoon Cartoon shorts were produced in 1998 and one in 1999. All Cartoon Cartoon shorts produced between 2000 and 2001 were entered in &quot;The Big Pick&quot;, a contest to choose the newest Cartoon Cartoon. The shorts premiered on Cartoon Cartoon Fridays in the weeks leading up to &quot;The Big Pick&quot; and the winner was revealed during the actual event. The winners were &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot;, in 2000, and &quot;&quot;, in 2001.

In 2002, eight new shorts premiered during the Cartoon Cartoon Weekend Summerfest. They did not compete against one another. These were the final Cartoon Cartoon shorts before the brand name was dropped. One short, &quot;LowBrow&quot;, was given its own series under the name &quot;Megas XLR&quot;.

=== Cartoon Cartoon segments ===

From 2000 to 2003, &quot;The Cartoon Cartoon Show&quot; featured new episodes and reruns of the full-series Cartoon Cartoons (which were introduced in 2002 for the primetime hours), interspersed with premieres and reruns of the Cartoon Cartoon pilot shorts (some of which were retconned &quot;WAC!&quot; shorts). From 2005 to 2008, the block was revived, this time dropping the pilot shorts.

Episodes from each show were anthologized into 7 and 11-minute segments. This is a list of shows that were presented on the block:

<text>The University of Gdańsk () is a public research university located in Gdańsk, Poland. It is one of the top 10 universities in Poland and an important centre for the studies of the Kashubian language.

== History ==
The University of Gdańsk was established in 1970 by the merger of the Higher School of Economics in Sopot (founded in 1945) and Gdańsk College of Education (formed in 1946). Nowadays, the University of Gdańsk is the largest institution of higher learning in Poland&#x27;s northern region of Pomerania. The University of Gdańsk boasts significant scientific achievement which enforces its leading position, particularly through activity and research connected with the sea. In this regard, the university has been involved in cooperation with scientific research centres from nearly all corners of the globe.

The University of Gdańsk is involved in the creation of a network of European universities selected in the ‘European Universities’ competition organised by the European Commission in conjunction with its partners, the University of Cádiz (Spain), the University of Split (Croatia), the Université de Bretagne Occidentale (France), Kiel University (Germany) and the University of Malta (Malta), the University of Gdańsk forms a consortium of the European University of the Seas (SEA-EU).

In 2020, the university became a member of the Daniel Fahrenheit Association of Gdańsk Universities (Polish: &quot;Związek Uczelni w Gdańsku im. Daniela Fahrenheita&quot;) which brings together the city&#x27;s major institutions of higher education including the Gdańsk University of Technology and the Medical University of Gdańsk. The objective of the newly established organization is to work on projects aimed at further federalization of the universities, to bolster the scientific cooperation among them and to pursue a common promotional and ranking policy.

== Ranking ==

<doc id="1048332" wikidata="Q105131" url="?curid=1048332" title="Hotspot (geology)">
<text>In geology, hotspots (or hot spots) are volcanic locales thought to be fed by underlying mantle that is anomalously hot compared with the surrounding mantle. Examples include the Hawaii, Iceland, and Yellowstone hotspots. A hotspot&#x27;s position on the Earth&#x27;s surface is independent of tectonic plate boundaries, and so hotspots may create a chain of volcanoes as the plates move above them.

There are two hypotheses that attempt to explain their origins. One suggests that hotspots are due to mantle plumes that rise as thermal diapirs from the core–mantle boundary. The alternative plate theory is that the mantle source beneath a hotspot is not anomalously hot, rather the crust above is unusually weak or thin, so that lithospheric extension permits the passive rising of melt from shallow depths.

==Origin==

The origins of the concept of hotspots lie in the work of J. Tuzo Wilson, who postulated in 1963 that the formation of the Hawaiian Islands resulted from the slow movement of a tectonic plate across a hot region beneath the surface. It was later postulated that hotspots are fed by streams of hot mantle rising from the Earth&#x27;s core–mantle boundary in a structure called a mantle plume. Whether or not such mantle plumes exist has been the subject of a major controversy in Earth science, but seismic images consistent with evolving theory now exist.

At any place where volcanism is not linked to a constructive or destructive plate margin, the concept of a hotspot has been used to explain its origin. A review article by Courtillot et al. listing possible hotspots makes a distinction between primary hotspots coming from deep within the mantle and secondary hotspots derived from mantle plumes. The primary hotspots originate from the core/mantle boundary and create large volcanic provinces with linear tracks (Easter Island, Iceland, Hawaii, Afar, Louisville, Reunion, and Tristan confirmed; Galapagos, Kerguelen and Marquersas likely). The secondary hotspots originate at the upper/lower mantle boundary, and do not form large volcanic provinces, but island chains (Samoa, Tahiti, Cook, Pitcairn, Caroline, MacDonald confirmed, with up to 20 or so more possible). Other potential hotspots are the result of shallow mantle material surfacing in areas of lithospheric break-up caused by tension and are thus a very different type of volcanism.
Estimates for the number of hotspots postulated to be fed by mantle plumes have ranged from about 20 to several thousand, with most geologists considering a few tens to exist. Hawaii, Réunion, Yellowstone, Galápagos, and Iceland are some of the most active volcanic regions to which the hypothesis is applied. The plumes imaged to date vary widely in width and other characteristics, and are tilted, being not the simple, relatively narrow and purely thermal plumes many expected. Only one, (Yellowstone) has as yet been consistently modelled and imaged from deep mantle to surface.

==Composition==
Most hotspot volcanoes are basaltic (e.g., Hawaii, Tahiti). As a result, they are less explosive than subduction zone volcanoes, in which water is trapped under the overriding plate. Where hotspots occur in continental regions, basaltic magma rises through the continental crust, which melts to form rhyolites. These rhyolites can form violent eruptions. For example, the Yellowstone Caldera was formed by some of the most powerful volcanic explosions in geologic history. However, when the rhyolite is completely erupted, it may be followed by eruptions of basaltic magma rising through the same lithospheric fissures (cracks in the lithosphere). An example of this activity is the Ilgachuz Range in British Columbia, which was created by an early complex series of trachyte and rhyolite eruptions, and late extrusion of a sequence of basaltic lava flows.

The hotspot hypothesis is now closely linked to the mantle plume hypothesis. The detailed compositional studies now possible on hotspot basalts have allowed linkage of samples over the wider areas often implicate in the later hypothesis, and it&#x27;s seismic imaging developments. 

== Contrast with subduction zone island arcs ==
Hotspot volcanoes are considered to have a fundamentally different origin from island arc volcanoes. The latter form over subduction zones, at converging plate boundaries. When one oceanic plate meets another, the denser plate is forced downward into a deep ocean trench. This plate, as it is subducted, releases water into the base of the over-riding plate, and this water mixes with the rock, thus changing its composition causing some rock to melt and rise. It is this that fuels a chain of volcanoes, such as the Aleutian Islands, near Alaska.

==Hotspot volcanic chains==




The joint mantle plume/hotspot hypothesis originally envisaged the feeder structures to be fixed relative to one another, with the continents and seafloor drifting overhead. The hypothesis thus predicts that time-progressive chains of volcanoes are developed on the surface. Examples are Yellowstone, which lies at the end of a chain of extinct calderas, which become progressively older to the west. Another example is the Hawaiian archipelago, where islands become progressively older and more deeply eroded to the northwest.

Geologists have tried to use hotspot volcanic chains to track the movement of the Earth&#x27;s tectonic plates. This effort has been vexed by the lack of very long chains, by the fact that many are not time-progressive (e.g. the Galápagos) and by the fact that hotspots do not appear to be fixed relative to one another (e.g. Hawaii and Iceland). That mantle plumes are much more complex than originally hypothesised and move independently of each other and plates is now used to explain such observations. 

In 2020, Wei et al. used seismic tomography to detect the oceanic plateau, formed about 100 million years ago by the hypothesized mantle plume head of the Hawaii-Emperor seamount chain, now subducted to a depth of 800 km under eastern Siberia.

<doc id="1048336" wikidata="Q1258332" url="?curid=1048336" title="Dremel">
<text>Dremel ( ) is a multinational brand of power tools, focusing on home improvement and hobby applications. Dremel is known primarily for its rotary tools, such as the Dremel 3000, 4000 and 8200 series, which are similar to the pneumatic die grinders used in the metalworking industry by tool or moldmakers. Dremel later expanded its product range and now produces butane tools, benchtop and hand-held saws and oscillating tools. The company was purchased by Robert Bosch GmbH in 1993, and is now a division of the Robert Bosch Tool Corporation.

== History ==
Dremel die grinder tools were originally developed by Albert J. Dremel, an Austrian inventor, who founded the Dremel Company in Racine, Wisconsin in 1932. Dremel held 55 patents across a wide range of inventions. His first product, released within the company, was an electric razor-blade sharpener, which lost popularity when cheap disposable razors became readily available. Dremel then developed the high-speed lightweight rotary tool, later named the Dremel Multitool, for which the company continues to be known. That invention was successful in the hobby and craft market.

In 1948, Dremel gave his employees a 3% year-end share of profits, seen as a radical idea at the time. Dremel died on 18 July 1968 at the age of 81.

People found many ways to use the rotary tools. In the 1940s, the United States Department of Defense reportedly used Dremel rotary tools in developing the first atomic bomb. Doctors in the military used the tools in dermal abrasion, to reduce scar tissue from battle wounds. Dremel tools are also used in tattooing, by pedorthists for shaping shoe inserts, and by dentists for crafting dentures.

In 2013, Dremel claimed that there were more than 17 million of their rotary tools in use.

=== Timeline ===
* 1932 – Albert J. Dremel founded the Dremel company. It was eventually awarded 55 patents, including for electric erasers, pusher lawn mowers and razor blade sharpeners.
* 1935 – Introduction of first hand-held high-speed rotary tool, called the Moto-Tool.
* 1939 – The Dremel Moto-Saw was developed.
* 1964 – Introduction of the Dremel electric engraver.
* 1973 – Introduction of compact table saw and multi-use disc/belt sander. Dremel Manufacturing Company was acquired by Emerson Electric
* 1993 – The Dremel brand purchased by Robert Bosch Tool Corporation.
* 2003 – Dremel introduces the lithium-ion battery for power tools. New tool creation of the Dremel 10.8 Volt lithium-ion.

==Operations==
Dremel&#x27;s US activities operate from Mt. Prospect, Illinois. Dremel&#x27;s activities in Europe, the Middle East and Africa are operated by Dremel Europe, with its headquarters located in Breda, Netherlands.

== Rotary tools ==

The company currently produces six rotary tools: three corded and three cordless. Over its history, Dremel has created over 30 different designs and models, mainly for home improvement and hobby use. Many different accessories and attachments are available. 

The concept of the original Dremel Moto-Tool was to rotate a bit held in a collet at high speed. Variable-speed versions cover a range of 3,000 to 37,000 rpm. The Dremel relies on high speed, rather than the high torque of a conventional power drill. By inserting the appropriate bit (or burr), the tool can perform drilling, grinding, sharpening, cutting, cleaning, polishing, sanding, routing, carving, and engraving. Early cordless models were marketed as the Dremel Freewheeler. Dremel options include a miniature planer attachment, and a jigsaw attachment that lets the tool act much like a small reciprocating saw. Other Dremel rotary tools include a cordless pumpkin carving tool, a cordless pet nail grooming tool, and a cordless golf cleaning tool.

The collets are flexible, and will accept both original Dremel and alternative makes of cutting, grinding, and polishing head shafts.

== Other tools ==
Dremel produces hot glue guns, scroll saws, butane tools, contour sanders, versatips, and powered screwdrivers, as well as accessories and attachments. Dremel tools are categorised as compact tool systems and benchtop tool systems.

In late 2008, Dremel released an oscillating tool, after the patent for the Fein Multimaster had run out. Dremel&#x27;s version of the tool is called the &quot;Multi-Max&quot;.

3Pi Tech Solutions sell 3D printers with the Dremel brand.

<text>Compton is a village and civil parish in the River Pang valley in the Berkshire Downs about south of Didcot.

==Geography==
Compton is buffered from neighbouring settlements by cultivated fields to all sides. The village is in a gently-sloped dry valley and the fledgling Pang seasonally enters from the north west and discharges in the south east and may be joined at the centre of the village by the Roden from the north, when winter bournes rise to fill their channels. Elevations vary from AOD. Compton has a site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) just to the south west of the village, called Ashridge Wood.

==Parish church==
The bell tower of the Church of England parish church of Saint Mary and Saint Nicholas was built in the 13th century and has Perpendicular Gothic features that were added in the 15th century. In 1850 the nave and chancel were modernised or rebuilt and in 1905 the Gothic Revival architect John Oldrid Scott added the north aisle.

==Transport==
===Former railway===
In 1882 the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway was completed through the parish and Compton railway station was opened. British Railways withdrew passenger services from the line and closed Compton station in 1962. BR had closed Compton goods yard by 1964. Through freight traffic was withdrawn in 1964 and the line was closed and dismantled during 1967.

===Bus service===
From 18 February 2013, Compton is served by Newbury and District bus services 6 and 6A from Newbury.

==Amenities and economy==

==Education==
The academically successful The Downs School local authority secondary school is in Compton. In the 21st century its new science building was named The Hubble after American astro-physicist Edwin Hubble. Compton Church of England Primary School is located on School Road. The school emblem is a stag. 

One section of the Institute for Animal Health, now the Pirbright Institute was at Compton, along with the Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research. 

===Industry===
Despite Compton being a small village, in 2006 it became the founding place of a chemical manufacturing company called Carbosynth. Since 2019, it has merged with Swiss company Biosynth AG within the fine chemical industry and now operates under the name Biosynth®.

==Demography==
==Nearest places==
==In popular culture==
Substantial portions of the BBC Television series &quot;Trainer&quot; were filmed in and around Compton and the next nearest village, East Ilsley.

==Notable people==
Footballer Theo Walcott went to Compton Primary School and The Downs School. Theo held the 100m record at The Downs School between 2004 and 2011.
