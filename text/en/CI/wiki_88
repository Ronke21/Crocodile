<text>Marvel Studios, LLC, formerly known as Marvel Films, is an American film and television production company. Marvel Studios is the creator of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), a media franchise and shared universe of films and television series produced by the studio, based on characters that appear in Marvel Comics publications. The studio was founded in 1993 by Avi Arad as part of Marvel Entertainment Group and has been led by producer Kevin Feige, who serves as its president since 2007. The studio originally licensed the film rights to several Marvel characters before beginning to produce its own films in 2004, and has since regained many of those rights. In 2009, the Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Studios&#x27; parent company Marvel Entertainment, and in 2015, they transferred Marvel Studios to the Walt Disney Studios, which has been a part of the Disney Entertainment division since 2023. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures has distributed most of the studio&#x27;s films since &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012).

Since 2008, Marvel Studios has released 35 films within the MCU, from &quot;Iron Man&quot; (2008) to &quot;Captain America: Brave New World&quot; (2025); 12 television series since 2021, from &quot;WandaVision&quot; (2021) to &quot;Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man&quot; (2025–present); and two television specials: &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot; (2022) and &quot;The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special&quot; (2022). The television series &quot;What If...?&quot; (2021–2024) is the first animated property produced solely by the studio, through its &quot;mini-studio&quot; Marvel Studios Animation. These films, television series, and television specials all share continuity with each other, along with five short films called Marvel One-Shots produced by the studio that were released from 2011 to 2014. From 2013 until 2020, Marvel Television released 12 television series, which also acknowledge the MCU continuity. These were produced before that company was folded into Marvel Studios in December 2019 and became a production label.

Eleven of Marvel Studios&#x27; films are among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time. These include: &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; (2013), &quot;&quot; (2015), &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016), &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2018), &quot;&quot; (2018), &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; (2019), &quot;&quot; (2019), &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; (2019), &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021), and &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; (2024); &quot;Avengers: Endgame&quot; was the highest-grossing film of all time from July 2019 until March 2021. In addition to the MCU, Marvel Studios has also been involved with the production of other Marvel-based film franchises that have grossed over $1 billion at the box office, including the &quot;X-Men&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man&quot; multi-film franchises, as well as eight direct-to-video short films with Marvel Animation called &quot;Marvel Animated Features&quot; that were released from 2006 until 2011. Since 2024, Marvel Studios has used &quot;Marvel Television&quot; and &quot;Marvel Animation&quot; banners to release its television and animated projects, respectively.
== Background ==
During what is known as Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Timely era&quot;, Captain America was licensed out to Republic Pictures for a 1944 serial film only for the free advertising. Timely failed to provide any drawing of Captain America with his shield or any further background, and Republic created a whole new background for the character and portrayed the character using a gun. From the late 1970s through the early 1990s, Marvel Comics Group and Marvel Entertainment Group (MEG) sold options to studios to produce films based on Marvel Comics characters. One of Marvel&#x27;s superheroes, Spider-Man, was optioned in the late 1970s, and rights reverted to Marvel without a film having been produced within the allocated time frame. From 1986 to 1996, most of Marvel&#x27;s major characters were optioned, including the Fantastic Four, X-Men, Daredevil, the Hulk, Silver Surfer, and Iron Man. Marvel&#x27;s first big-screen adaptation of one of its properties was the 1986 film &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;, which was a box-office bomb. MEG was purchased by New World Entertainment in November 1986 and moved to produce films based on the Marvel characters. It released &quot;The Punisher&quot; (1989) before MEG was sold to Ronald Perelman&#x27;s Andrews Group. Two other films were produced: &quot;Captain America&quot; (1990) released in the United Kingdom on screens and direct to video in the United States, and &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; (1994), not intended for release.

== History ==
=== Marvel Films (1993–1996) ===
After MEG acquired ToyBiz in 1993, Avi Arad of ToyBiz was named president and chief executive officer (CEO) of both the Marvel Films division and New World Family Filmworks, a New World Entertainment subsidiary. New World was MEG&#x27;s former parent corporation and later a fellow subsidiary of the Andrews Group. Marvel Productions became New World Animation by 1993 as Marvel would start up Marvel Films, including . Marvel Films Animation shared Tom Tataranowicz with New World Animation as head of development and production. New World Animation (&quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;), Saban (&quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot;) and Marvel Films Animation (&quot;Spider-Man&quot;) each produced a Marvel series for television for the 1996–1997 season. By the end of 1993, Arad and 20th Century Fox struck a deal to make a film based on the X-Men. In August 1996, New World Animation and Marvel Films Animation were sold along with the rest of New World by the Andrews Group to News Corporation and the Fox Entertainment Group. As part of the deal, Marvel licensed the rights to Captain America, Daredevil, and Silver Surfer to be on the Fox Kids Network and produced by Saban. New World Animation continued producing a second season of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; for UPN.

=== Formation of Marvel Studios and licensing films (1996–2004) ===

On August 7, 1996, Marvel Studios was created by Marvel. Filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise money to finance the new corporation, Marvel, Isaac Perlmutter&#x27;s Zib, Inc. and Avi Arad sold ToyBiz stocks. ToyBiz filed an offering of 7.5 million shares with a closing price of $20.125 at the time, making the offering worth approximately $150 million. ToyBiz sought to sell 1 million shares. Jerry Calabrese, the president of Marvel Entertainment Group, and Avi Arad, head of Marvel Films and a director of ToyBiz, were assigned tandem control of Marvel Studios. Under Calabrese and Arad, Marvel sought to control pre-production by commissioning scripts, hiring directors, and casting characters, providing the package to a major studio partner for filming and distribution. Arad said of the goal for control, &quot;When you get into business with a big studio, they are developing a hundred or 500 projects; you get totally lost. That isn&#x27;t working for us. We&#x27;re just not going to do it anymore. Period.&quot; Marvel Studios arranged a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox to cover markets in the United States and internationally.

In December 1996, Marvel Entertainment Group underwent a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization plan, including Marvel Studios as part of its strategic investment. By 1997, Marvel Studios was actively pursuing various film productions based on Marvel characters, including the eventual films &quot;X-Men&quot; (2000), &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2003), &quot;Elektra&quot; (2005), and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (2005). Unproduced projects included &quot;Prince Namor&quot;, based on the character Namor and to be directed by Philip Kaufman, and &quot;Mort the Dead Teenager&quot;, based on the comic book of the same name and written by John Payson and &quot;Mort&quot; creator Larry Hama. Marvel&#x27;s Captain America animated series with Saban Entertainment for Fox Kids Network was set to premiere in late 1998. However, due to the bankruptcy, the series was canceled after only character designs and a one-minute promotional reel were made.

The first film packaged and licensed by Marvel Studios was &quot;Blade&quot; (1998), based on the vampire hunter Blade. The film was directed by Stephen Norrington and starred Wesley Snipes as Blade. It was released on August 21, 1998, grossing $70,087,718 in the United States and Canada and $131,183,530 worldwide. &quot;Blade&quot; was followed by &quot;X-Men&quot;, which was directed by Bryan Singer and was released on July 14, 2000. &quot;X-Men&quot; grossed $157,299,717 in the United States and Canada and $296,250,053 worldwide. &quot;Blade&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot; demonstrated that widely popular films could be made out of comic book characters not familiar to the general public. Leading up to &quot;X-Men&quot; release, Marvel Studios negotiated a deal with then-functional Artisan Entertainment, successful with the low-budget &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, for a co-production joint venture that included rights to 15 Marvel characters including Captain America, Thor (as a television series), Black Panther (with Snipes attached to produce and star), Deadpool, Iron Fist, Morbius, the Living Vampire, Longshot, Power Pack, &quot;Mort the Dead Teenager&quot;, Ant-Man, and the Punisher. Artisan would finance and distribute while Marvel would develop licensing and merchandising tie-ins. The resulting production library, which would also include television series, direct-to-video films, and internet projects, would be co-owned. By 2001, the success of Marvel Entertainment&#x27;s Ultimate Marvel imprint comics created leverage in Hollywood for Marvel Studios, pushing more properties into development.
The next film licensed from Marvel Studios was &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002) by Columbia Pictures, directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man. The film was released on May 3, 2002, grossing $403,706,375 in the United States and Canada and $821,708,551 worldwide. The early success of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; led the film&#x27;s studio to issue a seven-figure advance for a sequel. Arad spoke of the deal, &quot;Movies make sequels. Therefore, it&#x27;s a big economic luxury to know that a movie&#x27;s going to get a second and third. This is a business of precedence.&quot; According to a Lehman Brothers analysis, Marvel Studios made only $62 million for the first two &quot;Spider-Man&quot; films. Marvel was making more from half the consumer product licensing fees while making relatively little from the films, but it was enough for Marvel to regain its financial footing. In October 2002, Marvel Studios announced deals for the Sub-Mariner and Prime with Universal Pictures.

In contrast to the original storylines of DC Comics&#x27; Superman and Batman films, Marvel films often emphasized more fidelity to its comics, applying set pieces, scenes, plots, and dialogue drawn from them. In 2003, David Maisel approached Arad about earning Marvel more for its films. Maisel, Arad, and Perlmutter met, leading to Maisel being hired as president and chief operating officer (COO). The studio&#x27;s office was small on Santa Monica Boulevard, with around a dozen staff members. Kevin Feige, who later became the president of Marvel Studios, was then a junior executive generating script notes for the licensed studios. In January 2003, Marvel, the Sci-Fi Channel, and Reveille Productions agreed to develop two pilot films based on &quot;Brother Voodoo&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In December 2003, Lionsgate purchased Artisan Entertainment and they decided to let all of the character rights Artisan held, except Punisher, revert to Marvel. Marvel Studios partnered with Lionsgate in 2004 to produce eight animated films, called &quot;Marvel Animated Features&quot;, for the direct-to-DVD market with Lionsgate Home Entertainment handling distribution. The line was a proof of concept for Maisel&#x27;s later plan. Eric Rollman was hired by Marvel as Executive Vice President of home entertainment &amp; TV production for Marvel Studios to oversee the deal with Lionsgate.

=== Transition to film production (2004–2009) ===
Maisel was hired in 2004 as president and chief operating officer of Marvel Studios as he had a plan for the studio to self-finance its films. Marvel entered into a non-recourse debt structure with Merrill Lynch that was collateralized by certain film rights to a total of ten characters from Marvel&#x27;s vast vault. Marvel received $525 million to make a maximum of ten films based on the company&#x27;s properties over eight years, according to the parameters of the original deal. Those characters were Ant-Man, the Avengers, Black Panther, Captain America, Cloak &amp; Dagger, Doctor Strange, Hawkeye, Nick Fury, Power Pack, and Shang-Chi. Ambac insured the films would succeed or they would pay the interest payment on the debt and get the film rights as collateral. Initially, Marvel Studios was in talks with Universal Pictures as a possible distributor, because Universal owned the film rights to both the Hulk and Namor during that time. Negotiations dragged on, so the studio began talks with Paramount Pictures. In the second quarter of 2005, Merrill attempted to back out of full financing of each film, demanding that Marvel finance one-third of the budget. Marvel took back rights in five foreign territories from Paramount for pre-sell to meet that demand. In September 2005, Marvel announced the Merrill Lynch financing deal with Paramount was on as marketer and distributor. Marvel Studios&#x27; parent company Marvel Enterprises, Inc. then changed its name to Marvel Entertainment, Inc. to reflect the change to self-production.
The studio moved to a new location over a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Beverly Hills, California. Maisel was also named vice-chairman of the studio, but reported to Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter. In November 2005, Michael Helfant joined the studio as president and chief operating officer. Also that month, Marvel gained the film rights to Iron Man from New Line Cinema. Marvel then revealed that it had regained the film rights to the Hulk from Universal in February 2006, in exchange for letting Universal own the distribution rights to &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (2008) and the right of first refusal to pick up the distribution rights to any future Marvel Studios-produced &quot;Hulk&quot; films. In April 2006, Thor was announced to be a Marvel Studios production, while Lions Gate Entertainment subsequently dropped the Black Widow film it had in development since 2004 and returned the rights to Marvel.

Maisel and Arad fought over the rate of film releases and the strength of characters in the film lineup. Perlmutter supported Maisel and thus, in May 2006, Arad quit as studio chair and CEO. In March 2007, Helfant was &quot;forced out&quot; of the studio while Maisel was named chairman and Kevin Feige was named president of production to replace Helfant as &quot;Iron Man&quot; (2008) began filming. In January 2008, Marvel Animation was incorporated to direct Marvel&#x27;s efforts in animation and home entertainment markets including then animation efforts with Lionsgate and Nickelodeon. In March, the company agreed to a five-picture basic cable distribution with FX for the films &quot;Iron Man&quot; and &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, with additional films to be named later. Following the successful opening weekend of &quot;Iron Man&quot; in May 2008, Maisel had his contract extended through 2010 and Feige was promoted to president of Marvel Studios. In November, Marvel Studios signed a lease with Raleigh Studios to host its headquarters and production offices and film the next four films on the studios&#x27; slate, including &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; (2010) and &quot;Thor&quot; (2011), at its Manhattan Beach Studios Media Campus facilities. By September 2008, Paramount added five additional Marvel films&#x27; foreign distribution to its domestic film distribution contract.

In 2009, producer Stephen Broussard was tasked with forming a writers program for the studio. The writers were hired for a year to be on call to do emergency script polishes for films in production, as well as develop scripts based on some lesser-known properties, such as Black Panther, Cable, Iron Fist, Nighthawk, and Vision. Writers included: Edward Ricourt, who was encouraged to write a script for Luke Cage as it was of high interest to the studio; Nicole Perlman, who chose to write a script based on the 2008 Guardians of the Galaxy team; Christopher Yost, who was asked to pitch a Black Panther film for his interview, and took interest in writing scripts about the Thunderbolts, Power Pack, and Brian Braddock / Captain Britain; Joe Robert Cole, who initially pitched a War Machine film before joining the writers program where he created scripts for the Inhumans; and Eric Pearson, who was asked to pitch a Cloak and Dagger film and also worked to rewrite a Luke Cage script. After Broussard moved on to the production of &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; (2011), Marvel Studios hired Nate Moore to oversee the writers program, who at times was assisted by the also newly hired executive Jodi Hildebrand. Particular properties Feige was interested in having screenplays for were Black Panther, Iron Fist, and Blade. The program was shut down in 2014 before being revived in 2016. In early 2009, Sony returned all Spider-Man television rights (including live-action) in exchange for an adjustment to the film rights.

=== Disney conglomerate subsidiary (since 2009) ===
==== Acquisition by Disney and immediate changes (2009–2015) ====
On August 31, 2009, the Walt Disney Company announced that it had reached a deal to acquire Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion. The deal was completed on December 31, with Marvel Entertainment becoming a subsidiary of Disney. Both Marvel and Disney stated that the merger would not affect any pre-existing deals with other film studios for the time being, although Disney said they would distribute future Marvel projects with its own studio once the deals expired. Maisel stepped down from the studio following the sale to Disney. In April 2010, rumors circulated that Marvel was looking to create $20–40 million films based on properties such as Doctor Strange, Ka-Zar, Luke Cage, Dazzler, and Power Pack. Feige responded by saying, while budgets are generally never discussed early in development, Marvel was considering films for all characters mentioned in the rumor, except Dazzler, whose rights were at Fox.
In June 2010, Marvel Entertainment set up a television division within Marvel Studios called Marvel Television to be headed up by Jeph Loeb as Executive Vice President, under which Marvel Animation would be operated. In October, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures acquired the distribution rights for &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012) and &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; (2013) from Paramount Pictures with Paramount&#x27;s logo and credit remaining on those films. In August 2011, at Disney&#x27;s behest, the studio dismissed most of its marketing department, including EVP of Worldwide Marketing Dana Precious, VP of Worldwide Marketing Jeffrey Stewart, and Manager of Worldwide Marketing Jodi Miller. Disney subsequently began marketing Marvel&#x27;s films. In April 2012, the Walt Disney Company China, Marvel Studios, and DMG Entertainment announced an agreement to co-produce &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; in China. DMG partly financed, produced in China with Marvel, and handled co-production matters. DMG also distributed the film in China in tandem with Disney.

In April 2013, Marvel Studios moved its executive production offices from the Manhattan Beach Studios Media Campus to the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. In July 2013, Disney purchased the distribution rights to &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;, &quot;Thor&quot;, and &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; from Paramount. In September 2014, TNT acquired the cable rights for &quot;&quot; (2015), &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016), and three other films, to air on the network two years after their theatrical releases. The films had previously aired on FX since 2008.

==== Walt Disney Studios subsidiary and expansion to television and animation (since 2015) ====
In August 2015, Marvel Studios was placed into Walt Disney Studios, with Feige reporting directly to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F. Horn instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter. Marvel Television and subsidiary Marvel Animation were left under Marvel Entertainment and Perlmutter&#x27;s control. As of April 2017, Marvel Studios was housed on the second floor of the Frank G. Wells Building at the Disney studio lot. &quot;Fast Company&quot; ranked Marvel Studios number eleven on its 2018 World&#x27;s Most Innovative Companies list.

In September 2018, it was reported that Marvel Studios was developing several limited series for the streaming service Disney+, to be centered on &quot;second tier&quot; characters from the MCU films who had not and were unlikely to star in their own films. Characters being considered for series included Loki and Scarlet Witch, with the actors who portrayed the characters in the films expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. Each series was expected to be six to eight episodes, with a &quot;hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production&quot;. The series would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, with Feige taking a &quot;hands-on role&quot; in each series&#x27; development. In October 2019, Feige was given the title of Chief Creative Officer, Marvel, and would oversee the creative direction of Marvel Television and Marvel Family Entertainment, with both being returned to being under the Marvel Studios banner. Two months later, Marvel Television was folded into Marvel Studios, with Marvel Studios overseeing development of all the Marvel Television series in production at the time of its closing. Karim Zreik, Marvel Television&#x27;s senior vice president of current programming and production, would join Marvel Studios alongside his team to oversee the production of the Marvel Television series inherited by Marvel Studios.

In May 2022, Marvel Studios signed a 20-year licensing deal with Stan Lee Universe to license the name and likeness of Lee for use in future films, television series, Disney theme parks and cruises, various &quot;experiences&quot;, and merchandising. A digitally recreated Lee was not expected to make cameo appearances in future projects, rather the deal allows Marvel to use Lee&#x27;s name, voice, likeness, signature, and existing images and archival material. In June 2023, the distribution rights to &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; reverted from Universal back to Marvel and Disney.
By October 2023, Marvel Studios was planning to hire dedicated executives to focus on its television efforts, as part of a larger plan to change its approach to its television series. Production and development executive Richie Palmer was serving as a television executive by January 2024. In May 2024, Marvel Studios revealed that its live-action Disney+ series would be released under a new &quot;&quot; banner, separate from the previous company of the same name, starting with &quot;Agatha All Along&quot; later in 2024.

===== Marvel Studios Animation =====

In June 2021, ahead of Marvel Studios&#x27; first solely produced animated series &quot;What If...?&quot;, executive vice president of film production Victoria Alonso noted that the studio was creating an &quot;animation branch and mini-studio&quot; to focus on more animated content beyond &quot;What If...?&quot;. Marvel Studios outsources the animation for its animated series to third-party animation studios, though executive Brad Winderbaum indicated Marvel would work with fellow Disney studios Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios &quot;under the right circumstances&quot;. In September 2021, Alonso was promoted to President of Physical, Post Production, VFX and Animation. In November 2021, Marvel Studios announced the animated series &quot;X-Men &#x27;97&quot; (2024–present), a revival of &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot; (1992–1997) that is set in that series&#x27; continuity. The animation branch of Marvel Studios and &quot;mini-studio&quot; is known as Marvel Studios Animation. By April 2022, Marvel Studios had taken over production of the preschool animated series &quot;Spidey and His Amazing Friends&quot;, starting from its second season; the first season was produced under the Marvel Entertainment banner. The &quot;Marvel Animation&quot; name and banner was used for the division&#x27;s projects by May 2024.

===== Firing of Victoria Alonso and relationship with VFX workers =====

In March 2023, Alonso was fired from her role at Marvel Studios by a group including Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman and Disney&#x27;s human resources and legal departments for serving as a producer on the Amazon Studios film &quot;Argentina, 1985&quot; (2022); this was a breach of a 2018 agreement between Alonso and Disney which stated employees would not work for a competing studio. Alonso reportedly did not seek permission to work on the film, and was asked by Disney to stop working on the film, as well as not to promote or publicize it, with the situation &quot;deemed serious enough&quot; that Disney requested a new agreement be signed. Despite this, Alonso continued to promote the film following its September 2022 premiere, and was consistently reminded of her agreement and breach of contract, ultimately leading to her firing. Alonso&#x27;s lawyers refuted this claim, stating Disney was aware of, and agreed to, Alonso&#x27;s work on &quot;Argentina, 1985&quot;, and that she was instead &quot;silenced[... and] was terminated when she refused to do something she believed was reprehensible&quot;; this incident was reported to be a disagreement with a Disney executive over the censoring of gay pride elements in &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot; (2023) to release the film in Kuwait and comply with its restrictive anti-LGBTQ laws. A Disney spokesperson reiterated the notion that she was fired due to &quot;an indisputable breach of contract and a direct violation of company policy&quot; among other &quot;key factors&quot;. Disney and Alonso reached a multimillion-dollar compensation settlement in April.

Also at the time of Alonso&#x27;s firing, criticism from VFX workers was noted, who had raised complaints of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;demanding post-production schedules&quot;. Alonso was described by some as a &quot;kingmaker&quot;, and &quot;challenging to work with&quot;, with Chris Lee at &quot;Vulture&quot; reporting that Alonso was &quot;singularly responsible for Marvel&#x27;s toxic work environment&quot; with VFX workers. Alonso reportedly took days off to produce &quot;Argentina, 1985&quot; instead of her post-production commitments for the various MCU projects, which in turn resulted in the need to delay several projects in 2022 and 2023. However, Alonso was also described as the &quot;epitome of professional&quot; and supportive on set, with Joanna Robinson of &quot;The Ringer&quot; describing the reports as a &quot;gross mischaracterization&quot; and the opposite of Alonso&#x27;s work. Following Alonso&#x27;s firing, visual effects vendors for the various MCU projects were working with producer Jen Underdahl, the vice president of visual effects and stereo.

In August 2023, a group of 52 on-set VFX workers at Marvel Studios filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board for an election to join the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) labor union the VFX Union. This was the first time any workers in the visual effects industry had petitioned for union recognition. Lee believed if this group of workers were able to secure union recognition, it &quot;would stand as proof of concept for the overall viability of an industry-wide unionization push&quot;, particularly at the post-production effect houses. All of the workers who participated in the election vote that concluded in early September voted unanimously to form a union with IATSE, with the union then set to enter into collective bargaining negotiations with Marvel, beginning at an unspecified date.

== Character rights ==
Marvel had licensed out the film rights to many of its characters to other studios in the 1990s, starting with the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, and Daredevil, which were followed by Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Black Widow, Luke Cage, the Punisher, Blade, Ghost Rider, Man-Thing, Black Panther, Deadpool, and Prime, among others.

In February 2015, Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures Entertainment announced that Spider-Man would appear in the MCU, with the character appearing in &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016) and Sony releasing &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot;, produced by Feige and Amy Pascal, in July 2017. As part of the deal, Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, own and have final creative control of the Spider-Man films. In June 2015, Feige clarified that the initial Sony deal did not allow Spider-Man to appear in any of the MCU television series, as it was &quot;very specific... with a certain amount of back and forth allowed.&quot; In September 2019, it was announced that Disney and Sony had reached a new agreement allowing for Spider-Man to appear in a third standalone film (produced by Marvel Studios and Feige) and a future Marvel Studios film. Disney was reported to be co-financing 25% of the film in exchange for 25% of the film&#x27;s profits in the new agreement, while retaining the merchandising rights to the character. In November 2021, Pascal announced plans for a fourth &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film set in the MCU, in addition to long-term plans for a new trilogy of films with Marvel Studios, with said film entering active development the following month. Sony&#x27;s agreement specifies that production has to start on a film within three years and nine months of the previous one, and release within five years and nine months, otherwise the rights revert to Marvel. Sony has access to 856 characters within its agreement, including Kingpin, who is able to be used by both Sony and Marvel Studios.

In March 2023, Citigroup financial analyst Jason Bazinet felt Disney may try to include the distribution rights to the Hulk and Namor in any potential sale of the streaming service Hulu to Comcast, the owner of Universal Pictures through NBCUniversal. In June 2023, the distribution rights to &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; reverted from Universal back to Marvel and Disney.

The following table details the rights that have returned to Marvel along with the studios from which they returned and the year in which they returned.

== Logo ==
=== Films and television series designs ===

Starting with the release of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; in 2002, Marvel Studios introduced its &quot;flipbook&quot; production logo, created by Imaginary Forces. This logo was accompanied by music from the film&#x27;s score, sound effects or a song, to lead into the beginning of the film. This was the logo seen in front of all of the studio&#x27;s films until 2013, when the logo was updated with the release of &quot;&quot;, again created by Imaginary Forces. Feige stated that since Marvel was now its own entity within the Walt Disney Company, it &quot;felt like the time to update it and have something that is more substantial as a standalone logo in front of our features&quot; instead of having it be accompanied by Marvel&#x27;s studio or distribution partners&#x27; logos. Feige added that they &quot;didn&#x27;t want to re-invent the wheel [with the new logo], but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, which is why it starts with the flip, but suddenly it&#x27;s more dimensional as we go through the lettering and it reveals itself with the metallic sheen before settling into the white-on-red, well known Marvel logo, with the added flourish of the arrival and the announcement of the Studios at the bottom of the word Marvel.&quot; Imaginary Forces used the same animation technique on the updated logo, as they did when they created the first version in 2002. They were given a few hundred comic books to select images from, and ultimately chose 120 that were &quot;universal and not specific to one character&quot; and created a narrative &quot;where each image spoke to the one before it and after.&quot; The new logo appeared on all subsequent studio productions set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe through &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;. With the addition of the new logo, Marvel Studios also added a fanfare to accompany the logo, composed by Brian Tyler, who wrote the scores to &quot;Iron Man 3&quot;, &quot;Thor: The Dark World&quot;, and &quot;Avengers: Age of Ultron&quot;. It was featured on the films &quot;Thor: The Dark World&quot;, &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; (2014), and &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; (2014).
In July 2016, another new logo and opening were introduced, featuring an updated fanfare, composed this time by Michael Giacchino, who first worked with Marvel Studios on the score to &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; (2016). The new opening begins with comic book panels seen in the previous two openings but transitions into footage and art of the characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe films. It was first seen in front of &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;. The updated logo was created by Perception, which was first approached in January 2016 by Marvel to update its logo. Feige specifically requested Perception &quot;to combine the brand and the iconic characters into a single image, showcasing the heroes within the letterforms of the Marvel logo.&quot; The Perception team settled on a concept they dubbed &quot;How to Build a Universe&quot;, which &quot;was designed to pay tribute to [the filmmaking] process by touching on&quot; how a film&#x27;s origins are inspired by the comics, which then results in a script, followed by concept art, resulting in the final film. Perception looked to the initial &quot;flipbook&quot; logo for inspiration, and paid tribute to it in the new opening, as it opens identically to the flipbook logo. Next, the opening includes &quot;various lines lifted directly from the script pages of various Marvel screenplays&quot;, with Perception picking &quot;both iconic fan-favorites, as well as lines that helped establish the breadth of the Marvel Universe.&quot; To add in the concept art images, Perception looked &quot;through a massive archive of concept art and &quot;The Art Of...&quot; books, to select the most iconic images for each beloved character. Utilizing the original digital paintings themselves, the Perception team animated each image being painted from scratch. The final touch was mapping this artwork onto 3D models to giving these once 2D paintings a sense of depth as the camera moves around them.&quot; Finally, over 70 pieces of footage from the 13 films that had been released at that time were included, with Perception arranging them in a way they called the &quot;vault&quot; &quot;where luminescent footage plays on the interior walls of the &quot;Marvel&quot; logotype.&quot;
A modified version of Perception&#x27;s logo was introduced at the 2017 D23 Expo to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the MCU. The logo debuted with &quot;&quot; on April 26, 2018, and was used again in &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp&quot; (2018). With the release of &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, the current Perception logo was altered at Marvel Studios&#x27; behest in honor of Stan Lee; Lee died on November 12, 2018, just a few months before the release of the film. The logo was altered, replacing the characters with Stan Lee&#x27;s MCU cameos and other public appearances related to the MCU, accompanied by a black screen reading &quot;Thank You Stan&quot;. Similarly, the logo was retroactively modified for the Disney+ version of &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2018) in honor of Chadwick Boseman, who died on August 28, 2020. The logo was altered, replacing the characters with images and footage of T&#x27;Challa and Boseman. The logo premiered on November 29, 2020, which would have been Boseman&#x27;s 44th birthday. Additional modifications include having the characters who disappeared in the Blip removed for &quot;Avengers: Endgame&quot;; an additional Boseman tribute one for &quot;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&quot; (2022); and an all-Guardians of the Galaxy opening for &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot; (2023). A shortened sequence opening was used for the Disney+ series &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; (2023). &quot;What If... Strange Supreme Intervened?&quot; (2023), the &quot;What If...?&quot; season two finale, replaced the live-action footage of the logo with animated images from &quot;What If...?&quot;. &quot;Captain America: Brave New World&quot; (2025) was the first Marvel Studios film to not feature the studio&#x27;s logo animation sequence.

=== Television specials design ===
Television specials from Marvel Studios, which are marketed as &quot;Marvel Studios Special Presentation&quot;, feature a special multicolored intro with bongo drum music, reminiscent of the CBS Special Presentation theme featured before animated holiday specials of the 1980s and 1990s. The intro was also designed by Perception, with Giacchino (who directed and composed for the special &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot;) once again creating the music. Jamie Lovett at &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; called the Marvel Studios Special Presentation intro &quot;more colorful&quot; and its fanfare &quot;more playful&quot; than the normal Marvel Studios intro.

<text>Glanvilles Wootton, or Wootton Glanville, is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England. It is situated in the Blackmore Vale under the scarp of the Dorset Downs, south of Sherborne. In the 2011 Census the parish had a population of 196.

To the north of the village is Round Chimneys Farm, which used to be a manor house and home of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. The Farm, Grade II listed since 1960, &quot;originated 1590s, probably added to 1632 with extensive alterations and demolitions C19&quot;. southeast of the village is the hill fort Dungeon Hill.

According to Dorset OPC, &quot;the name of the Parish was changed in 1985, having previously been Wootton Glanville&quot;. The Parish Church is St Mary the Virgin and its register starts at the year 1546. It has been Grade I listed since 1964 as &quot;mainly C14&quot; modifications made in the 15th century and the early 19th century. A great deal of additional historic information about the community and its structures is provided by a document titled &quot;An Inventory of the Historical Monuments in Dorset, Volume 3, Central. Originally published by Her Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office, London, 1970.&quot;

One of the most significant properties in the area, The Manor House, Glanvilles Wootton, is a Georgian manor house, which incorporates an earlier 17th-century house, on 88 acres of parks, pastures and gardens, according to Country Life (magazine). The original house is believed to have been built circa 1616 by George Williams, originally from Wales; the newer Georgian home was built in 1804 by Glanvilles Wootton. 

The &quot;MANOR HOUSE FARMHOUSE WOOTTON GLANVILLES FARM&quot; has been Grade-II listed since 1974. The farm house appears to have originated in the mid 1800s but was modified circa 1978.

<doc id="1074660" wikidata="Q707800" url="?curid=1074660" title="Takamiyama Daigorō">
<text>is an American-born Japanese former professional sumo wrestler. Wrestling for Takasago stable for twenty years from 1964 to 1984, his highest rank was &quot;sekiwake&quot;. Takamiyama set a number of longevity records in sumo, including most tournaments ranked in the top &quot;makuuchi&quot; division, and most consecutive top division appearances. In July 1972, he became the first foreign-born wrestler to win the top division championship. He is also the first foreign-born wrestler ever to take charge of a training stable, founding Azumazeki stable in 1986. His most successful wrestler was fellow Hawaiian Akebono who reached the sport&#x27;s highest rank of &quot;yokozuna&quot; in 1993. Takamiyama retired as a coach in 2009.

==Early life==

Kuhaulua was born in Happy Valley, Maui to parents who were mostly of Hawaiian descent. Due to his impressive height and weight of 6 foot 2 inches (189 cm) and 280 pounds (127 kg), he was recruited as a tackle for the Henry Perrine Baldwin High School football team. His football coach noticed that he had weak legs and hips, and recommended that he train his lower body through sumo, a sport popular among the local Japanese-American community. He joined a local amateur sumo club and it was there that he was spotted by visiting professional sumo wrestlers from Japan. He was eventually recruited by the head coach of Takasago stable, former &quot;yokozuna&quot; Maedayama. After graduating from Baldwin High School in Wailuku in 1963 he left for Tokyo on February 22, 1964, to join Takasago stable as a new recruit.

==Sumo career==
Takamiyama made his professional debut in March 1964. He was quickly given one of Takasago&#x27;s prestigious &quot;shikona&quot;, or ring name, to evoke the founder of the stable, Takasago Uragorō. He achieved &quot;sekitori&quot; status in March 1967 when he won promotion to the second highest &quot;jūryō&quot; division. He reached the top &quot;makuuchi&quot; division five tournaments later. He had an exceptionally long top division career that spanned from January 1968 to January 1984. For many years he held the record for having competed in the most tournaments as a top division wrestler, at 97 (these were also consecutive tournaments). In November 2009 this record was broken by the veteran &quot;ōzeki&quot; Kaiō, and Kaiō has also surpassed his long-standing record of 1430 top division bouts. However, Takamiyama still holds the record for the most consecutive bouts in the top division (1231), as he did not miss a match from his debut until he was forced to withdraw from the September 1981 tournament because of a training injury.

He won a total of twelve &quot;kinboshi&quot; (gold stars awarded for &quot;maegashira&quot; wins against a &quot;yokozuna&quot;), a record which stood until Akinoshima surpassed it in the 1990s. His first &quot;kinboshi&quot; came in only his second top division tournament against Sadanoyama, who had won the previous two tournaments but suddenly retired just two days after losing to him. His final gold star came ten years later at the age of 35, against Kitanoumi in September 1978 – only the fourth time the &quot;yokozuna&quot; had been beaten that year. Takamiyama also won eleven special prizes, or &quot;sanshō&quot; for his performances in tournaments.

The highlight of his career came in July 1972 when he won the tournament championship with a 13–2 record – the first foreigner ever to do so. Ranked at &quot;maegashira&quot; 4, he lost only to Kotozakura and Takanohana and defeated Asahikuni on the final day to finish one win ahead of Takanohana. A congratulatory letter from US President Richard Nixon was read out by the US Ambassador to Japan at the presentation ceremony, marking the first time English had been officially spoken on the &quot;dohyō&quot;.

Following this victory he was promoted to sumo&#x27;s third highest rank of &quot;sekiwake&quot;. He was to hold this rank a further seven times, but he was ultimately unable to score ten wins or more in consecutive tournaments and so was never able to reach the rank of &quot;ōzeki&quot;. Nevertheless, he paved the way for other Hawaii wrestlers such as Konishiki and Akebono. His final appearance in the &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; ranks was at &quot;komusubi&quot; in September 1982 at age 38, making him the second oldest postwar &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; wrestler after former &quot;ōzeki&quot; Nayoroiwa.

Due to his exceptionally large size – he weighed over 200 kg as his peak – and trademark sideburns and bright orange &quot;mawashi&quot;, Takamiyama was an instantly recognisable figure to the Japanese public, even amongst those who did not regularly follow sumo. He appeared in several television commercials before the practice was banned by the Sumo Association. His great fighting spirit, and his determination to never miss a bout no matter what injuries he might be carrying – a Japanese character trait known as &quot;gaman&quot; – were much admired.

==Retirement from sumo==

Takamiyama&#x27;s goal had always been to fight until the age of forty, but a serious elbow injury sustained in November 1983 caused him to fall to &quot;jūryō&quot;, and in May 1984, facing certain demotion to the third &quot;makushita&quot; division, he announced his retirement after twenty years in sumo. He was just a few weeks short of his fortieth birthday. He became a member of the Japan Sumo Association, with the name &quot;Azumazeki&quot;. To do so he had taken Japanese citizenship in 1980 and adopted the Japanese name , his wife&#x27;s family name.

Takamiyama had been responsible for recruiting fellow Hawaiian Konishiki to Takasago stable in July 1982, while he was still an active wrestler. He subsequently opened his own training stable, Azumazeki-&quot;beya&quot;, in February 1986, the first foreign-born former wrestler to do so. Another Hawaiian, Akebono, became the stable&#x27;s first &quot;sekitori&quot; in 1990, and became the first foreign-born &quot;yokozuna&quot; in 1993. One of Azumazeki&#x27;s stated goals after this was to coach a Japanese wrestler to the top division, and this was achieved in July 2000 when the popular Takamisakari made his &quot;makuuchi&quot; debut. He was later joined by Ushiomaru, who in 2009 took over the running of the stable when Azumazeki reached the Sumo Association&#x27;s mandatory retirement age of sixty-five.

His farewell party at a local hotel in Tokyo on 6 June 2009 attracted 1000 guests, including Akebono and Konishiki. A congratulatory letter from US President Barack Obama was read out.

==Fighting style==
Takamiyama&#x27;s technique was somewhat rudimentary (his eleven &quot;sanshō&quot; awards did not include a Technique Prize). He tended to rely on his strength and momentum rather than work on the opponent&#x27;s &quot;mawashi&quot; with throwing moves. His two most common winning techniques were &quot;yorikiri&quot; (force out) and &quot;oshidashi&quot; (push out). Being exceptionally strong he regularly won by &quot;kimedashi&quot; (armlock force out) and &quot;tsuridashi&quot; (lift out). His balance was suspect, as his long legs meant he was rather top-heavy with his centre of gravity too high. As a result, he was often prone to being thrown by lighter, more agile opponents. At a peak weight of he was the heaviest sumo wrestler of his time. Two lightweights who he often had trouble with were Asahikuni and Washuyama.

<text>Godmanstone (or Godmanston) is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England, situated approximately north of the county town Dorchester. Its name means &quot;Godman&#x27;s Farm&quot; and it is sited by the River Cerne amongst chalk hills of the Dorset Downs. Dorset County Council&#x27;s latest (2013) estimate of the parish population is 130. In the 2011 census the population of Godmanstone parish combined with the small adjoining parish of Nether Cerne was 156.

Godmanstone used to have a pub—The Smiths Arms—which claimed to be the smallest in Britain. The story attached to the claim was that the original licence was granted by King Charles II when he requested that the village smith serve him a glass of porter. The smith refused because he had no licence, so Charles granted him one on the spot and was served his drink. The licence only applied to the smithy; adjacent living quarters, subsequently used by drinkers, were larger. The business has since closed.

Francis Cottington, 1st Baron Cottington (ca.1579–1652) came from Godmanston. He was the English lord treasurer and ambassador and leader of the pro-Spanish, pro-Roman Catholic faction in the court of Charles I.

The parish church is partly Norman, chiefly perpendicular, with a tower; and was recently repaired.

<doc id="1074707" wikidata="Q3208556" url="?curid=1074707" title="East Lulworth">
<text>East Lulworth is a village and civil parish nine miles east of Dorchester, near Lulworth Cove, in the county of Dorset, England. The village, which consists of 17th-century thatched cottages, is dominated by the barracks of the Royal Armoured Corps Gunnery School who use a portion of the Purbeck Hills as a gunnery range. The parish population recorded at the 2021 census was 241.

An area east of the village is known as Whiteway.

The nearby Lulworth Estate grounds contain the first Roman Catholic chapel to be built after the Protestant Reformation. It was designed in 1786 by John Tasker in the form of a Greek mausoleum at a cost of £2,380 and was the private chapel of the recusant Weld family. The Weld-Blundell family, formerly owners of the estate, were descendants of the Welds. 

The Church of England parish church is dedicated to St. Andrew. Only the perpendicular tower and octagonal font are original from the medieval building; the rest of the church was rebuilt in 1864 to designs of John Hicks, who also designed East Holme church. The church is a Grade II* listed building.

Henry Rolls (1803–1877) was a shoemaker who taught himself to read and write. He kept a journal of the main happenings of village life from 1824 until 1877. After Henry&#x27;s death, his son George Rolls (1846–1929) continued the journal, covering the period from 1877 to 1928. George&#x27;s daughter Agnes Mary Rolls (1879–1961) took over responsibility for the journal from 1929 to 1955.

<doc id="1074708" wikidata="Q3202526" url="?curid=1074708" title="Atlantida (novel)">
<text>Atlantida () is a fantasy novel by French writer Pierre Benoit, published in February 1919. It was translated into English in 1920 as &quot;Atlantida&quot;. &quot;L&#x27;Atlantide&quot; was Benoit&#x27;s second novel, following &quot;Koenigsmark&quot;, and it won the Grand Prize of the French Academy. The English translation of &quot;Atlantida&quot; was first published in the United States as a serial in &quot;Adventure&quot; magazine.

The story inspired several films.

==Plot summary==

It is 1896 in the French Algerian Sahara. Two officers, André de Saint-Avit and Jean Morhange investigate the disappearance of their fellow officers. While doing so, they are drugged and kidnapped by a Targui warrior, the procurer for the monstrous Queen Antinea. 

Antinea, descendant of the rulers of Atlantis, has a cave wall with 120 niches carved into it, one for each of her lovers. Only 53 have been filled; when all 120 have been filled, Antinea will sit atop a throne in the center of the cave and rest forever. Saint-Avit is unable to resist Antinea&#x27;s charms. By her will, he murders the asexual Morhange. Ultimately, he is able to escape and get out of the desert alive.

== Inspiration ==
According to some, Pierre Benoit was inspired, for the character of Antinea, by the Berber queen Tin Hinan.

In the book Pierre Benoit also draws upon the memories of his youth. As the son of a colonel, he spent his early years in Tunisia, where his father was posted, and then attended school in Algeria. In Algeria, Pierre Benoit also fulfilled his military service. In an article in &quot;L&#x27;Écho de Paris&quot; dated 2 February 1920, Pierre Benoit explained:

This statement follows an allegation by reviewer Henry Magden in October 1919 that Benoit had plagiarised Sir Henry Rider Haggard&#x27;s novel (1887); in the ensuing lawsuit for libel, Benoit stated this to be untrue as he could neither speak nor read English. Indeed, no French translation of Haggard&#x27;s book had been available at the time.

== Film adaptations ==
The first film adaptation of &quot;L&#x27;Atlantide&quot; was made during 1920 (and released in 1921), directed by Jacques Feyder.

During 1932–1933, famed German film director Georg Wilhelm Pabst made three films based on the novel, one each in German, French and English, as was common in the early to mid-1930s. They were titled &quot;Die Herrin von Atlantis&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Atlantide&quot; and &quot;The Mistress of Atlantis&quot; respectively.

An American film version of the story was released in 1949 under the title &quot;Siren of Atlantis&quot;, starring María Montez.

The Italian-made peplum film &quot;Hercules and the Conquest of Atlantis&quot; (&quot;Ercole alla conquista di Atlantide&quot;, 1961), directed by Vittorio Cottafavi, drew heavily on the plot and characters of the book, having Queen Antinea capture Hercules and his companion Androcles, and imprisoning them in her red-lined underground palace. Androcles takes the Saint-Avit role and tries to murder Hercules, who (unsurprisingly) is able to resist Antinea&#x27;s wiles and eventually saves the day. The film incorporates an anti-nuclear theme and has been praised by critics as one of the better peplum (&quot;Sword-and-sandal&quot;) films. However its alternative US title – &quot;Hercules and the Captive Women&quot; – makes clear the audience it was expected to attract.
Another Italian film, the comedy &quot;Totò sceicco&quot; (1950) starring Totò, is a parody of the story (and in particular of the 1949 film &quot;Siren of Atlantis&quot;).

A European co-production, &quot;Journey Beneath the Desert&quot; also filmed in 1961 was directed by Edgar G. Ulmer who replaced an ailing Frank Borzage.

A 1972 French television film &quot;L&#x27;Atlantide&quot; was directed by Jean Kerchbron.

In 1992, another film adaptation of the novel was made, &quot;L&#x27;Atlantide&quot;, directed by Bob Swaim and starring Tchéky Karyo, Jean Rochefort, Anna Galiena, and the famous Spanish actor, Fernando Rey.

<doc id="1074713" wikidata="Q5330822" url="?curid=1074713" title="Easton, Dorset">
<text>Easton is a village on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England. The village is situated at Tophill, within the centre of the island. As with the rest of Portland&#x27;s villages and settlements, Easton, including the settlements Reforne and Straits, has been designated as a conservation area, as it is a place of special architectural and historic interest. Easton, Wakeham and Reforne were designated pre-1974.

The village has a small square with many shops and shopping arcade, three churches, a small park, and other amenities, including various pubs, as well as the nearby Secondary school Royal Manor Arts College, (which has now been closed down, with the only secondary school on the island being Atlantic Academy Portland). Along with Fortuneswell, Easton is the main hub of the Isle of Portland&#x27;s activities. St George&#x27;s Centre and The George Inn lies within the Reforne area of Easton, and provides facilities for many local events.

==History==
Easton was established around a natural watercourse and various springs, of which there are indications of medieval inhabitants. The village pond was situated at Easton Square, and a well head and pump were later installed in 1775. Easton largely developed through Tophill&#x27;s prime industry of agriculture. By 1782, Easton was the island&#x27;s second largest settlement. The island&#x27;s first school, Maister&#x27;s School, opened in Straits during 1720. St. George&#x27;s Church was built as the island&#x27;s parish church within Reforne, between 1754 and 1766, replacing St Andrew&#x27;s.

The village saw an infamous event during 1803, known as the Easton Massacre, which saw British armed forces shoot and kill three citizens, when trying to press males of Portland into service. The press gang arrived at Easton Square where they were met by a group of citizens who had gathered to stop them. When one man was taken and the crowd attempted a rescue, the captain fired on them. The marines under his command also opened fire. There were three people killed, and another two wounded, one of whom, Mary Way, later died of her wounds. From the 1840s onwards Portland saw a large increase in its population, leading to Easton expanding, and becoming more urbanised. Both Reforne and Wakeham were separate hamlets until this time, when they merged into Easton.

During the 19th-century, the Easton &amp; Church Hope Railway put forward plans to extend the Weymouth and Portland Railway Line to Easton. On 1 October 1900 Easton station was opened to goods trains, and to the public on 1 September 1902. The line closed to passengers in 1952 and goods trains in 1965. The station site was demolished in 1970, and is now the site of a residential home. In 1904, Easton Square, which had long been barren land, was transformed into Easton Gardens. All Saints Church was built at Straits between 1914 and 1917, and became the new parish church for Tophill. Easton remains one of Portland&#x27;s main hubs of activity to date.

==Features==
The area of Easton is surrounded by quarries, both working and non-working. To the south of the village, and near Weston, are the two Portland Windmills. The disused and historic stone towers date from as early as 1608. Both windmills have been separate Grade II Listed monuments since September 1978, and are the only historic windmill remains to survive in Dorset. In early 2011, a Tesco, Portland&#x27;s first major supermarket was opened in Easton.

The Portland Museum is located near to Easton, in Wakeham, close to Church Ope Cove. The museum was founded by Marie Stopes and opened in 1930. The castellated building at Easton Lane is the Drill Hall of 1868. It was once the home of the Portland Volunteers.

==Grade Listed Features==
Easton has a wide array of architecture and buildings, a number of which are Grade Listed.

4 Easton Square, 30 Easton Square, 31 Easton Square, a fish house to the north of No. 31 Easton Street, 28 Easton Street, 32 Easton Street, 42 and 44 Easton Street, 41 Easton Street, as well as 23 Delhi Lane and its railings, are all Grade II Listed. Easton Methodist Church, along with its former manse and boundary walls, has been Grade II* Listed since May 1993. The church dates from 1906 and opened in September 1907. The church hall of the church was formerly a Wesleyan school, dated 1878 on porch. It was also designated Grade II. The church is still active today, alongside Underhill Methodist Church, as part of the Portland Methodist Circuit. Within Straits, the area of Easton linking to the hamlet of Wakeham, is the 20th-century Anglican church All Saints Church. It is Grade II Listed.

At Easton Gardens, the prominent Clock Tower, completed in 1907, is Grade II Listed. At Easton Lane is one of various lime kilns remaining on Portland. At the time of becoming Grade II Listed in November 1984, it was abandoned, and in poor condition. It lay in ruin for decades, but by 2002 was turned into a residence and craft workshop. Opposite this lime kiln is another which is larger and more complete, but not Grade Listed.

Within Reforne there are various notable buildings. The Sugar Loaf Cafe, 26 Reforne, 30 Reforne, 107 and 109 Reforne, 135 Reforne, Apsley House (54 Reforne), 111 and 113 Reforne, and 28 Reforne, are all Grade II Listed. St George&#x27;s Church is found at the far end of Reforne - a Church of England church. The church was designated as a Grade I listed building in January 1951, and is one of three buildings on Portland to be Grade I. Its graveyard wall also became Grade II Listed in September 1978, and in May 1993 the church&#x27;s lych gate entrance became Grade II Listed too. The George Inn is a public house at Reforne. It is one of the oldest inhabited buildings on the island, and has been Grade II Listed since May 1993. St George&#x27;s Centre, also in Reforne, was a former school opened in 1857, and now a community information and activity centre. It is Grade II Listed. The centre&#x27;s community hall and boundary walls to the south are also Grade II listed.

<text>Mummy Mountain is the second highest peak of the Spring Mountains in Clark County, Nevada, United States. It is the twentieth highest mountain in the state. The mountain is located within the Mount Charleston Wilderness and the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.

It takes its name from its vague resemblance to a mummy, or perhaps more accurately an Egyptian sarcophagus seen in profile, with the &quot;head&quot; to the north formed by outcropping above Lee Canyon, the gently rounded main summit forming the &quot;body&quot;, and a southern rise and cliffs forming the &quot;feet&quot;, called &quot;Mummy&#x27;s Toe&quot;. This appearance is especially prominent from U.S. Route 95, which passes by the mountain to the east.

The most common route to the summit is from the North Loop Trail or Trail Canyon to Mount Charleston, starting from where it reaches close to the top of the ridge between Mummy Mountain and Mount Charleston. After the first two switchbacks, a steep scramble up a scree slope reaches the top of the ridge, where a faint climber&#x27;s trail leads east to the base of the summit cliffs. The route then jogs north to a class 3 chute leading to the broad and flat summit plateau.

<doc id="1074722" wikidata="Q271376" url="?curid=1074722" title="Amestris">
<text>Amestris (, &quot;Amēstris&quot;, perhaps the same as Άμαστρις, &quot;Amāstris&quot;, from Old Persian &quot;Amāstrī-&quot;, &quot;strong woman&quot;) was an Achaemenid queen, wife of king Xerxes I and mother of king Artaxerxes I.
She was poorly regarded by ancient Greek historians.

==Life==
Amestris was the daughter of Otanes, one of the seven noblemen reputed to have killed the magus who was impersonating King Bardiya in 522 BC. After this, Darius I the Great of Persia assumed the throne. According to Herodotus, Otanes was honoured with royal marriages. Darius I married Otanes&#x27; daughter Phaedymia while Otanes married a sister of Darius, who gave birth to Amestris.

When Darius died in 486 BC, Amestris was married to the crown prince, Xerxes. Herodotus describes Amestris as a cruel despot:

The origin of this story is unclear, since known records and accounts indicate that human sacrifices were not permitted within the Persian religion. Also since most accounts of the time are from Greek sources, and due to the involvement of Greece as an opponent of Persia, it is possible that not all accounts are accurate.

Circa 478 BC, her son Crown Prince Darius was married to his cousin Artaynte at Sardis. She was the daughter of Xerxes&#x27; brother Masistes. At the behest of Xerxes, Artaynte committed adultery with him (Xerxes). When Amestris found out, she did not seek revenge against Artaynte, but against her mother, Masistes&#x27; wife, as Amestris thought that it was her connivance. On Xerxes&#x27; birthday, Amestris sent for his guards and mutilated Masistes&#x27; wife by cutting off her breasts and threw them to dogs, and her nose and ears and lips also, and cutting out her tongue as well. On seeing this, Masistes fled to Bactria to start a revolt, but was intercepted by Xerxes&#x27; army who killed him and his sons.

Amestris outlived Xerxes, remaining active in royal affairs during the long reign of their son Artaxerxes I. She died in early 424 BC, aged nearly ninety, with Artaxerxes himself dying soon after.

== Genealogy ==




== Popular depictions ==

Amestris is a character in the opera &quot;Serse&quot; by George Frideric Handel (italianized as &quot;Amastre&quot;). In the opera, Amestris is about to marry Xerxes (Serse), yet he falls in love with another woman and wants to marry her instead. Amestris disguises herself as a man in order to be near him. At the end of the opera, Xerxes is sorry for the things he did and asks Amestris once more to be his wife.

In the manga Fullmetal Alchemist the fictional country the story takes place in is named Amestris.

<text>Wittenberge () is a town of eighteen thousand people on the middle Elbe in the district of Prignitz, Brandenburg, Germany.

==Geography==

Wittenberge is situated at the right (north-eastern) bank of the middle Elbe at its confluence with the Stepenitz and Karthane in the German district of Prignitz. Within the same district, the town borders the &quot;Ämter&quot; Lenzen-Elbtalaue and Bad Wilsnack/Weisen as well as the district capital Perleberg. The Seehausen (Altmark) in the district of Stendal, Saxony-Anhalt, lies on the opposite side of the Elbe.

==History==
The site was marked out in 1239 at Wendischwalde and in 1300 the Saxon king, Otto I, established the settlement. The exact date when Wittenberge attained municipal status is unknown. The oldest document in which Wittenberge is mentioned as a &quot;town&quot; dates from 22 July 1300. Wittenberge grew slowly but steadily. The town castle (1669) survives as the town museum but it suffered fires in 1686 and 1757, and floods from the Elbe in 1709 and 1761. Nevertheless, because of its position, it prospered from the opening of the Berlin–Hamburg steamship traffic. By 1823 milling, processing and refining of foodstuffs were important industries. In 1846 the railway came and a silk factory was built, followed by a chemical factory in 1849. The Reichsbahn railway workshops were established in 1875 and the world-famous Singer Sewing Machine Company opened in 1903 its German manufacturing site Singer Nähmaschinenfabrik Wittenberge. By 1914 the Rathaus was built.

From 15 August 1942 until 17 February 1945 a concentration camp was established near Wittenberge. The camp was a subcamp to the Neuengamme concentration camp. During WW II Wittenberge suffered severe destruction by five air raids and 216 civilians died.

Between the wars much architecture characteristic of the period was built in the form of workers&#x27; housing for the rapidly increased population. Only the railway workshops remain as significant employers of the old industries but the large, skilled workforce remains for the newer industries of precision engineering and applied chemistry.

==Sights==
The oldest building in Wittenberge is &quot;Steintor&quot; (stone Gate) dating from 1450, an ancient gate of the medieval city wall. Only a small part of Wittenberge&#x27;s old town centre with half-timbered houses is left as many old houses were torn down before 1989. The railway station was built in a classicist style in 1846 and rebuilt after considerable bomb damage in World War II. The Town Hall (Rathaus) with its tower measuring 51 metres was inaugurated in 1914. It represents the style of Gründerzeit.

The &quot;Kultur- und Festspielhaus&quot;, a cultural centre, was built in 1959 in a typical style of Socialist realism. After the German reunification it was renovated in reinaugurated in 1999. It is situated at Paul-Lincke-Platz, a place which is named after the composer Paul Lincke who lived in Wittenberge from 1881 to 1884. In Bahnstraße, Wittenberge&#x27;s main street, several residential buildings representing Stalinist architecture on a provincial level can be seen close to the Cultural Centre. They were renovated after the German reunification.

A factory for producing sewing-machines was founded in Wittenberge in 1903. Its clock tower measuring 49 metres which was built in 1928 is one of the symbols of Wittenberge.

<text>Seth Henry Neddermeyer (September 16, 1907 – January 29, 1988) was an American physicist who co-discovered the muon, and later championed the implosion-type nuclear weapon while working on the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II.

==Early life==
Seth Henry Neddermeyer was born in Richmond, Michigan, on September 16, 1907. He attended Olivet College, a small college that his mother, older sister, and uncle had also attended, for two years before his family moved to California. He transferred to Stanford University, from which received his Bachelor of Arts (AB) degree in 1929. His interest in physics was inspired by the work of Robert A. Millikan, and he enrolled in graduate school at California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he wrote his 1935 PhD thesis on &quot;The absorption of high energy electrons&quot;, under the supervision of Carl D. Anderson. He confirmed the theory espoused by Niels Bohr for this process. He also noted large radiative energy losses of electrons in lead, in agreement with the theory propounded by Hans Bethe and Walter Heitler.

Neddermeyer contributed to the research which led to the 1932 discovery of the positron, for which Anderson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936. That year, Neddermeyer and Anderson discovered the muon, using cloud chamber measurements of cosmic rays. Their discovery predated Hideki Yukawa&#x27;s 1935 theory of mesons that postulated the particle as mediating the nuclear force. Anderson and Neddermeyer collaborated with Millikan in high altitude studies of cosmic rays, which confirmed Robert Oppenheimer&#x27;s theory that the air showers produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays contained electrons. They also obtained the first evidence that gamma rays can generate positrons.

==Manhattan Project work==

In early 1941, with World War II raging in Europe but the United States not yet a belligerent, Neddermeyer joined a team led by Charles C. Lauritsen and William A. Fowler at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and then at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., that worked on the photoelectric proximity fuze. After this work was completed, Neddermeyer was recruited by Oppenheimer to work at the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Los Alamos Laboratory. Neddermeyer was an early advocate for the development of an implosion technique for assembling a critical mass in an atomic bomb. Although implosion was suggested by Richard Tolman as early as 1942 and discussed in the introductory lectures given to Los Alamos scientists by Robert Serber, Neddermeyer was one of the first to urge its full development. Unable to find much initial enthusiasm for the concept among his fellow Los Alamos scientists, Neddermeyer presented the first substantial technical analysis of implosion in late April 1943. Oppenheimer considered this to be the beginning of implosion research at Los Alamos.

Though many remained unimpressed, Oppenheimer appointed Neddermeyer the head of a new group to test implosion. His group became the E-5 (Implosion) Group, which was part of Captain William S. Parsons&#x27; E Division. A gun-type nuclear weapon was the preferred method, but implosion research constituted a backup. Neddermeyer embarked on an intensive series of experiments testing cylindrical implosions. The result was a series of distorted shapes. Progress was made; Neddermeyer and a member of his team, Hugh Bradner, along with James L. Tuck from the British Mission, conceived the idea of explosive lenses, in which shaped charges are used to focus the force of an explosion. Nevertheless, seemingly unsolvable problems with shock wave uniformity brought progress on implosion to a crawl.

By September 1943, Neddermeyer&#x27;s team had grown from five people to fifty. That month, John von Neumann came to Los Alamos at Oppenheimer&#x27;s request. Von Neumann was impressed by the implosion concept and, working with Edward Teller, an old friend, made a series of suggestions. Von Neumann was able to create a sound mathematical model of implosion, enabling Neddermeyer to present a proposal for a greatly expanded research program. Edwin McMillan and Isidor Isaac Rabi recommended that George Kistiakowsky, who had a specialized knowledge in the precision use of explosives, be brought in to help the program. In February 1944, Kistiakowsky became Parsons&#x27; deputy for implosion.

In April 1944, tests on the first sample of plutonium that had been produced with neutrons in a nuclear reactor revealed that reactor-bred plutonium contained five times more plutonium-240 than that hitherto produced in cyclotrons. This unwanted isotope that spontaneously decayed and produced neutrons promised to cause a predetonation without sufficiently quick critical mass assembly. It now became apparent that only implosion would work for practical plutonium bombs; a powerful enough gun could not be constructed small enough to be carried in an aircraft, and plutonium-240 was even more difficult to separate from plutonium-239 than the isotopes of uranium that were giving the rest of the Manhattan Project such difficulties. Plutonium was unusable unless implosion worked, but only plutonium could be produced in quantities that would allow regular production of atomic bombs. Thus, the implosion technique now suddenly stood as the key to production of nuclear weapons.

In mid-June 1944, a report from Kistiakowsky to Oppenheimer detailing dysfunctionality within the implosion team led to the ousting of Neddermeyer. He was replaced as the head of the E-5 Group by Kistiakowsky on June 15, 1944, but remained a technical adviser to the implosion program, with group leader status. Neddermeyer was said to have been much embittered by this episode. In Oppenheimer&#x27;s August 1944 reorganization of the Los Alamos Laboratory, Neddermeyer&#x27;s group was renamed X-1, with Norris Bradbury as group leader. The implosion method championed by Neddermeyer was used in the first atom bomb exploded (in the Trinity test), the Fat Man bomb dropped on Nagasaki, and almost all modern nuclear weapons. Kistiakowsky later insisted that &quot;the real invention should be given full credit to [Seth] Neddermeyer&quot; (sic).

==Later years==
In 1946, after World War II ended, Neddermeyer left Los Alamos to become an associate professor at the University of Washington, where he would spend the rest of his career. In due course he became a full professor. He resumed his studies of cosmic rays using a cloud chamber and a new device that he invented to measure the speed of charged particles known as a &quot;chronotron&quot;. He was particularly interested in the properties of the muon, and conducted experiments with muons at SLAC. He participated in the DUMAND Project, for which he helped design large-scale underwater neutrino detectors. Neddermeyer became interested in parapsychology, insisting, in spite of the skepticism of many colleagues, that it warranted proper scientific investigation. He retired in 1973, becoming a professor emeritus, but he continued his research activities for as long as his health permitted. He was afflicted with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

In 1982, he was presented with the Department of Energy&#x27;s Enrico Fermi award. His citation read:

In later life, Neddermeyer was sometimes troubled by the nuclear weapons he had helped to invent. He told an interviewer in 1983:

Neddermeyer died in Seattle on January 29, 1988, from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==In popular culture==
Neddermeyer is portrayed by Colin Bennett in the 1980 BBC series &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;, by Joe D&#x27;Angerio in &quot;Fat Man and Little Boy&quot;, and by Devon Bostick in the Christopher Nolan-directed film &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023).

<text>Halstock is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England, situated approximately south of Yeovil in Somerset. It lies on the route of the ancient Harrow Way. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 546.

Halstock formerly constituted a liberty, containing only the parish itself. It was the site of the martyrdom of Saint Juthwara (Juthware), and a Romano-British Villa excavated between 1967 and 1985.

The village formerly had two inns, &quot;The New Inn&quot; (New Inn Farm), which closed in the late 1950s, and the unusually named &quot;The Quiet Woman&quot; (usually taken as a reference to St Juthware)

In July 2012, Halstock&#x27;s Parish church of St Mary was rededicated by the Bishop of Sherborne to become &quot;St Juthware and St Mary&quot;, in recognition of the local tradition. Much of the church was rebuilt in 1770, with only the 15th-century west tower not being affected. The nave and chancel were rebuilt again on separate dates in the 19th century.

Halstock lies within an electoral ward of the same name, which also contains several nearby parishes including Corscombe, Evershot and Hilfield. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 1,848. This ward is one of 32 that comprise the West Dorset parliamentary constituency.

<doc id="1074742" wikidata="Q5249754" url="?curid=1074742" title="Dedekind-infinite set">
<text>In mathematics, a set &quot;A&quot; is Dedekind-infinite (named after the German mathematician Richard Dedekind) if some proper subset &quot;B&quot; of &quot;A&quot; is equinumerous to &quot;A&quot;. Explicitly, this means that there exists a bijective function from &quot;A&quot; onto some proper subset &quot;B&quot; of &quot;A&quot;. A set is Dedekind-finite if it is not Dedekind-infinite (i.e., no such bijection exists). Proposed by Dedekind in 1888, Dedekind-infiniteness was the first definition of &quot;infinite&quot; that did not rely on the definition of the natural numbers.

A simple example is formula_1, the set of natural numbers. From Galileo&#x27;s paradox, there exists a bijection that maps every natural number &quot;n&quot; to its square &quot;n&quot;2. Since the set of squares is a proper subset of formula_1, formula_1 is Dedekind-infinite. 

Until the foundational crisis of mathematics showed the need for a more careful treatment of set theory, most mathematicians assumed that a set is infinite if and only if it is Dedekind-infinite. In the early twentieth century, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, today the most commonly used form of axiomatic set theory, was proposed as an axiomatic system to formulate a theory of sets free of paradoxes such as Russell&#x27;s paradox. Using the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the originally highly controversial axiom of choice included (ZFC) one can show that a set is Dedekind-finite if and only if it is finite in the usual sense. However, there exists a model of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice (ZF) in which there exists an infinite, Dedekind-finite set, showing that the axioms of ZF are not strong enough to prove that every set that is Dedekind-finite is finite. There are definitions of finiteness and infiniteness of sets besides the one given by Dedekind that do not depend on the axiom of choice.

A vaguely related notion is that of a Dedekind-finite ring. 

==Comparison with the usual definition of infinite set==
This definition of &quot;infinite set&quot; should be compared with the usual definition: a set &quot;A&quot; is infinite when it cannot be put in bijection with a finite ordinal, namely a set of the form for some natural number &quot;n&quot; – an infinite set is one that is literally &quot;not finite&quot;, in the sense of bijection.

During the latter half of the 19th century, most mathematicians simply assumed that a set is infinite if and only if it is Dedekind-infinite. However, this equivalence cannot be proved with the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice (AC) (usually denoted &quot;ZF&quot;). The full strength of AC is not needed to prove the equivalence; in fact, the equivalence of the two definitions is strictly weaker than the axiom of countable choice (CC). (See the references below.)

==Dedekind-infinite sets in ZF==

A set &quot;A&quot; is Dedekind-infinite if it satisfies any, and then all, of the following equivalent (over ZF) conditions:
*it has a countably infinite subset;
*there exists an injective map from a countably infinite set to &quot;A&quot;;
*there is a function that is injective but not surjective;
*there is an injective function , where N denotes the set of all natural numbers;
it is dually Dedekind-infinite if:
*there is a function that is surjective but not injective;
it is weakly Dedekind-infinite if it satisfies any, and then all, of the following equivalent (over ZF) conditions:
*there exists a surjective map from &quot;A&quot; onto a countably infinite set;
*the powerset of &quot;A&quot; is Dedekind-infinite;
and it is infinite if:
*for any natural number &quot;n&quot;, there is no bijection from {0, 1, 2, ..., n−1} to &quot;A&quot;.

Then, ZF proves the following implications: Dedekind-infinite ⇒ dually Dedekind-infinite ⇒ weakly Dedekind-infinite ⇒ infinite.

There exist models of ZF having an infinite Dedekind-finite set. Let &quot;A&quot; be such a set, and let &quot;B&quot; be the set of finite injective sequences from &quot;A&quot;. Since &quot;A&quot; is infinite, the function &quot;drop the last element&quot; from &quot;B&quot; to itself is surjective but not injective, so &quot;B&quot; is dually Dedekind-infinite. However, since &quot;A&quot; is Dedekind-finite, then so is &quot;B&quot; (if &quot;B&quot; had a countably infinite subset, then using the fact that the elements of &quot;B&quot; are injective sequences, one could exhibit a countably infinite subset of &quot;A&quot;).

When sets have additional structures, both kinds of infiniteness can sometimes be proved equivalent over ZF. For instance, ZF proves that a well-ordered set is Dedekind-infinite if and only if it is infinite.

==History==
The term is named after the German mathematician Richard Dedekind, who first explicitly introduced the definition. It is notable that this definition was the first definition of &quot;infinite&quot; that did not rely on the definition of the natural numbers (unless one follows Poincaré and regards the notion of number as prior to even the notion of set). Although such a definition was known to Bernard Bolzano, he was prevented from publishing his work in any but the most obscure journals by the terms of his political exile from the University of Prague in 1819. Moreover, Bolzano&#x27;s definition was more accurately a relation that held between two infinite sets, rather than a definition of an infinite set &quot;per se&quot;.

For a long time, many mathematicians did not even entertain the thought that there might be a distinction between the notions of infinite set and Dedekind-infinite set. In fact, the distinction was not really realised until after Ernst Zermelo formulated the AC explicitly. The existence of infinite, Dedekind-finite sets was studied by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead in 1912; these sets were at first called &quot;mediate cardinals&quot; or &quot;Dedekind cardinals&quot;.

With the general acceptance of the axiom of choice among the mathematical community, these issues relating to infinite and Dedekind-infinite sets have become less central to most mathematicians. However, the study of Dedekind-infinite sets played an important role in the attempt to clarify the boundary between the finite and the infinite, and also an important role in the history of the AC.

==Relation to the axiom of choice==
Since every infinite well-ordered set is Dedekind-infinite, and since the AC is equivalent to the well-ordering theorem stating that every set can be well-ordered, clearly the general AC implies that every infinite set is Dedekind-infinite. However, the equivalence of the two definitions is much weaker than the full strength of AC.

In particular, there exists a model of ZF in which there exists an infinite set with no countably infinite subset. Hence, in this model, there exists an infinite, Dedekind-finite set. By the above, such a set cannot be well-ordered in this model.

If we assume the axiom of countable choice (i. e., ACω), then it follows that every infinite set is Dedekind-infinite. However, the equivalence of these two definitions is in fact strictly weaker than even the CC. Explicitly, there exists a model of ZF in which every infinite set is Dedekind-infinite, yet the CC fails (assuming consistency of ZF).

==Proof of equivalence to infinity, assuming axiom of countable choice==
That every Dedekind-infinite set is infinite can be easily proven in ZF: every finite set has by definition a bijection with some finite ordinal &quot;n&quot;, and one can prove by induction on &quot;n&quot; that this is not Dedekind-infinite.

By using the axiom of countable choice (denotation: axiom CC) one can prove the converse, namely that every infinite set &quot;X&quot; is Dedekind-infinite, as follows: 

First, define a function over the natural numbers (that is, over the finite ordinals) , so that for every natural number &quot;n&quot;, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the set of finite subsets of &quot;X&quot; of size &quot;n&quot; (i.e. that have a bijection with the finite ordinal &quot;n&quot;). &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is never empty, or otherwise &quot;X&quot; would be finite (as can be proven by induction on &quot;n&quot;).

The image of f is the countable set whose members are themselves infinite (and possibly uncountable) sets. By using the axiom of countable choice we may choose one member from each of these sets, and this member is itself a finite subset of &quot;X&quot;. More precisely, according to the axiom of countable choice, a (countable) set exists, so that for every natural number &quot;n&quot;, &quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is a member of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) and is therefore a finite subset of &quot;X&quot; of size &quot;n&quot;.

Now, we define &quot;U&quot; as the union of the members of &quot;G&quot;. &quot;U&quot; is an infinite countable subset of &quot;X&quot;, and a bijection from the natural numbers to &quot;U&quot;, , can be easily defined. We may now define a bijection that takes every member not in &quot;U&quot; to itself, and takes &quot;h&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) for every natural number to . Hence, &quot;X&quot; is Dedekind-infinite, and we are done.

==Generalizations==
Expressed in category-theoretical terms, a set &quot;A&quot; is Dedekind-finite if in the category of sets, every monomorphism is an isomorphism. A von Neumann regular ring &quot;R&quot; has the analogous property in the category of (left or right) &quot;R&quot;-modules if and only if in &quot;R&quot;, implies . More generally, a &quot;Dedekind-finite ring&quot; is any ring that satisfies the latter condition. Beware that a ring may be Dedekind-finite even if its underlying set is Dedekind-infinite, e.g. the integers.

<text>Ivan Andrew Sag (November 9, 1949 – September 10, 2013) was an American linguist and cognitive scientist. He did research in areas of syntax and semantics as well as work in computational linguistics.

==Personal life==
Born in Alliance, Ohio on November 9, 1949, Sag attended the Mercersburg Academy but was expelled shortly before graduation. He received a BA from the University of Rochester, an MA from the University of Pennsylvania—where he studied comparative Indo-European languages, Sanskrit, and sociolinguistics—and a PhD from MIT in 1976, writing his dissertation (advised by Noam Chomsky) on ellipsis.

Sag received a Mellon Fellowship at Stanford University in 1978–79, and remained in California from that point on. He was appointed a position in Linguistics at Stanford, and earned tenure there. He died of cancer in 2013. He was married to sociolinguist Penelope Eckert.

==Academic work==
Sag made notable contributions to the fields of syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and language processing. His early work was as a member of the research teams that invented and developed head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) as well as generalized phrase structure grammar, HPSG&#x27;s immediate intellectual predecessor. Later, he worked on Sign-Based Construction Grammar, which blended HPSG with ideas from Berkeley Construction Grammar. 

He was the author or co-author of 10 books and over 100 articles. In general, his research late in life primarily concerned constraint-based, lexicalist models of grammar, and their relation to theories of language processing.

Sag was the Sadie Dernham Patek Professor in Humanities, Professor of Linguistics, and Director of the Symbolic Systems Program at Stanford University. A fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Linguistic Society of America, in 2005 he received the LSA&#x27;s Fromkin Prize for distinguished contributions to the field of linguistics.

He was honored by a volume of studies published in 2013 in his honor, &quot;The Core and the Periphery: Data-Driven Perspectives on Syntax Inspired by Ivan A. Sag&quot;, edited by Philip Hofmeister and Elisabeth Norcliffe.

<doc id="1074745" wikidata="Q6144899" url="?curid=1074745" title="USS Haddock (SS-231)">
<text>USS &quot;Haddock&quot; (SS-231), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the second submarine of the United States Navy to be named for the haddock, a small edible Atlantic fish related to the cod. A previous submarine had been named &quot;Haddock&quot; (SS-32), but was renamed &quot;K-1&quot; prior to her launching, so &quot;Haddock&quot; (SS-231) was the first to actually bear the name.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Haddock&quot; (SS-231) was laid down at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, on 31 March 1941. She was launched on 20 October 1941, sponsored by Mrs. William H. Allen, and commissioned on 14 March 1942, Lieutenant Commander Arthur H. Taylor (United States Naval Academy Class of 1927) in command.

== First war patrol, July – September 1942 ==
After shakedown and training cruises off New England, &quot;Haddock&quot; sailed for the Pacific on 19 June 1942 and arrived Pearl Harbor 16 July. She departed on her first war patrol on 28 July, the first submarine to do so with the new SJ radar. This equipment added greatly to her power in seeking out and destroying enemy ships in darkness or reduced visibility.

Penetrating into the Bonin Islands–East China Sea area, &quot;Haddock&quot; attacked a freighter on the surface on 22 August, sinking troop transport &quot;Tatsuho Maru&quot; (6334 tons). &quot;Tatsuho Maru&quot; had suffered engine trouble and had fallen back; being left behind by her convoy making her easy prey for the new boat and crew. Haddock put a torpedo into her port side #4 hold where 10,000 gallons of aviation gasoline was stored. This caught fire and exploded. The ensuing damage took &quot;Tatsuho Maru&quot; down by the stern in five minutes, taking 26 passengers and 12 crewmen with her. In the Formosa Straits on 26 August &quot;Haddock&quot; fired four stern shots at &quot;Teishun Maru&quot; (formally Vichy French &quot;Tai Seun Hong&quot;) but missed; the submarine swung around to bring her bow tubes to bear and sent the 2251 ton cargo ship to the bottom. &quot;Haddock&quot; patrolled off Okinawa before returning to Midway 19 September 1942.

== Second, third, and fourth war patrols, October 1942 – April 1943 ==
&quot;Haddock&quot;″s second war patrol, commencing 11 October from Midway, was carried out in the Yellow Sea. After two attacks without hits, the submarine torpedoed &quot;Tekkai Maru&quot; (1925 tons) amidships on 3 November, breaking her in two. She was forced to break off another attack on 6 November after damaging the IJA converted troop transport &quot;French Maru&quot; (5828 tons) because of destroyers and search aircraft, but during the night of 11–12 November blew off the stern of cargo ship &quot;Venice Maru&quot; (6571 tons) east of the island of Honshū. &quot;Haddock&quot; damaged another ship on Friday 13 November, only to be prevented from finishing her off by escort craft, and she expended her last torpedo on &quot;Nichinan Maru&quot; (6503 tons) on 16 November. After a brief gunfire duel with her victim, (the merchantman sunk later that day.) the submarine headed for Pearl Harbor, arriving on 4 December.

&quot;Haddock&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 28 December on her third war patrol, this time to the oceans south of Japan. She was attacked by two destroyers raining depth charges, and when she finally surfaced to clear the area, &quot;Haddock&quot; found herself surrounded by Japanese patrol craft. The submarine sped out of the trap just in time to avoid destruction.

A few days later, 17 January 1943, she sank an unidentified/uncredited freighter of 4,000 tons, and on 19 January &quot;Haddock&quot; detected six cargo vessels steaming in double column. Gaining attack position on the last ship, she scored two hits and sent her to the bottom. Aerial attack and depth charges kept her from bagging the other members of the convoy and bad weather forced &quot;Haddock&quot; to return to Midway on 17 February.

&quot;Haddock&quot; cleared Midway on 11 March for her fourth war patrol, and saw her first action on 3 April off Palau, when she encountered the converted fleet oiler &quot;Arima Maru&quot; (7, 389 tons) fully loaded with 7, 880 tons of heavy oil, protected by a corvette (postwar analysis identified the escort as the destroyer .) The submarine launched one torpedo at the corvette, but the torpedo apparently ran under without exploding. &quot;Haddock&quot; then turned her attention to the tanker and succeeded in sinking her with a spread of three torpedoes. Following the torpedo tracks, the corvette dropped 24 depth charges, many directly over &quot;Haddock&quot;, causing her to lose buoyancy and she descended to 415 ft. The attack also damaged her conning tower and radar system. The following day she was ordered to terminate her patrol early due to the severity of the damage, and she returned to Pearl Harbor on 19 April 1943.

== Fifth, sixth, and seventh war patrols, June – November 1943 ==
Setting out from Pearl Harbor again on 30 June, &quot;Haddock&quot; set course for the Caroline Islands on her fifth war patrol. Detecting a group of four escorted transports north of Palau on 21 July, she maneuvered into position and sank &quot;Saipan Maru&quot; (5532 tons). The depth charge attacks of the accompanying ships were ineffective. That same day &quot;Haddock&quot; came upon two unescorted tankers. Her first attack failed to sink the two ships, but she followed the ships and made two more attacks before finally breaking off the action for lack of torpedoes. &quot;Haddock&quot; arrived at Midway on 6 August and at Pearl Harbor four days later.

&quot;Haddock&quot;″s sixth war patrol was conducted in waters off Truk, the vital Japanese base in the Carolines. Departing Pearl Harbor on 2 September, she torpedoed the collier; &quot;Samsei Maru&quot; (641tons) on 15 September but failed to sink her, and the victim turned to ram the submarine. &quot;Haddock&quot; damaged the auxiliary tanker (14,050 tons) on 20 September forcing the tanker to return to Truk at reduced speed along with her 8000 tons of oil originally destined for Japan herself. The next day she torpedoed and damaged the Japanese collier &quot;Shinyubari Maru&quot; (5354 tons) and then spent a harrowing day eluding the attacks of Japanese escort vessels alerted by the explosions. She returned to Midway on 28 September with all torpedoes expended.

The veteran submarine departed on her seventh war patrol on 20 October 1943 and headed again for the waters off Truk. Late on 1 November, &quot;Haddock&quot; attacked the Japanese cable-layer &quot;Tateishi&quot; and trawler &quot;Kitagami Maru&quot; without success, barely surviving the attacks of a hunter-killer group a few hours later. She made one additional attack on 6 November heavily damaging fleet tanker &quot;Hoyo Maru&quot; (8691 tons) with a torpedo into the stern temporarily forcing her abandonment, before returning to Pearl Harbor on 15 November 1943.

== Eighth and ninth war patrols, December 1943 – May 1944 ==
For her eighth war patrol &quot;Haddock&quot; joined a coordinated attack group with and . She departed Pearl Harbor on 14 December and rendezvoused on 17 December. Encountering a group of warships on 19 January, &quot;Haddock&quot; attacked escort carrier (17830 tons) and damaged her severely with at least two hits before being driven off by the carrier&#x27;s screening vessels. The submarine returned to Pearl Harbor on 5 February 1944.

&quot;Haddock&quot; departed for her ninth war patrol 10 March. Under the USN&#x27;s relentless attack, spearheaded by the submarines, Japan&#x27;s sea lifelines had shrunk to a trickle and targets were scarce, but &quot;Haddock&quot; succeeded in sinking auxiliary minesweeper &quot;Noshiro Maru No.2&quot; (126 tons) on 17 April, before returning to Pearl Harbor on 10 May 1944.

== Tenth and eleventh war patrols, October 1944 – March 1945 ==
Her tenth war patrol was eventful as the Pacific war drew close to its climax. With Commander Roach in &quot;Haddock&quot; commanding, she formed an attack group with and , departing Pearl Harbor on 8 October. Moving to support the invasion of the Philippines, the submarines were present during the battle off Cape Engaño, part of the epochal Battle for Leyte Gulf, on 25 October and unsuccessfully pursued some of the retiring Japanese units. Bothered by a malfunctioning periscope, &quot;Haddock&quot; scored no hits on the rest of her patrol and returned to Pearl Harbor on 10 December.

Fitted out with extra deck guns for her eleventh war patrol, &quot;Haddock&quot; sailed in company with submarines and for the seas east of Japan. The boats made a diversionary sweep designed to pull early warning craft away from the intended track of a carrier group &quot;en route&quot; for air strikes against Tokyo. Gaining their objective with complete success, the submarines attacked the picket boats with gunfire, allowed them to send contact reports, and then sank several, diverting Japanese efforts away from the undetected carrier group. &quot;Haddock&quot; returned to Guam on 14 March 1945.

== Last war patrols, April – August 1945 ==
&quot;Haddock&quot; spent her twelfth and thirteenth war patrols on lifeguard station near Tokyo, standing by to rescue downed airmen after raids on Japanese cities. This duty occupied her from April until her return to Pearl Harbor on 22 August.

&quot;Haddock&quot; departed for the East Coast of the United States on 7 September and after transiting the Panama Canal and visiting various ports on the East Coast, arrived at New London, Conn., on 29 March 1946, nearly four years after she had sailed from the North Atlantic to victory. She was placed in reserve in commission on 20 April and decommissioned on 12 February 1947. In August 1948 &quot;Haddock&quot; was assigned duty as a reserve training ship for 6th Naval District, and served in that capacity until being again placed out of service at New London in May 1952. She was again assigned to reserve training, this time at Portsmouth, N.H., June 1956, and finally was struck from the Naval Vessel Register and sold for scrap to Jacob Checkoway on 23 August 1960. Checkoway used the large stock of oil onboard the vessel to start Checkoway Oil Company, and two of her four Fairbanks-Morse diesel engines are in service at the University of Notre Dame as backup generators.

&quot;Haddock&quot; received 11 battle stars for her service in World War II. All of her war patrols except the twelfth were designated successful and she received the Presidential Unit Citation for her outstanding performance on the second, fifth, sixth, and seventh war patrols.

<text>A kilij (from Turkish &quot;kılıç&quot;, literally &quot;sword&quot;) is a type of one-handed, single-edged and curved scimitar used by the Seljuk Empire, Timurid Empire, Mamluk Empire, Ottoman Empire, and other Turkic khanates of Eurasian steppes and Turkestan. These blades developed from earlier Turko-Mongol sabers that were in use in lands controlled or influenced by the Turkic peoples.

== History ==
=== Etymology===
Most of Turkologists and linguists including Bican Ercilasun and Sevan Nişanyan think that it is derived from the Turkic root &quot;kıl-&quot; which means &quot;to forge&quot; or &quot;to smith&quot;, with the diminutive suffix &quot;-ıç&quot; which creates &quot;kıl-ıç&quot; (roughly &quot;ironwork&quot;, i.e. &quot;sword&quot;). Also one of the earliest mentions of the word was also recorded as (, an Old Turkic phrase from the Orkhon Inscriptions which was erected in 735 AD) in the age of Turkic Khaganate, instead of the other suggested Old Turkic reconstructed form of . However, according to Turkish Language Association, the Turkish root verb &quot;kır-&quot; which means &quot;to kill&quot; with the suffix &quot;-inç&quot; makes &quot;kır-ınç&quot; (instrument for killing) becomes &quot;kılınç&quot;, then &quot;kılıç&quot;, which is apparently not based on the earliest attested forms of the word.

The kilij became the symbol of power and kingdom. For example, Seljuk rulers carried the name Kilij Arslan () means &quot;sword-lion&quot;.

=== Origins ===
The Central Asian Turks and their offshoots began using curved cavalry swords beginning from the late Xiongnu period. The earliest examples of curved, single edged Turkish swords can be found associated with the late Xiongnu and Kök-Turk empires. These swords were made of pattern welded high carbon crucible steel, generally with long slightly curved blades with one sharp edge. A sharp back edge on the distal third of the blade known as or was introduced during this period.


In the Early Middle Ages, the Turkic people of Central Asia came into contact with Middle Eastern civilizations through their shared Islamic faith. Turkic &quot;Ghilman&quot; slave-soldiers serving under the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates introduced kilij-type sabers to all of the other Middle Eastern cultures. Previously, Arabs and Persians used straight-bladed swords such as the earlier types of the Arab saif, takoba and kaskara.

During Islamizaton of the Turks, the kilij became more and more popular in the Islamic armies. When the Seljuk Empire invaded Persia and became the first Turkic Muslim political power in Western Asia, kilij became the dominant sword form. The Iranian (Persian) shamshir was created during the Turkic Seljuk Empire period of Iran/Persia.

=== Evolution of the Ottoman kilij ===
The kilij as a specific type of sabre associated with the Ottoman Turks starts to appear historically from primarily the mid 15th century. One of the oldest known examples is attributed to Özbeg Khan, khaghan of the Golden Horde, from the early 14th century, and is currently on display in the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg. The oldest surviving examples sport a long blade curving slightly from the hilt and more strongly in the distal half. The width of the blade stays narrow (with a slight taper) up until the last 30% of its length, at which point it flares out and becomes wider. This distinctive flaring tip is called a &quot;false edge&quot;, and it greatly adds to the cutting power of the sword. Ottoman sabres of the next couple of centuries were often of the Seljuk variety, though the native kilij form was also found; Iranian blades (that did not have the ) were fitted with Ottoman hilts. These hilts normally had slightly longer quillons to the guard, which was usually of brass or silver, and sported a rounded termination to the grips, usually made of horn, unlike that seen on Iranian swords (Iranian swords usually had iron guards and the grip terminated in a hook-shape often with a metal pommel sheathing). The finest mechanical Damascus and wootz steel were often used in making of these swords. In the classical period of the Ottoman Empire, Bursa, Damascus and the Derbent regions became the most famous swordsmithing centers of the empire. Turkish blades became a major export item to Europe and Asia.

In the late 18th century, though shamshirs continued to be used, the kilij underwent an evolution: the blade was shortened, became much more acutely curved, and was wider with an even deeper . In addition to the flared tip, these blades have a distinct &quot;T-shaped&quot; cross section to the back of the blade. This allowed greater blade stiffness without an increase in weight. Because of the shape of the tip of the blade and the nature of its curvature the kilij could be used to perform the thrust; in this it had an advantage over the shamshir whose extreme curvature did not allow the thrust. Some of these shorter kilij are also referred to as pala, but there does not seem to be a clear-cut distinction in nomenclature.

After the Auspicious Incident, the Turkish army was modernized in the European fashion and kilijs were abandoned for western-type cavalry sabers and smallswords. This change, and the introduction of industrialized European steels to Ottoman market, created a great decline in traditional swordsmithing. Civilians in the provinces and county militia (zeybeks in Western Anatolia, bashi-bazouks in the Balkan provinces), continued to carry hand-made kilijs as a part of their traditional dress. In the late 19th century, Sultan Abdul Hamid II&#x27;s palace guards, the Ertuğrul Brigade, which was composed of nomadic Turks of Anatolia, carried traditional kilijs as a romantic-nationalistic revival of the earlier Ottoman Turkoman cavalry raiders. This sentiment continued after dethronement of the sultan by the nationalist Young Turks. High-ranking officer non-regulation dress saber of early 20th century was a modern composite of traditional kilij, &quot;mameluke&quot; and European cavalry saber.

=== Adoption by Western armed forces ===

Sabres were known and used in eastern, and to a lesser extent central Europe from the time of the Magyar invasions, beginning in the 9th century (see the so-called Sabre of Charlemagne). Following the Ottoman invasion of Balkans, however, European armies were introduced to the kilij itself. The kilij first became popular with the Balkan nations and the Hungarian hussar cavalry after 15th century. Around 1670, the karabela (from Turkish word &quot;karabela&quot;: black bane) evolved, based on Janissary kilij sabres; it became the most popular sword-form in the Polish army. During 17th and 18th centuries, curved sabers that evolved from Turkish kilij were widespread throughout Europe.

The Ottomans&#x27; historical dominance of the region ensured the use of the sword by other nations, notably the Mamluks in Egypt. During the Napoleonic Wars, the French conquest of Egypt brought these swords to the attention of the Europeans. This type of sabre became very popular for light cavalry officers, in both France and Britain, and became a fashionable sword for senior officers to wear. In 1831 the &quot;Mameluke&quot;, as the sword was now called, became a regulation pattern for British general officers (the 1831 Pattern, still in use today). The American victory over the rebellious forces in the citadel of Tripoli in 1805 during the First Barbary War, led to the presentation of bejewelled examples of these swords to the senior officers of the US Marines. Officers of the US Marine Corps still use a mameluke pattern dress sword. Although some genuine Turkish kilij sabres were used by Westerners, most &quot;mameluke sabres&quot; were manufactured in Europe; their hilts were very similar in form to the Ottoman prototype, but their blades, even when an expanded was incorporated, tended to be longer, narrower and less curved than those of the true kilij.

== Terminology ==

The Turkish language has numerous terminology describing swords, swordsmithing, parts and types of blades. Below is listed some of the terminology about names of the main parts of a kilij and scabbard in order of the term, literal translation of the Turkish word, and its equivalent in English terminology of swords.

<text>This article provides an overview of the Austrian post-offices presence in Crete and the use of French currency on Austrian stamps in the Ottoman Empire.

== Postal History ==
Along with several other nations, the Austro-Hungarian Empire maintained its own post offices in Crete in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The three post offices, in Chania, Heraklion and Rethymno, operated from 1890 until 1914, replacing earlier Austrian Lloyd postal agencies and official Austrian postal agencies which operated in turn in these towns starting in 1837 and 1845 respectively.

These offices used Austrian stamps denominated or surcharged in various currencies (Lombardy–Venetian soldi, Turkish paras and piastres, and French centimes and francs) or, much more rarely, used regular not surcharged Austrian stamps.

===French currency issues===
In order to better compete with the French post offices, regular Austrian stamps were overprinted in French currency in 1903 (values 5 Centimes to 4 Francs). The last set was in 1908–1914 in designs similar to the Austrian set commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Emperor&#x27;s accession.

Many stamp collectors and catalogues have traditionally referred to just the French currency issues as &quot;Austrian Post Offices in Crete&quot;, distinguishing them from the Turkish currency issues which have been referred to as &quot;Austrian post offices in the Ottoman Empire&quot; or as &quot;Austrian Levant&quot;. However, stamps in both currencies were in use both in the offices in Crete and in many other Austrian post offices within the Ottoman Empire. Ferchenbauer explains that the reason is that it was not officially permitted to admit the competition outside Crete island.

<text>George Bogdanovich Kistiakowsky (, ;  – December 7, 1982) was a Ukrainian-American physical chemistry professor at Harvard who participated in the Manhattan Project and later served as President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s Science Advisor.

Born in Boyarka in the old Russian Empire, into &quot;an old Ukrainian Cossack family which was part of the intellectual elite in pre-revolutionary Russia&quot;, Kistiakowsky fled his homeland during the Russian Civil War. He made his way to Germany, where he earned his PhD in physical chemistry under the supervision of Max Bodenstein at the University of Berlin. He emigrated to the United States in 1926, where he joined the faculty of Harvard University in 1930, and became a citizen in 1933.

During World War II, Kistiakowsky was the head of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) section responsible for the development of explosives, and the technical director of the Explosives Research Laboratory (ERL), where he oversaw the development of new explosives, including RDX and HMX. He was involved in research into the hydrodynamic theory of explosions, and the development of shaped charges. In October 1943, he was brought into the Manhattan Project as a consultant. He was soon placed in charge of X Division, which was responsible for the development of the explosive lenses necessary for an implosion-type nuclear weapon. In July 1945, he watched the first atomic explosion in the Trinity test. A few weeks later, another implosion-type weapon (Fat Man) was dropped on Nagasaki.

From 1962 to 1965, Kistiakowsky chaired the National Academy of Sciences&#x27;s Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP), and was its vice president from 1965 to 1973. He severed his connections with the government in protest against the war in Vietnam, and became active in an antiwar organization, the Council for a Livable World, becoming its chairman in 1977.

== Early life ==
George Bogdanovich Kistiakowsky was born in Boyarka, in the Kyiv Governorate of the Russian Empire (now part of Ukraine), on . George&#x27;s grandfather Aleksandr Fedorovych Kistiakovsky was a professor of law and an attorney of the Russian Empire who specialized in criminal law. His father Bogdan Kistiakovsky was a professor of legal philosophy at the University of Kyiv, and was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in 1919. Kistiakowsky&#x27;s mother was Maria Berendshtam, and he had a brother, Alexander who became an ornithologist. George&#x27;s uncle Ihor Kistiakovsky was the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Ukrainian State.

Kistiakowsky attended private schools in Kyiv and Moscow until the Russian Revolution broke out in 1917. He then joined the anti-Communist White Army. In 1920 he escaped from Russia in a commandeered French ship. After spending time in Turkey and Yugoslavia, he made his way to Germany, where he enrolled at the University of Berlin later that year. In 1925, he earned his PhD in physical chemistry under the supervision of Max Bodenstein, writing his thesis on the photochemical decomposition of chlorine monoxide and ozone. He then became Bodenstein&#x27;s graduate assistant. His first two published papers were elaborations of his thesis, co-written with Bodenstein.

In 1926, Kistiakowsky traveled to the United States as an International Education Board fellow. Hugh Stott Taylor, another student of Bodenstein, accepted Bodenstein&#x27;s assessment of Kistiakowsky, and gave him a place at Princeton University. That year, Kistiakowsky married a Swedish Lutheran woman, Hildegard Moebius. In 1928, they had a daughter, Vera, who, in 1972 became the first woman appointed as a professor of physics at MIT. When Kistiakowsky&#x27;s two-year fellowship ran out in 1927, he received a research associate and DuPont Fellowship. On October 25, 1928, he became an associate professor at Princeton. Taylor and Kistiakowsky published a series of papers together. Encouraged by Taylor, Kistiakowsky also published an American Chemical Society monograph on photochemical processes.

In 1930, Kistiakowsky joined the faculty of Harvard University, an affiliation that continued throughout his career. At Harvard, his research interests were in thermodynamics, spectroscopy, and chemical kinetics. He became increasingly involved in consulting for the government and industry. He became an associate professor again, this time at Harvard in 1933. That year he also became an American citizen and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1938, he became the Abbott and James Lawrence Professor of Chemistry. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences the following year. In 1940, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

== World War II ==

=== National Defense Research Committee ===

Foreseeing an expanded role for science in World War II, which the United States had not yet joined, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) on June 27, 1940, with Vannevar Bush as its chairman. James B. Conant, the President of Harvard, was appointed head of Division B, which was responsible for bombs, fuels, gases, and chemicals. He appointed Kistiakowsky to head its Section A-1, which was concerned with explosives. In June 1941, the NDRC was absorbed into the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). Bush became chairman of the OSRD, Conant succeeded him as chairman of the NDRC, and Kistiakowsky became head of Section B. In a reorganization in December 1942, Division B was broken up, and he became head of Division 8, which was responsible for explosives and propellants, remaining in this position until February 1944.

Kistiakowsky was unhappy with the state of American knowledge of explosives and propellants. Conant established the Explosives Research Laboratory (ERL) near the laboratories of the Bureau of Mines in Bruceton, Pennsylvania in October 1940, and Kistiakowsky initially supervised its activities, making occasional visits; but Conant did not formally appoint him as its technical director until the spring of 1941. Although initially hampered by a shortage of facilities, the ERL grew from five staff in 1941 to a wartime peak of 162 full-time laboratory staff in 1945. An important field of research was RDX. This powerful explosive had been developed by the Germans before the war. The challenge was to develop an industrial process that could produce it on a large scale. RDX was also mixed with TNT to produce Composition B, which was widely used in various munitions, and torpex, which was used in torpedoes and depth charges. Pilot plants were in operation by May 1942, and large-scale production followed in 1943.

In response to a special request for an explosive that could be smuggled through Japanese checkpoints by Chinese guerrillas, Kistakowsky mixed HMX, a non-toxic explosive produced as a by-product of the RDX process, with flour to create &quot;Aunt Jemima&quot;, after a brand of pancake flour. This was an edible explosive, which could pass for regular flour, and even be used in cooking.

In addition to research into synthetic explosives like RDX and HMX, the ERL investigated the properties of detonations and shock waves. This was initiated as a pure research project, without obvious or immediate applications. Kistiakowsky visited England in 1941 and again in 1942, where he met with British experts, including William Penney and Geoffrey Taylor. When Kistiakowsky and Edgar Bright Wilson, Jr., surveyed the existing state of knowledge, they found several areas that warranted further investigation. Kistiakowsky began to look into the Chapman–Jouguet model, which describes the way the shock wave created by a detonation propagates.

At this time, the efficacy of the Chapman–Jouguet model was still in doubt, and it was the subject of studies by John von Neumann at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study. Kistiakowsky realized that the deviations from hydrodynamic theory were the result of the speed of the chemical reactions themselves. To control the reaction, calculations down to the microsecond level were needed. Section 8 was drawn into the investigation of shaped charges, whose mechanism was explained by Taylor and James Tuck in 1943.

=== Manhattan Project ===
At the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Los Alamos Laboratory, research into implosion had been proceeding under Seth Neddermeyer, but his division had worked with cylinders and small charges, and had produced only objects that looked like rocks. Their research was accorded a low priority, owing to expectations that a gun-type nuclear weapon design would work for both uranium-235 and plutonium, and implosion technology would not be required.

In September 1943, the Los Alamos Laboratory&#x27;s director, Robert Oppenheimer, arranged for von Neumann to visit Los Alamos and investigate implosion with a fresh set of eyes. After reviewing Neddermeyer&#x27;s studies, and discussing the matter with Edward Teller, von Neumann suggested the use of high explosive in shaped charges to implode a sphere, which he showed could not only result in a faster assembly of fissile material than was possible with the gun method, but greatly reduce the amount of material required. The prospect of more efficient nuclear weapons impressed Oppenheimer, Teller and Hans Bethe, but they decided that an expert on explosives was required. Kistiakowsky&#x27;s name was immediately suggested, and he was brought into the project as a consultant in October 1943.
Kistiakowsky was initially reluctant to come, &quot;partly because&quot;, he later explained, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think the bomb would be ready in time and I was interested in helping to win the war&quot;. At Los Alamos, he began reorganizing the implosion effort. He introduced techniques such as photography and X-rays to study the behavior of shaped charges. The former had been extensively employed by the ERL, while the latter had been described in papers by Tuck, who also suggested using three-dimensional explosive lenses. As with other aspects of the Manhattan Project, research into explosive lenses followed multiple lines of inquiry simultaneously because, as Kistiakowsky noted, it was &quot;impossible to predict which of these basic techniques will be the more successful.&quot;

Kistiakowsky brought with him to Los Alamos a detailed knowledge of all the studies into shaped charges, of explosives like Composition B, and of the procedures used at the ERL in 1942 and 1943. Increasingly, the ERL itself would be drawn into the implosion effort; its deputy director Duncan MacDougall also took charge of the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Project Q. Kistiakowsky replaced Neddermeyer as head of E (for explosives) Division in February 1944.

The implosion program acquired a new urgency after Emilio Segrè&#x27;s group at Los Alamos verified that plutonium produced in the nuclear reactors contained plutonium-240, which made it unsuitable for use in a gun-type weapon. A series of crisis meetings in July 1944 concluded that the only prospect for a working plutonium weapon was implosion. In August, Oppenheimer reorganized the entire laboratory to concentrate on it. A new explosives group, X Division, was created under Kistiakowsky to develop the lenses.

Under Kistiakowsky&#x27;s leadership, X-Division designed the complex explosive lenses needed to compress the fissile plutonium pit. These employed two explosives with significantly different velocities of detonation in order to produce the required waveform. Kistiakowsky chose Baratol for the slow explosive. After experimenting with various fast explosives, X-Division settled on Composition B. Work on molding the explosives into the right shape continued into 1945. The lenses needed to be flawless, and techniques for casting Composition B and Baratol had to be developed. The ERL managed to accomplish this by devising a procedure for preparing Baratol in a form that was easy to cast. In March 1945, Kistiakowsky became part of the Cowpuncher Committee, so-called because it rode herd on the implosion effort. On July 16, 1945, Kistiakowsky watched as the first device was detonated in the Trinity test. A few weeks later, a Fat Man implosion-type nuclear weapon was dropped on Nagasaki.

Along with his work on implosion, Kistiakowsky contributed to skiing in Los Alamos by using rings of explosives to fell trees for a ski slope — leading to the establishment of Sawyer&#x27;s Hill Ski Tow Association. He divorced Hildegard in 1942 and married Irma E. Shuler in 1945. They were divorced in 1962, and he married Elaine Mahoney.

== White House service ==
In 1957, during the Eisenhower Administration, Kistiakowsky was appointed to the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee, and succeeded James R. Killian as chairman in 1959. He directed the Office of Science and Technology Policy from 1959 to 1961, when he was succeeded by Jerome B. Wiesner.
In 1958, Kistiakowsky suggested to President Eisenhower that inspection of foreign military facilities was not sufficient to control their nuclear weapons. He cited the difficulty in monitoring missile submarines, and proposed that the arms control strategy focus on disarmament rather than inspections. In January 1960, as part of arms control planning and negotiation, he suggested the &quot;threshold concept&quot;. Under this proposal, all nuclear tests above the level of seismic detection technology would be forbidden. After such an agreement, the US and USSR would work jointly to improve detection technology, revising the permissible test yield downward as techniques improved. This example of the &quot;national means of technical verification&quot;, a euphemism for sensitive intelligence collection used in arms control, would provide safeguards, without raising the on-site inspection requirement to a level unacceptable to the Soviets. The US introduced the threshold concept to the Soviets at the Geneva arms control conference in January 1960 and the Soviets, in March, responded favorably, suggesting a threshold of a given seismic magnitude. Talks broke down as a result of the U-2 Crisis of 1960 in May.

At the same time as the early nuclear arms control work, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Nathan F. Twining, sent a memorandum, in August 1959, to the Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, which suggested that the Strategic Air Command (SAC) formally be assigned responsibility to prepare the national nuclear target list, and a single plan for nuclear operations. Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. This had led to the same objectives being targeted multiple times by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting as in, for example, the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route of an Air Force bomber going to a deeper target. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagreed on the policy during early 1960. Thomas Gates, who succeeded McElroy, asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to decide the policy.

Eisenhower said he would not &quot;leave his successor with the monstrosity&quot; of the uncoordinated and un-integrated forces that then existed. In early November 1960, he sent Kistiakowsky to SAC Headquarters in Omaha to evaluate its war plans. Initially, Kistiakowsky was not given access, and Eisenhower sent him back, with a much stronger set of orders for SAC officers to cooperate. Kistiakowsky&#x27;s report, presented on November 29, described uncoordinated plans with huge numbers of targets, many of which would be attacked by multiple forces, resulting in overkill. Eisenhower was shocked by the plans, and focused not just on the creation of the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP), but on the entire process of picking targets, generating requirements, and planning for nuclear war operations.

== Later life ==
Between his work for the Manhattan Project and his White House service, and again after he left the White House, Kistiakowsky was a professor of physical chemistry at Harvard. When asked to teach a freshman class in 1957, he turned to Hubert Alyea, whose lecture style had impressed him. Alyea sent him some 700 index cards containing details of lecture demonstrations. Aside from the cards, Kistiakowsky never prepared the demonstrations. He later recalled: He retired from Harvard as professor emeritus in 1972.

From 1962 to 1965, Kistiakowsky chaired the National Academy of Science&#x27;s Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP), and was its vice president from 1965 to 1973. He received several awards over the years, including the Department of the Air Force Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service in 1957. He was awarded the Medal for Merit by President Truman, the Medal of Freedom by President Eisenhower in 1961, and the National Medal of Science by President Lyndon Johnson in 1967. He was also a recipient the Charles Lathrop Parsons Award for public service from the American Chemical Society in 1961, Priestley Medal from the American Chemical Society in 1972, and the Franklin Medal from Harvard.

 In later years, Kistiakowsky was active in an antiwar organization, the Council for a Livable World. He severed his connections with the government in protest against the US involvement in the Vietnam War. In 1977, he assumed the chairmanship of the council, campaigning against nuclear proliferation. He died of cancer in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on December 17, 1982. His body was cremated, and his ashes scattered near his summer home on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. His papers are in the Harvard University archives. He is also memorialized by a redwood grove in Montgomery Woods State Natural Reserve in California.

<text>Southeast Financial Center is a two-acre development in Miami, Florida, United States. It consists of a tall office skyscraper and its 15-story parking garage. It was previously known as the Southeast Financial Center (1984–1992), the First Union Financial Center (1992–2003) and the Wachovia Financial Center (2003–2011). In 2011, it retook its old name of Southeast Financial Center as Wachovia merged with Wells Fargo and moved to the nearby Wells Fargo Center.

When topped-off in August 1983, it was the tallest building south of New York City and east of the Mississippi River, taking away the same title from the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel, in Atlanta, Georgia. It remained the tallest building in the southeastern U.S. until 1987, when it was surpassed by One Atlantic Center in Atlanta and the tallest in Florida until October 1, 2003, when it was surpassed by the Four Seasons Hotel and Tower, also in Miami. It remains the tallest office tower in Florida and the fourth tallest building in Miami.

==Structure==
Southeast Financial Center was constructed in three years with more than 500 construction workers. Approximately 6,650 tons of structural steel, 80,000 cubic yards of concrete and 7000 cubic tons of reinforcing steel bars went into its construction. The complex sits on a series of reinforced concrete grade beams tied to 150 concrete caissons as much as ten feet in diameter and to a depth of 80 feet. A steel space-frame canopy with glass skylights covers the outdoor plaza between the tower and low-rise building.

The tower has a composite structure. The exterior columns and beams are concrete encased steel wide flanges surrounded by reinforcing bars. The composite exterior frame was formed using hydraulic steel forms, or &quot;flying forms,&quot; jacked into place with a &quot;kangaroo&quot; crane, that was located in the core and manually clamped into place. Wide flange beams topped by a metal deck and concrete form the interior floor framing. The core is A braced steel frame, designed to laterally resist wind loads. The construction of one typical floor was completed every five days.

The low-rise banking hall and parking building is a concrete-framed structure. Each floor consists of nearly an acre of continuously poured concrete. When the concrete had sufficiently hardened, compressed air was used to blow the forms fiberglass forms from under the completed floor. It was then rolled out to the exterior where it was raised by crane into position for the next floor.

The building was recognized as Miami&#x27;s first and only office building to be certified for the LEED Gold award in January 2010.

==History==
The center was developed by a partnership consisting of Gerald D. Hines Interests, Southeast Bank and Corporate Property Investors for $180 million. It was originally built as the headquarters for Southeast Bank, which originally occupied 50 percent of the complex&#x27;s space. It remained Southeast Bank&#x27;s headquarters there until it was liquidated in 1991.

The Southeast Financial Center comprises two buildings: the 55-story office tower and the 15-story parking annex. The tower has 53 stories of office space. The first floor is dedicated for retail, the second floor is the lobby and the 55th floor was home to the luxurious Miami City Club. The parking annex has 12 floors of parking space for 1,150 cars. The first floor is dedicated for retail, the second floor is a banking hall and the 15th floor has the Downtown Athletic Club. A landscaped plaza lies between the office tower and the parking annex. An enclosed walkway connects the second story of the tower with the second story of the annex. The courtyard is partially protected from the elements by a steel and glass space frame canopy spanning the plaza and attached to the tower and annex. The glass space frame canopy was removed between 2020 and 2021. Southeast Bank&#x27;s executive offices were located on the 38th floor. Ground was broken on the complex on December 12, 1981 and the official dedication and opening for the complex was held on October 23, 1984.

The Southeast Financial Center was designed by Edward Charles Bassett of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. The Associate Architect was Spillis Candela &amp; Partners. It has 1,145,311 ft2 (106,000 m2) of office space. A typical floor has about 22,000 ft2 (2,043.87 m2) of office space. Each floor has 9 ft x 9 ft (2.7 m x 2.7 m) floor to ceiling windows. (All of the building&#x27;s windows are tinted except for the top floor, resulting in strikingly bright and clear views from there.) The total complex has over 2.2 million ft2 (204,000 m2). The distinctive setbacks begin at the 43rd floor. Each typical floor plate has 9 corner offices and the top twelve floors have as many as 16. There are 43 elevators in the office tower. An emergency control station provides computerized monitoring for the entire complex, and four generators for backup power.

The Southeast Financial Center can be seen as far away as Ft. Lauderdale and halfway toward Bimini. Night space shuttle launches from Cape Canaveral 200 miles to the north were plainly visible from the higher floors. The roof of the building was featured in the Wesley Snipes motion picture &quot;Drop Zone,&quot; where an eccentric base jumper named Swoop parachutes down to the street from a suspended window cleaning trolley. The building also appeared in several episodes of the 1980s TV show &quot;Miami Vice&quot; and at the end of each episode&#x27;s opening credits.

Zara founder Amancio Ortega purchased the building from J.P. Morgan Asset Management in December 2016. The purchase price was reportedly over $500 million, making it one of the largest real estate transactions in South Florida history.

<doc id="1074787" wikidata="Q6621155" url="?curid=1074787" title="List of former Catholics">
<text>Former Catholics or ex-Catholics are people who used to be Catholic for some time, but no longer identify as such. This includes both individuals who were at least nominally raised in the Roman Catholic faith, and individuals who converted to it in later life, both of whom later rejected and left it, or converted to other faiths (including the related non-Roman Catholic faiths). This page lists well-known individuals in history who are former Catholics.

One 2008 Pew Research Center study estimates that 10.1% of people in the United States describe themselves as former Catholics in some sense. In total the study reports that 44% of Americans profess a different religious affiliation than the one they were raised in. A majority joined another Christian denomination while a substantial minority are counted as currently unaffiliated. A significant number of former Catholics join mainline Protestant denominations with a similar worship pattern, such as Lutheranism or Anglicanism, while others have become Evangelical Christians.

Note: The list includes those who leave the Catholic Church including any Eastern Catholic Church which is in communion with it. People such as Eddie Doherty, who were allowed to transfer from the Latin Catholic Church to an Eastern Catholic church, or &quot;vice versa&quot; are not considered as &quot;former Roman Catholics&quot;, while Eastern Catholics who convert to a non-Catholic church or another religion are considered as such, even though Eastern Catholics do not typically refer to themselves as &quot;Roman&quot;.

Most of the top Nazi leaders had already disaffiliated before the Nazi seizure of power, but even some of the lower ranking Nazi bureaucrats and representatives began disaffilating from the Catholic and Lutheran Churches over the course of the 1930s as a direct result the gradual worsening of relations with the churches, whom they accused of meddling in Germany&#x27;s political affairs. These people stressed they still believed in a creative power who guided the German nation and rejected atheism. However, the movement disappeared shortly after World War II, and was last referenced in Allied occupation documents in 1946.

===Debatable===
This section lists some who, while adopting ideas that some others would consider incompatible with the Catholic faith, may have defected from the Church neither by a formal act nor even informally by an act of heresy, schism or apostasy. Mere attendance at services of another religion or adoption of certain meditation techniques need not signify abandonment of one&#x27;s own religion. According to a 2009 survey of the Pew Research Center Forum on Religion and Public Life, one in five American Catholics report that they at times attend places of worship other than the local Catholic parish (which does not have to mean non-Catholic places). The same survey noted that some Catholics incorporate &quot;yoga as a spiritual practice&quot;, emphasize psychics, and draw on and involve themselves in other religious movements.

<text>Robert Serber (March 14, 1909 – June 1, 1997) was an American physicist who participated in the Manhattan Project. Serber&#x27;s lectures explaining the basic principles and goals of the project were printed and supplied to all incoming scientific staff, and became known as &quot;The Los Alamos Primer&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called him &quot;the intellectual midwife at the birth of the atomic bomb.&quot;

==Early life and education==
He was born in Philadelphia, the eldest son of Rose (Frankel) and David Serber. His family was Jewish. His mother died in 1922 and his father married her cousin Frances Leof in 1928. Robert Serber earned his BS in engineering physics from Lehigh University in 1930 and earned his PhD in physics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with John Van Vleck in 1934. He married Charlotte Leof (26 Jul 1911 – 1967), the daughter of his stepmother&#x27;s uncle, in 1933.

Shortly before receiving his doctorate, Serber was selected for a National Research Council postdoctoral fellowship and planned on conducting research at Princeton University with Eugene Wigner. However, after spontaneously enrolling at the University of Michigan&#x27;s physics summer school, he changed his plans and went to work with J. Robert Oppenheimer at the University of California, Berkeley. For the next four years, he shuttled with Oppenheimer between Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology, where Oppenheimer held a secondary faculty appointment. In 1938, he took one of the era&#x27;s few tenure-track professorships in physics at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, where he stayed until he was recruited for the Manhattan Project.

==Manhattan Project==

He was recruited for the Manhattan Project in 1941, and was in Project Alberta on the dropping of the bomb. When the Los Alamos National Laboratory was first organized, Oppenheimer decided not to compartmentalize the technical information among different departments. This boosted the technical workers&#x27; effectiveness in problem-solving and underscored the project&#x27;s urgency, as they now understood its significance. Consequently, Serber was tasked with delivering a series of lectures to explain the basic principles and objectives of the project. These lectures were printed and supplied to all incoming scientific staff, and became known as &quot;The Los Alamos Primer&quot;, LA-1. It was declassified in 1965. Serber developed the first good theory of bomb assembly hydrodynamics.
Serber&#x27;s wife Charlotte Serber was appointed by Oppenheimer to head the technical library at Los Alamos, where she was the only wartime female section leader.

Serber created the code-names for all three design projects, the &quot;Little Boy&quot; (uranium gun), &quot;Thin Man&quot; (plutonium gun), and &quot;Fat Man&quot; (plutonium implosion), according to his reminiscences (1998). The names were based on their design shapes; the &quot;Thin Man&quot; would be a very long device, and the name came from the Dashiell Hammett detective novel and series of movies of the same name; the &quot;Fat Man&quot; bomb would be round and fat and was named after Sydney Greenstreet&#x27;s character in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (from Hammett&#x27;s novel). &quot;Little Boy&quot; would come last and be named only to contrast to the &quot;Thin Man&quot; bomb. This differs from the unsupported, abandoned theory that &quot;Fat Man&quot; was named after Churchill and &quot;Thin Man&quot; after Roosevelt.

After receiving an identification card noting that his civilian noncombatant duties were commensurate in profile to the Army of the United States rank of colonel (an administrative designation only ostensibly valid if he were captured as a prisoner of war under the 1929 Geneva Convention, although he was frequently afforded salutations and other perquisites of the rank in practice by military personnel while traveling), Serber was to go on &quot;Big Stink&quot;, the camera plane for the Nagasaki mission, as a technical advisor; however, it left without him when group operations officer Major James I. Hopkins ordered him off the plane because he had forgotten his parachute, reportedly after the B-29 had already taxied onto the runway. Since Serber was the only crew member who knew how to operate the high-speed camera, Hopkins had to be instructed by radio from Tinian on its use. Serber was with the first American team to enter Hiroshima and Nagasaki to assess the results of the atomic bombing of the two cities.

==Post-war work and personal life==
Although Oppenheimer sought an appointment for Serber in the Berkeley physics department following the end of the war, this was soon forestalled, possibly because of the anti-Semitism of department chair Raymond Thayer Birge. Birge had previously refused to offer a tenure-track appointment to Serber after he received his University of Illinois offer, opining that &quot;one Jew in the department is enough.&quot; Oppenheimer prevailed in placing him as head of the theoretical division of the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory under Ernest Lawrence; however, as his mentor segued into policy consultancies and the presidency of the Institute for Advanced Study in 1947, Serber frequently took over his courses, ultimately resulting in his appointment to the Berkeley faculty.

In 1948, Serber had to defend himself against anonymous accusations of disloyalty, mostly because his wife Charlotte&#x27;s family were Jewish intellectuals with socialist leanings, and also because he tried to remove politics from discussions of the feasibility of the fusion bomb, leading to arguments with Edward Teller. There was some speculation that Serber was a member of the Communist Party. Oppenheimer said it was possible he was member, but did not know, whereas the FBI concluded that &quot;no definite evidence is known&quot; for his membership. Although he had been cleared of any potential wrongdoing at a subsequent hearing that year, he was denied a prerequisite security clearance for a Japanese physics conference in 1952, precipitating his refusal to join a Teller-chaired Department of Defense advisory group.

While he reluctantly signed the loyalty oath stipulated by the Levering Act for Berkeley personnel in 1950, growing antagonism between Oppenheimer and the more conservative Lawrence eventually spurred his departure. In 1951, he became a professor of physics at Columbia University at the behest of Manhattan Project colleague I. I. Rabi. He served as chair of the department from 1975 until his retirement as professor emeritus in 1978.

At Columbia, Serber served as doctoral advisor to future Nobelist Leon Cooper. He also collaborated with Abraham Pais on meson studies and developed the Serber-Dancoff method, a refined technique for analyzing strong coupling. He also consulted numerous labs, businesses, and commissions, including Brookhaven National Laboratory (where he worked one day a week during the academic year and occasional summers for twenty years) and Fermilab, as a specialist in the proton–proton chain reaction and the focusing properties of particle accelerators. Although largely bereft of any ideology, he refused to join the Defense Department-affiliated JASON consulting group because of his previous clearance issues and opposition to the Vietnam War.

After being diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Charlotte Serber suffered from depression and took her own life with an overdose of sleeping pills on May 22, 1967. Serber then entered a relationship with Kitty Oppenheimer, who had been widowed in February 1967. She talked him into buying a yawl, which they sailed from New York to Grenada. In 1972, they purchased a ketch, with the intention of sailing through the Panama Canal and to Japan via the Galapagos Islands and Tahiti during Serber&#x27;s sabbatical. They set out, but Kitty became ill, and was taken to Gorgas Hospital, where she died of an embolism on October 27, 1972. Serber and Toni Oppenheimer scattered her cremains near the Oppenheimers&#x27; longtime vacation home in Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands, which he continued to use.

Following his retirement, he married Fiona St. Clair, a fabric designer from Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, in 1979. He adopted her son Zachariah, and they had another son, William, in November 1980.

He served as president of the American Physical Society in 1971. A year later, Serber was awarded the J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize.

Serber appears in the Oscar-nominated documentary &quot;The Day After Trinity&quot; (1980).

Serber died June 1, 1997, at his home in Manhattan from complications of surgery for brain cancer.

== In popular culture ==
He was portrayed by Michael Angarano in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s 2023 film &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;.

<doc id="1074805" wikidata="Q3335210" url="?curid=1074805" title="Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador">
<text>Nain (Inuit language: &quot;Nunainguk&quot;) is the northernmost permanent settlement in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, within the Nunatsiavut region, located about by air from Happy Valley-Goose Bay. The town was established as a Moravian mission in 1771 by Jens Haven and other missionaries. As of 2021, the population is 1,204 mostly Inuit and mixed Inuit-European. Nain is the administrative capital of the autonomous region of Nunatsiavut.

Nain is inaccessible by road and may be reached only by air or sea.

== History ==
Nain was first established in 1771 by Moravian missionaries. It is among the oldest permanent Inuit settlements in Canada, most communities in Nunavut and Nunavik were settled in the 1950s or later. It is also the oldest continuously-inhabited community in Labrador after North West River. Nain has also been called &quot;Nonynuke&quot;, &quot;Nuninock&quot; and &quot;Nunaingoakh&quot;. The missionaries also established posts in Hopedale and areas in the north such as Hebron and Okak. The first Inuk to be baptized in Nain was a man named Kingminguse who took the name &quot;Petrus&quot; after conversion and then returned to southern Labrador where he used the name &quot;Petrus Kingminguse&quot; and died in 1800. Many Inuit in the south traveled to the Moravian posts in the north to be baptized and then returned to the south. The Moravians established posts only in northern areas since the Colony of Newfoundland hoped to colonize southern Labrador. In 1773, it was claimed that over 250 Inuit lived in Nain. In 1893, Nain&#x27;s residents adopted patrilineal surnames at the request of Newfoundland courts. Many people took names of the missionaries (such as &quot;Kohlmeister&quot; and Townley&quot;) while others chose traditional names such as &quot;Agnatok&quot;, &quot;Kalleo&quot;, &quot;Karpik&quot;, &quot;Merkuratsuk&quot;, &quot;Pamak&quot; and &quot;Saksagiak&quot; or other European names such as &quot;Abel&quot; and &quot;Obed&quot;. During the 19th-century, many people from southern parts of Labrador (mostly of mixed European and Inuit descent) and also from England and Newfoundland settled on islands near Nain and introduced names to the area such as &quot;Ford&quot;, &quot;Lyall&quot;, &quot;Flowers&quot;, &quot;Dicker&quot; and &quot;Webb&quot;. Most of these island settlements were resettled in the 1950s and 1960s and their inhabitants mostly settled in Nain. 6 Innu (Naskapi) families were recorded in Nain in 1945.

In 1959, residents of Hebron and Nutak resettled to Nain, Hopedale, Makkovik and Happy Valley-Goose Bay. The relocation had a huge impact on residents of Hebron and Nutak since the land in Nain (and other communities) was very different (resulting in difficulties when hunting) and many families were divided. Poverty and alcoholism has affected many of the families that originated in Hebron and Nutak. The provincial government apologized for the relocations in 2005. Many Inuit from Hebron were relocated to Nain by the provincial government after the Moravian mission at Hebron was closed under government pressure in 1959.

In 2016, the Google Street View imaging service uploaded images of various roads in Nain. Nain is one of the few communities in Labrador with images on the service.

===Nunatsiavut===
On December 1, 2005, Nain became the administrative capital of the autonomous region of Nunatsiavut which is the name chosen by the Labrador Inuit when the &quot;Labrador Inuit Land Claims Agreement Act&quot; was successfully ratified by the Canadian Government and the Inuit of Labrador. Hopedale, further south, is the legislative capital. The land claim cedes limited self-rule for the Nunatsiavut government in Northern Labrador and North-Eastern Quebec, granting title and aboriginal rights. The land that comprises the Nunatsiavut government is called the Labrador Inuit Settlement Area, or LISA, which amount to approximately . The Inuit of Labrador do not own this land per se, but they do have special rights related to traditional land use as aboriginals. That said, the Labrador Inuit will own within the Settlement Area, officially designated as Labrador Inuit Lands. The Agreement also provides for the establishment of the Torngat Mountains National Park Reserve, consisting of about of land within LISA.

== Geography ==
Nain is located on the north side of Unity Bay, a small inlet. The bay is open to the Atlantic Ocean but Nain&#x27;s harbour is protected by numerous islands, the largest of which is Paul&#x27;s Island. From Nain to the open Labrador Sea is approximately east through Strathcona Run.

===Climate===
Although located at the same latitude as Ketchikan on North America&#x27;s west coast, or Moscow and southern Scandinavia in Europe, the influence of the Labrador Current gives Nain a marginal subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;) that is very close to a polar climate (&quot;ET&quot;), which creates the southernmost tree line in the northern hemisphere on the adjacent coast. The southernmost tundra is actually still in a zone of discontinuous permafrost rather than the much more typical continuous zone. The almost constant presence of the Icelandic Low means that precipitation, both as rain and snow, is exceptionally heavy for so consistently cold a climate in a low-lying area, with of snow the average annual amount. The actual depth of snow on the ground averages at the end of March. Occasionally, very warm weather occurs in summer when winds blow offshore. 


==Local government==


The town is governed by a seven-member council composed of a mayor (or Angajukĸâk), deputy mayor (Deputy Angajukĸâk), and five councilors.

The Town Council formally changed its name from &quot;Nain Town Council&quot; to &quot;Nain Inuit Community Government&quot; in October 2006. The Nain Inuit Community Government meets once per month.

==Educational facilities==
Nain has one kindergarten to level III school, Jens Haven Memorial, which is split between two buildings. One building contains primary grades (kindergarten to grade 3), the other houses elementary and secondary grades (grade 4 to Level III).

There is also an adult basic education (ABE) program offered in town, delivered by Academy Canada. Academy Canada delivers this program in Nain and throughout Labrador in communities including Happy Valley - Goose Bay, Hopedale, Labrador City, Natuashish and Sheshatshiu.

==Industry==
Fishing is the main industry in Nain. Traditional hunting and trapping activities continue through the winter months after the fishing season has ended.

The Voisey&#x27;s Bay nickel mine is located about southwest of Nain.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Nain had a revised population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Media==
Nain has two radio services available.

CKOK-FM is a low-power (LP) re-broadcaster of CKHV broadcasting at 99.9 FM. Owned by the Okalakatiget Society, the station broadcasts a community radio format for the region&#x27;s First Nations and Inuit communities.

As of the end of 2014, the station now streams online. It broadcasts live during local programming only.

There is also a local re-broadcaster of Happy Valley-Goose Bay&#x27;s CBC Radio One feed, CBNZ. It operates on 740 AM.

== Transport ==
Flights to Nain are at Nain Airport, and are available from Happy Valley-Goose Bay on Air Borealis (part of PAL Airlines).

Between mid-June and mid-November (pending ice conditions), the ferry MV Kamutik W, operated by the Newfoundland and Labrador Government, provides weekly service from Goose Bay along the Atlantic Coast, with stops in Rigolet, Makkovik, Postville, Hopedale and Natuashish. Nain is the northernmost stop on the route; the ferry stays docked at Nain for about three hours before beginning its southbound route.

<text>Friedrich &quot;Fritz&quot; Karl Otto Wunderlich (26 September 1930 – 17 September 1966) was a German lyric tenor, famed for his singing of the Mozart repertory and various lieder. He died in an accident aged 35.

==Biography==
Wunderlich was born in Kusel in the Palatinate, Germany. His mother was a violinist and his father was a choirmaster. For a short time, the family kept the inn &quot;Emrichs Bräustübl&quot; (Emrich&#x27;s Brewing Cottage). Fritz&#x27;s father lost his job due to pressure imposed upon him by local Nazis, in addition to suffering from a severe battlefield injury. He died by suicide when Fritz was five years old.

Fritz mastered several instruments while still a schoolboy and when he entered the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg in 1950, his principal study was the horn. Then the singing teacher discovered and trained his voice.

Wunderlich was soon noted as a brilliant young tenor, especially in Mozartian roles, but he later expanded his reach to the full range of the lyric tenor repertoire.

He occasionally sang and recorded minor Wagner roles such as the steersman in &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot;, Walther von der Vogelweide in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, and the shepherd in &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;. He sang and recorded the role of the Italian Tenor in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;.

==Recordings==
It was the fashion during Wunderlich&#x27;s career for many German theatres to perform operas in the local rather than original language. Therefore, most of his recordings of the Italian operatic repertoire are sung in German, including Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot; and Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;. (He sang his recording of the Verdi &quot;Requiem&quot; in distinctly Germanic Latin.) Wunderlich achieved the highest distinction within the German repertory. Of special importance is the 1964 recording of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, conducted by Karl Böhm, in which Wunderlich gave a critically acclaimed performance as Tamino, opposite sopranos Evelyn Lear as Pamina and Roberta Peters as the Queen of the Night and baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in the role of Papageno. There is also a live performance of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; recorded in 1960 at the Salzburg Festival, and several recordings as Belmonte in &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;. Recordings also exist of lesser-known Mozart operas such as &quot;Zaide&quot; and &quot;La finta giardiniera&quot;

Wunderlich&#x27;s crystal-clear voice, exquisitely precise diction, and intelligent but passionate interpretation also led him to impressive renditions of the lieder cycles of Schubert and Schumann with pianist Hubert Giesen, who was also his artistic mentor. His famous recording of Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Dichterliebe&quot; remains a gold standard of this genre. Many tenors since have emulated Wunderlich&#x27;s interpretation of this cycle.

Another notable recording he left is J. S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot;, with fellow singers Gundula Janowitz, Christa Ludwig, and Franz Crass, conducted by Karl Richter. Also he is the tenor on Herbert von Karajan&#x27;s recording of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot;, with Gundula Janowitz, Christa Ludwig, and Walter Berry. He recorded an album of pre-Bach sacred songs, featuring music of Schütz, Telemann, Buxtehude, and other less well-known composers. With Christa Ludwig he recorded Gustav Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Otto Klemperer.

At the time of his death, he had been recording Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Creation&quot;, with the Berlin Philharmonic and the Wiener Singverein under Herbert von Karajan with other soloists Christa Ludwig, Gundula Janowitz, Walter Berry and Fischer-Dieskau. Wunderlich had completed recording his arias, but Werner Krenn was hired to record the recitatives. Several recorded live performances of Wunderlich singing the whole part, under Karajan, survive.

Numerous anthology albums of him singing arias from opera and operetta are available.

Available videos include a full-length performance (in German) as Count Almaviva in &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; (with Hermann Prey, Erika Köth and Hans Hotter), and a recital of operatic arias.

==Death==

Wunderlich sang at the 1966 Salzburg Festival, but two weeks later his career was cut short by an accident while he was on a hunting holiday. He fell from a stairway in a country house owned by bass Gottlob Frick in Oberderdingen near Maulbronn after tripping on a loose shoelace, fracturing his skull. He died at the University Clinic of Heidelberg just nine days short of his 36th birthday and a few weeks before his scheduled debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City as Don Ottavio in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. 

Wunderlich is buried in Munich&#x27;s Waldfriedhof cemetery.

<doc id="1074836" wikidata="Q1221534" url="?curid=1074836" title="Sherston, Wiltshire">
<text>Sherston is a village and civil parish about west of Malmesbury in Wiltshire, England. The parish is bounded to the north by the county boundary with Gloucestershire, and to the southeast by the Fosse Way, a Roman road. The parish includes the hamlets of Easton Town, immediately east of Sherston; Pinkney, further east along the Malmesbury road; and Willesley, to the north.

The infant River Avon passes Sherston, Easton Town and Pinkney, on its way to Malmesbury. The parish lies within the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

==History==
The Fosse Way, a major Roman road, passes nearby and forms the southeastern boundary of the modern parish. A Romano-British farmhouse from around 350 was discovered at Vancelettes Farm, north of Sherston village. The earliest surviving record of Sherston, then called &quot;Scorranstone&quot;, is an Anglo-Saxon document of 896.

In 1016, a battle between Cnut the Great and a West Saxon army led by King Edmund Ironside on the hills around Sherston may have involved a local hero known as Rattlebone; his name is celebrated in a local pub, The Rattlebone Inn. The parish church was built or rebuilt in the 12th century, and at some point a borough was laid out south of the church, with a broad market place where a weekly market was held from 1241 or earlier.

In 1511 a fire destroyed most of the buildings. Later in that century Sherston had two inns, the Swan and the Angel; there was much rebuilding in the 17th century. Industry came to the village in 1872 when a silk mill was opened by Joseph Davenport and Sons, weaving silks and ribbons, and later cotton; the mill closed in 1922. For a while after the Second World War, the Plant Engineering Co of Birmingham had a factory in the former silk mill.

Most of Sherston village was designated as a Conservation Area in 1973.

Sherston Software, makers of educational games, was established in 1984 and continued in business in the village until 2015.

Pinkney was also called Sherston Parva, meaning Little Sherston. The Ordnance Survey map from the 1890s has &quot;Great Sherston&quot; and &quot;Sherston Parva or Pinkney&quot;; by 1951 Great Sherston had become Sherston but both names were still shown for the smaller place.

=== Landowners ===
The Estcourt family of Pinkney were influential at Malmesbury in the 17th century, for a time holding the post of high steward of the borough. Notable members included Sir Thomas Estcourt (died 1683), and his son Sir Thomas Estcourt (died 1702). The latter&#x27;s son, also Thomas, died in 1704 and the estate passed to his sister Elizabeth, who in 1709 married Richard Creswell (1688–1743), from a family of Shropshire landowners: she brought to the marriage the manors of Sherston, Malmesbury and Norton. Their son Thomas Estcourt Cresswell (1712–1788), seated at Pinkney Park, was returned to parliament for Wootton Bassett; there is a monument to him in the parish church.

==Governance==
The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council, a unitary authority, which performs most significant local government functions.

An electoral ward with the same name exists, consisting of the parishes of Luckington, Sherston, Sopworth, Easton Grey, Norton, St Paul Malmesbury Without, and Brokenborough. The population of the ward at the 2011 census was 4,822.

== Religious sites ==
The Church of England parish church, the Grade I listed Church of the Holy Cross, dates from the 12th century and has a high tower which was rebuilt in 1733. Nikolaus Pevsner called the church &quot;impressive&quot; in his &quot;Buildings of England&quot; volume.

A Congregational church was licensed at Cliff Road in 1825. It remained in use until c. 2013 and was sold for residential use. A Primitive Methodist chapel was opened at Grove Lane in 1851, and became Sherston Methodist Church in 1932 after the union of the Primitive Methodists with the Wesleyan Methodists. The church is still in use.

== Notable buildings ==

Sherston village has two groups of Grade II* listed buildings. On the High Street, Old Swan House and numbers 19 and 21 comprise the former Swan Inn, from the late 16th century. Court House in Court Street and the adjoining houses at 1 and 3 Cliff Road were rebuilt c. 1680; for a time part of the ground floor of Court House served as the village shop.

Other listed buildings on the High Street include the former Angel Hotel, which has a 16th-century core and a twin-gabled addition of 1648.

At Pinkney, the large 19th-century Pinkney Park has been demolished, although still standing are the 17th-century granary and 1791 coach house. Further north, Pinkney Court is a farmhouse of c.1600 which was remodelled for Sir Thomas Estcourt around 1680; it has a five-bay front and is described by Julian Orbach (updating Pevsner) as &quot;a lovely group with its outbuildings&quot;.

In the north of the parish, Willesley House is probably a medieval hall, rebuilt in 1583 and re-fronted in the late 17th century or early 18th.

== Schools ==
Members of the Congregational chapel built a British School Room at Cliff Road in 1844. Its pupils were transferred to the National School in 1895 and the building has served various community purposes; in 2015 it was a meeting room and club room.

A National School was opened near the Rattlebone Inn in 1846. It became a Church of England school and was extended in 1895. Children of all ages were educated until 1954 when it became a junior school. Growth in pupil numbers led to the building of a new school on the outskirts of the village, which was opened in 2005. The old school was bought by the parish council in 2011 and is home to shops and businesses, including the Post Office Stores.

== Amenities ==
Every year, on the Saturday closest to 14 July, a carnival is held. The main attraction is a boules tournament and a music evening with local bands.

Sherston has a football team, a cricket team and a Scout troop. The village has a shop and post office, a hotel/cafe (the &quot;Angel Cafe&quot;), another cafe (&quot;Lucy Toms&quot;), one pub: the &quot;Rattlebone Inn&quot; and an Indian Restaurant called &quot;The Bridge&quot; on the site of the old &quot;Carpenters Arms&quot;. Another pub, the &quot;Holford Arms&quot;, is in the extreme northwest of the parish at Knockdown, Gloucestershire.

== Notable people ==
George Strong (1833–1888), an agricultural worker who was awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery during the Crimean War, settled in Sherston after the war and is buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard.

In the 1970s and 1980s Sherston was the home of eccentric socialite Lady Edith Foxwell, and her friend the soul singer Marvin Gaye was a frequent visitor. Until his death in 2002, the actor John Thaw lived nearby with his wife, the actress Sheila Hancock.

<text>Joan Saura i Laporta is a Spanish former politician in Catalonia for Initiative for Catalonia Greens (ICV). He was born in Barcelona, Catalonia, in 1950. He studied at the Escola d&#x27;Enginyeria Tècnica (Technical Engineering School), where he specialized in Industrial Chemistry. In the beginning, he was devoted to the trade union and the neighbourhood: he enrolled into the Workers&#x27; Commissions (CCOO) in 1973, while he was working for the electrics company FECSA, and cofounded the &quot;La Florida Neighbourhood Association&quot;, in L&#x27;Hospitalet de Llobregat, 1974.

==Municipal policy==

He became town councillor in L&#x27;Hospitalet de Llobregat for the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC) in the first democratic local elections in 1979, where he participated in the formation of the government, and remained a councillor until 1991.

He also chaired (from 1983 to 1987) the Public Transport commission in Barcelona.

==Parliament of Catalonia==
He was elected for the third and fourth Legislatures (1988 to 1995) as deputy for Barcelona in the Catalan Parliament for the Iniciativa per Catalunya Verds (ICV) party. He was the spokesperson of his party&#x27;s group and became its president in 1993.

In this Parliament he has held several positions, including membership in the Economy, Finances and Budget commission, in the Industry commission, Territorial Politics as well as various others.

==Congress of the Deputies==
On 3 March 1996 he was elected to the Spanish Congress of Deputies representing Barcelona Province and was re-elected at the subsequent election on 12 March 2000, where he was involved in several Parliamentary Commissions (such as Environment and Defense).

As a deputy, Joan Saura promoted several initiatives, such as a rise in the minimum wage, a fight against workplace abuses by employers, same-sex marriage and the Tobin tax. Additionally, he was strongly opposed to other ones: the Plan Hidrológico Nacional (PHN), the reform of the labour market law, the quality in teaching law, the political parties&#x27; law, the tax reform, the Prestige affair and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

==President of ICV==
Within ICV, he served as vice-president from 1993 as well as the head of political relations with Spain.

At the 6th Assembly of the party in November 2000, he was elected as ICV President. In June 2002 the party formed an electoral pact with United Left, and Els Verds-Esquerra Ecologista.

==A Generalitat candidate==
On 25 May 2002 he was chosen as the candidate for the presidency of the Generalitat de Catalunya by the ICV-EUiA coalition. For that reason, he set up in 2002 a Participative Process and the &quot;What do you think?&quot; campaign, to define the axis of the party&#x27;s program based on civil participation.

In the elections of 2003, his party won 9 seats in the Catalan Parliament and he, after few months of negotiation, became Minister of Institutional Relations and Participation.

<text>Brighton is a small seaside town in Otago and within the city limits of Dunedin in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It is located 20 kilometres southwest from the city centre on the Southern Scenic Route.

==History==
The area around modern Brighton was not the site of permanent settlement by pre-colonial Māori, but was on their regular trails from their homes on Otago Peninsula to their traditional hunting grounds. Archaeological evidence suggests that the area around Brighton was the site of seal and sea lion hunting, as well as hunting of moa. Stone tool making may have also taken place around the area.

European settlement began in the 1860s. The town was named by an early resident, Hugh Williams, after Brighton in England. Early industries included coal mining, with lignite being plentiful at nearby Ocean View. The town was also a service town for the local farming community. During the early 20th century, the town was a popular resort for people from nearby Dunedin, with several guest houses. With increased motorised transport, the town became a commuter settlement and day-trip destination after World War II.

==Geography==
Brighton is connected by coastal road with the Dunedin commuter settlement of Waldronville to the northeast (and from there to Dunedin itself) and with Taieri Mouth to the southwest. The settlement of Ocean View lies immediately to the east of Brighton, separated from it by a large bluff (simply known as &quot;Big Rock&quot;) which juts towards the ocean to the northeast of Brighton Beach. The coast road winds around this headland on its entry to Brighton from Dunedin. 

The town faces a small bay which includes a broad sheltered beach, Brighton Beach, and other beaches extend from here, north and east to Waldronville Lagoon and south and west to Taieri Mouth. They make the area popular for summer day trips from Dunedin. At the southern end of Brighton Beach is the mouth of the Otokia Creek, a small stream which has its sources to the southwest in the coastal hills which separate the coast from the Taieri Plains. A small reserve and walkway links the town&#x27;s main road with the mouth of the Otokia Creek. The reserve contains abundant birdlife, including oystercatchers and spoonbills.

<doc id="1074849" wikidata="Q7582086" url="?curid=1074849" title="Squared-circle postmark">
<text>A squared-circle postmark is a type of postmark that surrounds the circle of town and date with a set of concentric arcs forming a square outline.

They were introduced in the United Kingdom in late 1879 as an alternative to the duplex cancels, which were somewhat larger and more cumbersome to use. The additional arcs constituted the &quot;killer&quot; that marked the stamp as having been used. They declined in use from the 1910s, when new types of cancelling devices became available, and disappeared by the 1930s.

Three major types were used:
* Type 1, the first used, has three arcs between the circle and outer corner triangle
* Type 2 has two arcs, and heavier corner triangles
* Type 3 has one arc

In all cases, the name of the town or village was curved along the inside top of the inner circle, with a time of day (plaintext or coded, using several systems), and date underneath.

The squared circles came to be used in hundreds of towns in England and Wales (though not Scotland or Ireland), resulting in a total of about 4,000 distinct types. They were also used in a number of colonies of the British Empire. Similar postmarks were also used in Italy at around the same period.

Today some postal authorities still use this type or similar markings:

* Hongkong Post, a former British colonial, continues to use this marking. 
* Canada Post used this mark and continues to use it for first day cover cancellations.

<doc id="1074851" wikidata="Q4468552" url="?curid=1074851" title="Easton Grey">
<text>Easton Grey is a small village and civil parish in north Wiltshire, England, on the county boundary with Gloucestershire. The village lies just south of the B4040 road between Malmesbury and Sherston, about west of Malmesbury. The Church of England parish church has a 15th-century tower and was rebuilt in 1836.

== Geography ==
The Sherston branch of the upper Bristol Avon crosses the parish from west to east. The parish is within the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

==History==
The Fosse Way Roman road forms the eastern boundary of the parish. Near where the Fosse Way crosses the river is the site of a large Romano-British roadside settlement, possibly with earlier origins; it includes a square earthwork enclosure within Whitewalls Wood.

The Domesday survey of 1086 recorded a small settlement called &quot;Estone&quot; with nine households and a mill. The later addition of the &#x27;Grey&#x27; suffix may arise from a grant of the manor to John de Grey, Lord Wilton (d.1323).

The &quot;National Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; (1868) describes the village as small, and mentions an almshouse for six elderly women. The population of the parish peaked at over 600 around the middle of the 19th century but had declined to 326 by the 1901 census. The 20th century saw little change until numbers began to rise gradually in the 1980s, reaching 382 at the 2011 census.

The village has a 16th-century bridge over the Avon.

== Parish church ==

The small parish church, which has no dedication, stands above the village near the Malmesbury-Sherston road. Its 15th-century roughcast west tower is described as humble by Pevsner; the rest is a rebuilding of 1836 to designs of William James, a Gloucestershire architect. In rubble stone with ashlar buttresses and stone slate roofs, the church has a nave, chancel and south porch; inside there is ribbed Gothic vaulting to the nave and chancel. The 1836 work was instigated by the vicar, William S. Birch, who also oversaw the building of a village school and (around 1830) a new vicarage. Most of the windows of the church were reworked later in the 19th century.

The font – a shallow bowl on a cylindrical pillar – is 13th-century. The pulpit is 17th-century, and there are wall monuments from 1680 and later in the chancel. The Gothic organ is from the early 19th century, while the box pews in the nave are from 1836. The three bells in the tower are said to be unringable; one is dated c.1399 and the others 1684.

The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1959. Just outside the porch, a 1731 limestone chest tomb of the Adye family is in Rococo style with elaborate carving, and is Grade II* listed for its exceptional quality.

The benefice was united with Sherston in 1954, and consequently the vicarage at Easton Grey was sold. Today the parish is part of the Gauzebrook group of churches which is centred on Holy Cross Church, Sherston.

== Easton Grey House ==

The country house known as Easton Grey House stands west of the church, overlooking the river and the village. Built after 1792 for Walter Hodges, the two-storey house has a five-bay south-east front, its central bay brought slightly forward under a broad pediment bearing the Parry-Hodges arms. The north-east front has a large semicircular porch on columns, built in the early 19th century, and attached to the north is a three-storey block of c.1880. Inside are fine chimney-pieces and a stone staircase with wrought iron railings.

By the 1880s the house was owned by Thomas Graham Smith, who in 1879 married Katherine Lucy Tennant (1860–1942, known as Lucy). She was a daughter of the wealthy industrialist Sir Charles Tennant, and a member – alongside three of her sisters – of the social circle known as The Souls; thus the house became one of the group&#x27;s retreats. Lucy&#x27;s sister Margot married H. H. Asquith in 1894, and the house was a favourite resort of her husband during his 1908–1916 premiership. One source states that the house is currently owned by Michael Green, co-founder of media company Carlton Communications, who retrained as a psychotherapist.

Gardens were made to the west of the house in the late 18th century, with an ornamental gateway, a loggia and a walled kitchen garden. These features were rearranged c.1880 when formal garden areas were added. The north lodge, single-storey with tall chimneys, is described as &quot;very Victorian&quot; by Orbach.

== Other landmarks ==
On an elevated site in the village, Ruckley House is a two-storey 17th-century farmhouse which was extended in the 18th and early 20th centuries, and in 1953. A range of outbuildings includes a large barn which is probably also 17th-century.

In the east of the parish, on the Malmesbury road, is the site of Easton Grey Camp or 89 Working Camp, which held Italian prisoners-of-war during the Second World War, and German prisoners from 1945 to 1948. The site had a standard design, with rows of narrow wooden huts (some of them still standing) and redbrick buildings including a water tower; prisoners were required to work, mostly in local agriculture. Today the site is in mixed light industrial use and is also home to a pre-school and after-school childcare business.

Just beyond the eastern boundary of the parish, Whatley Manor – originally a farmhouse, greatly enlarged in the 1920s and 2001–3 – is operated as a hotel and Michelin-starred restaurant.

==Local government==
The parish is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which performs all significant local government functions. Owing to its small population, there is no parish council; instead the first tier of local government is a parish meeting.

<text>The World Organisation Against Torture (&quot;Organisation Mondiale Contre la Torture&quot;; OMCT) is the world&#x27;s largest coalition of non-governmental organisations fighting against arbitrary detention, torture, summary and extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances and other forms of violence. With more than 200 affiliated organisations in its SOS-Torture Network, the OMCT aims at accompanying, reinforcing and protecting anti-torture organisations in particular in erosive environments and provides a comprehensive system of support and protection for human rights defenders around the world. The global network consists of local, national and regional organisations, which share the goal of eradicating torture and fostering respect of human rights for all.

The OMCT&#x27;s &quot;Prevention of Torture&quot; programme helps its members prevent and report torture by strengthening their capacity through the SOS-Torture network to use United Nations human rights mechanisms. The programme submits alternative reports to UN Committees in collaboration with local NGOs, provides support for individuals and organisations wishing to challenge torture practices in international legal fora and publishes a practical guide on international and regional conventional mechanisms relevant to torture. OMCT is also mainstreaming women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s issues into the UN human rights mechanisms.

On 4 October 2007, former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan became the new president of the OMCT Supporting Foundation.

Gerald Staberock has been Secretary General of the OMCT since 2011, and presently also serves as the Chair of the Board of the EU Human Rights Defenders Mechanism.

==Activities==
The OMCT contributes to UN activities through three main activities.

===Reporting===
The OMCT submits alternative reports to the UN Committee Against Torture (CAT), the Human Rights Committee (HRC) and the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC), working with local NGOs. 
Reporting activities are designed to encourage national NGOs to report torture and follow up reports of torture through:
*the participation of local NGOs in drafting alternative reports and actively including them in relevant Committees&#x27; sessions, with the possibility of a follow-up meeting in the field;
*an integrated approach to questions relating to protection from torture and other ill-treatment of women and children, by involving organisations specialised in these issues in drafting alternative reports and in relevant Committees&#x27; sessions;
*greater dissemination of reports and of the Conclusions and Recommendations of the Committees in English and in the preferred language of the relevant country, through the publication of the reports that have been submitted.

===Legal support===
The OMCT supports individuals and organisations wishing to challenge torture practices in international legal forums. Complaint mechanisms can be used to achieve a number of different objectives including: 
*protection for victims or persons under threat; 
*obtaining reparations and compensation for victims; 
*putting pressure on governments to end impunity in specific cases; and 
*achieving changes in legislation and State practice which lead to serious human rights violations. 
Many NGOs are not fully aware of how to use UN procedures to support their work in protecting victims from torture. The OMCT hopes to encourage and assist partner NGOs that are already active in the struggle against torture to present individual complaints and other relevant information to the CAT, the HRC, and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).

===Practical guidance===
The OMCT publishes a practical guide on international and regional conventional mechanisms relevant to torture. This Handbook is conceived as a tool for action. It addresses the practical needs of anybody using international mechanisms and bodies to challenge torture practices.

<doc id="1074856" wikidata="Q2259062" url="?curid=1074856" title="Easton Royal">
<text>Easton Royal is a village in the civil parish of Easton in Wiltshire, England, about east of Pewsey and south of Marlborough. The village was the location of Easton Priory from 1234 to 1536. The village mistakenly gained the Royal suffix in 1838 and the name Easton Royal has been in general use since the 1850s.

The parish is on the northeastern edge of Salisbury Plain, and near the eastern end of the Vale of Pewsey.

== History ==
Easton Hill, in the south of the parish, carries prehistoric sites including a bowl barrow and a disc barrow.

The village stands on or near the likely route of the Roman road between Mildenhall and Old Sarum. From the 13th century the village was on the Marlborough-Salisbury road, until the 17th century when the road took a more eastward course through Burbage. Easton Priory, begun in 1234, was built next to the road in order to aid travellers.

By 1833 the village had a small National School, which was replaced by a new building in 1874. A large hall was added to the school in 2005.

In 1836 the vicar of Great Bedwyn mistakenly described Easton&#x27;s benefice as royal; in the 1850s the village began to be called Easton Royal, and this name came into common usage. The name of the parish remains Easton.

The population of the parish peaked in the mid 19th century, with 532 recorded at the 1841 census. By 1881 the population had declined to 323, and there was a further slow decline until the number stabilised around 250 by the middle of the 20th century.

== Religious sites ==
=== Early churches ===
Although Easton was not recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, one of the two churches of the king&#x27;s large estate at Wootton may have stood here. By the late 12th century the church may have belonged to the abbey at La Trinité-du-Mont, Upper Normandy; part of the patronage was later given to Bradenstoke Priory. A dispute followed, and was resolved by the bishop of Salisbury in a decision ratified in 1246 which granted the church to the priory that had been founded at Easton c. 1234. The church was enlarged with a north chapel in 1322 and by 1323 was dedicated to St Mary. In 1369 the church was demolished and material taken to enlarge the priory church, which became the parish church.

=== Holy Trinity ===

In 1536 St Mary&#x27;s church was reported to be in poor condition, and in 1591 Sir Edward Seymour replaced it with a new Church of England parish church. By 1763 this church was dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The nave, font and porch survive from 1591; 19th-century restoration included work by T.H. Wyatt in 1852–3, when a south vestry was added with a tower above, and the body of the church was extended westward by one bay.

The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1988. The benefice was united with Milton Lilbourne in 1929, and in 1991 with Pewsey and Wootton Rivers. Today the parish is part of the Vale of Pewsey team of churches.

==Local government==
The civil parish of Easton elects a parish council. The parish is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions.

== Amenities ==
The primary school continues on the same site, now called Easton Royal Academy. There is a village hall at Easton Royal. A pub, the &quot;Bruce Arms&quot;, is in the west of the parish, close to the boundary with Milton Lilbourne.

==Notable residents and benefactors ==
* Several Esturmys, hereditary wardens of Savernake forest since the Norman Conquest, funded and were buried at Easton church; their monuments were later (c. 1590) moved to Great Bedwyn when the original church fell into disrepair. Named, amongst others, on a stone plaque erected in the church in 1950.
* &quot;Major&quot; Sir John Wildman was captured here in 1655.

<doc id="1074861" wikidata="Q6892517" url="?curid=1074861" title="Mohammad Va'ez Abaee-Khorasani">
<text>Ayatollah Mohammad Va&#x27;ez Abaee-Khorasani (1940, Mashhad - October 13, 2004, Tehran) was an Iranian cleric and reformist politician. He was a representative of Mashhad in the Majlis of Iran from 2000 to 2004.

==Early life==
Born in Mashhad in a religious family, he studied Islamic sciences in Mashhad and then moved to Qom to continue his studies there. Because of his religious-political speeches, he was arrested by the Pahlavi government twice, the first time in 1972 when he was sentenced to a short jail time. But the second time, in 1973, he was exiled to Bandar Deylam and Nain for three years. Abaee-Khorasani restarted his political speeches in 1976, with other cleric colleagues of his, especially Sadegh Khalkhali, Mehdi Karroubi, and Mohammad Mousavi-Khoiniha.

==Career==
After the Iranian Revolution, Abaee-Khorasani&#x27;s first governmental post was as the Sharia ruler in Ahwaz. Shortly after, he moved back to Qom to head the provincial branch of the Organization for Islamic Evangelization (&quot;saazmaan-e tablighaat-e eslaami&quot;), which sent clerics to the whole country for speeches during the holy Shi&#x27;a months of Muharram, Safar, and Ramadan, and also published periodicals, which sometimes contained critiques of extremist or conservative factions of the &quot;hawza&quot;.

While keeping the position in Qom, Abaee-Khorasani moved to Mashhad and was one of the Friday prayer Imams of the city for ten years, where he escaped an unsuccessful assassination attempt in 1994. He also represented the Khorasan province in the first Assembly of Experts.

Abaee-Khorasani moved to Qom again as the head of Mohammad Khatami&#x27;s presidential campaign office in the city of Qom. The Qom campaign led to about 70% of the people of the city voting for the reformist Khatami, which was unexpected because of the supposedly conservative leanings of the citizens of the city. The local campaign team later became the founding members of the Society of Scholars and Teachers of Qom&#x27;s Hawza (&quot;majma&#x27;-e mohaghgheghin va modarresin-e howze-ye elmiyye-ye ghom&quot;), the political organization of reformist clerics of the city.

When Khatami became president in 1997, he appointed Abaee-Khorasani as one of his advisors. Later, he was elected in 2000 in the parliamentary elections to represent the city of Mashhad, his birthplace, in the Majlis of Iran. He collected the most votes in the city. During his term there, he participated in the reformist candidates&#x27; sit-in in early 2004, amid his old blood and kidney disease. He also participated in the symbolic mass resignation of more than a hundred colleagues from the sixth &quot;Islamic Consultative Assembly&quot;.

==Death==
After a long physical illness, Abaee-Khorasani died on October 13, 2004, in the Khatam ol-Anbia Hospital. On October 16, he was buried in Qom, near the shrine of Fatima bint Musa ibn Jafar, the daughter of the seventh Shia Imam.

<doc id="1074870" wikidata="Q333019" url="?curid=1074870" title="Thomas Inskip, 1st Viscount Caldecote">
<text>Thomas Walker Hobart Inskip, 1st Viscount Caldecote, (5 March 1876 – 11 October 1947) was a British politician who served in many legal posts, culminating in serving as Lord Chancellor from 1939 until 1940. Despite legal posts dominating his career for all but four years, he is most prominently remembered for serving as Minister for Coordination of Defence from 1936 until 1939.

==Background and education==
Inskip was the son of James Inskip, a solicitor, by his second wife Constance Sophia Louisa, daughter of John Hampden. The Right Reverend James Inskip was his elder half-brother and Sir John Hampden Inskip, Lord Mayor of Bristol, his younger brother. He attended Clifton College from 1886 to 1894 and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, from 1894 to 1897. He joined Clifton RFC in 1895–96. In 1899 he was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple.

==Political and legal career==
Inskip became a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1914. He served in the Intelligence Division from 1915 and from 1918 to 1919 worked at the Admiralty as head of the Naval Law branch. From 1920 to 1922, he served as Chancellor of the Diocese of Truro. In 1918 he entered Parliament as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bristol Central. He was first appointed Solicitor General in 1922 and would hold this post for the next six years, with one short interruption for the Labour government of 1924. In 1922 he was knighted.

A staunch Protestant, he first came to high attention when in 1927 he joined with the Home Secretary Sir William Joynson-Hicks in attacking the proposed new version of the Book of Common Prayer. The law required Parliament to approve such revisions, normally regarded as a formality, but when the Prayer Book came before the House of Commons Inskip argued strongly against its adoption, for he felt it strayed far from the Protestant principles of the Church of England. The debate on the Prayer Book is regarded as one of the most eloquent ever seen in the Commons, and resulted in the rejection of the Prayer Book. A revised version was submitted in 1928 but rejected again. However, the Church Assembly then declared an emergency, and used this as a pretext to use the new Prayer Book for many decades afterwards.

In 1928 Inskip was promoted to Attorney General, which post he held until the following year&#x27;s general election – in which he lost his Bristol seat. When Ramsay MacDonald formed his National Government in 1931, Inskip, who had been elected in a by-election for Fareham in February that year, returned to the role of Solicitor General but the following year a vacancy occurred and he once more resumed his work as Attorney General. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1932. In 1935 he prosecuted the 26th Baron de Clifford for manslaughter, which was the last ever criminal trial of a peer in the House of Lords.

Despite an exclusively legal track record, on 13 March 1936 Inskip became the first Minister for Coordination of Defence. His appointment to this particular office was highly controversial. Winston Churchill (who said he &quot;had the advantage of being little known and knowing nothing about military subjects&quot;) had long campaigned for such an office and when its creation was announced, most expected Churchill to be appointed. When Inskip was named, one famous reaction was that &quot;This is the most cynical appointment since Caligula made his horse a consul&quot;. John Gunther, who described Inskip in 1940 as &quot;the sixty-three-year-old man of mystery&quot;, reported the &quot;cruel story&quot; that Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin wanted to appoint someone &quot;&#x27;even less brilliant than himself&#x27;&quot;. Collin Brooks castigated Inskip in his diary as &quot;a second-rate Attorney General.&quot; His appointment is now regarded as a sign of caution by Baldwin who did not wish to appoint someone like Churchill, because it would have been interpreted by foreign powers as a sign of the United Kingdom preparing for war. Baldwin anyway wished to avoid taking onboard such a controversial and radical minister as Churchill.

Inskip&#x27;s tenure as Minister for Coordination of Defence remains controversial, with some arguing that he did much to push Britain&#x27;s rearmament before the outbreak of the Second World War, but others arguing he was largely ineffectual, although his ministry &quot;had no real powers and little staff&quot;. In early 1939 he was replaced by the former First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Lord Chatfield, and moved to become Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. At the outbreak of war in 1939 he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Caldecote, of Bristol in the County of Gloucester, and made Lord Chancellor, but in May 1940 he once more became Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to make room for the marginalising of Sir John Simon in the new war ministry of Winston Churchill. After leaving ministerial office Inskip served as Lord Chief Justice of England from 1940 until 1946. As of , he remains the last Lord Chief Justice to have held a ministerial office before his appointment.

Inskip was referred to in the book &quot;Guilty Men&quot; by Michael Foot, Frank Owen and Peter Howard (writing under the pseudonym &#x27;Cato&#x27;), published in 1940 as an attack on public figures for their failure to re-arm and their appeasement of Nazi Germany.

==Family==
Lord Caldecote married Lady Augusta Helen Elizabeth, daughter of David Boyle, 7th Earl of Glasgow and widow of Charles Lindsay Orr-Ewing, in 1914. He died in October 1947, aged 71, and was succeeded by his son, Robert (Robin) Andrew in the viscountcy. Lady Caldecote died in May 1967, aged 90.

<doc id="1074891" wikidata="Q360684" url="?curid=1074891" title="Message to Adolf">
<text>, known in earlier English translations as Adolf, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Osamu Tezuka. Set before, during, and after World War II, the story is centered on three men who share the name Adolf. Adolf Kamil is an Ashkenazi Jew living in Japan. His best friend Adolf Kaufmann is of both Japanese and German descent. The third Adolf is Adolf Hitler, the dictator of Germany. The manga also features Sohei Toge, a Japanese reporter, and his quest for documents that could turn the tide of the war. The work explores the themes of nationality, ethnicity, racism, and war, and includes elements of coming of age, spy fiction, and historical drama.

&quot;Message to Adolf&quot; is considered the last completed serialized work of Tezuka&#x27;s career. Viz Media published the manga as &quot;Adolf&quot; in English in the 1990s. Vertical, Inc. re-licensed the series and published a new translation in 2012.

== Plot ==
In 1936, Japanese reporter Sohei Toge travels to Berlin to cover the Berlin Olympic Games. Upon arriving, he finds that his younger brother, who has been studying in Germany as an international student, has been murdered and had connections with Communist organisations. Furthermore, all traces of information regarding his younger brother&#x27;s study in Germany has vanished. Investigating the matter, he later learns that his brother&#x27;s murder is connected to documents he mailed to Japan with information regarding Adolf Hitler. This information is crucial to the Third Reich as it contains proof that Adolf Hitler has Jewish blood.

Wolfgang Kaufmann, a Nazi Party expatriate living in Japan, is ordered to find the documents. He expects his son, Japanese-German Adolf Kaufmann, to become a staunch supporter of Adolf Hitler and the German Reich. However, Adolf Kaufmann is reluctant to follow his father&#x27;s wishes, as his best friend Adolf Kamil is the son of German Jews. Wolfgang dies after complications regarding a search for the aforementioned document: with his dying breath, he forces Adolf Kaufmann (hereafter referred to as Kauffman) to go to Germany in order to join the Hitler Youth. While at the Hitler Youth academy, Kaufmann witnesses Kamil&#x27;s father brought to execution after he comes to Europe to try to bring Jews to Japan through Shanghai. Kaufmann is forced to execute Kamil&#x27;s father with a pistol as a loyalty test. As Kaufmann becomes more and more indoctrinated, in contrast his mother Yukie becomes more distant from her late husband&#x27;s German ties. A test to Kaufmann&#x27;s loyalty to the Reich comes when he falls in love with a German Jewish-Chinese girl, Eliza. He successfully smuggles her to his friend Kamil in Japan, but is unable to get her family to go. A year later, Japan invades China and begins the Second Sino-Japanese War, ushering in a period of fevered militarism and nationalism in Japan. During this time, Kamil becomes the confidant of one of his teachers, Ms. Ogi, who is involved in the Japanese anti-war movement.

As events progress, the lives of the three Adolfs intertwine and become more and more tangled as Sohei Toge searches for his brother&#x27;s murderer. After being tortured by the Gestapo, Toge eventually tracks down his brother&#x27;s girlfriend, who is revealed to be a spy working for her father, inspector Lampe. He confronts her in anger, and she confesses to reporting Isao to the SS. After a scuffle, he rapes her and leaves for Japan. Shortly afterwards, she commits suicide. In Japan, Toge quickly becomes a target for both the Kenpeitai and the German secret police, who routinely chase him down and beat him in an attempt to find the documents. Despite this, he links up with Ogi, and manages to recover the documents his brother sent to Kobe before he died. The documents change locations many times as Toge is unable to find a job due to his status as a suspect. During one of these pursuits, he makes friends with a Japanese police chief, who accompanies him on a chase to an island where Ogi is keeping the documents. However, a Gestapo team under Lampe, who is seeking revenge for his daughter, tracks him down there. Toge manages to evade Lampe after a heated firefight on the island. Though the chief is killed, a memo he wrote earlier absolves Toge of wrongdoing, and the Japanese police stop chasing him. To avoid further trouble, the documents are passed to Ogi and then to Kamil, who is now living with Eliza. In 1941 with the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Toge decides that the documents would be best in the hands of Honda, an Imperial Army general&#x27;s son working for the Soviet spy ring under Richard Sorge. Before Honda can send the documents to the Soviets, Sorge is captured and the spy ring collapses. Before Honda is executed by his father after confessing to treason, he manages to bury the documents.

In the years leading up to 1945, Kaufmann ascends the hierarchy of the Nazi Party and completes his indoctrination as a Nazi. He eventually becomes a loyal subordinate of Hitler and a coordinator of death marches as an SS official. In the fallout of the July 20 Plot and Germany on the brink of military defeat under an increasingly unstable Fuhrer, he is sent to Japan by a surviving Lampe to complete his father Wolfgang&#x27;s mission. Upon arrival, he is surprised to find his target, Toge, married to his mother. He also meets with Kamil, who he is angered to find has become engaged to Eliza. He later traps Eliza and rapes her, and eventually beats Kamil who comes for revenge. During his alienation of his family and friends in Japan, he is disowned by Yukie, who shortly thereafter suffers brain damage during the Allied air raid of Kobe. Kaufmann&#x27;s continued investigation eventually leads to the buried documents, which he discovers only after Hitler&#x27;s death renders his entire mission pointless.

Kaufmann and Kamil later meet during the Israeli-Lebanese conflict in the 1960s, which sees countless atrocities on both sides. Kaufmann, who has joined the Lebanese PLO after being constantly chased down by Israeli Nazi hunters, arrives home one day to see his Muslim wife and daughter murdered by Kamil&#x27;s division. He begins a vendetta against Kamil, and challenges him to a duel. Kamil arrives and reveals his knowledge of his father&#x27;s execution, and after a firefight, gains his revenge by gunning down Kaufmann.

In the 1980s, Toge arrives in Israel to visit Kamil&#x27;s surviving family after he is killed in a terrorist bombing attack. He resolves to write a book called &quot;Message to Adolf&quot;, recounting the stories of the three Adolfs, and what the concept of &quot;justice&quot; can lead to.

===First World War===
No. 28 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps was formed on 7 November 1915 at Fort Grange, Gosport. Initially it was a training squadron equipped with a variety of different aircraft, although in June 1916, it was also recorded as having home defence duties, for which it had a few Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.12s, although it lost this role in July that year. On 9 June, part of the squadron was split off to form the nucleus of the new 56 Squadron. In July 1917, 28 Squadron moved to Yatesbury in Wiltshire for conversion to the fighter role, receiving the Sopwith Camel from September 1917.

The squadron moved to France on 8 October 1917, and flew its first operational sortie on 20 October, during the Battle of Passchendaele, when 19 of the squadron&#x27;s aircraft provided cover during an attack by Camels of 70 Squadron on a German airfield at Rumbeke, Belgium, with 28 Squadron claiming three German aircraft shot down. On 26 October, as a result of the Austro-German offensive against Italy at the Battle of Caporetto, the British government agreed to send troops and aircraft to reinforce the Italians, and 28 Squadron was one of the squadrons ordered to Italy, arriving at Milan by rail on 12 November, with its aircraft uncrated and reassembled by 14 November. The squadron&#x27;s aircraft flew escort missions for army cooperation patrols over the front lines, as well as for longer-range strategic reconnaissance missions and for bombing raids.

From February 1918, the squadron added attacks against enemy airfields to its duties, and in March, a flight of Bristol F.2 Fighters was attached to the squadron for long-range reconnaissance, although they were soon passed in to 34 Squadron. On 1 April 1918, the squadron became part of the newly established Royal Air Force. On 15 June 1918, Austria-Hungary launched a major offensive on the Italian front. As the weather on the sector of the front (on the Asiago plateau) held by British troops was too poor for air power to be useful, the RAF squadrons&#x27; efforts were diverted to help the Italians on the Piave front, where Austro-Hungarian forces had crossed the River Piave. All available British aircraft were employed against the Austro-Hungarian forces, and in particular against the crossings over the Piave, and when the offensive had been stopped, against the retreating Austro-Hungarian troops. On 27 October 1918, the Italians launched their final, successful, offensive of the war, at the Battle of Vittorio Veneto. RAF squadrons, including 28 Squadron, were employed in attacking the retreating Austro-Hungarian troops until the Armistice of Villa Giusti ended the fighting on 4 November.

By the end of the First World War, the squadron had claimed 111 enemy aircraft destroyed, with a further 24 driven down out of control. It numbered eleven flying aces among its ranks, with future Air Vice-Marshal Clifford MacKay McEwen, with 27 claims, being the squadron&#x27;s leading scorer. Other aces included William George Barker (who claimed 22 of his total of 50 while with the squadron), Harold B. Hudson, James Hart Mitchell, Stanley Stanger, Arthur Cooper, Percy Wilson, Thomas Frederic Williams, and Joseph E. Hallonquist.

===Inter war years===
The squadron returned to Britain in February 1919, first to its old home at Yatesbury, then to Leighterton in Gloucestershire and to Eastleigh in Hampshire in October 1919. It was disbanded on 20 January 1920 at Eastleigh. On 1 April 1920, however, it was reformed at RAF Ambala in Northern India by renumbering 114 Squadron, an army cooperation squadron equipped with the Bristol F2b Fighter. The squadron operated over the North-West Frontier, moving to Kohat in December 1921. While the squadron had an authorised establishment of 12 aircraft, the actual number of aircraft possessed by the squadron was usually considerably less, with the squadron recorded as having 7 aircraft on 30 June 1922. Serviceability of the RAF&#x27;s India-based aircraft was also poor, with many of the aircraft old and worn out. In an August 1922 report on the state of the RAF in India Air Vice Marshall John Salmond noted that of an authorised establishment of 70 aircraft in India, only 7 were operational, with aircraft flying without equipment essential to safety, and concluded that &quot;...the Royal Air Force in India is to all intents and purposes non-existent as a fighting force at this date.&quot;

In April 1923, the squadron moved to Peshawar, with a detachment at Tank, and in January 1925, moved to RAF Quetta. As well as its normal duties, the squadron operated an experimental air mail service from Quetta to Shimla in 1925. In January 1927, the squadron returned to Ambala, where it remained based for the next 10 years. In September 1931, the squadron replaced its Bristol Fighters with Westland Wapitis. The squadron flew relief flights into Quetta after the city had been devastated by an earthquake on 31 May 1935. The squadron re-equipped again with the Hawker Audax during June 1936. In April 1937, the squadron was forward deployed to Manzai in response to an uprising by supporters of Mitza Ali Khan in Waziristan. The squadron returned to Ambala in July 1937, although it continued to maintain detachments at Miranshah. It moved to Kohat in March 1939.

===Second World War===
The squadron remained at Kohat, on the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe. It re-equipped with the Westland Lysander monoplane in September 1941. In early January 1942, as a response to the Japanese invasion of Burma, two of the squadron&#x27;s Lysanders were sent to Port Blair in the Andaman Islands, with the remainder of the squadron preparing to move to Burma. Nineteen Lysanders reached Lashio in the Shan States on 26 January, with the squadron, together with the similarly equipped 1 Squadron, Indian Air Force, moved forward to Taungoo, and being fitted with racks to carry bombs for direct support of the Army. On 2 February 1942, two Lysanders set out from Mingaladon carrying Lieutenant-General Thomas Hutton, General Officer Commanding Burma Command and his aide to Lashio, in the first part of Hutton&#x27;s planned journey to Chongqing to meet Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek. The two aircraft became lost however and the Lysander carrying Hutton crashed and caught fire. While Hutton managed to escape the burning aircraft, the pilot, Flight lieutenant E. W. Tate was badly injured and Hutton was unable to free him, with Tate dying from his wounds six days later. The squadron&#x27;s Lysanders carried out a number of bombing attacks against Japanese-held airfields, rail targets, river traffic and troops, but losses were heavy, and the squadron was ordered to withdraw back to India on 17 February, leaving a detachment of three Lysanders behind in Burma. The two aircraft detached to the Andaman Islands were destroyed by their crews on 18 February before the detachment evacuated the Andamans, while the surviving two aircraft of the Burma-based detachment were evacuated to India on 26 February. 

In March 1942, the squadron had moved to Lahore to rebuild its strength, but in April it moved to Ranchi, in North-East India. In July, the squadron moved to its old base at Kohat for operations over the North-West Frontier, supporting operations by a mobile column of the Indian Army against followers of Mitza Ali Khan, who had cut the road between Miramshah and Datta Khel. Following the successful relief of Datta Khel and the dispersal of the rebels, the squadron returned to Ranchi in August. In December 1942 it was re-equipped with Hawker Hurricane IIb aircraft in the fighter-reconnaissance role. By January 1943 the squadron was operating over Burma, with detachments at Maungdaw and Imphal. The Maungdaw-based detachment moved to Ramu, Cox&#x27;s Bazar in April and to Cox&#x27;s Bazar in May 1943. Operations included both tactical reconnaissance and high-level photo reconnaissance, together with offensive patrols against Japanese river traffic. The squadron flew at least 100 operational sorties per month throughout 1943, including during the Monsoon season. 

In March 1944, the squadron began to replace its machine-gun armed Hurricane IIbs with cannon-armed Hurricane IIcs, while the squadron&#x27;s operational tempo picked up in the early part of the year, reaching 12 sorties per day in March, while in April it supplemented its normal duties with carrying mail between Dimapur and besieged Imphal during the Battles of Imphal and Kohima. The squadron was pulled out of the front line in July 1944, returning to operations over Burma in December that year. In May 1945, it started to receive Hurricane IVs to supplement its IIcs. On 1 August 1945, the squadron received three Supermarine Spitfire PR.XIs, flying a few sorties with them before the end of the war.

===Post-War (1946–1967)===
After the end of the Second World War the squadron continued as a fighter-reconnaissance unit as part of the Far East Air Force. In October 1945, the squadron replaced its Hurricanes with more Spitfires, (Mk VIIIs and Mk XIVEs), concentrating on the Spitfire XIVE by the end of the year. It moved to Penang, Malaya in November 1945 and to RAF Kuala Lumpur in April 1946, and then to RAF Tengah, Singapore in February 1947. The squadron received Spitfire FR.18s in 1947. In January 1948, six of the squadron&#x27;s Spitfires took part in Operation Snapdragon, an experimental deployment to Hong Kong, to test the ability to reinforce the colony in an emergency. They flew via Kuching, Sarawak, Labuan and Clark Field in the Philippines, arriving at Hong Kong after 2 days, flying . It moved to RAF Sembawang, also in Singapore in February 1949. It moved to RAF Kai Tak, Hong Kong in 1949 still with Spitfires, in order to strengthen Hong Kong&#x27;s defences as a result of the ongoing Chinese Civil War, with the squadron&#x27;s role changing from fighter-reconnaissance to pure fighter. From then on the squadron was regularly moved between Kai Tak and Sek Kong. In February 1951, the squadron was re-equipped with jet aircraft, as de Havilland Vampire FB.5s replaced the Spitfires, with 28 Squadron being the last front-line RAF squadron equipped with the Spitfire. From February 1952, it began receiving Vampire FB.9s, which were fitted with air conditioning, which made operations in the hot climate of Hong Kong more tolerable for the pilots. In February 1956, the squadron discarded its Vampires, again being the last front-line RAF squadron to operate the type, receiving de Havilland Venom FB.1s as replacements, exchanging them for Venom FB.4s in November 1959. In June 1957, as a result of the 1957 Defence Review, Sek Kong was handed over the army, with 28 Squadron returning to Kai Tak. While at Kai Tak from May 1962 the squadron changed to flying Hawker Hunter FGA.9s, until 2 January 1967 when it was disbanded.

===Helicopters (1968–present)===
The squadron was reformed on 1 March 1968 at Kai Tak from a detachment of No. 103 Squadron RAF operating Westland Whirlwind HC.10s. The Westland Wessex HC.2 was introduced to the squadron from January 1972 and the Whirlwinds operated until August 1972. On 17 May 1978 the squadron moved to RAF Sek Kong and stayed until 1 November 1996. The squadron returned to Kai Tak from then until disbanded on 3 June 1997 prior to the British withdrawal on 1 July, with the squadron&#x27;s Wessexes being sold to Uruguay. It was the last RAF squadron to leave the territory.

The RAF ordered 22 Westland Merlin HC3 helicopters in March 1995, the first of which was received from GKNWestland, now AgustaWestland, on 7 March 2001. The squadron officially reformed on 17 July 2001 at RAF Benson, the first time in its recent history that the squadron had been stationed in the UK.

The squadron&#x27;s first operational role with the Merlin was in support of SFOR at Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The aircraft and personnel deployed on 1 April 2003, the same day that an initial operational capability was declared for the Merlin. The detachment ceased on 31 March 2004 and the squadron then began to prepare for operations in Iraq.

The squadron&#x27;s commitment to Operation Telic began on 1 March 2005. Several aircraft and a mix of aircrew, engineers and support personnel from 28 (AC) Squadron and RAF Benson, deployed using the historic No. 1419 Flight RAF to replace the Chinooks of No. 1310 Flight RAF at Basrah Air Station, Iraq.

In 2009, the squadron returned from Operation Telic and later on in the year deployed on Operation Herrick keeping the designation of 1419 Flight. The squadron returned during May 2013. In July 2015, the squadron handed over its Merlin helicopters to 845 Naval Air Squadron and re-roled as No. 28 (Reserve) Squadron OCU whose role is to train Chinook Mk4 and Puma Mk2 helicopters crews.

On 1 February 2018, the RAF rescinded all (Reserve) suffixes leading to No. 28 (Reserve) Squadron becoming No. 28 Squadron.

In March 2020, the squadron was awarded the right to emblazon a battle honour on its squadron standard, recognising its role in the War in Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014.

On 28 October 2021, No. 28 Squadron was re-awarded its historical designation of No. 28 (Army Co-operation) Squadron.

<doc id="1074898" wikidata="Q9335985" url="?curid=1074898" title="Shelsley Walsh">
<text>Shelsley Walsh is a small village and civil parish in Worcestershire, England, on the western side of the River Teme. For administrative purposes it is presently located in the Teme Valley ward of the county’s Malvern Hills district. In the 2011 Census there was an estimated population of 28 people in 12 households.
The site has been farmed since Anglo Saxon times and there are also vestiges of former industry, but it is now best known for its association with the Shelsley Walsh Speed Hill Climb.

==History==
The name of the settlement was recorded as &quot;Celdeslai&quot; in the Domesday Book, with the meaning of &quot;Sceald&#x27;s clearing&quot;: from Old English &quot;Sceald&quot; (a personal name) and &quot;leāh&quot; (wood, clearing). Other spellings were used in the following centuries, and the location was also known as Little Shelsley to distinguish it from Great Shelsley (Shelsley Beauchamp) on the opposite side of the River Teme. The village was described in 1831 as being within the upper division of Doddingtree hundred in Worcestershire and having 57 inhabitants. In 1868 John Noake gave the additional information that it consisted of two farm houses and nine cottages, and that its 410 acres were used for growing hops, fruit and corn.

The addition of Walsh to the village&#x27;s name followed when members of the family became lord of the manor, the first of them being Sir Henry le Waleys in the time of King Edward I. They were to remain at Shelsley and in the surrounding district until the start of the eighteenth century, with as arms a fesse between six black martlets on a silver shield, the crest being a griffin&#x27;s head with the motto &quot;veritas et virtu vincunt&quot; (truth and probity triumph). Later tenants of the manor included Joseph Smith, a notable breeder of Hereford cattle, and Montagu Taylor, whose fascination with modern technology led him to offer the use of one of his farm tracks as the earliest hill-racing venue for cars in 1905.

==Buildings==
===St Andrew&#x27;s church=== 
St Andrew&#x27;s church is the oldest existing building on the site and is of a simple design, having a Norman nave to which a chancel was added in the 13th century. Mainly it was built of a tufa known as travertine, available locally from along the ridge behind the church at Southstone Rock. The spectacular woodwork inside the building dates from the 15th century and is notable for the very rare chancel screen which extends into a squire&#x27;s pew. Also to be found there is a circular Norman font, a floor of mediaeval tiles and the 1596 wooden tomb of Francis Walsh and his wife, carved to resemble stone. What Nicholas Pevsner described as a &quot;distinctively quirky restoration&quot; was made by George Truefitt in 1859, which resulted in the exterior addition of the pyramid-roofed wooden bell-turret and a north porch. Fortunately his interior additions of a font, pulpit and fireplace of his own mediaeval design were discarded in 1908 and the old font restored from its exile in the churchyard.

Having belonged during part of the 19th century to the Archdeaconry of Salop and Diocese of Hereford, the parish was later transferred to the Archdeaconry of Ludlow and Diocese of Hereford (1876–1905) before reverting to the Archdeaconry and Diocese of Worcester (1905–1972). After 1972 the separate parish of St Andrew&#x27;s was merged with four others in the area to form the united benefice of the Teme Triangle.

===Court House===
On the site of what was formerly the Walsh&#x27;s moated manor is now the Grade II listed building known as Court House. The older parts of this date from the 16th century, to which additions were made in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. It used to be said that the house was haunted by the ghost of Lady Lightfoot, who drove a carriage with flaming horses through the rooms before disappearing into the moat with fearful shrieks.
The house once functioned as the estate&#x27;s home farm, near which was a mill recorded from the start of the 14th century. The present brick building dates from about 1800, with its wheel turned by water conducted from a pond in the grounds of Court House, itself fed from the steep dingle behind it. The mill is associated with a double range of buildings downslope, refurbished by Montagu Taylor as a model farm. Today the site functions as a tourist attraction and was Grade II listed in 2008. The mill, which was used to grind animal feed until 1923, was restored by volunteers during 2006-10.

Lying to the north of the site is a half-timber and plaster two-story house, recorded as the rectory on the 1883 Ordnance Survey map, and adjoining it the rectory farm, a combination of barn and dwelling.

==Former industry==
There are indications of former industries in the names of two farms in Shelsley Walsh parish. One is Forgemill Farm, after which the nearby Newmill Bridge over the River Teme is also named. Somewhere in the vicinity there was a water-driven iron forge which in 1635 was sold with a parcel of ground called the Coal Yard to a local owner. The forge once produced 100 tons of iron a year and was recorded as still operative in 1779. On the corner of the turn to Newmill Bridge there is an old milestone with an iron plate recording the distance from Worcester Cross as ten miles.

Further along the road, near Furnace Farm, were three small lime kilns once fed with rock from hillside quarries in locations still named &#x27;Hell Hole&#x27; and &#x27;Devil&#x27;s Den&#x27;. Two workers&#x27; cottages nearby were added to and rebuilt by Montagu Taylor, although they were abandoned by the mid-20th century. Southstone Rock was just over the parish boundary along the quarried ridge, from which stone was supplied not only for the church of St Andrew but also to build or repair others in the vicinity.

<doc id="1074907" wikidata="Q3756576" url="?curid=1074907" title="Dichanthelium">
<text>Dichanthelium is genus of flowering plants of the grass family, Poaceae. They are known commonly as rosette grasses and panicgrasses.

==Taxonomy==
Formerly a subgenus of the genus &quot;Panicum&quot;, &quot;Dichanthelium&quot; was elevated to genus status in 1974. Its species are still treated as members of &quot;Panicum&quot; by some authorities, because the two genera are very similar in form. Molecular data support the recognition of &quot;Dichanthelium&quot; as a separate genus.

The name &quot;Dichanthelium&quot; originates from the Greek for &quot;twice-flowering&quot;, in reference to the vernal and autumnal growth phases.

==Description==
These are perennial grasses, sometimes with rhizomes. The grasses may overwinter as rosettes of short, wide leaves and then produce longer, wider leaves on the stem during spring. They produce hollow stems a few centimeters tall to well over one meter. They are upright to erect when new, then sometimes sprawling, spreading, and bending as the season progresses. The upper stems may have a few main branches that divide into smaller branches bearing panicles. There are primary panicles, which may be chasmogamous, and secondary panicles, which are often cleistogamous. The spikelets are roughly 1 to 5 millimeters long and lack awns.

In the Chicago area, &quot;Dichanthelium&quot; is considered the most emblematic genus of the Gulf and Atlantic coastal plain disjunct habitat found in that region.

==Species==
There are about 72 species in the genus. Species include:


*&quot;Dichanthelium aciculare&quot; – needleleaf rosette grass, narrow-leaved panicgrass
*&quot;Dichanthelium acuminatum&quot; – tapered rosette grass, hotsprings rosette grass, hairy panicgrass

<text>The AVPU scale (an acronym from &quot;alert, verbal, pain, unresponsive&quot;) is a system by which a health care professional can measure and record a patient&#x27;s level of consciousness. It is mostly used in emergency medicine protocols, and within first aid.

It is a simplification of the Glasgow Coma Scale, which assesses a patient response in three measures: eyes, voice and motor skills. The AVPU scale should be assessed using these three identifiable traits, looking for the best response of each.

==Meaning of the mnemonic==
The AVPU scale has four possible outcomes for recording (as opposed to the 13 possible outcomes on the Glasgow Coma Scale). The assessor should always work from best (A) to worst (U) to avoid unnecessary tests on patients who are clearly conscious. The four possible recordable outcomes are:

* Alert: The patient is fully awake (although not necessarily oriented). This patient will have spontaneously open eyes, will respond to voice (although may be confused) and will have bodily motor function.
* Verbal: The patient makes some kind of response when you talk to them, which could be in any of the three component measures of eyes, voice or motor – e.g. patient&#x27;s eyes open on being asked &quot;Are you OK?&quot;. The response could be as little as a grunt, moan, or slight move of a limb when prompted by the voice of the rescuer.
* Pain: The patient makes a response on any of the three component measures on the application of pain stimulus, such as a central pain stimulus like a sternal rub or a peripheral stimulus such as squeezing the fingers. A patient with some level of consciousness (a fully conscious patient would not require a pain stimulus) may respond by using their voice, moving their eyes, or moving part of their body (including abnormal posturing).
*Unresponsive: Sometimes seen noted as &#x27;unconscious&#x27;, this outcome is recorded if the patient does not show any eye, voice or motor response to voice or pain.

In first aid, an AVPU score of anything less than A is often considered an indication to get further help, as the patient is likely to be in need of more definitive care. In the hospital or long term healthcare facilities, caregivers may consider an AVPU score of less than A to be the patient&#x27;s normal baseline.

In some emergency medical services protocols, &quot;Alert&quot; can be subdivided into a scale of 1 to 4, in which 1, 2, 3 and 4 correspond to certain attributes, such as time, person, place, and event. For example, a fully alert patient might be considered &quot;alert and oriented x 4&quot; if they could correctly identify the time, their name, their location, and the event.

EMS crews may begin with an AVPU assessment, to be followed by a GCS assessment if the AVPU score is below &quot;A.&quot;

==Limitations==
The AVPU scale is not suitable for long-term neurological observation of a patient; in this situation, the Glasgow Coma Scale is more appropriate.

==Comparison with other classification systems==

When compared to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) the AVPU classification of alertness has been suggested to correspond in the following manner: 
* Alert = 15 GCS
* Voice Responsive = 13 GCS
* Pain Responsive = 8 GCS
* Unconscious/DOA = 3 GCS
(Kelly, Upex and Bateman, 2004)

The AVPU scale can also be compared to the Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (PGCS). The PGCS corresponds with the AVPU classification of consciousness in the following manner:
* Alert = 11–15 PGCS
* Voice Responsive = 5–15 PGCS
* Pain Responsive = 4–12 PGCS
* Unconscious = 3–5 PGCS

<text>A drawing room is a room in a house where visitors may be entertained, and an alternative name for a living room. The name is derived from the 16th-century terms withdrawing room and withdrawing chamber, which remained in use through the 17th century, and made their first written appearance in 1642. In a large 16th- to early 18th-century English house, a withdrawing room was a room to which the owner of the house, his wife, or a distinguished guest who was occupying one of the main apartments in the house could &quot;withdraw&quot; for more privacy. It was often off the great chamber (or the great chamber&#x27;s descendant, the state room) and usually led to a formal, or &quot;state&quot; bedroom.

In modern houses, it may be used as a convenient name for a second or further reception room, but no particular function is associated with the name.

==History and development==
In 18th-century London, the royal morning receptions that the French called &quot;levées&quot; were called &quot;drawing rooms&quot;, with the sense originally that the privileged members of court would gather in the drawing room outside the king&#x27;s bedroom, where he would make his first formal public appearance of the day.

During the American Civil War, in the White House of the Confederacy in Richmond, Virginia, the drawing room was off the parlor where CSA President Jefferson Davis greeted his guests. At the conclusion of these greetings, the men remained in the parlor to talk politics and the women withdrew to the drawing room for their own conversation. This was common practice in the affluent circles of the Southern United States. 

In 1865, an architectural manual in England defined &quot;drawing room&quot; in this way:

 Until the mid-twentieth century, after a dinner the ladies of a dinner party withdrew to the drawing room, leaving the gentlemen at table, where the tablecloth was removed. After an interval of conversation, often accompanied by brandy or port and sometimes cigars, the gentlemen rejoined the ladies in the drawing room.

The term &quot;drawing room&quot; is not used as widely as it once was, and tends to be used in Britain only by those who also have other reception rooms, such as a morning room, a 19th-century designation for a sitting room, often with east-facing exposure, suited for daytime calls, or the middle-class lounge, a late-19th-century designation for a room in which to relax. Hence the drawing room is the smartest room in the house, usually used by the adults of the family when entertaining. This term is widely used in India and Pakistan, probably dating from the colonial days, in the larger urban houses of the cities where there are many rooms.

The term parlour initially designated the more modest reception rooms of the middle classes, but usage changed in the UK as homeowners sought to identify with the grander homes of the wealthy. Parlor remained the common usage in North America into the early 20th century. In French usage the word &quot;salon&quot;, previously designating a state room, began to be used for a drawing room in the early part of the 19th century, reflecting the &quot;salon&quot; social gatherings that had become popular in the preceding decades.

==Railway usage==
The term &quot;drawing room&quot; was historically also applied to certain passenger train accommodations, designating some of the most spacious and expensive private accommodations available on board a sleeping car or private railroad car. An example, named as such, was a Midland Railway &quot;Drawing Room Car&quot; in 1874 that was made by Pullman and imported from the United States.

In North America, it meant a room which slept three or more persons, with a private washroom. Although Amtrak has retired its sleeping cars that were built with drawing rooms, they are still used by Via Rail Canada. The traditional nomenclature is seen as archaic, hence they are marketed as &quot;triple bedrooms&quot;.

==Drawing room plays==
The drawing room, being a room in the house to entertain visitors, gave its name to drawing room plays, a genre of theatrical productions and motion pictures. Beginning with the early forms of drama, the drawing room play has evolved to encompass comedy as well as to include the forms of the dramatic monologue. The play format itself has also grown out of the traditional drawing room performance and back into main street theater and film. While the drawing room itself has fallen out of favor, the play format has continued to provide a source of entertainment.

Drawing room comedy typically features wit and verbal banter among wealthy, leisured, genteel, upper class characters. Drawing room comedy is also sometimes called the &quot;comedy of manners&quot;. Oscar Wilde&#x27;s 1895 &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; and several of the plays of Noël Coward are typical works of the genre. George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s 1919 &quot;Heartbreak House&quot; adds an undercurrent of social criticism to the genre. Cary Grant appeared in a number of filmed drawing-room comedies. Ernst Lubitsch was especially known as a director of drawing room comedies.

<text>Lower Fort Garry was built in 1830 by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company on the western bank of the Red River, north of the original Fort Garry (now in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada). Treaty 1 was signed there.

A devastating flood destroyed Fort Garry in 1826, prompting the Company&#x27;s then-governor, George Simpson, to search for a safer location down river. Governor Simpson chose the site of Lower Fort Garry because of its high ground and location below the St. Andrew&#x27;s Rapids, eliminating a time-consuming portage of heavy fur packs and York boats. However, the fort never became the administrative centre it was intended, since most of the population of the area was centred near The Forks and objected to the extra travel required to do business at the new fort. As a result, Upper Fort Garry was rebuilt in stone at The Forks, very near the original Fort Garry site.

==History==
===Early 19th century (1830–1850)===
The first buildings built at the fort in 1830 were the &quot;fur loft&quot;, which housed the company store, small warehouse and trader&#x27;s office, and the &quot;Big House&quot; (residence for the governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) or other high-ranking officials). Later additions included a warehouse and a men&#x27;s house. The fort&#x27;s signature walls were completed in the 1840s, adding an icehouse, powder magazine, bakehouse, and warehouse bastions. These walls were non-military, intended only to make the fort appear more important and impressive to both local traders and visiting HBC officers. Many of the buildings were constructed with limestone, which was easily obtained from nearby. The site also hosts excellent examples of Red River Frame construction (Farm Manager&#x27;s House) and Half-timbered construction (&quot;colombage pierroté&quot;) (Men&#x27;s House and Big House Annex).

Although the Lower Fort did trade a small amount of furs, its main purpose was as a supply depot for the Red River settlement and the surrounding Cree, Anishinaabe, Métis, and European (mostly Orkney Scot) populations. Many furs at the fort were brought from other districts, repackaged at the fort and sent to England via York Factory. The post traded essential manufactured goods to the farmers and hunters for produce that was in turn used for provisioning company treks into the north. 

Every now and then there was a crisis that called for military action, and Lower Fort Garry was the obvious choice for a base of operations. In 1846, British troops (6th Regiment of the Foot) were sent to the fort when a dispute erupted with the United States over the boundary between the Oregon Territory and what is now British Columbia. However, some believe the request for troops was actually intended to intimidate local free traders (as trading with anyone other than the HBC was illegal). In either case, by the time the troops arrived (1846), the threat of invasion was long over. The troops (becoming a nuisance by causing minor disturbances) were put to work at the fort completing the construction of the walls which were finished in 1848.

===Mid 19th century (1851–1884)===
The fort became an industrial centre by the 1860s and included several buildings, such as a flour mill, sawmill, forge, and a brewery. When the Red River Rebellion broke out in 1870, Louis Riel occupied Upper Fort Garry, and the Quebec Rifles took the lower fort. No wars or fights ever occurred at Lower Fort Garry as it was a peaceful settlement.

On August 3, 1871, the first treaty in Western Canada was established between the federal government and seven chiefs of the Ojibway (Saulteaux) and Swampy Cree First Nations at Lower Fort Garry. Indian Treaty No. 1 transferred the land that now comprises part of modern Manitoba. The treaty&#x27;s intent was to ensure the peaceful settlement of the prairies by European immigrants, while providing First Nations people with land, access to resources and other necessities for their survival. Almost immediately after the treaty was established, the two parties disagreed on its meaning.

Indian Treaty No. 1, the precedent for the 10 subsequent numbered treaties in Western Canada, is commemorated by a Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada plaque outside the Visitor Reception Centre.

Training of North-West Mounted Police members took place at the fort in the winter of 1873–1874. Many of the North-West Mounted Police of 1873–74 had been there already during the rebellion in 1870, including Inspector James F. MacLeod, who had met his fiancée, Mary Drever, at Lower Fort Garry on the previous trip. The first contingent of Mounties arrived in Lower Fort Garry on October 22, 1873, and on November 3 they were sworn in and commenced training. The bitter winter was spent drilling and learning to ride. The parade ground was frozen as hard as concrete, and was pretty unforgiving when a recruit was unexpectedly pitched from his horse. By the following June they were caught up in preparations for the arrival of Commissioner G.A. French and the other divisions, and headed out to meet them at Fort Dufferin. The fort was turned over once again to the Canadian Militia.

===Recent history (1885–present)===
The fort has also been a penitentiary, a mental hospital (1885–1886), an HBC residence, and a golf course/motor country club (1911–1963). One of the mental hospital&#x27;s most infamous residents was Honoré Jaxon, Louis Riel&#x27;s secretary who was found not guilty of treason by reason of insanity after the North-West Rebellion.

The HBC owned the fort until 1951, when it was given to the federal government. The site was designated a National Historic Site in 1958, and named one of the top 10 National Historic Sites in the country in 2011 by &quot;Canada&#x27;s History&quot; magazine. Between May and September, costumed interpreters recreate life at Lower Fort Garry in the early 1850s when Eden Colvile was inland governor of the HBC and in residence at the fort. Original buildings and walls, hands on activities, as well as original-to-era furnishings enhance the visitor experience.

<doc id="1074931" wikidata="Q1158204" url="?curid=1074931" title="Federation of Damanhur">
<text>The Federation of Damanhur, often called simply Damanhur, is a federation of self-sustaining communities, ecovillage, situated in the Piedmont region of northern Italy about north of the city of Turin. It is located in the foothills of the Alps in the Chiusella Valley, bordering on the Gran Paradiso National Park. The community has its own constitution and currency, the &quot;Credito&quot;.

Damanhur is named after the Egyptian city of Damanhur which was the site of a temple dedicated to Horus. A school for alchemists in Egypt.

It was founded in 1975 by Oberto Airaudi with 12 of his close friends, and by year 2000 the number had grown to 800.

The Federation of Damanhur has communities and centers in Europe, America, Australia and Japan.

The Temples of Humankind are a collection of subterranean temples built by the citizens of the Federation of Damanhur, and they are some of the largest underground temples in the world.

== Life at Damanhur ==
The constitution began with 3 bodies of Damanhur: The School of Meditation (ritual tradition) Social (social theory, social realization) and The Game of Life (experimentation and dynamics, life as a game, change). A fourth body was recently added, Technarcate (individual inner refinement).

Citizens participate in one of 4 levels, depending on their desired involvement: A, B, C, or D. Class A citizens share all resources and live on site full-time. Class B citizens contribute to financial goals and live on site a minimum of 3 days a week. Class C and D citizens live anywhere. (page 102, Merrifield, 2006) Class A &amp; B citizens participate fully in The School of Meditation, Social, and the Game of Life. Class C citizens participate fully in The School of Meditation.

Citizens participate in one of several ways, depending on their personal nature. Ways include the Way of the Oracle, the Way of the Monk, the Way of the Knight, the Way of Health, the Way of the Word, the Way of Art &amp; Work, and many others. Most citizens live in houses of 10-20 people each, federated together into the Federation of Damanhur.

Marriage works on a renewal basis, for a period of so many years before renewal. Conception is timed for auspicious birthdays of children.

From 1983 onwards, members have assumed animal names (Sparrow, Prawn, Mole, etc.).

== Controversy ==
Since May 2009, a website called Damanhur Inside Out has hosted anonymous testimonials from people claiming to be ex-members of the Damanhur community, and articles relating to legal controversy around the Foundation and its founder. In the 2007 assessment of Patrizia Santovecchi, the President of the National Psychological Abuses Observatory (Osservatorio Nazionale Abusi Psicologici, O.N.A.P.), Damanhur shares characteristics typical of psychologically abusive cults. These characteristics include barriers to leaving freely, siege syndrome, in which outsiders are portrayed as enemies constituted by negative energies; suppression of criticism, imposition of obedience, estrangement from family members, depersonalization, and submission to the will of the guru.
A 2018 analysis of interviews with ex-members echoed these themes, showing that their process of disillusionment with and departure from the community usually took several years and could be &quot;torturous&quot;.
Damanhur have publicly responded to criticism by describing themselves as an &quot;ethical cult&quot;. Academics have noted that Damanhur has undergone changes since the death of the founder in 2013, and become more outward-facing. Websites have become an important means by which the Foundation is &quot;advertising and legitimizing&quot; itself as an &#x27;Exemplary Utopia&#x27;.

<doc id="1074934" wikidata="Q820141" url="?curid=1074934" title="Hillclimbing">
<text>Hillclimbing, also known as hill climbing, speed hillclimbing, or speed hill climbing, is a branch of motorsport in which drivers compete against the clock to complete an uphill course. It is one of the oldest forms of motorsport, since the first known hillclimb at La Turbie near Nice, France, took place as long ago as 31 January 1897. The hillclimb held at Shelsley Walsh, in Worcestershire, England, is the world&#x27;s oldest continuously staged motorsport event still staged on its original course, having been first run in 1905.

==Europe==
Hillclimbs in continental Europe are usually held on courses which are several kilometres long, taking advantage of the available hills and mountains including the Alps. The most prestigious competition is the FIA European Hill Climb Championship.

===Austria===

An Austrian venue: Gaisberg. A historic course is at Semmering.

===France===
The French hill climb championship, or &quot;Championnat de France de la Montagne&quot;, has been one of the most competitive of the European national series, attracting many new F2 and 2-litre sports cars during the 1970s and early 1980s. Notable champions from this period include Pierre Maublanc (1967 and 1968), Daniel Rouveyran (1969), Hervé Bayard (1970) and Jimmy Mieusset (1971, 1972, 1973 and 1974). The best-known Course de Côte are Mont Ventoux and Mont-Dore.

===Germany===
Germany has a long hillclimbing tradition, with some manufacturers of cars or motorcycles entering factory teams until ″Bergrennen″ became amateur events in the 1970s. Two states, Nordrhein-Westfalen und Baden-Württemberg, do not allow hillclimbing racing events anymore, mostly due to environmental reasons. Thus, the probably most famous event, the Freiburg-Schauinsland race in the Black Forest, is not a competition anymore like almost 100 years ago, when the fourth International Schauinsland hillclimb at Freiburg was held on August 5, 1928: &quot;A car made the fastest time of the day, Heusser&#x27;s Bugatti putting up 74.009 km/h, the fastest motorcycle being Stegmann&#x27;s DKW at 69.6 km/h.&quot; Caracciola (Mercedes) won the over two-litre racing car class.

In the 1930s, during the era of the famous &quot;Silver Arrows&quot; from Auto Union and Mercedes-Benz, Hans Stuck (1900–1978) dominated European hillclimbing, which earned him the nickname &quot;Bergkönig&quot; or &quot;King of the Mountains&quot;. The high-powered supercharged Grand Prix cars were often modified to use twin rear tyres, like trucks, to provide better traction. 

Germany has only a small share of the Alps and few climbs there, like ″Jochrennen″ from Hindelang to Oberjoch, with the Rossfeld race in the Berchtesgaden Alps being a part of the 1965 World Sportscar Championship. At that time, Porsche entered lightweight open-top ″Bergspyder″ variants as their racing models were made for endurance racing up to 24 hours, with the Porsche 909 Bergspyder being the most extreme, weighing in at only 384kg. 

Thus, most German hillclimbs are in the Mittelgebirge regions, but even the rather flat northern part of Germany has hillclimbs, like the one in Hilter near Osnabrück, which is part of the German ″Berg Cup″ series. In the 2023 calendar, Schottenring, Wolsfeld, Iberg near Heilbad Heiligenstadt, Homburg, Saarland, Hauenstein near Hausen, Rhön-Grabfeld, Eichenbühl, Mickhausen are the events in Germany. Additional rounds are held in Luxembourg, Austria or Switzerland.

===Great Britain===
In Great Britain, the format is different from that in other parts of Europe, with courses being much shorter. Cairncastle is Great Britain&#x27;s longest hillclimb at 1.65 miles (2904 yards). These short courses are more akin to uphill sprints – and almost always take under one minute for the fastest drivers to complete. For this reason, cars and drivers do not generally cross between the British and continental European championships.

Hillclimbing is also relevant to motorcycle sport; the governing body is the National Hill Climb Association.

===Italy===

In the Italian championship, also known as the &quot;Campionato Italiano Velocità Montagna&quot;, there are the longest and most challenging hillclimbs like Trento-Bondone, Coppa Bruno Carotti (the Italian races in FIA European Hill Climb Championship), Pedavena-Croce d&#x27;Aune, Monte Erice and Verzegnis-Sella Chianzutan, which are also the most known.

Hillclimbing in Italy became famous in the 1970s, early 1980s, between 1994 and 2000 and at the end of the 2000s, especially in the last two periods thanks to TV services, magazines and live Internet commentaries.

The most famous Italian drivers, who won a lot even in Europe, are Ludovico Scarfiotti (famous Ferrari driver who won the F1 race in Monza 1966), &quot;Noris&quot; (he won almost every race in Italy until 1972, when he died), Domenico Scola (who runs a Sport Prototype even now at the age of 80), Mauro Nesti (over 20 championships between Italy and Europe, from the 1970s to the 1990s), Ezio Baribbi (three times Italian champion), Fabio Danti (1994 Italian champion, 1995-96 European champion, died in 2000), Pasquale Irlando (Italian champion in the early 1990s and European champion in the last 1990s, the one who turned the Osella PA20), Franz Tschager (three times European champion in the early 2000s), Simone Faggioli and Denny Zardo (Italian champion in 2005 and 2008, European champion in 2003)

===Malta===
Hillclimbing is a very popular sport on the island of Malta. Numerous events are organised annually by the Island Car Club. Participants are divided according to their type of vehicle into various categories ranging from single seaters to saloon cars.

===Portugal===
There are several traditional hillclimbing race events in Portugal, and its national championship growing in popularity since 2010. Falperra International Hill Climb is the most popular and famous hillclimb, being held since 1927, most of the editions as part of the European Championship.

===Romania===
In Romania, the first major event was the Feleac course, in Cluj. From 1930, it was a round in the European Hill Climb Championship. A record of the Feleac was set by famous German racer Hans Stuck in 1938, driving a Auto Union Grand Prix car. Stuck stormed through the gravel course in 2 min 56 sec. In recent decades, the course was widened in order to be suitable for intense traffic and therefore is considered inappropriate for auto racing.

The modern Romanian hillclimbing event is the &quot;Viteză în Coastă&quot; or &quot;Campionatul Național de Viteză pe Traseu Montan&quot; (VTM).

===Slovakia===
There are several traditional hillclimbing race events in Slovakia. Some of the best known and most popular include the Pezinská Baba hillclimb race and the Dobšinský Kopec hillclimb race.

One of the most well known Slovak drivers competing in local and international hillclimb events is Jozef Béreš. Béreš is also very popular on social media networks thanks to the videos of him driving his legendary Audi Quattro S1 racecar.

===Switzerland===
Motor &quot;racing&quot; was banned in Switzerland in the aftermath of the fatal collision between cars at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 1955. However, this prohibition does not extend to events where drivers compete only indirectly via the clock. Events such as rallies, hillclimbs and slaloms are very popular, including the FIA European Hill Climb Championship.

The most known hillclimb races are the Gurnigelrennen, the course en côte Ayent – Anzère, the course en côte St. Ursanne – Les Rangiers, and the historic Klausen Hill Climb known as the Klausenpassrennen. Ludovico Scarfiotti clinched the European hillclimb championship at Ollon-Villars on August 30, 1965, driving a Dino Ferrari 2-litre.

===Canada===
Canada&#x27;s best known hillclimb event is the Knox Mountain Hillclimb, held in Kelowna, British Columbia. It is a paved road, climbing . It has run annually since the 1950s, attracting drivers from the Pacific Northwest.

===United States===
* The Pikes Peak International Hill Climb is one of the most internationally recognised hillclimbs. Winners include Indy 500 driver Bobby Unser and world rally champions Walter Röhrl, Stig Blomqvist, Ari Vatanen and Sébastien Loeb.
* The Sports Car Club of Americas, Appalachian HillClimb Series is a nationally recognized hillclimb organization. Mainly competing on hills in the south eastern part of the country (NC, VA, KY), drivers from the west and further north in Canada have participated in one or more events hosted by AHS. Hundreds of drivers have looked to compete, but with limited driver openings and quick sellouts, the Series has seen an uptick in spectating interest and event volunteerism.

===Mexico===

Hillclimb races were held in México in the 1960s and 1970s in places like El Chico, Puebla and Lagunas de Zempoala.

On July 27, 1969, a very talented Mexican driver, Moisés Solana, died in the &quot;Hill Climb Valle de Bravo-Bosencheve&quot;.

Since September 30 2017, Pedro Vargas founded the San Pedro Martir Hill Climb; the event is held in the Mexican state of Baja California. The temporary course was set on the road to the National Astronomical Observatory situated on the San Pedro Mártir mountain range, on a stretch from km marker 50 to km marker 80. As of 2024, it is regarded as the longest hill climb in the world.
The overall ascent record was set by the late Carlin Dunne at 14&#x27; 58&quot; piloting a Honda CRF 450 c.c. supermoto.

==Oceania==

===Australia===
An Australian Hillclimb Championship was first staged in 1938 and has been contested annually since 1947.

Hillclimbing in Australia dates back to the early 1900s, and was most prevalent in the city of Melbourne, at locations such as Templestowe, Heidelberg and Rob Roy.

The course at Templestowe still exists today in the Domain Wetlands. The course was never trafficable due to the massive incline known as &quot;the wall&quot;, with an incline ratio of 1:2.5 is thought to be the steepest bitumen surface in Australia, and so was only used during race events.
Burgundy Street in Heidelberg was used for early Hillclimbs.

The course at Rob Roy hosts race meets regularly, including rounds of the Victorian Hillclimb Championships. It is located just off Clintons Road, Christmas Hills in an area of Smiths Gully known as Rob Roy.

Mount Tarrengower, near Maldon in Central Victoria, has an annual Hillclimb hosted by the Victorian Vintage Sports Car Club, Bendigo Light Car Club and the Historic Motorcycle Racing Association of Victoria. The event is held on the 3rd weekend of October. It is now a &quot;classics&quot; only event, after a serious accident in the 1970s. Vintage motorcycles are now a feature of this event.

<doc id="1074941" wikidata="Q7042866" url="?curid=1074941" title="No. 111 Squadron RAF">
<text>Number 111 (Fighter) Squadron, also known as No. CXI (F) Squadron and nicknamed &quot;Treble One&quot;, was a squadron of the Royal Air Force. It was formed in 1917 in the Middle East as No. 111 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps during the reorganisation of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force after General Edmund Allenby took command during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The squadron remained in the Middle East after the end of the First World War until 1920 when it was renumbered as No. 14 Squadron.

The squadron was reformed in 1923. In World War II in 1940, it fought in the Battle of Britain. In late 1941 it moved to the Mediterranean, where it was involved in the North African Campaign and then the Allied invasion of Sicily and the Allied invasion of Italy. Disbanded in the years after the war, the squadron reformed in 1953 with jets.

Operating the Hawker Hunter, No. 111 Squadron provided an aerobatic display team – the Black Arrows. It also performed aerobatics when it re-equipped with the Lightning interceptor. The Squadron moved to Scotland in 1975, shortly after changing to flying Phantoms. In 1990 the squadron began flying the air defence variant of the Panavia Tornado. It operated the Panavia Tornado F3 in air defence from RAF Leuchars, Scotland until March 2011, when the squadron was disbanded, ending Tornado F3 service in the RAF.

==History==

===First World War===

No. 111 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps was formed at Deir el-Balah, Palestine, on 1 August 1917, under the command of Major Shekleton, with a mixed bag of single seat fighters as the first dedicated fighter squadron in the region. Its mission was to restrict enemy reconnaissance flights and challenge the German fighter presence over Suez. It was reinforced by Bristol F.2 Fighters in September, one of these claiming the first aerial victory for No. 111 Squadron on 8 October. The squadron began to receive the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a in October 1917. The same month also saw a change of command with Major Shekleton was replaced by Major Strent, after Shekleton became Commander of the 40th (Army) Wing. By December, No. 111 Squadron was based at Julis.

The squadron handed over its Bristol Fighters to No. 1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps in February 1918, becoming completely equipped with single seat fighters. In Spring 1918, while based at Ramleh, Major Strent was replaced in command by Major Hereward de Havilland, younger brother of aircraft designer Geoffrey de Havilland. In September 1918, &quot;Treble One&quot; participated in the Battle of Megiddo, tasked with attacking the German airfield at Jenin. By the time the Armistice with Turkey ended the war in the Middle East in October, No. 111 Squadron had claimed 44 enemy aircraft destroyed and a further 13 forced down for the loss of two pilots killed in combat, one prisoner and three wounded. The squadron had produced four aces: Austin Lloyd Fleming, future Air Marshal Peter Roy Maxwell Drummond, Charles Davidson, and Arthur Peck.

===Inter-War===

&quot;Treble One&quot; moved to Egypt after the War ended and then to Ramla in Palestine on 6 February 1919, re-equipping with the Bristol Fighter. On 1 February 1920, the squadron renumbered to No. 14 Squadron. On 1 October 1923, No. 111 Squadron reformed at RAF Duxford, equipped with a single flight of six Gloster Grebe fighters, the first Grebes to enter service with the RAF. These were supplemented by a second flight of First World War-vintage Sopwith Snipes in April 1924, and by a third flight of Armstrong Whitworth Siskins in June 1924, completely equipping itself with Siskins in January 1925. The squadron, tasked with defending London, replaced its Siskins with Bristol Bulldogs in January–February 1931, with its Siskins being passed on to No. 19 Squadron. The squadron moved to RAF Northolt in July 1934 and re-equipped with Gloster Gauntlets in May–June 1936. The squadron became the first Hawker Hurricane squadron in January 1938.

===Second World War===

====1939–1940====

Still based at RAF Northolt at the outbreak of war, No. 111 (Fighter) Squadron relocated to RAF Acklington, Northumberland, in October 1939. The squadron scored its first victory on 29 November, when Sqn. Ldr. Broadhurst shot down a Heinkel He 111. &quot;Treble One&quot; moved even further north to RAF Drem, East Lothian, in December 1939 in order to provide cover for the Royal Navy at Scapa Flow. By May 1940, No. 111 (F) Squadron had returned south to RAF Northolt due to the German invasion of France. On 16 May, a flight from No. 111 (F) Squadron joined a flight from No. 253 Squadron to form a joint unit, with one half deploying to France and the other remaining in Britain. &quot;Treble One&quot; flew defensive flights during the Dunkirk evacuation.

No. 111 (Fighter) Squadron played a role in the Battle of Britain while based at RAF Croydon, pioneering dangerous head-on attacks against the Luftwaffe bomber streams. However, after suffering heavy losses in August 1940, the unit was rotated north in September to RAF Drem. Claims included 47 aircraft shot down for 18 Hurricanes lost.

====1941–1945====
The squadron replaced its Hurricanes with Supermarine Spitfires in April 1941. In November, &quot;Treble One&quot; again relocated to RAF Gibraltar for support of Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa. Under the command of Squadron Leader George Hill it moved to Malta in June 1943 to support Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily. No. 111 (F) Squadron moved through Italy with the advancing Allied ground forces and remained there until the end of the war, after which it moved to Austria. The squadron disbanded in May 1947. 269 aircraft were claimed shot down, making the squadron one of the top RAF scorers for the war.

===Cold War===
The squadron was not reactivated until 2 December 1953 when it received Gloster Meteor F.8s at RAF North Weald. The Meteors were soon replaced with Hawker Hunters and &quot;Treble One&quot; moved to RAF Wattisham, Suffolk. They achieved international acclaim with their &#x27;Black Arrows&#x27; aerobatic display team using the Hawker Hunter, under the command of Squadron Leader Roger Topp.

The squadron received the all-weather English Electric Lightning fighter in 1962 which it operated for 12 years. In 1965, under Squadron Leader George Black (later AVM) and fully equipped with Lightning F3&#x27;s, it was chosen to provide a combined display with the Red Arrows for the Paris Air Show in June of that year. During the 2 to 3 months workup of the Diamond Nine formation plus a solo aerobatics Lightning, the squadron fielded 10 aircraft per day, a remarkable achievement for what was a somewhat difficult aircraft to service. In 1974, the squadron moved from RAF Wattisham after almost 18 years and re-equipped with the McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR.2 at RAF Coningsby, before moving north to RAF Leuchars on 3 November 1975.

===Tornado F.3 (1990–2011)===

The squadron began to re-equip with the Tornado F.3 in 1990. Throughout its time at Leuchars the No. 111 (F) Squadron was tasked with the maintenance of Quick Reaction Alert, which involves keeping aircraft at a high state of readiness to intercept, identify and, should it be necessary, destroy hostile aircraft approaching UK airspace. The squadron was involved in Operation Deny Flight and Operation Deliberate Force over Bosnia, Operations Bolton and Resinate in the Middle East and regularly participated in major Air Defence exercises, both in the UK and abroad.

Led by Wing Commander Rob Birch, No. 111 (Fighter) Squadron was involved in Operation Telic where it formed the major part of the Tornado F3 Wing at Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia.

Following the disbandment of No. 43 Squadron in July 2009, &quot;Treble One&quot; was the sole RAF Tornado F3 unit. The squadron disbanded at RAF Leuchars on 22 March 2011.

<doc id="1074945" wikidata="Q2086395" url="?curid=1074945" title="Dunkeld Cathedral">
<text>Dunkeld Cathedral is a Church of Scotland place of worship which stands on the north bank of the River Tay in Dunkeld, Perth and Kinross, Scotland. Built in square-stone style of predominantly grey sandstone, the cathedral proper began in 1260 and completed in 1501. It stands on the site of the former Culdee Monastery of Dunkeld, stones from which can be seen as an irregular reddish streak in the eastern gable.

It is not formally a &#x27;cathedral&#x27;, as the Church of Scotland nowadays has neither cathedrals nor bishops, but it is one of a number of similar former cathedrals which has continued to carry the name.

==History==

Because of the long construction period, the cathedral shows mixed architecture. Gothic and Norman elements are intermingled throughout the structure. Although partly in ruins, the cathedral is in regular use today and is open to the public.

Relics of Saint Columba, including his bones, were said to have been kept at Dunkeld until the Reformation, at which time they were removed to Ireland. Some believe there are still undiscovered Columban relics buried within the cathedral grounds.

The original monastery at Dunkeld dated from the sixth or early seventh century, founded after an expedition of Saint Columba to the Land of Alba. It was at first a simple collection of wattle huts. During the ninth century Causantín mac Fergusa constructed a more substantial cathedral of reddish sandstone and declared Dunkeld to hold the Primacy (centre) of the faith in Alba.

For reasons not completely understood, the Celtic bell believed to have been used at the monastery is not preserved in the cathedral. Instead, it was used in the Little Dunkeld Church, the parish church of the district of Minor or Lesser Dunkeld. Possibly this was because the later canons regarded Culdeeism as heresy and refused relics or saints of that discipline.

In the 17th century, the Bishopric of Dunkeld became an appendage of the Crown and subsequently descended to the Earls of Fife. Dunkeld Cathedral is today a Crown property, through Historic Environment Scotland, and a scheduled monument.

In 1689 the Battle of Dunkeld was fought around the cathedral between the Jacobite Highland clans loyal to James II and VII – deposed in the Glorious Revolution the previous year – and a government force supporting William III and II, with the latter winning the day.

==Parish==
Dunkeld Cathedral is still used as the town&#x27;s Church of Scotland parish church, with services every Sunday (although the congregation uses the smaller &quot;Little Dunkeld&quot; Church during winter months.) The current minister (since 2001) is the Reverend R. Fraser Penny.

The small Chapter House Museum offers a collection of relics from monastic and medieval times, and local history exhibits.

==Burials==

Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, known as &quot;the Wolf of Badenoch&quot;, was buried in the cathedral following his death in 1394, where his tomb, surmounted by his armoured effigy, can still be seen.

Other noteworthy burials include:
*John Scotus, (1183–1203)
*Geoffrey de Liberatione, Bishop of Dunkeld (1236/7–1249)
*Richard de Inverkeithing, a chamberlain of King Alexander II of Scotland and Bishop of Dunkeld (1250/2–1272)
*William Sinclair, Bishop of Dunkeld (1309–1337)
*Michael de Monymusk, Bishop of Dunkeld (1370–1376)
*The 1st Earl of Atholl (c. 1440–1512)
*Robert Cockburn, Bishop of Dunkeld (1524–1526)
*Charles Edward Stuart, Count Roehenstart (1784–1854)

<text>Jeffrey Charles Weaver (born August 22, 1976) is an American former right-handed Major League Baseball pitcher. During his career, he pitched for the Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, St. Louis Cardinals, and Seattle Mariners. He is the older brother of fellow MLB pitcher Jered Weaver.

==Amateur career==
Weaver, a graduate of Simi Valley High School in Simi Valley, California, attended California State University, Fresno to play college baseball for the Fresno State Bulldogs. In 1997, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League where he was named a league all-star. He also played for the United States in the 1996 Summer Olympics, winning a bronze medal.

==Professional career==

===Detroit Tigers===
The Detroit Tigers selected Weaver in the first round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft. He made his major league debut a year later. He was the Tigers&#x27; Opening Day starter in and . During the 2002 season, he was traded to the New York Yankees in a three team deal that also involved the Oakland Athletics and Yankees prospects John-Ford Griffin, Jason Arnold, and Ted Lilly.

===New York Yankees===
Weaver&#x27;s time with the Yankees was very turbulent, bouncing in and out of the starting rotation. In Game 4 of the 2003 World Series, he allowed a 12th inning walk-off home run to Álex González.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
Following the 2003 season, the Yankees traded Weaver to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Kevin Brown.

In , he went 14-11, with a 4.22 ERA, a 1.17 WHIP, three complete games and a career-high 157 strikeouts in 224 innings. Following the 2005 season, Weaver filed for free agency. The Dodgers offered him salary arbitration, but the two parties were unable to reach an agreement.

===Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim===
On February 15, 2006, Weaver signed a one-year deal with the Angels for $8.5 million. After posting a 3-10 record with a 6.29 ERA in Anaheim, he was designated for assignment on June 30. In a bit of a coincidence, his younger brother, Jered, was recalled from the minor leagues and replaced Jeff in the starting rotation.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
On July 5, 2006, the St. Louis Cardinals acquired Weaver from the Angels in exchange for minor leaguer Terry Evans and cash considerations. He debuted with the team as a pinch hitter in a 14-inning game between the Cardinals and Dodgers on July 13, 2006, at Busch Stadium.

Jered and Jeff both appeared in the September 11, 2006, issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; that chronicled how Jeff Weaver&#x27;s trade impacted Jeff and Jered both baseball-wise and in life away from the game. The younger Weaver was disappointed that his brother left without being around to see him make history by winning his first nine career decisions.

After yielding six runs in four innings in his first start, Weaver played a key role in the Cardinals&#x27; World Series win. He won important games for the Cardinals in the final weeks of the season, helping them win the National League Central Division, and he started and won Game 2 of the 2006 National League Division Series. Weaver started and was the losing pitcher for Game 1 of the National League Championship Series against the New York Mets on October 12, 2006. He pitched five scoreless innings before giving up a two-run home run to Mets center fielder Carlos Beltrán in the sixth inning; as the Cards lost 2-0.

In Game 5 of the National League Championship Series on October 17, 2006, Weaver pitched six innings, allowing two runs on six hits, winning his second game of the 2006 postseason.

After losing Game 2 of the 2006 World Series to the Detroit Tigers, Weaver came back on October 27 in Game 5 to pitch eight innings, giving up four hits and one earned run. He was credited with the win as the Cardinals clinched the series 4-1.

===Seattle Mariners===
On January 26, 2007, the Seattle Mariners signed Weaver as a free agent to a one-year deal worth $8–9 million. Weaver had a 14.32 ERA with only 22 innings pitched after six starts and was placed on the 15-day disabled list with &quot;right shoulder tendinitis&quot;. It was speculated that this was a strategic move by the team to allow Weaver to take some time off and make a series of &quot;rehab&quot; starts with a minor league affiliate. The hope was that he would be able to work out his problems without adversely impacting the Major League ball club; it seemed to work as Weaver pitched more effectively after his return. On June 20 versus the Pittsburgh Pirates, Weaver posted a four-hit, 7–0 shutout, which was his first win with Seattle. Although he pitched well in July and August, Weaver finished with a 7–13 record and 6.20 ERA and became a free agent after the season.

===Back in the minors===

On April 15, 2008, Weaver signed a minor league deal with the Milwaukee Brewers. However, after pitching in just nine minor league games, Weaver requested and was granted a release from his contract. On July 5, Weaver signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians, but did not appear in the majors with them, spending the rest of the season in AAA with the Buffalo Bisons.

===Return to the Dodgers===
Weaver signed a minor-league deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers in February 2009 and was assigned to the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes. After a few appearances with the Isotopes, Weaver was recalled to the Dodgers on April 30 and he pitched four scoreless innings of relief against the San Diego Padres, his first appearance in a Major League game since 2007. He made his first start of 2009 vs. the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 5 and allowed one run and struck out six in five innings.

On June 20, 2009, Jeff Weaver started for the Dodgers against the Los Angeles Angels. The opposing starter was his younger brother Jered Weaver. This was the first pitching matchup between brothers since 2002 when Andy and Alan Benes matched up and only the 15th such game since 1967. The Dodgers won 6-4, with Jeff getting the win and Jered taking the loss.

On October 7, 2009, Weaver was the winning pitcher in Game One of the 2009 National League Division Series between the Dodgers and his former team, the St. Louis Cardinals. It was the fourth post-season victory of his career. Weaver returned to the Dodgers for the 2010 season on another minor league contract. He once more made the opening day roster as a reliever.

On May 7, 2010, Weaver picked up his 100th career victory in a relief outing against the Colorado Rockies. He appeared in 43 games with the Dodgers in 2010, all in relief, and finished 5-1 with a 6.09 ERA. He became a free agent following the season.

==Post-baseball career==

===Oaks Christian School===
On September 28, 2016, Weaver was hired as the pitching coach for the Oaks Christian School varsity baseball team to work alongside head coach Royce Clayton.

<doc id="1074948" wikidata="Q7548711" url="?curid=1074948" title="Snowshoe Mountain">
<text>Snowshoe Mountain is a ski resort in the eastern United States, located in Snowshoe, West Virginia. The resort has skiable terrain across and covers a total area of in the Allegheny Mountains, which are a part of the vast Appalachian Mountain Range. It is positioned in the bowl shaped convergence of two mountains, Cheat and Back Allegheny, at the head of the Shavers Fork of the Cheat River. 

The Village at Snowshoe is located close to the summit of the mountain, rather than at its base. While Snowshoe is still best known for its winter activities, today the resort has extensive mountain biking trails, a popular golf course designed by Gary Player, wedding and convention areas, a number of summer outdoor activities, and also hosts a Grand National Cross Country Racing event each year. The resort comprises the Snowshoe and Silver Creek ski areas. About 480,000 skiers visit the resort each year, primarily from the larger cities of the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast and from across West Virginia.

==Mountain==

Snowshoe Mountain is the name of the resort, not the name of the mountain itself; the resort is located on Cheat Mountain. Cheat&#x27;s privately owned highpoint is Thorny Flat, which reaches an elevation of . The resort makes up in total, which includes the Snowshoe Mountain and Silver Creek areas; the mountains have a total of 60 slopes and trails plus many acres of backcountry. Two trails, Cupp Run and Shay&#x27;s Revenge, have a vertical drop, the highest in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. The former was designed in part by Jean-Claude Killy, the triple gold medalist at the 1968 Winter Olympics. The mountain summit receives an average of of snowfall each winter.

Snowshoe had originally been envisioned as a four season destination, although it would take years for mountain bike and horseback riding trails to become a significant draw. One key advantage for the mountain has continued to be its lower temperatures, due to its elevation. With a mean temperature of in January and in July, Snowshoe can be considerably cooler than nearby areas at lower elevations.

The resort has a base of 1,400 condominium and lodge hotel units, most of which are independently owned but managed by the resort. The average winter season is just slightly more than 130 days each year, while the spring, summer, and fall seasons typically include a series of sports, recreation, and cultural events.

==History==

Snowshoe Mountain opened for skiing on December 13, 1974. The area had been logged from about 1905 to 1960, after which it was virtually barren and abandoned. Thomas &quot;Doc&quot; Brigham discovered the mountain and believed it would be a good location to build a new ski resort. Brigham, a dentist from North Carolina, had previously opened the Sugar Mountain and Beech Mountain ski areas.

The ski trails and lifts were given names that recalled the local history of logging, such as Grab Hammer, J-Hook, Ball Hooter, and Skidder. Two trails, Shay&#x27;s Revenge and Heisler Way, were named for brands of gear-driven steam locomotives that ferried men and logs around the mountains during the logging era. Examples of these locomotives now push tourist excursion trains (the cars themselves were once logging flat cars) on adjacent land at nearby Cass Scenic Railroad State Park.

Although Brigham had high hopes for Snowshoe, the mountain went through a difficult first decade plagued by financial problems. Over the next several years, though, the resort&#x27;s reputation and popularity would grow, and in 1992 it purchased the Silver Creek ski area which is just a half mile away.
The resort was purchased in 1990 by Tokyo Tower Development Company Limited, a Japanese developer of leisure and recreational facilities. Five years later in 1995, it was sold to Intrawest, a Canadian ski-resort operator which had become well known for expanding mountain resorts through village-style commercial and condominium real estate development. In 1999, Intrawest opened the Rimfire Lodge, its first development in what it called &quot;The Wildcat Village&quot; (a name which later fell out of use). The village expanded rapidly, with additional condominium-hotel developments opening over the coming years, including Highland House, two phases of Allegheny Springs, The Seneca, and Expedition Station. One development, Eight Rivers, was to have broken ground in 2007, but the project was eventually postponed and the land area is now used by a small surface ski lift used, in part, by the resort&#x27;s ski school. In 2017, Intrawest was acquired by Alterra Mountain Company.

In addition to the central village, Intrawest has also assisted developing &quot;outside neighborhoods,&quot; including Soaring Eagle Lodge in 2006 and Sawmill Village in 2007, both of which were developed independently. In 2006, Intrawest was acquired by the private equity firm Fortress Investment Group. Intrawest continues to operate as an independent unit of Fortress.

<text>Grégoire Kayibanda (1 May 192415 December 1976) was a Rwandan politician and revolutionary who was the first elected President of Rwanda from 1962 to 1973. An ethnic Hutu, he was a pioneer of the Rwandan Revolution and led Rwanda&#x27;s struggle for independence from Belgium, replacing the Tutsi monarchy with a republican form of government. Rwanda became independent from Belgium in 1962, with Kayibanda serving as the country&#x27;s first president, establishing a pro-Hutu policy and a &quot;de facto&quot; one-party system governed by his party, Parmehutu. He was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état in 1973 by his defense minister, Juvénal Habyarimana, and died three years later.

== Early life and education ==
Kayibanda was born on 1 May 1924 in Tare, Rwanda. He studied his primary school at Tare then at Kabgayi. Kayibanda was admitted in Saint Léon Minor Seminary of Kabgayi in 1937. After the completion of minor seminary in 1943, he continued to Major Seminary of Nyakibanda where he studied for four years. 

== Background ==
The Hutu majority had long been resentful of power held by the Tutsi minority. They were encouraged by Hutu advocates in the Catholic Church, and by Christian Belgians, who were increasingly influential in the Congo. The United Nations mandates, the Tutsi elite class, and the Belgian colonists contributed to the growing social and political unrest. Gregoire Kayibanda, an ethnic Hutu, led the Hutu &quot;emancipation&quot; movement. He founded the political party &quot;Parmehutu&quot; (&quot;Parti du Mouvement de l&#x27;Emancipation Hutu&quot;; Hutu Emancipation Movement Party), and wrote his &quot;Bahutu Manifesto&quot; in 1957.

In reaction, in 1959 Tutsis founded the UNAR party, made up of those who desired immediate independence for Ruanda-Urundi based on the existing Tutsi monarchy. This group also became quickly militarized. Skirmishes began between UNAR and PARMEHUTU groups. Kayibanda&#x27;s successful campaign brought the majority Hutu to power for the first time in Rwanda.

In 1961 the Rwandan monarchy was dissolved and a brief transitional administration was led by Dominique Mbonyumutwa. Rwanda became independent at midnight on 1 July 1962. Kayibanda spoke at ceremonies later that day to commemorate the occasion, thanking the people who had contributed to the country&#x27;s independence. He also thanked the work of the Belgians, Germans, and United Nations in developing the country. He said, &quot;Though the Belgians made some mistakes here, the net result of their effort has been most positive,&quot; and appealed to them and other countries for technical aid. He led Rwanda&#x27;s first delegation to the United Nations General Assembly on 18 September. Kayibanda was elected president on 26 October. Over the next three years, Kayibanda increased his power step by step. By 1965, Parmehutu was the only legal party in the country. At elections held that year, Kayibanda appeared alone on the ballot for president. He was reelected in 1969, again as the only candidate. In both elections, a single list of Parmehutu candidates was returned to the legislature. The 1962 constitution of Rwanda, enacted by Kayibanda&#x27;s regime, proscribed communist activities and propaganda as Belgian settlers conditioned the gain of independence to the rejection of Communism, in the era of the iron curtain. The UNAR party threatened to turn their back on the Belgians and adhere to communism.

Kayibanda pursued a pro-Western, anticommunist foreign policy. Rwanda enjoyed cordial relations with the Republic of China, while strongly criticizing the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s policies in Africa. Kayibanda&#x27;s government adopted a generally neutral stance on the Arab–Israeli conflict and the Vietnam War.

In the presidential elections of 1973 a project promulgated on 18 May was presented, the duration of the presidential term of Kabiyanda was extended from 4 to 5 years, and the age limit of 60 years was eliminated. With North-South regionalist rivalries, President Kayibanda&#x27;s regime was accused of having progressively dismissed the political leaders of the north and of concentrating power in the hands of the nationals of his native prefecture, Gitarama.

== Death ==
On 5 July 1973 defense minister Major General Juvénal Habyarimana overthrew Kayibanda in a military coup. Although described as bloodless, as a result of the coup, an estimated 55 people, mostly officials, lawyers or businessmen close to the previous regime, were reportedly executed. The families of these people were given sums of money to pay for their silence. The new government held Kayibanda and his wife in a secret location (rumored to be a house near Kabgayi), where they were reportedly &quot;starved to death&quot;.

<doc id="1074967" wikidata="Q662927" url="?curid=1074967" title="Whammy!">
<text>Whammy! is the third studio album by American new wave band the B-52&#x27;s, released on April 27, 1983, by Warner Bros. Records. It was recorded at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, in December 1982 and produced by Steven Stanley. The album spawned three singles: &quot;Legal Tender&quot;, &quot;Whammy Kiss&quot;, and &quot;Song for a Future Generation&quot;. 

The album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 twice in 1983, reaching both number 29 and 171 throughout the year, while &quot;Legal Tender&quot; reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, as well as the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play Singles chart alongside its two respective singles.

The band&#x27;s goal with &quot;Whammy!&quot; was to update their signature sound with drum machines and synthesizers. The album was also the first to feature vocal performances by all five members of the band, as exemplified in &quot;Song for a Future Generation&quot;. This was the final album the B-52s released before guitarist and founding member Ricky Wilson died of AIDS in 1985, although he appears posthumously on their next studio album, &quot;Bouncing Off the Satellites&quot; (1986).

==Recording==
The B-52&#x27;s initially conceived &quot;Whammy!&quot; in early 1982, during a visit to Compass Point Studios, where the band commenced re-recordings of three unreleased songs: &quot;Butterbean&quot;, &quot;Big Bird&quot;, and &quot;Queen of Las Vegas&quot;. All three tracks were originally intended to be included on their previous release, &quot;Mesopotamia&quot; (1982), but none were completed, due to pressure and time constraints from Warner Bros. and their manager Gary Kurfirst. The album&#x27;s remaining six songs (&quot;Legal Tender&quot;, &quot;Whammy Kiss&quot;, &quot;Song for a Future Generation&quot;, &quot;Trism&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry&quot;, and &quot;Work That Skirt&quot;) were recorded in December 1982, again at Compass Point Studios.

Unlike their previous studio albums, all instruments on &quot;Whammy!&quot; were played exclusively by Keith Strickland and Ricky Wilson. Both played the guitar and keyboards, while Strickland played the drums and Wilson played the bass. Remarking on the band&#x27;s new focus on electronic instrumentation, singer/instrumentalist Kate Pierson later called the recording &quot;a transitional album.&quot; Additionally, Pierson stated that drummer Strickland &quot;didn&#x27;t want to play drums anymore, so &quot;Whammy!&quot; featured drum machines and some synthesizers. It was kind of a big change in sound, which I wasn&#x27;t really for very much. I didn&#x27;t really like the drum machine. It was a different sound, but &quot;Whammy!&quot; was very much based around that&quot;. However, she added that, during the subsequent concert tour, the band would alternate between using drum machines and live drums played by Strickland.

Producer Steven Stanley supported Wilson and Strickland&#x27;s initial concept of mixing the album into one continuous track, in a manner similar to the band&#x27;s remix album, &quot;Party Mix!&quot; (1981). However, both Kurfirst and Warner Brothers vetoed this decision in favor of a more traditional method of track sequencing.

==Release==
The album was released on April 27, 1983. On initial pressings of the LP, the seventh track was &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry&quot;, a cover version of the Yoko Ono song &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, Kyoko (Mummy&#x27;s Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)&quot;. However, the song was removed on later pressings due to legal issues and replaced with &quot;Moon 83&quot;. The song is a remake of their earlier track &quot;There&#x27;s a Moon in the Sky (Called the Moon)&quot; from the band&#x27;s 1979 eponymous debut studio album, released as the B-side of the &quot;Legal Tender&quot; single.

==Reception==
===Commercial===
&quot;Whammy!&quot; was a commercial success, spawning the hit singles &quot;Legal Tender&quot;, &quot;Whammy Kiss&quot;, and &quot;Song for a Future Generation&quot;. The album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 twice in 1983, reaching both number 29 and 171 throughout the year, while &quot;Legal Tender&quot; reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, as well as the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play Singles chart alongside &quot;Whammy Kiss&quot; and &quot;Song for a Future Generation&quot;.

===Critical===

Critical reception for &quot;Whammy!&quot; was positive at the time of its release. Most critics regarded the album as a return to form after the band&#x27;s previous release, &quot;Mesopotamia&quot;, which they felt strayed too far from the band&#x27;s signature sound. Praise was given to the drum machines and synthesizers, which created upbeat and highly danceable songs, as well as the tight lyrics and over the top vocals. 

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Christopher Connelly, while referring to &quot;Mesopotamia&quot; as &quot;underrated&quot;, was pleased with the band&#x27;s return to their trademark style, and felt that even with the addition of Devo-style keyboards, producer Steven Stanley had &quot;kept the band&#x27;s basic strengths intact: breakneck tempos, deliciously uninhibited singing and an earnest enthusiasm for some of the universe&#x27;s less-celebrated pleasures&quot;. He particularly praised Pierson, Wilson, and Schneider&#x27;s vocals. While remarking that the entirety of side two is &quot;a waste&quot;, he concluded, &quot;What is important is that this band is having fun again - and in this age of dopey novelty songs and cheesy dance tracks, nobody does it better.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; continued his support, making it a &quot;Pick Hit&quot; and stating that while the band &quot;still pick up some great ideas at interplanetary garage sales, their celebration of the pop mess-around is getting earthier.&quot;

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic later said the album was &quot;certainly entertaining, even with its faults,&quot; praising the songs &quot;Legal Tender&quot;, &quot;Whammy Kiss&quot;, &quot;Butterbean&quot;, and &quot;Song for a Future Generation&quot;, and overall regarding the album as a strong follow-up to &quot;Mesopotamia&quot;, though he criticized the album&#x27;s overuse of drum machines and synthesizers. Ben Wener of &quot;The Spectator&quot; commented favorably on &quot;Whammy!&quot;, describing it as an &quot;overlooked gem&quot;.

<text>Antoine Pevsner (12 April 1962) was a Russian-born sculptor and the older brother of Alexii Pevsner and Naum Gabo. As the originators of Constructivism and pioneers of Kinetic Art, The brothers are considered pioneers of twentieth-century sculpture, with numerous prominent pieces, e.g., Antoine&#x27;s widely known sculpture, &quot;The Flight of the Bird&quot;, located at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. 

== Biography ==

Pevsner was born as Natan Borisovich Pevzner in Oryol, Russian Empire, into a Jewish family. Among the originators of and having coined the term, Constructivism, and pioneers of Kinetic Art, Pevsner and his brother Naum Gabo discovered a new use for metals and welding and made a new marriage of art and mathematics. Pevsner said: &quot;Art must be inspiration controlled by mathematics. I have a need for peace, symphony, orchestration.&quot; He was one of the first to use the blowtorch in sculpture, welding copper rods onto sculptural forms and along with his brother, Naum, he issued the Realist Manifesto in 1920.

He left the Soviet Union in 1923 and moved to Paris, where he would live for the rest of his life. 

Among the honors he received were a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris (1956-7) and the Legion of Honour (1961).

<text>William Vestey, 1st Baron Vestey (21 January 1859 – 10 December 1940), was an English shipping magnate.

==Biography==

===Early life===
William Vestey was born on 21 January 1859. He came from an old Liverpool family of traders. In 1876, at the age of seventeen, he was sent to Chicago by his father Samuel Vestey, a provisioner of Liverpool.

===Career===
He first managed a meat canning factory that was financed by his father. Together with his younger brother Edmund, he established Vestey Brothers (which later became the Vestey Group) in 1897 from a family butchery business in Liverpool. They were pioneers of refrigeration, opening a cold store in London in 1895.

The Vestey brothers then went to South America in an attempt to make a fortune because the economy there was booming. They started by buying game birds and storing them in the cold stores of American companies before shipping them to Liverpool. These early activities soon developed into importing beef and beef products into the UK, which in turn led to them owning cattle ranches in Brazil, Venezuela and Australia, and their own meat processing factories in Argentina, Uruguay (Frigorífico Anglo del Uruguay), New Zealand and Australia. In 1914, they built a meat processing works at Bullocky Point, Darwin, Australia, but closed its operations in 1920 after the Darwin Rebellion.

They acquired the Wave Hill Station in the Northern Territory of Australia, in 1914. At that time, legislation permitted Aboriginal Australian workers to be paid in tea, tobacco and other rations. The Vesteys refused to pay their workers in wages, leading to tensions and arguments from the beginning, which continued until the Wave Hill walk-off, a strike beginning in 1967 and lasting eight years.

In 1915, the brothers, after being refused a request for income tax exemption made to David Lloyd George, moved to Buenos Aires to avoid paying income tax in the UK. The family later administered the business through a Paris trust that enabled it to legally avoid UK tax until the loophole was closed in 1991. From 1915 to 1918, they moved to Chicago then to Argentina and back to England. Lord Vestey later became an important benefactor to Liverpool Cathedral, where he funded the building of the bell tower.

===First World War and peerage===
During the First World War another Vestey company, the Blue Star Line (now part of P&amp;O Nedlloyd), was a major supplier of Argentine beef to England, and it was for this service to the wartime provisioning of England that William Vestey was later raised to the peerage. He was made a Baronet of Bessémer House in the Metropoliton Borough of Camberwell on 21 June 1913, and Baron of Kingswood in the County of Surrey on 20 June 1922. 

His appointment occurred at the height of the honours scandal surrounding the sale of peerage, which implicated the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George. William Vestey was not consider worthy of ennoblement because the Vestey brothers had moved their meatpacking business out of the country during the First World War, to avoid paying millions of pounds in tax. Even though King George V opposed Sir William becoming a baron, he received the title from Lloyd George after paying a £20,000 political donation.

===Personal life===
His first wife died in 1923 and was buried in Liverpool Cathedral. He then married Evelene Brodstone of Superior, Nebraska, on 1 August 1924. She had been working as a stenographer with the Vestey Meat Packing Plant in Chicago, where she was spotted by his brother. She would rise through the company, eventually becoming the highest paid female executive in the world. She survived him following his death aged 81 in December 1940. His ashes were buried in Liverpool Cathedral. On 24 July 1941, the 2nd Lady Vestey was buried at Evergreen Cemetery of Superior in Nebraska. Each spring during memorial weekend, Superior holds the annual Lady Vestey Festival in her honour. This is the town&#x27;s largest annual celebration and it attracts many people from around the area.

<text>In physics, the Clebsch–Gordan (CG) coefficients are numbers that arise in angular momentum coupling in quantum mechanics. They appear as the expansion coefficients of total angular momentum eigenstates in an uncoupled tensor product basis. In more mathematical terms, the CG coefficients are used in representation theory, particularly of compact Lie groups, to perform the explicit direct sum decomposition of the tensor product of two irreducible representations (i.e., a reducible representation into irreducible representations, in cases where the numbers and types of irreducible components are already known abstractly). The name derives from the German mathematicians Alfred Clebsch and Paul Gordan, who encountered an equivalent problem in invariant theory.

From a vector calculus perspective, the CG coefficients associated with the SO(3) group can be defined simply in terms of integrals of products of spherical harmonics and their complex conjugates. The addition of spins in quantum-mechanical terms can be read directly from this approach as spherical harmonics are eigenfunctions of total angular momentum and projection thereof onto an axis, and the integrals correspond to the Hilbert space inner product. From the formal definition of angular momentum, recursion relations for the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients can be found. There also exist complicated explicit formulas for their direct calculation.

The formulas below use Dirac&#x27;s bra–ket notation and the Condon–Shortley phase convention is adopted.

== Review of the angular momentum operators ==

Angular momentum operators are self-adjoint operators , , and that satisfy the commutation relations
formula_1
where is the Levi-Civita symbol. Together the three operators define a &quot;vector operator&quot;, a rank one Cartesian tensor operator,
formula_2
It is also known as a spherical vector, since it is also a spherical tensor operator. It is only for rank one that spherical tensor operators coincide with the Cartesian tensor operators.

By developing this concept further, one can define another operator as the inner product of with itself:
formula_3
This is an example of a Casimir operator. It is diagonal and its eigenvalue characterizes the particular irreducible representation of the angular momentum algebra formula_4. This is physically interpreted as the square of the total angular momentum of the states on which the representation acts.

One can also define &quot;raising&quot; () and &quot;lowering&quot; () operators, the so-called ladder operators,
formula_5

== Spherical basis for angular momentum eigenstates ==

It can be shown from the above definitions that commutes with , , and :
formula_6

When two Hermitian operators commute, a common set of eigenstates exists. Conventionally, and are chosen. From the commutation relations, the possible eigenvalues can be found. These eigenstates are denoted where is the &quot;angular momentum quantum number&quot; and is the &quot;angular momentum projection&quot; onto the z-axis.

They comprise the spherical basis, are complete, and satisfy the following eigenvalue equations,
formula_7

The raising and lowering operators can be used to alter the value of ,
formula_8
where the ladder coefficient is given by:
In principle, one may also introduce a (possibly complex) phase factor in the definition of formula_9. The choice made in this article is in agreement with the Condon–Shortley phase convention. The angular momentum states are orthogonal (because their eigenvalues with respect to a Hermitian operator are distinct) and are assumed to be normalized,
formula_10

Here the italicized and denote integer or half-integer angular momentum quantum numbers of a particle or of a system. On the other hand, the roman , , , , , and denote operators. The formula_11 symbols are Kronecker deltas.

== Tensor product space ==
We now consider systems with two physically different angular momenta and . Examples include the spin and the orbital angular momentum of a single electron, or the spins of two electrons, or the orbital angular momenta of two electrons. Mathematically, this means that the angular momentum operators act on a space formula_12 of dimension formula_13 and also on a space formula_14 of dimension formula_15. We are then going to define a family of &quot;total angular momentum&quot; operators acting on the tensor product space formula_16, which has dimension formula_17. The action of the total angular momentum operator on this space constitutes a representation of the SU(2) Lie algebra, but a reducible one. The reduction of this reducible representation into irreducible pieces is the goal of Clebsch–Gordan theory.

Let be the -dimensional vector space spanned by the states
formula_18
and the -dimensional vector space spanned by the states
formula_19

The tensor product of these spaces, , has a -dimensional &quot;uncoupled&quot; basis
formula_20
Angular momentum operators are defined to act on states in in the following manner:
formula_21
and
formula_22
where denotes the identity operator.

The total angular momentum operators are defined by the coproduct (or tensor product) of the two representations acting on ,
The total angular momentum operators can be shown to &quot;satisfy the very same commutation relations&quot;, 
formula_23
where . Indeed, the preceding construction is the standard method for constructing an action of a Lie algebra on a tensor product representation.

Hence, a set of &quot;coupled&quot; eigenstates exist for the total angular momentum operator as well,
formula_24
for . Note that it is common to omit the part.

The total angular momentum quantum number must satisfy the triangular condition that
formula_25
such that the three nonnegative integer or half-integer values could correspond to the three sides of a triangle.

The total number of total angular momentum eigenstates is necessarily equal to the dimension of :
formula_26
As this computation suggests, the tensor product representation decomposes as the direct sum of one copy of each of the irreducible representations of dimension formula_27, where formula_28 ranges from formula_29 to formula_30 in increments of 1. As an example, consider the tensor product of the three-dimensional representation corresponding to formula_31 with the two-dimensional representation with formula_32. The possible values of formula_28 are then formula_34 and formula_35. Thus, the six-dimensional tensor product representation decomposes as the direct sum of a two-dimensional representation and a four-dimensional representation.

The goal is now to describe the preceding decomposition explicitly, that is, to explicitly describe basis elements in the tensor product space for each of the component representations that arise.

The total angular momentum states form an orthonormal basis of :
formula_36

These rules may be iterated to, e.g., combine doublets (=1/2) to obtain the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition series, (Catalan&#x27;s triangle),
formula_37
where formula_38 is the integer floor function; and the number preceding the boldface irreducible representation dimensionality () label indicates multiplicity of that representation in the representation reduction. For instance, from this formula, addition of three spin 1/2s yields a spin 3/2 and two spin 1/2s, formula_39.

== Formal definition of Clebsch–Gordan coefficients ==

The coupled states can be expanded via the completeness relation (resolution of identity) in the uncoupled basis

The expansion coefficients

formula_40

are the &quot;Clebsch–Gordan coefficients&quot;. Note that some authors write them in a different order such as . Another common notation is

Applying the operators

formula_41

to both sides of the defining equation shows that the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients can only be nonzero when

formula_42

== Recursion relations ==

The recursion relations were discovered by physicist Giulio Racah from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1941.

Applying the total angular momentum raising and lowering operatorsformula_43
to the left hand side of the defining equation givesformula_44
Applying the same operators to the right hand side givesformula_45
Combining these results gives recursion relations for the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients, where was defined in :
formula_46 

Taking the upper sign with the condition that gives initial recursion relation:formula_47In the Condon–Shortley phase convention, one adds the constraint that
:formula_48
(and is therefore also real).
The Clebsch–Gordan coefficients can then be found from these recursion relations. The normalization is fixed by the requirement that the sum of the squares, which equivalent to the requirement that the norm of the state must be one.

The lower sign in the recursion relation can be used to find all the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients with . Repeated use of that equation gives all coefficients.

This procedure to find the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients shows that they are all real in the Condon–Shortley phase convention.

== Explicit expression ==
== Orthogonality relations ==

These are most clearly written down by introducing the alternative notation
formula_49

The first orthogonality relation is
formula_50
(derived from the fact that formula_51) and the second one is
formula_52

== Special cases ==

For the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients are given by
formula_53

For and we have
formula_54

For and we have
formula_55

For we have
formula_56

For , we have
formula_57

For we have
formula_58

== Symmetry properties ==

formula_59

A convenient way to derive these relations is by converting the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients to Wigner 3-j symbols using . The symmetry properties of Wigner 3-j symbols are much simpler.

=== Rules for phase factors ===

Care is needed when simplifying phase factors: a quantum number may be a half-integer rather than an integer, therefore is not necessarily for a given quantum number unless it can be proven to be an integer. Instead, it is replaced by the following weaker rule:
formula_60
for any angular-momentum-like quantum number .

Nonetheless, a combination of and is always an integer, so the stronger rule applies for these combinations:
formula_61
This identity also holds if the sign of either or or both is reversed.

It is useful to observe that any phase factor for a given pair can be reduced to the canonical form:
formula_62
where and (other conventions are possible too). Converting phase factors into this form makes it easy to tell whether two phase factors are equivalent. (Note that this form is only &quot;locally&quot; canonical: it fails to take into account the rules that govern combinations of pairs such as the one described in the next paragraph.)

An additional rule holds for combinations of , , and that are related by a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient or Wigner 3-j symbol:
formula_63
This identity also holds if the sign of any is reversed, or if any of them are substituted with an instead.

== Relation to Wigner 3-j symbols ==

Clebsch–Gordan coefficients are related to Wigner 3-j symbols which have more convenient symmetry relations.
The factor is due to the Condon–Shortley constraint that , while is due to the time-reversed nature of .

This allows to reach the general expression:

:formula_64

The summation is performed over those integer values for which the argument of each factorial in the denominator is non-negative, i.e. summation limits and are taken equal: the lower one formula_65 the upper one formula_66 Factorials of negative numbers are conventionally taken equal to zero, so that the values of the 3&quot;j&quot; symbol at, for example, formula_67 or formula_68 are automatically set to zero.

== Relation to Wigner D-matrices ==

formula_69

== Relation to spherical harmonics ==

In the case where integers are involved, the coefficients can be related to integrals of spherical harmonics:
formula_70

It follows from this and orthonormality of the spherical harmonics that CG coefficients are in fact the expansion coefficients of a product of two spherical harmonics in terms of a single spherical harmonic:
formula_71

== Other properties ==
formula_72

== Clebsch–Gordan coefficients for specific groups ==

For arbitrary groups and their representations, Clebsch–Gordan coefficients are not known in general. However, algorithms to produce Clebsch–Gordan coefficients for the special unitary group SU(&quot;n&quot;) are known. In particular, SU(3) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients have been computed and tabulated because of their utility in characterizing hadronic decays, where a flavor-SU(3) symmetry exists that relates the up, down, and strange quarks. A web interface for tabulating SU(N) Clebsch–Gordan coefficients is readily available.

<text>Victor James William Patrick Daley (5 September 1858 – 29 December 1905) was an Australian poet. Daley serves chiefly as an example of the Celtic Twilight in Australian verse. He also serves as a lyrical alternative to his contemporary bush balladists of Henry Lawson, Banjo Paterson, and Will H. Ogilvie.
==Life==

Daley was born at the Navan, County Meath, Ireland, and was educated at the Christian Brothers at Devonport in England. He arrived in Australia in 1878, and became a freelance journalist and writer in both Melbourne and Sydney. Whilst in Melbourne, he met and became a friend of Marcus Clarke; later, in Sydney, he became acquainted with Henry Kendall. He is notable for becoming the first author in Australia who tried to earn a living from writing alone.

In Sydney in 1898, he founded the bohemian Dawn and Dusk Club, and the later Supper Club, which had many notable members such as writer Henry Lawson. Together with fellow notable poet Louise Mack, he organised the farewell dinner to Scottish-Australian poet and bush balladeer Will H. Ogilvie (1869–1963) in 1901 at the Hotel Australia, Sydney. Banjo Paterson and Roderic Quinn were also present at the send-off.

He used the pseudonym Creeve Roe (Irish for &quot;Red Branch&quot;, the area next to the Navan where Cú Chulainn trained as a Red Branch Knight), as well as his own name.

Daley died at his home in Waitara, Sydney of tuberculosis and was buried in the Roman Catholic section of Waverley Cemetery.

===Legacy===

His work was not considered particularly &quot;Australian&quot; in nature, but quite lyrical, with &#x27;natural delicacy of expression, graceful imagery, and refinement of language&#x27;. His &quot;Poems&quot; (1908) and other collections were published posthumously. Daley&#x27;s finest Australian work was considered to be &quot;&quot;.

When he died, Scottish-Australian poet and bush balladeer Will H. Ogilvie (1869–1963) penned:

:When &#x27;the little folk&#x27; meet by the red rowan tree
::The dance shall be stayed in the ring on the plot
:While they twine in his green Irish isle of the sea
::The wreath we forgot.

A memoir of Daley by Bertram Stevens was published in &quot;Wine and Roses&quot;.

<doc id="1074997" wikidata="Q631614" url="?curid=1074997" title="Lamb shift">
<text>In physics, the Lamb shift, named after Willis Lamb, is an anomalous difference in energy between two electron orbitals in a hydrogen atom. The difference was not predicted by theory and it cannot be derived from the Dirac equation, which predicts identical energies. Hence the Lamb &quot;shift&quot; is a deviation from theory seen in the differing energies contained by the 2&quot;S&quot;1/2 and 2&quot;P&quot;1/2 orbitals of the hydrogen atom.

The Lamb shift is caused by interactions between the virtual photons created through vacuum energy fluctuations and the electron as it moves around the hydrogen nucleus in each of these two orbitals. The Lamb shift has since played a significant role through vacuum energy fluctuations in theoretical prediction of Hawking radiation from black holes.

This effect was first measured in 1947 in the Lamb–Retherford experiment on the hydrogen microwave spectrum and this measurement provided the stimulus for renormalization theory to handle the divergences. It was the harbinger of modern quantum electrodynamics developed by Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman, Ernst Stueckelberg, Sin-Itiro Tomonaga and Freeman Dyson. Lamb won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1955 for his discoveries related to the Lamb shift. Victor Weisskopf regretted that his insecurity about his mathematical abilities may have cost him a Nobel Prize when he did not publish results (which turned out to be correct) about what is now known as the Lamb shift.

== Importance ==
In 1978, on Lamb&#x27;s 65th birthday, Freeman Dyson addressed him as follows: &quot;Those years, when the Lamb shift was the central theme of physics, were golden years for all the physicists of my generation. You were the first to see that this tiny shift, so elusive and hard to measure, would clarify our thinking about particles and fields.&quot;

== Derivation ==
This heuristic derivation of the electrodynamic level shift follows Theodore A. Welton&#x27;s approach.

The fluctuations in the electric and magnetic fields associated with the QED vacuum perturbs the electric potential due to the atomic nucleus. This perturbation causes a fluctuation in the position of the electron, which explains the energy shift. The difference of potential energy is given by

:formula_1

Since the fluctuations are isotropic,

:formula_2
:formula_3

So one can obtain

:formula_4

The classical equation of motion for the electron displacement (&quot;δr&quot;) induced by a single mode of the field of wave vector and frequency &quot;ν&quot; is

:formula_5

and this is valid only when the frequency &quot;ν&quot; is greater than &quot;ν&quot;0 in the Bohr orbit, formula_6. The electron is unable to respond to the fluctuating field if the fluctuations are smaller than the natural orbital frequency in the atom.

For the field oscillating at &quot;ν&quot;,

:formula_7

therefore

:formula_8

where formula_9 is some large normalization volume (the volume of the hypothetical &quot;box&quot; containing the hydrogen atom), and formula_10 denotes the hermitian conjugate of the preceding term. By the summation over all formula_11

:formula_12

This result diverges when no limits about the integral (at both large and small frequencies). As mentioned above, this method is expected to be valid only when formula_6, or equivalently formula_14. It is also valid only for wavelengths longer than the Compton wavelength, or equivalently formula_15. Therefore, one can choose the upper and lower limit of the integral and these limits make the result converge.

:formula_16.

For the atomic orbital and the Coulomb potential,

:formula_17

since it is known that

:formula_18

For &quot;p&quot; orbitals, the nonrelativistic wave function vanishes at the origin (at the nucleus), so there is no energy shift. But for &quot;s&quot; orbitals there is some finite value at the origin,

:formula_19

where the Bohr radius is

:formula_20

Therefore,

:formula_21.

Finally, the difference of the potential energy becomes:

:formula_22

where formula_23 is the fine-structure constant. This shift is about 500 MHz, within an order of magnitude of the observed shift of 1057 MHz. This is equal to an energy of only 7.00 x 10^-25 J., or 4.37 x 10^-6 eV. 

Welton&#x27;s heuristic derivation of the Lamb shift is similar to, but distinct from, the calculation of the Darwin term using Zitterbewegung, a contribution to the fine structure that is of lower order in formula_23 than the Lamb shift.

== Lamb–Retherford experiment ==
In 1947 Willis Lamb and Robert Retherford carried out an experiment using microwave techniques to stimulate radio-frequency transitions between
2&quot;S&quot;1/2 and 2&quot;P&quot;1/2 levels of hydrogen. By using lower frequencies than for optical transitions the Doppler broadening could be neglected (Doppler broadening is proportional to the frequency). The energy difference Lamb and Retherford found was a rise of about 1000 MHz (0.03 cm−1) of the 2&quot;S&quot;1/2 level above the 2&quot;P&quot;1/2 level.

This particular difference is a one-loop effect of quantum electrodynamics, and can be interpreted as the influence of virtual photons that have been emitted and re-absorbed by the atom. In quantum electrodynamics the electromagnetic field is quantized and, like the harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics, its lowest state is not zero. Thus, there exist small zero-point oscillations that cause the electron to execute rapid oscillatory motions. The electron is &quot;smeared out&quot; and each radius value is changed from &quot;r&quot; to &quot;r&quot; + &quot;δr&quot; (a small but finite perturbation).

The Coulomb potential is therefore perturbed by a small amount and the degeneracy of the two energy levels is removed. The new potential can be approximated (using atomic units) as follows:

:formula_25

The Lamb shift itself is given by

:formula_26

with &quot;k&quot;(&quot;n&quot;, 0) around 13 varying slightly with &quot;n&quot;, and

:formula_27

with log(&quot;k&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,)) a small number (approx. −0.05) making &quot;k&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,) close to unity.

For a derivation of Δ&quot;E&quot;Lamb see for example:

==In the hydrogen spectrum==

In 1947, Hans Bethe was the first to explain the Lamb shift in the hydrogen spectrum, and he thus laid the foundation for the modern development of quantum electrodynamics. Bethe was able to derive the Lamb shift by implementing the idea of mass renormalization, which allowed him to calculate the observed energy shift as the difference between the shift of a bound electron and the shift of a free electron. The Lamb shift currently provides a measurement of the fine-structure constant α to better than one part in a million, allowing a precision test of quantum electrodynamics.

<text>Süreyya Ayhan Kop (born September 6, 1978) is a Turkish former female middle distance track runner who specialised in the 1500 metres. In November 2009, she was banned for life by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) due to her second anti-doping rule violation.

Ayhan ran for the sports clubs MTA Ankara and Fenerbahçe Istanbul. She then joined the Gaziantep Metropolitan Municipality Sports Club. She holds Turkish records in 800 m (2:00.64) and 1500 m (3:55.33). She became the first Turkish woman ever to reach an Olympic semi-final during her participation in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. The next year, she became the first Turkish woman to reach a World Championship final. She was the best European woman athlete running 1500 m in two consecutive years 2002 and 2003.

In 2007, Ayhan was served with a lifetime competition ban due to violating anti-doping regulations.

==Athletics career==

===Early career===
Ayhan&#x27;s father is a former amateur athlete, a local cross-country runner. He was a role model and supporter for Süreyya when she started athletics in the junior high school. In 1992, she started running competitively. She graduated from the Kahramanmaraş Sütçü İmam Üniversitesi in sport and physical education.

Born in Korgun, Çankırı, she established herself as Turkey&#x27;s top 1500 m runner with a win at the 1999 national championships, setting a Turkish record. The following year she became the country&#x27;s first female semi-finalist at the Olympic Games. She reached the final of the 2001 World Championships in Athletics (another first for Turkish female athletes), became the Universiade 1500 m champion and won a silver at the 2001 Mediterranean Games.

===World-class breakthrough===
In 2002, she won Turkey&#x27;s first gold medal in a European Championships by out-sprinting World and Olympics champion Gabriela Szabo from Romania for the 1500 m title 2 seconds ahead with 3:58.79, leading from the gun to the finish. She improved further in 2003, taking two seconds off her personal best winning a silver medal in the 1500 m final of the 2003 World Championships.

==Doping ban==
Ayhan, one of Turkey&#x27;s best hopes for a gold medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics, withdrew from the games due to an injured tendon during a training in Germany.

Allegations that Ayhan may have attempted to cheat on a pre-Olympic doping test surfaced in August after testers reportedly complained of being obstructed from carrying out their work. She was cleared of doping allegations by the IAAF, but she violated rules while taking her test. IAAF ruled that Ayhan had not taken performance-enhancing drugs, but said the athlete had broken testing rules, and she was banned for two years.

She returned to competition but failed another test while she was training in the United States in November 2007, this time after her sample tested positive for the steroids stanozolol and methandienone metabolites. This second offence meant she received a lifetime ban from the sport, but she contested the ruling, taking the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The Turkish Court of Arbitration for Sport reduced her ban to four years. Ayhan took the banning to the CAS in Lausanne, however the international court reversed the decision in November 2009, upholding the lifetime ban.

==Dedications==

On May 26, 2003, The Turkish Mint issued a 925 silver commemoration coin worth of 10 US dollars in honor of her.

<doc id="1075003" wikidata="Q5025817" url="?curid=1075003" title="Camden Society">
<text>The Camden Society was a text publication society founded in London in 1838 to publish early historical and literary materials, both unpublished manuscripts and new editions of rare printed books. It was named after the 16th-century antiquary and historian William Camden. In 1897 it merged with the Royal Historical Society, which continues to publish texts in what are now known as the Camden Series.

==History==
The formation of the Camden Society in 1838 was the initiative of Thomas Wright, John Gough Nichols, and John Bruce. It was modelled on the Surtees Society (founded in 1834 to publish materials relating to the history of northern England), of which Nichols had been the first treasurer. Other founder members included Thomas Amyot, Thomas Crofton Croker, Sir Frederic Madden, John Payne Collier, and Rev. Joseph Hunter. Lord Francis Egerton served as the first President.

For an annual subscription (originally £1 per year), members received the Society&#x27;s publications, roughly two volumes per year. The original membership was 500. In 1838, 20% of members were clergymen, 9% held legal qualifications, and 36% were Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London. Membership reached a peak of 1250 in 1845, and began to decline thereafter. By the 1880s, the Camden Society was experiencing financial problems, brought about in part by a project to create a general index to its first 100 volumes. On 2 May 1897 it was amalgamated with (or effectively absorbed into) the Royal Historical Society.

The Society published some works jointly with the Early English Text Society.

==Publications==
Between 1838 and 1872 the Society published 105 volumes in its first series (now sometimes known as the Old Series); followed by a further 56 volumes in its second series (known as the New Series), which appeared between 1871 and 1896. Following the merger with the Royal Historical Society, the joint society issued another 6 volumes in the New Series, of which the last, volume 62, appeared in 1901. A fresh series was then begun, published under the Royal Historical Society imprint, but named the Camden Third Series, in which 94 volumes appeared between 1900 and 1963. A further 44 volumes were published between 1969 and 1993 in the Camden Fourth Series; and the Camden Fifth Series, which began publication in 1993, had reached volume 67 by 2024, and remains in progress. The majority of volumes have contained book-length texts (occasionally running into multiple volumes), or thematic groups of shorter texts; but they have also from time to time – both in the two original Camden Society series and in the three RHS Camden Series – been made up of two or more disparate shorter texts, under the series title &quot;Camden Miscellany&quot;. A total of 36 Miscellany volumes had appeared by 2015.

Volumes are now published for the RHS by Cambridge University Press.

<doc id="1075005" wikidata="Q663290" url="?curid=1075005" title="Exergy">
<text>Exergy, often referred to as &quot;available energy&quot; or &quot;useful work potential&quot;, is a fundamental concept in the field of thermodynamics and engineering. It plays a crucial role in understanding and quantifying the quality of energy within a system and its potential to perform useful work. Exergy analysis has widespread applications in various fields, including energy engineering, environmental science, and industrial processes.

From a scientific and engineering perspective, second-law-based exergy analysis is valuable because it provides a number of benefits over energy analysis alone. These benefits include the basis for determining energy quality (or exergy content), enhancing the understanding of fundamental physical phenomena, and improving design, performance evaluation and optimization efforts. In thermodynamics, the exergy of a system is the maximum useful work that can be produced as the system is brought into equilibrium with its environment by an ideal process. The specification of an &quot;ideal process&quot; allows the determination of &quot;maximum work&quot; production. From a conceptual perspective, exergy is the &quot;ideal&quot; potential of a system to do work or cause a change as it achieves equilibrium with its environment. Exergy is also known as &quot;availability&quot;. Exergy is non-zero when there is dis-equilibrium between the system and its environment, and exergy is zero when equilibrium is established (the state of maximum entropy for the system plus its environment).

Determining exergy was one of the original goals of thermodynamics. The term &quot;exergy&quot; was coined in 1956 by Zoran Rant (1904–1972) by using the Greek &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;from work&quot;, but the concept had been earlier developed by J. Willard Gibbs (the namesake of Gibbs free energy) in 1873.

Energy is neither created nor destroyed, but is simply converted from one form to another (see First law of thermodynamics). In contrast to energy, exergy is always destroyed when a process is non-ideal or irreversible (see Second law of thermodynamics). To illustrate, when someone states that &quot;I used a lot of energy running up that hill&quot;, the statement contradicts the first law. Although the energy is not consumed, intuitively we perceive that something is. The key point is that energy has quality or measures of usefulness, and this energy quality (or exergy content) is what is consumed or destroyed. This occurs because everything, all real processes, produce entropy and the destruction of exergy or the rate of &quot;irreversibility&quot; is proportional to this entropy production (Gouy–Stodola theorem). Where entropy production may be calculated as the net increase in entropy of the system together with its surroundings. Entropy production is due to things such as friction, heat transfer across a finite temperature difference and mixing. In distinction from &quot;exergy destruction&quot;, &quot;exergy loss&quot; is the transfer of exergy across the boundaries of a system, such as with mass or heat loss, where the exergy flow or transfer is potentially recoverable. The energy quality or exergy content of these mass and energy losses are low in many situations or applications, where exergy content is defined as the ratio of exergy to energy on a percentage basis. For example, while the exergy content of electrical work produced by a thermal power plant is 100%, the exergy content of low-grade heat rejected by the power plant, at say, 41 degrees Celsius, relative to an environment temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, is only 5%.

==Definitions==

Exergy is a combination property of a system and its environment because it depends on the state of both and is a consequence of dis-equilibrium between them. Exergy is neither a thermodynamic property of matter nor a thermodynamic potential of a system. Exergy and energy always have the same units, and the joule (symbol: J) is the unit of energy in the International System of Units (SI). The internal energy of a system is always measured from a fixed reference state and is therefore always a state function. Some authors define the exergy of the system to be changed when the environment changes, in which case it is not a state function. Other writers prefer a slightly alternate definition of the available energy or exergy of a system where the environment is firmly defined, as an unchangeable absolute reference state, and in this alternate definition, exergy becomes a property of the state of the system alone.

However, from a theoretical point of view, exergy may be defined without reference to any environment. If the intensive properties of different finitely extended elements of a system differ, there is always the possibility to extract mechanical work from the system. Yet, with such an approach one has to abandon the requirement that the environment is large enough relative to the &quot;system&quot; such that its intensive properties, such as temperature, are unchanged due to its interaction with the system. So that exergy is defined in an absolute sense, it will be assumed in this article that, unless otherwise stated, that the environment&#x27;s intensive properties are unchanged by its interaction with the system.

For a heat engine, the exergy can be simply defined in an absolute sense, as the energy input times the Carnot efficiency, assuming the low-temperature heat reservoir is at the temperature of the environment. Since many systems can be modeled as a heat engine, this definition can be useful for many applications.

===Terminology===
The term exergy is also used, by analogy with its physical definition, in information theory related to reversible computing. Exergy is also synonymous with &quot;available energy&quot;, &quot;exergic energy&quot;, &quot;essergy&quot; (considered archaic), &quot;utilizable energy&quot;, &quot;available useful work&quot;, &quot;maximum (or minimum) work&quot;, &quot;maximum (or minimum) work content&quot;, &quot;reversible work&quot;, &quot;ideal work&quot;, &quot;availability&quot; or &quot;available work&quot;.

===Implications===
The exergy destruction of a cycle is the sum of the exergy destruction of the processes that compose that cycle. The exergy destruction of a cycle can also be determined without tracing the individual processes by considering the entire cycle as a single process and using one of the exergy destruction equations.

===Examples===
For two thermal reservoirs at temperatures &quot;T&quot;H and &quot;T&quot;C &lt; TH, as considered by Carnot, the exergy is the work &quot;W&quot; that can be done by a reversible engine. Specifically, with &quot;Q&quot;H the heat provided by the hot reservoir, Carnot&#x27;s analysis gives &quot;W&quot;/&quot;Q&quot;H = (&quot;T&quot;H − &quot;T&quot;C)/&quot;T&quot;H. Although, exergy or maximum work is determined by conceptually utilizing an ideal process, it is the property of a system in a given environment. Exergy analysis is not merely for reversible cycles, but for all cycles (including non-cyclic or non-ideal), and indeed for all thermodynamic processes.

As an example, consider the non-cyclic process of expansion of an ideal gas. For free expansion in an isolated system, the energy and temperature do not change, so by energy conservation no work is done. On the other hand, for expansion done against a moveable wall that always matched the (varying) pressure of the expanding gas (so the wall develops negligible kinetic energy), with no heat transfer (adiabatic wall), the maximum work would be done. This corresponds to the exergy. Thus, in terms of exergy, Carnot considered the exergy for a cyclic process with two thermal reservoirs (fixed temperatures). Just as the work done depends on the process, so the exergy depends on the process, reducing to Carnot&#x27;s result for Carnot&#x27;s case.

W. Thomson (from 1892, Lord Kelvin), as early as 1849 was exercised by what he called “lost energy”, which appears to be the same as “destroyed energy” and what has been called “anergy”. In 1874 he wrote that “lost energy” is the same as the energy dissipated by, e.g., friction, electrical conduction (electric field-driven charge diffusion), heat conduction (temperature-driven thermal diffusion), viscous processes (transverse momentum diffusion) and particle diffusion (ink in water). On the other hand, Kelvin did not indicate how to compute the “lost energy”. This awaited the 1931 and 1932 works of Onsager on irreversible processes.

==Mathematical description==

===An application of the second law of thermodynamics===
Exergy uses system boundaries in a way that is unfamiliar to many. We imagine the presence of a Carnot engine between the system and its reference environment even though this engine does not exist in the real world. Its only purpose is to measure the results of a &quot;what-if&quot; scenario to represent the most efficient work interaction possible between the system and its surroundings.

If a real-world reference environment is chosen that behaves like an unlimited reservoir that remains unaltered by the system, then Carnot&#x27;s speculation about the consequences of a system heading towards equilibrium with time is addressed by two equivalent mathematical statements. Let &quot;B&quot;, the exergy or available work, decrease with time, and &quot;S&quot;total, the entropy of the system and its reference environment enclosed together in a larger isolated system, increase with time:

{\mathrm{d}t} \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;|}}

For macroscopic systems (above the thermodynamic limit), these statements are both expressions of the second law of thermodynamics if the following expression is used for exergy:
where the extensive quantities for the system are: &quot;U&quot; = Internal energy, &quot;V&quot; = Volume, and &quot;N&quot;i = Moles of component &quot;i&quot;. The intensive quantities for the surroundings are: &quot;P&quot;R = Pressure, &quot;T&quot;R = temperature, &quot;μ&quot;i, R
 = Chemical potential of component &quot;i&quot;. Indeed the total entropy of the universe reads:
 = -B/T_R = S - U/T_R - P_R V /T_R + \sum_i \mu_{i,R} N_i /T_R &lt;/math&gt;|}}
the second term formula_1 being the entropy of the surroundings to within a constant. 

Individual terms also often have names attached to them: formula_2 is called &quot;available PV work&quot;, formula_3 is called &quot;entropic loss&quot; or &quot;heat loss&quot; and the final term is called &quot;available chemical energy.&quot;

Other thermodynamic potentials may be used to replace internal energy so long as proper care is taken in recognizing which natural variables correspond to which potential. For the recommended nomenclature of these potentials, see (Alberty, 2001). Equation () is useful for processes where system volume, entropy, and the number of moles of various components change because internal energy is also a function of these variables and no others.

An alternative definition of internal energy does not separate available chemical potential from &quot;U&quot;. This expression is useful (when substituted into equation ()) for processes where system volume and entropy change, but no chemical reaction occurs:

In this case, a given set of chemicals at a given entropy and volume will have a single numerical value for this thermodynamic potential. A multi-state system may complicate or simplify the problem because the Gibbs phase rule predicts that intensive quantities will no longer be completely independent from each other.

===A historical and cultural tangent===
In 1848, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, asked (and immediately answered) the question

:Is there any principle on which an absolute thermometric scale can be founded? It appears to me that Carnot&#x27;s theory of the motive power of heat enables us to give an affirmative answer.

With the benefit of the hindsight contained in equation (), we are able to understand the historical impact of Kelvin&#x27;s idea on physics. Kelvin suggested that the best temperature scale would describe a constant ability for a unit of temperature in the surroundings to alter the available work from Carnot&#x27;s engine. From equation ():

Rudolf Clausius recognized the presence of a proportionality constant in Kelvin&#x27;s analysis and gave it the name entropy in 1865 from the Greek for &quot;transformation&quot; because it quantifies the amount of energy lost during the conversion from heat to work. The available work from a Carnot engine is at its maximum when the surroundings are at a temperature of absolute zero.

Physicists then, as now, often look at a property with the word &quot;available&quot; or &quot;utilizable&quot; in its name with a certain unease. The idea of what is available raises the question of &quot;available to what?&quot; and raises a concern about whether such a property is anthropocentric. Laws derived using such a property may not describe the universe but instead, describe what people wish to see.

The field of statistical mechanics (beginning with the work of Ludwig Boltzmann in developing the Boltzmann equation) relieved many physicists of this concern. From this discipline, we now know that macroscopic properties may all be determined from properties on a microscopic scale where entropy is more &quot;real&quot; than temperature itself (&quot;see Thermodynamic temperature&quot;). Microscopic kinetic fluctuations among particles cause entropic loss, and this energy is unavailable for work because these fluctuations occur randomly in all directions. The anthropocentric act is taken, in the eyes of some physicists and engineers today, when someone draws a hypothetical boundary, in fact, he says: &quot;This is my system. What occurs beyond it is surroundings.&quot; In this context, exergy is sometimes described as an anthropocentric property, both by some who use it and by some who don&#x27;t. However, exergy is based on the dis-equilibrium between a system and its environment, so its very real and necessary to define the system distinctly from its environment. It can be agreed that entropy is generally viewed as a more fundamental property of matter than exergy.

===A potential for every thermodynamic situation===

In addition to formula_4 and the other thermodynamic potentials are frequently used to determine exergy. For a given set of chemicals at a given entropy and pressure, enthalpy &quot;H&quot; is used in the expression:

For a given set of chemicals at a given temperature and volume, Helmholtz free energy &quot;A&quot; is used in the expression:

For a given set of chemicals at a given temperature and pressure, Gibbs free energy &quot;G&quot; is used in the expression:

where formula_5 is evaluated at the isothermal system temperature (formula_6), and formula_7 is defined with respect to the isothermal temperature of the system&#x27;s environment (formula_8). The exergy formula_7 is the energy formula_10 reduced by the product of the entropy times the environment temperature formula_8, which is the slope or partial derivative of the internal energy with respect to entropy in the environment. That is, higher entropy reduces the exergy or free energy available relative to the energy level formula_10.

Work can be produced from this energy, such as in an isothermal process, but any entropy generation during the process will cause the destruction of exergy (irreversibility) and the reduction of these thermodynamic potentials. Further, exergy losses can occur if mass and energy is transferred out of the system at non-ambient or elevated temperature, pressure or chemical potential. Exergy losses are potentially recoverable though because the exergy has not been destroyed, such as what occurs in waste heat recovery systems (although the energy quality or exergy content is typically low). As a special case, an isothermal process operating at ambient temperature will have no thermally related exergy losses.

=== Exergy Analysis involving Radiative Heat Transfer ===

All matter emits radiation continuously as a result of its non-zero (absolute) temperature. This emitted energy flow is proportional to the material’s temperature raised to the fourth power. As a result, any radiation conversion device that seeks to absorb and convert radiation (while reflecting a fraction of the incoming source radiation) inherently emits its own radiation. Also, given that reflected and emitted radiation can occupy the same direction or solid angle, the entropy flows, and as a result, the exergy flows, are generally not independent. The entropy and exergy balance equations for a control volume (CV), re-stated to correctly apply to situations involving radiative transfer, are expressed as,

formula_13
where formula_14 or denotes entropy production within the control volume, and,

formula_15

This rate equation for the exergy within an open system X () takes into account the exergy transfer rates across the system boundary by heat transfer ( for conduction &amp; convection, and by radiative fluxes), by mechanical or electrical work transfer (), and by mass transfer (), as well as taking into account the exergy destruction () that occurs within the system due to irreversibility’s or non-ideal processes. Note that chemical exergy, kinetic energy, and gravitational potential energy have been excluded for simplicity.

The exergy irradiance or flux M, and the exergy radiance N (where M = πN for isotropic radiation), depend on the spectral and directional distribution of the radiation (for example, see the next section on ‘Exergy Flux of Radiation with an Arbitrary Spectrum’). Sunlight can be crudely approximated as blackbody, or more accurately, as graybody radiation. Noting that, although a graybody spectrum looks similar to a blackbody spectrum, the entropy and exergy are very different.
Petela determined that the exergy of isotropic blackbody radiation was given by the expression,

formula_16

where the exergy within the enclosed system is X (), c is the speed of light, V is the volume occupied by the enclosed radiation system or void, T is the material emission temperature, To is the environmental temperature, and x is the dimensionless temperature ratio To/T.

However, for decades this result was contested in terms of its relevance to the conversion of radiation fluxes, and in particular, solar radiation. For example, Bejan stated that “Petela’s efficiency is no more than a convenient, albeit artificial way, of non-dimensionalizing the calculated work output” and that Petela’s efficiency “is not a ‘conversion efficiency.’ ” However, it has been shown that Petela’s result represents the exergy of blackbody radiation. This was done by resolving a number of issues, including that of inherent irreversibility, defining the environment in terms of radiation, the effect of inherent emission by the conversion device and the effect of concentrating source radiation.

==== Exergy Flux of Radiation with an Arbitrary Spectrum (including Sunlight) ====
In general, terrestrial solar radiation has an arbitrary non-blackbody spectrum. Ground level spectrums can vary greatly due to reflection, scattering and absorption in the atmosphere. While the emission spectrums of thermal radiation in engineering systems can vary widely as well.

In determining the exergy of radiation with an arbitrary spectrum, it must be considered whether reversible or ideal conversion (zero entropy production) is possible. It has been shown that reversible conversion of blackbody radiation fluxes across an infinitesimal temperature difference is theoretically possible ]. However, this reversible conversion can only be theoretically achieved because equilibrium can exist between blackbody radiation and matter. However, non-blackbody radiation cannot even exist in equilibrium with itself, nor with its own emitting material.

Unlike blackbody radiation, non-blackbody radiation cannot exist in equilibrium with matter, so it appears likely that the interaction of non-blackbody radiation with matter is always an inherently irreversible process. For example, an enclosed non-blackbody radiation system (such as a void inside a solid mass) is unstable and will spontaneously equilibriate to blackbody radiation unless the enclosure is perfectly reflecting (i.e., unless there is no thermal interaction of the radiation with its enclosure – which is not possible in actual, or real, non-ideal systems). Consequently, a cavity initially devoid of thermal radiation inside a non-blackbody material will spontaneously and rapidly (due to the high velocity of the radiation), through a series of absorption and emission interactions, become filled with blackbody radiation rather than non-blackbody radiation.

The approaches by Petela and Karlsson both assume that reversible conversion of non-blackbody radiation is theoretically possible, that is, without addressing or considering the issue. Exergy is not a property of the system alone, it’s a property of both the system and its environment. Thus, it is of key importance non-blackbody radiation cannot exist in equilibrium with matter, indicating that the interaction of non-blackbody radiation with matter is an inherently irreversible process.

The flux (irradiance) of radiation with an arbitrary spectrum, based on the inherent irreversibility of non-blackbody radiation conversion, is given by the expression,

formula_17

The exergy flux formula_18 is expressed as a function of only the energy flux or irradiance formula_10 and the environment temperature formula_20. For graybody radiation, the exergy flux is given by the expression,

formula_21

As one would expect, the exergy flux of non-blackbody radiation reduces to the result for blackbody radiation when emissivity is equal to one.

Note that the exergy flux of graybody radiation can be a small fraction of the energy flux. For example, the ratio of exergy flux to energy flux formula_22 for graybody radiation with emissivity formula_23 is equal to 40.0%, for formula_24 and formula_25. That is, a maximum of only 40% of the graybody energy flux can be converted to work in this case (already only 50% of that of the blackbody energy flux with the same emission temperature). Graybody radiation has a spectrum that looks similar to the blackbody spectrum, but the entropy and exergy flux cannot be accurately approximated as that of blackbody radiation with the same emission temperature. However, it can be reasonably approximated by the entropy flux of blackbody radiation with the same energy flux (lower emission temperature).

Blackbody radiation has the highest entropy-to-energy ratio of all radiation with the same energy flux, but the lowest entropy-to-energy ratio, and the highest exergy content, of all radiation with the same emission temperature. For example, the exergy content of graybody radiation is lower than that of blackbody radiation with the same emission temperature and decreases as emissivity decreases. For the example above with formula_26 the exergy flux of the blackbody radiation source flux is 52.5% of the energy flux compared to 40.0% for graybody radiation with formula_23, or compared to 15.5% for graybody radiation with formula_28.

==== The Exergy Flux of Sunlight ====
In addition to the production of power directly from sunlight, solar radiation provides most of the exergy for processes on Earth, including processes that sustain living systems directly, as well as all fuels and energy sources that are used for transportation and electric power production (directly or indirectly). This is primarily with the exception of nuclear fission power plants and geothermal energy (due to natural fission decay). Solar energy is, for the most part, thermal radiation from the Sun with an emission temperature near 5762 Kelvin, but it also includes small amounts of higher energy radiation from the fusion reaction or higher thermal emission temperatures within the Sun. The source of most energy on Earth is nuclear in origin.

The figure below depicts typical solar radiation spectrums under clear sky conditions for AM0 (extraterrestrial solar radiation), AM1 (terrestrial solar radiation with solar zenith angle of 0 degrees) and AM4 (terrestrial solar radiation with solar zenith angle of 75.5 degrees). The solar spectrum at sea level (terrestrial solar spectrum) depends on a number of factors including the position of the Sun in the sky, atmospheric turbidity, the level of local atmospheric pollution, and the amount and type of cloud cover. These spectrums are for relatively clear air (α = 1.3, β = 0.04) assuming a U.S. standard atmosphere with 20 mm of precipitable water vapor and 3.4 mm of ozone. The Figure shows the spectral energy irradiance (W/m2μm) which does not provide information regarding the directional distribution of the solar radiation. The exergy content of the solar radiation, assuming that it is subtended by the solid angle of the ball of the Sun (no circumsolar), is 93.1%, 92.3% and 90.8%, respectively, for the AM0, AM1 and the AM4 spectrums.

The exergy content of terrestrial solar radiation is also reduced because of the diffuse component caused by the complex interaction of solar radiation, originally in a very small solid angle beam, with material in the Earth’s atmosphere. The characteristics and magnitude of diffuse terrestrial solar radiation depends on a number of factors, as mentioned, including the position of the Sun in the sky, atmospheric turbidity, the level of local atmospheric pollution, and the amount and type of cloud cover. Solar radiation under clear sky conditions exhibits a maximum intensity towards the Sun (circumsolar radiation) but also exhibits an increase in intensity towards the horizon (horizon brightening). In contrast for opaque overcast skies the solar radiation can be completely diffuse with a maximum intensity in the direction of the zenith and monotonically decreasing towards the horizon. The magnitude of the diffuse component generally varies with frequency, being highest in the ultraviolet region.

The dependence of the exergy content on directional distribution can be illustrated by considering, for example, the AM1 and AM4 terrestrial spectrums depicted in the figure, with the following simplified cases of directional distribution:

• For AM1: 80% of the solar radiation is contained in the solid angle subtended by the Sun, 10% is contained and isotropic in a solid angle 0.008 sr (this field of view includes circumsolar radiation), while the remaining 10% of the solar radiation is diffuse and isotropic in the solid angle 2π sr.

• For AM4: 65% of the solar radiation is contained in the solid angle subtended by the Sun, 20% of the solar radiation is contained and isotropic in a solid angle 0.008 sr, while the remaining 15% of the solar radiation is diffuse and isotropic in the solid angle 2π sr. Note that when the Sun is low in the sky the diffuse component can be the dominant part of the incident solar radiation.

For these cases of directional distribution, the exergy content of the terrestrial solar radiation for the AM1 and AM4 spectrum depicted are 80.8% and 74.0%, respectively. From these sample calculations it is evideνnt that the exergy content of terrestrial solar radiation is strongly dependent on the directional distribution of the radiation. This result is interesting because one might expect that the performance of a conversion device would depend on the incoming rate of photons and their spectral distribution but not on the directional distribution of the incoming photons. However, for a given incoming flux of photons with a certain spectral distribution, the entropy (level of disorder) is higher the more diffuse the directional distribution. From the second law of thermodynamics, the incoming entropy of the solar radiation cannot be destroyed and consequently reduces the maximum work output that can be obtained by a conversion device.

===Chemical exergy===
Similar to thermomechanical exergy, chemical exergy depends on the temperature and pressure of a system as well as on the composition. The key difference in evaluating chemical exergy versus thermomechanical exergy is that thermomechanical exergy does not take into account the difference in a system and the environment&#x27;s chemical composition. If the temperature, pressure or composition of a system differs from the environment&#x27;s state, then the overall system will have exergy.

The definition of chemical exergy resembles the standard definition of thermomechanical exergy, but with a few differences. Chemical exergy is defined as the maximum work that can be obtained when the considered system is brought into reaction with reference substances present in the environment. Defining the exergy reference environment is one of the most vital parts of analyzing chemical exergy. In general, the environment is defined as the composition of air at 25 °C and 1 atm of pressure. At these properties air consists of N2=75.67%, O2=20.35%, H2O(g)=3.12%, CO2=0.03% and other gases=0.83%. These molar fractions will become of use when applying Equation 8 below.

CaHbOc is the substance that is entering a system that one wants to find the maximum theoretical work of. By using the following equations, one can calculate the chemical exergy of the substance in a given system. Below, Equation 9 uses the Gibbs function of the applicable element or compound to calculate the chemical exergy. Equation 10 is similar but uses standard molar chemical exergy, which scientists have determined based on several criteria, including the ambient temperature and pressure that a system is being analyzed and the concentration of the most common components. These values can be found in thermodynamic books or in online tables.

====Important equations====
+\left( a+\frac{b}{4}-\frac{c}{2}
\right)\bar{g}_{\mathrm{O_{2}}}-a\bar{g}_{\mathrm{CO_{2}}}-\, \frac{b}{2}\bar{g}_{\mathrm{H_{2}O}(g)}

y_{\mathrm{CO_{2}}}^{e} \right)^{a}\left( y_{\mathrm{H_{2}O}}^{e} \right)^{\frac{b}{2}}}
\right] &lt;/math&gt;|}}
where:
*formula_29 is the Gibbs function of the specific substance in the system at formula_30. (formula_31 refers to the substance that is entering the system)

*formula_32 is the Universal gas constant (8.314462 J/mol•K)
*formula_33 is the temperature that the system is being evaluated at in absolute temperature
*formula_34 is the molar fraction of the given substance in the environment, i.e. air

+\left( a+\frac{b}{4} - \frac{c}{2} \right) \bar{g}_{\mathrm{O_2}}-a\bar{g}_{\mathrm{CO_2}}-\, \frac{b}{2} \bar{g}_{\mathrm{H_2 O}(g)}
\right]\, \left( T_{0,}p_{0} \right)+a\bar{e}_{\mathrm{CO_2}}^{ch}+\, \left(
\frac{b}{2} \right)\bar{e}_{\mathrm{H_{2}O}(l)}^{ch}-\, \left( a+\, \frac{b}{4}
\right)\bar{e}_{\mathrm{O_{2}}}^{ch} &lt;/math&gt;|}}
where formula_35 is the standard molar chemical exergy taken from a table for the specific conditions that the system is being evaluated.

Equation 10 is more commonly used due to the simplicity of only having to look up the standard chemical exergy for given substances. Using a standard table works well for most cases, even if the environmental conditions vary slightly, the difference is most likely negligible.

====Total exergy====
After finding the chemical exergy in a given system, one can find the total exergy by adding it to the thermomechanical exergy. Depending on the situation, the amount of chemical exergy added can be very small. If the system being evaluated involves combustion, the amount of chemical exergy is very large and necessary to find the total exergy of the system.

===Irreversibility===
Irreversibility accounts for the amount of exergy destroyed in a closed system, or in other words, the wasted work potential. This is also called dissipated energy. For highly efficient systems, the value of , is low, and vice versa. The equation to calculate the irreversibility of a closed system, as it relates to the exergy of that system, is as follows:

where formula_36, also denoted by , is the entropy generated by processes within the system. If formula_37 then there are irreversibilities present in the system. If formula_38 then there are no irreversibilities present in the system. The value of , the irreversibility, can not be negative, as this implies entropy destruction, a direct violation of the second law of thermodynamics.

Exergy analysis also relates the actual work of a work producing device to the maximal work, that could be obtained in the reversible or ideal process:

That is, the irreversibility is the ideal maximum work output minus the actual work production. Whereas, for a work consuming device such as refrigeration or heat pump, irreversibility is the actual work input minus the ideal minimum work input.

The first term at the right part is related to the difference in exergy at inlet and outlet of the system:

where is also denoted by .

For an isolated system there are no heat or work interactions or transfers of exergy between the system and its surroundings. The exergy of an isolated system can therefore only decrease, by a magnitude equal to the irreversibility of that system or process,

==Applications==
Applying equation () to a subsystem yields:

This expression applies equally well for theoretical ideals in a wide variety of applications: electrolysis (decrease in &quot;G&quot;), galvanic cells and fuel cells (increase in &quot;G&quot;), explosives (increase in &quot;A&quot;), heating and refrigeration (exchange of &quot;H&quot;), motors (decrease in &quot;U&quot;) and generators (increase in &quot;U&quot;).

Utilization of the exergy concept often requires careful consideration of the choice of reference environment because, as Carnot knew, unlimited reservoirs do not exist in the real world. A system may be maintained at a constant temperature to simulate an unlimited reservoir in the lab or in a factory, but those systems cannot then be isolated from a larger surrounding environment. However, with a proper choice of system boundaries, a reasonable constant reservoir can be imagined. A process sometimes must be compared to &quot;the most realistic impossibility,&quot; and this invariably involves a certain amount of guesswork.

===Engineering applications===

One goal of energy and exergy methods in engineering is to compute what comes into and out of several possible designs before a design is built. Energy input and output will always balance according to the First Law of Thermodynamics or the energy conservation principle. Exergy output will not equal the exergy input for real processes since a part of the exergy input is always destroyed according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics for real processes. After the input and output are calculated, an engineer will often want to select the most efficient process. An energy efficiency or &quot;first law efficiency&quot; will determine the most efficient process based on wasting as little energy as possible relative to energy inputs. An exergy efficiency or &quot;second-law efficiency&quot; will determine the most efficient process based on wasting &quot;and destroying&quot; as little available work as possible from a given input of available work, per unit of whatever the desired output is.

Exergy has been applied in a number of design applications in order to optimize systems or identify components or subsystems with the greatest potential for improvement. For instance, an exergy analysis of environmental control systems on the international space station revealed the oxygen generation assembly as the subsystem which destroyed the most exergy.

Exergy is particularly useful for broad engineering analyses with many systems of varied nature, since it can account for mechanical, electrical, nuclear, chemical, or thermal systems. For this reason, Exergy analysis has also been used to optimize the performance of rocket vehicles. Exergy analysis affords additional insight, relative to energy analysis alone, because it incorporates the second law, and considers both the system and its relationship with its environment. For example, exergy analysis has been used to compare possible power generation and storage systems on the moon, since exergy analysis is conducted in reference to the unique environmental operating conditions of a specific application, such as on the surface of the moon.

Application of exergy to unit operations in chemical plants was partially responsible for the huge growth of the chemical industry during the 20th century.

As a simple example of exergy, air at atmospheric conditions of temperature, pressure, &quot;and composition&quot; contains energy but no exergy when it is chosen as the thermodynamic reference state known as ambient. Individual processes on Earth such as combustion in a power plant often eventually result in products that are incorporated into the atmosphere, so defining this reference state for exergy is useful even though the atmosphere itself is not at equilibrium and is full of long and short term variations.

If standard ambient conditions are used for calculations during chemical plant operation when the actual weather is very cold or hot, then certain parts of a chemical plant might seem to have an exergy efficiency of greater than 100%. Without taking into account the non-standard atmospheric temperature variation, these calculations can give an impression of being a perpetual motion machine. Using actual conditions will give actual values, but standard ambient conditions are useful for initial design calculations.

===Applications in natural resource utilization===
In recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside of physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology, ecological economics, systems ecology, and energetics. Defining where one field ends and the next begins is a matter of semantics, but applications of exergy can be placed into rigid categories.
After the milestone work of Jan Szargut who emphasized the relation between exergy and availability,
it is necessary to remember &quot;Exergy Ecology and Democracy&quot;.
by Goran Wall, a short essay, which evidences the strict relation that relates exergy disruption with environmental and social disruption.
From this activity it has derived a fundamental research activity in ecological economics and environmental accounting perform exergy-cost analyses in order to evaluate the impact of human activity on the current and future natural environment. As with ambient air, this often requires the unrealistic substitution of properties from a natural environment in place of the reference state environment of Carnot. For example, ecologists and others have developed reference conditions for the ocean and for the Earth&#x27;s crust. Exergy values for human activity using this information can be useful for comparing policy alternatives based on the efficiency of utilizing natural resources to perform work. Typical questions that may be answered are:

:Does the human production of one unit of an economic good by method &quot;A&quot; utilize more of a resource&#x27;s exergy than by method &quot;B&quot;?

:Does the human production of economic good &quot;A&quot; utilize more of a resource&#x27;s exergy than the production of good &quot;B&quot;?

:Does the human production of economic good &quot;A&quot; utilize a resource&#x27;s exergy more efficiently than the production of good &quot;B&quot;?

There has been some progress in standardizing and applying these methods.

Measuring exergy requires the evaluation of a system&#x27;s reference state environment. With respect to the applications of exergy on natural resource utilization, the process of quantifying a system requires the assignment of value (both utilized and potential) to resources that are not always easily dissected into typical cost-benefit terms. However, to fully realize the potential of a system to do work, it is becoming increasingly imperative to understand exergetic potential of natural resources, and how human interference alters this potential.

Referencing the inherent qualities of a system in place of a reference state environment is the most direct way that ecologists determine the exergy of a natural resource. Specifically, it is easiest to examine the thermodynamic properties of a system, and the reference substances that are acceptable within the reference environment. This determination allows for the assumption of qualities in a natural state: deviation from these levels may indicate a change in the environment caused by outside sources. There are three kinds of reference substances that are acceptable, due to their proliferation on the planet: gases within the atmosphere, solids within the Earth&#x27;s crust, and molecules or ions in seawater. By understanding these basic models, it&#x27;s possible to determine the exergy of multiple earth systems interacting, like the effects of solar radiation on plant life. These basic categories are utilized as the main components of a reference environment when examining how exergy can be defined through natural resources.

Other qualities within a reference state environment include temperature, pressure, and any number of combinations of substances within a defined area. Again, the exergy of a system is determined by the potential of that system to do work, so it is necessary to determine the baseline qualities of a system before it is possible to understand the potential of that system. The thermodynamic value of a resource can be found by multiplying the exergy of the resource by the cost of obtaining the resource and processing it.

Today, it is becoming increasingly popular to analyze the environmental impacts of natural resource utilization, especially for energy usage. To understand the ramifications of these practices, exergy is utilized as a tool for determining the impact potential of emissions, fuels, and other sources of energy. Combustion of fossil fuels, for example, is examined with respect to assessing the environmental impacts of burning coal, oil, and natural gas. The current methods for analyzing the emissions from these three products can be compared to the process of determining the exergy of the systems affected; specifically, it is useful to examine these with regard to the reference state environment of gases within the atmosphere. In this way, it is easier to determine how human action is affecting the natural environment.

===Applications in sustainability===

In systems ecology, researchers sometimes consider the exergy of the current formation of natural resources from a small number of exergy inputs (usually solar radiation, tidal forces, and geothermal heat). This application not only requires assumptions about reference states, but it also requires assumptions about the real environments of the past that might have been close to those reference states. Can we decide which is the most &quot;realistic impossibility&quot; over such a long period of time when we are only speculating about the reality?

For instance, comparing oil exergy to coal exergy using a common reference state would require geothermal exergy inputs to describe the transition from biological material to fossil fuels during millions of years in the Earth&#x27;s crust, and solar radiation exergy inputs to describe the material&#x27;s history before then when it was part of the biosphere. This would need to be carried out mathematically backwards through time, to a presumed era when the oil and coal could be assumed to be receiving the same exergy inputs from these sources. A speculation about a past environment is different from assigning a reference state with respect to known environments today. Reasonable guesses about real ancient environments may be made, but they are untestable guesses, and so some regard this application as pseudoscience or pseudo-engineering.

The field describes this accumulated exergy in a natural resource over time as embodied energy with units of the &quot;embodied joule&quot; or &quot;emjoule&quot;.

The important application of this research is to address sustainability issues in a quantitative fashion through a sustainability measurement:

:Does the human production of an economic good deplete the exergy of Earth&#x27;s natural resources more quickly than those resources are able to receive exergy?

:If so, how does this compare to the depletion caused by producing the same good (or a different one) using a different set of natural resources?

===Exergy and environmental policy===
Today environmental policies does not consider exergy as an instrument for a more equitable and effective environmental policy. Recently, exergy analysis allowed to obtain an important fault in today governmental GHGs emission balances, which often do not consider international transport related emissions, therefore the impacts of import/export are not accounted,

Therefore, some preliminary cases of the impacts of import export transportation and of technology had provided evidencing the opportunity of introducing an effective exergy based taxation which can reduce the fiscal impact on citizens.
In addition Exergy can be a precious instrument for an effective estimation of the path toward UN sustainable development goals (SDG).

===Assigning one thermodynamically obtained value to an economic good===

A technique proposed by systems ecologists is to consolidate the three exergy inputs described in the last section into the single exergy input of solar radiation, and to express the total input of exergy into an economic good as a &quot;solar embodied joule&quot; or &quot;sej&quot;. (&quot;See Emergy&quot;) Exergy inputs from solar, tidal, and geothermal forces all at one time had their origins at the beginning of the solar system under conditions which could be chosen as an initial reference state, and other speculative reference states could in theory be traced back to that time. With this tool we would be able to answer:

:What fraction of the total human depletion of the Earth&#x27;s exergy is caused by the production of a particular economic good?

:What fraction of the total human and non-human depletion of the Earth&#x27;s exergy is caused by the production of a particular economic good?

No additional thermodynamic laws are required for this idea, and the principles of energetics may confuse many issues for those outside the field. The combination of untestable hypotheses, unfamiliar jargon that contradicts accepted jargon, intense advocacy among its supporters, and some degree of isolation from other disciplines have contributed to this protoscience being regarded by many as a pseudoscience. However, its basic tenets are only a further utilization of the exergy concept.

===Implications in the development of complex physical systems===

A common hypothesis in systems ecology is that the design engineer&#x27;s observation that a greater capital investment is needed to create a process with increased exergy efficiency is actually the economic result of a fundamental law of nature. By this view, exergy is the analogue of economic currency in the natural world. The analogy to capital investment is the accumulation of exergy into a system over long periods of time resulting in embodied energy. The analogy of capital investment resulting in a factory with high exergy efficiency is an increase in natural organizational structures with high exergy efficiency. (&quot;See Maximum power&quot;). Researchers in these fields describe biological evolution in terms of increases in organism complexity due to the requirement for increased exergy efficiency because of competition for limited sources of exergy.

Some biologists have a similar hypothesis. A biological system (or a chemical plant) with a number of intermediate compartments and intermediate reactions is more efficient because the process is divided up into many small substeps, and this is closer to the reversible ideal of an infinite number of infinitesimal substeps. Of course, an excessively large number of intermediate compartments comes at a capital cost that may be too high.

Testing this idea in living organisms or ecosystems is impossible for all practical purposes because of the large time scales and small exergy inputs involved for changes to take place. However, if this idea is correct, it would not be a new fundamental law of nature. It would simply be living systems and ecosystems maximizing their exergy efficiency by utilizing laws of thermodynamics developed in the 19th century.

===Philosophical and cosmological implications===

Some proponents of utilizing exergy concepts describe them as a biocentric or ecocentric alternative for terms like quality and value. The &quot;deep ecology&quot; movement views economic usage of these terms as an anthropocentric philosophy which should be discarded. A possible universal thermodynamic concept of value or utility appeals to those with an interest in monism.

For some, the result of this line of thinking about tracking exergy into the deep past is a restatement of the cosmological argument that the universe was once at equilibrium and an input of exergy from some First Cause created a universe full of available work. Current science is unable to describe the first 10−43 seconds of the universe (&quot;See Timeline of the Big Bang&quot;). An external reference state is not able to be defined for such an event, and (regardless of its merits), such an argument may be better expressed in terms of entropy.

==Quality of energy types==
The ratio of exergy to energy in a substance can be considered a measure of energy quality. Forms of energy such as macroscopic kinetic energy, electrical energy, and chemical Gibbs free energy are 100% recoverable as work, and therefore have exergy equal to their energy. However, forms of energy such as radiation and thermal energy can not be converted completely to work, and have exergy content less than their energy content. The exact proportion of exergy in a substance depends on the amount of entropy relative to the surrounding environment as determined by the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

Exergy is useful when measuring the efficiency of an energy conversion process. The exergetic, or 2nd Law, efficiency is a ratio of the exergy output divided by the exergy input. This formulation takes into account the quality of the energy, often offering a more accurate and useful analysis than efficiency estimates only using the First Law of Thermodynamics.

Work can be extracted also from bodies colder than the surroundings. When the flow of energy is coming into the body, work is performed by this energy obtained from the large reservoir, the surrounding. A quantitative treatment of the notion of energy quality rests on the definition of energy. According to the standard definition, Energy is a measure of the ability to do work. Work can involve the movement of a mass by a force that results from a transformation of energy. If there is an energy transformation, the second principle of energy flow transformations says that this process must involve the dissipation of some energy as heat. Measuring the amount of heat released is one way of quantifying the energy, or ability to do work and apply a force over a distance.

===Exergy of heat available at a temperature===

Maximal possible conversion of heat to work, or exergy content of heat, depends on the temperature at which heat is available and the temperature level at which the reject heat can be disposed, that is the temperature of the surrounding. The upper limit for conversion is known as Carnot efficiency and was discovered by Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot in 1824. See also Carnot heat engine.

Carnot efficiency is

where &quot;T&quot;&quot;H&quot; is the higher temperature and &quot;T&quot;&quot;C&quot; is the lower temperature, both as absolute temperature. From Equation 15 it is clear that in order to maximize efficiency one should maximize &quot;T&quot;&quot;H&quot; and minimize &quot;T&quot;&quot;C&quot;.

Exergy exchanged is then:

where &quot;T&quot;&quot;source&quot; is the temperature of the heat source, and &quot;T&quot;&quot;o&quot; is the temperature of the surrounding.
=== Connection with economic value ===

Exergy in a sense can be understood as a measure of the value of energy. Since high-exergy energy carriers can be used for more versatile purposes, due to their ability to do more work, they can be postulated to hold more economic value. This can be seen in the prices of energy carriers, i.e. high-exergy energy carriers such as electricity tend to be more valuable than low-exergy ones such as various fuels or heat. This has led to the substitution of more valuable high-exergy energy carriers with low-exergy energy carriers, when possible. An example is heating systems, where higher investment to heating systems allows using low-exergy energy sources. Thus high-exergy content is being substituted with capital investments.

=== Exergy based Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) ===
Exergy of a system is the maximum useful work possible during a process that brings the system into equilibrium with a heat reservoir. Wall clearly states the relation between exergy analysis and resource accounting. This intuition confirmed by Dewulf Sciubba lead to exergo-economic accounting and to methods specifically dedicated to LCA such as exergetic material input per unit of service (EMIPS). The
concept of material input per unit of service (MIPS) is quantified in terms of the second law of thermodynamics, allowing the calculation of both resource input and service output in exergy terms. This exergetic material input per unit of service (EMIPS) has been elaborated for transport technology. The service not only takes into account the total mass to be transported
and the total distance, but also the mass per single transport and the delivery time. The applicability of the EMIPS methodology relates specifically to the transport system and allows an effective coupling with life cycle assessment. The exergy analysis according to EMIPS allowed the definition of a precise strategy for reducing environmental impacts of transport toward more sustainable transport. Such a strategy requires the reduction of the weight of vehicles, sustainable styles of driving, reducing the friction of tires, encouraging electric and hybrid vehicles, improving the walking and cycling environment in cities, and by enhancing the role of public transport, especially electric rail.

==History==

===Carnot===
In 1824, Sadi Carnot studied the improvements developed for steam engines by James Watt and others. Carnot utilized a purely theoretical perspective for these engines and developed new ideas. He wrote:
The question has often been raised whether the motive power of heat is unbounded, whether the possible improvements in steam engines have an assignable limit—a limit by which the nature of things will not allow to be passed by any means whatever... In order to consider in the most general way the principle of the production of motion by heat, it must be considered independently of any mechanism or any particular agent. It is necessary to establish principles applicable not only to steam-engines but to all imaginable heat-engines... The production of motion in steam-engines is always accompanied by a circumstance on which we should fix our attention. This circumstance is the re-establishing of equilibrium... Imagine two bodies A and B, kept each at a constant temperature, that of A being higher than that of B. These two bodies, to which we can give or from which we can remove the heat without causing their temperatures to vary, exercise the functions of two unlimited reservoirs...

Carnot next described what is now called the Carnot engine, and proved by a thought experiment that any heat engine performing better than this engine would be a perpetual motion machine. Even in the 1820s, there was a long history of science forbidding such devices. According to Carnot, &quot;Such a creation is entirely contrary to ideas now accepted, to the laws of mechanics and of sound physics. It is inadmissible.&quot;

This description of an upper bound to the work that may be done by an engine was the earliest modern formulation of the second law of thermodynamics. Because it involves no mathematics, it still often serves as the entry point for a modern understanding of both the second law and entropy. Carnot&#x27;s focus on heat engines, equilibrium, and heat reservoirs is also the best entry point for understanding the closely related concept of exergy.

Carnot believed in the incorrect caloric theory of heat that was popular during his time, but his thought experiment nevertheless described a fundamental limit of nature. As kinetic theory replaced caloric theory through the early and mid-19th century (&quot;see Timeline of thermodynamics&quot;), several scientists added mathematical precision to the first and second laws of thermodynamics and developed the concept of entropy. Carnot&#x27;s focus on processes at the human scale (above the thermodynamic limit) led to the most universally applicable concepts in physics. Entropy and the second-law are applied today in fields ranging from quantum mechanics to physical cosmology.

===Gibbs===
In the 1870s, Josiah Willard Gibbs unified a large quantity of 19th century thermochemistry into one compact theory. Gibbs&#x27;s theory incorporated the new concept of a chemical potential to cause change when distant from a chemical equilibrium into the older work begun by Carnot in describing thermal and mechanical equilibrium and their potentials for change. Gibbs&#x27;s unifying theory resulted in the thermodynamic potential state functions describing differences from thermodynamic equilibrium.

In 1873, Gibbs derived the mathematics of &quot;available energy of the body and medium&quot; into the form it has today. (See the equations above). The physics describing exergy has changed little since that time.

=== Helmholtz ===
In the 1880s, German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz derived the equation for the maximum work which can be reversibly obtained from a closed system.

=== Rant ===
In 1956, Yugoslav scholar Zoran Rant proposed the concept of Exergy, extending Gibbs and Helmholtz&#x27; work. Since then, continuous development in exergy analysis has seen many applications in thermodynamics, and exergy has been accepted as the maximum theoretical useful work which can be obtained from a system with respect to its environment.

<doc id="1075006" wikidata="Q140087" url="?curid=1075006" title="Zlatoust">
<text>Zlatoust (; ) is a city in Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia, located on the Ay River (in the Kama basin), west of Chelyabinsk. Population: 181,000 (1971); 161,000 (1959); 99,000 (1939); 48,000 (1926); 21,000 (1910).

==Etymology==
Apparently, the city&#x27;s name is derived from the Russian translation of &quot;Chrysostom&quot;, literally &quot;golden-mouthed&quot; in the original Greek, for the eloquent Saint John Chrysostom, because the city was founded near a church dedicated to that saint. In other languages the city is sometimes called &quot;Ызлататыс &quot;(Izlataltıs) or &quot;Зылатаус&quot; (Zılataus) in Tatar and &quot;Залатауыс&quot; in Bashkir.

==History==


Zlatoust was founded in 1754 due to the construction of the ironworks. In 1774–76, the workers of the plant took part in the insurrection led by Yemelyan Pugachev. In the early 19th century, Pavel Anosov made the first Russian bulat steel blades in Zlatoust. It was granted town status in 1865. From 1865 to 1919 Zlatoust was part of Ufa Governorate. The town is also known for the first cannons made of Russian steel. In 1903, the Tsarist authorities brutally suppressed a strike, organized by the workers of Zlatoust.

In 1815, an arms factory was built here, which began to produce sabres and swords. To establish production, more than a hundred experts were invited from renowned arms centers in Europe, including Solingen and Klingenthal (Germany). In summer 1816, the first batch of Zlatoust blades was sent to Saint-Petersburg, both combat weapons and decorated samples. Famous artists Ivan Bushuyev and Ivan Boyarshinov authored unique patterns of cold-steel decorated with engravings. Bushuyev&#x27;s and Boyarshinov&#x27;s swords are very rare; under 2 dozen are believed to exist today, all in Russian state museums and wealthy Russians&#x27; collections (rare published example). The flying winged horse was a favorite element of many of Bushuyev&#x27;s engravings, so he was given a nickname Ivan the Wingy (Ivanko Krylatko). Since then, a pegasus has been an emblem of the town. In the 1840s the engraving was shifted onto decorative metal plates. This idea was suggested by Zlatoust factory&#x27;s director - Pavel Petrovich Anosov, who was taking care of factory&#x27;s profit and decided to expand the product range. Since then Zlatoust engraving on household items and tableware became popular. The Soviets gained control over Zlatoust in March 1918. The town was occupied by the Whites between June 1918 and July 1919. On 13 July 1919, Zlatoust was seized by the Red Army.

During the Soviet period, Zlatoust became an industrial city, which specialized in metallurgy, mechanical engineering, tool-making, food production, and other industries. Zlatoust is one of the centers of artistic engraving on metal in Russia. Traditionally, such engravings were done on weapons, such as knives, swords and tableware. Zlatoust engraving on metal received an impulse to a new development, when in the 1960s young graduates of art Zlatoust schools started to work at the factory and reveal their talents.

<doc id="1075011" wikidata="Q724350" url="?curid=1075011" title="Gyaincain Norbu">
<text>Chökyi Gyalpo, also referred to by his secular name Gyaincain Norbu or Gyaltsen Norbu (born 13 February 1990), is considered the 11th Panchen Lama by the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). He is also the vice president of the Buddhist Association of China. Gyalpo is considered by critics to be a proxy of the Chinese government.

Gyalpo&#x27;s position as Panchen Lama is disputed by the earlier recognition of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, by the 14th Dalai Lama. Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, along with his family and Chadrel Rinpoche, the then-incumbent Khenpo of Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, were kidnapped and/or arrested then detained in one or more unknown locations by the Chinese government in the days following the Dalai Lama&#x27;s official recognition of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima. The Tibetan administration in exile (Central Tibetan Administration) does not recognize the Chinese government&#x27;s selection using the Golden Urn, but some monks in Chinese-controlled Tibetan monasteries do refer to the Chinese government&#x27;s selection as the Panchen Lama.

==Names==
Gyaincain Norbu&#x27;s full religious name is Jêzün Lobsang Qamba Lhünzhub Qögyi&#x27;gyäbo Bäsangbo, although he is generally called Qoigyijabu (). Meaning &quot;Dharma king&quot;, this name can also be written Qögyi&#x27;gyäbo, Qögyi Gyäbo, Qoigyi&#x27;gyaibo, Qoigyi Gyaibo, Chökyi Gyalpo, Choekyi Gyalpo, or, in Wylie transliteration, &quot;Chos-kyi rGyal-po&quot;. The Chinese equivalent is &quot;Quèjí Jiébù&quot; ().

The secular name, Gyaincain Norbu (), can also be written Gyaencaen Norbu, Gyancain Norbu, or Gyaltsen Norbu.

==Biography==
Gyaincain Norbu was born on 13 February 1990 in Lhari County in northern Tibet Autonomous Region. He had been living in Beijing during his early childhood to be educated in a Chinese way, and travelled to Tashilhunpo Monastery for his enthronement in November/December 1995, in Shigatse, the official seat of the Panchen Lamas. Since his selection by the Chinese government as the Panchen Lama he has studied Tibetan Buddhism; to his studies he added Tibetan language, sutra, and logic at ten, and he is bilingual in both Tibetan and Chinese. He spent most of his later childhood studying Buddhism in Beijing. In a rare appearance for his adolescent age, Norbu delivered a speech in Tibetan for the opening ceremony of the 2006 World Buddhist Forum about Buddhism and national unity. One Western press outlet reported a cold reception among delegates, with fellow Buddhists making no attempt to greet Gyaltsen Norbu during greeting ceremonies ahead of the conference on Wednesday. Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama had not been invited, because he is viewed by China as &quot;a long-time stubborn secessionist who has tried to split his Chinese motherland and break the unity among different ethnic groups.&quot;

Two years later, in 2008, he denounced anti-Han riots in Lhasa, saying &quot;We resolutely oppose all activities to split the country and undermine ethnic unity&quot;. China sees him as &quot;the public face of Tibetan Buddhism&quot;.

On 3 February 2010, Norbu was elected vice president of the Buddhist Association of China. Later that month, at 20 years old, Norbu became the youngest member of the advisory body National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Vice chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region Hao Peng praised his appointment, in particular for Norbu&#x27;s &quot;demonstrating the role of the living Buddhas in Tibetan Buddhism and encouraging more believers to participate in state affairs&quot;. He was not, however, made vice chairman of the CPPCC, as Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama was and was widely expected of Norbu. Still, the Tibetan government in exile expressed concern that his appointment could prejudice his position on the next Dalai Lama, who normally requires approval from the Panchen Lama.

In May 2010, he reported to the ethnically Tibetan earthquake zone of the 2010 Yushu earthquake and held prayer services for victims. In June, he gave speeches at Tibet University and Tibet University of Traditional Tibetan Medicine in Lhasa promoting the value of education. In response to the 2010 Gansu mudslide, in which Zhugqu County, a third of which is populated by Tibetans, was hit, he donated ¥50,000 to relief efforts and prayed for the victims. He pays visits to the Tashilhunpo Monastery, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, although he does not live there. The &quot;Asia Times&quot; describes him as &quot;A slight man who wears thick glasses and traditional crimson robes&quot;.
In Hong Kong on 26 April 2012 Gyaincain gave his first appearance outside of mainland China to address over a thousand monks at the Third World Buddhist Forum on the topic of Dharma.

===Selection===
Following the death of the Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama in 1989, both the Tibetan government in exile and the Chinese government started parallel processes in the six-year-long search for the 11th Panchen Lama.

The head of the Chinese government&#x27;s Panchen Lama search committee at the time, Chadrel Rinpoche, was able to secretly communicate with the Dalai Lama. He planned to submit the Dalai Lama&#x27;s favored choice to the government. When the government learned of this, they arrested Chadrel in May 1995. The Dalai Lama moved to pre-empt China&#x27;s choice, and proclaimed his own preferred candidate, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, as the 11th incarnation of the Panchen Lama. Four days later, Chinese security forces escorted him from his home in Lhari County, stating that he &quot;was at risk of being kidnapped by Tibetan separatists&quot;. China rejects Nyima as being &quot;arbitrarily&quot; chosen, while the Tibetan government in exile similarly insists on its candidate&#x27;s legitimacy.

Chadrel was replaced on the search committee by Sengchen Lobsang Gyaltsen. The new committee decided to choose the Panchen Lama from a list of finalists by drawing lots from a Golden Urn. The Chinese custom of using the Golden Urn had been introduced in the year 1792 by the Qianlong Emperor and used to select the 10th, 11th, and 12th Dalai Lamas. Four days before his death, the China Tibet Information Center reports, the 10th Panchen Lama requested that the Golden Urn process be used to select his successor. According to Arjia Rinpoche, an important lama who attended the ceremony, Ye Xiaowen, the central government official in charge of the Panchen Lama issue, stated privately that the selection had been rigged in favor of Gyaincain Norbu.

Six-year-old Gyaincain Norbu was selected on 8 December 1995 with the religious name Qoigyijabu. Exiled Tibetan abbot Arjia Rinpoche, alleges that an official told him that the ceremony, which he attended, was rigged in favor of Norbu. Gyaincain Norbu was enthroned at Tashilhunpo Monastery and has since assumed the full functions of Panchen Lama. In attendance at the enthronement was the 8th Arjia Rinpoche, who in his book says, &quot;We had to prostrate to the so-called Panchen Lama...we had neither the respect for nor faith in this chosen child... I felt soiled by this gesture.&quot;

==Diplomatic meetings==
On 14 September 2010, the foreign minister of Singapore, George Yeo, became the first foreign member of government to meet officially with Gyaincain Norbu, at the Xihuang Monastery in Beijing.

<doc id="1075016" wikidata="Q4949842" url="?curid=1075016" title="Bouncing Off the Satellites">
<text>Bouncing off the Satellites is the fourth studio album by American new wave band the B-52&#x27;s, released on September 8, 1986, by Warner Bros. Records. It was recorded in July 1985 and was produced by Tony Mansfield. Founding member and guitarist Ricky Wilson died of AIDS after most of the work on the album was completed, but a year prior to its release. The band had gone on hiatus by the time &quot;Bouncing Off the Satellites&quot; was released, and it took three years for the band to recover from Wilson&#x27;s death and release their next studio album, &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot;.

==Recording==
&quot;Bouncing off the Satellites&quot; was recorded in July 1985.

According to Kate Pierson, &quot;Wig&quot; was written and recorded after the band&#x27;s label, Warner Bros., asked them to write a hit song for the album. The band had the title in mind for years and devised the song via a jam session.

A backwards message was deliberately inserted into the song &quot;Detour Thru Your Mind&quot;: in the last 30 seconds of the track, Fred Schneider says, &quot;I buried my parakeet in the backyard. Oh no, you&#x27;re playing the record backwards. Watch out, you might ruin your needle.&quot;

===Death of Ricky Wilson===
During the recording, guitarist Ricky Wilson was suffering from AIDS. Keith Strickland was the only bandmate who was informed of Wilson&#x27;s illness. Strickland later stated that Wilson &quot;was very protective, particularly of Cindy and his family&quot;, due to the public&#x27;s misconceptions about AIDS.

On October 12, 1985, Wilson finally succumbed to the illness, at the age of 32. Pierson has stated that Wilson worked on the album in its entirety prior to his death, and that it was completed. Strickland later recalled, &quot;After Ricky Wilson died, we felt that the band was finished. We couldn&#x27;t imagine continuing without him. So, we each went our separate ways.&quot; The band took a hiatus from their musical careers until they reformed in 1988 for the recording of their next studio album, &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot;.

==Release and promotion==
The album was finally released on September 8, 1986. Devastated at Wilson&#x27;s death, the band did not tour and were involved in minimal promotion for the album. However, the band did produce a music video for &quot;Girl from Ipanema Goes to Greenland&quot;, which Schneider has stated was both &quot;bittersweet&quot; and the best video they ever made.

Pierson later stated, &quot;Warner Bros. figured since we weren&#x27;t touring after Ricky died that they would just not promote the record. We all went through so many changes—especially without touring, and the record just dropped like a stone—and we all dealt with our grief.&quot; Pierson also theorized that the label did not promote the album because the band stated they had no intention of hiring a new guitar player to replace Wilson, thus the label assumed the band would not continue on without him. However, on August 5, 1987, the band appeared on the British ITV show &quot;Hold Tight!&quot;, miming to the song &quot;Wig&quot;, with Strickland now on guitar and Ralph Carney credited on-screen for drums. Carney had previously played saxophone on the B-52&#x27;s&#x27; &quot;Mesopotamia&quot; (1982) and &quot;Whammy!&quot; (1983) releases, and had subsequently toured with the band.

==Reception==
===Commercial===
Despite the relative lack of promotion, &quot;Summer of Love&quot; was released as the lead single and initially received a considerable amount of airplay from some radio stations, managing to peak at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart. Pierson later recalled that Warner Bros. employee Steve Baker had tried to get the label to promote the album in light of the single&#x27;s success, to no avail. Subsequently, the album only reached No. 85 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

===Critical===
Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; felt Pierson&#x27;s and Cindy Wilson&#x27;s contributions to the album were &quot;watercolors posing as Kenny Scharfs—not only don&#x27;t &#x27;Summer of Love&#x27; and &#x27;She Brakes for Rainbows&#x27; redeem anybody&#x27;s &#x27;60s retro, they don&#x27;t even take off on it&quot;, adding that &quot;Fred&#x27;s abrasive camp saves the day&quot;. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; opined, &quot;The first side is entirely delightful, filled with such classic B-52 silliness as &#x27;Wig,&#x27; &#x27;Detour Thru Your Mind&#x27; and &#x27;Girl from Ipanema Goes to Greenland,&#x27; but the flip is overly smooth, limp and uninspired.&quot;

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated, &quot;Considering their loss, it&#x27;s not surprising that the B-52&#x27;s don&#x27;t sound entirely focused throughout the record&quot;, adding that &quot;There are so many musicians on the record that it winds up sounding too carefully considered -- the polar opposite of the loose, inspired fun of their early work.&quot; Similarly, in &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), J.D. Considine felt the album &quot;flops miserably&quot; and sounds &quot;hollow and contrived&quot;, due to the addition of session players. Rich Wilhelm of &quot;PopMatters&quot; called the album &quot;wistful&quot; and &quot;subdued&quot;, concluding that it is &quot;the most subtle of the B-52s&#x27; albums, with the loss of Ricky Wilson adding to the album&#x27;s poignancy.&quot; &quot;The Spectator&quot; felt the album is darker and more melancholy than the band&#x27;s previous work. Brian Cullman in Spin described the album as &quot;clean, well-manicured, and dull&quot;.

<doc id="1075022" wikidata="Q5136698" url="?curid=1075022" title="Cluster decomposition">
<text>In physics, the cluster decomposition property states that experiments carried out far from each other cannot influence each other. Usually applied to quantum field theory, it requires that vacuum expectation values of operators localized in bounded regions factorize whenever these regions becomes sufficiently distant from each other. First formulated by Eyvind Wichmann and James H. Crichton in 1963 in the context of the &quot;S&quot;-matrix, it was conjectured by Steven Weinberg that in the low energy limit the cluster decomposition property, together with Lorentz invariance and quantum mechanics, inevitably lead to quantum field theory. String theory satisfies all three of the conditions and so provides a counter-example against this being true at all energy scales.

== Formulation ==

The &quot;S&quot;-matrix formula_1 describes the amplitude for a process with an initial state formula_2 evolving into a final state formula_3. If the initial and final states consist of two clusters, with formula_4 and formula_5 close to each other but far from the pair formula_6 and formula_7, then the cluster decomposition property requires the &quot;S&quot;-matrix to factorize

:formula_8

as the distance between the two clusters increases. The physical interpretation of this is that any two spatially well separated experiments formula_9 and formula_10 cannot influence each other. This condition is fundamental to the ability to doing physics without having to know the state of the entire universe. By expanding the &quot;S&quot;-matrix into a sum of a product of connected &quot;S&quot;-matrix elements formula_11, which at the perturbative level are equivalent to connected Feynman diagrams, the cluster decomposition property can be restated as demanding that connected &quot;S&quot;-matrix elements must vanish whenever some of its clusters of particles are far apart from each other.

This position space formulation can also be reformulated in terms of the momentum space &quot;S&quot;-matrix formula_12. Since its Fourier transformation gives the position space connected &quot;S&quot;-matrix, this only depends on position through the exponential terms. Therefore, performing a uniform translation in a direction formula_13 on a subset of particles will effectively change the momentum space &quot;S&quot;-matrix as

:formula_14

By translational invariance, a translation of all particles cannot change the &quot;S&quot;-matrix, therefore formula_15 must be proportional to a momentum conserving delta function formula_16 to ensure that the translation exponential factor vanishes. If there is an additional delta function of only a subset of momenta corresponding to some cluster of particles, then this cluster can be moved arbitrarily far through a translation without changing the &quot;S&quot;-matrix, which would violate cluster decomposition. This means that in momentum space the property requires that the &quot;S&quot;-matrix only has a single delta function.

Cluster decomposition can also be formulated in terms of correlation functions, where for any two operators formula_17 and formula_18 localized to some region, the vacuum expectation values factorize as the two operators become distantly separated

:formula_19 while if there are massless particles present then it can be as slow as formula_20.

<text>George Gordon McCrae (29 May 1833 – 15 August 1927) was an Australian poet.

==Early life==
McCrae was born in Leith, Scotland; his father was Andrew Murison McCrae, a writer; his mother was Georgiana McCrae, a painter. George attended a preparatory school in London, and later received lessons from his mother. Georgiana and her four sons emigrated to Melbourne in 1841 following her husband who emigrated in 1839.

==Career==
After a few years as a surveyor, McCrae joined the Victorian Government service, eventually becoming Deputy Registrar-General, and also a prominent figure in literary circles. Most of his leisure time was spent in writing. His first published work was &quot;Two Old Men&#x27;s Tales of Love and War&quot; (London, 1865).

His son Hugh McCrae, also a poet, produced a volume of memoirs (&quot;My Father and My Father&#x27;s Friends&quot;) about George and his association with such literary figures as Henry Kendall, Adam Lindsay Gordon, Richard Henry Horne and Marcus Clarke.

George McCrae wrote novels, stories, poetry, and travel sketches, and illustrated books. After his retirement, unpublished manuscripts entitled &#x27;Reminiscences—Experiences not Exploits&#x27; contain detailed descriptions of events from his youth and present a record of the early European part of Melbourne country-side.

==Late life==
McCrae died 15 August 1927 at Hawthorn in Melbourne, survived by four of his six children, including Dorothy Frances Perry, also an author.
