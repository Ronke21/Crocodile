<text>Vida Rochelle Blue Jr. (; July 28, 1949 – May 6, 2023) was an American professional baseball player. He was a left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball from 1969 to 1986, most notably as an integral member of the Oakland Athletics dynasty that won three consecutive World Series championships from 1972 to 1974. He won the American League (AL) Cy Young Award and Most Valuable Player Award in 1971.

A six-time All-Star, Blue was the first of only five pitchers in major league history to start the All-Star Game for both the American League (1971) and the National League (1978); Roger Clemens, Randy Johnson, Roy Halladay, and Max Scherzer are the others. During his 17-year career, he pitched for the Oakland Athletics (1969–1977), San Francisco Giants (1978–1981; 1985–86), and Kansas City Royals (1982–83).

==Early life==
Vida Blue was born and raised in Mansfield in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana. He was the oldest of six children born to Vida Blue, Sr, a laborer in a Mansfield iron foundry and his wife Sallie.

Blue attended DeSoto High School in Mansfield. He pitched for the baseball team and quarterbacked the football team. In his senior year of football, he threw for 3,400 yards and completed 35 touchdown passes while rushing for 1,600 yards. In his senior year of baseball, Blue threw a no-hitter with 21 strikeouts in just seven innings pitched.

==Baseball career==
Blue was a power pitcher who worked fast and attacked the strike zone. He threw an occasional curveball to keep hitters off balance and an above average change-up, but his signature pitch was a fastball which he threw consistently at , but could reach . In &quot;The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers&quot;, all-time hits leader Pete Rose stated that Blue &quot;threw as hard as anyone&quot; he ever faced, and baseball historian Bill James cited Blue as the hardest-throwing lefty, and the second-hardest thrower of his era, behind only Nolan Ryan.

===Oakland Athletics (1969–1977)===

The then-Kansas City Athletics selected Blue in the second round of the 1967 MLB draft. Though he was recruited to play college football for the University of Notre Dame, Purdue University, and the University of Houston, Blue chose to sign with the Athletics for $12,500 per year to help support his family after his father&#x27;s death.

Blue began the 1969 season with the Birmingham A&#x27;s, but was promoted to make his major league debut on July 20. In , after spending the season in the minor leagues with the Midwest League single A Burlington Bees and the Iowa Oaks of the American Association, Blue was called up in September, making two starts. On September 11, he shut out the Kansas City Royals 3–0, giving up only one hit, to Pat Kelly in the eighth inning. Ten days later, Blue no-hit the defending and eventual repeat American League West champion Minnesota Twins, 6–0, at Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, the lone baserunner coming on Harmon Killebrew&#x27;s fourth-inning walk. He was the fourth-youngest pitcher to throw a no-hitter.

Blue had a 24–8 record in 1971, an AL leading 1.82 ERA and eight shutouts, and struck out 301 batters, winning both the Cy Young Award and American League Most Valuable Player Award. He also led the American League in complete games (24), shutouts (8), and earned run average (1.82). That season, the Athletics won the American League West title for the franchise&#x27;s first postseason berth since the Philadelphia Athletics in the 1931 World Series. He got off to a terrific start, going 10–1 when he linked up with Boston&#x27;s Sonny Siebert, who was 8–0, in a dramatic May matchup in Boston. The game was won by Siebert and the Red Sox 4–3, and remains what is considered one of the most dramatic games in Fenway Park history. He was the youngest American League player to win the MVP Award in the 20th century. He was the starting pitcher for the American League in the 1971 All-Star Game. In 1971 he became the only player ever to be a starting pitcher in the league opener (against the Washington Senators), the All-Star Game, and the playoff opener (against the Baltimore Orioles) in the same season. In 1971, Blue was on the covers of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; magazine. In 1972, his success in baseball led Blue to a small role in the film &quot;Black Gunn&quot;, starring Jim Brown.

After Blue&#x27;s breakthrough season in 1971, he and Athletics owner Charlie Finley clashed over his salary. Blue, who had earned $14,000 in 1971, sought a $92,500 salary. He held out, missing much of the year, before Blue and Finley settled at $63,000. Blue ended up with a 6–10 record in spite of a 2.80 ERA in 1972. He did not make the Athletics&#x27; post-season starting rotation, instead pitching mainly in relief. Against the Cincinnati Reds in the 1972 World Series he made four appearances, including a save in Game 1, a blown save in Game 4, and a loss in a spot-start in Game 6.

Blue went 20–9 in 1973, 17–15 in 1974, and 22–11 in 1975, as an integral member of the Athletics&#x27; five straight American League Western Division pennants from 1971 to 1975, and three consecutive World Championships in 1972, 1973, and 1974. Perhaps his finest postseason performances were four innings of shutout relief work against the Detroit Tigers to save Game 5 of the 1972 American League Championship Series and a complete-game 1–0 shutout against the Orioles in Game 3 of the 1974 ALCS. On September 28, 1975, Blue, Glenn Abbott, Paul Lindblad, and Rollie Fingers combined to no-hit the California Angels 5–0.

After an 18–13 season with a 2.35 ERA in 1976, Blue told reporters, &quot;I hope the next breath Charlie Finley takes is his last. I hope he falls flat on his face and dies of polio.&quot; In June , baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn vetoed an attempt by Finley to sell Blue&#x27;s contract to the New York Yankees, and did the same thing on January 30, to a trade announced by the Reds at the Winter Meetings on December 9, 1977, that would&#x27;ve had Blue sent to Cincinnati for Dave Revering and $1.75 million. In both instances, Kuhn said the trades would be bad for baseball because they would benefit already powerful teams without making them give up any significant talent in return. At the end of the 1976 season, nearly the entire A&#x27;s roster of star players from Oakland&#x27;s championship teams left with baseball&#x27;s new free agency, or were traded off by Finley, leaving Blue, who was still under contract with Oakland, to mentor a new team of primarily rookies and other young players. Alvin Dark, who managed Blue in 1974 and 1975, was surprised that Blue had remained with the team, writing that he &quot;must have gotten the contract concessions he wanted.&quot; In the 1977 season, Blue went 14–19 with a 3.83 ERA and leading the AL both in hits and earned runs surrendered.

===San Francisco Giants (1978–1981)===
In March 1978, the Athletics traded Blue to the San Francisco Giants for Gary Thomasson, Gary Alexander, Dave Heaverlo, John Henry Johnson, Phil Huffman, Alan Wirth, and $300,000. Mario Guerrero was sent to the Athletics as a player to be named later to complete the transaction.

In 1978, Blue went 18–10 with a 2.79 ERA as he led the Giants to 89 wins and a third-place finish in the National League West Division, which was won by the Los Angeles Dodgers. He started for the National League in the 1978 All-Star Game. He won the &quot;Sporting News&quot; National League Pitcher of the Year.

Blue went 14–14 with a career worst 5.01 ERA as a full-time starter in 1979, 14–10 with a 2.97 ERA in 1980, and 8–6 with a 2.45 ERA in 1981, a strike-interrupted season.

===Kansas City Royals (1982–1983)===
The Giants traded Blue to the Kansas City Royals for Atlee Hammaker, Craig Chamberlain, Renie Martin, and Brad Wellman on March 30, 1982. He went 13–12 with a 3.78 ERA in 31 starts in 31 appearances. In 1983, Blue went 0–5 with a 6.01 ERA in 19 appearances, 13 of them starts. Blue was released mid-season, on August 6, 1983.

After the 1983 season, Blue and former teammates Willie Wilson, Jerry Martin, and Willie Aikens pleaded guilty to attempting to purchase cocaine. He was sentenced to three months in prison and was suspended for the 1984 season.

===San Francisco Giants (1985–1986)===
In April 1985, Blue returned as a free agent to the San Francisco Giants on a one-year deal. He went 8–8 with a 4.47 ERA in 33 appearances, 20 of them starts, the rest in middle-inning and mop-up relief.

In 1985, Blue testified in the Pittsburgh drug trials. 

Blue re-signed on another one-year deal in 1986, finishing his career going 10–10 with a 3.27 ERA in 28 appearances, all starts, at the age of 36. On April 20, he won his 200th career MLB game. Blue signed with the Oakland Athletics for the 1987 season, but announced his retirement in February 1987.

==Post-pitching career==
After baseball, Blue was a baseball analyst for NBC Sports Bay Area, the TV home of the San Francisco Giants.

Blue&#x27;s troubles with substance abuse continued to haunt him after his playing career, as he faced multiple DUI charges in 2005. He acknowledged that the trials may have influenced him being left off the Hall of Fame ballot after one year, stating, &quot;I had some issues in my life that might have had a tendency to sway voting. There are some guys in the Hall of Fame who don&#x27;t have halos.&quot;

===Charity work===
In 1971, Blue accompanied Bob Hope on his USO Christmas tour of Vietnam and other military installations. Blue remained active, working for numerous charitable causes including Safeway All Stars Challenge Sports, automobile donations, celebrity golf tournaments, and children&#x27;s charities.

Blue was also active promoting baseball in Costa Rica.

==Personal life and death==
In September 1989, Blue married Peggy Shannon on the pitcher&#x27;s mound at Candlestick Park. His best man was former teammate Willie McCovey and Orlando Cepeda escorted Shannon to the mound.

They had twin girls and divorced in 1996. He also had a son Derrick and two other daughters.

After retiring from baseball, Blue resided in California&#x27;s Twain Harte area in the Sierra Nevada foothills for many years, before moving to Tracy, California by 2007.

Blue died in a hospital in the East Bay on May 6, 2023, at the age of 73. According to Athletics&#x27; team officials, Blue died as a result of medical complications stemming from cancer.

<text>Closed-head injury is a type of traumatic brain injury in which the skull and dura mater remain intact. Closed-head injuries are the leading cause of death in children under 4 years old and the most common cause of physical disability and cognitive impairment in young people. Overall, closed-head injuries and other forms of mild traumatic brain injury account for about 75% of the estimated 1.7 million brain injuries that occur annually in the United States. Brain injuries such as closed-head injuries may result in lifelong physical, cognitive, or psychological impairment and, thus, are of utmost concern with regards to public health.

==Symptoms==
If symptoms of a head injury are seen after an accident, medical care is necessary to diagnose and treat the injury. Without medical attention, injuries can progress and cause further brain damage, disability, or death.

===Common symptoms===
Because the brain swelling that produces these symptoms is often a slow process, these symptoms may not surface for days to weeks after the injury.
Common symptoms of a closed-head injury include:
*headache
*dizziness
*nausea
*vomiting
*slurred speech

===Severe injury symptoms===
Severe head injuries can lead to permanent vegetative states or death, therefore being able to recognize symptoms and get medical attention is very important. Symptoms of a severe closed-head injury include:
*coma or vegetative states
*seizures or convulsions
*loss of consciousness

===Secondary symptoms ===
Secondary symptoms are symptoms that surface during rehabilitation from the injury including social competence issues, depression, personality changes, cognitive disabilities, anxiety, and changes in sensory perception. More than 50% of patients who suffer from a traumatic brain injury will develop psychiatric disturbances. Although precise rates of anxiety after brain injury are unknown, a 30-year follow-up study of 60 patients found 8.3% of patients developed a panic disorder, 1.7% developed an anxiety disorder, and 8.3% developed a specific phobia. Patients recovering from a closed-head or traumatic brain injury often suffer from decreased self-esteem and depression. This effect is often attributed to difficulties re-entering society and frustration with the rehabilitation process. Patients who have suffered head injuries also show higher levels of unemployment, which can lead to the development of secondary symptoms.

==Causes==
Closed-head injuries are caused primarily by vehicular accidents, falls, acts of violence, and sports injuries. Falls account for 35.2% of brain injuries in the United States, with rates highest for children ages 0–4 years and adults ages 75 years and older. Head injuries are more common in men than women across every age group. Boys aged 0–4 years have the highest rates of brain injury related hospital visits, hospitalizations, and deaths combined. Multiple mild traumatic brain injuries sustained over a short period of time (hours to weeks), often seen with sports-related injuries, can result in major neurological or cognitive deficits or fatality.

Blast-related traumatic brain injuries are often closed-head injuries and result from rapid changes in atmospheric pressure, objects dislodged by the blast hitting people, or people being thrown into motion by the blast Blast-related injuries have shown a recent increase in occurrence with the return of veterans from Iraq such that traumatic brain injury has been coined the &quot;signature injury&quot; of Operation Iraqi Freedom 

Closed-head injuries can range from mild injuries to debilitating traumatic brain injuries and can lead to severe brain damage or death. Common closed-head injuries include:

*concussion – a head injury resulting in temporary dysfunction of normal brain function. Almost half of the total concussions reported each year are sports-related 
*intracranial hematoma – a condition in which a blood vessel ruptures causing a pool of blood to form around the brain (subdural hematoma) or between the brain and the skull (epidural hematoma). Intracranial hematoma causes an increase in pressure on the brain and requires immediate medical attention.
*cerebral contusion – a bruise to the brain tissue as a result of trauma. Contusions are local in nature, separating them from concussions.
*diffuse axonal injury – These injuries are frequently seen in car accidents and cause permanent damage to the brain. Severe diffuse axonal injuries often lead to comas or vegetative states.

==Diagnosis==
===Classification===

====Glasgow Coma Scale====
The Glasgow Coma Scale is commonly used to assess the severity of traumatic brain injuries, including closed-head injuries. The scale tests a patient&#x27;s eye, verbal, and motor responses. The scale goes up to fifteen points; with fifteen being the most mild injury, less than eight being a severe brain injury, and three being a vegetative state.

====ASCOT====
The ASCOT probability of survival encapsulates several of the variables measured in the Glasgow Coma Scale but also includes systolic blood pressure, respiration rates upon admission, and anatomic injuries. The ASCOT was found to be the most sensitive tool for determining severity of head injuries in children and is effective in predicting the outcome of injury.

====Mechanism based====
A mechanism-based TBI classification system divides traumatic brain injuries (TBI) into closed and penetrating head trauma; based on the way in which the person was injured.

==Treatments==
There are several different types of treatment available to those who have suffered a closed-head injury. The treatment type chosen can depend on several factors including the type and severity of injury as well as the effects that injury has on the patient.
The course of treatment differs for each patient and can include several types of treatment, depending on the patient&#x27;s specific needs. 
Early treatment is vital to recovering lost motor function after an injury, but cognitive abilities can be recovered regardless of time past since injury.

===Pharmacotherapy===
Pharmacotherapy is the utilization of drugs to treat an illness. There are several different drugs that have been used to alleviate symptoms experienced after a head injury including anti-depressants such as amitriptyline and sertraline. Use of these drugs has been associated with a decrease in depression and increased functioning in social and work environments. An antidiuretic called Desmopressin Acetate (DDAVP) has also been shown to improve memory performance in patients
Recent studies have examined the preventative effects of progesterone on brain injuries. Phase III trials are currently being conducted at 17 medical centers across the United States. Preliminary results have shown a 50% reduction in mortality in those treated with progesterone and showed an improved functional outcome. 
Overall, the efficacy of pharmacotherapeutic treatments is dependent on the treatment being used and the symptoms being targeted by the treatment.

===Patient education===
Patient education has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to decrease secondary symptoms seen with closed-head injuries. Patient education often includes working with a therapist to review symptom management and learn about returning to regular activities. Educational initiatives have also been shown to decrease the occurrence of PTSD in head-injury survivors.

===Cognitive rehabilitation===
Many patients with severe injuries need therapy to regain basic motor and cognitive skills. Cognitive rehabilitation aims to improve attention, memory function, and cognitive-processing speed. The type of rehabilitation used is tailored to the patient&#x27;s clinical needs depending on the severity and type of injury sustained.

===Other===
Other types of rehabilitation focus on raising patient&#x27;s self-esteem by giving him tasks that can be successfully completed despite any cognitive changes as a result of the brain injury. This process can help decrease secondary symptoms such as feelings of worthlessness, depression, and social anxiety. Some rehabilitation programs use team-building exercises and problem-solving activities to help the patients learn to work with their disabilities.

==Prevention==
Many closed-head injuries can be prevented by proper use of safety equipment during dangerous activities. Common safety features that can reduce the likelihood of experiencing a brain injury include helmets, hard hats, car seats, and safety belts. Another safety precaution that can decrease a person&#x27;s risk for brain injury is &quot;not&quot; to drink and drive or allow oneself to be driven by a person who has been drinking or who is otherwise impaired.

Helmets can be used to decrease closed-head injuries acquired during athletic activities, and are considered necessary for sports such as American &quot;tackle&quot; football, where frequent head impacts are a normal part of the game. However, recent studies have questioned the effectiveness of even American football helmets, where the assumed protection of helmets promotes far more head impacts, a behavior known as risk compensation. The net result seems to have been an increase, not decrease, in injuries. The similar sports of Australian-rules football and rugby are always played helmetless, and see far fewer traumatic brain injuries. (See Australian rules football injuries.)

Bicycle helmets are perhaps the most promoted variety of helmet, based on the assumption that cycling without a helmet is a dangerous activity, with a large risk of serious brain injury. However, available data clearly shows that to be false. Cycling (with approximately 700 American fatalities per year from all medical causes) is a very minor source of fatal traumatic brain injury, whose American total is approximately 52,000 per year. Similarly, bicycling causes only 3% of America&#x27;s non-fatal traumatic brain injury.

Still, bicycle-helmet promotion campaigns are common, and many U.S jurisdictions have enacted mandatory bicycle-helmet laws for children. A few such jurisdictions, a few Canadian provinces, plus Australia and New Zealand mandate bicycle helmets even for adults. A bicycle-helmet educational campaign directed toward children claimed an increase in helmet use from 5.5% to 40.2% leading to a claimed decrease in bicycle-related head injuries by nearly 67%. However, other sources have shown that bicycle-helmet promotion reduces cycling, often with no per-cyclist reduction in traumatic brain injury.

Estimates of bicycle-helmet use by American adults vary. One study found that only 25-30% of American adults wear helmets while riding bicycles, despite decades of promotion and despite sport cyclists&#x27; adoption of helmets as part of their uniform. 

Following the commercial (as opposed to public-health) success of bicycle helmets, there have been successful attempts to promote the sale of ski helmets. Again, results have been less than impressive, with great increases in helmet use yielding no reduction in fatalities, and with most injury reduction confined to lacerations, contusions, and minor concussions, as opposed to more serious head injuries.

There have been rare campaigns for motoring helmets. Unfortunately, just as people greatly overestimate the traumatic brain injury danger of bicycling, they greatly underestimate the risk of motoring, which remains the largest source of traumatic brain injury in the developed world, despite the protective effects of seatbelts and airbags.

<doc id="1059041" wikidata="Q4380763" url="?curid=1059041" title="Penetrating head injury">
<text>A penetrating head injury, or open head injury, is a head injury in which the dura mater, the outer layer of the meninges, is breached. Penetrating injury can be caused by high-velocity projectiles or objects of lower velocity such as knives, or bone fragments from a skull fracture that are driven into the brain. Head injuries caused by penetrating trauma are serious medical emergencies and may cause permanent disability or death.

A penetrating head injury involves &quot;a wound in which an object breaches the cranium but does not exit it.&quot; In contrast, a perforating head injury is a wound in which the object passes through the head and leaves an exit wound.

==Cause==

In penetrating injury from high-velocity missiles, injuries may occur not only from initial laceration and crushing of brain tissue by the projectile, but also from the subsequent cavitation. High-velocity objects create rotations and can create a shock wave that cause stretch injuries, forming a cavity that is three to four times greater in diameter than the missile itself. A pulsating temporary cavity is also formed by a high-speed missile and can have a diameter 30 times greater than that of the missile. Though this cavity is reduced in size once the force ends, the tissue that was compressed during cavitation remains injured. Destroyed brain tissue may either be ejected from entrance or exit wounds, or packed up against the sides of the cavity formed by the missile.

Low-velocity objects usually cause penetrating injuries in the regions of the skull&#x27;s temporal bones or orbital surfaces, where the bones are thinner and thus more likely to break. Damage from lower-velocity penetrating injuries is restricted to the tract of the stab wound, because the lower-velocity object does not create as much cavitation. However, low-velocity penetrating objects may ricochet inside the skull, continuing to cause damage until they stop moving.

==Pathophysiology==
Though it is more likely to cause infection, penetrating trauma is similar to closed head injury such as cerebral contusion or intracranial hemorrhage. As in closed head injury, intracranial pressure is likely to increase due to swelling or bleeding, potentially crushing delicate brain tissue. Most deaths from penetrating trauma are caused by damage to blood vessels, which can lead to intracranial hematomas and ischemia, which can in turn lead to a biochemical cascade called the ischemic cascade. The injury in penetrating brain trauma is mostly focal (that is, it affects a specific area of tissue).

Studies with PET scanning and transcranial Doppler imaging have shown that changes in cerebral blood flow, such as hypoperfusion and vasospasm, can follow penetrating head injury. These changes can last for two weeks. An ischemic cascade similar to the course of cellular and metabolic events that follow other head injuries may follow penetrating head injuries. Sometimes in penetrating injuries, the brain releases thromboplastin, which can lead to problems with blood clotting.

While blunt trauma to the head does not present a risk of shock due to hemorrhage, penetrating head trauma does.

==Diagnosis and treatment==
A person with a penetrating head injury may be evaluated using X-ray, CT scan, or MRI (MRI can only be used when the penetrating object would not be magnetic, because MRI uses magnetism and could move the object, causing further injury).

Surgery may be required to debride or repair the injury or to relieve excessive intracranial pressure. Intracranial pressure is monitored and attempts are made to maintain it within normal ranges. Intravenous fluids are given and efforts are taken to maintain high blood oxygen levels.

==Prognosis==
The highest-velocity injuries tend to have the worst associated damage. A study published in 1991, which documented 314 individuals who had had penetrating cranial injuries caused by gunshot wounds, found that 73% died from their injuries at the scene of the incident, and a further 19% ultimately died later, thus indicating a total mortality rate of 92%. Perforating injuries have an even worse prognosis.

Penetrating head trauma can cause impairment or loss of abilities controlled by parts of the brain that are damaged. A famous example is Phineas Gage, whose personality appears to have changed (though not as dramatically as usually described) after a perforating injury to his frontal lobe(s).

People with subarachnoid hemorrhage, a blown pupil, respiratory distress, hypotension, or cerebral vasospasm are more likely to have worse outcomes.

People with penetrating head trauma may have complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and neurogenic pulmonary edema. Up to 50% of patients with penetrating brain injuries get late-onset post-traumatic epilepsy.

<text>A hybrid offence, dual offence, Crown option offence, dual procedure offence, offence triable either way, or wobbler is one of the special class offences in the common law jurisdictions where the case may be prosecuted either summarily or on indictment. In the United States, an alternative misdemeanor/felony offense (colloquially known as a wobbler) lists both county jail (misdemeanor sentence) and state prison (felony sentence) as possible punishment, for example, theft. 

==Canada==
The power to choose under which class a hybrid offence will be tried rests with the crown counsel. Hybrid offences can either be summary offences (minor crimes) or indictable offences (major crimes). For most indictable offences, a person has the right to trial by jury.

A hybrid offence is the most common type of charge in Canada. There are three types of charges and each will affect when one can apply for a Record Suspension.

Under the Criminal Records Act, Section 2.1, the Parole Board of Canada is the administrative tribunal that has the exclusive authority to make decisions regarding Record Suspensions. A Record Suspension is a formal means to remove the disadvantages associated with having a Criminal Record for people that have been convicted of a criminal offence. In order to apply for a Record Suspension an individual must complete an application that is later reviewed by the Board and a decision to grant, or deny the application is made by an officer. Under Section 7, the Parole Board of Canada also has the ability to revoke granted Record Suspensions if there is a breach in good conduct on the part of the applicant or if a person reoffends and commits an indictable offence and even in some cases a summary offence.

==England and Wales==
When an enactment in the United Kingdom creates an offence, it generally specifies what penalties apply &quot;on summary conviction&quot; or &quot;on conviction on indictment&quot;. In relation to England and Wales, the first expression refers to a trial in a magistrates&#x27; court without a jury before a district judge or a panel of magistrates, while the latter refers to a trial in the Crown Court by jury. Some offences allow either mode of trial, and as such the Interpretation Act 1978 defines the expression &quot;triable either way&quot; to describe an offence which, if committed by an adult, is triable either on indictment or summarily. By contrast a &quot;summary offence&quot; is one that is &quot;not&quot; defined as triable on indictment (cannot normally be tried in the Crown Court), whereas &quot;indictable offence&quot; includes an either way offence.

In some cases an offence may be triable only summarily because the amount of money at issue is small (section 22 of the Magistrates&#x27; Courts Act 1980), or an offence that can normally be tried only summarily may nonetheless be tried on indictment along with other offences that are themselves indictable (Part V of the Criminal Justice Act 1988); these circumstances do not affect whether an offence is described as &quot;summary&quot;, &quot;indictable&quot;, or &quot;either way&quot;. Offences committed by offenders under 18 are usually tried in the Youth Court, which has different procedures.

When a person is charged with an either-way offence, the decision as to which court will hear the case is determined at a Mode of Trial hearing before a magistrates&#x27; court. The court decides if the case is suitable to be heard in a magistrates&#x27; court. If they decide that the case is either too serious or too complex, or another offence is being charged which is triable only on indictment, they can send the case to the Crown Court, in which case the defendant has no say in the matter. If the magistrates decide that the case is suitable to be heard by the magistrates, then the defendant is asked for consent to do so. The defendant can then either consent to be tried summarily (though likely in a different hearing on a later date) or opt for trial by jury at the Crown Court, provided that they have pleaded not guilty. If they have pleaded guilty then they have no say in the matter – thus there is no way for a defendant to agree to plead guilty in exchange for having a case dealt with by magistrates.

Magistrates&#x27; courts have limited powers of sentencing; for example, they may not impose a sentence of imprisonment longer than twelve months. If the defendant is tried summarily in a magistrates&#x27; court and is convicted, there may still be a committal to the Crown Court for sentencing if the magistrates think that their sentencing powers are inadequate. Thus it is not possible for a defendant to avoid the harsher sentences available in the Crown Court simply by accepting a summary trial.

===History===
The expression &quot;hybrid offence&quot; was applicable to an offence triable either on indictment or summarily. It was applicable to offences to which section 18 of the Magistrates&#x27; Courts Act 1952 applied.

See sections 14(c) and 64 of the Criminal Law Act 1977.

==Scotland==
In Scots law, all common law offences other than those within the exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court of Justiciary (i.e. murder, treason, rape and breach of duty by magistrates) can be tried either summarily in the justice of the peace courts or Sheriff Courts, or on indictment (also referred to as solemn procedure) in the High Court of Justiciary or Sheriff Court. For statutory offences, the statute will provide whether the offence is triable summarily, on indictment, or both.

The choice of forum is a matter for the Lord Advocate and procurator fiscal, and is determined in a process known as marking.

==United States==
In U.S. states in which these offenses occur, the prosecuting attorney has discretion in deciding which category to charge the defendant. Prosecutors may strategically file such offenses as felonies, agreeing to refile the charge as a misdemeanor should the defendant consent to a guilty plea.

After hearing evidence at a preliminary hearing, the judge or magistrate has discretion to reduce a felony wobbler to a misdemeanor charge; the opposite is not permitted.

In juvenile court, after a minor is declared to be delinquent following a bench trial or open plea, the judge may classify a wobbler felony as a misdemeanor instead.

===California===
In California, one example of a wobbler offense is grand theft (PC487). In this case, the judge has the power to reduce a felony charge of this type to a misdemeanor during various stages of the proceeding, including the preliminary hearing all the way until after a defendant completes probation.

<text>West Montlake Park is a park by Portage Bay in the Montlake neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. The park is bounded on the north by the Montlake Cut, on the west by Portage Bay, on the south by the Seattle Yacht Club marina, and on the east by West Park Drive E. It is connected to East Montlake Park by the 1971 Montlake Cut Waterside Trail, which runs along the cut and passes under the Montlake Bridge.

The park was acquired by the city in 1909. The park has paths, an observation deck, a
fishing pier, and benches. It was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1971.

<doc id="1059049" wikidata="Q4460503" url="?curid=1059049" title="USS Lea">
<text>USS &quot;Lea&quot; (DD-118) was a in the United States Navy during World War I and World War II. She was named in honor of Edward Lea, a US Navy officer killed during the American Civil War.

&quot;Lea&quot; was laid down on 18 September 1917 by William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia. The ship was launched on 29 April 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Harry E. Collins. The destroyer was commissioned on 2 October 1918, Lieutenant Commander David W. Bagley in command.

==Service history==
After service in the Atlantic with DesRon 19 during 1919, &quot;Lea&quot; transferred to the Pacific Fleet in 1920 and served primarily along the West Coast during the years between the wars. She was out of commission at San Diego from 22 June 1922 to 1 May 1930 and 7 April 1937 to 30 September 1939. She sailed for the East Coast to join the Neutrality Patrol, guarding the western Atlantic through the tense months before the US entry into World War II. She served in the force guarding transports carrying marines for the occupation of Iceland on 8 July 1941.

===World War II===
For the first 2 years of U.S. participation in the war, &quot;Lea&quot; had convoy escort duty in the North Atlantic, the Caribbean Sea, and along the eastern seaboard, hazarded by peak U-boat activity and dangerous weather conditions. She rescued survivors from stricken merchant ships as well as fighting off submarines and joining in several successful attacks.

The first of her many wartime rescues at sea came in February 1942, when she took on board the crew of Soviet merchant vessel &quot;Dvinoles&quot;, abandoned after collision damage. Later that month, 24 February, came a daylong battle with submarines when &quot;Lea&quot; and fellow escorts again and again dashed out from their convoy screen to keep down attacking U-boats which had sunk four of the merchantmen.

Between 22 April 1943 and 30 May, &quot;Lea&quot; joined the hunter-killer group formed around the escort carrier in the first mission of such a group. On 21 May and 22 May, &quot;Bogue&quot;″s aircraft became the first to engage a wolfpack attempting to rendezvous for a mass attack on a convoy. So successful were their six attacks in protecting the convoy that the group was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation in which &quot;Lea&quot; shared.

==Convoys escorted==
==Auxiliary service==
On 31 December 1943, &quot;Lea&quot; was five days out of New York on convoy escort duty when she was rammed by a merchant ship. Towed to Bermuda and later Boston, she completed repairs on 28 June 1944, and began sailing from Newport as target ship for torpedo planes and escorting carriers during flight training. Between January and June 1945, she had similar duty off Florida. Arriving Philadelphia on 14 June, she decommissioned there on 20 July 1945. &quot;Lea&quot; was struck from the Navy Register on 13 August 1945. The ship was sold for scrapping to Boston Metals Salvage Company, Baltimore on 30 November 1945.

==Awards==
* Presidential Unit Citation
* Victory Medal with &quot;DESTROYER&quot; clasp
* American Defense Service Medal with &quot;FLEET&quot; clasp and &quot;A&quot; device
* American Campaign Medal with two battle stars
* European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with one battle star
* World War II Victory Medal

As of 2013, no other ships in the United States Navy have borne this name.

<doc id="1059050" wikidata="Q39472" url="?curid=1059050" title="Greensboro massacre">
<text>The Greensboro massacre was a deadly confrontation which occurred on November 3, 1979, in Greensboro, North Carolina, US, when members of the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party (ANP) shot and killed five participants in a &quot;Death to the Klan&quot; march which was organized by the Communist Workers Party (CWP).

The event had been preceded by inflammatory rhetoric. The Greensboro city police department had an informant within the KKK and ANP group who notified them that the Klan was prepared for armed violence. As the two opposing groups came in contact with each other at the onset of the march, both sides exchanged gunfire. The CWP and its supporters had handguns, while members of the KKK and the ANP had a variety of firearms. The people who were killed included four members of the CWP, who had originally come to Greensboro to support workers&#x27; rights activism among mostly black textile industry workers in the area. In addition to the five deaths, nine demonstrators, two news crew members, and a Klansman were wounded.

Two criminal trials of several of the Klan and ANP members were conducted by state and federal prosecutors. In the first trial, conducted by the state, five were charged with first-degree murder and felony riot. All of the defendants were acquitted, although one had pleaded guilty earlier to a conspiracy charge for firing the first shot. In 1980, the surviving protesters, led by the Christic Institute, filed a separate civil suit against 87 defendants. The suit alleged civil rights violations, failure to protect demonstrators, and wrongful death. Eight defendants were found liable for the wrongful death of the one protester who was not a member of the CWP. A third federal criminal civil rights trial in 1984 was held against nine defendants. Again, all of the defendants were acquitted by a jury that accepted their claims of self-defense, despite reports of &quot;vivid newsreel film to the contrary&quot;. News outlets, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and the &quot;News &amp; Record&quot; in Greensboro, North Carolina have remarked on the all-white juries which tried the 1979 and 1984 cases.
In 2004, 25 years after the event, a private organization formed the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission with the intention to investigate the events of 1979. Though the private organization was limited in its investigation because it failed to secure authority or local sanction, its Final Report concluded that both sides had engaged in inflammatory rhetoric, but that the Klan and ANP members had intended to inflict injury on protesters, and the police department was complicit with the Klan by allowing anticipated violence to take place. In 2009, the Greensboro City Council passed a resolution expressing regret for the deaths in the march. In 2015, the city unveiled a marker to memorialize the Greensboro Massacre. On August 15, 2017 and on October 6, 2020, the Greensboro City Council formally apologized for the massacre.

The incident marked a convergence of American neo-Nazi and Ku Klux Klan movements, which previously operated without cooperation.
==Background==
The Communist Workers&#x27; Party (CWP) had its origin in 1973 in New York as a splinter group of the Communist Party USA. &quot;The CWP was one of several groups which were established as part of a Maoist revival within the radical community. To the Maoists, the pro-Soviet Communist Party USA was soft on capitalism and it also lacked militancy.&quot; Its leaders intended to increase activism in what they called the Workers Viewpoint Organization (WVO), along the Maoist model. In 1979, members of the CWP came to North Carolina in an attempt to organize textile workers. In the South, the communists had achieved little success with white workers, so they shifted much of their attention to black textile workers, who had long been excluded from these jobs in previous decades. As a result of these efforts, the CWP came into conflict with a local Ku Klux Klan chapter and the American Nazi Party. Some CWP members also worked in the textile mills, including James Waller, who left his medical practice to do so. He became president of the local textile workers union. WVO members were active in Durham and Greensboro.

The WVO resisted the continuation of racial discrimination in North Carolina by confronting a local KKK chapter. Hostility between the groups flared up in July 1979, when protesters in China Grove, North Carolina, disrupted a screening of &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, a 1915 silent film by D. W. Griffith which portrays the end of the era of Reconstruction and the formation of the KKK in heroic terms, and portrayed blacks in a demeaning, racist way. Taunts and inflammatory rhetoric were exchanged between members of the groups during the ensuing months.

In October 1979, the WVO renamed itself the Communist Workers Organization. It planned to stage a rally and a march against the Klan on November 3, 1979, in Greensboro. The county seat of Guilford County, this city had been a site of major civil rights actions in the 1960s. Sit-ins resulted in the desegregation of lunch counters. The CWP entitled their protest as the &quot;Death to the Klan March&quot;; the event was scheduled to start in a predominantly black housing project called Morningside Homes on the black side of town, and to proceed to the Greensboro City Hall. The CWP distributed flyers that called for radical, even violent opposition to the Klan. One flier said that the Klan &quot;should be physically beaten and chased out of town. This is the only language they understand. Armed self-defense is the only defense.&quot; Communist organizers publicly challenged the Klan to attend the march.

==Rally==
Four local TV news camera teams arrived at Morningside Homes at the corner of Carver and Everitt streets to cover the protest march. Members of the CWP and other anti-Klan supporters gathered to rally the march, which was planned to proceed through the city to the Greensboro City Hall.

As the marchers collected, a caravan of nine cars and a van filled with an estimated 40 KKK and American Nazi Party members drove back and forth in front of the housing project at around 11:20 AM. The two groups heckled each other, and some marchers beat the cars with picket sticks and kicks. The first shot came from the head of the KKK caravan, although it wasn&#x27;t clear who fired the shot. Several witnesses reported that Klansman Mark Sherer fired first, into the air. A &quot;thick blue smoke&quot; was spotted after the first shot, consistent with the discharge from a black powder pistol Sherer owned. A second shot was fired into the air by Klansman Brent Fletcher, and shots three and four by Sherer, into the ground and a parked car. Some KKK and ANP members exited their vehicles and engaged in a physical confrontation with marchers. CWP member James Waller equipped himself with a shotgun from fellow marcher Tom Clark&#x27;s truck during the confrontation. Klansman Roy Toney spotted him and struggled with Waller for control of the shotgun, which went off during the struggle. 

The first shots wounding and killing individuals were discharged soon after, primarily by caravan members. Six caravan members equipped themselves with long guns from the trunk of a Ford Fairlane and fired at the marchers, while the rest of the cars and their occupants fled. Marchers Bill Sampson, Allen Blitz, Rand Manzella, and Claire Butler fired back at the caravan members with handguns. Two of the first fatalities were Waller, shot by ANP member Roland Wood and Klansman David Matthews, and CWP member Cesar Cauce, shot by Klansman Jerry Paul Smith. Both were unarmed at the time of their deaths. Unarmed marcher Michael Nathan was shot and mortally wounded by Matthews while running towards Waller&#x27;s body. Sampson was killed while firing at the caravan members. Matthews shot and killed CWP member Sandra Smith while she was taking cover near Butler, who was firing at caravan members. Smith herself was unarmed. The final shot was fired by Blitz 88 seconds after the violence first began.

Four CWP members were killed at the scene and Nathan died of his wounds at the hospital two days later. Twelve others were wounded. The filmed coverage of the shootings was carried on national and international news, and the event became known as the &quot;Greensboro Massacre.&quot; Smith was black, Cauce was Hispanic, and the other three men killed were white. Both blacks and whites were among the wounded, including one KKK member and two news crew members.

===Role of the police===
By the late 1970s, most police departments had become familiar with handling demonstrations, especially in cities such as Greensboro where numerous civil rights events had taken place since 1960. CWP march organizers had filed their plans for this march with the police and gained permission to hold it. Police generally covered such formal events in order to prevent outbreaks of violence; few officers were present during this march. A police photographer and a detective followed the Klan and neo-Nazi caravan to the site, but they did not attempt to directly intervene in events.

Edward Dawson, a Klansman-turned FBI/police informant was riding in the lead car of the caravan. He had been an FBI informant since 1969 as part of the agency&#x27;s COINTELPRO program. He was among the founders of the North Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan when the North Carolina chapter of the United Klans of America split. By 1979 he was working as an informant for the Greensboro Police Department. He was given a copy of the march route by the police and informed them of the potential for violence. 

The police detective who trailed the caravan radioed for extra units at 11:23 AM. The first to arrive were two tactical officers two minutes later, who arrested twelve caravan members from the van. However, the cars and their occupants were able to escape from the scene. Some marchers were also arrested later on as other police units converged on the scene. 

Bernard Butkovich, an undercover agent for the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), had infiltrated a unit of the American Nazi Party (ANP) during this period. This group had been formed by Frank Collin, who had been ousted from the National Socialist White People&#x27;s Party. The ANP members joined with the KKK chapter to disrupt the November 1979 protest march. At the 1980 criminal trial, the neo-Nazis claimed that Butkovich encouraged them to carry firearms to the demonstration. At the 1985 civil trial, Butkovich testified that he was aware that the KKK and ANP members intended to confront the demonstrators, but he did not tell the police or any other law enforcement agency.

==Aftermath==
===Funeral===
A funeral for the five victims was held on November 11, 1979, followed by a procession in which 200–400 people marched through the city to Maplewood Cemetery. There was controversy over whether or not the funeral should be held, but the city had arranged for full coverage by the police force and hundreds of armed National Guard troops to protect marchers.

===Gravestone===
The four white men were buried in the traditionally all-black cemetery near Morningside. The inscription intended for their memorial was initially opposed by the city council, citing new ordinances banning political speech in that context. With support from the North Carolina ACLU, the CWP proceeded to commemorate these four with the following inscription:

The body of Sandi Smith, who was African American, was returned at her family&#x27;s request to her hometown in South Carolina for burial.

===State&#x27;s prosecution===
Forty Klansmen and neo-Nazis, and several CWP marchers were said to have taken part in the shootings. The police arrested 16 Klansmen, neo-Nazis, and several CWP members. The FBI started an investigation which it called GREENKIL (Greensboro Killings), turning over evidence it gathered to the state of North Carolina for its murder trial.

The state attorney prosecuted the six strongest criminal cases first, charging five Klansmen with murder: David Wayne Matthews, Jerry Paul Smith, Jack Wilson Fowler, Harold Dean Flowers, and Billy Joe Franklin. One was charged with a lesser crime. In November 1980 the jury acquitted all the defendants, finding that they had acted in self-defense. Residents of Morningside Homes — the housing development where the violence occurred, and students at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (A&amp;T), expressed shock and anger over the verdict and a feeling of hopelessness regarding the judicial system and the Ku Klux Klan.

===Federal criminal trial===
The Department of Justice through the FBI had an extensive criminal investigation underway. After the acquittals in 1980, the FBI re-opened its investigation in preparation for a federal prosecution. Based on additional evidence, a federal grand jury indicted nine men on civil rights charges in 1983. In 1983, Sherer pleaded guilty to a federal conspiracy charge for firing the first shot. He was sentenced to six months in a community treatment center and five years of probation. He was the only person found guilty of a crime in the case.

The case brought by the US attorney &quot;charged the Klansmen and neo-Nazis with racially motivated violence and with interference in a racially integrated event.&quot; Three men were charged with violating the civil rights of the five victims: the defendants were David Wayne Matthews, Jerry Paul Smith and Jack Wilson Fowler, who had been prosecuted and acquitted in the state criminal trial.

Six other men were charged with &quot;conspiracy to violate the demonstrators&#x27; civil rights:&quot; Virgil Lee Griffin, Sr.; Eddie Dawson (also a police informant), Roland Wayne Wood, Roy Clinton Toney, Coleman Blair Pridmore, and Rayford Milano Caudle

On April 15, 1984, all nine defendants were acquitted. The government had a burden to prove the defendants were motivated by racial hatred in order to bring them to federal charges. The CWP believed that the indictment was drawn too narrowly, giving the defense an opportunity to argue that political opposition to Communism and patriotic fervor, rather than racial motivations, prompted the confrontation. Neither trial &quot;investigated the actions of Federal agents or the Greensboro police.&quot;

===&quot;Waller v. Butkovich&quot;===
In 1980, survivors filed a civil suit in Federal District Court seeking $48 million in damages. The Christic Institute led the legal effort. The complaint alleged that law-enforcement officials knew &quot;that Klansmen and Nazis would use violence to disrupt the demonstration by Communist labor organizers and black residents of Greensboro but deliberately failed to protect them.&quot; Four federal agents were named as defendants in the suit, in addition to 36 Greensboro police and municipal officials, and 20 Klansmen and members of the American Nazi Party. Among the federal defendants was Bernard Butkovich of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, who had worked as an undercover agent in 1979 and infiltrated one of the American Nazi Party chapters about three months before the protest. He testified that a Klansman had referred in a planning meeting to using pipe bombs for possible assaults at the rally, and that he took no further action.

The Christic legal team was led by attorneys Lewis Pitts and Daniel Sheehan, together with People&#x27;s Law Office attorney G. Flint Taylor and attorney Carolyn McAllaster of Durham, North Carolina. A Federal jury in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, found two Klansmen, three neo-Nazis, two Greensboro police officers, and a police informant liable for the wrongful death of Dr. Michael Nathan, a non-CWP demonstrator, and for injuries to survivors Paul Bermanzohn and Tom Clark, who had been wounded. It awarded two survivors with a $350,000 judgment against the city, the Ku Klux Klan, and the American Nazi Party for violating the civil rights of the demonstrators. The widow Dr. Martha &quot;Marty&quot; Nathan, was paid by the City in order to cover damages caused by the KKK and ANP as well. She chose to donate some money to grassroots efforts for social justice and education.

==25th anniversary events==
The CWP gradually dissolved, and its members went on to other pursuits. In November 2004, nearly 700 people, including several survivors, marched in Greensboro along the original planned route from the housing project to Greensboro City Hall to mark the 25th anniversary of the event.

That year, a group of private citizens founded the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They appealed to the Mayor and the City Council for their endorsement, but failed to gain support. The Greensboro City Council, led by mayor Keith Holliday, voted 6 to 3 against endorsing the work of the group. The three African-American members of the Council voted in favor of the measure. The mayor at the time of the massacre, Jim Melvin, also rejected the private commission.

The private group announced that the Commission would take public testimony and conduct an investigation, in order to examine the causes and consequences of the massacre. It was patterned after official Truth and Reconciliation Commissions, generally organized by national governments, such as that notably conducted in post-apartheid South Africa. But, the Greensboro commission had no official recognition and authority. It lacked both the power of subpoena to compel testimony, and the ability to invoke the charge of perjury for false testimony.

The Commission reported its findings and conclusions. It noted that both the Communist Workers Party and the Klan contributed in varying degrees to the violence, especially given the violent rhetoric which they had been espousing for months leading up to the confrontation at the march. It said that the CWP did not intend to use handguns for anything other than self-defense. It said that the protesters, most of whom did not live in Greensboro or the county, had not fully secured the community support of the Morningside Homes residents for holding the event there. Many of the residents did not approve of the protest because they feared it had the risk of catalyzing violence on their doorsteps. The Commission concluded that the KKK and ANP members went to the rally intending to provoke a violent confrontation, and that they fired on demonstrators with intent of injury.

In its Final Report, the Commission noted the importance of the Greensboro Police Department&#x27;s absence from the scene. The presence of police at previous confrontations between the same groups had resulted in no violence. There had been testimony at the Commission that the Greensboro Police Department had infiltrated the Klan and, through a paid informant, knew of the white supremacists&#x27; plans and the strong potential for violence that day. The informant had formerly been on the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s payroll and maintained contact with his agent&#x27;s supervisor. Consequently, the FBI was also aware of the impending armed confrontation. The Commission reported that at least one activist in the crowd fired back after the attack started.

==City&#x27;s recognition==
*On June 17, 2009 the City Council issued a &quot;statement of regret&quot; about the 1979 incident.
*On May 24, 2015, the City of Greensboro officially unveiled a historical marker acknowledging the 1979 events, at a ceremony attended by more than 300 people. It reads: &quot;Greensboro Massacre – Ku Klux Klansmen and American Nazi Party members, on Nov. 3, 1979, shot and killed five Communist Workers Party members one-tenth mile north.&quot; The city council had voted to approve the proposed state highway marker. Two city council members voted against the historical marker, explaining that they did not consider the event a &quot;massacre&quot;.
*On October 6, 2020, the city council approved a resolution apologizing for the incident.

==In popular culture==
* Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark recorded &quot;88 Seconds in Greensboro&quot; about the massacre.
* Pop Will Eat Itself recorded &quot;88 Seconds... &amp; Still Counting&quot; on the album &quot;Cure for Sanity&quot; also about the incident.
* &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; aired a sketch the following year titled &quot;Commie Hunting Season&quot; that made specific reference to the incident.

<text>KBIG (104.3 FM, &quot;104.3 MYfm&quot;) is a commercial radio station licensed to Los Angeles, California, and serving the Greater Los Angeles area. The station is owned by iHeartMedia and broadcasts a hot adult contemporary radio format focusing on music from the 1990s to the present. Weekdays begin with the nationally syndicated &quot;Valentine in the Morning&quot; wake-up show, based at KBIG and hosted by Sean Valentine. Evenings feature &quot;On with Mario&quot; hosted by Mario Lopez.

KBIG&#x27;s studios are on West Olive Avenue in Burbank. The station&#x27;s primary transmitter is atop Mount Wilson. KBIG broadcasts using HD Radio technology. Its HD2 subchannel carries Pride Radio, aimed at an LGBTQ audience.

==History==
===Beautiful music===
The original KBIG 740 AM was founded by John H. Poole in 1952, originating from Catalina Island off the coast of California. Known as &quot;The Catalina Island Station&quot;, Poole knew KBIG would have wide coverage of Southern California by broadcasting the station&#x27;s directional signal across ocean water. KBIG was heard from Santa Barbara to San Diego, including the large audience in Los Angeles. The station became popular as it presented an island theme and scheduled music, news, and commercials on a different sequence from his competitors. &quot;We knew if you changed stations during a commercial, you would always find music on K-BIG,&quot; Poole claimed. The KBIG call letters were selected in honor of the station&#x27;s original disc jockey, Carl &quot;Mr. Big&quot; Bailey. The AM station was sold to religious broadcasters in 1980 and now operates as KBRT.

KBIG decided to add an FM station. KBIQ signed on the air on . At first KBIG and KBIQ would simulcast their programming. At the time of its launch, the stations aired a beautiful music format, playing lush instrumental versions of Hollywood, Broadway, and pop songs with an occasional vocal. KBIG-FM also had its staff of &quot;KBIG Singers&quot;, who would perform the station&#x27;s jingles and record station albums to offer to listeners.

In 1968, KBIG-AM-FM was bought by Bonneville International for $2 million. Bonneville, owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, specialized in beautiful music stations.

===Switch to Adult Contemporary===
Over time, the beautiful music format began to age. In 1987, the station dropped instrumentals and became a soft adult contemporary station, placing it in direct competition with KOST (103.5 FM), which had made a similar transition a few years earlier. Both stations enjoyed high ratings and were heard in many Los Angeles offices and workplaces.

By 1990, KBIG-FM dropped the 1960s songs and began playing more current hits. In 1992, KBIG-FM shifted to hot adult contemporary (hot AC). This lasted until 1995, when the station moved back to mainstream AC to again compete with KOST. In the 1990s, KBIG-FM aired &quot;Disco Saturday Night&quot;, a weekly show featuring disco music. In late 1996, KBIG-FM once again moved to a hot AC format.

===Controversy===
On February 8, 1994, KBIG-FM was sued by singer Barry Manilow, who sought $13 million in damages and $15 million in punitive damages. Maniolow claimed that one of KBIG&#x27;s advertisements was causing irreparable damage to his professional reputation. The ad, a 30-second spot which began airing on January 31, suggested that people listen to KBIG because it does not play Manilow&#x27;s music. The lawsuit was filed in Orange County Superior Court by Los Angeles attorney C. Tucker Cheadle. Two days later, KBIG agreed to drop the commercial poking fun at the singer, but a lawyer representing his business interests stopped short of agreeing to withdraw the $28 million lawsuit.

In 1997, KBIG-FM owner Bonneville International conducted a nationwide six-station swap with Chancellor Communications valued at $740 million; in exchange for KBIG-FM, Bonneville obtained Los Angeles country music-formatted KZLA (93.9 FM). In 1998, Chancellor relaunched its new station as &quot;The New K-BIG 104.&quot; It replaced most of its airstaff, and switched back to a mainstream AC format. During this time, KBIG-FM briefly became the Los Angeles area affiliate to the nationally syndicated love-song and dedication show &quot;Delilah&quot;.

===Upbeat evolution===
In 1999, Chancellor acquired KOST and KFI from Cox Radio. The same year, Chancellor and Capstar merged, forming AMFM, Inc. With AMFM now owning KOST, management moved KBIG to a hot AC format with a lean on 1980s hits, uptempo AC currents, and rhythmic pop. In 2000, AMFM was purchased by Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia).

David &quot;Chachi&quot; Denes, age 28, became KBIG-FM&#x27;s program director in 2003. On July 18, 2005, KBIG-FM made sweeping changes to its presentation by reducing commercial time and airing 30-minute music blocks. The station dropped jingles and the long-time top of the hour station identification (&quot;i.e.&quot;, &quot;... It&#x27;s four o&#x27;clock in the West ...&quot; would no longer be heard), and tweaked the playlist. It dropped current hits in favor of recurrents from the 1980s and 1990s, with most of the music leaning towards a rhythmic approach.

DJs also began to read out the individual letters of the station&#x27;s ID, &quot;K-B-I-G&quot;, instead of &quot;K-Big&quot; (although briefly in mid-2007, the &quot;K-Big 104&quot; slogan would sometimes be used). In addition to the station&#x27;s &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; program weeknights, in July 2006, KBIG added the dance mix show &quot;Thump Radio&quot; on weekend late nights. Despite speculation that the station would shift to a dance format, management insisted that there were no changes in the works at the time.

On August 17, 2006, KBIG-FM picked up new competition when Emmis Communications changed longtime country station KZLA to rhythmic adult contemporary as &quot;Movin&#x27; 93.9 KMVN&quot;. The move gave Los Angeles two stations with a rhythmic-sounding direction aimed at adults, even though KBIG-FM technically aired a hot AC format. In 2007, Emmis launched a $5 million marketing campaign which had little effect on KBIG-FM; that company&#x27;s chief financial officer Pat Walsh said it was the &quot;single largest marketing program in Emmis history&quot;. Emmis CEO Jeff Smulyan seemed unsure of KMVN, saying rhythmic AC Movin&#x27; &quot;may or may not be right&quot;. But after a shaky start in its first two Arbitron ratings books, KMVN did move up in the Spring 2007 period, while KBIG-FM saw a dip.

===Casey Kasem and Delilah===
Despite having been a rhythmic-based radio station, KBIG-FM was a loyal affiliate of Casey Kasem&#x27;s weekly countdown show for hot AC stations, &quot;American Top 20&quot;, which aired Sunday mornings. Former KBIG morning drive personality Charlie Tuna was Kasem&#x27;s regular substitute host. KBIG had been the flagship station for Casey&#x27;s adult contemporary countdown since it launched in 1992 until the station flipped back to hot AC in 2007.

In February 2007, KBIG-FM added &quot;Delilah&quot; back to its lineup. The news of having the program air on the station generated much talk because her show is geared toward a mainstream AC audience and seemed out of place on the rhythmic-oriented station. However, after adding Delilah, KBIG-FM began adding more mainstream AC content to its playlist.

===&quot;104.3 MYfm&quot;===
During the first week of September 2007, there was talk about KBIG-FM flipping formats as several domain names had been registered that hinted at such a change. On September 17, Charlie Tuna confirmed a change was coming when he announced on his website that he was leaving as morning host after seven years on KBIG. Tuna said he&#x27;d continue to work within Clear Channel&#x27;s Los Angeles cluster. On September 17, 2007, at 10 am, immediately after Tuna&#x27;s show ended, the station dropped rhythmic adult contemporary and began identifying itself as &quot;104.3 MYfm&quot;, adopting the adult top 40 format that was airing on sister station KYSR (98.7 FM). (KYSR would switch to alternative rock a few days later on September 20.)

The first two songs on &quot;MYfm&quot; were &quot;Hey There Delilah&quot; by the Plain White T&#x27;s and &quot;Livin&#x27; On A Prayer&quot; by Bon Jovi. (KBIG-FM&#x27;s former Rhythmic AC format moved to the station&#x27;s HD2 subchannel and sister station KHHT (now urban contemporary-formatted KRRL); the HD2 is now airing an LGBTQ-centric dance music format branded as &quot;Pride Radio&quot;.)

Denes described KBIG-FM&#x27;s new approach as &quot;Contemporary Adult Hits&quot;. In an interview with &quot;R&amp;R&quot; magazine, Clear Channel Los Angeles vice president of programming Michael Martin said, &quot;With today&#x27;s consumer wanting to custom tailor everything to their liking, the name MY is a perfect brand for radio. This is a station designed by the listeners to play music they tell us they want to hear. How do we know what &quot;they&quot; want to hear? Extensive, market research and continual-weekly music information to keep the station familiar, fun and family friendly.&quot; Martin continued, &quot;MY is designed to sit right in the middle of STAR 98.7 KYSR (which has evolved to Alternative) and Mainstream AC rival KOST 103.5, playing a great mix of music styles and eras. The MY playlist is deep, filled with contemporary music from all genres. It&#x27;s a mix that is not currently heard in L.A. radio.&quot; Denes added, &quot;104.3 MYfm will play adult hits like Kelly Clarkson, Beyonce, Christina Aguilera, Fergie, Justin Timberlake, John Mayer, Shakira, Madonna, Santana and much more. Every song we play is or was at the top of the charts.&quot;

With the move, &quot;Delilah&quot; was once again dropped, leaving Los Angeles without a Delilah affiliate. She returned to the market in 2012, when her show was picked up by KFSH-FM. Delilah is currently heard on KBIG&#x27;s sister station, 103.5 KOST.

===Valentine in the Morning===
In 2007, Sean Valentine became the new morning host. He had been at sister station KIIS-FM. A week after the launch of &quot;MYfm&quot; on September 24, &quot;Valentine in the Morning&quot; began.

His co-hosts are Jill Escoto and Jon Comouche. The show is also heard on iHeartMedia stations in Fort Myers, Bakersfield, Fresno and other cities. He also worked the afternoon drive shift temporarily in 2009.

KBIG-FM re-introduced &quot;American Top 20&quot; with Casey Kasem on February 24, 2008. The show aired in the same Sunday morning time slot as prior to the &quot;MY&quot; flip, until Casey retired from the program on July 5, 2009. &quot;Disco Saturday Night&quot; was carried by KBIG-FM for nearly a year after the format change, but after Labor Day in 2008, the show was replaced by &quot;8 Hours Of 80s&quot;, which ran until the Spring of 2009.

In April 2009, Sean Hamilton, long-time afternoon host at WKTU-FM in New York City, joined KBIG-FM as host of its afternoon show. Hamilton remained in New York and voicetracked his show for My FM. Later, Dave Styles took over Hamilton&#x27;s slot.

&quot;Dawson McAllister Live&quot; was added on Sunday evenings in July 2009. KBIG-FM is one of the few hot AC stations to carry the show as it is usually found on Top 40/CHR stations and geared toward a teenage and young adult audience.

On March 18, 2013, the station dropped the -FM suffix from its call sign, becoming simply &quot;KBIG.&quot;

==HD Radio==
On January 23, 2006, KBIG launched HD Radio subchannel KBIG-HD2, branded as &quot;Studio 104&quot;, and focused on disco hits. The station was programmed by Blake Florence.

On June 4, 2008, at noon, KBIG-HD2 dropped the all-disco format to introduce an LGBTQ-oriented HD radio station called Pride Radio from iHeartMedia. It plays dance and rhythmic hits.

<doc id="1059062" wikidata="Q1144797" url="?curid=1059062" title="Guanahani">
<text>Guanahaní (meaning &quot;small upper waters land&quot;) was the Taíno name of an island in the Bahamas that was the first land in the New World sighted and visited by Christopher Columbus&#x27; first voyage, on 12 October 1492. It is a bean-shaped island that Columbus called San Salvador. Guanahaní has traditionally been identified with Watlings Island, which was officially renamed San Salvador Island in 1925 as a result, but modern scholars are divided on the accuracy of this identification and several alternative candidates in and around the southern Bahamas have been proposed as well.

==Primary sources==
===Letter from Columbus himself===
Upon his return to Spain in the spring of 1493, Columbus wrote a letter to Luis de Santangel, one of his patrons at the Royal Court of Castile. The letter was printed widely and translated into many languages, spreading the news of the discovery throughout Europe. In the letter, Columbus mentions &quot;Guanahani&quot; as the name of the first island he discovered, but provides no other details. Nevertheless, this single mention in a widely printed letter would have been enough to make the name &quot;Guanahani&quot; widely known at an early date.

===Map of Juan de la Cosa===
Juan de la Cosa was the owner and master of the &quot;Santa María&quot; and as such sailed with Columbus on the first voyage. He was also a cartographer, and in 1500 de la Cosa drew a map of the world which is widely known as the earliest European map showing the New World. The Caribbean portion of the map shows Cuba and Hispaniola clearly, and a much more confused rendering of the Bahamas. Nevertheless, Guanahani is drawn in the Bahamas in a form that appears to show a group of islets rather than a single island, lying due north of the Windward Passage between Cuba and Haiti, in the central part of the Bahamas islands chain.

===&quot;Diario&quot;===

Columbus&#x27; so-called log, more properly referred to as the &quot;Diario&quot;, is an abstract made by Bartolomé de las Casas, a Spanish monk and friend of the Columbus family, probably sometime in the 1540s.

When Columbus returned to Spain after his first voyage, he reported to the royal court at Barcelona and presented his original log to the Spanish sovereigns. Queen Isabella ordered that the log be copied. The original soon disappeared, but the so-called &#x27;Barcelona copy&#x27; was returned to Columbus prior to his second voyage and was in his possession at the time of his death in 1506. It then passed to his son Fernando and remained in his vast library for many years. At some point, Las Casas obtained the Barcelona copy and made the abstract now called the &quot;Diario&quot;. Although most of the &quot;Diario&quot; is written in the third-person of Las Casas, nearly all of that portion dealing with Columbus&#x27; movements in the Bahamas is in the first person of Columbus himself, and is (according to Las Casas) a direct quote from the Barcelona copy.

The Barcelona copy disappeared late in the 16th century, but Las Casas&#x27; &quot;Diario&quot; was discovered intact in 1795 by Ferdinand de Navarette and published 30 years later. The &quot;Diario&quot; remains the most authoritative and detailed account of Columbus&#x27; movements and activities on the first voyage.

===Biography by Sebastian LaFrance and Fernando Colón===
In 1571, a biography of Christopher Columbus, written in Italian, was published in Venice. The book was a translation of a Spanish manuscript written by Columbus&#x27; second son, Fernando Colón, between 1537 and 1539. The Spanish manuscript eventually was translated into Italian and published by Alfonso Ulloa, a Spaniard making his living in Venice as a professional translator.

It is clear from the context that Fernando must have been working from the Barcelona copy when he wrote the portion of the biography describing the first voyage, as many details in the biography agree precisely with the &quot;Diario&quot;. In that sense, the primary utility of the biography is as a validity check on the &quot;Diario&quot;, a test which vindicates Las Casas in many respects. However, there are a few descriptions in the biography that are not already in the &quot;Diario&quot;. Most importantly, the biography asserts that Guanahani was fifteen leagues (45 miles) long, which seems contrary to Columbus&#x27; implication in the &quot;Diario&quot; that he had seen the entire island on a single day&#x27;s boat trip.

==Description of San Salvador/Guanahani==
Columbus calls the island &quot;very flat and with very green trees&quot;, which is true for all of the islands proposed by historians. His next statement is more problematic. He says Guanahani has &quot;muchas aguas y una laguna en medio muy grande&quot; – many waters and a very large &quot;laguna&quot; in the middle (or &quot;in between&quot;). The word &quot;laguna&quot; creates many problems. It is uncertain whether it means lagoon or pond. In any case, most of the proposed islands have either a lagoon or a pond; only East Caicos lacks one.

On 14 October, Columbus made a boat trip to &quot;the other part, which was the eastern part&quot; of Guanahani. Therefore, he went the length of the island in a north-northeast direction. This is possible only at Plana Cays, Conception and Egg, and to a very minor extent at Samana Cay. Columbus noticed a reef that completely surrounded the island. All proposed islands have a reef, but the ones on Cat and Watling&#x27;s do not completely surround the island. Between the reef and the island was a harbor &quot;large enough to store all ships of Christendom.&quot; This could easily have been an exaggeration. The harbor on Egg is definitely too small, although it is fairly appropriate for the impressive harbor at the neighboring islet of Royal Island, which could have been considered part of the same larger island he named &quot;San Salvador&quot; (the other &quot;part, which is the eastern part&quot;). Columbus went on land and saw &quot;a piece of land, that looked like an island, but actually wasn&#x27;t one.&quot; This is difficult to track, because it may have become a real island in the past 500 years.

===Number of islands===
One question in dispute is whether Guanahani was one island or more than one. Evidence is said to be inconclusive. Columbus never says specifically that Guanahani consisted of more than one island, something which is surely worth noting. But he does say that Guanahani had &quot;another part, which is the eastern part&quot;; and to explore that eastern part, he used a boat rather than walking, which may be significant. On reproductions of the map by Juan de la Cosa, who was with Columbus, Guanahani looks to some researchers like a string of small islands.

==Transatlantic track==
The first way to locate Guanahani is to follow the distances and directions Columbus gave in his log. This procedure is difficult because of the uncertainties in knowing the length of Columbus&#x27; league, the speed and direction of ocean currents, and the exact direction his magnetic compass would have pointed in 1492.

John McElroy was one of the first to attempt this in 1941, using a speculative magnetic chart for the year 1500 and currents from pilot charts. His vast overrun in distance was corrected by a fudge factor, leaving his endpoint in the vicinity of Watling&#x27;s Island. This result was substantially confirmed by Doug Peck&#x27;s sailing voyage of 1991.

In 1986, Luis Marden of the National Geographic Society applied currents to the first half of the voyage (but not the second half) and determined Samana Cay as the most probable landfall. In 1992, Goldsmith and Richardson used vector average currents (rather than prevailing currents) along with an updated magnetic field, and found a track that ended in the vicinity of Grand Turk Island. In 2004, Keith Pickering applied magnetic declinations from a more modern source and found a track that ended in the vicinity of the Plana Cays.

===Light seen on the evening preceding the discovery===
At 10 p.m. on 11 October Columbus saw a light &quot;like a small wax candle that rose and lifted up&quot;. He pointed it out to other people on board, some of whom were able to see the light, while others did not. The actual landfall was about 35 miles from the location Columbus saw the light, so if taken that the light was from a ground-based source, then it could not have been from Guanahani, but must have been from another island farther east. For the Plana Cays theory, the light would have been on Mayaguana. For Conception, it could have been on Cat Island, Watlings Island, or Rum Cay. For Caicos, it could have been on Grand Turk. For Cat Island, it could have been on Watlings Island, and for Lignum Vitae Cay it could have been Eleuthera Island. The Watling&#x27;s, Grand Turk, and Egg Island theories have no ready explanation.

==Inter-island track==

Besides the transatlantic track, the other important method for determining the location of Guanahani is the inter-island track, which can be traced either forward (from Guanahani to Cuba) or backward (from Cuba to Guanahani). Given the numerous descriptions of courses, distances, and directions in the log, this method seems more likely to pinpoint the location, and has been by far the method most frequently used by historians.

It was common practice among 20th-century historians to refer to the various Bahamian islands visited by Columbus by Roman numerals to avoid confusion: Island I being Guanahani, Island II being the second island visited by Columbus (which he named &quot;Santa María de la Concepción&quot;); followed by Island III (named &quot;Fernandina&quot; by Columbus) and Island IV (called Samoete by the indigenous inhabitants and renamed &quot;Isabela&quot; by Columbus).

Following these four islands, Columbus next visited a string of seven or more islands in a line running north–south (which historians generally agree must be the modern Ragged Island, Bahamas) before landing on the north coast of Cuba. A successful inter-island track must therefore navigate from Guanahani to the Ragged Islands in a way that fits the descriptions of the log without serious infidelity. Strictly speaking this is impossible, as there are a few places where the log seems to contradict itself.

===Island II===
Leaving Guanahani late on 14 October, Columbus said &quot;I saw so many islands I did not know how to decide which one I would go to first&quot;. Aiming for the largest, he estimated its distance by eye at five leagues, while other islands were both nearer and farther than that.

He arrived at Island II around noon, delayed by a contrary &quot;marea&quot; (usually translated as &quot;tide&quot;, although &quot;breeze&quot; is possible), re-estimating the distance as seven leagues rather than five. Island II had a coastline facing Guanahani that ran north–south for five leagues, and another coastline (&quot;which I followed&quot;, says Columbus) that ran east–west for more than ten leagues.

At this point comes a contentious passage in the log: &quot;And since from this island I saw another larger one to the west, I spread sail to go forward all that day until night, because [otherwise] I would not have been able to reach the western cape of the island&quot;. From this it is unclear whether the &quot;western cape&quot; at which Columbus anchored that night was on the island with the five- and ten-league coastlines, or the larger island to the west; in other words, it is unclear whether Columbus was adjacent to one or two islands on 15 October. Those who prefer the two-island interpretation call these Island IIa and Island IIb.

===Island III===
The log gives two descriptions of the sail from Island II to Island III on 16 October: in the first version, Columbus leaves at 10 AM and sails nine leagues east–west to reach Island III; in the second version, Columbus leaves at noon and sails eight leagues &quot;almost east-west&quot; to reach Island III.

Columbus also gives somewhat contradictory information on the size of Island III, saying at first (before actually exploring the island) that it &quot;may well be&quot; more than 28 leagues long; but later saying only that &quot;I saw quite 20 leagues of it but it did not end there.&quot;

But Columbus does give quite detailed information on the coastline of Island III, more so than any other island he visited. On the evening of 16 October, he arrived at a cape where the coastlines ran NNW and SSW (though some scholars see a possible transcription error here). The following morning (17 October) he followed the coast NNW, and when he was two leagues distant from the end (or &quot;the cape&quot;) of the island, he found a &quot;wonderful harbor&quot; with a small island in its mouth forming two narrow entrances. Going into the harbor with boats, he found it too shallow for use and put the boats ashore for water instead. Leaving the harbor after two hours, he then sailed northwest (rather than the previous NNW) &quot;so far that I viewed all that part of the island as far as the coast that runs east-west&quot;.

Thus there are four coastlines described at Island III: from the arrival cape, one coast runs SSW, one runs NNW; following the second coast NNW, Columbus arrived at a harbor; continuing along that coast, the coastline runs NW, and then W. These four coastlines and harbor are an essentially perfect fit with the southern part of Long Island.

Columbus ran into foul weather on the night of 17–18 October and gained sea room to avoid running onto a lee shore. He returned to Island III on the 18th, but the log does not specify where on the island he anchored that night. The following morning, 19 October, he split his fleet to search for the island of Samoete that his kidnapped native guides had told him about.

===Island IV===
Leaving his Island III anchorage at dawn, Columbus sent &quot;Niña&quot; SSE and &quot;Santa María&quot; SE, while &quot;Pinta&quot; was sent &quot;east and southeast&quot; (contrary to the ESE mentioned in some sources). Thus the ships were able to sweep a large area of ocean in search of the island whose position was only vaguely known. The &quot;Santa María&quot; herself raised the island before 9 AM, and signalling the other ships to rejoin, Columbus reached Island IV before noon, arriving at the northern point. Columbus describes this point as being surrounded by a reef, with a small island nearby.

Columbus&#x27;s descriptions of Island IV are, at best, confusing. He describes Island IV being &quot;on an east-west course&quot; from Island III (which contradicts his previous description of the fleet&#x27;s movements in the search), and he also asserts that from the northern point the coast ran west for 12 leagues, to its western cape, Cabo Hermoso. The direction of this coastline running west contradicts both Columbus&#x27;s own arrival at the island (since he arrived at the north point by sailing east, and did not arrive at Cabo Hermoso first) and his later description of his departure from this northern end of Island IV (as he departed sailing SSW and yet did not run aground).

From Cabo Hermoso, Columbus described a &quot;great bight&quot; to the northeast. Further confusing the issue, Columbus then says that he believes Cabo Hermoso is on a separate island from Samoete. The following morning (20 October), he tried to enter the bight in order to circumnavigate the island. That attempt soon proved futile because it was too shallow, and Columbus reversed course and returned to the northern end, awaiting the arrival of the King which his kidnapped native guides had told him about.

After two days of fruitless waiting for the King and another day becalmed, Columbus departed from the northern end of Island IV at midnight on 24 October, setting his sights on Cuba, the large island to the south he had been told about. He sailed WSW until dawn on the 24th, then was becalmed again until noon, making scant progress in the afternoon. At some point, he fixed his position at seven leagues southeast of Cape Verde, which he describes as being &quot;in the western part of the southern part&quot; of Island III. From that point, he made two leagues on a doubtful course under a rising wind; then, the morning of 25 October, he made five leagues WSW and another 11 leagues west when they sighted the Ragged Islands, which he called the &quot;Islas de Arena&quot; (&quot;Sand Islands&quot;) running north–south at a distance of five leagues.

==Candidates==

* Modern San Salvador Island was known since the 17th century as Watlings Island but renamed in 1925 after historians identified it as Guanahani. This hypothesis was proposed by Juan Bautista Muñoz (1793). It was resurrected by A. B. Becher (1856) and forwarded strongly by Lt. Joseph B. Murdock (1884). Supporters of the theory include the influential historians Richard Henry Major (1871) and Samuel Eliot Morison (1942). It remains widely accepted as the most probable candidate. However, Keith Pickering argues that Watlings Island is among the least probable, and that it is only widely accepted because it was seen as superior to previous 19th century theories.
* Samana Cay, proposed in 1880 by Gustavus V. Fox, a U.S. Navy captain. Fox&#x27;s theory was little known until revived in a 1986 issue of &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot;.
* Plana Cays, proposed by Ramón Julio Didiez Burgos in 1974 and Pickering in 1994. Pickering argues that the Plana Cays &quot;has fewer and less serious problems than any of the others -- in some cases, a lot fewer.&quot;
* Grand Turk Island, proposed by Martín Fernández de Navarrete in 1825, but soon fell out of favor until it was resurrected by Robert Power in 1924.
* Cat Island was long believed to be Guanahani as identified on many nautical charts from the 18th century. In light of the competing new theories of Muñoz and Fernández de Navarrete, Washington Irving (1828), with the assistance of Alexander Slidell Mackenzie, set out the case for Cat Island, supported by Alexander von Humboldt (1837). The hypothesis lost traction after the publication of Bartolomé de las Casas&#x27; abstract of Columbus&#x27; on-board journal (1875–1876), which argued strongly against it.
* Mayaguana, proposed by Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen in 1864.
* Conception Island, proposed by R.T. Gould in 1943.
* East Caicos, proposed by Pieter Verhoog in 1947.
* Egg Island, proposed by Arne Molander in 1981.
* Lignum Vitae Cay, proposed by John H. Winslow in 1989.

<text>The RAF Army Co-operation Command was a short-lived command of the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, comprising the army cooperation units of the RAF.

The command was formed on 1 December 1940 when No. 22 (Army Co-Operation) Group, previously a part of Fighter Command, was raised to command status. Initially it controlled two groups: No. 70 Group RAF for training and No. 71 Group RAF for operations. In August 1941, 71 Group re-organized its squadrons into a Wing basis. Each wing was directly attached to a UK based Army regional Command.

Its function was to act as the focus for activities connected with the interaction of the British Army and the RAF, such as close air support, tactical reconnaissance, artillery spotting and training of anti-aircraft defences. It was also responsible for developing tactics for the invasion of Europe, where direct air support proved to be decisive.

Army Co-Operation Command proved to be controversial, with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff General Sir Alan Brooke being an implacable foe of the command arrangement. It was disbanded on 31 March 1943, when most of its units were used to form the Second Tactical Air Force.

The command had only had one commander during its short existence, Air Marshal Sir Arthur Barratt.

<doc id="1059066" wikidata="Q335877" url="?curid=1059066" title="Frederick Dainton, Baron Dainton">
<text>Frederick Sydney Dainton, Baron Dainton, Kt, FRS, FRSE (11 November 1914 – 5 December 1997) was a British academic chemist and university administrator.

A graduate of Oxford and Cambridge, he was successively Professor of Physical Chemistry at the University of Leeds, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Nottingham, Dr Lee&#x27;s Professor of Chemistry at Oxford and Chancellor of the University of Sheffield.

==Early life and education==
Dainton was born in Sheffield on 11 November 1914, the son of George Whalley Dainton (born 1857), a Clerk of Works to a building contractor, and his second wife Mary Jane Bottrill, as the youngest of nine children.
He obtained a scholarship to the Central Secondary School in Sheffield, but it was in the public library that he became enthused of chemistry by reading the books of Sidgwick and Hinshelwood.

Dainton won an Exhibition at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford with a supplementary grant and loan from the City of Sheffield, which enabled him to study chemistry, gaining a first class degree in 1937. He then moved to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge where he received his PhD in 1940 working on photochemistry under Ronald Norrish, FRS.

==Academic career==
Being short-sighted Dainton was unfit for military service and stayed to teach at Cambridge during the Second World War. In 1945 he became a Fellow of St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

In polymer chemistry he explained the thermodynamics of the ceiling temperature of depolymerizable polymers in 1948.

In 1950 Dainton was appointed Professor of Physical Chemistry at the University of Leeds, specialising in radiation chemistry; work which resulted in his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society.

In 1965 Dainton left Leeds to become Vice-Chancellor of the University of Nottingham. During this period he chaired a Government enquiry into the decline in university entrants in science and technology, published in 1968 as &quot;The Swing away from Science&quot; and generally known as the &quot;Dainton Report&quot;.

In 1970 Dainton was appointed Dr Lee&#x27;s Professor of Chemistry and a Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, moving on in 1973 to become Chairman of the University Grants Committee where he remained until 1985. In 1970 he also became the second chairman of the Council for Scientific Policy.

From 1978 until his death Dainton was Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, the first Yorkshireman to hold the post.

==Honours==
Dainton was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1957 and in 1996 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE). In 1972, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1991.

Dainton was awarded the Davy Medal in 1969 and the Faraday Medal in 1974. He was awarded the inaugural President&#x27;s Medal of the Institute of Physics in 1998.

He was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Science (DSc) by the University of Bath in 1970.

Dainton was knighted in 1971 and received a life peerage as Baron Dainton, of Hallam Moors in South Yorkshire on 14 February 1986.

==Marriage and children==
Whilst at Cambridge Dainton met (and in 1942 married) a zoology research student, Barbara Hazlitt Wright (died 12 April 2009). They were married for 55 years and had a son and two daughters.one of the daughters-mary-had two daughters- Penelope and Harriet then had children, one of which (Ingrid) was very close with Mary.

==Death==
Lord Dainton died in Oxford on 5 December 1997 at the age of 83.

<doc id="1059074" wikidata="Q7560829" url="?curid=1059074" title="Sonata for Microtonal Piano (Ben Johnston)">
<text>Sonata for Microtonal Piano is a sonata for specifically microtonally tuned piano by Ben Johnston written in 1964 (see also just intonation). When the movements are played in an alternate order the piece is titled Grindlemusic.

The piece uses, &quot;chains of just tuned (untempered) triadic intervals over the whole piano range,&quot; with very few, only seven, piano keys having octave equivalents, thus providing eighty-one different pitches (there are eighty-eight white and black keys total). &quot;Effectively, for the listener, there are three main gradations of consonance/dissonance: (1) smooth untempered [ major and minor] thirds and fifths, which have the least amount of harshness caused by acoustical beats; (2) compounds of these...; and (3) chromatic or enharmonic intervals...which sound &#x27;out of tune.&#x27;&quot; [note the difference between &#x27;keyboard distance&#x27; in this tuning and pitch or interval distance: for example a fifteenth, two keys with fifteen notes between them, on a normally tuned keyboard is a double octave, while in this tuning a fifteenth is slightly sharper than that]

&quot;This suggested...the possibility of two opposite systems for the deployment of pitches: one that synchronized pitch choices with the layout of consonant and dissonant intervals on the keyboard [see: tonality], and a violently contrasting one in which the system for choosing pitches, a twelve-tone-row procedure derived largely from certain practices of Berg and late Schoenberg [see: twelve-tone technique], either ignores or flaunts the consonance/dissonance keyboard layout [see: atonality]. There are two contrasting movements of each of these types.&quot;

&quot;This makes possible a Janus[two]-faced work, in which, with only the third movement similarly located in both versions, permutations of the placement of the other three movements creates an alter-ego relationship between the two versions, called respectively &quot;Sonata for Microtonal Piano&quot; and &quot;Grindlemusic&quot;. In the &quot;Sonata&quot; version, the movements correspond to the classical sonata scheme: the &#x27;sonata-allegro,&#x27; the &#x27;scherzo,&#x27; the songlike &#x27;slow movement,&#x27; and the &#x27;finale,&#x27; which is in this case a meditative adagio. All movements, however are cast in the common ballad mold, AABA, as is each of the two entire versions, the &quot;Sonata&quot; and &quot;Grindlemusic&quot;.&quot;

In the words of the composer:

:&quot;The &quot;Sonata&quot;, whether presented as beauty or as the beast, is a monstrous parody-enigma, allusive, referential, sometimes derisive, distorted, a tissue of familiarity in radically strange garb...Whatever the closing mood brings to mind, it is overlaid with irony and derision. The Sonata sequence poses the challenge: fast, faster, slow, slower. When, in the &quot;Sonata&quot;&#x27;s finale, the knots are finally untied, will it be clear from what Houdini has escaped?&quot;

&quot;All tempos, all phrase and section lengths, and in certain parts of the &#x27;finale&#x27; (which opens &quot;Grindlemusic&quot;, the sequence closing with the &#x27;scherzo&#x27;), even note-to-note timings conform to a proportional scheme derived from a single pattern of changes in AABA form. This pattern is associated with two distinct motivic groups at different points in the work.&quot;

The piece has been recorded and released on:
*&quot;Microtonal Piano by Ben Johnston&quot; (1997). Phillip Bush, piano. Koch International Classics 3-7369-2.

&quot;Though the piece was recorded as the &quot;Sonata&quot;, and though Johnston and I both agree that a live performance of &quot;Grindlemusic&quot; would contain subtle alterations, the metric modulations between movements are nevertheless worked out to arrive at identical tempos in each version. Therefore I feel that a passable sense of &quot;Grindlemusic&quot; can be experienced by simply reprogramming the tracks on your compact disc player. To program the tracks for &quot;Grindlemusic&quot;, select the track order 9, 6, 8, 7.&quot; The &quot;Sonata&quot; being track order 6, 7, 8, 9. 8, being B, stays in the same place.

<text>The coat of arms of the Polish city of Piła features a red (or sometimes brown) deer on a green field, leaping to the dexter. It was first featured on a seal of the city council created probably in 1571. Initially, the deer was leaping towards the sinister side of the shield; this was changed in the 17th century. During the Partitions of Poland, the local German authorities sometimes also used a modification of the coat of arms featuring a crowned deer.

The modern version of the coat of arms was adopted by the city council of Piła in 1990. The colours used in the arms are also used on the flag of Piła.

== Politics ==
Yishun was a large, single-member constituency starting in Seletar but later hived into Sembawang and along with a dedicated namesake Nee Soon SMC on later years. When the GRC scheme was introduced in 1988, its population size was enough to form into Ang Mo Kio and Sembawang GRC, as well as two smaller SMCs. By 2011, Nee Soon had its dedicated GRC spanning most of Yishun.

The entire Yishun was helmed by the current ruling party, People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) on its lifetime except on years between 1963 and 1968 where it was helmed by Barisan Sosialis, a party formed from a fraction of former PAP members, and from 1991 to 1997 with ex-Singapore Democratic Party member (now National Solidarity Party) Cheo Chai Chen. Notable members of parliament that oversees the Yishun area also include current Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam (which oversees the subregion of Chong Pang), current Education Minister Ong Ye Kung and Derrick Goh (oversees the North Eastern Yishun now known as Nee Soon Link), and Carrie Tan (oversees the southern subregion of Khatib and Lower Seletar Reservoir).

Outside of politics, a member of parliament and the 8th President of Singapore, Halimah Yacob, was a resident of Yishun. Hui Shiu-hung, a veteran Hong Kong actor, was also a resident.

<doc id="1059086" wikidata="Q4921905" url="?curid=1059086" title="Black Star Line">
<text>The Black Star Line (1919−1922) was a shipping line incorporated by Marcus Garvey, the organizer of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), and other members of the UNIA. The shipping line was created to facilitate the transportation of goods and eventually African Americans throughout the African global economy. It derived its name from the White Star Line, a line whose success Garvey felt he could duplicate. The Black Star Line became a key part of Garvey&#x27;s contribution to the Back-to-Africa movement, but it was mostly unsuccessful, partly due to infiltration by FBI agents. It was only one among many businesses which the UNIA originated, such as the Universal Printing House, Negro Factories Corporation, and the widely distributed and highly successful &quot;Negro World&quot; weekly newspaper.

The Black Star Line and its successor, the Black Cross Navigation and Trading Company, operated between 1919 and the mid-1920s. It stands today as a major symbol for Garvey followers and Pan-Africanists. It is not to be confused with the later Black Star Line, the state shipping corporation of Ghana.

==History==

The Black Star Line was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on June 27, 1919. Having a maximum capitalization of $500,000, BSL shares were sold at UNIA conventions at five dollars each.

The first directors of the Black Star Line were Marcus Garvey, Edgar M. Grey, Richard E. Warner, George Tobias, Jeremiah Certain, Henrietta Vinton Davis, and Janie Jenkins. The officers of the corporation were President Marcus Garvey, First Vice President — Jeremiah Certain, Second Vice President Henrietta Vinton Davis, Treasurer George Tobias, Secretary Richard E. Warner, Assistant Secretary Edgar M. Grey and Assistant Treasurer Janie Jenkins. Six months after incorporation the board of directors voted to increase the Black Star Line market capitalization to $10 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

The Black Star Line surprised all its critics when, only three months after being incorporated, the first of four ships, &quot;&quot; was bought with the intention of renaming it &quot;Frederick Douglass&quot;. &quot;Yarmouth&quot; was a collier in the First World War, and was in poor condition when the Black Star Line bought her. Once reconditioned, &quot;Yarmouth&quot; sailed for three years between the US and the West Indies as the first Black Star Line ship with an all-black crew and a black captain. Later Joshua Cockburn, the captain of &quot;Yarmouth&quot;, was accused of receiving a &quot;kick back from the purchase price&quot;.
&quot;Yarmouth&quot; was not the only ship that BSL bought in poor condition and completely oversold. Garvey spent another $200,000 for more ships (equivalent to $ million in ). One, , sailed the &quot;cruise to nowhere&quot; on the Hudson River one summer and sank the next fall because of a leak. Another was the steam yacht , once owned by Henry Huttleston Rogers. Booker T. Washington had been an honored guest aboard the ship when it was owned by his friend and confidant, Rogers. However, Rogers had died in 1909, and the once well-maintained yacht had also served in the first World War. After having been renamed &quot;Antonio Maceo&quot; by the Black Star Line, it blew a boiler and killed a man.

Besides oversold and poorly conditioned ships, the Black Star Line was beset by mismanagement and infiltration by agents of J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s Bureau of Investigation (the forerunner to the Federal Bureau of Investigation), including the first African-American agent hired by the bureau, James Wormley Jones, who became an intimate of Garvey, and other agents who − according to historian Winston James − sabotaged it by throwing foreign matter into the fuel, damaging the engines. On its first commission, the &quot;Yarmouth&quot; brought a shipment of whiskey from the US to Cuba (before Prohibition) in record time, but because it did not have docking arrangements in Havana, it lost money sitting in the docks while the longshoremen had a strike. A cargo-load of coconuts rotted in the hull of a ship on another voyage because Garvey insisted on having the ships make ceremonial stops at politically important ports.
In 1919, J. Edgar Hoover and the BOI charged Marcus Garvey and three other officers with mail fraud. The prosecution stated that the brochure of the Black Star Line contained a picture of a ship that the BSL did not own. The ship pictured was &quot;Orion&quot;, which in the brochure was renamed &quot;Phyllis Wheatley&quot;. The BSL was trying to buy the ship at the time, but did not own her yet. The fact that the ship was not owned yet by the BSL constituted mail fraud. &quot;In 1922, Garvey and three other Black Star Line officials were indicted by the US government for using the mails fraudulently to solicit stock for the recently defunct steamship line.&quot; On the witness stand, Garvey admitted that $600,000 ($ in 2025) had been &quot;blown to the wind&quot;. The jury convicted only Garvey, but not the other three officers, and he was sentenced to five years in prison. In 1927, President Calvin Coolidge deported Garvey back to Jamaica.

The Black Star Line was suspended by Garvey in February 1922, following his arrest on mail fraud charges. The &quot;Shady Side&quot; was abandoned on mudflats at Fort Lee, New Jersey. The line was reconstituted as the Black Cross Navigation and Trading Company thereafter, which purchased a new ship, the SS &quot;General G W Goethals&quot;, in October 1924. It was then renamed the SS &quot;Booker T. Washington&quot;. The ship sailed to Cuba and Panama in 1925, but it is unclear whether it ever returned to New York, due to lack of funds.

==In popular culture==
*Reggae singer Fred Locks re-introduced the Black Star Line to a Jamaican audience with his 1976 hit &quot;Black Star Liner&quot; (which has been called one of &quot;the most important songs in reggae music of the 1970s&quot;), portraying Garvey as a Moses-like prophet: &quot;Seven miles of Black Star Liners coming in the harbor [...] I can hear the elders saying. These are the days for which we&#x27;ve been praying ... Marcus Garvey told us that the Black Star Liners are coming one day for us&quot;.
*The 1977 reggae album by Culture, &quot;Two Sevens Clash&quot;, featured a song called &quot;Black Starliner Must Come&quot;.
*A 1978 reggae song named &quot;Black Star Liner&quot; by The Regulars (later renamed to Reggae Regular) appears to still be a popular song on YouTube. Also Black Slate on their album &quot;Amigo&quot; recorded a song called &quot;Freedom Time (Black Star Liner)&quot;, with references to Marcus Garvey and &quot;seven miles of Black Star Liner&quot;.
*The Black Star Line was also commemorated by blues singers such as Hazel Meyers and Rosa Henderson; by the musical group Brand Nubian (on their 1993 album &quot;In God We Trust&quot;); and by Ranking Dread with &quot;Black Starlina&quot; on his &quot;Kunta Kinte Roots&quot; album. 
*&quot;Train to Zion&quot; by Linval Thompson (writer) and U Brown featured the lines: &quot;Train to Zion is coming / Don&#x27;t want no one to miss it / It&#x27;s the Black Star Liner / It&#x27;s going to Zion...&quot;
*Black Star Liner was the name of a British electronic group, who won a Mercury Music Prize nomination in 1999 for their album &quot;Bengali Batam Youth Foundation&quot;.

<text>Film look (also known as filmizing or film-look) is a process in which video is altered in overall appearance to appear to have been shot on film stock. The process is usually electronic, although filmizing can sometimes occur as an unintentional by-product of some optical techniques, such as telerecording.  The process has the opposite result to VidFIRE, used to restore a video look to telerecorded video.

==Differences between video and film==
* Frame rate: 24 frames per second for film, 25 or 30 frames per second for old SD video. Modern video cameras shoot 24 and up as well.
* Shutter angle: Shorter (90° to 210°) for film, often ~350° for old video. Modern video cameras have adjustable electronic, or – in &quot;Arri&#x27;s&quot; video cameras – mechanical shutters.
* Dynamic range: film and video systems have widely varying limits to the luminance dynamic ranges that they can capture. Modern video cameras are much closer to the dynamic range of film, and their use is better understood by directors.
* Field of view and depth of field: Depth of field is tangentially related to the size of the image plane, however, it is a popular misconception that the image plane is directly related to DOF. Smaller image planes (whether film or sensor) require a proportionally smaller lens to achieve a similar field of view. This means that a frame with a 12 degree horizontal field of view will require a 50 mm lens on 16 mm film, a 100 mm lens on 35 mm film, and a 250 mm lens on 65 mm film. And a 250 mm lens delivers much shallower DOF than a 50 mm lens does. It follows that standard lenses on most consumer video cameras with small sensors provide much larger depth of field than 35 mm film. Digital cinema cameras like the Red One or Panavision Genesis, as well as some digital SLR cameras with video capabilities, (such as the Canon EOS 5D Mark II), have sensors roughly equal in size to 35 mm film frames and thus show the same field of view characteristics.
* Photo-chemical color-timing/grading: only possible with film; white balance adjustment for video performs a similar function.
* Noise type: film grain noise generally differs both statistically and visually from digital sensor noise. However, artificial noise can be added to video, to simulate film grain.
* Jump &amp; Weave: Images projected from film do not always align properly from frame to frame when projected on screen due to minor variations in sprocket hole size.

===Frame rate===
Today, most digital cinematography video cameras in use feature 24p format (24 progressive frames per second).

When shooting with old cameras, 50 Hz interlaced video (usually used with most forms of PAL and SECAM) can be relatively easily processed to give 25 progressive frames per second, which is the framerate that the PAL/SECAM telecine process also uses. Every two video fields can be &quot;blended&quot; together, every other field can be decimated and the remaining fields can be shown for double the length (this noticeably reduces vertical resolution), or a motion estimation process can be applied to achieve one frame out of every two fields. This technique is sometimes called Field-removed video or FRV. Some modern PAL video cameras do offer the ability to produce 25 frame-per-second progressive video, negating the requirement of post-processing the video to get a temporal similarity to film.

On the other hand, it is much more complicated to convert 60 Hz interlaced video (used with NTSC and PAL-M) to a framerate resembling that of film. Doing the same as PAL/SECAM filmizing will yield 30 frame-per-second video, which is significantly faster than film. Two out of every five fields could be dropped (and 3:2 Pulldown can be applied to the remaining fields), but any motion after this process will look very uneven. Sophisticated computer motion estimation and field blending is usually used to convert NTSC video to 24 frames-per-second – something which could not have been done until recently, and still does not yield as realistic results as PAL filmizing conversion.

Many computer editing programs can de-interlace video to give it more of a film look. An interlaced frame is actually the combination of two fields, one providing the odd-numbered scan lines and the other the even-numbered. Interlacing results in a type of motion blur known as &quot;combing&quot;, and also shows &quot;interline twitter&quot; where vertical details approach the resolution limit, neither of which occur in film. De-interlacing can remove or reduce these artifacts, resulting in an appearance closer to that of film.

Some inexpensive consumer editing programs achieve de-interlacing by deleting one of the fields. The result gives half the vertical resolution of the original frame, and sometimes adds a jagged effect to the picture.

===Shutter angle===
For each frame, video cameras normally expose their sensor as long as they can, while film cameras only expose the negative up to half this time, so that they can transport the negative in the remaining time. Many video cameras now allow adjusting the shutter timing manually, though, so this is no longer a big concern.

===Dynamic range===
Old video technology only had a 5 stop exposure dynamic range. Modern HD video cameras have up to 14 stops. The exposure range is therefore less of an issue than before, although there is still a popular belief that video is considerably worse than film in the shoulder of the gamma curve, where whites blow out in video, while film tends to overexpose more evenly and gracefully.

===Grading===
The footage may also be graded to have more of a &quot;filmic look.&quot; In the US, this process is often referred to as color timing.

===Jump and weave===
In a standard film projector, each frame of film is positioned, or registered by being held motionless against a rectangular opening, known as the gate, for a fraction of a second. While in the gate, light passes through the image in the frame, to be projected onto the screen. As soon as the shutter cuts off the light, either sprockets or a device called a claw is used to move the film rapidly so that the next frame can be registered in the gate before the shutter opens again. However, the pins on the sprockets (or the claw) do not fit the sprocket holes in the film perfectly. There must be some slight clearance to allow the pins to enter and leave the sprocket holes without undue friction or binding. This discrepancy means that each frame cannot be positioned perfectly within the gate each time; the frame may be slightly too high or low (jump) or to the left or right (weave). This introduces unintended motion from frame to frame as the film is projected. This discrepancy can increase as the film becomes worn with use, causing the sprocket holes to become more and more enlarged, thus allowing more error in frame position.

When film is scanned so that an electronic (video) copy can be made, various means are used to help ensure that the variations in frame position as a result of sprocket hole wear are minimized. The more effective these means are, the less of a &#x27;film look&#x27; the result will have. On the contrary, if this compensation is reduced or disabled, the resulting electronic copy may exhibit more jump and weave, giving the result a sense of constant jitter.

==Filmized productions==
US productions most often use actual film for prime time dramas and situation comedy series and filmizing is more common outside North America. Video production is cheaper than film.

Television series, specials, Soap operas, Sitcoms and films that have been filmized include:

Many digitally-shot Television and film productions have been filmized during mastering.

==Limitations==
Footage that has been shot with the knowledge that it will be subsequently electronically filmized is usually shot in a very different way, with film-style lighting and framing. Regardless, there have been several attempts to process ordinary videotape to look like film, usually with little success. Notable examples include &quot;Red Dwarf Remastered&quot; – digitally remastered versions of the first three series of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. As well as being filmized, the episodes had been cropped to widescreen and had all their special effects remade.

BBC hospital drama-soap &quot;Casualty&quot; also flirted briefly with the filmizing process in the mid-1990s, but it was quickly dropped after viewer complaints that the show &quot;looked wrong.&quot; The same happened with &quot;Emmerdale&quot; where it was used for 7 episodes in October 2002 before being quietly dropped.

The fantasy series &quot;Neverwhere&quot; was a video-based production which suffered as a result of having been shot and lit with filmization in mind. The decision to filmize was later reversed, resulting in a negative response to the film-style lighting which came across poorly on the unprocessed video footage.

Filmizing success stories include &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;, &quot;Spaced&quot;, &quot;The Office&quot; and &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, all of which can fool most people into believing they were shot on film. On 25 November 2007 an episode of &quot;Heartbeat&quot; was broadcast without filmizing and the show&#x27;s producers later admitted this was a post-production error. This error caused alarm amongst the show&#x27;s fans amidst fears that a permanent switch to video was being made indicating the success of the filmizing technique on this production.

The Fox show &quot;Arrested Development&quot; used an elaborate post-production process to adjust colors and brightness levels to match those of film stock.

The 1970s BBC TV show &quot;Porridge&quot; provides a stark example of the visual differences between film and videotape. The show employed videotape for scenes inside Fletcher&#x27;s cell, whereas film was used for scenes outside the cell. The difference in lighting style and frame rate is very noticeable. Many British television series from the 1960s through the 1980s used videotape for interior scenes and film for exterior shots due to equipment limitations. This was parodied in the &#x27;Society for Putting Things on top of Other Things&#x27; sketch in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; (Series 2, Episode 5).

<text>Ian Harvey Hanomansing (born 1962/1963) is a Trinidadian-Canadian television journalist with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). He formerly hosted &quot;CBC News Network Vancouver&quot; on CBC News Network, and reports for CBC Television&#x27;s nightly newscast, &quot;The National&quot;.

On August 1, 2017, he was named a co-anchor of &quot;The National&quot;, and currently anchors the show on Fridays and Sundays. He also served as interim host of CBC Radio One&#x27;s weekly call-in show &quot;Cross Country Checkup&quot; from 2020 to 2022, while regular host Duncan McCue was on sabbatical, and was named permanent host of the program in 2022.

In 2025, the CBC announced that Hanomansing will become host of a new nightly news program, &quot;Hanomansing Tonight&quot;, on CBC News Network beginning February 18.

==Early life==
Hanomansing was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago to Indian parents and grew up in Sackville, New Brunswick with parents Eunice and Harvey, along with his sister Ria. He got his first job coming out of high school in 1979 at a radio station in Amherst, Nova Scotia. He attended Mount Allison University for his undergraduate education and graduated in 1983 with a degree in political science and sociology. He studied law at Dalhousie Law School and graduated in 1986.

==Broadcasting career==
His broadcast media career began at CKDH in Amherst, Nova Scotia in the summer after his graduation, followed by work at CKCW in Moncton, New Brunswick and at CHNS in nearby Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1986 he joined the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He worked for CBC bureaus in the Maritimes and Toronto, Ontario before moving to Vancouver, where he was a network reporter and hosted the now-defunct programs &quot;Pacific Rim Report&quot;, &quot;Foreign Assignment&quot;, and &quot;Times 7&quot; (a joint venture with &quot;The New York Times&quot;) and also hosted a summer series on CBC Radio One, &quot;Feeling the Heat&quot;.

From 2000 to 2007, he was the anchor of the national segment of the defunct newscast &quot;Canada Now&quot;; following that program&#x27;s cancellation, he was the co-anchor of &quot;CBC News: Vancouver&quot;, CBUT&#x27;s supper hour newscast, from 2007 to 2010. He returned to his former role as network reporter for &quot;The National&quot; in 2010 and from 2012 to 2017 he hosted &quot;CBC News Now with Ian Hanomansing&quot;, which was broadcast live from CBC Vancouver on weeknights. On August 1, 2017, he was named as one of four new co-hosts of &quot;The National&quot;, CBC&#x27;s flagship news broadcast alongside Adrienne Arsenault, Rosemary Barton and Andrew Chang. In 2020, he was named the Friday and Sunday anchor of the programme.

Hanomansing has developed and hosted a series of innovative live news specials including &quot;Downtown Drugs&quot;, in November 1998, from Vancouver&#x27;s Downtown Eastside during a public health emergency declared after a high number of fatal overdoses. In March 2005, &quot;Crime on the Streets&quot; was broadcast, in part, from Stoney Mountain Institution in Manitoba. It is believed to be the only live national news special from a Canadian federal penal institution. It won a national Justicia Award for Excellence in Legal Reporting, as well as a Jack Webster Award.

In 2006, Hanomansing also designed Big League Manager, an NHL-licensed board game. His game was voted a &quot;Best Bet&quot; by the Canadian Toy Testing Council.

== Awards and honours ==
Hanomansing received an honorary degree, Doctor of Laws honoris causa (LLD), from Mount Allison University in 2003. On November 28, 2008 Hanomansing won the Gemini Award for Best News Anchor, beating Kevin Newman and Peter Mansbridge. in 2010, Hanomansing was one of the recipients of the Top 25 Canadian Immigrant Awards presented by Canadian Immigrant Magazine. In March 2016, he won the Canadian Screen Award for Best National News Anchor over Peter Mansbridge, Lisa LaFlamme and Heather Hiscox.

<text>Vida Samadzai (born 22 February 1978) is an Afghan-American actress, model and beauty pageant titleholder who was Miss Afghanistan 2003. As the first Afghan woman to participate in an international beauty pageant since 1974, her appearance in a red bikini in the 2003 edition of Miss Earth pageant created controversy in her native country. She was a contestant on the popular reality show &quot;Bigg Boss&quot; in 2011.

==Biography==
Samadzai was born and raised in Kabul, Afghanistan, and moved to the United States in 1996. She graduated from California State University at Fullerton and became a citizen of the U.S. Samadzai also helped found a US-based women&#x27;s charity that seeks to raise awareness of women&#x27;s rights and education in the Afghanistan.

After placing as the third runner up in Susan Jeske&#x27;s first Ms. America International pageant in 2002, she applicated for consideration in the new Miss Earth pageant in 2003 and was selected as Afghanistan&#x27;s representative from abroad, as there were no beauty queen contests in Afghanistan. Although she did not hold the title of a &quot;Miss Afghanistan&quot;, this made her the first Afghan woman to take part in an international beauty contest since Zohra Daoud had been crowned Miss Afghanistan in 1974. Her participation in the Miss Earth beauty pageant was condemned by the Afghan Supreme Court, saying such a display of the female body goes against Islamic law and Afghan culture. In particular, traditionalists objected to her appearance in a red bikini during the pageant&#x27;s press presentation. She was given a special &quot;Beauty for a Cause&quot; award at that year&#x27;s Miss Earth competition.

The following year, Samadzai returned to the pageant and was among the 11 jurors who helped choose Priscilla Meirelles as Miss Earth 2004. On coronation night, the young women&#x27;s rights activist wore a gown, saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll have a problem this time because I&#x27;m not showing any skin or wearing a swimsuit&quot;. On May 1, 2005, Vida Samadzai won Susan Jeske&#x27;s little known Ms. America 2005-06 pageant.

<text>Arab diaspora is a term that refers to descendants of the Arab emigrants who, voluntarily or as forcibly, migrated from their native lands to non-Arab countries, primarily in the Americas, Europe, Southeast Asia, and West Africa. 

Immigrants from Arab countries, such as Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinian territories, also form significant diasporas in other Arab states.

==Overview==
Arab expatriates contribute to the circulation of financial and human capital in the region and thus significantly promote regional development. In 2009 Arab countries received a total of US$35.1 billion in remittance in-flows and remittances sent to Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon from other Arab countries are 40 to 190 per cent higher than trade revenues between these and other Arab countries. Large numbers of Arabs migrated to West Africa, particularly Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Nigeria. Since the end of the civil war in 2002, Lebanese traders have become re-established in Sierra Leone.

According to Saudi Aramco World, the largest concentration of Arabs outside the Arab World is in Brazil, which has 9 million Brazilians of Arab ancestry. Of these 9 million Arabs, 6 million are of Lebanese ancestry, making Brazil&#x27;s population of Lebanese equivalent to that of Lebanon itself. However, these figures are contradicted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), which is the agency responsible for official collection of statistical information in Brazil. According to the 2010 Brazilian census conducted by IBGE, there were only 12,336 Lebanese nationals living in Brazil and other Arab nationalities were so small that they were not even listed. The Brazilian census does not ask about ancestry or family origin. There is a question about nationality and, according to the Brazilian law, any person born in Brazil is a Brazilian national by birth and right for any purpose, nationally or internationally - not an Arab. The last Brazilian census to ask about family origin was conducted in 1940. At that time, 107,074 Brazilians said they had a Syrian, Lebanese, Palestinian, Iraqi or Arab father. Native Arabs were 46,105 and naturalized Brazilians were 5,447. In 1940, Brazil had 41,169,321 inhabitants, hence Arabs and their children were 0.38% of Brazil&#x27;s population in 1940.

Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela, Mexico and Chile. Palestinians cluster in Chile and Central America, particularly El Salvador, and Honduras. The Palestinian community in Chile is the fourth largest in the world after those in Israel, Lebanon, and Jordan. Arab Haitians (a large number of whom live in the capital) are more often than not, concentrated in financial areas where the majority of them establish businesses. In the United States, there are around 3.5 million people of Arab ancestry.

In the 2010 Indonesian census, 118,886 people, amounting to 0.05% of the population of Indonesia, identified themselves as being of Arab ethnicity.

There is also a small community of Yemeni Arabs in Hyderabad city of Telangana state in India who were brought from Hadhramaut region of Yemen to serve as army men during Nizam&#x27;s rule. They are called the Chaush community. There is also presence of a tiny Iraqi refugees/immigrant community in India.

<text>Montlake Playfield is a 27-acre (100,000 m²) park and playfield on Portage Bay in the Montlake neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, USA.

Originally a 20-foot-deep peat bog, the playfield site was first developed as part of a dahlia farm. The farm extended considerably further south than the present playfield: its southernmost part was south of Lynn Street, the land used to build St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church. In the late 1920s, the principal of Garfield High School declared the need of a playfield and community center, and the farm was chosen. After some controversy and condemnation proceedings, the playfield was dedicated in 1935.

In 1960, to remedy flooding, the playfield began to be raised with fill, including dirt from the excavation of State Route 520 through Montlake. The ground remains uneven and boggy to this day.

<text>William Boyce Thompson (May 13, 1869 – June 27, 1930) was an American mining engineer, financier, prominent in the Republican party, philanthropist, and founder of Newmont Mining. Thompson was one of the early twentieth century mine operators that discovered and exploited vast copper deposits that revolutionized Western American mining, and reaped tremendous fortunes. The William Boyce Thompson School in Yonkers, New York, is named after him.

==History==
Born in Virginia City, Montana Territory and raised in Butte, he was schooled in the rough mining towns of southwest Montana - but also at Phillips Exeter Academy and the Columbia School of Mines. During the 1890s he joined his father, William, one-time mayor of Butte, in Montana mining and lumber ventures, before moving east to become a mine promoter and stockbroker. His first success, the Shannon Copper Company – where he opened mines, built a smelter, and a railroad between them – is now part of Arizona&#x27;s vast Morenci open pit, the largest in the United States. Joining the brokerage firm of Hayden, Stone &amp; Co. during the early 1900s he expanded his promotions: to Ely, Nevada, where he helped organize the Nevada Consolidated, which eventually became a part of the multinational Kennecott Copper Company (Guggenheims), of which he was a director; Mason Valley where he opened old copper mines and built his smelter town which was named Thompson, Nevada after him (now a ghost town); and most fortuitously in the 1910s opened the Magma mine at Superior, Arizona, which became a major copper producer; and the promotion of the incredibly rich Inspiration Copper Company at Inspiration, Arizona, near Miami, Arizona, during the 1910s (absorbed by the &quot;Anaconda crowd&quot; in 1912, but with Thompson retaining a 15% share); all made him fabulously wealthy. He had built a considerable fortune developing low grade, large scale porphyry copper deposits at the same time he got lucky with his high-grade Magma mine, which proved a phenomenal bonanza. He retired from the New York stock exchange in 1915 and later created his own holding company, Newmont Mining Corporation, to which he transferred his many mining interests. By the time of his death, Newmont Mining was a major factor in world copper production. Today, Newmont is the largest gold producer in the United States but continues the legacy of Thompson to explore and bring into production new ore deposits.

Thompson&#x27;s promotions and financial holdings were scattered from Canada to Peru. They included Indian Motorcycle Co. He financed lead, zinc and coal mines, street railways, and handled the sensational Midvale Steel financing during the War when the stock rose from 290 to 500. He promoted the great Nipissing silver deposit at Cobalt, Ontario, Canada for the Guggenheims and reaped a quick million dollars return. He refinanced American Woolen Co. and Tobacco Products Co., launched Cuba Cane Sugar Co., got control of Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Co., organized Submarine Boat Corp. and the Wright-Martin Aeroplane Co. He was a director of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. By the 1920s he was a director of Sinclair Oil and promoter of Gulf Sulphur, but all these were diversions from his main interest in mining copper.

In 1925, when planning to scout mining properties in South Africa, he became ill and returned home halfway through the trip, his last, lingering illness. Rotund, good-natured, bald, a tireless worker, a devoted family man, Thompson chewed tobacco, underpaid his employees (though equivalent to pay given by his contemporaries) and, as one of the greatest gamblers of his time, discharged them for gambling.

He was prominent behind the scenes in the Republican party, a presidential elector, party chair, as well as served on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1914 to 1919 and was twice (1916 and 1920) a delegate to the Republican National Convention. In 1921, he declined nomination for a cabinet post under President Warren G. Harding. He was head of and principal supporter of the President Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Association from 1919 until his death.

In 1912, he built the W. B. Thompson Mansion at Yonkers, New York. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

During the 1920s, near Superior, Arizona, he built his winter mansion, Picket Post House, overlooking the beautiful desertscape and gardens he created at what is now the magnificent Boyce Thompson Arboretum. &lt;https://btarboretum.org/&gt; The Mediterranean style home is occasionally open for tours through the arboretum.

In 1925, Thompson ordered a luxurious private railroad car, named the &quot;Alder&quot;, from the Pullman Company. The car was later used by ASARCO and in 1971 was owned by the National Railways of Mexico.

Thompson died from pneumonia in 1930 and was buried at the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. A 1935 biography of Boyce-Thompson, &quot;The Magnate&quot;, by Herman Hagedorn, the presidential biographer of Theodore Roosevelt, profiles his life.

His portrait was painted by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury (1862–1947) about 1920-5, and was donated to the New York Chamber of Commerce around 1948/9 by the artist&#x27;s friend, the soprano Jessica Dragonette (died 1980) who had acquired it from the artist&#x27;s estate; she claimed in her autobiography &#x27;Faith is a Song&#x27; (1951) that she offered it to Thompson&#x27;s daughter who set a fee for the privilege of destroying the portrait. The portrait is now in the New York State Museum at Albany.

===Russia===

Thompson visited Russia just after the February Revolution of 1917 which resulted in the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II. The effects of crop failure and starvation were rampant. Thompson was a member of an American Red Cross relief mission that also hoped to encourage the formation of a democratic government in Russia. He was awarded the honorary title of Colonel by the American Red Cross.

The objective of Thompson&#x27;s mission was to enlarge the business opportunities in Russia for himself and his Wall Street associates. But on the ground in Russia, he saw firsthand the suffering of the people and the inability of the social democratic Provisional Government headed by Alexander Kerensky to handle the crisis and feed the hungry. Along with assisting the Provisional government in dealing with the famine, Thompson also endeavored to shape post-Revolutionary Russia&#x27;s political landscape in a manner favorable to Wall Street. Thompson provided $1 million of his own money to fund a propaganda campaign to counteract Kerensky&#x27;s mounting unpopularity, and growing popular sentiment against the ongoing war with the Central Powers. 

With the help of Thompson, the Provisional Government created the Committee of Civic Education in Free Russia to oversee the propaganda drive, with pro-Kerensky Russian revolutionary Catherine Breshkovsky at the organization&#x27;s head. According to W.B. Thompson biographer Hermann Hagedorn, the aim of the propaganda disseminated by the Committee was to &quot;beg the Russians in terms which the simplest could comprehend to obey the government and resume the war, not to save the Allies but to save the Revolution.&quot; Despite Thompson&#x27;s generous funding, the Committee was largely unsuccessful and could not compete with the anti-war propaganda of the Russian radicals, specifically that of the Bolsheviks. The million given to the Committee by Thompson was quickly exhausted, prompting Breshkovsky to appeal to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson for support. Thompson reached out to President Wilson himself, but failed to produce any further funding for the Committee. The Provisional government was overthrown in the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks came to power.

But this did not prove to be an immediate set-back in Thompson&#x27;s plans for Russia. Thompson and his compatriot Raymond Robins attempted to deal with the new Bolshevik government despite the protests of indignant American diplomats and businessmen that the Bolsheviks were merely paid agents of the German Kaiser and not true representatives of Russian democracy. Based on his own observations of Russia&#x27;s political climate, Thompson believed that the new Bolshevik government was certain to remain in power, and that official Allied recognition &amp; support of the Bolsheviks could keep channels of trade open and influence the Bolsheviks to be less radical. According to him, &quot;if [we] leave Russian radicalism to itself to grow like a cancer, it is going to be a menace to the world.&quot; Thompson argued that the Bolsheviks would &quot;soon learn that capital and labor must go hand in hand&quot; and continue the war against Germany. 

Nevertheless, Thompson&#x27;s predictions did not come true. The Bolsheviks withdrew from the war, ratifying the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918. While the Soviet Union allowed foreign investments and free trade for a time during the era of the New Economic Policy, this accommodation ended when Joseph Stalin took power and inaugurated the first five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union.

There is a persistent narrative, most prominently outlined in &quot;Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution&quot; by Antony Sutton that W.B. Thompson gave considerable sums of money to the Bolsheviks. This is a misconception that can be traced back to Thompson&#x27;s own time, originally appearing in newspapers asserting his support for the Bolsheviks. As pointed out by W.B. Thompson biographer Hermann Hagedorn, when the press uncovered Thompson&#x27;s financial support for Kerensky and the Committee of Civic Education in Free Russia, they &quot;jumped to the conclusion that he [actually] had given the money to the Bolsheviki for propaganda purposes&quot; likely because of Thompson&#x27;s unpopular public opinions on the Bolsheviks and their role in the future of Russia.

==Philanthropy==
===Plant research===

In 1920, he decided to establish the Boyce Thompson Institute, and endowed it with $10 million, a veritable fortune in the 1920s. He hoped that this &quot;seed&quot; money would enable the institute to acquire the very best scientists, equipment, and supplies and then to develop relationships with industry and the government to help finance research.
===Other causes===

He donated money for parks and libraries at many of his mining camps, including the Thompson-Hickman Memorial Library in his birthplace, Virginia City; his wife Gertrude Hickman Thompson officially transferred the building to the city in 1918. He donated $50,000 for a park in Butte.

To his alma mater, Phillips Exeter Academy, Thompson donated $2 million during his lifetime. His donations created the Boyce Thompson science building, a new gymnasium in 1923, squash courts, a baseball field, sports cage, The Exeter Inn, and other facilities. He willed $1 million to Phillips Exeter.

Thompson also bequeathed a significant gem and mineral collection to New York&#x27;s American Museum of Natural History.

His wife, Gertrude Hickman, and daughter, Margaret Thompson, inherited the balance of his wealth. In 1941, &quot;The Alder&quot;, Boyce-Thompson&#x27;s 265 ft. motor-yacht, was given to the U.S. Navy to aid the war effort.

Fortunately for future historians, Thompson began writing his reminiscences before his death. However, a word of caution about Hermann Hagedorn&#x27;s &quot;The Magnate, William Boyce Thompson and His Time&quot; (1935) based on this material. Journalist Hagedorn at times writes more hagiography than biography. For example, his depiction of George E. Gunn is libelous—Gunn was not a lowly miner/prospector born in Nevada and working in Montana when &quot;discovered&quot; by Thompson as a worthy partner. Gunn, an Ohian who attended Oberlin and Ohio State University, had worked his way up to mine superintendent when he met Thompson in Helena. The two later became a powerful team (not as Hagedorn writes) after they met again while Gunn was with Guggenheim Exploration, mine finders, and Thompson with Hayden, Stone &amp; Company brokerage. Their Gunn-Thompson partnership was searching in all the major new porphyry districts and developed a number of the major mines by the time heart disease impacted Gunn&#x27;s abilities, then his death a year later March 11, 1913. Gunn the mine finder was a perfect match for Thompson the broker and high wheeling financier. Gunn had the talent in Salt Lake City on his staff or as consultants next door to find the mines—Mason Valley, Inspiration, Magma, for example—while Thompson had the connections to finance the developments. Again, many of the tall tales Hagedorn relates about the pre-1913 era, especially about Gunn, need correctives: Gunn&#x27;s eyes were not gray they were blue and one needs to discount the rest of Hagedorn&#x27;s description of his intellect and appearance; he was not buried by an ex-con and the boys, but by the Masonic lodge he had long been a member of and by a reverend, Hagedorn to the contrary. Same could be said of Hagedorn&#x27;s depictions of and roles of Philip Wiseman, Henry Krumb, Fred Flindt, Walter Aldridge and others. For a more balanced but still dated account see A. B. Parsons, &quot;The Porphyry Coppers&quot;.

<doc id="1059112" wikidata="Q5439886" url="?curid=1059112" title="FedEx Ground">
<text>FedEx Ground, a subsidiary of the FedEx Corporation, is an American ground package delivery company headquartered in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. The company began as Roadway Package System (RPS), founded in 1985 by transportation company Roadway Services Inc., later renamed Caliber System. FedEx bought Caliber in 1998 to complement its existing FedEx Express business and rebranded Caliber&#x27;s RPS package delivery service FedEx Ground in 2000.

FedEx Ground provides US and Canada domestic services as well as international services between the two, branded FedEx International Ground. Its services are cheaper than the time-definite services offered by FedEx Express and its drivers are primarily owner/operators, independent contractors who control individual delivery routes and territories. In addition to its core commercial package services, the company&#x27;s services include FedEx Home Delivery, a US residential delivery service, and FedEx Ground Economy (formerly FedEx SmartPost), a low-cost parcel consolidation service.

== History ==

When RPS was founded on March 11, 1985, it intended to out-compete UPS Ground by focusing on efficiency and structuring itself for lower costs. One result of this drive for efficiency was RPS&#x27; use of barcodes on packages allowing it to track and sort shipments much more effectively. After an intensive effort to shift its operations to use the new technology, RPS became the first company able to track a package through the delivery cycle.

Its parent company, RSI, already owned a number of transportation companies including national less than truckload (LTL) carrier Roadway Express. This backing allowed RPS to grow quickly and by 1988 it was operating 130 terminals covering 70% of the US. After RSI spun off Roadway Express in 1995 and changed its name to Caliber System, RPS was its largest subsidiary.

In 1997, Fred Smith, founder of FedEx, contacted Dan Sullivan, co-founder of RPS and now president of Caliber System, about merging the two companies. FedEx, which at the time only offered air services, was under pressure from UPS which offered both air and ground services. By acquiring RPS, FedEx would get a fully fledged ground network to complement its existing air services. The acquisition of Caliber System was finalized in January 1998.

In preparation for this major acquisition, FedEx had reorganized as a holding company, FDX Corporation, in October 1997. When its acquisition of Caliber was finalized, FDX was the parent of both FedEx and Caliber&#x27;s subsidiaries. It then embarked on significant reorganization to merge its existing business with the new subsidiaries. As part of this effort, it made broad changes to branding for the new acquisitions in 2000. FDX Corporation changed its name to FedEx Corporation, Federal Express was renamed FedEx Express, RPS became FedEx Ground, Caliber&#x27;s same-day-critical trucking subsidiary, Roberts Express, became FedEx Custom Critical, and its LTL freight carrier, Viking Freight was re-branded FedEx Freight in 2001.

FedEx Ground launched a US residential delivery service, FedEx Home Delivery Service, in 2000. It was later renamed FedEx Home Delivery. In 2004, FedEx acquired New Berlin, Wisconsin-based parcel consolidator Parcel Direct from magazine and catalog printer Quad Graphics for $120 million. Following the acquisition, Parcel Direct was renamed FedEx SmartPost and became a subsidiary of FedEx Ground.

On January 14, 2013, FedEx named Henry Maier CEO and President of FedEx Ground, to take effect after David Rebholz retired on May 31, 2013.

Until 2018, most FedEx Ground US operations were five days a week, but this was expanded to six in September 2018 due to the rise in demand driven by e-commerce. Its US services were expanded again during the 2019 holiday peak season to seven days per week, a change which became permanent for the majority of the US population year-round in January 2020.

== Services ==

=== FedEx Ground ===

FedEx Ground is the division&#x27;s core package delivery service which delivers daily to all 50 US states with delivery timeframes of 1-5 days for the Contiguous United States and 3-7 days for Alaska and Hawaii. Its FedEx International Ground service ships packages between the United States and Canada and within Canada.

Given its focus on deliveries to commercial locations, FedEx ground had operated on a five-day a week schedule (Monday-Friday). However, in 2018, it changed its year-round operating schedule to six-days a week (Monday-Saturday) for most US locations and subsequently to seven-days a week in January 2020.

=== FedEx Home Delivery ===

FedEx Home Delivery is a residential delivery service available in the US. It was launched as FedEx Home Delivery Service in 2000 delivering five days a week, Tuesday through Saturday. In 2020, the service expanded to seven days a week to most of the US. The maximum per package weight was also increased from 70 pounds to 150 pounds at the same time bringing it inline with the FedEx Ground limit.

=== FedEx Ground Economy ===

FedEx Ground Economy is a subsidiary of FedEx Ground which provides a parcel consolidation service most commonly used for residential deliveries of small, lightweight parcels. It is cheaper than ground package delivery but speeds are generally one to two days slower. Parcels are trackable but delivery dates are not guaranteed. The service is available only to shippers who meet certain requirements and have a SmartPost contract in place with FedEx.

Ground Economy was originally Parcel Direct, founded in 1998 by Quad Graphics to provide delivery services for its catalog publishing customers. Since its founding, Parcel Direct had expanded both its network of hub facilities and its parcel services buying Commerce, California-based parcel delivery company PaqFast, Inc. in early 2004. When FedEx acquired it in 2004, Parcel Direct had 12 distribution hubs across the US and 450 employees.

Parcel Direct&#x27;s parcel consolidation model relied on &quot;zone skipping&quot;, a logistics approach where packages are transported most of the way to their destination through the carrier&#x27;s network and handed over to the USPS for delivery. This reduces costs by allowing bulk transportation of parcels between hubs and not requiring it to maintain its own final mile delivery network.

Under FedEx, Parcel Direct was rebranded FedEx SmartPost and continued to grow its hub network, reaching 26 nationwide by 2021. Pickups from smaller shippers are performed by FedEx Ground which transfers them into the SmartPost network at the nearest hub. Dedicated FedEx SmartPost trailers pick up from larger shippers and transport shipments directly into the network.

Initially, all final mile deliveries were handled by the USPS. However, starting in 2019, FedEx began shifting SmartPost deliveries to its own Ground and Home Delivery networks and in 2020 said it had completed the shift and was delivering nearly all SmartPost packages itself. FedEx rebranded the service FedEx Ground Economy in 2021.

== Branding ==

In the early 2000s, most FedEx operating units used variants of the FedEx logo with a purple &quot;Fed&quot; followed by &quot;Ex&quot; in various colors. Only the FedEx Express unit used the original color combination of a purple &quot;Fed&quot; and orange &quot;Ex&quot;. The FedEx Ground logo used a green &quot;Ex&quot; under this branding. In August 2016, FedEx announced that it would be standardizing all its operating units to use the purple &quot;Fed&quot; and orange &quot;Ex&quot; previously used by FedEx Express. While the rebranding began in 2016, FedEx said it expected it to take until 2021 for all other color variants to be phased out across all operating units.

<text>James Roos Breithaupt (September 7, 1934 – August 29, 2018) was a Canadian politician. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1967 to 1984 as a member of the Liberal Party. He won a total of five elections, and was the longest serving former Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Kitchener since Canadian Confederation in 1867.

== Background ==
Breithaupt was born in Kitchener, and was educated at the University of Western Ontario, the University of Toronto and Osgoode Hall Law School. He was called to the Ontario Bar in 1962, and worked as a barrister and solicitor. He was named a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1975. Breithaupt was also active in the Canadian Army. An artillery and infantry officer, he was the Commanding Officer of The Royal Highland Fusiliers of Canada from 1971 to 1973 and then was the Senior Staff Officer to the Major General Reserves for Canada, completing 24 years of militia service.

He was the vice-chairman of the Board of Governors of Waterloo Lutheran University, and suggested the new name of &quot;Wilfrid Laurier University&quot; in 1973. He was then vice-chairman of the Waterloo Lutheran Seminary Board for a further six years. Between 1952 and 1982, he spent a total of thirty years on campus as a student, lecturer, Board Member and Vice-Chairman.

==Politics==
Breithaupt was elected to the Ontario legislature in Kitchener at the 1967 provincial election, defeating New Democratic Party candidate Morley Rosenberg by 52 votes. He was re-elected with increased majorities in the elections of 1971, 1975, 1977, and 1981. Breithaupt served as financial and justice critic in the Liberal shadow cabinet for a number of years, and was Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee from 1968 to 1975, when he became the House Leader for the Liberal Opposition.

Liberal leader Stuart Smith resigned following the 1981 election, and Breithaupt entered the campaign to succeed him at the 1982 Ontario Liberal leadership convention. He was initially seen as one of the front-runners in a field of five candidates, but was kept off the campaign trail by a car accident. His wife, Jane, represented him at campaign meetings and rallies. Breithaupt placed fourth on the first ballot, and withdrew from the race. The winner was David Peterson.

Breithaupt resigned from the legislature on November 1, 1984, and was appointed chairman of the Ontario Law Reform Commission.

==Later life==
From 1989 to 1993, he was chairman of the Commercial Registration Appeal Tribunal.

He was the chairman of the Corps of Commissionaires(Great Lakes Division), which employs some 1,200 former Service personnel. He was also the vice-chairman of the Last Post Fund (Ontario Branch) which attends to the funerals and burial of veterans without financial resources. He was the chairman of the German Pioneer&#x27;s Day Committee locally in Kitchener-Waterloo for four years, and was a Deputy Judge in the Small Claims Courts of Kitchener, Cambridge, Woodstock, Stratford and Hamilton since 1993.

Breithaupt is a life member of the Waterloo Historical Society and was its President from 1996 to 1998. He was the Chairman of the Peace Monument 1871 Committee in Kitchener, and Chairman of the World Horseshoe Tournament in 1997. He organized and wrote the Memorial Plaques at the Waterloo Cenotaph in 1994 and 1995 and gathered the photos of those killed for the memorial displays, and he wrote the text for the plaque at the Kitchener Cenotaph.

Actively involved for the past 40 years with St. John&#x27;s Ambulance, he was Chairman of the Kitchener-Waterloo Branch (1967–1971) and went on to become President of the Ontario Council of the Order of St. John (1989–1991). He was a Knight of Justice for the Order of St. John and has his own grant of personal arms.

The Government of Poland has made him a Knight of Merit. He was a member of Branch 412 (Polish) and 165 (Fort York) of the Royal Canadian Legion, the Toronto Artillery Officers Association, and the Royal Canadian Military Institute.

Breithaupt died at Grand River Hospital&#x27;s Freeport Site on August 29, 2018, at the age of 83.

<doc id="1059125" wikidata="Q4877851" url="?curid=1059125" title="Beautiful music">
<text>Beautiful music (sometimes abbreviated as BM, B/EZ or BM/EZ for &quot;beautiful music/easy listening&quot;) is a mostly instrumental music format that was prominent in North American radio from the late 1950s through the 1980s. Easy listening, elevator music, light music, mood music, and Muzak are other terms that overlap with this format and the style of music that it featured. Beautiful music can also be regarded as a subset of the middle of the road radio format.

==History==
Beautiful music initially offered soft and unobtrusive instrumental selections on a very structured schedule with limited commercial interruptions. It often functioned as a free background music service for stores, with commercial breaks consisting only of announcements aimed at shoppers already in the stores. This practice was known as &quot;storecasting&quot; and was very common on the FM dial in the 1940s and 1950s.

Many of these FM stations usually simulcast their AM station and used a subcarrier (SCA) to transmit a hitch-hiker signal to a store receiver by subscription. The signal was usually a slow-moving audio tape of &quot;background music&quot; or Muzak-type service, which was independent of the simulcast AM signal.

Some FM stations made more income from these music subscriptions than from their main programming. WITH-FM, in Baltimore, Maryland (1950s and 1960s), had to keep its FM carrier on the air until 2:00a.m. for restaurant subscribers, and could not sign-off the main FM carrier until that time and thus had to run a repeat of its previous day&#x27;s evening concert on its main FM program line.

===Growth as a radio format===
One of the first beautiful music radio stations in the US was KIXL in the Dallas-Ft. Worth, Texas, area. As early as 1947 it played orchestral music on AM radio (1040), and later on FM (104.5). KIXL changed to KEZL (as in &quot;easy listening&quot;) in 1973, but ended with a change to adult contemporary in 1976.

In 1959, Gordon McLendon, who had interests in Top-40 radio in Dallas as well as other markets, decided to &quot;counter-program&quot; in San Francisco since several Top-40 stations were already there. McLendon established beautiful music AM station KABL (a tribute to the San Francisco cable cars, named by McLendon&#x27;s executive assistant Billie Page Odom) which was successful through the 1990s. It then experimented with combining elements of Big Bands and soft rock until its demise in the early 21st century. It was reborn as an Internet radio station where it can be heard today.

In the early 1960s, the Federal Communications Commission adopted a standard for transmitting and receiving stereo signals on a single channel of the FM band. In addition to delivering stereo sound, FM broadcasting provided clearer sound quality and better resistance to interference than AM, thus being ideal for broadcasting the beautiful music format.

In Baltimore, Maryland, programmer Art Wander developed a beautiful music format for the 50,000-watt NBC affiliate WBAL/1090. The station format launched in the fall of 1960 featured music sweeps of lush instrumentals with subtle comments from their staff announcers. The format changed to sports and talk when competing FM stations broadcast beautiful music and easy listening.

In 1963, Marlin Taylor created a custom-designed beautiful music format at Philadelphia&#x27;s WDVR. Within four months, WDVR became the #1 rated FM station in the Philadelphia market. This was one of the first big successes in FM broadcasting, and was instrumental in establishing the viability of FM. WDVR was a resource for mature listeners who were driven from AM radio at the time when WFIL and WIBG (and others) switched to rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll programming. WDVR&#x27;s billboards made the adult audience aware of the new station.

=== Airtime resell practice. Libraries of music for radio stations ===
Others, such as Jim Schulke, devised a method of buying air time on FM stations in bulk and reselling the blocks to interested advertisers. Schulke formed &quot;Stereo Radio Productions&quot; (SRP) to help his stations get better ratings and pull in more agency advertising dollars. His stations used six hundred reels of stereo reel-to-reel tape set on multiple machines so that 15 minute segments would play at a time, alternating from one player to another, allowing a varied programming format in which no half-hour was repeated within a two-week period. One of Schulke&#x27;s stations using this &quot;matched flow&quot; concept was WDVR&#x27;s chief competitor in the beautiful music format in Philadelphia, WWSH-FM.

&quot;Peters Productions&quot; in San Diego, California was active throughout the late 1960s through the early 1980s. At one time &quot;Peters Productions&quot; offered 7 different syndicated radio formats plus radio/television &quot;station image&quot; packages (custom jingle and integrated promotional graphics packages.) The most popular syndicated radio format was a beautiful music format on a library of 100 reel-to-reel tapes, with 6 new reels provided per month. It originated when founder Ed Peters was station manager of San Diego radio station KFMB-FM. The format aired on over 120 stations during its peak, and was known originally as &quot;Music Only for a Woman&quot;. Later the name was changed to &quot;Music Just for the Two of Us&quot;.

=== Stereotypical instrumental-vocal mixes, related to BM/EZ ===
Many beautiful music programmers constructed their own style of sets, incorporating some vocal songs, usually one to each 15-minute set. Most stations adopted a 70–80% instrumental – 20–30% vocal mix, a few offered 90% instrumentals, and a handful were entirely instrumental. Initially, the vocalists consisted of artists such as Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Peggy Lee, Tony Bennett, Patti Page, Johnny Mathis, Perry Como, Doris Day, and others.

By the 1970s, softer songs by artists like The Carpenters, Anne Murray, John Denver, Barry Manilow, Barbra Streisand, Dionne Warwick, Neil Diamond, Elton John, Nancy Wilson and others were added to the mix on many stations. Also, some of these stations played soft songs by artists like Elvis Presley, Beatles, Billy Joel, and other rock-based artists. The main test for the vocals played was not the background of the artist but whether or not the song was soft. All vocals on such stations had to be soft. Therefore, songs like &quot;She&#x27;s Out of My Life&quot; by non-core artists like Michael Jackson or &quot;Live to Tell&quot; by Madonna would be heard on some of these stations. On the other hand, even uptempo jazzier songs by standards artists, such as &quot;Detour&quot; by Patti Page, would not be heard on beautiful music stations except during specialty shows.

Also, during weekday morning drive times, most beautiful music stations increased the vocals to as much as 50 percent to accommodate a broader audience. While these stations were mostly playing instrumentals, some had a couple of specialty programs that were vocal-based such as a Big Band program on Saturday nights, a Frank Sinatra show sometime on the weekends, and maybe a program featuring Broadway showtunes.

Generally, the recordings heard on beautiful music stations were newly orchestrated arrangements of the songs of the day. These were available from the major record labels and performed by such artists as Andre Kostelanetz, Percy Faith, Mantovani, the 101 Strings, Billy Vaughn, The Living Strings, Frank Chacksfield, among others. When the record companies cut back on releasing this material, syndicators of the format had custom recordings produced for them, performed by many different orchestras from around the world. These new custom recordings were usually instrumental versions of current or recent rock and roll or pop hit songs, a move intended to give the stations more mass appeal without selling out. Some stations would also occasionally play earlier big band-era recordings from the 1940s and early 1950s.

Many beautiful music stations would air a few Christmas songs per hour beginning around Thanksgiving each year, increasing their frequency as the month of December progressed. The stations&#x27; vocal content would typically increase to about 40 to 60 percent of the playlist during this period, as well. There would then be a special marathon of seasonal music on December 24 and December 25. After the 25th, most continued to play wall-to-wall Christmas music until the first of the year. This concept was later borrowed (and expanded upon) by Soft AC, Oldies, and even some country music and Hot AC stations. Today, the average wall-to-wall Christmas format begins on Thanksgiving and ends at the end of the day around midnight on December 26.

The predominantly instrumental-vocal mix is still in use today, mainly by smooth jazz stations.

=== Declining years ===
&quot;Peters&quot; was the first beautiful music syndicator to sell its library in the late 1980s to Broadcast Programming, Inc., which then bought several other syndicators. (BPI, later part of Jones Radio Networks, is part of Dial Global as of 2012.) Bonneville, which had acquired the SRP and Century catalogs in the 1980s, sold its beautiful music assets to Broadcast Programming in November 1993.

Some beautiful music stations (especially on AM) successfully transitioned to adult contemporary formats, often with call letter changes to shed the &quot;elevator music&quot; identity. Many of these stations marketed themselves as playing many of the same songs from the original artists; adult contemporary had the benefit of having core acts that could much more easily be marketed and were more familiar to listeners, as opposed to the lesser-known and poorer-selling studio acts that made up the majority of the beautiful music format.

Beautiful music stations declined in the late 1980s and early 1990s as country music became popular and moved to the FM dial (formerly, country was relegated to AM). Many beautiful music stations, especially in rural areas, switched to country around that time.

While the seasonal Christmas music format helped salvage softer vocal selections from the era even as formats such as adult standards withered, radio industry writer Sean Ross noted in 2005 that this did not apply to beautiful music instrumentals, which remained widely unpopular. Ross noted that beautiful music drew as much revulsion from listeners as novelty songs and that the appetite for instrumental Christmas music, even among older listeners, was mostly restricted to newer instrumental cuts such as from Mannheim Steamroller and Trans-Siberian Orchestra. A slight uptick in beautiful Christmas music artists such as Ray Conniff and Percy Faith was noted in 2024, as much of their body of Christmas works were known hymns and radio listeners were becoming more eager for explicitly Christian content in their Christmas mixes.

==Today==
Today&#x27;s smooth jazz radio stations maintain the structure and style of the beautiful music format. The format continues on a few non-commercial radio stations, including KCEA (89.1 FM) in Atherton, California; KWXY (1340 AM) and (92.3 FM) in Cathedral City, California KLUX (89.5 FM) in Corpus Christi, Texas; KHOY (88.1 FM) in Laredo, Texas; KNCT-FM (91.3 FM) in Killeen, Texas; KGUD (90.7 FM) in Longmont, Colorado.

Jones College of Jacksonville operated WKTZ-FM, a beautiful music noncommercial station, from its 1964 founding until 2014, when it sold the station (and sister station WJAX) to national Christian broadcaster Educational Media Foundation for $3.375 million. EMF ended the beautiful music format and switched WKTZ-FM to WJKV, broadcasting its in-house satellite K-Love network.

Some commercial beautiful music stations still exist, often in areas with large retiree populations. These are often popular in their markets. An annual influx of vacationers from colder climates has helped such stations as KAHM (102.1 MHz) in Prescott, Arizona, and, until 2021 KWXY (1340 kHz) in Cathedral City, California. Most of the remaining commercial beautiful music stations are primarily in markets with major resorts. An exception is WGCY in Gibson City, Illinois which serves rural areas in Central Illinois with mostly instrumental beautiful music.

Today most stations that play beautiful music are either characterized as nostalgia, smooth jazz or easy listening. In Canada, Evanov Communications&#x27; &quot;Jewel&quot;-branded stations in Ontario and Quebec (including CKDX-FM in metro Toronto, CJWL-FM in Ottawa, and CHSV-FM in metropolitan Montreal, among others), which play soft adult contemporary music during the day and standards in the evening, feature an hour of traditional beautiful music from 11:00 p.m. to midnight, dubbing the program &quot;The Instrumental Concert Series&quot;. The Cleveland market features non-profit WKHR 91.5, which plays many classic beautiful and light jazz instrumentals from the 1930s through the 1960s, as well as timeless pop and jazz vocals.

Radio production veteran Jason &#x27;Jake&#x27; Longwell, currently produces and hosts a weekly hour long radio program devoted to Beautiful Music called &quot;Something Beautiful&quot;.

=== Beautiful music without FM radio ===

<doc id="1059131" wikidata="Q7304081" url="?curid=1059131" title="Red Dwarf Remastered">
<text>Red Dwarf Remastered was an attempt in 1997 to bring the first three series of the BBC&#x27;s cult sci-fi sitcom &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; up to date. A collaborative effort between BBC Worldwide and Grant Naylor Productions, it was hoped that remastered versions of the episodes would prove more appealing to broadcasters in international territories. Only Series I-III were remastered, although the BBC had commissioned for the remastering of Series IV and V as well. Doug Naylor decided to put the project on hold and wait for technology to catch up with their vision.

== Changes ==

Some of the changes made for &quot;Red Dwarf Remastered&quot; included:
*Replacement title sequences for Series I, II and III. These retained the initial image of Lister painting the outside of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, but featured a new attempt to realise the original intention to pull out from a close-up of Lister to the entire ship in one uninterrupted shot. This was followed by a new fast-paced opening montage similar to those created for Series III-VIII.
*All-new computer-generated special effects of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; flying through space. Whilst the original series simply featured &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; flying through unadorned starscapes, the Remastered version added backgrounds such as burning suns, icy moons and coloured nebulae. A model dust storm was recreated in CG, and in addition to the typically sedate movement &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; was shown, in appropriate scenes, racing through space.
*Additional post-production visual effects. Including a malfunction effect being laid onto the hologram Rimmer in &quot;Queeg&quot;, Holly on the monitors, transitions and (in close-up) borders being altered or added. Most significantly the starscape outside the windows of the ship interiors was edited, where possible, to match the new special effects. Due to technical restrictions this was possible only when the camera was static.

*Most other model shots of crafts in space being likewise replaced with computer-generated special effects. For the craft &quot;Blue Midget&quot;, as with &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; itself, these modifications amounted to a complete redesign, and matched those that would appear in Series VIII. The new Red Dwarf was created as a 12&#x27; model, but due to space restrictions in the studio they were unable to use it. Minor changes to &quot;Starbug&quot; also reflected the ship&#x27;s Series VII incarnation, with a smaller viewscreen and legs that would tilt backwards.
*Further computer-generated additions and replacements. Including an extended sequence of the polymorph travelling through the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; air ventilation system, a &#x27;time hole&#x27; journey to backwards Earth, and various shots of elevators in lift-shafts. Other minor CGI alterations include those laid over existing live-action scenes, such as a grey opening and closing &#x27;hatch&#x27; being laid over what was, in the original scene, a flip-top bin.
*Additional bluescreen elements being applied to particular scenes, especially during the first episode &quot;The End&quot;. These included skutters placed in the foreground of an early scene, and more attendees being added to the foreground of the McIntyre funeral scene.
*Replacement music and audio effects being applied to all scenes: the show in general was given a more detailed soundscape, a new stereo mix with fully remastered foreground and background effects. The audience laughter track was similarly remixed and adjusted. Changes were specific as well as general: Rimmer&#x27;s mother was re-voiced by a different actress in &quot;Polymorph,&quot; for example; Rimmer was heard to crash into objects after falling through the Cat in &quot;The End&quot; (despite his holographic status); and in the same episode the Cat was supplemented with a hissing noise as he made himself &quot;look big&quot;.
*All videotape work being given a full colour grade, and filmised.
*Cropping of the top and bottom of the original picture to leave a 14:9 &quot;widescreen&quot; picture. (Some versions only.)
*Occasional close-up scenes with Holly in Series I being re-filmed with actor Norman Lovett. New jokes with the character were also added to several episodes. Hattie Hayridge&#x27;s performance in Series III remained the same as the original, however.
*Trimming of some scenes, such as the shortening of George McIntyre&#x27;s speech in &quot;The End&quot;, the removal of Cat&#x27;s fantasy mermaid girlfriend and the &quot;Black card/white card&quot; discussions in the episode &quot;Balance of Power&quot;. Performed partially for pace reasons, and sometimes due to dissatisfaction with the writing or performance quality.

== Reaction ==
The changes received a mixed response from existing fans. Design changes, in particular to the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; ship itself, were generally disliked, and the shift from models to CGI was not seen as an improvement. There was an outcry at the changing of some dialogue, particularly with regards to the removal of certain popular sequences (such as the aforementioned &quot;black card/white card&quot; joke). Naylor, himself, stated that he was slightly disappointed with the results, as the technology required for the ambitious remastering wasn&#x27;t available at the time.

Internationally, &quot;Red Dwarf Remastered&quot; was sold to Japan, South America and other countries with significant success — finding fresh audiences who were unaware of its remastered status. The availability of isolated audio tracks for language dubbing allowed the programme to reach more foreign-language broadcasters.

Most recent UK repeats and the DVD releases of the show have been of the original untreated versions, although appearances depend on a channel&#x27;s individual archive — in early 2003 the remastered &quot;Marooned&quot; incongruously appeared during a repeat run of the series on UKTV Gold that otherwise consisted of the original versions; and they have also popped up from time to time on UKTV G2 in addition to Virgin Media&#x27;s On Demand service. Netflix currently has the original versions on their DVD-by-mail service having previously provided the remasters on the web-based streaming service, and the remastered versions were inadvertently sold on iTunes until mid-2009 when they were &quot;corrected&quot; to the original versions.

Plans to remaster series IV-VI were abandoned due to negative fan and critical reception, although series VIII (produced in late 1998, a year after the completion of &quot;Red Dwarf: Remastered&quot;) retains the CGI model of the ship created for the remastered I-III. This was acknowledged in the show with dialogue about how the ship had changed shape to its original design before the Jupiter Mining Corporation made a number of cutbacks, thus retaining series continuity.

The 2009 Back to Earth specials featured new CGI Red Dwarf which was much closer to the original non-remastered model. Later, in 2012, Series X finally made use of the original 12&#x27; remastered model, albeit cut down length-wise to more closely match the original design.

== Other remastering ==
For the release of the Series VII DVD, the first episode &quot;Tikka to Ride&quot; was remastered. This only consisted of replacing the original last-minute CGI effects from the original broadcast with up-to-date, 2005-standard CGI. The original version was also included on the DVD.

== DVD releases ==

=== Non-UK releases ===
Remastered episodes have found their way onto DVD in continental Europe as the official series releases. Localised releases in Poland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg all contain the remastered episodes. The remastered episodes were also released in Japan in their shorter NHK broadcast edits featuring significant edits, different title and credit sequences and Japanese dubbing. The Japanese version of remastered pilot episode &quot;The End&quot; was included as a bonus feature on the English language DVD release of Series I.

The US Netflix streaming release (though not the discs) also used the remastered episodes for the first three seasons until the show was first removed from the service. When the series returned to Netflix, the original non-remastered versions were used (though with some music replacement). The series has since been removed from Netflix again. In 2017, the series was uploaded to BritBox, where Series I-III run in their original versions.

=== The Bodysnatcher Collection ===
The remastered episodes of Series I–III were made available on DVD in the UK on 12 November 2007 as part of The Bodysnatcher Collection with an identical release in Australia following on 7 May 2008. The box set includes all 18 episodes cropped to letterbox format but still presented in 4:3 as they were on the VHS release. The set also included documentaries concerning the Remastering project and the making of the original Series I and II (as these were absent from the original DVD release of these series). A text track is also included, detailing all changes between original and remastered versions.

The special features include what has been called the &quot;original assembly&quot; of the first episode of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, plus a lost episode, known as &quot;Bodysnatcher&quot;, for which this set is named, which has been created in the same style as &quot;Identity Within&quot; for the Series VII DVD. The release also features commentary and interview contributions from Rob Grant, co-creator of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, marking his first direct contribution to the DVD releases. This set was not released in the US, and it is now out-of-print in the UK and Australia.

<text>John Charles McWaters Beer (born November 24, 1941) is a former Canadian politician. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1987 to 1995 and served as a cabinet minister in the government of David Peterson.

==Background==
Beer was born in Toronto. His parents were Harry M. Beer and Elizabeth Greenway Holmes. He was educated at the University of Toronto, York University, Université Laval and the National Defence College. He worked as an educator after graduating and was the Assistant Headmaster of Pickering College from 1981 to 1986. In 1987, he served as director of the Ontario Conference of Independent Schools.

==Politics==
He ran for the Ontario legislature in the 1977 provincial election, but finished a distant third against Progressive Conservative Frank Drea in Scarborough Centre. He campaigned for the legislature again in the 1981 election, but lost to Progressive Conservative Margaret Birch in Scarborough East.

Beer was elected to the Ontario legislature on his third attempt, in the 1987 election in which the Liberal Party won a landslide majority. He defeated Progressive Conservative candidate John Cole by 5,185 votes in York North, located just north of Toronto. Beer was appointed a parliamentary assistant in 1988, and was promoted to Minister of Community and Social Services and Minister responsible for Francophone Affairs on August 2, 1989. In the former capacity, he started the Advisory Group on New Social Assistance Legislation in 1990.

The Liberals were defeated in the 1990 provincial election but Beer retained his seat beating Progressive Conservative candidate George Timpson by only 158 votes (Ontario New Democratic Party candidate Keith Munro was a close third). Peterson resigned as Liberal leader immediately after the election, and Beer ran to succeed him in the 1992 leadership election. He finished fourth, withdrawing from the contest after the third ballot.

Beer was on the left wing of the Liberal Party and played a significant role in developing the party&#x27;s &quot;Red Book&quot; platform for the 1995 provincial campaign. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government in this election, however, and Beer was among the Liberal incumbents defeated, losing to Frank Klees, later a cabinet minister in the government of Mike Harris, by almost 12,000 votes.

In 1996, he endorsed Gerard Kennedy&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to become leader of the Ontario Liberal Party.

===Cabinet positions===

==Later life==
In the late 1990s, Beer served as the president and Chief Executive Officer of the Canadian Executive Service Organization, a not-for-profit agency that transfers Canadian technical and managerial expertise to developing countries. He served as the executive assistant to George Smitherman, the Minister of Health and Long Term Care. In 2009, he was appointed to perform a review of Ontario Accessibility Act.

<doc id="1059144" wikidata="Q498944" url="?curid=1059144" title="Cisco Webex">
<text>Webex by Cisco is an American subsidiary of Cisco Systems that develops and sells web conferencing, videoconferencing and contact center as a service applications. It was founded as WebEx in 1995 and acquired by Cisco Systems in May 2007. Its headquarters are in San Jose, California.

Its software products include Webex App, Webex Suite, Webex Meetings, Webex Messaging, Webex Calling, Webex Contact Center, and Webex Devices. All Webex products are part of the Cisco Systems collaboration portfolio.

== History ==

WebEx was founded in 1995 by Subrah Iyar and Min Zhu. It had its initial public offering in July 2000. WebEx was listed on the NASDAQ National Market, and then the NASDAQ Global Select Market, when that was introduced in 2006.

The company acquired &quot;Intranets.com&quot; in 2005, providing entrance into the small- and mid-size business market through the company&#x27;s customer base of businesses with fewer than 100 employees. It acquired the ability to offer online collaboration tools such as discussion forums, document sharing and calendaring while Intranets.com provided access to the Webex communications environment for its customers.

In May 2007, Cisco acquired WebEx for $3.2 billion.

At the time of the acquisition, all Webex applications were built on the MediaTone platform and supported by the Webex MediaTone Network (originally called the Webex interactive network), a global network intended for use with on-demand programs. The network was designed by Shaun Bryant, Webex&#x27;s Chief Network Architect, and Zaid Ali Sr, Network Architect, to be one of the first SaaS platforms on the Internet.

In July 2006, AOL and Webex launched a business version of AOL&#x27;s instant messaging software, AIM Pro, with additional features to help workers collaborate using conferencing tools offered by Webex.

On September 26, 2006, the company announced plans to offer a web collaboration &quot;mashup&quot; platform called &quot;Webex Connect&quot;.

On November 17, 2014, Cisco announced an evolution of Webex called Project Squared. On March 17, 2015 this effort was re-branded as Cisco Spark.

On April 18, 2018, Cisco announced that Cisco Spark would be combined into the Cisco Webex platform. On this same date, Cisco rebranded all of the rest of their Spark products to Webex, including the Spark Room Kit—now Webex Room Kit—and Spark Board—now Webex Board.

On May 15, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Cisco CFO Kelly Kramer reported in the month of April 2020, they had 500 million meeting attendees, and that equated to 25 billion meeting minutes, using its video-conferencing application Webex.

In September 2020, Cisco launched a new platform Webex Classrooms for virtual homeroom encounters.

On October 26, 2021, Cisco launched an update aimed to enhance virtual and hybrid in-person meetings and events, using AI-powered technology for their Webex portfolio.

In May 2024, Cisco and Tata Communications partnered to launch Webex Calling in India. 

== Services ==

The WebEx Connect product allows for custom communication workflows, such as those used in customer relationship management. The product allows plug-ins to the WebEx platform to connect to popular messaging and social media platforms.

Defunct products include a business version of AOL&#x27;s instant messaging software, AIM Pro, with additional features to help workers collaborate using conferencing tools offered by Webex.

==Related acquisitions by Cisco==

In October 2020, Cisco acquired BabbleLabs.

In February 2021, Cisco acquired imimobile, a provider of communications platform as a service (CPaaS) solutions for its Webex collaboration portfolio IMImobile.

== Legal proceedings and inquiries ==

=== Goldman Sachs securities fraud investigation ===
As a result of a securities fraud investigation initiated by the SEC and by various state Attorney General offices, Goldman Sachs faced charges of issuing unfair research, including coverage of WebEx, and IPO violations for the period 1999 to 2001. Webex management allegedly dictated to Goldman Sachs analysts what the research should and should not include. Webex maintains the management&#x27;s information was accurate. Another charge accuses Goldman Sachs of violating securities law in its allocation of shares in WebEx&#x27;s initial public offering.

=== Raindance lawsuit for patent infringement ===
On September 27, 2005, Webex sued Raindance Communications, Inc., a competitor, for patent infringement. On October 14, 2005, Raindance filed a countersuit against Webex for patent infringement. Both parties sought both damages and an injunction enjoining further acts they claim to be infringing on patents. On March 31, 2006, the parties agreed to the dismissal of both actions, releases of claims for past infringement, payments associated with those releases, and cross-licenses to each other&#x27;s patents. The agreement resulted in Webex receiving 1 million dollars from Raindance.

<doc id="1059150" wikidata="Q7873400" url="?curid=1059150" title="USS Requin">
<text>USS &quot;Requin&quot; (SS/SSR/AGSS/IXSS-481) , a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named after the requin, French for shark. Since 1990 it has been a museum ship at the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Requin&quot;′s keel was laid down on 24 August 1944 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 1 January 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Slade D. Cutter, and commissioned on 28 April 1945 with Commander Slade D. Cutter in command.

Initially, &quot;Requin&quot; carried heavier armament than usual for a fleet submarine, perhaps because Commander Cutter was one of the most decorated submarine commanding officers going to sea. She had an additional /25-caliber deck gun, as well as two 24-tube rocket launchers, which were intended for use in bombarding Japan during Operation Downfall, the planned invasion of Kyūshū (Operation Olympic) and Honshū (Operation Coronet).

== Shakedown and first conversion ==
Following shakedown off the New England coast, &quot;Requin&quot; departed Portsmouth, on 3 June 1945 en route to Hawaii. She joined the Pacific Fleet on 13 July at Balboa, Panama, and at the end of the month reached Pearl Harbor. However, two weeks after her arrival, three days before she was to begin her first war patrol, World War II ended, and &quot;Requin&quot; was recalled and ordered back to the Atlantic.

&quot;Requin&quot; arrived at Staten Island, New York, on 18 September to begin what would be, in the words of Commander Cutter, &quot;a dull and boring assignment,&quot; essentially becoming a target for sonar school ships. On 6 January 1946, she sailed for Key West, Florida, where she joined Submarine Squadron 4 (SubRon 4). August through November of that year was spent at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, being converted to a radar picket submarine under project MIGRAINE. Her four stern torpedo tubes were removed, along with both of her deck guns and her aft anti-aircraft cannon. Two of her forward torpedo tubes were inactivated, and she was reduced to only ten torpedoes. She also received a new skipper; in October 1946, Commander George L. Street III, who earned the Medal of Honor during the war, took command.

== Radar picket operations==

After leaving the yard, she resumed operations in the western Atlantic and in the fall of 1947 moved north for exercises with her sister radar picket submarine ; on 13 November, she crossed the Arctic Circle. Given hull classification symbol SSR-481 on 20 January 1948, &quot;Requin&quot; began modification to the MIGRAINE II Radar Picket configuration at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. In December, she departed the shipyard after completing trials with new radar equipment. She reported to New London, Connecticut for duty with Submarine Squadron 8.

In May 1949, she sailed east for her first deployment with the Sixth Fleet. Arriving at Gibraltar on 14 May, she operated in the Mediterranean Sea until 30 June. Soon after returning to New London, &quot;Requin&quot; was transferred to Norfolk, Virginia for duty with SubRon 6. Into the spring of 1950, she operated in the western Atlantic, ranging from Nova Scotia to the West Indies. Overhaul occupied most of the summer, and with the end of the year, she prepared for another Sixth Fleet tour. In the Mediterranean from mid-January to mid-May 1951, she resumed operations off the East Coast and in the Caribbean Sea on her return. In August 1952, she was back in European waters. During September, she visited the United Kingdom; then, in October, the submarine transited the Strait of Gibraltar for her regular Sixth Fleet duty.

In 1953, she maintained her schedule of Second and Sixth Fleet operations, but at the end of the year put into Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for an extensive modernization overhaul that among other changes removed her last anti-aircraft cannon. On 2 May 1955, she sailed for her fifth Mediterranean deployment. Detached at the end of July, she returned to Norfolk. She remained on the East Coast, with cruises to the Caribbean, until November 1957, when she resumed duty with the Sixth Fleet.

== Second conversion ==

From June through August 1959, the Charleston Navy Yard in South Carolina removed all of &quot;Requins radar equipment and improved her streamlining. Upon her conversion to Fleet Snorkel configuration, she was given hull classification symbol SS-481&quot;&#x27; on 15 August 1959, and rejoined SubRon 6 in Norfolk for operations as a normal attack submarine, a role she retained until her decommissioning.

&quot;Requin&quot; conducted local operations off the East Coast and in the Caribbean Sea. In the summer of 1961, &quot;Requin&quot; served as a target for Task Group Alpha led by USS &quot;Saratoga&quot; CVA 60. &quot;Requin&quot; conducted a periscope approach on &quot;Saratoga&quot; and launched a simulated torpedo attack. Then a helicopter dropped an exercise torpedo on &quot;Requin&quot;, which hit forward and made several re-attacks bouncing down the port side of the submarine. On 20 September 1963, &quot;Requin&quot; completed her 5000th dive. From 7 January 1964 into May, she operated with the Sixth Fleet, then resumed her Second Fleet duties into 1968, interrupted only twice for extended deployments. Operation UNITAS VII in the fall of 1966 called for &quot;Requin&quot; to cruise around the South American continent for exercises with various South American navies. Her last Sixth Fleet deployment sent her back to the Mediterranean for duty from 4 April to 27 July 1967.

&quot;Requin&quot;″s last Mediterranean deployment began on 4 April 1967. On 8 June, just as she completed a series of exercises with the U.S. Sixth Fleet, she received word that the U.S. signals intelligence ship was under attack. &quot;Requin&quot;″s crew prepared to go to the defense of &quot;Liberty&quot;, but received orders from the Sixth Fleet commander to surface and proceed to Crete.

On 28 May 1968, during her last deployment before decommissioning, &quot;Requin&quot; departed Norfolk, Virginia, as part of the search effort for the missing nuclear attack submarine . On 29 June 1968, &quot;Requin&quot; was reclassified as an auxiliary submarine, AGSS-481, and in October 1968 she began inactivation at Naval Station Norfolk.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
Decommissioned on 3 December 1968, &quot;Requin&quot; was towed to St. Petersburg, Florida in February 1969, and served there as a non-powered Naval Reserve training vessel for Naval Reserve Center St. Petersburg, adjacent to Albert Whitted Airport and Coast Guard Air Station St. Petersburg. On 30 June 1971 &quot;Requin&quot; was reclassified as a miscellaneous auxiliary submarine, IXSS-481, and on 20 December 1971 she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register.

==Preservation==

On 17 June 1972 &quot;Requin&quot; was transferred to a non-profit memorial foundation in Tampa, Florida, and docked in the Hillsborough River adjacent to Curtis Hixon Hall and the Tampa Museum of Art, across the river from the University of Tampa, as a tourist attraction. She remained in this role until 1986 when the non-profit organization responsible for the submarine folded due to insolvency and &quot;Requin&quot; was closed down due to lack of funding and support. Except for briefly reopening in 1988, she essentially remained abandoned at the pier for the subsequent four years.

On 21 February 1990, Senator John Heinz introduced Senate Bill S.2151, which allowed &quot;Requin&quot; to be transferred as an exhibit for the Kamin Science Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On 24 May, &quot;Requin&quot; was towed to Tampa Shipyard for dry docking and hull repairs in preparation for her move to Pittsburgh. On 7 August, she left International Ship Repair in Tampa under tow to Baton Rouge, Louisiana where, on 11 August, she was lifted onto barges and began her ride up the Mississippi River and Ohio River to Pittsburgh. On 4 September, &quot;Requin&quot; arrived at the Kamin Science Center. On 20 October 1990, &quot;Requin&quot; was dedicated as a memorial and museum exhibit and opened for tours.

<doc id="1059160" wikidata="Q7043194" url="?curid=1059160" title="No. 230 Squadron RAF">
<text>Number 230 Squadron Royal Air Force is a Royal Air Force (RAF) flying squadron, currently based at Medicina Lines in Brunei Darussalam, part of British Forces Brunei, operating the Westland Puma HC2. The squadron was previously part of Royal Air Force Germany (RAFG), operating the Puma HC1 there from 1980. Following the drawdown of the British Armed Forces in Germany at the end of the Cold War, the squadron disbanded on 30 April 1992. This was short-lived however, and the squadron reformed at RAF Aldergrove on 4 May 1992, again with the Puma HC1.

The squadron is well experienced in night flying; almost a third of flights are undertaken after dark. The 2004 &quot;Future Capabilities&quot; chapter of the UK Defence White Paper, &quot;Delivering Security in a Changing World&quot;, announced a plan to reduce the squadrons Puma force by six helicopters. It was announced in late 2008 that the squadron was to move to RAF Benson by 2010. The Squadron re-equipped with Puma HC Mk2 in 2014 following removal from service of the Puma HC Mk1.

==History==
===First formation===
No. 230 Squadron was formed on , at Felixstowe, consisting of three flights. Nos. 327 and 328 Flight used Felixstowe F.2 and F.2A flying boats and Fairey IIIs for maritime reconnaissance, whilst No. 487 Flight flew Sopwith Camels on escort duties. At the end of World War I, the squadron was retained as one of the few RAF coastal units. In 1920, the squadron got Felixstowe F.5 flying boats, and it moved to RAF Calshot in May 1922, where on 1 April 1923, it was renumbered to 480 Flight RAF.

===First reformation===
On 1 December 1934, No. 230 Squadron was reformed at RAF Pembroke Dock with Short Singapore flying boats. The Squadron used the Singapore until 1938, serving from Aboukir, Alexandria, Lake Timsah, and after a short return to the UK, RAF Seletar. On 22 June 1938, the first Short Sunderland flying boat arrived, the aircraft the squadron would be equipped with for the next 20 years, in fact until 28 February 1957, when the squadron was disbanded at Pembroke Dock.

===Second reformation===
On 1 September 1958, No. 215 Squadron RAF at Dishforth was renumbered 230 Squadron, flying Scottish Aviation Pioneer light transport aircraft in support of the British Army. In November that year, the squadron moved to RAF Nicosia in Cyprus as a response to the Cyprus Emergency, flying reconnaissance operations against EOKA Greek Cypriot nationalist guerrillas, as well as its normal communications duties. The squadron returned to Britain in April 1959, with its new base being RAF Upavon in Wiltshire. In 1960, the squadron supplemented its Pioneers with larger Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer aircraft, and in May that year the squadron moved to RAF Odiham. In September 1960, the squadron&#x27;s &#x27;A&#x27; Flight was detached to British Cameroon, flying internal security patrols as the colony prepared for the 1961 British Cameroons referendum. The flight returned to its parent formation in September 1961. Westland Whirlwind HAR.10 helicopters began to arrive in June 1962, becoming the squadron&#x27;s standard equipment by the end of the year.

In January 1963, No. 230 Squadron moved to RAF Gütersloh in occupied West Germany, with a detachment at Nicosia. The squadron returned to Odiham in December 1964, before being transferred to Borneo, due to the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation in February 1965. In October 1966, the squadron again returned to Odiham, resuming its detachment at Nicosia. In November 1971, began to convert to the Westland Puma HC1 at RAF Odiham. On 14 October 1980, the squadron moved back to RAF Gütersloh, West Germany, where they remained until being disbanded and reformed at RAF Aldergrove, Northern Ireland in April 1992.

230 Squadron was one of two Northern Ireland based squadrons of the Royal Air Force, the other being 72 Squadron (equipped with Westland Wessex HC2s). 230 Squadron&#x27;s eighteen Puma aircraft were rotated with No. 33 Squadron&#x27;s fifteen Pumas to even out flight hours amongst the fleet (Northern Ireland based helicopters had a much higher operational tempo). The main role of the squadron was tactical transport of the Security Forces, including the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), and the British Army.

On 17 November 2009, 230 Squadron eventually left Northern Ireland for RAF Benson in Oxfordshire (together with 33 Squadron from RAF Odiham) after 17 years in the province.
===Kabul accident===
On 11 October 2015, one member of the squadron was killed in an accident in Kabul, Afghanistan, whilst landing at the NATO Training and Support Mission HQ. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said the crash was &quot;an accident and not the result of insurgent activity&quot;. The crewman was named a day later, and was repatriated back to the UK on the 20th. The Flight Lieutenant&#x27;s CO commented saying &quot;A man with exceptionally high standards, he was never afraid to remind anyone when he felt they could have done better. However, this advice was always delivered with his characteristic wry smile and good humour. The Support Helicopter Force has lost not only an outstanding operator but a good friend to so many... his lasting legacy will be the professionalism and courage he passed onto all who flew with him. A loving husband and father, our thoughts are with his wife and children at this most difficult of times.&quot; A post mortem found he died of severe head injuries. The inquest was adjourned indefinitely until the conclusion of separate inquiries being undertaken by the Ministry of Defence were completed.

The squadron was awarded a new squadron standard in February 2019 by RAF Benson&#x27;s Honorary Air Marshal, Prince Michael of Kent. The standard, the third to be awarded to the squadron, is made of silk, and features the battle honours awarded to the unit since its formation.

On 18 May 2023, No. 230 Squadron returned to the island of Borneo, relocating from RAF Benson to Medicina Lines in Brunei Darussalam, as part of British Forces Brunei.

<doc id="1059168" wikidata="Q7782044" url="?curid=1059168" title="Theodore Shackley">
<text>Theodore George &quot;Ted&quot; Shackley, Jr. (July 16, 1927 – December 9, 2002) was an American CIA officer involved in many important and controversial CIA operations during the 1960s and 1970s. He is one of the most decorated CIA officers. Due to his &quot;light hair and mysterious ways&quot;, Shackley was known to his colleagues as &quot;the Blond Ghost&quot;.

In the early 1960s, Shackley&#x27;s work included being station chief in Miami, during the period of the Cuban Missile Crisis, as well as the Cuban Project (also known as Operation Mongoose), which he directed. He was also said to be the director of the &quot;Phoenix Program&quot; during the Vietnam War, as well as the CIA station chief in Laos between 1966 and 1968, and Saigon station chief from 1968 through February 1972. In 1976, he was appointed Associate Deputy Director for Operations, second in charge of CIA covert operations.

==Early years==
Shackley was born on July 16, 1927, and raised in West Palm Beach, Florida. He enlisted in the U.S. Army on October 23, 1945, at Springfield, Massachusetts as a private, eventually becoming part of the Allied Occupation Force in Germany on completion of basic training. Due to his knowledge of the Polish language (his mother was a Polish immigrant), he became a recruit of U.S. Army Counterintelligence (ACI). As an army recruit he studied at the University of Maryland, and returned to Germany as a 2nd Lieutenant in 1951. Again he served as a member of Army Counterintelligence, where his linguistic skills were used in the recruitment of Polish agents. It was at this time that he was recruited by the CIA, and in 1953 he was assigned to work under William King Harvey at the CIA&#x27;s Berlin Base. In 1961, Shackley married Hazel Tindol Shackley of Bethesda.

==Miami and the Cuban crisis==
During the period (1962–1965), Shackley was station chief in Miami, Florida. While heading the CIA office (known as &quot;JMWAVE&quot;) shortly after the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion, Shackley dealt with operations in Cuba (alongside Edward Lansdale). JMWAVE employed more than 200 CIA officers, who handled approximately 2,000 Cuban agents. These included the famous &quot;Operation Mongoose&quot; (aka &quot;The Cuban Project&quot;). The aim of this was to &quot;help Cubans (exiles) overthrow the Communist regime&quot; (of Fidel Castro Ruz). During this period as Miami Station Chief, Shackley was in charge of about 400 agents and general operatives (as well as a huge flotilla of boats), and his tenure there encompassed the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962.

==Vietnam, Laos, and the &quot;Phoenix Program&quot;==

In 1966, Shackley moved on to the Vietnam War, becoming the CIA station chief in Laos between 1966 and 1968, where he directed the CIA&#x27;s secret war against the North Vietnamese forces in Laos. He also helped coordinate local army efforts against the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese Army in the northern regions of Laos. In late 1968, he then moved to Saigon to become station chief for Vietnam. Shackley was responsible for running the Phoenix Program and the Provincial Reconnaissance Units (PRUs), a secret assassination and capture campaign aimed at members of the Viet Cong infrastructure. However, in his memoirs Shackley claimed that he had not been the mastermind of the Phoenix Program (which had already started before his arrival in Saigon) and did not approve of it, given its disappointing effectiveness in producing intelligence material and &quot;its poor press image&quot; of being an assassination program rather than one for information procurement. In November 1969, he decided a six-months &quot;phase-out&quot; of CIA&#x27;s involvement in the program before transferring it under South Vietnamese control, CIA agents being replaced by CORDS personnel.

Shackley served in South Vietnam through February 1972 when he returned to Langley, Virginia. According to Thomas Bodenheimer and Robert Gould, Shackley was linked to the Australian Nugan Hand Bank where heroin trade profits worth millions of dollars were transferred to after the Fall of Saigon in 1975.

==Western Hemisphere Division and Chile==
From May 1972, Shackley ran the CIA&#x27;s &quot;Western Hemisphere Division&quot;. When Shackley took over the division, one mission for him was &quot;regime change&quot; in Chile (United States intervention in Chile / Project FUBELT).

During this time, Shackley also dealt with the case of ex-CIA officer Philip Agee, who was suspected of having defected to Cuban intelligence. Agee had told acquaintances that he was going to write an exposé of the CIA (published in 1975 as &quot;Inside The Company: CIA Diary&quot;). Shackley managed to get a copy of Agee&#x27;s book before it was published, and according to journalist David Corn, even arranged for Agee to receive a bugged typewriter.

==Associate Deputy Director for Operations==
In May 1976, Shackley was made Associate Deputy Director for Operations, serving under CIA director George H. W. Bush. After Jimmy Carter had succeeded Gerald Ford as President and replaced Bush with Stansfield Turner, Shackley was relieved of his post in December 1977, before officially retiring from the organization in 1979 – when the Carter administration announced wide cuts in the CIA&#x27;s network of officers and informants. Reportedly, he was forced out of the CIA by Turner who disapproved of Shackley&#x27;s involvement with former officer Edwin P. Wilson, who was under federal investigation for smuggling explosives to Libya.

Shackley was suspected by federal prosecutor Lawrence Barcella to be part of Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Egyptian-American Transport and Services Corporation&quot; (EATSCO), a front for his arms smuggling which was also accused of fraudulently billing the Department of Defense. At that time, Shackley claimed that he would have become CIA director if President Gerald Ford had been reelected in 1976 and that only this investigation kept him from becoming CIA director or deputy director under new president Ronald Reagan. In 1982, Wilson was convicted for selling 22 tons of C4 plastic explosive to Muammar al-Gaddafi&#x27;s Libya, and also on the charge of exporting guns. On October 29, 2003, the conviction on the explosives charge was reversed.

==Iran–Contra affair==
On February 5, 1987, Shackley was interviewed by the Tower Commission investigating the Iran–Contra affair. Shackley reported that he met with General Manucher Hashemi, the former head of SAVAK&#x27;s counterintelligence division, in Hamburg, West Germany in November 1984. There, Hashemi introduced Shackley to Manucher Ghorbanifar stating that Ghorbanifar&#x27;s contacts in Iran were &quot;fantastic&quot;. Ghorbanifar, known to the CIA as a person of questionable reliability and veracity, attempted to show that he and Hashemi had influence in Iran by stating that the Iranians would be willing to trade captured Soviet equipment for TOW missiles. Ghorbanifar also proposed that a cash payment be offered as ransom for the four American hostages held in Beirut, Lebanon (which included William Francis Buckley*) and that he act as the intermediary. Shackley stated that Ghorbanifar presented a deadline of December 7, 1984.

Shackley prepared a memorandum regarding the proposal and sent it to General Vernon A. Walters with the United States Department of State. According to Shackley, the State Department responded stating that they would attempt to solve the problem through other channels. *(Vernon Walters did not respond to or resolve the problem of William Francis Buckley&#x27;s capture, who was later tortured to death by the Iranians.) In May 1985, Shackley discussed the hostage issue with Michael Ledeen and shared that he had received no response from Walters regarding the report he had prepared regarding the November meeting with Ghorbanifar. Ledeen asked for a copy of the report and stated that others were still interested in investigating the hostage issue. In June, Shackley prepared an updated second report that outlined a similar proposal from Ghorbanifar in which he suggested a &quot;discussion of a quid pro quo that involved items other than money.&quot; He gave the report to Ledeen who forwarded it to Oliver North, the staff officer on the National Security Council responsible for counter-terrorism. The report outlined a similar proposal from Ghorbanifar in which he suggested a &quot;discussion of a quid pro quo that involved items other than money.&quot; It also received no response.

On February 2, 1987, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; printed an article from Shackley in which he countered allegations that he was involved in the arms for hostages deal. After detailing his encounter with Ghorbanifar in Hamburg and the nature of his reports to the State Department and Ledeen, he wrote: &quot;When anyone asserts that my intervention on behalf of the hostages shows that I must also have participated in the transfer of weapons to Iran and, therefore, must have helped supply the contras with funds, material or arms, I can only gape in amazement and conclude that there are those who have studied logic from a different textbook than I did. To make it plain, I have never played a role in any aspect of the transaction that led to an exchange of weapons for hostages, nor have I been a participant in any activities on behalf of the contras.&quot; Shackley concluded his statement: &quot;I was not a participant in the Iran weapons transfer; I was not in the past, nor am I now, involved in providing aid of any kind of the contras; and I completely endorse the position that no U.S. intelligence operation that is in violation of an act of Congress should be undertaken.&quot;

==Christic Institute lawsuit==
In 1986, Shackley was named as one of thirty defendants in a $24 million civil lawsuit filed by attorney Daniel Sheehan&#x27;s Christic Institute. The suit claimed Shackley was part of a conspiracy responsible for the La Penca bombing, and a number of other covert operations.

Similar charges were made in a 1987 letter from the Burmese warlord Khun Sa to the U.S. Justice Department. The letter, which was transmitted by James &quot;Bo&quot; Gritz, accused Shackley of organizing heroin smuggling from the Golden Triangle in the 1960s and 70s.

In 1988, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida dismissed the Christic suit, after finding it to be frivolous and ordered the Institute to pay $955,000 in attorneys fees and $79,500 in court costs. The ruling was subsequently upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and the Supreme Court of the United States.

==Death==
Shackley died from cancer at his home in Bethesda, Maryland. He was 75 years old.

<doc id="1059169" wikidata="Q15520833" url="?curid=1059169" title="Hugh Hewitt">
<text>Hugh Hewitt (born February 22, 1956) is an American conservative political commentator, radio talk show host with the Salem Radio Network, attorney, academic, and author. He writes about law, society, politics, and media bias in the United States. Hewitt is a former official in the Reagan administration, the former president and CEO of the Richard Nixon Foundation, a law professor at Chapman University School of Law, a former columnist for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and a regular political commentator on Fox News. He is the 14th most-listened-to radio talk show host in the United States.

== Early life and education ==
Hewitt was born on February 22, 1956, in Warren, Ohio. He is the son of Marguerite (née Rohl) and William Robert Hewitt. He describes himself as &quot;a descendant of both Ulster and the Republic through a green-orange marriage of immigrants from County Down and County Clare&quot;. 

Hewitt attended John F. Kennedy Catholic High School in Warren, Ohio. He then graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from Harvard University with a B.A. in government in 1978. After leaving Harvard, he worked for David Eisenhower and then as a ghostwriter for Richard Nixon in California and New York, working on Nixon’s books &quot;The Real War&quot; and &quot;Leaders&quot;. At Nixon&#x27;s urging he attended the University of Michigan Law School, where he was inducted into the Order of the Coif. Hewitt received his J.D. degree in 1983, then moved to Washington, D.C., to clerk for Judges Roger Robb and George MacKinnon on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1983–84.

==Career==
Hewitt worked in many posts in the Ronald Reagan administration, including deputy director and General Counsel of the Office of Personnel Management, General Counsel for the National Endowment for the Humanities, Assistant White House Counsel, and Special Assistant to the Attorney General.

In 1989, Hewitt became the executive director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. In 1990, he sparked controversy by proposing screening of researchers wishing to use the library resources. Hewitt suggested refusing admission to researchers deemed &quot;unfriendly&quot; – specifically Bob Woodward, whom he characterized as &quot;not a responsible journalist.&quot; John Taylor, a spokesman for Nixon, overturned Hewitt&#x27;s decision after two days. It became the subject of editorial rebuke in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Hewitt left the Nixon Library in 1990. He hosted a weekend radio talk show for the Los Angeles radio station KFI, where he broadcast until 1995. In the spring of 1992, he began co-hosting L.A. PBS member station KCET&#x27;s program &quot;Life &amp; Times&quot;, and remained with the program until the fall of 2001, when he began broadcasting his own radio show. Hewitt received three Emmys for his work on &quot;Life &amp; Times&quot; on KCET, and also conceived and hosted the 1996 PBS series &quot;Searching for God in America.&quot;

He has worked as a weekly columnist for the &quot;Daily Standard&quot; (the online edition of &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;) and &quot;World&quot;. He has appeared on programs such as &quot;The Dennis Miller Show&quot;, &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot;, &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor,&quot; &quot;The Today Show&quot; and &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;.

Hewitt also became a professor of law at Chapman University School of Law. Hewitt founded the journal &quot;Nexus Journal of Law and Policy&quot;.

In 2019, Hewitt returned to the Nixon Library as president and CEO of the Richard Nixon Foundation, the nonprofit that co-operates the Nixon Library with the National Archives and Records Administration. He succeeded businessman William H. Baribault. On his first day in the job, Hewitt announced that he would split his time between Orange County and Washington, D.C., and open a Nixon Foundation office in Washington. In November 2021, Hewitt was replaced as president and CEO by Jim Byron.

In March 2020, after Joe Biden won the South Carolina presidential primary, Hewitt predicted that Biden&#x27;s victory would be of little benefit to his campaign and that Bernie Sanders would perform strongly on Super Tuesday; after Biden took the lead on Super Tuesday and eventually won the Democratic nomination, &quot;Politico&quot; named Hewitt&#x27;s predictions among &quot;the most audacious, confident and spectacularly incorrect prognostications about the year&quot;.

===&quot;The Hugh Hewitt Show&quot; (radio) ===
Hewitt&#x27;s nationally syndicated radio show, &quot;The Hugh Hewitt Show&quot;, is broadcast from California from 6 to 9 am EST on weekdays. The show appears on more than 75 stations and is syndicated by the Salem Radio Network. Beginning April 4, 2016, the show moved to a morning drive time slot. Although Hewitt&#x27;s background is in law, government, and politics, he also covers American cultural trends and the entertainment industry. He frequently critiques the mainstream media on air, often inviting journalists to defend their work on the show. His regular contributors include law professors John C. Eastman, former Dean of Chapman University School of Law, and Erwin Chemerinsky, erstwhile Dean of UC Irvine Law School and current Dean of UC Berkeley School of Law (whom Hewitt calls &quot;The Smart Guys&quot;), James Lileks, Mark Steyn, United States Naval Academy English professor David Allen White (who does a monthly Shakespeare showcase), and Congressman David Dreier (R-CA), as well as frequent callers from around the country. He used to spend the 15th hour of the week discussing movies with &quot;Emmett of the Unblinking Eye&quot;.

=== &quot;Hugh Hewitt&quot; (television) ===

On June 24, 2017, &quot;Hugh Hewitt&quot; debuted, a half-hour television show which ran on MSNBC in the Saturdays 8 am EST timeslot. On the show, he conducted interviews and provided commentary on current events. On Saturday, June 30, 2018, Hewitt announced that the show had been cancelled, but that he would continue his commentary on the NBC family of networks. In 2020, NBC and MSNBC stopped inviting Hewitt to appear on their programs, which constituted a breach of contract. Thus, in 2021, Hewitt was released from that contract and started appearing on Fox News Channel. In November 2024, Hewitt quit his position with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; following an appearance on the paper&#x27;s live show.

== Political views ==
Hewitt has described George Will and Charles Krauthammer as models for his style of punditry. &quot;Politico&quot; described Hewitt as an &quot;ardent Reaganite&quot;.

=== Foreign policy ===
In a 2006 interview on CNN with Anderson Cooper, Hewitt said that in regards to George W. Bush&#x27;s decisions while President, the War in Iraq would go down as &quot;one of the wisest he has made.&quot; In regard to the Syrian Civil War, Hewitt stated that President Donald Trump was making a &quot;major error&quot; in deciding to draw down the number of U.S. troops in the country, over seven years after the beginning of the conflict. Hewitt has advocated for increasing the defense budget in the United States, stating that &quot;any Republicans who vote against higher defense spending should be fired.&quot;

=== Donald Trump ===
Hewitt moderated several of the 2016 Republican Party presidential debates and forums, where he clashed with Donald Trump. Hewitt said that Trump did not possess &quot;the temperament to be president&quot;. In February 2016, Hewitt wrote that, despite being repeatedly publicly insulted by Trump, he would support him should he become the Republican nominee for president. In June 2016, after Trump&#x27;s controversial remarks concerning Judge Gonzalo Curiel, Hewitt publicly called on the RNC to disendorse Trump as nominee. A week later, Hewitt reversed his position in a &quot;Washington Post&quot; op-ed. Internal emails showed that a Salem Media executive pressured Hewitt to support Trump, and that the Salem Media executive attributed Hewitt&#x27;s support for Trump in the aforementioned &quot;Washington Post&quot; op-ed shortly after to the pressure. Hewitt denied being pressured to change his position on Trump.

On August 3, he publicly floated the idea of replacing Donald with Ivanka Trump on the ticket. On October 8, he called on Trump to drop out of the race after the &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; tape emerged. Hewitt has said he ultimately voted for Trump.

Hewitt supported Trump&#x27;s decision to re-shuffle his foreign policy staff in March–April 2018, and place John Bolton and Mike Pompeo in key national security positions. He described John Bolton, a zionist hawk, as &quot;peace-through-strength, 600-ship [navy], Reagan conservative&quot; (as compared to Trump&#x27;s approach, which Hewitt likened to the Great White Fleet). According to &quot;Politico&quot;, Hewitt emerged &quot;perhaps the most public advocate for Trump&#x27;s hawkish new national security team at a time when others, even inside his own party, have voiced increasing fears that Trump is surrounding himself with war-minded hawks who may play to the president&#x27;s worst instincts.&quot;

Amid the Trump-Ukraine scandal, which led to the first impeachment of Donald Trump, Hewitt floated a conspiracy theory that the whistleblower complaint that set off the scandal was by a whistleblower who was trying to divert attention from his own involvement in a &quot;Clintons-Obama-Biden collusion debacle&quot;. He penned an op-ed about the impeachment inquiry titled, &quot;Impeachment-minded Democrats, welcome to Al Capone&#x27;s vault. Look familiar?&quot; He said that the FBI had tried a &quot;coup&quot; against Trump and that Democrats were trying &quot;another coup&quot;. He described the July 25 phone call in which Trump requested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy investigate Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, as a &quot;nothingburger&quot;.

In October 2019, Hewitt defended Trump&#x27;s decision to remove a small contingent of U.S. military forces from Northern Syria where they served as a buffer between Turkey and Syrian Kurds, leaving Kurds vulnerable to attack by Turkish forces.

On his podcast on October 24, 2024, Hewitt, in a phone call with Trump, stated that he had voted for Trump for president in 2024.

=== Immigration ===
In a June 2018 interview with then Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Hewitt repeatedly pressed Sessions about the morality of the Trump administration&#x27;s decision to separate undocumented immigrant children from their parents. Hewitt said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think children should be separated from biological parents at any age, but especially if they&#x27;re infants and toddlers. I think it&#x27;s traumatic and terribly difficult on the child.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Hewitt has written several books concerning the Christian faith. He has several times accused the Democratic Party of being anti-religion. He attends church regularly. He is married to Betsy Hewitt, whom he married in 1982. He lives in Virginia with his wife and three children.

<text>Thomas Baldwin Marsh (November 1, 1800 – January 1866) was an early leader in the Latter-day Saint movement and an original member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, who served as the quorum&#x27;s first president in the Church of the Latter Day Saints from 1835 to 1838. He withdrew from the church in 1838, was excommunicated from it in 1839, and remained disaffected for almost 19 years. Marsh was rebaptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in July 1857, but never again served in church leadership positions.

==Early life==
Marsh was born in the town of Acton, Massachusetts, to James Marsh and Molly Law. He spent his early life farming in Westmoreland, New Hampshire.

As a young man, Marsh developed a pattern of traveling and working for various employers. Marsh ran away at age 14 to Chester, Vermont, and worked as a farmer for three months. Then he left for Albany, New York, working as a waiter for 18 months. He spent two years working at the New York City Hotel, then returned to Albany for a year, and then back at the New York hotel for two more years. He also spent 18 months working as a groom for Edward Griswold on Long Island, New York.

During the time Marsh was employed by Griswold, he married Elizabeth Godkin in New York City on his 21st birthday in 1820. After his marriage, he attempted unsuccessfully to run a grocery business for 18 months. He subsequently spent seven years working at a type foundry in Boston, Massachusetts.

During his time in Boston, Marsh became a member of the Methodist Church. However, Marsh became dissatisfied because he came to believe that Methodism did not correspond to the Bible. Marsh left the Methodist Church and joined a group of friends in what others called a Quietist sect.

==Conversion and baptism==
In 1829, Marsh unexpectedly left his home in Boston and journeyed west, traveling with Benjamin Hall, one of his friends from the Quietist sect. In his words, &quot;I believed the Spirit of God dictated me to make a journey west.&quot; He stayed at Lima, New York in Livingston County for three months before returning home. On the way home, he stopped at Lyonstown, where a woman informed him of the golden plates that Joseph Smith was said to have obtained. She directed him to Palmyra, New York, and told him to seek out Martin Harris for more information.

Marsh traveled to Palmyra in 1830 and discovered Harris at a printing office, working on the printing of the Book of Mormon. Marsh obtained the first sixteen pages of the book as a printer&#x27;s proof and also met Oliver Cowdery at the printing office.

Returning to his home, Marsh showed the sixteen pages to his wife. They both were pleased and began to correspond with Cowdery and Smith. After the Church of Christ was formed on April 6, 1830, Marsh moved with his family to Palmyra to join them that September.

Shortly after his arrival, Marsh was baptized by David Whitmer in Cayuga Lake on September 3, 1830, and soon after was ordained an elder by Cowdery. From September 26 to 28, 1830, Smith said he received Doctrine and Covenants section 31, a revelation directed at Marsh. In this section, he was told that he would be as &quot;a physician to the church&quot;

Marsh moved with the church to Kirtland, Ohio in the spring of 1831. He was ordained a high priest and received a call to proselytize in Missouri with Ezra Thayre. Thayre delayed for a long time, and so Selah J. Griffin was appointed to take Thayre&#x27;s place.

==Apostleship==
Smith organized the first Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on February 14–15, 1835. Smith arranged the members of the quorum by age. As there was confusion over David W. Patten&#x27;s birth date, Marsh was identified as the eldest of the apostles and was therefore designated quorum president. According to Marsh&#x27;s autobiographical sketch, published in 1864: &quot;In January, 1835, in company with Bishop Partridge and agreeable to revelation, I proceeded to Kirtland, where we arrived early in the spring, when I learned I had been chosen one of the Twelve Apostles. ... May 4, 1835, in company with the Twelve I left Kirtland and preached through the eastern states, holding conferences, regulating and organizing the churches, and returned September 25. ... In the winter of 1835–36, I attended school, studied the first English grammar under Sidney Rigdon, and Hebrew under Professor Seixas (a Hebrew by birth)&quot;. He traveled east with the Twelve Apostles on a mission later in 1835.

After these activities with the Twelve Apostles, Marsh returned to Fishing River, Clay County, Missouri, in April 1836. Severe difficulties between members of the church and the larger community continued to plague the Saints in Missouri. Animosity had been building for years over what one county judge, Samuel Lucas, and other town leaders saw, feeling the Saints and their revelations were threats to their property and political power. Marsh was chosen as a delegate from his community to try to resolve these issues. Despite the efforts of church members, their Missouri neighbors decided that church members must leave Clay County.

Marsh traveled to Latter Day Saint congregations in other states, including Kentucky, gathering loans at an interest of ten percent to help the Clay County Saints obtain new property. The diary of apostle Wilford Woodruff contains an account of part of that journey:

Aug. 20th - Elder [David] Patten preached at the house of Randolph Alexander, and after meeting baptized him and his wife. Brother T. B. Marsh arrived in Tennessee on his mission to collect means, and attend a Conference with the brethren laboring in Tennessee and Kentucky, which was held on Damon&#x27;s Creek, Callaway County, Kentucky, Sept. 2nd 1836. T. B. Marsh presided. Seven Branches were represented containing 133 members.

Sept. 19th. - Elders T. B. Marsh, D. W. Patten, E. H. Groves and Sister Patten left the Saints in Kentucky and Tennessee and started for Far West, Missouri, where they arrived in peace and safety.

In September 1836, Marsh returned to Missouri and joined the Latter Day Saints in their new location, a city called Far West in Caldwell County, Missouri. The town had been founded by the presidency of the Missouri Stake, consisting of David Whitmer, W. W. Phelps and John Whitmer. Around this time, Marsh traveled to Canada on a mission with Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon. Meanwhile, in Kirtland, the financial situation of many of the church members unraveled with the failure of the Kirtland Safety Society bank. A dispute arose between the presidency in Missouri and the church&#x27;s First Presidency in Kirtland over the land funds, with both sides accusing the other of financial improprieties.

Marsh sided with the First Presidency and convened a series of church courts in the spring of 1838. He charged the Whitmers, Phelpses, and Cowdery of financial impropriety and other failings. The court released these men from their positions and disfellowshipped them. On February 10, 1838, Marsh was put in charge of supervising the church in Missouri, with David W. Patten and Brigham Young as his assistants.

In April 1838, Joseph Smith and his first counselor, Sidney Rigdon, moved to Far West, which became the new church headquarters.

==1838 split with Smith==
In Missouri, some of the Latter Day Saints, led by Sampson Avard, formed a society which came to be known as the &quot;Danites.&quot; According to Marsh, these men swore oaths to &quot;support the heads of the church in all things that they say or do, whether right or wrong&quot;.

Although disfellowshipped, David Whitmer, John Whitmer, Oliver Cowdery, W.W. Phelps, and other former leaders (who were known as the &quot;dissenters&quot;) continued to live in the county. According to Reed Peck, two of these Danites, Jared Carter and Dimick B. Huntington, proposed at a meeting that the society should kill the dissenters. Marsh and fellow moderate, John Corrill, spoke vigorously against the motion. However, on the following Sunday, Rigdon issued his &quot;Salt Sermon,&quot; in which he likened the dissenters to salt that had lost its savor and was &quot;good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men&quot;. Within a week the dissenters had fled the county.

On October 18, a group of Mormons entered Daviess County and engaged in the looting and burning of non-Mormon settlements, including Gallatin. Marsh stated:
A company of about eighty of the Mormons, commanded by a man fictitiously named Captain Fearnot [David W. Patten], marched to Gallatin. They returned and said they had run off from Gallatin twenty or thirty men and had taken Gallatin, had taken one prisoner and another had joined the company. I afterwards learned from the Mormons that they had burned Gallatin, and that it was done by the aforesaid company that marched there. The Mormons informed me that they had hauled away all the goods from the store in Gallatin, and deposited them at the Bishop&#x27;s storehouses at Adam-ondi-Ahmon.

On October 19, 1838, the day after Gallatin was burned, Marsh and fellow apostle, Orson Hyde, left the association of the church. Marsh drafted and signed a legal affidavit against Smith on October 24, 1838, which Hyde also signed. In addition to reporting on the organization of the Danites and on the events in Daviess County, Marsh reported rumors that the Danites had set up a &quot;destroying company&quot; and that &quot;if the people of Clay &amp; Ray made any movement against them, this destroying company was to burn Liberty &amp; Richmond.&quot; He further stated his belief that Smith planned &quot;to take the State, &amp; he professes to his people to intend taking the U.S. &amp; ultimately the whole world&quot;. The committee that received Marsh&#x27;s and Hyde&#x27;s affidavit noted that Marsh and Hyde left the church due to their &quot;conviction of [the Mormons&#x27;] immorality and impiety.&quot;

Marsh&#x27;s testimony added to the panic in northwestern Missouri and contributed to subsequent events in the Mormon War.

Marsh was excommunicated from the church on March 17, 1839.

==Rebaptism in Utah==
On July 16, 1857, Marsh was rebaptized into the LDS Church in Florence, Nebraska. Marsh wrote an autobiography in 1864, recounting his church service and rebellion. It was published in the &quot;Millennial Star&quot; in June of that year. However, his religious affiliation still may not have been fixed. According to Thomas Job, a missionary of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints serving in Utah, shortly before his death Marsh:

had been in the Josephite conference in Salt Lake City, and bore a strong testimony to the truth, and necessity of the reorganization; and when a revelation through young Joseph was read to him he said that it was the voice of God, and again testified that he knew it, and desired us to write to the young prophet to send for him back from here, that he had faith that he would bear the journey, and join the young prophet, if he could go that [last] spring.

After Marsh moved to Utah and joined the LDS Church, he spoke of his split with Smith:
About this time I got a beam in my eye and thought I could discover a mote in Joseph&#x27;s eye, though it was nothing but a beam in my eye; I was so completely darkened that I did not think on the Savior&#x27;s injunction: &quot;Thou hypocrite, why beholdest thou the mote which is in thy brother&#x27;s eye, when a beam is in thine own eye; first cast out the beam out of thine own eye, then thou shalt see clearly to get the mote out of thy brother&#x27;s eye&quot;. While not a reason for his withdrawal from the church, Marsh also admitted that polygamy had been a &quot;great bugbear&quot; prior to his rebaptism, his concern about the practice being resolved when he read writings of Orson Pratt on the subject and understanding it to be &quot;heaven&#x27;s own doctrine&quot;

Marsh moved west to Utah Territory in 1857 and settled in Spanish Fork and later Ogden. He died in Ogden in January 1866. He is buried at the Ogden Cemetery.

==&quot;Milk and strippings&quot; story==
On April 6, 1856, George A. Smith stated that Marsh had left the church because of a dispute between his wife and another female church member over a milk cow, which had escalated all the way up to the First Presidency. LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley has repeated the story, as have official church publications.

==Modern opinion in the LDS Church==
Marsh&#x27;s conversion story is occasionally cited as an example of how powerful the Book of Mormon can be in convincing people of the truthfulness of the church. When his apostasy is mentioned, he is often referred to either as an example of pride or as an example of one who failed to fulfill his calling to serve the church. For example, in 2006, David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, repeated the &quot;milk and strippings story&quot;. He contrasted Marsh&#x27;s faithlessness with the devotion of Brigham Young. Bednar states: &quot;In many instances, choosing to be offended is a symptom of a much deeper and more serious spiritual malady. Thomas B. Marsh allowed himself to be acted upon, and the eventual results were apostasy and misery. Brigham Young was an agent who exercised his agency and acted in accordance with correct principles, and he became a mighty instrument in the hands of the Lord.&quot;

<text>Lawrence Batley Theatre is a theatre in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England which offers drama, music, dance and comedy.

The theatre is named after Lawrence Batley, a local entrepreneur and philanthropist, who founded a nationwide cash and carry chain. The building was originally built in 1819 as a Methodist chapel, called the Queen Street Chapel. The architect is unknown but the chief mason was Joseph Kaye, the man who was also responsible for Huddersfield station. It was opened on 9 July 1819 and the reporter in the Leeds Mercury described it as &quot;one of the most handsome and commodious chapels in the kingdom; being capable of accommodating 3000 persons, and has been erected at an expense of from 8 to £10,000&quot;. 

The chapel became a mission in 1906 until a decline in numbers saw the mission move out of the building in 1970 to a new building in King Street. In 1973 the building was converted into an arts centre; serious structural problems discovered by Kirklees Metropolitan Council in 1975 meant that the Arts Centre was rehoused on Venn Street, with the chapel building remaining vacant before being sublet to Novosquash Limited and converted into a squash club known as The Ridings. It also housed a restaurant and The Catacombs Disco. 

In 1989 the Kirklees Theatre Trust was given the go ahead to save the building from deterioration and launch Huddersfield&#x27;s newest theatre. Building work for the theatre started in September 1992 and took 4 years to complete.

<doc id="1059178" wikidata="Q4711145" url="?curid=1059178" title="Albert Roy">
<text>Albert J. Roy (born February 23, 1939) is a jurist and former politician in Ontario, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1971 to 1984 as a member of the Ontario Liberal Party.

==Background==
Roy was born in Saskatchewan and educated at the University of Ottawa. He was called to the bar in 1965. He worked as a lawyer before entering political life, and was active in the Association des Jeunes Adultes Franco Ontariens.

==Politics==
He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1971 provincial election, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Jules Morin by 5,127 votes in Ottawa East. Roy&#x27;s election was one of the few significant gains for the Liberals in this campaign, as the party finished a distant second in the legislature against the governing Progressive Conservatives of William Davis.

Roy was re-elected with an increased majority in the 1975 election, in which the Progressive Conservatives were brought down to a minority government. Liberal leader Robert Nixon resigned soon after this election, and Roy entered the race to succeed him. He finished third at the party&#x27;s 1976 leadership convention, behind Stuart Smith and David Peterson.

He was re-elected in 1977, and 1981. He continued to serve in the legislature until he resigned to run in the 1984 federal election. Roy contested Ottawa—Carleton for the Liberal Party of Canada, and lost to Barry Turner of the Progressive Conservative Party by 3,946 votes. His defeat marked only the second time in one hundred years that the riding of Ottawa—Carleton elected a Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament.

==Later life==
Roy returned to his legal practice after this loss, and served as chair of the Ottawa-Carleton French Language Association Advisory Committee in 1985 and 1986. He was appointed to the Ontario Superior Court in 1995. He retired in 2014. He is active in the Ottawa Dispute Resolution Group.

<text>Binocular rivalry is a phenomenon of visual perception in which perception alternates between different images presented to each eye.

When one image is presented to one eye and a very different image is presented to the other (also known as dichoptic presentation), instead of the two images being seen superimposed, one image is seen for a few moments, then the other, then the first, and so on, randomly for as long as one cares to look. For example, if a set of vertical lines is presented to one eye, and a set of horizontal lines to the same region of the retina of the other, sometimes the vertical lines are seen with no trace of the horizontal lines, and sometimes the horizontal lines are seen with no trace of the vertical lines.

At transitions, brief, unstable composites of the two images may be seen. For example, the vertical lines may appear one at a time to obscure the horizontal lines from the left or from the right, like a traveling wave, switching slowly one image for the other. Binocular rivalry occurs between any stimuli that differ sufficiently, including simple stimuli like lines of different orientation and complex stimuli like different alphabetic letters or different pictures such as of a face and of a house.

Very small differences between images, however, might yield singleness of vision and stereopsis. Binocular rivalry has been extensively studied in the last century. In recent years neuroscientists have used neuroimaging techniques and single-cell recording techniques to identify neural events responsible for the perceptual dominance of a given image and for the perceptual alternations.

==Types==
When the images presented to the eyes differ only in their contours, rivalry is referred to as &quot;binocular contour rivalry&quot;. When the images presented to the eyes differ only in their colours, rivalry is referred to as &quot;binocular colour rivalry&quot;. When the images presented to the eyes differ only in their lightnesses, a form of rivalry called &quot;binocular lustre&quot; may be seen. When an image is presented to one eye and a blank field to the other, the image is usually seen continuously. This is referred to as &quot;contour dominance&quot;. Occasionally however, the blank field, or even the dark field of a closed eye, can become visible, making the image invisible for about as long as it would be invisible were it in rivalry with another image of equal stimulus strength. When an image is presented to one eye and a blank field to the other, introducing a different image onto the blank field usually results in that image being seen immediately. This is referred to as &quot;flash suppression&quot;.

==History==

Binocular rivalry was discovered by Porta. Porta put one book in front of one eye, and another in front of the other. He reported that he could read from one book at a time and that changing from one to the other required withdrawing the &quot;visual virtue&quot; from one eye and moving it to the other. According to , binocular colour rivalry was first reported by . also recorded it when looking at different colours from spectra in the bevel of a mirror. The clearest early description of both colour and contour rivalry was made by . To experience colour rivalry Dutour either crossed his eyes or overdiverged his eyes (a form of free fusion commonly used also at the end of the 20th century to view Magic Eye stereograms) to look at differently coloured pieces of cloth or differently coloured pieces of glass . To experience contour rivalry Dutour again used free fusion of different objects or used a prism or a mirror in front of one eye to project different images into it. The first clear description of rivalry in English was by . Wheatstone invented the stereoscope, an optical device (in Wheatstone&#x27;s case using mirrors) to present different images to the two eyes.

==Early theories==

Various theories were proposed to account for binocular rivalry. Porta and Dutour took it as evidence for an ancient theory of visual perception that has come to be known as suppression theory. Its essential idea is that, despite having two eyes, we see only one of everything (known as singleness of vision) because we see with one eye at a time. According to this theory, we do not normally notice the alternations between the two eyes because their images are too similar. By making the images very different, Porta and Dutour argued, this natural alternation can be seen. Wheatstone, on the other hand, supported the alternative theory of singleness of vision, fusion theory, proposed by Aristotle. Its essential idea is that we see only one of everything because the information from the two eyes is combined or fused. Wheatstone also discovered binocular stereopsis, the perception of depth arising from the lateral placement of the eyes. Wheatstone was able to prove that stereopsis depended on the different horizontal positions (the horizontal disparity) of points in the images viewed by each eye by creating the illusion of depth from flat depictions of such images displayed in his stereoscope. Such stereopsis is impossible unless information is being combined from each eye. Although Wheatstone&#x27;s discovery of stereopsis supported fusion theory, he still had to account for binocular rivalry. He regarded binocular rivalry as a special case in which fusion is impossible, saying &quot;the mind is inattentive to impressions made on one retina when it cannot combine the impressions on the two retinae together so as to occasion a perception resembling that of some external object&quot; (p. 264).

Other theories of binocular rivalry dealt more with how it occurs than why it occurs. Dutour speculated that the alternations could be controlled by attention, a theory promoted in the nineteenth century by Hermann von Helmholtz. But Dutour also speculated that the alternations could be controlled by structural properties of the images (such as by temporary fluctuations in the blur of one image, or temporary fluctuations in the luminance of one image). This theory was promoted in the nineteenth century by Helmholtz&#x27;s traditional rival, Ewald Hering.

==Empirical studies: B. B. Breese (1899, 1909)==

The most comprehensive early study of binocular rivalry was conducted by . Breese quantified the amount of rivalry by requiring his observers to press keys while observing rivalry for 100-second trials. An observer pressed one key whenever and for as long as he or she saw one rival stimulus with no trace of the other, and another key whenever and for as long as he or she saw the other rival stimulus with no trace of the first. This has come to be known as recording periods of exclusive visibility. From the key-press records (Breese&#x27;s were made on a kymograph drum), Breese was able to quantify rivalry in three ways: the number of periods of exclusive visibility of each stimulus (the rate of rivalry), the total duration of exclusive visibility of each stimulus, and the average duration of each period of rivalry.

Breese first found that although observers could increase the time one rival stimulus was seen by attending to it, they could not increase the rate of that stimulus. Moreover, when he asked his observers to refrain from moving their eyes over the attended stimulus, control was abolished. When he asked observers specifically to move their eyes over one stimulus, that stimulus predominated in rivalry. He could also increase predominance of a stimulus by increasing the number of its contours, by moving it, by reducing its size, by making it brighter, and by contracting the muscles on the same side of the body as the eye viewing that stimulus. Breese also showed that rivalry occurs between afterimages. Breese also discovered the phenomenon of monocular rivalry: if the two rival stimuli are optically superimposed to the same eye and one fixates on the stimuli, then alternations in the clarity of the two stimuli are seen. Occasionally, one image disappears altogether, as in binocular rivalry, although this is much rarer than in binocular rivalry.

==Other senses==

Auditory and olfactory forms of perceptual rivalry can occur when there are conflicting and so rivaling inputs into the two ears or two nostrils.

<doc id="1059187" wikidata="Q6768515" url="?curid=1059187" title="Mark Lawson">
<text>Mark Gerard Lawson is an English journalist, broadcaster and author. Specialising in culture and the arts, he is best known for presenting the flagship BBC Radio 4 arts programme &quot;Front Row&quot; between 1998 and 2014. He is also a &quot;Guardian&quot; columnist, and presented &quot;Mark Lawson Talks To...&quot; on BBC Four from 2006 to 2015.

== Life and career ==
Born in Hendon, north London, Lawson was raised in Leeds, where his father was a marketing director for the Civil Service and British Telecom. Both of his parents originated from the northeast of England.

He was brought up a Catholic, and was educated at the independent Catholic school St Columba&#x27;s College in St Albans. He then took a degree in English at University College London, where his lecturers included John Sutherland and A. S. Byatt.

Lawson became a freelance contributor to numerous publications in 1984, beginning on &quot;The Universe&quot; in that year, and for &quot;The Times&quot; from 1984 to 1986. He has written a column for &quot;The Guardian&quot; since 1995, having previously written for &quot;The Independent&quot; (1986–95), and has twice been TV Critic of the Year, as well as winning many other journalism awards. However, Richard Gott, a former colleague, commented in 2002 that the &quot;prevalence of the bland and the obsequious&quot; on &quot;The Guardian&quot; is typified by Lawson&#x27;s &quot;embedded presence&quot;.

Lawson presented &quot;The Late Show&quot; on BBC2 in the 1990s and presented its offshoot &quot;The Late Review&quot; (later &quot;Sunday Review&quot; and from 2000 &quot;Newsnight Review&quot;) until the 2005 &quot;review of the year&quot; edition of &quot;Newsnight Review&quot;, broadcast on 16 December, which marked the end of his association with the format. In 2004, Lawson made a documentary for BBC Four called &quot;The Truth About Sixties TV&quot;, criticising what he called &quot;golden ageists&quot; who, he said, had a rose-tinted view of television&#x27;s past.

Lawson became the main presenter of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s daily arts programme, &quot;Front Row&quot;, in 1998. He has written several radio plays for the network, including &quot;St Graham and St Evelyn&quot; (2003) on the friendship between the Catholic novelists Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh and &quot;The Third Soldier Holds His Thighs&quot; (2005) on Mary Whitehouse&#x27;s unsuccessful litigation against the National Theatre production of Howard Brenton&#x27;s play &quot;The Romans in Britain&quot;. Lawson has also written episodes of the television version of the BBC sitcom &quot;Absolute Power&quot; appearing as himself in the series 1 episode 2, &quot;Pope Idol&quot;. He is one of many celebrities impersonated by the &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; team, referred to as &quot;Britain&#x27;s brainiest potato&quot; and &quot;the thinking woman&#x27;s potato&quot; because of his baldness. His in-depth, one-to-one interviews for BBC Four, entitled &quot;Mark Lawson Talks to …&quot;, ran from 2006 to 2015.

In addition to his work in print journalism and the broadcast media, Lawson has written five books, both fiction and non-fiction. His first, &quot;Bloody Margaret&quot; (1991), is a collection of novellas on late 20th-century politics in the UK, including an eponymous satire concerning Margaret Thatcher. This was followed by &quot;The Battle for Room Service&quot; (1993), a travelogue of people, politics and culture encountered by Lawson as a journalist. His 1995 book &quot;Idlewild&quot; is an alternative history novel in which both John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe survived the 1960s. &quot;Going Out Live&quot; (2001) focused on contemporary celebrity culture and the media, and &quot;Enough is Enough&quot; (2005) is a satire set in the government of Harold Wilson during the late 1960s. Lawson chaired the judges for the 2011 Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine.

In 2006, Lawson witnessed, and reported to the BBC, a sexual assault on a BBC staff member by Jimmy Savile, later found to have been a prolific sex offender. This was recorded in the Dame Janet Smith Review report of 2016. In 2022, Lawson wrote about this encounter and his personal experience of Savile in British society.

Lawson&#x27;s connection with &quot;Front Row&quot; ended in March 2014 for &quot;personal reasons&quot; in a joint agreement with the BBC. An internal report completed in January investigated claims of bullying within the BBC Radio Arts, which produces &quot;Front Row&quot;, and identified one producer and presenter as responsible. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on 5 March that Lawson was the presenter involved and he had been accused of &quot;browbeating junior staff&quot; who are often young freelancers. Lawson denied bullying. In his 2016 novel &quot;The Allegations&quot;, a lecturer at a fictional English university faces disciplinary action and dismissal for &quot;B&amp;H&quot; (bullying and harassment). Dr Tom Pimm is accused of sighing during departmental meetings, &quot;divisive social invitations&quot; and &quot;visual Insubordination (sic) towards senior management&quot;. Pimm attends a hearing during which he is told that &quot;if someone felt you were being insensitive then, to all intents and purposes, you were&quot;. In the book&#x27;s afterword, Lawson writes It is the case that during a long, generally privileged and happy career in the media, I suffered one devastating experience of institutional group-think, baffling and contradictory management, false accusation and surreally sub-legal process; and have personal knowledge of the damage to reputation, employability and health that can result from such an ordeal.

Lawson supports Northampton Town FC and frequently goes to games, both at Sixfields Stadium and away. He lives near Towcester in Northamptonshire.

<text>The Huddersfield Philharmonic Orchestra is an amateur orchestra based in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England.

== Origins ==

In 1862 the first orchestra in Huddersfield to achieve lasting permanence was established by Rev JH Thomas, as ‘Mr Thomas’s Band’. It changed its name to the Fitzwilliam Street Philharmonic Society and then ultimately Huddersfield Philharmonic Orchestra.

S H Crowther, in &quot;An Orchestral Centenary&quot; (about the orchestra’s history) claimed 1871 as the date of creation of the ‘Huddersfield Phil’ and the orchestra duly celebrated its centenary in 1971. However R A Edwards later pointed out in &quot;And the Glory&quot; (his history of Huddersfield Choral Society) that this claim was inaccurate; and the society’s present archivist now confirms that it was shortly after Thomas’s death that the orchestra renamed itself the Huddersfield Philharmonic, giving its first concert under that name on 7 February 1885.

The Rev J H Thomas was a Cambridge graduate, expert linguist and accomplished musician, who was initially ordained into the Church of England but who later abandoned Anglicanism in favour of Unitarianism. In 1862 he came to Huddersfield as Unitarian minister in Fitzwilliam Street, where he remained until his death in 1884. According to the &quot;Huddersfield Examiner&quot; obituary notice,
‘he got a number of lads and young men around him. For five or six years he gave lessons gratuitously…. And bought many instruments for the band out of his small means…For the first few years the music of the band was exceedingly crude and often painfully out of tune; but the band was always an improving one…’
Among the Rev Thomas’s successors as conductors was John North (conductor also of the Choral and Glee &amp; Madrigal Societies). He began his working life as a butcher’s errand boy at the age of nine. A vacancy soon arose for an errand boy at Joe Wood’s music shop (founded in 1850) and Johnny North was taken on. This was to transform his life completely. Encouraged by Joe Wood he became an adept pianist and reliable tuner; he also took up the cornet and developed into a fine violinist. In his short and crowded life (he died at the age of 39) he held various posts as organist; in addition to the Huddersfield Choral Society, he conducted the Holmfirth and Keighley Societies and also further afield.

The programmes given by the orchestra in John North’s day were typical of the period with a multiplicity of items; the orchestra played nothing more substantial than an overture, and vocal and instrumental solos predominated. The October 1888 concert, for instance, featured two vocalists, two pianists and a violinist; the purely orchestral works ranged from Rossini’s Semiramide overture and a gavotte (True Love) to a selection from Cellier’s Dorothy and a Waldteufel waltz. Three years later a similar programme was given, though this did contain a full concerto – Mendelssohn’s First Piano Concerto played on the ‘grand pianoforte’ by Master G G Stocks.

== Early years ==

For many years before and during the First World War the orchestra was conducted by another prominent local musician, J E Ibeson (a descendant of whom is a current playing member). At some time he was succeeded by Frederick Dawson, a leading concert pianist and former pupil of Grieg. He in turn was succeeded by J Fletcher Sykes in 1920; some time in the early 1930s the latter was briefly followed by F W Sykes, about whom nothing is known.

== Orchestra during and after the wars ==

The inter-war years were a difficult time for orchestras, professional as well as amateur, and the Huddersfield Phil was no exception. One factor peculiar to Huddersfield exacerbated matters. Arthur Willie Kaye was a local musician of humble origin who by dint of self-sacrifice and sheer hard work had turned himself into one of the country’s greatest violin teachers (it is estimated that he launched over 100 violinists on professional careers); and in Huddersfield at any rate, he had become a ‘legend in his own lifetime’. He formed his own symphony orchestra with enormous string sections drawn mainly from his own pupils: for concerts, brass and woodwind were imported from the Hallé. Though this orchestra’s ascendancy in the 1920s was short-lived, at that time it completely eclipsed the Phil. The Phil also faced competition from another body about which little is known – the Huddersfield &#x27;Permanent&#x27; Orchestra. In the 1930s,says Crowther (op cit) the orchestra’s fortunes fell further ‘…. on one occasion it looked as if there were more players on the platform than there were men and women in the audience.’

But despite that depressing outlook, the members of the Phil persevered and their persistence was to be rewarded. Some signs of better days ahead had already appeared when T H Crowther became the orchestra’s conductor in 1935 (a concert in 1936, for instance, included Franck’s Symphonic Variations and Tchaikovsky’s ‘Pathétique’ Symphony) . During the Second World War, the orchestra continued to rehearse, but gave only one concert (in April, 1943, when the Town Hall was filled to capacity). In the absence of Crowther through illness, this concert was conducted by William Rees.

At the end of the war the Society was determined to raise both its standards and its profile. A major decision was that the Society should engage a professional conductor and in 1946, following the resignation of T H Crowther, William Rees took up the post. A one-time student under Felix Weingartner and former violinist with the Hallé, Rees was an experienced musician who quickly became a firm favourite with orchestra and audience alike. His appointment marked a definite turning-point: from then on, the orchestra’s rise to its present eminence as one of the country’s leading non-professional orchestras was steady and assured. A notable early concert occurred in 1947 when Margaret Binns made her first appearance as Leader, a post she was to hold with great distinction until her retirement in 1982. Also in that year, Geoffrey Phillips was appointed Treasurer: he was to remain a member of the committee for over 40 years until his death. The concert of 1 May 1995 was dedicated to a celebration of his life.

In 1952 the orchestra gave the first performance in Huddersfield of Beethoven’s ‘Choral’ Symphony (the choir was the now defunct Huddersfield Vocal Union). In 1954 the Brunswick Symphony Orchestra came to Huddersfield as guests of the Phil, and the Phil visited Brunswick in the following year. The programme, which included Dvořák’s Eighth Symphony and soloist Margaret Binns in Mozart’s Violin Concert in A (K219), was very well received.

A characteristic feature of the Rees years was the development of a repertoire which was both solid and enterprising. In 1956, for instance, works ranged from Brahms’ Fourth Symphony to Rodrigo’s Guitar Concerto (at the time both the work and the soloist – Julian Bream – were relatively unknown). In 1958 a bold programme featured Brahms’ Alto Rhapsody and Wagner’s rarely heard Love Feast of the Apostles (in which the orchestra was joined by the Colne Valley Male Voice Choir). The orchestra was responsible for the first Huddersfield performance of the Beethoven triple Concerto (with ‘local’ soloists Margaret Binns, Pauline Dunn and Keith Swallow). William Rees’ retirement in 1964 was a matter of great regret; for almost twenty years he had enjoyed an exceptionally warm rapport with members of the orchestra, but it was understood that the time had come when he wished to be released from the strain of the road journey from his home in Lytham St Anne’s for rehearsals and concerts.

His successor, Arthur Butterworth, had already acted as the orchestra’s associate conductor. Originally a trumpeter with the Scottish and Hallé orchestras, he had given up his playing career in order to concentrate on conducting and composing, in which his reputation was steadily growing. (His skill as an orchestrator was recognised by Barbirolli who more than once called upon him, in the Hallé’s cash-strapped 1950s, to cue the parts of unaffordable ‘extras’ into those of standard instruments.) Butterworth was to conduct the Phil for the next 30 years. He inherited a well-established, confident orchestra – already large, it was to grow under him still further (in the 1971-72 Centenary [sic] Season no fewer than 113 players are listed in the programme including an amazing 81 strings).

In the 1960s amateur orchestras began to leave the safe havens of the classical core repertoire, and Butterworth relished the opportunity to steer the orchestra’s great potential into previously uncharted waters. Not that he had a free hand in the matter: nowadays conductors are usually titled ‘artistic directors’ and wield the powers implicit in that title, but in 1964, as was the way with organisations like the Phil ‘the committee’ reigned supreme – even in the choice of repertoire and soloists. The conductor was consulted on these matters but he had no executive powers. Soon after Butterworth’s appointment he suggested that the orchestra should play Elgar’s Enigma Variations for the first time. His proposal was accepted, though not without some misgivings on the part of the committee that such a ‘difficult’ work should be tackled. Nowadays the programming of such a work would be seen merely as routine.

In fact Butterworth was able to persuade the committee to expand the repertoire in all directions. Standard classics were not neglected (there were memorable performances of Beethoven’s Eroica and, in the Centenary [sic] Season, with the Huddersfield Choral Society, that composer’s Ninth Symphony) but works as diverse as Hindemith’s Symphonic Metamorphoses, Berlioz’s Harold in Italy, Prokofiev’s Firth Symphony, Respighi’s The Pines of Rome, Janáček’s Sinfonietta, Holst’s The Planets and the Mussorgsky/Ravel Pictures at an Exhibition figured in Butterworth’s early years. His predilection for the music of Sibelius was also gratified: over the years four of the seven symphonies were played. His own music was occasionally performed and he was commissioned to write a work for the Centenary Season. From the Tower of Winds was the result.

== Modern orchestra ==

It was in the late 1970s that the orchestra first tackled a Mahler symphony. At that time &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s northern edition (edited by the music critic and author, Michael Kennedy) ran a weekly ‘Music in the North’ column and in one such edition he drew attention to the performance, noting that he would never have anticipated the day when an amateur orchestra would play a Mahler symphony. In singling out the Phil he was according it a well-deserved accolade.

Later years brought performances of Béla Bartók&#x27;s Concerto for Orchestra, Edward Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;, Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;La mer&quot; and Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Four Sea Interludes&quot;. In 1989, after 25 years in office, Arthur Butterworth hinted that he did not plan to go on indefinitely though it was not until 1993 that he gave his final concert.

Butterworth was succeeded by Rupert D&#x27;Cruze. Originally trained as a trombonist, D&#x27;Cruze soon turned to conducting, winning prizes in competitions in Hungary and Japan in 1992. D’Cruze broadened the orchestra’s repertoire even further, showing an especial proclivity for the music of Gustav Mahler. The orchestra performed of the Sixth Symphony in 1995, and the First and Fifth were also performed under his leadership. In 1997 the orchestra gave the world premiere of All The Long Night Through, a commissioned piece from Bill Connor, for piano, percussion and orchestra. In 1997 they performed of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, reviewed in the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; in the following glowing terms. 
‘… (this work) long feared by the best of performers, was undertaken with immense confidence and vigour. This performance worked because D&#x27;Cruze not only knew that score extremely well but succeeded in shaping its disparate sections into a satisfying whole…’
The years 2000 and 2001 saw the Phil produce a CD of significant performances whilst planning major concerts, including performances of Sally Beamish’s concerto for saxophone, The Imagined Sound of Sun on Stone, with John Harle as soloist and another huge Mahler symphony, his third. When John Harle was taken ill, a potential problem became the beginning of a new musical friendship when his place was taken by Jack Liebeck, in a performance of the Mendelssohn Violin concerto. “Victory snatched from the jaws of defeat “read the headline in the &quot;Huddersfield Examiner&quot;, and the reviewer commented “Clearly, members knew this piece but, to dust it down in one hour and give such a performance demonstrates the talent which the Huddersfield Philharmonic has in its ranks.” If this concert tested the abilities of the players, the plans for Mahler’s Third Symphony were to With the sudden unavailability of Rupert D’Cruze, Nicholas Cleobury stepped in to take on the task of performing Mahler’s Third Symphony and, following this success, he was appointed as Principal Guest Conductor within two years. He has attracted comments including:
‘Guest conductor Nicholas Cleobury paid the orchestra the supreme compliment of making no concession to its “amateur” status’
 (&quot;Huddersfield Examiner&quot; 23 April 2001, review of Mahler concert).
‘Nicholas Cleobury turned what could have been a hairy experience into a convincing one, full of raw energy and glittering colour’
 (&quot;Yorkshire Post&quot;, 22 April 2002, review of Walton’s Belshazzar’s Feast).
The latter concert, featuring Huddersfield Choral Society, was dedicated to the memory of Maurice Wray, orchestral manager of the Phil for some eleven years and who had been the prime mover and shaker in bringing the two organisations together on stage. Sadly, Maurice had died just 2 months before the concert. Further memorable concerts conducted by Nicholas have included February 2005&#x27;s Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot; and Michael Tippett&#x27;s &quot;A Child of Our Time&quot; in November of the same year, as well as the closing concert of the Saddleworth Festival in June 2007.

By autumn of 2002 the Phil was auditioning for a new Principal Conductor, a process which was to take almost two years, but which resulted in the appointment of Natalia Luis-Bassa, a prize-winner in the Maazel-Vilar Conductor&#x27;s Competition of 2002 and the first person in Venezuela to receive the B Mus in orchestral conducting. Natalia’s audition concert (February 2004) included a performance of Elgar’s &quot;Cockaigne&quot; Overture and Elgar has remained at the heart of her continuing relationship with the orchestra. 2007 was the 150th anniversary of the birth of Elgar and the April performance of his second Symphony with the Phil won Natalia the Elgar prize. She followed this up by conducting the first performance of the work in Venezuela with the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra, with their principal conductor Gustavo Dudamel in the audience.

February 2008 saw a packed Town Hall, and heard the voice of Robert Powell as narrator in Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;, which the &quot;Huddersfield Examiner&quot; described as &quot;utterly engaging and absorbing. Here was an opportunity for various sections of the orchestra to shine and, without exception….. they excelled.&quot;

<text>The Huddersfield Singers is based in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England, and is a chamber choir of 30 to 40 members. The choir was formed in 1875 as the &quot;Huddersfield Glee &amp; Madrigal Society&quot; and performs a wide variety of sacred and secular music from all periods of musical history, ranging from the medieval to the present day.

The Huddersfield Singers is renowned for its adventurous and interesting repertoire, and takes pride in performing works by less well-known composers alongside more mainstream pieces. The choir has occasionally commissioned new music, such as for its 125th anniversary concert in July 2000, for which Arthur Butterworth composed &quot;Haworth Moor&quot;. Other composers who have written music for the choir, or dedicated pieces to it, include Gustav Holst (&quot;Wassail Song&quot;, 1932) and John Gardner (&quot;Waltzsongs&quot;, 1996).

The choir&#x27;s character and adventurous repertoire has been shaped primarily (in its modern Huddersfield Singers guise) by its longest-serving conductor, Philip Honnor, who was in charge from 1990 to 2012. Dr Jonathan Brigg took the role during 2013 and was succeeded from the start of the 2014–2015 season by Alexander Douglas. Since the beginning of the 2017–2018 season, the choir&#x27;s conductor has been Daniel Gordon.

The choir is a registered charity (number 507768).

<doc id="1059197" wikidata="Q2359434" url="?curid=1059197" title="Mary Astell">
<text>Mary Astell (12 November 1666 – 11 May 1731) was an English protofeminist writer, philosopher, and rhetorician who advocated for equal educational opportunities for women. Astell is primarily remembered as one of England&#x27;s inaugural advocates for women&#x27;s rights and some commentators consider her to have been &quot;the first English feminist&quot;.

Astell&#x27;s works, particularly &quot;A Serious Proposal to the Ladies&quot; and &quot;Some Reflections Upon Marriage&quot;, argue for the fundamental intellectual equality between men and women. Her philosophical writings are thought to have influenced subsequent generations of educated women, including the literary group known as the Bluestockings, whose discussions of literature, science, and philosophy often centred on issues related to women&#x27;s education and equality. Astell, who never married, formed the majority of her close personal relationships with women. During the early 1700s, she withdrew from public life and dedicated herself to planning and managing a charitable school for girls. Astell viewed herself as self-reliant and took pride in advancing her mission to rescue her sex from oppression.

Despite Astell&#x27;s contribution to the feminist cause, there is a notable tension in the broader body of scholarship when it comes to categorising her as the unequivocal &quot;first English feminist&quot;. This discrepancy arises due to Astell&#x27;s conflicting intellectual commitments. In addition to her belief in women&#x27;s inherent intellectual potential and her thorough exploration of the perils of oppressive husbands, Mary Astell was a staunch High Tory, a conservative pamphleteer, and an advocate for the doctrine of passive obedience. Even during their initial publication, her strongest political views may have seemed outdated and out of touch with the prevailing beliefs of the time. Furthermore, her emphasis on the importance of religion to female friendship and feminist thought has rankled contemporary critics of her work.

== Early life ==

Few records of Mary Astell&#x27;s life have survived. As biographer Ruth Perry explains: &quot;As a woman she had little or no business in the world of commerce, politics, or law. She was born, she died; she owned a small house for some years; she kept a bank account; she helped to open a charity school in Chelsea: these facts the public listings can supply.&quot; Although Perry uncovered letters and manuscript fragments, she notes that if Astell had not written to wealthy aristocrats who could afford to pass down entire estates, very little of her life would have survived.

Astell was born in Newcastle upon Tyne on 12 November 1666, to Peter and Mary (Errington) Astell. Her parents had two other children, William, who died in infancy, and Peter, her younger brother. She was baptised in St John&#x27;s Church in Newcastle. Her family was upper-middle class and lived in Newcastle throughout her early childhood. Her father was a coal merchant, a clerk within the Hostmen of Newcastle upon Tyne and a conservative royalist Anglican. Mary&#x27;s maternal grandfather was also a coal merchant and a member of the Hostmen guild. Due to her family&#x27;s success in the coal business her family had grown to achieve relative affluence. At the time of Mary&#x27;s birth, her family was not part of the gentry. Within a year of Mary&#x27;s birth her family would be elevated in status after an ancestor&#x27;s augmentation. Mary received no formal education, although she did receive an informal education from her uncle Ralph Astell; he was a Cambridge graduate and a former clergyman whose alcoholism had prompted his suspension from the Church of England. Though suspended from the Church, he was affiliated with the Cambridge-based philosophical school that based its teachings around philosophers such as Aristotle, Plato, and Pythagoras. Her father died when she was 12 years old, leaving her without a dowry. With the remainder of the family finances invested in her brother&#x27;s higher education, Mary and her mother moved to live with Mary&#x27;s aunt.

After moving in with her aunt, little is known about Mary Astell&#x27;s life until she was in her early twenties. It is possible that she continued to receive informal education from her uncle, but there is no concrete evidence. It is possible that Mary&#x27;s lack of a dowry and her family&#x27;s financial situation may have limited her opportunities for further education or advancement. It is not known if she had any close friends or if she was involved in any romantic relationships. It is unclear if she was involved in any political or social causes during this time, although her later writings suggest an interest in issues related to women&#x27;s education and equality.

== Career ==

Several years after the death of her aunt in 1684, Astell moved by herself to London, possibly because of the political unrest that took place between 1686-1688 in Newcastle. In London, she became acquainted with a circle of literary and influential women, including Lady Mary Chudleigh, Elizabeth Thomas, Judith Drake, Elizabeth Elstob, and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. These helped develop and publish her work, as did William Sancroft, previously Archbishop of Canterbury. Believing himself bound by his previous oath to James II, he refused to swear allegiance to William III after the 1688 Glorious Revolution and became a Nonjuror. He provided financial support and an introduction to her future publisher; Astell later dedicated a collection of poetry to him.

During this time, it is believed that Astell may have spent some time at a convent in France, where she was exposed to ideas about women&#x27;s education and independence. She was one of the first English women, following Bathsua Makin, to advocate the idea that women were as rational as men, and just as deserving of education. First published anonymously and signed &quot;By a Lover of her Sex&quot; in 1694, her &quot;A Serious Proposal to the Ladies for the Advancement of their True and Greatest Interest&quot; presents a plan for an all-female college where women could pursue a life of the mind. In 1697 she published part 2 to her &quot;A Serious Proposal&quot; &quot;Wherein a Method is offered for the Improvement of their Minds&quot;.

In 1700, Astell published &quot;Some Reflections upon Marriage&quot;. She critiques the philosophical underpinnings of the institution of marriage in 1700s England, warning women of the dangers of a hasty or ill-considered choice. The Duchess of Mazarin is used as an example of &quot;the dangers of an ill Education and unequal Marriage&quot;. Astell argues that education will help women to make better matrimonial choices and meet the challenges of the married state: &quot;She has need of a strong Reason, of a truly Christian and well-temper&#x27;d Spirit, of all the Assistance the best Education can give her, and ought to have some good assurance of her own Firmness and Vertue, who ventures on such a Trial.&quot;

Astell warns that disparity in intelligence, character, and fortune may lead to misery, and recommends that marriage be based on lasting friendship rather than short-lived attraction. A woman should look for &quot;a good Understanding, a Vertuous Mind, and in all other respects let there be as much equality as may be&quot;. Astell expanded on this theme in response to critics in the third edition of &quot;Some Reflections upon Marriage&quot;.

She withdrew from public life in 1709 to become head of a charity school for girls in Chelsea, funded by two wealthy philanthropists, Lady Catherine Jones and Lady Elizabeth Hastings. Backed by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge, Astell designed the school&#x27;s curriculum and it is thought to be the first school in England with an all-women board of governors. When she was 60 years old, in 1726, Astell was invited to live with Lady Catherine Jones, with whom she resided until her death in 1731.

Astell died in London a few months after a mastectomy to remove a cancerous right breast. In her last days, she refused to see any of her acquaintances and stayed in a room with her coffin, thinking only of God; she was buried in the churchyard of Chelsea Church in London.

Astell is remembered for her ability to debate with both men and women, and for her groundbreaking methods of negotiating the position of women in society by engaging in philosophical debate (René Descartes was a particular influence) rather than basing her arguments in historical evidence as had been attempted. Descartes&#x27; theory of dualism, a separate mind and body, allowed Astell to promote the idea that women, as well as men, had the ability to reason, and subsequently, they should not be treated so poorly; &quot;If all Men are born Free, why are all Women born Slaves?&quot;

==Books==

Mary Astell&#x27;s works were published anonymously. Her two best-known books, &quot;A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, for the Advancement of Their True and Greatest Interest&quot; (1694) and &quot;A Serious Proposal, Part II&quot; (1697), outline her plan to establish a new type of institution for women to assist in providing women with both religious and secular education. She suggests extending women&#x27;s career options beyond mother and nun. She felt that uneducated women were concerned with beauty and vanity, and this lack of education was the root of their inferiority to men, not that they were naturally inferior. Astell wanted all women to have the same opportunity as men to spend eternity in heaven with God, and she believed that for this they needed to be educated and to understand their experiences. The &quot;nunnery&quot; style education she proposed would enable women to live in a protected environment, without the influences of the external patriarchal society.

Her proposal was never adopted because critics said it seemed &quot;too Catholic&quot; for the English. Later her ideas about women were satirised in &quot;The Tatler&quot; by the writer Jonathan Swift. While the writer Daniel Defoe admired the first part of Astell&#x27;s proposal, he believed that her recommendations were &quot;impracticable&quot;. Patricia Springborg notes that Defoe&#x27;s own recommendation for an academy for women as detailed in his &quot;An Essay Upon Projects&quot; did not significantly differ from Astell&#x27;s original proposal. Despite this, she was still an intellectual force in London&#x27;s educated classes.

A few years later, Astell published the second part of &quot;A Serious Proposal&quot;, detailing her own vision of women&#x27;s education for courtly ladies. She broke away from the contemporary rhetorical style of the period where orators spoke before an audience for learning, and instead offered a conversational style of teaching &quot;neighbours&quot; the proper way of behaviour. She referred only to the Port-Royal Logic as a source of contemporary influence, though still relied upon classical rhetorical theories as she presented her own original ideas. In her presentation, she offered that rhetoric, as an art, does not require a male education to be master, and listed the means of which a woman could acquire the necessary skills from natural logic, which established Astell as a capable female rhetorician.

In the early 1690s Astell entered into correspondence with John Norris of Bemerton, after reading Norris&#x27;s &quot;Practical Discourses, upon several Divine subjects&quot; (1691). The letters illuminate Astell&#x27;s thoughts on God and theology. Norris thought the letters worthy of publication and had them published with Astell&#x27;s consent as &quot;Letters Concerning the Love of God&quot; (1695). Her name did not appear in the book, but her identity was soon discovered and her rhetorical style was much lauded by contemporaries.

== Philosophy ==

=== Friendship ===
One of Astell&#x27;s notable contributions to 18th-century ideas of female friendship rests on the political exigencies of forming alliances. Jacqueline Broad views Astell&#x27;s bond of friendship as more Aristotelian where alliances are formed for the sake of virtuous reciprocity. However, Nancy Kendrick does not accept Broad&#x27;s viewpoint. She feels Astell&#x27;s &quot;theory of friendship is determinedly anti-Aristotelian.&quot; Although Astell embraced the Aristotelian friendship of moral virtue, Kendrick claims that Astell treated &quot;virtuous friends as those who love one another for who they essentially are&quot; and not just for reciprocity&#x27;s sake. Contrary to Aristotle, Astell contends that authentic virtuous friendship arose from the Divine Nature of God, thus becoming spiritual friendship. Furthermore, Astell, unlike Aristotle, saw this love in friendship extending toward one&#x27;s enemies because Divine Love embraces all of mankind.

=== Education for women ===
Astell believed in the importance of educating women and argued for their intellectual development, primarily in &quot;A Serious Proposal to the Ladies&quot;. She challenged prevailing notions that women were intellectually inferior to men using a form of Cartesian dualism, which holds that the mind and body are two different entities. She argued that even though men and women differ in body, the two innately share the same kind of mind bestowed by God, and thus are equally capable of intelligent thought. Furthermore, she thought that the limited educational opportunities for women at the time curtailed their ability to develop their rational faculties, causing them to be perceived as more ignorant. This ignorance translated into a perception of sin, which Astell thought could be countered if women were educated to be more virtuous. Therefore, she advocated for a comprehensive education that would enable women to participate in society, engage in intellectual discourse, and contribute to the public sphere. Astell thought that a proper education was crucial for women to attain social and intellectual independence, allowing them to break free from the constraints imposed by patriarchal society.

Astell believed that women should be educated in a spiritual, woman-only environment, away from society. She felt that women should receive an education free of male influence because of how corrupt the world under male dominance was. To accomplish these aims, she suggested the establishment of a monastery-like institution where young women could receive an education and older women could retire. Astell held that this education should be composed of subjects traditionally dominated by men, such as philosophy and theology, along with a strong religious component.

===Marriage===

Astell&#x27;s &quot;Some Reflections upon Marriage&quot; emphasises the importance of women&#x27;s education for improving the state of marriage. She explains that if women were better educated, they would choose their partners more wisely and exhibit better behavior. She cites the example of Hortense Mancini, whose separation from her abusive husband led to a questioning of the role of female choice in marriage. Astell asserts that marriage’s current state is far from its original sanctity as a holy institution established by God, because of widespread corruption and immoral behaviour. She encourages women to fortify their virtue and reason through education and to distance themselves from activities such as gambling and flirting. Though Astell&#x27;s view of the roles women and men should adopt in marriage is largely conservative, encouraging women to submit to their husbands&#x27; wills, she affirms women&#x27;s intellectual equality to men and warns women to choose husbands they can respect.

Scholars have suggested that Astell&#x27;s &quot;Reflections&quot; contain a veiled political subtext challenging the Whig theorists of her time to extend the same authority granted to husbands in the domestic sphere to sovereigns in the state. By questioning the acceptance of submission and obedience to authority in the home, but not in the state, Astell presents an ironic challenge to Whig opponents, implying that Whig theorists should practise passive obedience to their political leaders.

Though Astell generally endorses marriage as &quot;the Institution of Heaven&quot; and a &quot;great Blessing&quot; for wives, she recognises that some women might not be inclined toward marriage. Astell herself never married, though she may have been engaged to a clergyman at one point in her life, as her 18th-century biographer George Ballard suggested.

===Religion and politics===

Astell makes jabs at John Locke critiquing &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; and &quot;The Reasonableness of Christianity&quot;, along with other works she regards as deist or Socinian. She attacks his scepticism of the scriptural truth and divinity of Jesus Christ, objecting strongly that Christ is merely an &quot;extraordinary person&quot;, and that there is no difference between the Christian and Islamic belief in God. In sections 2 and 3 of &quot;The Christian Religion&quot;, Astell focused on &quot;Duty to God&quot; and &quot;Duty to Our Neighbour&quot;. Astell presents all humans &quot;are brethren&quot; and sinful pride leads us to treat others as &quot;creatures of a different species&quot;. This thought rests alongside her beliefs in the essential nature of hierarchical distinctions, which she explains by stating that God&#x27;s works &quot;do not necessarily possess the same degree of perfection&quot;.

Some have questioned how Astell could be both a feminist and a High-Church Tory given her disapproval of Locke&#x27;s political views and her opposition to Whig theories of liberty, resistance and tolerance. At first glance, her support for a political party that fights freedom of conscience and other perceived dangers to the Anglican church seems in opposition with her advocacy for women&#x27;s freedom of judgment. Scholars have seen that Astell&#x27;s feminism is not founded on liberal political objectives but rather on intellectual premises. This explains why, at the time, she did not demand complete political equality for women.

Having been exposed in her youth to civil unrest and riots in the streets of Newcastle is probably what helped develop her interest in politics. She had idealised King Charles I and viewed his successors, William and Mary, as &quot;illegitimate&quot; rulers to the throne of England. Her Tory politics and English patriotism led her to reflect that &quot;it is better some innocents should suffer than the majesty of government, and herein the divine authority should be violated.&quot;

According to Astell&#x27;s Anglican political theology, all subjects are required to adhere to the notion of passive obedience, which mandates that they must willingly surrender to political authority.  When they are unable to do so openly, they must submit to the punishment for it. Even if the crown had dictatorial authority, Astell argued that political subjects were never entitled to oppose the monarch. Locke criticised Astell&#x27;s views on natural law and the right of resistance in his First Treatise, published in 1690.

Astell maintains that while Locke considers self-preservation to be a fundamental right, it only involves preserving the immortal soul. Therefore, humans are only allowed to act in ways that will ensure the safety of their souls from judgment, in accordance with natural law.

==Legacy==

Astell&#x27;s ideas about women in education laid the foundation for later feminist movements, as they challenged social norms and paved the way for improved educational opportunities for women. Her work continues to inspire contemporary debates on gender equality and the importance of education in women&#x27;s empowerment. Mary Astell&#x27;s groundbreaking reflections on women&#x27;s education continue to be a testament to her enduring legacy as a feminist philosopher and advocate for women&#x27;s rights.

Astell had a significant personal library which was an unusual example of a late 17th- and early 18th-century book collection owned by a woman who was herself a published author. Her books can be recognised by the inscription of her name on the title page and her many annotations. In 2021 a collection of 47 of Astell&#x27;s books and pamphlets, many of which have her annotations, were identified in the Old Library at Magdalene College, Cambridge by Catherine Sutherland, the Deputy Librarian. These marginalia reveal, for the first time, the degree to which she was involved with the natural philosophy literature and discourse of her time. Other holdings are at the British Library and the Northamptonshire Record Office.

The Mary Astell Academy (formerly Linhope PRU) in Linhope Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, is named after her. There is also a Mary-Astell-Straße in Bremen, Germany.

<doc id="1059205" wikidata="Q125990" url="?curid=1059205" title="Kham">
<text>Kham (; ) is one of the three traditional Tibetan regions, the others being Domey also known as Amdo in the northeast, and Ü-Tsang in central Tibet. The official name of this Tibetan region/province is Dotoe (). The original residents of Kham are called Khampas (), and were governed locally by chieftains and monasteries. Kham covers a land area distributed in multiple province-level administrative divisions in present-day China, most of it in Tibet Autonomous Region and Sichuan, with smaller portions located within Qinghai and Yunnan.

Densely forested with grass plains, its convergence of six valleys and four rivers supported independent Kham polities of Tibetan warrior kingdoms together with Tibetan Buddhist monastic centers. The early trading route between Central Tibet and China traveled through Kham, and Kham is said to be the inspiration for Shangri-La in James Hilton&#x27;s novel.

Settled as Tibet&#x27;s eastern frontier in the 7th century, King Songtsen Gampo built temples along its eastern border. In 1939, an eastern area of Kham was officially established as Xikang Province of China.

==Geography==

Kham has a rugged terrain characterized by mountain ridges and gorges running from northwest to southeast, and collectively known as the Hengduan Mountains. Numerous rivers, including the Mekong, Yangtze, Yalong River, and the Salween River flow through Kham.

Under the modern administrative division of China, Kham includes a total of 50 contemporary counties, which have been incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan (16 counties), Yunnan (three counties), and Qinghai (6 counties) as well as the eastern portion of the Tibet Autonomous Region (25 counties).

==Ethnic groups==

The people of Kham, the Khampas, are reputed warriors renowned for their marksmanship and horsemanship. References state many Khampas in the Hor States include mention of their Mongolian heritage.

There are significant differences in traditions and beliefs—even physical appearance—between the peoples of Kham and Lhasa. Most of Kham&#x27;s residents speak Khams Tibetan while at least one-third of the residents are speakers of Qiangic languages, a family of twelve distinct but interrelated languages that are not closely related to Khams Tibetan.

As a frontier region, Kham integrated and &quot;Tibetanized&quot; early Mongolian and Chinese populations. After Güshri Khan&#x27;s invasion of Kham in 1639, Mongolian people and Amdo&#x27;s tribal people resettled to the region.

The Khampas are known for their great height. Khampa males are on average .

==History==
=== 7th - 10th centuries ===
The Pugyal Dynasty (or Yarlung) of the Tibetan Empire sent troops east from Lhasa to the reaches of the Tibetan Plateau, where they interacted with local cultures and languages to establish eastern Tibet, or Do Kham (&#x27;Do&#x27;, the convergence of rivers and valleys; &#x27;Kham&#x27;, frontier). Kham was traditionally referred to as &quot;Chushi Gangdruk&quot;, i.e. &#x27;The Four Rivers and Six Ranges&#x27; and &#x27;The Four Great Valleys&#x27;. Responsible for introducing Buddhism to Tibet, King Songtsen Gampo (reign 629–649) built twelve &#x27;border-taming&#x27; temples in Kham, and his 4th wife Wencheng Gongzhu is credited with commissioning Buddhist structures while traveling through Kham in 640–641, from her home in China to Central Tibet.

During the Imperial era, both Nyingma school and Bon monasteries were located, especially in Nyarong Valley, among pastoral and agricultural-based polities ruled by local chieftains, polities which included merchant as well as Mongol and Chinese populations. Notable Tibetan Buddhist art from this era, dating from 804 or 816, includes carved stone statues of Buddha Vairocana.

Following a power struggle in the mid-9th century, Tibet separated into independent kingdoms.

=== 13th to 17th centuries ===
Kham was not controlled by a single king and remained a patchwork of kingdoms, tribes, and chiefdoms whose bases of authority were constantly shifting. A dual system of secular and Buddhist polities continued. In 1270, the Sakya school&#x27;s lama Tonstul, a student of Sakya Pandita, established a monastery in Kham while both Kagyu and Sakya monasteries were located in the northern plains, including Gonjo and Lingtsang, which accompanied the earlier Nyingma and Bon monasteries of Kham.

In 1639, Güshri Khan, a supporter of the Dalai Lama, invaded with Mongolian troops and defeated the powerful King of Beri in Kham. In 1655, Ngawang Phuntsok, a student of the Dalai Lama, founded Gonsar Monastery, the first of the 13 Gelug monasteries in the Hor States, with the support of the kingdom of Degé. By 1677, many Gelug monasteries had been built when the 5th Dalai Lama finalized Kham&#x27;s Sino-Tibetan border location between China and a Tibet then reunified in the Khoshut Khanate, resulting in Kham being ascribed to Tibet&#x27;s authority.

The major independent polities included the Chakla, Degé, the Lingtsang, Nangchen and the Lhatok. Other important polities included Chamdo, Batang, Mili, and the Hor States.

=== 18th century ===
In 1717, the Mongol Dzungar Khanate invaded Tibet and other Asian regions. The Qing Chinese army likewise invaded and defeated the Dzungars. This led to the redrawing of the Sino-Tibetan boundary of 1677, which had followed the edge of the Tibetan Plateau. The frontier line changed in either 1725 or 1726 to follow the Dri River (Jinsha River, Upper Yangtze), while the Kham region on the eastern bank became Qing domain. There, hereditary chieftains were bestowed honorific titles of &quot;tusi&quot;, and obligated to fight alongside the Qing army in other Kham battles between chieftains.

Earlier in 1724, an area of Qinghai (Kokonor) was established within Do Kham. The eastern Kham Qing domain was later incorporated into neighboring Chinese provinces.

=== 19th century ===

In 1837, a minor chieftain Gompo Namgyal, of Nyarong in eastern Kham, began expanding his control regionally and launched offensives against the Hor States, Litang, Degé, the Chakla and Batang, becoming the paramount power in the region. China sent troops in against Namgyal which were defeated in 1849, and additional troops were not dispatched. Chinese military posts were present along the trading route, but &quot;did not have any authority over the native chiefs&quot;. By 1862, Namgyal blocked trade routes from China to Central Tibet, and sent troops into China.

Local chieftains had appealed to both the Lhasa and the Qing Manchu governments for help against Namgyal. The Tibetan authorities sent an army in 1863, and defeated Namgyal then killed him at his Nyarong fort by 1865. Central Tibet reasserted its authority over the northern parts of Kham and established the Office of the Tibetan High Commissioner to govern. Tibet also reclaimed Nyarong, Degé and the Hor States north of Nyarong. China recalled their forces. It appears to have been accepted by the Manchu Tongzhi Emperor.

Then in 1896, the Qing Governor of Sichuan attempted to gain control of Nyarong valley during a military attack. After his defeat, the Qing agreed to the withdrawal of Chinese forces and the &quot;territory was returned to the direct rule of Lhasa&quot;.

=== Early 20th century ===

From 1904 to 1911, China decided to reassert its control over the previously re-ceded section of Kham, and to push further into the region soon after the invasion of Tibet by the British army under Francis Younghusband in 1904. The British invasion alarmed the Qing rulers in China, and they sent Fengquan (鳳全) to Kham to initiate land reforms and reduce the numbers of monks. An anti-foreigner and anti-Qing uprising in Batang led to Fengquan&#x27;s death, while Chinese fields were burned.

The Qing then undertook punitive campaigns in Kham under Manchu army commander Zhao Erfeng, also the Governor of Xining, where he earned the nickname of &quot;the Butcher of Kham&quot;. In 1905 or 1908 Zhao began executing monks and destroying many monasteries in Kham and Amdo, implementing an early &quot;sinicization&quot; of the region:

After the fall of the Qing Dynasty, Zhao was stripped of his post and executed by the revolutionary commander Yin Changheng.

A year before the collapse of the Qing, the Beijing-appointed &quot;amban&quot; Zhong Ying invaded Lhasa with the Chinese army in February 1910 in order to gain control of Tibet and establish direct Chinese rule.
The 13th Dalai Lama escaped to British India, and returned before China surrendered via a letter from the &quot;amban&quot; to the Dalai Lama in the summer of 1912. On 13 February 1913, the Dalai Lama declared Tibet an independent nation, and announced the end of the historic &quot;priest-patron&quot; relationship between Tibet and China. The &quot;amban&quot; and Chinese army were expelled, while other Chinese populations were given three years to depart.

By late 1913, Kham and Amdo remained largely occupied by China. Tibet proposed re-establishing the border between Tibet and China at the Dri River during the Simla Conference with Britain and China, while Britain countered with another proposal which was initialed but not ratified.

In 1917, the Tibetan army defeated China in battles at Chamdo, west of the Dri River, which were halted after Britain refused to sell Tibet additional armements.

=== Tibetan independence and Republic of China ===

The official position of the British Government was it would not intervene between China and Tibet and would only recognize the &quot;de facto&quot; government of China within Tibet at this time. In his history of Tibet, Bell wrote that &quot;the Tibetans were abandoned to Chinese aggression, an aggression for which the British Military Expedition to Lhasa and subsequent retreat [and consequent power vacuum within Tibet] were primarily responsible&quot;.

In 1932, an agreement signed between Chinese warlord Liu Wenhui and Tibetan forces formalized the partition of Kham into two regions: Eastern Kham, which was administered by Chinese forces, and Western Kham, which was administered by Tibet. Eastern Kham subsequently became the actual area of control of China&#x27;s Xikang province. The border between eastern and western Kham is the Upper Yangtze – &quot;Dri Chu&quot; in Tibetan and &quot;Jinsha Jiang&quot; respectively, in Chinese.

Tenpay Gyaltsan, a Khampa who was 5 years old, was selected as the fifth Jamyang Hutuktu in 1921.

The Kham Pandatsang family led the 1934 Khamba rebellion against the Tibetan government in Lhasa. The Kuomintang reached out to the Khampas, whose relationship with the Dalai Lama&#x27;s government in Lhasa were deteriorating badly. The Khampa revolutionary leader Pandatsang Rapga founded the Tibet Improvement Party to overthrow the Tibetan government and establish a Tibetan Republic as part of China. In addition to using the Khampa&#x27;s against the Tibetan Government in Lhasa, the Chinese Kuomintang also used them against the Communists during the Chinese Civil War.

The Kuomintang formulated a plan where three Khampa divisions would be assisted by the Panchen Lama to oppose the Communists.

Kuomintang intelligence reported that some Tibetan tusi chiefs and the Khampa Su Yonghe controlled 80,000 troops in Sichuan, Qinghai, and Tibet. They hoped to use them against the Communist army.

The Chinese Kuomintang (Nationalists) also enlisted Khampas to join their military.

The Chinese Kuomintang also sought the Khampas help in defending Sichuan from Japan during World War 2, since the temporary capital was located there. A Khampa member of the Mongolian Tibetan Academy was Han Jiaxiang.

300 &quot;Khampa bandits&quot; were enlisted into the Kuomintang Consolatory Commission military in Sichuan, where they were part of the effort of the central government of China to penetrated and destabilize the local Han warlords such as Liu Wenhui. The Chinese government sought to exercise full control over frontier areas against the warlords. The Consoltary Commission forces were used to battle the Communist Red Army but were defeated when their religious leader was captured by Communist forces.

The Republic of China government also used Khampa traders to operate secret transports between different places.

Kesang Tsering was sent by the Chinese to Batang to take control of Xikang, where he formed a local government. He was spread there for the purpose of propagating the Three People&#x27;s Principle to the Khampa.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===
In 1950, following the defeat of the Kuomintang rulers of China by communist forces in the Chinese Civil War, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army invaded western Kham. Western Kham was then set up as a separate Qamdo Territory, then merged into Tibet Autonomous Region in 1965. Meanwhile, Xikang, comprising eastern Kham, was merged into Sichuan in 1955. The border between Sichuan and Tibet Autonomous Region has remained at the Yangtze River.

<doc id="1059234" wikidata="Q5294239" url="?curid=1059234" title="Donald Deacon">
<text>Donald MacKay Deacon (April 24, 1920 – September 16, 2003) was a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1967 to 1975 who represented the riding of York Centre.

==Background==
Deacon was born and raised in a family of ten children in Toronto, Ontario and attended the University of Toronto Schools. In 1942, he volunteered to serve in the 3rd Medium Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery during World War II, rising to the rank of captain. Deacon, a Forward Observation Officer, travelled with front line infantry in order to direct artillery fire via radio transmission. In later years, he often commented at how accurately George G. Blackburn had captured the role of a FOO in his book &quot;The Guns of Normandy&quot;.

Deacon was mentioned in dispatches as his Battery of Nova Scotian gunners fought its way across France, Belgium, the Netherlands and into Germany. He was awarded the Military Cross for risking his life to save soldiers under fire when his radio failed. King George VI was to present Deacon with the Military Cross. After six months helping to re-build post-war life in Holland, instead of heading to England, Deacon chose to accept passage on the first ship home to Canada. His military service ended safely as he walked up to his parents&#x27; home on Christmas morning 1945.

Following the war, Deacon married Florence Campbell, sister of his best friend John Campbell. They moved to Deacon&#x27;s family farm outside of Unionville, Ontario where they raised a family of six (Campbell, David, Martha, Douglas, Richard and Colin Deacon). He was one of the founders of Markham Stouffville Hospital and also served as president of the Canadian Club of Toronto. Deacon spent most of his working career in business in the financial sector, serving as chair of F.H. Deacon Hodgson Ltd.

==Politics==
Deacon was first elected to serve on the town council of Markham, Ontario as the deputy reeve. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) in the 1967 provincial election, and re-elected in the 1971 election, serving the Toronto area riding of York Centre until he resigned from the legislature in March 1975.

In 1973, Deacon ran for the Ontario Liberal leadership when Robert Nixon indicated he was stepping aside. Nixon changed his mind, and was re-elected leader with Deacon finishing in third place behind Nixon and Norman Cafik. When Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau appointed his friend and political colleague Barney Danson as Canada&#x27;s Minister of Defence in 1976, Deacon worked with Danson and Jacques Hébert to create Katimavik, a national service program designed to enable unemployed youth to help others and themselves at the same time.

==Later life==
Deacon moved to Prince Edward Island in 1981, where he was the founder and chair of Atlantic Canada&#x27;s first venture capital fund, Atlantic Ventures Trust. He also continued his passion as an active volunteer, becoming president of the PEI Red Cross, chair of the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council, a board member of Mount Allison University (the alma mater of his maternal grandfather, The Hon. Henry Emmerson), a director of the SmartRisk Foundation and National Commissioner of Scouts Canada. Deacon was deeply honoured when his service to Scouts Canada was recognized with his being presented with the Silver Wolf Award by Queen Elizabeth II at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.

Deacon&#x27;s greatest passion grew from CN Railway&#x27;s decision to close the Prince Edward Island Railway in July 1989. Florence and Donald loved going on walking and cycling vacations around the world, and had long felt that the closure would hold great tourism and community development potential. A standing-room only community meeting on August 3, 1989, led to the creation of Rail-to-Trails PEI with its mission being to do what was necessary to convert the soon to be abandoned rail lines into a provincial trail system. Deacon became the group&#x27;s founding chairman.

On September 18, 1992, at a Canada 125 board meeting held in Summerside PEI, a resolution was passed to support the creation of the Trans Canada Trail as the legacy project for Canada&#x27;s 125th anniversary. Deacon became an early and active member of the Trans Canada Trail board of directors, focusing much of his attention on the all-important fundraising efforts. To this end, Deacon&#x27;s signature can be found on the certificates issued to Canadians who donated $35.00 to &quot;buy a metre&quot; of the Trail, one of the Trail&#x27;s earliest fundraising efforts. Through the 1990s, corporations and wealthy families across the country could count on a visit from Deacon and others, encouraging them to &quot;buy a kilometre&quot; of the Trail. In 2000, then in their 80s, Florence and Donald proudly completed their Millennium Project: to bike 200 km on the Trail in each of Canada&#x27;s provinces and territories (except Nunavut), making it as far north as Tuktoyaktuk.

In 1987, Deacon was invested as a Member of the Order of Canada. In 2003, he was presented with the Order of Prince Edward Island and was promoted to Officer of the Order of Canada.

Exactly one week prior to his death in September 2003, Deacon was interviewed by Shelagh Rogers on CBC Radio&#x27;s Sounds Like Canada. It was her first interview in a series about Order of Canada recipients. This moving conversation, which Rogers often replayed as one of her favorites, included Deacon recounting a defining moment with a close friend in the final hours of World War II. Deacon and his friend were sitting on top of their Scout cars, waiting as the infantry cleared out a machine gun nest along the road ahead. They asked one another how the horrible waste of life that they had just survived could be prevented in future. The two men agreed that all they could do was to go home, raise a family of caring individuals, contribute to the lives of others in their communities, and encourage everyone they met to travel the world so they could experience and gain respect for other cultures and people. Their conversation ended as they were given the all clear. His friend started his Scout car, proceeded down the road ahead of Deacon and was killed instantly as his vehicle passed over an anti-tank mine.

The war ended two days later. Deacon carried that conversation and commitment with him throughout his life.

Deacon died of leukemia at a hospital in Charlottetown in September 2003. He was 83.

<doc id="1059238" wikidata="Q788256" url="?curid=1059238" title="Switching Channels">
<text>Switching Channels is a 1988 American comedy film remake of the 1928 play &quot;The Front Page&quot;, the 1931 film of the same name, and the 1940 film &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;. It stars Kathleen Turner as Christy Colleran, Burt Reynolds as John L. Sullivan IV, Christopher Reeve as Blaine Bingham, Ned Beatty as Roy Ridnitz, Henry Gibson as Ike Roscoe, and George Newbern as Sigenthaler. The film was notorious for its harsh infighting between Reynolds and Turner during filming. The film was a box office failure and received mixed reviews from critics.

It is available on DVD in Regions 2 and 4. It is also available as a burn-on-demand DVD-R in Region 1.

==Plot==
John L. &quot;Sully&quot; Sullivan, IV, is the news director of Satellite News Network (SNN), a Chicago-based TV cable news station. Christy Colleran, his best reporter and ex-wife, goes on vacation, where she falls in love with Blaine Bingham, the owner of a sporting goods company. Christy returns to Chicago with Blaine and meets with Sully, who orders her to attend the execution of convicted murderer Ike Roscoe. Christy announces she is quitting the TV station and marrying Blaine the day after tomorrow in New York City. Not wanting to let Christy leave him, Sully orders his junior reporter Siegenthaler to buy up all available transportation tickets out of town.

During lunch with Christy and Blaine, Sully explains that Roscoe is in prison for killing his son&#x27;s drug dealer, not realizing that the dealer was an undercover cop. The execution has become a political issue, related to the Democratic primary contest between the Governor and Roy Ridnitz, the State&#x27;s District Attorney.

Blaine manages to purchase some train tickets to New York. Sully, who has discovered Blaine is afraid of heights, tells Siegenthaler to lure Blaine to a skyscraper. After getting on the glass elevator with Siegenthaler, Blaine has a crippling anxiety attack as the elevator rises and presses on the emergency stop button, trapping both of them there. After the interview with Roscoe, Christy rushes to the building and saves the two men.

The Governor is inundated with calls from citizens asking him to pardon Ike Roscoe. He decides to issue a pardon during the 11:00 pm news. Ridnitz orders the execution moved up to 10:00 pm and invites the media to televise it live. As Ike is strapped into the chair, a power surge occurs and he escapes.

Christy sees Ike escaping while riding in a limousine with Blaine on her way out of town. She gets out and tells Blaine she will meet him at the train station. After catching up to Ike, Christy tells him to go to the second floor courthouse press room. Christy telephones Sully from the press room and tells him she found Ike. After she hangs up, Ike hides inside the press room photo copier as other reporters arrive. Ridnitz appears with armed police and announces that Ike was seen on the third floor. After a series of comic escapades, Christy stalls Ridnitz long enough for Ike&#x27;s pardon to come through. Christy turns on a news camera and tricks Ridnitz into confessing that he wanted Ike executed in order to win the election. Sully hands the tape over to Siegenthaler and tells him to run the story.

Blaine graciously steps out of Christy&#x27;s life, saying that her true loves are the news and Sully. Sully and Christy go to Hawaii for their second honeymoon.

==Cast==
* Kathleen Turner as Christy Colleran
* Burt Reynolds as John L. &quot;Sully&quot; Sullivan IV
* Christopher Reeve as Blaine Bingham
* Ned Beatty as Roy Ridnitz
* Henry Gibson as Ike Roscoe
* George Newbern as Siegenthaler
* Arlene Mazerolle as Hotel Recepitionist

Filmed primarily in Canada with a Canadian director (Ted Kotcheff), &quot;Switching Channels&quot; features many popular Canadian character actors in supporting roles: Al Waxman as Berger, the station manager, Ken James as Warden Terwilliger, Barry Flatman and Anthony Sherwood as television reporters Zaks and Carvalho, Joe Silver as newswriter Mordsini, Tony Rosato, Jackie Richardson, Philip Akin, Laura Robinson, Fiona Reid and Jack Duffy. It also co-stars Charles Kimbrough as the hapless Governor.

==Production==
The male lead was meant to be played by Michael Caine but he was delayed filming &quot;&quot;. Burt Reynolds was cast instead. Reynolds recalled:
I wasn&#x27;t doing anything other than sitting around mulling over the lint in my belly button... I&#x27;ve always been a great fan of Ted Kotcheff - I really liked &quot;North Dallas Forty&quot; - and I loved the period of films, the thirties and the forties, &quot;The Front Page&quot; comes out of. I hope Cary Grant, whom I knew and admired, won&#x27;t be whirling in his grave over what we&#x27;ve done. But we&#x27;re keeping it fast and talky: some scenes are eight pages of dialogue.

===Turner-Reynolds Feuding===
Kathleen Turner and Burt Reynolds had a very strained working relationship on set, and both have commented negatively on one another in years since.

In 2018, Kathleen Turner said the following of her experience working with Burt Reynolds on &quot;Switching Channels&quot;: 

In March 2018, when he was asked by Andy Cohen who the most overrated actor of the 1970s and 1980s was, Reynolds cited Turner.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot; gave &quot;Switching Channels&quot; mixed results: Ebert was positive about the film and liked how the film did overall; however, Siskel expressed strong disappointment in the film and gave &quot;Switching Channels&quot; a thumbs down. Rotten Tomatoes currently lists &quot;Switching Channels&quot; with a 60% rating based on 15 reviews.

Reeve, who played against type as the hapless fiancé, later expressed regret in making the film, believing he &quot;made a fool of himself&quot; and that he had taken the project as a distraction from depression following a breakup. He also reportedly had to act as &quot;referee&quot;, as costars Turner and Reynolds feuded with each other during filming. According to his autobiography &quot;Still Me&quot;, one of the main reasons he took the role was because Michael Caine was originally lined up to play Sullivan, and he had enjoyed working with Caine six years earlier in &quot;Deathtrap&quot;. Another scene Reeve was in disfavor of was his character suffering acrophobia by showing fear when in a scenic glass elevator, a likely spoof of Reeve&#x27;s best known role as Superman.

The film was nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards: Burt Reynolds was nominated for Worst Actor and Christopher Reeve for Worst Supporting Actor. However, they respectively &quot;lost&quot; to Sylvester Stallone for &quot;Rambo III&quot; and Dan Aykroyd for &quot;Caddyshack II&quot;.

<text>The first USS &quot;Radford&quot; (DD–120) was a in the United States Navy during World War I, later reclassified AG-22. She was named for William Radford.

==History==
&quot;Radford&quot; was launched on 5 April 1918 by Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Company, Newport News, Virginia, sponsored by Ms. Mary Lovell Radford. The destroyer was commissioned on 30 September 1918 at Norfolk Navy Yard, Lieutenant Commander Arthur S. Carpender in command.

Assigned to the Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Radford&quot; departed Norfolk on 12 October on a shakedown cruise to Melville, Rhode Island. She returned to Hampton Roads on 21 October to join the escort force for the Newport News section of Troop Convoy 76 bound for New York City and European waters.

&quot;Radford&quot; subsequently operated on the U.S. east coast into 1919, sailing southward to Cuba on 14 January 1919. While based at Guantanamo Bay, she also cruised to Guacanayabo Bay and Santiago, Cuba, before returning north on 13 March. &quot;Radford&quot; operated from Hampton Roads with the Atlantic Fleet from March until July 1919.

&quot;Radford&quot; was reassigned to the Pacific Fleet in July 1919 and cleared Hampton Roads on 19 July for Balboa, Canal Zone, and San Diego. Upon her arrival at San Diego on 7 August, she joined the Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet. &quot;Radford&quot; operated from Mare Island Navy Yard, San Diego, and San Pedro into 1922, taking part in training exercises and squadron maneuvers as a unit of Division 12, Squadron 10, Destroyer Flotilla 4. She called at Seattle, Tacoma, and Bellingham, Washington in September 1919, and at Portland, Oregon, in December 1920. Designated DD-120 in July 1920, &quot;Radford&quot; decommissioned on 9 June 1922 and remained in reserve at San Diego for almost 15 years.

&quot;Radford&quot; was reclassified AG-22 on 16 April 1932 following the decision to convert her to a mobile target vessel. Conversion work was never undertaken and &quot;Radford&quot; reverted to DD-120 on 27 June. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 19 May 1936, &quot;Radford&quot; was sunk on 5 August 1936 in accordance with the provisions of the London Treaty for the limitation and reduction of naval armament.

<text>Stefanie Sun Yanzi (born Sng Ee Tze on 23 July 1978) is a Singaporean singer and songwriter. In 2000, she released her debut album, &quot;Yan Zi&quot;, which won her a Golden Melody Award for Best New Artist. In 2004, she released her eighth studio album, &quot;Stefanie&quot;, which won her another Golden Melody Award for Best Mandarin Female Singer. Having sold more than 30 million records, she achieved popularity in Greater China, recognized more among the Chinese-speaking world.

==Early life and education==
Sun was born in Singapore on 23 July 1978. She attended Nanyang Primary School, St. Margaret&#x27;s Secondary School, Raffles Girls&#x27; School, Saint Andrew&#x27;s Junior College, and Nanyang Technological University, where she obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree of Marketing in 2000. 

== Singing career ==
===Early years and 2000s===
During university, Sun wrote her first song titled &quot;Someone&quot;, which later appeared on her 2002 album, &quot;Start&quot;. She attended LWS School of Music, and her vocal talent was discovered by her mentor Paul Lee, who later introduced her to Samuel Chou, the chairman of Warner Music Taiwan at the time.

In 2002, Hong Kong–based Yazhou Zhoukan, published a 15-page article on the &quot;Stefanie Sun phenomenon&quot;, citing the impact of her music all throughout Asia.

Sun was selected to sing the English and Mandarin versions of the Singapore National Day Parade theme songs in 2002 – &quot;We Will Get There&quot; (一起走到) and in 2003 – &quot;One United People&quot; (全心全意).

In 2006, National Parks Board of Singapore named an orchid, &quot;Dendrobium Stefanie Sun&quot;, after her. Sun also has a wax figure of herself at the Madame Tussauds Singapore wax museum which portrays her signature look during her 2014 Kepler World Tour. The wax figure took around four months to make, costing 300,000 Singaporean dollars.

===2010s===
Stefanie Sun revealed that her proudest moments as a singer was when she sang Kwa Geok Choo’s favorite song. Kwa was the wife of Singapore&#x27;s former prime minister. She also sang Lee Kuan Yew’s favorite, entitled &quot;Que Sera Sera&quot;, at the Business China Awards in 2011, not long after her demise. The song had moved Mr Lee, a person whom Sun had the highest respect for, to tears.

===2020s===
In early January 2020, she collaborated with Taiwanese band, Mayday, to release the new version of their 2000 hit &quot;Tenderness&quot;.

On 27 May 2022, more than 240 million people watched Sun performed in a one hour virtual concert streamed on Douyin.

== Personal life ==
In May 2011, Sun married Nadim van der Ros, who is of a Eurasian Indonesian descent. He is the founder of Be An Idea, a part of The Good Bean Consultancy. They had secretly registered their marriage in March 2011. In October 2012, Sun gave birth to her son, followed by a daughter in July 2018.

<doc id="1059253" wikidata="Q782322" url="?curid=1059253" title="Venus and Mars (Wings album)">
<text>Venus and Mars is the fourth studio album by the British–American rock band Wings. Released in May 1975 as the follow-up to &quot;Band on the Run&quot;, &quot;Venus and Mars&quot; continued Wings&#x27; run of commercial success and provided a springboard for a year-long worldwide tour. The album was Paul McCartney&#x27;s first post-Beatles album to be released worldwide by Capitol Records rather than Apple.

After recording &quot;Band on the Run&quot; as a three-piece with wife Linda McCartney and guitarist Denny Laine, McCartney recruited guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Geoff Britton to the band in 1974. Recording sessions for the album took place in London, New Orleans and Los Angeles in November 1974 and early 1975. During the sessions, personal tensions caused Britton to quit after six months, forcing the band to recruit American drummer Joe English to finish the album.

Preceded by the single &quot;Listen to What the Man Said&quot;, &quot;Venus and Mars&quot; peaked at number 1 in the US, the UK and other countries around the world. It also received mostly favourable reviews from music critics but was ultimately considered inferior to its predecessor. The album was reissued with bonus tracks in 1987 on CD and in 1993 as part of &quot;The Paul McCartney Collection&quot;. It was remastered in 2014 and released as a deluxe edition with bonus tracks and unreleased material.

== Background and recording ==
After recording &quot;Band on the Run&quot; (1973) as a three-piece with wife Linda and guitarist Denny Laine, McCartney added Jimmy McCulloch on lead guitar and Geoff Britton on drums to the Wings line-up in 1974. Having written several new songs for the next album, McCartney decided to record the album in New Orleans, and Wings headed there in January 1975.

Before leaving for New Orleans, the group recorded three songs at Abbey Road Studios in London in November 1974: &quot;Letting Go&quot;, &quot;Love In Song&quot; and &quot;Medicine Jar&quot;, all overdubbed later at Sea-Saint Studios in New Orleans alongside the recording of new material. Sea-Saint co-owner Allen Toussaint would play piano on the track &quot;Rock Show&quot;.

As soon as the sessions began, the personality clash that had been evident between McCulloch and Britton during Wings&#x27; 1974 sessions in Nashville became more pronounced, and Britton – after a six-month tenure – quit Wings, having played on only three of the new songs. A replacement, American Joe English, was quickly auditioned and hired to finish the album.

The sessions proved to be productive, not only resulting in a finished album, but also several additional songs, including two future McCartney B-sides, &quot;Lunch Box/Odd Sox&quot; and &quot;My Carnival&quot;. McCartney also decided to link the album&#x27;s songs together much like the Beatles had on &quot;Abbey Road&quot; to give &quot;Venus and Mars&quot; a more continuous feel.

John Lennon, often in a nostalgic mood during his &quot;lost weekend&quot; period, had told his then-girlfriend May Pang that they would visit the McCartneys during the recording sessions for &quot;Venus and Mars&quot;, and considered writing with Paul again. Lennon&#x27;s planned visit never happened, however, due to his subsequent reunion with Yoko Ono.

Wings&#x27; interpretation of the theme to &quot;Crossroads&quot;, a British soap opera, was sometimes used to end the television programme in place of the regular theme tune, usually when there was a cliffhanger ending with a hint of sadness involved.

== Release ==
The album cover, which Paul summed up as &quot;a package that would be nice to get, and also something recognizable&quot; was photographed by Linda, depicting two billiard balls in a black background, which are yellow and red to fit the colours of the planets Venus and Mars. Interior photographs of Wings were shot in the Mojave Desert to capture a group photograph in an outerworldly location. Hipgnosis did the art design, incorporating billiard balls and cues in the lettering and illustrations by George Hardie; in return, McCartney would later lend a 16-track tape recorder to Hipgnosis member Peter Christopherson&#x27;s band Throbbing Gristle to record their 1979 album &quot;20 Jazz Funk Greats&quot;.

Preceded by the US #1 single &quot;Listen to What the Man Said&quot;, &quot;Venus and Mars&quot; was released two weeks later, on 30 May. It received generally favourable reviews and strong sales. The album reached number 1 in the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries around the world and sold four million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sexton/ClassicRock&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction, though mainly positive, was less so than what had greeted &quot;Band on the Run&quot; a year earlier.

Two additional singles, &quot;Letting Go&quot; and &quot;Venus and Mars/Rock Show&quot;, were released. Although the latter almost reached the US top ten, it did not chart at all in the UK.

In September, Wings began what would be their year-long Wings Over the World tour in the UK, with concerts in Australia, Europe, the US and Canada to follow. Songs from &quot;Venus and Mars&quot; featured heavily in the concert setlist.

The album was first issued on compact disc by Columbia Records in 1984, although early pressings were pressed in Japan by CSR Compact Disc, which was etched in the inner ring. In 1993, &quot;Venus and Mars&quot; was remastered and reissued on CD as part of &quot;The Paul McCartney Collection&quot; series with &quot;Zoo Gang&quot; (a UK television theme that was the UK B-side of &quot;Band on the Run&quot; in 1974), &quot;Lunch Box/Odd Sox&quot; (B-side of &quot;Coming Up&quot; in 1980) and &quot;My Carnival&quot; (&quot;Spies Like Us&quot;&#x27; B-side in 1985) as bonus tracks. In 2007, the album was reissued in digital form on iTunes with the same bonus tracks, plus the extended &quot;party mix&quot; of &quot;My Carnival&quot;; however, this version has since been replaced by the 2014 reissue.

In 2014 the album was re-issued by Hear Music/Concord Music Group as part of the fifth set of releases, alongside &quot;Wings at the Speed of Sound&quot;, in the &quot;Paul McCartney Archive Collection&quot;. It was released in multiple formats. The reissue was accompanied by the Record Store Day exclusive edition of the &quot;Letting Go&quot; single.

The album was also originally released in 4-channel quadraphonic sound. In 1996 the quadraphonic version of the album was issued on compact disc in the DTS 5.1 Music Disc format.

The album will be reissued on half-speed mastering to celebrate it&#x27;s 50th anniversary on 21 March 2025.

<text>The Ford MA Concept concept car was a 2002 minimalist design exercise drawn by Jose Paris and championed by Ford&#x27;s VP of design J. Mays. It was exhibited as an art object in museums as well as a traditional concept car in auto shows. It received an IDSA Silver Industrial Design Excellence Award in 2003.

The MA displayed many unusual automotive practices. It had the shape of a low slung two seat roadster with no top, but it was powered by an electric motor. The design was flexible enough, though, to accommodate a small internal combustion engine.

Very few of the parts were painted and there were none of the usual hydraulic fluids or industrial adhesives common in most cars, making it 96% recyclable.

It was designed to be assembled and disassembled easily with a minimal amount of equipment. There were no welds holding it together: Instead, its 500 or so pieces of bamboo, aluminum and carbon fibre were held together with 364 titanium bolts. The total weight was said to be .

Some automotive columnists have presented the Ford MA as the forerunner to a small series kit car, much like the Lotus Seven. Others have called it an IKEA-mobile.

<text>Lawrence Batley OBE (15 February 1911 – 27 August 2002) was an entrepreneur and philanthropist who was born in the town of Huddersfield, in the English county of Yorkshire. He pioneered the wholesale cash and carry business in UK, and supported local endeavours in arts, education and sports.

Leaving school at the age of 14, Batley worked in a solicitor’s office, the insurance business, the Royal Air Force, and the pharmaceuticals business. His biggest contribution to business was when he founded &quot;Batley&#x27;s Cash and Carry&quot;; he claims to be the first to use the phrase and the concept of &quot;cash and carry&quot;, and his idea became popular, bringing a whole new way of working to retailers across the UK. He put his success down to daily two-hour siestas between 12pm-2pm.

In later life, Batley sponsored the Lawrence Batley Seniors (a veterans golf competition), the Lawrence Batley Stand at the Galpharm Stadium for its first 10 years, the Lawrence Batley Theatre and the National Arts Education Archive at Bretton Hall College (now part of the University of Leeds).

The business has now been taken over by his only child, Rita Firth. Helped by her husband, Bruce Firth, they have sold Batley&#x27;s Cash and Carry and also sold L.Batley Pet Products, one of the leading pet food distributors in the UK, which the family started after Cash and Carry was sold.

He died in August 2002.

<doc id="1059269" wikidata="Q3304183" url="?curid=1059269" title="2004 Pacific hurricane season">
<text>The 2004 Pacific hurricane season was an overall below-average Pacific hurricane season in which there were 12 named tropical storms, all of which formed in the eastern Pacific basin (east of 140°W and north of the equator). Of these, 6 became hurricanes, and 3 of those intensified into major hurricanes. No storms made landfall in 2004, the first such occurrence since 1991. In addition to the season&#x27;s 12 named storms, there were five tropical depressions that did not reach tropical storm status. One of them, Sixteen-E, made landfall in northwestern Sinaloa. The season officially began on May 15 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1 in the central Pacific basin (between140°W and the International Date Line, north of the equator). It officially ended in both basins on November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period during each year when most tropical cyclones form in each respective basin. These dates conventionally delimit the period during each year when a majority of tropical cyclones form. The season was reflected by an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of 71 units.

Impact throughout the season was minimal and no deaths were recorded. In early August, the remnants of Hurricane Darby contributed to localized heavy rainfall in Hawaii, causing minor street and stream flooding; coffee and macadamia trees were damaged as well. In early September, Hurricane Howard resulted in significant flooding across the Baja California peninsula that damaged agricultural land and 393 homes. Large swells also resulted in about 1,000 lifeguard rescues in California. In mid-September, Javier, the strongest hurricane of the season, caused three fishermen to go missing and helped alleviate a multi-year drought across the Southwest United States. It produced record rainfall in the state of Wyoming. In mid- to late October, Tropical Storm Lester and Tropical Depression Sixteen-E each dumped heavy rain upon parts of Mexico, resulting in minor flood and mudslide damage.

== Seasonal forecasts ==

In January 2004, the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) released their first prediction for tropical cyclone activity throughout the Northeast Pacific. Based on a Neutral El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a total of 15 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes was forecast. These values were slightly altered in May to 14 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes, and again in August to 13 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes.

On May 17, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued its seasonal forecast for the 2004 central Pacific season, predicting four or five tropical cyclones to form or cross into the basin. Likewise to the SMN, near average activity was expected largely as a result of a Neutral ENSO. The organization issued its experimental eastern Pacific outlook on May 21, highlighting a 45 percent change of below-average activity, 45 percent chance of near-average activity, and only a 10 percent chance of above-average activity in the basin. A total of 13 to 15 named storms, 6 to 8 hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes was forecast.
== Seasonal summary ==

Activity was below average throughout the season. Altogether there were 12 named storms, 6 of which became hurricanes, and 3 of those intensified into major hurricanes, compared to the long-term average of 16 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes.

The season&#x27;s first storm, Agatha, developed on May 22. No tropical cyclones developed during June, below the average of 2 named storms and 1 hurricane, and also the first time since 1969 that the month was cyclone-free. The first hurricane of the season was Celia, which briefly reached Category 1 strength on July 22. It was soon followed by Darby, the first major Hurricane of the season and the first in the Eastern Pacific since Kenna in 2002. Later, on September 14, Javier attained sustained winds of , making it the strongest hurricane of the season.

Overall wind energy output was reflected with an ACE index value of 71 units for the season. Although vertical wind shear was near average and ocean temperatures were slightly warmer than average south of Mexico, anomalously cool waters and drier than average air mass existed in the central portions of the eastern Pacific. Anomalously strong mid-level ridging extending from the Atlantic to northern Mexico steered a majority of the season&#x27;s cyclones toward this inhospitable region and also acted to steer all the system of tropical storm intensity or stronger away from land.
== Systems ==
=== Tropical Storm Agatha ===

A nearly stationary trough stretched from the eastern Pacific into the eastern Caribbean Sea during mid-May. An ill-defined tropical wave crossed Central America on May 17 and interacted with the trough, eventually leading to the formation of a tropical depression at 00:00 UTC on May 22. The newly formed cyclone moved northwest parallel to the coastline of Mexico while steadily organizing in a low wind shear regime, intensifying into Tropical Storm Agatha by 12:00 UTC that day and attaining peak winds of twelve hours later. Increasingly cool ocean temperatures and a drier air mass caused Agatha to weaken quickly thereafter, and it degenerated into a remnant low by 12:00 UTC on May 24. The post-tropical cyclone drifted aimlessly before dissipating well south of the Baja California Peninsula on May 26.
=== Tropical Depression Two-E ===

A westward-moving tropical wave from Africa crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific in late June, coalescing into a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on July 2 well southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. Steered westward by low-level flow, the depression failed to organize amid wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures, instead degenerating into a remnant low at 00:00 UTC on July 4. The post-tropical cyclone dissipated a day later.
=== Tropical Depression One-C ===

An organized region of convection within the Intertropical Convergence Zone developed into a tropical depression at 03:00 UTC on July 5 while located roughly south-southeast of Johnston Atoll, becoming the farthest-south-forming central Pacific tropical cyclone since Tropical Storm Hali (1992). Steered westward, the depression failed to intensify due to its quick forward motion despite a seemingly favorable environment, and it quickly dissipated at 00:00 UTC on July 6.
=== Tropical Storm Blas ===

A tropical wave crossed Central America on July 8, developing into a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on July 12 while located about southwest of Zihuatanejo, Mexico; six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Blas. Steered swiftly northwestward around a mid-level ridge over the southwestern United States, the cyclone steadily intensified and reached peak winds of early on July 13 as a large and robust convective canopy became evident. Blas began a steady weakening trend as it tracked over increasingly cool sea surface temperatures, weakening to a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on July 14 and degenerating into a large remnant low twelve hours later. The post-tropical cyclone decelerated and curved northeastward, dissipating well west of central Baja California early on July 19.
=== Hurricane Celia ===

A vigorous tropical wave entered the East Pacific on July 13, acquiring sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression at 00:00 UTC on July 19 while located about south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. Directed west-northwest around a subtropical ridge, the cyclone steadily intensified amongst a favorable environment, becoming Tropical Storm Celia at 12:00 UTC that same day and further strengthening into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, the season&#x27;s first, at 00:00 UTC on July 22. After attaining peak winds of six hours later, an increasingly unfavorable environment began to hinder the system. Celia weakened to a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC on July 22 and eventually degenerated into a remnant low at 00:00 UTC on July 26. The post-tropical cyclone dissipated about west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula later that morning.
=== Hurricane Darby ===
A tropical depression formed at 12:00 UTC on July 26 while positioned about south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico from a tropical wave that entered the eastern Pacific nearly a week prior. The system quickly intensified as it curved west-northwest around a subtropical ridge, becoming Tropical Storm Darby at 00:00 UTC on July 27 and strengthening into a Category 1 hurricane early the next day. After attaining its peak as the season&#x27;s first major hurricane with winds of , increasing wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures begin to weaken the cyclone. It weakened to a tropical storm at 12:00 UTC on July 30 and further to a tropical depression a day later as it entered the jurisdiction of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. At 12:00 UTC on August 1, Darby dissipated about east of the Hawaiian Islands.

Although Darby produced no impacts to land as a tropical cyclone, its remnant moisture field combined with an upper-level trough over Hawaii to produce an unstable atmosphere. General rainfall amounts of were recorded across the Big Island and Oahu, with a localized peak of in Kaneohe; this led to flooding and several road closures. Minor stream flooding was observed on the southeast flank of Mount Haleakalā. A rainfall total of was recorded at the Honolulu International Airport, contributing to the wettest August on record in the city. Some coffee and macadamia nut trees were damaged.
=== Tropical Depression Six-E ===

Operationally, an area of disturbed weather was thought to have coalesced into a tropical depression at 09:00 UTC on July 29 while located well southwest of the Baja California Peninsula. The depression was only expected to intensify slightly before entering cooler waters and interacting with outflow from nearby Hurricane Darby. By late that evening, however, its presentation on satellite imagery more resembled a trough, and the NHC discontinued advisories. In post-season analysis, the organization determined that the depression did not form until 06:00 UTC on August 1 but lasted 24 hours.
=== Tropical Storm Estelle ===

A tropical wave interacted with a disturbance embedded in the ITCZ in mid-August, leading to the designation of a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on August 19 while located east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. The cyclone moved west-northwest following formation, steered around a subtropical ridge. It intensified into Tropical Storm Estelle at 06:00 UTC on August 20 and attained peak winds of at 12:00 UTC the next morning as it crossed into the central Pacific. Thereafter, increasing wind shear caused Estelle to a steady weakening trend. At 00:00 UTC on August 23, the cyclone decelerated to a tropical depression while turning west-southwest, and at 18:00 UTC the following day, it further degenerated into a remnant low. The post-tropical cyclone continued on a west-southwest trajectory prior to dissipating south-southeast of the Big Island at 00:00 UTC on August 26.
=== Hurricane Frank ===

A tropical wave, the remnants of Tropical Storm Earl in the Atlantic, crossed into the eastern Pacific in mid-August and steadily organized to become a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on August 23 well south of the coastline of Mexico. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Frank six hours later as banding features and central convection increased. Steered northwest within a favorable environment, the cyclone rapidly intensified into a Category 1 hurricane by 18:00 UTC and ultimately attained peak winds of twelve hours later. Frank steadily weakened thereafter as it entered cooler ocean temperatures, degenerating into a remnant low at 06:00 UTC on August 26. The remnant low drifted southwest before diffusing into a trough well south of the Baja California Peninsula the following day.
=== Tropical Depression Nine-E ===

A tropical wave crossed Central America on August 15, only slowing organizing into a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on August 23 while located about west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Steered north-northwest and eventually west, the cyclone failed to intensify further into a tropical storm amid cool sea surface temperatures and southerly wind shear, and it instead degenerated into a remnant low at 18:00 UTC on August 26. The post-tropical cyclone turned west-southwest before dissipating about east of Hilo, Hawaii early on August 28.
=== Tropical Storm Georgette ===

A westward-moving tropical wave entered the eastern Pacific in late August, acquiring sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on August 26 about south-southeast of the Baja California Peninsula. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Georgette six hours later as its satellite presentation improved, and it reached peak winds of at 12:00 UTC on August 27. Increasingly hostile upper-level winds began to impinge on the west-northwest-moving tropical cyclone shortly thereafter, ultimately causing it to degenerate into a remnant low by 18:00 UTC on August 30. The post-tropical cyclone continued its forward course until dissipating early on September 3.
=== Hurricane Howard ===
A westward-moving tropical wave from Africa entered the eastern Pacific in late August, organizing into a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on August 30 south of the coastline of Mexico. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Howard twelve hours later and further developed into a hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 1. On its northwest track, a favorable environment regime prompted the cyclone to begin a period of rapid intensification, and it attained its peak as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of at 12:00 UTC on September 2. Cooler ocean temperatures led to a steady weakening trend thereafter, and Howard degenerated into a remnant low at 18:00 UTC on September 5. The low turned southwest before dissipating over open waters on September 10.

Although the storm remained offshore, the outer bands of the storm produced significant flooding across the Baja California peninsula, which damaged agricultural land and at least 393 homes. Swells reached along the Baja California coastline and along the California coastline; about 1,000 lifeguard rescues took place in California due to the waves. Moisture from the storm enhanced rainfall in parts of Arizona, leading to minor accumulations.
=== Hurricane Isis ===

A tropical wave, possibly responsible for the formation of Hurricane Frances in the Atlantic, entered the eastern Pacific in early September, gaining sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on September 8 about south of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The system tracked west, intensifying into Tropical Storm Isis twelve hours after being designated, but weakening back to a tropical depression early on September 10, amid persistent wind shear. Upper-level winds decreased by September 12, allowing Isis to regain tropical storm intensity by 00:00 UTC, and eventually peak as a Category 1 hurricane with winds of , at 12:00 UTC on September 15. After conducting a clockwise loop, the hurricane entered cooler waters and began to weaken; it degenerated into a remnant low at 18:00 UTC on the next day. The low drifted southwest and then west, before dissipating well east of Hawaii on September 21.
=== Hurricane Javier ===
A tropical wave entered the eastern Pacific in early September, organizing into a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on September 10 south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Under light shear, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Javier at 12:00 UTC the next morning and into a hurricane at 18:00 UTC on September 12. The cyclone soon began a period of rapid intensification as it alternated on a west-northwest to northwest course, ultimately peaking as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of at 00:00 UTC on September 14 as a distinct pinhole eye became evident on satellite imagery. Cooler waters, strong southwesterly shear, and an eyewall replacement cycle all weakened Javier thereafter; it fell to tropical depression intensity early on September 19 before crossing Baja California and degenerated into a remnant low at 18:00 UTC that day over the Gulf of California. The low crossed the state of Sonora before dissipating over mountainous terrain on September 20.

As a tropical cyclone, Javier produced moderate rainfall peaking at in Bacanuchi, Mexico. Three fishermen went missing offshore the coastline due to high surf. As a post-tropical cyclone, the storm&#x27;s remnant moisture overspread the Southwest United States, alleviating a multi-year drought. Accumulations peaked at in Walnut Creek, Arizona, with lighter totals across the Four Corners and upper Midwest. The remnants of Javier produced of rain in Wyoming, cementing its status as the wettest tropical cyclone in the reliable record there.
=== Tropical Storm Kay ===

An area of disturbed weather developed within the ITCZ well southwest of mainland Mexico, coalescing into a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on October 4. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Kay twelve hours later, and it attained peak winds of at 12:00 UTC the next morning as suggested by satellite intensity estimates. Moderate northerly shear caused core convection to decrease as the system moved west-northwest, resulting in Kay degenerating into a remnant low at 12:00 UTC on October 6 over open ocean. The low-level swirl curved southwestward and dissipated the next day.
=== Tropical Storm Lester ===

By October 10, an area of disturbed weather was situated well to the southwest of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Later that day, a surface low pressure system developed, and convection began to organize into slightly curved bands. The disturbance continued to in this manner, and at 1800 UTC on October 11, the low level circulation had become sufficiently organized to be designated as a tropical depression. At the time, the depression consisted of a well-defined circulation, with some deep thunderstorm activity. Despite weak steering currents, the system started what was initially thought to be a westward drift, though just a few hours later was found to be towards the northwest. A small cyclone, a burst of deep convection formed at around the same time, and was said could have produced tropical storm-force winds.

Continuing its slow, northwestward track under the weal steering currents of a weak mid-level ridge to its north, and a broad cyclonic circulation to its southwest, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Lester at 1800 UTC on October 12. Originally, it was unclear whether the center of circulation would remain slightly offshore, or move inland. Due to the presence of a weak upper-level anticyclone that was centered just east of the system, favorable atmospheric conditions for strengthening prevailed, and the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of about 6–12 hours after being upgraded to a tropical storm. Early on October 13, radar imagery from Acapulco, Mexico indicated that Lester remained a small and well-organized cyclone as it passed just offshore. At the same time, light southwesterly wind shear began to develop. The interaction with land, combined with influence from the low to the southwest, started to weaken the storm, and it was downgraded to a tropical depression at 1200 UTC on October 13. By later that day, reports from an Air Force Reserve Unit Hurricane Hunter Aircraft indicated that the cyclone had degenerated into a trough on the northeastern side of the larger low to the southwest.

On October 12, in response to Lester, the Mexican government issued a tropical storm watch for the coast between Punta Maldonado to Zihuatanejo. It was upgraded to a warning later that day. It was extended to Lázaro Cárdenas on October 13. Later that day, the warning was lifted when Lester dissipated. Lester brought rains to parts of Oaxaca and Guerrero, reaching . The highest 24-hour total peaked at , recorded on October 12. The storm capsized two ships, and washed two more ashore. The heavy rain caused mudslides, which buried one man in his home; he was later rescued by his family. In and around the port of Acapulco, minor flooding was reported and 42 trees toppled. Four landslides blocked four roads in Nayarit. A total of 13 families were evacuated in Rosamorada. 
=== Tropical Depression Sixteen-E ===

On October 8, 2004, a tropical wave emerged from the west coast of Africa and progressed westward through the Atlantic Ocean. As is typical of disturbances in the late hurricane season, the wave maintained a relatively low latitude during its trek across the Atlantic. On October 18, the system emerged into the eastern Pacific Ocean. Convection developed along the wave axis, and an area of low pressure developed the next day, while situated south of Guatemala. It drifted westward uneventfully until October 23, when it became nearly stationary. Strong thunderstorms amplified and organized into banding features early on October 24. Dvorak classifications were issued on the weather feature, and over the following day it moved slowly towards the north. At 00:00 UTC on October 25, the system was designated Tropical Depression Sixteen-E about south-southeast of Baja California.

The depression intensified slightly, and attained its peak winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) almost immediately after forming. As such, it never attained tropical storm status; however, had it been upgraded, it would have been named Madeline. The large cyclone moved towards the north along the western edge of the Mexican subtropical ridge. Even shortly after the storm&#x27;s classification, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked that Sixteen-E would have little time to significantly strengthen, although noted the possibility for it to achieve minimal tropical storm status. At the time, the storm was being disrupted by wind shear, with most of its deep convective activity concentrated in the eastern half of the circulation.

At around 20:00 UTC, an area of strong convection, including cold cloud tops, developed near the center of circulation. The burst of thunderstorms may have been related to an approaching trough. Tropical Depression Sixteen-E continued moving towards the coast of Mexico, and at 00:00 UTC on October 26, it reached its lowest barometric pressure of 1004 mbar (hPa; 29.65 inHg). It crossed the southwestern Gulf of California before moving ashore between Guasave and Topolobampo. The deteriorating cyclone moved inland, and the last advisory was issued by the NHC on the storm shortly thereafter. Although the storm dissipated at 18:00 UTC, its remnants persisted as they moved across northern Mexico. The system interacted with a weather front in the southwestern United States and triggered thunderstorms there.

On October 25, a tropical storm warning was issued for the coastline of Mexico from El Roblito northward to Topolobampo. This advisory was discontinued the next day, and no additional tropical cyclone watches and warnings were posted. The storm produced areas of heavy rainfall. At Culiacan, of precipitation fell in a 24-hour period; fell at Empalme. Despite localized flooding, no damage or fatalities were reported. At the Culiacan airport, a wind gust to was reported. A possible tornado may have also touched down near there. Offshore, a ship—the &quot;Diamond Princess&quot;—recorded winds on two separate occasions during October 26, potentially suggesting that the storm was stronger than it was believed to be. The interaction between the depression&#x27;s remnants and a frontal boundary over the southwestern United States produced strong thunderstorms and heavy precipitation in eastern New Mexico, western and central Texas, and much of Oklahoma.
=== Other system ===
On August 14, the Japan Meteorological Agency had stated that Tropical Storm Malakas had briefly exited the West Pacific basin and entered the Central Pacific basin, as a weakening tropical depression.

== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Pacific east of 140°W in 2004. This is the same list used for the 1998 season. No names were retired from this list by the World Meteorological Organization following the season, and it was used again for the 2010 season.

For storms that form in the North Pacific between 140°W and the International Date Line, the names come from a series of four rotating lists. Names are used one after the other without regard to year, and when the bottom of one list is reached, the next named storm receives the name at the top of the next list. No named storms formed within the region in 2004. Named storms in the table above that crossed into the area during the year are noted (*).

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 2004 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 2004 USD.

<doc id="1059272" wikidata="Q1114749" url="?curid=1059272" title="Scottish national identity">
<text>Scottish national identity, including Scottish nationalism, are terms referring to the sense of national identity as embodied in the shared and characteristic culture, languages, and traditions of the Scottish people. It includes the civic, ethnic, cultural, or economic influences found in Scotland.

Although the various languages of Gaelic, Scots, and Scottish English are distinctive, people associate them all together as Scottish with a shared identity, as well as a regional or local identity. Parts of Scotland, like Glasgow, the Outer Hebrides, Orkney, Shetland, the northeast of Scotland, and the Scottish Borders, retain a strong sense of regional identity, alongside the Scottish national identity.

In 2022 the Scottish Government defined &quot;national identity&quot; as &quot;a feeling of attachment to a nation&quot;. At the 2011 census 82.7 per cent of the Scottish population said that they had &quot;some Scottish national identity&quot;, amount to roughly 4.4 million people. Scottish national identity was the most common response in the 2011 census in North Lanarkshire, Inverclyde, East Ayrshire, and West Dumbartonshire. 62.4 per cent of the population described themselves as &quot;Scottish only&quot; in the 2011 census, roughly 3.3 million people of the population.

==History==

===Pre-Union===

====Early Middle Ages====

In the Early Middle Ages, what is now Scotland was divided between four major ethnic groups and kingdoms. In the east were the Picts, who fell under the leadership of the kings of Fortriu. In the west were the Gaelic (Goidelic)-speaking people of Dál Riata with close links with the island of Ireland, from which they brought with them the name Scots. In the south-west was the British (Brythonic) Kingdom of Strathclyde, often named Alt Clut. Finally there were the &#x27;English&#x27;, the Angles, a Germanic people who had established a number of kingdoms in Great Britain, including the Kingdom of Bernicia, part of which was in the south-east of modern Scotland. In the late eighth century this situation was transformed by the beginning of ferocious attacks by the Vikings, who eventually settled in Galloway, Orkney, Shetland, and the Hebrides. These threats may have hastened a long-term process of ‘Gaelicisation’ of the Pictish kingdoms, which adopted Gaelic language and customs. There was also a merger of the Gaelic and Pictish crowns. When he died as king of the combined kingdom in 900, Domnall II (Donald II) was the first man to be called &quot;rí Alban&quot; (i.e. &quot;King of Alba&quot;).

====High Middle Ages====

In the High Middle Ages the word &quot;Scot&quot; was only used by Scots to describe themselves to foreigners, amongst whom it was the most common word. They called themselves &quot;Albanach&quot; or simply &quot;Gaidel&quot;. Both &quot;Scot&quot; and &quot;Gaidel&quot; were ethnic terms that connected them to the majority of the inhabitants of Ireland. At the beginning of the thirteenth century, the author of &quot;De Situ Albanie&quot; noted: &quot;The name Arregathel [Argyll] means margin of the Scots or Irish, because all Scots and Irish are generally called &#x27;Gattheli&#x27;.&quot; Scotland came to possess a unity which transcended Gaelic, French and Germanic ethnic differences and by the end of the period, the Latin, French and English word &quot;Scot&quot; could be used for any subject of the Scottish king. Scotland&#x27;s multilingual Scoto-Norman monarchs and mixed Gaelic and Scoto-Norman aristocracy all became part of the &quot;Community of the Realm&quot;, in which ethnic differences were less divisive than in Ireland and Wales. This identity was defined in opposition to English attempts to annex the country and as a result of social and cultural changes. The resulting antipathy towards England dominated Scottish foreign policy well into the fifteenth century, making it extremely difficult for Scottish kings like James III and James IV to pursue policies of peace towards their southern neighbour. In particular the &quot;Declaration of Arbroath&quot; asserted the ancient distinctiveness of Scotland in the face of English aggression, arguing that it was the role of the king to defend the independence of the community of Scotland. This document has been seen as the first &quot;nationalist theory of sovereignty&quot;.

====Late Middle Ages====

The Late Middle Ages has often been seen as the era in which Scottish national identity was initially forged, in opposition to English attempts to annexe the country, led by figures such as Robert the Bruce and William Wallace and as a result of social and cultural changes. English invasions and interference in Scotland have been judged to have created a sense of national unity and a hatred towards England which dominated Scottish foreign policy well into the fifteenth century, making it extremely difficult for Scottish kings like James III and James IV to pursue policies of peace towards their southern neighbour. In particular the &quot;Declaration of Arbroath&quot; (1320) asserted the ancient distinctiveness of Scotland in the face of English aggression, arguing that it was the role of the king was to defend the independence of the community of Scotland and has been seen as the first &quot;nationalist theory of sovereignty&quot;.

The adoption of Middle Scots by the aristocracy has been seen as building a sense of national solidarity and culture between rulers and ruled, although the fact that North of the Tay Gaelic still dominated, may have helped widen the cultural divide between Highlands and Lowlands. The national literature of Scotland created in the late medieval period employed legend and history in the service of the crown and nationalism, helping to foster a sense of national identity at least within its elite audience. The epic poetic history of &quot;The Brus&quot; and &quot;Wallace&quot; helped outline a narrative of united struggle against the English enemy. Arthurian literature differed from conventional version of the legend by treating Arthur as a villain and Mordred, the son of the king of the Picts, as a hero. The origin myth of the Scots, systematised by John of Fordun (c. 1320-c. 1384), traced their beginnings from the Greek prince Gathelus and his Egyptian wife Scota, allowing them to argue superiority over the English, who claimed their descent from the Trojans, who had been defeated by the Greeks.

It was in this period that the national flag emerged as a common symbol. The image of St. Andrew martyred bound to an X-shaped cross first appeared in the Kingdom of Scotland during the reign of William I and was again depicted on seals used during the late thirteenth century; including on one particular example used by the Guardians of Scotland, dated 1286. Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the saltire, has its origins in the late fourteenth century; the Parliament of Scotland decreed in 1385 that Scottish soldiers wear a white Saint Andrew&#x27;s Cross on their person, both in front and behind, for the purpose of identification. Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew&#x27;s Cross is said to date from at least the fifteenth century. The earliest reference to the Saint Andrew&#x27;s Cross as a flag is to be found in the &quot;Vienna Book of Hours&quot;, circa 1503.

Like most western European monarchies, the Scottish crown in the fifteenth century adopted the example of the Burgundian court, through formality and elegance putting itself at the centre of culture and political life, defined with display, ritual and pageantry, reflected in elaborate new palaces and patronage of the arts. Renaissance ideas began to influence views on government, described as New or Renaissance monarchy, which emphasised the status and significance of the monarch. The Roman Law principle that &quot;a king is emperor in his own kingdom&quot; can be seen in Scotland from the mid-fifteenth century. In 1469 Parliament passed an act that declared that James III possessed &quot;full jurisdiction and empire within his realm&quot;. From the 1480s the king&#x27;s image on his silver groats showed him wearing a closed, arched, imperial crown, in place of the open circlet of medieval kings, probably the first coin image of its kind outside of Italy. It soon began to appear in heraldry, on royal seals, manuscripts, sculptures and the steeples of churches with royal connections, as at St. Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh.

====Sixteenth century====
The idea of imperial monarchy emphasised the dignity of the crown and included its role as a unifying national force, defending national borders and interest, royal supremacy over the law and a distinctive national church within the Catholic communion. James V was the first Scottish monarch to wear the closed imperial crown, in place of the open circlet of medieval kings, suggesting a claim to absolute authority within the kingdom. His diadem was reworked to include arches in 1532, which were re-added when it was reconstructed in 1540 in what remains the Crown of Scotland. During her brief personal rule Mary, Queen of Scots brought many of the elaborate court activities that she had grown up with at the French court, with balls, masques and celebrations, designed to illustrate the resurgence of the monarchy and to facilitate national unity. However, her personal reign ended in civil war, deposition, imprisonment and execution in England. Her infant son James VI was crowned King of Scots in 1567.

By the early modern era Gaelic had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second-class language, confined to the Highlands and Islands. It was gradually being replaced by Middle Scots, which became the language of both the nobility and the majority population. Scots was derived substantially from Old English, with Gaelic and French influences. It was called &quot;Inglyshe&quot; in the fifteenth century and was very close to the language spoken in northern England, but by the sixteenth century it had established orthographic and literary norms largely independent of those developing in England. From the mid-sixteenth century, written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing Standard English of Southern England due to developments in royal and political interactions with England. With the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England, most writing in Scotland came to be done in the English fashion. Unlike many of his predecessors, James VI generally despised Gaelic culture.

After the Reformation there was the development of a national kirk that claimed to represent all of Scotland. It became the subject of national pride, and was often compared with the less clearly reformed church in neighbouring England. Jane Dawson suggests that the loss of national standing in the contest for dominance of Britain between England and France suffered by the Scots, may have led them to stress their religious achievements. A theology developed that saw the kingdom as in a covenant relationship with God. Many Scots saw their country as a new Israel and themselves as a holy people engaged in a struggle between the forces of Christ and Antichrist, the latter being identified with the resurgent papacy and the Roman Catholic Church. This view was reinforced by events elsewhere that demonstrated that Reformed religion was under threat, such as the 1572 massacre of St Bartholomew in France and the Spanish Armada in 1588. These views were popularised through the first Protestant histories, such as Knox&#x27;s &quot;History of the Reformation&quot; and George Buchanan&#x27;s &quot;Rerum Scoticarum Historia&quot;. This period also saw a growth of a patriotic literature facilitated by the rise of popular printing. Published editions of medieval poetry by John Barbour and Robert Henryson and the plays of David Lyndsay all gained a new audience.

====Seventeenth century====
In 1603, James VI King of Scots inherited the throne of the Kingdom of England and left Edinburgh for London where he would reign as James I. The Union was a personal or dynastic union, with the crowns remaining both distinct and separate—despite James&#x27; best efforts to create a new &quot;imperial&quot; throne of &quot;Great Britain&quot;. James used his Royal prerogative powers to take the style of &quot;King of Great Britain&quot; and to give an explicitly British character to his court and person, and attempted to create a political union between England and Scotland. The two parliaments established a commission to negotiate a union, formulating an instrument of union between the two countries. However, the idea of political union was unpopular, and when James dropped his policy of a speedy union, the topic quietly disappeared from the legislative agenda. When the House of Commons attempted to revive the proposal in 1610, it was met with a more open hostility.

The Protestant identification of Scotland as a &quot;new Israel&quot;, emphasising a covenant with God, emerged at the front of national politics in 1637, as Presbyterians rebelled against Charles I&#x27;s liturgical reforms and signed the National Covenant. In the subsequent Wars of Three Kingdoms Scottish armies marched under the saltire of St. Andrew, rather than the lion rampant, with slogans such as &quot;Religion, Crown, Covenant and Country&quot;. After defeats at Dunbar (1650) and Worcester (1651) Scotland was occupied and in 1652 declared part of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland. Although it had supporters, the independence of Scotland as a kingdom was restored with the Stuart monarchy in 1660.

In the Glorious Revolution in 1688–89, the Catholic James VII was replaced by the Protestant William of Orange, Stadtholder of the Netherlands and his wife Mary, James&#x27;s daughter, on the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland. The final settlement restored Presbyterianism and abolished the bishops, who had generally supported James. The result left the nation divided between a predominately Presbyterian Lowland and a predominately Episcopalian Highland region. Support for James, which became known as Jacobitism, from the Latin (Jacobus) for James, led to a series of risings, beginning with John Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee. His forces, almost all Highlanders, defeated William&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689, but they took heavy losses and Dundee was slain in the fighting. Without his leadership the Jacobite army was soon defeated at the Battle of Dunkeld. During the following years, William proposed a complete union to the Parliament of Scotland in 1700 and 1702, but the proposals were rejected.

====Union====
William&#x27;s successor was Mary&#x27;s sister Anne, who had no surviving children and so the Protestant succession seemed in doubt. The English Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which fixed the succession on Sophia of Hanover and her descendants. However, the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s parallel Act of Security 1704, merely prohibited a Roman Catholic successor, leaving open the possibility that the crowns would diverge. Rather than risk the possible return of James Francis Edward Stuart, then living in France, the English parliament pressed for full union of the two countries, passing the Alien Act 1705, which threatened to make all Scotsmen unable to hold property in England unless moves toward union were made and would have severely damaged the cattle and linen trades. A political union between Scotland and England was also seen as economically attractive, promising to open up the much larger markets of England, as well as those of the growing Empire. However, there was widespread, if disunited opposition and mistrust in the general population. Sums paid to Scottish commissioners and leading political figure have been described as bribes, but the existence of direct bribes is disputed. The Treaty of Union confirmed the Hanoverian succession. The Church of Scotland and Scottish law and courts remained separate, while Scotland retained its distinctive system of parish schools. The English and Scottish parliaments were replaced by a combined Parliament of Great Britain, but it sat in Westminster and largely continued English traditions without interruption. Forty-five Scots were added to the 513 members of the House of Commons and 16 Scots to the 190 members of the House of Lords. Rosalind Mitchison argues that the parliament became a focus of national political life, but it never attained the position of a true centre of national identity attained by its English counterpart. It was also a full economic union, replacing the Scottish systems of currency, taxation and laws regulating trade. The Privy Council was abolished, which meant that effective government in Scotland lay in the hands of unofficial &quot;managers&quot;.

===Early Union (1707–1832)===

====Jacobitism====
Jacobitism was revived by the unpopularity of the union with England in 1707. In 1708 James Francis Edward Stuart, the son of James VII, who became known as &quot;The Old Pretender&quot;, attempted an invasion with French support. The two most serious risings were in 1715 and 1745. The first was soon after the death of Anne and the accession of the first Hanoverian king George I. It envisaged simultaneous uprisings in England, Wales and Scotland, but they only developed in Scotland and Northern England. John Erskine, Earl of Mar, raised the Jacobite clans in the Highlands. Mar was defeated at Battle of Sheriffmuir and day later part of his forces, who had joined up with risings in northern England and southern Scotland, were defeated at the Battle of Preston. By the time the Old Pretender arrived in Scotland the rising was all but defeated and he returned to continental exile. The 1745 rising was led by Charles Edward Stuart, son of the &quot;Old Pretender&quot;, often referred to as &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot; or the &quot;Young Pretender&quot;. His support was almost exclusively among the Highland clans. The rising enjoyed initial success, with Highland armies defeating Hanoverian forces and occupying Edinburgh before an abortive march that reached Derby in England. Charles&#x27; position in Scotland began to deteriorate as the Scottish Whig supporters rallied and regained control of Edinburgh. He retreated north to be defeated at Culloden on 16 April 1746. There were bloody reprisals against his supporters and foreign powers abandoned the Jacobite cause, with the court in exile forced to leave France. The Old Pretender died in 1766 and the Young Pretender, without legitimate issue, in 1788. When his brother, Henry, Cardinal of York, died in 1807, the Jacobite cause was at an end. The Jacobite risings highlighted the social and cultural schism within Scotland, between the &quot;improved,&quot; English and Scots-speaking Lowlands and the underdeveloped Gaelic-speaking Highlands.

====Language====
Scottish Gaelic, also known as the founding language of Scotland, is currently the oldest Scottish language still in use today.

Between 1494 and 1698, passed by the Scots Parliament to make English the first language, Gaelic had struggled to retain a foothold over Scotland. As Scotland and Great Britain were united under the Acts of Union 1707, Gaelic lost its legitimacy as a legal and administrative language. Prior to the Education (Scotland) Act 1872, the Act of Proscription 1746 was implemented to assimilate Highland Scots into Lowland &amp; British culture.

Following 1707, and the shift of political power to England, the use of Scots was also discouraged by many in authority and education, as was the notion of Scottishness itself. Many leading Scots of the period, such as David Hume, considered themselves Northern British rather than Scottish.

Many Scots took to learning English through the activities of those such as Thomas Sheridan, who in 1761 gave a series of lectures on English elocution. Charging a guinea at a time (about £ in today&#x27;s money) they were attended by over 300 men, and he was made a freeman of the City of Edinburgh. Following this, some of the city&#x27;s intellectuals formed the &quot;Select Society for Promoting the Reading and Speaking of the English Language in Scotland&quot;. Nevertheless, Scots remained the vernacular of many rural lowland communities and the growing number of urban working-class Scots. In the Highlands, Gaelic language and culture persisted, and the region as a whole was seen as an &quot;other&quot; by lowlanders.

For this reason, the protection and revival of both Scottish Gaelic and Lowland Scots play a key role within Scottish national identity

====Literature and Romanticism====
Although Scotland increasingly adopted the English language and wider cultural norms, its literature developed a distinct national identity and began to enjoy an international reputation. Allan Ramsay (1686–1758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the Habbie stanza as a poetic form. James Macpherson was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation, claiming to have found poetry written by ancient bard Ossian, he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. &quot;Fingal&quot; written in 1762 was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work to bring about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German, literature, influencing Herder and Goethe. Eventually it became clear that the poems were not direct translations from the Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of his audience.

Robert Burns and Walter Scott were highly influenced by the Ossian cycle. Burns, an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland and a major figure in the Romantic movement. As well as making original compositions, Burns also collected folk songs from across Scotland, often revising or adapting them. His poem (and song) &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; is often sung at Hogmanay (the last day of the year), and &quot;Scots Wha Hae&quot; served for a long time as an unofficial national anthem of the country. Scott began as a poet and also collected and published Scottish ballads. His first prose work, Waverley in 1814, is often called the first historical novel. It launched a highly successful career that probably more than any other helped define and popularise Scottish cultural identity.

====Tartanry====
In the 1820s, as part of the Romantic revival, tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe. Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;staging&quot; of the royal visit of King George IV to Scotland in 1822 and the king&#x27;s wearing of tartan resulted in a massive upsurge in demand for kilts and tartans that could not be met by the Scottish linen industry. The designation of individual clan tartans was largely defined in this period and they became a major symbol of Scottish identity. The fashion for all things Scottish was maintained by Queen Victoria who helped secure the identity of Scotland as a tourist resort and the popularity of the tartan fashion. This &quot;tartanry&quot; identified Scottish identity with the previously despised or distrusted Highland identity and may have been a response to the disappearance of traditional Highland society, increasing industrialisation and urbanisation.

The romanticisation of the Highlands and the adoption of Jacobitism into mainstream culture have been seen as defusing the potential threat to the Union with England, the House of Hanover and the dominant Whig government. In many countries Romanticism played a major part in the emergence of radical independence movements through the development of national identities. Tom Nairn argues that Romanticism in Scotland did not develop along the lines seen elsewhere in Europe, leaving a &quot;rootless&quot; intelligentsia, who moved to England or elsewhere and so did not supply a cultural nationalism that could be communicated to the emerging working classes. Graeme Moreton and Lindsay Paterson both argue that the lack of interference of the British state in civil society meant that the middle classes had no reason to object to the union. Atsuko Ichijo argues that national identity cannot be equated with a movement for independence. Moreton suggests that there was a Scottish nationalism, but that it was expressed in terms of &quot;Unionist nationalism&quot;.

===Victorian and Edwardian eras (1832–1910)===

====Industrialisation====
From the second half of the eighteenth century Scotland was transformed by the process of Industrial Revolution, emerging as one of the commercial and industrial centres of the British Empire. It began with trade with Colonial America, first in tobacco and then rum, sugar and cotton. The cotton industry declined due to blockades during the American Civil War, but by this time Scotland had developed as a centre for coal mining, engineering, shipbuilding and the production of locomotives, with steel production largely replacing iron production in the late nineteenth century. This resulted in rapid urbanisation in the industrial belt that ran across the country from southwest to northeast; by 1900 the four industrialised counties of Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, Dunbartonshire, and Ayrshire contained 44 per cent of the population. These industrial developments, while they brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision for public health did not keep pace with them, and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis. The new companies attracted rural workers, as well as large numbers immigrants from Catholic Ireland, changing the religious balance and national character, particularly in the urban centres of the west. In cities like Glasgow a sense of civic pride emerged as it expanded to become the &quot;second city of the Empire&quot;, while the corporation remodelled the town and controlled transport, communications and housing.

Michael Lynch sees a new British state emerging in the wake of the Reform Act 1832. This began the widening of the electoral franchise, from less than 5,000 landholders, which was to continue with further acts in 1868 and 1884. Lynch argues that there were concentric identities for Scots, where &quot;a new Scottishness, a new Britishness and a revised sense of local pride – were held together by a phenomenon bigger than all of them – a Greater Britain whose stability rested on the Empire&quot;. Lynch also argues that the three main institutions which protected Scotland&#x27;s identity – the Church, education and the law – were all on the retreat in this period.

====Religious fragmentation====
The late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries saw a fragmentation of the Church of Scotland that had been created in the Reformation. These fractures were prompted by issues of government and patronage, but reflected a wider division between the Evangelicals and the Moderate Party over fears of fanaticism by the former and the acceptance of Enlightenment ideas by the latter. The legal right of lay patrons to present clergymen of their choice to local ecclesiastical livings led to minor schisms from the church. The first in 1733, known as the First Secession, led to the creation of a series of secessionist churches. The second in 1761 lead to the foundation of the independent Relief Church. Gaining strength in the Evangelical Revival of the later eighteenth century and after prolonged years of struggle, in 1834 the Evangelicals gained control of the General Assembly and passed the Veto Act, which allowed congregations to reject unwanted &quot;intrusive&quot; presentations to livings by patrons. The following &quot;Ten Years&#x27; Conflict&quot; of legal and political wrangling ended in defeat for the non-intrusionists in the civil courts. The result was a schism from the church by some of the non-intrusionists led by Dr Thomas Chalmers known as the Disruption of 1843. Roughly a third of the clergy, mainly from the North and Highlands, formed the separate Free Church of Scotland. In the late nineteenth century the major debates were between fundamentalist Calvinists and theological liberals, who rejected a literal interpretation of the Bible. This resulted in a further split in the Free Church as the rigid Calvinists broke away to form the Free Presbyterian Church in 1893. Until the Disruption the Church of Scotland had been seen as the religious expression of national identity and the guardian of Scotland&#x27;s morals. It had considerable control over moral discipline, schools and the poor law system, but after 1843 it was a minority church, with reduced moral authority and control of the poor and education.

In the late nineteenth century the established church began to recover, embarking on a programme of church building to rival the Free Church, increasing its number of parishes from 924 in 1843 to 1,437 by 1909. There were also moves towards reunion, beginning with the unification of some secessionist churches into the United Secession Church in 1820, which united with the Relief Church in 1847 to form the United Presbyterian Church, which in turn joined with the Free Church in 1900. The removal of legislation on lay patronage allowed the majority of the Free Church to rejoin Church of Scotland in 1929. The schisms left small denominations including the Free Presbyterians and a remnant as the Free Church from 1900.

====Education====
The Industrial Revolution and rapid urbanisation undermined the effectiveness of the Scottish church school system that had grown up since the Reformation, creating major gaps in provision and religious divisions would begin to undermine the unity of the system. The publication of George Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Scotland: a Half Educated Nation&quot; in 1834 began a major debate on the suitability of the parish school system, particularly in rapidly expanding urban areas. Aware of the growing shortfall in provision the Kirk set up an education committee in 1824. The committee had established 214 &quot;assembly schools&quot; between 1824 and 1865 and 120 &quot;sessional schools&quot;, were mainly established by kirk sessions in towns and aimed at the children of the poor. The Disruption of 1843 fragmented the kirk school system, with 408 teachers in schools joining the breakaway Free Church. By May 1847 it was claimed that 500 schools had been built by the new church, along with two teacher training colleges and a ministerial training college. The influx of large numbers of Irish immigrants in the nineteenth century led to the establishment of Catholic schools, particularly in the urban west of the country, beginning with Glasgow in 1817. The church schools system was now divided between three major bodies, the established Kirk, the Free Church and the Catholic Church. The perceived problems and fragmentation of the Scottish school system led to a process of secularisation, as the state took increasing control. From 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants, then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship. The 1861 Education Act removed the provision stating that Scottish teachers had to be members of the Church of Scotland or subscribe to the Westminster Confession. Under the 1872 Education (Scotland) Act, approximately 1,000 regional school boards were established, which took over the schools of the old and new kirks. and the boards undertook a major programme that created large numbers of grand, purpose-built schools. Overall administration was in the hands of the Scotch (later Scottish) Education Department in London.

====Law====

The union with England meant that Scottish law was perceived as being increasingly Anglicised. Particularly in the first third of the nineteenth century, there a number of reforms to the judicial system and legal procedure that brought it increasingly in to line with English practice, such as trial by jury in civil cases, which was introduced in 1814. As Home Secretary in the 1820s, Robert Peel justified changes on the grounds that the Scottish system was &quot;totally different from English practice and rather repugnant to English feelings&quot;. New areas of public policy that had not been part of Scottish law, in areas such as public health, working conditions, the protection of investors, were legislated for by the British Parliament, challenging the uniqueness of the Scottish system. In the late nineteenth century, commercial law saw increasing assimilation as Scottish law was replaced by increasingly English-based measures such as the Partnership Act 1890 and the Sale of Goods Act 1893. Lord Rosebery summed up the fears of Anglicisation in 1882, stating that the new legislation was framed on the principle that &quot;every part of the United Kingdom must be English, because it is part of the United Kingdom&quot;.

====Early nationalist movements====

Unlike many parts of continental Europe there was no major insurrection in Scotland in the 1840s and early moves toward nationalism tended to be aimed at improvement of the union, rather than its abolition. The first political organisation with such a nationalist agenda was the National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights, formed in 1853. It highlighted grievances, drew comparisons with the more generous treatment of Ireland and argued that there should be more Scottish MPs at Westminster. Having attracted few figures of significance the association was wound up in 1856, but it provided an agenda drawn upon by subsequent national movements. Resentment over the preferential deal discussed for Ireland during the Irish Home Rule debates in the later nineteenth century revived interest in constitutional reform and helped create a politically significant Scottish Home Rule movement. However, this was not a movement that aimed at independence. It argued for the devolution of Scottish business to Edinburgh to make Westminster more efficient and it was taken for granted that the union was vital to the progress and improvement of Scotland. Meanwhile, Scottish Highland crofters took inspiration from the Irish Land League set up to campaign for land reform in Ireland and defend the interests of Irish tenant farmers. Highlanders in turn founded the Highland Land League. The efforts for land reform in the Highlands expanded into a parliamentary arm of the movement, the Crofters Party. In the event, unlike the highly successful Irish Parliamentary Party, the new political party proved short-lived and was soon co-opted by the Liberal Party, but not before helping secure key concessions from the Liberals, which resulted in the rights of crofters becoming enshrined in law. Not all Scots saw common cause with Irish nationalism – the widely popular Scottish Unionist Association that emerged in 1912 from a merger of the Scottish Conservatives and Liberal Unionists referred to the Irish Union of 1801, while the union between Scotland and England was taken for granted and largely unthreatened.

===World Wars (1914–1960)===
Prior to the declaration of war resulting in World War I, Scotland was experiencing a significant shift in living standards and life in general, and a considerable amount of the population from the Scottish Highlands had begun to emigrate from Scotland to &quot;the new world&quot;. Within the country itself, there were developments in the field of education, with education now being provided for all children up to thirteen years of age, as well as advancements in medical technology and transportation links. Additionally, a greater investment in housing stock across Scottish towns and cities resulted in better quality housing and living conditions. The British Army was limited in terms of its size and personnel numbers before World War I, and like in previous battles, Scottish army personnel played a major role in the British Army and continued to be distinct from their counterparts as a resulting of wearing kilts and carrying bagpipes into war battles.

During World War II, Scotland, particularly the eastern coast, was considered a probable target for Nazi Germany bombing following the German occupation of Norway. As a result, enhanced deference measures were incorporated along the eastern Scottish coast, whilst additional measures were introduced in cities such as Glasgow to protect factories, shipyards and docks to ensure the continuation of production and the economy. 

====Economic conditions, 1914–1922====
Between 1906 and 1908, output of the Clyde shipbuilding industry declined by 50 per cent. At the time, the steel and engineering industries were also depressed. These were ominous signs for an economy based on eight staple industries (agriculture, coal mining, shipbuilding, engineering, textiles, building, steel, and fishing) which accounted for 60 per cent of Scotland&#x27;s industrial output. With 12.5 per cent of the UK production output and 10.5 per cent of its population, Scotland&#x27;s economy was a significant part of the overall British picture. Despite economic hardship, Scotland participated in World War I. Initially enthusiastic about the war, with Scotland mobilising 22 out of the 157 battalions which made up the British Expeditionary Force, concern about the wartime threat to an exporting economy soon came to the forefront. Fear that the war would lead to disastrous conditions for industrial areas, with increased unemployment, abated as the German offensive on the Western Front came to a halt. 

However, the textile industry was immediately impacted by 30-to-40-per cent increases in freight and insurance costs. Coal mining was also affected, since the German and Baltic markets disappeared during the war; the German market had consisted of 2.9 million tons. Enlistment resulted in a decline of efficiency, since the remaining miners were less skilled, older or in poor physical condition. The fishing industry was affected because the main importers of herring were Germany and Russia, and the war resulted in the enlistment of a large number of fishermen in the Royal Naval Reserve. Industries benefiting from the war were shipbuilding and munitions. Although they had a positive effect on employment, their production had a limited future; when the war ended in 1918, so did the orders which had kept the Clyde shipyards busy. The war scarred the Scottish economy for years to come.

The war brought a new desolation to the Scottish Highlands. Forests were cut, and death and migration ended traditional industries. Schemes were made to restore the area: reforestation, railway construction and industrialisation of the islands along a Scandinavian pattern emphasising deep-sea fishing. However, implementing the plans depended on continuing British economic prosperity. A reorganisation of the railways was critically important. The newly created Ministry of Transport suggested nationalising the railways with a separate, autonomous Scottish region. The scheme would greatly strain the Scottish railways, as had been seen under wartime national control (leading to upgraded maintenance and wages and a rise in expenses). A Scottish company would be forced to uphold the standards, although it would be carrying just over half the freight of the English railway. A campaign, headed by a coalition of Scottish MPs from the Labour, Liberal and Conservative parties, used the rhetoric of nationalism to secure the amalgamation of Scottish and English railways.

This was an example of how nationalism could be tied to economics; any economic disadvantage relative to the rest of the UK could be used by politicians to justify intervention by a devolved or independent administration. Scotland had been near a vote on devolution before the outbreak of World War I; although economic problems were not new, they were not a case for nationalism before 1914. Governmental intervention was social in nature from 1832 to 1914, when the major issues were social welfare and the educational system. Actions affecting the economy were not considered functions of government before 1914.

The Scottish electorate increased from 779,012 in 1910 to 2,205,383 in 1918 due to the Representation of the People Act 1918, which entitled women over 30 to vote and increased the number of male voters by 50 per cent. Although Labour had home rule on its program, supporting it with two planks (self-determination for the Scottish people and the restoration of Scotland to the Scottish people), the Unionists received 32 seats in the Commons—up from seven in 1910. The period following World War I was one of unprecedented depression because of the war&#x27;s impact on the economy.

====Economic conditions from 1922–1960====
The Scottish economy was heavily dependent on international trade. A decline in the trade would mean over capacity in shipping and a fall in owner&#x27;s profit. This again would lead to fewer orders for new ships, and this slump would then spread to the other heavy industries. In 1921 the shipbuilding industry had been hit by the combination of a vanishing naval market, the surplus of products of U.S. shipyards, and confiscated enemy ships.

Scotland needed to plan its way out of trouble. In 1930 the Labour government had, though it was considered a purely cosmetic move, encouraged regional industrial development groups, which led to the forming of the Scottish National Development Council (SNDC). The forming of the SNDC later led to the set up of the Scottish Economy Committee (SEC). Neither of these bodies sought a cure for Scotland&#x27;s ills by nationalist political solutions, and many of those who were actively involved in them joined in a comprehensive condemnation of any form of home rule. However, at the same time the secretary of the committee justified its existence by stating: &quot;It is undoubtedly true that Scotland&#x27;s national economy tends to pass unnoticed in the hands of the Ministry of Labour and the Board of Trade&quot;. Because increasing legislation required more Scottish statutes, the importance of the legal and the administrative in the years between the wars grew. The move of the administration to St. Andrew&#x27;s House was considered an important act, but while welcoming the move in 1937, Walter Elliot – the Secretary of State then – feared the changes:
&quot;[...] will not in themselves dispose of the problems whose solution a general improvement in Scottish social and economic conditions depends [...] it is the consciousness of their existence which is reflected in, not in the small and unimportant Nationalist Party, but in the dissatisfaction and uneasiness amongst moderate and reasonable people of every view or rank – a dissatisfaction expressed in every book published about Scotland now for several years&quot;.
As government began to play an increasingly interventionist role in the economy, it became easy to advocate a nationalist remedy to ensure that it was in whatever was deemed Scotland&#x27;s interest. As before 1914, the easy conditions of world trade after 1945 made Scottish industry prosper, and any need for drastic political interventions were postponed until the late 1950s, when the economic progress of Scotland started to deteriorate, and shipbuilding and engineering companies were forced to shut down. But even if the decline in the late 1950s meant an increasing degree of intervention from the government, there was no evidence of any other political change. Even the Scottish Council&#x27;s inquiry into the Scottish economy in 1960 was specific: &quot;The proposal for a Scottish Parliament [...] implies constitutional changes of a kind that place it beyond our remit although it is fair to say that we do not regard it as a solution&quot;.

====Literary renaissance====

While the post 1914 period appears to have been devoted to the economic questions and problems of Scotland, it also saw the birth of a Scottish literary renaissance in the 1924–1934 decade.

In the late eighteenth and nineteenth century, industrialisation had swept across Scotland with great speed. Such was the rate of industrialisation that the Scottish society had failed to adequately adapt to the massive changes which industrialisation had brought. The Scottish intelligentsia was overwhelmed by the growth of the Scottish industrial revolution, and the new entrepreneurial bourgeoisie linked to it. It was &quot;deprived of its typical nationalist role. [...] There was no call for its usual services&quot;.

One of the first to recognise this &quot;lack of teeth&quot; was the poet Hugh MacDiarmid. MacDiarmid, both a nationalist and a socialist, saw the parochialism of the Scottish literature as a sign of English hegemony, hence it had to be destroyed. He tried to do this through his poetry, and used his own reworking of old Scots or &quot;Lallans&quot; (Lowland Scots) in the tradition of Robert Burns instead of Scots Gaelic or standard English. MacDiarmid&#x27;s &quot;crusade&quot; brought along other writers and poets, like Lewis Grassic Gibbon and Edwin Muir; but this literary renaissance lasted only for about ten years.

===1960–present day===

Research conducted by the Scottish Social Attitudes Survey in 1979 found that more than 95% of those living in Scotland identified as &quot;Scottish&quot; in varying degrees, with more than 80% identifying themselves as &quot;British&quot; in varying degrees. When forced to choose a single national identity between &quot;Scottish&quot; and &quot;British&quot;, 57% identified as Scottish and 39% identified as British. British national identity entered a sharp decline in Scotland from 1979 until the advent of devolution in 1999. In 2000, when forced to choose a single national identity between &quot;Scottish&quot; and &quot;British&quot;, 80% identified as Scottish and only 13% identified as British, however 60% still identified as British to some degree.

Polling conducted since 2014 has indicated that when forced to choose between &quot;Scottish&quot; and &quot;British&quot; identities, British national identity has risen to between 31–36% in Scotland and Scottish national identity has fallen to between 58–62%. Other national identities such as &quot;European&quot; and &quot;English&quot; have remained fairly static in Scotland since 1999 at between 1–2%.

Amongst the most commonly cited reasons for the rise in Scottish national identity and the coinciding decline in British national identity in Scotland between 1979 and 1999 is the premiership of Margaret Thatcher between 1979 and 1990 and the subsequent premiership of John Major from 1999 to 1997: Conservative Party prime ministers who finished second behind the Labour Party in Scotland though won the ballot across the UK as a whole and implemented unpopular policies such as the ill-fated poll tax in Scotland. The establishment of a devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999 and the holding of a referendum on Scottish independence in 2014 have been recognised as factors contributing to a gradual rise in British national identity in Scotland and a decline in Scottish national identity since 1999.

====Devolution====
====Scottish National Party and Scottish independence====

The Scottish National Party (SNP) is a political party which seeks to withdraw Scotland from the United Kingdom in favour of forming an independent state. The party sat on the fringes of politics in Scotland after losing the Motherwell parliamentary constituency at the 1945 general election, until the party won a by-election in the Labour stronghold of Hamilton in 1967. At the subsequent 1970 general election, the party gained its first seat in a UK Parliamentary election in the Western Isles.

In 1970, large quantities of oil were discovered off the coast of Scotland. The SNP exploited this with their highly successful &quot;It&#x27;s Scotland&#x27;s Oil&quot; campaign: arguing that during the 1973–75 recession that the oil would belong within the territorial boundaries of an independent Scotland and would help to mitigate the effects of the economic recession in Scotland should Scotland become independent. The party won 7 seats and 21.9% of the vote in the February 1974 general election and won 11 seats and 30.4% of the vote in the October 1974 general election, before losing the vast majority of their seats to Labour and the Conservatives in 1979.

A referendum was held on Scottish devolution in 1979, which would result in the establishment of a devolved autonomous Scottish Assembly, however the referendum failed to pass as despite a narrow lead for the devolution side, with 52% in favour of devolution, a low turnout of 32.9% of the entire Scottish electorate failed to meet the required 40% turnout threshold set out by the UK Parliament for the election outcome to be valid.

The establishment of a devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999 has since provided the SNP with a platform to win elections in Scotland, forming a minority government from 2007 until 2011, and a majority government from 2011 until 2016, during which time the Parliament approved the holding of a referendum on Scottish independence from the UK which was held with the consent of the United Kingdom government. The referendum was held on 18 September 2014, with 55.3% voting against independence and 44.7% voting in favour on a high turnout of 84.6%.

The vast majority of those identifying their national identity more as &quot;British&quot; support Scotland remaining a part of the United Kingdom, with a smaller majority of those identifying their national identity more as &quot;Scottish&quot; supporting Scottish independence. However, many independence supporters also identify as &quot;British&quot; in varying degrees, with a majority of those describing their national identity as &quot;More Scottish than British&quot; being supportive of Scottish independence.

The SNP returned to office as a minority government in 2016. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland from 2014 to 2023, said in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 UK EU membership referendum that a second referendum on Scottish independence was &quot;highly likely&quot; after Scotland voted to remain within the EU on a margin of 62% remain to 38% leave, despite a UK-wide result of 52% leave; however, she subsequently put the plans on hold after facing a setback at the 2017 general election where the SNP lost 21 out of its 56 seats from 2015 and saw its vote share fall from 50.0% to 36.9%. However, in the 2019 general election, the SNP won 48 of Scotland&#x27;s 59 seats, with the SNP&#x27;s manifesto stating &quot;It’s a vote for Scotland’s right to choose our own future in a new independence referendum.&quot;

==Cultural icons==
Cultural icons in Scotland have changed over the centuries, e.g., the first national instrument was the clàrsach or Celtic harp until it was replaced by the Great Highland bagpipe in the fifteenth century. Symbols like tartan, the kilt and bagpipes are widely but not universally liked by Scots; their establishment as symbols for the whole of Scotland, especially in the Lowlands, dates back to the early nineteenth century. This was the age of pseudo-pageantry: the visit of King George IV to Scotland organised by Sir Walter Scott. Scott, very much a Unionist and a Tory, was at the same time a great populariser of Scottish mythology through his writings.

<text>Portsmouth was a fishing and shipping village located on Portsmouth Island on the Core Banks in North Carolina, United States. Portsmouth Island is a tidal island connected, under most conditions, to the northern end of the North Core Banks, across Ocracoke Inlet from the village of Ocracoke. The town lies in Carteret County, was established in 1753 by the North Carolina Colonial Assembly, and abandoned in 1971. Its remains are now part of the Cape Lookout National Seashore.

==History==
Ocracoke Inlet was a popular shipping lane during colonial times. Established in 1753, the town of Portsmouth functioned as a lightering port, where cargo from ocean-going vessels could be transferred to shallow-draft vessels capable of traversing Pamlico and Core Sounds. Portsmouth grew to a peak population of 685 in 1860. Though small, Portsmouth was one of the most important points-of-entry along the Atlantic coast in post-Revolutionary America.

In 1846, two strong hurricanes cut Oregon Inlet and deepened the existing Hatteras Inlet to the northeast, making Ocracoke Inlet a less desirable shipping lane by comparison. The waters around Portsmouth&#x27;s harbor also began to shoal up, hastening its decline as a port. The Civil War was yet another blow as many people fled to the mainland when Union soldiers came to occupy the Outer Banks. Many didn&#x27;t return after the war had ended and the Village of Portsmouth continued its decline, sped along by the occasional hurricane. The mammoth 1933 Atlantic hurricane season also served as a benchmark in the island&#x27;s population decline, though more as a focal point of memory and a symbol of decline than the real cause of it. (These were the same hurricanes that led to the depopulation of the barrier islands on the Eastern Shore of Virginia and Maryland.)

A further blow was the decommissioning of the US Life-Saving Station there in 1937, and closing of the post office in 1959. In 1967 Portsmouth Island and village had already been acquired by the National Park Service, then incorporated into the new Cape Lookout National Seashore. The last two elderly residents, Marian Gray Babb and Nora Dixon, left the island in 1971 after the death of Henry Pigott, who although approximately the same age was essentially their caretaker.

In 1978 Portsmouth Village was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

==Life in Portsmouth==
The inhabitants of Portsmouth Village were heavily engaged in fishing and other maritime trades, like piloting and manning vessels, even building a small man-made island, Shell Castle, out of oyster shells for use as a shipping depot. Later many worked as fisherman and clammers. Much of Portsmouth&#x27;s population was African American descending from the slaves brought to the island. After the Civil War most African Americans left Portsmouth but some families remained including Pigott family whose descendants were some of the island&#x27;s last inhabitants: Henry and Lizzie Pigott. Under segregation, black and white children could not legally attend the one-room schoolhouse on Portsmouth Island together. The state never built a separate school for Blacks, so African Americans who remained on the island in its declining years never received the benefits of a formal education.

Inhabitants of the island lived without electricity, running water or refrigeration.

==Portsmouth today==
Now, 21 total buildings stand, including about a dozen dwellings and a few out-buildings. These are maintained as part of the Portsmouth Village Historic District. Of these the Salter House/visitor center, the one-room school, the Methodist Church, the Life-Saving Station, Henry Pigott&#x27;s house and the Post Office/general store are open to the public during the summer. Now, especially during the summers, people often visit the island and camp out overnight on the beach (camping is not allowed in the village). Facilities are very limited with a compost toilet near the Life-Saving Station and a restroom in the Salter house/visitors center, with no potable water, food, or electricity available.

==Homecoming==
Portsmouth is the location of an increasingly well-known &quot;homecoming,&quot; currently celebrated every two years. The island homecoming has its origins in the early trips made back to the island by families who left prior to the 1960s and was originally affiliated with the Methodist and Primitive Baptist churches, primarily out of Cedar Island, North Carolina, where many inhabitants of Portsmouth had resettled. The homecoming began as a church- and family-based event but has become increasingly a secular celebration of Portsmouth&#x27;s heritage, under the aegis of the National Park Service. Many people who have no direct family connection to the island participate in the homecoming.

==Access==

Portsmouth is reached by a passenger ferry from Ocracoke village. It is also accessible by four wheel drive vehicles, which cross Core Sound by ferry from Atlantic and use the beach and tracks on North Core Banks.

==Portsmouth Island==
Portsmouth Island lies to the east of North Core Banks, to which it is connected at most states of the tide. The limits of the island are not precisely determined and have varied over time. Older maps use the term for the island between Ocracoke Inlet and Whalebone Inlet (which closed in 1961, now the northern end of North Core Banks.)

==Climate==

According to the Trewartha climate classification system, Portsmouth, North Carolina has a humid subtropical climate with hot and humid summers, cool winters and year-around precipitation (&quot;Cfak&quot;). Cfak climates are characterized by all months having an average mean temperature &gt; 32.0 °F (&gt; 0.0 °C), at least eight months with an average mean temperature ≥ 50.0 °F (≥ 10.0 °C), at least one month with an average mean temperature ≥ 71.6 °F (≥ 22.0 °C) and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. During the summer months in Portsmouth, a cooling afternoon sea breeze is present on most days, but episodes of extreme heat and humidity can occur with heat index values ≥ 100 °F (≥ 38 °C). Portsmouth is prone to hurricane strikes, particularly during the Atlantic hurricane season which extends from June 1 through November 30, sharply peaking from late August through September. During the winter months, episodes of cold and wind can occur with wind chill values &lt; 15 °F (&lt; -9 °C). The plant hardiness zone in Portsmouth is 8b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 17.5 °F (-8.1 °C). The average seasonal (Dec-Mar) snowfall total is &lt; 2 inches (&lt; 5 cm), and the average annual peak in nor&#x27;easter activity is in February.
 


==Ecology==

According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Portsmouth, North Carolina would have a dominant vegetation type of Live oak/Sea Oats Uniola paniculata (&quot;90&quot;) with a dominant vegetation form of Coastal Prairie (&quot;20&quot;).

<doc id="1059280" wikidata="Q267672" url="?curid=1059280" title="Superman II">
<text>Superman II is a 1980 superhero film directed by Richard Lester and written by Mario Puzo and David and Leslie Newman from a story by Puzo based on the DC Comics character Superman. It is the second installment in the &quot;Superman&quot; film series and a sequel to &quot;Superman&quot; (1978). A direct continuation of the first &quot;Superman&quot;, Christopher Reeve reprises his role as Superman. The returning cast includes Gene Hackman, Terence Stamp, Ned Beatty, Sarah Douglas, Margot Kidder, Marc McClure and Jack O&#x27;Halloran.

The film&#x27;s plot features the arrival of General Zod &amp; his comrades on Earth, following their release from the Phantom Zone (a prison that had been made by the people of Krypton). Zod seeks revenge for imprisonment by pursuing the planet&#x27;s last son, Kal-El, alias “Superman.” As a result, Kal-El, who had unknowingly freed them, must now face threats from his long-dead home planet. Zod also allies with Lex Luthor, who still aspires to world domination. The hero also faces an internal conflict, torn between his duties as Earth&#x27;s hero and his desire to live amongst them solely as Clark Kent, and especially with his love interest, Lois Lane.

In 1977, producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind decided that they would film &quot;Superman&quot; and its sequel simultaneously; principal photography began in March 1977 and ended in October 1978. Tensions rose between original director Richard Donner and the producers, as a result of which a decision was made to stop filming the sequel, 75 percent of which had already been completed, and simply finish the first film. After the release of &quot;Superman&quot; in December 1978, Donner was fired as director (a controversial decision) and replaced by Lester. Several members of the cast and crew declined to return to complete the sequel in the wake of Donner&#x27;s firing. In order to be officially credited as the director, Lester re-shot most of the film: principal photography resumed in September 1979 and ended in March 1980.

The film was released in Australia and most of Europe on December 4, 1980, and in other countries in 1981. It received positive reviews from film critics, who praised the performances of Hackman, Kidder, Stamp and Reeve, as well as the visual effects and the humor. It grossed $216 million worldwide against a production budget of $54 million, which meant it was a box office success, albeit less so than its predecessor. A sequel, &quot;Superman III&quot;, was released in June 1983, for which Lester returned as director.

A director&#x27;s cut of the film, restoring the original vision for the film under Donner&#x27;s supervision, titled &quot;Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut&quot;, was released on November 28, 2006, in various home media formats.

== Plot ==

&quot;The following synopsis reflects the original theatrical version of the film.&quot;
Before the destruction of Krypton, the criminals General Zod, Ursa and Non are sentenced to banishment into the Phantom Zone. Years later, the Phantom Zone is shattered near Earth by the shockwave of a hydrogen bomb, thrown from Earth by Superman. The three criminals are freed and find themselves with superpowers granted by the yellow light of the Sun. After landing on the Moon and effortlessly killing a team of astronauts exploring there, they continue toward Earth with plans to conquer the planet.

The &quot;Daily Planet&quot; sends journalist Clark Kent—whose secret identity is Superman—and his colleague Lois Lane to Niagara Falls. Lois suspects Clark and Superman are the same person after Clark is absent when Superman saves a child. Lois intentionally places herself in the falls, but Clark saves her without exposing himself. That night, Clark trips, and his hand lands in a lit fireplace. When Lois sees that his hand is unscathed, Clark reveals that he is indeed Superman. He takes her to his Fortress of Solitude in the Arctic, showing her the traces of his past stored within energy crystals. Superman declares his love for Lois and his wish to spend his life with her. After conferring with the artificial intelligence of his mother Lara, Superman removes his superpowers by exposing himself to red Kryptonian sunlight in a crystal chamber, becoming a mortal. Clark and Lois spend the night together, then leave the Fortress and return from the Arctic.

Meanwhile, Zod and his cohorts travel to the White House and force the President of the United States to surrender. Clark and Lois arrive at a diner in Alaska, where a trucker named Rocky sexually harasses Lois and beats up Clark to a bloodied pulp, Rocky then leaves the diner, while Lois tries to help Clark with his wounds, the owner of the diner turns on the TV and the President makes a speech which was interrupted by Zod, Clark looks up at the TV and realizes that Zod, Ursa, and Non had taken over the planet. The President then asks for Superman&#x27;s help and then Zod challenges Superman. Clark realizes that he made a terrible mistake, he tells Lois that he has to go back to the Fortress to restore the powers so he can save the planet and defeat Zod, Lois tells him that it&#x27;s too late for him to do it, but Clark then returns to the Fortress and finds the original green crystal that Lois left on the floor, sparing it when the control module and all the other crystals are destroyed after Superman becomes human.

Lex Luthor escapes from prison with Eve Teschmacher&#x27;s help. They infiltrate the Fortress of Solitude, and Luthor learns of Superman&#x27;s connection to Jor-El and General Zod. He finds Zod at the White House and tells him Superman is the son of Jor-El, their jailer, and offers to lead him to Superman in exchange for control of Australia. The three Kryptonians ally with Luthor and go to the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. Superman arrives, after restoring his powers, and battles the three. Zod realizes that Superman cares for the humans and takes advantage by threatening bystanders. Superman realizes the only way to stop Zod and the others is to lure them to the Fortress so he flies off with Zod, Ursa, and Non in pursuit, kidnapping Lois and taking along Luthor. Superman tries to get Luthor to lure the three into the crystal chamber to depower them. However, Luthor reveals the chamber&#x27;s secret to the villains. Zod forces Superman into the chamber and activates it. Afterwards, assuming him deprived of his powers, Zod tells Superman to kneel, take his hand and swear eternal loyalty to him; instead, Superman crushes Zod&#x27;s hand and tosses him into a crevice. Luthor deduces that Superman reconfigured the chamber to expose the trio to red sunlight while Superman was protected from it. Non falls into another crevice when trying to fly over it, and Lois knocks Ursa into a third. Superman flies back to civilization, returning Lois home and leaving Lex stranded in the Fortress.

At the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; the following day, Clark kisses Lois, using his abilities to wipe her mind of the knowledge of her past few days. Later, he returns to the diner and gets even with Rocky. Superman restores the damage done by Zod, replacing the American flag atop the White House, and tells the President he will not abandon his duty again.

== Cast ==
* Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor: Criminal genius and Superman&#x27;s archnemesis. Armed with vast resources and scientific brilliance, Luthor&#x27;s contempt for mankind is only surpassed by his hatred for Superman. Luthor strikes a bargain with the three Kryptonian criminals in an effort to destroy Superman.
* Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent / Superman: Born on Krypton and raised on Earth, Superman is a being of immense strength, speed, and power. Morally upstanding and instilled with a strong sense of duty, Superman tirelessly uses his formidable powers, which he gets from the Earth&#x27;s yellow Sun, to protect the people of his adoptive homeworld. His alter ego is mild-mannered &quot;Daily Planet&quot; reporter Clark Kent. Superman&#x27;s abilities include: X-ray and heat vision, vast strength, speed and invulnerability, super-intelligence and flight.
* Ned Beatty as Otis: Luthor&#x27;s incompetent henchman.
* Jackie Cooper as Perry White: Mercurial editor-in-chief of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; newspaper and Lois and Clark&#x27;s boss.
* Sarah Douglas as Ursa: Zod&#x27;s second-in-command and consort. Ursa&#x27;s evil will and power-lust are equal to and sometimes surpass those of General Zod. Her contempt and utter disregard for humans, men in particular, make her a very deadly adversary. She has an inclination to collect insignia and heraldry from people she defeats or dominates, such as the NASA patch from the EVA suit of an astronaut she kills.
* Margot Kidder as Lois Lane: The ace reporter for the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; and Superman&#x27;s love interest. Lois is a driven career journalist, who lets nothing stand in the way of breaking the next big story and scooping rival reporters while ignoring the potential consequences that sometimes put her in peril. She finds out that Clark is Superman, but her memory is erased when Clark kisses her.
* Jack O&#x27;Halloran as Non: The third of the Kryptonian criminals, Non is &quot;as without thought as he is without voice.&quot; At tall, Non is a formidable hulking mute who easily matches Superman&#x27;s strength, but has the intelligence and sometimes curiosity of a child, and communicates only with guttural grunts and growls. Though he lacks the mental ability to use his powers effectively, he does however possess the same taste for destruction as his Kryptonian companions and his physical strength is even greater than Zod and Ursa&#x27;s.
* Valerie Perrine as Eve Teschmacher: Lex Luthor&#x27;s beautiful assistant and girlfriend who helps him escape from prison.
* Susannah York as Lara: Jor-El&#x27;s wife and Superman&#x27;s biological mother.
* Clifton James as Sheriff.
* E.G. Marshall as the President of the United States.
* Marc McClure as Jimmy Olsen: Young photographer at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;.
* Terence Stamp as General Zod: The ruthless, arrogant and leader of three Kryptonian criminals banished to the Phantom Zone and unwittingly set free by Superman. Zod, upon landing on Earth and gaining the same superpowers as Superman, immediately views humans as a weak and insignificant sub-species and imposes his evil will for world dominance. However, his arrogance causes him to quickly become bored with his powers and he is almost disappointed at how little of a challenge humans are. His insatiable lust for power is replaced however by revenge when he learns that the son of Jor-El stands in the way of his absolute rule of the planet.

According to the 2006 documentary &quot;You Will Believe: The Cinematic Saga of Superman&quot;, Sarah Douglas was the only cast member to do extensive around-the-world press tours in support of the film and was one of the few actors who held a neutral point of view in the .

Richard Donner briefly appears in a &quot;walking cameo&quot; in the film. In the sequence where the de-powered Clark and Lois are seen approaching the truck-stop diner by car, Donner appears walking &quot;camera left&quot; past the driver&#x27;s side. He is wearing a light tan jacket and appears to be smoking a pipe. In his commentary for &quot;Superman II&quot;, Ilya Salkind states that the inclusion of his cameo in that scene is proof that the Salkinds held no animosity towards Donner, because if there were, then surely they would have cut it out. Conversely, Donner used his cameo to debunk praise heaped on Lester around the release of the film where Lester took credit for the intense nature of the &quot;bully&quot; scene in the diner, pointing out that he (Donner) filmed the scene and not Lester.

== Production history ==

=== Original production ===
Principal photography for both &quot;Superman&quot; films began on March 28, 1977 at Pinewood Studios for the Krypton scenes, but by May 1977, production had run two weeks behind schedule. It was reported that Donner had developed tensions with Alexander and Ilya Salkind and Pierre Spengler concerning the escalating production budget and production schedule. Donner responded by claiming he was never given a budget.

In July 1977, Richard Lester—who had previously directed &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot; (1974) for the Salkinds—came onboard the project as an uncredited associate producer and intermediary on &quot;Superman&quot; to mediate the relationship between Donner and the Salkinds, who were no longer on speaking terms. Prior to this, Lester had won a lawsuit against the Salkinds for money still owed to him from making the films, but the assets were held in legal entanglements in the Bahamas. The Salkinds then offered to compensate him if he would help on the &quot;Superman&quot; films, in which Lester became a second unit director where he and Donner formed an effective partnership.

By October 1977, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, and Valerie Perrine had completed their scenes. They were all under contract to finish both pictures. Nevertheless, with months left of filming, the Salkinds had halted filming &quot;Superman II&quot;, of which Donner had shot 75 percent, to focus on finishing &quot;Superman&quot;. During the pause in filming, the Salkinds agreed to a negative pickup deal with Warner Bros. Pictures, granting the studio rights to foreign distribution and television airings in exchange for more financing.

=== Replacing Richard Donner ===
Following the release of &quot;Superman&quot; in December 1978, Spengler encountered &quot;Variety&quot; columnist Army Archerd at a Christmas party at which he confirmed that while there had been tension between him and Donner, he was proud of the film and looked forward to working with him on the sequel. Archerd then contacted Donner who responded &quot;If he&#x27;s on it—I&#x27;m not.&quot; Two days after the first film&#x27;s general release, Marlon Brando had sued the Salkinds for $50 million claiming he had never received his percentage of the film&#x27;s gross and filed a restraining order to prevent the use of his likeness. While his restraining order request was thrown out, Brando received $15 million from the settlement. Following this, producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind announced that Marlon Brando&#x27;s completed scenes for &quot;Superman II&quot; would be excised from the movie to avoid having to pay the actor the reported 11.75% of gross U.S. box-office takings he was now demanding for his performance in the sequel. In addition to this, Ilya Salkind had also claimed Brando was removed due to creative differences, in which he suggested to his father: &quot;What if it&#x27;s the mother [instead]? She talks about love to her son. And it kind of made sense creatively...Jor-El had done his thing if you want.&quot; Donner publicly lambasted this decision, in which he told &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;That means no games... They have to want me to do it. It has to be on my terms and I don&#x27;t mean financially. I mean control.&quot;

As Donner had become unavailable because he was promoting &quot;Superman&quot; in Europe, the Salkinds approached Guy Hamilton to take over directional reins for &quot;Superman II&quot; since Lester was filming &quot;Cuba&quot; (1979) at the time. Hamilton was unavailable, but by the time &quot;Superman II&quot; was ready to begin filming, Lester had completed &quot;Cuba&quot; and was available to direct. Eventually, on March 15, 1979, the Salkinds decided to replace Donner with Richard Lester. Donner recalled, &quot;One day, I got a telegram from them saying my services are no longer needed and that my dear friend Richard Lester would take over. To this day, I have not heard from them.&quot; Ilya Salkind countered, &quot;Dick Donner said, &#x27;I will do the second movie on my terms and without [Pierre] Spengler&#x27; ... Spengler was my friend since childhood and my father and I were very loyal guys. We said no, and it really boiled down to that.&quot;

The decision to replace Donner was controversial amongst the cast and crew. Creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz was approached by Terry Semel, then a Warner Bros. vice president, to return for the sequel, but he declined out of loyalty to Donner. Mankiewicz recounted, &quot;I have a lot of respect for [Lester]. Friendship is more important than anything. And Dick [Donner] brought me on the picture and my loyalty was with Dick and I couldn&#x27;t believe that they fired him.&quot; Editor Stuart Baird also declined to return for the sequel. Gene Hackman declined to return for re-shoots, which necessitated the use of a body double and a voice impersonator for several scenes.

=== Production under Richard Lester ===
To replace Mankiewicz, &quot;Superman&quot; co-screenwriters David and Leslie Newman were then brought back to re-tool the script constructing a new opening and ending. The new script featured newly conceived scenes such as a new opening involving Superman thwarting the nuclear terrorists at the Eiffel Tower, Clark rescuing Lois at Niagara Falls, and a new ending in which Clark causes Lois to forget his secret identity through a hypnotic kiss. Furthermore, cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth had died before the release of &quot;Superman&quot;. Now director, Lester was not sympathetic to Donner&#x27;s filmmaking style: &quot;Donner was emphasizing a kind of grandiose myth. There was a kind of David Lean-ish attempt in several sequences, and enormous scale. There was a type of epic quality which isn&#x27;t in my nature, so my work really didn&#x27;t embrace that...That&#x27;s not me. That&#x27;s his vision of it. I&#x27;m more quirky and I play around with slightly more unexpected silliness.&quot; Lester then brought on cinematographer Robert Paynter to have the film evoke the garish color scheme of the comics. Another replacement happened when set designer John Barry suddenly collapsed on the nearby set of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) and died from meningitis. Peter Murton was then hired in Barry&#x27;s place.

Before filming was to begin, Christopher Reeve was initially unavailable as he had agreed to star in the film &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;, five months into the production shutdown by which time his contract to shoot both &quot;Superman&quot; films back-to-back had expired. Reeve had claimed that twelve hours after his casting was announced, he received a letter from the producers to be available for &quot;Superman II&quot; on July 16, which was only five days after he was to finish filming &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;. In March 1979, the Salkinds filed suit against Reeve alleging he had breached his contract by walking off the sequel. Furthermore, Reeve had reservations with Lester and the Newmans&#x27; script following the departure of Donner. During the renegotiation of his contract, Reeve agreed to the financial terms, but demanded more artistic control.

Filming for &quot;Superman II&quot; re-commenced in September 1979 at Pinewood Studios. The remaining sequences left to be shot included the scenes of the super-villains in Midwest America and the battle in Metropolis. With Brando cut from the film, the decision was made to re-shoot the scene in which Clark confesses his love for Lois and surrender his powers. Another scene, as written in the film&#x27;s original shooting script and shot, was to have Jor-El restore his superpowers by reaching out to him in a tableau reminiscent of the painting &quot;The Creation of Adam&quot;, but the younger Salkind felt it was over the top. The first scene was re-shot with actress Susannah York taking Brando&#x27;s place while the restoration of Superman&#x27;s powers would take place off-screen. Location shooting took place in Canada, Paris, Norway and Saint Lucia. The Metropolis scenes—in contrast to the first film where they were filmed on location in New York—were filmed entirely on the back lot at Pinewood. The East Houston, Idaho scenes were shot on Chobham Common in Surrey, 30 miles from London. Throughout filming, Lester opted to retain his directorial technique for the three-camera setup while shooting scenes, which frustrated the actors as they did not know from where they were being filmed for their close-ups. However, Reeve noted that it made the production move at a faster pace. Filming was completed on March 10, 1980.

Due to budgetary reasons and actors being unavailable, key scenes filmed by Donner were added to the final film. Since the Lester footage was shot two years later, continuity errors are present in the physique and styling of stars Margot Kidder and Christopher Reeve. In Donner&#x27;s footage, Reeve appears less bulked as he was still gaining muscle for the part. Kidder also has dramatic changes throughout; in the montage of Lester–Donner material, shot inside the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; and the Fortress of Solitude near the movie&#x27;s conclusion, her hairstyle, hair color, and even make-up are all inconsistent. Kidder&#x27;s physical appearance in the Lester footage is noticeably different; during the scenes shot for Donner she appears slender, whereas in the Lester footage she looks thinner.

Before the film&#x27;s release, Warner Bros. had appealed to the Directors Guild of America to arbitrate the appropriate co-director credit, in which they argued Lester could not be credited unless he shot 40 percent of the film. Although Lester had earlier thought he would not be credited, he approached Donner to see if he wished to be credited as co-director. Donner replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t share credit&quot;.

== Music ==

Composer John Williams was originally slated to score &quot;Superman II&quot;, whereby he was given a screening with Ilya Salkind and Richard Lester. When Salkind left the projection room, Williams and Lester fell into an argument; when Salkind returned, Williams told him that he &quot;could not get along with this man.&quot; To take his place, Richard Lester&#x27;s frequent composer Ken Thorne was selected to score the sequel. Thorne wrote minimal original material and adapted source music, such as Average White Band&#x27;s &quot;Pick Up the Pieces,&quot; which appears both in the restaurant in Idaho and during Clark&#x27;s second encounter with Rocky in the Alaska diner. The music was performed at the CTS Studios, Wembley, London in the Spring of 1980 by a studio session orchestra (rather than the London Symphony Orchestra, which had played for the first film). The soundtrack was released on Warner Bros. Records, with one edition featuring laser-etched &quot;S&quot; designs repeated five times on each side.

A complete score was released in 2008, as part of &quot;Superman: The Music--1978-1988&quot;, an 8-CD box set released by Film Score Monthly, with a limited edition of 6,000 units.

As part of Superman&#x27;s 80th anniversary, La-La Land Records released Thorne&#x27;s expanded orchestral scores for the second and third film into the expanded archival collection in October 2018.

== Release ==
During a preview of the finished film, Warner Bros. executives had hoped to maximize its box office returns by releasing the film in every part of the world during their peak movie-going period. The film premiered in Australia on Thursday, December 4, 1980, and opened at the weekend in South Africa, followed by France on December 10 with Christmastime releases in Italy and Spain. The film opened in the United Kingdom and West Germany in Easter 1981. On June 1, 1981, the film premiered at the National Theater in New York City, and received its general release in 1,354 theaters in the United States and Canada on June 19—six months after its release in other parts of the world.

=== Marketing ===
To promote the film, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Warner Bros. had licensees for 34 products including posters, Pepsi-Cola, pajamas, and T-shirts with Superman carrying the American flag. They had also enlisted their publishing division to produce calendars, pop-up books, a film novelization, a behind-the-scenes book, and a children&#x27;s dictionary.

Before production on &quot;Superman II&quot; resumed in 1979, the Philip Morris Company had paid $40,000 (£30,570) for their Marlboro cigarette to appear in the film. Lois Lane was shown as a chain smoker in the film, although she never smoked in the comic book. During the Metropolis battle, General Zod throws Superman into a Marlboro delivery truck, although actual vehicles for tobacco distribution are unmarked for security reasons. This led to a congressional investigation.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Superman II&quot; has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;The humor occasionally stumbles into slapstick territory, and the special effects are dated, but &quot;Superman II&quot; meets, if not exceeds, the standard set by its predecessor.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 83 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, who gave the original film very high acclaim, also praised &quot;Superman II&quot;, giving it four out of four stars. He wrote in his review, &quot;This movie&#x27;s most intriguing insight is that Superman&#x27;s disguise as Clark Kent isn&#x27;t a matter of looks as much as of mental attitude: Clark is disguised not by his glasses but by his ordinariness. Beneath his meek exterior, of course, is concealed a superhero. And, the movie subtly hints, isn&#x27;t that the case with us all?&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded three-and-a-half out of four stars and declared it &quot;better than the original.&quot; Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;the most interesting &#x27;Superman&#x27; yet,&quot; adding, &quot;This film&#x27;s fun comes from character, dialogue and performance, not effects. There are, of course, enough effects to fill a dozen Saturday matinee serials but they aren&#x27;t necessarily the film&#x27;s deliciousness.&quot;

Janet Maslin, reviewing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote that &quot;&quot;Superman II&quot; is a marvelous toy. It&#x27;s funny, it&#x27;s full of tricks and it manages to be royally entertaining, which is really all it aims for.&quot; She also praised the performances of Reeve and Hackman and found the directing style between Donner and Lester to be indistinguishable. Similarly, David Denby, reviewing for the &quot;New York&quot; magazine, praised the film&#x27;s light approach and Hackman&#x27;s performance. Christopher John, reviewing the film in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot;, commented that &quot;&quot;Superman II&quot; falls into the category of sequels containing such films as &quot;Jaws 2&quot; - highly absorbing and entertaining, yet better films only if you never saw the original.&quot;

British cinema magazine &quot;Total Film&quot; named Terence Stamp&#x27;s version of General Zod No. 32 on their &#x27;Top 50 Greatest Villains of All Time&#x27; list (beating out the No. 38 place of Lex Luthor) in 2007. Pop culture website IGN placed General Zod at No. 30 on their list of the &#x27;Top 50 Comic Book Villains&#x27; while commenting &quot;Stamp &quot;is&quot; Zod&quot; (emphasis in original).

=== Box office ===
The film opened on 19 screens in Australia and grossed A$287,072 in its first four days. On its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, &quot;Superman II&quot; broke box office records with a first day gross of $4.3 million. The next day, it grossed $5.5 million, which at the time was the highest-single box office day, surpassing the record previously set by &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) with $4.5 million. It also recorded the highest-grossing weekend up to that time with $14.1 million, surpassing the record $11.9 million set by &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979) and the $13.1 million 4-day weekend set by &quot;Superman&quot; in its third weekend.

The film remained number one for the next three weekends, outpacing &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, but &quot;Raiders&quot; eventually overtook it and returned to number one in its sixth week of release. In its first month of release, &quot;Superman II&quot; had grossed $75 million, and went on to gross $108.2 million in the United States and Canada (with the gross rental coming to $65 million), the third highest-grossing film of 1981. Internationally, it grossed $108.2 million for a worldwide total of $216.3 million.

== Awards and nominations ==
== Broadcast television versions ==
As with the first film, Alexander and Ilya Salkind prepared a version for worldwide television release that re-inserted unused footage (in this case 24 minutes) into the film. It was through this extended version that viewers first caught a glimpse into the &quot;Superman II&quot; that might have happened had Richard Donner remained as director. In fact, a majority of the added footage was shot by Donner before Richard Lester became director.

17 of the 24 added minutes were utilized by ABC for its 1984 network premiere. Subsequent ABC airings of the longer version would be cut further for more advertising time. The full 146-minute extended cut was shown internationally, including parts of Canada.

=== Additional footage ===
The added footage offers an alternative ending to the film. In the theatrical cut, it is implied that Superman has killed the three Kryptonian villains (going against the strict code that Superman does not kill). In the extended ending, a U.S. &quot;polar patrol&quot; is shown picking up the three Kryptonians and Lex Luthor, after which Superman, with Lois standing beside him, destroys the Fortress of Solitude.

Among the other &quot;lost&quot; scenes:
* Superman passes a Concorde jet on his way to Paris. This is not in the video release and was actually an outtake from &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot; as a bridge between Superman saving Air Force One and his conversation with Jor-El after his first night.
* At the end of the film, Clark Kent bumps into a large bald man, which reminds him to go to the diner to face the obnoxious trucker who beat him up earlier.
* The Phantom Zone villains land outside the Fortress of Solitude with Lex Luthor and Lois Lane, trying to figure out how to get in.
* Extended scenes of the three Kryptonians&#x27; invasion of the White House, with Zod using a gun and Non frightening a dog.
* Superman cooks a soufflé using his heat vision, during dinner with Lois at the Fortress of Solitude.
* Extended discussion between Zod and Ursa on the Moon.
* In East Houston, a boy tries to escape on horseback, only to be killed by Non, who throws a police siren at him.

Some telecast versions remove the following for content:
* Much violence in the opening White House scene was left out, including Zod murdering several Secret Service agents and Capitol Police officers with an AR-10 assault rifle.
* The bully&#x27;s line in the bar (&quot;I don&#x27;t like your meat anyway!&quot; was re-edited to &quot;I don&#x27;t like you anyway&quot;).
* About 35 seconds of the &quot;Battle of Metropolis&quot; (Superman flying over Metropolis River) was deleted.
* Some language and profanity were re-dubbed.

Among the footage seen in the international/Canadian telecasts:
* A girl in Japan watching the destruction of East Houston on TV to the disapproval of her father, who believes it&#x27;s a violent TV show.
* Longer conversation between Lois and Superman after he destroys the Fortress of Solitude.
* Lex Luthor taking Perry White&#x27;s coffee during the Times Square battle.
* Lex and Miss Teschmacher admiring the Fortress of Solitude.
* Lex&#x27;s negotiating with Superman after they leave the fortress is longer.
* Zod and his cronies being arrested by Arctic Patrol officers.

In 2004, the fan-restored DVD known as &quot;Superman II: Restored International Cut&quot; was released through many Superman fan sites. It featured extended scenes pulled from international television broadcasts over the years. Warner Bros. threatened legal action over the bootleg release.

==&quot;The Richard Donner Cut&quot;==

During the production of &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, Warner Bros. acquired the rights from Marlon Brando&#x27;s estate to use the late actor&#x27;s footage from &quot;Superman&quot; in the film. Shortly after, Ilya Salkind confirmed that Donner was involved in the project to re-cut &quot;Superman II&quot; using Brando&#x27;s unused footage. Editor Michael Thau worked on the project alongside Donner and Tom Mankiewicz, who supervised the &quot;Superman II&quot; reconstruction. Despite some initial confusion, Thau confirmed that all the footage shot by Donner in 1977 was recovered and transferred from a vault in England.

The new edition, titled &quot;Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut&quot;, was released on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray on November 28, 2006. In order to make Donner&#x27;s vision of &quot;Superman II&quot; feel less incomplete, finished scenes by Lester that Donner was unable to shoot were incorporated into the film as well as the screen tests by Reeve and Kidder for one pivotal scene. The film also restores several cut scenes including Marlon Brando as Jor-El, an alternate prologue and opening sequence at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; that omits the Eiffel Tower opening from the original, as well as the original scripted and filmed ending for &quot;Superman II&quot; featuring Superman reversing time before it was cut and placed at the end of the first film.

== In other media ==
=== Comics ===
* Superman&#x27;s publisher DC Comics published a commemorative magazine of &quot;Superman II&quot; in 1981. Published as &quot;DC Special Series&quot; #25, it was produced in &quot;Treasury format&quot; and included photos and background photos, actor profiles, panel-to-scene comparisons, and pin-ups.
* In 2006, the Superman comics themselves adapted elements from the Superman movies, specifically the ice-like look of Krypton, and Jor-El banishing the criminals to the Phantom Zone. Ursa and Non made their first appearances in the comic book continuity. (This was facilitated in the &quot;Last Son&quot; story arc, co-written by Richard Donner.)
* In 2021, a Superman comic entitled &quot;Superman &#x27;78&quot; was released. Written by Robert Venditti and illustrated by Wilfredo Torres, the comic is set in Donnerverse continuity, acting as a continuation.

=== Television ===
* In the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;, much of the imagery and concepts of the first two Salkind/Donner &quot;Superman&quot; films, has been revived as a conscious homage to the film series by the show&#x27;s creators. These include the ice-crystal Fortress of Solitude, the spinning square in space to represent the Phantom Zone, and the continued presence of the deceased Jor-El as a disembodied counselor and teacher to young Clark/Kal-El. Terence Stamp, who played General Zod in the first two films, provided the voice of Jor-El for the series. Christopher Reeve made two appearances on the show as Dr. Virgil Swann, a disabled scientist who had acquired knowledge of Krypton to pass on to Clark, before Reeve&#x27;s death in 2004. A section of John Williams&#x27; Superman theme was included when Reeve made his first appearance, and was later used in the series finale. Margot Kidder, Marc McClure (Jimmy Olsen), and Helen Slater (&quot;Supergirl&quot;) have also made appearances on the show. Annette O&#x27;Toole (Lana Lang in &quot;Superman III&quot;) played Martha Kent.
* In the animated series &quot;Young Justice&quot;, in the episode &quot;Satisfaction&quot; of its second season, Lex Luthor appears briefly talking to one of his assistants on the phone, who is called Otis, as a reference to the character in the films.

<doc id="1059285" wikidata="Q4179473" url="?curid=1059285" title="Altamiro de la Cueva">
<text>Altamiro de la Cueva is a Spanish comic strip series, created in 1965 by Joan Bernet Toledano and Carles Bech and published in the comic book magazine &quot;TBO&quot;.

==Concept==

The stories feature funny adventures about a bunch of prehistoric cavemen. Altamiro, the protagonist, is not the strongest nor the most powerful of his tribe, but he&#x27;s witty, sagacious and favours his community. Altamiro is also an artist who paints on the walls of caves. His name is a clear reference to the Spanish Cueva de Altamira.

The characters are physically the same as modern people, but they are dressed in pieces of fur, a bit like &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. They are all white. Altamiro has black hair and a slight beard.

As in &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, anachronisms are common. Altamiro himself develops several inventions that are certainly not prehistoric.

<doc id="1059311" wikidata="Q4460483" url="?curid=1059311" title="USS Montgomery (DD-121)">
<text>USS &quot;Montgomery&quot; (DD–121) was a in the United States Navy during World War I, later reclassified DM-17. She was the fifth ship named &quot;Montgomery&quot; and was named for Rear Admiral John B. Montgomery.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Montgomery&quot; was built by Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company. The ship was launched on 23 March 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Andrew Jones, a descendant of Admiral Montgomery. The destroyer was commissioned on 26 July 1918.

==Service history==
Following an east coast shakedown, &quot;Montgomery&quot; left Hampton Roads on 25 August 1918 for her first anti-submarine patrol, alternating such patrols with coastal escort duty until the close of World War I. She conducted training and fleet maneuvers from Maine to Cuba until 19 July 1919, when she departed Hampton Roads for west coast duty.

&quot;Montgomery&quot; arrived at San Diego on 7 August to join Destroyer Squadron 4, Pacific Fleet. For the next 3 years she took part in fleet operations from Alaska to Panama, then on 17 March 1922 began inactivation at San Diego, where she decommissioned on 6 June 1922.

Re-designated DM-17 on 5 January 1931, &quot;Montgomery&quot; was converted to a light minelayer and recommissioned on 20 August 1931. In December she sailed to Pearl Harbor, her base until 14 June 1937, when she returned to San Diego, there to decommission on 7 December 1937 and go into reserve.

===World War II===
With world tension increasing on the eve of World War II, &quot;Montgomery&quot; reactivated, recommissioning on 25 September 1939. She trained for possible war service and completed several towing assignments on the west coast until 3 December 1940 when she sailed for her new home port, Pearl Harbor.

At Pearl Harbor during the Japanese attack on 7 December 1941, &quot;Montgomery&quot; immediately began anti-submarine patrols in the approaches to the vital base, as well as inter-island convoy duty. Departing Hawaii on 11 April 1942 for Suva, Fiji, &quot;Montgomery&quot; began 16 months operating from Suva, Espiritu Santo, and Nouméa for escort and minelaying operations in the southwest Pacific, aiding in the struggle for the Solomons. One interruption to this service was 22 September to 12 November, when she sailed north to lay mines in the Aleutians in preparation for the recapture of Attu and Kiska.

While laying a minefield off Guadalcanal on the night of 24 to 25 August 1943, &quot;Montgomery&quot; collided with , losing of her bow. She made temporary repairs at Tulagi and Espiritu Santo, then sailed on 1 October for San Francisco, arriving on 19 October.

Repairs completed, &quot;Montgomery&quot; began ten months of activity which included two convoy escort voyages between San Francisco and Hawaii (8 December 1943 to 5 February 1944), defensive minelaying around Kwajalein (17 March to 4 April), convoy escort to Majuro (May 1944), and local convoy escort in the Hawaiians. &quot;Montgomery&quot; attacked an enemy submarine contact on 25 June 1944 without evident result. After an escort voyage to Eniwetok and return (28 June to 16 July), she sailed for Guadalcanal to prepare for the invasion of the Palaus.

Getting underway for the assault on 6 September, &quot;Montgomery&quot; took station off Peleliu on 12 September to destroy mines swept from the Japanese minefields. On 17 September she screened transports landing assault troops on Angaur, and two days later sailed for mine destruction and patrol duties at Ulithi until 14 October. She bombarded Ngulu on 15 October and acted as mother ship for small minelayers during the capture of the atoll.

While anchored off Ngulu on 17 October, with her engines secured, &quot;Montgomery&quot; sighted a mine floating close aboard to port. The wind swung the ship down onto the mine before she could get underway or destroy it. The resulting explosion flooded both engine rooms and one fireroom, ruptured fuel tanks, and killed four of her crew. Salvage efforts kept her afloat until she could be towed to Ulithi for repairs. Underway on her own power on 12 January 1945, &quot;Montgomery&quot; arrived at San Francisco on 14 February. There it was recommended that she be decommissioned, which she was on 23 April 1945. &quot;Montgomery&quot; was sold for scrapping on 11 March 1946.

==Awards==
&quot;Montgomery&quot; received four battle stars for World War II service.

<text>Arthur John Reaume (November 30, 1906 – December 13, 1981) was a Canadian politician.

==Background==
Reaume was born at Sandwich, Ontario, in 1906.

==Politics==
He was elected to the town council of Sandwich in 1930 and became mayor of Sandwich in 1933. He sat on Windsor city council after Sandwich became part of Windsor. Reaume succeeded David Croll as Windsor mayor in 1941, becoming the 22nd mayor of the city, and was reelected in 1948. In the municipal election of 1950, it appeared that Thomas Brophey had defeated Reaume by 38 votes but, after a recount, Reaume was declared the winner by 16 votes and served until 1954. Reaume is also Windsor&#x27;s longest-serving mayor, at 13 years.

He ran as a candidate for the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario in the 1943 election but was defeated by the CCF. He broke with the Conservatives when he supported UAW workers at Ford in their fight for the Rand formula.

In the 1945 and 1948 elections, he ran as a Liberal-Labour candidate, but lost on both attempts. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) in 1951. He remained in office until the 1967 election.

A pro-labour but otherwise conservative politician, he ran for the Ontario Liberal leadership in 1958 but won only 32 votes and was eliminated on the first ballot along with Liberal-Labour MPP Albert Wren. Reaume withdrew after the first ballot and threw his support to John Wintermeyer who came from behind to win on the third ballot. Reaume and Wren had both been expelled from the Liberal caucus in 1957 for attacking the leadership of Farquhar Oliver but Reaume was readmitted after apologising.

He died at a Toronto hospital in 1981.

<doc id="1059324" wikidata="Q7371689" url="?curid=1059324" title="Rover Boys">
<text>The Rover Boys, or The Rover Boys Series for Young Americans, was a popular juvenile series written by Arthur M. Winfield, a pseudonym for Edward Stratemeyer. Thirty titles were published between 1899 and 1926 and the books remained in print for years afterward.

The original Rover Boys were brothers Tom, Sam, and Dick Rover, the sons of wealthy widower Anderson Rover, who entrusted his brother and sister-in-law, Randolph and Martha, with the rearing of the boys. As the series progressed the brothers became smitten with Dora Stanhope and Nellie and Grace Laning, the daughter and nieces of a wealthy widow. 

The Rover boys&#x27; children (Fred, son of Sam Rover; Jack, son of Dick; Andy and Randy, twin sons of Tom) became the main characters of the &quot;second series&quot; that began with Volume 21, &quot;The Rover Boys at Colby Hall&quot;, published in 1917. The elder Rovers continued making appearances in the second series.

Additionally, there was a related &quot;Putnam Hall&quot; series of six books that featured other characters from the first Rovers series, although the Rovers themselves do not appear.

The Rovers were students at a military boarding school: adventurous, prank-playing, flirtatious, and often unchaperoned adolescents who were frequently causing mischief for authorities, as well as for criminals. The series often incorporated modern technology of the era, such as the automobile, airplanes (&quot;The Rover Boys in the Air&quot;) and news events, such as World War I.

The earliest volumes focused on the boys&#x27; travel adventures, but later stories were filled with mystery and suspense. 

==Publishers==
From 1899 to 1906 The Mershon Co. published volumes 1 through 11; from 1906 to 1907 Chatterton-Peck Co. published volumes 1 through 11. Starting in 1907 Grosset &amp; Dunlap began publishing the Rover Boys, eventually printing all 30 volumes. They published the series through at least the 1930s. Starting in the 1940s Whitman Publishing reprinted volumes 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13 and 14.

==Legacy==
More than a million Rover Boys books were sold, and the titles remained in print by Grosset &amp; Dunlap and later Whitman for years after the final title was published. The most commonly encountered are the green and brown cover editions published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap during the 1910s and 1920s. While there are better-known and longer-running juvenile series such as The Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, and Tom Swift, the Rovers were very successful and influential. They established the template for all later Stratemeyer Syndicate series. It was Stratemeyer&#x27;s first series, and one of his favorites. Stratemeyer did all of the writing himself, rather than hiring ghostwriters.
* The Rover Boys were parodied in a 1942 Warner Brothers &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon as &quot;The Dover Boys&quot;, subtitled &quot;The Rivals of Roquefort Hall&quot; (as opposed to Colby, both terms being cheeses). The cartoon was directed by Chuck Jones. The characters from this Rovers&#x27; parody would later appear in two episodes of &quot;Animaniacs&quot; (&quot;Frontier Slappy&quot; and &quot;Magic Time&quot;) and its 1999 series finale &quot;Wakko&#x27;s Wish&quot;, as well as the 1996 movie &quot;Space Jam&quot;.
*In the 1951 detective novel &quot;The Way Some People Die&quot; by Ross MacDonald, a police lieutenant accuses protagonist Lew Archer of running &quot;a murder investigation as a one-man show&quot;. He mocks Archer by asking if he read &quot;The Rover Boys at Hollywood and Vine&quot;.
* In the 1952 movie &quot;Macao&quot;, starring Robert Mitchum and Jane Russell, the Mitchum character, Nick Cochran, asks &quot;are the Rover Boys still here?&quot;, referring to two thugs sent to find him.
* The 18th episode of the first season (1953) of &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot; is titled &quot;Rover Boys&quot; and features a narrative driven by a disagreement between Ozzie and his neighbor Thorny concerning the plot of a Rover Boys story.
* In the 1938 movie &quot;Letter of Introduction&quot;, the character of Barry Paige, played by George Murphy, is accused of being a &quot;Rover Boy&quot; for coming to the rescue of Kay Martin, played by Andrea Leeds, when she found herself in a predicament at a restaurant when she couldn&#x27;t pay the bill.
* In the 1955 MGM musical &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot;, there are two references to the Rover Boys. The first is in the beginning of the movie when a bartender exclaims, &quot;Well, if it isn&#x27;t the Rover Boys&quot; as the three main characters walk into his bar. The second is toward the end of the movie; while trying to evade thugs, the character named Ted borrows a jacket that has &quot;The Rover Boys&quot; embroidered on the back.
* In 1956 a Canadian vocal group named after the Rover Boys had a Top 20 single with the school-themed &quot;Graduation Day&quot;.
* The names Tom, Sam, and Dick Rover are mentioned by Scout in Harper Lee&#x27;s 1960 novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; in reference to a game of pretend in which Dill, Jem, and Scout all had good parts.
* In a 1965 episode of &quot;I Spy&quot; called &quot;Carry Me Back to Old Tsing-Tao&quot;, Scotty referred to the three money-hungry sons-in-law of an aged Chinese criminal mastermind as &quot;The Rover Boys&quot; by saying, &quot;...Now can the Rover Boys be far behind?&quot;
* The Rover Boys books were mentioned in the 1966 supernatural soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (episode 38) where the governess Victoria Winters was searching for the books in the basement of the old mansion for her charge David Collins.
* In the eighth season of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, in a 1967 episode titled &quot;The Tape Recorder&quot;, the bank robber character Eddie Blake complains that his luck was he had to run into the &quot;Rover Boys&quot; when Opie and Arnold asked him to confess his crime because they secretly recorded him in his cell revealing the location of the stolen money.

<text>David C. Page (born 1956) is an American biologist and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the director of the Whitehead Institute, and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator. He is best known for his work on mapping the Y-chromosome and on its evolution in mammals and expression during development.

==Education and early life==
Page was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in 1956 and grew up in the rural outskirts of Pennsylvania Dutch country. The first of his family to go to college, Page attended Swarthmore College, where he graduated with a BA with highest honors in chemistry in 1978. During his final year at Swarthmore, Page attended class just one day a week and spent the rest of his time researching chromatin structure in the laboratory of molecular biologist Robert Simpson at the National Institutes of Health. In 1978, Page enrolled at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences Program, where he worked in the laboratories of David Botstein at MIT and Raymond White at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. In White&#x27;s lab, Page worked on a project to develop a genetic linkage map of the human genome that would become a precursor to the Human Genome Project. The work relied on locating restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP). The first RFLP that Page found was from a site of homology between the X chromosome and Y chromosome, a coincidence that would set the direction of his subsequent career.

Page finished his MD degree in the spring of 1984 and started his own lab as the first Whitehead Fellow at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research researching the genetics of XX male syndrome, or de la Chapelle Syndrome. After Page won the MacArthur &quot;Genius Grant&quot; in 1986, Page was promoted to the faculty of the Whitehead Institute and the MIT Department of Biology in 1988. In 1990, Page was named a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, and in 2005 he was named as director of the Whitehead Institute.

== Research and career==
Page has worked in several areas of genetics.

===Mapping the Y chromosome===
In his work on de la Chapelle Syndrome in 1986, Page collaborated with the geneticist who originally identified the first XX male, Albert de la Chapelle, and geneticist Jean Weissenbach to show that XX males carry a small piece of the Y chromosome.

In the following year, he reported that the gene ZFY induced the development of the testes, a finding which received a great deal of media attention since it putatively resolving a decade-long search for the sex-determining gene. In 1989, a British team of scientists led by Peter Goodfellow and Robin Lovell-Badge began to report that the testis-determining gene was not ZFY, which led Page to review his data. Page found that he had misinterpreted his data because one of the XY females in his study had a second deletion at the site which proved to be the location of the real sex-determining gene. Launching a second round of media attention, Nature published his findings together with a paper from the British group that identified the sex-determining gene, which they termed SRY.

Despite a belief among geneticists that the Y chromosome contained few genes other than the sex-determining gene, Page continued to map the Y chromosome. He had already published DNA-based deletion maps of the Y chromosome in 1986, and went on to develop comprehensive clone-based physical maps of the chromosome in 1992 and systematic catalogs of Y-linked genes in 1997. Page collaborated with a team at the Genome Institute at Washington University to make a complete map of the Y chromosome, which they achieved in 2003. To do so, Page and his colleagues developed a new sequencing technique, single-haplotype iterative mapping and sequencing (SHIMS), since mammalian sex chromosomes contain too many repetitive sequences to be sequenced by conventional approaches. The development of SHIMS allowed Page to identify long palindromic sequences on the long arm of the Y chromosome, which he would go on to show made the Y chromosome vulnerable to the deletions that cause spermatogenic failure (an inability to produce sperm). In 2012, Page characterized the most common genetic cause of spermatogenic failure, the deletion of the AZFc region of the Y chromosome. The lab also found that aberrant crossing over within the Y chromosome&#x27;s palindromes underlies a wide range of disorders of sexual differentiation, including Turner syndrome.

===Evolution of the Y chromosome===
With the development of more detailed maps of the Y chromosome, in the mid-1990s Page began to find genetic evidence confirming the theory that both the X and Y chromosomes had evolved from autosomes, beginning with the 1996 discovery that a family of genes called DAZ (deleted in azoospermia) had been transposed from an autosome to the Y chromosome. In 1999, Page and his then-graduate student Bruce Lahn showed that the X and Y chromosomes had diverged in four steps, beginning 200-300 million years ago. Later cross-species comparisons would show that while ancestral genes on the Y chromosome initially underwent rapid decay, the remaining genes have remained stable for the last 25 million years, overturning the long-held view that the Y chromosome was going extinct. In a 2014 study, Page concluded that the conserved genes on the Y chromosome played an important role in male viability, since they were dosage-dependent genes with similar but not identical counterparts on the X chromosome that all have regulatory roles in transcription, translation, and protein stability. Because these genes are expressed throughout the body, Page further concluded that these genes give rise to differences in the biochemistry of male and female tissues.

In super-resolution studies of the sex chromosomes, Page has found evidence of an evolutionary &quot;arms race&quot; between the X and Y chromosomes for transmission to the next generation. In one study, Page found that human X and mouse Y chromosomes have converged, independently acquiring and amplifying gene families expressed in testicular germ cells. Another study found that the mouse Y chromosome had acquired and massively amplified genes homologous to the testis-expressed gene families on the mouse X chromosome.

===The genetics of germ cells===
Page used the mouse as a model to study the genetics of meiotic initiation, showing that retinoic acid (RA) is the key factor which induces meiosis, as well as identifying several important genes crucial to the meiotic initiation pathway, including Stra8 and DAZL. Page further discovered that the differentiation germ cells into gametocytes (oocytes in females or spermatocytes in males) does not depend on meiotic initiation, as commonly thought, showing that germ cells deficient in Stra8, a gene that activates the meiotic pathway, are still capable of growth and differentiation.

===Awards and honors===
His honors and awards include:
* 1986 MacArthur Prize Fellowship
* 1989 Searle Scholar Award
* 1997 Francis Amory Prize, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (for genetic studies of mammalian sex determination; prize shared with Peter Goodfellow and Robin Lovell-Badge)
* 2003 Curt Stern Award, American Society of Human Genetics (for outstanding scientific achievement in human genetics)
* 2005 Member, National Academy of Sciences
* 2007 Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science
* 2008 Member, National Academy of Medicine
* 2011 Fellow, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (Class Speaker, Biological Sciences)

<doc id="1059362" wikidata="Q5036880" url="?curid=1059362" title="Captain of industry">
<text>In the 19th century, a captain of industry was a business leader whose means of amassing a personal fortune contributed positively to the country in some way. This may have been through increased productivity, expansion of markets, providing more jobs, or acts of philanthropy. This characterization contrasts with that of the robber baron, a business leader using political means to achieve personal ends.

== Origin ==
The term was coined by the Scottish essayist, historian and philosopher Thomas Carlyle in his essay &quot;Count Cagliostro&quot; (1833).

In such periods of Social Decay, what is called an overflowing Population, that is a Population which, under the old Captains of Industry (named Higher Classes, &quot;Ricos Hombres&quot;, Aristocracies and the like), can no longer find work and wages, increases the number of Unprofessionals, Lackalls, Social Nondescripts; with appetite of utmost keenness, which there is no known method of satisfying. Nay, more, and perversely enough, ever as Population augments, your Captains of Industry can and do dwindle more and more into Captains of Idleness; whereby the more and more overflowing Population is worse and worse governed (shown &quot;what to do&quot;, for that is the only government): thus is the candle lighted at both ends; and the number of social Nondescripts increases in &quot;double&quot;-quick ratio.

In &quot;Past and Present&quot; (1843), Carlyle uses the term in reference to industrialists, such as mill-owners, whom he regards as a new aristocracy. In Carlyle&#x27;s view, British society&#x27;s devotion to appearances (fashion, wealth, status) at the expense of substance (good, hard, honest labor) has resulted in a need for &quot;the awakening of the Nation&#x27;s soul from its asphyxia.&quot; Carlyle identifies the heart of England&#x27;s social ills as being the relationship between employers and the employed, based solely on &quot;Cash-payment for the sole nexus.&quot; What is called society has produced nothing but the &quot;totalest separation, isolation,&quot; and the false belief that &quot;&quot;Cash-payment&quot;...absolves and liquidates all engagements of man.&quot; Carlyle asserts that &quot;No Working World . . . can be led on without a noble Chivalry of Work, and laws and fixed rules which follow out of that,&quot; a return to social order through mutual obligation and respect. Underlying the &quot;Chivalry of Labour&quot; is the basic assumption that human beings work best in a hierarchical structure. Laborers that &quot;work not as in a Great Taskmaster&#x27;s eye, will work wrong&quot;; while the captains of industry would offer noble leadership and guidance to those beneath them, ruling the workplace as enlightened taskmasters, the workers would possess an equally enlightened sense of loyalty, both to their &quot;captains&quot; and their labor.

=== Influence on economists ===
Carlyle&#x27;s concept influenced economists such as Joseph Shield Nicholson, John Kells Ingram, Arnold Toynbee (who nevertheless found the idea overly paternalistic), James Bonar, Alfred Marshall, and (especially) William Smart. Publications such as the &quot;Economic Review&quot; and the &quot;Economic Journal&quot; praised figures like Ernst Abbe as models of Carlyle&#x27;s vision.

==Versus &quot;robber baron&quot;==
Some 19th-century industrialists who were called &quot;captains of industry&quot; overlap with those called &quot;robber barons&quot;. These include people such as Cornelius Vanderbilt, Andrew Carnegie, Andrew Mellon, Leland Stanford and John D. Rockefeller.

The education division of the National Endowment for the Humanities has prepared a lesson plan for schools asking whether &quot;robber baron&quot; or &quot;captain of industry&quot; is the better terminology. The lesson states that it attempts to help students &quot;establish a distinction between robber barons and captains of industry. Students will uncover some less honorable deeds, as well as the shrewd business moves and highly charitable acts of the great industrialists and financiers. It has been argued that only because such people were able to amass great amounts of capital could our country become the world&#x27;s greatest industrial power. Some actions of these men, which could only happen in a period of economic laissez faire, resulted in poor conditions for workers, but in the end, may also have enabled our present-day standard of living.&quot;
