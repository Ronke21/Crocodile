<text>Lubricated Goat are an Australian noise rock band which originally formed in 1986 by multi-instrumentalist Stu Spasm. They achieved brief notoriety in November 1988 for appearing nude on the ABC TV program &quot;Blah Blah Blah&quot;, wearing only their instruments and shoes. Mainly influenced by the Stooges and the Birthday Party, they are credited for playing a grimy, confrontational style of rock, which preceded grunge. They have issued five studio albums, &quot;Plays the Devil&#x27;s Music&quot; (1987), &quot;Paddock of Love&quot; (1988), &quot;Psychedelicatessen&quot; (1990), &quot;Forces You Don&#x27;t Understand&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Great Old Ones&quot; (2003).

==History==
Lubricated Goat were formed in Sydney in 1986 by Stu Spasm (real name Stuart Gray) on lead vocals, guitar, synthesiser and bass guitar. Spasm had previously been a member of Exhibit A, Zulu Rattle, Salamander Jim, Beasts of Bourbon, James Baker Experience, Death in Vegas and Hot Property. The original band also included Martin Bland on drums and backing vocals (ex-Head On, Crawling Eye, Acid Drops, Bloodloss, Zulu Rattle, Salamander Jim, Primevils), Brett Ford on drums, and Pete Hartley on bass guitar and guitar (the latter two both formerly of the Kryptonics).

En route to Sydney after a visit to England, Spasm went via Perth to visit former Singing Dog drummer Ford, who was then playing in the Kryptonics with Hartley. While in Perth, Spasm recorded side 1 of the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Plays the Devil&#x27;s Music&quot;, at No Sweat Studios with Ford and Hartley. Side 2 was recorded in Adelaide on a 4-track with Bland.

Lubricated Goat signed to Red Eye Records offshoot Black Eye Records, established by John Foy., which released &quot;Plays the Devil&#x27;s Music&quot; in July 1987. According to Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane, &quot;For the musicians involved, it was simply a chance to exist on the very edges of the Sydney rock scene, and to play out a sick joke for their own entertainment... Foy... liked the joke and formed the Black Eye label specifically as an outlet for the recorded works of this bunch of noise terrorists&quot;.

In Sydney, Spasm recruited bassist Guy Maddison of Perth band the Greenhouse Effect (later a member of Mudhoney), Hartley switched to lead guitar. Most band members lived on Cleveland Street in an old, run-down three-story mansion which was dubbed Gracelands. The house was a haven for musicians and artists who hosted art shows and nude discos. In July 1988 the group released their second album, &quot;Paddock of Love&quot;, which included the track &quot;In the Raw&quot;.

On 2 November 1988, the band provided a nude performance, lip-syncing to &quot;In the Raw&quot;, on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation TV program, &quot;Blah Blah Blah&quot;. The event created national media outrage, according to McFarlane: &quot;The sight of the Goats&#x27; real (and imagined) body parts was enough to prompt scores of irate callers to jam the ABC&#x27;s switchboard for 30 minutes, for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; to run a front-page exposé and for current affairs shows like the &quot;Midday Show&quot;, &quot;Hinch&quot; and &quot;Newsworld&quot;, plus radio commentators like Ron Casey, to call for an end to such moral depravity&quot;. The criticism was met by ABC-TV&#x27;s presenter, Tim Bowden of &quot;Backchat&quot;, who &quot;appeared shirtless behind his desk so as to give an impression of nudity while discussing listener&#x27;s letters about [that group&#x27;s] appearance&quot;. A documentary film about the event, directed by Cousin Creep and also titled &quot;In the Raw&quot;, explained why the band were nude for that performance. It premiered on 11 December 2009 at the 19th Meredith Music Festival. The lineup for the ABC performance included musician Peter Read (also of the band Thug), who was brought in on a temporary basis when another band member felt uncomfortable about appearing nude.

In a line-up change, Hartley was dismissed and Ford quit, replaced respectively by guitarist Charles Tolnay (ex-Grong Grong, King Snake Roost) and drummer Gene Revet (ex-Ragdoll, the Space Juniors). In May 1989, they issued the &quot;Schadenfreude&quot; EP. Lubricated Goat&#x27;s back catalogue was reissued by Amphetamine Reptile Records in the United States and on Normal in Europe before the band embarked on its first US tour in mid-1989. Tolnay and Revet did not participate in the tour; Spasm and Maddison were joined by ex-Bloodloss member Renastair EJ (on guitar and saxophone) and Bland (on synthesiser as well as drums). Later, after Maddison&#x27;s departure, this line-up recorded a third full-length album, &quot;Psychedelicatessen&quot;, with Lachlan McLeod (ex-Salamander Jim) on bass guitar and audio sampler. McFarlane noted that the album showed &quot;a variety of styles (from noisy free-form jazz to noisier hard rock), with tortured guitars and raw vocals being the band&#x27;s characteristic mode of operation&quot;.

In 1990, the group commenced its first European tour, one that was plagued with tragedy via the stabbing of Spasm in Berlin – &quot;in a drug deal gone wrong&quot;, according to McFarlane. The incident placed Lubricated Goat on hiatus.

Various incarnations of Lubricated Goat (often featuring only Spasm) existed in the early 1990s, documented on the 7-inch singles &quot;Meating My Head&quot; (1990, part of the Sub Pop Singles Club), &quot;Shut Your Mind&quot; (1992, Sympathy for the Record Industry) and &quot;Play Dead&quot; (1993, Sub Pop). During this period, Spasm was also a member of grunge supergroup, Crunt, which featured his then-wife Kat Bjelland of Babes in Toyland as well as Jon Spencer Blues Explosion drummer, Russell Simins; Crunt released their eponymous debut in 1994.

Lubricated Goat resumed activity in the mid-2000s. Among the members were Australian drummer Hayden Millsteed (also a founder of New York post-punk band Bell Hollow), who performed on the band&#x27;s 2003 album, &quot;The Great Old Ones&quot;, which featured re-recordings of previously released Lubricated Goat and Crunt tracks.

In 2007, a new line-up of Lubricated Goat started performing with Anne Mette Rasmussen on keyboards, sound effects and backup vocals; Creighton Chamberlain (formerly of Heroine Sheiks) on bass; and drummer Rich Hutchins (formerly of Live Skull and Of Cabbages and Kings).

The line-up changed again in 2009, with Chamberlain replaced by Jack Natz, formerly of the 1980s New Jersey punk band the Undead as well as Black Snakes, Cop Shoot Cop and Red Expendables. Natz had previously played bass in Lubricated Goat intermittently from the late 1990s through to the mid-2000s. Rasmussen left to form her own band, LoveStruck, which also included both Spasm and Hutchins.

As of 2015, Spasm now heads The Art Gray Noizz Quintet with Hutchins, Skeleton Boy (formerly of Woman) on bass, Andrea Sicco (of Twin Guns) and Grace Bergere on guitar, Nikki D&#x27;Agostino on saxophone, and Nicholas John Stevens on trombone.

Temporary 1988 member Read died in Melbourne in 2016 after battling liver cancer.

A full-length documentary was released chronicling the life and music of Stu Spasm, entitled &quot;I Should Have Been Dead Years Ago&quot;. Directed by Jason Axel Summers, the film premiered in May 2024 and is touted as &quot;Exploring the life, music, &amp; artistic output of Stuart Gray, the notorious underground rocker who created the most psychotronic group to emerge from Australia – the legendary Lubricated Goat. Shot over 20 years, featuring archival footage, photos, interviews, Gray’s sculptures and paintings, live performance footage including Gray’s current band, The Art Gray Noizz Quintet.&quot;

<doc id="1049873" wikidata="Q7295500" url="?curid=1049873" title="Ratcat">
<text>Ratcat are an Australian indie rock band from Sydney who formed in 1985. The band is fronted by mainstay vocalist and guitarist, Simon Day. Their combination of indie pop song writing and energetic punk-style guitar rock won them fans from both the indie and skate-punk communities. They found mainstream success with their extended play, &quot;Tingles&quot; (October 1990), album &quot;Blind Love&quot; (June 1991) and the single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Now&quot; (April), which all reached No. 1 on the ARIA Charts during 1991. The band released two subsequent albums that did not match their earlier chart success. Ratcat ceased performing live regularly in the late 1990s; however, they continue to perform sporadically. During their career, much of Ratcat&#x27;s albums and singles artwork was created by Simon Day.

==Career==
===1985–1990: Career beginnings and Waterfront Records===

Ratcat were formed in 1985 in Sydney by Simon Day on lead guitar and lead vocals, Victor Levi on bass guitar and Andrew Polin on drums. Both Day and Levi had been members of garage band, Danger Mouse. Ratcat &quot;built-up a strong live following by playing the local haunts of the Sydney skate-punk scene alongside the likes of Massappeal, The Hellmenn, The Hard-ons and Happy Hate Me Nots.&quot;

The group signed to Waterfront Records, and released a self-titled extended play in December 1987, which &quot;contained four of the band&#x27;s self-penned stage favourites plus a cover of &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot;.&quot; It was followed by two singles, &quot;I Think I Love You&quot; (August 1988) and &quot;Baby&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot; (December). 

In July 1989, the band released its debut album, &quot;This Nightmare&quot;. By that time the line-up was Day, John McAteer on bass guitar and Andrew Polin on drums. According to Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane, the album &quot;contained a treasure-trove of witty, effervescent Day-penned tracks like &quot;Go Go&quot;, &quot;True Lust&quot;, &quot;Baby&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot; and &quot;The Killing Joke&quot;, plus a cover of UK band The Darling Buds&#x27; &quot;If I Said&quot;.&quot; Another single, &quot;Saying Goodbye&quot; was released late in 1989 which was their final release on Waterfront. Amr Zaid replaced McAteer on bass guitar and backing vocals. Alister of &quot;Tharunka&quot; felt &quot;Saying Goodbye&quot; was &quot;quite refreshing, both in the areas of its mixing and melody, despite decidedly average vocals.&quot;

===1990–1998: &quot;Blind Love&quot; and rooArt records===

In February 1990, Ratcat supported English group Buzzcocks and fellow Australian band Falling Joys, before signing with the rooArt label, distributed by PolyGram. 

On 14 October 1990, the group released a six-track EP entitled, &quot;Tingles&quot;, which was produced by Nick Mainsbridge (Tall Tales and True, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard). McFarlane noticed that &quot;almost immediately the frisky &quot;That Ain&#x27;t Bad&quot; scored mainstream radio support.&quot; That track, combined with their cartoon, tattoo-ish artwork (which featured heavily on their releases and in their videos), saw &quot;Tingles&quot; reach No. 1 on ARIA Alternative Singles Chart and, in May 1991, the EP was a number-one hit on the ARIA Singles Chart for two weeks. &quot;That Ain&#x27;t Bad&quot;, the lead track, was Day&#x27;s &quot;simple attempt to mix noisy guitars and the words &#x27;I love you&#x27; together in a song without one contradicting the other.&quot; &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; reviewer opined that it &quot;has had the airplay, but it is not the best track. &quot;Don&#x27;t Go in the Water&quot;, a dire little track, and &quot;Getting Away (From This World)&quot;, with its hackneyed but fairly successful insertion of sound from the Challenger shuttle disaster, are both excellent tracks.&quot;

According to an &quot;Australian Musician Magazine&quot; staff writer, Ratcat were the first alternative band to go mainstream – they provided one of the Top 50 Most Significant Moments in Australian Pop/Rock History. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Blind Love&quot; was released in May 1991, and its lead single &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Now&quot; (April) both reached No. 1 on their respective ARIA charts. The song was co-written by Day and Robyn St. Clare (of the Hummingbirds). For recording, at Paradise Studios, Day, Polin and Zaid were joined by St. Clare and Margaret Urlich on backing vocals; they were produced by Mainsbridge, again. Zaid told Charles Miranda of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; that their chart success was &quot;really weird it happened so quickly it&#x27;s sort of difficult for us to understand what has happened. And it does put pressure on us to come up with the goods. We have to look at what we&#x27;ve done [... but not] perform to any sort of dictated standard by what we&#x27;ve achieved.&quot;

The group supported fellow Australian group, INXS, on the latter&#x27;s Australian tour in April and May 1991 and followed by headlining their own Invasion of the Dinosaur Killers Tour in June. Their next single, &quot;Baby Baby&quot;, was released in July and reached No. 21. In September they started a four-month tour across the United Kingdom, continental Europe and the United States. Polin described how &quot;We were playing to full houses a lot of the way around... Admittedly, in London about a third of the audiences were Australians but we had sold about 17,000 copies of our album over there.&quot;

Upon their return to Australia in December, they released an eight-track live album, &quot;Alive&quot;. Marc Scully replaced Zaid on bass guitar in mid-1992. Their third studio album, &quot;Insideout&quot; (November 1992) also produced by Mainsbridge, spawned three singles, &quot;Candyman&quot; (May 1992), &quot;Holiday&quot; (October 1992) and &quot;The World (in a Wrapper)&quot; (May 1993). It was recorded between March and May 1992 at Rhinoceros Studios, with Day providing vocals, guitar and bass guitar; and Polin on vocals, drums and percussion. McFarlane opined that these releases &quot;were unable to repeat the spectacular success of their predecessors but kept Ratcat in the public eye.&quot;

In January 1995, the band released &quot;Rain&quot;, which was produced by Tony Cohen, and EP &quot;The Smiler&quot; in August 1995, and started work on a new album, &quot;Easy Rider&quot;. The band sporadically played live shows over the next few years and &quot;Easy Rider&quot; was eventually released in July 1997.

Ratcat re-emerged in 1998 to play at the Homebake Festival with a new bass guitarist, Nic Dalton (ex-The Plunderers, Sneeze, The Lemonheads, among others). They also collaborated with John Paul Young – who supplied backing vocals – on a cover version of his earlier single, &quot;I Hate the Music&quot; (September 1998). It was included on the soundtrack for the feature film, &quot;Occasional Coarse Language&quot; (November 1998). The band officially disbanded in 1998.

===2002–present: periodic performances===
The group played a few shows in 2002, including a spot at the Big Day Out, and, in 2006, were a support act on the Psychedelic Furs Australian tour. They did a further gig at The Jack Daniel&#x27;s music awards and played, in early June 2006, at the Come Together festival at Luna Park. In 2011, they played a show at The Factory in Marrickville, to mark the 20th anniversary of &quot;Blind Love&quot;.
A 2010 TV ad for Bonds&#x27; brassieres featured a group of women dressed in the branded underwear performing a cover version of Ratcat&#x27;s &quot;That Ain&#x27;t Bad&quot; on a street float. An apparently shocked Day made a brief appearance as a passer by, wearing his once signature black and white striped T-shirt and black jeans, reminiscent of the look he sported in early Ratcat videos. He has also appeared with Sydney bands including the Art, and the Glimmer (formerly the Mansons). In 2011 Ratcat were confirmed for Sydney&#x27;s Homebake festival, subtitled &quot;The Classic Edition&quot;.

The band played as part of the &quot;A Day on the Green&quot; concert series in March 2016, with Hoodoo Gurus, Sunnyboys, Violent Femmes and Died Pretty.

In October 2023, Ratcat will release &quot;All Stripped Back&quot;, a re-recording of their greatest hits.

<doc id="1049876" wikidata="Q173359" url="?curid=1049876" title="Logic family">
<text>In computer engineering, a logic family is one of two related concepts:
* A logic family of monolithic digital integrated circuit devices is a group of electronic logic gates constructed using one of several different designs, usually with compatible logic levels and power supply characteristics within a family. Many logic families were produced as individual components, each containing one or a few related basic logical functions, which could be used as &quot;building-blocks&quot; to create systems or as so-called &quot;glue&quot; to interconnect more complex integrated circuits.
* A logic family may also be a set of techniques used to implement logic within VLSI integrated circuits such as central processors, memories, or other complex functions. Some such logic families use static techniques to minimize design complexity. Other such logic families, such as domino logic, use clocked dynamic techniques to minimize size, power consumption and delay.

Before the widespread use of integrated circuits, various solid-state and vacuum-tube logic systems were used but these were never as standardized and interoperable as the integrated-circuit devices. The most common logic family in modern semiconductor devices is metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) logic, due to low power consumption, small transistor sizes, and high transistor density.

== Technologies ==

The list of packaged building-block logic families can be divided into categories, listed here in roughly chronological order of introduction, along with their usual abbreviations:
* Resistor–transistor logic (RTL)
** Direct-coupled transistor logic (DCTL)
** Direct-coupled unipolar transistor logic (DCUTL)
** Resistor–capacitor–transistor logic (RCTL)
* Emitter-coupled logic (ECL)
** Positive emitter-coupled logic (PECL)
** Low-voltage PECL (LVPECL)
** Complementary transistor micrologic (CTuL)
* Diode–transistor logic (DTL)
** Complemented transistor diode logic (CTDL)
** High-threshold logic (HTL)
* Transistor–transistor logic (TTL)
* Metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) logic
** P-type MOS (PMOS) logic
** N-type MOS (NMOS) logic
*** Depletion-load NMOS logic
*** High-density NMOS (HMOS)
** Complementary MOS (CMOS) logic
** Bipolar MOS (BiMOS) logic
*** Bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS)
* Integrated injection logic (I2L)
* Gunning transceiver logic (GTL)

The families (RTL, DTL, and ECL) were derived from the logic circuits used in early computers, originally implemented using discrete components. One example is the Philips NORBIT family of logic building blocks.

The PMOS and I2L logic families were used for relatively short periods, mostly in special purpose custom large-scale integration circuits devices and are generally considered obsolete. For example, early digital clocks or electronic calculators may have used one or more PMOS devices to provide most of the logic for the finished product. The F14 CADC, Intel 4004, Intel 4040, and Intel 8008 microprocessors and their support chips were PMOS.

Of these families, only ECL, TTL, NMOS, CMOS, and BiCMOS are currently still in widespread use. ECL is used for very high-speed applications because of its price and power demands, while NMOS logic is mainly used in VLSI circuits applications such as CPUs and memory chips which fall outside of the scope of this article. Present-day &quot;building block&quot; logic gate ICs are based on the ECL, TTL, CMOS, and BiCMOS families.

==Resistor–transistor logic (RTL)==
Class of digital circuits built using resistors as the input network and bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) as switching devices.

The Atanasoff–Berry Computer used resistor-coupled vacuum tube logic circuits similar to RTL. Several early transistorized computers (e.g., IBM 1620, 1959) used RTL, where it was implemented using discrete components.

A family of simple resistor–transistor logic integrated circuits was developed at Fairchild Semiconductor for the Apollo Guidance Computer in 1962. Texas Instruments soon introduced its own family of RTL. A variant with integrated capacitors, RCTL, had increased speed, but lower immunity to noise than RTL. This was made by Texas Instruments as their &quot;51XX&quot; series.

==Diode–transistor logic (DTL)==
Class of digital circuits in which the logic gating function (e.g., AND) is performed by a diode network and the amplifying function is performed by a transistor.

Diode logic was used with vacuum tubes in the earliest electronic computers in the 1940s including ENIAC. Diode–transistor logic (DTL) was used in the IBM 608 which was the first all-transistorized computer. Early transistorized computers were implemented using discrete transistors, resistors, diodes and capacitors.

The first diode–transistor logic family of integrated circuits was introduced by Signetics in 1962. DTL was also made by Fairchild and Westinghouse. A family of diode logic and diode–transistor logic integrated circuits was developed by Texas Instruments for the D-37C Minuteman II Guidance Computer in 1962, but these devices were not available to the public.

A variant of DTL called &quot;high-threshold logic&quot; incorporated Zener diodes to create a large offset between logic 1 and logic 0 voltage levels. These devices usually ran off a 15 volt power supply and were found in industrial control, where the high differential was intended to minimize the effect of noise.

==PMOS and NMOS logic==

P-type MOS (PMOS) logic uses p-channel MOSFETs to implement logic gates and other digital circuits. N-type MOS (NMOS) logic uses n-channel MOSFETs to implement logic gates and other digital circuits.

For devices of equal current driving capability, n-channel MOSFETs can be made smaller than p-channel MOSFETs, due to p-channel charge carriers (holes) having lower mobility than do n-channel charge carriers (electrons), and producing only one type of MOSFET on a silicon substrate is cheaper and technically simpler. These were the driving principles in the design of NMOS logic which uses n-channel MOSFETs exclusively. However, neglecting leakage current, unlike CMOS logic, NMOS logic consumes power even when no switching is taking place.

The MOSFET invented at Bell Labs between 1955 and 1960, had both pMOS and nMOS devices with a 20 μm process. Their original MOSFET devices had a gate length of 20μm and a gate oxide thickness of 100 nm. However, the nMOS devices were impractical, and only the pMOS type were practical working devices. A more practical NMOS process was developed several years later. NMOS was initially faster than CMOS, thus NMOS was more widely used for computers in the 1970s. With advances in technology, CMOS logic displaced NMOS logic in the mid-1980s to become the preferred process for digital chips.

==Emitter-coupled logic (ECL)==
ECL uses an overdriven bipolar junction transistor (BJT) differential amplifier with single-ended input and limited emitter current. 

The ECL family, ECL is also known as current-mode logic (CML), was invented by IBM as current steering logic for use in the transistorized IBM 7030 Stretch computer, where it was implemented using discrete components.

The first ECL logic family to be available in integrated circuits was introduced by Motorola as &quot;MECL&quot; in 1962.

==Transistor–transistor logic (TTL)==
In TTL logic, bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) perform the logic and amplifying functions.

The first transistor–transistor logic family of integrated circuits was introduced by Sylvania as &quot;Sylvania Universal High–Level Logic&quot; (SUHL) in 1963. Texas Instruments introduced the 7400 series TTL family in 1964. Transistor–transistor logic uses bipolar transistors to form its integrated circuits. TTL has changed significantly over the years, with newer versions replacing the older types.

Since the transistors of a standard TTL gate are saturated switches, minority carrier storage time in each junction limits the switching speed of the device. Variations on the basic TTL design are intended to reduce these effects and improve speed, power consumption, or both.

The German physicist Walter H. Schottky formulated a theory predicting the Schottky effect, which led to the Schottky diode and later Schottky transistors. For the same power dissipation, Schottky transistors have a faster switching speed than conventional transistors because the Schottky diode prevents the transistor from saturating and storing charge; see Baker clamp. Logic gates built with Schottky transistors switch faster than TTL gates built with ordinary BJTs but consume more power. With Low-power Schottky (LS), internal resistance values were increased to reduce power consumption and increase switching speed over the original version. The introduction of Advanced Low-power Schottky (ALS) further increased speed and reduced power consumption. A faster logic family called FAST (Fairchild Advanced Schottky TTL) (Schottky) (F) was also introduced that was faster than original Schottky TTL.

==Complementary MOS (CMOS) logic==
CMOS logic gates use complementary arrangements of enhancement-mode N-channel and P-channel field effect transistor. Since the initial devices used oxide-isolated metal gates, they were called CMOS (complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor logic). In contrast to TTL, CMOS uses almost no power in the static state (that is, when inputs are not changing). A CMOS gate draws no current other than leakage when in a steady 1 or 0 state. When the gate switches states, current is drawn from the power supply to charge the capacitance at the output of the gate. This means that the current draw of CMOS devices increases with switching rate (controlled by clock speed, typically).

The first CMOS family of logic integrated circuits was introduced by RCA as &quot;CD4000 COS/MOS&quot;, the 4000 series, in 1968. Initially CMOS logic was slower than LS-TTL. However, because the logic thresholds of CMOS were proportional to the power supply voltage, CMOS devices were well-adapted to battery-operated systems with simple power supplies. CMOS gates can also tolerate much wider voltage ranges than TTL gates because the logic thresholds are (approximately) proportional to power supply voltage, and not the fixed levels required by bipolar circuits.

The required silicon area for implementing such digital CMOS functions has rapidly shrunk. VLSI technology incorporating millions of basic logic operations onto one chip, almost exclusively uses CMOS. The extremely small capacitance of the on-chip wiring caused an increase in performance by several orders of magnitude. On-chip clock rates as high as 4 GHz have become common, approximately 1000 times faster than the technology by 1970.

===Lowering the power supply voltage===
CMOS chips often work with a broader range of power supply voltages than other logic families. Early TTL ICs required a power supply voltage of 5V, but early CMOS could use 3 to 15V. Lowering the supply voltage reduces the charge stored on any capacitances and consequently reduces the energy required for a logic transition. Reduced energy implies less heat dissipation. The energy stored in a capacitance &quot;C&quot; and changing &quot;V&quot; volts is ½ &quot;CV&quot;2. By lowering the power supply from 5V to 3.3V, switching power was reduced by almost 60 percent (power dissipation is proportional to the square of the supply voltage). Many motherboards have a voltage regulator module to provide the even lower power supply voltages required by many CPUs.

===HC logic===

Because of the incompatibility of the CD4000 series of chips with the previous TTL family, a new standard emerged which combined the best of the TTL family with the advantages of the CD4000 family. It was known as the 74HC (which used anywhere from 3.3V to 5V power supplies (and used logic levels relative to the power supply)), and with devices that used 5V power supplies and TTL logic levels.

===The CMOS–TTL logic level problem===

Interconnecting any two logic families often required special techniques such as additional pull-up resistors, or purpose-built interface circuits, since the logic families may use different voltage levels to represent 1 and 0 states, and may have other interface requirements only met within the logic family.

TTL logic levels are different from those of CMOS – generally a TTL output does not rise high enough to be reliably recognized as a logic 1 by a CMOS input. This problem was solved by the invention of the 74HCT family of devices that uses CMOS technology but TTL input logic levels. These devices only work with a 5V power supply. They form a replacement for TTL, although HCT is slower than original TTL (HC logic has about the same speed as original TTL).

===Other CMOS families===

Other CMOS circuit families within integrated circuits include cascode voltage switch logic (CVSL) and pass transistor logic (PTL) of various sorts. These are generally used &quot;on-chip&quot; and are not delivered as building-block medium-scale or small-scale integrated circuits. 

==Bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS) logic==

One major improvement was to combine CMOS inputs and TTL drivers to form of a new type of logic devices called BiCMOS logic, of which the LVT and ALVT logic families are the most important. The BiCMOS family has many members, including ABT logic, ALB logic, ALVT logic, BCT logic and LVT logic.

===Improved versions===
With HC and HCT logic and LS-TTL logic competing in the market it became clear that further improvements were needed to create the &quot;ideal&quot; logic device that combined high speed, with low power dissipation and compatibility with older logic families. A whole range of newer families has emerged that use CMOS technology. A short list of the most important family designators of these newer devices includes:
* LV logic (lower supply voltage)
* LVT logic (lower supply voltage while retaining TTL logic levels)
* ALVT logic (an &#x27;advanced&#x27; version of LVT logic)

There are many others including AC/ACT logic, AHC/AHCT logic, ALVC logic, AUC logic, AVC logic, CBT logic, CBTLV logic, FCT logic and LVC logic (LVCMOS).

==Integrated injection logic (IIL)==

The integrated injection logic (IIL or I2L) uses bipolar transistors in a current-steering arrangement to implement logic functions. It was used in some integrated circuits, but it is now considered obsolete.

==Monolithic integrated circuit logic families compared==

The following logic families would either have been used to build up systems from functional blocks such as flip-flops, counters, and gates, or else would be used as &quot;glue&quot; logic to interconnect very-large scale integration devices such as memory and processors. Not shown are some early obscure logic families from the early 1960s such as DCTL (direct-coupled transistor logic), which did not become widely available.

&quot;Propagation delay&quot; is the time taken for a two-input NAND gate to produce a result after a change of state at its inputs. &quot;Toggle speed&quot; represents the fastest speed at which a J-K flip flop could operate. &quot;Power per gate&quot; is for an individual 2-input NAND gate; usually there would be more than one gate per IC package. Values are very typical and would vary slightly depending on application conditions, manufacturer, temperature, and particular type of logic circuit. &quot;Introduction year&quot; is when at least some of the devices of the family were available in volume for civilian uses. Some military applications pre-dated civilian use.

== On-chip design styles ==

Several techniques and design styles are primarily used in designing large single-chip application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) and CPUs, rather than generic logic families intended for use in multi-chip applications.

These design styles can typically be divided into two main categories,
static techniques and
clocked dynamic techniques.
(See static versus dynamic logic for some discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of each category).

=== Static logic ===
* Pulsed static CMOS
* Differential cascode voltage switch (DCVS)
* Cascode non-threshold logic (CNTL)
* Pass-gate/transmission-gate logic: pass transistor logic (PTL)
* Complementary pass-gate logic (CPL)
* Push–pull logic
* Output prediction logic (OPL)
* Cascode voltage switch logic (CVSL)

=== Dynamic logic ===
* four-phase logic
* domino logic
* Footless domino
* NORA/zipper logic
* Multiple-output domino
* Compound domino
* Dual-rail domino
* Self-resetting domino
* Sample-set differential logic
* Limited-switch dynamic logic

<text>Whirlywirld were an Australian post-punk band led by Ollie Olsen in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the first of his musical collaborations with drummer John Murphy. They played in Melbourne and Sydney and were supporters of the Melbourne little band scene.

==Biography==
In 1976, as a guitarist, Ollie Olsen formed The Reals, who on occasion shared the bill at suburban dance halls with The Boys Next Door. The Reals would eventually evolve into The Negatives, but before that Olsen had become dissatisfied with the group, and left. Olsen went on to form The Young Charlatans. The Young Charlatans&#x27; four members would all go on to distinguish themselves in long music careers: they included Olsen, guitarist Rowland Howard (later of The Boys Next Door/The Birthday Party, as well as These Immortal Souls), drummer Jeffrey Wegener (Laughing Clowns) and bassist Janine Hall (later of The Saints). The group was short lived and after a brief, stormy existence, the band broke up. By then Olsen had met John Murphy, the drummer for another early Melbourne punk band, NEWS.

The pair formed Whirlywirld in 1978 with their stated priority, from the outset, to use synthesisers and other non-&#x27;rock&#x27; instruments, departing from a guitar-based format. Whirlywirld was completed by two keyboardists, credited with &#x27;electronics&#x27;, Andrew Duffield and Simon Smith (Olsen, by this point, had abandoned guitar in favour of &#x27;electronics&#x27;) together with guitarist Dean Richards. Whirlywirld only played live very infrequently but they did rehearse on a rigid schedule.

In June 1979, the band released a self-titled debut EP. Whirlywirld made their live debut at The Crystal Ballroom later that year, by which time Duffield left to join The Models and had been replaced by Philip Jackson.

Whirlywirld would go on to play only fourteen performances in their entire career. Gradually, the personnel within the band changed, in accordance with a change in direction, Richards, Jackson and Smith departed. Richards and Jackson went on to two popular local &#x27;underground&#x27; bands in Melbourne, Equal Local and Hot Half Hour, In the 2000s Richards records and performs as Disturbed Earth. Arnie Hanna came in on guitar and Greg Sun on bass. During this period Murphy played an array of percussion devices, natural, electronic or otherwise and Olsen even played saxophone, clarinet, tape loops as well as keyboards. This incarnation of the band recorded at York St. Studios in December, 1979. Four of these tracks came out on a 12&quot; EP, again titled &quot;Whirlywirld&quot; in February 1980.

After the band split, Olsen and Murphy went on to form firstly The Beast Apparel, and then Hugo Klang, which performed a handful of gigs in England, and recorded a single, &quot;Beat Up The Old Shack&quot;, released in Australia on Prince Melon Records. Olsen and Murphy then went on to form Orchestra of Skin and Bone, before their musical partnership ended with Olsen going to form NO in the late 1980s.

Hanna and Murphy later played with Olsen and Michael Hutchence in the band Max Q.

A version of one of Whirlywirld&#x27;s songs, &quot;Win/Lose&quot;, was re-recorded by Olsen in 1986 for inclusion in the film &quot;Dogs in Space&quot;. Hutchence sang the early Whirlywirld song, &quot;Rooms for the Memory&quot; on the soundtrack, and the song became a hit on the mainstream Australian charts in 1987. The remixed version of &quot;Win/Lose&quot; was also released as a single by Olsen.

<text>Ollie Jngbert Christian Olsen (born Ian Christopher Olsen, 20 February 1958 – 16 October 2024) was an Australian multi-instrumentalist, composer and sound designer. From the mid-1970s until his later years, he performed, recorded and produced rock, electronic and experimental music. His post-punk groups included Whirlywirld (1978–80), Orchestra of Skin and Bone (1984–86) and No (1987–89). Olsen joined with Michael Hutchence (of INXS) to form a short-term band, Max Q, which issued an album in 1989. He co-founded the alternative electronic music record label Psy-Harmonics with Andrew Till in 1993. In 2014 he formed Taipan Tiger Girls.

== Biography ==
Ollie Jngbert Christian Olsen (born Ian Christopher Olsen) was born in 1958 in Melbourne. He grew up with a sibling in suburban Blackburn and when he was 11 years-old the family spent four months in Norway in mid-1969.

Olsen developed an interest in electronic music as a teenager in the mid-1970s, studying with Felix Werder. Olsen issued a range of work from experimental to film and television soundtracks, pop and dance music, installation projects and established record labels. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, he is &quot;recognised as one of the key figures in the Australian post-punk electronic movement of the late 1970s. Ever the experimentalist, Olsen&#x27;s eclectic career in avant rock took him from the Reals, one of the original Melbourne punk combos of the late 1970s, through to the acid-house/techno/trance outfit Third Eye. He was also the driving force behind the Psy-Harmonics label.&quot;

=== Melbourne in the 1970s and 1980s ===
In the late 1970s Olsen formed two punk, post-punk bands, as leader and vocalist, as well as being a key figure in the Melbourne little band scene. His punk bands included the Reals and the Young Charlatans. Aside from Olsen on guitar, the Reals&#x27; line-up was Peter Cave on drums, Gary Gray on lead vocals and Chris Walsh on bass guitar. At the end of 1977 he formed the Young Charlatans with Janine Hall on bass guitar, Rowland S. Howard on guitar (ex-Obsessions) and Jeffrey Wegener on drums (ex-Saints). Australian music journalist Clinton Walker described this band as having &quot;inner-city &#x27;supergroup&#x27; status from the outset and helped pioneer post-punk rock in Australia.&quot;

Howard had written his iconic song &quot;Shivers&quot; while with the Young Charlatans, it was later recorded and released by a group Howard joined soon afterwards, The Boys Next Door. Young Charlatans recorded the first (and second) version of &quot;Shivers&quot; as part of their unreleased demos, which were made by Bruce Milne for a future single on his Au Go Go Records label.

The Young Charlatans broke up in May 1978 and Olsen, on lead vocals, synthesiser, clarinet and saxophone, formed Whirlywirld, with Andrew Duffield on synthesiser, John Murphy on drums (ex-the News), Dean Richards on guitar and Simon Smith on synthesiser. Their debut self-titled three-track extended play was released in June 1979 via Missing Link Records. Olsen wrote two tracks and co-wrote the third with Murphy. The group issued a second self-titled EP in February 1980. The first 500 copies also included a bonus single, &quot;Sextronics&quot;, but Whirlywirld disbanded before it appeared.

Olsen and Murphy relocated to the United Kingdom in early 1980 on the recommendation of Iggy Pop. &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;″ Jonathan Green reported that &quot;The Ig was impressed with the band&#x27;s first EP when out here last year&quot;. The duo formed the Beast Apparel, which later became Hugo Klang, and released a single, &quot;Grand Life for Fools and Idiots&quot;, in 1982. Olsen returned to Australia in the following year and continued Hugo Klang with Alan Bamford, Tom Hoy and Laughton Ellery, before this group split up in 1983.

In 1984 Olsen on vocals and guitar, Marie Hoy on keyboards and vocals and Murphy as drummer formed &quot;an avant-garde outfit&quot;, Orchestra of Skin and Bone. Marie Hoy had been an instigator of the Melbourne &#x27;little bands&#x27; scene, as a member of Too Fat to Fit Through the Door and others. Other musicians associated with Orchestra of Skin and Bone included David Hoy on cello, Tom Hoy on saxophone, Lochie Kirkwood on vocals and saxophone, Dugald McKenzie on vocals and harmonica, James Rogers on trumpet and Peter Scully on guitar. They issued a self-titled album in 1986 and disbanded soon afterwards. The following year, Ollie formed No, with Olsen on keyboards, vocals, drum machine and sampler, Marie Hoy on keyboards, vocals and samples alongside Kevin McMahon on bass guitar and Michael Sheridan on guitar in 1987.

=== &quot;Dogs in Space&quot; to &quot;Max Q&quot; ===

Film director Richard Lowenstein asked Olsen to appear in and work as music director for his feature film, &quot;Dogs in Space&quot; (December 1986). Olsen supervised the reforming of acts from the late 1970s little band scene and produced music recordings for the soundtrack. He re-recorded material by Whirlywirld including two singles, &quot;Win/Lose&quot; (April 1987) as a solo effort, and &quot;Rooms for the Memory&quot; (February) by the film&#x27;s star, Michael Hutchence (of INXS). The film also featured Marie Hoy singing &quot;Shivers&quot;. In a 2009 interview, following the restoration of the original film for a DVD release, Lowenstein told Trevor Block:
But Whirlywirld were always the ones for me. I mean, their music is in the movie itself, over the end credits. And the great thing about Ollie [Olsen], and one of the reasons I asked him to do so much in the movie, is that his songs have always had a feel to them, a kind of mood that fitted in with what we were doing. You&#x27;d die to make a video for some of his songs, he uses so many great images, and the rhythms he uses are amazing as well.

In 1989 Olsen and Hutchence collaborated on a musical project, Max Q, co-producing a self-titled album combining electronic music with orchestra, bass, guitar and backing vocals. The Max Q band included Arne Hanna (guitar), Bill McDonald (bass), John Murphy (drums, percussion), Michael Sheridan (guitar) and Gus Till (keyboards). After recording Olsen and Hutchence travelled to New York City to mix the tracks with DJ Todd Terry.

Max Q is featured in the 2019 film &quot;Mystify&quot; by Richard Lowenstein.

=== 1990s onwards ===
Olsen returned to Australia and turned his attentions to trance music, co-founding Australian electronic music label, Psy-Harmonics, with Gus Till&#x27;s brother, Andrew Till, and recording under the name Third Eye. From the 1990s onwards, he worked increasingly in sound design and score for film and score for television.

Olsen lectured on and taught electronic music at various universities and symposia, and also performed with a wide variety of international artists.

As of 2006, Olsen was working on a number of recording projects—mostly electro-acoustic pieces—with artists from Australia, Japan and South Africa, for performance and release in 2006. Olsen&#x27;s musical output that year consisted of the release of the album, &quot;I Am The Server&quot; (13 February 2006), through the Greek record label, Creative Space, and the release of an electro-acoustic album, entitled &quot;Simulated&quot;. &quot;I Am The Server&quot; was composed, recorded and engineered by Olsen, with additional music from Bill McDonald and Peter Luscombe; the album was mastered by Simon Pool at LGM studios and the album artwork was produced by Maro Kassoti. &quot;Simulated&quot; was composed, performed and engineered by Olsen, between 1999 and 2006, mastered by Simon Pool at LGM studios, in January 2006, and the album artwork was, again, produced by Maro Kassoti.

In January 2019, Olsen announced his retirement from music via Facebook.

<text>Alsta is an island in Alstahaug Municipality and Leirfjord Municipality in Nordland county, Norway. The island is surrounded by the Vefsnfjorden to the east, the Leirfjorden to the north, and the Alstenfjorden to the south and west. The eastern part of the island is dominated by the Seven Sisters mountain range () which has five mountains that are more than tall, while the western part of the island is relatively flat and it is the location of the town of Sandnessjøen and the village of Søvika in the south. Historically, the island was known as &quot;Alsten&quot; or &quot;Alstein&quot;.
The long island has an area of , and its highest point is the mountain Botnkrona, which reaches above sea level. In 2017, there were 6,969 residents on the island. The islands of Altra and Skålværet lie to the southwest, the islands of Tjøtta, Offersøya, Mindlandet, and Rødøya lie to the south, surrounding the entrance to the Vefsnfjorden.

The island is connected to the mainland by the Helgeland Bridge on Norwegian County Road 17, which connects the northern part of the island to Leirfjord Municipality on the mainland. This same highway 17 continues across the island from north to south where it then connects by bridge to the nearby islands of Offersøya and Tjøtta. 

The eastern part of the island is often called the &quot;backside&quot; of the island since it is on the other side of the mountains from the more populous side. This &quot;backside&quot; lies inside Leirfjord Municipality and the Sundøy Bridge connects the Sundøya village area on the backside of the island to the mainland.

<text>The Energy Task Force, officially the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG), was a task force created by U.S. President George W. Bush in 2001 during his second week in office. Vice President Dick Cheney was named chairman. This group&#x27;s stated objective was to “develop a national energy policy designed to help the private sector, and, as necessary and appropriate, State and local governments, promote dependable, affordable, and environmentally sound production and distribution of energy for the future.&quot; The final report was released on May 16, 2001.

The Bush Transition Energy Advisory Team shaped the administration&#x27;s supply-side energy policy administration and was a precursor to the Energy Task Force.

==Background==
Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham told a National Energy Summit on March 19, 2001, that America was going to face an energy supply crisis in the next 20 years. He believed that if America was not adequately prepared for those demands then the foundations for the prosperity of the country would be threatened. The Energy Task Force was developed to decrease American dependency on foreign petroleum, which the National Energy Policy deemed would have a negative effect on the US economy, standards of living and national security.

The Task Force was composed of Vice President Dick Cheney and the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Transportation and Energy, as well as other cabinet and senior administration-level officials. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), these members held ten meetings over the course of three and a half months with petroleum, coal, nuclear, natural gas, and electricity industry representatives and lobbyists. None of the meetings were open to the public and no non-federal participants were involved. The first phase of the project was to inform the President of current energy supply problems and changes needed to the economic policy. This was completed on March 19, 2001, while the second phase, the presentation of the National Energy Policy, was completed on May 16, 2001.

The GAO stated that &quot;the National Energy Policy report was the product of a centralized, top-down, short- term, and labor-intensive process that involved the efforts of several hundred federal employees governmentwide&quot;. This meant that the cabinet officials members held the authority in developing the report, while working groups drafted sample reports and findings for them.

==National Energy Policy==
The National Energy Policy Development Group completed its report in the beginning of 2001. The 169- page report, released on May 17, 2001, was titled the National Energy Policy (NEP).

Included in the proposed policy is the importance of energy efficiency and conservation. Using energy wisely is cited as the first challenge for the nation, as this will lessen the burden on our finances and the environment. The second listed challenge was to repair and add to the existing network of refineries, pipelines, generators and transmission lines. It was stated that the refining and distribution of natural gas were affected by an inefficient and inadequate infrastructure and that this issue could be remedied by 38,000 miles of new pipeline and 255,000 miles of distribution lines. The third challenge is &quot;increasing energy supplies while protecting the environment&quot;. This section states that although renewable energy is a hope for the future, it will be many years until this energy is sufficient for the nations current needs, and therefore the requirements must be met using the available means.

===Foreign energy sources===
One of the widely disputed aspects of the proposed National Energy Policy is how the plan suggests balancing needs for future sources of renewable energy with the immediate reliance on petroleum. In Chapter Six of the policy, titled &quot;Nature’s Power: Increasing America’s Use of Renewable and Alternative Energy&quot;, domestic energy sources such as wind, geothermal, solar and bio-fuel are cited as necessary to stabilize and protect the United States&#x27; interests. Future energy sources such as hydrogen and fusion are also cited as long-term projects. However, the Policy also states the necessity for plans to improve and expand the current pipeline systems within the US, implying that reliance on oil and natural gas will exist for years to come. The plan then goes on to detail American interests in foreign energy resources. In a section titled &quot;Diversity of Supply&quot;, the policy explains why diversifying dependence on foreign oil is a key factor in securing short term stability. Canada, South America and the Caribbean, Africa, Russia and Asia were all detailed as having supplies of oil that could add to the supply of resources available to US consumption.

==President Barack Obama&#x27;s energy policy==
===Protecting American energy===
During Barack Obama&#x27;s presidency, America saw an increase in oil production. It was especially high in the year of 2011. The Obama administration took steps to ensure that America&#x27;s need for oil would also safeguard the protection of the environment as well. Although oil production has increased, America&#x27;s dependency on foreign oil has decreased. The total consumption of imported oil has decreased from 57% in 2008 to 45% in 2011, which is the lowest it has been for about 20 years.

President Obama made strict guidelines to standardize fuel economy in vehicles, especially passenger vehicles. Statistically, vehicles with fuel economy benefits improve the environment and lower fuel costs. The Obama Administration finalized a new regulation that would require commercial trucks, vans, and buses produced in the years 2014–2018 to be tested for national fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission standards. Barack Obama has also made investments to manufacture efficient batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles. The Administration is funding research that would help increase the use of natural gas and reduce oil consumption.

===Adjusting to climatic changes===
Another goal that President Barack Obama had in regards to efficient energy use was to reduce emissions that are unsafe to the environment, which in turn would result in climate change and cause air and water pollution. He made efforts to gather other world leaders, in December 2009, and have them agree to make this an international endeavor. It has been noted that the Obama Administration has made the largest investment in the American history to have clean energy through renewable power generation. One of the ways to ensure this goal is by monitoring greenhouse gas emissions from direct and indirect sources. President Obama has started a Climate Change Adaptation Task Force, to aid in policies and programs on a Federal level. With the use of interagency decisions can be made on how to protect the environment and local communities against changing climatic conditions. The agency also created strategies that would shield wildlife and freshwater resources.

===Protecting the environment as a whole===
On the grand scale, President Obama is taking measures to protect the American soil, the bodies of water and the atmosphere from severe pollution and other problems caused by inefficient energy use. He plans to have an interagency collaboration on a Federal level so that the environmental issues facing America could be solved or even brought down. The Recovery Act of 1999 has programs and projects that would entail the protection of our environment through agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Interior. These agencies oversee funding for many big projects like those that promote going green. The Act also invests in advancing in technology so that American people can enjoy the long-term effects of a clean environment. The National Ocean Policy looks after resources that are critical to America and prioritize them accordingly. They ensure that United States has oceans and coastal regions that healthy that people can enjoy.

In his efforts to preserve and conserve land, Obama signed the Omnibus Public Land Management Act in 2009. Through this act he was able to vastly expand American land. The Clean Water Act already does some regulation to protect the American waters. Nonetheless, a draft has been submitted requesting a specific list of those water bodies protected under this list and which ones are considered federally controlled water bodies. The Obama Administration has now modernized the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in order to allow a fair governing on the quality of our environment. The revision is for better and improved efforts by the Federal agencies on protecting communities, the economy and also to find ways to get the American public to be involved in the decision making.

==Controversy==
Most of the activities of the Energy Task Force have not been disclosed to the public, even though Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests (since 19 April 2001) have sought to gain access to its materials. The organisations Judicial Watch and Sierra Club launched a lawsuit (U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia: Judicial Watch Inc. v. Department of Energy, et al., Civil Action No. 01-0981) under the FOIA to gain access to the task force&#x27;s materials. Additionally, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), an environmental advocacy group, filed a suit to obtain the records of the task force meeting in April 2001. In the spring of 2002, the U.S. Department of Energy released approximately 13,500 pages to the NRDC related to the NEP. After several years of legal wrangling, in May, 2005 an appeals court permitted the Energy Task Force&#x27;s records to remain secret.

In 2001, the energy task force that Cheney had commenced in secret finally went public. Soon afterwards, the United States House of Representatives approved the measures and decided to legalize the new policy set forth by Cheney. Upon revision of the policy it was evident that many of the regulations and recommendations were pro-Oil company. The policy assigned little accountability for mistakes or harmful actions to those in authority, especially the government officials. This policy was to provide very specific guidelines to run the Energy Task Force efficiently and effectively.

The NEP was intended to be a directive with clear instructions on how to proceed with the new task force. Despite the fact that renewable energy was the purpose behind establishing this force, only seven of the 105 recommendations in the final report referenced renewable energy. Many of the big oil companies benefited from the policy. There is some speculation, however, that some of the congressmen profited from the policy due to the major contributions they got from these companies.

On April 4, 2001, representatives of 13 environmental groups, including Erich Pica of Friends of the Earth and Anna Aurilio of the U.S. Public Interest Group, met with the Task Force (although not with Vice President Cheney personally). Environmental groups have speculated that this meeting was an attempt to appease them, since it is reported that a draft paper had already been produced at the time of this meeting and that half of the meeting was spent on various members introducing themselves. No further meetings between the task force and the environmental groups were reported, although there had been at least 40 meetings between the task force and representatives of the energy industry and its interest groups.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported on November 15, 2005, that it had obtained documents listing executives from major oil corporations, including ExxonMobil, Conoco, Royal Dutch Shell, and the American subsidiary of BP who met with Energy Task Force participants while they were developing national energy policy. Vice President Cheney was reported to have met personally with the chief executive officer of BP during the time of the Energy Task Force&#x27;s activities. In the week prior to this article revealing oil executive involvement, the Chief Executives of ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips told members of the US Senate that they had not participated as part of the Energy Task Force, while the CEO of BP stated that he did not know. In response to questions regarding the article, Cheney spokesperson Lea Ann McBride was quoted as saying that the courts have upheld &quot;the constitutional right of the president and vice president to obtain information in confidentiality.&quot;

On July 18, 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported the names of those involved in the Task Force, including at least 40 meetings with interest groups, most of them from energy-producing industries. Among those in the meetings were James J. Rouse, then vice president of ExxonMobil and a major donor to the Bush inauguration; Kenneth L. Lay, then head of Enron; Jack N. Gerard, then with the National Mining Association; Red Cavaney, president of the American Petroleum Institute; and Eli Bebout, an old friend of Cheney&#x27;s from Wyoming who serves in the state Senate and owns an oil and drilling company.

<doc id="1049912" wikidata="Q3124000" url="?curid=1049912" title="The Perfect Kiss">
<text>&quot;The Perfect Kiss&quot; is the ninth single by the British alternative dance and rock band New Order. It was recorded at Britannia Row Studios in London and released on 13 May 1985. It is the first New Order song to be released as a single while also included on a studio album (&quot;Low-Life&quot;). The vinyl version has Factory catalogue number FAC 123 and the video has the opposite number, FAC 321.

==Background==
The song&#x27;s themes include love (&quot;We believe in a land of love&quot;) and death (&quot;the perfect kiss is the kiss of death&quot;). The overall meaning of the song is unclear to its writer today. In an interview with &quot;GQ&quot; magazine Bernard Sumner said &quot;I haven&#x27;t a clue what this is about.&quot; He agreed with the interviewer that his best known lyric is in the song: &quot;Pretending not to see his gun / I said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s go out and have some fun&#x27;&quot;. The lyrics, he added, came about after the band was visiting a man&#x27;s house in the United States who showed his guns under his bed before they went out for an enjoyable night. It had been quickly written, recorded and mixed without sleep before the band went on tour in Australia. 

The song has been remixed by third parties like Razormaid and Hot Tracks and has been covered by bands including Capsule Giants, Nude,
International,
Paradoxx, Razed in a New Division of Agony,
and Amoeba Crunch.

==Reception==
John Leland of &quot;Spin&quot; wrote, &quot;A dreamy, melancholy melody runs over the electronic and unfortunately guitar-less hooks. But the best part is the end, when they turn all the machines to max and mash the thing up.&quot;

==Video==
An 11-minute live version of the song was filmed by Jonathon Demme in 1985, which &quot;Billboard&quot; in 2017 termed New Order&#x27;s &quot;most arresting visual ever.&quot;

<doc id="1049922" wikidata="Q5234874" url="?curid=1049922" title="United States Barracuda-class submarine (1951)">
<text>The Barracuda&quot;-class submarines(originally the K-1&quot;-class submarines) were the product of Project Kayo, a research and development effort begun immediately after World War II by the United States Navy to &quot;solve the problem of using submarines to attack and destroy enemy submarines&quot;. They originally had the hull classification symbol SSK, for &quot;hunter-killer submarine&quot;. 

These submarines were originally named &quot;K-1&quot; through &quot;K-3&quot;, with hull numbers SSK-1 through SSK-3. They were renamed &quot;Barracuda&quot;, &quot;Bass&quot;, and &quot;Bonita&quot; in December 1955. In 1959 &quot;Barracuda&quot; was redesignated SST-3 (SST for training submarine), and in 1964 her main sonar was removed. A final redesignation twist was SS-T3 in 1973; for some reason the Navy wished to list her as an attack submarine. &quot;Bass&quot; was decommissioned in 1957 and redesignated SS-551 in 1959. &quot;Bonita&quot; was decommissioned in 1958 and redesignated SS-552 in 1959.

== Background ==
It was known that the Soviet Navy had acquired the German Type XXI U-boat and other advanced submarines, and was expected to rapidly put derivatives of them into production. In 1948, the US Navy prepared estimates of the number of anti-submarine warfare (ASW)-capable submarines (SSKs) that would be needed to counter the hundreds of advanced Soviet submarines that were expected to be in service by 1960. Two scenarios were considered: a reasonable scenario assuming the Soviets would build to their existing force level of about 360 submarines, and a &quot;nightmare&quot; scenario projecting that the Soviets could build submarines as fast as the Germans had built U-boats, with a force level of 2,000 submarines. The projected US SSK force levels for these scenarios were 250 for the former and 970 for the latter. By comparison, the total US submarine force at the end of World War II, excluding obsolescent training submarines, was just over 200 boats.

==Design==
The &quot;Barracuda&quot;-class SSKs were designed to be smaller than contemporary attack submarines and simpler in design and construction. It was hoped that this would allow them to be cheaply mass-produced in the large numbers it was thought would be needed to combat the growing Soviet Type XXI-derived submarine fleet. It was also thought that this would allow shipyards without submarine experience, and aircraft contractors with experience in the mass production of large complex aircraft, to build these submarines.

The primary innovation created by Kayo was a low-frequency passive bow sonar system, the BQR-4, which was originally to be wrapped around the submarine&#x27;s conning tower. Testing on showed that self-noise would greatly reduce detection range, and the sonar was relocated to the bow. Due to the large sonar dome above the torpedo tubes, in the &quot;Barracuda&quot;-class the torpedo tubes remained in their traditional bow position.

==Service==
In 1951–53, the &quot;Barracuda&quot;s were joined by seven converted &quot;Gato&quot;-class SSKs. These lost four of their six bow torpedo tubes and two of their four main diesel engines.

The advent of nuclear power, with entering service in 1955 and the Soviet Navy responding with the first November-class submarine only three years later, created a revolution in ASW. Nuclear submarines could maintain a high speed at deep depths indefinitely. The conventional SSKs would be useless against nuclear-powered boats, except possibly in shallow water. As nuclear attack submarines were developed and deployed, they took up the ASW mission. All ten SSKs were redesignated and decommissioned or reassigned to other duties in 1957–59.

The SSK program and particularly the &quot;Barracuda&quot; class were thus overtaken by events after a few years&#x27; service. Their sonar, however, proved excellent, with good convergence zone detection ranges against snorkeling submarines; it was retained on the former &quot;Gato&quot;-class SSKs and fitted on the first nuclear submarines and a few additional diesel submarines. The bow sonar array eventually became a bow sonar sphere, with angled, amidships torpedo tubes to make room for it in the &quot;Thresher&quot; class and all subsequent US SSN classes.

In 1958, &quot;Bonita&quot; was used as a nuclear weapons testing target at Eniwetok in the South Pacific, part of Operation Hardtack I. This was designed as shock testing rather than destructive testing, and damage was light except to electronics.

<text>The Cray XD1 was an entry-level supercomputer range, made by Cray Inc.

The XD1 uses AMD Opteron 64-bit CPUs, and utilizes the Direct Connect Architecture over HyperTransport to remove the bottleneck at the PCI and contention at the memory. The MPI latency is ¼ that of Infiniband, and 1/30 that of Gigabit Ethernet.

The XD1 was originally designed by OctigaBay Systems Corp. of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada as the OctigaBay 12K system. The company was acquired by Cray Inc. in February 2004.

Announced on 4 October 2004, the Cray XD1 range incorporate Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGAs for application acceleration. With 12 CPUs in a &quot;chassis&quot;, and up to 12 chassis installable in a &quot;rack&quot;, XD1 systems may hold several 144-CPU multiples in multirack configurations. The operating system used on the XD1 is a customized version of Linux, and the machine&#x27;s load balancing / resource management system is an enhanced version of Sun Microsystems&#x27; Sun Grid Engine.

<doc id="1049937" wikidata="Q561117" url="?curid=1049937" title="William Robert Grove">
<text>Sir William Robert Grove, FRS FRSE (11 July 1811 – 1 August 1896) was a Welsh judge and physical scientist. He anticipated the general theory of the conservation of energy, and was a pioneer of fuel cell technology. He invented the Grove voltaic cell.

==Early life==
Born in Swansea, Wales, Grove was the only child of John, a magistrate and deputy lieutenant of Glamorgan, and his wife, Anne (née Bevan).

His early education was in the hands of private tutors, before he attended Brasenose College, Oxford to study classics, though his scientific interests may have been cultivated by mathematician Baden Powell. Otherwise, his taste for science has no clear origin though his circle in Swansea was broadly educated. He graduated in 1832.

In 1835, he was called to the bar by Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. In the same year, Grove joined the Royal Institution and was a founder of the Swansea Literary and Philosophical Society, an organisation with which he maintained close links.

==Scientific work==

In 1829, at the Royal Institution, Grove met Emma Maria Powles.. They married in 1837.

The couple embarked on a tour of the continent for their honeymoon. This sabbatical offered Grove an opportunity to pursue his scientific interests and resulted in his first scientific paper suggesting some novel constructions for electric cells.

During 1839, Grove developed a novel form of electric cell, the Grove cell, which used zinc and platinum electrodes exposed to two acids and separated by a porous ceramic pot. Grove announced the latter development to the &quot;Académie des Sciences&quot; in Paris in 1839. In 1840 Grove invented one of the first incandescent electric lights, which was later perfected by Thomas Edison.

Later that year, he gave another account of his development at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Birmingham, where it aroused the interest of Michael Faraday. On Faraday&#x27;s invitation Grove presented his discoveries at the prestigious Royal Institution Friday Discourse on 13 March 1840.

Grove&#x27;s presentation made his reputation, and he was soon proposed for Fellowship of the Royal Society by such distinguished men as William Thomas Brande, William Snow Harris and Charles Wheatstone. Grove also attracted the attention of John Peter Gassiot, a relationship that resulted in Grove&#x27;s becoming the first professor of experimental philosophy at the London Institution in 1841. Grove&#x27;s inaugural lecture in 1842 was the first announcement of what Grove called the &quot;correlation of physical forces&quot;, in modern terms, the conservation of energy.
In 1842, Grove developed the first fuel cell (which he called the &quot;gas voltaic battery&quot;), which produced electrical energy by combining hydrogen and oxygen, and described it using his correlation theory. In developing the cell and showing that steam could be disassociated into oxygen and hydrogen, and the process reversed, he was the first person to demonstrate the thermal dissociation of molecules into their constituent atoms. The first demonstration of this effect, he gave privately to Faraday, Gassiot and Edward William Brayley, his scientific editor.

His work also led him to early insights into the nature of ionisation. For observations made in Ref., Grove is credited for the discovery of sputtering.

In the 1840s, he collaborated with Gassiot at the London Institution on photography and the Daguerreotype and calotype processes. Inspired by his legal practice, he presciently observed:

In 1852, he discovered striae, dark bands that occur in electrical breakdown, and investigated their character, presenting his work in an 1858 Bakerian lecture.

==&quot;On the Correlation of Physical Forces&quot;==

In 1846, Grove published &quot;On The Correlation of Physical Forces&quot; in which he anticipated the general theory of the conservation of energy that was more famously put forward in Hermann von Helmholtz&#x27; &quot;Über die Erhaltung der Kraft&quot; (&quot;On the Conservation of Force&quot;) published the following year. His 1846 Bakerian lecture relied heavily on his theory.

James Prescott Joule had been energized by his investigations into the mechanical equivalent of heat by comparing the mass of coal consumed in a steam engine with the mass of zinc consumed in a Grove battery in performing a common quantity of mechanical work. Grove was certainly familiar with William Thomson&#x27;s theoretical analysis of Joule&#x27;s experimental results and Thomson&#x27;s immature suggestions of conservation of energy. Thomson&#x27;s public champion, Peter Guthrie Tait was initially a supporter of Grove&#x27;s ideas but later dismissed them with some coolness.

Though Groves&#x27;s ideas were forerunners of the theory of the conservation of energy, they were qualitative, unlike the quantitative investigations of Joule or Julius Robert von Mayer. His ideas also shaded into broader speculation, such as the nature of Olbers&#x27;s paradox, which he may have discovered for himself rather than through a direct knowledge.

Grove also speculated that other forms of energy were yet to be discovered &quot;as far certain as certain can be of any future event.&quot;

==Royal Society politics==
As soon as he became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1840 Grove was a critic of the Society, deprecating its cronyism and the &quot;de facto&quot; rule of a few influential Council members. In 1843, he published an anonymous attack on the scientific establishment in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and called for reform. In 1846 Grove was elected to the Council of the Royal Society, and was heavily involved in the campaign to modernise its charter, in addition to campaigning for the public funding of science.

A charter committee had already been established, and Grove joined it. Groves&#x27;s fellow campaigners included Gassiot, Leonard Horner and Edward Sabine. Their principal objectives were for the number of new Fellows to be subject to an annual limit, and limitation of the power of nomination to the Council. The reformers&#x27; success in 1847 led to the resignation of several key conservatives and the establishment of Grove and his associates with domination of the Council. To celebrate, the reformers founded the Philosophical Club.

Though the Philosophical Club succeeded in ensuring that William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse was appointed next President, they failed to get Grove appointed as Secretary. Grove continued to campaign for a single home for all the scientific institutions at Burlington House.

==Legal career==
From 1846 Grove started to reduce his scientific work in favour of his professional practice at the bar, his young family providing the financial motivation; and in 1853 became a QC. The bar provided him with the opportunity to combine his legal and scientific knowledge, in particular in patent law and in the unsuccessful defence of poisoner William Palmer in 1856. He was especially involved in the photography patent cases of &quot;Beard v. Egerton&quot; (1845–1849), on behalf of Egerton, and of &quot;Talbot v. Laroche&quot; (1854). In the latter case Grove appeared for William Fox Talbot in his unsuccessful attempt to assert his calotype patent.

Grove served on a Royal Commission on patent law and on the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers.

In 1871 he was made judge of the Court of Common Pleas, and was appointed to the Queen&#x27;s Bench in 1880. He was to have presided at the Cornwall and Devon winter assizes of 1884, which would have entailed him trying the notorious survival cannibalism case of &quot;R v. Dudley and Stephens&quot;. However, at the last minute he was substituted by Baron Huddleston, possibly because Huddleston was seen as more reliable in ensuring the guilty verdict that the judiciary required. Grove did sit as one of five judges on the final determination of the case in a divisional court of the Queen&#x27;s Bench.

Grove was a careful, painstaking and accurate judge, courageous and not afraid to assert an independent judicial opinion. However, he was fallible in patent cases, where he was prone to become overinterested in the technology in question and to be distracted by questioning the litigants as to potential improvements in their devices, even going so far as to suggest his own innovations. He retired from the bench in 1887. His portrait was painted by Helen Donald-Smith in the 1890s.

==Family==
Grove married Emma Maria Powles, daughter of John Diston Powles, in 1837, and had several children, including Major-General Sir Coleridge Grove. Groves&#x27;s daughter, Imogen Emily (died 1886), married William Edward Hall in 1866. His daughter Anna married Herbert Augustus Hills (1837–1907) and was mother to Edmond Herbert Grove-Hills (&quot;Colonel Rivers&quot;) and John Waller Hills.

His health perpetually troubled, Grove died at home, 115 Harley Street in London, after a long illness. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

==Honours==

Grove became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1840, and received its Royal Medal in 1847. He was Vice-President of the Royal Institution in 1844. Receiving a knighthood in 1872, he was given an honorary degree by Cambridge University in 1879 and became Privy Councillor in 1887.

The lunar crater &quot;Grove&quot; is named in his honour. The Grove Fuel Cell Symposium and Exhibition is organised by Elsevier.

<doc id="1049941" wikidata="Q4921936" url="?curid=1049941" title="Black Sun (Abbey novel)">
<text>Black Sun is a 1971 novel by Edward Abbey about a fire lookout who falls in love with an American girl and is wrongly blamed when she mysteriously disappears in the Grand Canyon National Park.

==Background==
Although the location is not mentioned by name in the novel, it is set at the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, where Abbey worked at the time as a fire lookout in the fire tower just east of the main entrance at the North Rim. Stephen J. Pyne in his memoirs of his years as a firefighter at the North Rim, &quot;Fire on the Rim&quot;, wrote, concerning Abbey: &quot;fire busts came and went with hardly a word from the North Rim tower. Whether Abner was even in the tower, no one could say. He was a writer, and the only smokes he reported were the ones in his novels. He lived in a trailer behind the entrance cabin, but he was absent so often that he demonstrated that we did not need a lookout, because having Abner in the tower was the same as having no one. The position was abolished.&quot; Abbey was there for four seasons and wrote a nonfiction account in his book &quot;Abbey&#x27;s Road&quot;.

Abbey dedicated the book to his second wife Judy, who had died of acute leukemia just before publication of the novel. Because Judy had spent some time with Abbey when he worked as a fire ranger, some readers naturally believe the book is based on their relationship. However, according to James M. Cahalan&#x27;s &quot;Edward Abbey: A Life&quot;, the character of Sandy MacKenzie was actually based on a woman Abbey had an affair with in 1963. His first draft of this book was completed in 1968, two years before Judy&#x27;s death. Calhalan writes: &quot;it was a bone of contention in their marriage. He reported on March 17, 1968, that Judy hated it, &#x27;thinking it the story of one of my old love affairs, which in a way it is, but only in a greatly altered and much exaggerated way. If only she understood that there&#x27;s nothing deader than a dead romance.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;Black Sun&quot; may have been the original title considered to an earlier book Abbey had written about a group of young mohicans driving across the western United States on U.S. Route 66, but the book was never published and remains unpublished to this day. Terry Bisson wrote in American Rebels (2003) that the title Abbey was considering was &quot;Down the Road.&quot; The reason that manuscript was never published was because not long after Abbey finished his book, &quot;On the Road&quot; by Jack Kerouac appeared, and the two books bore so many resemblances that Abbey feared he would be accused of plagiarism if his novel were published.

The term &quot;black sun&quot; was used often in Abbey&#x27;s work. He used it first in his second book, &quot;Fire on the Mountain&quot; to describe a sketch Billy makes after they discover someone has shot Billy&#x27;s favorite horse, Rascal. He also uses it twice in his non-fiction book, &quot;The Journey Home&quot; and once in &quot;Abbey&#x27;s Road&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The book is divided into three parts: In the forest; In the sun; and In the evening.

The novel is about a rugged fire lookout, Will Gatlin, who falls in love with an American girl half his age and then becomes wrongly blamed when she mysteriously disappears in the nearby Grand Canyon National Park.

==Characters==
* Will Gatlin – A 37-year-old ranger who mans a fire watch tower in the forest.
* Sandy MacKenzie – A brash 19-year-old woman who is falling in love with the forest.
* Art Ballentine – A college professor and friend of Will&#x27;s.
* Elsie Ballentine – Art&#x27;s wife
* Gloria Hollenbeck – A friend of Sandy&#x27;s who Will thinks of as the &quot;rodeo queen.&quot;
* Wendell – Will&#x27;s boss, to whom he reports every morning from the fire watch tower
* Lawrence J. Turner the Third – Sandy&#x27;s fiance and a 23-year-old Air Force cadet
* Rosalie – A woman Will would see on a semi-regular basis for sex who lived 90 miles away with her three children

==Reception==
The book was not well received by critics and the public. The first-run paperback edition by Avon sold only 100,000 copies, where the first run of paperback editions for &quot;Desert Solitaire&quot; and &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; both sold more than a half million copies. According to James M. Cahalan&#x27;s biography of Abbey, &quot;Edward Abbey: A Life&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called &quot;Black Sun&quot; &quot;an embarrassingly bad novel.&quot; Abbey himself, however, considered it one of the best books he had ever written.

<text>Walter Lanier &quot;Red&quot; Barber (February 17, 1908 – October 22, 1992) was an American sports announcer and author. Nicknamed &quot;The Ol&#x27; Redhead&quot;, he was primarily identified with broadcasts of Major League Baseball, calling play-by-play across four decades with the Cincinnati Reds (1934–1938), Brooklyn Dodgers (1939–1953), and New York Yankees (1954–1966). Like his fellow sportscasting pioneer Mel Allen, Barber also developed a niche calling college and professional American football in his primary market of New York City.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Barber was born in Columbus, Mississippi. He was a distant relative of poet Sidney Lanier and writer Thomas Lanier Williams. The family moved to Sanford, Florida in 1918, and at the age of 21, he hitchhiked to Gainesville and enrolled at the University of Florida, majoring in education. During Barber&#x27;s first year, he worked at various jobs including part-time janitor at the University Club. It was there in January 1930 that Barber got his start in broadcasting.

An agriculture professor had been scheduled to appear on WRUF, the university radio station, to read a scholarly paper over the air. When the professor&#x27;s absence was discovered minutes before the broadcast was to begin, janitor Barber was called in as a substitute. It was thus that the future sportscaster&#x27;s first gig was reading &quot;Certain Aspects of Bovine Obstetrics&quot;. After those few minutes in front of a microphone, Barber decided to switch careers. He became WRUF&#x27;s director and chief announcer and covered Florida Gators football games that autumn. Then he dropped out of school to focus on his radio work. After four more years at WRUF he landed a job broadcasting the Cincinnati Reds on WLW and WSAI when Powel Crosley Jr. purchased the team in 1934.

On Opening Day 1934 (April 17), Barber attended his first major league game and broadcast its play-by-play, as the Reds lost to the Chicago Cubs 6–0. He called games from the stands of Cincinnati&#x27;s renamed Crosley Field for the next five seasons.

===Brooklyn Dodgers===
Barber had been hired by Larry MacPhail, then president of the Reds. MacPhail became president of the Dodgers in 1938, and in 1939, he brought the play-by-play man to the Dodgers. In Brooklyn, Barber became an institution, widely admired for his folksy style. He was also appreciated by people concerned about Brooklyn&#x27;s reputation as a land of &quot;dees&quot; and &quot;dems&quot;.

Barber became famous for his signature catchphrases, including these:
* &quot;They&#x27;re tearin&#x27; up the pea patch&quot; – used for a team on a winning streak.
* &quot;The bases are F.O.B. (full of Brooklyns)&quot; – indicating the Dodgers had loaded the bases.
* &quot;Can of corn&quot; – describing a softly hit, easily caught fly ball.
* &quot;Rhubarb&quot; – any kind of heated on-field dispute or altercation.
* &quot;Sittin&#x27; in the catbird seat&quot; – used when a player or team was performing exceptionally well. 
* &quot;Walkin&#x27; in the tall cotton&quot; – also used to describe success.
* &quot;Slicker than boiled okra&quot; – describing a ball that a fielder was unable to get a grip on.
* &quot;Easy as a bank of fog&quot; – describing the graceful movement of a fielder.
* &quot;Tighter than a new pair of shoes on a rainy day&quot; – describing a closely contested game.
* &quot;Tied up in a croker sack&quot; – describing a one-sided game where the outcome was all but decided.

To further his image as a Southern gentleman, Barber would often identify players as &quot;Mister&quot;, &quot;big fella&quot;, or &quot;old&quot; (regardless of the player&#x27;s age):
* &quot;Now, Mister Reiser steps to the plate, batting at .344.&quot;
* &quot;Big fella Hatten pitches, it&#x27;s in there for strike one.&quot;
* &quot;Old number 13, Ralph Branca, coming in to pitch.&quot;

A number of play-by-play announcers including Chris Berman have adopted his use of &quot;back, back, back&quot; to describe a long fly ball with potential to be a home run. Those other announcers are describing the flight of the ball but Barber was describing the outfielder in this famous call from Game 6 of the 1947 World Series. Joe DiMaggio was the batter:

*&quot;Here&#x27;s the pitch, swung on, belted ... it&#x27;s a long one ... back goes Gionfriddo, back, back, back, back, back, back ... heeee makes a one-handed catch against the bullpen! Oh, Doctor!&quot;

The phrase &quot;Oh, Doctor&quot; was also picked up by some later sportscasters, most notably Jerry Coleman, who was a New York Yankee infielder during the 1940s and 1950s and later worked alongside Barber in the Yankees&#x27; radio and TV booths.

In Game 4 of that same 1947 Series, Barber memorably described Cookie Lavagetto&#x27;s ninth-inning hit to break up Bill Bevens&#x27; no-hitter and win the game at once:

*&quot;Wait a minute ... Stanky is being called back from the plate and Lavagetto goes up to hit ... Gionfriddo walks off second ... Miksis off first ... They&#x27;re both ready to go on anything ... Two men out, last of the ninth ... the pitch ... swung on, there&#x27;s a drive hit out toward the right field corner. Henrich is going back. He can&#x27;t get it! It&#x27;s off the wall for a base hit! Here comes the tying run, and here comes the winning run! ... Friends, they&#x27;re killin&#x27; Lavagetto... his own teammates... they&#x27;re beatin&#x27; him to pieces and it&#x27;s taking a police escort to get Lavagetto away from the Dodgers! ... Well, I&#x27;ll be a suck-egg mule!&quot;

In 1939, Barber broadcast the first major-league game on television, on experimental NBC station W2XBS. In 1946, he added to his Brooklyn duties a job as sports director of the CBS Radio Network, succeeding Ted Husing and continuing through 1955. There, his greatest contribution was to conceive and host the &quot;CBS Football Roundup&quot;, which switched listeners back and forth between broadcasts of different regional college games each week.

Barber called Dodgers broadcasts over New York radio station WHN (later WMGM) at 1050 on the AM dial, teaming with Al Helfer from 1939 to 1941, followed by Alan Hale in 1942 and Connie Desmond beginning in 1943. When he developed a severe bleeding ulcer in 1948 and had to take a leave of absence from broadcasting for several weeks, Dodgers president Branch Rickey arranged for Ernie Harwell, the announcer for the minor-league Atlanta Crackers, to be sent to Brooklyn as Barber&#x27;s substitute; in exchange, Cliff Dapper, the catcher for the Dodgers&#x27; farm team in Montreal, was permitted to go to Atlanta to serve as the Crackers&#x27; new player-manager, thereby effecting the first player-for-announcer &quot;trade&quot; in major league history. Harwell would remain as a third man in the Dodgers&#x27; booth with Barber and Desmond through the 1949 season.
While running CBS Sports, Barber became the mentor of another redheaded announcer. He recruited the Fordham University graduate Vin Scully for CBS football coverage, and eventually invited him into the Dodgers&#x27; broadcast booth to succeed Harwell in 1950 after the latter&#x27;s departure for the crosstown New York Giants. That same year, the Dodgers began airing regular television broadcasts over WOR-TV, Channel 9 in New York, with the trio of Barber, Desmond, and Scully now alternating play-by-play for the team&#x27;s games on both radio and TV.

Barber was the first person outside the team&#x27;s board of directors to be told by Branch Rickey that the Dodgers had begun the process of racial desegregation in baseball, which led to signing Jackie Robinson as the first black player in the major leagues after the 1880s. As a Southerner, having lived with racial segregation as a fact of life written into law, Barber told Rickey that he was not sure he could broadcast the games. As was related in a biography of Branch Rickey by Jimmy Breslin, Barber left the meeting with Rickey and walked for hours trying to decide his future. Having been raised in the racially segregated South, and having attended the University of Florida, which, at the time of his attendance was limited to white male students, he had in his words, &quot;been carefully taught&quot;, and the thought of broadcasting games played by a Negro player was simply too much for him to agree to. He arrived home and informed his wife of his decision to quit that very night. She, also being from the Deep South, had become accustomed to a much better life in a toney neighborhood of Westchester County. She convinced him that there was no need to quit then, and a few martinis into the evening, he said he would try. After observing Robinson&#x27;s skill on the field and the way Robinson held up to the vicious abuse from opposing fans, Barber became an ardent supporter of him and the black players who followed, including Dodger stars Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe. (This story is told in Barber&#x27;s 1982 book, &quot;1947: When All Hell Broke Loose in Baseball&quot;.)

During this period, Barber also broadcast numerous World Series for Mutual radio and in 1948 and 1952 for NBC television, frequently teaming with Yankees announcer Mel Allen. He also called New York Giants football from 1942 to 1946, as well as several professional and college football games on network radio and TV, including the NFL Championship Game, Army–Navy Game and Orange Bowl.

===New York Yankees===
Prior to the 1953 World Series, Barber was selected by Gillette, which sponsored the Series broadcasts, to call the games on NBC along with Mel Allen. Barber wanted a larger fee than was offered by Gillette, however, and when Dodgers owner Walter O&#x27;Malley refused to back him, Barber declined to work the Series and Vin Scully partnered with Allen on the telecasts instead. As Barber later related in his 1968 autobiography, &quot;Rhubarb in the Catbird Seat&quot;, he was rankled by O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s lack of support, and this – along with a dispute over the renewal of Barber&#x27;s $50,000 a year contract – led to his departure from the Dodgers&#x27; booth later that October.

Soon afterward the crosstown Yankees hired Barber. Just before the start of the 1954 season, surgery resulted in permanent deafness in one ear. In 1955, he took his long-running television program &quot;Red Barber&#x27;s Corner&quot; from CBS to NBC. It ran from 1949 until 1958.

With the Yankees, Barber strove to adopt a strictly neutral, dispassionately reportorial broadcast style, avoiding not only partisanship but also any emotional surges that would match the excitement of the fans. He&#x27;d already had a reputation as a &quot;fair&quot; announcer while with the Dodgers, as opposed to a &quot;homer&quot; who openly rooted for his team from the booth. Some fans and critics found this later, more restrained Barber to be dull, especially in contrast with Mel Allen&#x27;s dramatic, emotive style.

Barber described the ways they covered long fly balls as one of the central differences between Allen and himself. Allen would watch the ball. Thus his signature call, &quot;That ball is going, going, it is GONE!&quot;, sometimes turned into, &quot;It is going ... to be caught!&quot; or &quot;It is going ... foul!&quot; Barber would watch the outfielder, his movements and his eyes, and would thus be a better judge whether the ball would be caught. This is evident in his famous call of Gionfriddo&#x27;s catch (quoted above). Many announcers say &quot;back, back, back&quot; describing the ball&#x27;s flight. On the Gionfriddo call Barber is describing the action of the outfielder, not the ball.

Curt Smith, in his book &quot;Voices of Summer&quot;, summarized the difference between Barber and Allen: &quot;Barber was white wine, crepes suzette, and bluegrass music. Allen was hot dogs, beer, and the U.S. Marine Corps Band. Like Millay, Barber was a poet. Like Sinatra, Allen was a balladeer. Detached, Red reported. Involved, Mel roared.&quot;

Under the ownership of CBS in 1966, the Yankees finished tenth and last, their first time at the bottom of the standings since 1912 and after more than 40 years of dominating the American League. On September 22, a paid attendance of 413 was announced at the 65,000-seat Yankee Stadium. Barber asked the TV cameras to pan the empty stands as he commented on the low attendance. WPIX refused to do so, on orders from the Yankees&#x27; head of media relations. Undeterred, Barber said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what the paid attendance is today, but whatever it is, it is the smallest crowd in the history of Yankee Stadium, and this crowd is the story, not the game.&quot; In a case of exceptionally bad timing, that game was the first for CBS executive Mike Burke as team president. A week later, Barber was invited to breakfast with Burke, who told him that his contract would not be renewed at the end of the season.

===Later life===

After his dismissal by the Yankees in 1966, Barber retired from regular baseball broadcasting. He authored a number of books, including his autobiography, &quot;Rhubarb in the Catbird Seat&quot;; contributed to occasional sports documentary programs on radio and television, including Ken Burns&#x27; documentary &quot;Baseball&quot;; and from 1981 until his death made weekly contributions to National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Morning Edition&quot; program. Each Friday Barber, speaking from his home in Tallahassee, Florida, would talk with host Bob Edwards, usually about sports but frequently about other topics, including the flora around his home. Barber would address Edwards as &quot;Colonel Bob&quot;, referring to the Kentucky Colonel honorific given to Edwards by his native state.

Red Barber died on October 22, 1992 at Tallahassee Memorial Regional Medical Center in Tallahassee, Florida. Edwards&#x27; book &quot;Fridays with Red: A Radio Friendship&quot; based on his &quot;Morning Edition&quot; segments with Barber, was published in 1993.

==Honors==

The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association inducted Barber into its Hall of Fame in 1973. In 1978, Barber joined former colleague Mel Allen to become the first broadcasters to receive the Ford C. Frick Award from the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. In 1979, he was recognized with a Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Florida, given a Gold Award by the Florida Association of Broadcasters, and inducted into the Florida Sports Hall of Fame. In 1984, Barber was part of the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame&#x27;s inaugural class which included sportscasting legends Don Dunphy, Ted Husing, Bill Stern and Graham McNamee. Barber was given a George Polk Award in 1985 and a Peabody Award in 1990 for his NPR broadcasts, and in 1995 he was posthumously inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.

In 1993, &quot;TV Guide&quot; named Barber the best sportscaster of the 1950s.

In 1994, two years after his death, Barber was seen several times throughout the Ken Burns series &quot;Baseball&quot; as he recounted memorable episodes of baseball history, especially of the Brooklyn Dodgers.

The Red Barber Radio Scholarship is awarded each year by the University of Florida&#x27;s College of Journalism and Communications to a student studying sports broadcasting.

A WRUF used by Barber during the 1930s is part of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum&#x27;s collection. It has been displayed in the museum&#x27;s &quot;Scribes and Mikemen&quot; exhibit, and from 2002 to 2006 it was featured as part of the &quot;Baseball as America&quot; traveling exhibition.

==In popular culture==
Barber is mentioned in &quot;The Catbird Seat&quot;, a 1942 short story by James Thurber. A female character in the story likes to use the titular expression as well as such phrases as &quot;tearing up the pea patch&quot; and &quot;hollering down the rain barrel&quot;, prompting another character to suggest that she picked them up from listening to Barber&#x27;s Dodger radio broadcasts. (Ironically enough, according to Barber&#x27;s daughter, her father did not begin using the &quot;catbird seat&quot; phrase until after he had read the story.)

In 1957, Barber appeared as himself in &quot;Hillbilly Whiz&quot;, a third-season episode of &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;.

In the 2013 film &quot;42&quot;, which dramatizes Jackie Robinson breaking the major leagues&#x27; color barrier with the Dodgers, Barber is played by John C. McGinley.

In the 2015 television series &quot;Manhattan&quot; (Series 1, Episode 11), a character asks another if they have &quot;been watching Red Barber&quot; after the latter&#x27;s foreign accent has improved to sound more American, suggesting that is where she learned to improve it.

<text>Charu Mazumdar (; 15 May 1918 – 28 July 1972), popularly known as CM, was an Indian Communist leader, and founder and General Secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). Born into a progressive landlord family in Siliguri in 1918, he became a Communist during the Indian Independence Movement, and later formed the militant Naxalite cause. During this period, he authored the historic accounts of the 1967 Naxalbari uprising. His writings, particularly the Historic Eight Documents, have become part of the ideology of a number of Communism-aligned political parties in India.

== Biography ==
Mazumdar was born in Matualaloi, Rajshahi (now Siliguri) to a zamindar family. His father Bireshwar Majumdar was a freedom fighter and president of the Darjeeling District Committee of the Indian National Congress during the Indian independence movement.

In 1930, as a student in Siliguri, he joined the All Bengal Students&#x27; Association, which was affiliated to the underground anti-colonial organisation Anushilan Samiti, at the instance of Sewmangal Singh and Brojen Basu Roy Choudhuri.

Having graduated from his ‘Matric’ exam in 1937 with a First Division, Mazumdar took admission to Edward College in Pabna district (present day Bangladesh). However he returned to Siliguri after sometime, having quit his formal education, in order to join the independence movement. In 1938, at the age of 19, he joined the Congress Socialist Party.

The next year when the Communist Party of India (CPI) was organised in the neighbouring Jalpaiguri district, Mazumdar joined the then-banned party to work in its peasant front. Soon an arrest warrant forced him to go underground for the first time as a communist activist. Although the CPI was banned at the outbreak of World War II, he continued CPI activities among peasants and was made a member of the CPI Jalpaiguri district committee in 1942. The promotion emboldened him to organize a &#x27;seizure of crops&#x27; campaign in Jalpaiguri during the Great Famine of 1943. In 1946, he joined the Tebhaga movement in the Jalpaiguri region and embarked on a proletariat militant struggle in North Bengal. The stir shaped his vision of a revolutionary struggle. Later he worked among tea garden workers in Darjeeling.

The CPI was banned in 1948 and he spent the next three years in jail. In January 1952 he married Lila Mazumdar Sengupta, a fellow CPI member from Jalpaiguri. The couple moved to Siliguri, which was the center of Mazumdar&#x27;s activities for a few years. He was briefly imprisoned in 1962.

During the mid-1960s Mazumdar organized a leftist faction in Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) in northern Bengal. In 1967, a militant peasant uprising took place in Naxalbari, led by his comrade-in-arms Kanu Sanyal. This group would later be known as the Naxalites, and eight articles written by him at this time—known as the Historic Eight Documents—have been seen as providing their ideological foundation: arguing that revolution must take the path of armed struggle on the pattern of the Chinese Communist Revolution. When the Naxalbari uprising was crushed in 1967, Mazumdar said: &quot;...hundreds of Naxalbaris are smoldering in India...Naxalbari has not died and will not die&quot;. The same year, Mazumdar broke away and formed the All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries which in 1969 founded the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist)—with Mazumdar as its General Secretary.

==Death==
He was captured in a state of bad health at his hideout on 16 July 1972 at 3 AM by Calcutta Police officer Ranjit Guha Niyogi (alias Runu Guha Niyogi) and his team. The official police response was that Mazumdar died of a massive heart attack at 4 AM on 28 July 1972. All the Naxalite factions disputed this however, and instead said that it was a custodial murder and that he was killed by not being provided medicine in the police lock up. His body was cremated at the Keoratola crematorium under the watch of armed police and paramilitary forces.

The radical leftist movement in India has seen many ideological splits since Mazumdar&#x27;s death. The Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation observes Martyrs&#x27; Day on the anniversary of Mazumdar&#x27;s death. The Communist Party of India (Maoist) observes Martyrs&#x27; Week in the last week of July in remembrance of Mazumdar&#x27;s death, where members revisit his ideology and memorialise his influence on their movement.

<text>György Kozmann (born March 23, 1978, in Szekszárd) is a Hungarian sprint canoeist who has competed since the late 1990s. Competing in the 2004 and 2008 Summer Olympics, he won two bronze medals in the C-2 1000 m event.

He has also won eleven medals at the ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships with five golds (C-2 500 m: 2007, C-2 1000 m: 2006, C-4 200 m: 2001, 2003, C-4 1000 m: 2001), two silvers (C-2 500 m: 2005, C-4 500 m: 2001), and four bronzes (C-2 500 m: 2006, C-2 1000 m: 2003, 2005; C-4 1000 m: 1999). From 2003 until 2008, he was the C-2 partner of György Kolonics.

In the European championships Kozmann has been a gold medalist four times - C-4 500 m (2002), C-4 1000 m (2000 and 2002) and C-2 500 m (2004).

Kolonics death came weeks prior to the 2008 Olympics, to what the pair qualified for both the C-2 500 m and the C-2 1000 m events. Kozmann refused to take part in the games, consulted with his coach, friends and Kolonics&#x27;s friends, then changed his mind. He competed in the C-2 1000 m event with Tamás Kiss, and the pair finished on the third place in the C-2 1000 m final. He later received a Fair Play prize for this from the Hungarian Olympic Committee.

Kozmann is a member of the Atomerőmű SE club and is coached by Attila Szabó. He is 179 cm (5&#x27;10&quot;) tall and weighs 83 kg (182 lbs).

<text>Alice Ida Antoinette Guy-Blaché ( Guy; ; 1 July 1873 – 24 March 1968) was a French pioneer film director. She was one of the first filmmakers to make a narrative fiction film, as well as the first woman to direct a film. From 1896 to 1906, she was probably the only female filmmaker in the world. She experimented with Gaumont&#x27;s Chronophone sync-sound system, and with color-tinting, interracial casting, and special effects.

She was artistic director and a co-founder of Solax Studios in Flushing, New York. In 1912, Solax invested $100,000 for a new studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey, the center of American filmmaking prior to the establishment of Hollywood. That year, she made the film &quot;A Fool and His Money&quot;, probably the first to have an all-African-American cast. The film is now preserved at the National Center for Film and Video Preservation at the American Film Institute for its historical and aesthetic significance.

==Early life and education==
In 1865, Guy&#x27;s father, Émile Guy, an owner of a bookstore and publishing company in Santiago, Chile and Valparaíso, Chile, married Marie Clotilde Franceline Aubert. The couple returned to Santiago after the wedding in Paris. In early 1873, Marie and Émile lived in Santiago, with Alice&#x27;s four siblings.

There was a devastating smallpox epidemic in Chile in 1872 and 1873. Émile and Marie Guy brought all four of their children to Paris, where Alice was born. In her autobiography, Alice refers to this as her mother&#x27;s attempt to make sure &quot;her fifth child should be truly French&quot;. Her father returned to Chile soon after her birth, and her mother followed a few months later. Alice was left in the care of her grandmother in Carouge, Switzerland. At the age of three or four, her mother took Alice back to South America.

At the age of six, Guy was taken back to France by her father to attend the &quot;Faithful Companions of Jesus&quot; school in Veyrier. Guy and her sister Louise were moved to a convent in Ferney a few years later and then brought back to Paris.

Guy&#x27;s father died on 5 January 1891 of unknown causes. Following his death, Guy&#x27;s mother got a job with Mutualité maternelle which was founded on 20 May 1891. Her mother was unable to keep that job and thereafter Guy trained as a typist and stenographer, a new field at the time, to support herself and her mother. She landed her first stenography-typist job at a varnish factory. In March 1894, she began working at the &#x27;Comptoir général de la photographie&#x27; owned by Félix-Max Richard. Léon Gaumont later took over and headed the company.

== Career ==

=== Secretary to Léon Gaumont ===
In 1894, Alice Guy was hired by Félix-Max Richard to work as a secretary for a camera manufacturing and photography supply company. The company changed hands in 1895 due to a court decision against Félix-Max Richard, who sold the company to four men: Gustave Eiffel, Joseph Vallot, Alfred Besnier, and Léon Gaumont. Gustave Eiffel was president of the company, and Léon Gaumont, thirty years Eiffel&#x27;s junior, was the manager. The company was named after Gaumont because Eiffel was the subject of a national scandal regarding the Panama Canal. L. Gaumont et C became a major force in the fledgling motion-picture industry in France. Alice continued to work at Gaumont et C, a decision that led to a pioneering career in filmmaking that spanned more than 25 years and involved her directing, producing, writing and/or overseeing more than 700 films.

Although she initially began working for Léon Gaumont as his secretary, Guy became familiar with his clients, relevant marketing strategies, and the company&#x27;s stock of cameras. She also met a handful of pioneering film engineers such as Georges Demenÿ and Auguste and Louis Lumière.

Alice Guy and Gaumont attended the &quot;surprise&quot; Lumière event on March 22, 1895. It was the first demonstration of film projection, an obstacle that Gaumont, the Lumières, and Edison were all racing to solve. They screened one of their early films &quot;Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory&quot;, which consisted of a simple scene of workmen leaving the Lumière plant in Lyon. Bored with the idea of captured film only being used for the scientific and/or promotional purpose of selling cameras in the form of &quot;demonstration films,&quot; Guy was confident that she could incorporate fictional story-telling elements into film. She asked Gaumont for permission to make her own film, and he granted it.

=== Early filmmaking at Gaumont Film Company ===

Alice Guy made her first film in 1896. Its original title may have been &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; (The Fairy of the Cabbages) or &quot;The Birth of Children&quot;, or it may have had no title at first. The scene Alice described as her debut effort does not match either the 1900 version of &quot;La Fée aux choux&quot; or the 1902 version, retitled &quot;Sage-femme de première classe&quot; which has been found in film archives. By comparing Alice&#x27;s descriptions of her debut effort with the two films that are available for us to view, we discover differences that indicate there was a third film that came first. The 1896 film seems to be lost. However, multiple points of confirmation indicate that there were three different &quot;La Fée aux choux&quot;. A 30 July 1896 newspaper describes a &quot;chaste fiction of children born under the cabbages in a wonderfully framed chromo landscape,&quot; and provides other details that confirm Alice Guy&#x27;s description of her first film. &quot;Before very long,&quot; Alice Guy reported in 1912, &quot;every moving picture house in the country was turning out stories instead of spectacles and plots instead of panoramas.&quot;
From 1896 to 1906, Alice Guy was Gaumont&#x27;s head of production and is generally considered the first filmmaker to systematically develop narrative filmmaking. She was probably the only female director from 1896 to 1906. Her earlier films share many characteristics and themes with her contemporary competitors, such as the Lumières and Méliès. She explored dance and travel films, often combining the two, such as &quot;Le Boléro&quot; performed by Saharet (1905) and &quot;Tango&quot; (1905). Many of Guy&#x27;s early dance films were popular in music-hall attractions such as the serpentine dance films – also a staple of the Lumières and Thomas Edison film catalogs.

In 1906, Guy made &quot;The Life of Christ&quot;, a big-budget production for the time, which included 300 extras. She used the illustrated James Tissot New Testament as reference material for the film, which featured 25 episodes and was her largest production at Gaumont to date. In addition to this, she was one of the pioneers in the use of audio recordings in conjunction with the images on screen in Gaumont&#x27;s &quot;Chronophone&quot; system, which used a vertical-cut disc synchronized to the film. She employed some of the first special effects, including using double exposure, masking techniques, and running a film backward. During her tenure at Gaumont, Guy hired and trained Louis Feuillade and Étienne Arnaud as writers and directors and hired set designer Henri Ménessier and art director Ben Carré.

===Later works at The Solax Company===

In 1907, Alice Guy married Herbert Blaché, who was soon appointed the production manager for Gaumont&#x27;s operations in the United States. After working with her husband for Gaumont in the U.S., the two established their own business in 1910, partnering with George A. Magie in the formation of The Solax Company, the largest pre-Hollywood studio in America.

With production facilities for their new company in Flushing, New York, her husband served as production manager and cinematographer. Alice Guy-Blaché worked as the artistic director and directed many of its releases. Within two years, they had become so successful that they invested more than $100,000 into new and technologically advanced production facilities in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Many early film studios were based in Fort Lee at the beginning of the 20th century. This made her the first woman to own her own studio and studio plant. It was mentioned in publications of the era that Guy-Blaché placed a large sign in her studio that read: &#x27;Be Natural&#x27;.

In 1913, Guy-Blaché directed &quot;The Thief&quot;, the first script sold by future Wonder Woman creator William Moulton Marston.

Guy-Blaché and her husband divorced several years later, and with the rise of the more hospitable and cost-effective climate in Hollywood, their film partnership also ended.

== Legacy ==

In the late 1940s, Alice Guy-Blaché wrote an autobiography. It was published, in French, in 1976 and was translated into English a decade later with the help of her daughter Simone, daughter-in-law Roberta Blaché, and the film writer Anthony Slide. Guy-Blaché was concerned with her unexplained absence from the historical record of the film industry. She regularly communicated with colleagues and film historians, correcting previously made and supposedly factual statements about her life. She crafted lengthy lists of her films as she remembered them, with the hope of being able to assume creative ownership and receive legitimate credit for them.

Guy-Blaché was the subject of a National Film Board of Canada documentary &quot;The Lost Garden: The Life and Cinema of Alice Guy-Blaché&quot; by director Marquise Lepage, which received Quebec&#x27;s Gémeaux Award for Best Documentary. In 2002, film scholar Alison McMahan published &quot;Alice Guy Blaché: Lost Visionary of the Cinema&quot;. Guy-Blaché is considered by some to have been the first female filmmaker, and from 1896 to 1920, she directed over 1,000 films, some 150 of which survive, and 22 of which are feature-length. She was one of the first women, along with Lois Weber, to manage and own her own studio: The Solax Company. Few of her films survive in an easily viewable format. In December 2018, Kino Lorber released a six-disc box, &quot;Pioneers: First Women Filmmakers&quot;, in cooperation with the Library of Congress, the British Film Institute, and others. The first disc of the set is devoted to the films of Alice Guy-Blaché. It includes &quot;Matrimony&#x27;s Speed Limit&quot; (1913), which was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2003. The 2018 documentary film &quot;Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché&quot;, directed by Pamela B. Green and narrated by Jodie Foster, which opened at the Cannes Film Festival (Cannes Classics), deals with Guy-Blaché&#x27;s life, career, and legacy.

Because of &quot;Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché&quot;, many of Guy-Blaché&#x27;s films were restored and preserved, and a pillar in her name will be featured at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures.

In September 2019, Guy-Blaché was included in &quot;The New York Times&quot; series &quot;Overlooked No More&quot;.

As reported by Deadline in 2021, Pamela B. Green is developing a feature biopic about Alice Guy-Blaché.

Guy-Blaché was an early influence on both Alfred Hitchcock and Sergei Eisenstein. Hitchcock remarked, &quot;I&#x27;d be over the moon with the Frenchman George Méliès. I was thrilled by the movies of D.W. Griffith and the early French director Alice Guy.&quot;

In his Memoirs, Eisenstein described an unnamed film he had seen as a child that continued to be very important to him. This film was identified as Alice Guy-Blaché&#x27;s &quot;The Consequences of Feminism&quot; (1906) during the making of the documentary &quot;Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché.&quot;

==Personal life==

Alice Guy-Blaché&#x27;s marriage meant that she had to resign from her position working with Gaumont. The couple was sent by the Gaumont company to Cleveland to facilitate the franchise of Gaumont equipment. Early in 1908, the couple went to New York City where Guy-Blaché gave birth to her daughter, Simone, in September 1908. Two years later, Guy-Blaché became the first woman to run her own studio when she created Solax in Gaumont&#x27;s Flushing studio. In 1912, when she was pregnant with her second child, she built a studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey, and continued to complete one to three films a week. On 27 June 1912, Reginald, her son, was born. To focus on writing and directing, Guy-Blaché took her husband into Solax in 1913 &quot;for feature production and executive direction&quot;.

Shortly after taking the position, Herbert Blaché started a film company named Blaché Features, Inc. The couple maintained a personal and business partnership for the next few years, working together on many projects. In 1918, Herbert Blaché left his wife and children to pursue a career in Hollywood. Alice Guy-Blaché almost died from the Spanish flu pandemic in October 1918 while filming her final film &quot;Tarnished Reputations&quot;. Following her illness, she joined Herbert in Hollywood in 1919 but they lived separately. She worked as Herbert&#x27;s directing assistant on his two films starring Alla Nazimova.

Alice Guy-Blaché directed her last film in 1919. In 1921, she was forced to auction her film studio and other possessions in bankruptcy. Alice and Herbert were officially divorced in 1922. She returned to France in 1922 and never made another film.

==Death==
Alice Guy-Blaché never remarried, and in 1964 she returned to the United States to live in Wayne, New Jersey, with her older child, her daughter, Simone. On 24 March 1968, at 94, Alice Guy-Blaché died in a nursing home in New Jersey. She is interred at Maryrest Cemetery.

==Accolades and tributes==
On December 12, 1958, Guy-Blaché was awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur, the highest non-military award France offers. On 16 March 1957, she was honored in a Cinémathèque française ceremony that went almost unnoticed by the press.

In 2002, Circle X Theatre in Los Angeles produced &quot;Laura Comstock&#x27;s Bag-punching Dog&quot;, a musical about the invention of cinema, and Alice Guy-Blaché was the lead character. The musical was written by Jillian Armenante, Alice Dodd, and Chris Jeffries. In 2011, an off-Broadway production of &quot;Flight&quot; premiered at the Connelly Theatre, featuring a fictionalized portrayal of Guy-Blaché as a 1913 documentary filmmaker.

In 2004, the Fort Lee Film Commission unveiled a historical marker dedicated to Alice Guy-Blaché at the location of Solax Studio. In 2012, for the centennial of the founding and building of the studio, the Commission raised funds to replace her grave marker in Maryrest Cemetery in Mahwah, New Jersey. The new marker includes the Solax logo and notes Guy-Blaché&#x27;s role as a cinema pioneer.

In 2010, the Academy Film Archive preserved Alice Guy-Blaché&#x27;s short film &quot;The Girl in the Arm-Chair.&quot; In 2011, the Fort Lee Film Commission successfully lobbied the Directors Guild of America to accept Alice Guy-Blaché as a member. She was subsequently awarded a posthumous &quot;Special Directorial Award for Lifetime Achievement&quot; at the 2011 DGA Honors. In 2013, Guy-Blaché was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

In 2018, film journalist Véronique Le Bris founded the Alice Guy Prize, granted yearly to highlight the woman film-maker of the year.

A square in the 14th arrondissement of Paris is named the in her honor.

In 2019, the re-edited and expanded version of Eisenstein&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;Yo. Memoirs by Sergei Eisenstein&quot; mention Alice&#x27;s &quot;The Consequences of Feminism&quot; and its influence on Eisenstein&quot;.&quot;

In 2021, Yale University opened its new state-of-the-art screening room, named the Alice Cinema, after Alice Guy-Blaché.

In 2021, French-German TV channel Arte produced a documentary on Alice Guy-Blaché titled &quot;Alice Guy, the unknown lady of the 7th art&quot;, directed by Valérie Urréa and Nathalie Masduraud, voiced by Agnès Jaoui and Maud Wyler.

In 2022, Rowman &amp; Littlefield published a new edition of &quot;The Memoirs of Alice Guy Blaché&quot;, edited by Anthony Slide and translated by Simone Blaché and Roberta Blaché. This memoir contains a new introduction by Slide.

The Golden Door Film Festival gives an award named in her honor.

On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of her birth, around July 1, 2023, several French institutions celebrated Alice Guy and her legacy:
* The Cinémathèque Française held a special day of hommage with the showing of 8 of her films. It also uploaded a 2K resolution digitization of the very first known making-of in the history of cinéma, &quot;Alice Guy tourne une phonoscène&quot; (Alice Guy shoots a phonoscene - [the ancestor of the music video], 1907, by anonym) on its online film portal, Henri.
* French postal service La Poste launched a special edition stamp at her effigy which was presented by her great-grandson Thierry Peeters at philately center &quot;Carré d&#x27;Encre&quot; on July 3, 2023.
* Newly re-opened Paris museum of history of immigration Cité nationale de l&#x27;histoire de l&#x27;immigration shares within its new permanent exhibition several of Alice Guy&#x27;s films, amongst which &quot;L&#x27;Américanisé&quot; (1912), to illustrate the experience of immigrants to the United States (like Alice Guy herself).

<text>Smith Street is a street in inner northern Melbourne, running north from the city proper and separating Fitzroy from Collingwood.

==Geography==
Smith Street runs north–south from Victoria Parade at its southernmost end to Queens Parade. Between Victoria Parade and Alexandra Parade, it forms the boundary between Fitzroy and Collingwood; the short segment north of Alexandra Parade is in Clifton Hill. Smith Street is located a block east of Brunswick Street. From Gertrude Street to Queens Parade, Smith Street forms part of tram route 86.

==History==
The road now known as Smith Street was originally a winding dirt track running from Bourke Street, Melbourne, to Heidelberg, and was known as the Eastern Road or Heidelberg Road. The road was placed on its current straight course as part of Melbourne&#x27;s first suburban land subdivision of 1838. On 23 May 1851, the road was renamed Smith Street, after John Thomas Smith, a seven-time mayor of Melbourne. By the 1860s, Smith Street was a busy and popular suburban shopping strip.

Smith Street contains restaurants and cafés and also has numerous shops selling cheap household goods. North of Johnston Street there are factory outlets selling athletic and fashion clothing. This include brands such as Nike and Adidas. Parts of Smith Street also serve as a meeting place for the local Indigenous Australian community. Smith Street is somewhat more downmarket than nearby Brunswick Street and has not become as fashionable though it is slowly gentrifying.

During the late 1990s, Smith Street was frequented by heroin users and dealers. This earned it the sobriquet &#x27;Smack Street&#x27;, which, whilst arguably no longer apt, has stuck.

In the last few years a number of bars and clubs have emerged on Smith Street, including “a bar called Barry”, “Scarlet” and until its closure in 2004; the all night venue Republika.

The street has been honoured of late by the rise of the local band The Smith Street Band, which has received international acclaim. This is despite the lead singer recently claiming that &quot;none of us live [on Smith Street] and now everyone time I go there I get quite frustrated that it seems to be becoming more and more gentrified.&quot;

==Landmarks==
Left-wing community radio station 3CR has its offices in Smith Street, south of Gertrude Street. Music-oriented community radio station 3PBS is also located nearby, in Easey Street, Collingwood.

It was also home to the first ever Coles Variety Store, and a large, new Coles supermarket opened in 2015 partly behind a reconstructed 1930s Coles facade.

<text>Zittau ( ; ; ; ; Upper Lusatian dialect: &quot;Sitte&quot;; ) is the southeasternmost city in the German state of Saxony, and belongs to the district of Görlitz, Germany&#x27;s easternmost district.

Zittau is located in Upper Lusatia, the southern part of Lusatia, on the Mandau and Lusatian Neisse rivers, in the foreland of the Zittau Mountains. The city has a population of around 25,000 and is located directly on the western edge of the Turów Coal Mine, one of the largest artificial holes visible from space, on the other side of the Lusatian Neisse.

The inner city of Zittau still shows its original beauty with many houses from several architectural periods: the famous town hall built in an Italian style, the church of St John and the stables () with its medieval heritage. This multi-storied building is one of the oldest of its kind in Germany. Zittau is the birthplace of the German composer Heinrich Marschner.

Zittau station is an important railway junction, where four railway lines meet: the Zittau–Hagenwerder line to Görlitz, the Liberec–Zittau line to Liberec, the Zittau–Löbau line to Dresden via Oderwitz and to Löbau via Herrnhut, and the Zittau–Kurort Oybin narrow gauge railway line to Oybin and Jonsdorf in the Zittau Mountains.

The &quot;Großes Zittauer Fastentuch&quot; (Great Zittau Lenten Cloth) is, along with the Bayeux Tapestry, one of the most impressive textile works in Western tradition. It is the third-largest existing Lenten veil. It was made in Zittau in 1472 and is now exhibited in the secularized &quot;Kirche zum Heiligen Kreuz&quot;, that belongs to the Zittau Municipal Museums, where it is kept in the largest museum display case in the world.

==Geography==
Zittau sits on the Mandau River, while the Lusatian Neisse, which forms the border with Poland, touches the city in the east. The confluence of both rivers is located in the southeast of the city. Further south is a tripoint of Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic, and the incorporated village of Hartau lies where the Lusatian Neisse forms the German/Czech border for a short distance. Zittau lies in the Zittau Basin, just north of the Zittau Mountains (part of the Sudetes).

==Climate==
The climate is cool temperate with cool winters and warm summers with an average annual temperature of 8.6 °C. The annual precipitation total is 883 mm. All twelve months are humid. The climate classification according to Köppen and Geiger is Cfb.

==History==

The history of the city dates back to a 12th-century Slavic settlement. The area belonged to the Czech (Bohemian) Duchy (and later Kingdom) from the 11th century. It was first mentioned under the Latinized name &quot;Sitavia&quot; in 1238. It was granted town rights in 1255 by King Ottokar II of Bohemia, who also built defensive walls. In 1319 it passed to the Piast-ruled Duchy of Jawor of then-fragmented Poland, and after the death of Duke Henry I of Jawor in 1346, it became part of the Czech (Bohemian) Crown again. The city&#x27;s coat of arms still shows a Czech Lion and a Silesian Piast Eagle. In 1346 the city became one of the members of the Six-City League of Upper Lusatia. At that time the city was granted a special title—it was called &quot;Die Reiche&quot; (&quot;the Rich&quot;) because of its high proportion of well-to-do citizens. In 1359 and 1422 it suffered great fires. In 1469, together with the Lusatian League, the city recognized Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus as rightful ruler, thus passing to Hungary, and after his death in 1490 the city returned to the Bohemian Crown, then under the rule of Polish prince Vladislaus II. It remained part of it until 1635 when it passed to the Electorate of Saxony.

During the Counter-Reformation, especially following the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, a large number of Protestant refugees from Bohemia came to Zittau, where the Protestant Saxon rulers took them in. Many of them went on to find refuge in surrounding villages, in Dresden, and in Berlin in Brandenburg. Primarily as a result of the near-complete destruction of the city during the Seven Years&#x27; War, Zittau&#x27;s then prosperity is reflected today in only a few exceptional buildings and the cemeteries where the well-to-do were buried.

One of the most important trading goods of this early age in the 16th century was beer. Later in the 18th and 19th century textiles became important too, a tradition common in the region of Upper Lusatia.

In 1813, two Polish military units were established in the city, that is the 1st Horse Artillery Company of the Jan Henryk Dąbrowski Division and 2nd Horse Artillery Company of the VIII Corps of Prince Józef Poniatowski.
During World War II, a Nazi prison and a labour camp was located in the city. The camp provided forced labour for Phänomen Werke Gustav Hiller, a truck-manufacturing company (which became VEB Kraftfahrzeugwerk Phänomen after the war, renamed VEB Robur-Werke Zittau in 1957).

==Politics==
===Lord Mayors===
*2001-2015: Arnd Voigt (&quot;Free citizens Zittau&quot;))
*since August 2015: Thomas Zenker (&quot;Zittau can do more&quot;).

===Local council===
The local council has 26 members, the results of the elections in August 2014 are:

===Reichstag Deputies===

Following the North German Confederation Treaty the Kingdom of Saxony entered the North German Confederation in 1866. This continued after the founding of the German Empire on 18 January 1871. Following this Saxony participated in Reichstag elections from February 1867. Zittau returned a series of Reichstag Deputies until 1919 when the existing constituencies were scrapped.

==Main sights==

* Church of our Lady: A semi-gothic church that is first mentioned in 1355.
* City Hall: Designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and built in Italian palazzo style between 1840 and 1845.
* Flower Clock: A notable Zittau attraction, the flower clock was built in 1907 from a clockwork of an old Tower clock and contains approximately 4800 plants planted three times annually.
* Friary Church: It was the church of the Franciscan Monastery. Their high altar was sacred to the apostles Peter and Paulus in 1293. The main aisle dates from 1480 and was built in the style of late gothic. In the years 1696, 1731 and 1748 prayer rooms were built on the south side of the church. These were special seating areas for wealthy citizens.
* Markt: The main central square
* St John&#x27;s Church: Originally built in 1230 in the Romanesque style of the Order of Saint John, whose patron saint was John the Baptist. It was later dedicated also to John the Evangelist. The building was destroyed in 1757 by Austrian soldiers during the Seven Years&#x27; War. The current building was built between 1766 and 1837.
* Zittau Lenten Altar Cloths, two large decorated cloths which were used to hide the altar during Lent. The big lenten altar cloth (56 m2) from 1472 is shown in the Gothic Holy Cross Church, the little lenten altar cloth (15 m2) from 1573, one of six lenten altar cloths of the Arma Christi type in the world, in the Museum of Cultural History in the former Franciscan Monastery. .
* Several historic fountains: Green Fountain (1679), Roland or Mars Fountain (1585), Fountain of the Samaritan Woman (1679), Hercules Fountain (1708), Swan Fountain (1710), Little Grinder&#x27;s Fountain (early 19th century).

* Old Grammar School and Dornspach&#x27;s House, Renaissance buildings.
* Building Crafts College (Baugewerkeschule), a Gothic Revival building from 1846/48 by Carl August Schramm.
* Urban Swimming-Bath (1873) and the Johanneum, a school building from 1869/71, both Neoclassical buildings.
* Heinrich Marschner&#x27;s Birthplace, a house from 17th century.

==Culture==
There are roughly 3,500 students studying at the Zittau/Görlitz University of Applied Sciences and at the independent International Graduate School, Germany&#x27;s smallest university; it caters to students from nearby Poland and the Czech Republic.

==Transport==
===Road===
The city lacks connections to good infrastructure in Germany, but a direct link is planned to the nearest motorway between Bautzen and Görlitz. The town is relatively well-connected to Liberec and the rest of the Czech Republic through dual-carriageway 35 just south of the town.

===Rail===
Zittau railway station is located north of the town&#x27;s centre. Passenger services are operated by three railway companies. The first being Vogtlandbahn, which provides a services from Dresden to Zittau and then directly through to Liberec in the Czech Republic. The second is Ostdeutsche Eisenbahn (ODEG), which links Zittau to Görlitz, with connections to Poland, and Cottbus, where connections to Berlin exist. Zittau is located on the Zittau–Löbau railway which was originally opened in 1848, making it one of the oldest railways in Germany.

The Zittau–Kurort Oybin/Kurort Jonsdorf railway with all together four stations within Zittau&#x27;s limits is a heritage narrow-gauge railway taking passengers from Zittau to the mountain spa resort towns of Oybin and Jonsdorf in the Zittau Mountains. It is operated by the Saxon-Upper Lusatian Railway Company.

==Border crossings==

Zittau is located close to the point where the Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland meet and there are several international border crossings in the vicinity. Permanent immigration and customs controls were, however, removed on 21 December 2007, when all three countries became part of the Schengen Area.

===Germany–Czech Republic===
*Hartau – Hrádek nad Nisou: Located in the village of Hartau south of Zittau, this crossing is for pedestrians only.

===Germany–Poland===
*Zittau Chopinstraße – Sieniawka: This crossing-point consists of a road bridge over the Lausitzer Neisse River which forms the border between Germany and Poland to the east of Zittau. The Polish town after the crossing is Sieniawka (&quot;Kleinschönau&quot; before 1945).
*Zittau Friedenstraße – Porajów: Also consisting of a road bridge over the Lausitzer Neisse River south of Zittau. The Polish village after the border is Porajów (&quot;Großporitsch&quot;). This crossing is used for those proceeding to the Czech Republic via the Czech-Polish border crossing south of Porajow. The Czech border crossing is located at Hrádek nad Nisou (&quot;Grottau&quot;).
*Zittau Lusatiaweg – Porajów: this formerly closed bridge was re-opened to pedestrians and cyclists in December 2007.

Zittau is the only city along the Oder–Neisse line where a number of river bridges remain closed as international crossing-points between Germany and Poland even though both countries are in the Schengen Area.

<text>Vril Dox, also known as [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac 2]], is a fictional character published by DC Comics. He first appeared in &quot;Superman&quot; #167 (February 1964), and was created by Edmond Hamilton, Cary Bates, and Curt Swan.

==Publication history==
Vril Dox is the heir of Brainiac, one of Superman&#x27;s greatest foes, and an ancestor of Querl Dox / Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. The character first appeared in &quot;Superman&quot; #167 (February 1964), by Edmond Hamilton, Cary Bates, and Curt Swan, in a story entitled &quot;The Deadly Duo! - The Team of Luthor and Brainiac!&quot;. He was later resurrected in &quot;Invasion!&quot; #1 (January 1989), by Keith Giffen, Bill Mantlo, and Todd McFarlane, and reimagined as a clone of Brainiac.

He went on to star in &quot;L.E.G.I.O.N. &#x27;89&quot; (February 1989) through &quot;L.E.G.I.O.N. &#x27;94&quot; (September 1994) by Keith Giffen, Alan Grant, and Barry Kitson. He returned in the follow-up series &quot;R.E.B.E.L.S. &#x27;94&quot; (October 1994) through &quot;R.E.B.E.L.S. &#x27;96&quot; (March 1996) by Tom Peyer and Arnie Jorgensen, and the subsequent series &quot;R.E.B.E.L.S.&quot; (2009–2011).

==Fictional character biography==
===Silver Age===
Vril Dox was a young Coluan who was adopted by the Computer Tyrants of Colu and declared Brainiac&#x27;s son (Brainiac 2). He escaped and led a rebellion against the Computer Tyrants which overthrew their rule. He later appeared briefly in the &quot;Secrets of the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; miniseries. His descendants (who had inherited long Coluan lifespans) were his son Pran Dox (Brainiac 3), his grandson Kajz Dox (Brainiac 4) and ultimately his great-grandson Querl Dox, Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super Heroes.

===Post-Crisis===
====&quot;Invasion!&quot;====

Vril Dox II is a now a clone of Vril Dox (Brainiac), rather than his adopted son, as he is created by Vril Dox himself. He is still regarded as Brainiac&#x27;s &quot;heir&quot;, as he has inherited the original&#x27;s high intelligence and ethics.

====&quot;L.E.G.I.O.N. &#x27;89-94&quot;====

Vril Dox is the founder of the interplanetary police force Licensed Extra Governmental Interstellar Operatives Network (abbreviated as L.E.G.I.O.N., an acronym suggested by Strata but accepted by Dox). It was founded through outright murder when Vril and his allies destroyed a criminal drug ring. Chief Dox tries to manipulate everyone he came across, not generally accepting when they did not follow his plans. He manages to gain control of the bounty hunter Lobo. This is partly by outsmarting and outfighting Lobo and taking advantage of one of the bounty hunter&#x27;s simple ethics; that he never breaks his word. The group also has fought the alien crime lord Maximillian G&#x27;odd and the mercenary Ice Man.

Vril leads the Earth&#x27;s heroes in the 1992 &quot;Annual&quot; crossover, they travel to the Moon and defeat the Eclipso entity.

====&quot;R.E.B.E.L.S. &#x27;94-96&quot;====

Vril had a son named Lyrl Dox (Brainiac 3) who rebelled and took over his organization. Vril later regains control of L.E.G.I.O.N by bartering with the demon Neron for the information on how to do it. The deal is for the soul of one of his unborn offspring. In addition, Vril asks Neron to have Ice Man not be a problem to them. After the cancellation of the title, he would only occasionally appear in the more cosmic DCU titles. For example, he appears in the 2004 Adam Strange miniseries, using robotic soldiers to hunt Strange. Dox, now missing his hair, incorrectly believes Rann had been destroyed at the hands of Strange. Dox&#x27;s forces assist in the limited series &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;.

====&quot;R.E.B.E.L.S.&quot; (2009–2011)====
A new 2009 series features Starro taking control of a now completely automated L.E.G.I.O.N. Dox, along with his old compatriot, Strata, must form a new team to regain his former status. In &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Dox comes into contact with the mother of his son, who was killed by L.E.G.I.O.N. drones and resurrected as a Black Lantern. Dox was also in an area in which a Sinestro Corps member was murdered by another Black Lantern. When the ring started to search for a new host, it selected Dox, making him a member of the Sinestro Corps. However, not even the power of the ring was a match for the Black Lanterns, forcing Dox to teleport them to Starro&#x27;s homeworld, despite the fact that his son, Lyrl (who had recently had his intelligence restored by the warlord) was there also. Soon after, the ring rejected Dox, who had repeatedly refused Sinestro&#x27;s mandate that all members of the Sinestro Corps were to gather at Korugar, and declared that he had been discharged from the Corps.

R.E.B.E.L.S. helped to save the Vega system and several galaxies by defeating Starro the Conqueror. The plight of Rann&#x27;s people was soon resolved by Vril Dox, seeking to restore his reputation after Starro the Conqueror stole L.E.G.I.O.N. from him and used it to enslave its client worlds. Dox Zeta-beamed Rann into the Vega system, in the orbit previously held by the now destroyed planet Tamaran, and proceeded to terraform Rann and make it suitable to sustain life again.

The restoration of the planet Rann was not Dox&#x27;s only reason for relocating it into the Vega system. First, by putting Rann into Tamaran&#x27;s orbit, it restored the gravitational balance to the Vega system, which had been thrown off by Tamaran&#x27;s destruction. Secondly, in exchange for restoring their planet, the people of Rann agreed to let Dox rebuild L.E.G.I.O.N. headquarters on Rann.

Tamaranian refugees, led by Blackfire, attacked Rann believing that since the planet was in Tamaran&#x27;s orbit they had claim to it. The violence was ended when Vril Dox, who was off-world at the start of the conflict, arrived with Thanagarian warships and stopped the fighting without bloodshed on either side. As it turned out, Dox was off-world negotiating an official end to the Rann–Thanagar War, using Rann&#x27;s new-found distance from Thanagar and change in leadership on both sides as leverage.

Dox then went on to mediate the tension between the Rannians and the Tamaranians by proposing that the Tamaranians live on Rann&#x27;s uninhabited southern continent.

Dox, Adam Strange and other senior commanders of L.E.G.I.O.N. also ensured peace with the Green Lantern Corps and helped create an alliance between Rannians, Tamaranians and L.E.G.I.O.N. after defeating Starro the Conqueror, ensuring security for Rann, the Vega system and the galaxy, with Dox becoming consort to Blackfire.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC universe. In &quot;Superman&quot; vol. 3 Annual #2, Vril Dox is shown to be Brainiac&#x27;s original identity.

===Rebirth===
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. When Brainiac&#x27;s home planet of Colu falls under the threat of four beings that escaped the Source Wall at the end of &quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot;, the teams of heroes and villains realize that their armor is pulling them into four teams towards four different energy sources in the form of trees that coincide with the four entities. Batman&#x27;s team finds Vril Dox, who claims that his father would never put his faith in the Earth heroes, as he only needed their powers to save Colu, but his plan required him at every step. With Brainiac&#x27;s death at the hands of Amanda Waller, the planet of Colu and Earth are doomed.

<text>The Central Railroad of New Jersey, also known as the Jersey Central, Jersey Central Lines or New Jersey Central , was a Class I railroad with origins in the 1830s. It was absorbed into Conrail in April 1976 along with several other prominent bankrupt railroads of the Northeastern United States.

The CNJ&#x27;s main line had a major presence in New Jersey. Most of the main line is now used by the Raritan Valley Line passenger service. CNJ main line trackage in Phillipsburg, New Jersey became part of the Lehigh Line under Conrail.

==History==
===19th century===
The earliest railroad ancestor of the CNJ was the Elizabethtown &amp; Somerville Railroad, incorporated in 1831 and opened from Elizabethport to Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 1836. Horses gave way to steam in 1839, and the railroad was extended west, reaching Somerville at the beginning of 1842. The Somerville and Easton Railroad was incorporated in 1847 and began building westward. 

In 1849, it purchased the Elizabethtown &amp; Somerville and adopted a new name: Central Railroad Company of New Jersey. The line reached Phillipsburg, on the east bank of the Delaware River, in 1852. It was extended east across Newark Bay to Jersey City in 1864, and it gradually acquired branches to Flemington, Newark, Perth Amboy, Chester, and Wharton.

The New Jersey Southern (NJS) began construction in 1860 at Port Monmouth. The railroad worked its way southwest across lower New Jersey and reached Bayside, New Jersey, on the Delaware River west of Bridgeton, New Jersey in 1871. The NJS came under control of the CNJ in 1879. CNJ&#x27;s influence briefly extended across the Delaware River in the form of the Baltimore &amp; Delaware Bay Railroad, from Bombay Hook, Delaware, east of Townsend, to Chestertown, Maryland. That line became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) family in 1901.

CNJ&#x27;s lines in Pennsylvania were built by the Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company as the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad (L&amp;S). The main line was completed between Phillipsburg, New Jersey, and Wilkes-Barre in 1866. A notable feature of the line was the Ashley Planes, a steep stretch of line (maximum grade was 14.65%) operated by cables driven by stationary engines, which would remain in service until after World War II. CNJ leased the L&amp;S in 1871. The line was extended to Scranton in 1888 by a subsidiary of the L&amp;S, the Wilkes-Barre &amp; Scranton; L&amp;S leased the line upon completion and assigned the lease to the CNJ. The bulk of the traffic on the Pennsylvania lines was anthracite coal, much of it produced by subsidiaries of the railroad, until the Commodities Clause of the Interstate Commerce Act of 1920 forbade railroads to haul freight in which they had an interest.

From 1883 to 1887, the CNJ was leased to and operated by the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad, with which it formed a New York-Philadelphia route. CNJ resumed its own management after reorganization in 1887.

The primary rolling stock repair shops were located in Elizabethport, New Jersey, along Trumbull Avenue. In 1901, the original shops were razed. New, concrete shops took their place, capable of servicing 430 locomotives and 20,000 freight cars annually. With the primary freight and passenger yards at Jersey City, New Jersey, opposite Manhattan, a terminal and shop site was also needed in the Communipaw neighborhood. This facility was modernized in 1914 and included two roundhouses and light repair shops.

===20th century===

In 1901, the Reading Company (RDG), successor to the Philadelphia &amp; Reading, acquired control of the CNJ through purchase of a majority of its stock, and at about the same time Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) acquired control of the RDG, gaining access to New York over RDG and CNJ rails.

In 1929, CNJ inaugurated the &quot;Blue Comet&quot;, a deluxe coach train operating twice daily between Jersey City and Atlantic City. It was painted blue from the pilot of its 4-6-2 to the rear bulkhead of its observation car, and its refurbished cars offered a level of comfort much higher than the usual day coach of the era. The train was the forerunner of the coach streamliners that blossomed nationwide in the late 1930s and the 1940s. It succumbed to automobile competition in 1941. Also in 1929 CNJ purchased a 30 percent interest in the Raritan River Railroad, a 12-mile (19 km) short line from South Amboy to New Brunswick. In 1931 it acquired total ownership of the Wharton &amp; Northern Railroad and a partial interest in the Mount Hope Mineral Railroad from Warren Foundry &amp; Pipe Corporation.

Following World War II, passenger traffic diminished, and was almost entirely commuter business, requiring great amounts of rolling stock for two short periods five days a week. Three-fourths of CNJ&#x27;s freight traffic terminated on line; the railroad was essentially a terminal carrier, which meant little if any profit. In addition, taxes levied by the state of New Jersey ate up much of CNJ&#x27;s revenue. 

In 1946, the lines in Pennsylvania were organized as the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania (CRP) in an effort to escape taxation by the state of New Jersey. CNJ resumed its own operation of the Pennsylvania lines at the end of 1952. The CRP continued in existence as owner of the Easton &amp; Western, four miles of track in Easton, Pennsylvania.

The merger between the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and Norfolk and Western Railway proposed in 1965 sought to counter the impending PRR merger with New York Central Railroad merger was to have included CNJ, but the bankruptcy of Penn Central Transportation Company killed that prospect. CNJ drafted elaborate plans for reorganization; they came to naught as neighboring railroads collapsed. Conrail took over freight operations of the CNJ on April 1, 1976; passenger routes were transferred to the New Jersey Department of Transportation, including the present New Jersey Transit North Jersey Coast Line and Raritan Valley Line.

In 1961, the Lehigh and New England Railroad was abandoned, and CNJ acquired a few of its branches and organized them as the Lehigh and New England Railroad. In 1963, Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation sold its railroad properties to the RDG, although the lease to the CNJ continued.

In 1964, the state of New Jersey began subsidizing commuter service, and the tax situation changed in 1967. 

In 1965, CNJ and the Lehigh Valley Railroad consolidated their lines along the Lehigh River in Pennsylvania and portions of each railroad&#x27;s line were abandoned; the commercial anthracite traffic that had supported both railroads had largely disappeared. CNJ operations in Pennsylvania ended March 31, 1972.

CNJ maintained a small carfloat terminal in The Bronx. It was the site of the first successful Class 1 railroad diesel operation. Over the years, CNJ maintained an extensive marine operation on New York Bay, including a steamer line to Sandy Hook. 

On April 30, 1967, CNJ&#x27;s last marine service—the ferry line between Manhattan and CNJ&#x27;s rail terminal at Jersey City—made its last run, which was also the last day for the terminal itself; the next day CNJ passenger trains began originating and terminating at the PRR station in Newark via the Aldene Connection, where New York City passengers could transfer to either PRR or Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) trains.

On August 6, 1978, the Bayonne &quot;Scoot&quot; ran for the last time. The CRRNJ Newark Bay Bridge would be abandoned and the lift spans demolished in July and August of 1980.

In 1979, CNJ emerged from bankruptcy as Central Jersey Industries, later renamed CJI Industries. In 1986, it merged with the packaging company Triangle Industries, owned by Nelson Peltz.

==Main initial corridors==
CNJ had its northeastern terminus at Elizabethport, New Jersey. In 1864 CNJ extended its railroad across the bay into Bayonne, and north to the Jersey City terminus. It had used a succession of bridges over the years, the last being Newark Bay Bridge, demolished in the 1980s.

From Elizabethport, trains went to different corridors. One headed towards Elizabeth and Plainfield and points west and southwest. The second went south towards Perth Amboy and today&#x27;s North Jersey Coast Line and different southern New Jersey destinations. CNJ operated several trains into Pennsylvania and other points west or south, in association with the RDG. B&amp;O also used CNJ tracks for the final approach to Jersey City.

*&quot;Mermaid&quot;: Sandy Hook, New Jersey-Scranton, Pennsylvania
*&quot;Queen of the Valley&quot;: Jersey City-Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (with RDG)
*&quot;Wall Street&quot;: Jersey City-Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (with RDG)
*&quot;Williamsporter&quot;: Jersey City, New Jersey-Williamsport, Pennsylvania

Several non-CNJ trains operated over CNJ trackage north of Bound Brook, New Jersey to the Jersey City terminal:
*&quot;Capitol Limited&quot;: Jersey City, New Jersey-Chicago, Illinois (B&amp;O)
*&quot;National Limited&quot;: Jersey City, New Jersey-St. Louis, Missouri (B&amp;O)
*&quot;Royal Blue&quot;: Jersey City, New Jersey-Washington, D.C. (B&amp;O)

== Heritage units ==

To celebrate its 30th anniversary in 2012, Norfolk Southern painted 20 new locomotives with predecessor schemes. NS #1071, an EMD SD70ACe locomotive, was painted with the CNJ orange and blue.

In 2019, NJ Transit painted locomotive 4109 in a heritage scheme based on that of the CNJ GP40P.

<text>Chea Sim (; 15 November 19328 June 2015) was a Cambodian politician. He was President of the Cambodian People&#x27;s Party from 1991 to 2015, President of the National Assembly of Cambodia from 1981 to 1998 (Vice President from June to October 1993) and President of the Senate from 1999 to 2015. His official title was Samdech Akka Moha Thamma Pothisal Chea Sim ().

==Life and career==
Chea Sim was born on 15 November 1932, in Romeas Haek, Svay Rieng Province to an ethnic Chinese family. As a young man, he partook in one of the first revolutionary movement by the communist Khmer People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (Khmer: គណបក្សប្រជាជនបដិវត្តន៍កម្ពុជា, KPRP), currently the ruling party of Cambodia. The movement which he joined was against Colonial France in the early 1950s. He later became a military commander of the communist Khmer Rouge even before it finally toppled the US-backed Lon Nol government in 1975.

Like Heng Samrin and Hun Sen, he defected in 1978 from the Khmer Rouge, which was backed by China, and fled to Vietnam to join an anti-Khmer Rouge movement known as a resistance faction groomed by Vietnam. He later held positions in the new party and People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea government, installed and backed by Vietnam after it invaded Cambodia and ousted the Khmer Rouge in 1979. He was among the founding members of the United Front for the National Salvation of Kampuchea, the Vietnam-backed group that defeated the Khmer Rouge in 1979.

Chea Sim was considered an important figure when negotiations happened, resulting in the 1991 Paris Peace Accord, which brokered a deal supposed to end three decades of civil war and paved the way for the U.N.-organized elections in 1993. After the elections, even though the royalist FUNCINPEC party topped the polls at that time, Hun Sen insisted that it share power with his Cambodian People&#x27;s Party, and four years later grabbed the sole power for his Cambodia People&#x27;s Party.

From 6 April 1992 to 14 June 1993, Chea Sim served as the nation&#x27;s interim leader (Chairman of the Council of State) before Cambodia became a constitutional monarchy. He also acted as Head of State on behalf of King Norodom Sihanouk for brief periods in 1993, 1994, 1995 and 2004. Sihanouk awarded Chea Sim the honorary title of Sâmdech in 1993.

After the King announced his permanent abdication on October 7, 2004, Chea Sim once again became acting Head of State. In the same year, he was escorted out of the country after refusing to sign off as acting head of state on changing the constitution, which would eventually help the CPP and the Funcinpec parties form a coalition government under the deal between Hun Sen and prince Norodom Ranariddh.

Many saw it as the first-ever public display of power struggle and infighting between Hun Sen and Chea Sim. Subsequently, Hun Sen continued his tactic of replacing Chea Sim&#x27;s loyalists with his favourite candidates for important roles in the party and government. Chea Sim had led a powerful faction within the ruling CPP party which was at times at odds with Hun Sen and his supporters, but many describe Sim&#x27;s role after that as little more than symbolic.

== Illness and death ==
Chea Sim left the position of acting Head of State on 14 October 2004, when Norodom Sihamoni became king. He was absent from the 63rd anniversary celebrations of the CPP in June 2014, following years in which age and illness from high blood pressure, diabetes, and other chronic ailments forced him to back away from his roles and receive medical care in Vietnam. &quot;The Phnom Penh Post&quot; reported that Hun Sen was publicly referred to as “acting CPP president” for the first time at the anniversary event. In the months leading to his death, Chea Sim&#x27;s signature continued to appear on documents passed by the Senate, of which he was president, but which was in practice presided over by his Deputy President, Say Chhum.

He died on 8 June 2015. Norodom Sihamoni, King of Cambodia, signed a royal decree to establish a commission to organize the funeral of Chea Sim. The commission was chaired by Heng Samrin, President of the National Assembly along with three vice chairmen, including Prime Minister Hun Sen; Say Chhum, Acting President of Senate; Kong Sam Ol, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Royal Palace. Cambodia scheduled a formal mourning ceremony for Chea Sim for 19 June 2015.

== Commentary ==
Human Rights Watch Asia Director Brad Adams described it as a &quot;mockery of justice&quot; that Chea Sim was able to continue being one of the rulers of the post-Khmer Rouge government without being brought to justice, as Chea Sim was accused of overseeing atrocities committed under his role as a military commander. Brad Adams also accused Chea Sim of operating &quot;a police state&quot; in the 1980s that arrested, imprisoned, and tortured Cambodian political activists without trial.

Minister of Information Khieu Kanharith criticized &quot;The Phnom Penh Post&quot; for publishing an article which accused Chea Sim of violating human rights under the Khmer Rouge regime. Khieu Kanharith said that in the Cambodian tradition, respect for the dead is very important during the mourning ceremony and that &quot;The Phnom Penh Post&quot; could be sued if Chea Sim&#x27;s family members wished to do so.

AKP argued, in that barbaric regime, Samdech Chea Sim was just a simple local official. AKP argued Chea Sim and his family members were also victims (of the regime) as other Cambodian people. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior strongly rejected the comments made by Director of Asia Division for Human Rights Watch and quoted by The Phnom Penh Post.

Sam Rainsy, the leader and co-founder of the main opposition party, Cambodia National Rescue Party, and a member of Parliament (MP) for Kampong Cham since July 2014, hailed Chea Sim as a national hero and likened him to the popular late king Norodom Sihanouk who, Rainsy said, considered Chea Sim as his &quot;little brother&quot;. Once considered as the second most powerful man in the government after Hun Sen, Chea Sim, as Rainsy said, was highly regarded for his patriotic ideals and national reconciliation after the Khmer Rouge.

<text>Leroy Frank Van Dyke (born October 4, 1929) is an American country music and honky-tonk singer and guitarist, best known for his hits &quot;The Auctioneer&quot; (1956) and &quot;Walk on By&quot; (1961).

==Biography==

Van Dyke was born in Mora, Missouri and graduated from the University of Missouri, majoring in agricultural journalism as well as being a member of FarmHouse Fraternity. He was catapulted into country music fame in 1956 with his composition &quot;The Auctioneer&quot;, which sold over 2.5 million records. He wrote the song about the life of his cousin, National Auctioneers Association Hall of Famer Ray Sims, also a Missourian. Van Dyke had the lead role of a budding country music performer in the 1967 movie &quot;What Am I Bid?&quot; in which Sims played himself as an auctioneer.

In his 50 years-plus career, Van Dyke has recorded more than 500 songs, dozens of them making the charts. His record of &quot;Walk on By&quot; (1961) was named by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine in 1994 as the biggest country single of all time, based on sales, plays, and weeks in the charts. It stayed at number one in the U.S. country chart for 19 weeks, and in all, charted for 42 weeks, reaching number five on the pop listings. It sold more than 1.5 million copies.

Other Van Dyke hits were &quot;If a Woman Answers&quot;, &quot;Black Cloud&quot;, &quot;Big Man in a Big House&quot;, &quot;Anne of a Thousand Days&quot;, &quot;Happy to Be Unhappy&quot;, &quot;Night People&quot;, &quot;Be a Good Girl&quot;, &quot;Dim Dark Corner&quot;, &quot;Five Steps Away&quot;, &quot;How Long Must You Keep Me a Secret&quot;, &quot;Afraid of a Heartache&quot;, &quot;Big Wide Wonderful World of Country Music&quot;, &quot;Birmingham&quot;, &quot;Just a State of Mind&quot;, &quot;Mr. Professor&quot;, &quot;My World Is Caving In&quot;, &quot;The Other Boys Are Talking&quot;, &quot;Poor Guy&quot;, &quot;Roses from a Stranger&quot;, &quot;Texas Tea&quot;, &quot;Who’s Gonna Run the Truck Stop in Tuba City When I’m Gone&quot;, &quot;Wrong Side of the Tracks&quot;, &quot;Your Daughter Cried All Night&quot;, &quot;Your Money&quot;, and &quot;The Life You Offered Me&quot;.

In the UK Singles Chart Van Dyke had two hits: &quot;Walk on By&quot; reached number five in February 1962, and &quot;Big Man in a Big House&quot; made number 34 in May that year.

He was a cast member in the late 1950s on &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot;, and was co-host, with Bill Mack, of the Southern Baptist Radio/TV Commission-produced &quot;Country Crossroads&quot; radio show for 10 years, and was joined by a third co-host Jerry Clower. It became the most widely syndicated radio show in country music history.

Van Dyke continues a performance schedule, traveling from his office/home complex on his 1,000-acre (4 km2) ranch in west-central Missouri near Sedalia, Missouri. He is a member of the National Auctioneers Association Hall of Fame, is active in many music industry organizations, and as a sideline, raises premium quality Arabian mules. All aspects of Leroy Van Dyke Enterprises are managed by his wife Gladys, a former legal secretary and court reporter. Their son Ben plays lead guitar in all Van Dyke performances. Van Dyke is also a Korean War veteran.

<doc id="1050041" wikidata="Q732996" url="?curid=1050041" title="Withdean Stadium">
<text>Withdean Stadium is an athletics stadium in Withdean, a suburb of Brighton. It was constructed in 1930. It was the home track of Olympic athlete Steve Ovett. Between 1999 and 2011 it was the home ground of football team Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.

== History ==
The site was opened as a lawn tennis club venue in 1936, having been used as playing fields before this. The centre court had seating for 2,000 and was used for the Davis Cup match between Great Britain and New Zealand in the spring of 1939. Later developments included a zoo and miniature railway.

In 1955 the then mayor of Brighton, Walter Dudeney, opened Brighton Sports Arena as a new athletics arena hosting various sporting activities and events. The arena was upgraded over the years, with lighting added and additional squash courts. In 1980 Steve Ovett opened an all-weather running track, which was resurfaced in 1997. In 1999 the stadium became the temporary home of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.

==Use by Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.==
The club&#x27;s original stadium, the Goldstone Ground, had been sold for commercial redevelopment in 1997. This resulted in the team playing their home matches for two seasons at Gillingham&#x27;s Priestfield Stadium, over from Brighton, before moving to Withdean Stadium. The only other local option for Albion had been to play at Sussex CCC&#x27;s County Cricket Ground, Hove.
Withdean Stadium was voted the fourth worst football stadium in the UK by &quot;The Observer&quot; in 2004. The temporary nature of the stadium was obvious - the stadium was primarily used for athletics; there was a single permanent stand along the north side, while the other stands were assembled from scaffolding, some of which also served as temporary seating at the Open Championship golf tournament. The largest was the South Stand, running the entire length of the pitch. The east end of the pitch contained two medium-sized and one small stand. One of the larger stands here was designated as the family stand. The West Stand was the designated away stand. Changing and hospitality facilities were provided with portable cabins placed haphazardly around the site, and there was very limited on-site car parking.

There was considerable opposition in the local neighbourhood to allowing the football club to use the stadium. After some unique concessions were made, the club was allowed to move into Withdean in 1999. Amplified music was banned during football matches (except for the traditional &quot;Sussex by the Sea&quot;), and matchday parking restrictions were imposed within a one-mile radius of the ground. After a year, the music restrictions were eased, but the parking limitations continued in force. The price of each match ticket also included a public transport voucher allowing free bus or rail travel throughout the Brighton and Hove area on match day.

For Albion&#x27;s match against Sheffield United on 2 October 2004 the stadium was temporarily renamed as it hosted the launch party for Fatboy Slim&#x27;s album of the same name. The album was released on Skint Records, then the club&#x27;s shirt sponsor, and for that match the team wore shirts bearing the name Palookaville instead of Skint. The name Palookaville was also considered humorously appropriate by fans because it reflected the inadequacy of the club&#x27;s temporary home.

Additional seating was added at the East and West Ends of the ground in November 2005. The club played their last game at Withdean on Saturday 30 April 2011 against Huddersfield Town.

Since the club has moved out, the temporary seating and other structures have been removed with only the original North Stand remaining, with seating for around 1,300.

== Withdean Sports Complex ==

Today the Stadium is part of the Withdean Sports Complex leisure centre owned by Brighton and Hove City Council and operated by Freedom Leisure. Facilities include squash and tennis courts, a gym and rock climbing wall.

<doc id="1050048" wikidata="Q619409" url="?curid=1050048" title="Falmer Stadium">
<text>Falmer Stadium, currently known as the American Express Stadium for sponsorship reasons and more commonly referred to as the Amex, is a football stadium in Falmer, Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, England. With a capacity of 31,876, it is the second largest stadium in South East England, after St Mary&#x27;s Stadium (Southampton), and the 29th largest stadium in the United Kingdom.

It serves as the home of Premier League club Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, and was handed over from the developers to the club on 31 May 2011. The first competitive game played at the stadium was the 2010–11 season final of the Sussex Senior Cup between Brighton and Eastbourne Borough on 16 July 2011. The first league game was against Doncaster Rovers, who were also the opponents in the last game played at Brighton&#x27;s former stadium, the Goldstone Ground, 14 years earlier.

Falmer Stadium hosted Premier League football for the first time in August 2017, following Albion&#x27;s promotion at the end of the 2016–17 season. Falmer Stadium hosted European football for the first time on 21 September 2023 when Brighton played against AEK in the UEFA Europa League.

The stadium was designed to allow hosting for other sports and events. It hosted some matches from the 2015 Rugby World Cup and the UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2022. It will also host some 2025 Women&#x27;s Rugby World Cup fixtures.

==History==

===Plans===
The plans were initiated by Brighton &amp; Hove Albion after the club&#x27;s previous home, the Goldstone Ground, was sold by the club&#x27;s former board (consisting of Greg Stanley, Bill Archer and David Bellotti) to developers in 1995 with no new home arranged.

When the club was evicted at the end of the 1996–1997 season, it groundshared for two seasons at Gillingham&#x27;s Priestfield Stadium, 74 miles away by road, in Kent.

Two years later, the club returned to Brighton as tenants of Withdean Stadium, which was upgraded to Football League capacity requirements and later expanded when Brighton reached Division One (now the EFL Championship) in 2002 following two successive promotions.

The site at Falmer was identified during the 1998–99 season and it was hoped that the stadium would be ready in the early to mid-2000s. However, subsequent delays in gaining planning permission meant that the club had to wait until August 2011 before being able to play their home games there – more than a decade after the stadium was first proposed.

===Planning permission===
Planning permission was given by the unitary authority of Brighton and Hove City Council in June 2002, with the intention of the stadium being ready for the 2005–06 season. The plans for the stadium were opposed by neighbouring Lewes District Council and local residents. While the stadium lies completely within Brighton and Hove, part of the north-east of the site is in Lewes. Bennett&#x27;s Field, as it is known, was initially used for parking, but has been abandoned since 2021.

Further complications were due to both vacant fields, and the campus of the adjacent University of Sussex, being included in the South Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, although outside the National Park. This led to the designation of the stadium plans being the subject of a separate planning inquiry by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.

John Prescott, then Deputy Prime Minister, approved the plans on 28 October 2005. However, Lewes District Council immediately mounted a new legal challenge to the stadium plan. In April 2006, Prescott admitted that he had given his approval based on the misconception that only a small part of the stadium site lay on the Lewes side, and withdrew it.

Hazel Blears, the Secretary of State responsible for planning, re-affirmed the approval on 25 July 2007. Her decision went against the advice of planning inspectors. Lewes District Council, Falmer Parish Council and the South Downs Joint Committee (the three main opponents) announced shortly afterwards that they would not mount a High Court challenge. On 4 September 2007, the deadline for appealing the new grant of permission expired and the club received full permission to proceed.

===Construction===

On 27 November 2008, the Buckingham Group signed the construction contract for the new stadium and began preparation work on the site on 17 December. The stadium is set three storeys down into the ground. 138,000 cubic metres of chalk was excavated during its construction, which was put on the field on the south side of Village Way. This has been estimated to prevent 22,000 lorry trips taking the chalk to off-site landfill.

Construction at the site started on 17 December 2008 and finished in May 2011. The stadium was designed with scope for expansion, and plans were put in place to increase the capacity.

The stadium was designed by London-based architects, KSS. The stadium capacity has been expanded, with an extra seating tier being installed above the East Stand (Family stand), which increases the capacity to over 30,000 seats. The deal with American Express Europe, Brighton and Hove&#x27;s biggest private-sector employer, confirming the stadium&#x27;s naming rights was announced on 22 June 2010.

===Opening===

The stadium officially opened on 30 July 2011, hosting a friendly match against then-Brighton manager Gus Poyet&#x27;s old club Tottenham Hotspur, the home-side narrowly losing 3–2. The first competitive match had been held on 16 July 2011, when Brighton&#x27;s development squad beat Eastbourne Borough 2–0 in the Sussex Senior Cup final, with Gary Hart scoring the first goal. The first competitive first team fixture was held on 6 August 2011, when Brighton beat Doncaster Rovers 2–1, after being 1–0 down.

The stadium set its first record attendance with 21,897 against Liverpool. They were also the first away team to win a competitive match at the stadium, beating Brighton 2–1 in a League Cup tie in September 2011. The stadium witnessed its first league defeat in its history when rival side Crystal Palace came from behind to win 3–1.

===In use===
On 2 January 2012, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion submitted an application to Brighton and Hove City council to increase the stadium capacity by a further 8,000 seats as well as to add additional corporate boxes, new television facilities and a luxury suite. This was granted unanimously by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council&#x27;s planning committee on 25 April 2012. The stadium was expanded to 27,250 by the start of the 2012–13 season, 27,750 by December 2012 and stood at 30,750 by the end of the 2012–13 season.
A new record attendance was set on 15 December 2012 when 26,684 saw Brighton draw 0–0 with Nottingham Forest. This record attendance was broken on 26 January 2013, when 27,113 attended a 3–2 defeat against Arsenal in the fourth round of the FA Cup Less than two months later and the record was broken again; this time 28,499 people watched Brighton beat Crystal Palace 3–0 on 17 March 2013. This record was broken once again on 4 May 2013, on the last league game of the season against Wolverhampton Wanderers, 30,003 attended the game. This figure was beaten on 25 January 2015, when Arsenal visited in the FA Cup fourth round to once again win 3–2, in front of an attendance of 30,278. Another new attendance record of 30,292 came on 2 May 2016, when Derby County visited in the last home game of the 2015–16 season. A few weeks later this record was broken again when Brighton and Hove Albion played Sheffield Wednesday in the second leg of the play-offs. The record was broken once again on 24 September 2017 when 30,468 attended Brighton&#x27;s 1–0 win over Newcastle United. The current record of 31,746 was set at a Premier League match against Chelsea on 29 October 2022. Falmer Stadium hosted European football for the first time on 21 September 2023 when Brighton played against AEK in the UEFA Europa League.

On 25 March 2013, the stadium hosted England&#x27;s under-21s international friendly against Austria&#x27;s under-21s.

In December 2018, it was announced that the stadium would be one of the venues for the UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2022 tournament.

The stadium uses hawks to scare away seagulls and pigeons.

===UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2022===

<text>Alonso Álvarez de Pineda (; 1494–1520) was a Spanish conquistador and cartographer who was the first to prove the insularity of the Gulf of Mexico by sailing around its coast. In doing so he created the first map to depict what is now Texas and parts of the Gulf Coast of the United States.

==Life==
In Aldeacentenera, Spain, in 1494, he led several expeditions in 1519 to map the westernmost coastlines of the Gulf of Mexico, from the Yucatán Peninsula to the Pánuco River, and also explored parts of Florida, which at the time was believed to be an island. Antón de Alaminos&#x27; explorations had eliminated the western areas as being the site of the passage, leaving the land between the Pánuco River and Florida to be mapped. An expedition was organized to chart the remainder of the Gulf. Francisco de Garay, Governor of the Colony of Santiago, outfitted three ships with two hundred and seventy soldiers and placed them under the command of Álvarez de Pineda, who left Santiago in early 1520 and sailed west to follow the northern coastline of the Gulf. At the western tip of southern Florida, he attempted to sail east, but the winds were not on his side, somehow he did anchor off Villa Rica de la Veracruz shortly after Hernán Cortés had departed. Cortés returned on hearing of Álvarez de Pineda&#x27;s arrival. Álvarez de Pineda wished to establish a boundary between the lands he was claiming for Garay and those that Cortés had already claimed; Cortés was unwilling to bargain, and Álvarez de Pineda left to retrace his route northward.

Shortly thereafter, he sailed up a river he named Las Palmas, where he spent over 40 days repairing his ships. The Las Palmas was most likely the Pánuco River near present-day Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico. Álvarez de Pineda was subsequently killed in a battle with the native Huastec people at the Pánuco River. Garay later sent two expeditions under Diego Camargo and Miguel Díez de Aux to find him, but they were unsuccessful, finding only his burned ships. Pineda&#x27;s map did make it back to Governor Garay.

The expedition established the remainder of the boundaries of the Gulf of Mexico while disproving the idea of a sea passage to Asia. It also verified that Florida was a peninsula instead of an island. Álvarez de Pineda became the first European to see the coastal areas of what is now western Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, lands he called &quot;Amichel&quot;. He also sailed upriver on the Mississippi River, being credited with the discovery of this river. His map is the first known document of Texas history and was the first map of the Gulf Coast region of the United States. It is stored at the Archivo General de Indias in Sevilla (Spain).

<text>Fort Dunree ( or &quot;Dún Fhraoigh&quot; meaning &quot;Fort of Heather&quot;) is a coastal defence fortification located on the west side of the Inishowen peninsula, County Donegal, Ireland.

==History==

The fort is located on a rocky promontory accessed over a natural fissure. Originally built as part of a series of fortifications defending Lough Swilly during the Napoleonic Wars, located opposite Knockalla Fort on the other side of the lough.

The fort was neglected after the peace of 1815. In 1874 it was armed with seven 24 Pounder guns.

It was remodelled in 1895 to have 2 x 4.7 inch (120 mm) QF guns below, and later 12-pounder (5 kg) QF and 2 x 6 inch (152 mm) guns in an upper land battery. The top of a hill overlooking the site was walled in to form a redoubt. Both 6-inch guns were operational during the First World War.

==Treaty port==

On 6 December 1921, the Anglo Irish Treaty was concluded. It provided for the establishment of the Irish Free State which happened on 6 December 1922. The Treaty included provisions by which the British would retain sovereignty over three strategically important ports known as the Treaty ports, one of which being described in the Treaty as:

Accordingly, even after the establishment of the Irish Free State, the Royal Navy continued to maintain its presence at Fort Dunree. Fort Dunree remained under British sovereignty until 3 October 1938 when, pursuant to the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement of 25 April 1938, the territory was ceded to Ireland. On 4 October 1938, &quot;The Times&quot; reported on the handover of Lough Swilly at Fort Dunree on 3 October 1938 as follows:

Two brothers in-law, one hauling down a Union Jack and the other hauling up an Irish tricolour was indeed a poignant end to the long history of British military presence in the territory of the Irish state. It was also the last time sovereignty over any territory was ceded to Ireland.

The guns at the Fort were manned by the Irish Army until decommissioned following the Second World War. Fort Dunree was used by the Irish Army for training until 1990.

==Preservation==
The fort is now a military museum with detailed exhibitions, many restored guns such as BL 6 inch Mk VII naval gun and an old military camp. There are also displays about the area birds, marine life and coastal vegetation.

Other facilities include a gift shop, auditorium, café and trail walks.

<doc id="1050057" wikidata="Q2122434" url="?curid=1050057" title="Quasidihedral group">
<text>In mathematics, the quasi-dihedral groups, also called semi-dihedral groups, are certain non-abelian groups of order a power of 2. For every positive integer &quot;n&quot; greater than or equal to 4, there are exactly four isomorphism classes of non-abelian groups of order 2&quot;n&quot; which have a cyclic subgroup of index 2. Two are well known, the generalized quaternion group and the dihedral group. One of the remaining two groups is often considered particularly important, since it is an example of a 2-group of maximal nilpotency class. In Bertram Huppert&#x27;s text &quot;Endliche Gruppen&quot;, this group is called a &quot;Quasidiedergruppe&quot;. In Daniel Gorenstein&#x27;s text, &quot;Finite Groups&quot;, this group is called the &quot;semidihedral group&quot;. Dummit and Foote refer to it as the &quot;quasidihedral group&quot;; we adopt that name in this article. All give the same presentation for this group:

:formula_1.

The other non-abelian 2-group with cyclic subgroup of index 2 is not given a special name in either text, but referred to as just &quot;G&quot; or M&quot;m&quot;(2). When this group has order 16, Dummit and Foote refer to this group as the &quot;modular group of order 16&quot;, as its lattice of subgroups is modular. In this article this group will be called the modular maximal-cyclic group of order formula_2. Its presentation is:

:formula_3.

Both these two groups and the dihedral group are semidirect products of a cyclic group &lt;&quot;r&quot;&gt; of order 2&quot;n&quot;−1 with a cyclic group &lt;&quot;s&quot;&gt; of order 2. Such a non-abelian semidirect product is uniquely determined by an element of order 2 in the group of units of the ring formula_4 and there are precisely three such elements, formula_5, formula_6, and formula_7, corresponding to the dihedral group, the quasidihedral, and the modular maximal-cyclic group.

The generalized quaternion group, the dihedral group, and the quasidihedral group of order 2&quot;n&quot; all have nilpotency class &quot;n&quot; − 1, and are the only isomorphism classes of groups of order 2&quot;n&quot; with nilpotency class &quot;n&quot; − 1. The groups of order &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; and nilpotency class &quot;n&quot; − 1 were the beginning of the classification of all &quot;p&quot;-groups via coclass. The modular maximal-cyclic group of order 2&quot;n&quot; always has nilpotency class 2. This makes the modular maximal-cyclic group less interesting, since most groups of order &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; for large &quot;n&quot; have nilpotency class 2 and have proven difficult to understand directly. 

The generalized quaternion, the dihedral, and the quasidihedral group are the only 2-groups whose derived subgroup has index 4. The Alperin–Brauer–Gorenstein theorem classifies the simple groups, and to a degree the finite groups, with quasidihedral Sylow 2-subgroups.

==Examples==

The Sylow 2-subgroups of the following groups are quasidihedral:
*PSL3(F&quot;q&quot;) for &quot;q&quot; ≡ 3 mod 4,
*PSU3(F&quot;q&quot;) for &quot;q&quot; ≡ 1 mod 4,
*the Mathieu group M11,
*GL2(F&quot;q&quot;) for &quot;q&quot; ≡ 3 mod 4.

<text>Lenan Head Fort, Lough Swilly, Inishowen, County Donegal was built in 1895, initially with three 9.2 inch Breech Loading (BL) guns. Following recommendations of the Owen Committee in 1905, it was refitted in 1911 with two newer Mark X 9.2 inch models. Both guns were operational during the First World War.

==Treaty port==

On 6 December 1921, the Anglo Irish Treaty was concluded. It provided for the establishment of the Irish Free State which happened on 6 December 1922. The Treaty included provisions by which the British would retain sovereignty over three strategically important ports known as the Treaty ports. This included a number of coastal artillery defences, including the Defences of Lough Swilly, which were retained by the British Government on a &quot;Care and maintenance&quot; basis. 

All of the defences were fully transferred to the Republic of Ireland in 1938, with the last Royal Artillery personnel leaving on 10 October that year. The battery was manned by the Irish Army in the Second World War. The Irish coast artillery service was disbanded in 1952. The battery was disarmed and the guns scrapped in the 1950s.

An unusual British fortified site, because it was started so late, it includes concrete caponiers in an extensive ditch system that climbs the hill to the headland.

<text>Ned&#x27;s Point Fort is one of several Napoleonic batteries built along the shores of Lough Swilly in county Donegal, to defend the north west of Ireland. It was part of a scheme to fortify Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle against French Invasion during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. It is situated on Ned&#x27;s Point, near the once important naval town of Buncrana, and its current form largely dates to works completed between 1812 and 1813. It comprised a rectangular blockhouse mounting two guns and a supporting battery mounting four guns. The fort is surrounded by a ditch.

After the end of the Napoleonic Wars the defences were neglected and not updated. In 1874, the fort was armed with two 5.5-inch Howitzers in the tower and four 24 Pounder smooth bore guns in the main battery.

It was remodeled in the 1890s as a battery with two 6-inch guns on hydropneumatic mountings. This included a central underground magazine complex and the height of the tower or blockhouse was also reduced. In addition two practice batteries were constructed for six 64 Pounder guns and four 5-inch Breech Loading (BL) guns. In 1905 it was recommended by the Owen Committee that the fort be disarmed. This was completed by 1907, and no armament was listed at the fort in a report dated to 1913.

The fort remains substantially intact, along with the practice batteries. Parts of the site were restored by Buncrana Town Council in the 1990s, and subject to some additional restoration as of 2012. While there are a number of walking routes in the area, the fort itself is not open to the public.

<doc id="1050097" wikidata="Q447879" url="?curid=1050097" title="Arlene Dahl">
<text>Arlene Carol Dahl (August 11, 1925 – November 29, 2021) was an American actress active in films from the late 1940s.

She was also an author and entrepreneur. She founded two companies, Arlene Dahl Enterprises and Dahlia, a fragrance company.

Born in Minnesota to parents of Norwegian descent, Dahl started her acting career in musicals before transitioning to film, where she gained significant roles in MGM productions such as &quot;My Wild Irish Rose&quot; (1947) and &quot;The Bride Goes Wild&quot; (1948). Dahl also starred in adventure films, notably &quot;Caribbean Gold&quot; (1952) and &quot;Desert Legion&quot; (1953).

Despite her acting success, Dahl faced financial challenges, declaring bankruptcy in 1981. She then entered the field of astrology, writing a syndicated column and operating a premium phoneline company. She also wrote numerous books on beauty and astrology.

In her personal life, Dahl had six husbands, including actors Lex Barker and Fernando Lamas, and was the mother to three children, the eldest of whom is actor Lorenzo Lamas. She lived between New York City and West Palm Beach, Florida, until her death in 2021.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Dahl was born on August 11, 1925, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Idelle () and Rudolph Dahl, a Ford Motor dealer and executive. Her parents were both of Norwegian descent. She cited her year of birth as 1928, although her birth record (1925-43442, available through the Minnesota Historical Society) shows she was born on August 11, 1925. An August 13, 2014, article in the &quot;New York Social Diary&quot; by David Patrick Columbia, titled &quot;Losses and Gains&quot;, references her 89th birthday celebration with her husband, children, and family.

As a child, Dahl took elocution and dancing lessons and was active in theatrical events at Margaret Fuller Elementary School, Ramsey Junior High School, and Washburn Senior High School. After graduating from high school, she performed in a local drama group and briefly worked as a model for department stores. Dahl&#x27;s mother was involved in local amateur theatre. Dahl briefly attended the University of Minnesota.

===Early career===
A year after graduation from high school, Dahl lived in Chicago, where she worked as a buyer for Marshall and Brown. She then traveled to New York and worked as a model for the Walter Thornton Model Agency, where she successfully auditioned for a part in the musical &quot;Mr. Strauss Goes to Boston&quot; in 1945. This led to her gaining the lead in another play, &quot;Questionable Ladies&quot;, which was seen by a talent scout from Hollywood.

Dahl had an uncredited bit part in &quot;Life with Father&quot; (1947). She was promoted to leading lady in &quot;My Wild Irish Rose&quot; (1947) with Dennis Morgan, a big hit that led to an offer from MGM for a long-term contract.

===MGM===
Dahl began working for MGM to play a supporting role in her first film, &quot;The Bride Goes Wild&quot; (1948), starring Van Johnson and June Allyson. She remained there to play the female lead in the Red Skelton comedy &quot;A Southern Yankee&quot; (1948).

Eagle-Lion hired her to star as the female lead in &quot;Reign of Terror&quot; (1949). Then at MGM, she acted opposite Van Johnson in &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; (1949); Robert Taylor in &quot;Ambush&quot; (1950); Joel McCrea in &quot;The Outriders&quot; (1950); Fred Astaire and Skelton in &quot;Three Little Words&quot; (1950), playing Eileen Percy; and Skelton again in &quot;Watch the Birdie&quot; (1950). Except for &quot;The Outriders&quot;, all these movies were profitable for MGM.

MGM gave Dahl the lead in several B movies, such as &quot;Inside Straight&quot; (1951) and &quot;No Questions Asked&quot; (1951), both of which flopped.

===Adventure films===

Dahl was hired by Pine-Thomas Productions to a multi-picture contract. She was cast in &quot;Caribbean Gold&quot; (1952), a swashbuckler starring John Payne.

She went to Universal-International to co-star with Alan Ladd in a French Foreign Legion story, &quot;Desert Legion&quot; (1953); then Pine-Thomas used her again in &quot;Jamaica Run&quot; (1953) and &quot;Sangaree&quot; (1953). The latter starred Fernando Lamas, whom Dahl would marry.

She supported Bob Hope in the comedy &quot;Here Come the Girls&quot; (1953). Dahl and Lamas reunited on &quot;The Diamond Queen&quot; (1953) at Warner Bros.

In 1953, Dahl played Roxanne on stage in a short-lived revival of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; opposite Jose Ferrer.

Dahl played the ambitious Carol Talbot in &quot;Woman&#x27;s World&quot; (1954) at Fox, and she was Rock Hudson&#x27;s leading lady in Universal&#x27;s adventure war film &quot;Bengal Brigade&quot; (1954).

She began writing a syndicated beauty column in 1952, and opened Arlene Dahl Enterprises in 1954, marketing cosmetics and designer lingerie.

Dahl began appearing on television, including episodes of &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot; (including a 1954 adaptation of &quot;Casablanca&quot;, wherein she played Ilsa) and &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot;.

Dahl was both a mystery guest (April 25, 1954) and a panelist on the CBS game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;. In 1953, she hosted ABC&#x27;s anthology series &quot;The Pepsi-Cola Playhouse&quot;.

John Payne and Dahl were reunited in a film noir, &quot;Slightly Scarlet&quot; (1956), alongside Rhonda Fleming, another red-haired star.

Dahl made some films in England for Columbia: &quot;Wicked as They Come&quot; (1956) and &quot;Fortune Is a Woman&quot; (1957). In 1957, she sued Columbia for $1 million, saying the film&#x27;s advertisements for &quot;Wicked as They Come&quot; were &quot;lewd&quot; and &quot;degraded&quot; her. A judge threw out the suit.

Dahl hosted the short-lived television series &quot;Opening Night&quot; (1958) and had the female lead in the adventure movie &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (1959), opposite James Mason and Pat Boone. She fainted from doing the whirlpool scene in the latter, but it turned out to be one of her most successful films.

===1960s===
In 1960, she appeared in the TV series &quot;Riverboat&quot; in the role of Lucy Belle in the episode &quot;That Taylor Affair&quot;. The same year, she married Texas oilman Christian Holmes and announced her retirement from acting. The marriage did not last, but Dahl increasingly diversified her work to become a lecturer and beauty consultant while she continued acting.

She had a supporting role in &quot;Kisses for My President&quot; (1964) and appeared in &quot;Land Raiders&quot; (1969), &quot;The Pleasure Pit&quot; (1969), and the French film &quot;Du blé en liasses&quot;. She also appeared on TV in &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; and &quot;Theatre of Stars&quot;.

Her focus by now was on business. After closing her company in 1967, she began serving as vice president at the ad agency Kenyon and Eckhardt that same year. In a 1969 interview, she said her old films were &quot;such an embarrassment&quot;.

===1970s===
Dahl also returned to Broadway in the early 1970s, replacing Lauren Bacall in the role of Margo Channing in &quot;Applause&quot;.

On television, she had a role on the soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and guest-starred on &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, &quot;Jigsaw John&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. She also made a TV movie, &quot;The Deadly Dream&quot; (1971). &quot;I like acting,&quot; she said in 1978, &quot;but I had better like business better or I&#x27;ll lose my shirt.&quot;

===1980s and 1990s===

In 1981, Dahl declared personal bankruptcy, with liabilities of almost $1 million and assets of only $623,970. Her chief creditor was the U.S. Small Business Administration, which guaranteed a $450,000 loan for her as an executive in a cosmetic firm. She had lost $163,000 from burglaries of jewelry and furs from her Manhattan apartment, and she earned only $11,367 in 1980 and $10,517 in 1979.

Dahl appeared on ABC&#x27;s soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; from 1981 to 1984 as Lucinda Schenck Wilson. The character was planned as a short-term role (she guest-starred from late 1981 to early 1982 and in late 1982), but Dahl later was offered a one-year contract to appear on the series from September 1983 to October 1984. In 1988 she starred in the film &quot;A Place to Hide&quot;.

Her last feature film role, which followed a hiatus of more than two decades, was in &quot;Night of the Warrior&quot; (1991). It co-starred her son Lorenzo Lamas.

She entered the field of astrology in the 1980s, writing a syndicated column and later operating a premium phoneline company. Dahl wrote more than two dozen books on the topics of beauty and astrology.

Dahl guest-starred on episodes of shows starring her son, &quot;Renegade&quot; and &quot;Air America&quot;.

== Business ventures ==
In 1951, Dahl began writing for a tri-weekly beauty column for &quot;Let&#x27;s Be Beautiful&quot;, a newspaper owned by &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; founder Robert McCormick.

In the mid-1950s, Dahl founded Arlene Dahl Enterprises, selling lingerie, nightgowns, pajamas and cosmetics. She invented the Dahl Beauty Cap, a knitted sleeping cap for women.

Dahl began working at Sears Roebuck as director of beauty products in 1970, earning nearly $750,000 annually, but she left in 1975 to found a short-lived fragrance company, Dahlia.

==Personal life==
Dahl had six husbands:

# Actor Lex Barker. They met in the early 1950s, wed on April 16, 1951, and divorced the following year (Barker later married Lana Turner).
# Actor Fernando Lamas. They married in 1954. In 1958, Dahl and Lamas had their only child, Lorenzo Lamas. Shortly after giving birth to Lorenzo, Dahl slowed and eventually ended her career as an actress, although she still appeared in films and on television occasionally. Dahl and Lamas divorced in 1960.
# Heir to the Fleischmann yeast fortune and oilman Christian R. Holmes. They married on October 15, 1960, and had one child, Dahl&#x27;s only daughter, Christina Carole Holmes. She and Holmes were divorced November 29, 1963.
# Russian wine writer and entrepreneur Alexis Lichine. They were married from 1964 to 1969.
# TV producer-cum-yacht broker Rounsevelle W. &quot;Skip&quot; Schaum. They were married from 1969 to 1976. Her second son, Rounsevelle Andreas Schaum, was born during this marriage.
# Packaging designer Marc Rosen. They were married from 1984 until her death. She divided her time between New York City and West Palm Beach, Florida.

She has nine grandchildren (including AJ Lamas and Shayne Lamas) and two great-grandchildren.

She died in her Manhattan apartment on November 29, 2021, at the age of 96.

<text>Cosmopolis XXI was a late 2000s Russian concept launch vehicle billed as a space tourism vehicle, similar to Mojave Aerospace&#x27;s Tier One program. Designed and built by the Myasishchev Design Bureau, it would use the M-55X launch aircraft (derived from Myasishchev M-55), and the proposed C-21 spaceplane or its successor the Explorer. It would be a TSTSO (Two-Stage to SubOrbit) launch platform.

The Explorer spaceplane is a suborbital tourist spaceplane based on the C-21 design. The plane was being developed by Space Adventures with the Russian Federal Space Agency and was intended to carry 3 passengers. It is to be air-launched by carrier aircraft from a Space Adventures spaceport. Space Adventures abandoned the Explorer project in 2010 because &quot;it got too expensive.&quot; It is unclear if Russia continues its development.

<text>Jennifer Paige Scoggins (born September 3, 1973) is an American singer. She is best known for her international number-one pop hit &quot;Crush&quot; and another singles &quot;Sober&quot;, &quot;Always You&quot; and &quot;Ta Voix (The Calling)&quot; in duet with french singer Lââm.

== Career ==

=== &quot;Jennifer Paige&quot; ===
Jennifer&#x27;s career as a Billboard 100 pop singer began with her first single, &quot;Crush&quot;. The song, written by Andy Goldmark, Mark Mueller and Cosgrove &amp; Clark was initially played by KIIS-FM in Los Angeles in April 1998 and went on to be the most-requested song on the radio station that summer. It became a number 3 Billboard chart hit in the U.S., logged 17 weeks in Billboard magazine&#x27;s Top 10. &quot;Crush&quot; also topped the charts in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in the United Kingdom.

Her debut album, &quot;Jennifer Paige&quot;, was released in August 1998, and consisted of guitar-driven mid-tempo songs. Critics took notice of her voice. &quot;Crush&quot; was followed by two other singles, &quot;Sober&quot; and &quot;Always You&quot;, the latter reaching #6 on the Billboard Dance Chart.

In the summer of 2000, Paige recorded a new song for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Autumn in New York&quot;, called &quot;Beautiful&quot;.

=== &quot;Positively Somewhere&quot; and &quot;Flowers: The Jennifer Paige Hits Collection&quot; ===
Paige toured the world, sang at the Vatican (though Pope John Paul II was not present), and performed at the World Music Awards. Her second album, &quot;Positively Somewhere&quot;, was anchored by the single &quot;These Days&quot;, and was released in September 2001 in United States. The European release launched a modest hit, &quot;Stranded&quot;. &quot;Positively Somewhere&quot; cracked the Top 10 in Japan and both singles became radio hits across Asia.

In October 2003, Paige confirmed she was no longer with either Hollywood Records or Edel Records. Edel released &quot;Flowers: The Jennifer Paige Hits Collection&quot; as a result of her parting ways with the label. Paige continued writing for other artists, and compiling songs for a new studio effort.

=== Later works ===
In April 2006, &quot;The Calling&quot;, was chosen by Lifetime Television for their made-for-TV movie, &quot;Augusta, Gone&quot;, based on the book of the same name. The song was written by Paige and co-writer/producer Chris Landon of Loudnoize Entertainment.

In 2008, the song name &quot;Ta Voix (The Calling)&quot; in duet with french singer Lââm top the french charts.

In 2015, she released &quot;Is It Ever Enough&quot; on her YouTube channel. In the same time, she launched a fundraising campaign to produce her upcoming album &quot;Starflower&quot; through Kickstarter. In December 2016, her song &quot;Let Me Love You&quot;, was included in the compilation &quot;Nashville Indie Spotlight 2017&quot;.
The album was released on March 31, 2017, while the lead single The Devil&#x27;s in the Details was released on February 17, 2017.

== Influences ==
Paige has said that she has been influenced by singers such as Annie Lennox, Mariah Carey, Sade, George Michael and Etta James.

<text>Glen Gould (born June 6, 1971) is an Indigenous Canadian actor, director and producer of Miꞌkmaq and Italian descent. Between 2016 and 2020, he played the role of detective Jerry Commanda on the television series &quot;Cardinal&quot;.

==Career==
Gould began performing professionally in Tomson Highway&#x27;s theatrical troupe, Native Earth Performing Arts (to which Billy Merasty had referred him), and in Theatre New Brunswick; however, his career went on hiatus in 1992 when his parents were killed in a car accident.

Gould resumed performing in 1994, and has subsequently appeared in many Canadian television programs, including &quot;Cashing In&quot;, &quot;Blackstone&quot;, &quot;North of 60&quot;, &quot;Cardinal&quot; and &quot;Tribal&quot;, and films, including &quot;The Colony&quot;, &quot;File Under Miscellaneous&quot;, &quot;Rhymes for Young Ghouls&quot;, &quot;North Mountain&quot;, &quot;Monkey Beach&quot;, &quot;Girl&quot; and &quot;Bones of Crows&quot;.

==Family==
Gould&#x27;s uncle was Donald Marshall Jr., whose wrongful conviction for murder occurred the day before Gould&#x27;s birth: Gould&#x27;s pregnant mother was so shocked by the verdict that she went into labour with him. His first acting role was a minor part in the 1989 film adaptation of Michael Harris&#x27;s 1986 book &quot;Justice Denied&quot;, which explored the events leading to Marshall&#x27;s conviction.

<doc id="1050113" wikidata="Q751475" url="?curid=1050113" title="Buncrana">
<text>Buncrana ( ; ) is a town in Inishowen in the north of County Donegal in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland. The town sits on the eastern shores of Lough Swilly, being northwest of Derry and north of Letterkenny. In the 2022 census, the population was 6,971, making it the second most populous town in County Donegal, after Letterkenny, and the largest in Inishowen.

Buncrana is the historic home of the &quot;Ó Dochartaigh&quot; (O&#x27;Doherty) clan and originally developed as a town around the defensive tower known as O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s Keep, at the mouth of the River Crana. The town was moved to its present location, just south of the River Crana, when George Vaughan had the current Main Street laid out in 1718.

The town was a major centre for the textile industry in County Donegal from the 19th century until the mid-2000s (decade).

==History==
===O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s Keep===
On the northern bank of the River Crana as it enters Lough Swilly sits the three-storey O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s Keep, which is the only surviving part of an original 14th-century Norman castle. The first two levels of the keep were built after 1333. In 1601 the O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s Keep was described as being a small, two-storey castle, inhabited by Conor McGarret O&#x27;Doherty. In 1602 the third level was added and it was upgraded by Hugh Boy O&#x27;Doherty as an intended base for Spanish military aid that hoped to land at Inch.

The keep was burned by Crown forces in 1608 in reprisal for the rebellion of Sir Cahir O&#x27;Doherty, who had sacked and razed the city of Derry. After Sir Cahir O&#x27;Doherty was killed at the Battle of Kilmacrennan, he was attaindered and his land seized. The keep was granted to Sir Arthur Chichester, who then leased it to Englishman Henry Vaughan, where it was repaired and lived in by the Vaughan family until 1718.

In 1718, Buncrana Castle was built by George Vaughan, it was one of the first big manor houses built in Inishowen, and stone was taken from the bawn, or defensive wall, surrounding O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s Keep to build it. It was erected on the original site of Buncrana, which had grown up in the shadow of the keep. Vaughan moved the town to its present location, where he founded the current main street and built the Castle Bridge (a six-arched stone single lane bridge) across the River Crana leading to his Castle.

During the 1798 Rebellion, Theobald Wolfe Tone was held in Buncrana Castle when he was captured after the British/French naval battle off the coast of Donegal, before being taken to Derry and then subsequently to Dublin. On 18 May 1812, Isaac Todd bought the entire town of Buncrana, also the townlands of Tullydish, Adaravan and Ballymacarry, at the Court of Chancery on behalf of the trustees of the Marquess of Donegall. His nephews inherited the castles, and they later became known as the Thornton-Todds. The castle remains as a private home today. In the forecourt there is a memorial rock in honour of Sir Cahir O&#x27;Doherty, and a plaque dedicated to Wolfe Tone.

One of the oldest remaining inhabited residences in Buncrana is a Georgian property called Westbrook House, situated at the entrance to Swan Park just north of the town centre of Buncrana. The house was built in 1807 by Judge Wilson, who also built the single-arch stone bridge (referred to as Wilson&#x27;s Bridge) leading to the house and the entrance to Swan Park.

=== 19th century ===

The town was often the focal point for unrest in the surrounding areas as rural peasants protested against evictions and rent increases. In 1834, unrest broke out when local residents tried to expel various landlord agents from the area. The names of individual agents were posted on the church doors in Buncrana by a &quot;Captain Wright&quot; warning that the agents risked death if they continued to live in the area. The unrest forced the administration in Dublin Castle to station troops in the towns of Buncrana, Clonmany and Carndonagh.

Communal relations between Protestant and Catholic communities were tense and on occasions led to violence. In November 1833, communal tensions broke out. The houses of local Protestants were attacked and the windows of their houses were smashed.

During the second half of the 19th century, the town developed a significant tourism industry. Tourists, particularly from Derry, were able to access the town through the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway.

===20th century===

In October 1905, Buncrana was the first town in County Donegal to receive electricity. It was generated at Swan Mill which continued to provide electricity for the town until September 1954 when Buncrana was brought under the ESB Rural Electrification Scheme.

In the beginning of 1910 Joseph Cordner successfully tested on the shore near Buncrana the first in the world aircraft with jet flaps, Cordner monoplane 1.

On 30 July 1922, during the Irish Civil War, Buncrana was captured by the Free State forces from Republican forces without the loss of life. The Free State forces held the railway station, telephone and telegraph offices and all the roads entering the town. At 4:00am a sentry stopped a car on the outskirts of the town and on discovering it contained the Republican commander, with five armed volunteers, arrested them. At around 7:00am the Republican forces&#x27; position was surrounded and were given fifteen minutes to surrender. They complied, were arrested and their weapons and ammunition seized. Later that day, 100 Free State troops commandeered a train at Buncrana station and proceeded to take Clonmany, Carndonagh and other locations on the peninsula.

Buncrana was the object of public attention in 1972, when after Operation Motorman it became the place of refuge for many Provisional Irish Republican Army members from Derry. In 1991, a local Sinn Féin councillor, Eddie Fullerton, was murdered by Loyalist paramilitaries from the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). In a documentary that aired a month later, it was alleged that members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary had leaked a classified intelligence file related to Fullerton to UDA paramilitaries, which allegedly resulted in his murder.

In March 2016, Buncrana again came to public attention when five people of the same family died after their car slipped off Buncrana Pier into the waters of Lough Swilly. Only a 4-month-old baby girl survived when the driver, Sean McGrotty, passed his daughter through a window to a passer-by who swam out to help. On 23 November 2017 an inquest found that McGrotty died by &#x27;misadventure&#x27;, as the post-mortem results showed that he was more than three times over the drink drive limit.

==Politics==
===Local===
Buncrana Town Council was the Local Authority for the town and provided an extensive range of services in the area. These services ranged from planning control, the provision of social housing, the upkeep and improvement of roads, and the maintenance of parks, beaches and public open spaces. The Town Council was abolished in June 2014 when the Local Government Reform Act 2014 was implemented. Its functions were taken over by Donegal County Council in 2014. Buncrana is in the Inishowen Municipal District, which elects councillors to Donegal County Council.

===National===
Buncrana is part of the Donegal (Dáil constituency) since 2016. Previously it was part of the Donegal North-East constituency of Dáil Éireann.

==Geography==

Buncrana is located on the eastern shore of Lough Swilly in north County Donegal. The main urban area of the town is situated between the Crana River to the north and the Mill River to the south. The principal street follows a rough north–south route and is divided into Upper and Lower Main Street by Market Square. The Main Street has a one-way traffic system. The River Crana is crossed by four bridges: Castle Bridge (which gives vehicular access to Buncrana Castle and pedestrian access to Swan Park), Westbrook Bridge (officially, Wilson&#x27;s Bridge), the new Cockhill Bridge (officially opened in 2018) and the old Cockhill Bridge (now a pedestrian bridge). The Mill River, south of the town, is crossed by two bridges: Victoria Bridge (known locally as the Iron Bridge) which is the main point of access to the town and the Mill Bridge which is at the end of the Mill Brae road at the south end of the town.

===Geology===
The underlying bedrock includes Fahan slate formation. The river valley of the Mill River flows over a narrow band of Culdaff limestone with a sill of metadolerite along the river&#x27;s southern embankment extending from the estuarine zone inland. Sandy gravels and conglomerates overlie bedrock. The geology was formed during the Lower Carboniferous Period. The local soils throughout the area range from shallow to moderate depth peaty podzols and established podzolic types with a moderate percentage of loam and sandy clays.

===Climate===
Buncrana, like the rest of Ireland, has a temperate oceanic climate, or &quot;Cfb&quot; on the Köppen climate classification system, characterised by cool summers and mild winters. Ireland&#x27;s position in the Atlantic Ocean means that its climate is strongly influenced by the Gulf Stream, which keeps it a few degrees warmer than other locations at the same latitude.

These are the average temperature and rainfall figures between 1961 and 1990 taken at the Met Éireann weather station at Malin Head, about northwest of Buncrana:
===Transport===
Buncrana railway station opened on 9 September 1864, was closed for passenger traffic on 6 September 1948, and finally closed altogether on 10 August 1953.

The nearest railway station is operated by NI Railways and runs from Derry~Londonderry railway station via Coleraine to Belfast Lanyon Place and Belfast Grand Central station. The strategically important Belfast-Derry railway line is to be upgraded to facilitate more frequent trains and improvements to the permanent way such as track and signalling to enable faster services.

Buncrana is connected to the rest of the national road network via a regional road, the R238. This connects it to the N13, the national primary road that connects Letterkenny and Derry (it becomes the A2 when it crosses the border). The town is considered the gateway to Inishowen and lies on the &quot;Inishowen 100&quot;, an approximate 100-mile route around the peninsula that passes various scenic sites.

TFI Local Link routes 242 , 252 , 995 and 995A all service the town.

Local bus company McGonagle Bus and Coach operates an hourly bus service from Derry to Buncrana and vice versa. The company took over the route from Lough Swilly Buses in April 2014 after Lough Swilly ceased trading. The buses run every hour at ten minutes past the Hour, each way. The two routes serving the town are 951 and 956 

==Demography==

The results of the 2022 census put the population of Buncrana at 6,971, its historical highest.

At the same census, the town had 2,603 private households, 27.6% were made up of one person living alone, 15.8% were couples without children, 30.3% were couples with children, 12.6% were lone-parent families and 13.7% were classified under other categories. 3,403 were males and 3,568 females.

Around 81.7% of residents were recorded as Catholic, 5.0% were of another stated religion (e.g. Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, Orthodox or Islam). The percentage of residents with no religion was 9.2%.

27.6% of the town&#x27;s residents were &#x27;foreign-born&#x27;.

Of people aged 3 and over, 31.0% could speak Irish.

The percentage of people over the age of 15 whose full-time education had ceased who possessed a third-level degree (NFQ level 7 or higher) was 26.0%.

==Tourism==

Buncrana has a relatively strong tourism industry, and it is one of the most popular holiday destinations in the northwest of Ireland. This is possibly due to its close proximity to Derry, and also for its wide range of retail stores. It also has well-developed tourist facilities, and it serves as the main town on the Inishowen peninsula, which also helps with sustaining the tourism industry in the town.

Lisfannon beach, a Blue Flag beach, sits on the shores of Lough Swilly just south of the town, and is an important recreational beach that is popular with locals and day-trippers from Derry.
==Sport==
Buncrana is home to many sports clubs, including clubs for soccer, Gaelic football and hurling, athletics and watersports. Football clubs based around Buncrana include Buncrana Hearts F.C., Cockhill Celtic F.C. and Illies Celtic. Buncrana Hearts and Illies Celtic play in the Inishowen Football League and Cockhill Celtic play in the Ulster Senior League.

Gaelic Football is also a popular sport in Buncrana, and the club caters for teams from Under-8 level right up to Senior level. They play their home games at the Scarvey, the team is very successful underage, winning at least two Inishowen titles the last few seasons and winning four county championships since 2000, reaching under-14 final for the past two seasons as well as the under 15s last season.

Buncrana Golf Club has the oldest 9-hole links course in Ireland.

==Culture==
Three buildings in Buncrana are recorded on the Record of Protected Structures, namely the Drift Inn (formerly Buncrana Railway Station), Buncrana Castle and Swan Mill.

===Music===
Buncrana&#x27;s music scene is served by a number of local pubs and bars, which have live music several nights of the week. The annual Buncrana Music &amp; Arts Festival takes place every 23 July in the town.

The Buncrana Music and Arts Festival returned to the town in 2010, after a five-year absence. The festival included successful performances from The Coronas, The Undertones and Altan. It has recurred each year since.

===Media===
The two main local newspapers that serve the Inishowen area, the &quot;Inish Times&quot; and the &quot;Inishowen Independent&quot;, have their offices in Buncrana. Local issues in the town and peninsula are also covered in the &quot;Derry Journal&quot;. The local radio station is Highland Radio and it is based in Letterkenny.

Buncrana receives all the Irish national television and radio stations from the Saorview television network from the local Fanad television transmitter. Due to its close proximity to Derry, before the 2012 digital switchover, the town could receive the five main UK television channels from the Derry or Limavady television transmitters from the mid-1950s.

==Community==

===Tidy Towns===
In 2012, Buncrana won a silver medal in the national Tidy Towns Competition. The work of the Buncrana Lighthouse Restoration Project was also recognised when they received a Heritage Award.

===Youth facilities===
Buncrana Youth Club is open seven days a week and provides various services such as arts, sports, drama, music and computers. It also operates summer camps and provides coaching, personal development and peer education.

Buncrana Youth Drop in is located in the Plaza theatre on the Main Street and is usually open from 7pm til 10pm and provides a safe place for young people with such facilities as a pool table, internet access, TV, gaming consoles and a small shop. It also runs workshops and other youth projects.

Buncrana Youth Club and Buncrana Drop in are both affiliated with Donegal Youth Service.

BreakOUT is a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) youth organisation in County Donegal that has a local group in Buncrana. The group is open to ages from 14 to 23. The group has run various projects to promote LGBT causes in Buncrana. In 2011, positive slogans to combat homophobia were drawn on the Main Street footpath. The group meets at the Inishowen Development Partnership building on Saturdays from 7pm to 9pm.

==Education==
Buncrana is served by three secondary schools: Crana College, a vocational school managed by the Donegal Education and Training Board and Scoil Mhuire, Buncrana, a voluntary secondary school under the trusteeship of CEIST (Catholic Education Irish Schools Trust) and Coláiste Chineal Eoghain (an Irish language secondary school (Meanscoil) in Tullyarvan Mill). Crana College was set up in 1925, Scoil Mhuire in 1933 and Coláiste Chineál Eoghain in 2007. As of September 2011, Crana College had 540 registered students, while Scoil Mhuire had around 700.

<text>Konstantin Ramul (30 May 1879 – 11 February 1975) was an Estonian professor of psychology and longtime chair of psychology at the University of Tartu. He is best known for his work on the history of experimental psychology.

Ramul believed that history is dependent upon psychology, though the philosopher of science Ernest Nagel criticized him for &quot;not stat[ing] clearly the type of psychological investigation which is relevant to the historian&#x27;s task&quot; (Nagel 1934, pp. 599–600).

<text>Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison is the first live album by American singer-songwriter Johnny Cash, released on Columbia Records on May 6, 1968. It comprises recordings of performances by Cash and his band at Folsom State Prison, California, on January 13, 1968.

After his 1955 song &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;, Cash had been interested in recording a performance at a prison. His idea was put on hold until 1967, when personnel changes at Columbia Records put Bob Johnston in charge of producing Cash&#x27;s material. Cash had controlled his drug abuse problems, and was looking to turn his career around after several years of limited success. Backed by June Carter, Carl Perkins, and the Tennessee Three, Cash performed two shows at Folsom State Prison.

Despite little initial promotion by Columbia, &quot;Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison&quot; reached number one on the US Top Country Charts and the top 15 of the national album chart. The lead single, a performance of &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;, was Cash&#x27;s first top-40 hit since 1964&#x27;s &quot;Understand Your Man&quot;. &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; received positive reviews and revitalized Cash&#x27;s career. At the 11th Annual Grammy Awards in 1969, it won for Best Album Notes, and &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; won for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male. 

Cash recorded three more live albums in prisons: &quot;At San Quentin&quot; (1969), &quot;På Österåker&quot; (1973) and &quot;A Concert Behind Prison Walls&quot; (1976). &quot;Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison&quot; was rereleased with additional tracks in 1999, and again in 2018 for Record Store Day. It was certified triple platinum in 2003 for US sales exceeding 3.4 million. It has been cited by numerous critics as one of the greatest albums, and was included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. 

==Background==
Johnny Cash became interested in Folsom State Prison, California, while serving in the United States Air Force Security Service. In 1953, his unit watched Crane Wilbur&#x27;s 1951 film &quot;Inside the Walls of Folsom Prison&quot;. The film inspired Cash to write a song that reflected his perception of prison life. The result was &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;, Cash&#x27;s second single on Sun Records. The song became popular among inmates, who would write to Cash, requesting him to perform at their prisons. Cash&#x27;s first prison performance was at Huntsville State Prison in 1957. Satisfied by the favorable reception, he performed at several other prisons in the years leading up to the Folsom performance in 1968.

A few years after attaining commercial success from songs such as &quot;I Walk the Line&quot;, &quot;Understand Your Man&quot;, and &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, Cash&#x27;s popularity waned, in part due to his increasing dependence on drugs. In 1967, Cash sought help for his escalating drug problems, and by the end of the year, began to get clean and try to turn his career around. Concurrently, the country portion of Columbia Records underwent major personnel changes, where Frank Jones and Don Law, who had produced several of Cash&#x27;s albums, were ousted in favor of Bob Johnston, who was known for his erratic behavior and willingness to disagree with studio executives. Cash saw this as an opportunity to pitch his idea of recording a live album at a prison, which Johnston enthusiastically supported. Johnston called San Quentin State Prison and Folsom, with Folsom being the first to respond.

==Recording==

On January 10, 1968, Cash and the singer June Carter checked into the El Rancho Motel in Sacramento, California. They were later accompanied by the Tennessee Three, Carl Perkins, the Statler Brothers, Johnny&#x27;s father Ray Cash, Reverend Floyd Gressett, pastor of Avenue Community Church in Ventura, California (where Cash often attended services), who counseled inmates at Folsom and helped facilitate the concert, and producer Johnston. The performers rehearsed for two days, an uncommon occurrence for them, sometimes with two or more songs rehearsed concurrently by various combinations of musicians. 

During the rehearsals on January 12, California governor Ronald Reagan, who was at the hotel for an after-dinner speech, visited the band and offered his encouragement. One focus of the sessions was to learn &quot;Greystone Chapel&quot;, a song written by inmate Glen Sherley. Sherley recorded a version of the song, which he passed on to Rev. Gressett via the prison&#x27;s recreation director. On January 13, the group traveled to Folsom, meeting &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Robert Hilburn and Columbia photographer Jim Marshall, who were hired to document the album for the liner notes.

Cash decided to hold two performances on January 13, one at 9:40 am and one at 12:40 pm, in case the first performance was unsatisfactory. After an introduction by MC Hugh Cherry, who encouraged the prisoners to &quot;respond&quot; to Cash&#x27;s performance, Carl Perkins took the stage and performed his hit song &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;. Following this song, the Statler Brothers sang their hit &quot;Flowers on the Wall&quot; and the country standard &quot;This Old House&quot;. Cherry returned to the stage and instructed the inmates not to cheer for Cash until he introduced himself; they obliged. Waiting for the introduction would be the start of the Cash biopic &quot;Walk The Line&quot; which was released in 2005.

Cash opened both shows with a rendition of &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;, followed by many songs about prison, including &quot;The Wall&quot;, &quot;Green, Green Grass of Home&quot;, and the gallows humor song &quot;25 Minutes to Go&quot;. Cash also included other songs of despair, such as the Merle Travis song &quot;Dark as a Dungeon&quot;. Following &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot;, Cash included a few &quot;slow, ballad-type songs&quot;, including &quot;Send a Picture of Mother&quot; and &quot;The Long Black Veil&quot;, followed by three novelty songs from his album &quot;Everybody Loves a Nut&quot;: &quot;Dirty Old Egg-Sucking Dog&quot;, &quot;Flushed from the Bathroom of Your Heart&quot;, and &quot;Joe Bean&quot;. June Carter joined Cash to perform a pair of duets. After a seven-minute version of a song from his &quot;Blood, Sweat and Tears&quot; album, &quot;The Legend of John Henry&#x27;s Hammer&quot;, Cash took a break and Carter recited a poem. Cash ended both concerts with Sherley&#x27;s &quot;Greystone Chapel&quot;. The second concert was not as fruitful as the first; the musicians were fatigued from the earlier show. Only two songs from the second concert, &quot;Give My Love to Rose&quot; and &quot;I Got Stripes&quot;, made it onto the LP release.


==Reception==
The album release of &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; was prepared in four months. Despite the recent success of &quot;Rosanna&#x27;s Going Wild&quot;, a Cash single released just before the Folsom concerts that reached number two on the Top Country Charts, Columbia initially invested little in the album or its single &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;. This was due partially to Columbia&#x27;s focusing its promotional efforts on pop stars rather than country artists. Nevertheless, the single charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on May 25, 1968, and entered the Top Country Charts a week later. 

After Sirhan Sirhan assassinated Senator Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968, radio stations ceased playing the single due to the line: &quot;I shot a man in Reno / Just to watch him die&quot;. Columbia demanded Johnston remix the single with the line removed. Despite protests from Cash, the single was edited and re-released. The new version reached number one on the Top Country Chart and the top forty on the national charts. The single prompted the album to climb the album charts, eventually reaching number one on the Top Country Albums chart and number thirteen on the Pop Albums chart—the forerunner to the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. By August 1968, &quot;Folsom&quot; had shipped over 300,000 copies; two months later it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping over 500,000.

&quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; received rave reviews. Al Aronowitz of &quot;Life&quot; stated Cash sang the songs like &quot;someone who has grown up believing he is one of the people that these songs are about&quot;. For &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Ann Fisher wrote that &quot;every cut is special in its own way&quot; and Richard Goldstein said the album was &quot;filled with the kind of emotionalism you seldom find in rock&quot;. Fredrick E. Danker of &quot;Sing Out!&quot; praised it as &quot;an album structured an aural experience for us&quot;. At the 11th Annual Grammy Awards in 1969, &quot;Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison&quot; won the award for Best Album Notes and &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; won for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male.

== Legacy ==

The success revitalized Cash&#x27;s career; according to Cash, &quot;That&#x27;s where things really got started for me again.&quot; Sun Records re-dubbed Cash&#x27;s previous B-side &quot;Get Rhythm&quot; with applause similar to Folsom&#x27;s, and it became successful enough to enter the Hot 100. Cash returned to the prison scene in 1969 when he recorded &quot;At San Quentin&quot; at San Quentin State Prison. &quot;At San Quentin&quot; became Cash&#x27;s first album to reach number one on the pop chart and produced the number-two hit &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot;. The ensuing popularity from the Folsom concert also prompted ABC to give Cash his own television show.

The album was re-released on October 19, 1999, with three extra tracks excluded from the original LP: &quot;Busted&quot;, &quot;Joe Bean&quot;, and &quot;The Legend of John Henry&#x27;s Hammer&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised the new version, calling it &quot;the ideal blend of mythmaking and gritty reality.&quot; On May 27, 2003, &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; was certified triple platinum by the RIAA for shipping over three million units. 

&quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; has been cited as one of the greatest albums by several sources. In 2003, it was ranked number 88 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, ranking at number 164 in a 2020 revised list. Also in 2003, it was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. Country Music Television named it the third greatest album in country music in 2006. &quot;Blender&quot; listed the album as the 63rd greatest American album of all time and as one of the &quot;500 CDs You Must Own&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Time&quot; listed it among the 100 greatest albums. Both &quot;Far Out&quot; and &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked it as the best live album of all time. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

In 2008, Columbia and Legacy Records reissued &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; in an expanded edition with both concerts uncut and remastered. It includes a DVD produced by Bestor Cram and Michael Streissguth of Northern Light Productions, with pictures and interviews. &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; praised the reissue, saying it had &quot;the force of empathic endeavors, as if [Cash] were doing penance for his notorious bad habits&quot;. Christian Hoard wrote for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that the reissue &quot;makes for an excellent historical document, highlighting Cash&#x27;s rapport with prison folk&quot;. In 2018, &quot;Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison&quot; on Columbia Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1050123" wikidata="Q1903309" url="?curid=1050123" title="Martin X-23 PRIME">
<text>The Martin X-23A PRIME (Precision Reentry Including Maneuvering reEntry) (SV-5D) is a small lifting-body re-entry vehicle tested by the United States Air Force in the mid-1960s. Unlike ASSET, primarily used for structural and heating research, the X-23A PRIME was developed to study the effects of maneuvering during re-entry of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, including cross-range maneuvers up to from the ballistic track.

== Design ==
Each X-23A was constructed from titanium, beryllium, stainless steel, and aluminum. The craft consisted of two sections—the aft main structure and a removable forward &quot;glove section&quot;. The structure was completely covered with a Martin-developed ablative heat shield thick, and the nose cap was constructed of carbon phenolic material.

Aerodynamic control was provided by a pair of lower flaps, and fixed upper flaps and rudders. A nitrogen-gas reaction control system was used outside the atmosphere. At Mach 2 a drogue ballute deployed and slowed the vehicle&#x27;s descent. As it deployed, its cable sliced the upper structure of the main equipment bay, allowing a recovery chute to deploy. It would then be recovered in midair by a specially-equipped JC-130B Hercules aircraft.

== Flight testing ==
The first PRIME vehicle was launched from Vandenberg AFB on 21 December 1966 atop an Atlas SLV-3 launch vehicle. This mission simulated a low Earth orbit reentry with a zero cross-range. The ballute deployed at , though the recovery parachute failed to completely deploy. The vehicle crashed into the Pacific Ocean.

The second vehicle was launched on 5 March 1967. This flight simulated a 654-mile (1053-kilometre) cross-range reentry, and banking at hypersonic speeds. The recovery parachute deployed properly and was located by two of the deployed recovery aircraft. During an inspection fly-by of the descending parachute system it was seen that reefing cutters had failed to actuate. These cutters are on the harness suspending the vehicle from the parachute to ensure stability of the vehicle behind the JC-130B recovery aircraft during reel-in, and permit safely boarding the vehicle. As a result, the parachute and vehicle were allowed to descend to the sea. Subsequently, the vehicle separated from its flotation &quot;balloon&quot; in the rough seas and, with the parachute, sank before a nearby ship could arrive to retrieve it from the ocean.

The final PRIME mission was flown on 19 April 1967, and simulated re-entry from low Earth orbit with a cross-range. This time, all systems performed perfectly, and the X-23A was successfully recovered. An inspection by a USAF-Martin team reported the craft &quot;ready to fly again&quot;, although no later missions were carried out. The third X-23A is now on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

<text>In mathematics, Laver tables (named after Richard Laver, who discovered them towards the end of the 1980s in connection with his works on set theory) are tables of numbers that have certain properties of algebraic and combinatorial interest. They occur in the study of racks and quandles.

== Definition ==

For any nonnegative integer &quot;n&quot;, the &quot;n&quot;-th &quot;Laver table&quot; is the 2&quot;n&quot; × 2&quot;n&quot; table whose entry in the cell at row &quot;p&quot; and column &quot;q&quot; (1 ≤ &quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot; ≤ 2&quot;n&quot;) is defined as

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the unique binary operation that satisfies the following two equations for all &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot; in {1...,2&quot;n&quot;}:

and 

Note: Equation () uses the notation formula_3 to mean the unique member of {1...,2&quot;n&quot;} congruent to &quot;x&quot; modulo 2&quot;n&quot;.

Equation () is known as the &quot;(left) self-distributive law&quot;, and a set endowed with &quot;any&quot; binary operation satisfying this law is called a shelf. Thus, the &quot;n&quot;-th Laver table is just the multiplication table for the unique shelf ({1...,2&quot;n&quot;}, formula_2) that satisfies Equation ().

Examples: Following are the first five Laver tables, i.e. the multiplication tables for the shelves ({1...,2&quot;n&quot;}, formula_2), &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4:









There is no known closed-form expression to calculate the entries of a Laver table directly, but Patrick Dehornoy provides a simple algorithm for filling out Laver tables.

== Properties ==

# For all &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot; in {1...,2&quot;n&quot;}: formula_6.
# For all &quot;p&quot; in {1...,2&quot;n&quot;}: formula_7 is periodic with period πn(p) equal to a power of two.
# For all &quot;p&quot; in {1...,2&quot;n&quot;}: formula_8 is strictly increasing from formula_9 to formula_10.
# For all &quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;: formula_11

== Are the first-row periods unbounded? ==

Looking at just the first row in the &quot;n&quot;-th Laver table, for &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, ..., the entries in each first row are seen to be periodic with a period that&#x27;s always a power of two, as mentioned in Property 2 above. The first few periods are 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 16, 16, ... . This sequence is nondecreasing, and in 1995 Richard Laver proved, &quot;under the assumption that there exists a rank-into-rank (a large cardinal property)&quot;, that it actually increases without bound. (It is not known whether this is also provable in ZFC without the additional large-cardinal axiom.) In any case, it grows extremely slowly; Randall Dougherty showed that 32 cannot appear in this sequence (if it ever does) until &quot;n&quot; &gt; A(9, A(8, A(8, 254))), where A denotes the Ackermann–Péter function.

<text>The Eastern Freeway is an urban freeway in eastern Melbourne, the state capital of Victoria, Australia. It is one of the most important freeways in terms of commuting to the city, connecting Alexandra Parade and Hoddle Street in the inner suburbs, with EastLink tollway farther east. It consists of between three and six lanes (including the Hard Shoulder Running lane during peak periods) in each direction, also an inbound transit lane reserved for vehicles with two or more occupants during peak hours.

It is continually the widest freeway in Melbourne, with 12 lanes altogether near the Hoddle Street and Alexandra Parade end.

==Route==

The Eastern Freeway starts at its junction with Hoddle Street, as an eastern continuation of Alexandra Parade, with six lanes eastbound and three lanes westbound. Three more lanes (that provide an exit to Hoddle Street) join the westbound carriageway after it leaves the junction, and after a short distance both directions narrow from six to five lanes in each direction. The freeway narrows again to four lanes in each direction near Chandler Highway and Yarra Bend.

The freeway narrows once more to three lanes just before Bulleen Road, and features a concrete barrier rather than the grassy median that was designed to carry a railway. There is a short four lane section between Tram and Blackburn Roads, then three lanes to the end at Springvale Road, and connects to the EastLink toll road to Ringwood and Frankston. The freeway was unique in that it did not connect to any other freeway prior to EastLink being built.

The travel time on the Eastern Freeway in each direction is 13 minutes: 5 minutes between Springvale Road and Doncaster Road, and 8 minutes between Doncaster Road and Hoddle Street). In peak period, travel time is between 16–26 minutes. However, during times of extreme congestion, including residual from an incident, the travel time can go well beyond half an hour.

The entire freeway has a speed limit. There are no fixed speed cameras, however Victoria Police regularly patrol the full length of the freeway to enforce the speed limit. VicRoads also operates a network of CCTV cameras across the entire length of the freeway and abnormal traffic movements by vehicles are reported to Victoria Police.

==History==
Construction started on the first section of freeway between Hoddle Street, Clifton Hill and Bulleen Road Balwyn North in 1971 by the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (MMBW), but the project and its construction was transferred to be under the direct responsibility of the Country Roads Board on 1 July 1974; the section was opened in 1977. The central reservation was designed to be wide enough to cater for a proposed Doncaster railway line between Hoddle Street and Bulleen Road, bridges over it deliberately kept free of support pylons to allow for it. The bridges were designed by Melbourne engineer Bruce Day, with particular attention paid to the aesthetics of each bridge so that they fitted in their landscape, were related to one another, and also provided a variety and progression of design themes. Land was also reserved from Bulleen Road to Doncaster East to extend the proposed railway line, but the plan fell out of favour in the 1980s and the land was sold. The freeway was extended further south-east through Balwyn North from Bulleen Road to Doncaster Road and opened in 1982, with a major part being the undergrounding of 2.4 km of Koonung Creek in a precast reinforced concrete conduit to allow more room for the freeway. The freeway was extended for the last time to Donvale in December 1997.

The Eastern Freeway was signed as Freeway Route 83 between Alexandra Parade and Bulleen Road upon opening in 1977, then extended eastward to Doncaster Road when that section of freeway was opened in 1982; this was replaced by State Route 83 in 1989, itself extended eastward to Donvale when that section of freeway was opened in 1997. With Victoria&#x27;s conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in the late 1990s, it was replaced by route M3 when EastLink opened in 2008.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: in 2004, VicRoads re-declared Eastern Freeway (Freeway #1830) from Gold Street in Collingwood to Springvale Road in Donvale.

===Timeline of construction===
*1977 – Initial stage, 9 km from Alexandra Parade to Bulleen Road, opened December 1977 in three stages: Hoddle Street to Chandler Highway; Chandler Highway to Burke Road; Burke Road to Bulleen Road; total cost (including associated works in Hoddle Street) of A$84 million.
*1982 – Second stage, extended 3km from Bulleen Road to Doncaster Road, opened 3 June 1982, by Minister for Transport, the Hon S M Crabb MP. Two lanes in each direction, plus emergency stopping lanes, at a cost of $24 million.
*1997 – Third stage, extended 7km from Doncaster Road to Springvale Road, opened December 1997, at a cost of $250 million. The sound barriers built in Stage 3 designed by architects Wood Marsh/Pels Innes Neilson Kosloff won the Australian Institute of Architects Victorian Architecture Medal and the national Walter Burley Griffin Award for Urban Design in 1998.
The first and second stages were controversial and met much opposition due to the first being constructed through the middle of Yarra Bend Park and the second stage to Doncaster Road through parkland now named Koonung Creek Reserve.

In recent years, amidst growing congestion problems and increased awareness of unsustainable methods of transport in Melbourne, there has been massive local council lobbying (by Melbourne, Yarra and Manningham) and public pressure placed on the State Government for the Doncaster railway line to be constructed.

One last 5km extension to the Eastern Freeway, to terminate at the intersection of Maroondah Highway and Mount Dandenong Road via the eastern half of the Ringwood Bypass in Ringwood, was planned in October 2000: this would include tunnels 1.5km in length and a connection with the planned Scoresby Freeway (later EastLink), cost $326 million, and was scheduled for completion in mid-2005. Instead, the Scoresby Freeway and the planned Eastern Freeway extension was merged into the Eastlink project, and the remainder of the Eastern Freeway reservation was built into the western half of the Ringwood Bypass, which opened in July 2008. Eastlink connected the freeway to the Monash, Mornington Peninsula and Frankston Freeways.

===1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan===
Originally designated F-19 under the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan during its construction in the early 1970s, it was supposed to be linked to the then-new Tullamarine Freeway, as well as taking traffic off the Maroondah Highway. Protests from inner Melbourne suburbs residents led to it being terminated at Hoddle Street.

===April 2020 crash===
On 22 April 2020, a drunk truck driver, Mohinder Singh, crashed his truck into a Porsche 911 and two police cars. Four police officers in the police cars were killed. The driver of the Porsche, Richard Pusey, was also drunk and was later arrested for running away from the scene and for filming the dying police officers, later pleading guilty to three charges, and was jailed for 10 months.

On 14 April 2021, truck driver Singh was sentenced to at least 22 years in prison by the Supreme Court of Victoria over the manslaughter of four police officers.

== Safety ==
Despite the inherent danger in small and large vehicles travelling at high speeds, the freeway is generally considered one of the safest in Melbourne, with minimal changes of elevation, a flowing route, ample shoulder space and well-maintained safety barriers. Long sections of the freeway suffer from low lighting levels due to its route and proximity to residential areas.

In the seven years preceding and including 2009, six people died in a section of the freeway known as the &quot;Bulleen Bend&quot;. This is the tightest bend in the freeway&#x27;s length, between the Bulleen and Doncaster Road interchanges. Despite the relatively tight bend and limit, there were few safety barriers on the extremities of the road surface, leaving nothing between the cars and the trees on the road shoulder. Flexible barriers were installed along lengths of the freeway in an attempt to improve safety. These measures reduced the relative risk of casualty crashes by approximately 75 percent.

== Widening and upgrades (North East Link) ==
The Eastern Freeway is one of the primary freeways feeding into the CBD. Despite decades of road widenings and infrastructure investment, it experiences periods of traffic congestion. In 2016, Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews announced the construction of a new tolled freeway to connect to the Eastern Freeway. Termed the North East Link, the main component of the project is two tunnels connecting the M80 Ring Road in the north-eastern suburb of Greensborough to the Eastern Freeway at Bulleen Road in Balwyn North. It is anticipated to add up to 135,000 extra vehicles to the Eastern Freeway and surrounding suburbs every day. 

One component of the project is widening the entire freeway from Hoddle Street to Springvale Road. 45 kilometres of new lanes will be added, including six &#x27;express&#x27; lanes between Middleborough Road and the Chandler Highway. In some locations east of Bulleen Road, it will be more than doubled in width from nine lanes to 20 lanes, making it one of the widest roads in the world. Construction on the first section to be upgraded between Burke Road and Tram Road will begin in 2024 with the other stages to follow in 2025. The upgrade is anticipated to be completed by 2028 to coincide with the opening of the tunnels.

== Western extension (East West Link) ==

The Eastern Freeway has no connecting freeways at its western end in Clifton Hill. As a result, traffic from the Eastern Freeway is released westward along Alexandra Parade and north–south along Hoddle Street. There have been proposals to extend the freeway further west to connect with the CityLink network and ultimately to the Western Ring Road at Sunshine West, but none have been constructed to date.

On 1 March 2007, the Victorian Government announced a study linking the major freeways conducted by international transport expert Sir Rod Eddington. The Eddington Transport Report was released in early 2008 and outlined 20 main recommendations for the city, including a tunnel from the Eastern Freeway to CityLink under Royal Park. The newly elected state Liberal government announced in 2013 that they would commence construction of the tunnel. This announcement sparked heated public debate and protests both in favour and against the proposal until the newly elected Labor government renounced the contracts signed by the previous government in 2015 and scrapped the project.

One aspect of the East West Link proposal was to widen the Eastern Freeway between Hoddle Street and Tram Road in Doncaster. While the exact details of the proposal were not released before the project was abandoned, this was opposed by residents and councils along its length.

<text>Hristo Nikolov Lukov (; 6 January 1887 in Varna – 13 February 1943 in Sofia) was a Bulgarian lieutenant-general, politician, and Minister of War, who led the nationalistic Union of Bulgarian National Legions (UBNL), an organisation largely supportive of Nazi ideology. He was assassinated in 1943 by two members of the Bulgarian resistance movement, Violeta Yakova and Ivan Burudzhiev.

== Military and political career ==
=== First World War ===
Hristo Nikolov Lukov was promoted during World War I to the rank of a major and a commander of an artillery battalion. Abroad he is incorrectly thought to be the commander of the 13th Infantry division during World War I. In fact, that was major-general Hristo Tsonev Lukov, a native of Gabrovo.

=== Interwar period ===
During the interwar period Hristo Nikolov Lukov became the commander of the Army School of Artillery, of the Training Section of the General Staff&#x27;s Artillery Inspection, and of the 2nd and 3rd Infantry divisions.

Between 1935–1938 Lukov served as Minister of War, in which position he created close ties to high-ranking Nazi officials.

=== Second World War ===

During the Second World War he was a key supporter of the Axis powers, particularly Nazi Germany.
This was largely due to his close relations with the Third Reich and his activities as leader of UBNL. Lukov was considered one of the most prominent advocates of antisemitic ideas in Bulgaria.

== Death ==
Lukov was shot dead by Communist partisans on 13 February 1943 in Sofia. According to the book &quot;In the Name of the People&quot;, he was ambushed by two Jewish resistance fighters in front of his apartment in Sofia. Although struck by one bullet, he fought back one of the partisans, Ivan Burudzhiev, but the second one, Violeta Yakova, fired two more shots and killed him.

== &#x27;Lukov March&#x27; ==
From 2003 to 2019, the far-right Bulgarian National Union hosted an annual &#x27;Lukov March&#x27; to commemorate “fallen heroes of Bulgaria” with a torch march, taking place in February in Sofia. It persistently caused controversy and was subject to multiple court bans. In 2020, the Supreme Administrative Court upheld a ban by the Sofia municipality so that the evening procession was cancelled. Less than 200 supporters of Lukov still gathered for the laying of wreaths at the house where Lukov was killed. Over one hundred people gathered for a counter-protest in central Sofia earlier in the day, promoting “No Nazis on the streets”.

== Awards and decorations ==
* Order of Bravery, 4th degree, first and second class
* Order of St Alexander, 3rd class without swords and 4th class with swords
* Order of Military Merit, 1st class
* Iron Cross of 1939, 2nd class (Germany)

<text>Jacobus Johannes &quot;Jaap&quot; Eden (19 October 1873 – 2 February 1925) was a Dutch athlete. He is the only male athlete to win world championships in both speed skating and bicycle racing.

== Early life ==
Jaap Eden was born in Groningen to Johannes Eden and Maria Baale. Eden&#x27;s mother died of complications from his birth. His father, a gymnastics teacher, could not take care of the baby alone and sent him to his grandparents, who owned a hotel near Santpoort. As a boy, Eden enjoyed running in dunes near his grandparents&#x27; home, gymnastics and, in the winter, skating. His speed and skating technique were noticed by the best Dutch skater at the time, Klaas Pander, who invited the 15-year-old Eden to join him training.

Jaap Eden&#x27;s first significant victory came in a short track race over 160m in December 1890. Thus, Eden, at age 17, was allowed by the Dutch Federation to compete in the world championships.

The championships were organized by the Skating Club of Amsterdam, as there was no international governing body at the time. Only two foreign skaters entered, American Joe Donoghue becoming the first champion. Eden skated in the shortest two of the four events, placing 3rd and 4th in the half mile and mile, respectively. Eden entered the European Championships in Hamburg, but without any notable success.

Bad weather canceled the 1892 world championships; the European Championships that year were only attended by Austrian skaters. Eden instead competed in the Prince of Orange Cup in England, where he won his first international competition.

In summer 1892, skating officials from several European countries convened in Scheveningen. The International Skating Union (ISU) was established, and the body&#x27;s constitution announced annual world championships, over 500m, 1500m, 5000m and 10000m. The first ISU-governed world championships were to take place on the Museumplein in Amsterdam.

Eden also played bandy on an elite level, when it had been introduced to the Netherlands in 1891.

== Skating successes ==

Two days before the championships, Eden won the 1500m and 5000m Dutch championships. His time in the 1500 m, 2:35.0 is the first ISU-recognized world record in that distance. This made Eden, who trained in Norway earlier that winter, a favorite for the world championships.

In the 1500m, Eden tied with Oskar Frederiksen (Norway) in the preliminaries, but beat him in a head-to-head final race. He outclassed the field in the 5000m, winning by half a minute, while his main opponent Frederiksen did not finish. Eden was challenged again by Frederiksen in the first run of the 500m on the second day, but in the final Eden again beat the Norwegian. This meant Eden&#x27;s third victory, sufficient for the world title. Frederiksen skated the first official world record in the 10000m. Eden, skating alone in the last race, fell after the first lap and abandoned the race.

After his victory, Eden was welcomed by a crowd in his home town Haarlem. He became known throughout the country.

The next winter, Eden trained in Hamar, Norway and traveled to Stockholm for the world championships in early February 1894. Because of bad weather, the championships were held in nearby Saltsjöbaden. The 500m, saw Eden paired with Frederiksen. The Norwegian made a false start, but was unaware of this until the finish. He was requested to re-skate immediately, but he wanted to recover. Eden, convinced Frederiksen would be disqualified, skated alone, finishing in 50.4 seconds. Frederiksen matched it in his second attempt. Jaap Eden did not want to skate a tie-breaker and Frederiksen won after drawing lots.

Eden skated a world record in 10,000m. With 19:12.4, he was half a minute ahead of the others. In the third distance, he lost to Einar Halvorsen, which meant no world champion. Eden failed to finish the final distance after a fall.

Two weeks later, the European championships took place in Hamar. Eden failed to compete on the first day, officially because of the strong wind. However, he was in his hotel with one of the chambermaids. Eden returned to the ice on the second day, and emphatically won the 5,000m in 8:37.6 — a world record by almost half a minute. The record remained for nearly 17 years, until it was broken by 0.4 seconds by Nikolay Strunnikov.

==Legacy==
The ice skating rinks Jaap Edenbaan (outdoor) and Jaap Edenhal (indoor) in Amsterdam are named after Eden.

Since 1972, the Dutch Sportsman of the year receives the Jaap Eden Award. The prize for this achievement is a statue created by painter and sculptor Jits Bakker (born 1937) from Bilthoven and is named after Eden.

<text>Magilligan () is a peninsula that lies in the northwest of County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, at the entrance to Lough Foyle, within Causeway Coast and Glens district. It is an extensive coastal site, part British army firing range, part nature reserve and is home to the HM Prison Magilligan. The settlement of Magilligan Point on the lough is noted for its ferry crossing to Greencastle, County Donegal. The peninsula contains a civil parish of the same name.

==History==
Magilligan gets its name from &quot;MacGilligans country&quot;, which formed a major part of the barony of Keenaght.

Magilligan served as the base line for triangulation for the mapping of Ireland in the 19th century. Colonel Thomas Colby chose Magilligan due to the flatness of the strand and its proximity to Scotland which, along with the rest of Britain, had been accurately mapped in previous decades. A straight line precisely was measured from North Station to Ballykelly in 1828 from which all other references were measured. The survey finished in 1846 when County Kerry was mapped.

==Landmarks==

A Martello Tower stands to the north of Magilligan Point near the lough, Building began in 1812, late in the British, and featured a round tower with gun mounts for two 24-pounder guns. A fort at Magilligan point was originally planned but was seen as impractical because of soft ground. The tower has been restored but is not generally open. It was built at the same time as the more unusual double-gunned tower across the lough at Greencastle. The tower was finished in 1817, after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and never saw military action. During World War II the top of the tower was fitted out with a pillbox. Since its construction, sand deposits have enlarged the peninsula on which it stands and the tower is now some way from the sea.

HM Prison Magilligan is situated along the main road (Point Road) to the east of the Magilligan Point. It opened in 1972 and has a capacity of 568 prisoners.

==Transport==
It is close to Bellarena railway station and there is a ferry service which operates during the summer season, connecting Magilligan with Greencastle across the lough.

During the 19th century the Londonderry &amp; Coleraine Railway Company (L&amp;CR) operated a short lived tramway between the village of Magilligan and the settlement of Magilligan Point. Opening in July 1885 and closing in October 1885, it is the shortest lived passenger railway line in Ireland.

<doc id="1050149" wikidata="Q911379" url="?curid=1050149" title="Spillway">
<text>A spillway is a structure used to provide the controlled release of water downstream from a dam or levee, typically into the riverbed of the dammed river itself. In the United Kingdom, they may be known as overflow channels. Spillways ensure that water does not damage parts of the structure not designed to convey water.

Spillways can include floodgates and fuse plugs to regulate water flow and reservoir level. Such features enable a spillway to regulate downstream flow—by releasing water in a controlled manner before the reservoir is full, operators can prevent an unacceptably large release later.

Other uses of the term &quot;spillway&quot; include bypasses of dams and outlets of channels used during high water, and outlet channels carved through natural dams such as moraines.

Water normally flows over a spillway only during flood periods, when the reservoir has reached its capacity and water continues entering faster than it can be released. In contrast, an intake tower is a structure used to control water release on a routine basis for purposes such as water supply and hydroelectricity generation.

== Types ==
A spillway is located at the top of the reservoir pool. Dams may also have bottom outlets with valves or gates which may be operated to release flood flow, and a few dams lack overflow spillways and rely entirely on bottom outlets.

The two main types of spillways are controlled and uncontrolled.

A controlled spillway has mechanical structures or gates to regulate the rate of flow. This design allows nearly the full height of the dam to be used for water storage year-round, and flood waters can be released as required by opening one or more gates.

An uncontrolled spillway, in contrast, does not have gates; when the water rises above the lip or crest of the spillway, it begins to be released from the reservoir. The rate of discharge is controlled only by the height of water above the reservoir&#x27;s spillway. The fraction of storage volume in the reservoir above the spillway crest can only be used for the temporary storage of floodwater; it cannot be used as water supply storage because it sits higher than the dam can retain it.

In an intermediate type, normal level regulation of the reservoir is controlled by the mechanical gates. In this case, the dam is not designed to function with water flowing over the top if it, either due to the materials used for its construction or conditions directly downstream. If inflow to the reservoir exceeds the gate&#x27;s capacity, an artificial channel called an auxiliary or emergency spillway will convey water. Often, that is intentionally blocked by a fuse plug. If present, the fuse plug is designed to wash out in case of a large flood greater than the discharge capacity of the spillway gates. Although many months may be needed for construction crews to restore the fuse plug and channel after such an operation, the total damage and cost to repair is less than if the main water-retaining structures had been overtopped. The fuse plug concept is used where building a spillway with the required capacity would be costly.

===Open channel spillway===
==== Chute spillway ====
A chute spillway is a common and basic design that transfers excess water from behind the dam down a smooth decline into the river below. These are usually designed following an ogee curve. Most often, they are lined on the bottom and sides with concrete to protect the dam and topography. They may have a controlling device and some are thinner and multiply-lined if space and funding are tight. In addition, they are not always intended to dissipate energy like stepped spillways. Chute spillways can be ingrained with a baffle of concrete blocks but usually have a &quot;flip lip&quot; and/or dissipator basin, which creates a hydraulic jump, protecting the toe of the dam from erosion.

==== Stepped spillway ====
Stepped channels and spillways have been used for over 3,000 years. Despite being superseded by more modern engineering techniques such as hydraulic jumps in the mid twentieth century, since around 1985 interest in stepped spillways and chutes has been renewed, partly due to the use of new construction materials (e.g. roller-compacted concrete, gabions) and design techniques (e.g. embankment overtopping protection). The steps produce considerable energy dissipation along the chute and reduce the size of the required downstream energy dissipation basin.

Research is still active on the topic, with newer developments on embankment dam overflow protection systems, converging spillways and small-weir design.

=== Bell-mouth spillway ===

A &quot;bell-mouth&quot; spillway is designed like an inverted bell, where water can enter around the entire perimeter. These uncontrolled spillways are also called &quot;morning glory&quot; (after the flower), or &quot;glory hole&quot; spillways. In areas where the surface of the reservoir may freeze, this type of spillway is normally fitted with ice-breaking arrangements to prevent the spillway from becoming ice-bound.

Some bell-mouth spillways are gate-controlled. The highest morning glory spillway in the world is at Hungry Horse Dam in Montana, U.S., and is controlled by a ring gate. The bell-mouth spillway in Covão dos Conchos reservoir in Portugal is constructed to look like a natural formation. The largest bell-mouth spillway is in Geehi Dam, in New South Wales, Australia, measuring in diameter at the lake&#x27;s surface.

=== Siphon spillway ===
A &quot;siphon&quot; spillway uses the difference in height between the intake and the outlet to create the pressure difference required to remove excess water. Siphons require priming to remove air in the bend for them to function, and most siphon spillways are designed to use water to automatically prime the siphon. One such design is the &quot;volute&quot; siphon, which employs &quot;volutes&quot;, or fins, on a funnel to form water into a vortex that draws air out of the system. The priming happens automatically when the water level rises above the inlets.

=== Other types ===
The &quot;ogee crest&quot; over-tops a dam, a &quot;side channel&quot; wraps around the topography of a dam, and a &quot;labyrinth&quot; uses a zig-zag design to increase the sill length for a thinner design and increased discharge. A &quot;drop inlet&quot; resembles an intake for a hydroelectric power plant and transfers water from behind the dam directly through tunnels to the river downstream.

== Design considerations ==
One parameter of spillway design is the largest flood it is designed to handle. The structures must safely withstand the appropriate spillway design flood (SDF), sometimes called the inflow design flood (IDF). The magnitude of the SDF may be set by dam safety guidelines, based on the size of the structure and the potential loss of human life or property downstream. The magnitude of the flood is sometimes expressed as a return period. A 100-year recurrence interval is the flood magnitude expected to be exceeded on the average of once in 100 years. This parameter may be expressed as an exceedance frequency with a 1% chance of being exceeded in any given year. The volume of water expected during the design flood is obtained by hydrologic calculations of the upstream watershed. The return period is set by dam safety guidelines, based on the size of the structure and the potential loss of human life or property downstream. 

The United States Army Corps of Engineers bases their requirements on the probable maximum flood (PMF) and the probable maximum precipitation (PMP). The PMP is the largest precipitation thought to be physically possible in the upstream watershed. Dams of lower hazard may be allowed to have an IDF less than the PMF.

===Energy dissipation===

As water passes over a spillway and down the chute, potential energy converts into increasing kinetic energy. Failure to dissipate the water&#x27;s energy can lead to scouring and erosion at the dam&#x27;s toe (base). This can cause spillway damage and undermine the dam&#x27;s stability. To put this energy in perspective, the spillways at Tarbela Dam could, at full capacity, produce 40,000 MW; about 10 times the capacity of its power plant.

The energy can be dissipated by addressing one or more parts of a spillway&#x27;s design. 
;Steps
First, on the spillway surface itself by a series of steps along the spillway (see stepped spillway). 
;Flip bucket
Second, at the base of a spillway, a flip bucket can create a hydraulic jump and deflect water upwards. 
;Ski jump
A ski jump can direct water horizontally and eventually down into a plunge pool, or two ski jumps can direct their water discharges to collide with one another.
;Stilling basin
Third, a stilling basin at the terminus of a spillway serves to further dissipate energy and prevent erosion. They are usually filled with a relatively shallow depth of water and sometimes lined with concrete. A number of velocity-reducing components can be incorporated into their design to include chute blocks, baffle blocks, wing walls, surface boils, or end sills.

== Safety ==
Spillway gates may operate suddenly without warning, under remote control. Trespassers within the spillway are at high risk of drowning. Spillways are usually fenced and equipped with locked gates to prevent casual trespassing within the structure. Warning signs, sirens, and other measures may be in place to warn users of the downstream area of sudden release of water. Operating protocols may require &quot;cracking&quot; a gate to release a small amount of water to warn persons downstream.

The sudden closure of a spillway gate can result in the stranding of fish, and this is usually avoided.

Led by Coach Chris Olsen, the team won eight state sectional championships in the ten years through 2011, reigning as the two-time defending champs of North I Group III. The team accumulated a 65-6 record during the seven seasons through 2008.

Wayne Hills and Wayne Valley have participated in an annual rivalry since 2009, which Wayne Hills leads 11-2 through the 2017 season. NJ.com listed the rivalry in the 24th spot on their 2017 list &quot;Ranking the 31 fiercest rivalries in N.J. HS football&quot;.

In 2002, the varsity team won their first North Jersey I Group III title in the school&#x27;s history by defeating Ramapo High School 19-0. This was also the first undefeated football season. Additionally, several members of this senior class became professional athletes. Tight end Greg Olsen went on to play college and professional football.

From 2004 to 2009, the team won 55 consecutive games. During the winning streak, the team won five state sectional championships, including four perfect 12-0 seasons. The Wayne Hills 55-game win streak came to an end with a 17-15 loss to Saint Joseph Regional High School in October 2009. The streak is the second-longest in New Jersey high school football history, behind only to Paulsboro High School&#x27;s 63-game win streak.

The 2004 team finished the season with a 10-2 record after winning the North I Group III state sectional title, defeating Ramapo High School by a score of 38-28 in the semis and then topping Northern Valley Regional High School at Demarest in the tournament final by a score of 17-16.

The team was in the 2005 playoffs as the top seed in the North I, Group III bracket, and won the first two rounds, beating #8-seed Teaneck High School 40-6 and number-four Ramapo High School 41-13, and then crushing third-seeded Parsippany Hills High School by a score of 46-0 in the sectional finals.

In 2006, the Patriots came in seeded second in the North I, Group III bracket, and won the first two rounds, beating 7th-seed Northern Valley Regional High School at Old Tappan 37-7 and 6th-seed Passaic Valley Regional High School 33-0. In the state finals, played at Rutgers University on December 2, 2006, Wayne Hills defeated fourth-seeded Parsippany Hills High School 23-12, the second consecutive year the two faced each other in the finals. The football team was ranked 3rd behind #1 Don Bosco Prep and #2 St. Peter&#x27;s Prep in New Jersey. The team was ranked 7th in the East region by &quot;USA Today&quot; in their final 2006 Super 25 prep football regional rankings.

Wayne Hill&#x27;s football team finished 12-0 in the 2007 season, defeating Wayne Valley High School in the North I Group III state sectional championship game played at Giants Stadium by a final score of 27-7.

In 2009, Wayne Hills lost to their longtime rival, Ramapo High School, in the North I, Group III state sectional championship at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford. The loss to Ramapo ended a streak of 17 consecutive playoff victories extending from the first round of the 2004 playoffs through the 2009 semifinal game and a string of 62 consecutive wins in football games played against public schools statewide dating back to 2003.

In 2010, Wayne Hills won the North I Group III state championship against Northern Valley at Old Tappan in what has been called the &quot;Miracle in the Meadowlands&quot;, taking a lateral pass on a kickoff with seconds left on the clock to win the state title by a score of 24-21. The team ended this year ranked 3rd in the top 25 best high school teams in North Jersey by &quot;The Record&quot; and its national ranking according to Max Preps was 289.

In December 2011, the New Jersey Commissioner of Education upheld the suspension of nine Wayne Hills football players who been alleged to have been involved in an October fight outside of a house party in which two students from Wayne Valley High School had been assaulted, including one who was beaten and left unconscious in a street. Though the students had been allowed to play in the first two rounds of the football playoffs, they were ruled ineligible to participate in that year&#x27;s final against Old Tappan. Despite the absence of the nine from the championship game, Wayne Hills defeated Old Tappan for the second consecutive year, by a score of 15-12, the team&#x27;s second consecutive North I, Group III title and its eighth title in ten years.

The Wayne Hills football program was featured in the documentary series titled &quot;Traditions&quot;, which airs on SNY. The production team followed the team around for the first week of October and attended practices and conducted interviews to showcase what the program, at its core, is about.

In Spring 2012, head coach Chris Olsen announced that he would step down as the athletic director for the 2012-13 school year and serve as head coach for the last year. The team finished with a 6-5 record and did not make an appearance in the finals, losing to Pascack Valley High School in the semi-finals by a score of 20-11, marking the first year in nine years that the Wayne Hills Patriots did not make it to the state finals.

The team won the 2016 North I, Group IV state sectional championship with a 31-24 overtime win in the tournament final against Wayne Valley High School, under head coach Wayne Demikoff.

<doc id="1050167" wikidata="Q5242387" url="?curid=1050167" title="Dawlish Warren">
<text>Dawlish Warren is a seaside resort near to the town of Dawlish, in Teignbridge on the south coast of Devon, England. At the 2021 census, it had a population of 1,190. Dawlish Warren consists almost entirely of holiday accommodation and facilities for holidaymakers, especially on caravan sites.

==Location==
Dawlish Warren is located at the mouth of the Exe Estuary opposite Exmouth and has a beach, a National Nature Reserve spanning 506 acres (2 km2) and a golf course, which is classified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

The renowned sand spit at Dawlish Warren is the location of both the golf course and the nature reserve which was declared a National Nature Reserve in 2000. This spit has reduced in size within the past century due to erosion partly caused by the installation of a breakwater at Langstone Rock to the south-west which traps sand from the local sandstone cliffs and interrupts the natural sediment flow of the area.

The resort is popular with holidaymakers and although a death occurred from E. coli poisoning in 1999, allegedly caused by a nearby sewage outflow, a new sewage treatment plant has since been built resulting in both Dawlish Warren and Dawlish beaches now winning the Blue Flag for the quality of the bathing waters.

==Tourism==
Along with neighbouring Dawlish, this corner of south Devon has a favourable climate, which draws thousands of visitors to the area in summer. Because of this, the Dawlish Warren economy relies heavily on tourism, and in particular on the many caravan and camping parks in the village which add over 15,000 to the local population during the summer months. There are several holiday parks which attract visitors from all over the UK, but in particular the West Midlands and South Wales. The major holiday parks are Welcome, Hazelwood, Cofton, Golden Sands, Dawlish Sands, Peppermint Park, Lady&#x27;s Mile and Oakcliff. In 2008 Peppermint Park and Golden Sands joined Dawlish Sands as part of Park Holidays UK Caravan Parks. The name &#x27;Peppermint Park&#x27; has gone and the site has been rebranded &#x27;Golden Sands&#x27;.

==Amenities==
Dawlish Warren has a doctor&#x27;s surgery, a pharmacy and an independent supermarket, along with several gift shops which cater for tourist traffic.

There are a number of restaurants and takeaway eateries. There are many bars and pubs such as the &quot;Warren Bridge Inn&quot; and the &quot;Mount Pleasant Inn&quot;, which dates from before the 1750s and is located just outside the resort.

==Transport==

The resort is served by Dawlish Warren railway station, situated a few minutes from the beach. It lies between the stations of and on the 
Riviera Line, a section of the Great Western Main Line between London Paddington and in Cornwall. Stopping services are operated by Great Western Railway, on a route between Exmouth, Exeter and Paignton.

Dawlish can be reached by a walk south-west along the South Devon Railway sea wall.

Local bus services are operated predominantly by Stagecoach South West; key routes that serve the town include:
* 22: Dawlish Warren to South Devon College in Paignton
* 187: Dawlish Warren to Dawlish

==Religion==

Although Dawlish Warren is within the civil parish of Dawlish, it lies in the ecclesiastical parish of Cofton. There is no actual church in Dawlish Warren, but St Mary&#x27;s Church Hall (St Mary&#x27;s Church is in Cofton) is located near the resort&#x27;s railway station. It is used for services and community activities.

<doc id="1050174" wikidata="Q313335" url="?curid=1050174" title="Somewhere Far Beyond">
<text>Somewhere Far Beyond is the fourth studio album by the German power metal band Blind Guardian. It was released in 1992 and produced by Kalle Trapp. The cover artwork was created by Andreas Marschall, who also drew the artwork for other Blind Guardian&#x27;s releases (&quot;Tales from the Twilight World&quot;, &quot;Nightfall in Middle-Earth&quot;, etc.). The album saw the band creating its own original sound, while still employing most of their speed/power metal techniques.

The cover art and the two &quot;Bard&#x27;s Songs&quot; gave the band its nickname &quot;The Bards&quot;. The use of the nickname has been also extended to the fans of the group, Circle of the Bards being the now defunct fan club, and Hansi Kürsch frequently calling the fans &quot;Bards&quot;.

&quot;The Piper&#x27;s Calling&quot; contains the first three parts of the Great Highland Bagpipe 2/4 March, &quot;The 79th&#x27;s Farewell to Gibraltar&quot;, written by Pipe Major John MacDonald of the 79th Regiment of Foot (Cameronian Volunteers). Part of this composition also appears as a section of the title track, this time played on a different type of bagpipe.

The album was acclaimed by power metal fans all across Europe and especially Japan, allowing them to tour for the first time outside Germany. The tour in the Far East led to the band&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Tokyo Tales&quot;.

&quot;Somewhere Far Beyond&quot; was remastered and re-released, with bonus tracks, on 15 June 2007. The album was again re-released and also remixed and remastered as part of &quot;A Traveler&#x27;s Guide to Space and Time&quot; boxset.

<text>The Greenville Braves were an American minor league baseball franchise, based in Greenville, South Carolina, that served as the Class AA farm team of the Atlanta Braves between 1984 and 2004. The Braves played in Greenville Municipal Stadium for all 21 years of their existence. 

The team had much success and many famous future Atlanta players such as Tom Glavine, Chipper Jones, Javy López, Jason Marquis, Eddie Pérez, Andruw Jones, and John Rocker played there. They won multiple Southern League championships, and the 1992 edition, managed by Grady Little and featuring Chipper Jones and López, won 100 out of 143 games (.699) during the regular season to take the pennant, then captured the SL playoff title. The 1992 Braves were recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time. After the 2004 season, the parent club in Atlanta transferred the G-Braves to Pearl, Mississippi, where the team was known as the Mississippi Braves. After the 2024 season, the team relocated again to Columbus, Georgia, where they became known as the Columbus Clingstones.

The Braves cited an outdated stadium that did not meet current standards and the City of Greenville&#x27;s unwillingness to create a sufficient financial package to build a new stadium as the cause of the move. With the Greenville Braves out, the Greenville Bombers (formerly the Capital City Bombers), Class A South Atlantic League affiliate of the Boston Red Sox, moved into the old Braves stadium in 2005. In 2006, a brand new stadium located in Downtown Greenville, Fluor Field at the West End, opened and the Bombers changed their name to the Greenville Drive.

==Greenville Braves (WCL, 1963–64)==
Greenville also hosted a team in the low Class A Western Carolinas League—the former identity (1960–79) of the South Atlantic League—called the &quot;Braves&quot; as an affiliate of the Milwaukee Braves in 1963 and 1964. This two-year affiliation was brief, but produced the 1963 playoff champions of the WCL. When the New York Mets replaced the Braves as the team&#x27;s parent in 1965, the nickname was changed.

<doc id="1050190" wikidata="Q182504" url="?curid=1050190" title="Felix Perez Camacho">
<text>Felix James Pérez Camacho (born October 30, 1957) is an American politician and businessman who served as the seventh governor of Guam from 2003 to 2011. A member of the Republican Party of Guam, he had previously served as a six-term senator in the Guam Legislature from 1993 to 2003. 

Born into the Camacho family, his father, Carlos Camacho, served as the 1st Governor of Guam from 1969 to 1975. Camacho unsuccessfully ran for Governor again in the 2022 Guamanian election, losing to incumbent Democrat Lou Leon Guerrero.

==Early life==
Camacho was born in Camp Zama, a U.S. military base in Japan. Camacho&#x27;s father was Carlos Camacho. Camacho&#x27;s mother was Lourdes Perez Camacho. He was raised in Tamuning, Guam, and was educated in the Catholic school system. Camacho&#x27;s father became Guam&#x27;s last appointed governor in 1969, and subsequently became the first elected governor in 1971. In 1980, Camacho received a degree in business administration and finance from Marquette University.

==Political career==
Camacho has held positions with Pacific Financial Corporation as an insurance manager, and with IBM as an account administrator. In March 1988, Governor Joseph Franklin Ada appointed him as deputy director of the Public Utility Agency of Guam, and he was chosen to be the executive director of the department later that year. In 1992, Camacho was elected as senator in the 22nd Guam Legislature, and was subsequently re-elected in 1994 and 1996. As a senator, he served as chairman of the Committee on Tourism, Transportation, and Economic Development. He also served as a majority whip.

In 1998, Camacho was the running mate of Joseph Ada in the hotly-contested gubernatorial campaign. Their loss resulted in Camacho&#x27;s absence from public office for the next two years. Having won in the 2000 legislative election, Camacho returned to the legislature and regained his chairmanship, as well as the position of assistant majority leader.

==Elections==
===2002 gubernatorial candidacy===
In 2002, Camacho teamed up with fellow senator, Kaleo Moylan, to run for the positions as Guam&#x27;s governor and lieutenant governor, respectively. On August 31, 2002, Camacho-Moylan went on to defeat Speaker Antonio “Tony” Unpingco in the Republican primary election. Additionally, Camacho-Moylan’s campaign for the general election ran successfully against Democratic contenders Guam Delegate Congressman Robert A. Underwood, and his running mate, Senator Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; C. Ada.

===2006 gubernatorial candidacy===
Due to various disagreements with Moylan during their first term, Camacho picked freshman senator Michael Cruz, M.D. as his running mate in 2006. Camacho again defeated Robert A. Underwood (this time with senator Frank Aguon Jr. as running mate) to win the governorship for a second term.

===2016 Congressional run===
In 2016 he ran against Democratic incumbent Madeleine Bordallo to represent Guam&#x27;s at-large congressional district, but was defeated 53% to 47%.

===2022 gubernatorial candidacy===
Camacho launched his campaign again for the 2022 Republican nomination for governor of Guam with senator Tony Ada as his running mate in February 2022. He was defeated in the general election by incumbent Democratic Governor Lou Leon Guerrero.

==Governorship==
===Tenure===
On December 8, 2002, Guam was slammed by Super Typhoon Pongsona, shortly after Camacho and Moylan were elected into office. They opted not to have a formal inaugural celebration, due to the state of the island. The duo instead chose to be sworn in with a ceremony at the Plaza de España at midnight, after a celebratory mass at the Dulce Nombre de Maria Cathedral Basilica in Hagåtña—all under candle light.

Typhoon Pogsona occurred just six months after the island had been devastated by Typhoon Chataan, and left the citizens of Guam reeling from the aftermath. Widespread damage affected facilities and structures in both the public and private sectors, which included: hospitals, schools, Guam International Airport, the Port of Guam, hotels, businesses, and hundreds of homes. The damages were estimated at $246 million by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Fuel tanks at the Cabras Island caught on fire making it unsafe for ships to come into the harbor. The Guam Telephone Authority and A.B. Won Pat International Airport were also shut down for a time. Soon, though, approximately 10,000 tourists who had been on Guam since before the storm were able to go home. Camacho and his administration worked on getting the power, water, communications and transportation systems running again, as well as re-opening the island’s schools and getting assistance to people with typhoon damaged homes and businesses. Tourism went down to a minimum and the government was essentially bankrupt.

Camacho led the effort to restore the island to normalcy, along with much help from the government of Guam, federal government, the military, the business community and the resilient citizens. Three months later island leaders let potential visitors know that the island was ready to welcome them again and tourism rebounded.

The Camacho Administration had other challenges to governing Guam as well. Due to concerns about the way the previous administration had handled government affairs, the Guam Legislature enacted legislation to remove power from the Office of the Governor in several ways. For the first time Guam had an elected attorney general and an elected auditor. There was also an elected school board and appointed superintendent of education who had complete authority over the largest government agency, the Guam Department of Education.

Likewise, for the first time the people of Guam had elected a board to run the government&#x27;s utilities. The Consolidated Utilities Commission took management of the power and water out of the Governor’s hands. The Public Utilities Commission also set utility rates, and the Guam Telephone Authority was sold to a private company in 2005, the last government owned telephone exchange in the United States, taking even more government responsibility away from the administration.

Camacho took office during austere times. Guam lacked sufficient revenues to pay its obligations. The mandates of local and federal law far exceed the governments fiscal capacity to honor those obligations. To supplement revenues, Camacho sought to issue bonds worth approximately $400 million. However, the attorney general refused to sign the bond contracts because he concluded that issuance of the bonds would violate the debt limitation. In response, the Governor requested a declaration from the Guam Supreme Court that the issuance of the bonds would not cause Guam to exceed the debt limitation. The Guam Supreme Court agreed with the Governor and the attorney general appealed his decision. Four years later the US Supreme Court heard the matter and in the end the Governor was able to issue bonds.

In the meantime, several lawsuits dramatically impacted the government and the Governor had to prioritize government resources toward addressing many of these challenges. The following are a few of the major lawsuits against the government to which the government paid out millions of dollars.

In 1993, a class action lawsuit was filed against Governor Ada to implement a 1988 statute to provide annually to eligible government of Guam retirees a cost of living allowance to be computed by multiplying the entitle benefit times the rate of inflation based on the cost of living index. The law was later repealed in 1995. In 2006, the court awarded $123 million to the COLA class action suit and the government began to pay the judgment.

Since the US Environmental Protection Agency issued an order in 1986 to cease discharging leachate from the Ordot Dump, Camacho signed a consent decree in 2004 to close Ordot Dump and construct a new solid waste landfill facility. The terms of the decree appeared to be workable but in actuality it become difficult to comply with the decree due to resistance by members of the public and the legislature. Additionally, the lack of resources, experienced personnel, and necessary support prevented the government from meeting the various deadlines set forth in the consent decree.

The court imposed penalties of more than $2.86 million against the government for failing to abide by the mandates of the consent decree. Ultimately, the federal court appointed a receiver to enforce the terms of the consent decree and assume all the functions of the solid waste management division of the Department of Public Works. The court ordered the government to deposit $20 million into an account while the government with the court appointed receiver worked out a financing option for the consent decree projects. When a viable financing option was not presented to the court, the court ordered the government to deposit $993,700 on a weekly basis into the account. Eventually, the court suspended the weekly payments when the government issued bonds totaling $202 million for the consent decree projects.

In 2001, a group of mentally ill individuals who lived on Guam filed suit against Camacho&#x27;s predecessor, Governor Gutierrez, for failure to provide community-based living services to the mentally ill. The court found that defendants had discriminated against plaintiffs by requiring them to reside in the adult In-patient units to receive services, and that the services provided to Plaintiffs were not appropriate to their particular needs. Additionally, the court found that the Defendants had violated the Plaintiffs&#x27; constitutional rights to minimum standards of care and appointed a federal management team in 2010.

In 2004, a class action lawsuit was filed against Camacho claiming refunds of approximately $112 million as a result of the earned income tax credit. The complaint was amended in 2006 wherein the class asked for approximately $135 million. The parties settled the case for $90 million. In anticipation of the court’s approval of the settlement agreement, the Camacho Administration managed to set aside millions of dollars in order to begin payments according to the terms of the settlement agreement.

The government budget was lower as well, at $396 million from a previous $500 million. Another first, also due to legislative mandates, was that the budget was based on gross receipt taxes, which at that time was four percent. That model simply didn&#x27;t work as GRT fluctuates too much over the year and the law was later rescinded. Eventually the GRT was raised from four to six percent much to the dismay of the private sector. The entire administration took temporary cuts in pay, including the governor. Non-essential government employees were placed on a 32 hour work week until revenues started recovering.

One of Camacho&#x27;s challenges in taking office was the change of having an elected attorney general. In the past, the appointed attorney general worked for the governor but now the elected attorney general saw his role as a watchdog and became very litigious. Moylan, first cousin to Lieutenant Governor Moylan, told the governor that the courts would define his limits and that he was not the governor&#x27;s lackey anymore. The joke at the time was that the A.G. for attorney general, also stood for “aspiring governor.&quot;

Lawsuits and legal challenges defined those first two years and the dynamic of being the governor of Guam changed. The legislature, at the time, believed that the position of Governor of Guam held too much authority as granted by the Organic Act of Guam. Even though there was a Republican majority in the Legislature, several of the senators also had aspirations to be governor.

==Personal life==
Camacho&#x27;s wife is Joann Garcia Camacho. They have three children and three grandchildren. Mrs. Camacho is a niece of Vicente &quot;Ben&quot; Gumataotao, the mayor of Piti and first cousin of Jose Gumataotao, the husband of the former US Treasurer, Rosa Gumataotao Rios, the cousin of judge Vernon Perez, and other cousin of a local entrepreneur Valentino Gumataotao Perez. He is a member of the Knights of Columbus and participates in many civic activities. He was honored as one of the Outstanding Young Men of America and received the Pacific Jaycees Three Young Outstanding People award.

<text>Evolutionary robotics is an embodied approach to Artificial Intelligence (AI) in which robots are automatically designed using Darwinian principles of natural selection. The design of a robot, or a subsystem of a robot such as a neural controller, is optimized against a behavioral goal (e.g. run as fast as possible). Usually, designs are evaluated in simulations as fabricating thousands or millions of designs and testing them in the real world is prohibitively expensive in terms of time, money, and safety.

An evolutionary robotics experiment starts with a population of randomly generated robot designs. The worst performing designs are discarded and replaced with mutations and/or combinations of the better designs. This evolutionary algorithm continues until a prespecified amount of time elapses or some target performance metric is surpassed.

Evolutionary robotics methods are particularly useful for engineering machines that must operate in environments in which humans have limited intuition (nanoscale, space, etc.). Evolved simulated robots can also be used as scientific tools to generate new hypotheses in biology and cognitive science, and to test old hypothesis that require experiments that have proven difficult or impossible to carry out in reality.

==History==
In the early 1990s, two separate European groups demonstrated different approaches to the evolution of robot control systems. Dario Floreano and Francesco Mondada at EPFL evolved controllers for the Khepera robot. Adrian Thompson, Nick Jakobi, Dave Cliff, Inman Harvey, and Phil Husbands evolved controllers for a Gantry robot at the University of Sussex. 
However the body of these robots was presupposed before evolution.

The first simulations of evolved robots were reported by Karl Sims and Jeffrey Ventrella of the MIT Media Lab, also in the early 1990s. However these so-called virtual creatures never left their simulated worlds. The first evolved robots to be built in reality were 3D-printed by Hod Lipson and Jordan Pollack at Brandeis University at the turn of the 21st century.

<doc id="1050196" wikidata="Q3235204" url="?curid=1050196" title="Mazda Lantis">
<text>The Mazda Lantis (Japanese: マツダ・ランティス) is a series of two sports compact cars sold in Japan from 1993 to 1998. In the rest of the world it was also known as 323F, Astina, 323 Astina, Allegro Hatchback or Artis Hatchback.

The Mazda Lantis used Mazda&#x27;s CB platform, which means close relations to the Eunos 500/Xedos 6 and the 1994-1997 Mazda Capella. It was an FF layout car with a transversely mounted engine and either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. 

The body variant is what Mazda called a &quot;4-door coupé&quot;, which in common terminology is a 5-door hatchback. In Europe the 5-door hatchback was designated BA, but was actually almost identical to the CB, and had little to do with other B platforms.

The 5-door was sold as the Mazda 323F in Europe, Artis in Chile and Allegro Hatchback (HB) in Colombia and a few other countries of Latin America. This model was penned by Ginger (Arnold) Ostle, who worked for Porsche before arriving at Mazda. He was the Chief of the Porsche Design Office and also assisted in the design of the Porsche 944, which has been referenced as an artistic inspiration for the design of the Lantis.

The Mazda 323F weighs in at just 1,210 kg (2,668 lbs) and came standard with a naturally aspirated DOHC 1.5L, 1.6L or 1.8L inline-four engine with VICS paired with a 55-litre fuel tank. It features a single driver airbag, power steering, disk-brakes all-round although the front were ventilated, electrically adjustable mirrors, central locking and power windows. Standard suspension had independent wish-bone springs at the front and rear as well as 14-inch rims with a tyre offset of 185/65. Another noticeable feature are the frameless windows, similar to the Nissan Presea. Additionally, there existed optional factory upgrades such as the sportier n/a DOHC 2.0L 24-valve V6 with VRIS, which existed in multiple states of tune, ABS, a passenger airbag, a modest rear spoiler and a glass sunroof. The V6, specifically, sports an extraordinarily rigid yet smooth suspension setup to ensure exceptional handling with longer-than-usual suspension arms and the front dampers including built-in rebounding springs for stability, as well as 16-inch rims with a low-profile offset of 205/50 allowing for excellent cornering and grip.

By the time the cars premiered in August 1993, Mazda&#x27;s multi-brand strategy had become difficult to sustain, so both Lantis variants were released to Mazda, Efini and Eunos dealerships. Sales in Japan were lacklustre throughout the Lantis&#x27; production run, with only 45,000 of the 230,000 Lantis&#x27; produced staying in Japan which caused domestic sales to halt in 1997, but the 323F proved to be immensely popular in Europe and some Latin America countries, where it sold in reasonable numbers right until it was discontinued in 1998. The JDM Lantis was a popular used export to New Zealand.

The Lantis&#x27; 1.8L four-cylinder variant had 4-valves per cylinder, a compression ratio of 9:1 and featured multi-port manifold injection. It made 133ps (98 kw; 131 bhp) and 152 Nm (112.11 lb-ft) of torque @ 5,000 rpm, giving it a power-per-litre of 71.2 bhp/L, a power-to-weight ratio of 112.9 bhp/tonne and a torque-to-weight ratio of 131 Nm/tonne. The manual transmission was markedly more fuel-efficient, having a fuel-consumption rating of 8.3L/100km in the city and 5L/100km on the highway making for an average fuel rating of 6.8L/100km. In comparison, the automatic transmission had an average fuel rating of 9.4L/100km. Although electronically capped to 180km/h in Japan due to law, it had an actual top speed of 190km/h and the manual transmission recorded a 0-100kmm/h time of 9.6 seconds. It&#x27;s optional V6, however, was more substantial and existed in three states of tune depending on the market and year. The V6 had a compression ratio of 10.1 from 1993-1994 and 10.5:1 from 1994-1996 when the engine ceased production. In 1993-1994 the engine made 146ps (107 kw; 144 hp) and in 1994-1996 162ps (119 kw; 160 bhp). In exchange for its higher power the V6 was less fuel efficient than the 1.8L with the manual transmission recording a fuel rating of 8.7L/100km and the automatic 10L/100km. 

The rare Type-R version of the Mazda Lantis was exclusively sold in Japan and could only be obtained in Europe and other parts of the world through import. The Type-R features a 170ps (125 kw, 168 bhp) 2.0L (122 ci) KF-ZE 24-valve DOHC V6 engine with 180 Nm (133 lb-ft) of torque @ 5,500 rpm, a limited-slip differential and appearance options like a front lip spoiler, side skirts, floating rear spoiler, coloured front indicators and other modifications known collectively as the Mazdaspeed A-Spec kit. It has a power-per-litre of 85ps (84 bhp), a power-to-weight ratio of 140ps (139 bhp) / ton and a torque-to-weight ratio of 149 Nm (110 bhp) / ton. The manual Type-R completed Tsukuba circuit in 1:14.17 and had a quarter-mile time of 15.9 seconds. Mazda also raced the Type-R in domestic touring car racing such as the Japanese Touring Car Championship. 

The name Lantis is created from the Latin phrase &quot;Latens Curtis&quot;, which roughly translates as &quot;To secretly shorten&quot;.

Although the 323F lacks a badge indicating which engine is fitted, the V6 version is easily recognizable since it is the only 323F with 5 stud hubs.

The South African and possibly other versions of the 323F branded as the Astina do include badges on the back indicating the engine capacity. The 1.8l is displayed with a badge reading 180 for example.

<text>Scott Camil (born May 19, 1946) is an American political activist. He first gained prominence as an opponent of the Vietnam War, as a witness in the Winter Soldier Investigation and a member of Vietnam Veterans Against the War.

==Early life and education==
Camil was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Jewish parents with origins in Romania and Russia. His parents were divorced when he was four years old. His mother remarried and he, his mother, stepfather, sister moved to Florida where and two stepbrothers were born. Camil had a troubled childhood, frequently being beaten by his authoritarian stepfather, and occasionally getting into fights with school children who would harass him because he was Jewish. He was brought up to believe he lived in the best country in the world and that, as a citizen, he had a duty as a male—that duty was to go into the military to serve his country after high school. He enrolled in the Marines delayed enlistment program while still in high school, and entered boot camp at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island three days after graduating.

He served with the Marines from 1965 to 1969, earning two Purple Hearts, Combat Action Ribbon, two Presidential Unit Citations, Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal with three stars, Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Silver Star, Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm Leaf, and Vietnam Campaign Medal during two tours in Vietnam. With Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division, he acted as a forward observer for artillery. He was a sergeant when honorably discharged.

After his discharge from military service, Camil enrolled with Miami-Dade Community College on the G.I. Bill, and later transferred to the University of Florida. In a 2005 interview with UF&#x27;s Samuel Proctor Oral History Program, he recounted that as a student he went to see Jane Fonda speak, &quot;to see what a movie star looked like.&quot; Fonda spoke on the importance of an informed public in a democracy, and said, as paraphrased by Camil, &quot;that it was the duty of every patriotic Vietnam veteran to make the truth known to the public.&quot; Camil agreed with that. He also felt that his sacrifices as a soldier had gone unrecognized in contrast to those of soldiers in past wars, saying, &quot;I got two Purple Hearts, I was wounded, I killed lots of people [and] where was my thanks?&quot; 

He soon learned about the Winter Soldier Investigation and became active in the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, later becoming a chapter leader of that organization. He graduated from UF while on trial as one of the &quot;Gainesville Eight&quot;.

==Vietnam war activism==
Recognized by the FBI as an &quot;extremist and key activist,&quot; Camil was on President Nixon&#x27;s &quot;enemies list.&quot; On December 22, 1971, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover sent a classified memo to the Jacksonville office regarding Camil, referring to him as an &quot;extremely dangerous and unstable individual whose activities must be neutralized at earliest possible time.&quot; Other memos about Camil used the same word, &quot;neutralize,&quot; less ambiguously: &quot;Jacksonville continue to press vigorously to insure (sic) that all necessary action taken to completely neutralize subject without delay.&quot; Camil explained, &quot;When you pin the government down, they&#x27;ll say &#x27;Well, &quot;neutralize&quot; just means to render useless.&#x27; But if you talk to guys in the field, they say it means to kill.&quot; Camil was shot by federal agents on March 31, 1975, in a drug sting, and nearly died.

===Winter Soldier Investigation===
Camil became the Florida Coordinator for the VVAW, and was one of the most outspoken participants of the 1971 Winter Soldier Investigation, in which returning personnel recounted the atrocities they had been induced into committing against combatants and non-combatants alike. Camil (also referred to as &quot;Camile&quot; in the transcripts) testified of 

===Medals returned===
At Senator Hart&#x27;s garden party during Dewey Canyon III, Camil wore two Purple Heart medals, a Vietnamese Cross for Gallantry with Silver Star, and a Good Conduct medal. He called the medals a farce which he would return on Friday. In the documentary &quot;A Seasoned Veteran&quot;, Camil Stated: &quot;The throwing away of the medals, for me, was the cutting of the umbilical cord between me and the government. I was now independent.&quot; 

===Taking it to the source===
In a 1992 interview, Camil revealed for the first time that he had considered shooting &quot;the most hardcore hawks&quot; in Congress as an alternative to returning medals during the Dewey Canyon III demonstration in April 1971. In Camil&#x27;s words, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think it was terrible at the time ... I was serious. I felt that I spent two years killing women and children in their own fucking homes. These are the guys that fucking made the policy, and these were the guys that were responsible for it, and these were the guys that were voting to continue the fucking war when the public was against it. I felt that if we really believed in what we were doing, and if we were willing to put our lives on the line for the country over there, we should be willing to put our lives on the line for the country over here.&quot; Six months later at a November 1971 meeting, after recruiting participants and describing his weapons training range, Camil proposed to the VVAW his idea about the assassination of the members of Congress who showed the most support for the war. The proposal was voted down.

===University of Florida activism===
At the 1971 UF homecoming parade, Quakers, Unitarian Church members and VVAW members, including Camil, created a spectacle. Dressed as rifle-carrying soldiers, some of them carried a coffin draped in an American flag, and carried a sign that read &quot;The Impossible Dream - No More War.&quot; People panicked after smoke bombs were ignited and VVAW members pretended to stab civilians (VVAW actors) in the crowd who had packets of fake blood hidden beneath their clothing. They then passed out leaflets to the crowd informing them that if they lived in Vietnam, this could really be happening to them, their friends, their family, and their children.
It was during this period that the Orange County (FL) Young Democrats chose Scott Camil as their &quot;Person of the Year&quot; causing a rift between the Young Democrats and the more conservative Orange County Democratic Committee.

===Gainesville Eight===
Camil explained in an interview that the group received information that during the 1972 Republican National Convention, the government was going to shoot someone and blame it on the anti-war protesters. They were also going to raise the five drawbridges so that antiwar demonstrators would be trapped on Miami Beach and shot by police and soldiers. In response, Camil&#x27;s group planned to draw those police and soldiers away by attacking federal buildings, police stations, and fire stations in the two adjacent counties to occupy the government forces, then reopen bridges to aid escape of the demonstrators. These plans were typed up and distributed among the rest of the group by a member who was also an FBI informant. The eight members of Camil&#x27;s group were charged with conspiracy to disrupt the Republican National Convention.

The jury got to read the letter containing all the plans on attacking the federal buildings, but they also got to read the constantly repeated admonition, &quot;This will be done for defensive purposes only.&quot; The jury determined that their goal was to protect the rights of the protesters, and they found the eight men not guilty. In Camil&#x27;s words, &quot;We had no conspiracy to disrupt the convention. Our conspiracy, if you want to call it that, was to go down to the convention and exercise our Constitutional rights as citizens and to defend those rights against anybody who tried to take away those rights, whether it be the government or anyone else. And the jury sided with us.&quot;

The jury acquitted all eight after a long trial in 1973, taking only a few minutes to do so.

<text>Interleukin 10 (IL-10), also known as human cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor (CSIF), is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. In humans, interleukin 10 is encoded by the &quot;IL10&quot; gene. IL-10 signals through a receptor complex consisting of two IL-10 receptor-1 and two IL-10 receptor-2 proteins. Consequently, the functional receptor consists of four IL-10 receptor molecules. IL-10 binding induces STAT3 signalling via the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails of IL-10 receptor 1 + IL-10 receptor 2 by JAK1 and Tyk2 respectively.

== Gene and protein structure ==
The IL-10 protein is a homodimer; each of its subunits is 178-amino-acid long.

IL-10 is classified as a class-2 cytokine, a set of cytokines including IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24 (Mda-7), IL-26 and interferons type-I (IFN-alpha, -beta, -epsilon, -kappa, -omega), type-II (IFN-gamma) and type-III (IFN-lambda, including IL-28A, IL-28B, IL-29, and IFNL4).

== Expression and synthesis ==

In humans, IL-10 is encoded by the &quot;IL10&quot; gene, which is located on chromosome 1 and comprises five exons, and is primarily produced by monocytes and, to a lesser extent, lymphocytes, namely type-II T helper cells (TH2), mast cells, CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, and in a certain subset of activated T cells and B cells. IL-10 can be produced by monocytes upon PD-1 triggering in these cells. IL-10 upregulation is also mediated by GPCRs, such as beta-2 adrenergic and type 2 cannabinoid receptors. The expression of IL-10 is minimal in unstimulated tissues and seems to require triggering by commensal or pathogenic flora. IL-10 expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Extensive IL-10 locus remodeling is observed in monocytes upon stimulation of TLR or Fc receptor pathways. IL-10 induction involves ERK1/2, p38 and NF-κB signalling and transcriptional activation via promoter binding of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1. IL-10 may autoregulate its expression via a negative feed-back loop involving autocrine stimulation of the IL-10 receptor and inhibition of the p38 signaling pathway. Additionally, IL-10 expression is extensively regulated at the post-transcriptional level, which may involve control of mRNA stability via AU-rich elements and by microRNAs such as let-7 or miR-106.

== Function ==

IL-10 is a cytokine with multiple, pleiotropic, effects in immunoregulation and inflammation. It downregulates the expression of Th1 cytokines, MHC class II antigens, and co-stimulatory molecules on macrophages. It also enhances B cell survival, proliferation, and antibody production. IL-10 can block NF-κB activity, and is involved in the regulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.

Discovered in 1991, IL-10 was initially reported to suppress cytokine secretion, antigen presentation and CD4+ T cell activation. Further investigation has shown that IL-10 predominantly inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and bacterial product mediated induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-1β, IL-12, and IFNγ secretion from toll-like receptor (TLR) triggered myeloid lineage cells.

===Effect on tumors===
Over time a more nuanced picture of IL-10&#x27;s function has emerged as treatment of tumor-bearing mice has been shown to inhibit tumor metastasis. Additional investigation by multiple laboratories has generated data that further supports IL-10&#x27;s immunostimulatory capacity in an immunoncology context. Expression of IL-10 from transfected tumor cell lines in IL-10 transgenic mice or dosing with IL-10 leads to control of primary tumor growth and decreased metastatic burden. More recently, PEGylated recombinant murine IL-10 (PEG-rMuIL-10) has been shown to induce IFNγ and CD8+ T cell dependent anti-tumor immunity. More specifically, PEGylated recombinant human IL-10 (PEG-rHuIL-10) has been shown to enhance CD8+ T cell secretion of the cytotoxic molecules Granzyme B and Perforin and potentiate T cell receptor dependent IFNγ secretion.

== Role in disease==

A study in mice has shown that IL-10 is also produced by mast cells, counteracting the inflammatory effect that these cells have at the site of an allergic reaction.

IL-10 is capable of inhibiting synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-3, TNFα and GM-CSF made by cells such as macrophages and Th1 T cells. It also displays a potent ability to suppress the antigen-presentation capacity of antigen presenting cells; however, it is also stimulatory towards certain T cells (Th2) and mast cells and stimulates B cell maturation and antibody production.

IL-10 checks the inducible form of Cyclo-oxygenase, Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2). Lack of IL-10 has been shown to cause COX activation and resultant Thromboxane receptor activation to cause vascular endothelial and cardiac dysfunctions in mice. Interleukin 10 knockout frail mice develop cardiac and vascular dysfunction with increased age.

IL-10 is linked to the myokines, as exercise provokes an increase in circulating levels of IL-1ra, IL-10, and sTNF-R, suggesting that physical exercise fosters an environment of anti-inflammatory cytokines.

Lower levels of IL-10 have been observed in individuals diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when compared to healthy individuals. Due to a decrease in IL-10 levels, TNFα levels are not regulated effectively as IL-10 regulates the TNF-α-converting enzyme. As a result, TNFα levels rise and result in inflammation. TNFα itself induces demyelination of the oligodendroglial via TNF receptor 1, while chronic inflammation has been linked to demyelination of neurons.

In melanoma cell lines, IL-10 modulates the surface expression of NKG2D ligands.

In addition, Forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3) as a transcription factor is an essential molecular marker of regulatory T (Treg) cells. Foxp3 polymorphism (rs3761548) might be involved in cancer progression like gastric cancer through influencing Tregs function and the secretion of immunomodulatory cytokines such as IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-β.

A recent mouse study indicates that IL-10 regulates CD36, a key phagocytosis effector, promoting hematoma clearance after intracerebral hemorrhage. IL-10 deficiency aggravates traumatic brain injury in male but not female mice. 

===Clinical use or trials===
Knockout studies in mice suggested the function of this cytokine as an essential immunoregulator in the intestinal tract. and, indeed, patients with Crohn&#x27;s disease react favorably towards treatment with recombinant interleukin-10-producing bacteria, demonstrating the importance of IL-10 for counteracting the hyperactive immune response in the human body.

Due to the data, thousands of patients with a variety of autoimmune diseases were treated with recombinant human IL-10 (rHuIL-10) in clinical trials. Contrary to expectations, rHuIL-10 treatment did not significantly impact disease in patients with Crohn&#x27;s disease or rheumatoid arthritis. rHuIL-10 treatment initially exhibited promising clinical data in psoriasis, but failed to achieve clinical significance in a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled Phase II trial. Further investigation of rHuIL-10&#x27;s effects in humans suggests that rather than inhibiting inflammation, rHuIL-10 is capable of exerting pro-inflammatory effects.

====PEGylated forms====
Further to these data, a Phase I immunoncology clinical trial is currently being conducted to assess the therapeutic capacity of PEGylated recombinant human IL-10 (PEG-rHuIL-10, AM0010). Consistent with preclinical immunoncology data, investigators report substantial anti-tumor efficacy. Contrary to the reported immunosuppressive effects of IL-10 generated &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot;, treatment of cancer patients with PEG-rHuIL-10 elicits a dose titratable induction of the immune stimulatory cytokines IFNγ, IL-18, IL-7, GM-CSF and IL-4. Furthermore, treated patients exhibit fold increases of peripheral CD8+ T cells expressing markers of activation, such as programmed death 1 (PD1)+, lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3)+ and increased Fas Ligand (FasL) and a decrease in serum TGFβ. These findings are consistent with the published preclinical immunoncology reports using PEG-rMuIL-10 and with previous findings treating humans with rHuIL-10. These data suggest that while IL-10 can exert immunosuppressive effects in context of bacterial product stimulated myeloid cells, rHuIL-10/PEG-rHuIL-10 treatment of humans is predominantly immunostimulatory. AM0010 (aka pegilodecakin) is in phase 3 clinical trials.

=== Interactions ===

IL-10 has been shown to interact with Interleukin 10 receptor, alpha subunit.

The receptor complex for IL-10 also requires the IL10R2 chain to initiate signalling. This ligand–receptor combination is found in birds and frogs, and is also likely to exist in bony fish.

<text>WKDU (91.7 FM) is a non-commercial educational radio station licensed to serve Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is owned by Drexel University and operated by Drexel students, with several alumni among its on-air staff. It is the only free-format non-commercial FM station in Philadelphia. Its transmitter is located atop Van Rensselaer Hall, a dormitory on the Drexel campus, in the University City section of Philadelphia. Its studio is in the basement of the Creese Student Center. WKDU was the 2010 and 2011 CMJ Station of the Year.

==History==
Starting as carrier current station WMAX in 1958 (and later WXDT), WKDU began FM broadcasting on Saturday, July 17, 1971. In 1981, its power rating was raised from 10 watts to 110 watts, and in 1996, to 800 watts. WKDU originally shared time on its frequency with WPWT, a station established in the 1950s by Philadelphia Wireless Technical Institute. WPWT ceased operations in the late 1980s, allowing WKDU to extend its broadcast day to 24 hours on February 26, 1990. Previously, WKDU signed off between the hours of 2 PM to 10 PM.

WKDU gained Black listeners in the 1970s due to &quot;The Black Experience in Music&quot;, a group of Black students who called themselves &quot;communicators&quot;, rather than DJs, as they educated the Black communities in Drexel and Philadelphia about their cultural happenings. &quot;The Black Experience&quot; began in 1971 and responsible for much of the station&#x27;s programming through the 1980s. As of 2022, &quot;The Black Experience&quot; is still running weekly.

==Programming==
WKDU&#x27;s musical format is free-form, meaning that playlists are dictated by the taste of the on-air DJs. In 1984, a progressive requirement was created and implemented to the Free Format music programming policy by then Music Director, Ginny McCracken. Each DJ can play whatever they want but at least 1/3 of their music must be a &quot;new release&quot;.

WKDU is known for its annual Electronic Music Marathon, an event that raises money for charities in the Philadelphia area. The Electronic Music Marathon ran from 1997–2007, then returned in Fall 2014 after a seven-year hiatus.

The WKDU Reggae Marathon has been held annually since 1984, during the Memorial Day Weekend. This special program includes not just reggae, but other similar Caribbean genres, such as Soca.

A notable show on WKDU was &quot;Sounds of Jerusalem&quot; which ran from 1978 through 1994.

<text>The Lockheed Martin AN/AAS-35(V) Pave Penny is a laser spot tracker carried by US Air Force attack aircraft and fighter-bombers to enable them to track a laser spot on the ground. It is a receiver only, allowing the pilot to see which targets marked by a laser designator.

Pave Penny does not produce a laser beam and cannot be used to designate targets. It was designed to be used with designators on the ground or on other aircraft. PAVE was later used as an acronym for Precision Avionics Vectoring Equipment.

==Description==
The Pave Penny was developed in the mid-1970s based on the earlier AN/AVQ-11 Pave Sword laser tracker used on a few USAF F-4 Phantom IIs during the Vietnam War, miniaturized using solid-state electronics.

The compact (31 in / 78 cm) pod, which weighs only 32 lb (14.5 kg) is a simple laser spot tracker that searches for reflected laser light from other laser designators (used by friendly air or ground forces) and displays that target information on the aircraft heads-up display (HUD). Unlike the laser ranger and marked target seeker systems common to European aircraft, or the more sophisticated ASQ-228 ATFLIR, TIALD, and LANTIRN designators, the Pave Penny does not contain a laser. It can recognize specific laser designation signals based on pre-determined four-digit codes encoded into the laser pulse, allowing it to seek out particular targets and ignore others (to avoid, for example, several aircraft hitting the same target). There is no range-finding capability. The Pave Penny&#x27;s nominal range is 20 miles (32 km), although effective range is considerably shorter.

The Pave Penny pod was used by USAF A-7D Corsair II aircraft, fuselage-mounted beneath the engine intake, and the A-10 Thunderbolt II, mounted on an external pylon designed specifically for the pod. It was previously used by some F-16 aircraft, although most now use the LANTIRN system instead which permits self-designation. Some pods were also supplied to Singapore, where they were used on that nation&#x27;s A-4SU Super Skyhawks.

<text>The Gainesville Eight were a group of anti-Vietnam War activists indicted on charges of conspiracy to disrupt the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida. All eight defendants were acquitted. 

Vietnam Veterans Against the War had planned to demonstrate against the ongoing Vietnam War during the convention. After learning from FBI informants and agents within the VVAW about possible plans for disruption and violence, the Department of Justice initiated a grand jury investigation. Eight of the people investigated were indicted by the government on charges of conspiracy to disrupt the convention: John Briggs, Scott Camil, Alton Foss, John Kniffin, Peter Mahoney, Stanley Michelson, William Patterson, and Don Perdue. All but Briggs were Vietnam veterans.

While organizing protests, the group received information that during the convention the government was going to shoot someone or use explosives and blame it on the antiwar protesters. They were also going to raise the five drawbridges so that antiwar demonstrators would be trapped on Miami Beach and shot by police and soldiers during the commotion. In response to this information, the VVAW group planned to draw those police and soldiers away by attacking federal buildings, police stations, and fire stations in the two adjacent counties to occupy the government forces, then reopen bridges to aid escape of the demonstrators. These plans were typed up and distributed among the rest of the group by a VVAW member and undercover FBI agent, Bill Lemmer. The eight were accused of planning to use automatic weapons, explosives, incendiary devices, as well as slingshots and crossbows. 

The jury got to read the letter containing all the proposed plans on attacking the federal buildings, but they also got to read the constantly repeated admonition in the letter, &quot;This will be done for defensive purposes only.&quot; The jury saw that their goal was to protect the rights of the protesters, and they acquitted the eight men of all charges without the need for them to present a defense. In Camil&#x27;s words, &quot;We had no conspiracy to disrupt the convention. Our conspiracy, if you want to call it that, was to go down to the convention and exercise our Constitutional rights as citizens and to defend those rights against anybody who tried to take away those rights, whether it be the government or anyone else. And the jury sided with us.&quot;

Bill Lemmer, the Southern regional assistant coordinator of Vietnam Veterans Against the War, revealed himself as an undercover FBI operative in May 1972. Bill Lemmer had been thrown out of a &#x27;fast&#x27;/protest by DCVC(VVAW) on the Capitol steps in Washington D.C. in January 1972 after advocating for violent, destructive actions on the Washington Monument. A deposition to that effect was sent to the trial in Gainesville. During the 1973 trial it was revealed that the VVAW had been infiltrated by government agents and informants, such as Emmerson Poe and Lemmer. Showing that these agents provocateur led the illegal activities severely damaged the prosecution&#x27;s case. The prosecution also tried to use the defendant&#x27;s Vietnam records as indication that these were violent people.

The jury acquitted all eight after less than four hours of deliberation.

Jack Carrouth was one of the attorneys for the prosecution. Brady Coleman was one of the attorneys for the defense.

Folk singers Pete Seeger and Phil Ochs expressed support for the group, as did Ron Kovic.

<doc id="1050219" wikidata="Q626980" url="?curid=1050219" title="Workers' Communist Party (Norway)">
<text>The Workers&#x27; Communist Party (, AKP) was a Norwegian communist party (1973–2007). AKP was a Maoist party and one of two communist parties in Norway; the other was the older Communist Party of Norway which had remained pro-Soviet. The relationship between the two parties was characterized by strong hostility.

AKP was founded in 1973, as &quot;Arbeidernes Kommunistparti (marxist-leninistene)&quot;. It did not participate directly in elections, but members had &quot;activity duty&quot;, meaning that they were to work for the party&#x27;s goals – passive members were not accepted. The precise number of its members is unknown.
On 22 February 2006, the party opened some of its archives to the public, in a move the party argued was to hit out at all the rumours surrounding the party.

It was a predecessor of the current party the Red Party, founded on 10 March 2007.

== History ==

Two trends led to the formation of AKP(m–l):

*The radical movements of Western academic environments in the late 1960s and early 1970s, particularly within the context of the Vietnam War. 
*The Sino-Soviet split between the Soviet Union and China, which caused an ideological crisis among an older generation of communists. 

The founders of AKP(m–l) came from what was then known as SUF, or Sosialistisk Ungdomsforbund (Socialist Youth League). SUF had been started as the youth wing of the Sosialistisk Folkeparti, but broke away in 1969 as it developed into a marxist-leninist direction. Following the split SUF was renamed SUF(m–l).

As a result of the activity duty, many party members practiced &quot;self-proletarisation&quot; on the party&#x27;s orders, working as manual labourers, especially in the period from 1974 to 1976. Later, the party encouraged its well-educated members to take work as teachers, particularly in higher education.
As a part of their policy, AKP members have joined and tried to influence several voluntary organisations in socialist direction, particularly those related to &quot;feminism&quot;, labor unions and anti-racism.

AKP did not put its name on election ballots, choosing instead to work through Red Electoral Alliance (RV), originally AKPs electoral face, but from 1990 a party of its own without any formal link to AKP, though most of AKPs members were also members of RV.

In March 2007, AKP and Red Electoral Alliance (RV) merged, and formed the party Red, a revolutionary party with a programme supporting communism. Some former members of AKP have argued that since the party Red does not have activity duty or democratic centralism, it is not a communist party, while others have argued that a communist program and the fact that like traditional communist parties, Red is organized in cells, it is a communist party. Some former members of AKP, especially members of AKP&#x27;s student organization, NKS, formed a marxist-leninist front, KP(m–l) together with the Marxist-Leninist Group Revolusjon. This front was meant to be an organisation with the purpose of building a traditional marxist-leninist party.

&quot;Klassekampen&quot; (Class Struggle) used to be the party&#x27;s daily newspaper in the 1970s, but it has been associated with a slightly wider political spectrum since the 1990s. Red now owns 20% of the stocks in &quot;Klassekampen&quot;, the amount AKP owned before the merge with RV. AKP was also associated to Oktober Forlag, a publisher. From early 2000s the party published the monthly newspaper &quot;akp.no&quot;, named after the party&#x27;s website, and throughout its existence it published a quarterly magazine for Marxist debate, first named &quot;Røde Fane&quot; (Red Standard), then from 2005 &quot;Rødt!&quot; (Red! – this name might have inspired the name of the new party). The newspaper &quot;akp.no&quot; continues as Red&#x27;s party newspaper, under the name &quot;Rødt Nytt&quot; (Red News). The magazine &quot;Rødt!&quot; is continued under the ownership of the party Red. In 2017, it changed its name to &quot;Gnist&quot;.

== Controversy ==

AKP and the Norwegian ML-movement were at times criticised for support of Marxist and communist regimes in other parts of the world, including the regimes of Joseph Stalin, and Pol Pot. AKP openly endorsed the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia, and when that party&#x27;s forces invaded Phnom Penh, Klassekampen had &quot;Long live the free Cambodia&quot; as their front page headline. Support from AKP continued in spite of the killings which were reported during Pol Pot&#x27;s rule. At that time, AKP considered these reports to be a part of a smear campaign against the new regime, and AKP had delegations visiting the country.

Much of the party&#x27;s inner workings have been clandestine in nature, for instance the precise number of members is kept secret. The party program has been considered violent and extreme since it called for armed revolution before 1990, and kept the possibility of having to &quot;defend the revolution with arms&quot; open since.

In 2003, two former members of the party&#x27;s leadership, Finn Sjue and Egil Fossum, apologized for the totalitarian culture in the party.

<text>Stein Eriksen (11 December 1927 – 27 December 2015) was an alpine ski racer and Olympic gold medalist from Norway. Following his racing career, he was a ski school director and ambassador at various resorts in the United States.

==Background==
Eriksen was born 11 December 1927, in Oslo. His parents were Marius Eriksen (1886–1950) and Birgit Heien (1900–1996). Marius Eriksen competed in the 1912 Olympic Games as a gymnast. His brother, Marius Eriksen, Jr. (1922–2009), was an alpine skier and during World War II became a fighter ace in the Royal Norwegian Air Force. Stein Eriksen was the top slalom racer in Norway in 1949 and took bronze in the slalom at the 1950 World Championships in Aspen, Colorado.

==Sports career==

Eriksen won the gold medal in the giant slalom at the 1952 Winter Olympics, which was held in Oslo, Norway. He also won a silver medal in the slalom. Eriksen was the first male alpine ski racer from outside the Alps to win an Olympic gold medal. He also won three gold medals at the 1954 World Championships in Åre, Sweden.

Other accomplishments included being credited with devising &quot;aerials&quot;, a freestyle skiing event, and helping revolutionize the world of alpine skiing in the United States, where he served as a ski instructor at many different ski schools. At Sugarbush Resort in Vermont, each Sunday afternoon, combining his gymnastics background and his skiing, Stein would demonstrate a flip on skis. For his Olympic medals, Eriksen earned the Holmenkollen Medal in 1952.

It is said that Eriksen was skiing&#x27;s &quot;first superstar&quot;, since he was handsome, stylish and charismatic. Despite his fame, he maintained a very down-to-Earth personality. For example, he is quoted as saying, &quot;Be tough, be confident. But you will never be a whole and happy person if you aren&#x27;t humble&quot;.

==Life in the United States==
Shortly after his success in the 1952 Olympics, Eriksen moved to the United States where he lived until his death. While ski racing for Norway, he was a ski instructor at Sun Valley in Idaho. Following his racing career, he was the ski school director at various resorts, such as Boyne Mountain and Pine Knob, both in Michigan, Sugarbush in Vermont, Heavenly Valley in California, Snowmass and Aspen in Colorado, and Park City in Utah. At the time of his death he was the director of skiing at the Deer Valley Resort in Utah, and also served as host of the &quot;Stein Eriksen Lodge,&quot; a ski lodge in Deer Valley (not owned by Eriksen, but named in his honor). Eriksen was married to Gerrysue Eriksen then to Françoise and had five children: Julianna Eriksen, Ava, Stein Jr., Anja and Bjørn. He called both Utah and Montana home.

In 1997, Eriksen was honored by the King of Norway. He was knighted with the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit for his contribution to Norway, the highest honor that the Norwegian government can give to people living outside Norway.

Eriksen celebrated his 80th birthday December 2007 in Deer Valley. He died on 27 December 2015, sixteen days after his 88th birthday, in his Park City, Utah home.

<doc id="1050224" wikidata="Q2121979" url="?curid=1050224" title="Broad Hinton">
<text>Broad Hinton is a village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England, about southwest of Swindon. The parish includes the hamlets of Uffcott and The Weir.

==History==
There are several barrows in the parish, notably on Hackpen Hill. East of The Weir is a Romano-British burial site and possibly the remains of a house of that period.

Bincknoll Castle is an earthwork on a promontory on a chalk escarpment in the northernmost part of the parish. It is the remains of a fortified enclosure, possibly Romano-British in origin, that was re-used in the Middle Ages.

The Domesday Book of 1086 records that a man called Ranulph held the manor of Broad Hinton. It then passed to the Wase family and became known as Hinton Wase. In 1365 Nicholas Wase sold the manor to William Wroughton (died 1392), whose family then held Broad Hinton until 1628 when Sir Giles Wroughton sold it to Sir John Glanville, MP and later Speaker of the House of Commons. He was a cousin of John Evelyn&#x27;s wife, and the diarist visited him at Broad Hinton in 1654, noting that he was living in the manor&#x27;s gatehouse because he had burnt down his home to prevent the Roundheads setting up a garrison there during the Civil War. In 1709 a later John Glanville sold the manor to Thomas Bennet, from whom it descended &quot;via&quot; the female line through the Legh, Keck and Calley families. In 1839 James Calley sold Broad Hinton to the Duke of Wellington. In 1867 his son the 2nd Duke of Wellington sold Broad Hinton to N. Story-Maskelyne, who in 1869 sold it on to the former MP Sir Henry Meux, 2nd Baronet. Sir Henry died in 1900 and his widow Lady Meux had the manor broken up and auctioned in several lots in 1906.

==Parish church==
The Church of England parish church of Saint Peter ad Vincula (&quot;St Peter in Chains&quot;) is one of only 15 churches in England with this dedication, which is in honour of the Basilica of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome.

The earliest parts of the church building date from late in the 12th century. They include an Early English Gothic priest&#x27;s doorway, which was later moved from the chancel to the organ chamber. In the 13th century the chancel was rebuilt, the nave was altered and the church was dedicated to Saint Mary. The Perpendicular Gothic tower was built in the 15th or early in the 16th century. A rood stair was inserted early in the 16th century. The nave was re-roofed in 1634 and the east end of the chancel was altered or rebuilt in the 18th century.

In the 19th century the church was called St. Peter&#x27;s. In 1843 a pulpit, desk and stalls were designed for the church by the architect William Hinton Campbell; it is not known if these were ever made and, if so, whether they survive. The building was restored in 1879 to plans by the Gothic Revival architect C.E. Ponting of Marlborough. He had a new, wider chancel arch built and re-used the old one to link the chancel with the organ chamber. In 1958 the church was designated as Grade I listed.

===Monuments===
The church contains several imposing monuments, notably to members of the Wroughton and Glanville families.

There are indents of two lost brasses in the chancel, both knights in armour. The earlier was probably to William Wroughton (died 1392) and the later was certainly to his grandson, John Wroughton (died 1429).

The monument to John&#x27;s great-great-grandson, Sir William Wroughton (died 1559), is early Elizabethan, canopied, and shows influence of the previous Perpendicular Gothic style. Despite an inscription in praise of Queen Elizabeth, it includes subtle references to his Roman Catholic sympathies. The monument to his son, Sir Thomas Wroughton (died 1597) and his wife, is a large standing monument, with figures of Sir Thomas and Lady Wroughton kneeling in prayer and facing east. An old legend tells how Sir Thomas is shown with no hands because they withered away after he threw his wife&#x27;s Bible in the fire. He had returned home from hunting to find her reading it rather than making his supper and was not best pleased.

Colonel Francis Glanville, a younger son of Speaker Glanville, was a Royalist soldier in the English Civil War. He was killed in 1645 when a Parliamentarian force besieged the Royalist-held town of Bridgwater in Somerset. His monument at Broad Hinton is a standing alabaster statue, wearing armour and holding the metal staff of a standard. His real armour is displayed above the monument.

==Governance==
Broad Hinton and the adjacent parish of Winterbourne Bassett elect a joint parish council called Broad Hinton and Winterbourne Bassett. Most local government functions are carried out by the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions.

==Amenities==
Broad Hinton has an Italian restaurant, La Strada, and The Crown Inn, controlled by Arkell&#x27;s Brewery of Swindon. The village has a village shop and post office and a village hall. Local clubs include the White Horse Cricket Club.

Broad Hinton Church of England Primary School serves the parish and nearby villages. Beginning in 1743, Thomas Benet, a local landowner, paid for a schoolmaster, and in 1751 he provided a house for the school and teacher to use. A classroom was added in 1845 but in 1847 the older, thatched, part of the school burned down; a new school was immediately built in stone. This became a National School in 1882 and a voluntary controlled school in the 20th century.

==Another Broad Hinton==
This parish near Swindon should not be confused with Broad Hinton, a liberty in the civil parish of Hurst, Berkshire. That part of Hurst was a detached part of Wiltshire until the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844 transferred the liberty to Berkshire.

The brand existed in Japan from 1989 to 1996, when sales operations were integrated into ɛ̃fini, and Australia from 1992 to 1996, when it was integrated into the main Mazda model range as a premium sub-brand.

==History==
In the late 1980s, Mazda diversified in the Japan market with the launch of three new marques. The company created Autozam, Eunos, and ɛ̃fini, in addition to the Mazda and Ford brands already marketed by it there.

The Eunos marque, was marketed as a fun to drive, upscale brand compared to entry level Autozam, traditional Mazda products, and exclusive luxury brand ɛ̃fini. The name was derived for the ancient Greek &quot;eu&quot; meaning &quot;good&quot; and &quot;nos&quot;, an abbreviation of &quot;numbers&quot; in English, meant to signify a number, or assortment, of good things. The Marque was launched in Japan with the Eunos 500 in January, 1992 and many of the vehicles created were exported to other markets.

From 1991 until 1996, when the Eunos dealership was integrated into Mazda locations, Citroën products were sold to Japanese buyers, as well as Mazda&#x27;s ɛ̃fini locations.

This experiment was ended in the mid-1990s. Some of the vehicles sold under the Eunos brand were intended to be sold in North America under the Amati brand, but due to economic conditions, largely attributed to the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in 1991, Amati was not launched.

The Eunos name was brought back in 2020 for a limited edition of the Mazda MX-5 in France as the MX-5 Eunos Edition, a nod to how the original MX-5 was sold as the Eunos Roadster in Japan.

==Vehicles==
Eunos sold the following vehicles, all on common Mazda platforms:
* 1989 Eunos 100 (BG Mazda Familia)
* 1994 Mazda Lantis (CB)
* 1989 Eunos 300 (MA Mazda Persona)
* 1992–1993 Eunos 500 (CA Mazda Xedos 6)
* 1993–1996 Eunos 800 (TA Mazda Xedos 9/Mazda Millenia)
* 1990 Eunos Cargo (SS platform)
* 1990–1995 Eunos Cosmo (JC Mazda Cosmo)
* 1991–1993 Eunos Presso/30X (EC Mazda MX-3)
* 1989–1997 Eunos Roadster (NA Mazda MX-5)

<text>ɛ̃fini () was a luxury vehicle division of Japanese automaker Mazda that operated between 1991 and 1997 in Japan only. Its inception as a brand emerged in the late 1980s when Mazda diversified its sales channels in the Japanese market with the launch of three new marques. The company created Autozam, Eunos, and , in addition to the Mazda and Ford brands already marketed there. This selective marketing experiment ended in the mid-1990s due to economic conditions, largely attributed to the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in 1991. As a brand, encompassed most, if not all dealers formerly under the &quot;Mazda Auto Store&quot; dealership network established in 1959 when the Mazda R360 was introduced. Pronounced like the French word &quot;infini&quot;, the name is written with a tilde over the lowercase Greek &quot;ε&quot; (as in &quot;ɛ̃&quot;), and can therefore be assumed to be IPA, the pronunciation symbols taught in Japan, and sometimes used in product naming. 

The three sedans offered started with the letters &quot;MS&quot;, which represented the Greek phrase &quot;Megáles Sképseis&quot; (μεγάλες σκέψεις) which translated into English means &quot;great thoughts&quot; according to the Japanese Wikipedia translated article.

The marque was a luxury-oriented brand, as opposed to the more mainstream, fun to drive Eunos brand, traditional Mazda, and entry level Autozam. The vehicles sold did not comply with Japanese government exterior and engine displacement regulations which classed all vehicles sold as as exclusive luxury products. The length of the MS-6 was the same as the MS-8 at . Both shared the V6 2.0 L, while the MS-6 offered the convenience of a hatchback bodystyle, and the MS-8 offered space efficiency of bench seats for both front and rear passengers and the open-air feeling of a hardtop sedan bodystyle.

The name and logo are not to be confused with several limited-edition second generation (FC) RX-7s, the &quot;Infini&quot; edition (marked with an infinity sign &quot;∞&quot;), from the late 1980s.

From 1991 until 1997, when the dealership was integrated into Mazda locations, Citroën products were sold to Japanese buyers, as well as Mazda&#x27;s Eunos locations. Currently, there are a few Japanese Mazda dealerships that still maintain the sales channels, but sell Mazda-branded products.

== Models ==
* MS-6 hatchback — 1991–1994 (based on Mazda Cronos sedan; Mazda 626 hatchback for export)
* MS-8 sedan — 1992–1997 (only unique model to the brand)
* MS-9 sedan — 1991–1993 (rebadged Mazda Sentia)
* RX-7 coupe — 1991–1997 (rebadged Mazda RX-7)
* MPV minivan — 1991–1997 (rebadged Mazda MPV)
* Citroën XM
* Citroën Xantia

<text>Younus Qanooni (, born on 10 May 1957 in Panjshir Valley) is an Afghan politician who was Vice President of Afghanistan. An ethnic Tajik, Qanooni is the leader of the &quot;Afghanistan e Naween&quot; (New Afghanistan) political party and former Speaker of the House of the People (the lower house of parliament or Wolesi Jirga).

==Biography==

Following the Soviet Intervention of Afghanistan in 1979, Qanooni joined with the mujahideen force led by Ahmad Shah Massoud based in his native Panjshir Valley. He was involved in the creation of the Afghan Northern Alliance and served as Interior Minister in Burhanuddin Rabbani&#x27;s government. After the assassination of Massoud in 2001, a trio consisting of Qanooni, Defence Minister Mohammed Fahim and Foreign Minister Dr Abdullah took de facto control of the Northern Alliance and its financial resources.

==Political career==

The United States backed the Northern Alliance with air support in Afghanistan in 2001. In 2001, Qanuni served as chief negotiator for the Afghan Northern Alliance delegation to the Bonn conference on Afghanistan in Bonn, Germany.

Immediately after the fall of the Taliban government, Qanuni was interior minister in an interim administration. He was eventually made the education minister in the Afghan Transitional Administration (established in June 2002), and served as a security advisor to interim President Hamid Karzai. Along with Fahim and Abdullah, Qanuni was seen as one of the dominant figures of the Transitional Administration

Elections for a permanent government were scheduled for 2004. When Qanuni&#x27;s ally Mohammed Fahim was passed over as vice-presidential running mate of Karzai, Qanuni entered the race for the presidency himself. On October 5, 2004, Qanuni&#x27;s campaign supporter, Abdul Aziz, was assassinated while in Shindand, Afghanistan.

In the election, held October 9, 2004, he placed second to Karzai. On December 23, 2004, the newly inaugurated Karzai announced his administration, and both Qanuni and Fahim were dropped from their Ministerial posts.

Qanuni was elected in the 2005 Afghan Parliamentary elections, placing second in the Kabul province. Since the presidential election he has generally been seen as the spokesman of the formerly powerful Tajik ethnic group, which dominated the Northern Alliance and the Transitional Afghan Administration, but was largely sidelined after the 2004 presidential election. As well as his own party, Qanuni has formed an alliance of several parties called the &quot;Jabahai Tafahim Millie&quot;.

On December 21, Qanuni was chosen to lead the 249-seat lower house of parliament with 122 votes against 117 for his closest challenger, Abdul Rasul Sayyaf.

<doc id="1050236" wikidata="Q789333" url="?curid=1050236" title="Autozam">
<text>was a brand of Japanese automaker Mazda, specializing in small cars and Kei cars, many of which were rebadged Suzuki models. Autozam also briefly acted as importer of Lancia vehicles to Japan.

The Autozam dealership channel is still in operation in some Japanese locations, but sell all current Mazda products.

==Overview==
In the late 1980s, Mazda began expansion of dealerships in Japan. The idea was to create &quot;a familiar car shop in your city&quot; (あなたの街の身近なカーショップ; &quot;Anata no machi no midjikana kāshoppu&quot;) and network of dealerships, centred around small and medium-sized maintenance shops and used car dealers. In part of this brand strategy, Mazda launched of three new marques. The company created Autozam, Eunos, and ɛ̃fini, in addition to the Mazda and Ford brands already marketed there.

Autozam&#x27;s lineup - at the time of establishment - was centered on small cars (i.e. Kei cars and compacts). Autozam&#x27;s first flagship model was the Autozam Clef, a sedan of Mazda Cronos lineage.

In addition, Mazda acquired the official import rights of Lancia for the purpose of supplementing the luxury car lineup. At the same time, Garage Italya also imported and sold Lancias through its own sales network. Lancia and Autobianchi brand passenger cars manufactured by the Italian Fiat Auto, such as the Lancia Thema, Lancia Delta and Autobianchi Y10, were also on sale.

The nationwide sales network was controlled by &quot;Autozam Co., Ltd.&quot; and a regional wholesale company (Autozam Co., Ltd.).

Autozam&#x27;s first sales hit was the second-generation Carol, which became popular with young female buyers, partly due to targeted advertising. The Revue and Clef models ended up redesigned to follow the character of the much successful Carol. However, the sales of Revue and Clef ended up being disastrously sluggish, as they were completely unpopular except for a few young female users.

Some of the light sports cars, such as Autozam AZ-1 and the small specialty car Autozam AZ-3 were also critically and publicly applauded, but did not translate to good sales. For short time, Autozam imported Lancia cars to Japan as a high-margin luxury car line. Lancia sales too were disappointing, as Japanese import buyers did not like buying their cars from showrooms sharing space with the cheerful and cute Autozam Carol.

As a result, there was no Autozam product that was profitable except for the second generation Carol. Even the future Carol models were not as popular as the 2nd generation because it became a half-finished retro-feature concept with a slightly regressed fancy flavor when it was fully remodelled in the 3rd generation. 

Among the Mazda 5 channel dealers, where the core model Cronos ended in a big failure, only the éfini RX-7 was really popular. The sales of the best-selling Ford Festiva plummeted after the full model change, as with Autozam Carol. Autozam had become seriously unprofitable, even more so than the Eunos store, which only product was the Eunos Roadster. This caused the management of the Mazda headquarters was severely distressed.

==Transition to &quot;Mazda Autozam store&quot;==

Of the marquees created by Mazda - the so-called 5-channel system - Autozam name was one of the few that survived. But in 1998, certain standards were set for the dealership size and sales of Autozam stores nationwide.

The dealerships were changed to &quot;Mazda Autozam store&quot; and started selling the products under the parent company Mazda name. At first, these dealerships mainly sold the Familia, Bongo and the Premacy. In addition, the Mazda-Autozam dealerships started OEM sales of Suzuki automobiles.

During the channel reorganization period, the Autozam store, which could not be transferred to the Mazda Autozam store, handled only light cars and Demio with the sign as it was, but as new models, AZ-Offroad and Laputa are sold together with the Mazda Autozam store.

After these two cars, new models were no longer introduced to the &quot;Autozam store&quot;, and in order to handle the new models after that, it was necessary to move to the Mazda Autozam store.

Stores that did not meet the standards returned their dealership rights without being given the right to sell new models. As a result, by the early 2000s, about 900 Autozam stores had changed to 350 Mazda Autozam stores.

In addition, Lancia&#x27;s regular import rights were returned by 1998. In 2001, Autozam Co., Ltd. and a regional wholesale company merged to form &quot;Mazda Autozam Co., Ltd.&quot;, and one company nationwide controlled the sales network.

After that, we started handling Axela in 2003 and MPV, Tribute, and Bongo Friendee in March 2004. Other Mazda channels (Mazda store, Mazda éfini store) are now handling Carol Spiano, AZ-Wagon, and Scrum, which were exclusive to Autozam, and the differentiation from other sales channels has disappeared.

From April 2016, we will start handling Atenza, Roadster, Familia Van, and Titan, which are the top models of Mazda vehicles that have not been sold so far. As a result, although the name of the Mazda Autozam store remains, it has become a de facto unification of domestic sales channels. As a result, &quot;Mazda Autozam Co., Ltd.&quot; has suspended its operations, and Mazda itself and the Mazda éfini and Mazda stores in each region will supervise and manage the nationwide sales network.

==Autozam models==
The following vehicles were part of the Autozam brand. Those that were rebadged versions are noted in parentheses.
* 1990–1998 Autozam Carol keicar (rebodied Suzuki Alto)
* 1990–1994 Autozam Revue subcompact car (Mazda 121)
* 1990–1997 Autozam Scrum mini MPV (Suzuki Carry)
* 1991–1998 Autozam AZ-3 coupé (Mazda MX-3)
* 1992–1993 Autozam Clef sedan (Mazda Cronos)
* 1992–1994 Autozam AZ-1 mid-engine sports car (Suzuki Cara)
* 1994–1997 Autozam AZ-Wagon station wagon (Suzuki Wagon R, later sold as a Mazda)

The Mazda AZ-Wagon continued to use the &quot;AZ&quot; name until 2003, while the Mazda AZ-Offroad mini SUV (a rebadged Suzuki Jimny) was introduced in 1998, continuing to carry on Autozam&#x27;s naming conventions.

==Lancia imports==

Autozam locations also briefly sold Lancia products to Japanese buyers. The vehicles sold are listed below. Of the Lancia products sold, only the top level Thema didn&#x27;t comply with Japanese Government exterior and engine displacement regulations to encourage sales, giving Japanese buyers who visited Autozam locations an alternative to the Autozam Clef, which also exceeded width dimensions.

<text>Jana Bohumila Wendt ( ; born 9 May 1956) is an Australian Gold Logie award-winning television journalist, reporter and writer.

==Early life==
Wendt was born in Melbourne to Czech parents who emigrated to Australia in 1949, as political refugees on account of her father&#x27;s work as a journalist for a Czech dissident newspaper.

Wendt attended Presentation College, Windsor before graduating at the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Arts (French, Honours) in 1979.

==Career==
Starting as a researcher for the ABC, Wendt&#x27;s television career began as a journalist for ATV-10 evening news, before sharing presenting duties with David Johnston.

In 1982, Wendt then went on to be one of the first reporters on the Australian Nine Network&#x27;s version of &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, as well as filing stories for the American CBS &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

Wendt took over in 1987 as host of &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, also on Nine, until November 1992, and was host of Australian &quot;Dateline&quot; on SBS and &quot;Witness&quot; on Seven.

She also did a number of specials for the ABC. She returned to Channel Nine in 2003 to host &quot;Sunday&quot;.

===Departure from Nine Network===
Rumours of Wendt&#x27;s departure from Nine began in June 2006, when the network announced it would merge its &quot;Sunday&quot; and &quot;Business Sunday&quot; programs. Leaks to the print media, reportedly from high levels within Nine and described by journalists as &quot;ham-fisted&quot;, revealed that the network wanted to replace Wendt with Ellen Fanning. Then CEO Eddie McGuire in particular was accused of trying to &quot;white-ant&quot; Wendt. On 1 September 2006, it was announced that Wendt would leave the Nine Network. News reports suggested she would receive a payout of more than A$2 million in lieu of the remaining two and a half years of her contract.

The absence of Wendt on the &quot;Sunday&quot; program&#x27;s relaunch on 3 September 2006 was met with an unprecedented number of complaints that flooded the Nine Network&#x27;s switchboard.

Wendt was then sacked from her regular &quot;Lunch&quot; column for &quot;The Bulletin&quot; magazine, due to the association the magazine has with the Nine Network; both had the same parent company, PBL.

On 12 September 2006, just ten days after she left the Nine Network, Wendt agreed to appear on stage at the Seven Network&#x27;s &quot;50 Years of Television&quot; presentation, where she co-presented the News and Current Affairs section with Sydney news presenter Ian Ross, another former Nine Network employee.

Delivering the second Andrew Olle Media Lecture in 1997, Wendt said of the profession:

Wendt presented the Logies Hall of Fame award to the program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; at the 2018 Logies.

==Personal life==
Wendt married producer Brendan Ward in 1984 and they have one son, Daniel.

In 2004, a painting of Wendt by artist Evert Ploeg won the Packing Room Prize at the Archibald Prize.

==Awards==
Wendt won the 1992 Gold Logie Award for her role as host of &quot;A Current Affair&quot;. She was not at the presentation to accept her award, citing commitments to &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, based in Sydney, while the awards were being presented in Melbourne.

Wendt won a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2018 Kennedy Awards.

==Books published==
* &quot;A Matter of Principle – New Meetings with the Good, the Great and the Formidable&quot;, Melbourne University Press, 2007. .
* &quot;Nice Work&quot;, Melbourne University Press, 2010.

<text>Winterbourne Bassett is a small village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England, about southwest of Swindon and northwest of Marlborough.

The village lies just west of the A4361 road between Swindon and Devizes, about north of Avebury. The minor road through the village continues west to Clyffe Pypard.

== History ==
The remains of a Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age stone circle lie largely hidden on a low ridge, about northwest of the village. The ancient trackway known as The Ridgeway crosses the east of the parish.

In 1086, Domesday Book recorded 37 households at &quot;Wintreburne&quot;, and land held by Amesbury Abbey. The name Winterbourne refers to seasonal streams in the area, which meet to form the upper waters of the River Kennet. The Bassett suffix is from lords of the manor in the 12th and 13th centuries, and distinguishes the parish and village from Winterbourne Monkton, close by to the south.

Winterbourne manor was granted in 1194 to Alan Basset (d.1232/3), whose name appears in Magna Carta as an advisor to the king. The manor was inherited in turn by his sons Gilbert (d.1241), Fulk (later bishop of London, d.1259) and Philip (Justiciar of England, d.1271). Philip&#x27;s daughter Aline married Hugh le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer (d.1265) and thus the manor was inherited by her son Hugh Despenser the Elder (advisor to Edward I, executed 1326). The manor reverted to the Crown; the Wiltshire Victoria County History traces its later ownership. The present manor house, just north of the church, was built in brick in the late 18th century.

There were further settlements at Rabson (southeast of Winterbourne Bassett) and Richardson (southwest). Rabson probably dwindled to a single farmstead by the 16th century; the house known as Rabson Manor, 400m south of the church and now surrounded by farm buildings, dates from the early 17th century.

Richardson (Ricardestone in 1242) was further south. The site of the deserted village – a scheduled monument – survives as building platforms, enclosures and tracks, one leading to a ford across the river. A country house here was demolished in the 19th century.

==Local government==
Winterbourne Bassett and the larger adjacent parish of Broad Hinton elect a joint parish council called Broad Hinton and Winterbourne Bassett. It falls within the area of the Wiltshire Council, a unitary authority which is responsible for all significant local government functions.

== Parish church ==

There was a church by 1121, linked to Lewes Priory. Fulk Basset was rector from c.1214 to c.1239. The church was dedicated to St Catherine in the 16th century but was known as St Peter&#x27;s in 1848; since 1904 the dedication has been to St Katherine and St Peter. The present parish church is a rebuilding from the 14th century; its only earlier features are the font – 12th century or early 13th – and a limestone grave slab of the late 13th century.

The nave and chancel are in random sarsen while the 15th-century four-stage west tower is in limestone ashlar. Many of the furnishings, including the oak pulpit and reader&#x27;s desk, are 17th-century. Renovation in 1857-8 saw replacement of the roofs, but the rest of the structure and most of the windows were retained; the northwest window of the chancel has fragments of 14th or 15th-century glass. There are three bells, one cast in 1583 and the others in the 19th century. The church was designated as Grade I listed in 1958.

Pevsner writes that the church has &quot;excellent Decorated work&quot;. He notes that the Despensers were lords of the manor at the time, and that the north transept with its &quot;unusually dainty detail&quot; may have been their chapel.

The benefice was united with Berwick Bassett in 1929, although the parishes remained separate; the incumbent was to live at the Winterbourne Bassett parsonage. The union was dissolved in 1951 and the benefice was held in plurality with Broad Hinton. In 1975 a team ministry was created for the area, and today the parish is part of the Upper Kennet Benefice, alongside seven others around Avebury.

==Amenities==
There was a small school in the village from 1875 to 1966; primary school children now go to Broad Hinton. A Methodist chapel was built in 1904 and sold in 1960.

The village has a public house and restaurant called The Winterbourne, owned by a community benefit society.

<text>Helena Ivanovna Roerich (; (Шапошникова); – 5 October 1955) was a Russian theosophist, writer, and public figure. In the early 20th century, she created, in cooperation with the Teachers of the East, a philosophic teaching of Living Ethics (&quot;Agni Yoga&quot;). She was an organizer and participant of cultural activity in the U.S., conducted under the guidance of her husband, Nicholas Roerich. Along with her husband, she took part in expeditions of hard-to-reach and little-investigated regions of Central Asia. She was an Honorary President-Founder of the Institute of Himalayan Studies &quot;Urusvati&quot; in India and co-author of the idea of the International Treaty for Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historical Monuments (Roerich Pact). She translated two volumes of the &quot;Secret Doctrine&quot; of H. P. Blavatsky, and selected Mahatma&#x27;s Letters (&quot;Cup of the East&quot;), from English to Russian.

==Early life==
Roerich was born in the family of Ivan Ivanovich Shaposhnikov, a well-known Saint-Petersburg architect.

Her mother Ekaterina Vassilievna Shaposhnikova belonged to an ancient Golenischev-Kutuzov family, which originated from Novgorod at the end of the 13th century. Significant members of this family included field marshal Mikhail Illarionovich Golenischev-Kutuzov, a well-known poet of the end of 19th century; Arsenii Arkadievich Golenischev-Kutuzov, composer; and Modest Petrovich Mussorgsky.

Roerich grew up and was educated in the rich cultural traditions of her family. From childhood she was inquisitive, and independent. She showed talents in a number of areas, playing piano, and by the age of seven reading and writing in three languages./ From a very young age, she started reading artistic, historical, spiritual and philosophic books.

In 1895, Roerich graduated from Mariinsky Gymnasium in Saint Petersburg with a &quot;gold medal&quot;, a special award for excellence in study. Though the education she received there was of a great quality, Roerich often studied additionally on her own. She learned painting, knew Russian and European literature well, studied the history of religion and philosophy, and took great interest in the works of the Indian philosophers Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, and Rabindranath Tagore, whose great-niece, Devika Rani Choudhuri, would later marry her son, Svetoslav.

After finishing her education at gymnasium, she entered the Saint Petersburg private school of music, headed by the pianist I.A. Borovka. He was a noted figure in Petersburg&#x27;s musical culture of the time, and personally mentored Roerich.

After graduating, which was aimed mainly towards revealing the most gifted candidates who should receive higher music education, Roerich intended to continue her education in the Saint Petersburg conservatoire, but her relatives banned this, worried that she would be interested by the revolutionary ideas found in the student environment. Thus, Roerich continued her education at home, where she perfected her grasp of foreign languages, and read many things.

==Marriage and family==
Roerich and her mother often spent the summer at Bologoye in the Novgorod region, with her aunt E.V. Putyatina, at the estate of her husband, Prince P.A. Putyatin. In 1899, at Bologoye, she met the painter and archeologist Nicholas Konstantinovich Roerich. They fell in love, and in spite of her relatives&#x27; opposition, in 1901, she and Nicholas were married in Saint Petersburg.

In 2001, at the place in Bologoye where they first met, a memorial named &quot;Monument of love&quot; was established. It contains a quotation from N. Roerich&#x27;s essay &quot;The University&quot;: &quot;I met Lada, my partner in life and inspirer, at Bologoye, at Prince P.A. Putyatin&#x27;s estate. Joy!&quot;. This was a strong alliance of two loving people united by deep mutual feelings and common views. N. Roerich wrote about their marriage in his declining years: &quot;We passed amicably any obstacles. And the obstacles turned into possibilities. I devoted my books: &#x27;To Helena, my wife, friend, partner and inspirer&#x27;&quot;. Many of Roerich&#x27;s paintings were a result of their common creativity. He called her &quot;She who leads&quot; in his books, and asserted that on many his canvases, two signatures should be written: his own, and hers. &quot;We created together, and not without reason it was said that the works must have two names, women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s.

The couple had two children. In August 1902, their eldest son George was born. Later, he became a world-renowned scientist and orientalist. Their younger son, Svetoslav, was born in October 1904. He became a painter.

Roerich supported all of her husband&#x27;s initiatives, and went deeply into all his fields of study. In 1903 and 1904, they traveled together through forty old Russian cities to find sources of national history and culture. During these travels, Roerich took expert photographs of churches, architecture monuments, paintings, and ornaments. She also mastered the art of restoration and, together with Nicholas Konstantinovich, recovered some the masterpieces of great artists such as Rubens, Breughel, Van Dijck, and Belgian artist Bernard van Orley, that had been hidden by later paint layers. She also displayed her artistic intuition by collecting works of art and antiquities. Roerich built a beautiful family collection, composed of more than 300 works, which they later had transferred to the Hermitage Museum. Roerich also knew archeology. Together with her husband, she often left for excavations in the regions of Novgorod and Tver, taking part in the work.

Her husband and sons thought highly of her, revering her as the spiritual leader and keeper of the family&#x27;s foundations. In 1916, because of a serious lung disease, following the doctor&#x27;s insistence, she and the Roerich family moved to Finland (Serdobol), to the seashore of Lake Ladoga. In 1918, Finland declared its independence and closed the Russian border. In 1919, the family moved to England where they made their home in London.

Here, in 1920, Roerich, in collaboration with a group of anonymous Eastern thinkers and philosophers, which in accordance with Indian&#x27;s spiritual tradition were named &quot;The Great Teachers&quot; (Mahatmas), began to work for the Living Ethics group, teaching Agni Yoga.

==Travels==
In 1920, N. Roerich was invite to tour the United States with an exhibition of his paintings. Thus, the family moved to New York City. Here, the cultural activity was organized under N. Roerich&#x27;s leadership in partnership with his wife. The culmination of this was the foundation in America of the Nicholas Roerich Museum, the Master Institute of United Arts, the International Painters Association &quot;Cor Ardens&quot; (Flaming Hearts), and the International Art Centre &quot;Corona Mundi&quot; (&quot;Crown of the World&quot;).

In December 1923, the family moved to India. This country had always been of great interest to the Roerichs. Adoration of India and its spiritual culture was not unusual among some Russian intellectuals of the time, feeling that their moral searches coincided with Indian spiritual tradition.

From 1924 to 1928, H. Roerich took part in a Central Asian expedition organized by N. K. Roerich, that traveled through hard-to-reach and little-investigated regions of India, China, Russia-Altai, Mongolia and Tibet. During the expedition, they researched topics such as history, archeology, ethnography, history of philosophy, arts and religions, and geography. Previously unknown mountain peaks and passes were mapped, rare manuscripts were found, and rich linguistic materials were collected. Special attention was paid to revealing the historical unity of cultures of various peoples. The expedition was carried out in very difficult conditions. Roerich shared all hardships of the travel with the others: hard passages, robber attacks, and obstacles created by English officials that nearly resulted in death of the expedition. In April 1925. when N. Roerich&#x27;s expedition stayed in Gulmarg, Helena Roerich began to translate an extensive selection from Blavatsky&#x27;s &quot;Mahatma&#x27;s Letters&quot; from English to Russian, which she published in London in 1923. She also wrote a book named &quot;Chalice of the East&quot;, which was published that year under the pen name &quot;Iskander Khanum&quot;.

Roerich&#x27;s manuscript &quot;Foundations of Buddhism&quot; was published in 1926, at Urga (now Ulan-Bator), where her expedition was staying at the time. In this book, the fundamental philosophical notions of Buddha&#x27;s teaching were interpreted. The book also spoke about the moral basis of this teaching and helped spark interest in Buddhism in the West.

In 1927, one of the Living Ethics books (&quot;Community&quot;) was published in the same place in Mongolia. After finishing of Central Asian expedition, the Roerichs remained in India, in Kullu valley Himachal Pradesh. There, in 1928, they founded an Institute of Himalayan Studies &quot;Urusvati&quot; (this means &quot;Light of Morning Star&quot; in Sanskrit). It was planned as an institute for complex study of Asian regions which exerted influence on the development of world culture. Among the tasks of Urusvati was the complex study of the psychic and physiological features of a human. Roerich became an Honorary President-Founder of the institute and actively took part in organizing its work. Being a subtle art connoisseur and deep philosopher, she knew well the scientific problems of the institute, and often directed the researches as an experienced scientist. The main task of Roerich&#x27;s activity was in studying the ancient philosophic thought of the East.

Helena Roerich had dreamed that a city of knowledge would rise in Kullu valley, which would become an international scientific centre. Later Urusvati became a large international institute that united well-known scientists from many countries. J. Bose, R. Tagore, A. Einstein, R. Millikan, L. de Broglie, R. Magoffin, S. Gedin, S.I. Metalnikov, N.I. Vavilov &quot;et al.&quot; had collaborated with it.

In Kullu, Roerich continued her work on Living Ethics, the main work of her life. In 1929, her work &quot;Cryptograms of the East&quot; (&quot;On Eastern Crossroads&quot;) was published in Paris in Russian under the pen name Josephine Saint Hilaire. This work contains apocryphal legends and parables from the lives of great devotees and teachers of mankind: Buddha, Christ, Apollonius of Tyana, Akbar the Great, Russian saintSergius of Radonezh. Roerich devoted a special essay &quot;The Banner of St. Sergius of Radonezh&quot; to an image of the Savior and Defender of Russian land. In this essay she joined knowledge of history and theology with deep and reverent love of the hermit. The essay was included in the book &quot;Banner of St. Sergius of Radonezh&quot;, published under the pen name N. Yarovskaya in 1934.

==Later life==
In the first half of the 1930s, Roerich translated two volumes of H.P. Blavatsky&#x27;s fundamental work &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot; from English to Russian.

A special place in Roerich&#x27;s creativity belongs to her epistolary heritage. She corresponded with more than 140 persons over several continents. Among Roerich&#x27;s correspondents were friends, followers, cultural workers and political figures. In her letters, Roerich answered numerous questions, explained the most complex philosophical and scientific problems, and the foundations of the Living Ethics. She wrote about the great Laws of the Cosmos, the meaning of human life, the importance of culture for human evolution, and the Great Teachers.

In 1940, a two-volume edition of &quot;Letters of Helena Roerich&quot; was published in Riga. A complete set of Roerich&#x27;s letters is published by the International Centre of the Roerichs, where her epistolary heritage is kept. It was transferred to ICR (Intelligent Character Recognition software) by S.N. Roerich in 1990.

During N.K. Roerich&#x27;s Manchurian expedition, she had corresponded with international organizations and coordinated activity to support the Roerich Pact, an international agreement for protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments. As a result of this work, the Roerich Pact was signed on 15 April 1935 by heads of 22 countries.

In January 1948, after her husband&#x27;s death, Roerich, together with her elder son, moved to Delhi and then to Khandala, Bombay, where they waited for a steam ship from Russia with their entrance visas. But Russia denied their visas. They made their home in Kalimpong in West Bengal, though she continued to hope to return to Russia. Unfortunately, her numerous applications were ignored.

==Death==
Roerich died on 5 October 1955. In the place of her cremation the lamas raised a white stupa on which the following epitaph was carved: &quot;Helena Roerich, the wife of Nicholas Roerich, thinker and writer, old friend of India&quot;.

== Legacy ==

=== Minor planet ===


On 15 October 1969 a minor planet of Solar System was discovered by astronomers of Crimean Astrophysical Observatory Nikolai Stepanovich and Lyudmila Ivanovna Chernykh. This planet was named in honor of Roerichs family. It was numbered 4426.

===Other===
On 6 July 1978 group of alpinists renamed a pass between the peaks &quot;Roerich&quot; and Belukha &quot;Urusvati&quot; in honor of Helena Roerich.

On 9 October 1999, during jubilee celebrations devoted to 125th anniversary of N. K. Roerich&#x27;s birthday and the 120th anniversary of her birthday, a monument was established near the entrance of the International Centre of the Roerichs. This monument is a sculpture of Nicholas Konstantonovich and Helena Roerich.

In 1999, the International Centre of the Roerichs instituted a jubilee medal &quot;Helena Roerich&quot; dedicated to the 120th anniversary of H. I. Roerich.

In April 2003, the college of arts named after Roerich began to work in the building of the &quot;Urusvati&quot; Institute (India).

In 2005, the Helena Roerich Museum was opened in a retired two-storeyed mansion known as &quot;Crookety House&quot; in Kalimpong. Here Roerich worked during the last years of her life. Opening of the museum was timed to the 50th anniversary of her death.

A public library named after Roerich was founded in the Altaic village of Ust-Koksa. In 2007, the library held nearly 75 thousand publications. More than 1600 persons have used its service. From 2003, the library has been a member of the Russian Library Association and collective member of international library association IFLA.

A charitable foundation named after her was created in 2001 in Moscow to finance programs dedicated to popularising Roerich&#x27;s heritage and the development of cultural activities. The foundation furthers activity in the field of education, science, culture, art, and enlightenment. One of the directions of the foundation&#x27;s activity is the revelation of young talents in various fields of art and helping them to protect and develop their creative abilities. An international award named after Roerich was instituted by the foundation bearing her name, to encourage scientific research connected to her scientific and philosophic heritage.

<text>The MAS-49 is a French semi-automatic rifle that replaced various bolt-action rifles as the French service rifle that was produced from 1949. It was designed and manufactured by the government-owned MAS arms factory. The French Army formal designation of the MAS-49 is Fusil semi-automatique 7 mm 5 M. 49 (&quot;semi-automatic rifle of 7.5 mm model 1949&quot;).

The initial MAS-49 semi-automatic rifle was produced in limited quantities (20,600 units), whereas the shorter and lighter variant, the MAS-49/56, was mass-produced (275,240 units) and issued to all branches of the French military. Overall, the MAS-49 and 49/56 rifles gained the reputation of being accurate, reliable and easy to maintain in adverse environments. All the MAS-49 and 49/56 rifles feature a rail on the left side of their receivers to accommodate a designated rifle scope.

The MAS-49 and MAS-49/56 were replaced as French service rifles by the FAMAS assault rifle in 1979.

==History==
The MAS-49 arrived after a series of small, distinct design improvements. Today, this might be termed spiral development, where small elements are changed with successive models, rather than large significant changes. The MAS-49 semi-automatic rifle evolved from the prototype MAS-38/39 and from the MAS-40, and lastly from the post-war MAS-44 and its minor variants 44A, 44B and 44C. Although 50,000 MAS-44 rifles were ordered in January 1945, only 6,200 were delivered to the French Navy. The MAS-49 was formally adopted by the French Army in July 1949. Its final form the MAS 49-56 was the French service rifle until adoption of the FAMAS.

As a service rifle, the MAS-49 replaced the diverse collection of aging bolt-action rifles (MAS-36, Lee–Enfield No4, M1903A3 Springfield, U.S. M1917, Berthier, and K98k) which had been absorbed into French service after the end of World War II. It saw significant service with French troops in the latter stages of the First Indochina War, as well as during the Algerian War and the Suez Crisis. The MAS-49 series had a reputation for reliability in conditions of poor maintenance, sometimes being cleaned with nothing more than rags and motor oil. The 49 and 49/56 series could also endure harsh service environments, seeing combat in Algeria, Djibouti, Indochina, French Guiana, and the Battle of Kolwezi.

An improved version called the MAS-49/56 was introduced in 1957 and incorporated lessons learned from service in Algeria, Indochina, and the Suez Crisis. The rifle was shortened and lightened to improve mobility for mechanized and airborne troops, and a knife bayonet was added. The MAS-49 built-in rifle grenade launcher was replaced by a combination compensator/rifle grenade launcher that fired NATO-standard 22mm rifle grenades. The rifle also incorporates an integral grenade launching sight that is attached to the front sight block and a gas cutoff that prevents gas from entering the gas tube from the gas port when firing grenade launching blank ammunition.

Attempts were made to replace the MAS-49, in the form of the MAS-54 and the FA-MAS Type 62, both 7.62×51mm NATO battle rifles, but neither were successful. The MAS-49/56 ended production in 1978 and was replaced with the 5.56×45mm NATO caliber FAMAS bullpup assault rifle. The MAS-49/56 was withdrawn from service in 1990. Whereas only 20,600 MAS-49 were manufactured, the MAS-49/56 was mass-produced, attaining a total of 275,240 rifles issued between 1957 and 1978.

===Surplus imports to the US===
Many MAS-49/56 rifles imported as surplus into the United States were rechambered locally by Century Arms International to fire the 7.62mm NATO round. However several user reports have noted that these particular conversions were often unsatisfactory (resulting in numerous action stoppages and misfires) due to imperfect workmanship. Furthermore, the shortening of the barrel to allow rechambering brings the gas vent closer to the chamber hence creating a higher stress on the bolt carrier. In addition to these Century Arms conversions, approximately 250 MAS-49/56 rifles were converted in France to 7.62×51mm NATO for use by the French National Police. These rifles are not known to have the reliability issues that plague the later Century Arms conversions. Some have been able to improve reliability by modifying the gas shutoff pin with a tapped set screw for gas adjustment.

Commercial 7.5×54mm &quot;French&quot; ammunition made in countries other than France for current distribution has been known to produce burst fire (2 or 3 rounds at a time) because of more sensitive primers. The original heavy steel firing pins on the MAS-49 and 49/56 can be replaced by commercial titanium firing pins which are much lighter and generally cure the problem of burst fire on these weapons. It is also possible to prevent these slamfires by shortening the firing pin by approximately , or by modifying the bolt to accommodate a firing pin return spring.

Some users have been able to convert 20 round FN FAL magazines to work in the 7.62mm NATO guns and 25 round FM 24/29 light machine gun or 35 round Reibel machine gun magazines for the original 7.5x54 caliber.

==Design==
The direct impingement gas system was first applied in 1901 to a semi-automatic experimental rifle (the ENT B-5) designed by Rossignol for the French military. Although several experimental prototypes using a tilting bolt and direct impingement had been tested by MAS since 1924, the immediate precursor to the MAS 7.5mm semi-automatic rifle series is the MAS-38/39. It was successfully tested in March 1939, just before World War II, and followed in May 1940 by the nearly identical MAS 1940. Similar direct impingement designs include the Swedish semi-automatic Ag m/42 adopted in 1942, and the US M16 select-fire rifle adopted in 1963. In the AG42B and MAS systems, gas is vented from a port on top of the barrel through a small diameter tube to a hollow located on the front face of the bolt carrier. The contained forces of the gases move the carrier to the rear against the operating spring pressure with enough momentum to open the bolt, and within a short distance the end of the tube is exposed vent to the atmosphere. The M16 system vents gas from the barrel through a tube and into the body of the bolt carrier where it expands. Rings on the bolt body form a seal and the expanding gases move the bolt carrier to the rear, which starts the bolt opening cycle. The spent gases then vent through now exposed holes in the side of the bolt carrier.

The MAS system has the advantage of not depositing gas fouling on the bolt itself, a separate part located underneath the bolt carrier. All the French MAS 7.5mm semi-automatic rifles mentioned herein feature a rear-locking tilting bolt, as on the M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun, the Browning Automatic Rifle (1918), the MAS-1924 to MAS-1928 experimental semi-auto rifles, and the Russian Simonov SVT-38 (1938) and SVT-40 (1940) rifles. The MAS direct impingement design reduced the number of bolt moving parts to only six: the bolt carrier, then the rear locking tilting bolt which carries the extractor, the ejector and the firing pin, and lastly the recoil spring. It takes only a few seconds to disassemble the entire bolt mechanism for cleaning.

The same 10-round detachable magazine fits the MAS-44, MAS-49 and MAS-49/56 rifles. The earlier MAS-40 (1940) rifle had a 5-round magazine within the receiver, as on the bolt action MAS-36 rifle. The rifle can still be fed by stripper clips, and have a stripper clip guide built into the bolt face. Lastly, the MAS-49 and MAS-49/56 are equipped with a rail on the left side of the receiver. It allows for the immediate installation of a &quot;Modele 1953&quot; APX L 806 (SOM) 3.85 power telescopic sight by sliding it into place and then locking it in with a small pressure lever. The MAS-49 and MAS-49/56 are capable of consistently hitting individual man-size targets up to with the adjustable peep sight and up to with the APX L 806 telescopic sight. The bore is counter sunk at the muzzle to protect the rifling and preserve accuracy. The barrel is freely floating.

===Syrian contract rifles===
Syria contracted with MAS for 6,000 MAS-49 rifles. These rifles, along with 12,000 MAS-36 rifles and a production facility for 7.5×54mm ammunition were delivered in the early 1950s. The MAS-49 was used until the mid-late 1960s when they were replaced with AK-47 assault rifles. Syrian contract rifles differed from the French service model by having a spike bayonet identical to that of the MAS-36, as well as different stocks and metal parts to incorporate this change. 

These rifles are dated 1953 and features serial numbers in the F33.000 to F39.000 range.

<text>The three dozen East Chadic languages of the Chadic family are spoken in Chad and Cameroon.

Speakers of various East Chadic languages are locally known as Hadjarai peoples. The largest East Chadic language is Nancere.

==Languages==
The branches of East Chadic go either by names or by letters and numbers in an outline format.

The East Chadic B classification follows that of Lovestrand (2012).
*East Chadic
**East Chadic A
****(A.1.1) Sibine: Mire, Ndam, Somrai, Tumak, Motun, Mawer
****(A.1.2) Miltu: Boor, Gadang, Miltu, Sarua
****(A.2.1) Nancere: Nancere, Kimré, Lele
****(A.2.2) Gabri: Gabri, Kabalai, Tobanga
***(A.3) Kwang: Kwang, Kera
**East Chadic B
****(B.1.1) Dangla: Bidiyo (Bidiya), Dangaléat (Dangla), Birgit, Jonkor Bourmataguil, Mabire, Migaama, Mogum (Jegu), Toram
****(B.1.2) Mubi: Mubi, Kajakse, Masmaje, Zirenkel (Zerenkel)
****(B.1.3) ? Kujargé
***(B.2) Mokilko (Mukulu, Gergiko)
***(B.3) Sokoro: Saba, Sokoro, Tamki, Mawa, Ubi
***(B.4) Barein (Baraïn) (including the Jalking or Jelkung dialect)
Peust (2018), however, has a somewhat different phylogenetic classification for East Chadic. The most striking change is the repositioning of Mokilko (B.2) from East Chadic B to East Chadic A, where it now constitutes the first branch to separate, followed by Lele-Nancere (A.2.1). Within East Chadic B, he treats the Mubi group (B.1.2) as the first primary branching, with all the rest forming a subgroup divided between Dangla (B.1.1) in the north and Barain plus Sokoro (B.3 and B.4) in the south.

East Chadic A is distributed primarily in Tandjilé and neighbouring regions. East Chadic B is distributed primarily in Guéra and neighbouring regions.

<text>The MS-8 is a luxury car that was produced and sold by  from March 1992 through 1997. The car is a replacement to the Mazda Persona and Eunos 300. Just like the Persona is based on the 1987-1991 Mazda Capella, the MS-8 is based on the 1991-1997 Mazda Cronos (Capella sedan). The MS-8 had the same dimensions as the Cronos, and the ɛ̃fini MS-6, sharing the 2.5 L V6 engine. The width, length, and engine displacement dimensions have particular significance in Japan, due to dimension regulations, where Japanese consumers pay an additional annual tax for larger vehicles, and obligate them to pay more annual road tax.

The MS-8 is a hardtop-style sedan in the vein of the Toyota Cresta, Nissan Laurel, Honda Vigor, and Mitsubishi Emeraude. Unlike the Cresta or the previous Persona, however, the MS-8&#x27;s body has a B-pillar that is much thicker below the beltline than it is above. Doing so allows the bodyshell more rigidity while still maintaining an airy cabin. Such a B-pillar means that the front seatbelts must be installed below the beltline. The front passenger seat belt tensioner unit, where the seat belt would recoil for storage when not in use, was located inside the rear passenger doors, and the seat belt latch was located on the front headrest support arm, allowing the belt to be properly positioned when the headrest was adjusted for height for the front passenger.

The MS-8&#x27;s interior design has several unique features. The car is only fitted with a 4-speed automatic gearbox, and the gear shifter is mounted on the dashboard next to the air-conditioning controls. Doing so eliminates the floor console between the front seats, and allows for a split front bench seat. The display for climate control and factory-equipped audio is located atop the dashboard, in a thin slit right before the windshield defroster. The sunroof is very large for its day, extending all the way above the rear seat footwell.

Following the 1991 ɛ̃fini RX-7, the MS-8 was also available with the Bose Acoustic Wave Guide audio system, a compact subwoofer design. The stereo and CD player were concealed behind a retractable cover in the center of the dashboard below the air conditioning controls, however, simple functions like the volume, music source (radio or CD player) and music selection controls were installed remotely on the steering wheel.

Four-wheel steering was offered as an extra-cost option. Like the system on the Mazda Sentia, it is designed to minimize turn radius at town speeds, and improve stability at highway speed.

Production for the MS-8 ceased when Mazda&#x27;s multi-brand strategy failed in Japan, and the company suffered financial difficulties.

<text>Sony S2 Records, formerly named as S2 Records and Sony Soho Square (typeset as Sony Soho2), was a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment (SME), which operated as a record label in the 1990s and early 2000s.

Sony Soho Square was named after its location at London&#x27;s Soho Square, with Lincoln Elias (who went on to become the Managing Director of Virgin Records in 2006 and now works with PMR Records) being the founder of the label. It was later headed by Muff Winwood, brother of musician Steve Winwood, who had worked at CBS Records/Sony Music Entertainment since the later 1970s.

Sony S2 featured bands and singers such as Jamiroquai, Des&#x27;ree, Reef, Jimmy Ray and others.

In 2004 after SME and BMG (the original major label Bertelsmann Music Group) merged, Sony S2 was dissolved into Sony BMG Music Entertainment UK. At this point many of the bands on Sony S2 were dropped, with Jamiroquai&#x27;s records going on to be released on the Sony BMG label, with marketing taken on by Columbia Records.

<text>Motif Number 1, located on Bradley Wharf in the harbor town of Rockport, Massachusetts, is a replica of a former fishing shack well known to students of art and art history as &quot;the most often-painted building in America.&quot; The original structure was built in 1884 and destroyed in the Blizzard of 1978, but an exact replica was constructed that same year.

Built in 1884 as Rockport was becoming home to a colony of artists and settlement of fishermen, the shack became a favorite subject of painters due to the composition and lighting of its location as well as being a symbol of New England maritime life. Painter Lester Hornby (1882–1956) is believed to be the first to call the shack &quot;Motif Number 1,&quot; a reference to its being the favorite subject of the town&#x27;s painters, and the name achieved general acceptance. It appeared in the work of Aldro Hibbard and of impressionist Harry Aiken Vincent who arrived in Rockport in 1917.

In the 1930s, painter John Buckley used the shack as his studio. He sold it to the town in 1945, dedicated &quot;In 1945, the town of Rockport purchased the Motif as a monument to Rockporters who had served in the Armed Services.&quot; The town, recognizing its iconic value, has taken pains to preserve both its structure and appearance, finding a red paint which appears weather-beaten even when new, and keeping the area clear of overhead wires, traffic signs and advertising.

<text>The World Atlas () is the Soviet and later Russian created and produced atlas of the world.

== Predecessors ==
Initially Russian cartography simply reproduced maps from other countries. An example of such the &quot;Atlas Marksa, produced in 1905&quot;, was merely a translation of the German &quot;Neuer Handatlas&quot; by Lucas Debes. During the interwar period, the Soviet project &quot;Bolshoi Sovietskii Atlas Mira&quot;, was produced. This was intended to be the most comprehensive atlas of modern times, remained, however, incomplete due to The Second World War; only two out of three planned volumes were published in 1937 and 1939. With the end of the war, along with the relative stability within the Soviet Union during the 1950s, The &quot;Atlas Mira&quot; (1st Russian edition, 1954) was able to be produced and included with some 200,000 named locations. This would be a significant milestone and would be followed by an English edition a decade later (&quot;The World Atlas&quot;, 2nd ed., 1967). 

== Editions ==
=== First Edition ===
The first edition was published in 1954, in two volumes. The first volume contains 283 pages of maps; the second volume is a geographical index containing 205,000 entries of geographical features. 

On the first page of the atlas is a vignette with a world map inside a five-pointed star, prominently depicting the Soviet Union. Thereafter is the title page, on the reverse side the decision of the Council of Ministers of the USSR to publish the atlas, a page with the names of the editorial board, a page with the other editors, a preface of two pages and the table of contents in two pages.

Within the section containing maps, the first two pages contain a key to map symbols — also given as a separate sheet. Thereafter are the 283 pages with maps and finally a page with more names of collaborators, technical information and at the end the number of copies printed (25,000). Many maps are on a double page, with a total width of 63 cm. The reverse side of the left-hand page which comes first in leafing through atlas — the &#x27;title side&#x27; — usually has a scheme with the current map and the adjacent sheets. A map is printed on the reverse side of almost all right-hand pages. Some maps are even wider than 63 cm and therefore have a foldout; see the table of contents.

The index, a separate volume, has a title page, a preface of two pages, a page on how to use the index, and a page with the abbreviations used. Thereafter is the actual index of 545 pages. In the end are 14 pages with translations of non-Russian geographical terms and words that occur in place names.

After the key to map symbols the map section has 5 pages of world maps, 3 pages with historical maps, 76 pages with maps of the Soviet Union in 53 pages with maps of Western Europe — meaning in this case the part of Europe that is outside the Soviet Union. The non-Soviet part of Asia — here also named &#x27;foreign Asia&#x27; — covers 53 pages, Africa 18, The Americas 57 and Australia-Oceania 12. In the end are 6 pages with maps of the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Polar regions. See also the list of map names in transliteration and translation.

Most sections start with a physical map — with contour lines and hypsometric coloring — a political map and a map of the communications in the region in question. The rest of each section consists of physical maps at a larger scale; see the list of maps, inset maps and scale. On the reverse sides of many right-hand pages are enlargements of regions on the &#x27;main map&#x27;. Contrary to the main maps, on these maps the relief is often indicated with shading, which gives a more spatial effect. In the section on the Soviet Union each Union Republic has a map of its administrative subdivision in political coloring. A political map is sometimes also given for other regions. On some maps the forests are indicated; details can be found in the list of types of maps.

The size of the atlas is considerable and so is the number of maps. Many regions are therefore depicted in detail, often at a scale of 1:5,000,000, 1:2,500,000 or 1:1,250,000. This has been done in particular for the Soviet Union itself and the &#x27;friendly&#x27; states in the world — Eastern Europe, China — but also for Western Europe and the United States. These detailed maps are missing for Yugoslavia and the Netherlands. The environs of metropoles are sometimes given in (inset) maps at a scale of 1:250,000. Curiously, for the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and China, these city maps are absent.

In the preface (see also the English translation), account is given of the composition of the atlas. There is also an overview and account of the map projections used in the atlas.

=== Second Edition ===

The second edition was published in Moscow in 1967 by the Chief Directorate of Geodesy and Cartography under the Council of Ministers of the USSR (GUGK; ). 

It was published simultaneously in Russian and English in 25,000 copies and was priced at 42 Rbls. Special cartographic paper and special cartographic offset ink were used. The Atlas was dedicated to the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. The Atlas has a full 250 pages of colour maps, majority of them physical, the index being a separate book, comprising some 200,000 entries. The size of the Atlas is . 
The maps in the Atlas are arranged in groups starting with general world maps, maps of the Soviet Union and maps of the continents. The world maps are in the 1:50,000,000 scale. The Soviet Union is treated basically as a separate continent with its own physical, political, transportation and time zone maps. It is mentioned in the preface that the number of the maps of the Soviet Union is decreased compared to the previous edition, because of the interim publishing of a separate atlas specifically dedicated to the Soviet Union. For each continent, there is a general physical map as an introduction (1:10,000,000 to 1:25,000,000), followed by political and communications maps. This is followed by a number of general regional maps (1:1,500,000 to 1:750,000) and supplemented for important areas by large scale maps (1:250,000 to 1:750,000). 18 different colours are used from deep blue for the ocean deeps to dark brown and white for the highest mountains and glaciers. Relief shading is used for delineating relief along with contour lines. All scales are metric. Tint for elevation is predominately used in larger scale maps: 1:1,500,000 and higher. The shadows and colours combined give an almost stereo impression, the relief popping up out of the pages. Many major cities in the world are shown on separate maps or insets, typically in 1:250,000 scale as well as important areas like the Panama Canal or Palestine, along with detailed maps of small islands in the world oceans.

=== Third edition ===
The third edition was made in 1999 by the Federal Service of Geodesy and Cartography of Russia. As a revised and updated world atlas since it first published in 1954, this atlas which combined maps and index into one volume.

This atlas in third edition bringing each featured landscape to life with detailed terrain models and color schemes and offering maps of unsurpassed quality, this atlas features the main atlas, and an easy-to-reference index of all 240,000 place names. All maps feature a full double-page spread, with continents broken down into 286 pages of carefully selected maps.

<text>WEEI (850 kHz) is a commercial sports gambling AM radio station licensed to Boston, Massachusetts, serving Greater Boston and much of New England. Owned by Audacy, Inc., WEEI is the Boston affiliate for the Audacy-owned BetQL Network and Infinity Sports Network, serving as a gambling-focused brand extension of its main sports radio station in the market, WEEI-FM. The WEEI studios are located in Boston&#x27;s Brighton neighborhood, while the station transmitter resides in the Boston suburb of Needham. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WEEI is available online via Audacy.

Historically, the station is perhaps best known by its former WHDH call letters, under which it operated from its establishment in 1929 until 1994; it then became the second home to WEEI following an intellectual property purchase. After WEEI&#x27;s local programming was moved to 93.7 FM in 2011, the station became a full-time ESPN Radio affiliate in 2012, and a sports gambling-focused station in 2021.

==History==

===WHDH (850 AM)===
==== Early years ====
Originally located in Gloucester, Massachusetts, WHDH was founded on June 20, 1929, by Ralph Matheson. It was a daytime-only station broadcasting at 830kHz (leaving the air at local sunset in Denver, about two hours after sunset in Boston, to protect the signal of KOA in the Colorado capital city). WHDH was Matheson&#x27;s second station; he had started WEPS on November 26, 1926. Much of WEPS&#x27; programming consisted of broadcasts to, for, or about fisherman, given Gloucester&#x27;s status as a major port for the fishing industry. The WHDH license was issued in December 1928, a month after WEPS was forced to share time with WKBE in Webster on 1200kHz; WEPS was sold to Alfred Kleindienst, owner of its share-time partner (which became WORC in Auburn, near Worcester, a year earlier), in February 1930, with WEPS being moved to Auburn and consolidated with WORC on May 5. Matheson kept WHDH, which moved its studios to Boston on November 6, 1930, though some programming had originated from Boston for some time beforehand, and the transmitter remained in Gloucester until a 1932 move to Saugus. With the move, WHDH broadened its programming, but still included some reports for fishermen. In subsequent decades, WHDH would claim WEPS&#x27; history as its own.

The 1941 North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement moved WHDH to 850kHz, and allowed the station to broadcast on a full-time basis. WHDH was able to increase power to 5,000 watts and go full-time, but not without protests from KOA, one of the dominant class A clear channel stations on 850 AM. For two years, from 1943 until 1945, WHDH was the local affiliate of the Blue Network, the former &quot;NBC Blue&quot;, replacing WBZ as Blue affiliate; WHDH ceded the affiliation to WCOP after the Blue Network also chose to affiliate with Lawrence&#x27;s WLAW (the facilities of which were subsequently sold to WNAC).

==== Purchase by the Herald-Traveler ====
In 1946, shortly after World War II, the &quot;Boston Herald-Traveler&quot; newspaper purchased WHDH, by this time again an independent station. In 1948, the station moved its transmitter site from Saugus to Needham, west of Boston, where the station would be able to increase power to 50,000 watts with a directional signal aimed east to protect KOA and other stations on 850. The station also expanded into FM broadcasting on March 31, 1948, with the sign-on of WHDH-FM (94.5 FM, now WJMN).

While not first in Boston to adopt a popular music and disc jockey format with hourly newscasts (WORL was the first), a combination of a powerful signal, top-notch personalities like Ray Dorey, Fred B. Cole, Bob Clayton, Norm Nathan, news anchor John Day, and a mid-morning women&#x27;s show hosted by Christine Evans (also billing herself as Chris); along with live coverage of Boston Red Sox baseball, Boston Bruins hockey, and Boston Celtics basketball, made WHDH one of the most popular stations in the region in the post-World War II era. In the late 1950s, Jess Cain joined the station, first co-hosting the morning show with Dorey, then as solo host when Dorey moved over to television. Cain would remain at WHDH for 34 years. By the early 1960s, Hank Forbes and Alan Dary had joined Cain, Clayton, and Nathan on the WHDH staff.

In the 1950s and 1960s, WHDH, along with WBZ, had among the strongest lineup of personality disc jockeys in Boston radio history. While the two stations for the most part programmed different kinds of music, both had very talented air personalities who were &quot;household names&quot; in the Boston area.

Perhaps the station&#x27;s best-known on-air personalities outside of Boston were the comedy team of Bob and Ray, who did a comedy-and-records show at WHDH before they departed for national fame in New York City. The station employed a popular MOR (what today would be called &quot;adult standards&quot;) music format, which would also include soft rock songs by the end of the 1960s. The station also had specialty shows playing jazz and big band music.

==== Sports coverage ====
While WHDH was never &quot;all sports&quot;, it was easily Boston&#x27;s top sports station during the 1950s through the end of the 1960s. It referred to itself &quot;The Voice of Sports&quot;, a sub-branding of the station&#x27;s overall imaging as &quot;The Sound of the City&quot;. For 30 consecutive years, from 1946 to 1975, WHDH was the flagship station of the Boston Red Sox, featuring play-by-play announcers such as Jim Britt, Ford C. Frick Award-winning Curt Gowdy, Ken Coleman, and Ned Martin. From 1946 to 1949, it also broadcast the Boston Braves, the city&#x27;s National League baseball club (the Red Sox and Braves then only broadcast home games, thus the teams shared the same announcers and did not have schedule conflicts). After the Braves left WHDH for WNAC (the forerunner to WBIX and WRKO) in 1950, WHDH began broadcasting all Red Sox games, home and away.

The station also aired one of the first sports-oriented talk programs, although without telephone calls. &quot;The Voice of Sports&quot; was a Saturday night feature for years, usually hosted by Don Gillis and featuring sports reporters from the &quot;Herald-Traveler&quot;. It was a panel discussion program featuring lively debate about sports for an hour and represented the sum total of sports talk on Boston radio in that era. The title was also used for a sports talk program when telephone sports talk began to take hold in the early 1970s. It was an afternoon telephone sports talk hosted by Leo Egan which ended after the station was sold to John Blair Broadcasting.

During the winter months, WHDH and WHDH-FM were the flagship stations of the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association and the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League, employing such announcers as Johnny Most, Fred Cusick, and Bob Wilson. For a single season, Jim Laing was the announcer for Bruins games and brought candor to the job. He was fired for being too frank about a team that finished sixth in a six-team league. In the mid- and late 1960s, when both the Bruins and Celtics played, one of the teams (usually the one playing at home) was heard on AM; while the other (usually the team playing on the road) was heard on FM. WHDH also was the radio home of Harvard University football in the autumn, including 1968, the year of Harvard&#x27;s famous 29-29 &quot;win&quot; against arch-rival Yale, considered one of the greatest college-football games ever played.

In addition, the original WHDH-TV (channel 5), which took to the air November 26, 1957, was the flagship station of the Red Sox television network from 1958 to 1971.

====Impact from loss of television license====
WHDH began to lose its valuable properties in 1969, when the Bruins and Celtics were wooed away by WBZ. Soon afterward, the Boston Herald-Traveler Corporation&#x27;s license to operate channel 5 was revoked by the Federal Communications Commission, and was given to one of the groups of businessmen that challenged its license (Boston Broadcasters, Incorporated); on March 19, 1972, channel 5 became WCVB-TV. Stung by the loss of its highly profitable television station, the &quot;Herald-Traveler&quot; was put on the market, and acquired by the Hearst Corporation in June 1972; the Boston Herald-Traveler Corporation, left with just the radio stations, then changed its name to WHDH Corporation. Less than two years later, WHDH and its FM sister station (by this time called WCOZ) were sold to Blair Radio, a national radio station advertising representative; the deal marked Blair&#x27;s entry into station ownership. WHDH then elected to not renew its contract with the Red Sox upon its expiration following the 1975 season, citing financial losses; the broadcasts moved to WMEX starting with the 1975 postseason. WHDH did not carry Sox games again until 1983, when it became an affiliate of the Campbell Sports Network, based out of WPLM and WPLM-FM in Plymouth; Campbell moved the broadcasts to WRKO following the 1985 season. The station&#x27;s last major sports property was the New England Patriots during the late 1980s.

Blair modernized the WHDH format, bringing it from the adult standards-oriented MOR sound to more of an adult contemporary approach. Veteran disk jockeys were replaced by personalities with a top 40 background, such as former WRKO personality Tom Kennedy (the DJ, not the game-show host), Bob Raleigh from WPGC in Washington (owned by Richmond Bros., owners of WMEX), Sean Casey, who was formerly with WOR-FM in New York and Bill Silver, the well-known voice of per inquiry advertisements who put the phrase &quot;but wait there&#x27;s more&quot; into the national lexicon. The music was carefully researched and became more contemporary to appeal to an adult demographic but without a rock and roll style presentation; for all intents and purposes, WHDH played top 40 without any hard rock and with more non-current material. By the early 1980s, WHDH began to focus even less on music and more on personality, while playing more music and having less talk than rival WBZ. Air talent then consisted of people such as Dave Supple, Tom Kennedy, Jim Sands (who did a popular Saturday-night oldies show), and Tom Doyle (who by the early 1980s was Cain&#x27;s co-host).

By the mid-1980s, WHDH was moving toward more of a talk format and on August 22, 1988, the station dropped music abruptly; although the station had been playing more music than WBZ, that station would gradually phase out music over the next several years. During its talk radio days, programs hosted by Larry Glick (who moved from WBZ in 1987), Avi Nelson, David Brudnoy (who would later go to WRKO, and finally, to WBZ), among others, were featured. During this time, Blair, following a takeover by Reliance Capital Group, chose to sell its English-language broadcast stations to focus on the Spanish-language Telemundo television network; in March 1987, it reached a deal to sell its entire radio group to Sconnix Broadcasting. The deal separated WHDH from its longtime FM sister station (which had become WZOU), as Sconnix chose to spin off WZOU and retain its existing FM station in the Boston market, WBOS. In 1988, WHDH became an affiliate of the NBC Radio Network.

====David Mugar era====
On August 7, 1989, WHDH was sold to local businessman David G. Mugar, whose New England Television Corporation (NETV) owned CBS affiliate WNEV-TV (channel 7). (Sconnix sold WBOS a year earlier.) On March 12, 1990, WNEV&#x27;s call letters became WHDH-TV to correspond with WHDH radio. Mugar was hoping to bring back a main competitor to WBZ radio and television, with a renewed emphasis on news and straight talk format with some political programming. Some sports programs remained, but news and talk were main priorities. Among the personalities to arrive in the early 1990s were mostly talents from within NETV, including television newscaster Ted O&#x27;Brien. WHDH also became the Boston affiliate for &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot;. The station also moved into channel 7&#x27;s studios at Bulfinch Place (near Government Center) in downtown Boston. However, by 1992, NETV was in trouble due to increasing debt incurred by the channel 7 acquisition as well as declining advertising revenues, leading to speculation of a sale of WHDH radio; on December 1, the station was sold to Atlantic Radio, putting it under the same ownership as rival talk station WRKO. (Mugar would sell WHDH-TV to Sunbeam Television in 1993.)

Atlantic Radio made an attempt to distinguish WHDH and WRKO in 1993 by relaunching WHDH as an &quot;information station&quot;, with the feature-oriented &quot;Boston This Morning&quot; premiering in the morning drive slot on March 8; nine months later, on December 16, it was replaced with &quot;News All Morning&quot;, a news block competing against WBZ. Conversely, the station began to air a talk show hosted by &quot;Boston Herald&quot; columnist and one-time WRKO midday host Howie Carr on October 4, 1993, airing in afternoon drive against WRKO&#x27;s Jerry Williams. During this time, Atlantic transferred hourly CBS Radio Network newscasts from WRKO to WHDH; additionally, Atlantic merged with two other radio groups, Stoner Broadcasting Systems and Multi Market Communications, on November 1 to form American Radio Systems (ARS).

On August 15, 1994, American Radio Systems announced the purchase of WEEI (590 AM)&#x27;s intellectual property (call letters, programming, and staff) from Back Bay Broadcasters, who had acquired WEEI from the Boston Celtics back in March. ARS then announced plans to move WEEI to the stronger 850 AM, replacing WHDH. ARS concurrently moved the Rush Limbaugh and Howie Carr shows, in addition to the &quot;Skyway Patrol&quot; traffic report brand, from WHDH to WRKO. &quot;The Money Experts&quot;, a daily financial talk show also previously heard on WHDH, would move to WBNW, a new business talk station that would take over WEEI&#x27;s old frequency. WHDH&#x27;s final broadcast, on August 28, 1994, concluded at midnight with &quot;Taps&quot; and the sound of a flushing toilet; these were played by a disgruntled board operator who was laid off in the transition, and subsequently led to a formal apology from ARS.

===WEEI (850 AM)===
==== SportsRadio 850 ====

As part of this complex transaction, ARS changed the station&#x27;s format to sports radio on August 29, 1994, rebranded the station &quot;SportsRadio 850 WEEI&quot;, and reassigned on- and off-air personnel; the WHDH call sign was officially changed to WEEI on August 31. In effect, this new WEEI (850 AM) became the successor to the previous WEEI (590 AM), which had changed its call sign to WBNW on August 25, 1994.

WEEI simulcast with WBNW for a week before WBNW debuted its business news format. With the move to 850, WEEI retained Boston Celtics broadcasts, which ARS had acquired the rights to earlier in the year, and also inherited WHDH&#x27;s rights to Boston College Eagles men&#x27;s basketball; WEEI&#x27;s existing rights to BC football were also carried over to 850 AM. Due to conflicts with BC basketball, Boston Bruins broadcasts, which WEEI had carried on 590 AM, remained on that frequency even after the launch of WBNW; the team had already announced its move to WBZ effective with the 1995–96 season. The new WEEI also continued WHDH&#x27;s CBS Radio Network affiliation until early 1995, when it moved to WBZ. The move to the 850 frequency allowed WEEI to broadcast at 50,000 watts, as opposed to 5,000 watts on 590. ARS also moved Red Sox broadcasts to WEEI from WRKO starting in 1995, marking their return to the 850 kHz frequency. Conversely, Celtics broadcasts were moved to WRKO for the 1995–96 season; they returned to WEEI the following season.

Concurrent with the move to 850, WEEI ceased an affiliation with ESPN Radio; however, on September 11, 1995, it returned to the network to carry &quot;The Fabulous Sports Babe&quot; (in middays) in a schedule shuffle that also saw the merger of the Dale Arnold and Eddie Andelman shows into &quot;The A-Team&quot; and the launch of &quot;The Big Show&quot;. WEEI also added &quot;Patriots Monday&quot;, featuring weekly appearances from New England Patriots players and coaches, in 1995; it moved to rival WNRB (the former WMEX) in 1999, but returned to WEEI in 2002, and was joined by the similar &quot;Patriots Friday&quot; (formerly aired on WAMG) in 2008. In March 1995, the station ceased carrying &quot;Sports Byline USA&quot; and One-on-One Sports in the overnight hours in favor of the Sports Fan Radio Network. &quot;The Fabulous Sports Babe&quot; left the WEEI lineup on October 3, 1997, with the station using its time slot to launch the locally-produced &quot;Dennis and Callahan&quot; on October 6. &quot;Dennis and Callahan&quot; became the station&#x27;s morning show on September 7, 1999, after the station dropped &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; in August due to declining ratings.

Westinghouse Electric Corporation, then-parent company of CBS Radio, announced its acquisition of American Radio Systems in September 1997. As the combined company would have controlled 59 percent of advertising revenues in the Boston market, as well as three of the top five radio stations, in April 1998 the Department of Justice ordered CBS to divest WEEI, WRKO, WAAF (now WKVB), and WEGQ (now WEEI-FM), as well as KSD and KLOU in St. Louis and WOCT in Baltimore, as a condition of its approval of the merger. In August 1998, Entercom announced plans to acquire the four Boston-area stations, along with WWTM (now WVEI), from CBS for $140 million.

WEEI again lost the Celtics broadcast rights in 2001, this time to WWZN (the former WNRB). Entercom reacquired the rights to the broadcasts in 2005; initially heard on WRKO, Celtics games moved back to WEEI in 2007 (though Celtics coaches and players appeared on WEEI regularly during WRKO&#x27;s time as flagship). In April 2005, WEEI began streaming its broadcasts live online by way of a free membership at its official website; a previous stream was offered from 1997 until 2002. The exception is for Red Sox and Celtics games, as these are streamed only through the team and league websites as part of subscription packages. Around the same time, the station again lost ESPN Radio programming when the affiliation was acquired by WAMG and WLLH; the station then expanded an affiliation with Fox Sports Radio that began in 2002.

WEEI was awarded its first Marconi Award in September 2006 for sports station of the year. WEEI was also named large market station of the year.

The station had an ongoing feud with &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;. In 1999, the Globe&#x27;s executive sports editor, Don Skwar, banned the newspaper&#x27;s sports writers from appearing on the station&#x27;s afternoon &quot;The Big Show&quot; after columnist Ron Borges used a racial slur while on the air in reference to New York Yankees pitcher Hideki Irabu. Two weeks later, the ban was extended to WEEI&#x27;s &quot;Dennis and Callahan&quot; morning show. WEEI retaliated by banning &quot;Globe&quot; staffers from all its shows. Nevertheless, WEEI host Michael Holley is a former Globe columnist. The ban came to an end on August 4, 2009, when Bob Ryan appeared on &quot;The Big Show&quot;, with host Glenn Ordway stating that &quot;we have all come to our senses&quot;.

====ESPN on WEEI====

In September 2009, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that ESPN Radio was in negotiations to clear some of its night and weekend programming on WEEI, with speculation suggesting that WEEI could subsequently move to one of Entercom&#x27;s properties on the FM dial (such as the 93.7 FM facility then occupied by WMKK), with the AM 850 signal switching to ESPN Radio. The report followed WAMG&#x27;s decision to end its ESPN Radio affiliation and go silent, along with the launch of an FM competitor, WBZ-FM, the previous month—the first serious threat to WEEI&#x27;s dominance in Boston sports radio. Entercom confirmed on October 7, 2009, that ESPN Radio programming would return to WEEI effective November 2 (though most programming would remain local). WEEI began to carry ESPN Radio&#x27;s overnight programming, including &quot;AllNight with Jason Smith&quot;, and some weekend programming. As late as December 2010, station management continued to deny occasional reports of a move of WEEI&#x27;s programming to WMKK. Ultimately, WEEI began to simulcast on 93.7 FM on September 12, 2011, a decision that came after WBZ-FM began outrating WEEI in three key demographics, even when its ratings were combined with those of Boston-area listeners of its simulcast on 103.7 FM in Providence, Rhode Island.

On September 18, 2012, Entercom and announced that AM 850 would become &quot;ESPN on WEEI&quot;, a full-time affiliate of ESPN Radio. The simulcast of WEEI and WEEI-FM was split on October 4, 2012; the existing local programming and sports broadcasts remained on WEEI-FM, while AM 850 aired a redirection loop for one day before joining ESPN Radio on October 5. ESPN Radio&#x27;s morning show, &quot;Mike and Mike&quot;, marked its new affiliate with a live broadcast from Gillette Stadium. While the bulk of the station&#x27;s programming after the change came from the national ESPN Radio schedule, WEEI indicated that it might also air some locally produced weekend long-form specialty programs that do not necessarily fit on WEEI-FM. WEEI also aired Boston Celtics games that conflicted with Boston Red Sox games on WEEI-FM through the 2012–2013 season; if the conflict involved a Celtics playoff game, the Celtics aired on WEEI-FM and the Red Sox game was on WEEI.

====Sports betting====
In October 2021, WEEI dropped ESPN Radio in favor of sports betting programming from the Audacy-owned BetQL Network. The station also carries some programming from CBS Sports Radio. Unlike the other Audacy stations with a sports betting format, which brand as &quot;The Bet&quot;, WEEI continues to brand using its call sign.

<doc id="1050315" wikidata="Q3422779" url="?curid=1050315" title="Red Sox Nation">
<text>Red Sox Nation is a term used for fans of the Boston Red Sox. The phrase was coined by &quot;Boston Globe&quot; feature writer Nathan Cobb in an October 20, 1986, article about split allegiances among fans in Connecticut during the 1986 World Series between the Red Sox and the New York Mets.

==Red Sox fandom==
Red Sox fans were once described by Dennis Eckersley as the &quot;ultimate manic-depressive fanbase.&quot; For all the excitement over the quality of play by the Red Sox, there is often a twinge of pessimism about the team, as the team&#x27;s failures are typically blown out of proportion. &quot;Boston Globe&quot; columnist Charlie Pierce, among others, has attributed the self-perpetuating fatalism of the Nation to the intellectual legacy of the Puritans who settled Boston and instilled in the region&#x27;s inhabitants a deep-seated Calvinist determinism. In 2010, Forbes magazine rated Red Sox Nation as the best fans in American sports, citing points such as road attendance and overall devotion to the team. However, in 2011 GQ magazine also ranked Red Sox fans the 6th worst in the United States - and 2nd worst in Major League Baseball behind only the Philadelphia Phillies - labeling them &quot;insufferable hypocrites&quot;.

==&quot;Official&quot; Red Sox Nation==
In 2004 the Boston Red Sox began offering official citizenship in Red Sox Nation. For a small fee, fans received a membership card with the words &quot;Official Red Sox Nation Citizen&quot; and access to additional Red Sox merchandise offers and newsletters.

===President===
In the summer of 2007, the Red Sox fan site on MLB.com offered &quot;official&quot; citizens of RSN the chance to register as candidates to become the first president of Red Sox Nation, for the 2008 season. A broad field of self-proclaimed candidates was whittled down (internally, by operators of the website) to 25, then an open-to-all online &quot;primary&quot; was held in August that resulted in 10 final candidates. For most of September, the ten were provided with weblogs on the website to mount their campaigns. On September 27, Tim Russert of NBC moderated a debate among six of the candidates in a hall at Boston University (three were no-shows, and Doris Kearns Goodwin withdrew from the race). The final election, also open to the public at the same website, was held from September 28 through October 2, 2007. The winner was Jerry Remy, a former Red Sox player and then broadcast color commentator. The following day, Remy threw out the first pitch in the opening game of the Red Sox&#x27; playoff series.

===Governors===
Following Jerry Remy&#x27;s election as president of Red Sox Nation, he and his vice president &quot;Regular Rob&quot; Crawford developed a &quot;Red Sox Nation Five-Point Plan&quot; to guide their first year in office. The first point of the plan called for the creation of governors to represent members of Red Sox Nation in their home states. Beginning with the six New England states, nominations were accepted through redsox.com, and from these nominations the president and vice president appointed representatives for each state. Governors were responsible for better connecting members of Red Sox Nation within their home state to the team, as well as organizing viewing parties for Red Sox Nation members in their states and collecting feedback from their constituency. Since its inaugural season, the Governor&#x27;s program has thus been disbanded.

<doc id="1050316" wikidata="Q2018969" url="?curid=1050316" title="Bromham, Wiltshire">
<text>Bromham is a village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England. The village is northwest of Devizes and the same distance east of Melksham.

Besides the main village of Bromham, the parish includes six other settlements: St Edith&#x27;s Marsh, Westbrook, Hawkstreet, Netherstreet, Roughmoor and Chittoe. These are sub-villages and hamlets all within of the main village centre, thus &#x27;greater Bromham&#x27; is geographically extensive for a village of its size. It stands 1½ miles north of the Kennet and Avon Canal and 1¾ of a mile south of the Roman road leading to Bath, Somerset.

==History==
In Anglo-Saxon times the manor was held, in the reign of Edward the Confessor, by Earl Harold Godwinson. Under the Normans there were two manors covering Bromham. Bromham Hall, later called Bromham House, the manor house of Bromham Roches, stood to the east of the Devizes road; it was burnt by royalist troops in May 1645, during the civil war.

===Chittoe===

The small village of Chittoe is about north of Bromham. Its name, first attested in 1167 as &quot;Chetewe&quot;, is unusual in England for deriving from Common Brittonic: the first element is agreed to be the word that survives in modern Welsh as (&quot;woodland&quot;). The origin of the second part of the name is less certain; twenty-first-century scholarship suggests the ancestor of the Welsh word (&quot;thick&quot;). The area was a detached tithing of the ancient parish of Bishops Cannings until 1883 when Chittoe became a separate civil parish, taking some land from Bromham; in 1934 the parish was merged into Bromham.

== Places of worship ==
=== Parish church ===
The Church of England parish church of St. Nicholas, in the centre of the village, is from the 13th century and is a Grade I listed building. The church has fragments of its 12th century predecessor, and was extended in the 14th and 15th centuries. The tall spire is from the 15th century. Towards the end of that century an ornate south chapel was added by Sir Roger Tocotes and Sir Richard Beauchamp; Pevsner describes it as &quot;the feature which makes a visit to the church memorable&quot;. In the 16th and 17th centuries several members of the Bayntun family were buried or commemorated in the chapel, thus it became known as the Bayntun chapel.

The churchyard has the grave of Irish poet Thomas Moore, who had long resided at Sloperton Cottage, north of Bromham.

Today the parish is part of the Bromham, Chittoe and Sandy Lane benefice, which also covers St Matthew&#x27;s Church at Rowde and the small wooden church of St Mary and St Nicholas at Sandy Lane.

=== Nonconformity ===
Bromham Methodist Church was built in 1799, on Church Hill below the parish church and enlarged in 1815 and 1880. As of 2016 the church is still in use.

A Baptist chapel was built at Bromham in 1873, replacing an earlier building of 1828. The chapel closed during the Second World War and is now a private house.

=== Chittoe ===

Primitive Methodists built a chapel in the centre of Chittoe in 1840. Enthusiastic singing by the Methodists could be heard from within the Anglican church after it was built nearby, so in 1882 the chapel was dismantled and rebuilt at Chittoe Heath, not far from the Devizes road (now the A342). A schoolroom was added at the rear of the chapel in 1914. As of 2016 the chapel is still in use and is served by the minister of Melksham United Church.

The Church of St Mary, Chittoe, was built in 1845 to designs of T. H. Wyatt. A district (which included Westbrook) was created for it the next year. Previously, the hamlet had been a detached part of the parish of Bishops Cannings and villagers had to travel to the church there for marriages and burials, using a trackway called the &quot;Burying Road&quot;. For burials this requirement was relaxed at the end of the 18th century, but weddings were still conducted at Cannings until the new church was brought into use. Chittoe parish was enlarged in 1864 to include Sandy Lane, taking areas from Derry Hill and Bromham parishes.

In 1980 the church was declared redundant, and its parish and benefice were united with Bromham; subsequently the church and vicarage at Chittoe were converted to private residences.

==Notable buildings==
The parish has three Grade II* listed houses. Battle House, named for the manor of Bromham Battle, held by Battle Abbey, is partly 15th century, largely rebuilt c. 1760; it was the home of the historian Sir William Napier between 1826 and 1831.

Spye Arch, at the top of Bowden Hill, once served as gatehouse to Spye Park, a seat of the Bayntun family. It had originally been constructed in the 16th century as the gatehouse of the Cistercian Stanley Abbey, which stood near the eastern edge of the parish, towards Chippenham; the Abbot&#x27;s Wood that appears as a block of woodland in Andrews&#x27; and Dury&#x27;s Map of Wiltshire, 1773, survives as a narrow wooded strip south of the village.

Nonsuch House, north of Bromham village on the road from Melksham, is from the early 18th century.

==Notable people==
The noted antiquary, author and Somerset historian the Rev. John Collinson was born in Bromham on 19 July 1757. His father, John Collinson, was at the time curate of the parish church of St. Nicholas.

Reginald St John Battersby was vicar of Chittoe from 1934 until his retirement in 1972. He had lost a leg while serving as a young officer in the First World War; in the Second World War he organised the Chittoe branch of the Home Guard.

==Local government==
Bromham is a civil parish with an elected parish council and is in the area of Wiltshire Council, a unitary authority. The councils are responsible for different aspects of local government.

==Education==
St. Nicholas Church of England Primary School is in the village. For secondary education, Bromham is in the catchment area of Kingsbury Green Academy in Calne.

For many years there were two schools in the village. The first school opened in 1832 and moved into a new building (still the site of the present school) near the church in 1867, becoming a National School. Children of all ages attended until 1938, when older pupils transferred to Calne; the school became Voluntary controlled in 1948. The building was extended in the 1960s and again in 2004.

A Nonconformist school was established in 1843, and in the 1860s became a British School in a new building to the east of the village, near the Devizes road. The building was enlarged in 1901, then was transferred to Wiltshire County Council in 1907 and was known as Bromham County School. Pupil numbers declined until two schools were no longer necessary, resulting in closure of the county school in 1984. Its building is now a private house.

==Amenities==
Bromham has a village shop and a family butcher&#x27;s shop.

The village has two playing fields. The Pound Playing Field has the village&#x27;s tennis court, a grassed football pitch, a play park and a hardcourt basketball and five-a-side football area. The Social Centre Playing Fields include Bromham F.C.&#x27;s football pitch and a smaller pitch that is used by the youth team. Just by the car park of the Social Centre is another children&#x27;s play park which is overlooked by the Millennium Cross: a tall stone cross erected in 2000 and recording the village&#x27;s Christian heritage.

Bromham Football Club was founded in 1897 by Harry Amor and Arthur Powney.

There is a bowls club that meet every week at the Social Centre to play indoor bowls on special mats that turn the dance floor into a bowls green.

At the Pound Playing Field there is a tennis court available to hire.

Bromham was served by the Great Western Railway at Bromham and Rowde railway station from 1909 until the station closed in 1955.

==Carnival==
Bromham Carnival is held each June for two weeks. It comprises village-wide events, opening with the choosing of the Carnival Queen, Butterfly Princess, Princess and Prince. The events then continue including quizzes, bingo, treasure hunts and much more. On the final Saturday of the two weeks the carnival procession is held, commencing usually at 2.00pm from the Pound Playing Field and winding its way through the village to the Social Centre Playing Field where activities and shows take place throughout the afternoon. For the past few years, the carnival has been followed by the locally organised show: &quot;Bromfest&quot;. Bands from the local area play from 5.00pm through until 12 midnight and mark the end of the carnival period.

==Twinnings==

* – Avoca, Ireland (filming location for the 1990s BBC series &quot;Ballykissangel&quot;)
* – Ingrandes-sur-Loire, France

<doc id="1050320" wikidata="Q501624" url="?curid=1050320" title="Andrees Allgemeiner Handatlas">
<text>Andrees Allgemeiner Handatlas was a major cartographic work (general atlas) published in several German and foreign editions 1881–1937. It was named after Richard Andree (1835–1912) and published by Velhagen &amp; Klasing, Bielefeld and Leipzig, Germany.

By using chromolithography, rather than copper plate engraving, but reproducing the maps from zinc plates that were etched in relief (just like letterpress printing), V &amp; K was able to offer detailed maps at a much lower price than competing works, such as the 7th and 8th editions of Stielers Handatlas. The 1937 edition of &quot;Andrees Handatlas&quot; was printed using offset printing.

==Editions==
The first edition appeared in 1881. The 4th and 5th editions were edited by Carl Paul Albert (1851-1912); the 6th through 8th editions, by Ernst Ambrosius; and the final edition, by Konrad Frenzel. Cartographers were G. Jungk (†1932), R. Kocher, E. Umbreit (†1904), T. Adolph (†1930), H. Mielisch (†1925), and K. Tänzler (†1944) although production of a number of maps was contracted out to geographical institutes like Peip, Wagner &amp; Debes, Sternkopf, Sulzer.

Editions for other countries were also issued:
*Österreichisch-Ungarischer (Austrian-Hungarian) editions were published in Vienna in 1881, 1889, 1893, 1903, and 1913.
*Four editions of &quot;Andree&#x27;s Stora Handatlas&quot; were published in Stockholm (1881, 96 pages of maps; 1899, second edition (), 130 large maps and 140 inset maps; 1907, third edition (), 143 large maps and 163 inset maps), with additional maps of Scandinavia; and 1924. The verso text and the introductory material was in Swedish.
*The maps of Andree&#x27;s atlas were used for Cassell&#x27;s &quot;Universal Atlas,&quot; which was published in London in 1891-1893 using maps printed in Leipzig in English; and for the Times Atlas of 1895-1900.
*French editions were published from 1882 onwards.
*Italian editions were published in 1899 and 1915.
*Danish editions were published in 1882 and, after the Schleswig plebiscite, 1923.
*Norwegian editions were published in 1882 and 1923.
*A Finnish edition was published in 1899.

Editions of a &quot;Geographisches Handbuch&quot; (Geographical Handbook) for Andrees &quot;Handatlas&quot; were issued in 1882, 1894 (1st edition), 1895 (2nd edition), 1898-1899 (3rd), 1902 (4th) and 1909 (5th).

Other well-known titles of Velhagen &amp; Klasing were Putzgers (after F.W. Putzger, †1913) &quot;Historischer Schulatlas&quot; (Historical School Atlas; 1877, as &quot;Historischer Weltatlas&quot; or Historical Worldatlas; 100th ed. 1979), &quot;Grosser Volksatlas&quot; (Large Peoples Atlas, 1935) and &quot;Grosser Wehratlas&quot; (Large Military Atlas, 1937). Founded 1835, the firm was taken over by F. Cornelsen in 1954, and is now fully merged into that company.

<text>Joe-Max Moore (born February 23, 1971) is an American former soccer player. He played professionally for clubs in Germany, England and the United States. He finished his career with the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer. In addition to his club career, Moore earned 100 caps, scoring 24 goals, for the U.S. national team between 1992 and 2002. During those years, he was part of U.S. teams at the 1992 Summer Olympics and the 1994, 1998 and 2002 FIFA World Cups.

On April 4, 2013, Moore was elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Moore was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the son of Corey Moore, and Tulsa oil man and business man, Carl Moore. Moore&#x27;s father also happened to be a part-owner of the Tulsa Roughnecks of the North American Soccer League. He moved to Irvine, California when he was 14, and played boys&#x27; soccer at Mission Viejo High School where he was a four-year starter. Heavily recruited out of high school, he chose to play NCAA soccer at UCLA. While at UCLA, he played with future national team teammates Brad Friedel, Chris Henderson and Cobi Jones. As a freshman, he scored 11 goals, assisted on ten others and was named to the Soccer America Magazine&#x27;s All-Freshman team. That year, UCLA won the NCAA championship, defeating Rutgers in penalty kicks. As a sophomore, he earned second team All-American honors and was a first team All-American as a junior. That season, his final year with UCLA, he led the team in scoring. At the end of his three-year collegiate career, he had scored a total of 38 goals and assisted on 24 others in 65 games.

Moore was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame on October 11, 2014.

==Career==

===Years in Germany===
In July 1994, USSF loaned Moore to German Second Division club 1. FC Saarbrücken. At the time, Moore was a part of the U.S. team at the 1994 FIFA World Cup, but did not appear in any matches. With a lull in national team games following the World Cup, USSF decided to move several players overseas. Saarbrücken would end up buying Moore&#x27;s contract from USSF for $250,000. In Moore&#x27;s single season with Saarbrücken, he played 25 games, leading the club with 13 goals. At the end of the season, Saarbrücken transferred Moore to fellow Second Division club 1. FC Nürnberg. He again led his team in scoring with eight goals.

===New England Revolution===
In 1996, Major League Soccer (MLS) was in the process of building teams for its upcoming first season. As part of that process, MLS attempted to ensure an initial equitable distribution of talent across each of its teams. It did this by allocating known players to each team. MLS allocated Giuseppe Galderisi to the New England Revolution. However, he showed up injured and played poorly through his first four games, so MLS replaced him with Moore on the Revolution roster on July 24, 1996.

Moore had an exceptional four-year tenure with the Revolution collecting numerous MLS and Team awards. Aside from an injury marred 1997 season, in which he only played 11 games, scoring four goals, he consistently produced for the club. Moore finished the 1996 New England Revolution season as the team&#x27;s inaugural scoring champion, with 11 goals and 1 assist. He was named the Revolution&#x27;s first-ever Team MVP. He was also the first member of the Revolution to be named to the MLS Team of the Week. Moore made his first appearance for the Revolution on July 27 in a 4–2 loss to the Kansas City Wizards. He scored his first Revolution goal on July 31, recording a brace against the San Jose Clash.

During his tenure with the Revolution, Moore became the club&#x27;s all-time leading scorer and made the 1999 MLS All Star team. He was again named Revolution Team MVP in 1998 New England Revolution season, and 1999 New England Revolution season, and finished as the Revolution&#x27;s scoring champion again in 1999.

His success with the Revs led him to pursue a return to Europe, this time with Everton F.C. in the English FA Premier League.

===Emelec===
In November–December 1997, Moore spent a month on loan from the Revs to Club Sport Emelec of the Ecuadorian First Division following the end of the MLS season where he yearned to be close to his family recently residing in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was not the only MLS player with Emelec, as Alexi Lalas joined him during the loan.

===Everton===
On November 11, 1999, Moore signed with Everton F.C., in the English FA Premier League on a free transfer, after he impressed the Everton staff during a seven-day October tryout.

At the time, Moore did not have permission from MLS to work out with any team but the Revolution. Despite this, MLS placed no barriers in the way of Moore&#x27;s free transfer. The contract with Everton, good for three and a half years, would pay Moore approximately $600,000 per season.

On December 28, 1999, Moore made his first appearance for Walter Smith&#x27;s side, in a 0–0 draw against Bradford City A.F.C. He went on an impressive run over the course of the following two months. On January 15, 2000, Moore scored his first goal for Everton, in a home 2–2 draw against Tottenham Hotspur. He tallied 3 more goals in the following four league matches, notching against Wimbledon F.C., Derby County F.C., and West Ham United F.C. He added two more goals in FA Cup Play during this period notching against Preston North End F.C. and Aston Villa F.C. on January 29 and February 20 respectively.

He scored his first brace for the club on April 1, 2000, in a 4–2 victory over Watford F.C. Despite this run, he slowly became less and less effective, failing to record a single goal in Everton&#x27;s 2000–01 Everton F.C. season despite making 21 appearances.

Moore tallied again for The Toffies on December 15, 2001, recording the game-winner against Derby County. His goal against Leeds United F.C. the following matchday would prove to be his last for the club. The final straw came at the end of 2002. Moore had suffered a knee injury in the U.S. game against Portugal at the 2002 FIFA World Cup and did not play for Everton in the next season. On December 12, 2002, his contract with Everton terminated &quot;by mutual consent.&quot;

===Return to the Revolution===
When he returned to New England from Everton in 2003, signing on January 28. he was a much changed player. He had suffered from several injuries while in England which hampered his playing time when he came back to the Revs.

However, he still managed to score four goals in 16 games during the 2003 season. Moore recorded the first goal of his Revolution return in the 12th minute of the Revolution&#x27;s 2–1 win over the Dallas Burn on April 28. In 2004, his last season with the team, he played in only three games, failing to score a goal, before spraining ligaments in his knee. He was out for most of the rest of the season, but planned to return for the 2005 season. However, he re-injured his knee during a January 2005 pre-season mini-camp.

Moore had reconstructive surgery on his right knee for a damaged medial collateral ligament on January 25, 2005. Two days later, he announced his retirement from professional soccer, saying, &quot;After numerous attempts to strengthen and stabilize my knee through rehab, it became clear that I had no alternative but to have reconstructive surgery. Considering my age and the recovery time necessary, I have decided to end my playing career.&quot;

In his six years in MLS, Moore scored 41 goals and added 35 assists for 111 points, the assists and points being Rev records through the 2004 season. However, Taylor Twellman has since passed Moore on the Rev&#x27;s points lists.

==National team==
While in college, he began playing for the national team. In 1989, he was part of the U.S. U-20 team which placed fifth at the 1989 FIFA U-20 World Cup. In 1991, he scored the winning goal against Mexico in the Pan American Games championship game. In 1992, he was a member of the U.S. Olympic team which went 1–1–1 and failed to make the second round.

After the 1992 college season ended, Moore signed with the U.S. national team. Beginning in 1988, the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) had begun to sign top U.S. players to contracts, making the U.S. national team a de facto professional club. USSF would then loan out U.S. players to club team, recalling them for national team games. Moore chose to not return to UCLA for his senior year and joined USSF as a full-time national team player.

Moore&#x27;s first appearance for the US national team came against Canada on September 3, 1992. He was part of the U.S. roster for the 1994 but didn&#x27;t appear in a match and also the 1998, 2002 FIFA World Cup rosters, appearing in both tournaments. Moore became the sixth U.S. player to earn 100 caps, doing so against Poland in the team&#x27;s 2002 World Cup group finale.

His 24 goals for the U.S. rank him sixth in national history, behind Landon Donovan, Clint Dempsey, Eric Wynalda, Brian McBride and Jozy Altidore. On January 27, 2006, Moore was inducted into the Oklahoma Soccer Hall of Fame.

==Charitable activities==
Moore was to appear in a charity match for Hollywood United FC against Los Angeles Galaxy on November 4, 2007. Proceeds were to go the American Red Cross and The Salvation Army to benefit those affected by the wildfires in Southern California.

==Popular culture==

A non-alcoholic drink has been named after Moore. In the spirit of the Arnold Palmer, the Joe-Max Moore is simply half Sprite and half Fanta Orange mixed in the same glass. The concoction was invented at the 2022 Jefferson Cup soccer tournament in and around Richmond, Virginia by players participating in the tournament. Its origin is credited to Jack Martin, a standout midfielder from Massachusetts, who was the first to create one at a soda fountain. By the end of the tournament the drink was being consumed almost exclusively by players at mealtimes, and has continued to spread up and down the east coast.

<doc id="1050340" wikidata="Q11704" url="?curid=1050340" title="Election Day (United States)">
<text>Election Day in the United States is the annual day for general elections of federal, state and local public officials. With respect to federal elections, it is statutorily set by the U.S. government as &quot;the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November&quot; of even-numbered years (i.e., the Tuesday that occurs within November 2 to November 8).

Federal offices (president, vice president, and United States Congress) and most governors (all except for Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, and Virginia) and state legislatures are elected in even-numbered years. Presidential elections are held in years divisible by four, in which electors for president and vice president are chosen according to the method determined by each state. Elections to the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate are held every two years. All representatives are elected to serve two-year terms. Senators serve six-year terms, staggered so that one third of senators are elected in any given general election. Elections held two years after presidential elections are referred to as midterm elections. Terms for those elected begin in January the following year. The president and vice president are inaugurated (sworn in) on Inauguration Day, which is usually January 20.

Many state and local government offices are also elected on Election Day as a matter of convenience and cost saving. Most governors are elected in midterm years. A handful of states hold elections for state offices during odd-numbered off years. States may hold special elections for offices that have become vacant. Congress has mandated a uniform date for presidential () and congressional ( and ) elections, though early voting is nonetheless authorized in nearly every state, and states also have mail voting procedures.

The fact that Election Day falls on a Tuesday has become controversial in recent decades, as many people might be unable to vote because they have to work. It is a public holiday in some states, including Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Virginia, West Virginia, as well as the territory of the Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico. Some other states require that workers be permitted to take time off with pay. California requires that employees otherwise unable to vote must be allowed two hours off with pay, at the beginning or end of a shift. A federal holiday called Democracy Day, to coincide with Election Day, has been proposed, and some have proposed moving election day to the weekend. Other movements in the IT and automotive industries encourage employers to voluntarily give their employees paid time off on Election Day.

==History==
By 1792, federal law permitted each state legislature to choose presidential electors any time within a 34-day period before the first Wednesday in December. A November election was convenient because the harvest would have been completed but the most severe winter weather, impeding transportation, would not yet have arrived, while the new election results also would roughly conform to a new year. Tuesday was chosen as Election Day so that voters could attend church on Sunday, travel to the polling location, usually in the county seat, on Monday, and vote before Wednesday, which was usually when farmers would sell their produce at the market. Originally, states varied considerably in the method of choosing electors. Gradually, states converged on selection by some form of popular vote.

Development of the Morse electric telegraph, funded by Congress in 1843 and successfully tested in 1844, was a technological change that clearly augured an imminent future of instant communication nationwide. To prevent information from one state from influencing Presidential electoral outcomes in another, Congress responded in 1845 by mandating a uniform national date for choosing Presidential electors. Congress chose the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November to harmonize current electoral practice with the existing 34-day window in federal law, as the span between Election Day and the first Wednesday in December is always 29 days. 

The effect is to constrain Election Day to the week between November 2 and 8 inclusive. November 1 was avoided because it falls on All Saints&#x27; Day, and business owners would generally do bookkeeping for the previous month on the first day of the month. Beginning with Presidential elections, states gradually brought most elections into conformity with this date.

The Twentieth Amendment, passed in 1933, changed the beginning and end date for the terms of the President, Vice President, Congressmen, and Senators. It did not affect the timing of Election Day.

==Scheduling issues==
The majority of the electorate have to attend work on Tuesdays. This has led activists to promote alternatives to increase voter turnout. Alternative solutions include making Election Day a federal holiday or merging it with Veterans Day, observed annually on November 11, allowing voting over multiple days, mandating paid time off to vote, encouraging voters to vote early or vote by postal voting, and encouraging states to promote flexible voting.

===Holiday and paid leave===

Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Virginia, West Virginia, and the territory of Puerto Rico have declared Election Day a civic holiday. Some other states require that workers be permitted to take time off from employment without loss of pay. California Elections Code Section 14000 and New York State Election Law provide that employees without sufficient time to vote must be allowed two hours off with pay, at the beginning or end of a shift.

Some employers allow their employees to begin later or leave their workplace early on Election Day to allow them the opportunity to get to their precinct and vote. The United Auto Workers union has negotiated making Election Day a holiday for workers of U.S. domestic auto manufacturers. In January 2019, Sandusky, Ohio became the first city in the country to make Election Day a paid holiday for city employees by eliminating Columbus Day.

In April 2020, the Governor of Virginia Ralph Northam signed legislation that established Election Day as a holiday. In June 2020, the Governor of Illinois J. B. Pritzker signed legislation that established Election Day as a holiday.

Democratic Representative John Conyers of Michigan proposed H.R. 63 – Democracy Day Act of 2005 for the Tuesday after the first Monday in November of every even-numbered year, to be a legal public holiday called Democracy Day. The purpose of the holiday was to increase voter turnout by giving citizens more time to vote, as well as to allow for the opening of more polling stations with more workers while raising awareness of the importance of voting and civic participation. The bill was reintroduced on November 12, 2014, and again on September 25, 2018, by independent Senator Bernie Sanders. It has never been enacted.

===Early and postal voting===

Most states allow early voting, letting voters cast their ballots before Election Day. Early voting periods vary from 4 to 50 days prior to Election Day. Unconditional early voting in person is allowed in 32 states and in D.C. In the 2008 presidential election, 30% of votes were early votes.

All states have some kind of absentee ballot system. Unconditional absentee voting by mail is allowed in 27 states and D.C. and with an excuse in another 21 states. Unconditional permanent absentee voting is allowed in seven states and in D.C. In Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington, all major elections are by postal voting with ballot papers sent to voters several weeks before Election Day.

In 29 states, postal votes must be received on or before Election Day. Other states have later deadlines, with California election law allowing mailed in ballots to arrive at the elections office up to 17 days after Election Day. Some states, like Texas, give overseas and military voters extra time to mail in their ballots.

===Election Day on weekends===
Louisiana, to date, is the only U.S. state to hold de facto general elections on a Saturday. The state&#x27;s statewide elections are held on odd years, with the primary (first round) in October and the runoff (general election) in November. The state&#x27;s unique primary method, a variation of the nonpartisan blanket primary, only requires a further runoff to be held for those offices for which neither of the top two candidates receive an absolute majority of the vote. 

Currently, primaries for U.S. House and U.S. Senate elections in Louisiana are held on the federal Election Day, with runoffs in December if necessary. Starting in 2026, Louisiana will revert to closed party primaries in Congressional elections, with the winners meeting in the general election on Election Day. Unaffiliated voters may vote in the primary of their choosing. It is unclear whether a candidate will be required to attain a majority of votes in the first round of the party primary to avoid a runoff, or a candidate can advance with a plurality. 

==Primaries==
Most primary elections are held between March and September, mostly on Tuesdays.

<text>Paint thinners are diluents — solvents used to adjust the viscosity of paint, as well as similar preparations such as varnish and lacquer, by dilution. Organic solvents labelled &quot;paint thinner&quot; are usually turpentine or white spirits / mineral spirits for the use of diluting oil-based paints only. For water-based paints, such as acrylic paints, water is the primary solvent, but notably, may not always be the only solvent.

==Uses==
Principally, paints are either a colloidal suspension of solid pigment particles or are an emulsion of dense viscous dye gel or paste with a filler all dispersed through a lighter free-flowing liquid medium — the solvent. This solvent also controls flow and application properties, and in some cases can affect the stability of the paint while in liquid state. Its main function is to act as the carrier to ensure an even spread of the non-volatile components. After a long period in storage, the dense paint pigment and filler settles out over time and it can lose some of its solvent due to evaporation, becoming so thick and viscous that it does not flow properly when used. By the addition of more solvent, it can be diluted or re-dissolved to restore the paint to an appropriate consistency for use. The diluent acts to reduce the viscosity and so making a more free-flowing liquid, so in this context, &quot;thinning&quot; is the act of dilution.

These solvents can also be used as paint-brush cleaners to remove or to clean items that have become caked in dried-on paint. With improvements in paint manufacturing have led to the reduction of use of organic solvents in preference for water, means that paint clean-up can be done with water and common surfactants and detergents.

==Common paint thinners==

Common organic solvents used historically as paint thinners are volatile organic compounds — forms of hydrocarbons — and include:
*White spirit — also called mineral spirits
*Acetone — a very simple ketone, often called nail varnish remover
*Butanone / methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) 
*Dimethylformamide (DMF)
*Glycol ethers — such as 2-Butoxyethanol
*Alcohols — such as isopropyl alcohol / isopropanol and 1-propanol
*Light naphtha distillates
*Turpentine
*Linseed oil
*Lacquer thinner — a combination of alcohols, alkyl esters, ethers, ketones, and aromatic hydrocarbons / arenes

Less common organic solvents used as paint thinner — like aromatic organic compounds that are more hazardous, so more heavily regulated and restricted in use — but still used in the construction industry include:
*Aromatic hydrocarbons / arenes
**Ethylbenzene 
**Toluene / toluol
**Xylene / xylol
*Alkyl esters
**Amyl acetate
**&quot;n&quot;-Butyl acetate
*Butanol

==Hazards and health concerns==
Some paint thinners can ignite from just a small spark in relatively low temperatures. These solvents are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), with white or mineral spirits having a very low flash point at about 40°C (104°F), the same as some popular brands of charcoal starter. All such solvents with low flash points are hazardous and must be labelled as flammable.


Prolonged exposure to VOCs emitted by paint containing these solvents or its clean-up using paint thinner are hazardous to health. VOCs exhibit high lipid solubility and for this reason, they bioaccumulate in adipose / fatty tissues.

Extensive exposure to these vapours has been strongly related to organic solvent syndrome, although a definitive relation has yet to be fully established.

For safety reasons, the use of substances containing these solvents should always be done in well-ventilated areas, to limit the health consequences and minimise the risk injuries or fatalities. In countries with poor environmental protection regulation, workers commonly experience a high exposure to these chemicals with consequent damage to their health.
The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists has established threshold limit values (TLVs) for most of these compounds. The TLV is defined as the maximum concentration in air which can be breathed by a normal person — i.e. excluding children, pregnant women, etc. — in the course of a typical American work week of 40 hours, day-after-day through their work life without long-term ill effects. Globally, the most widely accepted standard for acceptable levels of VOC in paint is Green Seal&#x27;s GS-11 Standards from the US which defines different VOC levels acceptable for different types of paint based on use case and performance requirements.

Due to their hazardous nature and environmental threat of damaging pollution — persistent organic pollutants from aromatic organic compounds that are resistant to degradation are often found in wastewater with poor handling and disposal resulting in them seeping into groundwater, contaminating public water supplies
— so in recent decades, laws from legislatures like the European Parliament in EU regulations have extensively reduced the usage of these VOC solvents in favour of water-based paints — that is, using ones like acrylic paints that have been reformulated to be made with water as the primary solvent, with only low levels of hydrocarbon solvents, if any — which perform in a very similar way as oil paints, but also are much less polluting, so have a much lower environmental impact.
===Addiction===
Paint thinners are often used as an inhalant, due to its accessibility and legality as a drug. Many teenagers become addicted to thinner and due to lack of knowledge, parents and caregivers do not notice it or give it much attention. By using paint thinner a person could experience hallucinations, sensitive hearing (for the first time), speech deformation, memory loss, etc.

<text>Election Day in the United Kingdom is by convention a Thursday. Polls in the United Kingdom open at 7:00 and close at 22:00.

==General elections==

It has been suggested that this tradition arose as the best of several circumstances: Friday pay-packets would lead to more drunken voters on Fridays and weekends; having the election as far after a Sunday as possible would reduce the influence of Sunday sermons; many towns held markets on Thursdays, thus the local population would be travelling to town that day anyway.

Before the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 and again since it was repealed, a general election in the UK follows the dissolution of Parliament by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day. The Prime Minister thus has the power to choose the date of the election. Thursday has been the customary day to hold elections since the 1930s. The Levellers proposed that elections be held on the first Thursday in every second March in the Agreement of the People in 1647.

Between 2011 and 2022, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act all future General Elections were automatically scheduled on the first Thursday in May every five years, barring special circumstances; only one such election took place in 2015. To call an early election, either a vote of no confidence in the government, which required a simple majority, or a vote in favour of an earlier election, which required a two-thirds majority of the House of Commons was needed. Only one election took place through these means in 2017.

Historically, elections took place over the course of a four-week period until 1918. Election days were then as follows:

and elections have been on Thursdays since then:

==Other elections==
Local elections in England and Wales are by statute held on the first Thursday in May. This has been changed in recent years: in 2001 they were delayed while an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease was dealt with and in 2020 they were postponed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2004, 2009 &amp; 2014 local elections were delayed in order to allow the elections to be held simultaneously with the European Parliament. However the elections were separate in 2019. In all cases, the elections were held on Thursdays.

By-elections and other UK elections are also traditionally held on Thursdays though they can be held on other days – in particular when they would otherwise clash with bank holidays. The last Parliamentary by-election not to be held on a Thursday was the Hamilton by-election of 31 May 1978. This was held on a Wednesday as the returning officer wished to avoid a clash with the opening game of the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Today, council by-elections are still occasionally held on days other than Thursday.

From 1997 to 2015, general elections occurred on the same days as the annual scheduled local government elections; however, this ended in 2017 with the local elections on 4 May and the general election on 8 June.

<text>The Best Friend of Charleston was a steam-powered railroad locomotive widely considered the first locomotive to be built entirely within the United States for revenue service. It was also the first locomotive to suffer a boiler explosion in the United States.

== History ==
The locomotive was built for the South Carolina Canal and Rail Road Company by the West Point Foundry of New York in 1830. Disassembled for shipment by boat to Charleston, South Carolina, it arrived in October of that year and was unofficially named &quot;The Best Friend of Charleston&quot;. 
After its inaugural run on Christmas Day, it was used in regular passenger service along a demonstration route in Charleston. At the time, it was considered one of the fastest modes of transport, taking its passengers &quot;on the wings of wind at the speed of .&quot; The only faster mode of travel was by an experienced horse and rider.

On June 17, 1831, the &quot;Best Friend&quot; was the first locomotive in the US to suffer a boiler explosion. The blast is said to have been caused by the fireman tying down the steam pressure release valve; he had grown tired of hearing it whistle, so to stop the noise he closed the valve permanently. (Another account has him placing a stout piece of lumber on the safety valve and sitting on it.) He may also have tried to overpressure the boiler as the locomotive was expected to perform hard work (e.g. climbing a gradient upon setting off); this was common practice and a common cause of boiler bursts until a tamper-proof safety valve was produced. The blocked valve caused the pressure within the boiler to exceed its capacity, and it exploded. The resulting blast was said to have hurled metal fragments over a wide area and killed the fireman. The locomotive&#x27;s engineer Nicholas Darrell was uninjured in the explosion.

According to Centennial History of South Carolina Railroad, this wrote a new rule in the SCC&amp;RR operating manual that engineers were to remain on station at all times, with the aid of newly hired conductors to manage cars, passengers and switches. Salvageable parts from the &quot;Best Friend&quot; were used to build the &quot;Phoenix,&quot; which seems to have run up to the time of the American Civil War. To restore passenger confidence, a flatcar piled high with protective cotton bales was placed between the locomotive and its passenger cars.

==Replicas==
Today, an operable replica of the locomotive is in the hands of the Charleston, SC Chapter, National Railway Historical Society. It was built in 1928 to commemorate the centenary of the South Carolina Canal and Rail Road, and widely exhibited. On August 6, 2005, the City of Charleston lent it to the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS), the original SCRR line&#x27;s current operator, for five years. After refurbishment at their shops in Chattanooga, NS brought the replica to New York City for display on December 12, 2005, outside the New York Stock Exchange Building in a ceremony commemorating 175 years of American railroad history. It was then put on public display at NS Atlanta headquarters at 1200 Peachtree Street in midtown Atlanta, GA; then transported by truck in October 2013 to Charleston, SC.

Another full-size replica is on exhibit at the South Carolina State Museum, in Columbia, South Carolina.

==Best Friend of Charleston Museum==
In May 2014, the Best Friend of Charleston Museum opened on 23 Ann Street in the Charleston Historic District behind the Charleston Visitor Center and near the Charleston Museum.

==Timeline==

<doc id="1050351" wikidata="Q323196" url="?curid=1050351" title="Aboyne">
<text>Aboyne (, ) is a village on the edge of the Highlands in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, on the River Dee, approximately west of Aberdeen. It has a swimming pool at Aboyne Academy, all-weather tennis courts, a bowling green and is home to the oldest 18 hole golf course on Royal Deeside. Aboyne Castle and the Loch of Aboyne are nearby.

Aboyne has many businesses, including a Co-Op supermarket, several hairdressers, a butcher, a newsagent, an Indian restaurant and a post office. Originally, there was a railway station in the village, but it was closed on 18 June 1966. The station now contains some shops and the tunnel running under the village is now home to a firearms club. The market-day in Aboyne was known as &quot;Fèill Mhìcheil&quot; (Scottish Gaelic for &quot;Michael&#x27;s Fair&quot;).

==History==
The name &quot;Aboyne&quot; is derived from &quot;Oboyne&quot;, first recorded in 1260, in turn derived from the Gaelic words &quot;abh&quot;, &quot;bo&quot;, and &quot;fionn&quot;, meaning &quot;[place by] white cow river&quot;.

The village of Aboyne was founded by Charles Gordon, 1st Earl of Aboyne in 1671, who, in the same year, rebuilt the west wing of Aboyne Castle. The siting of the castle itself is related to the limited number of the crossings of the Mounth of the Grampian Mountains to the south. In 1715 Aboyne was the scene of a tinchal, or great hunt, organised by John Erskine, sixth Earl of Mar, on 3 September, as a cover for the gathering of Jacobite nobles and lairds to discuss a planned Jacobite rising. The uprising began three days later in Braemar.

The former Aboyne Public School was used as a secondary school to the local area, but was notably used during WWII as an evacuee station for those coming from Glasgow. Local Aboyne children were educated in the morning and the evacuee children were educated in the afternoon. Any overflow evacuees were passed on to the nearby church hall, and as many as 1,250 were evacuated to the Deeside area in 1939. 

==Religion==
An eighth-century Christian presence in Aboyne is attested by a Pictish stone cross called the Formaston Stone. The slab is inscribed with Ogham characters which have been transliterated as “MAQQOoiTALLUORRH | NxHHTVROBBACCxNNEVV.” These are the Pictish names Talorc (TALLUORRH) and Nehht (NxHHT), both of which were names of kings. In fact, the Pictish king Nechtan (d. 732) was said by Bede to have accepted the Christian faith in response to the teachings of Adamnan, abbot of Iona, eventually bringing his people to Christianity as well. Aboyne&#x27;s first church was dedicated to Adamnan, and it was at the burial ground of this church where the Formaston Stone was first discovered. The stone was eventually removed to Aboyne Castle and is currently exhibited in the Inverurie Museum. 
In 1237, Alexander II granted the Knights Templar a charter of liberty to acquire lands in Scotland, and Walter Byset, Lord of Aboyne, gave the Templar preceptory the church of Aboyne. Then, between 1239 and 1249, the church was conveyed to the Templars &quot;adproprier usus&quot; by Ralph, Bishop of Aberdeen. According to the terms of the charter, the Templars would take charge of the temporalities of the church and maintain a vicar there, while the bishop retained authority in spiritual matters. King Alexander II confirmed the donation on 15 April 1242, and Pope Alexander IV, in 1277, the same year that John of Annan, chaplain to Alexander III, was appointed vicar. Aboyne, along with other Templar possessions in Scotland, was held by the Torphichen Preceptory in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and remained so until the Reformation. 
In 1761, a new parish church was constructed in Aboyne, under the patronage of the Marquess of Huntly; then, in 1842, another church was built on the site of the eighteenth-century structure, and in 1929 at the Union of the Established Church, it was formally dedicated to St. Machar. In 1936, St. Machar&#x27;s was joined with the United Free Church, and fifty years later, was linked with the parish church of Dinnet, a linkage which led to the 1993 union between the two, which is now known as the Aboyne-Dinnet Parish Church. In 2006, Aboyne-Dinnet was linked with the parish church at Cromar.

==Climate==
Aboyne has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), similar to most of the United Kingdom. Due to its high inland position in Scotland, Aboyne can record some very low temperatures and some high snowfall. Conversely, temperatures can reach exceptional values for the latitude, particularly during the winter months due to the foehn effect; it holds the January and March record for the highest temperatures in Scotland, with on 26 January 2003 and on 27 March 2012. The former is also the UK&#x27;s highest January temperature on record, which it shares with Inchmarlo, Kincardineshire and Aber, Gwynedd. The February record for Scotland was broken on 21 February 2019 at 18.3 °C.

==Tourism and culture==
In summer, when tourists visit, the number of people and vehicles increases dramatically. The Highland Games on the Village Green features in August. The green includes facilities for rugby and football and a play park as well as Aboyne Canoe Clubs storage facility &#x27;The Canoe Cathedral&#x27;.

The British Royal Family are residents in nearby Balmoral Castle during the Summer.

Outdoor pursuits include golf, walking, cycling, mountain biking trails, kayaking, canoeing and gliding from the airfield just outside the village. Aboyne has become popular with gliding enthusiasts from Britain and Europe due to its suitable air currents (due to the surrounding terrain). The airfield has two parallel tarmac runways running east–west, a webcam and small weather-monitoring centre on its premises. Aboyne contains a mountain biking facility at Aboyne Bike Park located in the Bellwood.

The old Aboyne Curling Club had its own private railway station, Aboyne Curling Pond railway station, at the Loch of Aboyne.

The close by pass of Ballater is a rock-climbing area. The village of Dinnet is a few miles west and is the first being located inside the Cairngorms National Park. Walkers and cyclists can ascend Mount Keen by cycling as far as they can from Glen Tanar forest before walking to the summit.

There are two schools, Aboyne Academy and a primary school. The academy has around 650 pupils, about a quarter from Aboyne itself, with the remaining three quarters from surrounding villages. The primary school has around 240 children and also contains a nursery with around 30 children. The school has access to a full-size swimming pool and gym run by the adjacent Deeside Community Centre.

Belwade Farm, a horse sanctuary, is situated nearby.

A small stone circle is situated in the village, with several other megaliths nearby, notably the Tomnaverie stone circle, which is also the site of a disused Royal Observer Corps monitoring post.

== Transportation ==

The village is served by the 201/202 bus service operated by Stagecoach which provides a regular bus service to Aberdeen, Banchory, Ballater and Braemar.

<text>União Desportiva de Leiria, commonly known as União de Leiria (), is a Portuguese professional football club based in Leiria. Founded on 6 June 1966, it currently plays in the Liga Portugal 2, holding home matches at Estádio Dr. Magalhães Pessoa, with a 23,888-seat capacity.

==History==
Leiria&#x27;s biggest rivals in Portugal are Beira-Mar, Associação Naval 1º de Maio and Académica de Coimbra, which belong to the same geographical region. In 1979–80, the club first competed in the top division, finishing in 13th position and being the first team inside the relegation zone.

A heavy contender in the battle to reach European competitions in the 2000s, the club was relegated in 2007–08 to the second level, after finishing last. The team would be immediately promoted back, coming in second after champions Olhanense.

On 23 August 2004, União de Leiria reached the UEFA Intertoto Cup final with Lille. After getting a 0–0 draw in France in the first leg, the whole city thought it would be possible for the club to win a European competition. However, in the second leg, after another 0–0 draw at their home stadium, the team would lose the game in extra time by 0–2, mostly due to the excessive fatigue. For the history, it was the first Portuguese team to reach the final of this competition.
The 2011–12 season was lived amongst serious financial difficulties, with the squad not being paid their wages for several months, as three coaching moves also happened during the campaign and president João Bartolomeu resigned amongst accusations of ingratitude towards the players. On 29 April 2012, after most of the squad rescinded their contracts, only eight players took the pitch for the league match at home against Feirense in an eventual 0–4 home loss. The side played the last two matches, against Benfica and Nacional, with a complete team, but three players came from the juniors.
After failing to meet the deadline to register the team in Division Two, Leiria were automatically relegated to the third level. Overwhelmed with the task of rebuilding a squad from scratch, the organization hired several players in an attempt to return to the professionals, as a second senior team also begun competing in the Leiria regional leagues, coached by former club player Luís Bilro.
On 28 June 2013, the UD Leiria SAD was declared bankrupt in a meeting of creditors, which demanded the payment of a debt amounting to €13.5 million, with the Portuguese state abstaining for demanding a debt of over €3.6 million. The second senior team that competed in the regional league took the place of the SAD by buying their sports rights for €1,000, with the club returning to the Estádio Dr. Magalhães Pessoa after playing their home matches at other grounds for two seasons.

In February 2015, at an extraordinary general assembly, UD Leiria would vote for the creation of another SAD, opening doors to the arrival of Alexander Tolstikov, who after João Bartolomeu would become the new &quot;Lord&quot; of Leiria. The club would have already had a SAD between 1999 and 2013, having been extinguished in the face of its high debt value. The SAD&#x27;s initial share capital is 40% owned by UD Leiria and 60% owned by DS Investment LLP, of which Alexander Tolstikov is one of those responsible. Thus, DS Investment started to control the main football team and also the junior team.

==Stadium==

The Estádio Dr. Magalhães Pessoa was built for UEFA Euro 2004 in 2003, hosting during the competition Croatia&#x27;s matches against Switzerland (0–0) and France (2–2). It also hosted the 2006 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira final between FC Porto and Vitória de Setúbal, as well as the following (Sporting CP 1–0 Porto).

The architect who designed the stadium was Tomás Taveira, who also designed stadiums for Euro 2004, including Beira-Mar&#x27;s Estádio Municipal de Aveiro and Sporting CP&#x27;s Estádio José Alvalade. The grounds belong to the municipality of Leiria.

Due to an excessive rent, Leiria relocated to the Estádio Municipal in the nearby town of Marinha Grande, for 2011–12. For the following season, the club moved to Campo da Portela in Santa Catarina da Serra, home of U.D. Serra.

After the SAD bankruptcy, the club returned to play its home matches at the Estádio Dr. Magalhães Pessoa.

<text>The Autozam Revue is a subcompact car that was sold by Autozam, introduced in 1990. The demise of that marque led to the cars being renamed as the [[Mazda]] Revue in some markets. The car was also sold in many export markets as the Mazda 121, where it replaced the previous 121 that had been based on the first-generation Ford Festiva.

The Revue was available in most markets as a small four-door saloon with an optional canvas sunroof added in February 1991. Its unconventional, tall and rounded look with a very short, separate trunk caused some consternation. While everyone else was chasing aerodynamics, the tall Revue/121 had a very uncompetitive . 1.1-, 1.3- and 1.5-litre engines were offered, with either five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission.

In 1996, the 121 name was shifted to export versions of the Mazda Demio, a tall, five-door hatchback, which became exported as the Mazda2 in its second generation. A Ford Fiesta, assembled at Ford&#x27;s Valencia plant barely modified, but rebadged as the Mazda 121, was also sold in some markets after 1996 (where the Demio was sold at the same time with its original name). Sales of the Revue ended in Japan in June 1998.

== Australia ==
The Mazda 121 was often referred to as the &quot;bubble car&quot; or &quot;jellybean&quot; or &quot;the hat&quot; with the car&#x27;s colour often added to the latter, for example: &quot;The little green jellybean&quot;. Australian models came standard with the 1.3 litre engine paired with the standard 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic transmission. The 1.5-litre engine was added to the Australian range in 1994 and was used until 1996. This generation was sold alongside its successor, the Mazda Demio also baring the 121 nameplate, for a short time between 1996 and 1997.

== Europe ==
Sold as the Mazda 121 from 1991 until 1996, the unconventional saloon was first replaced by a badge-engineered Ford Fiesta, and shortly afterwards also by the Mazda Demio 5-door estate. Sales in Europe were generally meager, in part because it was priced very close to the larger 323. At the time of introduction, European-market cars were typically fitted with the 16-valve 1.3-litre engine with , with the 1.5 being reserved for Japan. Mazda also offered the 1.1-litre version of the engine for certain European markets where the tax and insurance regulations suited it.

In Belgium and the Netherlands, it is often referred as &quot;de Bolhoed&quot; (the Bowler Hat) because of its bubble shape.

== Engines ==

<text>Eurobank is a financial organisation that operates in Greece, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Bulgaria and the UK. As of December 2018, the Eurobank Group counts, in assets, 653 customer service locations in Greece and abroad, and 13,162 employees.

Eurobank has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.

==History==
The bank was incorporated in 1924 as “V. Karavasilis Tobacco Company and Bank SA”. In 1937 it was renamed “Karavasilis Bank SA” and in 1952 “Professional Credit Bank SA”. In 1964 it was acquired by the National Bank of Greece, who renamed it Bank of Athens in 1992.

The Euromerchant Bank SA (, ) was founded in 1990. It took over 75% of EFG Private Bank (Luxembourg) S.A.&#x27;s operations in 1994. In 1997 it was renamed EFG Eurobank SA and acquired Interbank Greece SA and the branch network of Crédit Lyonnais Grèce SA. In February 1999 EFG Eurobank SA merged with Cretabank SA.

In March 1999, Bank of Athens merged with EFG Eurobank SA. In 2000 the bank changed its name to EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA after taking over the renowned Ergasias Bank. In 2002 it acquired Telesis Investment Bank, followed by UnitBank in 2003. A financial products subsidiary was founded in 2007 (49.9% owned by employees).

In 2012, the bank sold 70% of the Polish branches called &quot;Polbank&quot; to Raiffeisen Bank International.

In 2012, the Spiros Latsis associated Eurobank EFG merger with Giannis Kostopoulos&#x27;s () Alpha Bank was cancelled because of the Greek debt crisis. The proposed merger included a capital boost from Qatar Investment Authority of 500 million euro convertible bond and a 1.25 billion euro rights issue which would have Qatar Investment Authority a major shareholder and from Southeast Europe&#x27;s biggest bank with assets of 150 billion euros and 80 billion euros of deposits.

After the Greek debt crisis and bailouts of Greek banks in 2012, Swiss-Luxembourg based EFG—the then owner of Eurobank—was told to separate the Greek bank from the rest of its business. In July of that year Eurobank was deconsolidated from the group and its shares sold to Yiannis Latsis and it was renamed Eurobank Ergasias.

In January 2013, the National Bank of Greece made an offer, which ultimately did not go through, to take over Eurobank Ergasias; 64,000 Eurobank shareholders and the Greek capital market commission agreed. Later in 2013 Eurobank acquired New TT Hellenic Postbank and New Proton Bank.

The bank was the third largest in Greece by total asset by total loans and total deposits, and the fourth by market capitalisation—as at December 2014.

Since 1 February 2015, the chairman and non-executive director of Eurobank Ergasias has been Nikolaos Karamouzis; Fokion Karavias has been the CEO and executive director since the same day. Canadian fund Fairfax Financial are major shareholders, with an 18.2% stake in 2018, that was increased after the takeover of Grivalia Properties until 32.9%.

In the end of year 2015 results, total net loans were (non performing 43.8%, of which provisions were at 53.3%), customer deposits , and central bank funding was .

At the end of 2020, the bad loans of the group reached an amount of €5.7 billion. In March 2020, Eurobank announced a project for reducing its nonperforming loans index from 14% to 9%.

In March 2023, the Greek bank Eurobank sold its Serbian unit to AIK Banka for €280 million, becoming Serbia&#x27;s second-largest financial conglomerate.

In March 2024, Eurobank acquired, through a subsidiary, 2.3% of the shares in ANT1 and Makedonia TV.

In September 2024, Eurobank finalised the acquisition of a 26.1% stake in Cypriot Hellenic Bank thus increasing its stake in Hellenic to 55.9 per cent of the Cypriot bank&#x27;s shares. On 7 November 2024, Eurobank increased its stake in Hellenic Bank to 68.81% of the shares and announced its intention to make a full bid on Hellenic. On 11 February 2025, Eurobank announced that its stake in Hellenic Bank reached 93.47% of the shares and the launch of a mandatory public offer to acquire the remaining shares of Hellenic Bank, in order to complete the acquisition by obtaining full ownership of Hellenic Bank and then delist it from the Cyprus Stock Exchange.
