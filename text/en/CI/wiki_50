<text>The Mornington Peninsula Freeway is a freeway in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, that provides a link from south-eastern suburban Melbourne to the Mornington Peninsula. Whilst the entire freeway from Dingley Village to Rosebud is declared by VicRoads as the Mornington Peninsula Freeway, the section between EastLink in Carrum Downs and Moorooduc Highway in Moorooduc is locally and commonly known as Peninsula Link. The entire freeway corridor bears the designation M11.

==Route==
The Mornington Peninsula Freeway begins at the Dingley Bypass in Dingley Village and travels southbound towards Chelsea Heights and the EastLink/Frankston Freeway interchange in Carrum Downs, running roughly parallel to the existing Boundary Road/Wells Road corridor. From here, it continues in a south-easterly direction changing its local name to Peninsula Link. Peninsula Link runs for 25 kilometres, bypassing Central Frankston to the east until it meets Moorooduc Highway, at which points the local name reverts to Mornington Peninsula Freeway. The freeway then continues southwest until Boneo Road, in Rosebud. This section of the freeway passes through vineyards, stud farms and gardens along the Mornington Peninsula. The final section of the road between Jetty Road and Boneo Road is a two lane, single carriageway road. Despite this, this section is still classed as a Freeway by VicRoads and carries the M11 designation.

On the urban section of Mornington Peninsula Freeway (between Dingley Village and Carrum Downs), the standard travel time in both directions is 10 minutes: 2 minutes between Dingley Bypass and Lower Dandenong Road, 3 minutes between Lower Dandenong Road and Springvale Road, and 5 minutes between Springvale Road and the EastLink / Frankston Freeway. The usual peak period travel time is between 13 and 24 minutes; however, in times of extreme congestion or traffic incidents, the travel time can well exceed 30 minutes.

==History==

=== Northern section (Springvale Road–Frankston Freeway) ===
The original northern section (prior to the 2021 northern extension) was built originally as an extension of Frankston Freeway, a short but wide 2 km length curve opening to the Eel Race Drain in 1976. This was followed by a 13 km section further north to Springvale Road in Chelsea Heights, opening on 18 March 1980 alongside Wells Road, subsuming portions of it and ultimately replacing it as a through route. A plan to complete the rest of the freeway northwards from Springvale Road was cancelled by a change of Government in 1982, electing to duplicate Wells Road through Aspendale and Boundary Road through Braeside instead.

Mornington Peninsula Freeway&#x27;s northern section was first signed Metropolitan Route 11 when the Eel Race Drain to Frankston Freeway stage opened in 1976, and was completely re-routed from Wells Road when the last replacement stage of Frankston Freeway opened in 1980. Despite the fact most Victorian Freeways converted to the alphanumeric system by 1998, this section retained the Metropolitan Route 11 designation. Finally in 2013, with the opening of Peninsula Link, this section was reassigned M11 (although a number of Metropolitan Route 11 shields remain visible to this day).

=== Southern section ===
Plans for the southern section as &quot;Mornington Peninsula By-pass Road&quot; had been made as far back as 1966, between Nepean Highway in Dromana and Eastbourne Road at Rosebud. It was built in small successive sections, starting at Nepean Highway at Dromana in late 1971 eventually to Jetty Road at Rosebud South in 1975. Another single-carriageway section between Dromana and the Nepean Highway at Mount Martha opened in 1984, later duplicated in 1989. The last extension between Mount Martha and Moorooduc South linking to Moorooduc Highway was opened in 1993 and finally duplicated in 1994.

Mornington Peninsula Freeway&#x27;s southern section was initially designated Freeway Route 87, this was removed in 1987. In 1989, Metropolitan Route 11 extended to the southern section via Frankston Freeway and Moorooduc Highway, when upgrades to Moorooduc Road and the duplication of the Dromana-Mount Martha section were completed, and re-routed from Moorooduc Road when the last extension to Tuerong opened in 1994. Similar to the Northern section, Metropolitan Route 11 was retained until 2013 when it was replaced by M11.

=== Peninsula Link (Frankston Bypass) ===
The &#x27;Frankston Bypass&#x27;, connecting the northern and southern sections, has been proposed numerous times over the years, appearing in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan. The Mornington Peninsula Freeway was progressively opened at each end by the 1980s, with the Frankston Freeway also opened running south from Seaford into Frankston itself. The contract for the construction of the EastLink Tollway north from Seaford was signed in 2004, with construction starting the following year. EastLink opened in 2008.

In early 2006, operator of EastLink, ConnectEast, offered to build the bypass by June 2009, but was rejected by the state government. The government would be required to contribute $100 million to the project, which would also have been funded through a 1c-2c increase in tolls. ConnectEast also wanted the EastLink concession period extended from 39 to 49 years. A leaked report sent by VicRoads to the City of Frankston in 2006 and obtained by the State Opposition in 2008 showed the cost of building the Frankston bypass was $240 million.

In October 2006, $6.5 million was allocated by the Bracks Government towards extra ramps at the Frankston end of EastLink to cater for a future bypass. Recommended by the Southern and Eastern Integrated Transport Authority (SEITA), the Transport Minister said that &quot;no decision has been made about the requirement for a bypass of Frankston&quot;. For the 2006 State Election Liberal opposition leader Ted Baillieu promised $250 million to build a 22 kilometre long road toll free. Peter Batchelor responded that the costing did not add up, with smaller projects costing more.

Also in October 2006, then Transport Minister Peter Batchelor announced that an Environment Effects Statement would be carried out by SEITA for the bypass, and $20 million would be spent on changes to the Cranbourne-Frankston Road and Moorooduc Road intersection. Work on the EES started in March 2007 at a cost of $5 million.

The construction of EastLink and its interchange with the northern section led to speculation of possible congestion on the Frankston Freeway, especially at the southern terminus at McMahons Road on the Moorooduc Highway. This possible congestion was expected to be alleviated by the construction of a Frankston Bypass to fill a missing section of the Mornington Peninsula Freeway. VicRoads however did not anticipate such congestion on the Frankston Freeway would actually occur. Federal MP Bruce Billson however, believed otherwise, and raised the issue in parliament and the local press. The Victorian Transport Minister Peter Batchelor stated that simply because the freeway&#x27;s projected path appeared on a map (referring to the route shown in the Melway street directory), that it did not mean that the road was intended to, or would ever actually be built. City of Frankston councillors however, along with Mr. Billson, pushed for the bypass to be built.

On 28 October 2007, the Federal Liberal Party pledged a maximum of $150 million towards constructing the road toll-free if elected, to be matched by Victorian Government. They were defeated at the election. In April 2008, the Southern and Eastern Integrated Transport Authority (SEITA) decided that the preferred option for a Frankston Bypass was a high standard, continuous, duplicated road in the existing road reserve from Carrum Downs to Mount Martha. A group of Moorooduc residents claimed they were not consulted in the first phase of the project, and the figures had been skewed to show public support for the selected preferred option. The report said:

The Frankston Bypass would be a 25 km freeway standard road with two lanes in each direction with a speed limit of 100 km/h. A full grade separated junction would be provided with EastLink and the Frankston Freeway, along with full grade-separated diamond interchanges at Dandenong-Frankston Road, Cranbourne-Frankston Road, Golf Links Road, Frankston-Flinders Road, Bungower Road and Old Moorooduc Road / Mornington Peninsula Freeway. Interchanges at Skye Road and Mornington-Tyabb Road will have half-diamond grade-separated interchanges with northbound entry and southbound exit ramps. The cost was estimated between $500 million to $750 million.

In September 2008, ConnectEast held talks with Roads Minister Tim Pallas, but the State Government refused to discuss the issue with the media, or promise to build it without tolls. On 16 October 2008 State Premier John Brumby announced the bypass would be built. Costing $700 million and now 27 kilometres long, work would start by the end of 2009. The State Government expected the project would be paid for in partnership with the Federal Government, and confirmed that it would be toll-free.

Throughout 2008 and early 2009, the State Government examined a number of Public Private Partnership (PPP) models for the delivery of the project, selecting the Partnerships Victoria &#x27;Availability&#x27; model, where the private sector company designs, builds, finances and operates the project for an agreed period of time, with the State Government making regular payments to the company based on performance against a set of key performance indicators, which avoided any charges being imposed on road users. The PPP was managed by the Linking Melbourne Authority (formerly SEITA) and delivered by private sector partner Southern Way, with the State Government providing quarterly payments for delivery under an availability model, with no charges to motorists. An invitation for Expressions of Interest was issued in March 2009 followed by a Request for Proposals, with two bidders short listed by November 2009. Final bids were received a month later, with the Southern Way consortium (made up of construction companies Abigroup and Bilfinger Berger, along with financier Royal Bank of Scotland) being awarded the contract to design, build and operate the freeway on 20 January 2010.

The contract with Southern Way to design, construct and finance the freeway was signed in January 2010, with a total project delivery cost for the two parties being $759 million: made up of Southern Way&#x27;s construction costs, along with the Linking Melbourne Authority&#x27;s land acquisition, project management, environmental effects statement and Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act costs. Construction commenced in February 2010, with completion expected in early 2013, with Southern Way to operate and maintain the freeway for the next 25 years. The Victorian Parliament enacted legislation, the Road Management Amendment (Peninsula Link) Act 2012, in November 2012 to confer rights on the private operator to manage and maintain the road. These payments are adjusted on an availability basis, with reductions being made when each half-hour of unavailability, weighted according to the nature and severity of the unavailability. Failure to meet key performance indicators for emergency contact points, incident response, compliance with operational plans, maintenance inspections and works, reporting and environmental management will also results in the government deductions being applied to the service payments.

Peninsula Link opened on 18 January 2013 and completed the missing section of the Mornington Peninsula Freeway, running from the EastLink interchange at Seaford, Melbourne, running along the eastern fringe of Frankston. It runs via Baxter and Moorooduc almost parallel to the existing arterial Moorooduc Highway.

When Peninsula Link was opened, the route numbers were slightly altered. The Frankston Freeway (which previously carried Metropolitan Route 11 along with the sections of the Mornington Peninsula Freeway and Moorooduc Highway) now carries the M3 route from the EastLink interchange, while the whole of Mornington Peninsula Freeway, including the Peninsula Link, is designated M11.

==== Peninsula Link Trail ====
A walking and cycling path - The Peninsula Link Trail - was constructed alongside the freeway. Stretching from the Patterson River in Patterson Lakes to the Moorooduc Highway in Mount Eliza, it is concrete paved and easy to navigate. An interactive map of the Peninsula Link Trail and other walking and cycling paths in Melbourne is available here.

In 2019, Mornington Peninsula Shire launched an initiative with the aim of extending the trail from Mount Eliza to Mornington.

===Northern extension (Mordialloc Freeway)===
A reservation for a northern extension of the Mornington Peninsula Freeway between Springvale Road in Aspendale Gardens and the Dingley Bypass in Dingley Village has been in place for many years. The reservation is bordered by residential housing and industrial estates to the west, and Braeside Park to the east.

In October 2014 a feasibility study found that a freeway standard road was not required. However, an arterial road, called the Mordialloc Bypass, in the freeway reservation was considered to be the optimal solution. If in the future any freeway was to be considered, it would have been most likely the Dingley Arterial would be upgraded to freeway standard. The 2014 State Budget included $10.6 million over 4 years to undertake detailed planning and project development. The arterial road would have probably consisted of a divided road, at-grade traffic-light controlled intersections, a speed limit of 80 km/h and bike/pedestrian paths.

On 2 May 2017, the state government announced that it had allocated $300 million in the State budget to completing the Mordialloc Bypass as an arterial road, with an overpass to be constructed at the Springvale Road intersection. On 9 April 2018, the state Labor government announced an extra $75 million in funding and that the road would instead be built as a freeway with four lanes and grade separations along the entire length. The freeway was named Mordialloc Freeway during construction. In October 2018, the state government produced plans for the freeway, with a public consultation period.

The state government claimed that the freeway would &quot;improve travel times and ease congestion in Melbourne&#x27;s south east&quot; and provide &quot;safer, more reliable journeys&quot;. The government promises the freeway will save 10 minutes off journeys during evening peak hour between the Springvale Road and the Dingley Bypass with the freeway carrying 80,000 cars daily by 2031. The freeway is set to remove up to 13,000 trucks from the nearby local and arterial roads each day. It will also improve access to Monash, Melbourne&#x27;s largest employment area outside of the CBD, and to the Moorabbin Airport area. The Dingley Bypass will also have an extra 7900 cars daily due to the freeway in 2031. Noise walls are also expected along the new freeway to reduce vehicle noise near residential areas as well as a shared user path along the entire freeway.

CPB/Seymour Whyte Joint Venture and McConnell Dowell/Decmil Joint Venture submitted tenders to build the freeway. The McConnell Dowell/Decmil Joint Venture was announced as the preferred contractor in 2019. Construction started in October 2019 and the freeway was opened as an extension of the Mornington Peninsula Freeway on 21 November 2021.

The extension involved the construction of 6 new bridges, 4 new grade-separated interchanges as well as a new full diamond interchange with Thames Promenade on the previous northern section. The extension also included the construction on a new shared walking and cycling path. The extension was built with entry and exit ramps on major roads including Springvale, Governor, Lower Dandenong and Centre Dandenong Roads. The extension intersects Dingley Bypass with traffic lights. A new shared walking and cycling path was also built along the extension.

In early 2017 digital real-time travel time signage was installed to assist motorists travelling on the Mornington Peninsula Freeway.

In September 2018 flexible safety barriers were installed between Jetty Road and Boneo Road along the freeway. Barriers were also installed along the centre of the road which were completed in December 2018. In 2018 noise walls on the freeway have also been campaigned for in Safety Beach, Dromana, McCrae and Rosebud.

===1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan===
The freeway was originally designated in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan as the F6 Freeway corridor.

== Proposed extensions ==
Extensions of the Mornington Peninsula Freeway have been developed for the southern end to support growing traffic demand. Traffic demand is expected to increase by nearly 10 per cent along the Mornington Peninsula Freeway between 2021 and 2031.

=== Southern extension (Rosebud to Blairgowrie) ===
In July 2018 the Mornington Peninsula council conducted a Southern Peninsula Arterial Corridor Investigation with plans to extend the freeway south to Blairgowrie through the Tootgarook Wetlands. A public acquisition overlay exists from the end of the Mornington Peninsula Freeway to Melbourne Road which has reserved the land for a freeway extension. A full freeway would cost $500 million with additional bridges over the wetlands costing $3 billion in total. The freeway extension would terminate at Melbourne Road at the intersection of Canterbury Jetty Road in Blairgowrie after bypassing Rye, Tootgarook and Capel Sound. Currently where the southern section reaches Jetty Road in Rosebud, freeway conditions end, with a two-lane, single carriageway link from Jetty Road to Boneo Road. From Jetty Road the freeway was meant to adopt full freeway standards with overpasses over Jetty Road and Boneo Road, but this section has remained incomplete for over a decade. In July 2018 the Rye Internal Bypass was another project proposed to reduce traffic congestion in the area in the medium term at a cost of $5 million.

The Baillieu government committed $200,000 to a congestion study for the southern peninsula which was completed in 2012.

<text>Zlaté Moravce (; 1776 Morawce, , ) is a town in south-western Slovakia.

==Basic data==
It is the capital and the biggest town of Zlaté Moravce District. It is approximately 120 km from the Slovak capital Bratislava and 32 km from Nitra.

==History==

The town is situated on the banks of the river Žitava, in the northern part of the Podunajská Heights. Nowadays, it also includes the area of formerly separate boroughs Chyzerovce and Prílepy. Thanks to its favourable location on the natural terrace of the river Žitava, the traces of the continuous settlement of this area go back to the Paleolithic Age. The rich archeological findings in the town area also prove intensive Great Moravian settlement in the 9th-10th century. A unique finding – a golden pectoral cross – is associated with this settlement.

The origin of the oldest name of the borough &quot;Morowa&quot; in the Charter of Zobor of 1113 is related to that time as well. This charter is the oldest written proof of the existence of Moravce as Zobor Monastery&#x27;s property. The borough that was situated on the important route to Tekov was already in the 13th century dominated by a small Roman church surrounded by a cemetery, which was located on the site of today&#x27;s square.

The first written mentions of the town are from 12th century A.D. (1113 Morowa, 1284 Marouth). &quot;Moravce&quot; [pronounced app. Moravtseh], a word in plural, was a frequent settlement name in Slovakia and means &quot;settlement of (the tribe) Moravians&quot;. The attribute &quot;zlaté&quot;, meaning &quot;golden&quot;, was added only later in order to distinguish the settlement&#x27;s name from all the other &quot;Moravce&quot;s. Ottomans plundered the city in 1530 and 1573. Rivers (Žitava, Zlatnanka) in the surrounding areas were known in the past for gold washing. Note the name of the second river. Across Slavic languages, &quot;Zlato&quot; means gold.

In late 1700s, the town was purchased by Cristoph Cardinal Migazzi, who completed renovations of local chateau for purposes of his private summer residence.

==Demographics==
According to the 2001 census, the town had 15,618 inhabitants. 97.09% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 0.60% Czechs and 0.29% Hungarians. The religious makeup was 82.52% Roman Catholics, 10.59% people with no religious affiliation and 1.48% Lutherans. An active Jewish community had existed here until the Holocaust. Zlaté Moravce has a town status from 1960.

==Industry==
The town is known for the production of kitchen technologies (well known as a brand CALEX which is actually not existing in the present) and building materials - bricks.

==Historical monuments ==
*WWI and WWII victims
*Holocaust victims from Zlaté Moravce memorial

==Notable people==
*Janko Kráľ, a poet of Slovak Romanticism
*Ján Kocian, footballer, football trainer
*Tono Stano, photographer
*Imrich Chlamtac, President of EAI

==Twin towns — sister cities==
Zlaté Moravce is twinned with:

* Bučovice, Czech Republic
* Hulín, Czech Republic
* Velké Přílepy, Czech Republic
* Našice, Croatia
* Sierpc, Poland 
* Szydłów, Poland

<doc id="1060396" wikidata="Q4873880" url="?curid=1060396" title="Baxterwood Priory">
<text>Baxterwood Priory was a Benedictine monastery originally founded at Haswell, County Durham, England, and later at Baxterwood, with the monastic farm becoming the private residence of Haswell Grange (later demolished) and Elemore Grange since the 18th Century.

== Relocation and Re-Endowment ==
The monastery was originally founded as &quot;The Church of St Mary of Haswell&quot; by Henry Pudsey, a son of Bishop Pudsey, in the latter part of the 12th century. Two vills, Wingate and Haswell, were also conferred, probably, on the Canons of Gisburn. However, a better situation for a monastery was found at Baxterwood, possibly in 1196.

A second establishment was known as the &quot;New Place upon the Browney&quot; and dedicated to the Virgin Mary, with Stephen as the superintendent of the newly founded Augustinian priory. It was later appropriated by the nearby Benedictine monks of Durham Cathedral and became a Benedictine priory, its lands and vills being conferred on Finchale Priory. It was very close to the site of the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross on 17 October 1346 and on the battle site map along with Arbour House some way to the north.

== Haswell Grange ==
Haswell Grange was a Benedictine grange established on the site of the intended Augustinian Baxterwood monastery. The Grange was in use until the Dissolution of the Monasteries when it was sold. It was sold to the Newcastle merchant and politician Bertram Anderson (1505–71).

==Elemore Grange==
Haswell Grange was later demolished and the present Elemore Grange is believed to have been built on the same site during the later 18th century.

<doc id="1060399" wikidata="Q638011" url="?curid=1060399" title="Charley horse">
<text>A charley horse is an American term for a very painful involuntary cramp, most commonly occurring in the legs (usually located in the calf muscle) and/or foot, lasting anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of days. The phrase formerly referred more commonly to bruising of the quadriceps muscle of the anterior or lateral thigh, or contusion of the femur, that commonly results in a haematoma and sometimes several weeks of pain and disability. In this latter sense, such an injury is known as dead leg.

Dead legs and charley horses are two different types of injuries: A charley horse involves the muscles contracting without warning, and can last from a few seconds to a couple days. A dead leg often occurs in contact sports, such as football, when an athlete suffers a knee or other blunt trauma to the lateral quadriceps causing a haematoma or temporary paresis and antalgic gait as a result of pain.

Colloquially, taking a hit in the thigh area (thigh contusion) can also be referred to as a &quot;charley horse&quot; or even simply as a &quot;charley.&quot;

==Etymology==
The first known use of the term was in 1886 in a West Virginia newspaper. The origination of the phrase is credited to two baseball players, Jack Glasscock and Joe Quest.

==Cause==
Charley horses have many possible causes directly resulting from high or low pH or substrate concentrations in the blood, including hormonal imbalances, dehydration, low levels of magnesium, potassium, or calcium (evidence has been mixed), side effects of medication, or, more seriously, diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and neuropathy. Charley horses seem to be most common in individuals who engage in strenuous physical activities, such as those who work in construction or play sports. They are also a common complaint during pregnancy.

==Treatment==
Relief is given by massaging or stretching the leg or foot in the opposite direction of the cramp. Relief also comes from standing up, which serves to counter the muscle-tightening signal.

<doc id="1060404" wikidata="Q2993014" url="?curid=1060404" title="Bandh">
<text>Bandh () is a form of protest used by political activists in South Asian countries such as India and Nepal. It is similar to a general strike. During a bandh, a political party or a community declare a general strike. For example, a &quot;Bharat bandh&quot; is a call for a bandh across India, and a bandh can also be called for an individual state or municipality.

The community or political party declaring a bandh expects the general public to stay at home and not report for work. Shopkeepers are expected to keep their shops closed, and public transport operators are expected to stay off the road. There have been instances when large cities have been brought to a standstill. A bandh is a form of civil disobedience.

==Ban==
The Supreme Court of India banned bandhs in 1998, but political parties still organize them. In 2004, the Supreme Court of India fined two political parties, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena, for organizing a bandh in Mumbai as a protest against bomb blasts in the city. Supreme Court permits only voluntary closure of establishments during bandhs.

==Notable bandhs==
Bandhs are often by opposition parties. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and 13 parties not belonging to the United Progressive Alliance parties called for a nationwide bandh on 5 July 2010, to protest a fuel price hike. The bandh prevented Indians from carrying out day-to-day tasks, especially in states that were ruled by the NDA and the Left. In Nepal, calls for bandhs have increased due to political instability.

On 20 September 2012, the BJP and other parties called for a nationwide bandh in response to economic reforms undertaken by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his finance minister Palaniappan Chidambaram. Chief among their grievances were the cut in subsidies for diesel and cooking gas and the decision to allow foreign investors to own majority stakes in the retail sector, including supermarkets and department stores.

On 3 January 2018, Prakash Ambedkar called for a bandh in response to an attack on Buddhists, as well as some Hindu dalit and Sikh people by supporters of the Hindutva ideology at Koregaon Bhima in Pune district, Maharashtra, and the lack of police action against the culprits. More than 50 percent of Maharashtra&#x27;s population supported or participated in the bandh.

In August 2024 a bharat bandh was called by twenty one organisations in protest at the Indian Supreme Court ruling of 1 August 2024 allowing states to sub-classify scheduled castes and scheduled tribes for preferential employment quotas.

<doc id="1060406" wikidata="Q272040" url="?curid=1060406" title="Liptovský Mikuláš">
<text>Liptovský Mikuláš (; until 1952 &quot;Liptovský Svätý Mikuláš&quot;, ; ) is a town in northern Slovakia, on the Váh River, about from Bratislava. It lies in the Liptov region, in Liptov Basin near the Low Tatra and Tatra mountains. The town, known as Liptovský Svätý Mikuláš (or Liptovský Saint Nicholas) before communist times, is also renowned as a town of guilds and culture.

==History==
From the second half of the 10th century until 1918, it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The town of Mikuláš &quot;(Liptau-Sankt-Nikolaus)&quot; was first mentioned in the royal deed of King Ladislaus IV in 1286. The first written record mentioning the Church of Saint Nicolaus which was to become the founding element of a larger settlement dates back to 1299. The Church of Saint Nicolaus is the oldest building in the town of Liptovský Mikuláš.

Mikuláš was one of the foremost important centers of crafts in the Liptov region. The craftsmen formed guilds; the oldest guild was the shoemaker&#x27;s guild mentioned in 1508. There were also other guilds: the guild of smiths, furriers, tailors, hatters and butchers.

In 1677, Liptovský Mikuláš &quot;(Liptau-Sankt-Nikolaus)&quot; became the seat of the local district, as well as Comitatus Liptoviensis. The legendary Slovak &quot;Robin Hood&quot; Juraj Jánošík was sentenced and executed here in 1713 by being hung by the ribcage on a hook.

Liptovský Mikuláš played an important role for Slovaks in the 19th century during the period of magyarization. It was one of the centers of Slovak national movement. The first Slovak theater, &quot;The theater of G. F. Belopotocký&quot; was founded there in 1830. Liptovský Mikuláš was a home to an important Slovak romantic poet and national activist, Janko Kráľ, who was fighting for the right of self-determination of Slovak nation in the Hungarian Empire. Also another national revivalist Michal Miloslav Hodža lived there. The leader of Slovak national revival, Ľudovít Štúr, publicly revealed a document called &quot;The demands of Slovak nation&quot; in 1848 in Liptovský Mikuláš as an official appeal to the leaders of Austrian-Hungarian empire to help solve the present existentional problems of Slovak people (unsuccessful).

Before the establishment of independent Czechoslovakia in 1918, Liptovský Mikuláš was part of Liptó County within the Kingdom of Hungary. From 1939 to 1945, it was part of the Slovak Republic.

In the 20th century, many once independent villages were annexed to Liptovský Mikuláš. Thus, what was once the bucolic farmers&#x27; hamlet of Vrbica is now simply a street in the middle of the town.

==Tourism==
The town is one of the most famous tourist centers in Slovakia because of its rich cultural life and also because it is a perfect starting point for tourists, from where it is easy to reach the Low Tatras (Demänová valley) with well-known caves such as the Demänová Ice Cave or Demänová Cave of Freedom, or to the Western Tatras. Folk architecture can also be seen nearby in Vlkolínec near Ružomberok, or Pribylina, a few kilometers west of the town, and for recreation, the lake called Liptovská Mara is available. Since 2004 a new aquapark called &quot;Aquapark Tatralandia&quot; has been open. The area is also well-known due to its location close to the biggest ski resort in Slovakia, Jasná. Many modern lifts and recent additions made to its infrastructure have meant it has become a popular ski center for many western tourists over the last few years.

==Demographics==
According to the 2001 census, the town had 33,007 inhabitants. 94.07% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 2.30% Roma, 2.10% Czech and 0.28% Hungarians. The religious make-up was 34.48% Catholics, 32.26% people with no religious affiliation, and 26.85% Lutherans.
According to the Hungarian census of 1910, the population make up was 50% Slovak, 30% Hungarian 20% German. After World War II, the ethnic minorities were expelled leaving a majority Slovak population.

==Sport==
Ice hockey club HK 1932 Liptovský Mikuláš represents the city in Tipos extraliga.

The Ondrej Cibak Whitewater Slalom Course on the nearby Váh river is the oldest whitewater slalom course in Slovakia. The 2008 Olympic champion in canoe slalom, C-1, Michal Martikán was born and lives here. Also Elena Kaliská, another Olympic winner, is a member of the town sports club.

Petra Vlhová, born and raised in the city, won the alpine skiing slalom gold medal at the 2022 Winter Olympics. As a child she attended many training at a ski center at Podbreziny hill of the city. Martina Dubovská also trained at the center in her childhood. The ski center at Podbreziny was established in 1993 and was discontinued gradually in early 2010s. In 2022, it was restored and re-entered into usage. The tracks combine to a total length of 550 meters at peak altitude of 700 meters.

Liptovský Mikuláš hosted the 2012 FAI World Championship for Space Models, taking place from 31 August to 9 September.

==Transport==
Liptovský Mikuláš is located near the main Slovak D1 motorway, as well as being on the main railroad from Bratislava to Košice. The closest international airport is in Poprad. The town also has its own public transport network with 13 lines operating.

<doc id="1060409" wikidata="Q245680" url="?curid=1060409" title="Signal Hill, St. John's">
<text>Signal Hill is a hill which overlooks the harbour and city of St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The majority of Signal Hill, including Cabot Tower, is designated a National Historic Site. The highest point, Ladies&#x27; Lookout, is high. 

Due to its strategic placement overlooking the Narrows, the only entrance to the harbour, fortifications date back to the mid 17th century. On 12 December 1901, the first transatlantic wireless transmission was received there by Guglielmo Marconi.

Adjacent to the National Historic site is the Johnson Geo Centre and Johnson Geo Vista Park. The community of The Battery lies on the slope of the hill overlooking the harbour, and Memorial University of Newfoundland has a campus on the lower slopes, in the former Battery Hotel.

==History==
The final battle of the Seven Years&#x27; War in North America was fought in 1762 at the Battle of Signal Hill, in which the French surrendered St. John&#x27;s to a British force under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Amherst, who renamed what was then known as &quot;The Lookout&quot; as &quot;Signal Hill,&quot; because of the signalling that took place upon its summit from its flagmast. Flag communication between land and sea would take place there from the 17th century until 1960.

Signal Hill was designated as the citadel for St. John&#x27;s during its first construction period in the late 18th century.

During the 19th century, Signal Hill was manned specifically during the Napoleonic Wars and the American Civil War. A second construction period in Signal Hill&#x27;s history saw the construction of the Queen&#x27;s Battery Barracks, which has been completely restored to the period of 1862.

Construction on Cabot Tower began in 1897 to commemorate both the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897 and the 400th anniversary of John Cabot&#x27;s landfall which took place in 1497. The building was declared officially open in 1900. The practical uses of the building were flag mast signalling, and a Marconi wireless station which has since been moved to St. John&#x27;s International Airport.

On 12 December 1901, the first transatlantic wireless transmission was received by Guglielmo Marconi in the abandoned fever and diphtheria hospital, which has since been destroyed by fire. The transmission, in Morse code, originated from his Poldhu Wireless Station, Cornwall, United Kingdom.

The United States maintained anti-aircraft guns on the hill during World War II. A battery of two 8-inch M1888 railway guns was emplaced there on 1 May 1941, but relocated to Red Cliff circa 1943. Signal Hill was also one of three prepared sites for a battery of two 155 mm guns on Panama mounts.

==Signal Hill National Historic Site==
Signal Hill is a National Historic Site.

===Signal Hill Tattoo===

The Signal Hill Tattoo showcases the Royal Newfoundland Regiment of Foot from 1812, the Royal Newfoundland Regiment Band from 1795, and the Royal Newfoundland Regiment of 1917. Wearing full military uniforms from each period, the soldiers give a display by each section and portray the drills and battle tactics of the time. The Artillery provide an exhibition of cannon fire to add to the program.

===Cabot Tower===

Cabot Tower, located at the top of the hill, features exhibits about Guglielmo Marconi and the wireless station that operated in the tower. There is a gift shop, and an amateur radio station VO1AA, which may be operated by visiting amateur radio operators in the summer months. It is sponsored by the Society of Newfoundland Radio Amateurs. An active amateur radio repeater, VO1AAA 146.790+, is located inside the building and is operational year round. A tourist information radio station, CJSH-FM, also broadcasts from the Signal Hill site.

===Visitor Centre===
The visitor centre is open during the tourist season and features interactive exhibits, a film about the site&#x27;s military and communications history, and the history of St. John&#x27;s, along with a cafe.

==Trails==
The North Head Trail is located along the edge of St John&#x27;s Harbour and the sea. The Lady&#x27;s Lookout Trail descends steeply from Lady&#x27;s Lookout, above Cabot Tower, the highest point of Signal Hill, to the Burma Road trail. There is also a short trail to the summit of Gibbet Hill.

The Burma Road trail, built by American servicemen who manned coastal batteries on Signal Hill during the Second World War, runs from George&#x27;s Pond, Signal Hill Road to Cuckold&#x27;s Cove, close to Quidi Vidi. Along it there were barracks.

There are eight looped trails in the Johnson GEO Park with informative outdoor displays. Stoneworks and panels explain the local geological formations, botanical species, and traditional uses of stone. Completed in 2007, the park surrounds the Geo Centre and includes Deadman&#x27;s Pond acres the road. Both the Geo Park&#x27;s and Signal National Historic Park&#x27;s trails are linked to the Grand Concourse walkway system.

<text>The Half-Gallon Quarter-Acre Pavlova Paradise was a popular book by Austin Mitchell, published by Whitcombe and Tombs (Christchurch, 1972), with illustrations by Les Gibbard. It provided a witty, satirical description of life in 1960s New Zealand, and Kiwi culture.

Described as &quot;a celebrated vision of New Zealand as heaven on earth&quot;, the book was a great success in New Zealand. The phrase &quot;Half-Gallon Quarter-Acre Pavlova Paradise&quot; soon became part of the New Zealand vernacular, with the term &quot;quarter-acre pavlova paradise&quot; being included in the &quot;Dictionary of New Zealand English&quot;. Mitchell revisited New Zealand 30 years after writing his original volume, and motivated by the social changes he observed, he penned a sequel entitled &quot;Pavlova Paradise Revisited&quot;.

== Terminology ==
* &quot;Half Gallon&quot;, popularly called the &quot;Half G&quot;, was the standard size of a flagon of beer then sold in New Zealand pubs
* &quot;Quarter Acre&quot; referred to the ubiquitous suburban section of land on which most Kiwis built their homes
* &quot;Pavlova&quot;, a popular New Zealand dessert

<text>Sofitel Hotels &amp; Resorts is a French hotel chain of luxury hotels based in Paris, France, and owned by Accor since 1980. Founded in 1964 in France, Sofitel quickly developed worldwide to reach more than 200 properties. In 2008, Sofitel became a brand of luxury hotels only, downsized its property count to 89, and created new brands. Sofitel had 130 properties by January 2023.

== History ==

Banque Paribas opened the first Sofitel in Strasbourg (France) on 26 June 1964, the Sofitel Strasbourg Grande Île, which was the first 5-star hotel in the city.

=== International development ===

In the 1970s, Sofitel became an international chain of hotels. The first Sofitel in the United States opened in 1975 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Sofitel entered the US market with a French approach to hospitality, making French baguettes on site, offering a wide selection of wines, providing bidets in 1/3 of the rooms, and hiring French chefs to manage the kitchens. The hotel turned a profit within 18 months of operations. 

In 1980, Sofitel was purchased by Novotel SIEH (renamed Accor in 1983), and joined the group&#x27;s hotel brands: Novotel, Mercure, Ibis.

The first Sofitel in Colombia opened in 1995, and the first Sofitel in Japan opened in 1996. In 1997, the group announced the opening of the Sofitel New York Hotel, a $90 million investment on West 44th Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas (next to the New York Yacht Club).

In the early 2000s, Sofitel went through a major expansion plan in Asia, targeting beach resorts in Thailand, China and Indonesia. Sofitel also opened the Sofitel Tokyo, the Sofitel St James London, Sofitel Chicago Water Tower, Sofitel Lafayette Square Washington D.C., Sofitel Marrakech, Sofitel Silom Bangkok, Sofitel Montréal and Sofitel Buenos Aires. Between 2003 and 2004, Sofitel opened 14 locations, including the Sofitel Mexico City, its first hotel in Mexico, and 7 new locations in Asia. By 2010, Sofitel had more than 20 properties in China.

=== Luxury and asset-light strategy ===
In 2005, Accor North America decided to apply a joint-venture model on the ownership of 6 of its 11 North-American Sofitel properties to develop new growth opportunities. Then in 2007, the brand underwent a global overhaul. The number of hotels was reduced by 50% and a high-end offer around the Sofitel brand inspired by the French &quot;Art de vivre&quot; was developed. Sofitel adopted an asset-light strategy (less ownership in properties) to bring more focus on hotel management and related services.

Between 2009 and 2012, 30 new properties were added to Sofitel&#x27;s portfolio, reaching 120 properties in 2012: The Hotel Carrasco in Montevideo, its first hotel in Uruguay, and the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi in Vietnam. The 182-room Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom designed by French architect Jean Nouvel (2010); The Grand Amsterdam (2011). By 2013, Sofitel managed 8 properties in the Middle East with plans for further expansion. The Dubai Downtown opened in 2014, and Sofitel Jeddah in 2015. The Sofitel Dubai The Palm Resort &amp; Spa and the Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort both opened in 2013 with plans to further develop Sofitel&#x27;s network of resorts in the Middle East and Africa. In June 2017, Sofitel announced the construction of its highest property so far in the Middle East, the Sofitel Dubai Wafi.

Sofitel worked with fashion designers to create the So Sofitel artsy hotels: Kenzo Takada for the Sofitel So Mauritius, Christian Lacroix for the Sofitel So Bangkok, Karl Lagerfeld for the Sofitel So Singapore, and Polpat Asavaprapha for the Sofitel So Hua Hin.

=== Other Sofitel products ===
In July 2009, Sofitel launched the “So SPA by Sofitel” concept at the Saint James Hotel in London and at the Sofitel Marseille Vieux Port location. So SPA&#x27;s development in Asia started in 2013.

In December 2014, during the Marrakech International Film Festival, Sofitel launched the first edition of &quot;La Nuit by Sofitel&quot;, recurring parties organized by Sofitel and happening around noteworthy fashionable events worldwide.

== Notable Properties ==
This is a non-exhaustive list of notable Sofitel Hotels &amp; Resorts properties:

*Sofitel Dubai The Obelisk
*Sofitel Frankfurt Opera
*Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi

=== 4 Star Notable hotels ===
*Sofitel Chicago Magnificent Mile
*Sofitel New York Hotel

== Sustainable development ==
As a member of the AccorHotels group, Sofitel Hotels &amp; Resorts applies the sustainable development policies set by the group. In April 2016, AccorHotels announced that a 1,000 of its hotels, including Sofitel properties, now needed to weigh and record all thrown away foods to reduce food waste. The number of items on menus shrank to 10-20 and those courses must use seasonal local products as much as possible. The group also planned the opening of 1,000 vegetable gardens within its properties, including Sofitel properties, by 2020. In Etterbeek, the honey served by Sofitel is produced on the building&#x27;s roof by a professional beekeeper.

<doc id="1060418" wikidata="Q890343" url="?curid=1060418" title="The 10th Kingdom">
<text>The 10th Kingdom is an American fairytale fantasy miniseries written by Simon Moore and produced by Britain&#x27;s Carnival Films, Germany&#x27;s Babelsberg Film und Fernsehen, and the US&#x27;s Hallmark Entertainment. It depicts the adventures of a young woman and her father after they are transported from New York City, through a magical mirror, into a parallel world of fairy tales.

The miniseries was initially broadcast over five nights in two-hour episodes, each airing weekly, on NBC, beginning February 27, 2000 and concluding March 6 of that same year. It won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design in 2000. The premiere had over 14.04 million viewers.

==Plot==
In a hidden realm, fairy tale characters inhabit nine magical kingdoms where an Evil Queen plots to rule them. She is held in a Fourth Kingdom prison. This kingdom is under the rule of Prince Wendell, the spoiled, arrogant grandson of Snow White. Weeks before his coronation ceremony, the Queen enlists the help of the brutal Troll King and his three children to release her right before the Prince makes his annual visit to the prison. Prince Wendell is captured by the Evil Queen, who is his wicked stepmother. She turns him into a Golden Retriever while her very own retriever is transformed into a facsimile of Wendell. In a panic, the transformed Prince flees through the prison, stumbles across a mirror portal in the basement, and is transported to New York City. The Troll King orders his bumbling children Burly, Blabberwort, and Bluebell to bring back the escaped Prince while the Queen releases a half-wolf prisoner (who is simply called Wolf) to retrieve him instead.

Meanwhile, two regular Manhattan inhabitants, headstrong waitress Virginia Lewis and her oafish father Tony are entangled in the mishaps caused by the new magical arrivals to the city, including Wolf falling helplessly in love with Virginia and Tony being given six wishes (which he foolishly uses for personal gain, upon which they have a tendency to backfire). With Virginia having already determined that the transformed Wendell (named by a fellow waitress as &#x27;Prince&#x27; even before Virginia learns his identity)--is more than just a normal dog, Tony uses his last wish to acquire the ability to understand the dog, who urges them to travel back to The Nine Kingdoms with him to break the spell. Tony, feeling responsible for Prince, reluctantly accepts, and Virginia and Tony are taken back to the realm through the magic mirror.

At first, Tony and Virginia are desperate to just get home, while the magic mirror is being taken from place to place around the Kingdoms - being cleared out of the prison, taken as a prize for a sheep-rearing contest, and then sold in an auction. The group travels the lands in pursuit of the mirror, facing many dangers and challenges in the process, including Virginia&#x27;s hair being enchanted to an impossible length, pursuit by the Queen&#x27;s Huntsman, and a conspiracy by the descendants of Little Bo Peep to control a town&#x27;s wishing well. During their journey, Wolf questions his loyalty to the Queen in order to gain favor with stubborn Virginia and quickly sides with them. This act prompts the Queen to send her relentless and cold-blooded Huntsman to capture the Prince along with Virginia and Tony.

Virginia eventually meets the ghost of Snow White, who reveals she is destined to save the Nine Kingdoms. Tony also recognizes the Queen as his long lost wife and Virginia’s mother. They travel to the castle to stop her, but Wolf seems to have betrayed Tony and Virginia. They are thrown into the dungeons where Tony reveals to Virginia that her mother had been suffering a mental breakdown and had tried to drown Virginia the night she left. The Queen has her imposter Prince Wendell crowned king and then tries to poison all the monarchs who attend the ceremony.

Luckily, Wolf had switched the poison for a sleeping potion, so everyone wakes up unharmed. Virginia must kill the Evil Queen in self-defense, which pains her greatly. The real Prince Wendell turns back into a human and takes the throne, pardoning the trolls, and allowing them to return to their kingdom after the death of their father. Grateful to Tony for all of his help, now-King Wendell offers him a job at the palace, which he accepts. Virginia and Wolf, now expecting a child, return to New York City.

==Cast and characters==
* Kimberly Williams as Virginia Lewis - Virginia is a pretty 21-year-old woman who lives on the edge of Central Park with her father. Virginia, whilst very cynical and tired, is also an aspiring restaurateur, and while she claims that she does not care about her mother or dating, it soon becomes obvious that she feels very lonely. She later reveals that she blames herself for her mother leaving. At first she cares only about returning to her own world, but she eventually commits to helping Wendell rescue his kingdom. Virginia must learn how to face the pain caused when her mother abandoned her. Slowly she develops feelings for Wolf. According to Ron Wertheimer (New York Times), Virginia is a plucky waitress on her way to self-confidence.
* John Larroquette as Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Lewis - Tony is a janitor and single father who is mostly oblivious of his daughter Virginia&#x27;s problems, and feelings. In the beginning, he is generally a lazy, selfish coward, but forced out of his former life, he grows and fights to save Virginia, Wendell, and himself, becoming a far better person in the process.
* Scott Cohen as Wolf - Wolf is released from the Snow White Memorial Prison (he was imprisoned there for &quot;sheep worrying&quot;) by the Evil Queen after he swears allegiance to her. He goes to New York City in search of Prince Wendell and meets Virginia, with whom he falls instantly in love. He spends most of the film helping Virginia and Tony escape the kingdoms, falling more in love with Virginia.
* Dianne Wiest as Christine White usually referred to as the Evil Queen - The main antagonist of the film and Prince Wendell&#x27;s stepmother. She had been sentenced to life in prison for murdering both of Wendell&#x27;s parents and almost killing him. Later in the series, she is revealed to be Virginia&#x27;s mother. Prior to the events in the miniseries, Christine discovered the traveling mirror after suffering a mental breakdown and running away from a failed attempt to kill Virginia. She was taken in by the Swamp Witch (Snow White&#x27;s stepmother) and became her apprentice. The plot of the series concerns her plan to take over the Nine Kingdoms. At the start of the show, she is released from prison and turns Wendell into a dog.
* Daniel Lapaine as Prince Wendell - Snow White&#x27;s grandson, the spoiled, arrogant, and bored heir to the throne of the 4th kingdom, Prince Wendell spends most of the film as a golden retriever. He can only communicate with Tony and slowly becomes more humble and responsible. After his adventures and times with Tony, he&#x27;s left somewhat fascinated by the modern 10th Kingdom (New York City) and insists on Tony building him a &quot;bouncing castle&quot; and thus encourages Tony to give him an Industrial Revolution.
* Rutger Hauer as The Huntsman - The Evil Queen&#x27;s huntsman, who is sent to kill Virginia and Tony, carries a magical crossbow that never fails to hit the heart of a living thing when fired. The Huntsman is completely devoted to the Evil Queen and firmly believes in fate and destiny, holding no interest in mercy.
* Ed O&#x27;Neill as Relish, the Troll King - Relish is the king of the troll kingdom and the father of Burly, Blabberwort, and Bluebell. He temporarily joins forces with the Evil Queen, but later abandons her plans for conquest when he decides to take the 4th Kingdom for himself. 
* Hugh O&#x27;Gorman, Dawnn Lewis, and Jeremiah Birkett as Burly, Blabberwort, and Bluebell - Three troll siblings who are released from the Snow White Memorial Prison by their father, who, not long after that, are given a task by the Evil Queen that they attempt to complete of hunting down Prince Wendell, then later Virginia and Tony. They spend a large part of the film as golden statues after Tony misuses a magic spell.
* Camryn Manheim as Snow White - She is mentioned many times and is eventually seen by only Virginia and her grandson Prince Wendell (as a dog) in a white cavern in an ice-like coffin. She has been protecting Virginia and shielding her image from the Evil Queen. Upon meeting her she tells Virginia her childhood story and tells Virginia that she is destined for many great things and gives her advice on how to kill the Evil Queen.
* Ann-Margret as Cinderella - She&#x27;s one of the oldest living fabled-princesses of the Nine Kingdoms.
* Moira Lister as Virginia&#x27;s Grandmother - She despises her son-in-law Tony because he&#x27;s a lower class, but loves Virginia and thinks she needs to marry into high society. 
* Warwick Davis as Acorn, the Dwarf - He helps Tony and the others escape from prison. He later sells various stolen goods, such as the magic mirror. He reappears again while hiding in the swamps in the very house Snow White&#x27;s evil stepmother had lived. He gives Virginia a brief time to rest when she&#x27;s searching for her father and even lets her see the Evil Queen&#x27;s tomb. Afterward, he directs her to where she could find Tony.
* Jimmy Nail as Clayface, the Goblin - He, along with Acorn the Dwarf, helps Tony and the Others escape prison. He was supposed to appear in episode 5 but his actor took another acting job putting Acorn in his place.
* Lucy Punch as Sally Peep - A shepherdess living in Little Lamb Village on the edge of the Enchanted Forest. Virginia competes against Sally Peep in the Sheep and Shepherdess competition to win the traveling mirror, which is the first place prize.

==Production==
Simon Moore, writer of the screenplay, wondered about what happened after the Happily Ever After of old fairytales. His vision became &quot;The 10th Kingdom&quot;.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;There are humorous allusions to familiar characters like the Seven Dwarfs and Rapunzel throughout the 10 hours and appearances by updated versions of Snow White (Camryn Manheim) and Cinderella (Ann-Margret).&quot; Executive producer Robert Halmi Sr. explains, &quot;We wanted to take the flip side of these well-known characters. For instance, Cinderella is now 200 years old. And Camryn took her part because she loved the idea that Snow White was now overweight.&quot; Camryn Manheim elaborates, &quot;Well, I&#x27;ve been playing her in my bedroom for many years now, so I was ready for her. But it was wonderful, I grew up reading about Snow White and fantasizing about being the fairest of them all, and there I was. My manager told me that NBC had offered me the role of Snow White and I said, &#x27;I&#x27;ll take it.&#x27; I agreed to do it even before reading the script because I was so thrilled that they were moving away from the conventional Snow White. I am playing Snow White, and we&#x27;ve come very far from that image when I grew up and we&#x27;re getting all kinds of images of beauty. So it was really thrilling to get in that tight corset and be able to accentuate my assets, no pun intended and, yes, it was a throwback to my finer days&quot;
&quot;The Times&quot; reported that Virginia Lewis&#x27;s portrayer, Kimberly Williams, &quot;prefers to work in film and theatre rather than television. &quot;Because TV happens so fast, I feel a sense of panic,&quot; she explains. Yet, despite the misgivings, she could not resist the offer to star in &quot;The 10th Kingdom&quot; alongside Dianne Wiest, Jimmy Nail, and Rutger Hauer. &quot;Simon has woven together all the old fairytales and updated them, exploring what happened after Happily Ever After,&quot; explains Williams, whose character Virginia is a New York waitress thrust into a parallel world inhabited by trolls, talking dogs, and evil stepmothers.&quot;.

==Broadcast and reception==
The miniseries was initially broadcast as five two-hour episodes on NBC, beginning February 27, 2000. &quot;The 10th Kingdom&quot; won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design in 2000.

It was broadcast in the United Kingdom on Sky One. 

Variety&#x27;s Laura Fries (Feb. 21, 2000) asserted that &quot;Kimberly Williams is doe-eyed and pretty and is heavily featured throughout, but 10 hours is a lot for this star to carry on her shoulders.&quot; Christopher Null &quot;Filmcritic.com&quot; felt that &quot;Larroquette was an unfortunate casting choice. 30 minutes of &quot;Night Court&quot; has always been my limit on the guy. 417 minutes is too much of his abrasive attitude to handle.&quot;

==Related media==
During the original airing of &quot;The 10th Kingdom&quot; there was a toll-free number displayed so that one could order a set of the novelization, the CD soundtrack, and the entire miniseries on three VHS tapes. In May 2000, &quot;The 10th Kingdom&quot; was released by Hallmark Entertainment and Artisan Entertainment (now Lions Gate Entertainment) on VHS as both a two-tape set and as an Extended Play single tape edition. Approximately two hours of the miniseries were cut out to make it fit on two tapes. None of the footage dealt with major plot elements, but the sheer amount removed resulted in a significantly different viewing experience.

The miniseries was later released as aired on a three-disc DVD set in October 2000. A two-disc set followed in May 2002, which utilized one double-sided disc and one single-sided disc and included the special feature &quot;The 10th Kingdom: The Making of an Epic&quot;, hosted by John Larroquette. The complete 5 episode series was made available for instant streaming on Netflix as of the 3rd week of August 2012. This is the first time the series was presented in individual episode format since the initial broadcast on NBC.

On March 19, 2013, after several years of unavailability, Mill Creek Entertainment reissued the complete miniseries on 3 DVDs, retaining the making-of featurette and presents the miniseries as five separate parts. Also on that date, it was made available on Amazon.

On November 3, 2015, Mill Creek Entertainment released &quot;The 10th Kingdom - &quot;15th Anniversary Special Edition&quot;&quot; Blu-ray, marking its first-ever high-definition release.

The novelization, released in February 2000 by Hallmark-Kensington Books, was written by Kristine Kathryn Rusch and Dean Wesley Smith under the name Kathryn Wesley. The novel was based on an early version of the script; however, only a few differences exist between the novel and the film, with most being slight changes in conversations and other minor details. For a number of years, it was available in a package with the VHS release of the movie and the soundtrack, but it is now out of print.

===Soundtrack===
Varèse Sarabande released a soundtrack album on compact disc, featuring the score by Anne Dudley and the Miriam Stockley cover version of &quot;Wishing on a Star&quot; heard over the opening title and end credits of each episode.

<text>Gnaeus Cornelius Cinna Magnus (born between 47 BC and 35 BC) was an ancient Roman politician and the son of suffect consul Lucius Cornelius Cinna and Pompeia Magna. His sister was Magna.

His maternal grandparents were triumvir Pompey and Mucia Tertia, while his paternal grandparents were consul Lucius Cornelius Cinna and an unnamed Roman woman. Cinna is the only grandson of Pompey who has the name ‘Magnus’, or, indeed, any part of his name. 

Cinna became a supporter to triumvir Mark Antony. He was promoted to a priesthood. In 16 BC, Cinna and Aemilia Lepida, the granddaughter of triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, were involved in a conspiracy against the Emperor Augustus. Cinna and Lepida were the first and last people pardoned by the emperor after having conspired against him. Indeed, this was famously the last documented conspiracy against Augustus. Cinna served as a consul in 5 AD and is said to have been a close friend and adviser to Augustus until his death.

Cinna is the main character of a tragedy called &quot;Cinna&quot; by the famous 17th-century French playwright Corneille.

<doc id="1060423" wikidata="Q571268" url="?curid=1060423" title="South polar skua">
<text>The south polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki) is a large seabird in the skua family, Stercorariidae. An older name for the bird is MacCormick&#x27;s skua, after explorer and naval surgeon Robert McCormick, who first collected the type specimen. This species and the other large skuas, such as the great skua, are sometimes placed in a separate genus &quot;Catharacta&quot;.

==Description==
The south polar skua is a large bird (though small compared to other skuas sometimes placed in &quot;Catharacta&quot;) that measures around in length. Adults are greyish brown above, and have a whitish (pale morph) or straw-brown (intermediate morph) head and underparts, and the contrast between head and body makes it easy to separate from similar species with good views. Juveniles and adult dark morphs are harder to distinguish from their relatives, and more subjective or difficult-to-observe criteria, such as the colder brown plumage and blue bill base, must be used.

===Identification===
Distinguishing this skua from the Northern Hemisphere Arctic, pomarine, and long-tailed skuas is relatively straightforward. The large size, massive barrel chest, and white wing flashes of this bird are distinctive even at a distance. The flight is direct and powerful. Identification of this skua is more complicated when it is necessary to distinguish it from the closely related great skua of the North Atlantic, and the other large Southern Hemisphere skuas. Identification problems make claims of any Southern Hemisphere skua in the eastern North Atlantic problematic, and few records of south polar skua have been accepted in Western Europe. Similar problems occur, of course, with extralimital claims of great skua.

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds on Antarctic coasts, usually laying two eggs in November and December. It is a migrant, wintering at sea in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans. In the eastern North Atlantic, it is replaced by the closely-related great skua (&quot;S. skua&quot;). South polar skuas have been seen at the actual Geographic South Pole. Megalestris Hill, on Petermann Island in the Wilhelm Archipelago of Antarctica, is named after an obsolete generic name for the south polar skua.

==Behavior==
Like other skuas, it flies at the head of a human or other intruder approaching its nest.

===Feeding===
The south polar skua eats mainly fish, often obtained by robbing gulls, terns and even gannets of their catches. It also eats other birds, rabbits, and carrion. Like most other skua species, it continues this piratical behavior throughout the year, showing less agility and more brute force than the smaller skuas (jaegers) when it harasses its victims.

<doc id="1060430" wikidata="Q1950186" url="?curid=1060430" title="Tokaj (Slovakia)">
<text>Tokaj wine region () is a wine-growing region located in south-eastern Slovakia and north-eastern Hungary. The two vine-growing areas were once part of the greater Tokaj wine region (also &quot;Tokaj-Hegyalja wine region&quot; or &quot;Tokaj-Hegyalja&quot;) of the Kingdom of Hungary. 
Following the Treaty of Trianon, a smaller part (3 villages and about 175 hectares of vineyards) became part of Czechoslovakia, and after 1993, Slovakia. The majority of the region (around 28 communities and some 5,500 hectares of vineyards) remained part of Hungary.

Nowadays, the Slovak part of the Tokaj wine region comprises 7 communities and approximately 908 hectares of vineyards. Under the current EU legislation, the vintners in the Slovak wine region of Tokaj may use the &quot;Tokaj&quot; label (or &quot;Tokajský/-á/-é&quot; which means “of Tokaj” in Slovak).

==History==
Vine growing in Tokaj wine region goes back to the Roman times, when the area belonged to the Roman province of Pannonia. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the vine growing tradition was continued by Slavs. It is believed that the name of the village and mountain Tokaj has a Slavic origin. It is derived from the word “Stokaj,” loosely referring to a confluence of two rivers, in this case the rivers Bodrog and Tisza.

Legend says that when Hungarians, led by Álmos and his son Árpád, reached this area, viticulture had already been flourishing. Árpád&#x27;s valiant knight Turzol was first to climb the summit, and on return he reported to his master that the hillside was covered throughout with tranquil vineyards. Árpád then awarded Turzol not only with the hill, but also the entire area up to the intersection of the Bodrog and Tisza rivers. The village of Turzol was built here (today Tarcal). 
In 1241, the invasion of Tatars left the area plundered and its vineyards destroyed. King Béla IV of Hungary (1235-1270) decided to bring a new life to the region and colonized it by Latin people.

The settlers were probably Walloons from northern France, although some researchers claim that those were Italians. The Slovak village of Bara (Hungarian: &quot;Bári&quot;) was colonized by Italian settlers who brought with them new wine growing skills and traditions, as well as a base variety Furmint. After the Turkish wars which began in 1528, the region stayed under Turkish rule for 170 years. Most of Tokaj cellars date back to that period, when they were built as hideouts for people and property from the plundering soldiers.

Around 1620 the emperor imported a Walloon-French winefarmer Duvont, who later invented the later known &quot;king of wines&quot;-methode in the Tokaji-district.
In honour of Mr. Duvonts exceptional skills, the emperor ennobled this farmer, and gave him one of his many villages (Kiralyfalva) now Königsdorf in Austria. The emperor then named the family Királyfalvy.

Tokaji wine became an increasingly important commodity for the region from the 17th century, its export being a major source of income for the ruling princes of Transylvania to which the Tokaj region belonged at the time. Indeed, revenues from the increasingly renowned Tokaji Aszú wine helped to pay for the wars of independence fought against Austrian Habsburg rule. The repute of Tokaji wine was enhanced when in 1703, Francis II Rákóczi, prince of Transylvania, gave King Louis XIV of France a gift of numerous bottles of wine from his Tokaj estate. Tokaji wine was then served at the Versailles Court, where it became known under the name of Tokay. Delighted with the precious beverage, Louis XIV declared it &quot;Vinum Regum, Rex Vinorum&quot; (&quot;Wine of Kings, King of Wines&quot;).

In the 18th Century, Tokaj reached the height of its prosperity. Both Poland and Russia had become major export markets for its wine. Such was the importance of Tokaji in Russia, that the Russian emperors maintained a de facto colony in Tokaj in order to guarantee the supply of wine to the Imperial Court.

The partition of Poland in 1795 and subsequent imposition of customs duties dealt a severe blow to the exports of Tokaji wine and precipitated the economic decline of the region. However, this was only the first of three major crises for Tokaj. The second occurred when the phylloxera epidemic reached Tokaj in 1885 and destroyed the vast majority of the vineyards in a matter of years.

==Division of Tokaj-Hegyalja==
Following the signature of the peace Treaty of Trianon in June 1920, Hungary lost two-thirds of its territory, and the Tokaj wine region was divided between Hungary and the newly created Czechoslovakia. A state border has been set on the Ronyva creek and small suburb of Hungarian town Sátoraljaújhely (Kiskarlapuszta, Nagykarlapuszta, Állomás) was granted to Czechoslovakia (today Slovakia) and became a village called Slovenské Nové Mesto (English: &quot;Slovak New Town&quot;), (Hungarian: &quot;Újhely&quot;). Out of the historical Tokaj-Hegyalja wine region, Czechoslovakia gained an area of 175 hectares of vineyards and 3 villages: Malá Tŕňa (Hungarian: &quot;Kistoronya&quot;), Slovenské Nové Mesto (Hungarian: &quot;Újhely&quot;) and Viničky (Hungarian: &quot;Szőlőske&quot;). During the inter-war period, Slovakia&#x27;s production of Tokaj wine was concentrated in Malá Tŕňa, which has always been the principal wine-growing locale in the area, and the local viticultural school was also located there (with instruction in Hungarian). In 1924, a viticultural research station was built there in order to improve the vinegrowing and winemaking techniques in the region. Following the First Vienna Award in 1938, Hungary gained once again the territory and held it until 1944.

Not much has changed since the partition of the wine region. The majority of local population has been using Hungarian as their first language and they have preserved winemaking as well as other traditions just like before the Treaty of Trianon. The winemakers continued producing Tokaj wines according to the old Hungarian legislation (law of former ministry of agriculture n° XLVII from 17.12.1908). In 1958, the research station in Malá Tŕňa prepared a proposal regarding the future development of the Tokaj wine region in Czechoslovakia. In 1959, the Czechoslovak government passed new legislation and expanded the region by adding 4 more neighboring villages: Veľká Tŕňa (Hungarian: &quot;Nagytoronya&quot;), Bara (Hungarian: &quot;Bári&quot;), Čerhov (Hungarian: &quot;Csörgő&quot;) and Černochov (Hungarian: &quot;Csarnahó&quot;). With addition of these new communities, the total surface of classified Tokaj vineyards became 703,10 ha. 
Another legislation has been passed in 1996, expanding the surface to 908,11 ha of classified Tokaj vineyards.

A detailed map of the Slovak part of the Tokaj wine region has been drawn in 2016 and is visible on multiple tourist information panels on the Slovak side of the appelation. 

== Characteristics of the wine region ==
Tokaj wine region is one of a handful in the world whose conditions are favourable for growing grapes for naturally sweet
wines. With its 908 ha, Tokaj is the smallest of the six vine-growing regions of Slovakia. It comprises 7 villages in the Trebišov District: Bara, Čerhov, Černochov, Malá Tŕňa, Slovenské Nové Mesto, Veľká Tŕňa, and Viničky.

Some of the characteristics which make the Tokaj wine region unique are:

*Soil and microclimate: The Tokaj terrain consists of clay or loess soil on volcanic subsoil. The microclimate is determined by the sunny, south-facing slopes and the proximity of the Tisza and Bodrog rivers, and is conducive to the proliferation of Botrytis Cinerea (noble rot) and the subsequent desiccation of the grapes.
*Indigenous grape varieties: Furmint and Lipovina have been cultivated in the region for centuries and, together with Yellow Muscat and Zeta, are the only grape varieties officially permitted for use in the region.
*Cellars: A vast system of cellars has been carved out of solid rock. They provide a constant temperature of around 12 °C and high humidity of around 95%, which are ideal for the aging of Tokaji wines.
*Appellation system: A royal decree in 1757 established a closed production district in Tokaj, the world&#x27;s first system of wine appellation. Vineyard classification began in 1730 and was completed by the national censuses of 1765 and 1772.

==Winemakers and Wine Styles==

Wine makers from the Slovak side of the border produce quality dessert as well as dry wines similar to those of the Hungarian wine region. 
The Tokaj wines () made exclusively from 3 base varieties Furmint, Lipovina and Yellow Muscat (Slovak: &quot;Muškát žltý&quot;) grapes, are:

* &quot;Tokajský Furmint&quot;
* &quot;Tokajská Lipovina&quot;
* &quot;Tokajský Muškát žltý&quot; (Yellow Muscat)
*&quot;Tokajské samorodné suché&quot; (samorodné derived from a Slovak word meaning &quot;the way it was grown&quot;, suché means &quot;dry&quot;): Samorodné wine is set apart from ordinary wine in that it is made from bunches which contain a considerable proportion of botrytised grapes. Because of this, Samorodné is typically higher in extract than ordinary wine.
*&quot;Tokajské samorodné sladké&quot; (sladké means &quot;sweet&quot;)is set apart from ordinary wine in that it is made from bunches which contain a bigger proportion of botrytised grapes.
*&quot;Tokajský výber&quot; (in Hungarian: &quot;aszú&quot;): This is the wine which made Tokaj world famous. It is a sweet dessert wine made by individually picking botrytised grapes and trampling them in huge vats to form a paste. Must is then poured on the paste and left to soak before the wine is transferred to wooden casks where fermentation in completed. The wines are graded from 3 to 6 &quot;putňa&quot; (), representing the level of sugar and sugar-free extract in the mature wine.
* &quot;Tokajská výberová esencia&quot; (the Hungarian version is called &quot;aszú-eszencia&quot;)
* &quot;Tokajská esencia-nektár&quot; (meaning &quot;essence-nectar&quot;)
* &quot;Tokajský mášláš&quot; (derived from the Hungarian word &quot;máslás&quot;)
* &quot;Tokajský fordítáš&quot; (derived from the Hungarian word &quot;fordítás&quot;)

== The &quot;Designation of origin&quot; dispute ==

Tokaj wine is, by its unique character, a luxurious commodity with a strong appeal to the international market.

The dispute started in 1964 when, for the first time, the then Czechoslovakia exported its excessive production of Tokaj wine to Austria, the market that used to be solely supplied with this commodity by Hungary. The conflict of interests was settled in a bilateral agreement according to which Slovakia - at the expense of the Czech beer-related concession on Hungarian part - was only allowed to export its overproduction of Tokaj wine to Hungary (which consequently re-labeled and re-exported it). This agreement expired in 1990 after which date the dispute arose again.
In November 2012, the European Court ruled against Hungary’s request to erase the Slovak entry “Vinohradnícka oblasť Tokaj” from “E-Bacchus”, an electronic database containing a register of designations of origin and geographical indications protected in the EU. Hungary lodged an appeal against the judgement of the General Court. In February 2013, the EU Court of Justice has turned down the Hungarian appeal against an earlier ruling concerning Slovakia&#x27;s registration of “Vinohradnícka oblasť Tokaj” (Tokaj Wine Region), which contains the name of Hungary’s Tokaj region. In its ruling, the court said that Slovakia’s registering its “Vinohradnícka oblasť Tokaj” in the European database E-Bacchus did not constitute an actionable measure. As a result, under the current EU legislation the wine-growing region of Tokaj is located in both Hungary and Slovakia. Therefore, wine producers from both the Hungarian Tokaj region and the Slovak Tokaj region may use the Tokaj brand name.

<text>VH1 MegaHits was a Latin American pay television music channel. It was owned by ViacomCBS Networks Brazil, subsidiary of ViacomCBS Networks Americas and aired music videos throughout its entire day.

VH1 MegaHits featured four different blocks of programming: &quot;In Motion&quot;, &quot;Nothing But Classics&quot;, &quot;VH1 Shuffle&quot; and &quot;Moods&quot;. It was somewhat equivalent to MTV Hits in its programming style, though the latter also featured artists interviews and album/music video recording featurettes, whereas VH1 MegaHits was completely dependent on music videos.

The network launched as MTV Hits in Brazil on 22 June 2005, and was re-branded as VH1 MegaHits on 29 January 2010 after a local re-configuration of Viacom&#x27;s domestic properties in Brazil.

In Brazil, by decision of Viacom, the channel was manually replaced by MTV Live HD on 31 July 2020 in most TV providers that didn&#x27;t have the channel yet.

VH1 MegaHits had its signal switched off on 31 August 2020, one day after the broadcast of the 2020 MTV VMAs. As well as MTV Hits US, the channel was directly replaced by NickMusic on August 31, 2020. The last music video played on the channel was &quot;Bulletproof&quot; by La Roux.

==VH1 MegaHits in the United States==

VH1 MegaHits in the United States was a fully automated music video channel which played mostly top 40 adult contemporary videos from throughout VH1&#x27;s history, from the &#x27;80s to the early years of the 21st century. It shared the same eight-hour automated loop schedule that VH1 Classic and VH1 Country also had at the time. As with its sister networks, it was exclusive to digital cable and never had any satellite service carriage.

Due to low viewership and cable carriage, the channel was discontinued at the end of June 2005. The satellite space was used by corporate parent MTV Networks to launch Logo, a subscription network targeted at the gay community. Logo TV previously aired two music video-based programs, &quot;NewNowNext Music&quot; and &quot;The Click List: Top 10 Videos&quot;.

<doc id="1060432" wikidata="Q7906939" url="?curid=1060432" title="BET Soul">
<text>BET Soul (formerly VH1 Soul) is an American pay television network that first launched on August 1, 1998, and is currently owned by Paramount Global&#x27;s BET Media Group. The channel showcases Caribbean, African, R&amp;B, funk, soul, neo soul, hip hop, jazz and Motown music in various decades from the 1970s to the 2020s.

Soul was originally a commercial-free service, along with sister channel VH1 Smooth, and part of the &quot;MTV Digital Suite&quot; of digital cable channels (which was sold only to cable providers to give them an advantage over satellite services). The first video shown on the channel was &quot;Boogie Wonderland&quot; by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. 

On December 28, 2015 (few months after MTV Jams&#x27; rebrand as &quot;BET Jams&quot;), management of the channel was moved to BET Networks. It was subsequently rebranded as BET Soul that same day, and became a sister channel to BET (the network itself removing music videos after the ending of &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot; last year). The move would be part of a series of programming and management shifts within then-parent company Viacom in the coming years. In 2019, the legacy assets of Viacom and CBS Corporation would be reunited in a merger between the two companies that led to the formation of ViacomCBS, later to be rebranded as Paramount Global. 

On November 9, 2022, oversight of VH1 would move to the later-renamed BET Media Group. The move reunited two networks, while also splitting them from MTV and its other formerly-branded sibling channels (VH1 Classic and VH1 Country).

The complex includes natural forest, streets, qanats, galleries, mansions/palaces and museums.

==History==
The complex was initially built and inhabited in the 19th century by the Qajar shahs. After extensive expansions, Reza Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty resided there from the 1920s until his exile in 1941. His son, Mohammad Reza Shah, moved there in the 1970s. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter stayed in the palace during a visit to Iran to guarantee U.S. support for the regime. After the 1979 Revolution, the complex became a public museum.

==Present use==
Large parts of the complex are museums, which are accessible to visitors. Other parts are currently used by the Office of the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The complex is operated by the Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran.

== Palace of the King&#x27;s Mother ==
During the Pahlavi era, this palace was the place of the last years of Reza Shah&#x27;s life before his exile to Mauritius. It was also the place of residence of the king&#x27;s mother (Taj al-Muluk) until the time of the 1979 Revolution. 

This palace is currently in the possession of the Presidential Institution of Iran and is reserved for special guests of the Government of Iran; and for this reason it is also famous as &quot;The Republic Building&quot;. This palace is also currently inaccessible to the public.

== The Green Palace ==
The Green Museum Palace has been called &quot;the most beautiful palace in Iran&quot;. This palace is important due to its historical and architectural importance. It dates back to the Qajar period and has two styles of Iranian architecture. They called this palace &quot;The Stone Palace&quot; during the reign of Reza Khan and &quot;The Shahvand palace&quot; during the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi; later, it was called &quot;The Green Palace&quot; because of its green façade.

== The Mellat Museum ==
The Palace of the Nation Museum with an area of 7,000 square meters is the largest palace in Sa&#x27;dabad complex. 

Until after the 1979 revolution and the transfer of the complex to the Cultural Heritage Organization, it was renamed &quot;The Palace of the Nation Museum&quot; (Mellat museum in Persian). The construction of the Palace, began in the late Pahlavi period.

<doc id="1060436" wikidata="Q1464062" url="?curid=1060436" title="Václav Vojta">
<text>Václav Vojta (12 July 1917 – 12 September 2000) was a renowned Czech medical doctor who specialized in the treatment of children with cerebral palsy and developmental disorders. He discovered the principle of reflex locomotion, which is used to treat various physical and neuromuscular disorders through the stimulation of the human sensomotoric system&#x27;s reflex points. Originally used in the treatment of spastic children, the technique is now used on babies and adults.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Vojta began his studies in Prague in 1937, but due to the Nazi occupation, he was forced to postpone them, eventually earning his doctoral degree 10 years later, in 1947. He pursued training in pediatric neurology, working in the clinic at Charles University in Prague, and in 1956, he became head of the Department of Pediatric Neurology at the 4th Neurological Clinic of the Medical Faculty of Charles University in Prague. Dr. Vojta is most noted for his work in developmental kinesiology and his discovery of reflex locomotion therapy, which became broadly known as the Vojta Method.

===Exile in Germany===
In 1968, Soviet troops invaded Czechoslovakia, disrupting Vojta’s work and posing a threat to his professional future. Vojta, along with his wife and three small children, sought refuge in Germany. There, Vojta began work as a research fellow at the Orthopedic Clinic of the University of Cologne, pursuing his work in developmental kinesiological studies, and organizing courses in diagnostics and physical therapy. In 1975, Dr. Vojta relocated to Munich, taking a position at the Munich Children’s Centre, where he became head of the rehabilitation department.

In 1989, after the fall of the communist regime, Vojta returned to his native Czechoslovakia to receive tenure as Professor of Pediatric Neurology and Rehabilitation from Charles University in Prague, an honor denied him as a “politically unreliable person” under the Soviet regime. He was able to teach there once again, and continued to do so until his retirement in 1995. After his retirement, Vojta continued to lecture and teach around the world until his death in 2000.

==Career==

===The Vojta Method===
Vojta’s research was focused on reflex locomotion therapy, particularly in the treatment of children exhibiting developmental delays. He discovered the basis of reflex locomotion while searching for treatment therapies for children with cerebral palsy and spastic paralysis. He discovered that muscle groups that the children could not activate themselves can be activated by applying pressure to specific zones on a patient’s body. Repeated activation resulted in improved gait, better posture and improved speech in children with cerebral palsy.

Professor Vojta recognized that many of the movement complexes he found could be traced to common subjective global patterns of movement that mark developmental milestones in healthy children. Although the emphasis of Vojta’s work was initially directed to pediatrics, he very soon recognized that the treatment could also be applied to neurological problems in adult patients. However, Vojta Therapy is most effective in patients under the age of six months, an age when early developmental changes are most profound.

Vojta therapists use a combination of 10 different zones on a patient&#x27;s body, applying light pressure on a specific area and resistance to the current movement, causing the patient&#x27;s body to involuntarily perform certain reflexive movement patterns. Repeated stimulation appears to make previously blocked neurological connections between the patient&#x27;s spinal cord and brain. The patient is eventually able to perform similar movements without any external stimulation. Vojta Therapy has been used to treat cerebral palsy, peripheral paralysis of the arms and legs, hip dysplasia, and problems in breathing, swallowing and chewing.

In recent years, the principles underlying Vojta&#x27;s method have been adapted to &quot;Dynamic Neuromuscular Stimulation&quot; or DNS, a modern iteration of Vojta therapy. DNS therapy has been successfully used to rehabilitate athletic injury and enhance performance, leading to a reduction in injury, decreased recovery time, and increased performance markers. When an adult athlete or patient is injured, they sometimes revert to an early pattern of locomotion similar to that of a young infant, before proper control was established. For example, a patient with a shoulder impingement may internally rotate and flex their arm in a way similar to a two-month-old child who has not yet developed external rotation and extension. In this case, DNS places an adult patient in a developmental position to re-teach proper control of the shoulder joint.

While Vojta Therapy has been recognized for decades as a viable treatment method throughout Europe and Asia, it has only recently made inroads in the United States, particularly among physical therapists. 
==Published works and training==
Vojta published over 100 scientific works and two textbooks, &quot;Cerebral Movement Disturbances in Infancy&quot; and &quot;The Vojta Principle&quot;, written with Anne Peters. Both have appeared in several editions and been translated into several languages. His works have inspired further research and additional scientific works worldwide.

In 1984, Vojta and his German colleagues formed the &quot;Vojta Society&quot;, dedicated to promoting and disseminating the principles of reflex locomotion in diagnostics and therapy, with the goal of training physiotherapists and physicians in the Vojta method. In 1998, the organization was renamed the International Vojta Society, over which Professor Vojta presided until his death. The non-profit society, with its headquarters in Munich, runs annual qualification seminars in Germany for health care professionals. Training around 150 doctors and physiotherapists a year, the qualification seminars focus on treatment of new-born babies, children and adults. Before his death, Professor Vojta traveled extensively, conducting seminars and training sessions worldwide.
==Awards and recognitions==

Vojta received recognition in the form of awards and honors for his work throughout his career. In 1974 he was awarded the Heinrich Heine Prize, the highest award of the German Society for Orthopedics. In 1979 he received the &quot;Growing with Each Other&quot; Medal from the German association &quot;Aktion Sonnenschein&quot; for his work with disabled children. In 1983, he won the Ernst von Bergmann Prize for training in medicine from the German Medical Association. In 1990, Vojta was awarded the von Pfaundler Medal for training in pediatrics from the Professional Association of Pediatricians. In October 2000, Vojta was posthumously awarded the Czech Order of Merit by Vaclav Havel, the President of the Czech Republic.

<text>Harry Bache Smith (December 28, 1860 – January 1, 1936) was a writer, lyricist and composer. The most prolific of all American stage writers, he is said to have written over 300 librettos and more than 6000 lyrics. Some of his best-known works were librettos for the composers Victor Herbert and Reginald De Koven. He also wrote the book or lyrics for several versions of the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;. 

Smith was born in Buffalo, New York to Josiah Bailey Smith (born 1837) and Elizabeth Bach (born 1838). According to his autobiography &quot;First Nights and First Editions&quot; (Boston: Little, Brown, 1931), Smith&#x27;s actual name at birth was Henry Bach Smith. He married twice. His first wife was Lena Reed (born August 21, 1868), whom he married on October 12, 1887 in Chicago, Illinois. They had a son named Sydney Reed Smith (born July 15, 1892). Smith&#x27;s second wife was the actress Irene Bentley (c. 1870 – June 3, 1940). They married on November 23, 1906 in Boston, Massachusetts, after she had been divorced on June 12, 1906 by her first husband James Thomas Sothoron, Jr. (1867–1913). Bentley retired from the stage in 1910 and died at Allenhurst, New Jersey. She is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, NY. While on a brief holiday in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1936, Smith died of a heart attack in his room at the Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel.

Smith worked on many of the famous musical theatre productions of his time. His younger brother Robert Bache Smith (June 4, 1875 – November 6, 1951) was also a successful lyricist.

Harry Smith&#x27;s archive is largely held at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.

==Selected productions==
Unless otherwise specified below, Smith wrote the libretto (book and lyrics) for the work, and the date given is the date of the original production. In addition to the below, in 1980, some of Smith&#x27;s songs were featured in the Broadway revue &quot;Tintypes&quot;.

<doc id="1060444" wikidata="Q76414" url="?curid=1060444" title="Ludwig Bemelmans">
<text>Ludwig Bemelmans (April 27, 1898 – October 1, 1962) was an Austrian and American writer and illustrator of children&#x27;s books and adult novels. He is known best for the &quot;Madeline&quot; picture books. Six were published, the first in 1939.

==Early life==
Bemelmans was born to the Belgian painter Lambert Bemelmans and the German Frances Fischer in Meran, Austria-Hungary (now Italy). His father owned a hotel. He grew up in Gmunden on the Traunsee in Upper Austria. His first language was French and his second German.

In 1904, his father left his wife and Ludwig&#x27;s governess, both of whom were pregnant with his children, for another woman, after which his mother took Ludwig and his brother to her native city of Regensburg, Germany. Bemelmans had difficulty in school, as he hated the German style of discipline. He was apprenticed to his uncle Hans Bemelmans at a hotel in Austria. In a 1941 &quot;New York Times&quot; interview with Robert van Gelder, he related that while an apprentice, he was regularly beaten and whipped by the headwaiter. According to Bemelmans, he finally warned the headwaiter that if he was whipped again he would retaliate with a gun. The headwaiter ignored his warning, whipped him, and Bemelmans reportedly shot and seriously wounded him in retaliation. Given the choice between reform school and emigration to the United States, he chose the latter. It is likely this was one of Bemelman&#x27;s famous yarns, since in John Bemelmans Marciano&#x27;s biography of his grandfather, he relates a simpler story: recognizing that Ludwig was an incorrigible boy, his uncle offered him the choice of going to America (where his father now lived), or going to reform school.

==In the United States==
He spent the next several years working at hotels and restaurants in the US. In 1917, he joined the U.S. Army, but was not sent to Europe because of his German origins. He did become an officer, and was promoted to Second Lieutenant. He writes of his experiences in the Army in the book, &quot;My War With the United States&quot;. In 1918, he became a US citizen.

In the 1920s, Bemelmans tried to become an artist and painter while working at hotels, but had substantial difficulties. In 1926, he quit his job at the Ritz-Carlton in New York to become a full-time cartoonist. His cartoon series &quot;The Thrilling Adventures of the Count Bric a Brac&quot; was dropped from the &quot;New York World&quot; after six months. He associated with Ervine Metzl, a commercial artist and illustrator who is variously described as Bemelmans&#x27;s friend, agent, and ghost artist.

==Writing career==

In the early 1930s Bemelmans met May Massee, the children&#x27;s book editor at Viking Press, who became a sort of partner. He began to publish children&#x27;s books, beginning with &quot;Hansi&quot; in 1934. He published the first &quot;Madeline&quot; book in 1939; after being rejected by Viking, it was published by Simon &amp; Schuster. The book was a great success. Bemelmans did not write a second Madeline book until 1953, when he published &quot;Madeline’s Rescue&quot;. Four more books in the series were subsequently published while he was alive, and one more was published posthumously in 1999.

Up until the early 1950s, the artistic media he worked in were pen and ink, water color, and gouache. As he describes in his autobiographical &quot;My Life in Art&quot;, he had avoided oil painting because it did not permit him to produce artistic pieces quickly. But at this point in his life, he wanted to master the richness of oil painting. To this end, he set out to buy a property in Paris that would serve as a serious, full-blown art studio. In 1953, he fell in love with a small bistro in Paris, in the &quot;Île de la Cité&quot;, and bought it, intending to convert it into a studio. He painted murals therein, but the project was a disaster owing to French bureaucracy, and after two years of frustration and disappointment, he unloaded it by selling it to Michel Valette, who converted it into a notable cabaret.

Bemelmans also wrote a number of adult books, including travel, humorous works, and novels, as well as movie scripts. The latter included &quot;Yolanda and the Thief&quot;. While spending time in Hollywood, he became a close friend of interior decorator Elsie de Wolfe, Lady Mendl.

A mural on the walls of the Carlyle Hotel&#x27;s Bemelmans Bar in New York City, &quot;Central Park&quot;, is his only artwork on display to the public. He painted the children&#x27;s dining room on Aristotle Onassis&#x27;s yacht &quot;Christina&quot; (now the &quot;Christina O&quot;), for Christina Onassis, the young daughter of the magnate.

A collection of his short writings was published in 2004 as &quot;When you lunch with the Emperor&quot; mainly extracted from previous works which included &quot;My War with the United States&quot; (1937), &quot;Life Class&quot; (1938), &quot;Small Beer&quot; (1939), &quot;Hotel Splendide&quot; (1941), &quot;I Love You, I Love You, I Love You&quot; (1942), and “Bemelman’s Italian Holiday” (1961) a collection of travel essays that originally appeared in the magazine, Holiday (magazine), to which Bemelman had been a consistent contributor. 

===Madeline series===
Each Madeline story begins: &quot;In an old house in Paris, that was covered with vines, lived twelve little girls in two straight lines... the smallest one was Madeline.&quot; The girls are cared for by Miss Clavel. 

Other characters include Pepito, son of the Spanish ambassador, who lives next door; Lord Cucuface, owner of the house; and Genevieve, a dog who rescues Madeline from drowning in the second book. Bemelmans published six Madeline stories in his lifetime, five as picture books and one in a magazine. A seventh was discovered after his death and published posthumously:

#&quot;Madeline&quot;, 1939: in which Madeline must have her appendix removed.
#&quot;Madeline&#x27;s Rescue&quot;, 1953: in which Madeline is rescued from drowning by a dog (later named Genevieve). Winner of the Caldecott Medal for U.S. picture book illustration.
#&quot;Madeline and the Bad Hat&quot;, 1956: in which the &quot;bad hat&quot; is Pepito, the Spanish ambassador&#x27;s son, whose cruel antics outrage Madeline.
#&quot;Madeline and the Gypsies&quot;, 1959: in which Madeline and Pepito have an adventure at a circus.
#&quot;Madeline in London&quot;, 1961: in which Pepito moves to London, and Madeline and the girls go to visit him.
#&quot;Madeline&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, 1985: in which everyone in the house catches cold, except Madeline. (First published in &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; in 1956).
#&quot;Madeline in America and Other Holiday Tales&quot;, 1999: in which Madeline inherits a fortune from her American great-grandfather. The book also reveals Madeline&#x27;s full name, Madeline Fogg.

===Adaptations===
*The first book, &quot;Madeline&quot;, was adapted as an Academy Award-nominated 1952 short animated cartoon directed by Robert Cannon for UPA and released by Columbia Pictures, also titled &quot;Madeline&quot;.
*Between 1988 and 2002, an animated &quot;Madeline&quot; series was made for television (plus one direct-to-video film &quot;&quot;), with the narration in rhyming style read by Christopher Plummer.
* A live-action &quot;Madeline&quot; film based on several of the books appeared in 1998, directed by Daisy von Scherler Mayer and starring Hatty Jones as Madeline, Frances McDormand as Miss Clavel, and Nigel Hawthorne as Lord Covington.
* Bemelmans&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Madeline&quot;, was briefly satirized on a February 2020 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; by comedian and drag performer Ru Paul.

==&quot;Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep&quot;==
Bemelman&#x27;s novel &quot;Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep&quot; (1943) was adapted by Elaine Ryan for the stage in 1949. The production was produced and directed by Hume Cronyn and combined professional actors with drama students at Stanford University. Performed at Stanford&#x27;s Memorial Theatre during July 1949, the production starred Jessica Tandy and Akim Tamiroff, with Jeanne Bates, Feodor Chaliapin, Milton Parsons, and Roberta Haynes as the supporting professionals.

Cronyn sold the rights for his staging of the play to new producers Nancy Stern and George Nichols III, who after a tryout in Philadelphia, took it to Broadway. The production opened at the Broadhurst Theatre on March 2, 1950. It starred Fredric March as the General and his wife Florence Eldridge as Miss Graves, with Jacqueline Dalya, Milton Parsons, Henry Lascoe, Rick Jason, Booth Colman, Stefan Schnabel, Charles Chaplin Jr., and many others. Bemelmans was involved with the design of the production and present for the tryouts and Broadway performances.

As with many of the author&#x27;s novels, &quot;Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep&quot; consists of a great many character sketches, location changes, and improbable events. Critic John Chapman identified this writing style as the ultimate problem with the stage production:
If anybody is to be reprimanded in this dispatch, it probably should be Mr. Bemelmans for being such a loose and dizzy writer--- but this would be impolite, impertinent and ungrateful, for this gay, raffish author of &quot;Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep&quot; wrote a story which is a gem of impish, sophisticated and sardonic humor. When Miss Ryan set out to translate his verbal whimseys into the more solid statements of the stage, she handed herself a whale of a job.

Reviewer Louis Scheaffer held the same opinion about the difficulty in adapting Bemelmans for the stage, recognizing that the author&#x27;s characters are nothing like what theatregoers are used to, and the course of events won&#x27;t fit neatly into the usual genres. But he also held a high opinion of Bemelmans writing:
A curious, beguiling combination of innocence and sophistication, of sweet humor and shrewd, worldly insight, Bemelmans has a sunny tolerance for his fellow creature&#x27;s private or personal failings that illuminates all of his writings and goes far beyond the little gray virtues generally suggested by the word &quot;tolerance&quot;.

Despite the appreciation for Bemelmans writing by New York critics, &quot;Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep&quot; lasted for only 44 performances, closing on April 8, 1950.

==Personal life==
Bemelmans is said to have met his future wife, Madeleine &quot;Mimi&quot; Freund, as a model in Metzl&#x27;s studio. They had one daughter; their grandson is John Bemelmans Marciano.

Bemelmans died in New York of pancreatic cancer, aged 64 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>Lee Shau-kee GBM (; born 7 March 1928) is a Hong Kong business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. He is a real estate tycoon and majority owner of Henderson Land Development, a property conglomerate with interests in property, hotels, restaurants and internet services. In 2019, aged 91, Lee stepped down as chairman and managing director of the company, in favour of two of his sons, Peter and Martin Lee. He retains a role as an executive director.

His personal wealth is estimated to be US$27.8 billion as of July 2024, making him the second wealthiest man in Hong Kong (behind Li Ka-shing), and the 63rd richest in the world. Before the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, he was the fourth-richest person in world.

In 2007, he donated HK$500 million to the University of Hong Kong and HK$400 million to the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

In 2015, Lee donated a site in Yuen Long to charity organisation Po Leung Kuk for it to develop Hong Kong&#x27;s biggest youth hostel. Lee announced that the units would be leased to young people between the ages of 18 and 30 at half the market rate.

Other than public philanthropy, Lee has given his Henderson Land staff cash gifts to celebrate the birth of four of his grandchildren, in amounts totalling HK$60 million over a nine-year period.

In May 2018, Lee donated HK$100 million to Hang Seng Management College supporting its strategic development.

<text>Reflex locomotion, usually referred to as the Vojta method, is a technique for the treatment of physical and mental impairment in humans. It was discovered by Václav Vojta.

Based on studies of treatments for spastic children for muscular disorders in the 1950s, a number of reflex points were identified which can be used to stimulate the human body to crawl and turn. By applying pressure to the appropriate reflex points the major muscle groups in the body are activated, breathing becomes regulated and mental activity increases.

The Vojta method is classified as alternative medicine.

<text>The Constitution of Finland ( or ) is the supreme source of national law of Finland. It defines the basis, structures and organisation of government, the relationship between the different constitutional organs, and lays out the fundamental rights of Finnish citizens, and individuals in general. The original Constitution Act was enacted in 1919, soon after Finland declared its independence in 1917. The current draft of the Constitution came into force on 1 March 2000.

== Historical background and reform ==

Finland&#x27;s current constitutional provisions are enshrined in a single statute: the Constitution of Finland (731/1999).

Before the enshrinement, the Finnish constitutional provisions were divided between four separate statutes, which all had a constitutional status; the Constitution Act of 1919, also known in English as the Instrument of Government, (; ), the Parliament Act of 1928 (; ), the Ministerial Responsibility Act of 1922 (, short title &quot;ministerivastuulaki&quot;; ) and the Act on the High Court of Impeachment of 1922 (; ). All these statutes were merged into a single constitution and repealed with the passage thereof.

The fundamental principles of the Constitution Act of 1919 and the Parliament Act of 1906, amended in 1928, remained unchanged during the first fifty years of Finnish independence, as there was little pressure or need for any amendments to the Constitution Act. However, this did not prevent the Constitution from adapting to the changing needs of the day. The flexibility of the Finnish Constitution is due to the use of &quot;exceptive laws&quot;, a distinctive feature of the Finnish system: instead of amending or changing the Constitution, an act may be passed as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; exception to it. Such an exceptive law does not become part of the Constitution and it may be repealed like an ordinary act. Exceptive laws were formerly much used, even to the point of threatening to undermine respect for Constitutional provisions. Today, their use is limited.

The first major constitutional reform came in 1983, with the re-writing of many important provisions governing parliamentary procedure, mostly in the Parliament Act. However, the most extensive and important reforms came in 1987, when provisions on the holding of consultative referendums were added to the Constitution. The indirect form of electing the President of the Republic via an Electoral College was replaced by a system which combined the Electoral College with direct election, and the provisions governing the postponement of ordinary legislation were amended by shortening the period for which a bill could be postponed.

In 1991, the direct popular election of the President was introduced, with provision for a second ballot where necessary. The new system was used for the first time in 1994. The President&#x27;s term of office was also limited to two consecutive terms of six years, and the President&#x27;s powers were limited to only dissolving Parliament on receipt of a reasoned request from the Prime Minister and having first consulted the Speaker and the party groups in Parliament. The 1991 reform also amended the provisions in the Constitution Act and the Parliament Act relating to State finances.

The extensive reform of Basic Rights in Chapter II of the Constitution Act came into force in August 1995, and the remaining powers of a one third minority to postpone ordinary legislation to the next Parliament were abolished, marking the final transition to majority parliamentarism in respect to ordinary legislation. 

In the 1990s, the need to integrate and update the constitutional legislation was seen as urgent. For instance, while in most other European countries constitutional provisions are all contained within a single constitutional act, in Finland, they were fragmented and contained across several acts.

The process of constitutional reform began in the late 1990s, after Finland&#x27;s accession to the European Union, partly because of the arguments which had emerged between the Parliament and the President when arrangements were being made for decision-making in European affairs, such as whether the President should participate in the meetings of the European Council together with the Prime Minister.

In 1995, a working group of experts, called the Constitution 2000 Working Group, was appointed to examine the need to consolidate and update the constitutional legislation. The Working Group proposed that all constitutional provisions be brought together into a single statute and concluded that the most important questions of constitutional law to be addressed in the reform were the reduction of the scope of constitutional regulation, the development of relations between the highest organs of government, the clarification of questions of power and responsibility in international affairs, and constitutional recognition of European Union membership. The Working Group also drew up a proposal for the structure of the new Constitution.

After the Working Group had delivered its report, in 1996 the Government appointed the &quot;Constitution 2000 Commission&quot; to draft a proposal for a new, integrated Constitution to come into force on 1 March 2000. The Commission was instructed to draft its proposal for a new Constitution to replace the four existing constitutional laws in the form of a Government bill. The Commission completed its work on 17 June 1997, and during 1998, the bill was considered by the Constitutional Law Committee, which finally produced its unanimous report on the bill in January 1999. On 12 February, Parliament gave its approval for the Committee&#x27;s proposal for the new Constitution to be left in abeyance until after the parliamentary elections. The new Parliament elected in March 1999 approved the new Constitution in June that year and it was ratified by the President of the Republic.

The Constitution has since been amended a number of times, notably in 2011 to allow bills to be introduced in Parliament by popular petition and in 2017 to expand the access of police and intelligence services to private communications.

== Main provisions ==
=== Structure ===

The official text of the constitution consists of 131 Sections, divided into 13 Chapters, as follows:

# Fundamental provisions 
# Basic rights and liberties
# Parliament and the Representatives
# Parliamentary activity
# The President of the Republic and the Government
# Legislation
# State finances
# International relations
# Administration of justice
# Supervision of legality
# Administration and self-government
# National defence
# Final provisions

=== Fundamental provisions and basic rights ===
The opening chapter on fundamental provisions continues the affirmation of Finland&#x27;s status as a sovereign Republic, the inviolability of human dignity and the rights of the individual, and the sovereignty of the Finnish people. It also affirms the principle of representative democracy and the position of Parliament as the highest organ of government, the separation of powers, the independence of the courts, and the principle of parliamentary government. The provisions for constitutional rights closely mirror the European convention on human rights, including the educational, social and economic rights in addition to political liberties. The international human rights obligations of Finland are set as the highest legal norm of the law, even above the constitution.

=== Provisions on the Constitutional Organs ===

The Constitution establishes a government under a parliamentary system. It provides for a directly elected President of the Republic, a Government comprising the Prime Minister and the Ministers who form the Government (Chapter 5) the Parliament of Finland (Chapter 3). It also establishes an independent judiciary and two judicial systems: one general, and the other administrative.

==== Parliament ====
One of the main goals of the constitutional reform process was to move Finland away from a semi-presidential system and further in the direction of a parliamentary system of government. Accordingly, the new Constitution strengthens the position of Parliament as the highest organ of government and makes it easier for the legislature to carry out its work — this despite the fact that the new Constitution&#x27;s provisions on the organization and procedures of Parliament contain no fundamental changes in terms of content, and the legal provisions on Parliament and Representatives remain largely unchanged. Importantly, under the new Constitution, the Parliament elects and appoints a new Prime Minister and the President appoints the other ministers on the advice of the Prime Minister; under the old system, appointing the entire cabinet was a power vested in the President. While the decision to dissolve the Parliament and call an unscheduled election is still made by the President as head of state, the President may no longer do so at their own discretion but instead only on the advice of the Prime Minister.

Under the Parliament Act, Parliament has traditionally been entitled to receive from the Government and the relevant ministries whatever information it needs to carry out its functions, while the parliamentary committees have enjoyed a similar right to be provided with information and reports on matters within their purview. The new Constitution extends Parliament&#x27;s right to be informed by giving individual Members of Parliament the right to receive information from authorities which they need to carry out their functions, provided the information concerned is not classed as secret and is not related to the preparation of the Government&#x27;s budget proposal.

The new Constitution rationalizes and tightens up Parliament&#x27;s legislative procedures in respect of the readings of a bill in plenary session following preparation in committee, reducing the previous three readings to two.

Parliamentary supervision of the Government and of the overall administrative machinery of government is to be enhanced by transferring the National Audit Office, which monitors management of the public finances and compliance with the Government budget, from its previous position under the Ministry of Finance to become an independent office working in conjunction with Parliament.

A new Procedure of Parliament, which supplements the provisions on Parliament contained in the Constitution, came into force at the same time as the new Constitution on 1 March 2000.

==== The President of the Republic and the Government ====
The main changes in the new Constitution relate to the constitutional regulation of decision-making by the President of the Republic and the formation of the Government. Regulation of presidential decision-making procedures are specified more precisely, while the Government, responsible to Parliament and dependent on the confidence of Parliament, is given a greater role in presidential decision-making. The most notable change was the transfer of the final decision on the introduction and withdrawal of Government bills from the President of the Republic to the Government, this including bills in the area of foreign affairs.

In relation to the formation of the Government, the provisions of the new Constitution transfer the appointment of the Prime Minister from the President to Parliament. The new Constitution thus marked the end of the President&#x27;s leading role in the formation of the Government. The President now only takes a prominent role when the parliamentary groups are unable to reach agreement on a suitable basis and programme for the Government, and on a suitable candidate for Prime Minister.

=== Delegation ===
§ 80 provides that an issue can be governed by a Decree only if this re-delegation is explicitly allowed in an Act. However, the principles governing the rights and obligations of private individuals and the other matters that under the Constitution are of a legislative nature shall be governed by Acts. § 80, in essence, sets up the boundaries on how the Parliament may give up its legislative power.

The Constitution, indeed, delegates several issues to be governed by ordinary Acts. These laws are not considered constitutional laws, although they concern constitutional rights. An example is the universal obligation to participate in national defence which is provided in § 127 in two sentences, both of which delegate to regular legislation: &quot;Every Finnish citizen is obligated to participate or assist in national defence, as provided by an Act. Provisions on the right to exemption, on grounds of conscience, from participation in military national defence are laid down by an Act.&quot;

== Criticisms ==
The constitutional system in Finland has been criticized for missing any &quot;de facto&quot; mechanism of independent constitutional review, as well as failing to adequately guarantee separation of powers. The constitutionality of laws is not determined by the judiciary, but it is, instead, reviewed by the Parliament&#x27;s own Constitutional Law Committee that consists of MPs. This structure is, however, not unusual among democratic nations. The Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland are other such countries where constitutional review is performed by the legislature itself or a committee within it.

The current Finnish Constitution expressly (section 106) directs the courts to give precedence to the provisions of the Constitution if they are in an evident conflict with provisions of ordinary laws in some particular case, but the courts may not strike down Acts or pronounce on their constitutionality. The old constitutional acts also directed the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court to request, if needed, the explication or amendment of an Act or a Decree, but this provision has been repealed and the responsibility for maintaining the constitutionality of the laws now rests completely with the Parliament.

<text>Rimavská Sobota (; , ) is a town in southern Slovakia, in the Banská Bystrica Region, on the Rimava river. It has approximately 24,000 inhabitants. The town is a historical capital of Gömör és Kishont County (from 1850 to 1922).

==Geography==
It is located around east of the national capital Bratislava, around southeast of Banská Bystrica and west of Košice. The town, along with the district lies in the Rimava river valley in the Slovenské rudohorie mountains, in the Southern Slovak Basin. There are two protected areas close to the town in the district, Cerová vrchovina to the south and Muránska planina National Park to the north.

The town is composed of 11 parts/boroughs: Bakta, Dúžava, Kurinec, Mojín, Nižná Pokoradz, Rimavská Sobota, Sabová, Sobôtka, Včelinec, Vinice and Vyšná Pokoradz.

==History==
The first traces of settlement in the town&#x27;s territory come from the Neolithic. Other archaeological discoveries are dated to the middle and late Bronze Age and Iron Age. Several tribes have passed through the area, including Celts, Germanic tribes and several others during the Migration Period. The Slavs settled here most likely in the 7th and 8th centuries. The old Hungarian tribes came at the beginning of the 10th century and settled in the 11th century. A medieval town was probably founded in the second half of the 11th century and became a market town.

The first written record about Rimavská Sobota was in 1268 as &quot;Rymoa Zumbota&quot; and belonged to the Archbishop of Kalocsa, who owned the land from 1150 to around 1340. In 1334 the ownership changed to Thomas Szécsényi from Transylvania. The town received a privilege charted in 1335 on the basis of the Buda municipal law. In the first half of the 15th century, it was a small town, and economic development had begun, when the first guilds were established. However, it was interrupted by Turkish occupation, first in 1553–1593 and then in 1596–1686. It was centre of Filek sanjak firstly in Budin Eyalet, latterly Eğri Eyalet. The town was growing again in the 18th century, with the guilds of tanners, weavers, shoe-makers and others being set up. It became a free privileged town in the 1790s. From 1850 to 1922 it was the capital of the Gömör-Kishont county. Industry started to develop in the 20th century, with a cannery being established in 1902.

After the break-up of Austria-Hungary, the town was occupied by the Czechoslovak Legions in January 1919. However, the army of the Hungarian Soviet Republic came to the town in May 1919, but control reverted to Czechoslovakia in July 1919. After the First Vienna Award in 1938, the town belonged to Hungary to the end of 1944. During the Socialist Czechoslovakia, food industry developed here; for example, a sugar factory was established in 1966 and a meat processing plant in 1977.

=== Archaeology ===
In 2024, archaeologists unearthed a medieval settlement spanning from the 11th to the 13th centuries coexisting with remnants of Roman furnaces. The latter yielded a collection of over 150 artifacts.

==Economy==

The town&#x27;s main trade is agriculture and food processing. Agricultural production is aimed at animal production: beef-raising, sheep farming, and farming of permanent grass fields, meadows and pasture lands. Rimavská&#x27;s hollow basin is an important agricultural area, where almost all crops can be grown, including the more thermophilic ones, such as sugar beet, wheat, rye, vegetable, tobacco, vine, lucerne, and corn. Forest resources are under both state and private administration. The town also has electrotechnical, mechanical, and chemical businesses. All industrial companies were privatized during the Slovak economy transformation.

The most important transport line goes through the southern part of the county. Rimavská Sobota is from Banská Bystrica and from Bratislava. The district is also the site of former Czechoslovakia (now Radio Slovakia International, RSI) shortwave radio antenna tower facility, using a 250 kW transmitter to reach listening audiences as far away as North America. The towers and masts of the station have heights up to 171 metres.

Rimavská Sobota&#x27;s tourist industry is as yet largely undeveloped, due to a lack of infrastructure, although the area possesses natural, historical, and cultural potential.

==Demographics==
In 1910, 90% of the population was Hungarian, Slovaks made up the most significant ethnic minority with 7%. According to the 2001 census, there were 25,088 people living in the town, the majority being Slovaks (59.28%), with a significant minority of Hungarians (35.26%), a small percentage of Roma (3.01%) and others. The religious make-up was: 47.84% Roman Catholics, 25.44% without denomination, 10.33 Protestants and 5.26% not specified.

<text>Władysław Dziewulski (2 September 1878 – 6 February 1962) was a Polish astronomer and mathematician. He spent most his life performing astronomical research, and published over 200 papers.

==Life==
He studied mathematics and astronomy in his native Warsaw. Then in 1902 he went to the University of Göttingen in Germany to complete his education. In 1903, he was named as an assistant at the astronomical observatory in Kraków that belonged to the Jagiellonian University and in 1906, he gained his PhD there. In 1919, he became a professor of the Batory University in Vilna and director of its Astronomical Observatory. He was also the rector of Batory University in 1924–25. Later he moved to Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń. He spent the last part of his life in Toruń.

He focused on the gravitational perturbations of minor planets, movements of stellar groupings, and photographic photometry.

The crater Dziewulski on the Moon, the Wladyslaw Dziewulski Planetarium in Toruń, and the main-belt asteroid are all named in his honor.

<text>An abandoned (or disused) railway station is a building or structure that was constructed to serve as a railway station but has fallen into disuse. There are various circumstances when this may occur – a railway company may fall bankrupt, or the station may be closed due to the failure of economic activity such as insufficient passenger numbers, operational reasons such as the diversion or replacement of the line. In some instances, the railway line may continue in operation while the station is closed. Additionally, stations may sometimes be resited along the route of the line to new premises – examples of this include opening a replacement station nearer to the center of population or building a larger station on a less restricted site to cope with high passenger numbers.

Abandoned train stations play a complex role in urban development. In some cases, they are seen as symbols of urban decay, but in other cases, they become catalysts for regeneration and creative reuse. As cities grow, these abandoned buildings can be incorporated into urban renewal projects, bringing new economic and cultural vitality to the surrounding areas.

Beyond their functional history, abandoned stations are often viewed as tangible links to local history, evoking cultural memory. Their unique architecture and historic atmosphere foster a sense of community identity and encourage local efforts to preserve these landmarks as symbols of collective heritage.

==Reasons for abandonment==
Notable cases where railway stations have fallen into disuse include the Beeching Axe, a 1960s program of mass closures of unprofitable railway lines by the British Government. The London Underground system is also noted for its list of closed stations. During the time of the Berlin Wall, several Berlin U-Bahn stations on West Berlin lines became &quot;ghost stations&quot; &quot;(Geisterbahnhöfe)&quot; because they were on lines which passed through East Berlin territory. According to Stefania Ragozino and Stefania Oppido, &quot;The abandonment of the railways network, stations and tollbooth rails is a widespread phenomenon at national and international level, determined by social, economic and technological developments that have changed the local infrastructure systems.&quot;

Long-term neglect of these structures can lead to environmental issues. Contaminants in old building materials or contaminated soils can pose risks and require remedial action before any reconstruction can be safely undertaken.

Abandoned stations in different regions show remarkable diversity in architectural style and design. This diversity reflects local economic conditions and cultural traditions and provides valuable insights into how building techniques have evolved.

==Dereliction and alternative uses==

Railway stations and lines that fall into disuse may become overgrown. 

In recent years, local governments have increasingly recognized the potential of abandoned stations in urban renewal and heritage protection. They have promoted restoring and renovating these historical buildings by providing public funds and implementing protection policies, providing new opportunities for community development.

Some former railway lines are repurposed as managed nature reserves, trails or other tourist attractions – for example Hellfire Pass, the route of the former &quot;Death Railway&quot; in Thailand. Many former railways are converted into long-distance cycleways, such as large sections of the National Cycle Network in the United Kingdom. 

Many abandoned stations have been transformed into multifunctional public spaces through innovative adaptive reuse projects – from art galleries and community centers to co-working spaces and tourist attractions – that preserve the stations’ historical essence while meeting the needs of contemporary cities.

In rural areas, former railway station buildings are often converted into private residences. Examples include many of the stations on the closed Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway in England. Architecturally and historically notable station buildings may present a problem if they are protected under building preservation laws but fall into disuse. Such buildings are often simply demolished (such as Broad Street railway station in London), or they may be preserved as part of a heritage railway. 

Prior to repurposing, many abandoned stations presented significant safety hazards due to aging structures and outdated designs. In addition, the lack of modern accessibility facilities posed challenges that had to be addressed during the restoration process through comprehensive safety assessments and necessary upgrades.

Advances in digital technology are allowing abandoned stations to be virtually preserved. Through 3D scanning, augmented reality tours, and the creation of digital archives, institutions can fully document these buildings and make their historical significance more accessible to the public.

The enchanting atmosphere of abandoned train stations has long inspired artists, filmmakers, and photographers. Their haunting beauty is often captured in visual art, literature, and film, which adds to the mystique of train stations and further highlights their cultural value.

In many communities, local activists and cultural heritage enthusiasts have organized grassroots movements to preserve abandoned stations. These efforts aim to prevent demolition or inappropriate redevelopment, ensuring that these historic landmarks remain an integral part of the community’s cultural fabric.

Often, to be retained as commercially viable structures within an urban environment, or as part of an urban regeneration project, they may be repurposed for alternative activities. Prominent examples include the ornate Gare d&#x27;Orsay in Paris, which was converted into the Musée d&#x27;Orsay art gallery; the Manchester Central railway station, which was put to new use first as a car park and later refurbished as the Manchester Central Conference Centre; and Broad Street Station in Richmond, Virginia, which now houses the Science Museum of Virginia. The Ottawa Convention Centre is a former station, as are railway museums Memory Junction in Brighton and Railway Museum of Eastern Ontario in Smiths Falls. In Prescott the rail station houses historical society offices; in Lac-Mégantic and Kingston a former station houses a tourism information office. Stations have also been transformed into restaurants or private residences.

==Restoration==
Many abandoned railway stations and lines are now being brought back into operational service, notably in the UK where environmental policy is driving the reversal of some of the Beeching closures of the 1960s. In London the Docklands Light Railway made use of disused railway infrastructure for much of its construction; in Manchester it is proposed to expand the Metrolink light rail system by re-opening abandoned rail lines; and in Scotland, the Scottish Government has brought the Waverley Line partially back into passenger service.

<doc id="1060482" wikidata="Q844790" url="?curid=1060482" title="The Firebird">
<text>The Firebird (; ) is a ballet and orchestral concert work by the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky. It was written for the 1910 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Michel Fokine, who collaborated with Alexandre Benois and others on a scenario based on the Russian fairy tales of the Firebird and the blessing and curse it possesses for its owner. It was first performed at the Opéra de Paris on 25 June 1910 and was an immediate success, catapulting Stravinsky to international fame and leading to future Diaghilev–Stravinsky collaborations including &quot;Petrushka&quot; (1911) and &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; (1913).

&quot;The Firebird&quot; mortal and supernatural elements are distinguished with a system of leitmotifs placed in the harmony dubbed &quot;leit-harmony&quot;. Stravinsky intentionally used many specialist techniques in the orchestra, including &quot;ponticello&quot;, &quot;col legno&quot;, &quot;flautando&quot;, &quot;glissando&quot;, and flutter-tonguing. Set in the evil immortal Koschei&#x27;s castle, the ballet follows Prince Ivan, who battles Koschei with the help of the magical Firebird.

Stravinsky later created three concert suites based on the work: in 1911, ending with the &quot;Infernal Dance&quot;; in 1919, which remains the most popular today; and in 1945, featuring significant reorchestration and structural changes. Other choreographers have staged the work with Fokine&#x27;s original choreography or created entirely new productions using the music, some with new settings or themes. Many recordings of the suites have been made; the first was released in 1928, using the 1911 suite. A film version of the popular Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet production, which revived Fokine&#x27;s original choreography, was produced in 1959.

== History ==
=== Background ===

Igor Stravinsky began studying composition with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in 1902. He completed several works during his time as a student, including his first performed work, Pastorale (1907), and his first published work, the Symphony in E-flat (1907), which the composer categorized Opus 1. In February 1909, a performance of his &quot;Scherzo fantastique&quot; and &quot;Feu d&#x27;artifice&quot; in Saint Petersburg was attended by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev, who was intrigued by the vividness of Stravinsky&#x27;s works.

Diaghilev founded the art magazine &quot;Mir iskusstva&quot; in 1898, but after it ended publication in 1904, he turned towards Paris for artistic opportunities rather than his native Russia. In 1907, Diaghilev presented a five-concert series of Russian music at the Paris Opera; the next year, he staged the Paris premiere of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s version of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;. By 1909, Diaghilev had connected with Michel Fokine, Léon Bakst, and Alexandre Benois, and gained enough money to start his independent ballet company, the Ballets Russes. Diaghilev commissioned Stravinsky to orchestrate music by Chopin for the ballet &quot;Les Sylphides&quot;, and the composer was finished by March 1909.

Fokine was a renowned dancer, receiving first prize in his class upon graduation from the Imperial Theatre School in 1898; he subsequently entered the Mariinsky Ballet as a soloist and was promoted to lead dancer of the company in 1904. Fokine was dissatisfied with the ballet tradition of glamorous appeals to the audience and interruptions from viewers; he felt that dramatic dance should be strictly displayed with no interruption of illusion, and that the music should be closely connected to the theme. His 1907 ballets &quot;The Dying Swan&quot; and &quot;Les Sylphides&quot; were very successful and established Fokine as a competitor to other prominent choreographers. In 1908, Benois, a member of Diaghilev&#x27;s &quot;Mir iskusstva&quot; circle and friend of Fokine&#x27;s, arranged for the dancer to prepare a repertoire for the Ballets Russes&#x27; 1909 season as the company&#x27;s first lead choreographer; the season was very successful, and Diaghilev began organizing plans for the 1910 season soon after.

=== Conception ===
As the Ballets Russes faced financial issues, Diaghilev wanted a new ballet with distinctly Russian music and design, something that had recently become popular with French and other Western audiences (likely due to the glamorous charm of The Five&#x27;s music). Fokine unofficially led a committee of artists to devise the scenario of this new ballet, including himself, Benois, the composer Nikolai Tcherepnin, and the painter Aleksandr Golovin. Benois recalled that Pyotr Petrovich Potyomkin, a poet and ballet enthusiast in Diaghilev&#x27;s circle, proposed the subject of the Firebird to the artists, citing the 1844 poem &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Journey&quot; by Yakov Polonsky that includes the lines:
&lt;poem&gt;
And in my dreams I see myself on a wolf&#x27;s back
Riding along a forest path
To do battle with a sorcerer-tsar
In that land where a princess sits under lock and key,
Pining behind massive walls.
There gardens surround a palace all of glass;
There Firebirds sing by night
And peck at golden fruit.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The committee drew from several books of Russian fairy tales, in particular Alexander Afanasyev&#x27;s collection and Pyotr Pavlovich Yershov&#x27;s &quot;The Little Humpbacked Horse&quot;. The immortal king Koschei and the captive Princess were incorporated from a Muscovite anthology of stories, which also helped determine the Firebird&#x27;s role in the story. Fokine drew on the stark contrast between good and evil in Russian fairy tales while developing the ballet&#x27;s characters. The choreographer blended fantasy and reality to create the scenario, a trope of romanticism found in many of Fokine&#x27;s folkish ballets. Originally, Tcherepnin was to compose the music, as he had previously worked on &quot;Le Pavillon d&#x27;Armide&quot; with Fokine and Benois, but he withdrew from the project. In September1909, Diaghilev asked Anatoly Lyadov to compose the ballet; Lyadov expressed interest in the production, but took too long to meet the 1910 season&#x27;s deadline. After considering Alexander Glazunov and Nikolay Sokolov, Diaghilev asked Stravinsky to compose the score upon encouragement from Tcherepnin and Boris Asafyev.

Stravinsky began work in October or November1909, traveling to the Rimsky-Korsakov household with Andrey Rimsky-Korsakov, the son of Stravinsky&#x27;s teacher and dedicatee of &quot;The Firebird&quot; score. Because Stravinsky began work before Diaghilev officially commissioned him, the composer&#x27;s sketches did not align with the scenario; the full story became known to him when he met with Fokine in December and received the ballet&#x27;s planned structure. Fokine ensured the creation of the ballet was an equal effort between the producers and the composer, working closely with Stravinsky while developing the choreography. While the composer worked, Diaghilev organized private performances of the piano score for the press. The French critic Robert Brussel, a friend of Diaghilev&#x27;s, wrote: &quot;By the end of the first scene, I was conquered: by the last, I was lost in admiration. The manuscript on the music-rest, scored over with fine pencillings, revealed a masterpiece.&quot;

=== Development ===

Despite later lamenting the &quot;descriptive music of a kind I did not want to write&quot;, Stravinsky finished &quot;The Firebird&quot; in about six months, and had it fully orchestrated by mid-May 1910. Stravinsky arrived in Paris around the beginning of June to attend the premiere of his first stage work; it was his first visit to Paris.

Rehearsals began in Ekaterininsky Hall, and Stravinsky attended every rehearsal to help with the music, often explaining the complicated rhythms to the dancers. Tamara Karsavina, who originated the titular Firebird role, later recalled, &quot;Often he came early to the theatre before a rehearsal began in order to play for me over and over again some particularly difficult passage.&quot; Stravinsky also worked closely with Gabriel Pierné, who conducted the premiere with the Colonne Orchestra, to &quot;explain the music... [but the musicians] found it no less bewildering than did the dancers&quot;. Two dress rehearsals were held to accommodate the dancers, many of whom missed their entrances due to the unexpected changes in the music, &quot;which sounded quite different when played by the orchestra from what it had sounded like when played on a piano&quot;.

When the company arrived in Paris, the ballet was not finished, causing Fokine to extend rehearsals; he petitioned Diaghilev to postpone the premiere, but the impresario declined, fearing public disappointment. The Ballets Russes season began on 4 June 1910 with stagings of Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Carnaval&quot;, Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Scheherazade&quot;, and short productions from the previous season.

Fokine&#x27;s style of dance made great use of interpretive movement; he used ideas of expressiveness, naturalism, vitality, and stylistic consistency. The choreographer employed many forms of dance in &quot;The Firebird&quot;. The titular Firebird danced classically, Koschei and his subjects in a more violent and grotesque manner, and the Princesses in a looser, gentler way. The role of the Firebird differed from that of traditional ballerinas; female dancers often danced princesses, swans, and lovers, but the Firebird was a mysterious and abstract idea, represented as a magical force rather than a person. Her choreography featured exaggerated classical steps, with deep bending at the waist; Fokine wanted her to be &quot;powerful, hard to manage, and rebellious&quot; rather than graceful. This new kind of role for a female character was revolutionary for the ballet scene.

=== Premiere and reception ===

Excitement for the premiere was great, particularly in Diaghilev&#x27;s circle of &quot;Mir iskusstva&quot; collaborators. The sculptor , who helped develop the scenario, wrote to Golovin on 16 June, &quot;I&#x27;m staying till Sunday; I must see &quot;The Firebird&quot;. I have seen your dazzling drawings and costumes. I like Stravinsky&#x27;s music in the orchestra and the dances tremendously. I think the whole thing together with your sets will look spectacular. Serov has also put off his departure because of this ballet&quot;. Diaghilev remarked of Stravinsky during rehearsals, &quot;Mark him well, he is a man on the eve of celebrity&quot;.

&quot;The Firebird&quot; premiered at the Palais Garnier on 25 June 1910, and was very well-received. The cast starred Karsavina as the Firebird, Fokine as Prince Ivan, as the youngest princess, and Alexis Bulgakov as Koschei. Karsavina later told an interviewer, &quot;With every performance, success went &quot;crescendo&quot;&quot;. Critics praised the ballet for the unity of the decor, choreography, and music. &quot;The old-gold vermiculation of the fantastic back-cloth seems to have been invented to a formula identical with that of the shimmering web of the orchestra&quot;, wrote Henri Ghéon in &quot;Nouvelle revue française&quot;; he called the ballet &quot;the most exquisite marvel of equilibrium&quot; and added that Stravinsky was a &quot;delicious musician&quot;. Fokine&#x27;s choreography was seen as a triumph of his creative genius; the natural miming and many styles of dance displayed were popular with audiences.

Many critics praised Stravinsky&#x27;s alignment with Russian nationalist music, one saying, &quot;[Stravinsky is] the only one who has achieved more than mere attempts to promote Russia&#x27;s true musical spirit and style&quot;. Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi hailed the young composer as the legitimate heir to The Mighty Handful. Russian audiences viewed the work less favorably, and the Russian premiere was not well-received; according to a reviewer in &quot;Apollon&quot;, &quot;Many deserted the Hall of Nobles during the performance of this suite.&quot; A fellow Rimsky-Korsakov pupil, Jāzeps Vītols, wrote that &quot;Stravinsky, it seems, has forgotten the concept of pleasure in sound... [His] dissonances unfortunately quickly become wearying, because there are no ideas hidden behind them&quot;. Nikolai Myaskovsky reviewed the piano reduction of the full ballet in October 1911 and wrote, &quot;What a wealth of invention, how much intelligence, temperament, talent, what a remarkable, what a rare piece of work this is&quot;.

Stravinsky recalled that after the premiere and subsequent performances, he met many figures in the Paris art scene, including Marcel Proust, Sarah Bernhardt, Jean Cocteau, Maurice Ravel, André Gide, and Princesse Edmond de Polignac. Claude Debussy was brought on stage after the premiere, and he invited Stravinsky to dinner, beginning a lifelong friendship between the two composers. According to Sergei Bertensson, Sergei Rachmaninoff said of the music: &quot;Great God! What a work of genius this is! This is true Russia!&quot; Debussy later said of Stravinsky&#x27;s score, &quot;What do you expect? One has to start somewhere.&quot; Richard Strauss told the composer in private that he had made a &quot;mistake&quot; in beginning the piece &quot;pianissimo&quot; instead of astonishing the public with a &quot;sudden crash&quot;. Shortly after he summed up to the press his experience of hearing &quot;The Firebird&quot; for the first time by saying, &quot;it&#x27;s always interesting to hear one&#x27;s imitators&quot;. Sergei Prokofiev, who first heard the piano reduction at a gathering, told Stravinsky, &quot;there was no music in [the ballet&#x27;s introduction] and if there was any, it was from &quot;Sadko&quot;&quot;.

In his 1962 autobiography, Stravinsky credited much of the production&#x27;s success to Golovin&#x27;s set and Diaghilev&#x27;s collaborators; he wrote that Fokine&#x27;s choreography &quot;always seemed to me to be complicated and overburdened with plastic detail, so that the artists felt, and still feel now, great difficulty in co-ordinating their steps and gestures with the music&quot;. The ballet&#x27;s success secured Stravinsky&#x27;s position as Diaghilev&#x27;s star composer, and there were immediate talks of a sequel, leading to the composition of &quot;Petrushka&quot; and &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;.

=== Subsequent productions ===
After the success of the premiere, Diaghilev announced an expansion of performances until 7 July 1910, the last of which Stravinsky took his family to from their home in Ustilug. Andrey Rimsky-Korsakov quickly traveled to Paris to see the expanded run, and he later praised the production in a letter to his mother. Following the initial run, Alexander Siloti conducted the Russian premiere on 23 October, performing an early draft of the 1911 suite.The debut London season of the Ballets Russes took place in 1912 at the Royal Opera House. The third ballet on the program was &quot;The Firebird&quot;, which was well-received. Osbert Sitwell wrote: &quot;Never until that evening had I heard Stravinsky&#x27;s name; but as the ballet developed, it was impossible to mistake the genius of the composer, or of the artist who had designed the setting.&quot; The Ballets Russes revived the production in 1926 with new settings and costumes by Natalia Goncharova, using Fokine&#x27;s original choreography. The revival was presented at the Lyceum Theatre in London. In 1916, the first productions of &quot;The Firebird&quot; and &quot;Petrushka&quot; on the Iberian peninsula took place; the Ballets Russes returned in 1921 for short season in Madrid. Several companies presented their own choreographies and designs of &quot;The Firebird&quot; from 1927 to 1933, including the Berlin State Opera, the Royal Swedish Ballet, the Royal Danish Ballet, and the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb. In 1935 and 1940, Wassily de Basil&#x27;s Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo revived the Ballets Russes production with Fokine&#x27;s choreography and Goncharova&#x27;s designs.

Many later revivals modeled their choreography after Fokine&#x27;s, including Adolph Bolm&#x27;s 1945 production at the Ballet Theatre and Serge Lifar&#x27;s 1954 Paris Opera Ballet production. Serge Grigoriev and Lubov Tchernicheva&#x27;s 1954 Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet staging with Fokine&#x27;s choreography is considered one of the most important and authentic revivals; Grigoriev and Tchernicheva worked for Diaghilev during the initial run, and the lead dancer, Margot Fonteyn, was coached by Karsavina. The Sadler&#x27;s Wells staging also used Goncharova&#x27;s 1926 designs. A film version of the revival was made in 1959.

New York City Ballet&#x27;s first big hit as a company after their founding in 1948 was its staging of &quot;The Firebird&quot; the following year, with Maria Tallchief as the Firebird, choreography by George Balanchine, and scenery and costumes by Marc Chagall. Balanchine placed a heavy emphasis on the dancing rather than Stravinsky&#x27;s score, establishing Tallchief as one of the first celebrity American-born and -trained ballerinas. Balanchine revised it in 1970 with Jerome Robbins, the latter of whom choreographed Koschei and his subjects&#x27; dance. The young Gelsey Kirkland danced the title role with a new costume inspired by Chagall&#x27;s sets. New York City Ballet&#x27;s production remains the most well-known and longest-lived revival in the United States.

Maurice Béjart&#x27;s 1971 production differed from the traditional themes of the ballet; it featured a male Firebird, representative of the spirit of revolution, leading an all-male group of partisans clad in blue tunics and dungarees through political turmoil. After the Firebird, dressed in a red leotard, dies in battle, he &quot;rises from the ashes and lives again&quot;, as Béjart said in an interview for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. In 1970, John Neumeier devised a science-fiction production of the ballet set in a futuristic world but retaining the original plot. In the initial Oper Frankfurt production, Koschei is a large glass robot with CCTV eyes; the Firebird, wearing a white space suit, defeats him by destroying a specific valve in his system. Neumeier was praised by the critic Oleg Kerensky for giving the ballet &quot;new life&quot; and creating a fascinating effect for the audience &quot;which the original Fokine-Golovine [&quot;sic&quot;] production must have had in Paris sixty years ago&quot;. Many other choreographers have staged the work with Fokine&#x27;s original choreography or created entirely new productions using the music. Stagings with new choreography include John Cranko&#x27;s 1964 production with the Stuttgart Ballet, Glen Tetley&#x27;s 1981 staging with the Royal Danish Ballet, John Taras&#x27;s 1982 Caribbean-set rendition with the Dance Theatre of Harlem, Christopher Wheeldon&#x27;s 1999 production with the Boston Ballet, Krzysztof Pastor&#x27;s 1999 version with the West Australian Ballet, and Alexei Ratmansky&#x27;s 2012 production with the American Ballet Theatre.

=== Legacy ===
Critics praised the music of &quot;The Firebird&quot; emotional character. Cyril W. Beaumont wrote that the work &quot;is a supreme example of how music, although having no meaning in itself, can, particularly with a programme hint of its intention, evoke a mood appropriate to the ballet concerned.&quot; Robert Craft considered the music &quot;as literal as opera&quot;, referring to the &quot;mimetic specificity&quot; with which the music follows the story, a trait Stravinsky later disliked and apologized for. The composer wrote that &quot;The Firebird&quot; became a centerpiece in his career; his conducting debut was a ballet performance of &quot;The Firebird&quot; in 1915, and he said that he performed it &quot;nearly a thousand times&quot; more.

Fokine&#x27;s revolutionary Firebird character was part of an effort to combine new ideas with classical ballet, showing his wide-ranging abilities as a choreographer. He later described his style as a diversion from the &quot;conventional system of gesticulation&quot; and a move towards natural expression through movement. The wide resources and experienced artists that Fokine accessed allowed him to create massive productions like &quot;The Firebird&quot;. Each character or group had their own unique choreography, creating complex scenes like the &quot;Infernal Dance&quot;, where the Firebird enchants Koschei&#x27;s subjects but they all dance differently. Dance critic Alastair Macaulay called this the &quot;most complex choreography that had ever been attempted in ballet&quot; at the time.

== Music ==
Throughout the score, Stravinsky used leitmotifs (short, recurring musical phrases associated with a particular person, place, or thing) placed in the harmony, a system he later dubbed &quot;leit-harmony&quot;. The idea of leit-harmony was likely introduced to the composer through Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s operas &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot; (1907) and &quot;Kashchey the Deathless&quot; (1902). In these works, mortal elements were associated with the diatonic scales while supernatural elements were associated with the chromatic scale. For example, Stravinsky describes Koschei&#x27;s leit-harmony as consisting of &quot;Magic Thirds&quot;; the harmony begins with a major or minor third, and the lower voice ascends a tritone while the higher voice descends a half step. The title character&#x27;s leit-harmony uses a chromatic descent of the first four notes of the introduction, then reversing those notes, giving the music an &quot;iridescent sheen&quot;, as Eric Walter White described it.

Stravinsky wrote that &quot;The Firebird&quot; may be the first appearance of &quot;metrical irregularity&quot; in his music. The passage is marked , with barlines dividing measures into sets of one and two. White wrote that the composer&#x27;s earlier works made use of consistent musical pulses, &quot;which was to be disturbed as little as possible by &quot;tempo rubato&quot;&quot;. Stravinsky remarked that he composed &quot;The Firebird&quot; in &quot;revolt against Rimsky&quot;, and that he &quot;tried to surpass him with &quot;ponticello&quot;, &quot;col legno&quot;, &quot;flautando&quot;, &quot;glissando&quot;, and fluttertongue effects&quot;.

A performance of the full ballet lasts about 45 minutes.

=== Instrumentation ===
The work is scored for a large orchestra with the following instrumentation:

* Woodwinds
** 2 piccolos (2nd doubles 3rd flute)
** 2 flutes
** 3 oboes
** English horn
** 3 clarinets in A (3rd doubles clarinet in D)
** bass clarinet in B
** 3 bassoons (3rd doubles 2nd contrabassoon)
** contrabassoon
* Brass
** 4 horns in F
** 3 trumpets in A
** 3 trombones
** tuba
** 3 onstage trumpets
** 2 onstage tenor Wagner tubas
** 2 onstage bass Wagner tubas
* Percussion
** bass drum
** cymbals
** triangle
** tambourine
** tamtam
** glockenspiel
** xylophone
** piano
** celesta
** timpani
* Strings
** 3 harps
** first violins
** second violins
** violas
** cellos
** double basses
Stravinsky described the orchestra as &quot;wastefully large&quot;, but White opined that the orchestration allowed him to use a variety of effects, including horn and trombone glissandi borrowed from Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s parts of &quot;Mlada&quot; (1872).

=== Structure ===

=== Music and plot ===

&quot;The Firebird&quot; opens with a slow introduction describing Koschei&#x27;s enchanted garden, underlined by the low strings presenting the basis of the Firebird&#x27;s leit-harmony. In the garden are Koschei&#x27;s enemies petrified into statues. Crescendo and decrescendo phrases in the strings and woodwinds indicate the entrance of the Firebird, being pursued by Prince Ivan. The Firebird&#x27;s capture by Ivan is depicted with &quot;sforzando&quot; chords in the horns, and exotic melodies in the oboe, English horn, and viola play as she begs to be released. After the Firebird is freed, Ivan takes one of her feathers, and thirteen enchanted princesses (all captives of Koschei) enter the garden to play a catching game. Ivan introduces himself to the youngest princess, with whom he has fallen in love, and they perform a slow khorovod. The melody for the khorovod is taken from a Russian folk song that Rimsky-Korsakov used in his Sinfonietta on Russian Themes (1879). Offstage trumpets call the princesses back into the palace, but when Ivan pursues them, bells ring out and Koschei appears in front of the gates, signaled by roars in the timpani and bass drum.
Before Koschei can turn Ivan into stone, the prince summons the Firebird with the feather, and she enchants Koschei and his subjects and begins the famous &quot;Infernal Dance&quot;. Another Rimsky-Korsakov reference, the melody is borrowed from Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s parts of &quot;Mlada&quot;, adding syncopation and startling strikes throughout the theme. As the dance winds down with very loud brass glissandos, Koschei and his subjects fall asleep from exhaustion. The bassoon introduces the Firebird&#x27;s tranquil lullaby. Ivan is instructed to destroy the egg that holds Koschei&#x27;s soul. The music jostles around as Ivan tosses the egg from hand to hand.

When Ivan crushes the egg, Koschei dies and the scene is surrounded in &quot;Profound Darkness&quot; while his subjects and enemies are freed from their enchantments. The finale opens with a solo horn announcing the break of dawn, another theme borrowed from Rimsky-Korsakov. The theme grows in the orchestra, building into a triumphant celebration among the freed subjects ending in a brass fanfare.

== Suites ==

Shortly after the completion of &quot;The Firebird&quot;, Stravinsky wrote a piano solo reduction of the whole ballet. The composer later arranged three suites for concert performance, dated 1911, 1919, and 1945.

=== 1911 suite ===

# Introduction – Koschei&#x27;s Enchanted Garden – Dance of the Firebird
# Supplication of the Firebird
# The Princesses&#x27; Game with Golden Apples
# The Princesses&#x27; Khorovod
# Infernal Dance of all Koschei&#x27;s Subjects

The first suite, titled &quot;&quot;, was composed in 1911 and published by P. Jurgenson the following year. The instrumentation is essentially the same as that of the ballet. The score was printed from the same plates; only the new endings for the movements were newly engraved. A performance of the 1911 suite lasts about 21 minutes.

=== 1919 suite ===

# Introduction – The Firebird and its Dance – Variation of the Firebird
# The Princesses&#x27; Khorovod (Rondo)
# Infernal Dance of King Kashchei
# Lullaby
# Finale

This suite was composed in Morges, Switzerland, for a smaller orchestra. Walsh alleged the suite was composed to re-copyright the work, as Stravinsky sold the new suite to his publisher J. &amp; W. Chester, despite the original ballet still being in copyright. The score contained many errors; Stravinsky wrote in 1952 that &quot;the parts of the 1919 version were in such poor condition and so full of mistakes&quot;. Regardless, the 1919 suite remains the most popular today. A performance of the 1919 suite lasts about 26 minutes.

=== 1945 suite ===

# Introduction – Prelude and Dance of the Firebird – Variations (Firebird)
# Pantomime I
# Pas de deux: Firebird and Ivan Tsarevich
# Pantomime II
# Scherzo: Dance of the Princesses
# Pantomime III
# Rondo (Khorovod)
# Infernal Dance
# Lullaby (Firebird)
# Final Hymn

In 1945, shortly before he acquired American citizenship, Stravinsky was contacted by Leeds Music with a proposal to revise the orchestration of his first three ballets to recopyright them in the United States. The composer agreed and fashioned a new suite based on the 1919 version, adding to it and reorchestrating several minutes of the pantomimes from the original score. The only instrumentation change was the addition of a snare drum. A performance of the 1945 suite lasts about 28 minutes.

== Recordings ==
Stravinsky received several commissions to transcribe his works for player pianos, some from the London Aeolian Company and some from the Paris Pleyel Company. In 1928, the Aeolian Company published an &quot;Audiographic&quot; piano roll of &quot;The Firebird&quot;, containing both the piano reduction and comments on the work by Stravinsky. The composer identified many of the leit-harmonies in the opening comments of the roll, providing an invaluable resource for information on the ballet.

The first orchestral recording of &quot;The Firebird&quot; was released by Columbia Records in 1928 with Stravinsky conducting L&#x27;Orchestre des Concerts Straram. The 78 rpm record consisted of the 1911 suite with the Lullaby and Finale from the 1919 suite, as well as a recording of &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;. In 1933, Stravinsky and the violinist Samuel Dushkin recorded a reduction of the &quot;Scherzo&quot; and &quot;Lullaby&quot; for His Master&#x27;s Voice. Stravinsky recorded the 1945 suite with the Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra of New York in 1946, and the complete ballet with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra in 1961. A film version of the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet revival was made in 1959, with Margot Fonteyn in the lead role. A production by the Dance Theater of Harlem with Stephanie Dabney in the lead was filmed for television in 1982.

<text>Mosonmagyaróvár (; ; also known by other alternative names) is a town in Győr-Moson-Sopron County in northwestern Hungary. It lies close to both the Austrian and Slovakian borders and has a population of 32,752 ().

Mosonmagyaróvár used to be two separate towns, Magyaróvár (, ) and Moson (, ). The town of Moson was the original capital of Moson County in the Kingdom of Hungary, but the county seat was moved to Magyaróvár during the Middle Ages. The two towns were combined in 1939, and by now almost all signs of dualism have disappeared, as the space between the two towns has become physically and culturally developed. Due to the name&#x27;s length, Mosonmagyaróvár is also referred to as &quot;Óvár&quot; amongst locals and &quot;Moson&quot; by foreigners. The Hansági Museum is located in Mosonmagyaróvár.

==Etymology and names==
The name &quot;Moson&quot; comes from Slavic &quot;*mъšьnъ&quot; &#x27;mossy&#x27;, in the wider meaning also &#x27;moss-covered mud, marsh&#x27;, elided from &quot;mъšьnъ (gradъ)&quot; &#x27;castle in the marsh&#x27; (see also Mšeno, Mszana). The settlement was attested in written sources as &quot;Mussun&quot; in 1137.

The name &quot;Magyaróvár&quot; literally means &#x27;ancient Hungarian castle&#x27; in Hungarian, although the prefix &quot;Magyar-&quot; was only added to the name after confusion with a similarly named town in Austria called Deutsch-Altenburg (), literally &#x27;ancient German castle&#x27;). The &quot;ancient castle&quot; referred to in Mosonmagyaróvár is the ruins of the Roman fortress Ad Flexum. The settlement was attested in written sources as &quot;Altenburch&quot; in 1271.

The two names were simply combined when the two towns were administratively unified (as with Budapest), rather than being hyphenated as &quot;Moson-Magyaróvár&quot;.

The city is also known by alternative names in other languages: , , and .

==History==
The area around Mosonmagyaróvár has been inhabited since the 5th millennium BC, but settlement of the city proper can only be traced to around the 1st century, which was when the Roman Empire was extended to the Danube, creating the province of Pannonia. The Romans established a camp called Ad Flexum (Latin: &quot;towards the bend&quot;) at the site of Mosonmagyaróvár; it is likely that the Hungarians from the Árpád era would name the place &quot;Óvár&quot; due to the Roman ruins which would still be present during the 11th century. The purpose of Ad Flexum was to defend the Mosoni-Duna, but the security the legions provided also drew civilian settlement, especially since a major east–west trade route ran through the area. Circa 170 AD, Germanic barbarians who lived north of the Danube river attacked the settlement, nearly completely destroying it. The Romans reconquered the area around the 3rd century, and the town once again prospered, likely with a population of three or four thousand people. After the Emperor Valentinianus died in 375, Hunnic invasions drove the populace away.

After the Honfoglalás, King Stephen ordered the building of a castle at Moson to defend the border. Settlers flocked around the wooden and then stone castle, and by the 11th century it was described as a strong fortress and bustling merchant town; by this time, it was also the county seat of Moson. However, in 1030, the Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II was able to conquer the castle on his way to the Rába. During the Crusades, Kálmán, King of Győr and Moson, was able to defeat a Swabian-Bavarian army of 15,000 men from the castle. There was significant industrial and urban development during the 13th century, when Moson once again found itself along a trade route. Mills and churches were built during this time. All advances were destroyed, however, by Ottokar II, a Czech king, when he leveled the castle at Moson in 1271.

Béla IV, King of Hungary at the time, did not consider it worthwhile to try and rebuild the castle at Moson, and thus turned to Óvár as a promising site for a future fortress. The King gave a man named Conrad, who was of the Győr tribe, lands in Moson and funds to be able to accomplish this task. Though he made significant improvements to the castle, he defected to Ottokar II and Duke Albert of Austria. For this impunity, he was deprived of his lands, and from then on Óvár was an estate of the Hungarian queens. The first settlers to Óvár were refugees from the destroyed Moson, and in the 14th century it became a bustling city with new industry and urbanization. Mills along the Lajta became a source of employment and attention, as many were owned by the royal house. In 1354, Queen Elisabeth gave Óvár the title of &quot;queen&#x27;s town&quot;. This gave the townspeople the right to elect their own parish priest, have their own jurisdiction, inherit possessions, and pay no customs in all of Hungary. Later kings recognized these rights, but the townspeople still had to struggle to maintain them. After Louis II&#x27;s marriage to Mary of Habsburg, Óvár became a key defense on the Austrian border, which would come into play during the Turkish invasion.

In 1529, after the Turks were repulsed at the Siege of Vienna, they destroyed Óvár almost completely, leveling all of its Medieval buildings, including the castle and the Romanesque church. The armies of János Szapolyai and the Archduke Ferdinand also sacked the town. However, once again the inhabitants went about rebuilding it. During the Reformation, the town was almost completely converted to Lutheranism, and the famous preacher Huszár Gal opened a Lutheran school at Magyaróvár in 1555. Counterreformative movements forbade Protestantism in 1672, closing down the school and the Lutheran church. Due to the lax nature of the new statutes, and the rights of the townspeople as enforced by Ferdinand and Archduke Maximilian, however, religion did not become compulsory. During this time, Moson and Óvár alike were attacked by various armies, including Turkish and German mercenaries. After the fall of Győr in 1594, the castle was modernized to withstand a possible future attack by Italian engineers. During the 17th century Magyaróvár enjoyed great urban development and some independence.

In 1683, the new castle was helpless against the retreating Turkish army, which had been repulsed again at Vienna. Both Moson and Magyaróvár were set ablaze. Though the town archives were now completely destroyed, the damage was repaired more quickly this time around, at least quickly enough to allow Rákóczi to use the castle as a base during his war for independence from the Habsburgs. In 1721, after the revolution was crushed, the castle at Magyaróvár lost its strategic importance, and all military materiel was transferred to Bratislava. However, the town prospered greatly after the war, with the establishment of new guilds, a town doctor, and the Piarist school. The Austrian government wished to limit the independence of the town, but the people were able to hold on to a degree of autonomy; an agreement to this effect was signed in 1796 after delegates had been sent to Vienna and Buda. In 1809, Napoleon&#x27;s army demanded the town&#x27;s provisions for his wars of conquest, and although this impoverished the people, they saved the town from destruction.

During the revolution of 1848, Magyaróvár and Moson both contributed to the fight for independence. On 23 October of that year, Kossuth Lajos made a recruitment speech in the town. The regiments skirmished with the Austrian troops but were sorely defeated. For the rest of the 19th century, the towns continued to grow. Factories, hospitals, schools, and other social institutions were established. In 1855, a railway station was built on the line from Győr to Bruck an der Leitha. This was a time of relative peace. In 1881 the town of Moson had 4,903 inhabitants, of which 3,583 were ethnic Germans and 933 Hungarians, meanwhile Magyaróvár had 3,427 inhabitants, made up by 2,125 Germans and 998 Hungarians. By 1908 there was already talk of unifying the two towns.

During the First World War, the Austrians maintained an armory in Magyaróvár. As a consequence of the Treaty of Trianon, most of Moson county was lost to non-Hungarian lands and all signs of the Habsburg rule were destroyed. What followed was another period of peace, during which time Moson and Magyaróvár were administratively unified as Mosonmagyaróvár. However, cultural differences, and even rivalry, were to persist well into the later twentieth century. During the Second World War, unemployment plummeted and the town&#x27;s industry prospered. The town did not suffer much damage during the war; in 1946, its significant German population was deported. In 1948 bus services were created. During the later 1940s most of the town&#x27;s institutions were nationalized by the communist regime. As many as 50 protesting civilians were killed during the revolution of &#x27;56, and the town was slow to recover. During the communist years, a new &quot;town center&quot; was developed between the existing Medieval centers of Moson and Magyaróvár, and there was significant development, including the opening of a university, new schools, and other public projects.

After the reestablishment of the current Representative Parliamentary Democracy in 1989, the Young Democrats controlled the city administration for a few years, expanding tourism and making developments to the gas and sewage infrastructure. Notably, the Piarist school was reopened.

== Climate ==
Mosonmagyaróvár&#x27;s climate is classified as oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;). The annual average temperature is , the hottest month in July is , and the coldest month is in January. The annual precipitation is , of which June is the wettest with , while February is the driest with only . The extreme temperature throughout the year ranged from on 28 December 1996 to on 8 August 2013.
==Dentistry==
Dentistry appears to be by far the largest economical activity in Mosonmagyaróvár, with approximately 350 practicing dentists . Worldwide, this is the highest number of dentists in ratio to the total population. The reason for this is found in the demand for low-cost dentistry by Austrians, who have been crossing borders to Hungary for decades. With Vienna nearby, Mosonmagyaróvár is within easy reach and official Hungarian government figures show that 160,000 Austrians cross the border yearly for dental care.

Compared to economically wealthy countries where dental care is expensive, low business overheads in Hungary allow clinics to offer their services at extremely competitive rates. Especially for low-income or uninsured patients, dental tourism makes Mosonmagyaróvár worth visiting.

Due to these factors, dental tourism has greatly grown in Mosonmagyaróvár. In addition to dentists, clinics and guided tour providers, the local hospitality industry as a whole lives off the dental tourist trade. With nearby international airports in Bratislava, Budapest and Vienna, Mosonmagyaróvár even attracts patients worldwide, travelling from as faraway as Greenland, Canada and the United States.

==Broadcasting==
East of Mosonmagyaróvár at , there is a broadcasting station for AM and FM. The AM transmitter, which works on 1116 kHz with 2.2 kW uses as antenna a mast radiator, the FM-transmitter a free-standing lattice tower.

<text>ŽVPL is Slovenia&#x27;s oldest independent webzine, and was first published on May 18, 1998. It all started out on a drinking crusade which lasted for 42 days, when the editor-in-chief Davorin Pavlica and his friend / programmer Luka Ferlan realized that Slovenia does not have a proper entertainment webzine. They swapped beer for a keyboard, and in only one week, they published a webzine called ŽVPL.

ŽVPL is an acronym for &quot;Party guide to Ljubljana&quot; in Slovenian, and was inspired by Douglas Adams&#x27; novel The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy - the name for the webzine, not the webzine itself. It announces and reviews events, parties, concerts for all Slovenia; you can find domestic and international music news, movie reviews, and much more.

==List of ŽVPL&#x27;s editors==
The editors include:
* Luka Ferlan (editor-in-chief, 1998–1999)
* Davorin Pavlica (editor, 1998–1999; editor-in-chief, 1999–2013)
* Gregor Zalaznik (editor, 1999–2013)
* Mare Vavpotič (editor of photography, 1999–2013)

<text>Szentes is a town in south-eastern Hungary, Csongrád county, near the Tisza river. The town is a cultural and educational center of the region. It is the third most populous town in Csongrad county after Szeged and Hódmezővásárhely.

== History ==
The area around Szentes has been inhabited since the neolithic. The Szegvár-tűzkövesi idol, one of the Neolithic period&#x27;s only depictions of a male deity, was discovered in the area. During the barbarian invasions, many ethnic groups moved through the region, and there is archeological evidence of hundreds of graves belonging to Iazyges, Sarmatians, Gepids, Huns, and Avars. According to certain accounts, the legendary camp of Atilla the Hun was found in this area, at the confluence of the Tisza and the Körös rivers. The town was first documented about the land-division in 1332 and called &quot;&quot;Scenthus&quot;.&quot; It was said to be inhabited by descendants of the tribe of Ond, one of the seven tribes of Hungary, and it was also documented as containing a stone church dedicated to Andrew the Apostle. According to local tradition, Csongrad castle stood on the town&#x27;s boundaries until the time of the first Mongol invasion.

Following the Hungary&#x27;s defeat by Ottoman forces at the battle of Mohács, taxes were levied from Szentes by three different powers, meaning those who were able to leave the area, fled. The region suffered immensely under Ottoman rule, and entire towns were wiped off the map. The region further suffered during the Long Turkish War, with more towns going extinct, and many of Szentes&#x27; inhabitants seeking refuge by dwelling in the nearby wetlands. In 1647, Ferdinand III was defeated by Ottoman forces outside Szentes, but the Ottoman forces had to withdraw from the region. In 1693, Szentes and the surrounding region was scorched and pillaged by Crimean Tatars looking for food following their failed attempt to capture Gyula. In 1709, the town suffered an outbreak of the Plague, killing over 1000 of its inhabitants.

The townsfolk played an active role in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, and it was visited by Kossuth Lajos himself to recruit troops. After the Habsburgs crushed the revolution, many young men were forcibly enlisted in the Imperial Army as punishment, and the mayor was sentenced to hard labour.

<doc id="1060493" wikidata="Q5245540" url="?curid=1060493" title="Deadbolt (band)">
<text>Deadbolt is an American rock band from San Diego, California. Fusing rockabilly and surf music with tongue-in-cheek horror-themed lyrics, Deadbolt has called itself the &quot;scariest band in the world&quot;, classifying their musical style as &quot;voodoobilly&quot;.

== History ==
The band originally formed in 1988 as a trio, featuring guitarist and vocalist Harley Davidson, bassist and vocalist Robert &quot;RA&quot; MacLean and drummer Les Vegas. Both Vegas and MacLean have since left the band. Vegas&#x27; departure is chronicled in the song &quot;Po&#x27; Boy&quot; on the album &quot;Hobo Babylon&quot;. The other current members of the band are bassist Gary &quot;3rd Degree&quot; Burns (part of the band&#x27;s &quot;Wall Of Thunder&quot;) and drummer Tank Johnson. Tank Johnson died on January 11, 2015. Former members of the band include The PhanTom (bass and guitar), Claymore Mines (bass), The Coroner (bass), Coffin Boy (bass), Moose Cutter (bass), and Mark Davidson (Harley&#x27;s brother) aka Lord Von Crappo who still occasionally plays with the band. Vocalist/guitarist Diana Death occasionally contributes.

Three members of the band were also in a short-lived offshoot group called Strangers 1800, which performed music from Spaghetti Western films and TV westerns and released one EP, &quot;When Men Were Men and the Sheep Were Scared&quot; and one split record with Deadbolt on Goldenrod Records.

== Musical style and influences ==
Bassist Gary Burns described the band&#x27;s music as &quot;voodoobilly—the darker side of the rockabilly family.&quot; The band&#x27;s music fuses surf music and rockabilly with horror-themed lyrics. Vocalist Harley Davidson performs spoken vocals. Ian Trumbull, writing for AllMusic, compared the band&#x27;s music to &quot;the Ventures playing spooky surf music behind a dry, &quot;Dragnet&quot; style narrative&quot;. The band has called itself the &quot;scariest band in the world&quot; as part of its tongue-in-cheek humor. The band uses power tools during their live performances, showering their audiences with sparks.

<text>Felicjan Kępiński (29 April 1885, in Piotrków Trybunalski, Poland – 8 April 1966, in Warsaw) was a Polish astronomer.

== Work ==

In 1903 he graduated from the government secondary school in Piotrków Trybunalski, later the 1st Bolesław Chrobry General Secondary School. In 1905 he took part in a students’ strike. As part of this boycott of Russian universities, he chose to study abroad. He first studied philosophy at the University of Leipzig (1905-1906), then mathematics and astronomy at the University of Göttingen (1906-1909) and the University of Berlin (1909-1912). In March 1913 he received his doctorate in philosophy. 

During the First World War he worked at the Berlin-Babelsberg astronomical observatory. In 1918, after Poland regained its independence, he moved to Warsaw. He later became assistant professor at the Astronomical Observatory of the University of Warsaw. He remained in this position until 1927. In 1925 he received his postdoctoral degree at the University of Vilnius. In 1927 he became a professor at the Warsaw University of Technology, where he founded the astronomical observatory, and also acted as its director from 1925 to 1955. 

In 1921, he initiated the publication of the Astronomical Yearbook, of which he was an editor for many years. 

Felicjan Kepiński was engaged in long-term research on the movement of the comet 22P/Kopffa, and on later used this research as the basis for his papers on the mechanics of heaven. In his work he dealt with issues concerning geodetic astronomy. 

In 1979, the International Astronomical Union named the Kępiński crater on the Moon after Felicjan Kępiński.</text><links>

He is responsible for writing the line still sung by schoolchildren in the United States, &quot;School days, school days; dear old golden rule days. Readin&#x27; and &#x27;ritin&#x27; and &#x27;rithmetic; taught to the tune of a hick&#x27;ry stick,&quot; which came from his song, &quot;School Days&quot;, published in 1907.

In 1897, Cobb wrote the lyrics and Paul Barnes composed the music to the Spanish–American War-era song &quot;Goodbye, Dolly Gray.&quot; In the early 1900s, the song was adopted with re-written lyrics, as the theme song for the Australian Football League club, Collingwood.

<doc id="1060501" wikidata="Q4949465" url="?curid=1060501" title="Bouie v. City of Columbia">
<text>Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347 (1964), was a case in which the US Supreme Court held that due process prohibits retroactive application of any judicial construction of a criminal statute that is unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law that has been expressed prior to the conduct in issue. The holding is based on the Fourteenth Amendment prohibition by the Due Process Clause of ex post facto laws.

==Background==

On March 14, 1960, two African-American students from Allen University conducted a sit-in demonstration by sitting down at a booth at the lunch counter restaurant in an Eckerd&#x27;s drugstore in Columbia, South Carolina. The policy at the store was to allow African-Americans to shop anywhere in the store and to use any facilities except for being served at the restaurant.

After they had sat down, an employee put up a &quot;no trespassing sign,&quot; and the two students were asked to leave. Both were arrested on charges of breach of the peace and criminal trespass but convicted only for trespass in violation of the state code. The trespass convictions were upheld by the South Carolina Supreme Court.

==Decision==
The majority opinion by Justice Brennan noted that the South Carolina trespass statute criminalized entry upon the lands of another after notice from an owner or tenant prohibiting such entry. The South Carolina Supreme Court, in upholding the convictions, had construed the statute as also covering the act of remaining on the premises of another after receiving notice to leave, a construction that had been adopted in another case in 1961.

The Court stated that a judicial construction that has the effect of broadening the activities that constitute a crime and is applied retroactively operates precisely like an ex post facto law. Since an ex post facto application of criminal statutes violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court reversed the convictions.

The concurring opinions of Justice Goldberg and Justice Douglas stated simply that they would reverse based upon their opinions in &quot;Bell v. Maryland&quot;, 378 U.S. 226 (1964), another case involving a sit-in demonstration by African-American students that was announced the same day as &quot;Bouie&quot;.

The dissenting opinion by Justice Black argued that the conduct of remaining after being told to leave was understood to violate the South Carolina trespass statute, and &quot;Bell&quot; stated that the Fourteenth Amendment did not require an owner of a restaurant to serve customers.

==Critical response==
&quot;Bouie v. City of Columbia&quot; was one of five cases involving segregation protests that were decided on June 22, 1964. The other four cases were &quot;Griffin v. Maryland&quot;, 378 U.S. 130 (1964), &quot;Barr v. City of Columbia&quot;, 378 U.S. 146 (1964), &quot;Robinson v. Florida&quot;, 378 U.S. 153 (1964), and &quot;Bell v. Maryland&quot;. In none of these cases did the Supreme Court reach the merits of any argument addressing whether private actions of segregation that are enforced by state courts constituted a state action, which violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. These decisions were announced two days after the Senate ended a filibuster and passed the bill which would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed segregation in public accommodations. It has been suggested that the Supreme Court refrained from reaching the merits in these cases in consideration of the Act; had it done so, it would have eliminated the basis for passage of the legislation.

<text>The Atlante Internazionale del Touring Club Italiano was a comprehensive world reference atlas first published by the Touring Club Italiano in 1927.

In order to give Italy an extensive reference atlas modelled on foreign examples such as &quot;Stielers Handatlas&quot; in Germany, shortly after World War I preparatory work to this end began under the direction of Luigi Vittorio Bertarelli (founder of the TCI, 1859–1926) with collaboration of Olinto Marinelli as scientific editor and Pietro Corbellini as chief cartographer. The atlas, in which toponymy was based on the official language of each country, was presented to the public in 1927 as Atlante Internazionale del Touring Club Italiano; it had 169 leaves of maps, large folio format, and contained more than 200,000 entries. The second edition appeared already one year later and received the highest recognitions at the International Geographical Congress in Cambridge. Three more editions were issued up to World War II.

After the war the atlas maintained the same character with relief in the style of the great classic atlases (hachuring), in contrast to newly published works, that used isohypses (contour lines) to indicate altitudes. This, side by side with the superior typography of the hand-drawn type in the &quot;Atlante Internazionale&quot;, the lettering, gave the maps a very attractive appearance. The seventh edition was issued 1955/56, the last and eighth edition in 1968: an atlas of 50 x 32 centimetres with 94 tables, in total 173 pages of cartographic material, and an index, covering 250,000 geographical names; the map surface consisted of about 18 square metres! The eighth edition was finally reprinted in 1977.

<text>CINT is a command line C/C++ interpreter that was originally included in the object oriented data analysis package ROOT. Although intended for use with the other faculties of ROOT, CINT can also be used as a standalone addition to another program that requires such an interpreter. In 2013, CERN switched to the Cling C++ interpreter, so CINT is now distributed standalone by the author.

CINT is an interpreted version of C/C++, much in the way BeanShell is an interpreted version of Java. In addition to being a language interpreter, it offers certain Bash-like shell features such as history and tab-completion. To accomplish the latter, it relies heavily on the reflection support built into ROOT. User classes that follow these interfaces may also take advantage of these features.

The language originally interpreted by CINT was actually something of a hybrid between C and C++, covering about 95% of ANSI C and 85% of C++. The syntax, however, is a bit more forgiving than either language. For example, the operator codice_1 can be replaced by codice_2 with only an optional warning. In addition, statements on the command line do not need to end with a semi-colon, although this is necessary for statements in macros.

As an alternative to CINT, ROOT also provides Cling which is an REPL application using LLVM&#x27;s Clang as a C++ JIT compilation environment.

<text>Lorraine Smith (née Kelly; born 30 November 1959) is a Scottish television presenter. She has presented various television shows for ITV and STV, including &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; (1988–1992), &quot;GMTV&quot; (1993–2010), &quot;This Morning&quot; (2003–2005, 2016), &quot;Daybreak&quot; (2012–2014), &quot;The Sun Military Awards&quot; (2016–present), &quot;STV Children&#x27;s Appeal&quot; (2016–present), and her eponymous programme &quot;Lorraine&quot; (2010–present).

Between 2004 and 2007, Kelly was Rector of the University of Dundee. She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to charity and was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2020 Birthday Honours for services to broadcasting, journalism and charity.

==Early life==
Kelly was born on 30 November 1959 at Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital and lived in the Gorbals area until she was two. She has Irish ancestry. The Kellys originally came from Draperstown in Northern Ireland and went to Scotland in the 18th century looking for work. Her father, John, worked as a television repairman. She has one brother, born six years later. Kelly moved to Bridgeton, Glasgow at the age of two, before moving to East Kilbride when she was 13, where she attended Claremont High School. She turned down a university place to study English and Russian in favour of a job on the &quot;East Kilbride News&quot;, her local newspaper, and then joined BBC Scotland as a researcher in 1983. She moved to TV-am as an on-screen reporter covering Scottish news in 1984.

==Career==

===1984–1993: &quot;TV-am&quot; and &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;===

In early October 1984, Kelly joined TV-am as Scotland Correspondent. On the back of her coverage of the Pan Am Flight 103 disaster in Lockerbie, in July 1989, Kelly presented TV-am&#x27;s &quot;Summer Sunday&quot; programme with chief reporter Geoff Meade.

Throughout the rest of 1989, Kelly provided cover for the presenters on the main weekday programme. On 31 January 1990, she became a main presenter of &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; alongside Mike Morris.

===1993–2010: &quot;GMTV&quot; and Talk Radio===
In January 1993, Kelly helped launch &quot;GMTV&quot; by presenting a range of programmes. Her first job was presenting the new &quot;Top of the Morning&quot;. In March, when Fiona Armstrong walked out of the main GMTV show, Kelly moved to the main breakfast show with Eamonn Holmes. In June 1994, Kelly went on maternity leave, but shortly afterwards she was sacked from the main presenting roles, she returned in November 1994 to do a mother and baby slot. This led to her becoming the presenter of &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock Live&quot;. The show proved so popular that it was moved to the earlier 08:35 slot, retitled &quot;Lorraine Live&quot;.

Kelly also had a stint in radio, with her own daily programme broadcast on air by then new British phenomenon of Talk Radio (precursor of TalkSport) around 1997–99. In Autumn 2000, as &quot;GMTV&quot; rebranded to &quot;GMTV Today&quot;, Kelly&#x27;s show changed its name to &quot;LK Today&quot;. As part of the later rebrand that took place in 2009, the show again changed its title to &quot;GMTV with Lorraine&quot;, to coincide with &quot;GMTV Today&quot; changing back to &quot;GMTV&quot;. &quot;Lorraine&quot; moved for the first time into the main &quot;GMTV&quot; studio, instead of Kelly having her own part of the studio to host from. In April 2010, to make &quot;GMTV&quot;″s programming more consistent, &quot;GMTV with Lorraine&quot; began airing all year round, instead of breaking during school holidays, with guest presenters.

According to the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;, in 2007, Kelly was prevented from appearing in an advertising campaign for Asda as GMTV managing director Clive Crouch felt that such a move would create more bad publicity for GMTV, which had recently been fined £2 million by broadcasting regulator Ofcom for its misuse of premium-rate phone lines. On 9 July 2010, as well as the announcement that &quot;GMTV&quot; had been axed to make way for &quot;Daybreak&quot;, it was also revealed that Kelly&#x27;s new programme &quot;Lorraine&quot; would replace &quot;GMTV with Lorraine&quot;. On 15 July 2010, Kelly presented her last show before leaving.

===2010–present: &quot;Lorraine&quot; and &quot;Daybreak&quot; ===

On 6 September 2010, &quot;GMTV&quot; ended with ITV Breakfast taking over. &quot;Lorraine&quot; launched with a brand new look, alongside &quot;Daybreak&quot;. In 2011, Kelly presented the ITV series &quot;Children&#x27;s Hospital&quot;, and was a guest presenter on the BBC Two series &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; in series 25. She provides voice-over and narration on the CBeebies show &quot;Raa Raa the Noisy Lion&quot;.

On 4 May 2012, it was confirmed that Kelly would take over from Christine Bleakley as presenter on &quot;Lorraine&#x27;s&quot; sister programme &quot;Daybreak&quot;. She debuted on 3 September 2012. She co-hosted the programme with Aled Jones from Monday to Thursday, with Kate Garraway co-hosting on Fridays.

In February 2014, Kelly announced that she would leave &quot;Daybreak&quot; to focus on &quot;Lorraine&quot; which she began hosting five days a week from 28 April 2014. &quot;Daybreak&quot; was replaced by &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; in April 2014. Lorraine would occasionally report for GMB whenever her show wasn&#x27;t aired. In 2024, Kelly has come under significant scrutiny on social media for her frequent absence of her show, Lorraine, which she leaves in the hands of Christine Lampard and Ranvir Singh. An account on X, tracking her attendance of her own show, has gained more than 10,000 followers. In 2014, Kelly made a cameo appearance in an episode of &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;. On 19 September 2014, Kelly reported from Dundee on &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; on the Scottish independence result. On 13 April 2016, Kelly guest presented an episode of &quot;This Morning&quot; with Rylan Clark-Neal.

Kelly presented a four-part series for Channel 5 called &quot;Penguin A&amp;E with Lorraine Kelly&quot;. The series began airing on 10 May 2016. In 2018, Kelly co-presented &quot;Wedding Day Winners&quot; with Rob Beckett. The show aired on Saturday nights on BBC One. In May 2019, she made a cameo in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she hosted her programme in the Good Morning Britain studio. &quot;Good Morning Britain with Lorraine&quot; had a more news-focused style to it, yet still featured interviews with celebrities, Hollywood updates from Ross King, and medical advice on the pandemic with Dr Hilary Jones. She returned to the Lorraine studio on 13 July.

===Other television work===

====2005–present: STV====

Kelly hosted the annual Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Awards in 2005 and 2006 for STV.

Daughter Emma Chawner is best known for her unsuccessful appearances on &quot;The X Factor&quot;. In 2010, in conjunction with the Missing People charity, Sky and STV produced a new documentary series hosted by Kelly, about missing mothers.

==Personal life==
Between 1993 and 2005, Kelly lived in Cookham Dean, Berkshire, on the Thames west of London, with her husband, Stephen &quot;Steve&quot; Smith, a television cameraman, whom she married on 5 September 1992 at Mains Castle in Dundee. Between 2005 and 2010, she lived in Coupar Angus, Perthshire. Kelly previously lived in Broughty Ferry, Dundee, and would stay in her flat in Westminster during the week, until she moved in December 2017 as she found commuting back and forth was not working. Kelly and her husband then decided to sell their Broughty Ferry home and moved to Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, to be closer to Lorraine&#x27;s work, and so they could spend more time together. Kelly has described herself as an &#x27;adopted Dundonian&#x27; and despite moving away, she considers Dundee to be a place that she will always call home.

They have one daughter, Rosie, born in 1994, who teamed up with Lorraine on &quot;The Cube&quot; in December 2021, playing for MS Therapy Centre which supports Steve&#x27;s sister. Kelly&#x27;s second pregnancy ended in miscarriage (2000). Kelly was born to a Catholic mother and a Protestant father, but she is an outspoken critic of Catholic schools in Scotland and has called for an end to them saying they were a cause of trouble in society, and prolonged the &quot;scandal of sectarianism&quot;.

Kelly has been a fan of the Scottish football team Dundee United since 1987 after being taken to a game by her now-husband. She was made an honorary patron of the club in 2018.

In 2018, Kelly spoke of her experiences with the menopause, and encouraged other women to speak about it.

On 29 August 2024, Kelly became a grandmother when her daughter Rosie and her fiancé Steve White had a daughter Billie.

<text>Berehove (, ; , ) is a city in Zakarpattia Oblast, western Ukraine. It is situated near the border with Hungary.

It is the cultural centre of the Hungarian minority in Ukraine, and Hungarians constitute roughly half (a plurality) of its population.

The city serves as the administrative center of Berehove Raion. It has a population of 

==Name==
The city has many different variations of spelling its name: , (translit. &quot;Berehovo&quot;), (translit. &quot;Beregovo&quot;), (Łacinka &quot;Bierahava&quot;), Czech and Slovak: Berehovo, , , , .

Residents of Berehove voted on October 31, 2010, in a referendum on renaming the town to Beregszász, its Hungarian-language name. Voter turnout was less than 52%, with 4,688 voting for for, 4,358 against, and 1,016 invalid ballots.

==Administrative division==
Part of the city is also a near adjacent village of Zatyshne of 504 people that has its representation in the city&#x27;s council.

Hungarian was made a regional language in Berehove in September 2012; meaning it would be used in the town&#x27;s administrative office work and documents. This was made possible after new legislation on languages in Ukraine was passed in the summer of 2012.

As of December 2020, all decisions of Zakarpattia&#x27;s local councils on the functioning of regional languages, including Hungarian in Berehove, were cancelled.

==Geography==

Berehove has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;).

==History==

In 1824, Berehove received the right to hold fairs 12 times a year. With the abolition of serfdom, the industrial development of the city began. Enterprises appeared, banks, savings banks, and credit institutions were opened.

In 1910, out of 12,933 inhabitants 12,432 were Hungarians (96.1%), 221 Ukrainians (Ruthenians) and 140 Germans. On April 27, 1919, the city was occupied by Czechoslovak and Romanian troops. At the end of 1919, according to the Saint-Germain Peace Treaty, it became part of Czechoslovakia.

It was the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary&#x27;s Bereg County until 1920 and between 1940 and 1945.

From 1920 until 1938 it was part of Czechoslovakia. Prior to World War II, the city had a significant Jewish population, estimated at 8,000 persons. Only four returned following the war.

A local newspaper has been published here since December 1945.

In January 1989 the population was 30,157 people.

The first Hungarian-language college in Ukraine is in Berehove, the II. Rákoczi Ferenc College.

<text>The Anglo-Scottish war (1650–1652), also known as the Third Civil War, was the final conflict in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between shifting alliances of religious and political factions in England, Scotland and Ireland.

The 1650 English invasion of Scotland was a pre-emptive military incursion by the English Commonwealth&#x27;s New Model Army, intended to allay the risk of Charles II invading England with a Scottish army. The First and Second English Civil Wars, in which English Royalists, loyal to Charles I, fought Parliamentarians for control of the country, took place between 1642 and 1648. When the Royalists were defeated for the second time the English government, exasperated by the duplicity of Charles I during negotiations, set up a High Court of Justice which found the King guilty of treason and executed him on 30 January 1649. At the time, England and Scotland were separate independent kingdoms, joined politically through a personal union; Charles I was, separately, both the King of Scotland, and the King of England. The Scots had fought in support of the English Parliamentarians in the First English Civil War, but sent an army in support of Charles I into England during the Second English Civil War. The Parliament of Scotland, which had not been consulted before the execution, declared his son, Charles II, King of Britain.

In 1650 Scotland was rapidly raising an army. The leaders of the English Commonwealth government felt threatened and on 22 July the New Model Army under Oliver Cromwell invaded Scotland. The Scots, commanded by David Leslie, retreated to Edinburgh and refused battle. After a month of manoeuvring, Cromwell unexpectedly led the English army out of Dunbar in a night attack on 3 September and heavily defeated the Scots. The survivors abandoned Edinburgh and withdrew to the strategic bottleneck of Stirling. The English secured their hold over southern Scotland, but were unable to advance past Stirling. On 17 July 1651 the English crossed the Firth of Forth in specially constructed boats and defeated the Scots at the Battle of Inverkeithing on 20 July. This cut off the Scottish army at Stirling from its sources of supply and reinforcements.

Charles II, believing that the only alternative was surrender, invaded England in August. Cromwell pursued, few Englishmen rallied to the Royalist cause and the English raised a large army. Cromwell brought the badly outnumbered Scots to battle at Worcester on 3 September and completely defeated them, marking the end of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Charles II was one of the few to escape. This demonstration that the English were willing to fight to defend the republic and capable of doing so effectively strengthened the position of the new English government. The defeated Scottish government was dissolved and the kingdom of Scotland was absorbed into the Commonwealth. Following much in-fighting Cromwell ruled as Lord Protector. After his death, further in-fighting resulted in Charles II being crowned King of England on 23 April 1661, twelve years after being crowned by the Scots. This completed the Stuart Restoration.

==Terminology==
Some historians have referred to the conflict, which followed the First and Second English Civil Wars, as the Third Civil War. This view has been criticised: John Philipps Kenyon and Jane Ohlmeyer noted that the conflict was not an exclusively English affair, so cannot be considered part of the English Civil War; the historian Austin Woolrych observed that it was almost entirely a conflict between Scottish and English forces, involving very few English soldiers fighting on behalf of the King at the final battle at Worcester, so it was &quot;seriously misleading&quot; to refer to it as a civil war. Although the conflict was certainly a part of the wider Wars of the Three Kingdoms, rather than being a continuation of the English Civil War, it was by this stage a war between Scotland, ruled by the Covenanting government under Charles II, and the English Commonwealth.

==Background==
===Bishops&#x27; Wars and English Civil Wars===
In 1639, and again in 1640, Charles I, who was king of both Scotland and England in a personal union, went to war with his Scottish subjects in the Bishops&#x27; Wars. These had arisen from the Scots&#x27; refusal to accept the attempts of Charles I to reform the Scottish Kirk to bring it into line with English religious practices. Charles I was not successful in these endeavours, and the ensuing settlement established the Covenanters&#x27; hold on Scottish government, requiring all civil office-holders, parliamentarians and clerics to sign the National Covenant, and giving the Scottish Parliament the authority to approve all the King&#x27;s councillors in Scotland. After years of rising tensions the relationship between Charles I and his English Parliament broke down, starting the First English Civil War in 1642.
In England the supporters of Charles I, the Royalists (Cavaliers), were opposed by the combined forces of the Parliamentarians (Roundheads) and the Scots. In 1643 the latter pair formed an alliance bound by the Solemn League and Covenant, in which the English Parliament agreed to reform the English church along similar lines to the Scottish Kirk in return for the Scots&#x27; military assistance. After four years of war the Royalists were defeated and Charles I surrendered to the Scots at their camp near Newark-on-Trent on 5 May 1646. The Scots agreed with the English Parliament on a peace settlement which would be put before the King. Known as the Newcastle Propositions, it would have required all the king&#x27;s subjects in Scotland, England and Ireland to sign the Solemn League and Covenant, brought the church in each kingdom into accordance with the Covenant and with Presbyterianism, and ceded much of secular authority of Charles I as king of England to the English Parliament. The Scots spent some months trying to persuade Charles I to agree to these terms, but he refused to do so. The Scottish army had remained in England after the war, pending payment of the large subsidy the Parliamentarians had promised. A financial settlement was reached, the Scots handed Charles I over to the English Parliamentary forces and they left England on 3 February 1647.

Charles I now engaged in separate negotiations with different factions. Presbyterian English Parliamentarians and the Scots wanted him to accept a modified version of the Newcastle Propositions, but in June 1647, Cornet George Joyce of the New Model Army seized Charles I, and the army council pressed him to accept the Heads of Proposals, a less demanding set of terms which, crucially, did not require a Presbyterian reformation of the church. He rejected these as well and instead signed an offer known as the Engagement, which had been thrashed out with the Scottish delegation, on 26 December 1647. Charles I agreed to confirm the Solemn League and Covenant by Act of Parliament in both kingdoms, and to accept Presbyterianism in England, but only for a trial period of three years, in return for the Scots&#x27; assistance in regaining his throne in England.

When the delegation returned to Edinburgh with the Engagement, the Scots were bitterly divided on whether to ratify its terms. Its supporters, who became known as the Engagers, argued that it offered the best chance the Scots would get of acceptance of the Covenant across the three kingdoms, and that rejecting it risked pushing Charles I to accept the Heads of Proposals. It was opposed by those who believed that to send an army into England on behalf of the King would be to break the Solemn League and Covenant, and that it offered no guarantee of a lasting Presbyterian church in England; the Kirk went so far as to issue a declaration on 5 May 1648 condemning the Engagement as a breach of God&#x27;s law. After a protracted political struggle, the Engagers gained a majority in the Scottish Parliament, by which time war had again broken out in England between Royalists and Parliamentarians. The Scots sent an army under the command of the Duke of Hamilton into England to fight on behalf of the King in July, but it was heavily defeated at Preston and then Winwick in August 1648 by a force led by Oliver Cromwell. The rout of the Engager army led to further political upheaval in Scotland, and the faction opposed to the Engagement was able to gain control of the government, with the assistance of a group of English Parliamentary cavalry led by Cromwell.

===Accession of Charles II===
Exasperated by the duplicity of Charles I and by the English Parliament&#x27;s refusal to stop negotiating with him and accept the demands of the New Model Army, the Army purged Parliament and established the Rump Parliament, which appointed a High Court of Justice to try Charles I for treason against the English people. He was convicted and on 30 January 1649 beheaded. On 19 May, with the establishment of the Commonwealth of England, the country became a republic. The Scottish Parliament, which had not been consulted before the king&#x27;s execution, declared his son Charles II, King of Britain. Before they would permit him to return from exile in the Dutch Republic to take up his crown, they demanded he sign both Covenants: recognising the authority of the Kirk in religious matters, and that of Parliament in civil affairs. Charles II was initially reluctant to accept these conditions, but after Cromwell&#x27;s campaign in Ireland crushed his Royalist supporters there, he felt compelled to accept the Scottish terms, and signed the Treaty of Breda on 1 May 1650. The Scottish Parliament set about rapidly recruiting an army to support the new king, and Charles II set sail to Scotland, landing on 23 June.

==English invasion of Scotland (1650–1652)==
The leaders of the English Commonwealth felt threatened by the Scots reassembling an army. They pressed Thomas Fairfax, lord general of the New Model Army, to launch a pre-emptive attack. Fairfax accepted the commission to lead the army north to defend against the possibility of a Scottish invasion, but was unwilling to strike the first blow against his former allies, believing England and Scotland were still bound by the Solemn League and Covenant. When a formal order to attack came on 20 June 1650, Fairfax resigned his commission. A parliamentary committee which included Cromwell, his close friend, attempted to dissuade him, pleading with him over the course of a whole night to change his mind, but Fairfax remained resolute, and retired from public life. Cromwell succeeded to his office as lord general, becoming commander-in-chief of the New Model Army. He received his commission on 28 June, and set out for Scotland the same day, crossing the Tweed at the head of 16,000 men on 22 July.

Once the Treaty of Breda had been signed, the Scottish Parliament started levying men to form a new army, under the command of the experienced general David Leslie. Their aim was to increase their forces to more than 36,000 men, but that number was never achieved; by the time Cromwell entered Scotland, Leslie had fewer than 10,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry, although these numbers fluctuated during the course of the campaign. The government instituted a commission to purge the army of anyone suspected of having supported the Engagement, as well as men considered sinful or undesirable. This was opposed, unsuccessfully, by much of the Scottish nobility and most of the experienced military leaders, including Leslie. The purge removed many experienced men and officers, and the bulk of the army was composed of raw recruits with little training or experience.

Leslie prepared a defensive line of earthworks between Edinburgh and Leith, and employed a scorched earth policy between this line and the English border. He then allowed Cromwell to advance unopposed. Lack of supplies, and the hostility of the local people towards the English invaders forced Cromwell to rely on a seaborne supply chain, and he captured the ports of Dunbar and Musselburgh to facilitate this. Operations were hampered by persistent bad weather. These adverse conditions caused a shortage of food and much sickness in the English army, substantially reducing its strength.
Cromwell attempted to bring the Scots to battle at Edinburgh. He advanced on Leslie&#x27;s lines on 29 July, capturing Arthur&#x27;s Seat and bombarding Leith from Salisbury Crags. Cromwell was not able to draw Leslie out, and the English retired to their camp at Musselburgh, where they were subjected to a night raid by a party of Scottish cavalry. Cromwell&#x27;s attack coincided with a visit by Charles II to the Scottish army, where he was warmly received. Members of the Covenanter government, concerned that their godly war would be corrupted by feelings of personal loyalty to the King, asked Charles II to leave. They then ordered a new purge, which was quickly enacted in early August, removing 80 officers and 4,000 of Leslie&#x27;s men. This damaged morale as well as weakening the army&#x27;s strength.

Throughout August Cromwell continued to try and draw the Scots out from their defences to enable a set piece battle. Leslie resisted, ignoring pressure from the secular and religious Scottish hierarchy to attack Cromwell&#x27;s weakened army. He reasoned that the persistent bad weather, the difficult English supply situation, and the dysentery and fever that had broken out in the English camp would force Cromwell to withdraw back into England before winter set in.

On 31 August Cromwell did withdraw; the English army reached Dunbar on 1 September, having taken two days to march the from Musselburgh, harassed day and night by the pursuing Scots. The road was left littered with abandoned equipment and the men arrived hungry and demoralised. The Scottish army outflanked the English, blocking the road to Berwick and England at the easily defended Cockburnspath Defile. Their main force encamped on the Doon Hill, south of Dunbar, where it overlooked the town and the coastal road running south west from the town. The hill was all but invulnerable to direct assault. The English army had lost its freedom of manoeuvre, although they could supply themselves by sea and, if need be, evacuate the army the same way. On 2 September Cromwell surveyed the situation, and wrote to the governor of Newcastle warning him to prepare for a possible Scottish invasion.

===Battle of Dunbar===

Believing the English army was in a hopeless situation and under pressure to finish it off rapidly, Leslie moved his army off the hill and into a position to attack Dunbar. On the night of 2-3 September Cromwell manoeuvred his army so as to be able to launch a concentrated pre-dawn attack against the Scots&#x27; right wing. Whether this was part of a plan to decisively defeat them, or part of an attempt to break through and escape back to England is debated by historians. The Scots were caught by surprise, but put up a stout resistance. Their cavalry were pushed back by the English, and Leslie was unable to deploy most of his infantry into the battle because of the terrain. The battle was undecided when Cromwell personally led his cavalry reserve in a flank attack on the two Scottish infantry brigades that had managed to come to grips with the English and rolled up the Scottish line. Leslie executed a fighting withdrawal, but some 6,000 Scots, from his army of 12,000, were taken prisoner, and approximately 1,500 killed or wounded. The prisoners were taken to England; many died on the march south, or in captivity. At least some of those who survived were deported to become indentured workers on English possessions in North America.

===Scottish retreat===

When the news of the defeat reached Edinburgh, many people fled the city in panic, but Leslie sought to rally what remained of his army, and established a new defensive line at the strategic choke point of Stirling. There he was joined by the bulk of the government, clergy, and Edinburgh&#x27;s mercantile elite. Major-general John Lambert was sent to capture Edinburgh, which fell on 7 September, while Cromwell marched on the port of Leith, which offered much better facilities for landing supplies and reinforcements than Dunbar. Without Leslie&#x27;s army to defend them, both were captured with little difficulty. Cromwell took pains to persuade the citizens of Edinburgh that his war was not with them; he promised their property would be respected, and allowed them to come and go freely, hold markets, and observe their usual religious services, although the latter were restricted as most of the clergy had removed to Stirling. He also took steps to secure food for the city, which by this point was short on supplies. Edinburgh Castle held out until December, but since it was cut off from reinforcement and supplies and offered no threat, Cromwell did not assault it, and treated its commander with courtesy. Austin Woolrych described the behaviour of the occupying troops as &quot;exemplary&quot;, and observed that after a short time many fugitives returned to the city, and its economic life returned to something akin to normality.

The defeat at Dunbar caused great damage to Leslie&#x27;s reputation and authority. He attempted to resign as head of the army, but the Scottish government would not permit it, largely because of a lack of any plausible replacement. Several of his officers refused to take orders from him, and left Leslie&#x27;s forces to join a new army being raised by the Western Association. Divisions already present in the Scottish government were widened by the new situation. The more practical blamed the purges for Leslie&#x27;s defeat, and looked to bring the Engagers back into the fold; the more dogmatic thought God had deserted them because the purges had not gone far enough, and argued that too much faith had been put in a worldly prince who was not sufficiently committed to the cause of the Covenant. These more radical elements issued the divisive Western Remonstrance, which castigated the government for its failure to properly purge the army, and further widened the rifts between the Scots. The Remonstrants, as this group became known, took command of the Western Association army, and attempted to negotiate with Cromwell, urging him to depart Scotland and leave them in control; Cromwell rejected their advances and comprehensively destroyed their army at the Battle of Hieton (near the centre of modern Hamilton) on 1 December.

===Battle of Inverkeithing===

During December 1650 Charles II and the Scottish government reconciled with the Engagers and those Highland chiefs who had been excluded due to their refusal to sign the Covenant. These competing factions were poorly coordinated and it was not until the late spring of 1651 that they were fully integrated into the Scottish army. In January 1651 the English attempted to outflank Stirling by shipping a force across the Firth of Forth, but this was unsuccessful. In early February the English army advanced against Stirling, then retreated in dreadful weather, Cromwell falling ill.

In late June the Scottish army advanced south. The English moved north from Edinburgh to meet them, but Leslie positioned his army north of Falkirk, behind the River Carron. This position was too strong for Cromwell to assault; Leslie resisted every provocation to fight another open battle and eventually withdrew. Cromwell followed and attempted to bypass Stirling, but was unable to. He then marched to Glasgow and sent raiding parties into Scottish-held territory. The Scottish army shadowed the English, moving south west to Kilsyth on 13 July.

Early on 17 July, an English force of 1,600 men under Colonel Robert Overton crossed the Firth of Forth at its narrowest point in 50 specially constructed flat-bottomed boats, landing at North Queensferry on the isthmus leading from the port to the mainland. The Scottish garrison at Burntisland moved towards the English landing place and sent for reinforcements from Stirling and Dunfermline. The Scots dug in and awaited their reinforcements, and for four days the English shipped the balance of their own force across the Forth and Lambert took command.

On 20 July the Scots, more than 4,000 strong and commanded by Major-general James Holborne advanced against the English force of approximately 4,000 men. After a ninety-minute hiatus the cavalry of both forces engaged on each flank. In both cases the Scots initially had the better of it, but failed to exploit their advantage, were counter-charged by the English reserves, and routed. The previously unengaged Scottish infantry attempted to retreat, but suffered heavy casualties in the running battle that ensued, losing many men killed or captured.

After the battle, Lambert marched east and captured the deep-water port of Burntisland. Cromwell shipped most of the English army there, assembling 13,000 to 14,000 men by 26 July. He then ignored the Scottish army at Stirling and on 31 July marched on the seat of the Scottish government at Perth, which he besieged. Perth surrendered after two days, cutting off the Scottish army from reinforcements, provisions and materiel. Cromwell deliberately left the route south clear, reckoning that if the Scots abandoned their defensive positions, then once in the open they could be destroyed. Charles II and Leslie, seeing no hope of victory if they stayed to face Cromwell, marched south on 31 July in a desperate bid to raise Royalist support in England. By this time they had only around 12,000 men, who were very short of firearms. Cromwell and Lambert followed, shadowing the Scottish army while leaving Lieutenant-general George Monck with 5,000 men in Scotland to mop up what resistance remained.

===Mopping up===

By the end of August, Monck had captured Stirling, Alyth, and St Andrews. Dundee and Aberdeen were the last major towns not under English control. The strength of Dundee&#x27;s fortifications meant many Scots had deposited money and valuables there, to keep them safe from the English. Monck drew up his full army outside the town on 26 August and demanded its surrender. The governor, believing the town walls and the local militia strong enough to withstand the English, refused. Infuriated at having to risk his men&#x27;s lives with an assault when the war was all but over, Monck gave permission for the town to be sacked once it was captured. After a three-day bombardment the English stormed the west and east ports on 1 September. They broke into the town and thoroughly sacked it; several hundred civilians, including women and children, were killed. Monck admitted to 500, but the total may have been as high as 1,000. Monck allowed the army 24 hours to pillage and a large amount of booty was seized. Subsequently, strict military discipline was enforced. Shortly afterwards Aberdeen, whose council saw no benefit in resisting an inevitable and costly defeat, surrendered promptly when a party of Monck&#x27;s cavalry arrived. The English army campaigned in the western Highlands to subdue the clans through early 1652, and three significant but isolated fortresses held out for a time. Brodick Castle surrendered on 6 April, and the Bass Rock fell a few days later. Dunnottar Castle, where the Honours of Scotland were being held, was the last major Scottish stronghold to surrender, on 24 May 1652, after the Honours had been smuggled out of the castle.

== Scottish invasion of England (1651) ==
The army which Leslie and Charles II led into England in August 1651, despite being 12,000 strong, was desperately short of supplies and equipment. The lack of muskets meant many men were equipped with bows. The Scots marched rapidly south and were outside Carlisle by 8 August. The town refused Charles II entry and the Scots marched further into England. Cromwell sent two forces, each of about 4,000 mounted men to harass the Scots and followed with his main force of 10,000 men. On 13 August the Parliamentarians attempted to hold the bridge at Warrington, but when the Scots attacked in force the English withdrew. Twenty-two days after leaving Stirling the Scottish army reached Worcester, having marched some . The exhausted Scots paused in Worcester and hoped Royalist recruits would join them from Wales, the Welsh Marches and the West Country, but few did.

Charles II had hopes of a major Royalist uprising, but very few Englishmen joined the army, partly because they found the prospect of a renewed monarchy bound by the Covenant unedifying. Little military support existed for Charles II and this was rapidly suppressed by the Parliamentarians. A force of 1,500 from the Isle of Man gathered in Lancashire under the Earl of Derby and attempted to join the Royalist army, but they were intercepted at Wigan on 25 August by Parliamentarian troops and defeated. The largest single English contingent to join the army was only 60 strong. The English Council of State called up all the troops it could. Large musters took place at Northampton, Gloucester, Reading and Barnet. The London trained bands assembled 14,000 strong on 25 August and Fairfax secured Yorkshire. Parliamentarian forces concentrated around the Scottish army, where by the end of August Cromwell had 31,000 men against the 12,000 in the Scottish army. .

===Battle of Worcester===

The English not only far outnumbered the Scots, but were better trained, better equipped, better supplied and cut the Scots&#x27; line of retreat. Worcester was a naturally strong defensive position and was well fortified, and so Cromwell moved his forces into position deliberately. On 3 September 1651 he attacked from the south. The Scots attempted a desperate counter attack, but Cromwell moved his reserves to reinforce the threatened sector and the Scots were beaten back. The Parliamentarians broke into Worcester and captured it after fierce house-to-house fighting. The historian Barry Coward wrote &quot;It was a divided enemy that Cromwell fought after Dunbar and decisively defeated at Worcester&quot;.

The defeated army lost more than 2,000 killed, and more than 6,000 Royalists were captured that day, nearly all Scots. The prisoners were either sent to work on drainage projects in the Fens or transported to North America to work as forced labour. Leslie, along with most of the Royalist commanders, was captured. Charles II managed to escape to the continent. In the aftermath of the battle, Worcester was looted by the Parliamentarian army. Around 3,000 Scottish cavalry escaped northwards; en route back to Scotland they were harried by the English and most were captured or killed.

==Aftermath==
The Battle of Worcester was the last significant pitched battle in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Before Worcester, the Commonwealth faced widespread international hostility evoked by the execution of Charles I. The victory strengthened their position, since it was clear the English people were willing to fight to defend the republic and capable of doing so effectively. The reliance of Charles II on a Scottish army in his attempts to regain the English crown had cost him support: Charles II realised he would need to win over the English if he wished to regain the throne. On arrival in France, he declared he would rather be hanged than ever to return to Scotland. The conquest of Scotland, and that of Ireland, won the Commonwealth respect among its continental neighbours: by early 1652 its legitimacy had been recognised by the French, Spanish, Dutch and Danes, and its navy had been able to assert its control over the Channel and Scilly Isles, as well as England&#x27;s possessions in Barbados and North America. The threat of imminent Royalist invasion had been nullified.

The defeated Scottish government was dissolved, and the English Parliament absorbed the kingdom of Scotland into the Commonwealth. Military rule was imposed, with 10,000 English troops garrisoned across the country to quell the threat of local uprisings. Negotiations between commissioners of the English Parliament and the deputies of Scotland&#x27;s shires and burghs began to formalise the incorporation of Scottish legal and political structures into the new British state. By 1653 two Scottish representatives were invited to take seats in the English Barebone&#x27;s Parliament.

After in-fighting between factions in Parliament and the army, Cromwell ruled over the Commonwealth as Lord Protector from December 1653 until his death in September 1658. On Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s death, his son Richard became Lord Protector, but the Army had little confidence in him. In May 1659, seven months after Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s death, the Army removed Richard and re-installed the Rump; military force shortly dissolved this as well. General George Monck, by then commander-in-chief of the English forces in Scotland, marched south with his army, crossing the Tweed on 2 January 1660 and entering London on 3 February, where he called new parliamentary elections. These resulted in the Convention Parliament which on 8 May 1660 declared that Charles II had reigned as the lawful monarch since the execution of Charles I. Charles II returned from exile and was crowned King of England on 23 April 1661, completing the Restoration.

<text>Dictamnus albus is a species of flowering plant in the family Rutaceae. It is also known as burning bush, dittany, gas plant or fraxinella. This herbaceous perennial has several geographical variants.
It is native to warm, open woodland habitats in southern Europe, north Africa and much of Asia.

==Description==
This plant grows about to high. Its flowers form a loose pyramidal spike and vary in colour from pale purple to white. The flowers are five-petalled with long projecting stamens. The leaves resemble those of an ash tree.

==Cultivation==
Several varieties and cultivars have been selected for garden use. The variety &quot;D. albus&quot; var. &quot;purpureus&quot; in which the violet-purple is confined to veining of white petals with a slight blush, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. &quot;Dictamnus&quot; is tap-rooted, making mature plants difficult to establish and resistant to division; young plants often need three years before they begin to flower, and since it is late to break into leaf in spring, even quite mature clumps may be harmed with vigorous soil-working in spring. For all these reasons, added to toxicity of the foliage, &quot;Dictamnus&quot; is rarely seen in American gardens.

==Toxicity==
The leaves have a bitter and unpalatable taste. Despite the lemon-like smell, the plant is acrid when eaten. All parts of the plant may cause mild stomach upset if eaten, and contact with the foliage may cause phytophotodermatitis.

==Volatile oils==
The name &quot;burning bush&quot; derives from the volatile oils produced by the plant, which can catch fire readily in hot weather, leading to comparisons with the burning bush of the Bible, including the suggestion that this is the plant involved there. The daughter of Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus is said to have ignited the air once, at the end of a particularly hot, windless summer day, above &quot;Dictamnus&quot; plants, using a simple matchstick. The volatile oils have a reputed component of isoprene.

==Chemistry==
More than 100 chemical constituents have been isolated from the genus &quot;Dictamnus&quot;, including alkaloids, limonoid triterpenoids, flavonoids, sesquiterpenoids, coumarins, and Phenylpropanoids.

<text>Vynohradiv (, ; ; ; ) is a city in western Ukraine, in Zakarpattia Oblast. It was the center of Vynohradiv Raion and since 2020 it has been incorporated into Berehove Raion. Population: 

==Names==

There are multiple alternative names used for this city due to its location and history: , , (Syvlyush), (Syvlyush), (Vinogradov), (Vinahradaŭ), (Seylesh, Selish), (Veľká Sevljuš during Czechoslovak rule), , (hist. Sewlusz).

==Geography==
===Location===
The city lies near the river Tisza on the border with Romania. It is from Berehove.

==History==
It was first mentioned in 1262 by the name &quot;Zceuleus&quot;. Its Hungarian name, Nagyszőlős (&quot;Great Vineyard&quot;), stems from the area being an important wine district. The city was called Sevlush (the Rusyn transliteration of the Hungarian word &quot;szőlős&quot;, meaning vineyard.

The town was one of the oldest in Ugocsa county, and was inhabited by winemakers of the royal court. In 1329, Hungarian King Charles Robert granted privileges to the town, which became the seat of the Comitatus (the city held this rank until the Treaty of Trianon was signed in 1920).

In 1717, most of the citizens of the town were killed by an invading Tatar horde. By 1880, the population was about 4,400 (with 500 native Romanians). In 1881 a secondary school was opened.

In 1910 it had a population of 7,811 (5,943 or 76% Hungarians, 1,266 or 16% Ruthenians (Rusyns) and 540 or 7% Germans). The religious make-up was 3,311 Greek Catholics (42.5%), 2,237 Jews (28.6%) and 1,124 Calvinists (14.4%).

This city had a Jewish ghetto in 1944. At its height from May to June 1944, most of the Jews of this section of northern Transylvania were deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp to be gassed shortly after arrival. Jews from the area typically spent about two weeks in the ghetto before being deported. Conditions were extremely cramped with many families housed in a single room, a deliberate arrangement meant to cause suffering and disease.

In 1944, Carpathian Ruthenia was occupied by Soviet Union and was formally incorporated into Ukrainian SSR in 1946. The city name became Vinogradovo (Russian), Vynohradiv (Ukrainian), or Vynohradovo (Rusyn). All mean &quot;Grape Town.&quot;

A local newspaper is published here since December 1945.

==Demographics==

According to the 2001 census, the population included:
*Ukrainians (82.13%)
*Hungarians (13.54%)
*Russians (3.82%)
*Roma (0.6%)

==Tourist sights==

*Ugocsa Castle &quot;Kankó&quot; (ruins; 13th century). It was first mentioned in 1308. In 1315 King Charles Robert attacked and destroyed it. In the 15th century the area was given to monks of the Franciscan order, they built a monastery there, which was inhabited until 1558. There is a small 14th century chapel south of the ruins.
*Perényi Castle. It was built by the Perényi noble family from 1399, later rebuilt in baroque style into a mansion.
*Franciscan church and monastery (built in 1744, rebuilt in 1889).

*Franciscan monastery (founded in the 15th century). In 1556 local Protestants attacked the monastery, killed the monks and threw the body of St. John Capistrano into a well. The Perényi family invited monks of the order to the town again, but the monastery burnt down in 1747. Its current building was erected in 1889.

Rai was born in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan Punjab, British India (now in Pakistan) in 1924. Following the partition of India he moved to Mumbai in 1947. He started off his career in the Hindi film industry as a distributor. In 1970, he started his production company &quot;Trimurti Films&quot; and the first film produced was Dev Anand starrer &quot;Johny Mera Naam&quot; (&quot;Johny is my name&quot;), directed by Vijay Anand which was a success.

In the 1970s, his Yash Chopra-directed films made Amitabh Bachchan a superstar and launched successful careers for script writers Salim–Javed. The notable films were &quot;Deewaar&quot; (&quot;The Wall&quot;) (1975) and &quot;Trishul&quot; (&quot;The Trident&quot;) (1978).

In the 1980s he produced Dilip Kumar starrer Vidhaata, directed by Subhash Ghai later he produced films in the action genre directed by his son Rajiv Rai. A majority of his films were notable for their music composed by Kalyanji-Anandji &amp; later by Viju Shah. They were Johny Mera Naam, Vidhaata, &quot;Tridev&quot; (&quot;The three gods&quot;), &quot;Vishwatma&quot;, &quot;Mohra&quot; (&quot;The Pawn&quot;) and &quot;Gupt&quot; (&quot;Secret&quot;).

<text>Carei (; , ; /, , ) is a city in Satu Mare County, northwestern Romania, near the border with Hungary. The city administers one village, Ianculești ().

==Geography==
The municipality of Carei is situated in the north-west of Romania, away from Oradea. Carei is situated in the south-western part of Satu-Mare County, in a plain region, and it is away from the county seat, Satu-Mare. Communes that are near Carei include Căpleni, Urziceni, Foieni, Sanislău, Petrești, Tiream, Căuaș, and Moftin.

== History ==

The first mention of the city under the name of &quot;Karul&quot; dates from 1320, and as &quot;Károly&quot; in 1325, however, the city is known to have existed since 1264, as it was the domain of the Kaplony clan and the center of the Károlyi family&#x27;s personal domain that settled in the region shortly after the arrival of the Hungarians. The name of the city comes from the word &quot;karul&quot; (in modern Hungarian &quot;karvaly&quot;). The etymology of the word can be traced back to the ancient Turkish language, the word meaning sparrow. Another theory is that the city was named after the Károlyi family. 

King Louis I of Hungary permitted the organization of weekly market gatherings on Saturdays in Carei in 1346, as a result of the military achievements of the Károlyi family. The development of regional trade in the region stimulated the development of the town, and in 1387, King Sigismund elevates the town to county center, while also granting it independent jurisdiction.

In 1482, Ladislaus Károlyi, with the permission of King Matthias, begins the construction of a stone residence. Over the course of the following decades, due to fears of an Ottoman attack, the residence will gradually get transformed into a fortification outfitted with a moat, four corner bastions and shooting niches for cannons.

After the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the town falls under the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom, a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, and in the ensuing struggle between the Habsburg Ferdinand I and John Zápolya for the crown of Hungary, the Karolyi family initially sides with Zápolya, and Ferdinand confiscates their holdings in 1558, however, he reinstates them to power later. By 1554, the city was converted to Protestantism, and by 1567 it adhered to the Calvinist faith. In 1590, a synod takes place in the city, protesting the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in Hungary. Additional synods take place in 1591 and 1594, and the city is the birthplace of Gáspár Károli, who is the first person to translate the Bible into Hungarian in 1586.

In 1592, the baron, Mihály Károlyi, further expands the fortifications of the city, these being made out of predominantly dirt. However, after an Ottoman response, the city is forced to keep paying tribute. Thanks to its strategic position, the city becomes part of a series of fortifications built against the Ottomans, and to be able of repelling the eventual attacks, the fortifications are enlarged again between 1661 and 1666, as well as a German garrison with artillery being assigned. However, after a series of attacks, the city is burned and suffers grave damage, but is eventually rebuilt by the year 1678.

The city will once again come under fire during Francis II Rákóczi&#x27;s uprising, and the city will be depopulated and left impoverished. The city will have a resurgence after Treaty of Szatmár is signed and the Károlyi family is elevated to the status of counts. Count Alexander Karolyi, shortly after the war, begins colonizing the region with Swabians, inviting 124 families from Württemberg. Eventually Slovaks, Jews, and Rusyns also get settled in the regions. The colonization efforts become more significant during Francis Károlyi tenure, an additional 132 families are settled in 1762, with the total number reaching an estimated 466 Swabian families, forming two districts in the town. Effects on cultural and social life began to show: in 1727 the Piarist Gymnasium was established, in 1754 the first typography was built, and in 1756 a pharmacy was opened.

In 1780, the city became the seat of Szatmár County, and in 1828 the population reached 11,000. The town was hit by an earthquake in 1834, and the majority of the city was destroyed the next year during a great fire, which destroyed 350 houses. The city was hit by a similar great fire on 6 May 1887, causing similar damage to the fire from 1835. The rebuilding of the houses and the organizing of the streets were done according to the planning regulations adopted by the town&#x27;s council, and they still define the physiognomy of the city&#x27;s center today. In 1871, the railway connecting Carei to Satu Mare and Debrecen was opened, and it was further expanded in 1887 with the line Tășnad-Sărmășag-Zalău, and in 1905 the railway towards Mátészalka was built. Over the course of the 19th century, the colonized families started adopting the Hungarian language but kept their religion, differentiating them from the reformed majority of the county.

In 1845, with help from count György Károlyi, a hospital was built and opened. With the new railway built in 1887, the light industry and the food industry in the city started blooming, and a new paper mill was also built. Between the years 1893 and 1896, at the behest of count Stephen Károlyi, the castle underwent change once more, according to the plans of the architect Arthur Meinig, and it reached its current form. In 1904, electricity was introduced in the city, and until 1914, multiple elementary and general schools were opened, the most renowned being the Piarist school, today known as Școală Gimnazială Vasile Lucaciu (the Vasile Lucaciu school). In 1910, the train station was built, and it still exists today.
After the collapse of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, and the declaration of the Union of Transylvania with Romania, the Romanian Army took control of Carei on 19 April 1919, during the Hungarian–Romanian War. The city officially became part of the territory ceded to the Kingdom of Romania in June 1920 under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon. In August 1940, under the auspices of Nazi Germany, which imposed the Second Vienna Award, Hungary retook the territory of Northern Transylvania (which included Carei) from Romania. Towards the end of World War II, however, the city was taken back from Hungarian and German troops by Romanian and Soviet forces on 25 October 1944, during the Battle of Carei. In memory of this battle, the &quot;Monument of the Romanian Soldier&quot; was erected in the center of Carei; inaugurated in 1964, it is the work of the sculptor Gheza Vida. 25 October has been celebrated since 1959 as the Day of the Romanian Armed Forces.

Although between 1760 and 1920 the town was the seat of Szatmár County, the industrial development was not significant and it basically preserved its agricultural specificity until about 1960. In 1926 Carei was attached to Sălaj County. After 1950, Carei was included in the Baia Mare Region, while after 1968, along with the administrative-territorial reorganization of the country, it returned to Satu Mare County.

Until World War II, the industry of the town consisted of mills, the oil factory &quot;Ardealul&quot;, a station for collecting and fermenting tobacco, and some small workshops. During the Communist period, Carei gradually turned into an industrial town.

The most important historical building in the city is the Károlyi Castle.

The theater was first named after the writer , until the 1920s, when it was renamed Teatrul Carmen Sylva. After 1945 it was renamed again, to Teatrul Popular. In 1953, the theater received a complete overhaul and it was &quot;modernized&quot; both inside and outside.

The monument was built with white stone and has impressive dimensions, with a frontal opening of , a depth of , and a height of . The monument has the following inscription: &quot;Glory to the soldiers of the Romanian Army, fallen in the struggles for the liberation of the homeland&quot;.

===The Train Station===
The first train station was built in 1871, when the Debrecen–Satu Mare railway was built. The Carei–Zalău railway was inaugurated on 23 December 1887. The building of today&#x27;s train station was built between 1910 and 1912. During World War II the train station was heavily bombarded, but the damage it suffered was rapidly repaired.

<text>Sir Sacheverell Reresby Sitwell, 6th Baronet, (; 15 November 1897 – 1 October 1988) was an English writer, particularly on baroque architecture, and an art and music critic. Sitwell produced some 50 volumes of poetry and some 50 works on art, music, architecture, and travel.

==Early life==

Sitwell was born in Scarborough, North Yorkshire on 15 November 1897 and brought up in Derbyshire. He was the youngest child of Sir George Sitwell, 4th Baronet, of Renishaw Hall, and the former Lady Ida Emily Augusta Denison. Dame Edith Sitwell and Sir Osbert Sitwell were his older siblings.

His paternal grandparents were Sir Sitwell Sitwell, 3rd Baronet and his wife Louisa Lucy Hutchinson (daughter of the Hon. Henry Hely Hutchinson). His maternal grandparents were William Denison, 1st Earl of Londesborough and Lady Edith Somerset (a daughter of the 7th Duke of Beaufort), who claimed descent through female lines from the Plantagenets. 

Sitwell was educated at Eton College. In World War I he served from 1916 in the British Army, in the Grenadier Guards. After the war he went to Balliol College, Oxford but did not complete a degree, and was heavily involved in Osbert and Edith&#x27;s projects. 

==Career==
Sitwell&#x27;s poetry collection &quot;A Hundred and One Harlequins&quot; attracted some attention in 1922, but the first works to gain more widespread notice and acclaim were three prose studies of painting, architecture and music: &quot;Southern Baroque Art&quot; (1924), &quot;German Baroque Art&quot; (1927) and &quot;Spanish Baroque Art&quot; (1931). Cyril Connolly called &quot;Southern Baroque Art&quot; &quot;a milestone in the development of our modern sensibility&quot;. A series of books on music and musicians - including &quot;Mozart&quot; (1932), &quot;Liszt&quot; (1934) and shorter essays on Scarlatti, Offenbach and Tchaikovsky (&quot;Valse des Fleurs&quot;, 1941) - were also highly influential. 

&quot;The Dance of the Quick and the Dead&quot; (1936) established a new strand of his work, evoking &quot;outcast and vagabond societies; their music, their dress, their customs and rituals&quot;. This was the first of a series of lengthy autobiographical, travel and art-based &quot;fantasias&quot; that are among his most original works. Later examples include &quot;The Hunters and the Hunted&quot; (1947) and &quot;For Want of the Golden City&quot; (1973). Although most often associated with exotic art, culture and foreign travel, Sitwell also established himself as a connoisseur of English art and architecture, with the publication of &quot;British Arts and Craftsmen&quot; (1945), concluded by his final publication, the anthology &quot;Sacheverell Sitwell&#x27;s England&quot; (1986). 

&quot;Poltergeists&quot; (1940) reviewed poltergeist cases over the centuries. Sitwell concluded that many, though not all, cases could be explained by human trickery (conscious or unconscious) and hysteria. &quot;Journey to the Ends of Time&quot; (1959), was &quot;a kaleidoscopic series of meditations on death and the possibility of survival&quot;.

As his poetry was so severely criticised, particularly by those who disliked the Sitwells in general, and although &quot;Canons of Giant Art&quot; (1933, including the highly praised poem &#x27;Agamemnon&#x27;s Tomb&#x27;) was a work of considerable impact, he refused to publish any of his poems for many years. Constant Lambert&#x27;s setting of his early poem &quot;The Rio Grande&quot; for chorus and orchestra (taken from &quot;The Thirteenth Caesar, and other Poems, 1924&quot;) was first performed and broadcast in 1928 and has retained its popularity. In 1967 Derek Parker published a selection of his poems in the summer edition of &quot;Poetry Review&quot;, including &#x27;Serenade to a Sister&#x27;, an elegy for his sister Edith. &quot;An Indian Summer&quot; (1982), with a preface by Peter Quennell, collecting together 100 of his best most recent poems, was his final volume of poetry.

===Later life===
Sitwell was an early member of the New Party, a group established in 1931 by Oswald Mosley and containing former members of the major British political parties.

In his later life he withdrew from the publicity that attached to the Sitwells collectively, instead preferring to travel and concentrate on writing. He succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his elder brother Osbert in 1969. He was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in 1984. His main residence was Weston Hall, Northamptonshire, the family home and he served as High Sheriff of Northamptonshire for 1948.

==Personal life==

On 12 October 1925 Sitwell married Georgia Doble, the daughter of Arthur Richard Doble, a wealthy Canadian banker. They had two sons:

* Sir Sacheverell Reresby Sitwell, 7th Baronet (1927–2009), who married to Penelope Forbes, the daughter of Col. Hon. Donald Alexander Forbes (brother of the the 8th Earl of Granard) and Mary Doreen Lawson (a daughter of Andrew Sherlock Lawson and granddaughter of the 14th Viscount Mountgarret), in 1952.
* Francis Trajan Sacheverell Sitwell (1935–2004), father of Sir George Sitwell, 8th Baronet. He was also a member of White&#x27;s and St James&#x27;s clubs.

Georgia Doble had difficulty adapting to married existence and missed the social life in London. Despite affairs on both sides, they remained deeply attached to each other until the end and never officially separated. The personal correspondence of Doble, preserved at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas, include letters with David Stuart Horner and Frank Magro, Osbert Sitwell&#x27;s partners, and friends like Lawrence Audrain, John Lehmann, Loelia Lindsay, René Massigli, Evelyn Waugh, and Mae West.

Sitwell died in October 1988 at the age of 90. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his elder son Reresby.

<text>Józef Dąbrowski (January 27, 1842 – February 15, 1903) was a Polish Catholic priest. He founded the SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary in 1887 and was the first rector there. 

== Early life and ordination ==
Józef Dąbrowski was born in Zoltance, Poland at a time when it was held by Russia. He was born into a family of minor gentry and studied at the Lublin &quot;gimnazjum&quot;, then the University of Warsaw. He participated in the Polish January Uprising of 1863, and fled to Dresden in 1864, then to Lucerne and Berne where he continued his studies in mathematics. He then went to Rome and came under the direction of well-known Resurrectionist priest Father Peter Semenenko. He was ordained a priest in Rome on August 1, 1869.

== Pastoral work in America ==
In 1870, Dąbrowski was appointed pastor of Polonia, Wisconsin and moved there to do pastoral work among Polish Americans. In a letter from St. Francis Seminary to Father Semenenko dated 22 January 1870, he expressed concern about demoralized conditions among the Poles in the United States.

Dąbrowski was gifted 20 acres (81,000 m²) of land by an Irishman for the erection of new parish buildings. In 1879 the rectory was destroyed by fire. The following year fire destroyed the new rectory and the church. Father Dąbrowski rebuilt the buildings. 

==Schools==
In 1874 he introduced the Felician Sisters from Kraków into the United States to open and run a school for Polish immigrants. Their community multiplied throughout the country, welcoming the immigrants, teaching thousands of Polish children, and caring for a multitude of Polish orphans and working girls. They were to staff more than 40% of all Polish parochial schools in the United States by the mid-twentieth century.

He published several school textbooks including Calendar (Kalendarz), Polish Readings (Czytanki Polskie), Arithmetic (Arytmetyka), Polish Geography (Geografia Polska), Gardening (Ogrodnictwo). In 1891 he started publishing the illustrated weekly newspaper Sunday (Niedziela), which ran until 1907.

Father Dąbrowski also worked with the indigenous peoples in Wisconsin. He learned their language and published an Indian-Polish dictionary for the Felician sisters. He worked to convert them to Christianity and there are records of native baptisms in parish registers.

Dąbrowski urged the Resurrectionists to come to Chicago or Milwaukee and establish schools of higher education where they might send out missionaries to the scattered Poles.

== SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary ==
Dąbrowski founded the SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary in Detroit (1887), 
becoming its first rector.

In 1882 failing health forced him to resign his post in Wisconsin and leave for Detroit, Michigan. 

At that time Cardinal Ledóchowski was unable to meet the appeals of American bishops for Polish priests and ecclesiastical students. At his request, Father Leopold Moczygemba, a Franciscan who had worked in America and was then at St. Peter&#x27;s, Rome, went, with papal approval, to America and collected funds ($8000) for a Polish seminary.

Father Moczygemba felt unable to complete the work and entrusted the task to Father Dąbrowski, who began building the seminary in 1884. On 24 July 1885, Bishop Stephen V. Ryan of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo blessed the cornerstone in the presence of Bishop Borgess of Detroit.

The seminary was opened in 1887, and for nineteen years Father Dąbrowski served as its rector. In 1902 it was enlarged, and in 1909 it moved to Orchard Lake, Michigan.

== Death ==
A few days before his death, Father Dąbrowski expelled 29 students from the seminary for open rebellion. On 9 Feb., 1903, he suffered a paralytic stroke. He died at Detroit, February 15, 1903.

<text>Lough Mask () is a limestone lake of about in Counties Mayo and Galway, Ireland, north of Lough Corrib. Lough Mask is the middle of the three lakes, which empty into the Corrib River, through Galway, into Galway Bay. Lough Carra flows into Lough Mask, which discharges through the Cong Canal and underground passages in the limestone bedrock of the district. The flows from the underground passages and the Cong Canal come together at the village of Cong to form the River Cong which flows into Lough Corrib.

Lough Mask is the fourth largest lake, by area, in Ireland and the sixth largest lake in the island of Ireland. The eastern half of Lough Mask is shallow and contains many islands. The other half (Upper Lough Mask) is much deeper, sinking to a long trench with depths in excess of 50 metres.
Lough Mask has a mean depth of , and a maximum depth of . Its water volume of is the largest in the Republic of Ireland and the second largest on the island of Ireland (after Lough Neagh).

==History==
In 1338 Sir Edmond de Burgh was drowned in the lake by his cousin Sir Edmond Albanach Bourke of County Mayo, at the end of the Burke Civil War (1333–1338). He was captured at Ballinrobe and taken to Oilean-an-lara (the Earls Island) where he was killed.

According to a side-note on the manuscript containing the oldest copy of &#x27;Tóruigheacht Dhiarmada agus Ghráinne&#x27; (&quot;The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne&quot;) (Royal Irish Academy Ms. 24.P.9), Irish scribe Dáibhídh Bacach (&quot;lame David&quot;) Ó Duibhgeannáin was living and working on &quot;Oileán Ruadh&quot; (&#x27;Red Island&#x27;) on Lough Mask in the house of Tadhg Og O Flaherty on 1 April 1651.

The &quot;Lough Mask Murders&quot; of 1882 were a notorious incident in the Land War in which a grandfather and grandson acting as bailiffs were killed by tenant farmers and their bodies dumped in the lake.

==Legend==
According to local legend, a banshee haunts Bly Island, a small island in the lough. There have also been rumored sightings of a banshee around the shore of the lough as well as other forms of paranormal activity.

==Fishing and recreation==
The lake is popular for its trout fishing. The World Cup Trout Fly Fishing Championship takes place annually on Lough Mask at Cushlough Bay near Ballinrobe.

Petersburg Outdoor Education Center is situated on the shore of the lough, close to Bly Island. The center uses the lake for numerous water sports including kayaking, canoeing and sailing.

==Other==
&quot;Loch Measca&quot; was taken as the pen-name of Séan Seoighe (John Joyce) in &quot;Eachtra múinteóra&quot; an Irish-language memoir published in 1929.

<text>Zalău (, unofficial and former official name: (; or , , ) is the seat of Sălaj County, Romania. In 2021, its estimated population was 52,359.

==History==

===Ancient times===
Zalău is situated in the area inhabited by &quot;Free Dacians&quot;, away from the historical landmark of Porolissum, a well-preserved Roman Castrum with an imposing fortress, an amphitheater, temples, houses and a customs house in the ancient Roman province of Dacia. Zalău was the crossing point between Central Europe and Transylvania, along the so-called &quot;Salt Route&quot;. 

Archaeological discoveries revealed evidence of human existence in this area since the Neolithic, approx. 6500 years ago. Dacian coins found in archaeological perimeters of the city central area and on the Valea Mâții, west of the city, plus important items belonging to Roman culture, are evidence of free Dacian continuity in this area and of developing economic relations with the Roman ancient city of Porolissum.

After the conquest of Dacia by Trajan (106), the Roman Empire border stood atop the Meseș Mountains, just away from the city. Just north from the border, on the actual Zalău city area were the free Dacians tribes, and to the east, south-east (of Meseș Mountains) were Roman border fortifications, towers, walls, ditches and defense sides.





===Middle Ages===
The first written mention about Zalău, was in the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, also called the &quot;Chronicle of Anonymous&quot; (probably notary of the King Béla III of Hungary), published around year 1200. According to this source, Zalău settlement would have been there as early as around 900. Later, Zalău is referred to as &quot;Villa Ziloc&quot; in 1220, &quot;Zylac&quot; in 1246, &quot;Zylah&quot; in 1282, &quot;Zyloh&quot; and &quot;oppidum Zylah&quot; in 1318, &quot;Zila&quot; in 1601, &quot;Zilahu&quot; in 1808, &quot;Sziláj&quot; / &quot;Szilágyi&quot; in 1839, &quot;Szilaju&quot; in 1850, and &quot;Zalău&quot; / &quot;Sziláju&quot; / &quot;Walthenberg&quot; in 1854. After the great Mongol invasion, which destroyed the city in 1241, Zalău came in 1246 under the administration of the Catholic Bishopric of Nagyvárad. The trusteeship was maintained until 1542, when Zalău became part of Principality of Transylvania.

On 1 August 1473, Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary and Bohemia, acknowledged Zalău as a market town for the first time (called &quot;oppidum Zilah&quot; – Zilah fort), a privilege that freed the city from the county domination, granted its citizens the right of free trade and gave it a larger degree of economic autonomy. At the end of the 16th century, the city had an independent administrative leadership, composed of 33 elected senators (one of whom was the mayor), a notary, a registrar and a treasurer.

Other important events in the development of the city occurred in 1571 during the reign of Prince Istvan Bathory and in 1600 under the reign of Michael the Brave. After Transylvania had been annexed to the Habsburg Empire, the city experienced an economic decline due to the infusion of products from Western Europe. After Michael the Brave&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Guruslău on 3 August 1601, Zalău received administrative, legislative, fiscal and military own rules, which provided real autonomy freedoms to citizens. A chronicle from the 17th century, first mentioned the main crafts of city residents: belt-makers, potters, wheelwrights, shoemakers, butchers, tailors, blacksmiths, carpenters, hat makers and armorers.

The city was under the rule Principality of Transylvania between 1526 and 1660. It was also controlled by the Ottomans between 1660 and 1692, the city being part of Varat Eyalet. The Calvinist college was formed in the first half of the 17th century.

On 9 November 1714, Charles XII of Sweden rested for a night in a building on &quot;Király&quot; street (now named after Corneliu Coposu) with an acquaintance György Zoványi as is indicated by a notice still on the house. Until the administrative reform of 1876, the city was the seat of Közép-Szolnok County for centuries.

===Modern times===

Zalău is one of the most important urban centers in the region. It had a Reformed college (Wesselényi College), a township school for civil service (for boys only), and a national civil school (for girls only). It had the largest hospital in the region and a tax revenue office.

In 1850, it held a population of 4,294 and, in 1910–8,062 (7,477 Hungarians, 19 Germans, 529 Romanians and 23 belonging to other ethnic groups). By religion, there were 1,333 Roman Catholics, 873 Greek Catholics, 5,363 members of the Reformed Church, and 415 Jews. The city had 1,427 households, and most of its inhabitants were employed by the manufacturing industry. The Reformed Church was built in 1246. It is one of the city&#x27;s oldest buildings and one of the largest in Eastern Europe.

In 1876, Zalău became the seat of the Szilágy County. After the proclamation of the Union of Transylvania with Romania (1 December 1918), by the Treaty of Trianon Zalău has been part of Romania – except between 1940 until the end of World War II, when Northern Transylvania became part of Hungary as a result of the Second Vienna Award. On 8 September 1940, upon arrival in Zalău, the Hungarian Army killed 10 people just outside the city; in the following days, the Nușfalău, Treznea, and Ip massacres were perpetrated in nearby villages.

Between 1892 and 1896, one of the most famous Hungarian poets Endre Ady attended the Protestant school in Zalău (since 1957, there has been a statue of Endre Ady in front of the school). The poet also published his first poem in the local newspaper &quot;Szilágy&quot; on 22 March 1896. A memorial plaque on the frontage of the building where he lived reminiscents of Ady Endre&#x27;s time spent there.

At the end of the 19th century, Lajos Szikszai donated his private collection to the municipality and the first museum in Zalău was created. An exhibition was also organized in 1926, but the Zalău County Museum was officially inaugurated in 1951. On 9 July 1981, a new section of the Zalău County Museum was inaugurated and was named the &quot;Ioan Sima&quot; Arts Gallery.

The Battle of Zalău took place in 1919, during the Hungarian–Romanian War.

The Central Library, owning 7,000 Romanian and Hungarian books, was opened on the 23 August 1950. In 1952 it became the Raion Library, coordinating all the Zalău Raion libraries. In 1957 it took the name of Ioniță Scipione Bădescu. It became the County Library with the administrative reform of February 1968.

As of the end of the 1960s, the city became a regional industrial center for the first time, which was heavily impacted by the Systematization process. Industrial factories like Armătura Zalău, Silcotub Zalău, and Anvelope Silvania (recently bought by Michelin) hired thousands of workers, which sparked an increase in population as a result. The population influx gradually led to changes in the ethnic structure with the Romanians being now the majority and the Hungarians reduced to a minority. However, in many of the surrounding communes, the ethnic structure still remained unchanged (for example Vârșolț) are still populated by Hungarians; on the other hand, nearby villages such as Marin have a 100% ethnic Romanian population, basically unchanged for more than a century. In the 1970s with the working-class population expanding, housing estates of high-rise blocks of flats were built in both the centre and the outskirts of the town.

In 2007, due to the negligence of the local natural gas distributor, a gas accumulation produced an explosion that led to casualties and significant material damage.

Today Zalău is crossed by European road E81 and the national road DN1F. A new motorway (the Transylvania Highway) is being built to connect Zalău to Western Europe. The town has two nationally accredited University colleges, a public library, one museum, an art gallery, more than four hotels, a motel, and two student halls of residence.

== Geography ==

<text>InFocus Corporation is a privately owned American company based in the state of Oregon. Founded in 1986, the company develops, manufactures, and distributes DLP and LCD projectors and accessories as well as large-format touch displays, software, LED televisions, tablets and smartphones. InFocus also offers video calling services. Formerly a NASDAQ listed public company, InFocus was purchased by Image Holdings Corp., owned by John Hui, in 2009 and is now a wholly owned subsidiary headquartered in Tigard, Oregon.

==History==
InFocus was formed by Steve Hix and Paul Gulick in 1986. It is one of three companies in the computer display industry started by people who formerly worked for Tektronix along with Planar Systems and Clarity Visual Systems. The company moved into a new headquarters building in Wilsonville, Oregon, in 2002. At that time the company employed 1,200 people.

In mid-2005 InFocus acquired the company TUN (The University Network), which provided digital media and thin screen television advertising to colleges, and then sold it in late 2006 to Submedia LLC. The company later became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ exchange as INFS. On May 28, 2009, InFocus was taken private by Image Holdings Corporation and John Hui in a transaction valued at $39 million. In October 2009, they announced plans to move to Tigard, Oregon in December 2009 as their old headquarters were too big for the much smaller new company. The company was down to 110 employees at the time of the move, with just over half at the headquarters. As of 2012, the company had further shrunk to 90 employees and revenues of about $150 million. As of 2014, the company employed 120 people and is one of Oregon&#x27;s 25 largest homegrown technology companies. In September 2015 InFocus named long-time board member, Mark Housely CEO.

<doc id="1060546" wikidata="Q2609860" url="?curid=1060546" title="Early thermal weapons">
<text>Early thermal weapons, which used heat or burning action to destroy or damage enemy personnel, fortifications or territories, were employed in warfare during the classical and medieval periods (approximately the 8th century BC until the mid-16th century AD).

Incendiary devices were frequently used as projectiles during warfare, particularly during sieges and naval battles: some substances were boiled or heated to inflict damage by scalding or burning; other substances relied on their chemical properties to inflict burns or damage. These weapons or devices could be used by individuals, thrown by siege engines, or utilised as army strategy. Incendiary mixtures, such as the petroleum-based Greek fire, could be launched by throwing machines or administered through a siphon. Sulfur- and oil-soaked materials were sometimes ignited and thrown at the enemy, or attached to spears, arrow and bolts and fired by hand or machine.

The simplest and most common thermal projectiles were boiling water and hot sand, which could be poured over attacking personnel. Other anti-personnel weapons included the use of hot pitch, oil, resin, animal fat and other similar compounds. Smoke was used to confuse or drive off attackers. Substances such as quicklime and sulfur could be toxic and blinding.

Fire and incendiary weapons were also used against enemy structures and territory, sometimes on a massive scale. Large tracts of land, towns and villages were frequently ignited as part of a scorched earth strategy. Some siege techniques—such as mining and boring—relied on combustibles and fire to complete the collapse of walls and structures.

Towards the latter part of the period, gunpowder was invented, which increased the sophistication of the weapons, starting with fire lances, which led to the eventual development of the cannon and other firearms. Development of the early weapons has continued ever since, with modern war weapons such as napalm, flame throwers, and other explosives having direct roots in the original early thermal weapons. Fire-raising and other destructive strategies can still be seen in modern strategic bombing.

==&quot;Fire and sword&quot;==
The destruction of enemy possessions and territory was a fundamental strategy of war, serving the dual purpose of punishment and deprivation of resources. Until the 5th century BC, the Greeks had little expertise in siege warfare and relied on a strategy of devastation to draw the enemy out; they destroyed crops, trees and houses. Centuries later, the Byzantines recommended this strategy, even though they had developed siege technology.

Fire was the easiest way of harrying and destroying territories, and could be done easily and quickly by small forces. It was a strategy put to good use by the Scots during the Wars of Independence; they repeatedly launched raids into northern England, burning much of the countryside until the whole region was transformed. King Edward II of England pursued one raiding party in 1327 by following the lights of burning villages.
The tactics were replicated by England during the Hundred Years&#x27; War; fire became their chief weapon as they laid waste to the French countryside during lightning raids called chevauchées, in a form of economic warfare. One estimate records the destruction of over 2000 villages and castles during one raid in 1339.

As well as causing the destruction of lands, food and belongings, fire could also be used to divert manpower. 13th century Mongol armies regularly sent out small detachments from their main forces to start grass fires and fire settlements as diversions.

Devastation by fire was not only used as an offensive tactic; some countries and armies employed &quot;scorched earth&quot; policies on their own land to deprive invading armies of all food and forage. Robert I of Scotland reacted to the English invasion of 1322 by launching punitive and diversionary chevauchées into north-west England, then retreating to Culross, burning as he went the Scottish lands which lay in the path of the English army. The English ran out of food and had to abandon the campaign.

Such acts of aggression were not limited to wars against territorial enemies, but could form part of the strategies of conquest, subjugation and punishment of rebellion. Alexander the Great suppressed a revolt in Thebes, Greece in 335 BC, after which he ordered the city to be torched and laid waste. Alexander ordered (or allowed) a similar arson at Persepolis in 330 BC. It was a policy which was repeated throughout the period. William I of England, following his conquest of England in the 11th century, asserted his control of Northumbria by destructive campaigns throughout the region: &quot;He ordered that crops and herds, tools and food should be burned to ashes. More than 100,000 people perished of hunger&quot;, reported Orderic Vitalis, a contemporary chronicler. It was a scene repeated the following century, during the The Anarchy of Stephen of England&#x27;s reign. Civil war erupted between Stephen&#x27;s supporters and those of the Empress Matilda, a rival claimant for the throne. The &quot;Gesta Stephani&quot; tells of the deeds of one of Stephen&#x27;s supporters, Philip of Gloucester, by describing how he &quot;raged in all directions with fire and sword, violence and plunder&quot;, reducing territory to &quot;bare fields and dreadful desert&quot;.

==Techniques of use==
At the simplest level, fire itself was used as a weapon to cause large-scale destruction, or to target specific enemy positions or machinery. It was frequently used against siege engines and wooden structures. Incendiary weapons could be used to set fire to towns and fortifications, and a wide range of thermal weapons were used against enemy personnel. Some armies developed specialised &quot;fire-troops&quot;. By 837, many Muslim armies had groups of &quot;naffatin&quot; (fire archers), and when the Mamluk Sultanate raised a fleet for an attack on Cyprus (1425) they had &quot;nafata&quot;, or firetroops.

===Simple fire-raising===
The burning of enemy positions and equipment was not necessarily a complicated procedure, and many fires were set by individuals using common materials. When William of Normandy&#x27;s army besieged Mayenne in 1063, they shot fire into the castle to panic the garrison, while two boys stole into the castle in order to start a fire within. The garrison surrendered.

Besieged forces would sometimes launch sorties in an attempt to fire the attackers&#x27; camps or equipment. When Hugh Capet besieged Laon in 986–987, his troops became drunk one night, and Duke Charles&#x27;s men sallied forth and torched the camp, forcing Hugh to abandon the siege.

The besieged were not the only ones who might fire siege equipment; when Frederick I Barbarossa abandoned his siege of Alessandria in 1175, he burned his own camp and equipment.

However, like all weapons, fire-raising had its own dangers. In 651 Penda of Mercia attempted to win Bamburgh Castle by building a pyre at its base from planks, beams, wattle and thatch. The wind changed direction and the fire blew back on Penda&#x27;s men, who had to abandon the attack. This fortuitous wind-change was credited to Saint Aidan, who saw the smoke from the Farne Islands and prayed for the defenders.

===Throwing machines===
Various throwing machines were in use throughout the classical and medieval periods. Generally referred to as &quot;artillery&quot;, these engines could hurl, fire or shoot missiles and most could be used or adapted for throwing thermal weapons, by attacking and defending forces. Barrels, fire pots and other breakable containers of pitch, Greek fire, and other incendiary mixtures could be thrown; other machines fired arrows and bolts, which could be ignited, or adapted to carry flammable mixtures. From the 12th century, Muslims in Syria were using clay and glass grenades for fire weapons, thrown by machines.

Most of the terms used for throwing machines were vague, and could refer to different engines, all of which went through changes and developments over the period. Among the most common were the ballista, mangonel and trebuchet. The ballista was similar in form to a crossbow, though much larger, and used a string-winding mechanism to fire a missile or bolt placed in a groove. Other giant crossbows were used throughout the period, and an &quot;espringal&quot;, based on the ballista, which threw large bolts, was developed in the 13th century. Torsion-powered arrow firers had been used from 400 BC, and were adapted for stones. A mangonel had a wooden spoon-shaped arm, to hold a stone or other projectile, which was manipulated under tension from a twisted rope. The trebuchet was an advanced development of the 12th or 13th century, which used a counter-weight to power the throwing arm, and was the major siege engine until the cannon became widespread.

===In mining===

Forces attacking a castle or other strong fortification sometimes sought to undermine the foundations by digging &quot;mines&quot; or tunnels underneath them. Usually, such mining or digging machinery was protected by a &quot;tortoise&quot; (also called a &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;sow&quot;, or &quot;owl&quot;): a covered shed on wheels, which shielded the miners from missile attack.

As the tunnels were constructed, they were generally supported by wooden beams and posts. Once the mine had been finished, the internal space was filled with combustibles, such as brushwood, firewood, resin, and other incendiary substances; once ignited, these would burn the supporting props, causing the mine to collapse, bringing down with it the structures lying above. From the 15th century, gunpowder was also used, although the aim remained to burn the props.

Defenders might sometimes dig counter-tunnels in order to reach the enemy&#x27;s mines and launch an attack; frequently thermal weapons were used to drive the besiegers from the tunnels.

Rather than undermining a structure, some besiegers used borers to drill holes in the outer walls in an effort to destroy them; such methods were more effective than rams on brick walls (which tended to absorb the shocks from the ram). Borers differed in size and mechanism, but a typical machine was made from a log of wood, tipped with iron and supported and driven by windlasses or ropes. Once a series of holes had been bored along the length of a wall, the holes were typically filled with rods of dry wood, saturated with sulfur or pitch and then ignited. Bellows could be used to encourage a blaze.

===Fire ships===
Fire ships were used on several occasions throughout the period. In 332 BC Alexander the Great laid siege to Tyre, a coastal base of the Phoenicians. In order to bring his siege engines within range, Alexander ordered the construction of moles. The Tyrians responded by attacking the first mole with a large fireship, which destroyed it. A large horse transport ship was packed with cedar torches, pitch, dried brush and other combustibles; above this were suspended cauldrons of sulfur, bitumen and &quot;every sort of material apt to kindle and nourish flame&quot;. This was towed to the mole, and lit by the Phoenicians before they jumped overboard and swam away.

Another example occurred during the 886 Siege of Paris, when the Vikings filled three warships with combustible material and pulled them upriver in a failed attempt to destroy the Franks&#x27; fortified bridges. Fire ships containing straw and powder were also used during the Chinese Battle of Lake Poyang in 1363.

===Other methods===
Often ingenious methods were developed for administering the weapons. The 10th-century Olga of Kiev is reported to have tied burning tinder to birds which, when released, flew back to their nests in the hostile town and set them alight.
Siege towers and ladders could be fitted with a long, narrow tilting beam at the top, gouged with a groove, so that hot oil and water could be poured down on the enemy defenders during an escalade.
During an attack, castle or fortification defenders could launch or pour the substances on the heads of attackers below. This could be done over the battlements, but also through purpose-built holes such as machicolations and murder-holes. Indian records suggest smoke and fire was used defensively within a fortress to confuse and disorient attackers; iron grills could also be heated and used to block passageways. During night attacks, defenders could drop lighted bundles over the walls so the enemy could be seen; Chinese and Muslim sources also describe the light gained by torches hung on the walls.

===Use against stone castles===
Stone castles were susceptible to fire, since they contained many combustible materials. In 1139, Henry de Tracy forced the surrender of Torrington Castle by the simple expedient of tossing lighted torches through the keep&#x27;s loopholes.

Stone was also susceptible to intense heat, which would cause it to crack and collapse. Byzantine sources recorded the demolition of stone structures caused by placing clay pots of burning charcoal at the base of walls moistened with vinegar or urine, and the 6th century treatise by an engineer in Justinian&#x27;s army includes the lighting of fires beneath the walls amongst its instructions for sieges.

Stone castles sometimes offered other inflammatory targets. During the Crusades, Muslim defenders frequently hung bundles of straw against their walls as buffers against stones and rams; in turn, the Crusader archers would set these alight with flaming arrows.

===Defense against thermal attack===
Defense from thermal weapons and fire attacks was usually water or other liquids such as urine; hides were soaked and draped over vulnerable wooden hoardings and siege engines, vats and barrels of liquid were collected and stored by defenders and attackers. Hides were hung in an overlapping manner so that any water would run down the whole structure to extinguish flames.
Some thermal weapons (such as quicklime or oil) could not be extinguished or eased by water, in which case sand or earth could be used. Wooden structures were frequently soaked in alum to increase their fire resistance. The Romans covered their &quot;tortoises&quot; (mobile siege sheds) with raw hides packed with vinegar-soaked seaweed or chaff, to serve as protection against regular and incendiary missiles. Throughout the period, sacks or nets might be filled with vinegar-moistened chaff, seaweed or wet moss and hung on the exterior. The wooden siege engines of the Crusaders were vulnerable to attack from the Byzantine and Muslim fire-weapons, so the troops inside siege towers kept stores of water and vinegar.

During the High Middle Ages, the majority of Poland&#x27;s castles were still made of wood, so uncut stone was frequently added to the front to improve their fire defences.

Both attackers and defenders needed to be prepared for incendiary and thermal attack. When the Athenians besieged Syracuse in 416 BC they lost many siege engines to fire. The Syracusan ruler Dionysius I must have taken note of this success, for when he laid siege to Motya in 398 BC he organised special fire &quot;brigades&quot;, who successfully doused the fires when his siege engines were bombarded.

During the First English Civil War, incendiary devices were used to raze city centers. Defenders in London were advised to combat the flames using milk, sand, earth, and urine. In Colchester, fires caused by hand grenades (the weapon was called &quot;wildfire&quot; by the combatants) were extinguished using wet clothes saturated in milk and vinegar.

==Types of weapons==

===Flaming arrows, bolts, spears, and rockets===
Lit torches (burning sticks) were likely the earliest form of incendiary device. They were followed by incendiary arrows, which were used throughout the ancient and medieval periods. The simplest flaming arrows had oil- or resin-soaked tows tied just below the arrowhead and were effective against wooden structures. Both the Assyrians and the Judeans used flaming arrows at the Siege of Lachish in 701 BC. More sophisticated devices were developed by the Romans which had iron boxes and tubes which were filled with incendiary substances and attached to arrows or spears. These arrows needed to be shot from loose bows, since swift flight extinguished the flame; spears could be launched by hand or throwing machine.

Flaming arrows required the shooter to get quite close to their desired target and most will have extinguished themselves before reaching the target. In response, another form of fire arrow was developed which consisted of curved metal bars connecting a tip and hollow end for the shaft. The resulting cage was filled with hot coals or other solid object which could be fired from a much stronger bow or ballista without fear of extinguishing and would be used to ignite straw or thatch roofs from a safer distance.

Flaming arrows and crossbow bolts were used throughout the period. Fifteenth-century writer Gutierre Diaz de Gamez witnessed a Spanish attack on the Moorish town of Oran in 1404 and later described how &quot;During the most part of the night, the galleys did not cease from firing bolts and quarrells dipped in tar into the town, which is near the sea. The noise and the cries which came from the town were very great by reason of the havoc that was wrought.&quot;

Anna Komnene records that at the 1091 Battle of Levounion, lighted torches were fixed to spears.

The Chinese Song dynasty created fire arrows arrows with pouches of gunpowder, which were launched en masse through platforms, and later created rockets such as the huo long chu shui, a multistage rocket used in naval combat. Primitive rockets made from bamboo and leather were used by the Mongols, under Genghis Khan, but were inaccurate. However, the Fatimids used &quot;Chinese arrows&quot; from the 11th century, which probably included saltpetre. The Mamluks experimented with a rocket-powered weapon described as &quot;an egg which moves itself and burns&quot;.

A long iron crossbow-bolt probably designed to carry a fire cartridge was found in a 13th–14th-century castle in Vladimir, Russia. Such large machine-thrown bolts were ideal for incendiary weapons. The Mongols used an &quot;ox-bow&quot; machine to throw bolts which had been dipped in burning pitch, with a range of 2500 paces.

During the British Civil Wars (mid-17th century in Great Britain), both the Parliamentarian and Royalist armies used various incendiary devices to attack enemies and destroy property that might be used for military purposes, according to historian Stephen Porter in &quot;Destruction in the English Civil Wars&quot;. The flaming arrow attack was used to set fire to buildings at a distance. An arrow with a flammable substance attached to the shaft, close to the tip, was shot from a bow or short-muzzled musket. Such arrows shot from a musket had their feathers removed, to fit inside the muzzle, and were called fire-darts. These devices were cheap to make and easy to prepare. Although used infrequently during the wars, the flaming arrows and darts proved to be destructive. The Royalists shot flaming arrows into the thatched homes in the suburbs of Chester causing extensive damage. Lyme Regis was partly razed using flaming arrows.

===Greek fire===
Greek fire was one of the most effective thermal devices, although it was extremely dangerous for the users. A combustible liquid, it could be shot from siphons or catapults, and it burst into flames on impact. First developed by the Byzantines in the 7th century, it was later used by the Turks during the Crusades, and was probably first used in Western Europe in the 12th century. Early experiments by the Byzantines in the 6th century used a mixture of sulfur and oil, which would have been terrifying if not destructive. Various versions seem to have existed, and the recipes were frequently kept secret; experts today still debate the exact composition, although some recipes are known. It probably had regional variations; the Islamic derivative was known as &quot;naft&quot; and had a petroleum base, with sulfur; the Persian word for &quot;petroleum&quot; is (&quot;naft&quot;).

The combustible liquid could be shot from catapults, and would burst into flames on impact. Siphons, frequently of copper, were also developed, first appearing in the 10th and 11th centuries. The siphons could shoot a blazing stream, which a 10th-century Mesopotamian source claimed could engulf twelve men. Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi, who wrote a military manual for Saladin in the 12th century, suggested that &quot;naft&quot; could be placed inside blown eggshells, which could be thrown from horseback. From the 12th century, mouth-blown tubes were developed for use in mines.

Similar petroleum and bitumen-based incendiary mixtures had been known for centuries before the invention of Greek fire, but this new recipe created a blaze which was extremely difficult to extinguish. It burned on water, and was used effectively in naval warfare, although it was primarily an anti-personnel weapon rather than a ship-burner. It remained effective at sea even after its use had declined on land after the 13th century.

The Greek fire recipes continued to be developed over the centuries, and by the High Middle Ages was much more sophisticated than the early versions. Saltpetre (also called &quot;Chinese salt&quot;) was added to the mixture in the Islamic world, and China developed a dry saltpetre mixture in the 12th century, which eventually became gunpowder. Both the Parliamentarian and Royalist armies used Greek-fire-like petroleum-based incendiary devices known as &quot;wildfire&quot; during the British Civil Wars.

Duarte Barbosa ca. 1514 listed weapons made by Javanese people, including Greek fire. Zhang Xie in Dong Xi Yang Kao (1618) mentioned that city of Palembang, which has been conquered by Javanese, produces the furious fiery oil (&quot;ming huo yu&quot;), which according to the &quot;Hua I Kao&quot; is a kind of tree secretion (&quot;shu chin&quot;), and is also called mud oil (&quot;ni yu&quot;). Zhang Xie wrote:It much resemble camphor, and can corrode human flesh. When ignited and thrown on water, its light and flame become all the more intense. The barbarians use it as a fire-weapon and produce great conflagrations in which sails, bulwarks, upperworks and oars all catch fire and cannot withstand it. Fishes and tortoises coming in contact with it cannot escape from being scorched.Because there was no mention of projector pump, the weapon is probably breakable bottles with fuses.

===Hot oil===
Oil of various kinds could be heated to high temperatures and poured over an enemy, although, since it was extremely expensive, its use was limited, both in frequency and quantity. Moreover, it could be dangerous and volatile. Since the smoke point of oil is lower than its boiling point, the oil was only heated and not boiled.

Pouring-oil was used in historic battles, and Josephus described its use at Jotapata in AD 67, saying &quot;the oil did easily run down the whole body from head to foot, under their entire armour, and fed upon their flesh like flame itself.&quot;

Oil was usually used to create incendiary devices. The Roman-Byzantine armies of the 6th century created &quot;fire-pots&quot;, oil-based incendiary weapons which could be launched by hand or with ballistae.
During the siege at Montreuil-en-Bellay in 1147, a mixture of oils from nuts, &quot;cannabis&quot; and flax, was heated in iron containers, launched by mangonel, and burst into flames on impact. The Chinese made early grenades out of oil-soaked hemp and cotton, which were ignited and thrown by mangonels.

Another use of oil can be seen in the naval battle of La Rochelle during the Hundred Years&#x27; War; the Castilians sprayed oil on the decks of English ships then ignited it by shooting flaming arrows down.

===Water, sand and other heated missiles===
Hot oil was considerably less common than boiling water or heated sand, which were cheap and extremely effective; even &quot;dust from the street&quot; could be used. These would penetrate armour and cause terrible burns. Sand, especially, could work its way through very small gaps in armour. The Phoenicians at the Siege of Tyre (332 BC) dropped burning sand down on the attacking Greeks, which got in behind the armour and burned the flesh.

Such heated missiles have also been used in mining situations; the 1st century Roman writer Vitruvius describes a counter-mine dug above the attackers&#x27; gallery by defenders at the siege of Apollonia. Piercing the floor between the mines, the Apollonian defenders poured down boiling water, hot sand and hot pitch onto the heads of their enemy. Other mixtures were more innovative; the defenders at Chester in 918 boiled a mixture of water and ale in copper tubs and poured it over the Viking besiegers, causing their skin to peel off.

When Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa besieged Crema, Italy in the 12th century, the defenders threw red-hot iron objects down on their attackers.

===Pitch, tar and resin===

Burning pitch was used on occasion. The Sasanians threw fire pots containing sulfur, pitch, and naptha (&quot;oil of Medea&quot;) against Byzantine siege engines during the Siege of Petra (550–551). the Mongols were known to fire containers of burning tar during sieges using catapults and trebuchets. Wheels could be covered in pitch, set alight, and rolled along; this technique was commonly used during the Crusades. The besieged Carthaginians in Motya, 398 BC, set alight the siege engines of the attacking Syracusan forces under Dionysius I by dropping burning charred logs and resin-soaked oakum; however, the Syracusans were able to put out the fires.

Pitch was a base ingredient in many incendiary devices throughout the period. The Boeotians developed a fire machine, which they used against the Athenian wooden fortifications during the Battle of Delium in 424 BC. A cauldron of burning coals, pitch and sulfur was suspended at one end of a hollowed-out log and bellows were fixed to the other end. A similar mixture was used 1700 years later by the Scots, when they dropped bales of wood, tar and sulfur by crane onto the English &quot;sow&quot; (a large protective shield covering the battering ram) at the 1319 siege of Berwick-upon-Tweed.

===Animal renderings and parts===
At the 1215 siege of Rochester Castle, King John ordered that fat from 40 pigs be used to set fire to the mines beneath the keep, which caused it to collapse; a cheap and effective technique in place of the more complicated mixture of sulfur, tallow, gum, pitch and quicksilver he had used in France the previous year. Animal fat was not uncommon as an accelerant; in the 13th century French sortie-parties would often be equipped with animal fat, straw and flax to use as fuel when setting fires amongst enemy siege engines.

There were some other intriguing uses of animal parts; during the Siege of Paris in 886 AD, the Franks dropped bucket-loads of a hot mixture of pitch (or oil), wax and fish on the attacking Vikings; the mixture got under the armour and stuck to the skin. Konrad Kyeser&#x27;s &quot; Bellifortis&quot; of 1405 describes a poisonous mixture of sulfur, tar and horses&#x27; hooves. Other incendiary ingredients included egg yolks, and pigeon and sheep droppings.

Some documented uses of animals were not thermal or incendiary. Live insects were also used, to sting the enemy. 4th century BC writer Aeneas Tacticus suggested defenders should let wasps and bees into enemy mines, and jars of scorpions were sometimes fired during early bombardment in naval battles. In 189 BC Ambracia was besieged by the Romans, who dug mines under the walls. The defenders filled a clay jar with chicken feathers, which they then lit, using bellows to blow the acrid smoke down the tunnel; unable to approach the pot due to defensive spears, the Romans were forced to abandon their works.

===Quicklime, sulfur and smoke===
The 15th-century engineer Taccola recommended quicklime, although its use went back to ancient times, and might well have been a component of Greek fire. Quicklime reacts violently with water, and can cause blindness and burns. While quicklime was used in some naval battles, it does not appear to have been standard issue on board ships, due to the danger of the quicklime blowing back and burning the user.

Other substances smoked rather than flamed. Sacks of burning sulfur were effective at clearing enemy mines due to the toxic smoke produced. Any smoke could be used in small confines; the Greek military writer Aeneas Tacticus recommended burning wood and straw to drive out enemy sappers by the smoke.

==Gunpowder and cannons==

The discovery of gunpowder was probably the product of centuries of alchemical experimentation. Saltpetre was known to the Chinese by the mid-1st century AD and there is strong evidence of the use of saltpetre and sulfur in various largely medicinal combinations. The impetus for the development of gunpowder weapons in China was increasing encroachment by tribes on its borders. The earliest known formula for gunpowder can be found in a Chinese work dating probably from the 9th century. The Chinese wasted little time in applying it to warfare, and they produced a variety of gunpowder weapons, including flamethrowers, rockets, bombs, and mines, before inventing firearms. European descriptions of gunpowder first appear in &quot;Opus Maius&quot; and &quot;Opus Tertium&quot;, written by the English philosopher Roger Bacon in the mid-13th century, although the mixture was not very effective. The composition of gunpowder varied throughout the period, and did not settle into the current ratios of saltpetre, sulfur and charcoal until the 17th century.

The years 904–906 saw the use of incendiary projectiles called &#x27;flying fires&#x27; (&quot;fei-huo&quot;). Needham (1986) argues that gunpowder was first used in warfare in China in 919 as a fuse for the ignition of another incendiary, Greek fire. Initially, gunpowder mixtures were utilised through traditional engines and throwing mechanisms; containers and grenades were thrown by mangonels and trebuchets, and explosive rockets and arrows were developed, along with gunpowder flamethrowers.

Like firearms, cannons are a descendant of the fire-lance, a gunpowder-filled tube used as a flamethrower; was sometimes placed in the barrel so that it would fly out together with the flames. In due course, the proportion of saltpeter in the propellant was increased to increase its explosive power. To better withstand that explosive power, the paper and bamboo of which fire-lance barrels were originally made came to be replaced by metal. And to take full advantage of that power, the shrapnel came to be replaced by projectiles whose size and shape filled the barrel more closely. With this, we have the three basic features of the gun: a barrel made of metal, high-nitrate gunpowder, and a projectile which totally occludes the muzzle so that the powder charge exerts its full potential in propellant effect.

Firearms remained in use in China throughout the following centuries. Meanwhile, gunpowder and firearms spread elsewhere very quickly. Gunpowder seems to have been widely known by the 13th century. The Europeans, Arabs, and Koreans all obtained firearms in the 14th century. The Turks, Iranians, and Indians all got firearms no later than the 15th century, in each case directly or indirectly from the Europeans. The Japanese did not acquire firearms until the 16th century, and then from the Portuguese rather than the Chinese.

In 1326, the earliest known European picture of a gun appeared in a treatise entitled &quot;Of the Majesty, Wisdom and Prudence of Kings&quot;. On February 11 of that same year, the Signoria of Florence appointed two officers to obtain &quot;canones de mettallo&quot; and ammunition for the town&#x27;s defense. A reference from 1331 describes an attack mounted by two Germanic knights on Cividale del Friuli, using gunpowder weapons of some sort. Cannons were first used by the Muslims at Alicante in 1331, or Algeciras in 1343. The French raiding party that sacked and burned Southampton in 1338 brought with them a ribaudequin and 48 bolts (but only 3 pounds of gunpowder).
The Battle of Crécy in 1346 was one of the first in Europe where cannons were used.

However, early cannons were not very effective, the main benefits being psychological, frightening men and horses. Short barrelled, large-calibre &quot;bombards&quot; were used up until the late 15th century in Europe, during which period they grew increasingly larger. In the mid-15th century, mortars also appeared. Various smaller weapons also existed, including the &quot;serpentine&quot;, &quot;ribaudequin&quot; and &quot;cropaudin&quot;. The powder was of poor quality and was used in small quantities – to prevent explosion of the barrel – so the effective range of these cannons was rarely more than 200–250m.

The barrels of the cannons were forged or cast, and each gun generally differed in calibre and length. Early powder resembled a paste, and tended to burn slowly. Its composition varied in different geographical areas, the powder of Europe being quite different to that used in the Islamic world. The projectiles used were generally stone balls for bombards and mortars. Forged iron balls were used in smaller-calibre cannons, and coated with lead to make them smooth. From the 15th century, cast iron balls were used, which caused great destruction. As they were denser than stone, even small balls could be destructive. Thus, cannons became smaller in calibre, and longer barrels increased the range.

==Later development==
The use of incendiary devices had decreased by the 14th century, perhaps due to the economic realities of war where it became increasingly important that captured castles and towns were undamaged. Moreover, fewer wooden engines and structures were employed in the battlefield after the late 13th century, perhaps because of the prior success of the incendiary weapons at destroying them.

While the incidence of use dropped, towards the latter end of the Middle Ages the incendiary devices became more sophisticated, and the principle of wielding fire with sword remained present throughout the Early Modern and Modern periods; improving technology merely allowed the process to become more efficient.

===The principle of fire and sword===
Fire itself remained a part of warfare. In his reminisces of the Peninsular War (1807–1814), a British soldier recorded that the French soldiers would &quot;regularly burn to the ground every place they pass through. In following them we find each town and village a heap of smoking ruins.&quot; During World War I, Leuven, in Belgium was &quot;looted and burned in medieval fashion&quot;, when German soldiers set fire to much of the town, destroying the library and other cultural buildings, and causing outrage around the world. Yet the tactic was not dispensed with. In World War II, firebombing with incendiary bombs was carried out by the Germans against Britain during the Blitz, and by the Allies against Germany and Japan. After one heavy raid on Tokyo in March 1945, the resulting conflagration destroyed a quarter of the predominantly wooden buildings. Much as the Ancient Greeks before them, it was a strategy of devastation. Fire has continued to be used as a destructive measure in warfare. During the 1991–1992 Gulf War, Iraq set fire to three-quarters of Kuwait&#x27;s oil wells.

Fire remained an extremely successful weapon. During naval warfare of the Napoleonic Wars, &quot;the one thing most likely to destroy a ship was fire&quot;. 
Sometimes the fires were merely a side effect of weapon technology. Early firearms proved incendiary in their use and could start fires. During the Peninsular War, both Talavera and Salamanca battlefields were wracked by tremendous grassfires, first started by the guns. At the Battle of Trafalgar, 1805, the French ship of the line &quot;Achille&quot; caught fire when musket-flashes from her own men&#x27;s guns set fire to the tar and grease on the sail rigging; the ship eventually exploded.

Smoke screens have continued to be used by attackers and defenders as a means of sowing confusion and hiding movements. During naval battles in the 18–19th centuries, shots were sometimes fired early so a defensive screen was erected before the ships converged, to spoil the aim of the enemy.

===Development and continued use of weapons===
The major development of weapons in the early modern and modern periods occurred with firearms, which became progressively more efficient. Gunpowder settled into its standard ratio in the 17th century, and general ballistic technology improved. Initially, iron round shot replaced the earlier stone balls for cannons then, latterly, different types of shot were invented.

A carcass was a hollow projectile usually formed either by an iron cage of ribs joining two small rings or a cast iron ball with holes. A carcass was so named because the iron cage was thought to resemble the ribs of a body. A carcass was filled with a highly flammable mixture. Carcasses were used for the first time by the French under Louis XIV in 1672.

For short range use against personnel, canister and the smaller naval grapeshot were popular during the 19th century; it comprised smaller iron or lead pellets contained within a case or bag, which scattered on explosion. In 1784, Lt Henry Shrapnel invented a spherical case-shot, which was later named after him. The case was a hollow iron sphere which was filled with musket balls and was detonated by a gunpowder charge. Shot fired from cannons could be so hot that it scorched or set fire to materials that it brushed.

The incendiary liquids of the ancient and medieval periods were also developed, and have their modern equivalents. World War I saw the development of the flamethrower, a modern version of the Byzantine siphons, which used gas under pressure to squirt a mixture of inflammable oil and petrol, ignited by a burning taper. Similarly, the carcass projectile found new use in the Livens Projector, a primitive mortar that could throw a large canister of inflammable liquid (it was soon used for poison gas instead).

Technology improved throughout the 20th century, and the latter half saw the development and use of napalm, an incendiary liquid formed in part from naphtha, which was the main ingredient of the Arabic &quot;naft&quot;.

Flames continued to be used for defensive light until artificial lights were developed. At the Siege of Badajoz in 1812, the French defenders flung down burning &quot;carcasses&quot; of straw so that the attacking British might be seen. Like the sieges of old, the British were met by incendiary weapons, but now these took the form of explosive grenades, mines and powder barrels as well as the enemy&#x27;s guns.

Specific weapons from the ancient and medieval periods continued to develop, and many have modern equivalents. Rocket technology, originally trialled by the Mongols, Indians and the Chinese, amongst others, was improved by the 19th century; one example was the incendiary Congreve rocket, which had a tail, a fuse, and a powder charge (saltpetre, sulfur and carbon) inside a hollow shell. Grenades continued to develop, although still retaining some aspects of their medieval equivalents. The grenades carried on board British Royal Navy ships in the late 18th century and early 19th century were constructed from hollow cast iron, filled with gunpowder; the fuse was a hollow wooden tube filled with combustible material. During World War I, grenades were still occasionally launched by ballistae.

The use of some weapons continued with little change. The Koreans used fire arrows against the Japanese at the Battle of Hansan Island in 1592. At Trafalgar, in 1805, the British ship &quot;Tonnant&quot; shot wads covered in sulfur, which set fire to the &quot;Algésiras&quot;. Fireships were used in later periods. In 1588, the English sent fireships loaded with gunpowder, pitch and tar amongst the anchored Spanish Armada; the Spanish fleet broke formation, setting them up for the later battle. The last battle under sail was the Battle of Navarino (1827), part of the Greek War of Independence, during which fireships were utilised by the Turks.

Chemical warfare had been experimented with during the early period with sulfur, quicklime (calcium oxide), and others, and developments continued. World War I saw many gases used, including the extremely effective sulfur mustard (mustard gas).

<text>Făgăraș (; , ) is a city in central Romania, located in Brașov County. It lies on the Olt River and has a population of 26,284 as of 2021. It is situated in the historical region of Transylvania, and is the main city of a subregion, Țara Făgărașului.

==Geography==
The city is located at the foothills of the Făgăraș Mountains, on their northern side. It is traversed by the DN1 road, west of Brașov and east of Sibiu. On the east side of the city, between an abandoned field and a gas station, lies the geographical center of Romania, at .

The Olt River flows east to west on the north side of the city; its left tributary, the Berivoi River, discharges into the Olt on the west side of the city, after receiving the waters of the Racovița River. The Berivoi and the Racovița were used to bring water to a since-closed major chemical plant located on the outskirts of the city.

The small part of the city that lies north of the Olt is known as &quot;Galați&quot;. A former village first recorded in 1396, it was incorporated into Făgăraș in 1952.

==Name==
One explanation is that the name was given by the Pechenegs, who called the nearby river &quot;Fagar šu&quot; (Fogaras/Făgăraș), which in the Pecheneg language means ash(tree) water.

According to linguist Iorgu Iordan, the name of the town is a Romanian diminutive of a hypothetical collective noun &quot;*făgar&quot; (&quot;beech forest&quot;), presumably derived from &quot;&quot;, &quot;beech tree&quot;. Hungarian linguist István Kniezsa deemed this idea unlikely.

Another interpretation is that the name derives from the Hungarian word &quot;fogoly&quot; (partridge).

There has also been speculation that the name can be explained by folk etymology, as the rendering of the words &quot;fa&quot; (&quot;wooden&quot;) and &quot;garas&quot; (&quot;mite&quot;) in Hungarian. Legends state that money made out of wood had been used to pay the peasants who built the Făgăraș Citadel, an important fortress near the border of the Kingdom of Hungary, around 1310. This view is in harmony with an idea advanced by Iorgu Iordan, who suggested a diminutive derivation from &quot;*făgar&quot;, found elsewhere in Romania as well.

==History==

Făgăraș, together with Amlaș, constituted during the Middle Ages a traditional Romanian local-autonomy region in Transylvania. The first written Hungarian document mentioning Romanians in Transylvania referred to Vlach lands (&quot;Terra Blacorum&quot;) in the Făgăraș Region in 1222. (In this document, Andrew II of Hungary gave Burzenland and the Cuman territories South of Burzenland up to the Danube to the Teutonic Knights.) After the Tatar invasion in 1241–1242, Saxons settled in the area. In 1369, Louis I of Hungary gave the Royal Estates of Făgăraș to his vassal, Vladislav I of Wallachia. As in other similar cases in medieval Europe (such as Foix, Pokuttya, or Dauphiné), the local feudal had to swear oath of allegiance to the king for the specific territory, even when the former was himself an independent ruler of another state. Therefore, the region became the feudal property of the princes of Wallachia, but remained within the Kingdom of Hungary. The territory remained in the possession of Wallachian princes until 1464.

Except for this period of Wallachian rule, the town itself was centre of the surrounding royal estates. During the rule of Transylvanian Prince Gabriel Bethlen (1613–1629), the city became an economic role model city in the southern regions of the realm. Bethlen rebuilt the fortress entirely.

Ever since that time, Făgăraș was the residence of the wives of Transylvanian Princes, as an equivalent of Veszprém, the Hungarian &quot;city of queens&quot;. Of these, Zsuzsanna Lorántffy, the widow of George I Rákóczy established a Romanian school here in 1658. Probably the most prominent of the princesses residing in the town was the orphan Princess Kata Bethlen (1700–1759), buried in front of the Reformed church. The church holds several precious relics of her life. Her bridal gown, with the family coat of arms embroidered on it, and her bridal veil now covers the altar table. Both are made of yellow silk.

Făgăraș was the site of several Transylvanian Diets, mostly during the reign of Michael I Apafi. The church was built around 1715–1740. Not far from it is the Radu Negru National College, built in 1907-1909. Until 1919, it was a Hungarian-language gymnasium where Mihály Babits taught for a while.
A local legend says that Negru Vodă left the central fortress to travel south past the Transylvanian Alps to become the founder of the Principality of Wallachia, although Basarab I is traditionally known as the 14th century founder of the state. By the end of the 12th century the fortress itself was made of wood, but it was reinforced in the 14th century and became a stone fortification.

In 1850 the inhabitants of the town were 3,930, of which 1,236 were Germans, 1,129 Romanians, 944 Hungarians, 391 Roma, 183 Jews, and 47 of other ethnicities, meanwhile in 1910, the town had 6,579 inhabitants with the following proportion: 3,357 Hungarians, 2,174 Romanians, and 1,003 Germans. According to the 2011 census, the city of Făgăraș had 30,714 residents; of those for whom data was available, 91.7% were Romanians, 3.8% Roma, 3.7% Hungarians, and 0.7% German. At the 2021 census, the city had a population of 26,284, of which 73.29% were Romanians, 8.58% Roma, and 2.24% Hungarians.
Făgăraș&#x27;s castle was used as a stronghold by the Communist regime. During the 1950s it was a prison for opponents and dissidents. After the fall of the regime in 1989, the castle was restored and is currently used as a museum and library.

The city&#x27;s economy was badly shaken by the disappearance of most of its industries following the 1989 Revolution and the ensuing hardships and reforms. Some of the city&#x27;s population left as guest workers to Italy, Spain, or Ireland.

===Jewish history===

A Jewish community was established in 1827, becoming among southern Transylvania’s largest by mid-century. Yehuda Silbermann, its first rabbi (1855–1863), kept a diary of communal events. This is still extant and serves as a source on the history of Transylvanian Jewry. In 1869, the local community joined the Neolog association, switching to an Orthodox stance in 1926. A Jewish school opened in the 1860s.

There were 286 Jews in 1856, rising to 388 by 1930, or just under 5% of the population. During World War II, local Germans as well as the Iron Guard attacked Jews and plundered their property. Sixty Jews were sent to forced labor. After the 1944 Romanian coup d&#x27;état rescinded anti-Semitic laws, many left for larger cities or emigrated to Palestine. The last Jew of Făgăraș died in 2013.

==Climate==

<text>Foy Draper (November 26, 1911 – February 1, 1943) was an American track and field athlete who won a gold medal in 4 × 100 m relay at the 1936 Summer Olympics. As a University of Southern California student, Draper won the IC4A championships in 200 m in 1935.

He reportedly held the world record for the 100-yard dash, which at the time would have been a hand-timed 9.4, made all the more remarkable by Draper standing only .

At the Berlin Olympics, Draper ran the third leg in the American 4 × 100 m relay team, which won the gold medal in a world record time of 39.8.

During World War II, Draper served as a pilot on a twin-engine attack bomber A-20B &#x27;Havoc&#x27; in Thelepte, Tunisia. On January 4, 1943, Draper took off to take part in the battle of Kassarine Pass. Draper and his two crewmen never returned and his death date is usually given as February 1, 1943. He is buried in the North Africa American Cemetery and Memorial administered by the American Battle Monuments Commission in Carthage, Tunisia. His gravestone shows January 4, 1943 as his date of death.

<text>Alpbach (, ) is a town in western Austria in the state of Tyrol.

==History==
The earliest written record of the name Alpbach comes from 1150, although human settlement is known to have begun there before and around the year 1000, and a bronze axe found at Steinberger Joch (the pass leading to the Ziller Valley) in 1860 suggests that the route was already in use in the Hallstatt period.

Christianity was first brought to the region in the 7th and 8th centuries by Irish and Scottish monks, and the patron saint of the parish church is in fact St. Oswald, a former King of Northumbria.

At the beginning of the 15th century, deposits of copper and silver were discovered on the Gratlspitz and Schatzberg and in the Luegergraben. At the time, the Fugger merchant family from Augsburg had control over mining operations in Schwaz and Kitzbühel, and they extended their activities to include the Alpbach valley. The Böglerhof housed the Fugger offices and was also seat of the Mining Court. In those days, Alpbach already had two inns, the Böglerhof and the Jakober Inn, where the men of the village would go to drink spirits, such as schnapps. By the middle of the 19th century, productivity at the mines had declined to the stage where they had to be closed.

Vorder-Unterberg Farm, which was built in 1636–1638 by local carpenters and was used as a farmhouse in until 1952, stands at the edge of the forest above the little church in Inneralpbach. Today the building is a mountain farming museum, and the exhibits include the old parlour, chapel, a combined kitchen and smokehouse, and over 800 artefacts of daily life and work.

The road leading up the valley to Alpbach was not built until 1926, and the isolated location of the village led to the development of a distinctive style of architecture and furnishings, and also enabled the local folk traditions to be preserved for much longer than in most of the valleys of the Tyrol.

==Era of tourism==
Tourists first began arriving in Alpbach at the beginning of the 20th century and by 1938 the village had accommodation for 110 visitors. Since then this figure has increased to 2500 and Alpbach now attracts some 22,000 visitors in summer and about the same in winter for an annual total of 300,000 nights. Tourism is the main source of income for today&#x27;s 2300 local residents, but there are still 105 working farms in Alpbach, the same number as a hundred years ago.

Since 1945, Alpbach has been the venue for the Alpbach European Forum, an annual two-week conference of leading figures from the worlds of science, business, the arts and politics. The Forum and the participation of so many people who have shaped the thinking of their times has given Alpbach the nickname, &quot;The Village Of Thinkers.&quot;

The first conference hall in Alpbach was built in the mid-1950s and named after the Austrian poet Paula von Preradovic, who wrote the words for the Austrian national anthem. The plenary hall was named after the physicist and Nobel Prize winner Erwin Schrödinger. He lies buried in the Alpbach cemetery.

At the suggestion of Alfons Moser, Mayor of Alpbach from 1945 to 1979, the council issued a local planning law in 1953, which made the traditional style of architecture in Alpbach mandatory for all new buildings.

Over the years, Alpbach has collected many awards and distinctions. In 1975, the Austrian Public Health Institute certified that Alpbach had the cleanest and purest air in all of Austria. It was voted &quot;Austria&#x27;s Most Beautiful Village&quot; in 1983 by a television contest organised by Austrian Television. In June 1985, the Council of Europe in Strasbourg conferred upon Alpbach the right to fly the European flag in recognition of the community&#x27;s services to European Unity. In 1993, Alpbach won &quot;The Most Beautiful Floral Village in Europe&quot; award.

==Modern Alpbach==
In 1999, the new Alpbach Congress Centre was opened, together with the 55th European Forum. With its combination of exciting architecture and a minimum environmental footprint, the main architectural feature is a spiral shaped gallery with floor-to-ceiling glazing for a unique view of the spectacular mountain backdrop.

Alpbach is also a well known ski resort and its quiet slopes are well groomed and provide beginner to intermediate runs with many off pistes as well as unpatrolled route 5 which is popular with the more advanced skiers. A new lift has been opened in 2006-2007 which is a gondola and allows people to move from Inner-Alpbach to near the top of the Wiedersberger Horn (the mountain used for all of the runs). Alpbach is also more popular with skiers than snowboarders due to the lack of extreme off piste, but is a very popular place for beginner boarders, or those looking to re-kindle their boarding passion. There is also a halfpipe for the more adventurous. There are three ski schools in the village, the first is the original Ski and Snowboardschool at Alpbach-Inneralpbach run since 1932 by Sepp Margreiter (a state-certified ski instructor and ski guide). The second is the Alpbach Active Skischule, of which the HQ of the ski school run from Alpbach, the same as the original ski school. The third is Schischule Alpbachtal, or SkiCheck. This is the most recently established ski school in the valley, founded in 2012.

<text>Sfântu Gheorghe (; or &quot;Szentgyörgy&quot; ; ; English lit.: &quot;Saint George&quot;) is a city that serves as the seat of Covasna County in Transylvania, Romania. Located in the central part of the country, it lies on the Olt River in a valley between the Baraolt Mountains and the . The town administers two villages, Chilieni (&quot;Kilyén&quot;) and Coșeni (&quot;Szotyor&quot;).

== History ==
Sfântu Gheorghe is one of the oldest urban settlements in Transylvania, the town first having been documented in 1332. The town takes its name from Saint George, the patron of the local church. Historically, it was also known in German as &quot;Sankt Georgen&quot;. The &quot;sepsi&quot; prefix (&quot;sebesi&quot; → &quot;sepsi&quot;, meaning &quot;of Sebes&quot;) refers to the area which the ancestors of the local Székely population had inhabited before settling to the area of the town. The previous area of their settlement was around the town of &quot;Sebes&quot; (now Sebeș, in Alba County) which later became populated mainly by Transylvanian Saxons (), being known as &quot;Mühlbach&quot; in German.

While part of the Kingdom of Hungary, the town was the economic and administrative center of the Hungarian county of Háromszék, which spanned the present-day Covasna County and parts of Brașov County. In the second half of the 19th century, Sepsiszentgyörgy witnessed the development of light industry, a textile and a cigarette factory being built. In the aftermath of World War I, the Union of Transylvania with Romania was declared in December 1918. At the start of the Hungarian–Romanian War of 1918–1919, the town passed under Romanian administration. After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, it became part of the Kingdom of Romania and the seat of Trei Scaune County. In 1940, the Second Vienna Award granted Northern Transylvania to the Kingdom of Hungary. Near the end of that period, the Sfântu Gheorghe ghetto briefly existed in the town. In September 1944, during World War II, Romanian and Soviet armies entered the town. The territory of Northern Transylvania remained under Soviet military administration until 9 March 1945, after which it became again part of Romania; the Paris Peace Treaties of 1947 reaffirmed the town and the entirety of Transylvania as a Romanian territory. Between 1952 and 1960, Sfântu Gheorghe was the southernmost town of the Magyar Autonomous Region, and between 1960 and 1968 it was part of the Brașov Region. In 1968, when Romania was reorganized based on counties rather than regions, the city became the seat of Covasna County.

Sfântu Gheorghe is one of the centres for the Székely people in the region, known to them as Székelyföld in Hungarian – which means &quot;Székely Land&quot;, and is home to the Székely National Museum. The town hosts two market fairs each year.

==Demographics==
At the 2021 census, the city had a population of 50,080; of those, 69.25% were Hungarians and 18.93%Romanians.

<text>Mount Madison is a mountain in the Presidential Range of New Hampshire in the United States. It is named after the fourth U.S. President, James Madison.

Mountains in the Presidential Range are named for U.S. presidents, with the tallest (Mount Washington) named for the first president, the second tallest (Mount Adams) for the second president, and so on. However, due to a surveying error, Mount Monroe, named after the fifth president, James Monroe, is actually taller than Mount Madison.

There are many hiking trails on the mountain. A stretch of the Appalachian Trail traverses just below its summit on the Osgood Trail. The Madison Spring Hut, maintained by the Appalachian Mountain Club, is nestled between Mount Madison and Mount Adams and provides rustic lodging in the summer. Reservations generally need to be made far in advance.

Mount Madison is the northernmost peak in the Presidentials. Like most of the range, its summit is above treeline. Due to high winds and low temperatures, hypothermia is a danger even in the summer.

==Climate==
There is no weather station at the summit, but this climate table contains interpolated data for an area around the summit. Mount Madison has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;).

<doc id="1060565" wikidata="Q1916992" url="?curid=1060565" title="Sintaluta">
<text>Sintaluta () is a town in Saskatchewan, Canada. The population of Sintaluta is 124 people according to the 2021 Census of Population. The town is about 85 km east of Regina. The town is on the north side of the Trans-Canada Highway. The name &quot;Sintaluta&quot; comes from a Lakota language word meaning &quot;tail of the red fox&quot;.

It is the administrative headquarters of the Carry the Kettle Nakoda Nation band government.

== History ==
The first section foreman for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) came to Sintaluta in 1886. The first railway station opened here in 1898. When Saskatchewan became a province in 1905, the people of the settlement soon set into action the application that this place should be incorporated into a town. This happened in 1907.

Before the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) made its way across the west, the pioneers would stop at Sintaluta to refresh their supplies before heading west. In 1881, the first stopping house was established at what would become Sintaluta. Sintaluta&#x27;s first school classroom was opened up shortly after 1882. Church services were held in the stopping house and schools until 1887, when the Presbyterians built a wooden structure, followed by a brick one built by the Methodists in 1899. St. John the Baptist Anglican Church also built a stone church and manse that still stands today and has been carefully preserved by the local history club. In 1943, St Helene&#x27;s Roman Catholic church was built. This church is still present today. In 1959, the congregation of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses built Kingdom Hall. The United Church of Canada built a modern church and education centre in the early 1960s. This is now home to the senior citizens association.

The town outgrew its school classroom and the first school house was a necessity and was built in 1895. In 1899, a large stone school was built. It burned down in 1905. A two-story brick school was built in 1907. The bricks were purchased locally from a factory in Lebret.

In 1901, there was a bumper crop of wheat in the Sintaluta district. It was a good year all around for farmers as far as wheat was concerned, but their problem was getting the wheat on trains for delivery to the grain terminals. Farmers would bring their grain to the elevator and trains would leave without taking it. Some influential men of the time decided that they would take the Canadian Pacific Railway to court over this matter. One of these men was Edward Alexander Partridge. The farmers won the case. They had made their stand at a key time, for the CPR described Sintaluta as being the largest grain shipping point at that time, in Western Canada. This was later made into a movie by the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool and called &quot;The Long Haul&quot;.

Sintaluta was home to the founder of the current-day United Grain Growers Association (Agricore United) with prominent local residents residing on the first board of directors. &quot;The Grain Growers Guide&quot; (now &quot;The Country Guide&quot;) first editor was also from Sintaluta.

In 1945, Bell Telephone celebrated its 70th anniversary. There was a resident in town, whose name was John Miller. He was 91 years old at the time. He received a call from Paris, Ontario, that was sent by the mayor of the city. It was congratulating him on being the oldest person from Western Canada who heard the first message sent over the Bell Telephone when he was 21 years old.

Sintaluta once was home to seven elevator companies, and has the distinction as being one of the top grain-producing areas in all of Canada. There are two remaining elevators in town today, and are in the hands of private owners, two of fewer than 350 elevators that remain across the prairies today.

Robert (Bob) Baker worked for the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool as a grain buyer from 1935 until 1952 when he was superannuated from the Sask. Wheat Pool elevator and became Town Clerk as well as selling farm insurance. The Sintaluta Co-op service station opened in 1947. Vic Sexsmith was the Manager from 1947 to 1965. Albert Sexsmith worked there from 1947 to 1954. It is the only service station still in operation in Sintaluta in 2017. Vic Sexsmith became Town Clerk in 1965 taking over from Robert Baker who was Town Clerk from 1952 to 1965. Vic also took over the insurance business. 
Vic Sexsmith was a Town Councillor for several terms. He became the Mayor of Sintaluta in 1961. He remained as Town Clerk from 1965 until 1970 when he became ill and his wife Marion Sexsmith took over and was Town Clerk until 1974.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census conducted by Statistics Canada, Sintaluta had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its population of 119 recorded in the 2016 Canadian Census. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<text>St Joseph&#x27;s College (abbreviated as SJC and commonly called Joeys) is an independent Catholic secondary day and boarding school for boys, conducted in the Marist Brothers tradition, located in Hunters Hill, a suburb on the Lower North Shore of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

Founded by the Marist Brothers in 1881, Joeys currently caters for approximately 1,100 students from Year 7 to Year 12, including over 550 boarders, making it the largest all boys boarding school in Australia, and one of the largest in the southern hemisphere.

The College is affiliated with the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Australian Boarding Schools&#x27; Association (ABSA), the Association of Marist Schools of Australia (AMSA), and is a founding member of the Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales (AAGPS).

In 2006, Joeys saw the appointment of its first lay headmaster, Ross Tarlinton, who served from 2006 to 2017. He was succeeded in 2018 by another layman, Christopher Hayes and now Michael Blake.

==History==

===Foundation===
St Joseph&#x27;s College (SJC) can trace its origins back to the Marist Brothers&#x27; school founded in Harrington Street, Church Hill, which was attached to St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church. The Headmaster, Emilian Pontet then sought out land to found a new school elsewhere. After inspecting several locations, Hunters Hill was chosen due to its proximity to the Marist Fathers&#x27; Monastery and Parish of Villa Maria.

On 29 July 1881, the Headmaster, Emilian Pontet, moved the schools location from Harrington Street to Hunters Hill, founding St Joseph&#x27;s College in a temporary wooden building with a student population of 55. Within six years of its founding, keen observers had taken notice. In 1887, James Francis Hogan wrote in &quot;The Irish in Australia&quot; that: 

St John&#x27;s College, affiliated to the University of Sydney; Saint Ignatius&#x27; College, Riverview, conducted by the Jesuit Fathers; and St. Joseph&#x27;s College, Hunter Hill , under the management of , are three educational institutions that reflect the highest credit on the Catholic population of the parent colony.
Brother Emilian Pontet was the founding headmaster (1881–1890); he was succeeded by Brother Stanislaus (1890–1894) who continued the building program at the main campus and oversaw the acquisition of 16 acres of playing fields close by.

These events took place in the aftermath of the Battle of Waterloo, the transition of NSW from a penal colony to a free settlement under the Governorship of Macquarie, the broader context of Victorian Era politics and activity from London such as Saint Joseph&#x27;s Missionary Society of Mill Hill founded in 1866 by future Cardinal Herbert Alfred Vaughan. 19th Century Bishops such as Polding and Ullathorne were faithful witnesses to much missionary endeavour and Australia ceased being a mission territory simultaneously with Pope Paul VI writing to all the faithful of the entire world in &quot;Evangelii Nuntiandi&quot; on 8 December 1975.

===Headmasters===
The following individuals have served as Headmaster of St Joseph&#x27;s College, Hunters Hill:
===Campus===

The College opened in 1881 in a temporary wooden building, however, it has continued to expand its grounds and buildings since then. Some examples are the construction of the main building&#x27;s southern wing in 1882–1884; the building of the central and northern wing in 1889–1894 and the building of the Chapel in 1938–1940. The south-eastern corner of the College campus is a property which was acquired in 1882 with the assistance of a benefactor named O&#x27;Shaugnessy. The property was then known as Joubert&#x27;s Reserve and the original small stone cottage that stood on the land when it was acquired still remains on the site today. The College&#x27;s main playing fields (&quot;the Park&quot;) are located 300m away from the main campus and were bought in 1893 from Charles Gilbert Heydon a distinguished lawyer and devout Catholic who offered the Brothers for sale at a discount 16 acres he had acquired nine years earlier. Heydon agreed to a generous instalment plan to assist the Brothers to make the purchase and the interest bill was met by the same benefactor O&#x27;Shaugnessy who had assisted with the acquisition of Joubert&#x27;s Reserve eleven years earlier. Charles Gilbert Heydon was the brother of Louis Francis Heydon MLC, for a time the Australasian President of the St Vincent de Paul Society. Louis died on 17 May 1918 at his residence &quot;Kentigern&quot; at Mary Street Hunters Hill with a requiem mass at Villa Maria followed by a burial at the Field of Mars Cemetery. The Society report for the completed 1907 year refers to 10 new conferences in NSW, one being at St Joseph&#x27;s College Hunters Hill – being the &quot;first collegiate conference in the circumscription&quot;.

Today the College is situated on a campus overlooking the Lane Cove and Parramatta Rivers, in suburban Hunter&#x27;s Hill, from the Sydney central business district. The current facilities of the school include:

===Accommodation===

St Joseph&#x27;s has several buildings used for accommodation. Five of these are for Years 10, 11 and 12 respectively. The College&#x27;s main building, which has stood since the 1880s, contains dorms for the junior years, as well as all the College&#x27;s refectories (dining rooms), the Health Centre, Common Room, the College Chapel and administration offices. The Year 12 Boarding Area was totally refurbished in early 2009, creating modern and comfortable accommodation for senior students.

The College operates kitchens and a laundry catering for all students, teachers and brothers.

===Academic facilities===
The College has a significant number of academic facilities, including a large four-storey building solely containing science laboratories and classrooms (which have recently been refurbished), a library and resource centre, a visual arts centre, a music centre, a hall and five computer labs, each with 20 plus computers. Stage one of a major refurbishment of the resource centre was completed early in 2009, creating a modern, up-to-date teaching and learning facility that provides students with high quality resources and technology for today&#x27;s fast paced digital world. In 2013, St. Joseph&#x27;s opened a new Technology and Arts Precinct, including numerous art studios, workshops and classrooms.

===Sporting facilities===
Similar to other GPS schools, St Joseph&#x27;s has significant sporting facilities for use in both training and competition. The College owns and maintains approximately 10 playing fields for cricket, rugby and football. The main playing fields are housed in a facility known as &quot;the Park&quot; and located two blocks from the school campus and is often used by higher level teams for training purposes. The Park complex also contains 8 tennis courts. It is considered the best school in the GPS currently as it has the most wins.

On the main school campus there are five basketball courts, three playing fields (referred to as the &#x27;back ovals&#x27;), a number of cricket nets, a swimming pool, two gymnasiums (for basketball and weightlifting respectively) and a cardio room. The boatshed and pontoons for the school&#x27;s rowing club are situated some from the main campus on nearby Tarban Creek, a northern tributary of Sydney&#x27;s Parramatta River.

===Outdoor education facilities===
In 1986, St Joseph&#x27;s opened &quot;Colo&quot;, an outdoor education centre for students. It provides education in various outdoor activities, culminating in extended expeditions in Year 9. The director is Paul Bryant.
==Organisation==

===Marist Brothers===
An ageing population of Marist brothers have their own accommodation on the school grounds (some in the retired brothers quarters) and work to maintain its status, holding a number of executive positions at the College. In 2006, Ross Tarlinton became the first lay headmaster of the College, followed by Dr Chris Hayes in 2017.

In 2019, the College farewelled the last teaching Marist Brother, Br Anthony Boyd (1969), who after 40 years of service at the College (23 as Deputy Headmaster), retired from his duties at the College.

=== Sexual abuse allegations ===
In June, July and August 2014 the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, a royal commission of inquiry initiated in 2013 by the Australian Government and supported by all of its state governments, began an investigation into the response of Marist Brothers to allegations of child sexual abuse in schools in the ACT, NSW and Queensland. Five former students, one former teacher, a former assistant principal and two former principals, former and current Marist officials and clergy, and one of the clergy at the centre of the allegations gave evidence or made statements before the Royal Commission that the alleged cases of abuse happened during the 1970s and 1980s at Daramalan College, Canberra, at , and in Far North Queensland.

In March 2015 a former Marist brother, Francis William Cable, known as Brother Romuald was arrested over a number of sex offences allegedly committed at St Joseph&#x27;s College and St Gregory&#x27;s College in Campbelltown in the 1980s.

In 2021, a Marist Brother John Patrick O&#x27;Brien who worked at the school in the 1970&#x27;s was convicted of a number of child sexual abuses which occurred at the school. On 5 November 2021, O’Brien was given a head sentence of 7 years 9 months, 5 years non parole and is available for parole on 14 April 2026.

===Boarding===
With a boarding population of approximately 900, SJC is the largest boarding school for boys in Australia. Joeys offers full boarding as well as weekly boarding options (where students go home on weekends). In recent times, the College has also offered day-schooling, and students who do not board are known as &#x27;day-boys&#x27;.

A number of dormitories (&#x27;dorms&#x27;) and refectories (&#x27;refs&#x27;) are located on the College grounds for boarders and day-boys alike. Dorms and refs are segregated by year, and students tend to receive larger, more private and more privileged accommodation as they advance through the years(i.e. students move from large dormitories to single rooms, and from the College&#x27;s original accommodation facilities to newly built accommodation).

==Curriculum==
As a secondary school in New South Wales, the College teaches Year 7 to 12 students in accordance with the State Government&#x27;s education curriculum, as determined by the Board of Studies. At the end of Year 12, successful students are accredited with their Higher School Certificate (HSC).

==Co-curriculum==
St Joseph&#x27;s College offers a variety of co-curricular activities, including Senior Orchestra, Chess and Debating. Joeys also has the reputation of being a very strong sporting school. 
===Sport===
St Joseph&#x27;s official sporting calendar revolves around competition with the eight other GPS Schools. However, it regularly competes against The Associated Schools (CAS) during the lead-up to each season, and as a member of the GPS (in GPS v CAS matches) at the end of each season. 

GPS sports include athletics, Australian rules football, basketball, cricket, cross country, football (soccer), tennis, rowing, rugby union, swimming, and water polo.

====Rugby union====
St. Joseph&#x27;s has a very proud, strong tradition in rugby union, being widely renowned as one of Australia&#x27;s great rugby nurseries. Over the years, the college has produced many well known players who have represented at grade, state and national levels, including three Wallaby Captains. St. Joseph&#x27;s proud history is displayed through their many 1st and 2nd XV premierships in the AAGPS competitions. Their most recent 1st XV success was in 2019, where the college won their 56th 1st XV premiership while the 2nd XV and 3rd XV were also undefeated to win their premierships.

==== Football ====
St Joseph&#x27;s has a storied history in AAGPS Football, winning premierships in both the 1st &amp; 2nd XI in the inaugural competition in 1988. The College has won four 1st XI premierships (1988, 1997, 2012, 2022, 2023) and three 2nd XI premierships (1988, 1998, 2012). The &#x27;Lower Park&#x27; complex was refurbished in 2019 with a new grandstand and dugouts, and hosts one of the premier natural turf Football pitches in Sydney.
====Cricket====
Cricket has always been one of the premier summer sports at St. Joseph&#x27;s. The college has always been strong in cricket, dating back to the inaugural AAGPS season, in which St. Joseph&#x27;s shared the premiership along with Sydney Grammar School and Newington College. Stan McCabe remains the college&#x27;s most well known cricketer. In recent years, St Joseph&#x27;s has been consistently one of the best high school cricketing teams, winning both the AAGPS Premiership and Marist Cricket Carnival on multiple occasions.

====Rowing====
St. Joseph&#x27;s was the fourth Sydney school to take to the water (after Grammar, Riverview and Shore) and has been rowing in the GPS competition since 1907. Joeys had their inaugural GPS victory in 1911, then again in 1916. The College&#x27;s 1st VIII victory in the 2015 race ended a drought dating back to 1973 at the AAGPS Head of the River. Joeys again won in 2024 with a great victory in the AAGPS Head of the river.

====Basketball====
St Joseph&#x27;s has won the 1st GPS Basketball Competition 5 Times since it began in 1976 including the 1981, 1984, 1989, 1991 &amp; 1993 seasons.

<text>Târnăveni (, historically Diciosânmartin; Hungarian: &quot;Dicsőszentmárton&quot;, ; German: &quot;Sankt Martin&quot;, earlier &quot;Marteskirch&quot;) is a city in Mureș County, central Romania. It lies on the Târnava Mică River in central Transylvania. The city administers three villages: Bobohalma (&quot;Bábahalma&quot;), Botorca (&quot;Őrhegy&quot;), and Cuștelnic (&quot;Csüdőtelke&quot;); the last was part of Gănești Commune until 2002.

In Romanian, it was previously known as &quot;Diciosânmartin&quot;, then &quot;Târnava-Sânmărtin&quot;.

==History==
===Prehistoric period===
Archaeological research has demonstrated that the presence of human communities in this area dates back thousands of years. In 1921, traces of a Neolithic settlement were discovered.

===Antiquity===
A collection of 135 Imperial Roman &quot;denarii&quot; and two silver balls were also found.

===Middle Ages===
The place was historically certified in 1279, under the name of &quot;terra Dychen Sent Marton&quot;, in a document involving land relocations and ownership.

In 1502, the place was mentioned as a borough (Medieval Latin: &quot;oppidum&quot;), as a part of Cetatea de Baltă fief of the Moldavian Princes Stephen the Great and Petru Rareș. Since vineyards covered the majority of the cultivated land, it came to be known as the &quot;vine country&quot; (Weinland in German).

===Early modern period===
For centuries, until the area was ceded to Romania after the Treaty of Trianon following World War I, the city was a local administrative center inside the Kingdom of Hungary and later within Austria-Hungary. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, Târnăveni was included in the administrative units of Romanians resisting the Hungarian revolutionary government, and, as part of the 3rd Legion &quot;Cetatea de Baltă&quot;, provided soldiers for the army of Avram Iancu. Its prefect was , who was ultimately defeated and settled in Boziaș (now a neighborhood of Târnăveni), where he later died.

After 1866, the city served as the capital of Kis-Küküllő &quot;comitatus&quot;, alternating this attribute with Küküllővár (today&#x27;s &quot;Cetatea de Baltă&quot;) or with Erzsébetváros (today&#x27;s &quot;Dumbrăveni&quot;). The late 19th and early 20th centuries, a period when many administrative and social-economic facilities were built in the town, marked an urban evolution. In 1912, the locality was raised to the rank of city.

The discovery of methane deposits radically changed the city history: gas was supplied to private residences after 1915.

===Interbellum period===
The inhabitants sent representatives to the Great National Assembly held in Alba Iulia on December 1, 1918. Once Transylvania became a province of the Kingdom of Romania, the town became the administrative seat of Târnava-Mică County. Named &quot;Târnava-Sânmărtin&quot; during 1920–1926, and later &quot;Diciosânmartin&quot;, the locality officially became &quot;Târnăveni&quot; in 1941.

After World War I, a calcium carbide and calcium cyanamide factory was set up, followed by a nitrogen and later by a coke factory. In 1936, an installation of synthetic ammonia production was set in Târnăveni, the first of this type in the world — over the following years, the company involved in the latter process switched to weapons manufacturing. The administrative palace and the hospital were both built during the urban expansion — the latter was where the famous physician Constantin Ion Parhon, whose family was originally from Cetatea de Baltă, used to consult his patients.

===World War II===
On 29 April 1941, the city was renamed from Diciosânmărtin to Târnăveni. 230 Romanian soldiers who, after Romania parted with the Axis and joined the Allies in 1944, defended the city against German troops lie buried in the local cemetery.

===Communist period===
After the war, the city&#x27;s industry witnessed continuous development. In 1957, for the first time in the country, polychlorinated vinyl was produced here. A modern glassware factory — &quot;Gecsat&quot; — is situated in the southeast area, and produces a wide range of export products.

Târnăveni became a municipality on November 5, 1998.

===Jewish history===
A Jewish community was established in 1868; among the early settlers were Sephardim from Alba Iulia. By the end of the 19th century, the Jewish population expanded, attracted to the new county capital, and played an important role in its economic development. By 1920, there were 490 Jews, exceeding 10% of the population. A small Hasidic community arose in the interwar period. Zionist activity began in 1918, led by .

In 1940, the National Legionary State closed down all Jewish shops. In 1941, the town&#x27;s 796 Jews were sent to Blaj. Ten days later, they returned, when Jewish refugees in the area began to gather in Târnăveni. Many Jews were forced to leave their homes and move to remote areas. The young were sent to forced labor; some were deported to Transnistria Governorate. After 1944, the community was reorganized, but most of its members emigrated to Palestine.

==Geography==
Târnăveni is crossed by the Blaj-Praid railroad, and also by DN 14A Iernut-Mediaș, 
DJ 107 Târnăveni-Blaj, DJ Târnăveni-Căpâlna-Ungheni and by DJ 142 Târnăveni-Bălăușeri. Târnăveni is situated at the following distances from:
*Bucharest – 360 km
*Târgu-Mureș – 45 km
*Cluj-Napoca – 102 km
*Sibiu – 78 km
*Mediaș – 25 km
*Blaj – 36 km


==Demographics==
At the 2011 census, Târnăveni had 22,075 inhabitants, making it the 84th largest city in Romania; according to previous records, it had 26,073 inhabitants in 1977, 30,520 in 1992, and 26,654 in 2002. Of the population, 72.21% were Romanians, 15.31% Hungarians, and 11.24% Roma.

At the 2021 census, the city had a population of 20,604; of those, 65% were Romanians, 11.8% Roma, and 11.6% Hungarians.

==Culture==
In 1962, the local Museum of History was opened, housing separate sections for archaeology, ethnography, natural science and numismatics. The present-day Unitarian Church, built in Gothic style in the 13th century, redecorated in 1599, houses a silver cup from 1636, as well as a silver plate and a bell dating from 1678. The wooden Orthodox Church, brought over from the Cornești village, had its interior painted by Nicolae Pop. The school in Boziaș was set up in 1780.

Other buildings in the city include the Romanian Orthodox Holy Trinity Cathedral (built 1939–1940), the Sfântul Gheorghe Church, and the Roman Catholic church.

==Natives==
One of the main pillars of the Transylvanian School, Petru Maior, had connections with city — according to research, his father Gheorghe Maior, lived in Târnăveni by 1750, serving as a Greek-Catholic priest in the Seuca parish. Other natives include:

* Olga Bede (1908–1985), writer
* György Ligeti (1923–2006), composer
* Sergiu Muth (born 1990), footballer
* Emil Petru (1939–1995), footballer
* Gheorghe Riffelt (born 1936), rower
* Mircea Tuli (born 1957), weightlifter

==International relations==
===Twin towns — Sister cities===
Târnăveni is twinned with:
* Hajdúszoboszló (since 1990)
* Ronchin (since 1998)

<doc id="1060573" wikidata="Q1267399" url="?curid=1060573" title="Durlston Country Park">
<text>Durlston Country Park is a 320-acre country park and nature reserve stretching along the coast of the Isle of Purbeck on the outskirts of Swanage in Dorset, England. The park is a popular destination for tourists to enjoy the walks, views, visitor centre, climbing, and wildlife, including Durlston Castle, the Great Globe, Tilly Whim Caves, and Anvil Point Lighthouse. It is a gateway to the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site, forms part of the 630 mile South West Coast Path, and is owned by Dorset Council.



== Wildlife and Geology ==
The Park has a mosaic of habitats, hosting a wide range of species. Habitats include sea-cliffs, downs, ancient meadows, hedgerows, woodland, and dry-stone walls – each with their characteristic plants and animals. These include 33 species of breeding butterfly, over 250 species of bird recorded, 500 wildflowers, 500 moths and thousands of other invertebrates. The site is an important resting place for migrating birds in the spring and autumn. The sea-cliffs are home to a variety of breeding seabirds including a colony of 400 guillemots - the second largest on the south coast of England. The rangers write a wildlife diary every morning which can be read on the website www.durlston.co.uk.

The underlying rock is limestone so the majority of the park is calcareous grassland, probably created about 1000 years ago by clearing of oak forest, hosting a range of wild flower species and associated animals such as butterflies. The sea-cliffs at Durlston are popular climbing areas; Subliminal, Boulder Ruckle and Cattle Troughs.

== History ==
In the 19th and 20th centuries Purbeck was quarried for its high-quality limestone. There were few open-cast quarries, and none in Durlston, but there are many mine shafts across the landscape, notably &quot;Tilly Whim Caves&quot; in a dry glacial meltwater valley.

In 1887 George Burt built a small Castle at Durlston Head, on the hill above Durlston Bay and the town of Swanage. The Durlston Castle was never a real castle, but was purpose-built to be used as a restaurant for his Durlston estate. Burt also commissioned a 40-ton limestone Great Globe, three metres in diameter, engraved with an 1880s world map. The footpaths around the Castle and Globe are lined with cast iron London bollards which were left in Swanage having been used as ballast by the ships transporting stone to London. Other ornaments include plaques carved with quotations from Shakespeare and the Bible, maps showing the English Channel and the United Kingdom, and facts about the natural world.

== Facilities and Events ==
Durlston Castle hosts a Visitor Centre, Toilets, Shop, Cafe, Gallery, Cinema Room, and Fossil Room (open every day except Christmas Day and Boxing Day). Durlston hosts an extensive events programme which can be viewed on the website www.durlston.co.uk. Events include ranger-led guided walks, family activity trails, sea-bird boat trips, stargazing, arts &amp; crafts and other children&#x27;s events. The Visitor Centre hosts a Belvedere and Fine Foundation Gallery which regularly hosts exhibitions, performances, weddings, and other functions. The Learning Centre hosts an activity classroom available for hire by schools, businesses, and community groups. Ranger-led &#x27;Discovery Sessions&#x27; offer teachers and students a fantastic opportunity for outdoor learning.

== Accessibility ==
Durlston won Gold in VisitEngland&#x27;s Awards for Excellence 2020 in the Accessible and Inclusive Tourism category. The park has put a lot of investment into improving its footpaths, making them easier to walk along or for use with off-road wheelchairs or mobility scooters that are available to hire at the Visitor Centre. The accessible &#x27;Everyone Needs a Shed&#x27; facility welcomes people of all ages and abilities to socialise, learn new skills, and volunteer in support of the park.

== Awards and designations ==
The Park is Grade II listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Most of the Park is designated Site of Special Scientific Interest and since 1997, a Special Area of Conservation. The majority is also designated as a Site of Nature Conservation Importance. In 1997 the Dorset and East Devon Coast was awarded World Heritage Site status for its geological importance. Durlston is in the Dorset National Landscape area and the Purbeck Heritage Coast (which holds a Council of Europe Diploma for its management). In June 2008, Durlston was awarded national nature reserve status by Natural England in recognition of the national importance of Durlston for wildlife. Durlston has also been awarded the Green Flag Award in recognition of the quality of its amenities for visitors.

== Travel ==
The car parks provide space for cars, motorbikes, coaches and bicycles. 
Buses from Poole (No. 40) and Bournemouth (No. 50) arrive at Swanage Bus Station which is a one-mile walk from Durlston Country Park. 
The Durlston Explorer bus D5 normally runs shuttles from Swanage Bus Station every half hour between May and September.

<text>The Rugby League Premiership was a competition for British rugby league clubs between 1973 and 1995. As the Super League Premiership the competition continued until 1997.

==History==
From 1909 until 1973 (except for 1962–64) the Rugby Football League Championship used a play-off format to determine the league champions. For the 1973–74 season the league was split into two divisions, and a play-off system was no longer used.

In order to maintain interest towards the end of the season a new competition, the Club Championship, was introduced to replace the play-offs. The Harry Sunderland Trophy, which had until then been awarded to the man of the match in the championship final, was instead awarded in the premiership final.

The first season saw 16 teams take part: the top 12 of the first division and the top four from the second division. The following season saw the title change to &quot;Premiership&quot;, and the format was altered so that only the top eight teams in the first division would compete. A similar competition was later instituted for clubs in the lower league(s). The Premiership continued to be played until 1995–96, and the switch to a summer sport, when the competition was abandoned to allow the 1996 Super League season to begin in the spring.

A top-four play-off leading to a final, the Super League Premiership, was instituted as part of the Super League competition. In 1998 this was replaced by a return to a play-off for the championships, with the Harry Sunderland Trophy being the award to the Grand Final&#x27;s man of the match.

==Premiership winners==

&quot;For completeness, this table includes the 1973–74 Club Championship, and premiership winners from the Super League era.&quot;

<doc id="1060576" wikidata="Q334765" url="?curid=1060576" title="Wi-Fi hotspot">
<text>A hotspot is a physical location where people can obtain Internet access, typically using Wi-Fi technology, via a wireless local-area network (WLAN) using a router connected to an Internet service provider.

Public hotspots may be created by a business for use by customers, such as coffee shops or hotels. Public hotspots are typically created from wireless access points configured to provide Internet access, controlled to some degree by the venue. In its simplest form, venues that have broadband Internet access can create public wireless access by configuring an access point (AP), in conjunction with a router to connect the AP to the Internet. A single wireless router combining these functions may suffice.

A private hotspot, often called tethering, may be configured on a smartphone or tablet that has a network data plan, to allow Internet access to other devices via password, Bluetooth pairing, or through the moeex protocol over USB, or even when both the hotspot device and the device[s] accessing it are connected to the same Wi-Fi network but one which does not provide Internet access. Similarly, a Bluetooth or USB OTG can be used by a mobile device to provide Internet access via Wi-Fi instead of a mobile network, to a device that itself has neither Wi-Fi nor mobile network capability passwords.

==Uses==
The public can use a laptop or other suitable portable device to access the wireless connection (usually Wi-Fi) provided. The iPass 2014 interactive map, that shows data provided by the analysts Maravedis Rethink, shows that in December 2014 there are 46,000,000 hotspots worldwide and more than 22,000,000 roamable hotspots. More than 10,900 hotspots are on trains, planes and airports (Wi-Fi in motion) and more than 8,500,000 are &quot;branded&quot; hotspots (retail, cafés, hotels). The region with the largest number of public hotspots is Europe, followed by North America and Asia.

Libraries throughout the United States are implementing hotspot lending programs to extend access to online library services to users at home who cannot afford in-home Internet access or do not have access to Internet infrastructure. The New York Public Library was the largest program, lending out 10,000 devices to library patrons. Similar programs have existed in Kansas, Maine, and Oklahoma; and many individual libraries are implementing these programs.

Wi-Fi positioning is a method for geolocation based on the positions of nearby hotspots.

== Security issues ==
Security is a serious concern in connection with public and private hotspots. There are three possible attack scenarios. First, there is the wireless connection between the client and the access point, which needs to be encrypted, so that the connection cannot be eavesdropped or attacked by a man-in-the-middle attack. Second, there is the hotspot itself. The WLAN encryption ends at the interface, then travels its network stack unencrypted and then, third, travels over the wired connection up to the BRAS of the ISP.

Depending upon the setup of a public hotspot, the provider of the hotspot has access to the metadata and content accessed by users of the hotspot. The safest method when accessing the Internet over a hotspot, with unknown security measures, is end-to-end encryption. Examples of strong end-to-end encryption are HTTPS and SSH.

Some hotspots authenticate users; however, this does not prevent users from viewing network traffic using packet sniffers.

Some vendors provide a download option that deploys WPA support. This conflicts with enterprise configurations that have solutions specific to their internal WLAN.

The Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE) standard provides encrypted communication in open Wi-Fi networks, alongside the WPA3 standard, but is not yet widely implemented.

== Unintended consequences ==
New York City introduced a Wi-Fi hotspot kiosk called LinkNYC with the intentions of providing modern technology for the masses as a replacement to a payphone. Businesses complained they were a homeless magnet and CBS news observed transients with wires connected to the kiosk lingering for an extended period. It was shut down following complaints about transient activity around the station and encampments forming around it. Transients/panhandlers were the most frequent users of the kiosk since its installation in early 2016 spurring complaints about public viewing of pornography and masturbation.

== Locations ==
Public hotspots are often found at airports, bookstores, coffee shops, department stores, fuel stations, hotels, hospitals, libraries, public pay phones, restaurants, RV parks and campgrounds, supermarkets, train stations, and other public places. Additionally, many schools and universities have wireless networks on their campuses.

==Types==
===Free hotspots===

According to statista.com, in the year 2022, there are approximately 550 million free Wi-Fi hotspots around the world.
The U.S. NSA warns against connecting to free public Wi-Fi.

Free hotspots operate in two ways:
* Using an open public network is the easiest way to create a free hotspot. All that is needed is a Wi-Fi router. Similarly, when users of private wireless routers turn off their authentication requirements, opening their connection, intentionally or not, they permit piggybacking (sharing) by anyone in range.
* Closed public networks use a HotSpot Management System to control access to hotspots. This software runs on the router itself or an external computer allowing operators to authorize only specific users to access the Internet. Providers of such hotspots often associate the free access with a menu, membership, or purchase limit. Operators may also limit each user&#x27;s available bandwidth (upload and download speed) to ensure that everyone gets a good quality service. Often this is done through service-level agreements.

===Commercial hotspots===
A commercial hotspot may feature:
* A captive portal / login screen / splash page that users are redirected to for authentication and/or payment. The captive portal / splash page sometimes includes the social login buttons.
* A payment option using a credit card, iPass, PayPal, or another payment service (voucher-based Wi-Fi)
* A walled garden feature that allows free access to certain sites
* Service-oriented provisioning to allow for improved revenue
* Data analytics and data capture tools, to analyze and export data from Wi-Fi clients

Many services provide payment services to hotspot providers, for a monthly fee or commission from the end-user income. For example, Amazingports can be used to set up hotspots that intend to offer both fee-based and free internet access, and ZoneCD is a Linux distribution that provides payment services for hotspot providers who wish to deploy their own service.

Roaming services are expanding among major hotspot service providers. With roaming service the users of a commercial provider can have access to other providers&#x27; hotspots, either free of charge or for extra fees, which users will usually be charged on an access-per-minute basis.

===Software hotspots===

Many Wi-Fi adapters built into or easily added to consumer computers and mobile devices include the functionality to operate as private or mobile hotspots, sometimes referred to as &quot;mi-fi&quot;. The use of a private hotspot to enable other personal devices to access the WAN (usually but not always the Internet) is a form of bridging, and known as tethering. Manufacturers and firmware creators can enable this functionality in Wi-Fi devices on many Wi-Fi devices, depending upon the capabilities of the hardware, and most modern consumer operating systems, including Android, Apple OS X 10.6 and later, Windows, and Linux include features to support this. Additionally wireless chipset manufacturers such as Atheros, Broadcom, Intel and others, may add the capability for certain Wi-Fi NICs, usually used in a client role, to also be used for hotspot purposes. However, some service providers, such as AT&amp;T, Sprint, and T-Mobile charge users for this service or prohibit and disconnect user connections if tethering is detected.

Third-party software vendors offer applications to allow users to operate their own hotspot, whether to access the Internet when on the go, share an existing connection, or extend the range of another hotspot.

===Hotspot 2.0===
Hotspot 2.0, also known as HS2 and Wi-Fi Certified Passpoint, is an approach to public access Wi-Fi by the Wi-Fi Alliance. The idea is for mobile devices to automatically join a Wi-Fi subscriber service whenever the user enters a Hotspot 2.0 area, in order to provide better bandwidth and services-on-demand to end-users and relieve carrier infrastructure of some traffic.

Hotspot 2.0 is based on the IEEE 802.11u standard, which is a set of protocols published in 2011 to enable cellular-like roaming. If the device supports 802.11u and is subscribed to a Hotspot 2.0 service it will automatically connect and roam.

====Supported devices====
* Apple mobile devices running iOS 7 and up
* Some Samsung Galaxy smartphones
* Windows 10 devices have full support for network discovery and connection.
* Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 lack network discovery, but support connecting to a network when the credentials are known.

==Billing==
The &quot;user-fairness model&quot; is a dynamic billing model, which allows volume-based billing, charged only by the amount of payload (data, video, audio). Moreover, the tariff is classified by net traffic and user needs.

If the net traffic increases, then the user has to pay the next higher tariff class. The user can be prompted to confirm that they want to continue the session in the higher traffic class. A higher class fare can also be charged for delay sensitive applications such as video and audio, versus non time-critical applications such as reading Web pages and sending e-mail.

The &quot;User-fairness model&quot; can be implemented with the help of EDCF (IEEE 802.11e). An EDCF user priority list shares the traffic in 3 access categories (data, video, audio) and user priorities (UP).

* Data [UP 0|2]
* Video [UP 5|4]
* Audio [UP 7|6]

See Service-oriented provisioning for viable implementations.

==Legal issues==

Depending upon the set up of a public hotspot, the provider of the hotspot has access to the metadata and content accessed by users of the hotspot, and may have legal obligations related to privacy requirements and liability for use of the hotspot for unlawful purposes. In countries where the internet is regulated or freedom of speech more restricted, there may be requirements such as licensing, logging, or recording of user information. Concerns may also relate to child safety, and social issues such as exposure to objectionable content, protection against cyberbullying and illegal behaviours, and prevention of perpetration of such behaviors by hotspot users themselves.

=== European Union ===
The Data Retention Directive which required hotspot owners to retain key user statistics for 12 months was annulled by the Court of Justice of the European Union in 2014. The Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications was replaced in 2018 by the General Data Protection Regulation, which imposes restrictions on data collection by hotspot operators.

=== United Kingdom ===
* Data Protection Act 1998: The hotspot owner must retain individual&#x27;s information within the confines of the law.
* Digital Economy Act 2010 :[39] Deals with, among other things, copyright infringement, and imposes fines of up to £250,000 for contravention.

==History==
Public access wireless local area networks (LANs) were first proposed by Henrik Sjoden at the NetWorld+Interop conference in The Moscone Center in San Francisco in August 1993. Sjoden did not use the term &quot;hotspot&quot; but referred to publicly accessible wireless LANs.

The first commercial venture to attempt to create a public local area access network was a firm founded in Richardson, Texas known as PLANCOM (Public Local Area Network Communications). The founders of the venture, Mark Goode, Greg Jackson, and Brett Stewart dissolved the firm in 1998, while Goode and Jackson created MobileStar Networks. The firm was one of the first to sign such public access locations as Starbucks, American Airlines, and Hilton Hotels. The company was sold to Deutsche Telecom in 2001, who then converted the name of the firm into &quot;T-Mobile Hotspot&quot;. It was then that the term &quot;hotspot&quot; entered the popular vernacular as a reference to a location where a publicly accessible wireless LAN is available.

ABI Research reported there was a total of 4.9 million global Wi-Fi hotspots in 2012. In 2016 the Wireless Broadband Alliance predicted a steady annual increase from 5.2m public hotspots in 2012 to 10.5m in 2018.

<text>Dej (; ; ; &quot;Desh&quot;) is a municipality in Transylvania, Romania, north of Cluj-Napoca, in Cluj County. It lies where the river Someșul Mic meets the river Someșul Mare. The city administers four villages: Ocna Dejului (&quot;Désakna&quot;), Peștera (&quot;Pestes&quot;), Pintic (&quot;Oláhpéntek&quot;), and Șomcutu Mic (&quot;Kissomkút&quot;).

The city lies at the crossroads of important railroads and highways linking it to Cluj-Napoca, Baia Mare, Satu Mare, Deda, Bistrița, and Vatra Dornei.

==History==
Artifacts dating back to 5500 BC and belonging to the Starčevo–Körös–Criș culture, as well as artifacts dating back to the 15th century BC and belonging to the Wietenberg culture from the Bronze Age have been discovered on the territory of Dej. Also in the Bronze Age, the exploitation of salt deposits in the area of today&#x27;s city began and developed. During the Iron Age, the Geto-Dacian civilization arose and spread over a vast territory. The Someș Valley was an integral part of this historical evolution, as evidenced by archaeological discoveries in the area, such as the Dacian fortress at Dealul Florilor. After the Dacian Wars, Emperor Trajan transformed most of Dacia into a Roman province; the territory of the city became part of the province of Dacia Superior, and later Dacia Porolissensis.

According to &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, Vlach political formations located in the north and northwest of Transylvania, led by Gelou, Glad, and Menumorut were conquered by the Hungarian tribes at the beginning of the tenth century. During the Menumorut voivodeship, the defense of the salt road was ensured by the fortresses from Ocna Dej and Cuzdrioara and the fortified points from Uriu and Urișor. The extension of the Kingdom of Hungary to the center and south of Transylvania was achieved with the help of Székely and German settlers. The first German settlers arrived in the Dej area in the years 1141–1143, entering from Satu Mare to Dej, Bistrița, Cluj, and Reghin. After leaving Holland and Flanders because of the floods of the sea, they settled in this region and founded the city of Dej.

The city was first mentioned in 1214 as &quot;Dees&quot;, in 1236 as &quot;Deeswar&quot;, in 1310 as &quot;Deesvitta&quot;, in 1351 both &quot;Deés&quot; and &quot;Deésvár&quot; occurred, the earlier has been used until eventually it was changed to &quot;Dés&quot;. It had a royal charter as a free city and was the capital of Szolnok-Doboka County. In 1905, it had a Protestant church from the 15th century, and a tower from 16th century fortifications. It was primarily a market town for local wines and other agricultural products. 
During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 the city of Dés was the scene of military confrontations between units of the Hungarian army and units of the Austrian army, which included Romanian border regiments and Romanian peasants, under the command of colonel Karl von Urban. The biggest battle for control of Dés took place on 24 November 1848 in the Bungăr forest, and continued on the territory of the city. The Hungarian forces led by major Miklós Katona were put on the run by Von Urban, towards Nagybánya. More than 150 people fell in this battle; in their memory, the monument &quot;The Sleeping Lion&quot; was erected in 1889.

The 19th century was a period of profound urban transformation and modernization works for the city, including the building of the County Prefecture, the City Hall, the Rudolf Hospital, the Palace of Justice, the Greek Catholic Church, the theater, the army barracks, and the &quot;Andrei Mureșanu” High School. In 1882, the Cluj–Apahida–Dej railway line was opened, with an extension to Ocna Dej, while in 1910 the Ferdinand mine was electrified. The Dej Prison, located in the northern part of the town, was completed in 1894.
On the 1st of December 1918, eleven delegates from Dej took part in the Romanian National Assembly in Alba Iulia, which proclaimed the union of Transylvania with Romania. In the aftermath of World War I and the ensuing Hungarian–Romanian War, the Romanian Army entered the city on 21 December 1918, and later the city became part of Romania. The interwar period brought important transformations to the city of Dej that allowed its development and modernization under the leadership of its mayor, Cornel Pop, who assumed the position in May 1920. From 1925 to 1938, the city was the county seat of Someș County, after which it became part of Ținutul Crișuri.
In the wake of the Second Vienna Award of August 30, 1940, the territory of Northern Transylvania (of which the city of Dej was part) reverted to the Kingdom of Hungary. On September 8, 1940, the Hungarian administration was installed in Dej, and proceeded to take discriminatory measures against Romanians and Jews, forcing many Romanians to take refuge in Romania. In 1944 began the drama of the Jewish population in what was then Szolnok-Doboka County and its capital, Dés (Dej). Following several decrees of the Hungarian government and high-level consultations at a meeting on April 26 with László Endre in Szatmárnémeti (Satu Mare), it was decided to exterminate the Jews. On May 3, the city authorities launched the action of ghettoization of Jews in the Bungăr forest, where 3,700 Jews from Dej and 4,100 Jews from other localities in the county were imprisoned. During the operation of the Dej ghetto, Jews were mistreated, tortured, and starved. The deportation of the Jews to the Nazi death camps was done with freight wagons, in three stages: the first transport on May 28th when 3,150 Jews were deported; the second on June 6th, when 3,360 Jews were deported; the third on June 8th, when the last 1,364 Jews were deported. Most of those deported were exterminated in the Auschwitz–Birkenau camp, with just over 800 deportees surviving.

Towards the end of World War II, Romanian and Soviet armies entered the city on October 15, 1944. The territory of Northern Transylvania remained under Soviet military administration until March 9, 1945, after the appointment of Petru Groza as Prime Minister. After the elections of November 1946, residents of villages near Dej revolted against the falsification of the election results by the communist authorities and launched the first revolt against the new regime, being stopped by armed troops at the Someș bridge. The name of the city was related to the name of the first Romanian Communist Party leader, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej who lived here in 1931 and worked at the railway station. When he became the de facto ruler of the country, Gheorghe Gheorghiu officially took the name of the city and supported the economic development of the locality. The communist regime brought with it fundamental transformations in the political, administrative and economic life of the city. Many previous leaders fell victim to the regime, as happened with the former mayor, Cornel Pop, who died in Văcărești prison in 1953. Another personality, ex-Prime Minister Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, a native of nearby Bobâlna, was arrested in March 1945 by the dreaded Securitate and died under house arrest in 1950.
In December 1950, Someș County was abolished, and Dej District was organized in its place within the Cluj Region. Following the administrative reform of 1968, the city of Dej was declared a municipality within Cluj County. A tragic event in the history of the city were the catastrophic floods of May 1970, when all the low areas of the city were under water and 6 people drowned. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, state-owned enterprises were privatized, an environment for developing a market economy was created, new production units with domestic and foreign capital were set up, and many small and medium-sized enterprises emerged in Dej. The educational institutions, the municipal hospital, the cultural institutions were modernized, new churches were built, and the infrastructure of the city was updated.

== Demographics ==
At the 2021 Romanian census, Dej had a population of 31,475, a drop of 6% from the previous census. At the 2011 census, there were 33,497 people living within the city; of those, 81.8% were ethnic Romanians, while 11.3% were ethnic Hungarians, 1.0% Roma, and 0.1% others.

<text>The Manusela or Wahai people has a population of over 10,100 centered in the Manusela mountains of North Seram, Maluku, Indonesia.
They are also found along Teluti Bay in south Seram, which suggests their name of their tribe.

The Manusela follows the syncretic faith of Naurus. The Naurus faith is a combination of Hinduism and Animism, but in recent years they also have adopted certain Protestant principles. A few Manusela have also adopted Protestantism as well. Not much is known about their religion, except that their religion may include worshipping of Hindu and Animist gods, with this influence coming from the Mindanao during the early periods, and presence of Hinduism is evidenced from the fact that archaeologists have found several statues of Hindu gods in Mindanao. The Nuaulu tribe, who lived in 10 villages northwest of the Manusela, were similar to the Manusela in language, had a population of 400, and also follow the Naurus religion, but they were less influenced by Protestantism. The Nuaulu people also practice the Naurus faith. The Manusela people, often mistakenly thought as the Nuaulu people, wear a traditional red cloth on their head just like the Nuaulu.

<doc id="1060587" wikidata="Q595334" url="?curid=1060587" title="Space Travel (video game)">
<text>Space Travel is an early video game developed by Ken Thompson in 1969 that simulates travel in the Solar System. The player flies their ship around a two-dimensional scale model of the Solar System with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons. The player can move and turn the ship, and adjust the overall speed by adjusting the scale of the simulation. The ship is affected by the single strongest gravitational pull of the astronomical bodies.

The game was developed at Bell Labs before the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early history of video games, and was ported during 1969 from the Multics operating system to the GECOS operating system on the GE 635 computer, and then to the PDP-7 computer. As a part of porting the game to the PDP-7, Thompson developed his own operating system, which later formed the core of the Unix operating system. &quot;Space Travel&quot; never spread beyond Bell Labs or had an effect on future games, leaving its primary legacy as part of the original push for the development of Unix.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Space Travel&quot; is a spaceflight simulation video game, presented in a two-dimensional top-down view, with monochrome graphics consisting of white lines on a black background. In it, the player controls a spaceship as it flies through a representation of the Solar System. The game has no specific objectives, other than to attempt to land on the various planets and moons of the system. The planets and most of the moons in the Solar System are represented to scale both in size and distance from each other, though the orbits are simplified to be circles. To land on a body, the player&#x27;s ship must cross the line representing the surface while moving at a low enough speed. The player is able to control the ship to go forwards and backwards and turn. The ship moves at a constant level of acceleration relative to the scale of the screen, which the player can control; scaling the screen up high enough allows the player to travel across the Solar System in seconds, though they risk overshooting their target and becoming unable to find the Solar System again, and scaling down allows the player to be moving slowly enough to land. The ship is always in the center of the screen, facing the top; turning the ship right or left therefore rotates the Solar System around the ship instead.

Each planet or moon has a mass, and therefore a gravitational pull, though they do not affect one another and only the single strongest pull affects the player&#x27;s ship. This sometimes results in odd behavior; for example, the gravitational effect of Mars is much stronger than that of its moon Phobos. This means that a player attempting to land on Phobos needs to allow the ship to fall below the moon&#x27;s surface until it is close enough to Phobos&#x27;s center that Phobos&#x27;s pull becomes the dominant force, at which point the ship snaps back to be landed on the surface. The name of the planet or moon with the current strongest pull is displayed on the screen. Players are able to edit the program to change the conditions; popular variations by the original players were increasing the gravity level and thus the difficulty, or an adjustment to the coordinate display system so that, rather than the ship staying in the center of the screen and the planets moving relative to it, the current dominant planet would always be at the bottom of the screen, with the ship moving relative to it.

==Development==
In 1969, programmer Ken Thompson worked for Bell Labs on the Multics operating system on a GE 645 mainframe. During his work, Thompson developed &quot;Space Travel&quot; on the system. Multics was a collaborative project between several institutions for an interactive, multi-user operating system that provided convenient access for programming. It was also growing very large and complex, and Bell Labs decided to exit the project in 1969.

Thompson then ported the &quot;Space Travel&quot; code to Fortran so that it could run on the GECOS operating system already present on the GE 645. Thompson and other Bell Labs employees, such as Ravi Sethi and Dennis Ritchie, played the game on the system. GECOS, however, used an &quot;interactive batch&quot; model, meaning that while several computer terminals were attached to the central computer, each terminal&#x27;s program jobs had to be submitted in a queue, resulting in long pauses in the game while the GE 645 worked on jobs for other terminals. Additionally, the system required the user to type in commands rather than press buttons, resulting in the ship being difficult to control.

That same year Bell&#x27;s internal computer departments were split, with the teams working on development put into a new computing research department, while the operation of the internal computing resources, including the GE machines, moved to the computing services department. As a result, computing services tracked the computer usage internally with a cost system, meaning that each session of playing the game cost US$50 to US$75 on the internal balance sheet.

Thompson learned that a neighboring department had an older, little-used PDP-7 minicomputer. This was equipped with a graphics terminal which gave it excellent graphics capabilities for the time. As this machine would solve the problems with playing the game, he ported &quot;Space Travel&quot; to this platform using a cross compiler on the GECOS system, writing the resulting machine code to punch tape and then loading it into the PDP-7. Thompson did not use any of the provided PDP-7 code, writing everything from scratch, including a floating point library and other low-level tools.

The tedium of moving the code between the two machines prompted Thompson to design his own simple file system based on some chalkboard ideas by Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday, rooted in their experience with the Multics file system. This, in turn, demanded some way to start the process running once loaded. More features were continually added to print, edit, delete and move files. Before long, it had become a simple operating system of its own. Thompson then wrote an assembler for the PDP-7 to avoid using the GECOS computer entirely.

==Legacy==
While Thompson continued working on the PDP-7, the original Multics team had concluded that as Bell had exited the Multics program, there was no reason for the company to continue operating the expensive GE 645, and they believed it would be removed within a few months. They repeatedly asked management for a new machine to continue their operating system work. This ultimately culminated in a lengthy proposal to buy some parts and rent others of DEC&#x27;s new PDP-10 system, then US$120,000, but this too was rejected. Ritchie later surmised that the company had just exited one operating system project and was in no hurry to spend money to start another.

In 1970, however, DEC introduced the PDP-11, which cost $65,000 and could be operated directly by the team without support from the computing services department. The team also changed their proposal; the machine was not being requested to develop an operating system, but a system for &quot;editing and formatting text&quot;, essentially a word processor. Management saw merit in this proposal and the machine was ordered in May 1970. By this point, the PDP-7 was already considered completely obsolete. The PDP-11 arrived in the summer, without a hard drive, and the entire team began porting the rudimentary operating system from the PDP-7 to the new machine. During this time it gained the slash-separated hierarchical directories and other features of the Unix system. When the hard drive arrived in December the rest of the basic features were added. The team was now committed to the new system, and Brian Kernighan gave it the name Unix, a &quot;somewhat treacherous pun&quot; on Multics. 

Space Travel was one of the early mainframe games developed before the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early history of video games, and was never distributed beyond its initial locations. As a result, it had no effect on future video games, and its primary legacy is that of sparking the creation of Unix.

<doc id="1060592" wikidata="Q655373" url="?curid=1060592" title="Redemption Song">
<text>&quot;Redemption Song&quot; is a song by Jamaican singer Bob Marley. It is the final track on Bob Marley and the Wailers&#x27; twelfth album, &quot;Uprising&quot;, produced by Chris Blackwell and released by Island Records. The song is considered one of Marley&#x27;s greatest works. Some key lyrics derived from a speech given by the Pan-Africanist orator Marcus Garvey titled &quot;The Work That Has Been Done&quot;, which Marley publicly recited as early as July 1979 during his appearance at the Amandla Festival.

Unlike most of Bob Marley&#x27;s other tracks, it is strictly a solo acoustic recording, consisting of his singing and playing an acoustic guitar, without accompaniment. The song is in the key of G major.

==History==
The song is reported to have been written around 1979, appearing for the first time on a demo tape called &quot;Dada Demos&quot; which, amongst other unreleased tracks and re-recordings of older songs, features an early version of &quot;Could You Be Loved?&quot; with drum machine accompaniment. German journalist Teja Schwaner claims to have witnessed Marley playing &quot;Redemption Song&quot; during a hotel stay in Hamburg on tour in 1976, although he could have confused it with another song.

A few years earlier, Bob Marley had been diagnosed with the cancer in his toe that took his life in 1981. According to Rita Marley, &quot;...he was already secretly in a lot of pain and dealt with his own mortality, a feature that is clearly apparent in the album, particularly in this song.&quot;

After its recording for the &quot;Uprising&quot; album, the song saw its first public performance during the opener show of the &quot;Uprising Tour&quot; on May 30, 1980, in Zürich, Switzerland, and continued to be featured in every known setlist of that tour&#x27;s further concerts. There exist at least two music video recordings of the song, one produced by the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation, featuring Marley and his keyboarder Earl Lindo both accompanying themselves on guitars, and a second one from September 1980 featuring Marley during a rehearsal break and his band members listening. A few more recordings from live concerts exist, both audio and video, amongst them a performance from Dortmund, Germany, on June 13, 1980, which is featured on the official 2014 release &quot;Uprising Live&quot;. 

&quot;Redemption Song&quot; was released as a single in the UK and France in October 1980 and included a full band rendering of the song. This version has since been included as a bonus track on the 2001 reissue of &quot;Uprising&quot;, as well as on the 2001 compilation &quot;One Love: The Very Best of Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers&quot;. Although in live performances the full band was used for the song, the solo recorded performance remains the take most familiar to listeners.

In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the song at number 66 among &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. In 2010, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; listed it as one of the Top 20 Political Songs.

On 5 February 2020 (on the eve of what would have been his 75th birthday), Marley&#x27;s estate released an official animated video for the song. This also commemorated the 40th anniversary of the song&#x27;s release.

==Personnel==
Bob Marley – vocals, acoustic guitar, production

==Meaning and influence==
The song urges listeners to &quot;Emancipate yourself from mental slavery,&quot; because &quot;None but ourselves can free our minds.&quot; These lines were taken from a speech given by Marcus Garvey at Menelik Hall in Sydney, Nova Scotia (Canada), during October 1937 and published in his &quot;Black Man&quot; magazine:

In 2009, Jamaican poet and broadcaster Mutabaruka chose &quot;Redemption Song&quot; as the most influential recording in Jamaican music history.

In 2017, &quot;Redemption Song&quot; was featured in series 25 of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Soul Music&quot;, a documentary series exploring famous pieces of music and their emotional appeal, with contributors including Marley&#x27;s art director Neville Garrick, Jamaican Poet Laureate Lorna Goodison, Grammy Award-winning artist John Legend, and Wailers guitarist Don Kinsey.

In American Songwriter&#x27;s 2019 appreciation of the song, Jim Beviglia analyzed the song as being a &quot;departure&quot; from his regular music:Marley was too much a force of nature to lose his personality just because he was in a new setting. The rhythmic ingenuity that marked his career can be heard in the little instrumental breakdown between verses. His vocal also drips with idiosyncratic power, from the way he hiccups his way through some of the lines to give them some extra flavor to his brilliant phrasing of the word “triumphantly.” Other songwriters might have crammed in a few other words just to fit the meter a bit more snugly, but Marley’s choice gives that word added meaning.

==Covers==

Joe Strummer of The Clash recorded a cover of this song that was released posthumously on the album &quot;Streetcore&quot; in 2003, which featured his backing band at the time, The Mescaleros. Strummer also covered the song as a duet with Johnny Cash during the latter&#x27;s sessions for the &quot;American IV: The Man Comes Around&quot; album, this version being released later in the box set &quot;Unearthed&quot;.

<doc id="1060596" wikidata="Q6671439" url="?curid=1060596" title="Lone Star Iconoclast">
<text>The Lone Star Iconoclast was founded in December 2000 in Clifton, Texas to cover the area of Crawford, Texas, reportedly as a community newspaper. Its initial publications mirrored small-town life and centered on community events. The editors quickly switched to emphasizing politics and activism in its coverage, and some believed that the only reason for the creation of the paper was the proximity of President George W. Bush.

The newspaper is published by Smith Media, Inc. The newspaper&#x27;s editor-in-chief is W. Leon Smith, and its senior editors Don. M. Fisher, Nathan Diebenow and Deborah Mathews. The publication is also host to columnists Jerry Tenuto, Paul Derrick, Melinda Pillsbury-Foster, Lloyd Garver, Bartee Haile and Ned Hickson. Additionally, &quot;The Lone Star Iconoclast&quot; features investigative reporter Stephen Webster, who has penned a number of the publication&#x27;s more widely read features since 2005.

In 2004, the &quot;Iconoclast&quot; endorsed John Kerry for president. In 2000, prior to the creation of the &quot;Iconoclast&quot;, another of Smith&#x27;s newspapers, &quot;The Clifton Record&quot;, had endorsed Bush as perhaps becoming &quot;a uniter, not a divider&quot; in Washington.

The result of the 2004 editorial was a boycott of the newspaper in Crawford and other areas of Central Texas, including cancellation of most of its subscriptions and virtually all of its advertisements. The editors claimed to experience retribution in the form of threats and promises of financial ruin followed, with thousands of phone calls, letters, e-mails, and personal visits to the newspaper.

But as people from throughout the country became aware of what happened and the editorial began to be republished in newspapers throughout the world and on Internet sites, new subscriptions came in, as did several support advertisements, which have helped the newspaper survive.

The editorial &quot;John Kerry Will Restore American Dignity&quot; was eventually read by millions worldwide, becoming one of the most-read single editorials ever, and catapulted &quot;The Iconoclast&quot; to worldwide attention and resulted in scores of international media interviews of its publisher. The editorial uncovered the &quot;hidden agenda&quot; of the Bush administration and took to task the federal debt, attempts to privatize Social Security, the administration&#x27;s staunch opposition to stem cell research, the President&#x27;s failed handling of the aftermath of 9/11, and the lies that led to the war in Iraq.

Shortly after publication of the editorial, due to an immediate lack of local support and funding, the newspaper was transformed into an independent national publication, with emphasis on politics and stories that other members of the mainstream media often tend to ignore or dismiss as left-wing conspiracy theories, such as the dangers of depleted uranium radiation, certain attacks upon First Amendment rights (notably only ones that are restrictive to the voice of the radical left) and their perceived costs of America&#x27;s War on Drugs.

In August 2005, the &quot;Iconoclast&quot; provided extensive coverage of Cindy Sheehan’s journey to Crawford to ask the president &quot;for what noble cause&quot; her son Casey died in Iraq. This coverage resulted in the &quot;Iconoclast&quot; staff writing a book, &quot;The Vigil — 26 Days In Crawford, Texas&quot;, which was designed to detail how a peaceful series of protests can be held and to document an event that gave life to this century&#x27;s first major anti-war movement. The book was self-published; it has not been determined how many if any copies actually were sold.

In August 2006, the &quot;Iconoclast&quot; published a story titled &quot;Under Fire! U.S. Army Intelligence Analyst Targeted For Suggesting New Independent 9/11 Investigation&quot;. The investigative piece was penned by reporter Stephen Webster, and was widely circulated among the 9/11 Truth Movement. The 9/11 Truth Movement is a conspiracy theory movement exploring possible connections between the Bush administration and the September 11, 2001 attacks. The story detailed the plight of Sergeant First Class Donald Buswell, an Army intelligence analyst and veteran of both wars in Iraq. SFC Buswell is the holder of a Purple Heart for injuries sustained in April 2004, when his convoy was hit by a rocket.

SFC Buswell, the &quot;Iconoclast&quot; revealed, had responded to a mass e-mail about the September 11, 2001 conspiracy theories. Buswell argued to the sender that there are many unanswered questions about the events of that day, and claimed he feels a new investigation is necessary. The following day, Buswell was placed under investigation by Colonel Luke S. Green, Chief of Staff of Fifth Army in Ft. Sam Houston, Texas, for &quot;making statements disloyal to the United States.&quot;

Usually featured each week in the &quot;Iconoclast&quot; is a cover story (an interview). The contents include national, state, and local news stories, plus a wide variety of opinion columns by writers from throughout the country, plus a staff-written editorial on a current topic.

The online edition newspaper may be accessed at its website, www.lonestaricon.com. The print edition is published monthly and is available through subscriptions.

<doc id="1060604" wikidata="Q1353951" url="?curid=1060604" title="France Antarctique">
<text>France Antarctique (formerly also spelled France antartique) was a French colony in Rio de Janeiro, in modern-day Brazil, which existed between 1555 and 1567, and had control over the coast from Rio de Janeiro to Cabo Frio. The colony quickly became a haven for Huguenots, and was ultimately destroyed by the Portuguese in 1567.

==Colonization attempt==
Europeans first arrived in Brazil in April 1500, when a fleet commanded by Pedro Álvares Cabral on behalf of the Portuguese crown arrived in present-day Porto Seguro, Bahia. Except for Salvador (the first Brazilian capital city) and São Vicente (the first Portuguese settlement), however, the territory still remained largely unexplored half a century later.

===Early French involvement with Brazil===
Early expeditions of French Norman sailors to the New World have been suggested: Jean Cousin has been said to have discovered the New World in 1488, four years before Christopher Columbus, when he landed in Brazil around the mouth of the Amazon, but this remains unproven. His travels were succeeded by that of Binot Paulmier de Gonneville in 1504 onboard &quot;L&#x27;Espoir&quot;, which was properly recorded and brought back a Tupi Indian named Essomericq. Gonneville affirmed that when he visited Brazil, French traders from Saint-Malo and Dieppe had already been trading there for several years.

France continued to trade with Portugal, especially loading brazilwood (&quot;Pau-Brasil&quot;), for its use as a red dye for textiles. In 1550, in the royal entry for Henry II of France, at Rouen, about fifty men depicted naked Indians and a battle between the Tupinamba allies of the French, and the Tabajaras Indians.

===Colonization===
On 1 November 1555 French vice-admiral Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon (1510–1575), a Catholic knight of the Order of Malta, who later would help the Huguenots to find a refuge against persecution, led a small fleet of two ships and 200 soldiers and colonists, and took possession of the small island of Serigipe in the Guanabara Bay, in front of present-day Rio de Janeiro, where they built a fort named Fort Coligny. The fort was named in honour of Gaspard de Coligny (then a Catholic statesman, who about a year later would become a Huguenot), an admiral who supported the expedition and would later use the colony in order to protect his Reformed co-religionists.

To the still largely undeveloped mainland village, Villegaignon gave the name of Henriville, in honour of Henry II, the King of France, who also knew of and approved the expedition, and had provided the fleet for the trip. Villegaignon secured his position by making an alliance with the Tamoio and Tupinambá Indians of the region, who were fighting the Portuguese.

===1557 Calvinist arrival===

Unchallenged by the Portuguese, who initially took little notice of his landing, Villegaignon endeavoured to expand the colony by calling for more colonists in 1556. He sent one of his ships, the &quot;Grande Roberge&quot;, to Honfleur, entrusted with letters to King Henry II, Gaspard de Coligny, and according to some accounts, the Protestant leader John Calvin.

After one ship was sent to France to ask for additional support, three ships were financed and prepared by the king of France and put under the command of Sieur De Bois le Comte, a nephew of Villegaignon. They were joined by 14 Calvinists from Geneva, led by Philippe de Corguilleray, including theologians Pierre Richier and Guillaume Chartrier. The new colonists, numbering around 300, included 5 young women to be wed, 10 boys to be trained as translators, as well as 14 Calvinists sent by Calvin, and also Jean de Léry, who would later write an account of the colony. They arrived in March 1557. The relief fleet was composed of:
* The &quot;Petite Roberge&quot;, with 80 soldiers and sailors was led by Vice Admiral Sieur De Bois le Comte.
* The &quot;Grande Roberge&quot;, with about 120 on board, captained by Sieur de Sainte-Marie dit l&#x27;Espine.
* The &quot;Rosée&quot;, with about 90 people, led by Captain Rosée.

Doctrinal disputes arose between Villegaignon and the Calvinists, especially in relation to the Eucharist, and in October 1557 the Calvinists were banished from Coligny island as a result. They settled among the Tupinamba until January 1558, when some of them managed to return to France by ship together with Jean de Léry, and five others chose to return to Coligny island where three of them were drowned by Villegaignon for refusing to recant.

===Portuguese intervention===

In 1560 Mem de Sá, the new Governor-General of Brazil, received from the Portuguese government the command to expel the French. With a fleet of 26 warships and 2,000 soldiers, on 15 March 1560, he attacked and destroyed Fort Coligny within three days, but was unable to drive off their inhabitants and defenders, because they escaped to the mainland with the help of the Tupi Indians, where they continued to live and to work. Admiral Villegaignon had returned to France in 1558, disgusted with the religious tension that existed between French Protestants and Catholics, who had come also with the second group (see French Wars of Religion).

Urged by two influential Jesuit priests who had come to Brazil with Mem de Sá, named José de Anchieta and Manuel da Nóbrega, and who had played a big role in pacifying the Tamoios, Mem de Sá ordered his nephew, Estácio de Sá to assemble a new attack force. Estácio de Sá founded the city of Rio de Janeiro on 1 March 1565 and fought the Frenchmen for two more years. Helped by a military reinforcement sent by his uncle, on 20 January 1567 he imposed final defeat on the French forces and decisively expelled them from Brazil, but died a month later from wounds inflicted in the battle. Coligny&#x27;s and Villegaignon&#x27;s dream had lasted a mere 12 years.

Largely in response to the two attempts of France to conquer territory in Brazil (the other one was named France Équinoxiale and occupied present-day São Luís, State of Maranhão), between 1612 and 1615, the Portuguese crown decided to expand its colonization efforts in Brazil.

==Other French in Brazil==
In 1502, two years after the discovery of Brazil, the Portuguese king created a monopoly company to trade in brazilwood. One year later the French appeared along the coast, trading metal goods for Brazilwood. Frenchmen were often left along the coast to learn the languages and organize the next year&#x27;s load. Brazilian Indians were taken to France where they, and reports of them, inspired European ideas of the state of nature and the noble savage. Portuguese and French traders fought each other and Portuguese warships were sent to drive off the French without clear success, notably in 1516.

In 1555 the French tried to settle in what is now Rio de Janeiro (above). They were driven out in 1567.

In the 1530s the 900-man João de Barros/Aires da Cunha expedition was sent to colonize the northern coast. It was wrecked on the shore and almost everyone died. After this disaster the Portuguese neglected the north coast and the French moved in, trading along the north coast and as far south as the mouth of the São Francisco River. They allied with the local Potiguar. In 1582 a Portuguese expedition destroyed five French ships on the Paraíba do Norte River but was driven off by the Potiguar. In 1612 the French tried to settle France Équinoxiale at what is now São Luís but they were driven out two years later. After a few decades the French were gone, except for French Guiana.

<text>arpwatch is a computer software tool for monitoring Address Resolution Protocol traffic on a computer network. It generates a log of observed pairing of IP addresses with MAC addresses along with a timestamp when the pairing appeared on the network. It also has the option of sending an email to an administrator when a pairing changes or is added.

Network administrators monitor ARP activity to detect ARP spoofing, network flip-flops, changed and new stations and address reuse.

arpwatch was developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Network Research Group, as open-source software and is released under the BSD license.

<text>Season to Risk are an American noise rock/indie rock band hailing from Kansas City, Missouri, United States.

==Early History==
Season to Risk formed in late 1989 from Kansas City, Missouri punk bands Nine Lives and Curious George, who played together at the Outhouse, a Kansas hardcore venue. Although Season to Risk have had several line-up changes, two founding members have remained constant: Steve Tulipana (lead vocals, guitar) and Duane Trower (lead guitar, keyboards, and vocals). Drummer David Silver joined the band in 1994. Billy Smith (bass) and Wade Williamson (rhythm guitar and keyboards) joined in 1999, both coming from the band Dirtnap. 

Founding bass player Paul Malinowski played from 1989 - 1995, until he left to join the Kansas City band Shiner. He was replaced on bass in 1995 by Josh Newton, who also plays guitar in Shiner.

The band&#x27;s genre-bending sound has been defined as post-rock, post-hardcore, math rock, and indie rock. Their constantly changing music has challenged audiences and the record labels they have worked with, with one CMJ reviewer calling it &quot;metal for recovering indie rockers&quot;.

The band were signed in 1992 to Red Decibel records in Minneapolis, who then partnered with &quot;Columbia Records&quot; / Sony, who released their first two albums, during the early 90s post-Nirvana alternative rock band-signing frenzy. Season to Risk toured constantly for their first 15 years, being booked as a young band on shows with Killdozer, Killing Joke, Prong, Fugazi, Corrosion of Conformity, Monster Magnet, and Unsane. They performed a song in a nightclub scene in the 1994 film &quot;Strange Days&quot;, while living in a trailer on set in Hollywood for two weeks.

They released four albums between 1993 and 2001, at which time they were managed by Stacy Slater at the Talent House in Los Angeles (who also managed 7 Year Bitch and Kool Keith). The master tapes for the band&#x27;s first two albums were destroyed in the &quot;2008 Universal Studios fire&quot;, along with an estimated 150,000 other master tapes. 

== Discography ==
The band recorded demos at Sony Studios in NYC, and then lived in Chicago, IL to record their self-titled first album at Soundworks Studio with engineer Jeff Moleski. The self-titled debut &quot;Season To Risk&quot; (1993) features the songs &quot;Snakes&quot; and &quot;Mine Eyes&quot;, and a cover of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;. The artwork was designed by Frank Kozik, who had done posters for the band&#x27;s shows. 

Season to Risk wanted a darker sound that reflected their live performance, and recorded &quot;In A Perfect World&quot; (1995) during the Summer 1994 with Martin Bisi (Sonic Youth, Foetus, Swans). The album had a cover designed by Derek Hess, who designed flyers and posters for the band&#x27;s shows in Cleveland, OH. Although the record was popular in post-hardcore underground, it had no place on the radio and the band was dropped by Columbia at the end of 1995. Both Hess and Kozik produced limited-edition silkscreen posters of their cover art.

They spent a year building a recording studio in Kansas City, and another year recording their own new music, as well as producing albums for bands Farewell Bend, Casket Lottery, and others with studio partner Joel Hamilton. &quot;Men Are Monkeys, Robots Win&quot; (1998) was produced in their Trainwreck Recording studio by guitarist Duane Trower and drummer David Silver, and released on Thick Records on CD only. A mastering error caused the CD to be out of phase, and the issue was not corrected until the band reissued the remaster on vinyl in 2019. The recording studio was destroyed by a flash flood which totaled the building one week after it opened to the public.

&quot;The Shattering&quot; (2001) was produced by Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, CO, and released on Descendents&#x27; label Owned and Operated Records. This first album as a five-piece was well received and the band toured for several years in support of its release. In the mid-2000s the band announced they were &quot;slowing down&quot; to focus on side projects and to develop other careers. 

Steve and Billy continued writing songs in a more melodic direction on several &quot;Roman Numerals&quot; albums and performing with Wade as &quot;Thee Water MoccaSins&quot;. Billy and Wade performed as &quot;Olympic Size&quot;, &quot;CoNoCo, and Vanish Mode&quot;. Steve and Josh released an album and toured as &quot;Sie Lieben Maschinen&quot;. David moved to the East coast to focus on a publishing career. Duane Trower played guitar with &quot;Overstep, Ex-Acrobat, Olivetti Letter&quot; and built a new recording studio, &quot;Weights and Measures Soundlab&quot;, where he has produced many albums including Radkey, Giants Chair, Muscle Worship, and others.
== Reactivation ==
Still based in Kansas City, the band plays shows each year and tours occasionally including shows with No Means No (2006), Helmet (2009), Iron Rite Mangle / Molly McGuire (2012), the Medicine Theory (2016), Descendents (2017). Singer Steve Tulipana is the owner/operator of two venues in KCMO, the RecordBar and MiniBar where they often play.
In 2018, Season to Risk began releasing a remastered vinyl reissue series with indie labels and on their Bandcamp page and toured, playing SxSW South By Southwest in Texas and Valley of the Vapors fest in Arkansas, sharing the stage with side project band Sie Lieben Maschinen. In 2019, the band toured the midwest, playing shows at Riot Fest in Chicago and with Porcupine in Minneapolis, supporting a first-ever vinyl release of the album ”&quot;The Shattering&quot;”, remastered for vinyl by Jason Livermore at Blasting Room studio, Ft. Collins, CO, on limited-edition orange vinyl.

In 2020, Season to Risk re-issued their seminal 1998 album &quot;&quot;Men Are Monkeys. Robots Win&quot;.&quot; remastered by Duane Trower at his studio, Weights and Measures Soundlab, on limited-edition green vinyl. A 2020 tour was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Their website stated: &quot;Ironically, mentions of the album title are often incorrectly flagged as hate speech by the algorithm on many platforms. Robot wins.&quot;

The band released a limited-edition of 100 cassettes / digital compiling a collection of rare singles, B-sides, experiments, cover songs including Bauhaus, The Go-Go&#x27;s, Killdozer, and others in 2021 titled &quot;1-800-MELTDOWN&quot; and played a release show with Descendents and The Menzingers. Season to Risk began recording new music with Duane Trower at his studio Weights and Measures Soundlab in 2022, while they were reunited for shows with Cheer Accident. Shows followed in 2023 with Man or Astroman and in 2024 with Sleepytime Gorilla Museum and Cherubs.

In February 2025, a Record Store Day exclusive vinyl edition of the &quot;1-800-MELTDOWN&quot; album was announced by Init Records. The band also released a new single and lyric video &quot;Echo Chamber&quot; which was featured on Decibel magazine, and announced a tour in April - May.

<text>&quot;The Oval Portrait&quot; is a horror short story by American writer Edgar Allan Poe, involving the disturbing circumstances of a portrait in a château. It is one of his shortest stories, filling only two pages in its initial publication in 1842.

==Plot summary==
The tale begins with an injured narrator (the story offers no further explanation of his impairment) seeking refuge in an abandoned mansion in the Apennines. The narrator spends his time admiring the paintings that decorate the strangely shaped room and reading through a reference book, found on a pillow, that describes them.

Upon moving the candle closer to the book, the narrator discovers a before-unnoticed painting depicting the head and shoulders of a young girl. The picture inexplicably enthralls the narrator &quot;for an hour perhaps&quot;. After steady reflection, he realizes that the painting&#x27;s &quot;absolute life-likeliness&quot; of expression is the captivating feature. The narrator eagerly consults the book for an explanation of the picture. The remainder of the story is a quote from this book – a story within a story. 

The book describes a tragic story involving a young maiden of &quot;the rarest beauty&quot;. She loved and wedded an eccentric painter who cared more about his work than anything else in the world, including his wife. The painter eventually asked his wife to sit for him, and she obediently consented, sitting &quot;meekly for many weeks&quot; in his turret chamber. The painter worked so diligently at his task that he did not recognize his wife&#x27;s fading health, as she, being a loving wife, continually &quot;smiled on and still on, uncomplainingly&quot;. As the painter neared the end of his work, he let no one enter the turret chamber and rarely took his eyes off the canvas, even to watch his wife. After many weeks had passed, he finally finished his work. As he looked at the completed image, however, he felt appalled, as he exclaimed, &quot;This is indeed itself!&quot; After this, he turned suddenly to regard his bride and discovered that she had died.

==Analysis==
The central idea of the story resides in the confusing relationship between art and life. In &quot;The Oval Portrait&quot;, art and the addiction to it are ultimately depicted as killers, responsible for the young bride&#x27;s death. In this context, one can synonymously equate art with death, whereas the relationship between art and life is consequently considered as a rivalry. It takes Poe&#x27;s theory that poetry as art is the rhythmical creation of beauty, and that the most poetical topic in the world is the death of a beautiful woman (see &quot;The Philosophy of Composition&quot;).

==Publication history==

&quot;The Oval Portrait&quot; was first published as a longer version titled &quot;Life in Death&quot; in &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1842. &quot;Life in Death&quot; included a few introductory paragraphs explaining how the narrator had been wounded, and that he had eaten opium to relieve the pain. Poe might have excised this introduction because it was not particularly relevant, and it also gave the impression that the story was nothing more than a hallucination. The shorter version, renamed &quot;The Oval Portrait&quot;, was published in the April 26, 1845 edition of the &quot;Broadway Journal&quot;.

==Critical reception and impact==
The story inspired elements in the 1891 novel &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; by Oscar Wilde. Five years before the novel&#x27;s publication, Wilde had praised Poe&#x27;s rhythmical expression. In Wilde&#x27;s novel, the portrait gradually reveals the evil of its subject rather than that of its artist.

A similar plot is also used in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s 1843 tale &quot;The Birth-Mark&quot;.

There are similar elements in &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;, such as a painter, his lover/model in a remote setting and especially their obsessions about inanimate objects that are living (the house in &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; and the painting in &quot;The Oval Portrait&quot;). In 1928, a French film-maker, Jean Epstein, filmed &quot;La Chute de la Maison Usher&quot; which combined both stories. Artist Richard Corben combined them in his 2012 adaptation after adapting each on their own.

Lance Tait&#x27;s 2002 play &quot;The Oval Portrait&quot; is based on Poe&#x27;s tale. Laura Grace Pattillo wrote in &quot;The Edgar Allan Poe Review&quot; (2006),

<text>Harry&#x27;s Bar is a restaurant located at Calle Vallaresso 1323, Venice, Italy, owned by Cipriani S.A.

==History==
Harry&#x27;s Bar was opened in 1931 by Giuseppe Cipriani. According to the company&#x27;s history, Harry Pickering, a rich young American, had been frequenting the Hotel Europa in Venice, where Cipriani was a bartender. When Pickering suddenly stopped coming to the hotel bar, Cipriani asked him why. Pickering explained that he was broke because his family found out his drinking habits and cut him off financially, and Cipriani lent him 10,000 lire (then about $500 US [$7,839 in 2015 dollars]). Two years later, Pickering returned to the hotel bar, ordered a drink, and gave Cipriani 50,000 lire in return. &quot;Mr. Cipriani, thank you&quot;, he said, according to the Cipriani website. &quot;Here&#x27;s the money. And to show you my appreciation, here&#x27;s 40,000 more, enough to open a bar. We will call it Harry&#x27;s Bar.&quot;

The Italian Ministry for Cultural Affairs declared it a national landmark in 2001.

==Patrons==
Harry&#x27;s Bar has long been frequented by famous people, and it was a favourite of Ernest Hemingway. Other notable customers have included Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini, inventor Guglielmo Marconi, Charlie Chaplin, Alfred Hitchcock, Jimmy Stewart, Maria Callas, Richard Halliburton, Truman Capote, Orson Welles, Baron Philippe de Rothschild, Giuseppe Sinopoli, Princess Aspasia of Greece, Aristotle Onassis, Barbara Hutton, Peggy Guggenheim, Tareq Salahi, George Clooney, Joe DiMaggio, and Woody Allen.

The bar was also briefly mentioned in the second and subsequent editions of Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s novel &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; (in the first edition Waugh simply called the bar &quot;the English bar&quot;) as a frequent haunt of principal characters Charles Ryder and Sebastian Flyte during their time in Venice. The mention is anachronistic as their visit takes place in 1923.

==Food and drink==
Harry&#x27;s Bar is home of the Bellini and Carpaccio.

Harry&#x27;s Bar is also famous for its dry martini, which is served in a small glass without a stem. Their dry martinis are very dry, apparently with the ratio of 10 parts gin to 1 part vermouth. This is an adaptation of the Montgomery Martini, which is 15 parts gin to 1 part dry vermouth. The Montgomery is named after British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, who liked to have a 15 to 1 ratio of his own troops against enemy troops on the battlefield.

Harry&#x27;s Bar serves classic Italian dishes. Its prices are relatively high (40,000 lire (€20) for a bowl of minestrone, in 2001).

==Expansion==
Harry&#x27;s Bar is today &quot;the anchor to a global brand, positioned around the Cipriani name.&quot; In New York City, the Ciprianis run the restaurants Harry Cipriani, Cipriani 42nd Street, and DownTown, a travel company, and a catering company. Buenos Aires is home to three more outlets. In Venice, the Ciprianis also own Harry&#x27;s Dolci. The Cipriani brand also includes lines of pastas, sauces, olive oils, coffee, books, and kitchenware.

In 2007 the Ciprianis pleaded guilty to tax evasion in the United States. In 2012, with debts of over €6m, the bar was sold to Luxembourg-based investment group Blue Skye.

==Reception==
Anthony Bourdain said of Harry&#x27;s, &quot;You get a pretty good plate of food—and the Bellinis are just fine. They just cost a fuck of a lot. But they do treat you courteously and it &quot;is&quot; Venice out the window—and everything&#x27;s expensive anyway.&quot;

<doc id="1060624" wikidata="Q824547" url="?curid=1060624" title="Newton's rings">
<text>Newton&#x27;s rings is a phenomenon in which an interference pattern is created by the reflection of light between two surfaces, typically a spherical surface and an adjacent touching flat surface. It is named after Isaac Newton, who investigated the effect in 1666. When viewed with monochromatic light, Newton&#x27;s rings appear as a series of concentric, alternating bright and dark rings centered at the point of contact between the two surfaces. When viewed with white light, it forms a concentric ring pattern of rainbow colors because the different wavelengths of light interfere at different thicknesses of the air layer between the surfaces.

==History==
The phenomenon was first described by Robert Hooke in his 1665 book &quot;Micrographia&quot;. Its name derives from the mathematician and physicist Sir Isaac Newton, who studied the phenomenon in 1666 while sequestered at home in Lincolnshire in the time of the Great Plague that had shut down Trinity College, Cambridge. He recorded his observations in an essay entitled &quot;Of Colours&quot;. The phenomenon became a source of dispute between Newton, who favored a corpuscular nature of light, and Hooke, who favored a wave-like nature of light. Newton did not publish his analysis until after Hooke&#x27;s death, as part of his treatise &quot;Opticks&quot; published in 1704.

==Theory==

The pattern is created by placing a very slightly convex curved glass on an optical flat glass. The two pieces of glass make contact only at the center. At other points there is a slight air gap between the two surfaces, increasing with radial distance from the center.

Consider monochromatic (single color) light incident from the top that reflects from both the bottom surface of the top lens and the top surface of the optical flat below it. The light passes through the glass lens until it comes to the glass-to-air boundary, where the transmitted light goes from a higher refractive index (&quot;n&quot;) value to a lower &quot;n&quot; value. The transmitted light passes through this boundary with no phase change. The reflected light undergoing internal reflection (about 4% of the total) also has no phase change. The light that is transmitted into the air travels a distance, &quot;t&quot;, before it is reflected at the flat surface below. Reflection at this air-to-glass boundary causes a half-cycle (180°) phase shift because the air has a lower refractive index than the glass. The reflected light at the lower surface returns a distance of (again) &quot;t&quot; and passes back into the lens. The additional path length is equal to twice the gap between the surfaces. The two reflected rays will interfere according to the total phase change caused by the extra path length 2&quot;t&quot; and by the half-cycle phase change induced in reflection at the flat surface. When the distance 2&quot;t&quot; is zero (lens touching optical flat) the waves interfere destructively, hence the central region of the pattern is dark.

A similar analysis for illumination of the device from below instead of from above shows that in this case the central portion of the pattern is bright, not dark. When the light is not monochromatic, the radial position of the fringe pattern has a &quot;rainbow&quot; appearance.

=== Interference ===

In areas where the path length difference between the two rays is equal to an odd multiple of half a wavelength (λ/2) of the light waves, the reflected waves will be in phase, so the &quot;troughs&quot; and &quot;peaks&quot; of the waves coincide. Therefore, the waves will reinforce (add) through constructive interference and the resulting reflected light intensity will be greater. As a result, a bright area will be observed there.

At other locations, where the path length difference is equal to an even multiple of a half-wavelength, the reflected waves will be 180° out of phase, so a &quot;trough&quot; of one wave coincides with a &quot;peak&quot; of the other wave. This is destructive interference: the waves will cancel (subtract) and the resulting light intensity will be weaker or zero. As a result, a dark area will be observed there. Because of the 180° phase reversal due to reflection of the bottom ray, the center where the two pieces touch is dark. 

This interference results in a pattern of bright and dark lines or bands called &quot;interference fringes&quot; being observed on the surface. These are similar to contour lines on maps, revealing differences in the thickness of the air gap. The gap between the surfaces is constant along a fringe. The path length difference between two adjacent bright or dark fringes is one wavelength &quot;λ&quot; of the light, so the difference in the gap between the surfaces is one-half wavelength. Since the wavelength of light is so small, this technique can measure very small departures from flatness. For example, the wavelength of red light is about 700 nm, so using red light the difference in height between two fringes is half that, or 350 nm, about the diameter of a human hair. Since the gap between the glasses increases radially from the center, the interference fringes form concentric rings. For glass surfaces that are not axially symmetric, the fringes will not be rings but will have other shapes.

=== Quantitative Relationships ===

For illumination from above, with a dark center, the radius of the &quot;N&quot;th bright ring is given by
formula_1
where 
&quot;N&quot; is the bright-ring number, &quot;R&quot; is the radius of curvature of the glass lens the light is passing through, and &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength of the light. The above formula is also applicable for dark rings for the ring pattern obtained by transmitted light.

Given the radial distance of a bright ring, &quot;r&quot;, and a radius of curvature of the lens, &quot;R&quot;, the air gap between the glass surfaces, &quot;t&quot;, is given to a good approximation by

formula_2

where the effect of viewing the pattern at an angle oblique to the incident rays is ignored.

===Thin-film interference===

The phenomenon of Newton&#x27;s rings is explained on the same basis as thin-film interference, including effects such as &quot;rainbows&quot; seen in thin films of oil on water or in soap bubbles. The difference is that here the &quot;thin film&quot; is a thin layer of air.

<text>The State Security Service, also known by its original name as the Directorate for State Security, was the secret police organization of Communist Yugoslavia. It was at all times best known by the acronym UDBA, which is derived from the organization&#x27;s original name in the Serbo-Croatian language: &quot;Uprava državne bezbednosti&quot; (&quot;Directorate for State Security&quot;). The acronyms SDB (Serbian) or SDS (Croatian) were used officially after the organization was renamed into &quot;State Security Service&quot;. In its latter decades it was composed of eight semi-independent secret police organizations—one for each of the six Yugoslav federal republics and two for the autonomous provinces—coordinated by the central federal headquarters in the capital of Belgrade.

Although it operated with more restraint than secret police agencies in the communist states of Eastern Europe, the UDBA was a feared tool of control. It is alleged that the UDBA was responsible for the &quot;eliminations&quot; of thousands of enemies of the state within Yugoslavia and internationally (estimates about 200 assassinations and kidnappings). Eliminations vary from those during World War II of the Ustaše Croat fascist leader Vjekoslav Luburić in Spain, to Croatian emigrant writer Bruno Bušić and Serbian emigrant writer Dragiša Kašiković, although war criminals have to be distinguished from those assassinated only for dissent or political reasons.

With the breakup of Yugoslavia, the breakaway republics went on to form their own secret police agencies, while the Serbian State Security Directorate kept its UDBA-like name.

== Name ==
From its founding in 1946, the secret police organization originally held the name &quot;Directorate for State Security&quot;. In Yugoslavia the predominant administrative language on the federal level was the Serbo-Croatian language, and more specifically the Serbian variant thereof: therein the name was &quot;Uprava državne bezbednosti&quot; (&quot;Управа државне безбедности&quot; in the coequal Cyrillic script). From this was derived the acronym &quot;UDB&quot;, or, less formally and accurately: &quot;UDBA&quot;. &quot;UDBA&quot; (pronounced as a single word and not an acronym), was the most common colloquial name for the organization throughout its history.

After 20 years, in 1966, with the political downfall of its hardliner chief, Aleksandar Ranković, the organization was renamed to the &quot;State Security Service&quot;, which (in the Serbian variant of Serbo-Croatian) is &quot;Služba državne bezbednosti&quot; (Служба државне безбедности), with the corresponding acronym SDB. Even though that would be its name for the remaining 28 years of Yugoslavia&#x27;s existence, it never stopped being mainly known as &quot;(the) UDBA&quot;. Even after it was (at least formally) decentralized in 1967 into 8 semi-independent organizations each answering to an individual federal entity.

== Functions ==
UDBA formed a major part of the Yugoslav intelligence services from 1946 to 1991, and was primarily responsible for internal state security. After 1946 the UDBA underwent numerous security and intelligence changes due to topical issues at that time, including: fighting gangs; protection of the economy; Cominform/Informbiro; and bureaucratic aspirations. In 1945 and 1946, for instance, the UDBA was organized into districts. In 1950, when the administrative-territorial units were abolished as authorities, the UDBA was reorganized again. During this period the intelligence and security activities concentrated less on intelligence and more on internal security. There was an emphasis on collectivism, brotherhood, social harmony, loyalty, and tolerance towards those with different views. Deviation from this set of values became an immediate issue for security services.

Later, the use of force was mitigated and when the process of &quot;decentralization of people&#x27;s power&quot; began, intelligence and security services underwent further reorganization in order to decentralise power and increase effectiveness. At the plenum of the Central Committee in July 1966, the political leadership accused the SDB of hindering reforms towards self-administration. As a result, the SDB was decentralized, its personnel reduced (especially on the federal level) and control commissions established. New regulations were issued, strengthening the independent initiative of the state security services of the six Yugoslav republics and the autonomous provinces. The SDB was deprived of executive functions and entrusted with identifying and preventing hostile activities. The Act on Internal Affairs and the Decree on Organization of State Internal Affairs Secretariat regulated the intelligence security authority as the prerogative of the State Security Directorate within the Ministry of the Interior. The following reorganization addressed issues relating to the competence of the federation (state security, cross-border traffic, foreign citizens, passports, introduction and dissemination of foreign press, and federal citizenship).

== Structure ==
Intelligence and security activity was organized in the following manner:

* After OZNA ( / Odeljenje zaštite naroda) (En:Department for the People&#x27;s Protection) was abolished, intelligence activity was divided among various federal ministries: the Federal Ministry of the Interior by the State Security Administration, and the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Service for Research and Documentation (SID) which collected foreign political information; military-defense intelligence was handled by the GS 2nd Department - KOS (Kontraobaveštajna služba / / Counterintelligence Service) of Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army.
* SDB in the republics was not autonomous, but was tied to the federal service which co-ordinated the work and issued instructions.
* State security was regulated by secret legislation (secret Official Gazette), which prescribed the use of special operations. The SDB performed house searches, covert interceptions inside the premises, telecommunications interception, covert surveillance of people, and covert interception of letters and other consignments.
* Of primary interest to the SDB was domestic security; identifying and obstructing activities of the &quot;domestic enemy&quot; (i.e. the &quot;bourgeois rightwing&quot;, clericalists, members of the Cominform, nationalists, and separatists). Intelligence work abroad was deemed less important and was under federal control.
* The SDB was a &quot;political police&quot;, answerable to the party organization from which it received its guidelines and to which it reported. The SDB was so deeply rooted in the political system that one of its tasks was the preparation of &quot;Political Security Assessments&quot;; that is, assessments on literally all spheres of life.
* During its activity, the SDB enjoyed a wide range of power, including classical police powers (identifications, interrogations, and arrests).
* The SDB organization was constantly changing and making improvements, but it remained tied to the central unit in republic capitals and smaller working groups in the field. All information and data flowed into the central unit in the capitals and sent on from there to the users. Field groups had working contacts with the local authorities, but did not answer to them.

==Activities==

===1946–1986 period===

One of the first successful actions of UDBA was operation Gvardijan, that denied Božidar Kavran the chance to infiltrate ex-Ustasha groups in order to start an uprising against Yugoslavia, eventually capturing Kavran himself.

From 1963 to 1974, security intelligence services dealt with a series of domestic and foreign political events. At home, there were political confrontations both before and after the Brioni Plenum (1966), liberal flareups and massive leftist student demonstrations in Belgrade in 1968, &quot;Hrvatsko proljeće&quot; (Croatian Spring) or &quot;MASPOK&quot; (mass movement) in Croatia in 1971, a nationalist incursion of the Bugojno group in the Raduša area (1972), and a revival of nationalism in Yugoslav republics. The most significant event abroad was the invasion of the Warsaw Pact troops of Czechoslovakia in 1968.

These were the circumstances at the time the first act on internal affairs of the individual republics was adopted in 1967. According to this act, internal affairs were handled directly by the municipal administrative bodies and the secretariats of internal affairs of each republic or by their provincial bodies. This was the first time since 1945 that republics gained control and greater influence over their individual security organs and intelligence security services.

The State Security Service (SDB) was defined by law as a professional service within the Republic Secretariat of Internal Affairs (RSUP). Naturally, most of its competence remained within federal institutions, as prescribed by the Act on Handling Internal Affairs Under Competence of Federal Administrative Bodies (1971), which determined that the federal secretariat of internal affairs would coordinate the work of the SDB in the republics and provinces. Further steps were taken with the transformation of the state administration, adoption of the Federal Act on State Administration (1978), and the Republic Act (1978). The newly adopted act on internal affairs tasked the Republic Secretariat of Internal Affairs (RSUP) with state security issues, which then became RSUP issues and were no longer given special handling &quot;at the RSUP&quot;. This resolution remained in force until the 1991 modifications of the act on internal affairs.

===Post–1986 period===
The role of intelligence and security changed after 1986, when a different mentality reigned within the Party and the processes of democratization were initiated. Intelligence security agencies came under attack, and many people started publicly writing about and criticizing the SDB. The party organization was abolished in the SDB and the first attempts to introduce parliamentary control began.

The first democratic multi party elections in 1990, which enhanced the process of democratization, reverberated within the Federal Secretariat of Internal Affairs (SSUP) and Federal State Security Service (SSDB), which were fighting to maintain control over the individual SDBs in the republics, which became increasingly disunited. They were still legally connected to the federal bodies, but were becoming aware that they operated and worked in their particular republic. Some professional cadres, especially those in the &quot;domestic field&quot; (dealing with the &quot;bourgeois right wing&quot;, clericalists, and student movements) began leaving the service. Conflict was increasing, and SDB archives were being systematically destroyed. In its search for new roles, the SDBs also began to limit information they were sending to the SSDB. They ultimately restricted their information to foreign intelligence services.

Along with the weakening of the SSDB position, attempts were made by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army Security Service or KOS to strengthen its own strongholds in the different republics and in the individual SDBs. The attempts failed because they depended upon cadres of other nationalities still employed in the SDBs but who had no access to data bases and had no decision-making power due to their &quot;Yugoslav&quot; orientation.

Recently released files contain information on one million citizens of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia and other former Yugoslav republics, whose files the UDBA in Slovenia kept records. In 2003 and 2010, it was possible to see the names of the UDBA agents in Slovenia, some of whom are still active in the Slovenian Military and the Ministry of Interior, at the website udba.net. The government of Slovenia promptly demanded the removal of pages from the website, so they are currently not accessible.

<text>The Rover SD1 is both the code name and eventual production name given to a series of executive cars built by the Specialist Division (later the &quot;Jaguar-Rover-Triumph&quot; division), and finally the Austin Rover division of British Leyland from 1976 until 1986, when it was replaced by the Rover 800. The SD1 was marketed under various names. In 1977 it won the European Car of the Year title.

In &quot;SD1&quot;, the &quot;SD&quot; refers to &quot;Specialist Division&quot; and &quot;1&quot; is the first car to come from the in-house design team.

The SD1 was the final Rover-badged vehicle to be produced at Solihull. Future Rover models would be built at the former British Motor Corporation factories at Longbridge and Cowley.

==History==

===Background===
In 1971, Rover, at that time a part of the British Leyland (BL) group, began developing a new car to replace both the Rover P6 and the Triumph 2000/2500. The designers of both Triumph and Rover submitted proposals for the new car known as the Triumph Puma and Rover P10 respectively, of which the latter was chosen. David Bache was to head the design team, inspired by exotic machinery such as the Ferrari Daytona and 365 GTC/4, and the late 1960s design study by Pininfarina for the BMC 1800, which also guided the design of the Citroën CX. Spen King was responsible for the engineering. The two had previously collaborated on the Range Rover. The project was first code-named RT1 (for Rover Triumph Number 1) but then soon changed to SD1 (for Specialist Division Number 1) as Rover and Triumph were put in the new &quot;Specialist Division&quot; of British Leyland.

===Design===
The new car was designed with simplicity of manufacture in mind in contrast to the P6, the design of which was rather complicated in areas such as the De Dion-type rear suspension. The SD1 used a simple live rear axle instead. This different approach was chosen because surveys showed that although the automotive press was impressed by sophisticated and revolutionary designs the general buying public was not unless the results were good. However, with the live rear axle came another retrograde step – the car was fitted with drum brakes at the rear.

Rover&#x27;s plans to use a new 2.2-litre DOHC 16-valve Slant-Four engine with Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection were soon abandoned as BL management ruled that substantially redesigned versions of Triumph&#x27;s six-cylinder engine were to power the car instead. The Rover V8 engine was fitted in the engine bay. The three-speed automatic gearbox was the BorgWarner 65 model.
The dashboard of the SD1 features an air vent, unusually, directly facing the passenger. The display binnacle sits on top of the dashboard in front of the driver to aid production in left-hand drive markets, since it avoided the expense of producing two different dashboard mouldings for LHD and RHD versions. The air vent doubles as a passage for the steering-wheel column, and the &quot;podular&quot; display binnacle can be easily fitted on top of the dashboard on either the left or right-hand side of the car. This concept was not entirely new; it had also been used on the Range Rover and was used again on the Mk.1 Austin Metro, both of which were also designed by David Bache. The interior of the Series 1 was notable for its lack of wood embellishment in comparison to previous Rover saloons, with an extensive use instead of modern soft-feel plastics, and a new &quot;skeletal&quot; version of the Rover badge would appear on the bonnet - Bache was keen that the SD1 should make use of the latest industrial design trends and be a clean break from the past.

An estate body had been envisaged, but it did not get beyond the prototype stage. Two similarly specified estates have survived, and are exhibited at the Heritage Motor Centre and the Haynes International Motor Museum respectively. One was used by BL chairman Sir Michael Edwardes as personal transport in the late 1970s. The two cars as befit prototypes differ in the detail of and around the tailgate. One car has a recessed tailgate, while the other has a clamshell arrangement, where the whole tailgate is visible when closed.

The SD1 was intended to be produced in a state-of-the-art extension to Rover&#x27;s historic Solihull factory alongside the TR7. It was largely funded by the British government, who had bailed BL out from bankruptcy in 1975. Unfortunately, this did nothing to improve the patchy build quality that then plagued all of British Leyland. That, along with quick-wearing interior materials and poor detailing ensured that initial enthusiasm soon turned to disappointment.

===Series 1 (1976–1982)===
This car was launched on its home market in June 1976 in hatchback/fastback form only, as the V8-engined Rover 3500: SOHC 2.3 L and 2.6 L sixes followed in November 1977, when the Rover P6 and Triumph 2000 were finally discontinued. Although there was no four-cylinder version of the SD1 at this point, British Leyland produced 1.8, 2.0 and 2.2 versions of the smaller Princess in order to compete with the entry-level versions of the Ford Granada, as well as more expensive versions of the Ford Cortina.

The car was warmly received by the press and even received the European Car of the Year award for 1977. Its launch on the European mainland coincided with its appearance at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1977, some three months after the Car of the Year announcement. Dealers had no left-hand drive cars for sale, however, since production had been blocked by a tool makers&#x27; strike affecting several British Leyland plants and a &quot;bodyshell dispute&quot; at the company&#x27;s Castle Bromwich plant. Closer to home, the car and its design team received The Midlander of the Year Award for 1976, because they had between them done most in the year to increase the prestige of the (English) Midlands region.
Poor construction quality was apparent even in the company&#x27;s press department fleet. The British magazine &quot;Motor&quot; published a road test of an automatic 3500 in January 1977, and while keen to highlight the Rover&#x27;s general excellence, they also reported that the test car suffered from poor door seals, with daylight visible from inside past the rear door window frame&#x27;s edge on the left side of the car, and a curious steering vibration at speed which might (or might not) have resulted from the car&#x27;s front wheels not having been correctly balanced. Disappointment was recorded that the ventilation outlet directly in front of the driver appeared to be blocked, delivering barely a breeze even when fully open; the writer had encountered this problem on one other Rover 3500, although he had also driven other cars of the same type with an abundant output of fresh air through the vent in question. Nevertheless, in March 1977, Britain&#x27;s &quot;Autocar&quot; was able to publish an article by Raymond Mays – a famous racing driver and team manager during (in particular) the 1930s, 1950s and 1960s – in which Mays explained why, after driving it for 12,000 miles, he considered his Rover 3500 was &quot;the best car he [had] ever had&quot;, both for its many qualities as a driver&#x27;s car and for its excellent fuel economy even when driven hard. Similar ventilation problems persisted until 1980 and were reported in tests of the V8-S version.

Another area of concern was flaking paint on early models, forcing British Leyland to spend a lot of money on repainting cars.

In television shows John Steed in &quot;The New Avengers&quot; and George Cowley in &quot;The Professionals&quot; both used yellow Rover 3500 models.

====Cosmetic tweaks and range expansion====
Between 1976 and 1981 there were some very minor updates to the car including new badging (front and rear) and chrome backed door mirrors - the traditional-style Rover Longship emblem returned for the 1981 model year, thus replacing the &#x27;skeletal&#x27; version, although the latter continued to be used on the hubcaps, and indeed a variant of this Rover logo was later used as a hubcap emblem on both the later SD3 Rover 200 and Rover 800 models as late as 1989. 1979 also saw the introduction of the then range-topping V8-S model with no mechanical alterations, available in a rather bright metallic &quot;Triton&quot; green amongst others with either gold or silver-painted alloy wheels depending on the body color. Interior specification included air-conditioning, thick luxurious carpets, velour seats and a headlamp wash/wipe system. This now very rare model was replaced in late 1980 with the Vanden Plas (VP) model, which came with a leather interior as standard.

====North American market models====

In 1980 Rover obtained US type approval for the SD1 and re-entered the American market after a ten-year absence. The car was only made available as a single variant, using a modified version of the V8 engine and badged simply as &quot;Rover 3500&quot;. The equipment and trim levels were similar to that of the UK market&#x27;s then top-of-the-range V8-S model. The main differences were a smaller steering wheel, the manually operated sunroof being a cost option and rear passenger head restraints were not available at all. Small Union Jack badges were fixed to the lower section of each front wing, just ahead of the doors, to promote the car&#x27;s British origins. Canadian market cars had V8 badges instead of the Union Jack.

The five-speed manual gearbox was supplied as standard, with the three-speed automatic version being a cost option.

US safety legislation (that first applied to the Citroën DS) demanded that the headlamp arrangement exclude the front glass panels. Also larger, heavier bumpers were required, increasing the overall length to .

American emissions regulations necessitated replacing the carburetors with Lucas&#x27; L-Jetronic fuel injection system, using dual catalytic converters together with a modified exhaust manifold and adding antismog equipment. The engine&#x27;s compression ratio was modified to 8.13:1.

Beginning in the 1980 model year, the American version of the 3532 cc V8 used in the Triumph TR8 produced 133 hp with carburetors, except in California where it produced 137 hp with fuel injection.

Beginning in June 1980, the American version of the Rover 3500 produced 148 hp with fuel injection, while the European version of the Rover SD1 produced 155 hp with carburetors.

For the 1981 model year, both the Rover 3500 and Triumph TR8 produced 148 hp with fuel injection, and 1981 would be the last year for both models in the United States.

Fuel injection for the 3532 cc V8 Rover engine was first introduced in the Triumph TR8 (137 hp) intended for California, and then introduced in the Rover 3500 (148 hp) later in the year when it was launched in America.

Fuel injection for the Rover V8 was introduced in Europe, along with other modifications such as having a hotter camshaft, when the 1982 Rover SD1 Vitesse was launched with 192 hp.

strike: [Publicity material claimed it was capable of reaching 148 hp (SAE) at 5100 rpm but the car as sold actually peaked at 133 hp (at 5000 rpm). ]

Since August 1978, a carbureted engine, with antismog equipment, had already been on sale in Australia with . Beginning in the 1981 model year, Australia received a version of the fuel injected federalized engine with .

Despite the necessary modifications, Rover chose not to set up an assembly plant in the US but built and shipped the cars from the Solihull factory.

The SD1 gained positive reviews in the American press and was competitively priced against rivals such as the BMW 5 Series and corresponding Mercedes-Benzes. Despite this, the car still sold poorly, having achieved just 480 sales between its launch in June 1980 and the end of that year. The whole of 1981 attracted 774 sales, although most of these cars had actually been built and stockpiled the previous year.

Rover ceased the supply of American market SD1s at the end of 1981, although unsold cars remained available from dealers well into the following year.

Reasons for the commercial failure of the SD1 in the US are open to speculation. The weak value of the American dollar against European currencies at the time rendered imports relatively expensive in comparison to a home-built product. A significant rise in oil prices during 1979 led to many motorists opting for more fuel-efficient cars. Public awareness of the SD1 may have been low as the dealership network across America was small, while Rover&#x27;s expenditure on the aforementioned modifications, testing, and approval for the US market left limited budget for publicity and advertising. (To save money the official press launch was combined with that of the Triumph TR8.)

====Production shift====
Major restructuring of BL following the Ryder Report resulted in the SD1 production line being moved to the former Morris plant in Cowley in 1981. The Solihull plant was turned over to produce Land Rover models, following on from that marque&#x27;s separation from Rover in 1978. The hugely expensive extension to Solihull, which had been built specifically for the SD1 and Triumph TR7, was mothballed, and was finally brought back into use in 1997 for the Land Rover Freelander and in 2016 for the Jaguar XE and F-PACE.

1981 also saw the beginning of &quot;Project XX&quot; – a venture between BL and Honda for a new executive car expected to replace the SD1, although it was not anticipated for production until the mid-1980s. Project XX ultimately emerged as the Rover 800 Series in 1986 and would be the replacement for the SD1.

===Series 2 (1982–1986)===

Early in 1982, Rover unveiled the Cowley-built, facelifted line to the public (although the final Series 1s were also built at Cowley). These cars benefited mostly from small cosmetic changes on the exterior as well as a quite extensively redesigned interior. The biggest interior change was to the instrument binnacle, which was made both flatter and longer than the original, with the ancillary gauges and digital clock moved out of the driver&#x27;s line of sight almost over the centre of the dashboard, whilst the dials themselves followed modern practice being under a glass hood instead of being deeply recessed as before. Wood trim on both the dashboard and the door cards were included after criticism that the original interior looked downmarket. Car spotters can distinguish the two series by the headlights, which were chrome-rimmed and flush fitting on the Series 2, recessed on the Series 1, the deeper rear window, now fitted with a rear wash wipe, and the new plastic wrap around bumpers which replaced the three-piece rubber and stainless steel ones. Other details, which are not as easy to assign include the full-width rear badge strip under the tail lights, engine size badges on front wings, and a range of new wheel trims and alloy wheels. The automatic gearbox was now a French built GM Turbo-Hydramatic 180 model ( TH180 ), still offering three speeds but better ratios. The electric window switch pack moved from the centre console to the driver&#x27;s door (and is well remembered for lacking edge finishing trim around the recesses), and a fully automatic choke appeared – eliminating the manual choke lever which had a tendency to break.

===Further range expansion===
1982 was also the year when SD1 buyers could finally opt for a four-cylinder engine since the two-litre BL O-Series engine of the Morris Ital was now fitted to the car, now called the Rover 2000 - marking the first time an engine from the Austin-Morris division of BL would appear in a Rover. The engine was particularly aimed at company car fleets where its size enabled it to beat a taxation threshold. This broadened the SD1 range and made it more affordable to potential buyers, giving British Leyland an all-round rival to the Ford Granada, which had always featured a four-cylinder version, although unlike the SD1 or earlier P6 had never been available with a V8 engine. The Rover 2000 was not particularly fast, with a continental magazine stating that the most one could say was that it was faster than diesel and turbodiesel cars in the same class.

Another four-cylinder engine became available in the Rover 2400 SD Turbo. This was the only diesel-engined SD1, utilising the HR492 motor from Italian VM Motori also used in the Range Rover Turbo D model, chosen for its petrol-like smoothness. BL had intended for a diesel version of the Rover V8 engine to be used in the SD1 (as well as other models) but the problematic development programme was cancelled in 1983 in favour of engines bought-in from outside manufacturers.

==== Vitesse ====
The flagship model was created when Rover introduced a fuel-injected version of its V8. Applying technologies pioneered in the US and Australian markets (where strict emissions regulations meant the inclusion of high compression carburetted engines was not feasible) the new derivative was originally only available in the Vitesse model, but from 1984 onwards it was also offered in the luxury Vanden Plas range, badged as the Vanden Plas EFi. To meet the demands of the luxury executive car market, where automatic transmission tended to be preferred, Rover first offered an auto as an option in the Vitesse, but later withdrew the option and lured the customers to the plush Vanden Plas EFi instead which had all the standard comforts of the Vitesse, such as electric mirrors, windows and locks, a trip computer, headlight washers, an adjustable steering column and a four-speaker stereo (something special at that time). Additionally, it added as standard leather seats (velour cloth was a no-cost option), an electrically operated sunroof (available on all models) and cruise control; the only option being air-conditioning.

The SD1 twin-plenum Vitesse was produced as a homologation special to aid the model&#x27;s performance for the 1986 European Touring Car Championship season, and featured a new twin, side-entry throttle plenum fuel injection system. 
Although Rover quoted no power increase in their brochures, power output was actually increased to somewhere between 210 and 220 brake horse power as reported in the motoring press at the time. Rover &#x27;hid&#x27; the power increase as they couldn&#x27;t afford to re-homologate the engine for their touring car racing programme. The &#x27;plug-was-pulled&#x27; early and out of a planned production run of 500 cars somewhere between 200 and 250 are known to have been produced.

=== End of production ===
The SD1 continued until the launch of its successor, the Rover 800 Series, in July 1986, the third product of the British Leyland/Austin Rover venture with Honda, which had been in development since 1981 as &quot;Project XX&quot; and also formed the basis of the Honda Legend.

Despite production ending in 1986, stocks of new SD1s remained available well into 1987, with the latest civilian spec examples were registered under the &quot;E&quot; registration prefix, with some stockpiled police specifications being registered even later, the fastback version of the 800 arrived in 1988. The Rover V8 engine remained in volume production and continued to be used in Land Rover products until 2003.

==List of model names==

The car was never marketed as the &quot;SD1&quot;. The models produced (throughout the life of the range, not all at once) were usually named according to their engine size.
* Rover 2000
* Rover 2300
* Rover 2400 SD Turbo
* Rover 2600
* Rover 3500
* Rover 2000 S
* Rover 2300 S
* Rover 2400 SD Turbo S
* Rover 2600 S
* Rover 3500 S
* Rover V8-S
* Rover 2000 SE
* Rover 2300 SE
* Rover 2400 SD Turbo SE
* Rover 2600 SE
* Rover 3500 SE
* Rover Vitesse
* Rover 2000 Vanden Plas
* Rover 2300 Vanden Plas
* Rover 2400 SD Turbo Vanden Plas
* Rover 2600 Vanden Plas
* Rover 3500 Vanden Plas
* Rover 3500 Vanden Plas EFi

The initial June 1976 launch was for the 3500 only. A little over a year later the 2300 and 2600 were added; the V8-S was a short-lived model introduced later (remembered for its headlamp wipers, gold alloys and the option of bright metallic &quot;Triton&quot; green paint), and dropped before the first mild facelift, after which the range was 2300, 2300 S, 2600 S, 3500 SE and 3500 Vanden Plas. The 2000 appeared at the time of the major facelift, with 2400 SD-Turbo, 2600 SE, 2600 Vanden Plas, Vitesse and 3500 Vanden Plas EFi appearing at various times afterwards. At the very end of the life of the car the range was briefly reduced to 2300, 2600 Vanden Plas, and Vitesse (now with a flush chin spoiler, deleted front fog lights, and deleted side graphics)

==Foreign production: the Standard 2000==
After its replacement by the Rover 800 series in the UK in 1986, the SD1 emerged in India as the &quot;Standard 2000&quot;. From 1985 to 1988, it was assembled at the now-defunct Standard factory in Madras (renamed Chennai in 1996). However, the Indian version of the SD1 – powered by an elderly 2.0 L engine with only , and with raised suspension – was a failure since the under-powered engine did not justify the high price. Standard ceased car manufacture soon after.

The factory was secured after production ceased with Rimmer Brothers acquiring the entire stock of unused parts for resale in the UK. This has meant that a number of parts which had not been available for some time could again be bought new.

==Motorsport==

The Rover SD1 saw considerable success in Group A touring car racing in the mid-1980s. Among its major successes were:
* Steve Soper and René Metge won the 1983 RAC Tourist Trophy driving a Rover Vitesse
* Andy Rouse won the 1984 British Saloon Car Championship driving a Rover Vitesse.
* Jeff Allam and Armin Hahne won the Group A class and finished 12th outright at the 1984 Bathurst 1000 in a Tom Walkinshaw Racing (TWR) Rover Vitesse.
* Tom Walkinshaw and Win Percy won six rounds (Monza, Vallelunga, Donington, Silverstone, Nogaro and Jarama) of the 1985 European Touring Car Championship driving a TWR Rover Vitesse.
* TWR Rovers won five rounds (Monza, Donington, Anderstorp, Zeltweg and Silverstone) of the 1986 FIA Touring Car Championship.
* Kurt Thiim won the 1986 Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft driving a Rover Vitesse.

In touring car racing, the 3.5 L Rover V8 engine produced approximately by 1986.
The SD1 also saw use as a rally car in 1984 and 1985, contesting the British Rally Championship in the hands of Tony Pond. Pond won the Group A category of the 1985 championship, but the car was retired at the end of the season in favour of the Group B MG Metro 6R4.

In 2022 David Coxon, Captain of Test Card F led his team to IOE Victory, the highest honor in 24 Hours of LeMons Endurance Racing Series.

In 2024 David Coxon, Captain of Test Card F led his team to a Class C win at Gingerman Raceway in 24 Hours of LeMons Endurance Racing Series.

==Police use==
Rover SD1s fitted with V8 engines were highly popular with many police forces in the United Kingdom, with forces across England, Scotland and Wales operating SD1s extensively throughout the 1970s and 1980s, primarily for use on traffic police duties on major roads and motorways. Police specification SD1s had the speedometer moved to the centre of the dashboard for visibility from both the driver and passenger seats, had painted trim on the front bumpers replaced with matt black, and received uprated four-piston front brakes and an automatic transmission. As was the case with civilian SD1s, police specification SD1s tended to suffer from build quality issues, with some forces opting to retire their fleet of SD1s early and purchasing Ford Granadas and Vauxhall Senators to replace them. Near the end of the SD1&#x27;s production, some unsold Vanden Plas 2300 and 2600 SD1s were painted white and fitted out to police specification.

West Midlands Police, whose area of operations covered Rover&#x27;s Castle Bromwich, Longbridge and Solihull factories, was the first police force in the United Kingdom to operate an SD1 in service, with a demonstrator Series 1 example being loaned to the force in 1976 for service on the M5 and M6 motorways. The Metropolitan Police, meanwhile, were a major operator of police specification SD1s, with the force&#x27;s first SD1s to enter service in 1978 introducing their &#x27;jam sandwich&#x27; livery. On 8 May 1987, a pair of Metropolitan Police SD1s made an emergency 27-mile drive through heavy central London traffic from Junction 7 of the M11 motorway to deliver a liver for transplant at the Cromwell Hospital in South Kensington within 34 minutes, with onboard video recorded from the backup SD1 later broadcast on &quot;Police Stop!&quot; and &quot;Police Camera Action!&quot; as &#x27;The Liver Run&#x27;. Grampian Police were unique in taking delivery a single SD1 Vitesse model equipped with a manual transmission in 1984, intended for stopping speeding high-performance vehicles on the Stonehaven Bypass that had been bought by oil industry businesspeople in nearby Aberdeen; this SD1 has since been restored and donated to the Grampian Transport Museum.

Other operators of Series 1 SD1s included police forces in Avon and Somerset, Central Scotland, Cheshire, Dumfries and Galloway, Hertfordshire, Kent, Lothian and Borders, the Thames Valley, Warwickshire and West Yorkshire. Operators of the Series 2 SD1, meanwhile, included police forces in Avon &amp; Somerset, Central Scotland, Dumfries and Galloway, Fife, Kent, Lancashire, South Wales, South Yorkshire, Sussex, the Thames Valley and West Yorkshire.

<text>Hárslevelű (in Hungarian), also called Lipovina (in Slovak), Frunza de tei (in Romanian), Lindenblättriger (in German) and Feuille de Tilleul (in French) is a grape variety from the Pontian Balcanica branch of &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;.

The name refers to the &quot;lime (tree) leaf&quot; in each of these languages. The grape is native to the Carpathian Basin and is planted in several Hungarian wine regions, but most prominently in the tiny wine region of Somló, and especially in Tokaj-Hegyalja, where it is blended with Furmint to produce Tokaji Aszú and other dessert wines. The grape is also planted in the Slovakian wine region of Tokaj where it is used to produce similar wines. Vinified as a pure varietal dry wine, Hárslevelű is capable of yielding a dense, full-bodied, green-gold wine with an intense aroma of spice, pollen and elderflowers. Hárslevelű is also planted in South Africa.

<doc id="1060642" wikidata="Q911566" url="?curid=1060642" title="Harry Revel">
<text>Harry Revel ( Glaser; 21 December 1905 – 3 November 1958) was a British-born American composer, mostly of musical theatre, working with various lyricists, notably Mack Gordon. He is also seen as a pioneer of &quot;space age pop&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Revel was born Harry Glaser in London, England. He was the son of Russian emigrants of Jewish heritage, Jacob Glaser and his wife, from Schrunden in Latvia, who had settled in England. Harry was the second born of four children. His older brother William Revel was a dancer, his younger sister Rene was a singer, and his youngest brother Sam was a concierge in London who later became a travel agent in the United States. They took the last name &quot;Revel&quot; to honor the French soldier of that name who helped them to flee Europe.

Harry Revel learned piano as a child, and studied at the Guildhall School of Music in London. He left around 1922 to go to Paris, where he joined a so-called Hawaiian Band, and toured Europe. He also had his first song, &quot;Oriental Eyes&quot;, published in Italy. He then joined a dance band, the New York Jazz Band, and while touring with the group in Berlin was commissioned to write the music for an operetta, &quot;Was Frauen Traumen&quot;. Its success led to further commissions in Paris, Vienna and London.

==Musical theatre and films==
After returning to England, he decided in 1928 to move to New York City and become a professional songwriter. There, he teamed up with lyricist Mack Gordon to work on Broadway, writing songs for &quot;Ziegfeld Follies of 1931&quot;, &quot;Fast and Furious&quot;, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Welcome&quot; and &quot;Smiling Faces&quot;. Among their songs was the popular &quot;Underneath the Harlem Moon&quot; (1932), which was recorded by several jazz performers.

He and Gordon moved to Hollywood in 1932 and signed as a team for Paramount Pictures. There, Revel wrote scores for the films &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot;, &quot;Broadway Through a Keyhole&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re Not Dressing&quot;, &quot;She Loves Me Not&quot;, &quot;Shoot the Works&quot;, &quot;College Rhythm&quot;, &quot;Love in Bloom&quot;, &quot;Paris in the Spring&quot;, &quot;Stolen Harmony&quot;, &quot;Two for Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Collegiate&quot;. In 1936, they moved to Twentieth Century Fox, and continued to have success with films including &quot;Stowaway&quot;, &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl&quot;, &quot;Ali Baba Goes to Town&quot;, &quot;Wake Up and Live&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Have Everything&quot;, &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;, and &quot;Love Finds Andy Hardy&quot;. In 1934, he appeared in &quot;Hollywood Rhythm&quot;, a short film purporting to show the songwriting team of Gordon and Revel brainstorming the score for &quot;College Rhythm&quot;.

Revel&#x27;s partnership with Mack Gordon ended in 1939. Revel remained a British citizen; on two occasions, he and his brother Billy Revel were found guilty of entering the United States with false passports, and were fined. During World War II, Revel organized variety shows for the USO, and continued to write music for films. He was nominated for an Academy Award in 1942 for &quot;There&#x27;s a Breeze on Lake Louise&quot;, from &quot;The Mayor of 44th Street&quot;, written with Mort Greene; and again for &quot;Remember Me to Carolina&quot;, from &quot;Minstrel Man&quot;, written with Paul Francis Webster. The latter score was nominated for an Academy Award, a first for low-budget studio Producers Releasing Corporation. He also wrote the score for the 1945 Broadway musical &quot;Are You With It?&quot;, with lyrics by Arnold Horwitt.

==Space age pop==
In the late 1940s, Revel became interested in using the theremin to create electronic mood music, which he termed &quot;therapeutical music&quot;. He worked with arranger and conductor Les Baxter and theremin player Samuel Hoffman to create the 1947 album &quot;Music Out of the Moon&quot;, released by Capitol Records, and &quot;Perfume Set to Music&quot; on RCA Victor the following year. In 1950, he wrote the music for &quot;Music for Peace of Mind&quot;, again with Hoffman but this time with Billy May&#x27;s orchestra; and in 1955 released &quot;Harry Revel&#x27;s Music from Out of Space&quot;, with the Stuart Phillips orchestra and chorus, rather than theremin. Revel has subsequently been seen as a pioneer of &quot;space age pop&quot;.

==Later activities and death==
Revel set up his own publishing company, Realm Music Inc., in the 1950s, and continued to compose until his death.

He died from a cerebral hemorrhage in New York City in 1958, aged 52. He was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

<doc id="1060644" wikidata="Q7370910" url="?curid=1060644" title="Roughneck">
<text>A roughneck is a person whose occupation is hard manual labor. The term applies across a number of industries, but is most commonly associated with the workers on a drilling rig. The ideal of the hard-working, tough roughneck has been adopted by several sports teams who use the phrase as part of their name or logo.

Originally the term was used in the traveling carnivals of 19th-century United States, almost interchangeably with roustabout. By the 1930s the terms had transferred to the oil drilling industry, with roughneck used for those who worked on the floor of a drilling rig handling specialised drilling equipment for drilling and pressure controls. By contrast, a roustabout would perform general labor, such as loading and unloading cargo from crane baskets and assisting welders, mechanics, electricians and other skilled workers.

==Oil field roughnecks==
An oil field roughneck&#x27;s duties can include anything involved with connecting pipe down the well bore, as well as general work around a rig. The crew of a land-based oil rig can be further divided into several positions:

* Tool pusher: The highest position at the drilling location, responsible for every crew. A toolpusher may stay on location for a few days or weeks at a time during operations, whereas individual drilling crews work only eight- or 12-hour shifts or &quot;tours&quot; (pronounced as &quot;towers&quot;).
* Driller: The head of an individual crew, responsible for controlling a rig&#x27;s machinery during drilling, as well as most other rig operations.
* Derrickhand (derrick-man): Responsible for the drilling mud, the mud pits where drilling fluids are circulated the system, and the mud pumps, as well as being the hand up in the derrick manipulating stands into and out of the fingers during tripping operations. Acting as a lead for the driller who is mostly restricted to the rig floor. In many cases, the derrickman is exclusively responsible for work in the derrick during &quot;tripping&quot; pipe in and out of the hole. 
* Pit Watcher: Responsible for the drilling mud, the mud pits, and associated pumping/circulating of mud and various fluids through the pits, downhole, and returning through the pits. 
* Motorman (motorhand): Responsible for maintenance of various engines, water pumps, water lines, steam lines, boilers and various other machinery incorporated into the rig daily. Also responsible for the movement of equipment on site. On a four-man drilling crew, the motorman is also the chainhand.
* Boilerman: Though this position is now obsolete, before the mid-20th century, when most rigs were steam-powered, the boilerman was responsible for the boilers. The boilerman also functioned as the laundryman, steam-cleaning the last crew&#x27;s greasy work clothes in the &quot;blow barrel&quot; and then hanging them up to dry in the warm air near the boilers.
* Chainhand (Floorhand): This position is given to a floor hand that can also throw the chain that helps spin up the connections, but with some tasks being automated on the drilling rigs is pretty much just another floor hand that watches out for the worm and does not get as filthy.
* Leadhand/Floorhand (&quot;worm&quot;): Usually the lowest member of the drilling crew, those in this position are often nicknamed &quot;worm&quot;, because this hand has the dirtiest and most physically demanding position. The floor hand works primarily on the rig floor where he is the one actually operating the tongs, iron roughneck, tugger, and catwalk, and doing pretty much any other job that is asked of him.
* Roustabout (lease hand): On bigger rigs and offshore rigs, a roustabout does most of the painting and cleaning so roughnecks can take care of other work.
* Ginsel: The worm&#x27;s helper. This is also a derogatory insult among roughnecks. Also called the fifth hand.
* Iron roughneck is also a specialized equipment used in oil drilling operations. Whether the pipe is being fed into the wellbore or it is being taken out, the iron roughneck uses a rotary table and torque wrench(es) to make up or break down the pipe.

In Canada on land-based rigs, the term &quot;roughneck&quot; refers to the floorhand.

==Cultural references==
The Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League used to use an oil rigging roughneck with an ice hockey stick as one of their secondary logos. The roughneck, as a symbol of hard work and fortitude, was the inspiration for the Calgary Roughnecks lacrosse team, as well as the Tulsa Roughnecks of the North American Soccer League, the Tulsa Roughnecks of the United Soccer Leagues, and the Tulsa Roughnecks FC of the USL. The West Texas Roughnecks of the Indoor Football League also use this nickname. In the BAFA National Leagues, the Aberdeen Roughnecks have also adopted the nickname. In the AUDL (American Ultimate Disc League) the Dallas team is also the Roughnecks. One of the inaugural teams of the revamped XFL was the Houston Roughnecks.

In Chapter 3 of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, on first meeting Jay Gatsby, Nick Carraway describes him as looking like &quot;an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd.&quot;

Johnny Cash wrote and performed a song called &quot;Born to Be a Roughneck&quot;.

Several television programs have focused on the roughneck life, including &quot;Oil Strike North&quot; (1975), &quot;Roughnecks&quot; (1994–1995), and &quot;Black Gold&quot; (2008–2013).

Stan Rogers&#x27;s song &quot;Free in the Harbour&quot;, about the migration of Atlantic fisherman to the oil industry for work, describes these migrants as &quot;Calgary Roughnecks from Hermitage Bay.&quot;

Starship Troopers has a Mobile Infantry division called Roughnecks Two-Zero, eventually taken over by the film&#x27;s protagonist, Johnny Rico, becoming &quot;Rico&#x27;s Roughnecks&quot;.

<doc id="1060648" wikidata="Q2255228" url="?curid=1060648" title="Joan Hambidge">
<text>Joan Helene Hambidge (born 11 September 1956 in Aliwal North, South Africa) (the English surname notwithstanding), is an Afrikaans poet, literary theorist and academic. She is a prolific poet in Afrikaans, controversial as a public figure and critic and notorious for her &quot;out-of-the-closet&quot; style of writing. Her theoretic contributions deal mainly with Roland Barthes, deconstruction, postmodernism, psychoanalysis and metaphysics.

==Biography==
Hambidge studied at the University of Stellenbosch and the University of Pretoria. She was admitted to a doctorate under André P. Brink at Rhodes University in 1985. A second doctorate followed (University of Cape Town, 2001).

Although Hambidge says she discovered her muse when she was young, it was while she was a lecturer at the University of the North, Limpopo Province, South Africa, that she started to blossom as a writer.

She was awarded the Eugène Marais Prize for literature for her second volume of poetry, &quot;Bitterlemoene&quot; (&quot;Bitter Oranges&quot;), in 1986. This prize is one of the most coveted literary prizes in South Africa. She also won the Litera Prize as well as the Poetry Institute of Africa Prize for her poetry.

She lectured at UCT from 1992 until her retirement in 2021. She began as a senior lecturer and was later a Professor at the School of Languages and Literatures at the University of Cape Town. In 2021, she was appointed as a Fellow of the University of Cape Town. 

===Her major creative works===
Although she writes in Afrikaans, Hambidge has translated some of her poetry into English. Other translations have been done by Jo Nel, fellow poet and close friend Johann de Lange, and Charl JF Cilliers. Her work has been published in the Netherlands and the UK as well as in the US. Having published 26 volumes of poetry up to 2016 she is the most prolific poet in Afrikaans.

Hambidge&#x27;s interest in literary theory (especially psychoanalysis and metafiction) is reflected in her writing, especially in her fiction. She works with the difference between theory and practice in her novels, &quot;Judaskus&quot; (&quot;Judas kiss&quot;, 1998) and &quot;Kladboek&quot; (2008). She has also published two theoretical works: &quot;Postmodernisme&quot; (1995), about Roland Barthes, deconstruction and post-modernism, and &quot;Psigoanalise en lees&quot; (&quot;Psychoanalysis and reading&quot;, 1991), on Jacques Lacan and reading.

===Other contributions===
Hambidge is a prolific traveller and writes a weekly column for a Cape Town daily, &quot;Die Burger&quot;. She is a critic and columnist for the Afrikaans literary e-zine &quot;Litnet&quot;.

==Literary style==
Hambidge is famous for her iconoclastic and approach to literary traditions in Afrikaans and cultural idols and for her re-examination of previously taboo subjects. She is also the first Afrikaans author to have dealt with lesbianism from an insider&#x27;s point of view. She imposes a humorous and satirical twist on most of the subjects she tackles.
