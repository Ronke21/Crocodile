<text>&quot;Lithium&quot; is a song by the American rock band Nirvana, written by vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain. It appears as the fifth track on the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, released by DGC Records in September 1991.

In a 1992 interview with California fanzine &quot;Flipside&quot;, Cobain explained that the song was a fictionalized account of a man who &quot;turned to religion as a last resort to keep himself alive&quot; after the death of his girlfriend, &quot;to keep him from suicide.&quot; Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad described its lyrics as &quot;an update on Marx&#x27;s description of religion as the &#x27;opiate of the masses.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;Lithium&quot; was released as the third single from &quot;Nevermind&quot; in July 1992, peaking at number 64 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 11 on the UK Singles Chart. It also reached number one in Finland and the top five in Ireland and Portugal. The accompanying music video, directed by American filmmaker Kevin Kerslake, is a compilation of live footage from the band&#x27;s October 31, 1991, concert at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle, Washington, and from the completed but then-unreleased film, &quot;1991: The Year Punk Broke&quot;.

==Early history==

Written in 1990, &quot;Lithium&quot; was debuted at a video session at the Evergreen State College&#x27;s television studio in Olympia, Washington on March 20, 1990. The full session, which also included versions of three songs from the band&#x27;s 1989 debut album, &quot;Bleach&quot;, was directed by Jon Snyder and conceived by Cobain as a potential video release. It featured the band performing live while a montage of television footage taped by Cobain at home playing in the background. To date, no full songs from this session have been officially released by Nirvana&#x27;s record company, although videos for &quot;Lithium&quot; and &quot;School,&quot; edited by Snyder and featuring additional footage and still photos, appeared on two episodes of &quot;1200 Seconds&quot;, a television show produced by Evergreen students. The episodes aired in the fall of 1990 on a local community access cable station.

The song was added to Nirvana&#x27;s setlist soon after, over a year before the release of &quot;Nevermind&quot;. Kim Thayil, guitarist of Seattle rock band Soundgarden, recalled hearing it for the first time during Nirvana&#x27;s show at the Off Ramp Cafe in Seattle on November 25, 1990, saying that &quot;when I heard &#x27;Lithium,&#x27; it stuck in my mind. Ben, our bass player, came up to me and said, &#x27;That&#x27;s the hit. That&#x27;s the Top 40 hit right there.&quot;

In April 1990, &quot;Lithium&quot; was recorded by Butch Vig at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, during the recording sessions for what was intended to be a second album for the band&#x27;s original label, Sub Pop. However, the release was abandoned after the departure of drummer Chad Channing later that year, and the eight-song session was instead circulated as a demo tape, which helped generate interest with the band among major labels.

On September 25, 1990, Cobain performed a solo acoustic version of the song on the &quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot; show, hosted by Calvin Johnson, on KAOS (FM) in Olympia, Washington.

==&quot;Nevermind&quot;==
&quot;Lithium&quot; was re-recorded by Vig in May 1991 at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, during the sessions for what became Nirvana&#x27;s second album and major-label debut, &quot;Nevermind&quot;. Preliminary attempts at recording the song&#x27;s instruments were unsuccessful, in part because the band was having a difficult time maintaining a steady tempo, and kept speeding up. After one failed take, the band abandoned the song as a &quot;frustrated&quot; Cobain began playing the song, &quot;Endless, Nameless&quot; instead. This version of &quot;Endless, Nameless&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s hidden track. The band&#x27;s timing problems were immediately solved when their new drummer, Dave Grohl, took Vig&#x27;s advice to play with a metronome; it was the only track from the album to be recorded to a click track. Vig also advised Grohl to use simpler fills and patterns for the song than he had initially attempted.

The song&#x27;s quiet verses and loud choruses dynamic also presented a challenge for Vig, who said that &quot;getting the verses to sound relaxed and the chorus to sound as intense as possible, and make the transitions feel natural and effortless, was a hard one to do.&quot; As Vig recalled, &quot;Kurt wanted to be able to play the guitar very ... not methodical—it needed to have this space.&quot; The dark sound of the distorted guitar was achieved by using a Big Muff fuzzbox played through a Fender Bassman bass amplifier, recorded with what Vig believes was an U47 microphone that he usually used to record bass guitar. The vocals for the song&#x27;s verses were recorded in two takes, with the second take being used as the master vocal track, although Vig used the second line of the second verse from take one. The chorus vocals were quickly recorded and double-tracked after.

==Post-&quot;Nevermind&quot;==

&quot;Lithium&quot; was performed live at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards on September 9, 1992, in Los Angeles. Cobain had wanted to play the unreleased song &quot;Rape Me&quot; instead, but this was met with resistance from MTV, who wanted the band to play their breakthrough single, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; and were possibly wary of the newer song&#x27;s controversial title and lyrics. Cobain agreed to play &quot;Lithium&quot; as a compromise, over concerns that not playing the show might lead to MTV boycotting other acts on their label, Gold Mountain, or firing their friend at the station, Amy Finnerty. &quot;We didn&#x27;t want to fuck everything up for everyone so we decided to play &#x27;Lithium,&#x27;&quot; Cobain explained in the 1993 Nirvana biography, &quot;Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana&quot;. &quot;Instead of bowing out and keeping our dignity, we decided to get fucked in the ass.&quot; The performance, which featured Cobain playing a short part of &quot;Rape Me&quot; at the beginning &quot;just to give [MTV] a little heart palpitation,&quot; ended with Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic being struck by his bass after throwing it into the air and attempting to catch it unsuccessfully.

The final live version of &quot;Lithium&quot; was at Nirvana&#x27;s last show, on March 1, 1994, at Terminal Einz in Munich, Germany.

==Composition==

===Music===

&quot;Lithium&quot; is a grunge, alternative rock and punk rock song that runs for a duration of four minutes and sixteen seconds. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by BMG Rights Management, it is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 124 beats per minute. &quot;Lithium&quot; is composed in the key of D major, with guitars tuned down a whole tone, and chord shapes resembling chords in the key of E major, while Kurt Cobain&#x27;s vocal range spans one octave and three notes, from the low-note of C3 to the high-note of F4. The intro, verses and chorus have a basic chord sequence of D5–F5–B5–G5–B5–C5–A5–C5 and alternates between the chords G5 and B5 during the bridge. A transition from the bridge to the main chord sequence consists of a bar of C5 and a bar of A5. The sheet music makes no reference to the lowered tuning of the guitars and (inaccurately) shows the E major key signature.

The arrangement is representative of the musical style Nirvana had developed during work on &quot;Nevermind&quot;, alternating between quiet and loud sections. In the song, Cobain fingers chord shapes on his guitar but varies between playing single notes and double stops on the instrument, giving the track a loose feel. The song opens with bouncing guitar strums before Cobain starts singing his lines in an almost whispered manner. His voice retains a measured calm during the verses, where low, open guitar lines trace the outline of the song&#x27;s melody. During the chorus, Cobain shouts &quot;Ye-eh-eh-eh-eh&quot; over five notes and distorted, towering riffs. Cobain&#x27;s thick, surging rhythm guitar meshes with Novoselic&#x27;s melodic bass and Grohl&#x27;s intense, snappy drumming.

===Lyrics===
According to Cobain, &quot;Lithium&quot; was &quot;one of those songs I actually did finish while trying to write it instead of taking pieces of my poetry and other things&quot;.

In his 1993 biography &quot;Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana&quot;, Azerrad described the song&#x27;s title as &quot;an update on Marx&#x27;s description of religion as the &#x27;opiate of the masses.&#x27;&quot; Gillian G. Gaar described it as &quot;a song whose sing-along melody typically masks the disturbing quality of the lyric, which touches on the solace one can find in religion or madness.&quot; As Cobain explained, &quot;In the song, a guy’s lost his girl and his friends and he’s brooding. He’s decided to find God before he kills himself. It’s hard for me to understand the need for a vice like [religion] but I can appreciate it too. People need vices.&quot;

In &quot;Come As You Are&quot;, Cobain acknowledged that the song might have been inspired in part by the time he spent living with his friend Jesse Reed and his born-again Christian parents. Cobain told Azerrad that he wasn&#x27;t necessarily anti-religion, saying that &quot;I&#x27;ve always felt that some people should have religion in their lives ... That&#x27;s fine. If it&#x27;s going to save someone, it&#x27;s okay. And the person in [&#x27;Lithium&#x27;] needed it.&quot;

==Release and reception==

&quot;Lithium&quot; was released as the third single from &quot;Nevermind&quot; on July 13, 1992. Featuring a cover photo by Cobain, the single contained a sonogram of the musician&#x27;s then-unborn child Frances Bean Cobain, as well as full lyrics for all the songs on &quot;Nevermind&quot;. Cassette, CD, 12-inch vinyl, and British 12-inch vinyl picture disc editions included &quot;Curmudgeon&quot; and a live version of &quot;Been a Son&quot; (performed on Halloween the previous year) as B-sides. The British 7-inch and cassette featured only &quot;Curmudgeon&quot; as an extra track, while the UK CD release added a cover of the Wipers&#x27; &quot;D-7&quot; recorded for BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel&#x27;s program in 1990.

John Sullivan for &quot;New York Magazine&quot; described &quot;Lithium&quot; as a &quot;flawlessly crafted hit.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Demming remarked, &quot;For all the sound and fury of Nirvana&#x27;s epochal album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, it&#x27;s significant that the album&#x27;s best and most affecting song is also among the quietest. ... The liberating force of Nirvana&#x27;s inspired anger was rarely more powerful than in the service of this song.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; music critic Christopher Farley praised the song for its &quot;gorgeous guitar hooks,&quot; writing, &quot;Its punk-inspired, we-couldn&#x27;t-care-less ethos seemed to reflect the restless apathy some young people felt toward their times.&quot;

&quot;Lithium&quot; was ranked the 20th best single of the year in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll, tying with singles by Ministry, Lisa Stansfield, and Utah Saints In 1993, it was voted at number 50 on &quot;Spin&quot;″s Top 100 Songs of Our Time. In Israel, it was voted in at number 4 on the IBA&#x27;s &quot;Voice of Israel&quot; singles chart.

In 2012, &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Lithium&quot; at number 52 on its list of the &quot;100 Best Tracks Of The &#x27;90s&quot;. In 2013, it was voted first &quot;by a pretty comfortable margin&quot; in &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; reader&#x27;s poll of &quot;The 10 Best Nirvana Songs.&quot; In 2019, the song was placed at number seven on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s ranking of 102 Nirvana songs. In 2023, Stephen Thomas Erlewine ranked it fifth on &quot;the A.V. Club&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Essential Nirvana: Their 30 greatest songs, ranked&quot; list.

According to Nielsen Music&#x27;s year-end report for 2019, &quot;Lithium&quot; was the tenth most-played song of the decade on mainstream rock radio with 123,000 spins. All of the songs in the top 10 were from the 1990s.

===Legacy===
On April 10, 2014, &quot;Lithium&quot; was performed by surviving Nirvana members Grohl, Novoselic and Pat Smear, with lead vocals and guitar by American rock musician St. Vincent, at the band&#x27;s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.

&quot;Lithium&quot; has been used as the goal song for Seattle&#x27;s National Hockey League (NHL) team, the Seattle Kraken, since their inaugural season.

==Live promotional versions==

===Paradiso version===

A live version of &quot;Lithium,&quot; recorded at the Paradiso in Amsterdam, Netherlands on November 25, 1991, was released as a promotional single in Holland in 1996, for the live compilation &quot;From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah&quot;, released in October 1996. Clips of this performance of the song appeared in the 2005 documentary &quot;Classic Albums: Nirvana – Nevermind&quot;, and the full show was released on Blu-ray and CD on the 30th anniversary &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; version of &quot;Nevermind&quot; on November 12, 2021.

===The Palace, Melbourne, version===

In October 2021, another live version, recorded at The Palace in Melbourne, Australia, on February 1, 1992, was released as a streaming single ahead of its appearance on the 30th anniversary edition of the &quot;Nevermind&quot;.

Reviewing the release for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Kory Grow wrote that &quot;the real magic in the box set manifests during the band&#x27;s Melbourne, Australia, gig on Feb. 1, 1992. Cobain urges the crowd to sing along with him on &#x27;Lithium&#x27; — a track that hadn&#x27;t even come out as a single yet — and the audience nearly drowns him out, gleefully belting his lyrics about feeling simultaneously happy and ugly and not caring who knows it. Cobain sounds so into it, he forgot to kick on his distortion pedal for the song&#x27;s primal &#x27;yeah&#x27; chorus&quot;.

===Reading 1992 version===

A live version of the song recorded during the band&#x27;s headlining set at the Reading Festival in Reading, England, on August 30, 1992, was released as a promotional single from the album &quot;Live at Reading&quot;, released in November 2009. Video of this version first appeared on the 1994 home movie &quot;Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!&quot;, although the audio was previously unreleased. In the liner notes to &quot;From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah&quot;, Novoselic wrote that &quot;hearing tens of thousands of people sing along with [the Reading version of] &#x27;Lithium&#x27; was a very cool moment in the history of the band.&quot;

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;Lithium&quot; was the second of four Nirvana videos directed by Kevin Kerslake, who had worked with the band on the video for their previous single, &quot;Come as You Are,&quot; and later directed the videos for &quot;In Bloom&quot; and &quot;Sliver.&quot;

The video featured a collage of live footage from the completed but then-unreleased home movie &quot;1991: The Year Punk Broke&quot;, which documented the band&#x27;s two-week European tour with Sonic Youth, and from their show at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle on October 31, 1991. The footage from &quot;The Year Punk Broke&quot; was filmed at the 1991 Reading Festival on August 23, 1991, and at De Doelen in Rotterdam, Netherlands on September 1, 1991. According to Nirvana&#x27;s manager, Danny Goldberg, in his 2019 Cobain biography &quot;Serving the Servant&quot;, Sonic Youth&#x27;s vocalist and bassist Kim Gordon initially opposed the inclusion of one scene from the film, which featured Cobain being carried on Novoselic&#x27;s shoulders, but eventually relented after being reminded that Nirvana had allowed Sonic Youth to use five live performances in the film for free. As Goldberg explained, Gordon &quot;was in love with the shot&quot; and believed its inclusion in a music video would lessen its impact in the upcoming film. The &quot;Lithium&quot; video also featured Cobain jumping into the drum set at the end of the Reading set, during &quot;Endless, Nameless&quot;, which led to him dislocating his arm. The video was placed into heavy rotation on MTV in the US, and into active rotation on MTV Europe. It was also played on MTV Australia, &quot;Rage&quot; and &quot;Video Smash Hits&quot; in Australia.

===Original concept===

According to Azerrad in &quot;Come as You Are&quot;, Cobain&#x27;s original idea for a &quot;Lithium&quot; video was an animated film about a girl who lived in a house in a forest. The story was to feature the girl, named Preggo, finding a pile of eggs in her closet and putting them in a train of three wagons that she would then wheel through the forest until arriving at a king&#x27;s castle. By this time, all but one of the eggs have cracked, and she would place the remaining egg on a book on the lap of the king, asleep on his throne. The king would then awaken and open his legs, and the book would slide shut between them, crushing the egg. This concept was abandoned when Cobain and Kerslake learned that the animation would take four months to produce, and the live collage was made instead. Azerrad wrote that while the final video was &quot;enlivened by Kerslake&#x27;s neat trick of using more violent footage during the quiet parts of the song and vice versa,&quot; it &quot;was something of a disappointment from a band and a song that promised so much.&quot;

<doc id="1069220" wikidata="Q4577691" url="?curid=1069220" title="Comptroller of the Household">
<text>The Comptroller of the Household is an ancient position in the British royal household, nominally the second-ranking member of the Lord Steward&#x27;s department after the Treasurer of the Household. The Comptroller was an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the Board of Green Cloth, until that body was abolished in the reform of local government licensing in 2004. In recent times, a senior government whip has invariably occupied the office. On state occasions the Comptroller (in common with certain other senior officers of the Household) carries a white staff of office, as often seen in portraits.

&quot;Comptroller&quot; is an alternative spelling of &quot;controller&quot;, recorded since around 1500 in a number of British titles, and later also in the United States. The variant in spelling results from the influence of French &quot;compte&quot; &quot;account&quot;.

==History==
The office of Comptroller of the Household derives from the medieval Household office of Controller of the Wardrobe, who was deputy to the Keeper (or Treasurer) of the Wardrobe, as well as an important official in his own right as keeper of the Privy Seal. Later, both these offices became high-ranking political appointments.

== Modern role ==
In modern times, the Comptroller has become a less prominent position in British politics. The holder is the third-most senior Government whips in the House of Commons and is responsible for the day-to-day activity in the House. Their responsibilities for the Royal Household are now largely ceremonial, such as serving as an usher at royal garden parties. The role has been occupied by Chris Elmore since 2024.

<text>Concetta Anna Fierravanti-Wells (; born 20 May 1960) is an Australian politician who was a Senator for New South Wales from 2005 to 2022, representing the Liberal Party. She served as Minister for International Development and the Pacific in the Turnbull government from 2016 to 2018. She grew up in Port Kembla, New South Wales, and, prior to entering politics, worked as a lawyer and policy adviser.

==Early life==
Fierravanti-Wells was born on 20 May 1960 in Wollongong, New South Wales. She is the daughter of Giuseppe and Antonia Fierravanti, both of whom were born in Calitri, Italy. Her father arrived in Australia in 1953 to work at the Port Kembla steelworks, and was joined by his future wife six years later. Fierravanti-Wells acquired Italian citizenship by descent in 1985, but renounced it in 1994 prior to standing for parliamentary preselection. She spoke Italian as her first language, learning English at kindergarten.

Fierravanti-Wells grew up in Port Kembla, attending St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Primary School and St Mary, Star of the Sea College in Wollongong. She went on to study at the Australian National University, completing a Bachelor of Arts in political science in European languages in 1980 and a Bachelor of Laws in 1982. While at university she was named Miss Rugby 1981 by the ACT Rugby Union, representing the ANU Rugby Club.

==Career==
Fierravanti-Wells served her articles of clerkship with the Canberra firm of Macphillamy, Cummins and Gibson. She joined the office of the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) in 1984, working for its ACT branch until 1986 and then joining its New South Wales branch. She was the acting principal legal officer at the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service in 1990. In the same year, Fierravanti-Wells began working as a policy adviser for federal MP and shadow minister Jim Carlton. She was involved in drafting the proposed changes to the Australian Public Service under the federal opposition&#x27;s Fightback! policy. After the Coalition&#x27;s defeat at the 1993 federal election she was seconded to New South Wales premier John Fahey as his senior private secretary. Fierravanti-Wells re-joined the AGS in 1994 as a senior lawyer. She was also a consultant to MinterEllison from 2003.

Outside of her professional career, Fierravanti-Wells was the Australian representative on the General Council of Italians Abroad (Consiglio Generale degli Italiani all&#x27;Estero) from 1990 to 1998. She was made a knight of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 1998, the youngest Australian to receive the honour. Fierravanti-Wells was one of the Coalition&#x27;s nominees to the multicultural advisory committee for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. She also served on the board of Chris Riley&#x27;s charity Youth Off The Streets from 1999 to 2004, including as chairman from 2002.

==Political career==

Fierravanti-Wells was an unsuccessful candidate for Liberal preselection at the 1994 Warringah by-election, which saw future prime minister Tony Abbott elected to parliament. She was president of the party&#x27;s Italian special branch from 1995 and elected to the state executive in 1996, also serving as a delegate to state council from 1995 and to federal council from 2000.

Fierravanti-Wells defeated incumbent senator John Tierney for Liberal preselection prior to the 2004 federal election, winning by 57 votes to 51 with the support of powerbroker David Clarke. Her victory followed four previous attempts to gain preselection. Normally Fierravanti-Wells would have taken her seat on 1 July 2005, however Tierney resigned in April prior to the expiration of his term. She was appointed to the resulting casual vacancy, and took her seat on 5 May.

Following the 2008 Liberal leadership spill, Fierravanti-Wells was appointed as a shadow parliamentary secretary under Malcolm Turnbull, with responsibility for immigration and citizenship. She was promoted to shadow minister for ageing when Tony Abbott replaced Turnbull as opposition leader in December 2009, adding the mental health portfolio following the 2010 election.

After the 2013 federal election, Fierravanti-Wells was appointed to the Abbott Ministry as the Parliamentary Secretary for Social Services from September 2013. In May 2015 she was also made parliamentary secretary to the Attorney-General, with a focus on anti-radicalisation. She was appointed as Assistant Minister for Multicultural Affairs in September 2015, following Turnbull&#x27;s victory over Abbott in a leadership spill. Following the 2015 Parramatta shooting, Fierravanti-Wells stated that &quot;we have been dealing with extremism and violent extremism as a national security issue, but what we really need to do is to be looking at it [as] a social issue with a national security angle&quot;. She supported ASIO director-general Duncan Lewis&#x27;s request that Coalition MPs use more moderate language in reference to Islamic extremism, which was seen as controversial. She also stated that it was a duty of government to support &quot;the modern and moderate interpretation&quot; of Islam.

On 13 February 2016, it was announced that Fierravanti-Wells would be appointed Minister for International Development and the Pacific following a rearrangement in the First Turnbull Ministry. In April 2018, speaking at the Overseas Development Institute in London, Fierravanti-Wells said increasing Australia&#x27;s foreign aid commitment was opposed by most in the country. &quot;In Australia we had some research done where it showed that about 80% of Australians believe that we should not be spending more on foreign aid or that what we spend is about right&quot;. In 2018, Australia&#x27;s foreign aid commitment stood at $3.9bn, its lowest ever level as a proportion of the budget: 0.22% of gross national income.

Fierravanti-Wells resigned from the ministry on 21 August 2018, following the Liberal Party leadership spill that day.

===Political positions===
During the Morrison government, Fierravanti-Wells was a member of the National Right faction of the Liberal Party. She was a member of Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy and served on the committee of a Liberal Party publication, &quot;The Conservative&quot;.

Speaking in 2012 about same-sex marriage, Fierravanti-Wells said that many LGBT people do not &quot;even intend on staying in a monogamous relationship&quot;. She is one of twelve senators who voted against what became the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017.

In November 2021, Fierravanti-Wells was one of five Liberal-aligned senators who voted against the government in support of One Nation’s COVID-19 Vaccination Status (Prevention of Discrimination) Bill 2021.

===Departure===
Fierravanti-Wells&#x27; senate term would expire in June 2022, along with those of two other Liberal senators. She sought Liberal Party preselection for the 2022 Australian federal election to continue to represent New South Wales. She nominated for the winnable positions (the first two) on the party&#x27;s Senate ticket. She was defeated by both other senators in the ballot held at the state council meeting on 26 March 2022. Fierravanti-Wells later clarified via Twitter and an open letter to party members that she did not nominate for the unwinnable positions, and so she would not appear on the Senate ticket and would not be a candidate at the election.

A few days later, on 29 March 2022, she spoke in parliament, criticising Scott Morrison and the pre-selection process in the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party.

Fierravanti-Wells&#x27;s term expired on 30th June 2022.

==Personal life==
Fierravanti-Wells is married to John Wells, a former Royal Australian Navy officer who commanded during the 1990s. They married in 1990 at naval base HMAS Watson. In 2013, when she first became a parliamentary secretary, she reported that they own a property in Umbria, Italy.

<doc id="1069241" wikidata="Q719098" url="?curid=1069241" title="Tony Dungy">
<text>Anthony Kevin Dungy ( ; born October 6, 1955) is an American former professional football safety and coach who served as a head coach in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Indianapolis Colts. His teams became perennial postseason contenders under his leadership, missing the playoffs only twice with Tampa Bay. He led the Colts to victory in Super Bowl XLI, making him the first African American head coach to win the Super Bowl.

Dungy began his head coaching tenure in 1996 with the Buccaneers, a franchise regarded as one of the league&#x27;s worst. Through implementation of the Tampa 2 defensive scheme, he brought new success to the Buccaneers, leading them to four playoff appearances in six seasons. He was fired after the 2001 playoffs due to frequent postseason struggles, but is credited with constructing the team that won Super Bowl XXXVII the following year. After his departure from Tampa Bay, he served as the Colts&#x27; head coach for seven seasons, qualifying for the playoffs in each. His greatest success occurred with the Colts&#x27; Super Bowl-winning season in 2006, the franchise&#x27;s first in over three decades and the first since relocating to Indianapolis. He retired from coaching following the 2008 season.

Since retiring, Dungy has served as an analyst on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Football Night in America&quot;. He is also the national spokesman for the fatherhood program All Pro Dad. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Jackson, Michigan, Dungy&#x27;s parents were Wilbur Dungy (1926–2004), a science professor at Jackson College and Delta College (MI), and Cleomae Dungy (1920–2002), who taught Shakespeare at Jackson High School. Wilbur served as a pilot in the Army Air Forces during World War II with the famed Tuskegee Airmen. After graduating from Parkside High School in 1973, Dungy played college football at the University of Minnesota, and was the Gophers&#x27; quarterback and most valuable player in 1975 and 1976. In 1977, he was awarded the Big Ten Medal of Honor, recognizing one student athlete from the graduating class of each Big Ten member school, for demonstrating joint athletic and academic excellence throughout their college career.

==Professional career==
After going undrafted, Dungy signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers as a free agent and was converted to defensive back, going on to play three seasons in the NFL. His best season was in 1978, when he intercepted six passes and won a championship ring with the Steelers in Super Bowl XIII.

Dungy is the most recent NFL player to intercept a pass and throw an interception in the same game. Dungy was the emergency quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers in a 1977 game against the Houston Oilers when both Terry Bradshaw and Mike Kruczek went down with injuries on October 9.

==Coaching career==
===Assistant coaching positions===
After being cut by the New York Giants in training camp before the 1980 season, Dungy returned to Minnesota as defensive backfield coach. He took the same position with the Steelers in 1982, and was promoted in 1984 to defensive coordinator. Following a 5–11 season in 1988, Steelers owner Dan Rooney forced head coach Chuck Noll to make changes to his coaching staff, which included demoting Dungy back to defensive backs coach.
From 1989 to 1991, Dungy served as defensive backs coach for the Kansas City Chiefs, under head coach Marty Schottenheimer. From 1992 to 1995, he served as the defensive coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings under head coach Dennis Green.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
Dungy became an NFL head coach when he was hired by Rich McKay to reform the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a team then well known for its lack of success, on January 22, 1996. Dungy installed his version of the Cover 2 defense with defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin with a few new wrinkles. The result was the now-famous Tampa 2, though Dungy openly admitted it was based on concepts he had picked up from his days in Pittsburgh.

Following the 2002 season, the Buccaneers won Super Bowl XXXVII, their first appearance in the championship game. Dungy was fired after the prior season and replaced with Jon Gruden, because he could not get the team there, but was now credited with creating the championship-calibre core.

Dungy&#x27;s 56 victories were the most in Buccaneers history until 2008 when Jon Gruden surpassed him with his 57th win.

===Indianapolis Colts===
On January 22, 2002, Dungy was hired as head coach of the Indianapolis Colts, a team that at the time was very potent offensively, but very weak defensively. He installed his &quot;Tampa 2&quot; defense immediately and continued to retool the Colts&#x27; defense to his liking during his tenure. After joining the Colts, Dungy left the high-powered offense previously installed there by Jim Mora, in both playing style and in personnel, virtually unchanged. Dungy was reunited with Tom Moore, who was retained as offensive coordinator. Moore and Dungy had previously worked together at Minnesota and Pittsburgh.

During his early tenure in Indianapolis, Dungy struggled to fix the Colts&#x27; defense and had mixed results in the postseason. In his first season at Indianapolis, the Colts were shut out 41–0 by the New York Jets in a first-round playoff game, and the team lost postseason games to the New England Patriots in both 2003 (in the AFC championship game) and 2004 (in the second round of the playoffs). Dungy signed a three-year contract extension in October 2005 for US$5 million per year.

The Colts&#x27; 2006 playoff run was characterized by a marked improvement in defensive play, as the Colts defeated the Kansas City Chiefs, holding one of the NFL&#x27;s best running backs to less than 50 yards, and beat the Baltimore Ravens in the divisional round. On January 21, 2007, after trailing 21–3, the Colts defeated the New England Patriots to become AFC champions and advanced to Super Bowl XLI. This was the largest comeback in conference title-game history. Dungy coached the Colts to a 29–17 victory over the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI. Dungy became the first African-American head coach to win a Super Bowl. Dungy would coach two more seasons in Indianapolis, retiring after the 2008 season.

===Coaching firsts===
Dungy&#x27;s career has included several notable firsts. Among them, Dungy is the first NFL head coach to defeat all 32 NFL teams. He was also the youngest assistant coach at age 25 and the youngest coordinator at age 28 in NFL history.

===Coaching strategy===

On offense, Tony Dungy&#x27;s strategy involved a conservative, ball-control offense based primarily around running the ball and short, high-percentage passes when he was at Tampa Bay. At Indianapolis, he inherited and kept the offense designed by offensive coordinator Tom Moore because the offense was in the hands of someone he knew and trusted.

On defense, Dungy used a stifling &quot;Cover 2&quot;-style zone defense, which usually was based around a formation of four linemen, three linebackers, and four defensive backs. The &quot;Cover 2&quot; defense Dungy used involved his linemen rushing the passer, the cornerbacks covering the passing flat area, the linebackers covering the middle of the field, and the safeties providing deep coverage on each half of their respective zones. While the Cover 2 defense was not a new concept, Dungy contributed to its greater use by systemizing it into an every-down defense. The personnel and techniques that Dungy used in this defense were very specific, and as a result, his style of defense earned the moniker of the &quot;Tampa 2&quot; around the NFL.

Dungy is mentioned in the book &quot;Power of Habit&quot;, by Charles Duhigg, in chapter 3: &quot;The Golden Rule of Habit Change.&quot;

===Coaching philosophy===
Dungy stresses that coaches are essentially teachers.

His protege, Lovie Smith, observed, &quot;We talked about how to do it, being a teacher instead of screaming and yelling, all that stuff...
I think as you look to young coaches coming up in the ranks, a lot of us have a picture of how a coach is supposed to be, how he is supposed to act. And I think what Tony Dungy showed me is you don&#x27;t have to act that way.

Dungy said:

:I really wanted to show people you can win all kinds of ways. I always coached the way I&#x27;ve wanted to be coached. I know Lovie has done the same thing. For guys to have success where it maybe goes against the grain, against the culture. I know I probably didn&#x27;t get a couple of jobs in my career because people could not see my personality or the way I was going to do it. For your faith to be more important than your job, for your family to be more important than that job. We all know that&#x27;s the way it should be, but we&#x27;re afraid to say that sometimes. Lovie&#x27;s not afraid to say it and I&#x27;m not afraid to say it.

Dungy also learned from Noll that it takes all 53 of the players on the team to win so that a coach should train the 53rd player on the roster as he would the third player, which has become the spine of Dungy&#x27;s own coaching philosophy, the Next Man Up theory of calm coaching. Dungy stressed that a team should have a thought process, a philosophy, and the conviction to stick with it, even if personnel change during the games because of injuries. Dungy said:

:Chuck&#x27;s philosophy was to convince every guy on the team that his role was important. If you came in as a free agent and were just a gunner on the punt team or the third safety, you were doing something the team needed to win. It was his way of emphasizing that no one is irreplaceable. You have to coach everybody the same way. If Joe Greene goes out, Steve Furness goes in and we&#x27;re not going to change anything. Chuck never panicked when someone got hurt or held out. We can still function. That made a big impression on me.

Dungy put his coaching beliefs on his memoir, &quot;Quiet Strength: The Principles, Practices, and Priorities of a Winning Life&quot; (). Cam Cameron, former head coach of the Miami Dolphins, highly recommended the book by buying 1,000 books to give away to football coaches at his preseason coaching clinic in July 2007 in South Florida, and said:

:It dispelled so many myths about the coaching business – that you had to be a yeller and a screamer to win. You can be your own person, treat people with respect, be very demanding, but demanding in a way that doesn&#x27;t trample on people. And you don&#x27;t have to give up your faith to win in the NFL. It confirmed and reaffirmed an awful lot of the beliefs I held about coaching.

===Instant replay opposition===

Dungy opposes the use of replay review in the NFL. In 1997, after a failed vote by NFL owners to reinstate instant replay, Dungy said that he would have favored replay if it were applicable to all calls and if it were not associated with a team&#x27;s timeouts. The &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; described Dungy as &quot;vehemently opposed&quot; to replay in 2003, after the league had resumed using it.

In 2002, Dungy acknowledged he made a mistake by not challenging one of Peyton Manning&#x27;s interceptions, and he also criticized the league&#x27;s handling of replay challenges. &quot;We have plays where whistles are blown too fast, and I think we&#x27;re getting to the point where we&#x27;re letting coaches officiate the game,&quot; said Dungy, who said that it had become a trend for officials to expect coaches to challenge controversial calls.

Dungy has continued to criticize the NFL&#x27;s replay system in his role as a broadcaster on NBC. In 2019, after a failed challenge by Green Bay Packers coach Matt LaFleur, who contended that the Philadelphia Eagles committed pass interference that was not called on the field, Dungy said on television that the replay system was not working as intended. Dungy posted on his Twitter account, &quot;That&#x27;s terrible. I don&#x27;t understand this replay review of Pass Interference. That one on Philadelphia couldn&#x27;t have been more clear cut. If they&#x27;re not going to reverse that one I don&#x27;t see how they can reverse any call.&quot;

==Head coaching record==
==Broadcasting career==
NBC Sports hired Dungy in 2009 as a broadcast analyst for programming related to &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;. Dungy was hired at the same time as Rodney Harrison, and the two have appeared with other analysts on &quot;Football Night in America&quot;, NBC&#x27;s pregame show for &quot;SNF&quot;. In addition to his studio analyst duties, Dungy has joined Mike Tirico in the broadcast booth for live action of Thanksgiving Day games. He called the Jaguars–Chargers Wild Card playoff game in January 2023 with Al Michaels; the broadcast attracted criticism from fans who felt that Michaels and Dungy were not energetic enough. Michaels defended the broadcast, calling the criticism that he had read &quot;Internet compost&quot;.

NBC Sports placed Dungy in the broadcast booth for the 2020 Notre Dame football season, replacing Doug Flutie.

In 2021, on an open media call, Dungy criticized the NFL&#x27;s partnerships with seven sportsbooks, after a long period where the league opposed sports betting of any sort. &quot;I don’t know why the NFL changed its stance. My objection is just personal. I don’t think we should encourage people who are watching the NFL to gamble. Especially young people,&quot; Dungy said.

==Civic involvement==
In August 2007, President George W. Bush appointed Dungy a member of the President&#x27;s Council on Service and Civic Participation. The 25-member council represents leaders from government, business, entertainment, athletics and non-profit organizations committed to growing the spirit of service and civic participation. The two-year appointment requires attendance at two in-person meetings per year and quarterly phone conversations with assigned committees. After receiving the call from President Bush, Dungy remarked &quot;It was something that was really hard to believe. Certainly, when you go into football coaching, you’re not expecting to get presidential appointments to anything.&quot;

In March 2009, President Barack Obama invited Dungy to join the Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. He declined the invitation to join the council because of scheduling conflicts, as he could make only two of 2009&#x27;s four council meetings, but agreed to be an informal adviser on fatherhood issues.

He had also turned down offers from National Football League Players&#x27; Association to become liaison to the NFL.

==Personal life==
Dungy is an evangelical Christian, and at one point in his coaching career considered leaving football for the prison ministry. Throughout his career, he has remained involved with community service organizations.

Dungy is married to Lauren Dungy. They have 11 children: 3 biological children and 8 adopted children. Their oldest son died by suicide at age 18, outside of Tampa in 2005.

Dungy&#x27;s tenure in Tampa Bay as the head coach of the Buccaneers brought greater attention to his personal accomplishments outside of sports. He has been active in many community-service organizations in the cities in which he has coached. While in Tampa Bay, Dungy worked as a public speaker for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Athletes in Action.

He began a mentoring program for young people called Mentors for Life, and provided Buccaneers&#x27; tickets for the participants. He also supported other charitable programs in the area such as Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Boys and Girls Club, the Prison Crusade Ministry, foster parenting organizations, and Family First. He continues to assist Big Brothers/Big Sisters and the Boys and Girls Club in Indianapolis. He also supports the Black Coaches Association National Convention and Indiana Black Expo.

After Michael Sam, an openly gay player, was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in the 2014 NFL draft, Dungy said he would not have drafted Sam, saying, &quot;Not because I don&#x27;t believe Michael Sam should have a chance to play, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to deal with all of it.&quot; The comment drew criticism from some who viewed it as homophobic. Following a backlash, Dungy clarified his remarks, saying that he gave an &quot;honest answer&quot; to a question and that his concern would be with media coverage over Sam if he had been the player&#x27;s coach. Dungy has also expressed opposition to same-sex marriage. In 2023, Dungy shared, and later deleted and apologized for sharing, the litter boxes in schools hoax on his Twitter account. The act drew a rebuke from an NBC Sports spokesperson, and drew attention to past anti-LGBTQ statements by Dungy, but the network kept Dungy on his regularly scheduled broadcast assignments.

Dungy is opposed to abortion, and he served as a keynote speaker at the 2023 March for Life. Dungy opposed Florida Amendment 4, calling the amendment&#x27;s language &quot;deceptive&quot;.

On September 6, 2007, &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; reported that the Davie-Brown Index (DBI), an independent celebrity-rating service for advertisers, placed Dungy in the top 15 of the 900 actors, musicians, TV personalities, and sports celebrities it ranks for overall appeal, putting him on a level with actors such as Tom Hanks and Morgan Freeman. Among sports figures, he ranks second to Hank Aaron.

On February 27, 2008, Indiana Wesleyan University honored Dungy in a ceremony where he was inducted into IWU&#x27;s Society of World Changers. Dungy also received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from the university.

Since retirement, Dungy has become an informal mentor to the formerly suspended NFL player Michael Vick, counseling him during his incarceration, serving as his advocate in trying to get a team to have him on the roster (the Philadelphia Eagles later signed Vick to the team).

==Books==
Dungy&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Quiet Strength: The Principles, Practices, and Priorities of a Winning Life&quot;, was released on July 10, 2007 and reached No. 1 on the hardcover nonfiction section of the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list on August 5, 2007 and again on September 9, 2007. Tyndale House Publishers said it was the first NFL-related book ever ranked No. 1. When asked why he wrote &quot;Quiet Strength&quot;, Dungy said,

Dungy said he had actually gotten &quot;more satisfaction&quot; from the success of &quot;Quiet Strength&quot; than the Super Bowl win. That is because, he said, &quot;I’ve gotten so many calls and letters from people saying they really got something out of it, something that helped them.&quot; On January 10, 2008, &quot;Quiet Strength&quot; reached 1 million copies in print. &quot;Quiet Strength&quot; was on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller List for 32 weeks, including 27 in the top 10 for hardcover nonfiction.

Dungy also published a 96-page paperback called &quot;Quiet Strength: Men&#x27;s Bible Study&quot; on July 18, 2007. Dungy challenged men to answer six questions: What&#x27;s my game plan? What&#x27;s my strength? What&#x27;s success? Where&#x27;s my security? What&#x27;s my significance? And, what&#x27;s my legacy? The book is aimed specifically at men, including those who may not otherwise be interested in spiritual matters.

When asked if Dungy would consider writing a follow-up to &quot;Quiet Strength&quot;, Dungy said,

Dungy published a 24-page children&#x27;s picture book called &quot;You Can Do It&quot; with Little Simon Inspirations, a division of Simon &amp; Schuster on July 8, 2008, reached number one on the children&#x27;s picture books section of the &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller list on July 27, 2008 and stayed on the top 10 for 5 weeks. The book tells the story of Dungy&#x27;s younger brother Linden who struggles, then figures out his life dream and is encouraged by his family to follow that dream as a dentist. Dungy said that his other hopes for &quot;You Can Do It&quot; were that it would encourage parents to read to their kids and that kids would learn the lesson of pursuing whatever field they were talented in, even if it might not be the popular thing to do.

Dungy has also published &quot;Uncommon: Finding Your Path to Significance&quot;, a book revealing lessons on achieving significance that Dungy has learned. The book, released on February 17, 2009, with Tyndale House Publishers, particularly focuses on what it means to be a man of significance in a culture that is offering young men few positive role models. Dungy said,

&quot;Uncommon&quot; reached number two on the hardcover advice section of the &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller list and stayed on the top 10 for 9 weeks.

On August 3, 2010, Dungy released a new book entitled &quot;The Mentor Leader&quot;, which debuted at number two and stayed on the top 10 for 5 weeks on the hardcover advice section of the &quot;New York Times&quot; list.

On January 11, 2011, Dungy and wife Lauren released a new book entitled &quot;You Can Be a Friend&quot;. Their story teaches children what it means to be a good friend. The book debuted at number seven and stayed on the top 10 for 1 week on the children&#x27;s picture books section of &quot;The New York Times&quot; best seller list.

On January 22, 2019, Dungy released a new book entitled &quot;The Soul of a Team&quot;. The book was co-written with Nathan Whitaker, and their story illustrates what separates the truly great teams from the mediocre ones. &quot;Simply put, a team that has SOUL can and will accomplish far more than one that doesn’t.” Dungy writes.

<doc id="1069255" wikidata="Q6478354" url="?curid=1069255" title="Lake Waihola">
<text>Lake Waihola is a 640 ha tidal freshwater lake located 15 km north of Milton in Otago, in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. Its area is some 9 square kilometres, with a maximum length of 6 kilometres and a mean depth of 0.75m.

It is the larger of a pair of existing lakes—the other being Lake Waipori—which lie in a small area of low hills between the Taieri and Tokomairaro. Waihola is drained by the Waipori River, a tributary of the Taieri. Both lakes are very shallow and surrounded by wetlands, including the internationally renowned and protected Sinclair Wetlands which are the home to many species of wading birds. This shallowness is reflected in the name Waihola, the southern Māori form of the word &quot;waihora&quot;, which means &quot;spreading waters&quot;.

Lake Waihola is a popular day trip for holidaymakers from Dunedin, 40 km to the north. The small township of Waihola (population 200), nestled against the lake&#x27;s eastern edge, has facilities for fishing, yachting, and waterskiing, and the lake is an important rowing venue.

== History ==
Lake Waihola was used in the Otago gold rush. Ships used to travel up the Taieri River and across to the southern side of the lake where prospectors would traverse the hills and on to Gabriel&#x27;s Gully. In the early days of settlement a paddle-steamer, the &quot;Betsy Douglas&quot;, plied the lake&#x27;s waters from Owhiro, near Henley in the north to Clarendon at the lake&#x27;s southern end.

Lake Waihola is located at the southern end of the lower Taieri Plains and is the largest of a group of historical lakes that were once distributed between Lake Waihola and Mosgiel. Other neighbouring historical lakes include Lake Tatawai, Loch Ascog, Loch Katrine, Lake Potaka and Silverstream Lagoon

==Etymology==
Waihola&#x27;s name creates some interest as the Māori alphabet generally does not contain the letter &#x27;L&#x27;. It is, however, found in Southern Māori dialect, and is also found in several other central and southern South Island place names, such as Wangaloa in Otago and Little Akaloa in Canterbury. The word &quot;Waihola&quot; is generally accepted to be the southern variant of the word &quot;wai-hora&quot;, meaning &quot;spreading waters&quot;.

== Ecosystems ==
Lake Waihola has attracted international interest due to the ecosystems based in a shallow freshwater tidal system. Since 2000, Danish scientists have been conducting annual studies of the lake. Waihola is reputedly the home to a species of otter, the cryptid waitoreke, but no verified sightings have ever confirmed the animal&#x27;s existence.

==Health warnings==
Health warnings related to algae have been issued on the lake as of March 2017.

<text>Upper Canada Village is a heritage park near Morrisburg, Ontario, which depicts a 19th-century village in Upper Canada.

==History==
Construction of Upper Canada Village began in 1958 as part of the St. Lawrence Seaway project, which required the permanent flooding of ten communities in the area, known as The Lost Villages. Upper Canada Village was a part of the project&#x27;s heritage preservation plan. Many of the buildings in Upper Canada Village were transported directly from the villages to be flooded.

The park, owned and operated by the St. Lawrence Parks Commission, was opened to the public in 1961.

Other buildings from the Lost Villages were moved to Ault Park, where they comprise a living museum run by the Lost Villages Historical Society.
The park also incorporates a memorial to the Battle of Crysler&#x27;s Farm, a War of 1812 battle which also took place on land submerged by the Seaway project.

==Collection==

Upper Canada Village endeavours to depict life in a rural English Canadian setting during the year 1866. Featured at the site are over 40 historical buildings, including several working mills (woollen mill, grist-mill and sawmill) and trades buildings (blacksmith, tinsmith, cabinetmaker, cooper, bakery, cheese-maker). Farming is demonstrated through the growing, harvesting or processing of heritage vegetables and livestock. Aspects of late 19th-century domestic arts, social life, music, religion, and politics are also discussed, interpreted and demonstrated at by staff dressed in clothing of the period. Local gardens in the village feature the flora and fauna commonly grown in the summer

==In film==
The 1973 version of &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;, starring Josh Albee, Buddy Ebsen, Jane Wyatt and Vic Morrow was shot entirely on the grounds of Upper Canada Village.

==Affiliations==
The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

<text>Varvara Fyodorovna Stepanova (; – May 20, 1958) was a Russian artist. With her husband Alexander Rodchenko, she was associated with the Constructivist branch of the Russian avant-garde, which rejected aesthetic values in favour of revolutionary ones. Her activities extended into propaganda, poetry, stage scenery and textile designs.

==Biography==

Varvara Stepanova who was born in Kaunas (in modern-day Lithuania) came from peasant origins but was able to get an education at Kazan Art School, Kazan. There she met her later husband and collaborator Alexander Rodchenko. In the years before the Russian Revolution of 1917 they leased an apartment in Moscow, owned by Wassily Kandinsky. These artists became some of the main figures in the Russian avant-garde. The new abstract art in Russia which began around 1915 was a culmination of influences from Cubism, Italian Futurism and traditional peasant art. She designed Cubo-Futurist work for several artists&#x27; books, and studied under Jean Metzinger at Académie de La Palette, an art academy where the painters André Dunoyer de Segonzac and Henri Le Fauconnier also taught.

In the years following the revolution, Stepanova involved herself in poetry, philosophy, painting, graphic art, stage scenery construction, and textile and clothing designs. She contributed work to the Fifth State Exhibition and the Tenth State Exhibition, both in 1919.

In 1920 it came to a division between painters like Kasimir Malevich who continued to paint with the idea that art was a spiritual activity, and those who believed that they must work directly for the revolutionary development of the society. In 1921, together with Aleksei Gan, Rodchenko and Stepanova formed the first &quot;Working Group of Constructivists&quot;, which rejected fine art in favor of graphic design, photography, posters, and political propaganda. Also in 1921, Stepanova declared in her text for the exhibition &quot;5x5=25&quot;, held in Moscow:

Composition is the contemplative approach of the artist. Technique and Industry have confronted art with the problem of construction as an active process and not reflective. The &#x27;sanctity&#x27; of a work as a single entity is destroyed. The museum which was the treasury of art is now transformed into an archive.
The term &#x27;Constructivist&#x27; was by then being used by the artists themselves to describe the direction their work was taking. The theatre was another area where artists were able to communicate new artistic and social ideas. Stepanova designed the sets for &quot;The Death of Tarelkin&quot; in 1922.

Alexander Rodchenko died on December 3, 1956, and Varvara Stepanova died on May 20, 1958, both in Moscow.

==Clothing design and textiles==
In 1921, Stepanova moved almost exclusively into the realm of production, in which she felt her designs could achieve their broadest impact in aiding the development of the Soviet society. Russian Constructivist clothing represented the destabilization of the oppressive, elite aesthetics of the past and, instead, reflected utilitarian functionality and production. Gender and class distinctions gave way to functional, geometric clothing. In line with this objective, Stepanova sought to free the body in her designs, emphasizing clothing&#x27;s functional rather than decorative qualities. Stepanova deeply believed clothing must be looked at in action. Unlike the aristocratic clothing that she felt sacrificed physical freedom for aesthetics, Stepanova dedicated herself to designing clothing for particular fields and occupational settings in such a way that the object&#x27;s construction evinced its function. In addition, she sought to develop expedient means of clothing production through simple designs and strategic, economic use of fabrics.

=== Clothing designs ===
Stepanova, thus, identified clothing as occupying two groups: &quot;prozodezhda&quot; and &quot;sportodezhda&quot;. Within these categories, she attended to logical, efficient production and construction of the garments. However, war-induced poverty placed economic restrictions on the Russian Constructivists’ industrial fervor, and their direct engagement with production was never fully realized. Thus, most of her designs were not mass-produced and circulated.

The first, &quot;prozodezhda&quot;, or production/working clothing in basic styles, included theater costumes as well as professional and industrial garments. In the early 1920s, Stepanova entered the clothing industry through her costume designs in theater, in which she translated her artistic affinity for geometric shapes into functional, emblematic clothing. Made of dark blue and grey material, the graphic costumes allowed actors to maximize the appearance of their movements, exaggerating them for the stage and transforming the body into a dynamic composition of geometric shapes and lines.

Within this category, Stepanova began designing &quot;spetsodezhda&quot;, or clothing specialized for a specific occupation. In doing so, she designed clothing for men and women in both industrial and professional capacities with meticulous consideration of seaming, pockets, and buttons to ensure each aspect of the costume maintained a functional intention. Regardless of the occupational context, her working clothing carried a distinctive geometric and linear edge, rendering the body into a graphic composition and boxy, androgynous form.

The second category, &quot;sportodezhda&quot;, or sports costumes, also presented bold lines, large forms, and contrasting colors to enable and emphasize the body&#x27;s movements and allow spectators to easily distinguish one team from the other. Stepanova even rendered the team&#x27;s emblem into a graphic design. The sports arena offered a context for Stepanova to realize an idealized bodily neutralization, and her uniforms were often unisex with pants and a belted tunic that obscured the human form.

=== Textile production ===

Stepanova carried out her ideal of engaging with industrial production in the following year when she, with Lyubov Popova, became designer of textiles at the Tsindel (the First State Textile Factory) near Moscow, and in 1924 became professor of textile design at the Vkhutemas (Higher Technical Artistic Studios). As a constructivist, Stepanova not only transposed bold graphic designs onto her fabrics, but also focused heavily on their production. Stepanova only worked a little over a year at The First Textile Printing Factory, but she designed more than 150 fabric designs in 1924. Although she was inspired to develop new types of fabric, the current technology restricted her to printed patterns on monotone surfaces. By her own artistic choice, she also limited her color palette to one or two dyes. Although she only used triangles, circles, squares, and lines, Stepanova superimposed these geometric forms onto one another to create a dynamic, multi-dimensional design.

== Graphic design ==

Stepanova practiced typography, book design and contributed to the magazine &quot;LEF&quot; throughout the early 1920s. As part of a government campaign to promote universal literacy, Stepanova organized a &quot;Book Evening&quot; in 1924. This was a performance that featured characters from pre- and post-revolutionary literature battling each other.

==Legacy==
On October 22, 2018, Stepanova was honoured with a Google Doodle posthumously on her 124th birthday.

Stepanova&#x27;s work was included in the 2021 exhibition &quot;Women in Abstraction&quot; at the Centre Pompidou.

<text>Mountain Creek is a ski resort in Vernon Township, Sussex County, New Jersey, United States. It is located on New Jersey Route 94 in the New York Metropolitan Area, from the George Washington Bridge. 

Mountain Creek contains of land for skiing area, night skiing, snowboarding, and snowmaking activities. The resort also includes a snow tubing park, zip-lines, an alpine coaster, a bike park, and a seasonal water park that operates from May to September. Mountain Creek has a total of 7 lifts and 2 magic carpets.

Mountain Creek was owned and operated by Intrawest Resorts Holdings, Inc. until May 2010 when it was sold to neighboring Crystal Springs Resort. Crystal Springs then sold the property to a New Jersey family. On May 5, 2017, Mountain Creek filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The resort emerged from bankruptcy in August 2019.

==History==

===1965–71: Great Gorge Resort===
Great Gorge Resort was founded in McAfee, an unincorporated area of Vernon Township, in 1965 by three families (the Kurlanders, Fitzgeralds, and Bakers) who worked at the now-closed Snow Bowl Ski Resort in Milton, New Jersey. Great Gorge was built on the former Fredericks farm.

Mountain Creek&#x27;s Bear and South Peaks were the original Great Gorge Resort, with the current South Base Ski Patrol building serving as the Base Lodge. The original lodge was designed by Alexander McIlvaine, who also designed the lodges at Stratton Mountain in Vermont and Squaw Valley in Olympic Valley, California. The World&#x27;s Fair was held in Flushing, NY in 1964-1965. When the fair closed, the entire contents of the Swiss Pavilion were purchased and were transported to be incorporated into the new lodge at Great Gorge. Great Gorge was the first ski area in the United States to use a jet engine to power their snow-making operations&#x27; air compressors. The jet engine was purchased from the Curtiss-Wright Company in Fairfield, New Jersey. The jet engine was located in a building in the parking lot across the street from the new lodge.

Skiers Donna Weinbrecht and Jamie Kurlander, who have been inducted into the Sussex County Sports Hall of Fame, skied at Great Gorge.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Great Gorge ski area hosted a summer zoo at the base of the mountain. The ski area also had a ski jump that was used all year long. In the off seasons, Sno-Mats were used on the trails as well as on the jump and landing area. Grass skiing demonstrations were also held in the off-season on the slopes and ski races were held on the Sno-Mats. In the winter, the ski jump was covered with snow. 

The New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway operates tracks that abut the back of the Great Gorge South parking lot. For a time in the 1970s, there was a seasonal train operated by the railroad which offered skiers a way to the slopes and then returned them home. 

In 1971, Great Gorge North was built on what is now Mountain Creek&#x27;s Granite Peak, and a connecting trail was cut to connect Great Gorge North and the original resort, which was renamed Great Gorge South. A connecting chair lift was also installed - the Sojourn double. Great Gorge North was part of a master plan that included a never-built Olympic ski-jump and training facility.

Also in 1971, Playboy opened their $20 million, 650-room Great Gorge Playboy Club on of land a mile away from Great Gorge. Plans for the Playboy Club included a casino and gondola from the hotel to the base at Great Gorge North, neither of which were ever built. Gambling casinos were never approved outside of Atlantic City. The hotel hosted many celebrity shows and boxing events. The Playboy Club hotel closed in the 1980s.

In late 1971, Great Gorge was foreclosed by their lender after a number of seasons brought little snow to the resort.

===1971–97: Vernon Valley/Great Gorge===
In 1968, Vernon Valley Ski Resort opened to the north of Great Gorge. After the foreclosure of Great Gorge South and Great Gorge North, they were sold to Vernon Valley, which merged the three ski areas to form the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge Resort (VVGG).

In 1974, VVGG was purchased by Great American Recreation (GAR), which invested in snowmaking equipment that allowed the new resort to survive seasons with little snow. In 1978, VVGG opened Action Park, a seasonal amusement park with over 75 rides and attractions including 40 water slides, bungee jumping, go-karts, bumper boats and mini golf.

During the 1980s Cobblestone Village, a small shopping and dining village was built. The decade also saw the development of Great Gorge Village, a 1300-unit condo development of what were originally luxury housing units, and the Spa, at Great Gorge, a four-star luxury resort and spa complete with an 18-hole golf course and a number of indoor and outdoor swimming pools. VVGG continued to upgrade its skiing operations, installing several new lifts, including a triple chairlift in 1981.

In 1989, GAR negotiated a deal with International Broadcasting Corporation (IBC) to sell the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski resort for $50 million. IBC backed out of the deal after inspecting the property.

In 1995, GAR filed for bankruptcy. In 1996, only Vernon Valley opened, with Great Gorge North and South closed due to bankruptcy. Before the 1997 season, GAR shut down Vernon Valley/Great Gorge and Action Park.

In 1998, the remaining assets of Great American Recreation were divided and sold. Eugene Mulvihill Sr. retained control of the Great Gorge golf and hotel area of the resort, which was renamed Crystal Springs Resort. The three ski areas and Action Park were sold to Intrawest, a Canadian-based owner and operator of ski resorts.

===The 2000s: Mountain Creek under Intrawest===

Intrawest renamed its holdings Mountain Creek and began to refurbish the resort. Intrawest removed 11 of the 13 lifts, replacing them with a gondola, known as the &quot;Cabriolet&quot;, along with two chairlifts and multiple-fix grip chairs. The Great Gorge Lodge was updated and renamed Mountain Creek South Lodge. Intrawest also installed more than 1,600 new snow guns throughout the mountain. The new resort opened in December 1998. Intrawest also began construction on Action Park, removing all the amusement rides except for the Alpine Slide and Bungee Tower, as well as the Motorworld section of the park, and began work on the Waterworld section of the park. The water park reopened as Mountain Creek Waterpark in the summer of 1998.

Intrawest drafted a master plan for the resort, whose centerpiece was an expansive residential and shopping village, a staple of Intrawest resorts, but which never happened. Included in the village plans were a conference center, hotels, condos, townhouses, shops and restaurants. On the mountaintop was to be a golf course surrounded by a hotel and condos. This mountaintop development was scrapped, however, as the land that it was located on was sold by the State of New Jersey to Mountain Creek&#x27;s previous owners, Great American Recreation, with a deed restriction that stated the land was to be used only for passive recreation, such as fishing, hiking and camping. Intrawest then sold the land back to the state for $7 million and permission to expand skiing on portions of the mountain where it was previously prohibited.

On October 10, 1999, the 31-year-old Vernon base lodge was destroyed in a fire just weeks before the 1999-2000 ski season. A temporary complex of prefabricated tents was quickly constructed in order to continue operations for the upcoming season. The tent complex included a food court, restaurant and bar, and numerous rental and retail shops. While Intrawest originally planned to replace the complex after one year, plans for a new base lodge were put on hold for an unspecified reason. The decaying tent complex remained operational for approximately 13 years through the 2010–11 ski season before being replaced by a permanent lodge named the Red Tail Lodge.

In 2002, Mountain Creek opened the first phase of its master-planned resort village, Black Creek Sanctuary, a luxury condo community. In winter 2003 construction began on The Appalachian, a luxury condominium and hotel built on the former parking lot of Vernon base. Parking was moved to the other side of Rt. 94 to the former location of Action Park&#x27;s amusement ride and bumper boat area. The Appalachian condo/hotel opened for the 2006–07 season.

The Chevy U.S. Snowboarding Grand Prix was held at Mountain Creek in both 2004 and 2005. The centerpiece of this event was Mountain Creek&#x27;s Superpipe, one of the only superpipes in the east. The Superpipe went quiet after this and has not been used since. For summer 2006 Intrawest opened the Diablo Mountain Bike Park on Vernon Peak, which featured numerous downhill trails serviced by the Cabriolet gondola.

Mountain Creek opened its 2007–08 winter sports season with a few notable changes to the trail map. The eastern side of Vernon Peak, which used to be home to its freestyle terrain park, was converted into intermediate slopes. The entire Mountain Creek South area (South Peak and Bear Peak) was converted to freestyle terrain park. This angered many long-time season pass holders and many did not renew their passes. A special terrain park pass was now needed to use this area of the mountain. All slopes off those peaks are intermediate trails with additional ratings for the kind of freestyle terrain from small to extra large. Additionally, a long intermediate trail off the Granite Peak, called Granite View, was closed. Minor changes were also made in the dining structure, including replacement of the one-time-use rental lockers with a more compact bag-check station. In addition, a helipad was located in the rear of the Mountain Creek South parking lot (from the inception of the resort when it was Great Gorge) where people with life-threatening injuries are airlifted to the regional emergency medical centers.

In 2008, Intrawest representatives stated that during the previous two years, Intrawest and the resort industry in general experienced a significant softening of the real estate market, which included Mountain Creek, and Intrawest could not commit to completing the village. The Intrawest / Fortress Investments Co. filed for bankruptcy protection and sold off many of the resorts that it owned. The Mountain Creek Resort was sold and became part of the Crystal Springs Resort.

===2010: Mountain Creek becomes part of Crystal Springs Resort===
Intrawest sold Mountain Creek to the adjacent Crystal Springs Resort in May 2010, returning the entire resort to its previous ownership. The new owners immediately went to work on improving the mountain, replacing the tent complex at Vernon with a new lodge that opened in time for the 2011-12 ski season. A three-story building, it contains new offices, bars, fine dining restaurant, food court, rental and locker facilities and an outdoor patio.

In summer 2012, Mountain Creek continued improvement plans, opening a new zip line course at the mountaintop lake above Vernon Peak and an Alpine coaster on the lower mountainside near the waterpark. For that winter the resort expanded and relocated its tubing park across the street, renaming it the Dropzone. The Diablo Mountain Bike Park was also transferred to company control and renamed Mountain Creek Bike Park.

In 2010 Sojourn Double, the chairlift that transported people from South to Granite Peak, was retired after 40 years of service. A new fixed-grip double chairlift was installed and opened in time for the 2012–13 season. The new lift has replaced plans for a new trail that would have connected the South peak to Granite Peak, since they realized when working to build the new trail that the topography of the mountain does not go in that direction.

===2015: Mountain Creek changes hands again===
HSK-MC, a partner in a group that purchased Mountain Creek in 2010, bought out the rights, which made it the sole owner of the Mountain Creek properties. Since the Koffman family (which controls HSK-MC) already was a partial owner of the property, it is said that normal operations will continue. However, the fate of the indoor water park is now in question, since that was planned under Mulvihill&#x27;s control of the property.

<text>Wilfrid Laurier Heighington, (July 30, 1897 – 23 March 1945) was a Canadian soldier, writer, lawyer and politician.

==Background==
Heighington attended Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario, leaving in 1915 to join the Canadian Expeditionary Force in World War I. He was twice wounded in and twice mentioned in dispatches. After recuperating from serious wounds he returned to France to fight at the Somme and Vimy Ridge. He ended the war with the rank of captain.

He became a lawyer following the war, was called to the bar in 1920, and was appointed King&#x27;s Counsel eleven years later.

==Politics==
Heighington was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1929 Ontario general election as the Conservative Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the St. David electoral district in Toronto, Ontario. He was re-elected in 1934 despite the province wide landslide that brought the Ontario Liberal Party to power under Mitchell Hepburn. He represented the Legislature as part of its official delegation on the pilgrimage to the Canadian National Vimy Memorial&#x27;s official dedication ceremony in France.

He was a candidate in the 1936 Conservative leadership election, placing fifth. The following year he narrowly lost his seat in the legislature in the 1937 Ontario general election. Despite being out of the legislature, Heighington ran again for the party leadership in 1938, and came in third, but with fewer votes (only 41). George Drew won the leadership on the first ballot.

==Later life==
Heighington was a prolific writer authoring articles and poems for &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, &quot;The Star Weekly&quot; and other periodicals, many of which were reissued in a book, &quot;Whereas and Whatnot&quot; (1934). In 1943, he published the war novel &quot;The Cannon&#x27;s Mouth&quot;.

He was still active with the military when he was hospitalized on 17 March 1945. He died due to complications from pneumonia at St. Michael&#x27;s hospital on the evening of 23 March.

From 1990 to 2003, she worked for the Linguistic Normalisation Consortium (&quot;Consorci per a la normalització lingüística&quot;), including a stint as the head of the Linguistic Normalisation Center in the Ciutat Vella district of Barcelona.

==Civic background==
She is a member of several associations, including &quot;Ca la Dona&quot; (Woman&#x27;s House), the &quot;Centre Catòlic de L&#x27;Hospitalet&quot; (Catholic Center of L&#x27;Hospitalet) and the &quot;Centre d’Estudis de L&#x27;Hospitalet&quot; (L&#x27;Hospitalet Studies Center). She has also been affiliated with the CONC, a Catalan union confederated with the CCOO, since 1990, and served on the works council of the Linguistic Normalisation Consortium.

==Political career==
A member of the Republican Left of Catalonia since 1990, Simó was president of the local branch of ERC in L&#x27;Hospitalet de Llobregat from 1996 to 2002. She has been a member of the ERC&#x27;s national council since 1994 and of its national executive council since 1998, serving as the party&#x27;s national secretary for social policy from 2001 to 2004.

Simó was elected to the city council of l&#x27;Hospitalet in May 2003 and named to the local council of the Barcelonès &quot;comarca&quot;, resigning both posts when she entered the Catalan government later that year.

She was elected to the Catalan parliament in 2006 and was the spokeswoman for the party&#x27;s parliamentary group, a position she held since 2008.
Simó was named first secretary of the Parliament on 26 October 2015 until the dissolution of the parliament by the application of Article 155 on 27 October 2017.

==Catalan independence crisis and judicial case==

On 27 October 2017 the Catalan Parliament declared independence in a vote boycotted by opposition MPs. Almost immediately the Senate of Spain invoked article 155 of the constitution, dismissing Puigdemont and the Catalan government and imposing direct rule on Catalonia. The following day Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dissolved the Catalan Parliament and called for fresh regional elections on 21 December 2017.

On 30 October 2017 Spanish Attorney General José Manuel Maza laid charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds at the Supreme Court against Corominas and five other members of the Board of the Parliament of Catalonia (Ramona Barrufet, Carme Forcadell, Lluís Guinó, Joan Josep Nuet and Lluís Corominas). Corominas was charged despite not being a member of the board at the time of the declaration of independence. The charges carried maximum sentences of 30, 15 and 6 years in prison respectively.

Simó and the other members of the board appeared before Supreme Court judge Pablo Llarena on 9 November 2017. Nuet was released without any precautionary measures but the other five had to pay bail (€100,000 for Forcadell, €25,000 each for Barrufet, Corominas, Guinó and Simó), surrender their passport and present themselves at a court weekly. The bail bonds were paid by the Catalan National Assembly.

After a four-month judicial investigation into the referendum and declaration of independence Supreme Court judge Pablo Llarena issued a 70-page ruling on 23 March 2018 in which he ordered that 25 of the 28 Catalan politicians and activists under investigation be tried for rebellion, embezzlement or disobedience. Corominas was charged with disobeying an order of the Constitutional Court (article 410 of the criminal code).

A pre-trial hearing commenced on 18 December 2018 at the Supreme Court at which defence lawyers argued that the court was not competent to hear charges of rebellion or disobedience and that it should be heard at the High Court of Justice of Catalonia. On 27 December 2018 the Supreme Court ruled that, although they were competent to hear all the charges, the six defendants charged only with disobedience (Barrufet, Mireia Boya, Corominas, Guinó, Nuet and Simó) would be tried at the High Court of Justice of Catalonia.

In 2019, she was one of the defendants in the Trial of Catalonia independence leaders.

<doc id="1069292" wikidata="Q844290" url="?curid=1069292" title="Sainte-Marie among the Hurons">
<text>Sainte-Marie among the Hurons () was a French Jesuit settlement in Huronia or Wendake, the land of the Wendat, near modern Midland, Ontario, from 1639 to 1649. It was the first European settlement in what is now the province of Ontario. Eight missionaries from Sainte-Marie were martyred, and were canonized by the Catholic Church in 1930. Sainte-Marie Among the Hurons was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1920. A reconstruction of the mission now operates as a living museum.

A nearby historic site, Carhagouha, marks the spot where an earlier Récollet missionary to Wendake, Father Joseph Le Caron, presided in 1615 over the first Catholic mass conducted in present-day Ontario. Another related site of historical interest is Saint-Louis Mission National Historic Site, located in present-day Victoria Harbour, Ontario. It was at Saint-Louis that Jesuit missionaries Jean de Brébeuf and Gabriel Lalement were captured when the Wendat village was attacked by the Iroquois on March 16, 1649.

==History==
Sainte-Marie among the Hurons was established in 1639 by French Jesuits, Fathers Jérôme Lalemant and Jean de Brébeuf in the land of the Wendat. The fortified missionary settlement acted as a centre and base of operations for Jesuit missionaries on the outskirts of what is now Midland, Ontario as they worked amongst the Huron. It also provided an example of a functioning European community to the Huron. The mission was built near the Huron settlement of &quot;Quieunonascaranas&quot;, led by chief Auoindaon.

The mission was initially founded by 18 men. Arriving in November 1639, the priests erected a makeshift shelter out of &quot;cypress&quot; (probably eastern white cedar) pillars and a birch bark roof, using clay to build the interior walls. After the arrival of carpenter Charles Boivin, further construction resulted in a chapel, a residence for the Jesuits, a cookhouse, a smithy and other buildings. Sainte-Marie became the Jesuit headquarters in Huronia, from which the Jesuits travelled among the Iroquoian-speaking Huron and Petun, and the Algonquian-speaking Nipissing, Ottawa and Ojibwa peoples, whose languages were distinct but related to each other.

==Missionary life==

A small group of religiously devoted men, also known as &quot;donnés&quot; (offered, given or gifts), worked at Sainte-Marie among the Hurons, in return for food, clothing, and shelter. The Jesuits hired &quot;engagés&quot;, labourers, and non-clerical Jesuits known as &quot;lay brothers&quot;. The Jesuits preached the Christian Gospel to the Huron, often adapting the story to local customs and symbols. One of the most famous examples of this was the &quot;Huron Carol&quot;, a Christmas hymn written by Jean de Brébeuf. A translated version of this song remains popular in Canadian churches to this day.

Soldiers had a small but important presence at the mission. Twenty-three soldiers wintered at Sainte-Marie in 1644, but many of the Jesuits resisted the idea of a military presence. They feared the soldiers would &quot;bring the worst of Europe&quot; with them.

The founding of the mission led to division amongst the Wendat, with conflict between those who converted to Christianity and those who maintained traditional beliefs. Infectious disease, an unintended result of first contact between the Jesuits, their farm animals and the Wendat, served to further the gap between the traditional Wendat and the missionaries. Epidemics of smallpox, which raged from 1634–1640, were brought by the increased number of children emigrating to the colonies with families from cities where the disease was endemic in France, England and the Netherlands. Also during this time, the rivalry between the Wendat and Iroquois began to reignite. The Wendat were weakened by their internal divisions and their losses from disease. Prior to their contact with Europeans, the Wendat numbered twenty to twenty-five thousand. By 1642, after epidemics of Old World diseases, they numbered 9,500.

==War and martyrdom==
With Iroquois aggression on the rise, an additional six soldiers were dispatched from France in 1649. The weakened Wendat nation was little match for the strengthened Iroquois, who had used their trading alliances with the Dutch to gain firearms.

Eight of the missionaries—St. Jean de Brébeuf (1649), St. Noël Chabanel (1649), St. Antoine Daniel (1648), St. Charles Garnier (1649), St. René Goupil (1642), St. Isaac Jogues (1646), St. Jean de Lalande (1646), and St. Gabriel Lalemant (1649)—were killed in the Huron-Iroquois War. Owing to the proximity of their deaths to Sainte-Marie, the French recovered the bodies of Brébeuf and Lalemant to be buried at the mission.

==Burning of Sainte-Marie==

On June 16, 1649, the missionaries chose to burn the mission rather than risk it being desecrated or permanently overrun by Iroquois in further attacks. Father Paul Ragueneau wrote,&quot;We ourselves set fire to it, and beheld burn before our eyes and in less than one hour, our work of nine or ten years.&quot;

Before the burning, the survivors had decided that Brébeuf and Lalemant would be canonized as martyrs. Shoemaker Christophe Regnault had to extract the bones of the two men to save as relics. Regnault exhumed the bodies, placed them into a lye solution and wrapped the bones in linens. The men&#x27;s flesh remains were reburied together in the same grave.

The missionaries travelled to &quot;Gahoendoe&quot; with the Wendat in an effort to construct a second mission designed especially for defence. It was named Ste. Marie II. A severe winter and the constant threat of Iroquois attack eventually forced the French from the area, and they travelled back to New France. They took along the bones of Brébeuf and Lalemant on both trips. The bones have been held as holy relics at Ste. Marie II, which can be visited across from the Anglican church on Christian Island.

==Modern reconstruction==
The site lay dormant until 1844, when Jesuit Fr. Pierre Chazelle conducted initial site excavations. Father Félix Martin continued this in 1855. In 1940 the Society of Jesus purchased the property where Sainte-Marie had stood. In 1941, Kenneth Kidd of the Royal Ontario Museum undertook the first scientific excavations of the site, aided by W.J. Wintemberg. Wilfrid and Elsie Jury of the University of Western Ontario undertook additional excavations. In 1954 Fr. Dennis Hegarty discovered the graves of Brébeuf and Lalemant.

Starting in 1964, Sainte-Marie was reconstructed as a historical site and living museum. All of the buildings and their contents are reproductions. A popular tourist attraction, it draws thousands of visitors each week during the summer months. The site is managed by Huronia Historical Parks, an agency of the Ontario Ministry of Tourism and Culture.

Canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1930, the eight martyred missionaries are collectively known as the Canadian Martyrs. The site adjacent to the Martyrs&#x27; Shrine was visited by Pope John Paul II in 1984 as part of his papal visit to Canada.

On August 22, 2006, three of the reconstructed buildings—the blacksmith forge, carpenter&#x27;s workshop and the chapel—were severely damaged in a fire. They have since been rebuilt.

==Affiliations==
The museum is affiliated with the Canadian Museums Association, the Canadian Heritage Information Network and the Virtual Museum of Canada.

<text>Disney&#x27;s Blizzard Beach is a water theme park located at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida, near Orlando. All water areas are heated to approximately , with the exception of the melting snow in the ice cave of Cross Country Creek.

The park opened on April 1, 1995, as the third Walt Disney World water park. In 2016, the park hosted approximately 2,091,000 guests, ranking it the third-most visited water park in the world behind its sister park Typhoon Lagoon. Blizzard Beach is open year-round with an annual maintenance closure in the winter. During the Blizzard Beach closures, Typhoon Lagoon usually remains open. 

Most major attractions at the park are found atop Mount Gushmore, an artificial hill with an elevation of . Mount Gushmore is split into three colored slopes to aid guests navigating around the park: Green, Red, and Purple.

The park&#x27;s winter theming was conceived by designer-Imagineer Marshall Monroe, a Creative Executive and Principal Technical Staff at the Walt Disney Company.  Innovative elements of the park include a beach chair-themed chair lift, complete with beach umbrellas, and pretend snow skis. The setting and atmosphere of the park blend together tropical landscaping with simulated melting snow. The central mountain is unique as a large structure in the high water table Floridian woodland. The architecture brings together an aesthetic of alpine lodges with Caribbean colors and accents.

The water park, along with all the other Walt Disney World parks, closed in March 2020 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon remained closed while the four other Walt Disney World theme parks reopened from July 11–15, 2020. Disney&#x27;s Blizzard Beach reopened at Walt Disney World Resort on March 7, 2021, after being closed for nearly a year.

==Park story==

According to Disney &quot;legend,&quot; a freak snowstorm on January 11, 1977, in the area led to the development of Florida&#x27;s first ski resort. Ski lifts were put up, toboggan runs were laid down, and an entire resort area blossomed around the mountain of snow. Naturally, because of the normal temperatures in Florida, the snow dissipated very quickly, and the snow rapidly turned into slush. This left behind a collection of waterlogged yet snowless ski jumps and chair lifts. The operators were preparing to cut their losses and walk away. However, they were interrupted by a loud yell coming from the summit of the mountain of melting snow, and looked up to see a blue alligator sliding down the mountain at top speed. Ice Gator, the blue cartoon mascot of the park, then landed in a pool of melted snow at the base of the mountain with a thunderous splash. The ski resort operators suddenly saw the park&#x27;s potential, and the mountain of snow became Disney&#x27;s Blizzard Beach, &quot;the most slushy, slippery, exhilarating water park anywhere!&quot;

As the story goes in Disney&#x27;s promotional materials, slalom courses, bobsled, and toboggan runs became downhill water slides. The creek of melted snow that formed at the base of the mountain became a relaxing tube ride. The chairlift carried swimmers instead of skiers. The ski jump became the &quot;tallest and fastest water slide in the world.&quot;

==Park layout==

===Green Slope===
The Green Slope attractions (all single-track water slides, not meant for racing), are found at the uppermost point of Mount Gushmore. They can be accessed by foot, or by chairlift. The chairlift is a one-way ride except for guests with disabilities.
* is the park&#x27;s flagship attraction at tall and speeds of up to . It&#x27;s the third tallest and fastest free-fall slide in the world. There is a minimum height requirement of . Summit Plummet is one of the highest and fastest water slides on Earth, coming in just behind &quot;Insano&quot; at Beach Park in Brazil.
* is the world&#x27;s longest family white-water raft ride at long. This attraction sends guests down a twisting series of rushing waterfalls. Water park guests sit in large blue rubber rafts, which can hold a minimum of four and maximum of six people, and hold on to handles while they ride. No infants are allowed, and other health restrictions are advised.
* is a , snow-banked mountain gully body slide attraction that reaches speeds up to . In two places, the slope levels off, only to drop back down again. As such, it is one of only a few water slides where air time is achieved.

===Purple Slope===
The Purple Slope attractions (all of which have at least two nearly identical tracks, and are designed for racing) can be reached via a pathway near the catch pool of Downhill Double Dipper.

* is one of the world&#x27;s only side-by-side racing tube slides. It is located next to Snow Stormers on Mount Gushmore. This attraction&#x27;s slides are high and long. Guests travel up to speeds of on these twin inner tube runs, where they pass by ski racing graphics and flags. Time clocks count off each downhill heat, and the runs are outfitted with automated audio equipment that signals the start of each race. This is one of few racing slides where push-off speed is not a factor, as gates hold back riders until it is time for the race to begin. This attraction has a minimum height requirement of .
* is a mat slide consisting of three flumes that are long. This attraction sits between Downhill Double Dipper and Toboggan Racers on Mount Gushmore. The attraction descends from the top of the mountain and follows a switchback course through ski-type slalom gates. Guests lie on their stomachs on the toboggan-style mat as they ride down the flumes. Riders pick up mats at the top of the attraction (which shares a mat conveyor with Toboggan Racers).
* is an 8-lane, water slide next to Snow Stormers on Mount Gushmore. The attraction sends guests racing over dips as they descend the slope along the side of Mount Gushmore. Similar to Snow Stormers, guests lie on their stomach on the toboggan-style mat as they race each other to the finish line.

===Red Slope===
The Red Slope is found at the very rear of the park, containing only one attraction (a multi-slide attraction with convergent tracks, not designed for racing).

* is a inner tube run featuring two open slides and one enclosed tube slide. This attraction sends guests down twisting flumes, passing through corrugated steel pipes. Tubes can be picked up at the bottom of the attraction. The ride is not accessible, as stairs are the only way to reach the attraction. After reopening in 2018, at the completion of a year-long refurbishment, one of the open tube slides was closed down. In 2019, the third tube slide re-opened.

===Ground level===
* is a wave pool at the base of Mount Gushmore. This attraction is constantly fed by &quot;melting snow&quot; waterfalls creating &quot;bobbing&quot; (short) waves.
* is a is a lazy river ride that travels around the perimeter of the water park. The attraction carries floating guests (in inner tubes) through a faux ice cave. Once inside the cave, guests will be splashed with &quot;melting&quot; ice from overhead. There are seven entrances and exits for this attraction located throughout the park, and at any of these locations, guests may pick up tubes or leave them behind as they exit. The journey takes between twenty and thirty minutes to complete depending on crowd level.
* Training Camp is an area for pre-teenage children.
** Leisure Pool is a pool that contains &quot;icebergs&quot; on which guests under 12 can walk across.
** Fahrenheit Drops, commonly known as the &quot;T-Bar&quot;, is a rope drop attraction that deposits guests that are under tall into of water.
** Freezin&#x27; Pipe Springs is a short body slide attraction. It deposits guests in the same water area as Fahrenheit Drops, but has no height restriction.
** Cool Runners is a wide-open slide (inner tube) area created by rapidly melting snow mounds (moguls). Was formerly occupied by Mogul Mania, which was said to have never opened to the public due to safety concerns.
* features gentle slides designed to resemble scaled-down versions of attractions at Blizzard Beach and characters from Frozen. Also included is a snow-castle fountain play area with pop (water) jets. Picnic benches are nearby. Management suggest wearing footwear to protect from hot pavement. The attraction is limited to children under .
*The Chairlift is a &quot;one-way&quot; ride that carries up to 3 guests over the craggy face of Mount Gushmore from its base at the beach to its summit. The chairs carrying guests feature wooden bench seats, colorful overhead umbrellas, and snow skis on their undersides. This is the most common means of transport to the summit, but guests can also climb a staircase to the top. A gondola is also provided for disabled guests to access the top of Mount Gushmore. There is a minimum height requirement of to ride alone.

====Food and beverage====
*Avalunch offers light snacks and refreshments. It is located next to the entrance of the Chairlift.
*Frostbite Freddie&#x27;s is a bar located adjacent to Snowless Joe&#x27;s in the Village.
*Lottawatta Lodge is a ski lodge providing outdoor covered seating and is the main counter service area.

<doc id="1069300" wikidata="Q4020990" url="?curid=1069300" title="Worth1000">
<text>Worth1000 was an image manipulation and contest website.

Worth1000 opened on January 1, 2002, and hosted over 340,000 unique images made in theme contests such as &quot;Rejected Transformers&quot;, &quot;Invisible World&quot;, and &quot;Stupid Protests&quot;. In mid-2003, Worth1000 began hosting similar competitions for photography, creative writing, and multimedia. The service was shut down on 1 October 2013. In June 2014 the site was acquired by Sydney based crowdsourcing site DesignCrowd from Emerge Media.

The website was designed by Avi Muchnick and Israel Derdik. Muchnick named it after the old saying &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words&quot;.

Worth1000 and its members have created three books on image manipulation: &quot;When Pancakes Go Bad&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Human in My Throat&quot;, and &quot;More Than One Way to Skin a Cat&quot;.

==Contests==
Competition mostly took place in a series of themed contests. A subject title was given along with a sample photo manipulation from a previous or similar contest and a brief description of what contestants should try to do. Entries were then accepted for a fixed period of time, after which they were posted so people could vote on them, and the results were then compiled. Examples of contests were:
*Reality manga - Alter photos of real people (celebrities are popular) so that they look like Japanese anime drawings come to life.
*Chimaera – Create a new animal by mating three or four other animals to one.
*Invisible world - Take any object or person in an image and make it invisible using photoshop. No indication or outline of the object/animal/person should be seen, except through its function/interaction with other objects and/or people in the image. Some images, are based in the 1897 H. G. Wells science-fiction novella, &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;.
*If Goths ruled – Show what the world would look like if Goths ruled it.
Others include mating animals with instruments or plants, zombifying or aging celebrities, combining several movies to one, and many others.

Photoshop contests were the main attraction of Worth1000, but it also had a variety of contests for photography, writing, illustration, and a multimedia. Along with the regular contests, members of Worth1000 could challenge each other in head-to-head competitions as well.

==Forums==
The Worth1000 site had a large community as well as a selection of forums. The forums were a place for general discussions and humor, and questions and answers regarding techniques for the various types of contests. Due to the many active admins and a word-filter that monitored the forums, a high level of troll control existed.

==Intramural competitors==
Similar sites have competed in an intramural tournament with Worth1000.com, including:
*Something Awful&#x27;s Photoshop Phriday
*Fark

==Shutdown and later history==

On August 12, 2013, Worth1000&#x27;s founder, Avi Muchnick, announced in the community forums that Worth1000 would be closed and converted into a static museum. The final contest was scheduled to end on the midnight changeover (Worth time) of September 29/30.

Worth1000 was scheduled to close at midnight on 30 September 2013, but problems with the transfer of the site to the Static Museum status meant that it stayed open for a further 24 hours. However, once that period had passed users were greeted with a single page with the message that the site was now closed and would resurface within the next few days as a museum. However, after a brief hiatus, Muchnick announced via a cryptic 1 Corinthians 15:4 message and an image from Worth&#x27;s archives of the Turin Shroud. Posted to Worth&#x27;s &#x27;refugee&#x27; website communities on Google+ and Reddit, former users found that the site had been sold to Emerge Media and would re-open soon.

Worth1000 returned to the version of the site that existed in the week before the shutdown, one week after the instigation of the museum. Over the following months, the new team transferred the site to new servers. However, ongoing technical issues and with declining popularity and an alienated user base, the new owners announced the intention to rebrand, redesign and invigorate the site. Contests were hosted to create logos for the new site, and admin level users were invited into discussions on the redesign.

In June 2014, graphic design crowdsourcing company DesignCrowd announced that it had acquired Worth1000 for an undisclosed amount. DesignCrowd announced its intent to port all user accounts and artistic content to DesignCrowd servers, while attempting to keep the user experience unchanged. The company announced the acquisition would help &quot;create a bigger and better marketplace for freelance designers&quot;. The transfer, however, was repeatedly delayed and by the end of 2015 had not been completed. Member frustration was exacerbated by the decision that Worth1000 members not wishing to become DesignCrowd members, would have to “opt out” of the migration, rather than “opt in&quot;.

Worth1000 was no longer available online on February 26, 2016.

<text>Leopold Macaulay (November 25, 1887 – December 24, 1979) was a Canadian politician and lawyer, born in Peterborough, Ontario.

Macaulay was a Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. He was first elected as Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the Toronto area riding of York South in 1926. He was brought into the cabinet as Provincial Secretary and Registrar in September 1930 in the last few weeks of the administration of Ontario Premier George Howard Ferguson.

<doc id="1069318" wikidata="Q202784" url="?curid=1069318" title="The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)">
<text>The Four Horsemen is an American professional wrestling stable that originally consisted of Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Ole Anderson, and Tully Blanchard.

The stable originated in Jim Crockett Promotions as part of Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling and later World Championship Wrestling for much of the 1980s and 1990s. Flair and Arn Anderson were members of each incarnation of the group until Anderson&#x27;s retirement after a neck injury. , Arn Anderson has the ownership of the stable&#x27;s trademark and other intellectual properties.

== History ==
Ric Flair was introduced to the storylines in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling in the 1970s as a cousin of the Minnesota Wrecking Crew (Gene Anderson and Ole Anderson). After leaving the Crew he took on Blackjack Mulligan and Greg Valentine as his partners to feud with them. By 1981, when he became NWA World Heavyweight Champion, he and the Crew had reconciled, having their blessing to team with them as well as with Mulligan and Valentine to feud with top NWA man Harley Race and his Mid-Atlantic hitmen, Bob Orton Jr. and Dick Slater. When Mulligan retired and Valentine jumped to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Flair started looking for a new entourage.

=== Original Four Horsemen (1985–1987) ===
The Four Horsemen formed in 1985 with Ric Flair, Ole and Arn Anderson (the latter brought in from Continental Championship Wrestling), and Tully Blanchard from Southwest Championship Wrestling, with J. J. Dillon as their manager (Dillon was originally serving as manager of Blanchard). They feuded with Dusty Rhodes (breaking his ankle and hand), Magnum T. A., Barry Windham, The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express (breaking Ricky Morton&#x27;s nose), Nikita Koloff (injuring his neck), and The Road Warriors. Animal, Hawk, Ronnie Garvin and many others fought Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Title during that time period. They usually had most of the titles in the NWA, and they often bragged about their success (in the ring and with women) in their interviews.

The Four Horsemen moniker was not planned from the start. The origin of the stable dates to a Jim Crockett Promotions taping which was held in The Omni in Atlanta, Georgia in September 1985. During the event, Ric Flair turned on Dusty Rhodes after Rhodes saved him from a beatdown at the hands of the Koloffs and Krusher Kruschev, with Ole and Arn Anderson then entering the ring and assisting Flair in breaking Dusty Rhodes&#x27; ankle and putting him out of action. During a promo where Rhodes was attempting to surrender his vacated NWA Television Title, Arn, who desired the title, would recruit Tully Blanchard, with the two then kicking Dusty&#x27;s crutches away. Due to time constraints at a television taping, production threw together an impromptu tag team interview of Flair, The Andersons, Tully Blanchard and his manager JJ. Dillon. In his autobiography &quot;To Be The Man&quot;, Flair claimed that it was during this interview that Arn commented: &quot;The only time this much havoc had been wreaked by this few a number of people, you need to go all the way back to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse!&quot; Alternatively, Dillon and Blanchard stated during a Four Horsemen discussion panel, which took place at the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame on July 24, 2016, that the interview where Arn had actually said the phrase, and also debuted the group&#x27;s trademark four finger pose, was after the original four members wrestled in an eight tag team match and that the group&#x27;s formation was centered around the original four members holding championships at the time. The comparison and the name stuck. However, during a pair of television interviews before Starrcade 85, Arn Anderson came out and called them &quot;The Four Horses&quot;. Then Tully did came out right after with Baby Doll and called the group the Four Horsemen, crediting Anderson for the name, though it was not the same one. Arn Anderson has said in an RF Video shoot interview that he, Flair and Blanchard were as close as anybody could be away from the ring while they were together. They lived the gimmick outside of the arena, as they took limos and jets to the cities in which they wrestled. Baby Doll was Flair&#x27;s valet for a couple of months in 1986, after previously managing Tully Blanchard during 1985.

=== Lex Luger and Barry Windham (1987–1989) ===
In February 1987, JCP newcomer Lex Luger, who had come from Florida, was made an associate member of the group after he expressed his desire to become a Horseman. The others started to leave Ole out of things after he cost him and Arn Anderson the NWA Tag Team Titles at Starrcade in 1986. Eventually he was kicked out in favor of Luger that March. The fact that Ole missed a show to watch his son Bryant wrestle in high school was used against Ole in the split as Blanchard and Dillon questioned Ole&#x27;s commitment and Blanchard called Bryant a &quot;snot-nosed kid&quot;.

During this time, they wrestled Rhodes, Nikita Koloff, the Road Warriors and Paul Ellering in a series of WarGames matches. These matches were brutal and ended up with all five members of each team in the cage at the end trying to make somebody submit. During the first match in the Omni, Dillon suffered a separated shoulder from a botched attempt at the Warriors&#x27; finishing move, the Doomsday Device. Dillon landed directly on his right arm and shoulder, and was replaced for the series of matches by the masked War Machine, later known as the Big Boss Man.

Luger was later kicked out of the Four Horsemen. First, he blamed Horseman manager J.J. Dillon for costing him the U.S. Title when Dillon&#x27;s attempt to help Luger win the match, by cheating, backfired. Lex subsequently did not allow Dillon to win a Bunkhouse Stampede match as the Horsemen had agreed to among themselves. In January 1988, he teamed with Barry Windham to feud with the Horsemen. The pair even defeated Anderson and Tully Blanchard for the NWA World Tag Team Championship at Clash of the Champions I. In April 1988, Windham turned on Luger during a title defense against Anderson and Tully Blanchard. Windham then took his spot in the Horsemen. This particular lineup of Horsemen has been called the greatest faction as far as a group of technical wrestlers goes. It was at that time every major title was held by members of the faction: with Flair, as the World Heavyweight Champion; Windham, as the United States Heavyweight Champion; and Arn and Tully, as the World Tag Team Champions.

In September 1988, Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard left to join the WWF. This forced them to drop the Tag Team Titles at the last minute to the Midnight Express (Stan Lane and Bobby Eaton). Anderson and Blanchard were known as &quot;The Brain Busters&quot;, in the WWF, and were managed by Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan.

Flair, Windham, and Dillon continued to refer to themselves as &quot;the Horsemen&quot; and the NWA even flirted with the idea of bringing in new members. Butch Reed was signed to wrestle solo matches with Dillon as his manager. Then, in February 1989, Barry&#x27;s brother Kendall Windham appeared to have joined them and even held up the four fingers after turning on Eddie Gilbert during a tag team match. Early in 1989, Flair and Windham lost a televised tag match to Gilbert and a surprise partner, Flair&#x27;s long-time rival Ricky Steamboat. An enraged and humiliated Flair immediately fired Dillon, who then left to take a front office job with the WWF, while Flair and Windham dropped the Horsemen name. Hiro Matsuda was hired as their new manager. For a short stint in JCP in 1987, Matsuda was managed by Dillon and considered an associate of the Horsemen. As a result of hiring Matsuda as their new manager the Horsemen changed their name to Yamazaki Corporation. Their major feuds were with Lex Luger, Eddie Gilbert, Ricky Steamboat, and Sting. After losing the United States Heavyweight Championship to Luger, Barry Windham left the group due to an injury. Windham suffered a broken hand which occurred in his match against Luger at Chi-Town Rumble and required surgery. This enabled Windham to leave the promotion and show up in the WWF as &quot;The Widowmaker.&quot; Kendall was not used as much more than a jobber and the group seemed like a shell of the unit it looked like on paper when it formed. They added Michael Hayes after Barry&#x27;s injury, who feuded with Luger, but the group disbanded when Hayes reformed The Fabulous Freebirds in May and Matsuda left the promotion.

The Horsemen concept helped define the NWA in the mid to late 1980s. The departure of Anderson and Blanchard was huge at the time, Dillon and Windham&#x27;s departure made it worse, and despite numerous revivals over the coming decade, things were never quite the same.

=== Sting and Sid Vicious (1989–1991) ===
The Horsemen reformed in December 1989 in the NWA/WCW. Flair, Arn and Ole Anderson, and long-standing rival Sting formed the group in a shocker. Tully Blanchard was set to return as well, but failed a drug test while still with the WWF. WCW heard of this, and decided not to rehire him. They were faces and feuded with Gary Hart&#x27;s J-Tex Corporation of Terry Funk, Great Muta, Buzz Sawyer and The Dragonmaster. At the culmination of this feud the group returned to being heels, kicking Sting out for daring to challenge Ric Flair for the World Title. &quot;Sting, you never were a Horseman&quot; Ric Flair would say afterwards in a TV spot, according to Arn Anderson, Sting actually requested to be taken out of the group because he wanted to be on his own. Woman soon became Flair&#x27;s valet. They feuded with Luger, Sting, Rick Steiner, Scott Steiner and El Gigante during this time.

In May 1990, Ole retired from active competition and served as the group&#x27;s manager, Barry Windham returned to WCW and the Horsemen on the May 5th &quot;NWA World Wide Wrestling&quot;, and Sid Vicious was added to fill out the group on the May 11th &quot;NWA Power Hour&quot;. They feuded with the Dudes With Attitudes which consisted of Sting, Luger, the Steiner Brothers, Paul Orndorff and Junkyard Dog. By the end of 1990, Ole and Woman left the NWA.

In October 1990, NWA World Champion Sting defended his title against the Horsemen&#x27;s Sid Vicious at the Halloween Havoc pay-per-view. During the match, Sting and Vicious brawled backstage. A few moments later, they returned to the ring. Sting attempted to slam Sid, but lost his balance and fell to the mat with Sid on top of him. Vicious got the pin and was declared the new World Heavyweight Champion. However, it was revealed that Barry Windham (in matching Sting gear and face paint) had inserted himself into the match and let Vicious pin him. When the real Sting showed up, the match was restarted and the real Sting defeated Sid to retain the title.

The Horsemen line-up of Flair, Anderson, Windham, and Vicious eventually broke up and went their own ways. In May 1991, Sid left for the WWF. Flair was fired from WCW in early July and was in the WWF by August. Windham was part of a double turn at &quot;The Great American Bash&quot; shortly after Flair&#x27;s firing, where he lost to Lex Luger in a match for the vacant WCW world championship (Windham became a face, Luger a heel). Anderson went on to form a tag team with Larry Zbyszko called The Enforcers and later became part of the Paul E. Dangerously-led Dangerous Alliance with Zbyszko, Rick Rude, Madusa, Bobby Eaton, and Steve Austin. Anderson and Windham feuded during this time, beginning with an incident at Halloween Havoc where Arn and Zbyszko slammed a car door on Windham&#x27;s hand.

=== Three Horsemen (May 1993 – December 1993) ===
The next incarnation of the Horsemen, containing only three active members, was around for fewer than seven months in 1993. Flair returned from the WWF to WCW to rejoin Arn and they promised a Horsemen reunion at the Slamboree pay-per-view. Paul Roma became the third horseman after Tully Blanchard and WCW could not come to terms on a deal for him to return. Ole Anderson was on hand as the adviser but made only one appearance on &quot;A Flair for the Gold&quot;. This group of Horsemen is considered by many wrestling fans to be the weakest incarnation of the group. They were faces again and feuded with Barry Windham and the Hollywood Blondes (Steve Austin and Brian Pillman). This group ended, due to Arn Anderson&#x27;s stabbing incident with Sid Vicious during a tour of England in October, and Paul Roma turning on Erik Watts during a tag team match to join Paul Orndorff as the tag team of Pretty Wonderful. Flair went on to feud with WCW World Heavyweight Champion Big Van Vader.

=== Reformation and feud with the nWo (1995–1997) ===
In 1995, Flair and Arn (back to being heels) were teaming with Flair&#x27;s former foe Vader to torment Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage. After Vader lost to Hogan in a steel cage match at Bash at the Beach, Flair entered the cage and lambasted him. Vader snapped and attacked Flair, and Arn came to his rescue. This led to a handicap match at &quot;Clash of the Champions XXXI&quot; in which Vader defeated the team of Flair and Arn. Flair and Arn began to bicker, as Flair blamed Arn for the loss and Arn always felt he was doing Flair&#x27;s dirty work; a feud developed that led to a match at Fall Brawl on September 17, 1995, in Asheville, North Carolina. Arn defeated Flair with the help of Brian Pillman. Flair begged Sting to help him against them and though Sting did not trust Flair he eventually agreed. Flair ended up turning on him at Halloween Havoc to reform the Horsemen with Arn and Pillman. They added Chris Benoit to complete the group. This version of the Horsemen feuded with Hogan, Savage, Sting, and Lex Luger. Flair eventually brought back Woman and Miss Elizabeth joined the group at Superbrawl VI when she turned on Randy Savage. Miss Elizabeth left the group in October 1996 to join the nWo and Woman left the group and WCW in July 1997.

In early 1996, Pillman started his infamous &quot;Loose Cannon&quot; storyline and started a feud with Kevin Sullivan, the leader of the Dungeon of Doom. Pillman ended up leaving WCW, going to ECW, and eventually the WWF in February. Leading towards Uncensored the Horsemen briefly joined forces with the Dungeon of Doom as the Alliance to End Hulkamania to battle mutual rivals Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage. The two stables were unable to coexist and lost the Tower of Doom Steel Cage. The Horsemen then engaged in a brief feud with the Dungeon of Doom, including a feud between Sullivan and Benoit, which became one of the most talked about feuds of all time. In this feud, Woman, who was really married to Sullivan, left him for Benoit. However, life imitated art, and Woman &quot;actually&quot; left Sullivan for Benoit. This feud got heated and some of the matches were shoot-style with the performers using stiff or even full contact moves, rather than the typical North American style of softening maneuvers.

In June 1996 at the Great American Bash, Flair and Arn Anderson wrestled former football players Steve &quot;Mongo&quot; McMichael and Kevin Greene. During the match, McMichael&#x27;s then-wife Debra was chased to the back by Woman and Miss Elizabeth, but later came back with them and a steel briefcase, which she handed to her husband. Mongo opened it to reveal a Horsemen T-shirt and money; after thinking it over, he closed the Haliburton briefcase and hit Greene with it, allowing Flair to score the pin on Greene. McMichael was officially inducted as the fourth Horseman, and in the process gave the group another ringside valet in Debra. The rumors said that Debra and Woman did not get along behind the scenes. This played out on TV, as they constantly bickered, and Benoit and Mongo had to step in.

When the New World Order (nWo) was founded the next month, the Horsemen became babyfaces along with the rest of the WCW roster. In September, Flair and Anderson teamed with their bitter rivals, Sting and Lex Luger, to lose to the nWo (Hogan, Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, and an impostor Sting) in the WarGames match at Fall Brawl when Luger submitted to the impostor Sting&#x27;s Scorpion Deathlock. This angered Anderson, and he feuded with Luger for the next month. In October, two developments occurred that affected the group. First, Jeff Jarrett came over to WCW from the WWF, and expressed his desire to join the Horsemen. He immediately gained a fan in Ric Flair, much to the chagrin of the other Horsemen. The next week, Miss Elizabeth joined the nWo.

Flair finally let Jarrett join the group in February 1997 but the others did not want him. Jarrett began bickering with Mongo over Debra&#x27;s attention, and in June won the U.S. Title from Dean Malenko, with the help of Eddie Guerrero; on the June 30, 1997 edition of Nitro he was kicked out of the stable by Flair, due to the instability Jarrett&#x27;s presence caused the Horsemen. In a move uncharacteristic of the Horsemen, however, Jarrett was allowed to literally walk away, instead of receiving a beatdown as was expected. He eventually took Debra from Mongo, but Mongo took Jarrett&#x27;s U.S. Title. To this date, amongst fans and members of the Four Horsemen, there is still debate whether to include Jarrett as a Horseman. In his biography, Arn Anderson states that &quot;Jeff Jarrett was never a Horseman&quot;. His &quot;membership&quot; and his easy departure leave the situation ambiguous. The Four Horsemen usually picked their own members, but at the time, WCW held extreme control over storylines and this may have forced them to accept a member for those purposes only and not by choice.

In August 1997, Arn Anderson retired due to a neck/back injury that did not allow him to wrestle. Curt Hennig took his spot as &quot;The Enforcer&quot;. The next month, Hennig turned on the Horsemen and joined the nWo. Flair disbanded the group on September 29, 1997, and they went their separate ways.

=== Final incarnation (1998–1999) ===
The last incarnation came in September 1998. On the September 14 edition of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; in Greenville, South Carolina when Ric Flair returned from a hiatus from the ring after a disagreement with WCW president Eric Bischoff. Dean Malenko and Chris Benoit kept going to Arn about reforming the Horsemen. He kept saying no. James J. Dillon, back in WCW&#x27;s front office, even made a request. Arn eventually gave in and reformed the Horsemen with McMichael, Benoit and Malenko being presented to the ring before Flair finally being unveiled as the fourth Horseman, with Arn serving as its manager. They feuded with the nWo and Eric Bischoff.

In early 1999, the Horsemen turned heel again. Mongo had recently departed the wrestling world and they were down to Benoit, Malenko, Flair and Arn as the manager. They also had a referee biased to them, Charles Robinson, whom members of the Horsemen even referred to as &quot;Little Nature Boy&quot; (due to his resemblance to Flair). Flair&#x27;s personal nurse, Double D (aka Asya), acted as an enforcer for the group and Ric Flair&#x27;s son David Flair, who wrestled with them and wore Horsemen shirts though never an official member. Ric Flair, the (onscreen) President of WCW at this time, had awarded him with the U.S. Title and had the Horsemen help David to keep it. Eventually, Benoit and Malenko left him in May in protest over Flair&#x27;s selfishness, and joined Shane Douglas and Perry Saturn to form the Revolution, thereby effectively ending the Four Horsemen.

=== Reunions (2022–present) ===

At Starrcast 2022, The Four Horsemen reunited. That July, Arn Anderson secured the copyrights to The Four Horsemen name and images. A tag team consisting of his son Brock Anderson and Brian Pillman Jr., son of late Horseman Brian Pillman, &quot;representing The Four Horsemen&quot; was announced to wrestle at the Jim Crockett Promotions event &quot;Ric Flair&#x27;s Last Match&quot; with Arn Anderson managing, signaling a possible full-time return of the faction.

== Legacy ==
The original Four Horsemen, widely regarded as the greatest pro wrestling stable of all time, were innovative in developing and popularizing the concept of heel stables. On the 2007 &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; DVD, commentator Jim Ross stated &quot;without the Horsemen there would damn sure be no nWo or no DX&quot;.

=== Evolution ===

In 2003, rumors began circulating that Ric Flair (at the time working for the World Wrestling Entertainment) was going to reform the Four Horsemen with Triple H, Randy Orton, and Batista. This group was eventually formed, but under the name Evolution instead of the Four Horsemen, and with Triple H as the leader instead of Flair. They served much the same function as the original heel Horsemen had, dominating the titles on &quot;Raw&quot; and feuding with that brand&#x27;s top faces. The group slowly died between August 2004 and October 2005. Orton was kicked out of the group after he won the World Heavyweight Championship, which Triple H coveted. In February 2005, Batista left the group after winning the Royal Rumble, in a storyline where Triple H tried to protect his title from Batista. During a Triple H hiatus, Flair turned face, and at &quot;Raw Homecoming&quot;, Triple H returned as a face, but turned heel by the end of the night, hitting Flair in the face with a sledgehammer and officially ending Evolution. At &quot;Raw 15th Anniversary&quot;, an Evolution reunion as faces took place, though then-heel Randy Orton refused to participate and instead challenged the face versions of Flair, Batista, and Triple H to a match in which he partnered with then-heel, Edge and Umaga, and at the same time reforming Rated-RKO for one night. On the March 31, 2008 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Flair delivered his farewell address. Afterward, Triple H brought out many current and retired superstars to thank Flair for all he has done, including Four Horsemen members, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard, Barry Windham, J. J. Dillon, and Dean Malenko. Also, it was the night in which Evolution got back together in the ring, except for Randy Orton (who was outside the ring). This would mark the last time both groups would be in the ring together.

On the April 14, 2014 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Triple H, Orton, and Batista reunited Evolution full-time, once again heels, to feud with The Shield. However, on the April 28, 2014 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Flair showed his endorsement for The Shield, effectively turning his back on his old teammates, thus not turning heel.

=== The Xtreme Horsemen ===
The Xtreme Horsemen was a professional wrestling stable in Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling, and later Major League Wrestling, who disbanded in 2004. The group&#x27;s name was in homage to the Four Horsemen, who in the 1980s were one of professional wrestling&#x27;s top draws worldwide. The group came together in Dusty Rhodes&#x27; Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling promotion, but the group later left Rhodes&#x27; promotion to join Major League Wrestling where Steve Corino and &quot;The Enforcer&quot; C.W. Anderson were joined by former ECW superstars Justin Credible and Simon Diamond. This incarnation was briefly managed by former Four Horsemen manager J. J. Dillon before Major League Wrestling ceased operations. Barry Windham also joined the group for a single War Games match. Corino has used the group name several other times with various teammates in other promotions.

=== Fortune ===

Fortune (originally spelled ) was a professional wrestling stable in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, started by Ric Flair on June 17, 2010, as a &quot;reformed&quot; version of the Four Horsemen. Flair had been loosely associated with A.J. Styles, Desmond Wolfe, Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) and Kazarian since April 5, 2010. Flair stated that whoever wanted to join Fortune would have to earn their place in the stable. On July 11 at Victory Road, Styles and Kazarian became the first official members of Fortune by defeating Samoa Joe and Rob Terry in a tag team match. On the July 29 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Flair made James Storm and Robert Roode the final two members of Fortune. However, on the August 12 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; Douglas Williams, who had helped Flair defeat his nemesis Jay Lethal the previous week, and Matt Morgan were added to Fortune as the stable assaulted EV 2.0, a stable consisting of former Extreme Championship Wrestling performers. Fortune later merged with Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff&#x27;s Immortal stable, but turned on them months later, splitting them into two feuding factions. Ric Flair would turn on Fortune and remain associated with Immortal.

=== The Four Horsewomen ===
The stable was invoked by mixed martial artists Ronda Rousey, Shayna Baszler, Jessamyn Duke, and Marina Shafir (Invicta Fighter), who named themselves &quot;The Four Horsewomen&quot; in 2013, with the blessing of Anderson and Flair. After Bethe Correia defeated Duke, she held up four fingers and symbolically put one down. She did this again after beating Baszler. As Shafir is not in the UFC, these two wins set the stage for a bantamweight title fight between her and Rousey at UFC 190. Rousey knocked Correia out in 34 seconds.

The group was shown at ringside during WrestleMania 31, where Rousey was later involved in an in-ring segment with The Rock, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon. Baszler and Rousey first signed with WWE, where the former quickly became the NXT Women&#x27;s champion, and the latter had a high-profile debut match at Wrestlemania 34 before pursuing and winning the WWE Raw Women&#x27;s Championship. Shafir eventually joined the WWE Performance Center, completing the foursome&#x27;s transition to professional wrestling.

The WWE female wrestlers Charlotte Flair (Ric Flair&#x27;s daughter), Sasha Banks, Bayley and Becky Lynch have referred to themselves as &quot;The Four Horsewomen&quot; (originally &quot;The Four Horsewomen of NXT&quot; when the four had only been a part of that brand), and posed in ring at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn, following a match between Bayley and Banks, each with four fingers held up. The WWE&#x27;s Four Horsewomen were partly responsible for changing the WWE&#x27;s Women Division from sex appeal to true athleticism. Banks and Bayley would later form a tag team known as the Boss &#x27;n&#x27; Hug Connection.

Both Four Horsewomen groups were at the Mae Young Classic tapings on July 14, 2017, where Baszler defeated Zeda, Mia Yim, Candice LeRae and Mercedes Martinez to advance into the finals, losing to Kairi Sane.

All four of the Four Horsewomen of UFC would reappear on WWE Evolution where Duke and Shafir interfered on Baszler&#x27;s behalf to win the NXT Women&#x27;s Championship from Kairi Sane and Rousey defended her WWE Raw Women&#x27;s Championship against Nikki Bella. All four of the WWE Four Horsewomen would be involved at the event as well: Charlotte Flair and Becky Lynch competed in a Last Woman Standing Match while Sasha Banks and Bayley teamed with Natalya to take on The Riott Squad.

The WWE Four Horsewomen would compete against each other with Banks and Bayley (as heels) taking on Lynch and Flair in a tag team match on the September 9, 2019 edition of &quot;Raw&quot; from the Madison Square Garden, in which the latter team emerged victorious.

<doc id="1069323" wikidata="Q6520240" url="?curid=1069323" title="Leisler's Rebellion">
<text>Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion was an uprising in late-17th century colonial New York in which German American merchant and militia captain Jacob Leisler seized control of the southern portion of the colony and ruled it from 1689 to 1691. The uprising took place in the aftermath of England&#x27;s Glorious Revolution and the 1689 Boston revolt in the Dominion of New England, which had included New York. The rebellion reflected colonial resentment against the policies of the deposed King James II.

Royal authority was not restored until 1691, when English troops and a new governor were sent to New York. Leisler was arrested by these forces, who tried and convicted him of treason. He was executed, with the revolt leaving the colony polarized, bitterly split into two rival factions, pro-Leislerites, who regarded him as a martyr, and who aligned generally with the British Whig party, and antis, who aligned generally with the British Tories.

==Background==

English forces took control of New Netherland in 1664 and King Charles II gave the territory as proprietor to his brother James, then Duke of York, to rule as he pleased. James partitioned East and West Jersey to other proprietors and established an essentially autocratic government with a strong governor and council but no elected legislature.
James succeeded his brother to the throne in 1685 and in 1686 established the Dominion of New England, centralizing the administration of previously separate colonies. In May 1688, he added New York and the Jerseys to the dominion. Its governor Sir Edmund Andros came to New York that summer to establish his authority and install Francis Nicholson, a captain in the English Army, to administer those colonies as his lieutenant governor.

Nicholson was assisted by a local council but no legislative assembly. He was seen by many New Yorkers as the next in a line of royal governors who &quot;had in a most arbitrary way subverted our ancient privileges&quot;. Nicholson justified his actions by stating that the colonists were &quot;a conquered people, and therefore ... could not so much [as] claim rights and priviledges as Englishmen&quot;.

In late 1688, the Glorious Revolution deposed the Catholic James and replaced him with the Protestant William III and Mary II. The rule of Andros was highly unpopular, especially in New England, and his opponents in Massachusetts used the change of royal power for their political benefit by organizing an uprising.

On April 18, 1689, a mob formed in Boston led by former Massachusetts political figures, and they arrested Andros and other dominion officials. This led to a cascade of events in which Massachusetts and the other New England colonies rapidly restored their pre-dominion governments.

==Rising tensions==
Lieutenant Governor Nicholson learned of the uprising in Boston by April 26. He took no steps to announce news of it or of the political upheaval in England for fear of raising prospects of rebellion in New York. Politicians and militia leaders became more assertive on Long Island when they learned of Boston, and dominion officials were ousted from a number of communities by mid-May.

At the same time, Nicholson learned that France had declared war on England, bringing the threat of Franco-Indian attacks on New York&#x27;s northern frontier. He was also short of troops, since most of the New York garrison had been sent by Andros to deal with Indian activity in Maine. He found that his regulars had also been swayed by populists into believing that he was attempting to impose Catholic rule on New York. He attempted to mollify panicked citizenry over rumored Indian raids by inviting the militia to join the army garrison at Fort James on Manhattan island.

New York&#x27;s defenses were in poor condition, and Nicholson&#x27;s council voted to impose import duties to improve them. This action was met with immediate resistance, with a number of merchants refusing to pay the duty. One in particular was Jacob Leisler, a German-born Calvinist merchant and militia captain. Leisler was a vocal opponent of the dominion regime, which he saw as an attempt to impose popery on the province, and he may have played a role in subverting Nicholson&#x27;s regulars.

On May 22, Nicholson&#x27;s council was petitioned by the militia, who sought more rapid improvement to the city&#x27;s defenses and also wanted access to the powder magazine in the fort. This latter request was denied, heightening concerns that the city had inadequate powder supplies. This concern was further exacerbated when city leaders began hunting through the city for additional supplies.

==Rebellion==
Nicholson made an intemperate remark to a militia officer on May 30, 1689, and the incident flared into open rebellion. Nicholson was well known for his temper, and he told the officer, &quot;I rather would see the Towne on fire than to be commanded by you&quot;. Rumors flew around the town that Nicholson was prepared to burn it down. He summoned the officer and demanded that he surrender his commission. Abraham de Peyster was the officer&#x27;s commander and one of the wealthiest men in the city, and he engaged in a heated argument with Nicholson, after which de Peyster and his brother Johannis, also a militia captain, stormed out of the council chamber.

The militia was called out and descended en masse to Fort James, which they occupied. An officer was sent to the council to demand the keys to the powder magazine, which Nicholson eventually surrendered to &quot;hinder and prevent bloodshed and further mischiefe&quot;. The following day, a council of militia officers called on Jacob Leisler to take command of the city militia. He did so, and the rebels issued a declaration that they would hold the fort on behalf of the new monarchs until they sent a properly accredited governor.

Leisler&#x27;s exact role in the militia uprising is unknown, but a number of observations point to his involvement. He and militia captain Charles Lodewick presented the petition on May 22. Jost Stoll, one of his officers, led the militia to the gates of Fort James, and another of his officers delivered the demand for the keys to the powder magazine. However, none of the depositions which Nicholson collected prior to his departure directly implicates Leisler as a ringleader.

===Leisler takes control===

At this point, the militia controlled the fort which gave them control over the harbor. When ships arrived in the harbor, they brought passengers and captains directly to the fort, cutting off outside communications to Nicholson and his council. On June 6, Nicholson decided to leave for England and began gathering depositions for use in proceedings there. He left the city on June 10 for the Jersey shore where he hoped to join Thomas Dongan, who was expected to sail for England soon thereafter.

Leisler&#x27;s control of the province was limited at first. His councilors were Dutch patroons Nicholas Bayard, Stephanus van Cortlandt, and Frederick Philipse, and they were still in the city. They did not recognize his authority, nor did the city&#x27;s civil administration, with van Cortlandt as mayor. A proclamation was made in Hartford, Connecticut, concerning William and Mary, and both sides of the controversy in New York raced to meet the messenger bringing copies of the proclamation. Leisler&#x27;s agents won the race, and Leisler published the proclamation on June 22. Two days later, van Cortlandt received a copy of the official notice that William and Mary had prepared for Andros. The transmission of this document had been delayed at the behest of Massachusetts agents in London.

It specifically retained all non-Catholic officeholders until further notice, and technically legitimized the rule of the council in Nicholson&#x27;s absence. In accordance with this document, van Cortlandt fired the customs collector, who was Catholic, and replaced him with Bayard and others to oversee customs activities. Leisler objected to this assertion of power and descended on the customs house with a troop of militia. Accounts left by both sides of the dispute state that there was a near riot, and Bayard claimed to barely escape being killed by a mob. Bayard then fled to Albany, followed by van Cortlandt a few days later. Philipse withdrew from political life, leaving Leisler in effective control of the city.

On June 26, a convention composed of delegates from a number of communities from lower New York and East Jersey established a committee of safety to oversee affairs. This committee essentially became the nucleus of Leisler&#x27;s later government. They chose Leisler to be the province&#x27;s commander-in-chief &quot;till orders shall come from their Majesties.&quot;

Through July and August, his hand-picked militia exercised &quot;de facto&quot; control over the city, financed by provincial funds which Nicholson had deposited in the fort. He was assisted by sympathetic officials from Connecticut who sent a troop of militia to assist in holding the fort. Nicholson&#x27;s company of regulars was formally disbanded on August 1, about the same time that formal word arrived that France and England were at war.

Leisler dispatched Jost Stoll and Matthew Clarkson to England on August 15 to bolster his position with the government in London. They carried documents intended to support accusations that Nicholson had been conspiring against the people of New York and to justify the propriety of Leisler&#x27;s actions against his &quot;oppressive&quot; rule. The agents were instructed to request a new charter for the province and to claim that the united colonies could defeat New France without assistance from the home country. He made no specific requests that the new charter include any sort of democratic representation.

An election ordered Leisler&#x27;s committee of safety formally to turn van Cortlandt out of office in October, consolidating Leisler&#x27;s command over New York except the Albany area. According to Bayard, the turnout in New York City was extremely low, with barely 100 voters participating. Councilors Bayard and Philipse issued a proclamation on October 20 calling Leisler&#x27;s rule illegal, and ordered other militia commanders to stop supporting him. The proclamation had no effect.

===Resistance in Albany===
Leisler&#x27;s opponents had assumed control of Albany and the immediate area. On July 1, they formally proclaimed William and Mary and, on August 1, established a convention to rule. The convention included local militia leaders and the city fathers of Albany, wealthy landowners from the Hudson River valley, and it became the nucleus of anti-Leisler activities in the province. The convention categorically refused to recognize Leisler&#x27;s rule unless he presented a commission from William and Mary.

Albany&#x27;s situation became tense in September when local Indians brought rumors of an imminent attack from French Canada. Leisler was interdicting movement of military supplies up the Hudson, so Albany officials ended up making an appeal to him. He responded by sending Jacob Milborne, a close advisor and future son-in-law, with a militia troop to take military control of Albany in November.

However, the convention objected to the terms that Milborne demanded in exchange for his support, and he was refused entry to the city and Fort Frederick. He was warned by an Iroquois woman that a large body of Indians near Albany saw him as a threat to their friends in Albany and would react if he attempted to assert military control over the area. Milborne returned to New York City. The convention also appealed to the neighboring colonies for military assistance, which Connecticut answered by sending 80 militiamen to Albany in late November.

Leisler finally gained control over Albany early in 1690. He called for elections at Schenectady in January 1690, in a move calculated to divide neighboring communities. In early February, during King William&#x27;s War, Schenectady was attacked by French and Indian raiders, exposing the weakness of the Albany Convention&#x27;s position. Each side blamed the other for the failure to defend Schenectady, but Leisler was able to capitalize on the situation. He convinced Connecticut to withdraw its militia and sent his own militia north to take control of the area. The convention capitulated, lacking any significant outside support.

===Leisler&#x27;s rule===
A letter arrived in December 1689 from William and Mary addressed to Nicholson or &quot;in his absence to such as for the time being take care for preserving the peace and administering the laws in our said Province of New York&quot;. The recipient was instructed to &quot;take upon you the government of the said province&quot;. The messenger apparently sought to deliver the message to van Cortlandt and Philipse, but Leisler&#x27;s militia had him seized. Leisler used this document to claim legitimacy for his governance, began styling himself &quot;lieutenant governor&quot;, and established a governor&#x27;s council to replace the committee of safety.

Leisler then began attempting to collect taxes and customs duties. He was in part successful, although he met with significant resistance from officials opposed to his rule. Some were arrested, and most of those who refused to act on his instructions were replaced. By April 1690, virtually every community in New York had officials appointed by Leisler in some of its posts. These appointed officials represented a cross-section of New York society and included prominent Dutch and English residents.

However, resistance continued to his policies, and he was attacked by a small mob on June 6 who demanded the release of political prisoners and refused to pay taxes which he had imposed. In October 1690, diverse communities protested his rule, from Dutch Harlem to Protestant English Queens County to Albany.

Leisler&#x27;s principal activity in 1690 was the organization of an expedition against New France. This idea first began to take shape in a meeting in May with representatives from the neighboring colonies. To provide for New York&#x27;s troops, he ordered merchants to offer up their goods and broke into their storehouses if they did not. He kept a fairly careful account of these activities, and many merchants were later repaid. Connecticut officials were unwilling to grant command to Jacob Milborne, Leisler&#x27;s choice of commander, citing the experience of their own commanders. Leisler acquiesced to their choice of Fitz-John Winthrop.

The expedition was a complete failure, dissolving amidst disease and difficulties in transport and supply. However, Winthrop did avenge the Schenectady massacre of February 1690, to some extent, by sending a small party north to raid La Prairie, Quebec. Leisler blamed Winthrop for the failure (for which there were numerous causes) and briefly arrested him, eliciting protests from Connecticut Governor Robert Treat.

===Royal response===
King William III commissioned Colonel Henry Sloughter to be provincial governor in late 1690, but a variety of issues delayed Sloughter&#x27;s departure from England. His ship was then further delayed by bad weather, and the ship carrying his lieutenant governor Major Richard Ingoldesby was first to arrive in January 1691. Ingoldesby lacked official documents (which were on Sloughter&#x27;s ship), but he insisted that Leisler surrender the government and Fort James to him.

There was minor skirmishing during six weeks of stubborn resistance on the part of Leisler and stubborn imperious behavior on the part of Ingoldesby, and the city was split into armed camps with several hundred Leisler supporters occupying the fort. Ingoldesby was supported in his efforts by members of the old dominion council. By mid-March, Ingoldesby had surrounded the fort and was threatening to take it by storm. Leisler occasionally had the fort&#x27;s guns fired at suspicious movements, but these only succeeded in killing a few colonists.

Sloughter arrived in New York amid this tension and proclaimed his commission on March 19, demanding that Leisler surrender the fort. Leisler was not certain that Sloughter was in fact the person appointed, but Jost Stoll had been to London and was able to convince him that Sloughter was legitimate. Leisler then sent emissaries out to negotiate with Sloughter, but he stated that he did not negotiate with his subjects and had them arrested. Leisler repeatedly rebuffed Sloughter&#x27;s demands, but he was eventually convinced to surrender, probably by his now-restive garrison. Sloughter had Leisler and ten others arrested on charges of treason and imprisoned in the fort which they had just been occupying.

==Execution==
Sloughter established a special Court of Oyer and Terminer to hear the trials of Leisler and other defendants. Some individuals were not charged, including Abraham De Peyster and Charles Lodewick, the apparent ringleaders of the initial militia action. The panel of judges included a significant number of anti-Leislerians, including Richard Ingoldesby, and was presided over by former dominion official Joseph Dudley. Leisler was arraigned by this court on March 31.

The main charge against him concerned the militant resistance to Ingoldesby&#x27;s attempts to take control. Leisler and his son-in-law Jacob Milborne both refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the court, and did not enter pleas. Leisler asked for and was granted counsel, even though English law did not mandate it. Most of the other defendants acknowledged the court&#x27;s legitimacy and pleaded not guilty. On April 1, Leisler was arraigned on a count of murder over an incident that had taken place during his rule.

On April 9, Sloughter convened a new colonial assembly. It passed a bill on April 17 condemning Leisler&#x27;s government and activities, despite attempts by pro-Leislerians to control the body, and even blamed him for the 1690 Schenectady massacre. Leisler and Milborne were convicted on April 17, after repeated attempts by the court to get them to enter pleas, and they were sentenced to be &quot;hanged, drawn and quartered, and their estates confiscated.&quot; No execution was scheduled.

There matters stood until mid-May. By early May, the court had heard 32 cases, convicted and sentenced eight men to death (including Leisler and Milborne), and either acquitted or pardoned the rest. Partisan forces, however, continued to be active. Anti-Leisler forces agitated for his execution, and there were riots on Staten Island in late April, supposedly instigated by Leisler supporters.

Sloughter, however, believed that the executions should be stayed until the king&#x27;s will could be known. On May 7, he sent reports to the king and the Lords of Trade describing the situation and including the trial transcripts. The letter to the king painted Leisler in an extremely negative light, and neither report mentioned the death sentence.

On May 14, the court refused to transport Leisler and Milborne to England for appeal, and Sloughter&#x27;s council was dominated by anti-Leislerians who urged him to execute the two men. He acquiesced and signed the death warrants that evening. Nicholas Bayard and others claim that Sloughter was drunk at the time (or at least strongly under the influence of alcohol), and accusations circulated afterward that he had been bribed. On May 16, Leisler and Milborne were executed by hanging.

Leisler is reported to have made a long speech, claiming that he acted &quot;for the glory of the Protestant interest, the establishment of the present government&quot;, and to protect the province from outside forces. The remains of the two men were buried beneath the gallows, and their estates were seized by attainder. On May 19, Governor Sloughter issued a proclamation of amnesty for all except about 20 named individuals.

==Aftermath==
The execution made martyrs of Leisler and Milborne and did nothing to lessen the deep divisions between pro- and anti-Leislerian factions. His supporters sent agents to London, eventually joined by his son Jacob, to petition the government for redress. In January 1692, their petition was heard by the King, and the Lords of Trade recommended pardons for the convicted in April. On , Queen Mary instructed incoming governor Benjamin Fletcher to pardon the six remaining prisoners.

Governor Sloughter&#x27;s sudden death on July 23, 1691, was viewed in some circles with suspicion that he had been poisoned, although the autopsy indicated that the cause was pneumonia. He left behind a letter in which he claimed to have been &quot;constrained&quot; by the forces around him to order the execution. Other acts during his tenure also sparked comment. Ingoldesby took the reins of government after his death and accused him of pocketing £1,100 intended to pay the troops, and he was said to have seized a prize ship that had been captured and sold at auction during his time in office, and then sold it a second time.

One of Leisler&#x27;s supporters had stopped in Boston while en route to England and was offered support by Sir William Phips, the new governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Massachusetts agents in London then worked on behalf of Leisler&#x27;s heirs to have the attainder reversed and the family properties restored. A bill was introduced into Parliament to do so in 1695, with the assistance of Massachusetts supporters Sir Henry Ashurts and Sir Constantine Henry Phipps. The bill quickly passed in the House of Lords, although anti-Leislerian agents succeeded in having it sent to committee in the lower chamber. It was finally passed on , after extensive hearings in which Joseph Dudley defended his actions by accusing Leisler of improperly seizing power because he was a foreigner. It received the royal assent the next day.

However, it was not until 1698 that Leisler&#x27;s heirs finally received their due. The Earl of Bellomont arrived that year, commissioned as New York&#x27;s governor in 1695 and an outspoken supporter of Leisler in the parliamentary debate. He died in office in 1701, but during his tenure he placed pro-Leislerians in key positions in his government. He oversaw the restoration of the family estate, and had the bodies of Leisler and Milborne properly reburied in the yard of the Dutch Reform Church.

Pro- and anti-Leisler factions remained in contention at the provincial level until the arrival of Governor Robert Hunter in 1710. Over time, the Leislerians tended to associate with the English Whig faction, and the anti-Leislerians with the English Tories. Hunter was a Whig who generally favored the Leislerians, but he was able to calm the bitterness that existed between the factions.

==Significance==

Some historians, including the American historian K. Waterman, see the rebellion primarily as a Dutch revolt against English authority. However, Leisler failed to win the backing of the Dutch Reformed Church. Leisler, the son of a German Reformed minister, exploited popular anti-Catholic sentiment and was primarily supported by artisans and small traders who opposed the dominion of wealthy merchants such as the patroons.

Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion follows a pattern, however, with other rebellions in the same period: Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion in 1676, the 1689 Boston revolt that deposed Andros, 1683&#x27;s failed Gove&#x27;s Rebellion in New Hampshire, Culpeper&#x27;s Rebellion in North Carolina in 1677, and the Protestant Rebellion against the Catholic-dominated government in Maryland in 1689.

<text>Fossil Mountain is a mountain located south of Skoki Mountain in Banff National Park, Canada. The mountain was named in 1906 by M.P. Bridgland, of the first ascent party, after the numerous fossils that can be found on its slopes.

Fossil Mountain is the site of the first known skiing fatality in the Canadian Rockies. On April 7, 1933, Raymond Paley died in a slab avalanche when he attempted to ski down the mountain after skiing almost to the top.

In February 1988, cousins Dan and Wayne Hugo (29 and 27 respectively) were hiking and skiing on Fossil Mountain when an avalanche, which they may have triggered, occurred. They both died.

== Routes ==
The scrambling route ascends easy scree slopes from Deception Pass. Due to these easy slopes, the mountain is sometimes ascended in winter by skiers.

<text>Spirodela is a genus of aquatic plants, one of several genera containing plants commonly called duckweed. &quot;Spirodela&quot; species are members of the Araceae under the APG II system. They were formerly members of the Lemnaceae.

== Description ==
&quot;Spirodela&quot; species are free-floating plants that have their stem transformed into leaf-like structures called fronds; each plant is represented by a frond with roots, therefore they do not have leaves. Two to five plants may remain connected to each other. 

Plants are green, but may turn red due to the presence of anthocyanin. Multiple roots (5 to 20, depending on the species) emerge from each frond. &quot;Spirodela&quot; is larger () than &quot;Lemna&quot; ( – , with one root per frond).

Certain species of &quot;Spirodela&quot; overwinter as turions, dormant starchy shoots that lack air pockets, which sink to the bottom of the water. In spring, turions rise to the surface and germinate.

&quot;Spirodela&quot; often forms floating mats with related species (e.g. &quot;Lemna&quot; and &quot;Wolffia)&quot;.

The genus is virtually cosmopolitan in distribution.

==Species==
There are currently 2 recognized species in this genus: 
#&quot;Spirodela polyrhiza&quot; - cosmopolitan
#&quot;Spirodela intermedia&quot; W.Koch

<doc id="1069328" wikidata="Q5582841" url="?curid=1069328" title="Good News Week">
<text>Good News Week is an Australian satirical panel game show hosted by Paul McDermott that aired from 19 April 1996 to 27 May 2000, and 11 February 2008 to 28 April 2012. The show&#x27;s initial run aired on ABC until being bought by Network Ten in 1999. The show was revived for its second run when the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike caused many of Network Ten&#x27;s imported US programs to cease production.

&quot;Good News Week&quot; drew its comedy and satire from recent news stories, political figures, media organisations, and often, aspects of the show itself. The show opened with a monologue by McDermott relating to recent headlines, after which two teams of three panellists competed in recurring segments to gain points.

The show has spawned three short-lived spin-off series, the ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good News Weekend&quot; (1998), Ten&#x27;s &quot;GNW Night Lite&quot; (1999) and Ten&#x27;s skit-based &quot;Good News World&quot; (2011).

== Format ==
&quot;Good News Week&quot;&#x27;s format is based on that of the British program &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot;, although host Paul McDermott says that the idea behind the show, &quot;of looking at the news in a satirical way, the week&#x27;s events, &#x27;this is the week that was&#x27;, goes back to early radio programs.&quot; Executive producer Ted Robinson has said that the show&#x27;s humour is usually less genteel than &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot; as the British series is aimed at an older, over-fifty audience whereas &quot;Good News Week&quot; is most popular among the 18 to 39 age group. &quot;We are at the rabid mongrel end of the market,&quot; he says.

===Monologue===
McDermott opens each show with a scripted monologue in which he dissects newsworthy events in a humorous manner. He concludes by declaring, &quot;and that&#x27;s the good news!&quot; and throwing his newspaper clippings in the air, after which an air cannon expels more newspaper clippings all over the stage. The episode&#x27;s six panellists, divided into two teams, are then introduced. Teams are captained by the two regular panellists, radio comedian Mikey Robins and stand-up comedian Claire Hooper, who replaced stand-up comedian Julie McCrossin in the second run. The four guest panellists consist of a combination of comedians, media personalities and occasionally politicians.

===Recurring segments===

The monologue is followed by a number of recurring segments. Over a series of rounds, the competing teams attempt to score points by participating in games relating to the news of the week. However, McDermott often allocates additional points such as for flattery, particularly witty comments, creative incorrect answers or to orchestrate the defeat of Robins&#x27; team. Similarly, he may confiscate them such as for heckling, misbehaviour or poor, &quot;dad joke&quot; type humour. Each segment is concluded with a short monologue by McDermott about the news story of game, and the whole show concluded by a monologue discussing &quot;the good news for the week ahead&quot;. Other than McDermott&#x27;s monologues, the show is entirely unscripted although some parts of the show require rehearsal when using certain types of props. Each episode usually features four to six different games in addition to the regular segment &quot;Strange But True&quot;.

==History==

===Initial run (1996–2000)===

The series premiered on the ABC on 12 April 1996, with an initial order of 50 episodes. The ABC was initially apprehensive about executive producer Ted Robinson&#x27;s choice of Paul McDermott for host. He had dreadlocks at the time, and was best known for the crude, aggressive &quot;bad boy&quot; character he had played in the Doug Anthony All Stars. In addition, it was doubted that he was capable of ad libbing and speaking well, as in past interviews he had usually allowed his fellow band members to do most of the talking. McDermott cut off his dreadlocks for the show and succeeded in broadening his appeal by showing a gentler, more charming side as host. He has said that although he feels there are still elements of his more aggressive character in &quot;Good News Week&quot;, they are &quot;toned down... I&#x27;ve got to be the generous host now, spin-the-wheel sort of thing. I&#x27;m basing myself on Mike Brady now. I&#x27;m the disciplinarian.&quot; Mikey Robins was a part of the series from its beginning as one of the team captains. Both Amanda Keller and Anthony Ackroyd briefly participated as the second team captain before Julie McCrossin took on the role.

The show initially struggled to gain a following, and McDermott admits that the early shows were &quot;a little wobbly&quot; and that he was not quite sure of the role he was supposed to be playing. &quot;After only six episodes the critics said we were goners,&quot; says Robins. &quot;In fact, the first publicity we got said we were axed.&quot; In late 1996, while facing budget cuts, the ABC announced the cancellation of &quot;Good News Week&quot;, but later reversed the decision. The series grew in popularity and by 1997 was attracting an average of 750,000 viewers nationally, occasionally beating commercial stations in the ratings.

The show was filmed at the ABC Studios in Gore Hill for its 1996–1999 seasons, then production moved to its old home at Global Television Studios in North Ryde, for its 1999–2000 seasons.

In 1999, Network Ten purchased the rights to &quot;Good News Week&quot; in a reported $6 million deal after outbidding the Seven Network, the Nine Network and the ABC. The show&#x27;s move to commercial television sparked outrage among some fans, who felt that this was a &#x27;sell-out&#x27;, but the show&#x27;s staff expressed optimism about the change, describing it as a new challenge and a chance to reinvent themselves. Robins has described ABC as a channel that allows new talent to find their feet, and argued that as &quot;Good News Week&quot; had achieved this it was time to move on and make way for other performers. He added that Ten had allowed the writers great artistic freedom, perhaps even more than the ABC had permitted. &quot;We can be even crueller about the Government without getting messages from on high,&quot; he said. The show retained all of its stars and the majority of writers and technical staff after the transition.

Among the show&#x27;s guest panellists were Adam Spencer, Margaret Scott, Peter Berner, Amanda Keller, Tanya Bulmer, Anthony Morgan, Rod Quantock, Rove McManus, Johanna Griggs and Hugh Jackman, as well as several political figures such as Democrat senator Natasha Stott Despoja, then-Minister for Justice and Customs Amanda Vanstone and Deputy Prime Minister of Australia Tim Fischer. Amanda Keller, a frequent panellist, advised guests of the show to &quot;talk, no matter what... Err on the side of verbal diarrhoea because they can always cut things out.&quot;

Ten cancelled the series in 2000, but early in 2001 announced that it had struck a deal for a limited series of &quot;Good News Week&quot; specials and debates.

===Second run (2008–2012)===
While Network Ten had initially intended only to bring back &quot;Good News Week&quot; as a one-off special, the short supply of US shows resulting from the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike caused the network to take an interest in developing more local programs and the show returned as a weekly series. The revived series premiered on 11 February 2008 with McDermott reprising his role as host. Robins returned as a team captain and comedian Claire Hooper replaced McCrossin as the opposing captain.

Many segments from the show&#x27;s initial run, such as &quot;What&#x27;s the Story?&quot;, &quot;Strange But True&quot;, &quot;Magazine Mastermind&quot;, &quot;Buzzers of Death&quot; and &quot;Warren&quot;, were largely unchanged, while others were updated or renamed such as &quot;So You Think You Can Mime?&quot; (formerly &quot;Bad Street Theatre&quot;) and &quot;Blow Up Your Pants&quot; (formerly &quot;Scattergories&quot;). New segments included &quot;Couch Potato&quot; and &quot;Dirty Sexy Fast Money&quot;, the show&#x27;s weekly final challenge. The original theme, &quot;It&#x27;s Good News Week&quot; by Hedgehoppers Anonymous, was also updated with a cover version performed by McDermott.

Online presence was another new aspect of the show, with full episodes, extended monologues, behind-the-scenes footage and video blogs by McDermott made viewable on the Ten website. Viewers were also able to vote online for the GNW Awards, special season finale shows offering awards for newsmakers during the year in fields such as sport, entertainment, politics and religion.

The show&#x27;s return was well received, maintaining steady ratings in a competitive time slot and often being extended from 60 to 90 minutes of run time (including commercials). McDermott was also nominated for a Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television in 2010.

The show returned to its former home, at ABC Studios in Ultimo, for its 2008–2010 seasons. In 2011, production moved to Fox Studios in Sydney.

In 2011, the show was placed on hiatus following various programming changes by Network Ten. A skit-based spin-off named &quot;Good News World&quot; starring McDermott, Robins, Hooper and several regular &quot;Good News Week&quot; guests, was produced for the later half of 2011. Neither show was renewed for 2012, however a finale special for &quot;Good News Week&quot; was filmed at the 2012 Melbourne International Comedy Festival and televised on 28 April.

==Spin-offs==

===&quot;Good News Weekend&quot; (1998)===
In 1998, a ten-week series entitled &quot;Good News Weekend&quot; aired on the ABC in the Saturday night time slot usually occupied by Roy and HG, who were away working in Britain at the time. The show was hosted by McDermott and featured regular team captains Robins and McCrossin. Unlike the weekly show, &quot;Good News Weekend&quot; was focussed more strongly on popular culture than the news and frequently featured musical guests and stand-up performers. The shows were broadcast live, with the exception of a few prerecorded sketches.

===&quot;GNW Night Lite&quot; (1999)===
During 1999, a second spin-off was created for Network Ten. &quot;GNW Night Lite&quot; featured the regular cast, in addition to Flacco and The Sandman. Like &quot;Good News Weekend&quot;, it was focussed on music and variety and games tended to relate to popular culture rather than current events. There would also generally be a musical act and Flacco and The Sandman would perform humorous monologues and dialogues between segments. McDermott describes the show as having been &quot;a fairly radical departure&quot; and says that they initially struggled with it, but by 2000 had found a combination with which they were comfortable.

===&quot;Good News World&quot; (2011)===
In 2011, Network Ten announced they would be resting the &quot;Good News Week&quot; panel format and introducing a skit-based spin-off titled &quot;Good News World&quot;. McDermott, Robins and Hooper returned as regular cast members, along with &quot;Good News Week&quot; regulars Tom Gleeson, Akmal Saleh, Cal Wilson, Sammy J and Randy. The show was poorly received, with criticisms centring on its scripted nature and lack of spontaneity in comparison to the original &quot;Good News Week&quot; format.

==Other media==
Several items of merchandise were available from ABC stores including
* Two books (&quot;Good News Week Book One&quot;, &quot;Good News Week Book Two&quot;)
* Two CDs (&quot;Paul McDermott Unplugged: The Good News Week Tapes Volume 1&quot;, and &quot;Live Songs from Good News Week: The Good News Week Tapes Volume 2&quot;)
* VHS video (&quot;Good News Week: Unseen and Obscene&quot;).

==Reception==
===Logie Awards===
In 1999 and 2000, Good News Week was nominated for two Logie Awards in the categories of Most Popular Comedy Program and Most Outstanding Comedy Program. Host, Paul McDermott was nominated for the Gold Logie award in 2010 for his role on this show.

===ARIA Music Awards===
The ARIA Music Awards are a set of annual ceremonies presented by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), which recognise excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of the music of Australia. They commenced in 1987.

<doc id="1069333" wikidata="Q1087981" url="?curid=1069333" title="The Gift of Game">
<text>The Gift of Game is the debut studio album by American band Crazy Town. It was released on November 9, 1999, in the U.S. by Columbia Records. The album yielded the band its biggest hit with &quot;Butterfly&quot; which reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on March 24, 2001.

Worldwide the album sold more than 2.5 million units, with more than 1.6 million in the US alone.

== Background ==
As Crazy Town refused to cede their official website to Columbia Records (as per a contract clause), the record label barred the group from advertising it on the album&#x27;s artwork. The band circumvented the ban by adding a last-minute outro to the album, titled after the website (www.crazytown.com), and in which the URL is repeating multiple times.

The girl licking the lollipop on the cover of the album is a fictional character created by Crazy Town, known as &quot;Little Lolita&quot;. Both the album title and the picture of Little Lolita are based on lyrics from the song &quot;Lollipop Porn&quot;. The album cover was designed by co-lead singer Shifty Shellshock&#x27;s father and uncle. A song titled &quot;Lolita&quot; later appeared on Shellshock&#x27;s solo album &quot;Happy Love Sick&quot; and her image reappears on Crazy Town&#x27;s third album &quot;The Brimstone Sluggers&quot;.

==Reception==
Steve Huey at AllMusic described the album as &quot;similar to many other rap-inflected alternative metal albums in that it concentrates on sound over structure, creating macho, aggressive grooves with grinding, noisily textured guitars and the underlying feel of squared-off hip-hop beats&quot;. Huey argued that despite signs of Limp Bizkit&#x27;s &quot;juvenile humor&quot;, the album &quot;shows promise&quot;. April Long of &quot;NME&quot; criticized the album for its generic guitar riffs, and containing &quot;some of the most Neanderthal lyrics ever written&quot;.

About the album&#x27;s lyrics, Shifty Shellshock said: &quot;We&#x27;re just having a good time. We&#x27;re not like political or anything. I can be very sarcastic just like a little punk, we talk a lot of trash. We have some points, like &#x27;learn from your mistakes&#x27;, &#x27;check yourself&#x27;, you know, &#x27;don&#x27;t get taken advantage of&#x27;. Real simple things, nothing too overwhelming&quot;.

<doc id="1069338" wikidata="Q14874255" url="?curid=1069338" title="Hwa Chong Institution">
<text>Hwa Chong Institution (HCI) is an independent secondary educational institution in Bukit Timah, Central Region, Singapore. It was established in 2005 by the merger of The Chinese High School (1919–2004) and Hwa Chong Junior College (1974–2005).

HCI provides secondary education for boys only from Years 1 to 4, and pre-university education for both boys and girls in Years 5 and 6. Since 2005, HCI and its affiliated school Nanyang Girls&#x27; High School have offered a six-year Integrated Programme, which allows students to skip the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level examinations and proceed to take the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examinations at the end of Year 6. Its name &quot;Hwa Chong&quot; (&quot;Hua Zhong&quot; or &quot;华中&quot;) is an abbreviation of The Chinese High School&#x27;s Chinese name, &quot;Hua Qiao Zhong Xue&quot; or &quot;华侨中学&quot;.

A Ministry of Education-designated &quot;FutureSchool&quot;, HCI operates under the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) for bilingualism, and offers the Integrated Programme and the Gifted Education Programme. HCI has been a top feeder school for international students to the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge. The institution is also a member of Strategic Alliance of Global Educators, Strategic Educational Alliance of Southeast Asia and the Global Learning Alliance which involves some of the world&#x27;s most innovative schools from the highest performing nations, including Australia, Canada, China, Finland, New Zealand, Singapore, Sweden, and the United States. HCI has also forged partnerships with educational institutions across five continents, including cross-border research collaboration with the Dominion High School in Virginia and Staples High School in Connecticut.

==History==
Previously two separate but affiliated schools — The Chinese High School and Hwa Chong Junior College – HCI was established through a merger on 1 January 2005. It was among the first batch of schools to offer the six-year Integrated Programme, which leads directly to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examinations at the end of the sixth year. In spite of the merger, the High School section remains boys-only. The College section remains co-educational; its Integrated Programme cohort consists of boys from Hwa Chong&#x27;s High School section as well as girls from Nanyang Girls&#x27; High School .

===The Chinese High School (1919–2004)===

The Chinese High School was founded by Tan Kah Kee in March 1919 at Niven Road, as the Singapore Nanyang Overseas Chinese Middle School (). With an enrolment of 78 pupils, it was the first Chinese institution of higher learning at that time in Southeast Asia, catering to Chinese dialect groups amongst the overseas Chinese. Six years later, the school moved to its Bukit Timah campus.

After its founding, the school offered comprehensive secondary level Chinese education. It remained funded and supported by Tan Kah Kee until shortly before World War II. In 1934, Lee Kong Chian, Tan Kah Kee&#x27;s son-in-law, became the chairman of the school&#x27;s board and remained in his post until 1955. During his tenure, the school faced the threat of closure several times due to financial difficulties, but managed to survive due to strong financial support from Lee and Tan. Together, they built a legacy which is currently commemorated by the school body through songs, plays, musical performances, and a heritage trail.

During the Battle of Singapore, the school&#x27;s clock tower, due to its height and vantage point, served as a headquarters for the Allied defenders. Following the war, the school resumed its Chinese education. In the 1950s and 1960s, during periods of civil unrest in Singapore, many students, teachers and alumni participated in or led the anti-colonial riots.

After Singapore gained independence in 1965, the school came under the purview of the Ministry of Education and was accorded the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) status in 1979. Later, in 1988, the school achieved the status of an independent school. This scheme was perceived by the ministry as successful, and was thus extended to other well-performing schools in Singapore. On 19 March 1999, the school&#x27;s clock tower was gazetted as a national monument.

===Hwa Chong Junior College (1974–2004)===

In the late 1960s, Singapore&#x27;s education system for secondary schools was in the form of a four-year programme followed by a two-year programme for pre-university education. The Chinese High School&#x27;s board of directors decided to construct a junior college immediately adjacent to the school. This junior college was the second to be built in Singapore, and the first government-aided one.

Hwa Chong Junior College began lessons in 1974 under the same administration as The Chinese High School. The name &quot;Hwa Chong&quot; (&quot;Hua Zhong&quot;) is an abbreviation of The Chinese High School&#x27;s Chinese name, &quot;Hua Qiao Zhong Xue&quot;, to mark the relationship between the two schools. During its initial thirteen years, Hwa Chong Junior College gradually developed into a top junior college in Singapore, with the school frequently producing high-scoring students in the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examinations.

Hwa Chong Junior College moved out of its campus at Bukit Timah Road in the late 1980s following the discovery of structural problems with the building to facilitate rebuilding. Students were relocated to Ngee Ann Polytechnic initially, before a temporary campus was erected in Bukit Batok. The temporary campus was utilised from 1987 to 1992, as reconstruction works proceeded at the original campus. Lessons restarted at the original campus in 1993.

After The Chinese High School was accorded independent school status in 1987, Hwa Chong Junior College followed suit in 2004, becoming the first junior college in Singapore to be granted the status of an independent school.

===Merger as Hwa Chong Institution (2005–present)===
Following the introduction of the Integrated Programme into Singapore&#x27;s education system in the early 2000s, The Chinese High School merged with Hwa Chong Junior College on 1 January 2005 to form an integrated institution, featuring a High School section and a college section. The merged institution kept the native name of The Chinese High School (), and adopted &quot;Hwa Chong Institution&quot; as its administrative name. The college section is formally renamed as &quot;Hwa Chong Institution (College)&quot; () In the same year, Hwa Chong International School was established under the auspices of the institution, offering independent education that leads to the International Baccalaureate Diploma.

When HCI was formed in 2005, the former Hwa Chong Junior College&#x27;s principal Ang Wee Hiong became the new principal and chief executive officer of HCI, while Hon Chiew Weng, who was previously the principal of The Chinese High School, became principal of the High School Section and Deputy Chief Executive Officer of HCI.

In 2008, HCI was selected by the Ministry of Education to implement the FutureSchools@Singapore programme, one of five initial schools to do so and amongst the eventual fifteen planned. In the same year, the Hwa Chong Diploma was introduced and has been awarded to the best performing 30% of each year&#x27;s graduating cohort on top of the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level certificate.

After Hon Chiew Weng succeeded Ang Wee Hiong as Principal of HCI in 2009, the role of chief executive officer was abolished. Hon stated that since HCI was a school and not a company, there was no need for a chief executive officer. Hon retired on 22 December 2017, and was succeeded by Pang Choon How, an alumnus of the school who was previously the principal of Chung Cheng High School (Main).

==== 100th Anniversary ====
HCI commemorated its centenary on its founder&#x27;s day, 21 March 2019.

On 21 March 2019, in commemoration of the school&#x27;s centennial, a dinner dubbed the &quot;dinner of 10,000 people&quot; was organised and held. It was celebrated in the field before the school&#x27;s iconic clock tower and the statue of Tan Kah Kee, the school&#x27;s founder. The celebratory dinner entered the Singapore Book of Records as the largest school anniversary dinner, with 12,581 attendees, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. This was the fifth time Hwa Chong had organised such a celebratory dinner, with prior dinners in 1979, 1989, 1999 and 2009.

The same year, the school staged the Centennial Musical at the National University of Singapore Cultural Centre. The musical featured 537 participants, and was attended by alumna Sim Ann, Senior Minister of State at the Ministry of Communications and Information. The Singapore Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s Tan Wee-Hsin was the conductor, while Yang Wenzhong was the director at-large with the orchestra comprising HCI students.

== School identity and culture ==
=== Uniform and attire ===
In the High School Section, students in Secondary 1 to Secondary 3 (inclusive) wear a white short-sleeved shirt with khaki short trousers and white socks, which must cover the ankles. The four metal buttons must be worn on the two front pockets and on both shoulders. The school collar pin should be worn on the left collar. Either white, blue or black shoes with either white or black laces must be worn. Secondary 4 students wear beige long trousers with a beige shirt, similar to the boys in the College Section. College girls wear a beige blouse and a beige skirt. The uniform for the College Section is the same as that of the former Hwa Chong Junior College, and it was designed by a Malay girl of the pioneer batch.

=== Discipline ===
Students earn demerit points for poor behaviour. Accumulated demerit points can affect final grades and eligibility for certain awards, scholarships and overseas trips. The student handbook for the High School Section states that students who commit serious offences may be punished with detention, caning, suspension, or expulsion. Only the principal or discipline master may administer caning. Students found smoking are immediately caned or suspended or both. Caning may also be given for integrity-related offences (e.g. cheating), uncivilised behaviour (e.g. defiance), and criminal offences (e.g. fighting).

=== Crest ===
The current school crest of HCI is a stylised form of the traditional Chinese character &quot;Huá&quot; (華), which is part of the school name and reflects its Chinese heritage. The red crest also bears much similarity to a burning torch of passion.

==Affiliations==
=== Nanyang Girls&#x27; High School ===
HCI offers the six-year Integrated Programme with its affiliated school Nanyang Girls&#x27; High School (NYGH), which is known as the Hwa Chong Affiliate Programme. Under the programme, NYGH students and HCI High School students proceed to the HCI College Section for their pre-university education in Years 5 and 6, and sit for the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examinations at the end of Year 6. However, HCI High School and NYGH students who have not achieved a Mean Subject Grade (MSG) of 3.00 or below at the end of Year 4, or who have applied to leave the Integrated Programme, do not proceed to the HCI College Section for Years 5 and 6.

=== Hwa Chong Family of Schools ===
Under the umbrella Hwa Chong family of schools, HCI is affiliated to Hwa Chong International School (HCIS) and Hwa Chong Institution Boarding School (HCIBS). All three schools share the same prefix in their names, and are located in the same main campus. However, in spite of the multi-sharing, each school possesses its own set of facilities, though students from the different schools may access and use the facilities in other schools.

HCIS is a co-educational, private independent international school offering a six-year programme from Grade 7 (11–13 years old) to Grade 12 that leads to the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma. In the interim years, the students will sit for the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE). HCIS saw its final batch of graduating IGCSE students and the first batch of graduating IB students in 2010.

HCIBS is the institution&#x27;s boarding school, accommodating HCI&#x27;s international scholars. It also houses international scholars studying in other local schools such as Singapore Chinese Girls&#x27; School and Bukit Panjang Government High School. Local Singaporean boarders staying in the boarding school are participants of HCI&#x27;s Integrated Boarding Programme. The boarding complex was designed by architect Kenzo Tange, consisting of seven six-storey halls providing accommodation for up to 1,000 boarders or guests.

==Campus==
The main campus of HCI in Bukit Timah covers 72 acres, making it one of the largest campuses in Southeast Asia. The campus land is shared among the Hwa Chong family of schools, which also include Hwa Chong International School and Hwa Chong Institution Boarding School. Also onsite is the Bukit Timah campus of the Singapore University of Social Sciences and its administrative headquarters. Despite the multi-sharing, each entity possesses its own set of facilities, marked by certain perimeters. The school also has a national monument in its campus.

=== Main Campus ===

==== Clock Tower ====

The 31-metre tall clock tower of the school is a national monument. It is the only school in Singapore to have a national monument in its campus. It is built in the neoclassical architectural style. It was built in 1925 by Swan &amp; Maclaren and was funded by donations of the Chinese community. The clock tower was gazetted as a national monument in 1999. The classrooms in the building which holds the clock tower is used for special programmes.

==== Library ====
There are two libraries in the campus, the Jing Xian Library in the college section and the Kong Chian Library in the High School section respectively. The Jing Xian library was founded in 1974, and was renamed in 1983 in honour of the father of the chairman of the management committee. The Kong Chian Library officially opened as the Kuo Chuan Library in 1957, but was later renamed in honour of Lee Kong Chian in 1967.

==== Science Research Centre ====

The Science Research Centre, built in 2008, has ten purpose-built laboratories in which students experience different research disciplines outside of the usual curriculum, including labs for Robotics and Engineering, Biotechnology and Microbiology, and the Pharmaceutical Sciences. The centre provides resources to support the research and innovation programmes, serving as a central facility for student research activities.

==== Ong Teng Cheong SALT Centre ====

The Ong Teng Cheong Student Activities and Leadership Training Centre (also called the Ong Teng Cheong SALT Centre, or the SALT Centre), named in honour of alumnus Ong Teng Cheong, the fifth President of Singapore, aims to develop students holistically, particularly in arts and leadership development. Housed in it are dance studios, music rooms, and a cardiovascular and weight-training room. The centre also houses a moot parliament hall modelled on the Singapore Parliamentary Chamber. The venue is used for events such as student council meetings, co-curricular activities, lectures by guests speakers, and Model United Nations conferences such as the Hwa Chong Model ASEAN Summit and The Hague International Model United Nations conference.

Other facilities in Hwa Chong Institution include a table tennis room, street soccer courts, a judo dojo, three-storey library, a makerspace, a gymnasium, a 400-metre track, a multi-purpose hall, a multi-storey carpark, lecture theatres, general laboratories and classrooms.

=== Overseas campuses ===
====Beijing Satellite Campus====
In line with the school&#x27;s plan to set up a Global Academy, HCI established its Beijing Satellite Campus in 2007, the first of its kind for a Singapore school. An agreement was inked with The Second High School Attached to Beijing Normal University, in which classrooms will be leased. A total of four batches of students make their way to the campus every year, staying for up to two months. Priority is given to scholars of HCI&#x27;s Bicultural Studies Programme and Humanities Programme. Students in the campus take lessons together with students from China in partner schools, carry out community involvement activities, and take field trips to cities such as Xi&#x27;an, Tianjin and Shanghai.

HCI has been quoted as saying that it is looking to opening satellite campuses in India and the United States, with the aim of establishing the two in the near future. In July 2010, it was announced that HCI would be developing a school in the Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City in Guangzhou, akin to that of its first satellite campus, following the inking of a memorandum of understanding. This would see HCI partnering a top local school for exchange and mutual learning programmes.

==== Xi&#x27;an Winter Campus ====
In addition to the Beijing Satellite Campus, the Xi&#x27;an Winter Campus was set up in 2011 with its site based in High School Affiliated to Xi&#x27;an Jiaotong University. Students partaking in the Winter Campus programme would spend four weeks there attending lessons that are conducted in Chinese and focused on humanities subjects including history, geography, literature, socio-Economic as well as political aspects of China. This programme also provides opportunities for students who are strong in English, mathematics and the sciences, but weaker in Chinese, to better master the language and to immerse themselves in a different environment, and at the same time, appreciate Chinese culture and history.

== Information ==
Secondary 1 boys first enter the High School Section and study there for four years before proceeding to the College Section, where they prepare to take the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examinations at the end of Year 6. The High School Section uses the Mean Subject Grade (MSG) grading system in tests and exams. The school-wide Integrated Programme offered enables students to skip the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level examinations, which is typically taken by Secondary 4 students in Singapore. The Hwa Chong Diploma was introduced in 2008 and is awarded to the best performing 30% of its graduating cohort. It is awarded on top of the GCE Advanced Level certificate, and is an added qualification to university applications.

The school enrols an estimated 4,000 students, spread across the six levels, with a student-teacher ratio of 13:1. Hwa Chong Institution has produced 58 President&#x27;s Scholars. The college section&#x27;s Humanities Programme has a significant percentage of its students going on to study abroad at places such as the University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, Harvard University, Yale University, Stanford University, University of Chicago, NYU, UC Berkeley, Peking University and Tsinghua University.

===Consortia and faculties===
Students in the High School Section are divided into what are called &quot;consortia&quot; – a different naming convention from the typical house system. The four consortia in the school are Aphelion, iSpark, Ortus and ProEd. The iSpark consortium houses HCI&#x27;s Gifted Education Programme students. The consortia work closely with one another and each has its own student council. In the College Section, the student population is divided into four faculties – Apollo, Ares, Athena and Artemis – named after Greek deities.

===Special programmes===
Various special programmes are offered in HCI, such as the Bicultural Studies Programme, the Art Elective Programme and the Science and Math Talent Programme. These programmes offer a degree of specialisation that is generally not possible in the standard curriculum, enabling students in the school to explore respective fields to a greater degree. Despite having similar names, the special programmes offered in the High School and College sections are different; however, most are closely associated with each other. An example would be the Humanities Programme (HP), in which the high school HP focuses on the three core humanities subjects – History, Geography and English Literature, while the college HP offers a greater variety of subjects such as China studies and economics while gearing students for university humanities programmes locally and abroad.

Special programmes offered in the school are as follows:

* Bicultural Studies Programme (BSP)
* Computing Talent Programme (CTP)
* Language Elective Programme (LEP)
* Science and Math Talent Programme (SMTP)
* Humanities Programme (HP)
* Art Elective Programme (AEP)
* Malay Special Programme (MSP)
* Research Studies
* School-based Gifted Plus Programme
* Gifted And Talented Education Programme (GATE)
* Structured Integrated Programme (SIP-for students who are not faring well in their studies)

In 2008, the Centre for Scholastic Education (CSE) was set up to house all special programmes in the High School Section except for the AEP and the MSP. They are the BSP, HP and SMTP. From 2013 onwards, all students participating in Special Programmes are housed under CSE, part of the iSpark Consortium. The Integrated Programme-Special Programme (IPSP) has been abolished in the same year. CSE also used to house the now-defunct Entrepreneurship Programme. CSE is an umbrella term to describe the specialised academic programmes offered at the upper secondary level.

HCI&#x27;s AEP students have consistently attained awards such as the UOB Painting of the Year Award, and scholarships from the Media Development Authority, National Arts Council, Urban Redevelopment Authority and Ministry of Education to further their studies within creative fields. All in all, the programme aspires to produce cultural leaders and entrepreneurs who will contribute to Singapore&#x27;s cultural capital in the areas of fine art, design, and new media

In 2013, the Special Science and Maths Talent programme (SSMT) was introduced to the SMTP curriculum to train talented students in areas such as physics and biology. Sexuality and relationship education programmes are also conducted.

===Sabbatical Programme===
Under HCI&#x27;s Integrated Programme, the Sabbatical Programme is offered whereby students from Secondary 1 to 4 go on one-week sabbatical courses in each term in the first semester (Terms 1 and 2). The programme is unique in allowing the majority of the school populace to put aside formal curricular lessons for a week in pursuit of their passions or interests, though some students are required to attend certain courses by their teachers&#x27; discretion. Sabbaticals offered are of a wide variety, in categories as defined by the school: Arts &amp; Aesthetics, Chinese Studies, Humanities, English &amp; Literature, Leadership, Technology, Science and Math, Camps and Student Exchange; they are essentially courses for students to opt for, such as beginner guitar and songwriting lessons, professional music production, Model United Nations training camps, football friendlies with other schools, etc. Also, the school requires students to use the specifically designed Online Bidding System – the i-ComP – to organise their sabbatical plans. Students who accumulate demerit points as a result of various offences are penalised in their sabbatical bidding or are recommended for corrective work order.

==Co-curricular activities==
HCI offers a wide variety of extra-curricular activities called co-curricular activities (CCAs) by the Ministry of Education, and this is in part due to the school&#x27;s large student population and size. It offers more than 30 CCAs.

===Sports===
There are a number of sports CCAs offered in HCI, ranging from soccer to ten-pin bowling, and from wushu to touch rugby. The fencing, canoeing, gymnastics, judo, shooting, table tennis, and track and field teams garner nationwide achievements almost every year. HCI has won track and field championships in most divisions. The HCI track &amp; field team used to hold and currently holds a few national records, particularly in pole vault. Other sports which have achieved significant results over the years include the basketball, canoeing, taekwondo, volleyball, water polo and wushu teams. For example, in 2010, the volleyball team won the championships in both A divisions (Boys and Girls). Nine HCI students were selected to represent Singapore in the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, two of them from the championship-winning basketball team.

===Uniformed groups===
There are currently four uniformed groups in HCI: National Cadet Corps (Land), National Police Cadet Corps, St John Brigade, and Scouts (and Ventures &amp; Rovers). These CCAs provide a highly structured organisation and a well-defined hierarchy. The HCI National Cadet Corps unit (HCINCC) has been awarded Gold for 15 consecutive years, winning the Best Unit Competition (BUC) in 2000. Also, HCINCC is the only Centre of Excellence in Precision Drill department amongst all NCC units in Singapore. The National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) is currently the largest uniformed group in Singapore, and in HCI, in terms of membership. HCINPCC is also the only unit in Singapore to have achieved 25 consecutive gold awards in the annual Unit Overall Proficiency Award (UOPA), as of 2022. They have received The NPCC Golden Cane, in honour of their achievement. The St John Brigade is one of two schools awarded Gold in the Corps Achievement Award for 20 consecutive years. The Scouts uniformed group hosts the Bugle Band and Lion Dance troupe, which performs at special and commemorative events. All four uniformed groups achieved Gold in the annual national assessment. Apart from regular planned training, other activities include inter-unit competitions in bowling and captain&#x27;s ball.

===Performing arts===
In 2010, there are eleven performing arts groups in HCI, which are the Chinese Orchestra, the String Orchestra, the Piano Ensemble, the Chinese Drama Club, the Harmonica Ensemble, the English Drama Club, the Choir, the Music And Dance Society, the Guitar Ensemble, the Band and lastly Chinese Dance. By 2023, this number has decreased to 6: Chinese Orchestra, String Orchestra, Chinese Drama, English Drama, Choir, and Band. The 2010 Singapore Youth Festival, saw the English Drama Club judged, where it attained a Silver Award. The previous year, 2009, saw the other performing arts groups being assessed; a number of awards were won, including two Golds with Honours for the Chinese Orchestra and the High School Band.

Apart from occasional performances held locally in Victoria Theatre and the school&#x27;s Drama Centre, many of the performing arts groups travel overseas both for exchange and performances. Amongst them, the High School Band, the Choir, the Chinese Orchestra and the String Orchestra are notable for their international achievements. In 2010 the College Choir attained significant achievements in international competitions, the Festival of Songs in Olomouc, Czech Republic. while in 2011, the choir attained a Gold with Honours in the 2011 Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging of Choirs. The Chinese Orchestra has performed in many overseas performances in China, Malaysia and Australia, and even performed in the SYF closing ceremonies in 2005 and 2009. The Chinese Orchestra has attained Distinction for the Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging for Chinese Orchestras from 2013 to 2023, the highest available accolade, with the exception of 2019, where it gained accomplishment. It attained gold from 1993 to 2011, which was the highest award at the time the grading system was still in effect. The High School Band, which once performed in the Istana, travelled to Hawaii to attend the Pacific Basin Music Festival for the second time in 2010, attaining a gold award. The Band has also performed at the National Day Parade. The High School String Orchestra, more commonly known by the acronym &quot;HCISO&quot;, has also travelled widely. It won first runners-up at the open category of the 2006 Gothenburg International Music Festival, and went on tour with the Australian Boys Choir to Melbourne and Johor Bahru to perform at the opening of the 7th JB Arts Festival. More recently, HCISO has achieved Distinction at the 2023 Singapore Youth Festival. Indeed, all 6 performing arts CCAs has achieved Distinction in the 2023 Singapore Youth Festival, with the exception of Choir. It was also one of the six schools, and the only school in Asia, to be invited to participate in the 2012 Los Angeles International Music Festival at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.

===Leadership===
HCI has nine major leadership bodies for both High School and College. The five leadership bodies in High School are: the High School Council (HSC), Green Council (GC), Values-in-Action Council (VIAC), Students&#x27; National Education Council (SNEC), and the Co-curricular Activities Council (CCAC), and four consortium councils. The College equivalent of the HSC is the Hwa Chong Students&#x27; Council (HCSC), and the College equivalent of the VIAC is the Community Involvement Programme Council (CIPC). HCI also has faculty committees for College, in place of consortium councils. Consortium councils and faculty committees represent the individual consortiums (Aphelion, iSpark, Ortus, Proed) and faculties (Ares, Apollo, Artemis, Athena).

Members of all councils in High School are selected through annual leadership selection camps; for College, members of the HCSC are elected via voting amongst students of the faculty candidates are from. For the College GC, CIPC and SNEC, the President, Vice-President and Attache are selected from the HCSC, while other members go through a standard selection process. For faculty committees, the Faculty Head and Vice Faculty Head are selected from the HCSC and sit as ex officio members of the HCSC Social and Relations Committee. Other members of the faculty committees, namely the Programmes, Sports and Publicity members-in-charge, are first elected by their classes. A shortlist of three students per class is then sent for an interview with faculty leaders before a faculty committee member is selected.

== Outreach programmes ==
HCI organises academic competitions and conferences, both for its students and external participants. The school organises the Asia Pacific Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (APMOPS) and the Singapore Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (SMOPS). The International Science Youth Forum (ISYF) is hosted at HCI and co-organised by Nanyang Technological University, Institute of Advanced Studies (IAS), bringing students from across Asia-Pacific together to network and dialogue, with Nobel laureates coming down to share their experiences in the scientific field; a record five Nobel laureates were involved in 2010.
Hwa Chong annually hosts the Asia-Pacific Young Leaders Summit (HCAPYLS) which brings students all across the world to discuss global issues in summit dialogues. The school also annually hosts the Asian Youth Chinese Forum (AYCF), in conjunction with the school&#x27;s Bicultural Studies Program (BSP), as well the Student Leaders&#x27; Convention (SLC).

Hwa Chong also hosts various Model United Nations events such as Hwa Chong Model ASEAN Summit (HCMAS), and Hwa Chong Conflict Resolution and Inquiry (HCCRI).

== Incidents ==

=== 2020 Singaporean general election ===
In 2020, an email from the school administration advising students not to discuss matters regarding the 2020 Singaporean general election sparked controversy and debate. It was sent on the school&#x27;s Integrated e-Message Board to College Section students, advising them to avoid posting anything related to the general election on social media platforms associated with the school, as well as the students&#x27; own social media accounts. A screenshot of the message was leaked and circulated online, stirring debate on topics such as free speech, political opinions and whether youths should be free to engage in political discussions.

The incident led to a backlash in which a group of alumni, led by filmmaker Anthony Chen, sent a letter to the school administration to express their disappointment. HCI defended its advice to students in a statement saying, &quot;Our intention is not to silence students&#x27; voices, nor to curb their interest in national issues. Instead, we encourage our students to engage actively in discussions and even debates on national issues, in a safe environment.&quot; The school refused to comment if disciplinary action had been taken against students who had raised concerns.

=== Homophobic sex education ===
On 13 July 2022, a school counsellor at the institution gave a talk to secondary 4 students using false content that many deemed to be homophobic. According to reports, amongst the content shown to students was &quot;What are LBGT so proud of?&quot; followed by a list: &quot;58% of homosexuals have problems with intestinal worms&quot;, &quot;&quot;23% of children with lesbian parents have been sexually abused&quot;, &quot;78% of homosexuals have STDs&quot;&quot; and &quot;1 in 15 homosexuals is a pedophile&quot;. Photos of the presentation quickly went viral and was reported by local press and by rights groups in Singapore.

Following the backlash, Hwa Chong released a statement saying that the presentation was based on the individual staff&#x27;s personal perspectives and not of the school or MOE. The school also promised a review of the processes. The school initially suspended the counsellor from giving further sexuality education presentations. On 2 August 2022, however, Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing revealed in a written reply to a question in Parliament that the school had suspended the counsellor from all duties, pending further investigations.

Organizations like Pinkdot have condemned the message and Hwa Chong&#x27;s response to the incident, saying, &quot;To chalk this incident up to the actions of one rogue counsellor ignores systemic issues of inadequate sexuality education.&quot;.

==Notable alumni==
HCI and its predecessor schools, The Chinese High School and Hwa Chong Junior College, have a wide alumni base extending to various sectors and industries in Singapore and other countries. One of the school&#x27;s alumni is Pang Choon How, the previous principal of the school. Its best-known alumnus is probably Ong Teng Cheong, the fifth President of Singapore, who graduated from The Chinese High School in 1955.

Other prominent alumni include politicians such as Grace Fu, Ng Chee Meng, Lee Yi Shyan, Sim Ann and Sam Tan, as well as Singapore Armed Forces top brass such as Ng Yat Chung, Ng Chee Khern, Hoo Cher Mou, Ng Chee Peng, Goh Si Hou and Kelvin Khong.

HCI&#x27;s more notable alumni in business and finance include TikTok chief executive officer Shou Zi Chew, Hyflux founder Olivia Lum, Trafigura Asia chief executive officer Tan Chin Hwee, Novena Holdings founder Toh Soon Huat, and United Overseas Bank chairman Wee Cho Yaw.

In the arts and media, there are also notable HCI alumni such as &quot;The Straits Times&quot; editor Warren Fernandez, musicians Liang Wern Fook and Eric Moo, and artist Tan Swie Hian. South Korean band PENTAGON&#x27;s Yang Hong-seok was also a student of Hwa Chong International School.

<text>The Shrine of the Canadian Martyrs (), commonly known as the Martyrs&#x27; Shrine, is a Roman Catholic and historic place of worship located near Georgian Bay on Ontario Highway 12 in Midland, Ontario, Canada. The Martyrs&#x27; Shrine is consecrated to the memory of the Canadian Martyrs, six Jesuit Martyrs and two lay persons from the mission of Sainte-Marie among the Hurons, who were tortured and killed on various dates in the mid-17th century and subsequently canonized by the Catholic Church. It is one of six national shrines in Canada, including, among others, Saint Joseph&#x27;s Oratory in Montreal and the Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré.

The Shrine&#x27;s church is the Church of St. Joseph, constructed in 1925 in a fusion of European and Indigenous styles. 

==History==

In 1907, Dennis O&#x27;Connor, Archbishop of Toronto, consecrated a small chapel at Waubaushene, near the site where Sts. Jean de Brébeuf and Gabriel Lalemant were martyred. 

In 1925, Fr. John M. Filion, provincial superior of Jesuits in Canada, decided to pursue the construction of a larger church closer to the mission. He bought the Standin farm in Midland, across the road from Sainte-Marie. Construction began that year, using some materials from the Waubaushene church and others donated by lumber companies in Northern Ontario. Pews, stained glass windows, Stations of the Cross and an altar were donated by churches in London and Toronto. The interior, shaped like an overturned canoe, was designed and built by Ildège Bourrie. Construction on the shrine was completed by the winter of 1925, and the shrine was formally consecrated on June 25, 1926 by Cardinal William Henry O&#x27;Connell of Boston, Massachusetts. 

The shrine houses the bones of St. Jean de Brébeuf, St. Gabriel Lalemant, and St. Charles Garnier. Due to cold temperature conditions, the shrine is closed in autumn and winter, because it was built without any insulation. During that period, the reliquaries are taken out of the church. The martyrs were subsequently canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1930. Pope John Paul II visited the Martyrs&#x27; Shrine in September 1984, and prayed over the skull of Brébeuf.

<text>Andranik Eskandarian (Armenian: , , born 31 December 1951) is an Iranian former footballer. He played as a defender for the F.C. Ararat Tehran, Taj SC and New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League.

He won the Iranian league in 1975 and reached the second place in 1974. Further he won the Hazfi Cup in 1977. He played six years for Taj SC. Taj&#x27;s fans called him &quot;Barbed Wire&quot;.

Eskandarian was a member of the Iranian team winning the Asia Cup 1976 in Tehran and reaching the quarterfinals of the Olympic Tournament in Montreal in 1976. He also
played for Iran in the 1978 World Cup, the country&#x27;s first appearance in the tournament. He infamously was the first member of Iran&#x27;s team to score in the World Cup: an own-goal in a match against Scotland that his teammate later tied, 1-1. The game was still considered a success for Iran, including Eskandarian&#x27;s play as a defender against Kenny Dalglish and Joe Jordan, and an embarrassment for Scotland.

Soon after that, he moved to America to play for the highest-profile team in the country, the New York Cosmos, beginning in the 1979 season. After the Cosmos folded in 1984, Eskandarian played for the New York Express during its half-season in the Major Indoor Soccer League. From 1989 through 1990, he played for the New Jersey Eagles of the American Soccer League.

==Personal==
Andranik Eskandarian was born on 31 December 1951 in Tehran to an Armenian family. He is the father of former Major League Soccer player Alecko Eskandarian. Eskandarian became a United States citizen in 1984 and now owns and operates two sporting goods stores in New Jersey.

<text>The Accrington Pals, officially the 11th (Service) Battalion (Accrington), East Lancashire Regiment, was a pals battalion of Kitchener&#x27;s Army raised in and around the town of Accrington during the First World War.

==History==
Recruiting was initiated by the mayor of Accrington following Lord Kitchener&#x27;s call for volunteers, and it took only ten days to raise a complete battalion. The battalion&#x27;s nickname is somewhat misleading since of the four 250-strong companies that made up the original battalion, only one was actually composed of men from Accrington. The rest volunteered from other nearby East Lancashire towns such as Burnley, Blackburn, and Chorley. The men from Chorley, who formed Y Company, were known as the Chorley Pals.
 The men from Burnley, who formed Z Company, were known as the Burnley Pals.

The Accrington Pals joined the 94th Brigade of the 31st Division, a &quot;pals&quot; division containing many North Country pals battalions. With the 31st Division. The division was initially deployed to Egypt in early 1916 to defend the Suez Canal from the threat of the Ottoman Empire The troopship carrying the Accrington Pals was narrowly missed by a torpedo, a fortunate miss because the ship also carried sixty tons of lyddite explosive.

The Accrington Pals next moved to France, where they first saw action in the Battle of the Somme. On the first day on the Somme, on 1 July 1916, the 31st Division was to attack the village of Serre-lès-Puisieux and form a defensive flank for the rest of the British advance. The 31st Division&#x27;s attack on Serre was a complete failure although some of the Accrington Pals made it as far as the village where they were killed or captured. One of the battalion&#x27;s signallers, observing from the rear, reported:

:&quot;We were able to see our comrades move forward in an attempt to cross No Man&#x27;s Land, only to be mown down like meadow grass. I felt sick at the sight of the carnage and remember weeping.&quot;

Approximately 700 men from the Accrington Pals went into action on 1 July; 585 men became casualties, 235 killed and 350 wounded in about half an hour. The battalion&#x27;s commander, Lieutenant-Colonel A. W. Rickman, was among the wounded. A rumour spread around Accrington that only seven men had survived from the battalion, and an angry crowd surrounded the mayor&#x27;s house and demanded information.

The Accrington Pals were effectively wiped out in a matter of minutes on the first day on the Somme. The battalion was brought back up to strength and served for the remainder of the war, moving to the 92nd Brigade of the 31st Division in February 1918.

==12th (Reserve) Battalion==
The 12th (Reserve) Battalion, East Lancashire Regimen, was formed on 14 May 1915 at Chadderton Camp, Oldham, from the depot companies of 11th Battalion. This was a &quot;local reserve&quot; battalion, that is, a reserve battalion for the locally raised (pals) battalion intended to provide trained reinforcements for its parent unit. In the autumn of 1915 it was at Prees Heath Camp in the 17th Reserve Brigade.

On 1 September 1916, it transferred to the Training Reserve (TR) as the 75th Training Reserve Battalion in 17th Reserve Brigade. It was redesignated as the 233rd (Infantry) Battalion, TR, (for those who had completed basic training) on 9 July 1917, and on 23 July it joined 205th Bde of 68th Division at Herringfleet in Suffolk. On 1 November 1917 it was transferred to the King&#x27;s (Liverpool Regiment) as 52nd (Graduated) Bn. Later it moved to Lowestoft, and in the spring of 1918 it was at Saxmundham. In June 1918 it moved to Henham Park, where it remained for the rest of the war. After the war it was converted into a service battalion on 8 February 1919 and sent to join the British Army of the Rhine, where it served in 14th Bde of the Lancashire Division until October 1919. It was disbanded in Germany on 13 February 1920.

==Victoria Cross==

The Victoria Cross is the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. One member of the battalion won the award. Second Lieutenant Basil Arthur Horsfall, 1st Battalion attached to the 11th Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment, won the award on 21 March 1918, between Moyenneville and Ablainzevelle, France. The award was posthumous.

==Legacy==
A song telling their story was written and recorded by English folk singer and comedian Mike Harding. A play based on the unit, &quot;The Accrington Pals&quot;, was also later written by Peter Whelan.

== Memorial ==
A memorial to the battalion stands in the Sheffield Memorial Park in France. Built from Accrington brick and dedicated in 1991, the memorial stands close to the location of the trench line from which the Accrington Pals advanced on the first day of the Somme.

<text>The Offshore Festival was a camp-out rock and alternative music festival held during Easter at a farm near Torquay, Victoria, Australia from the late 1990s to 2001. It was run by the same organisers as the Falls Festival, held at nearby Lorne on New Year&#x27;s Eve. It interlinked with the Rip Curl Pro surfing event, held at nearby Bells Beach and festival ticketholders had free admission to the surfing event.

The festival reached its peak in 2000, when it sold a capacity of 20,000 tickets. The organizers moved the event to the Royal Melbourne Showgrounds (home of the Big Day Out) the following year.

==Artist lineups==
Over the years, the Offshore Festival featured a large range of artists including Blink 182, Silverchair, Tool, Rollins Band, NOFX, Pennywise, L7, Primus, Cosmic Psychos, The Living End, Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals, The Wailers Band and more.

<text>Kingsley College was until 2008 a Wesleyan Methodist Church of Australia school of theology located in Melbourne, Australia.

Its student body had always been largely non-Wesleyan Methodist, and without the students from other Christian denominations the school probably could not have survived as long as it did.

==History==
The college was founded by President of the Australian Wesleyan Methodist Conference and editor of the &quot;Australian Wesleyan&quot; Kingsley Ridgway in 1948, and was (despite being in Melbourne) until 2008 a member institute of the Sydney College of Divinity.

It was originally known as the Wesleyan Methodist Bible College of Australia; but in 1973 its name was changed to honour its founder upon his retirement.
It was funded initially from donations made by Wesleyan Methodist church members in North America, reported by Ridgway as being &quot;in the neighbourhood of one dollar (six shillings) per member over the whole connexion&quot;. Its first principal was professor Leo G. Cox, an American who was elected Conference President in 1948 after Ridgway.

In January 2008 it merged with Tabor Victoria, with the majority of its staff and faculty and the whole of its library transferred to Tabor, with its original building and property scheduled to be sold.
What was left of Kingsley provided only Methodist ministerial training under the umbrella of Tabor, with the tertiary education moving to Tabor.

<doc id="1069354" wikidata="Q2579499" url="?curid=1069354" title="William James Stewart">
<text>William James Stewart (February 13, 1889 – September 28, 1969) was a Canadian politician. He was also a member of the Orange Order in Canada. Stewart also owned and operated the Bates and Dodds Funeral Home on Queen Street West in Toronto.

== Early life ==
He was born in Toronto and first worked as an office boy at a bicycle shop. His education largely consisted of evening courses taken at Shaw Business School in Toronto.

== Political life ==

=== Mayor of Toronto ===

Stewart was alderman for Ward 5 in Toronto from 1924 to 1931. He defeated former mayor Sam McBride, who was attempting to return to office, in the 1931 mayoral election and served as Mayor of Toronto from 1931 until 1934. Stewart was the first mayor to use regular radio broadcasts to keep Toronto citizens informed. He also pushed for the restoration of Fort York, which was re-opened in 1934. He entered provincial politics in 1936 when he ran for the leadership of the Ontario Conservative Party. He came in third place behind Earl Rowe and George Drew. He was elected in a by-election on October 5, 1938, as Conservative Member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario for Parkdale in Toronto&#x27;s west end.

Stewart also owned and operated the Bates And Dodds Funeral Home at 931 Queen Street West at Strachan Avenue

=== Speaker of the Legislative Assembly ===
Following the 1943 election that brought George Drew&#x27;s Tories to power, Stewart became Speaker of the legislature, a difficult task as the Progressive Conservatives (as they were known by then) had only a minority government. He was reappointed Speaker following the 1945 election until he suddenly resigned in March 1947 to become a backbench Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP). Farquhar Oliver, leader of the Ontario Liberal Party, introduced a motion that the assembly refuse to accept the resignation of Stewart but this motion was ruled out of order.

== Backbencher and committee member ==
Stewart became a backbencher and went on to serve on various committees, serving as Chairman of the Select Committee on Reform Institutions from 1953 to 1955. Stewart served until 1948 when he lost to CCF candidate Lloyd Fell. He regained his seat in the 1951 provincial election. He remained a member of the legislature until the 1959 election when his Parkdale seat was won by a Liberal and he left politics.

== Life after politics ==
He served briefly as a member of the Ontario Parole Board in 1960 but found the position too strenuous. Stewart was named chairman of the Toronto Historical Board the following year. He died in Toronto eight years later.

The Stewart Building on College Street bears his name.

==Family connection==

<text>The Cobalt Flux Pad is a polycarbonate plastic and metal dance pad that is used with console dance games such as &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;. It is designed and manufactured by the Salt Lake City-based company Cobalt Flux. It was cited as a popular DDR controller and was also distributed to various institutions.

== Features ==
Fundamentally, the Cobalt Flux Pad is similar to most dance pad designs. Instead of the typical four arrow plus corners panel layout as is common in soft dance pads, there are nine usable foot panels (center, left, right, up, down, and corners).

Internally, the Cobalt Flux Pad is unique among typical hard/metal dance pad designs. Official &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; arcade machine dance pads contain a hollow area beneath each panel with small sensor switches. The Cobalt Flux design contains no hollow areas. Sensor contact is achieved by the flexing of layers of lexan panels and metal plates on a solid wood base.

The Cobalt Flux Pad itself connects to a &quot;control box&quot;, which contains the start and select buttons for the dance controller. The connection to the control box uses a 15-pin serial connector which hangs out of the top of the pad as a dongle. This control box also handles the wiring needed for different gaming console connectors, which lead off of the control box. The control box is removable.

Cobalt Flux have provided two modification kits for their dance platforms. One kit version adds raised black textured panels to the corner panels, and more closely mimics the feel of the arcade platforms.

In 2009 Cobalt Flux launched a system called Blufit which is an eight-mat wireless multiplayer system with their own proprietary dance software, Streetfeet. Eight of these would link together into a 64-player system. Other active or fitness games could be played on it using either the dance pad as a controller, or other input peripherals.

=== Compatibility ===
The pad is compatible with both &quot;DDR&quot; style games (using four arrows), and &quot;Pump It Up&quot; simulators (using five buttons). However, official &quot;Pump It Up&quot; compatibility requires a separate control box, and the corner square panels are smaller than their rectangular equivalents in &quot;Pump It Up&quot;. It is also compatible with the existing eight arrow Dance UK game

The original control box shipped with Cobalt Flux pads was designed to work only with the PlayStation 2. Players who wanted to use the pad with an Xbox or PC by running this control box through converters for standard PS2 controllers experienced an unacceptable amount of latency during play. Cobalt Flux has since released a new control box with built-in connectivity for PS2, Xbox, and the PC.

There is also a special &quot;Pump It Up&quot; version of the control box that enables the center sensor and properly maps all buttons in order to play &quot;Pump It Up&quot; without issue. This version connects to PS2 only.

=== Additional versions ===
In 2005, Cobalt Flux began to offer more durable dance platform variations with extended warranties and additional features like monitor mounts. These were installed at schools, fitness centers, and other institutions, and had identifying decals and black trim to distinguish them from the residential pads. 

These commercial versions are intended to be fixed in place and also have shock absorbing material included to lessen joint strain. The heaviest duty commercial mat is built to US military specification and has a four-year warranty. School platforms have handles as these tend to be set up and packed away.

== Reception ==
&quot;Wired&quot; magazine described the Cobalt Flux Pad as &quot;pricey&quot;, criticizing it as sliding on uncarpeted surfaces, and making &quot;quite the racket&quot; when used. They also cited the necessity for Xbox players to use an adapter as a downside. However, they praised its sturdiness and the ability to link them together. &quot;PSM2&quot; magazine also called it a &quot;very expensive pad&quot;, as well as &quot;solid&quot; and &quot;surprisingly cool-looking&quot;. They ultimately described it as &quot;easily the highest-quality pad we tested&quot; and &quot;wonderfully responsive&quot;, noting that it came with non-skid sticky pads.

&quot;Edge&quot; magazine called the pads &quot;excellent&quot; and &quot;a health club alternative to step aerobics&quot;, citing their use in a linked setup by Scandinavian company Positive Gaming at ATEI 2006. &quot;Skrolli&quot; magazine described the pad as one of the best on the market for home use, but also noted some downsides, such as the propensity for debris to get caught inside the mechanism and cause errors in step recognition.

<text>Rap rock is a music genre that developed from the early to mid-1980s, when hip hop DJs incorporated rock records into their routines and rappers began incorporating original and sampled rock instrumentation into hip hop music. Rap rock is considered to be rock music in which lyrics are rapped, rather than sung. The genre achieved its greatest success in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

==Characteristics==

&quot;AllMusic&quot; characterized rap rock songs as rock songs in which the vocals were rapped rather than sung. &quot;AllMusic&quot; also states that the rhythms of rap rock are rooted in those of hip hop, with more funk influences than normal hard rock. Session player Eddie Martinez, who created the guitar parts for hip hop group Run-DMC&#x27;s rap rock song &quot;Rock Box&quot;, recognized that &quot;a rap-rock song needn&#x27;t feature a new change in the chorus; rather, it&#x27;s a spot where the guitarist can just solo over the same riff that drives the verses.&quot;

Rap rock is often conflated with rap metal, but while the two styles may appear to have minute differences, &quot;AllMusic&quot; says that rap rock has &quot;organic, integrated&quot; hip hop elements, while rap metal features &quot;big, lurching beats and heavy, heavy riffs&quot; and has a tendency to sound &quot;as if the riffs were merely overdubbed over scratching and beat box beats.&quot; &quot;AllMusic&quot; says that old school rap rock had more in common with &quot;hardcore punk or artsy post-punk with breakbeats&quot; than with metal.

==History==
===Old school rap rock (1980s to mid-1990s)===

Early hip hop DJs utilized breaks from rock records, such as Billy Squier&#x27;s &quot;the Big Beat&quot;, the Monkees&#x27; &quot;Mary, Mary&quot; and Steve Miller Band&#x27;s &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot;, in order to &quot;flaunt their vinyl guile&quot;. Impressed by post-punk band Public Image Ltd.&#x27;s incorporation of dub elements into their music, hip hop artist Afrika Bambaataa collaborated with the band&#x27;s singer John Lydon on the single &quot;World Destruction&quot;. The post-punk and new wave scenes also saw the early rap rock recordings &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; and &quot;This Is Radio Clash&quot; by the Clash, influenced by Grandmaster Flash and the Sugarhill Gang, and the new-wave rap song &quot;Rapture&quot; by Blondie. Although the Cold Crush Brothers&#x27; &quot;Punk Rock Rap&quot; did not see much success and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five would wind up being jeered opening for the Clash, Run-DMC saw a crossover audience with their rap rock sound, helping gain rock fans&#x27; acceptance of hip hop. Subsequently, Public Enemy would further unite hip hop and punk rock audiences, &quot;with their rough, hard-hitting boom-bap sound resonating with both black kids in the inner cities and white kids in the suburbs&quot;. Public Enemy brought a punk rock attitude to hip hop; frontman Chuck D cited punk band the Clash&#x27;s triple album &quot;Sandinista!&quot; as a release that made him take notice of hip hop. Another link between hip hop and punk rock was producer Rick Rubin, who split his time between working with hip hop artists Run-DMC and Beastie Boys, and punk-influenced bands like Slayer and the Cult.

Although hip hop music would gain popularity in the 1980s, many dismissed it as either bring a fad, or as a marginal art form which appealed only to urban African Americans. However, a rap rock collaboration between Run-DMC and the rock band Aerosmith helped diminish such biases. The 1986 single &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, a remake of Aerosmith&#x27;s 1975 rock song, helped bring hip hop into popularity with a mainstream white audience. It was the first &quot;Billboard&quot; top ten rap rock success played on radio. The music video signaled &quot;both a literal and metaphoric merging of hard rock and rap&quot;; the recording revitalized Aerosmith&#x27;s career. The same year that Run-DMC released &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, Beastie Boys released their debut album, &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot;, &quot;a head-banging party album that enjoyed multi-platinum sales&quot;. According to &quot;CNN&quot;, the album &quot;essentially invented rap-rock&quot;, as demonstrated by songs like &quot;Rhymin&#x27; and Stealin&#x27;&quot;, which was built around samples from Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and the Clash, &quot;(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)&quot; and &quot;No Sleep till Brooklyn&quot;, which featured guitar playing by Slayer&#x27;s Kerry King. Also that year, rap rock band Urban Dance Squad formed, and according to &quot;AllMusic&quot; writer Heather Phares, the band&#x27;s &quot;mix of rock, rap, funk, ska, folk, hip-hop, and soul signaled the trend toward genre-bending that prevailed in &#x27;90s music.&quot; Public Enemy&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back&quot; contained a song which sampled Slayer, and in 1991, the hip hop group would re-record their song &quot;Bring the Noise&quot; with the metal band Anthrax, a collaboration &quot;Spin&quot; deemed to be a weak retread of the &quot;Walk This Way&quot; collaboration.

The 1990s saw rap rock achieving mainstream success. Faith No More reached a large audience with their 1990 hit &quot;Epic&quot;, in which the band&#x27;s singer, Mike Patton, mixed singing and rapping. Rage Against the Machine also saw success with rap rock music influenced by political hip hop. According to the &quot;BBC&quot;, 1990s hip hop artists like Ice Cube, DMX and Onyx displayed the punk rock sensibilities of hip hop. This period also saw Beastie Boys reinventing themselves by distancing themselves from the frat boy image they portrayed on their &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; album; harkening back to the group&#x27;s roots in hardcore punk, Beastie Boys began playing live instruments again on their 1992 album &quot;Check Your Head&quot;, a &quot;groundbreaking record that captured suburban skateboard culture with a goofy melding of rap, rock, funk, and thrash&quot; and this album, along with their follow-up, &quot;Ill Communication&quot;, demonstrated that rock, hip hop and jazz could coexist on a single album. However, the genre had developed a bad aesthetic reputation, owing to &quot;a series of ill-advised, record-company driven projects&quot; which included the soundtrack album to the film &quot;Judgment Night&quot; (1993), which featured rock artists collaborating with rappers on every track, the results of which &quot;Slate&quot; described as being &quot;lumpy and uneven&quot; in its fusion of rap with grunge and metal; &quot;Slate&quot; wrote, &quot;the subsequent corporate rap rock of the &#x27;90s followed the blander, more conservative examples of fusion to be found on &quot;Judgment Night&quot;.&quot; In the book &quot;Is Hip Hop Dead? The Past, Present, and Future of America&#x27;s Most Wanted Music&quot;, author Mickey Hess identifies Kid Rock as connecting hip hop music to rap rock, due to the musician having started out as a hip hop artist, before shifting his style from sample-based hip hop to guitar-driven alternative rock that fused hip hop beats, boasting and fashion with hard rock guitar and Southern rock attitude, influenced by classic rock and country music. After releasing &quot;two albums of pure Beastie Boys worship&quot;, including his first rap rock album, &quot;The Polyfuze Method&quot; (1993), Kid Rock began to explore his Southern rock influences on &quot;Early Mornin&#x27; Stoned Pimp&quot; (1996), and &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; (1998), the latter of which &quot;extended the lineage of rap-rock&quot; with an album that sold over 14 million copies, and helped to &quot;ignite the rap-rock genre&quot;.

===Golden age rap rock (late 1990s)===

The late 1990s has been cited as rap rock&#x27;s &quot;golden age&quot;. Separate from rap rock, but developing popularity around the same time in the late 1990s, was nu metal. Nu metal would ultimately be conflated with rap rock, although the two genres did not have much in common. However, the Woodstock &#x27;99 festival and the band Limp Bizkit would wind up linking, as well as shifting critical opinion of both genres from the acclaim they&#x27;d initially received to near-universal disdain. The band&#x27;s frontman, Fred Durst, grew up with hip hop music, and Limp Bizkit would have a stronger connection to rap rock than any previous artist in nu metal, including having former House of Pain turntablist DJ Lethal as part of their line-up. The release of Limp Bizkit&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Significant Other&quot; was pinpointed as a breakthrough for rap rock. Selling more than more than 7 million copies, and featuring the hit single &quot;Nookie&quot; as well as a guest appearance by Wu-Tang Clan rapper Method Man, &quot;Significant Other&quot; demonstrated the commercial viability of rap rock by &quot;drawing from Rage&#x27;s metallic aggression and the Beastie Boys&#x27; skateboard-slacker attitude&quot;. However, Limp Bizkit&#x27;s performance at Woodstock &#x27;99 was linked to festival violence. The festival featured performances by multiple rap rock artists, including Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Insane Clown Posse and Rage Against the Machine, all of which were considered the &quot;breakout stars&quot; of the festival. However, despite these performances being well received, Limp Bizkit&#x27;s performance was subject to national controversy as violence and vandalism occurred during and after the band&#x27;s performance; this included fans tearing plywood from the walls during a performance of their song &quot;Break Stuff&quot;. Durst stated during the concert, &quot;Don&#x27;t let anybody get hurt. But I don&#x27;t think you should mellow out. That&#x27;s what Alanis Morissette had you motherfuckers do. If someone falls, pick &#x27;em up.&quot; Durst said during a performance of the band&#x27;s hit song &quot;Nookie&quot;, &quot;We already let all the negative energy out. Its time to reach down and bring that positive energy to this motherfucker. Its time to let yourself go right now, &#x27;cause there are no motherfuckin&#x27; rules out there.&quot; Eyewitnesses also reported a crowd-surfing woman being pulled down into the crowd and assaulted in the mosh pit during Limp Bizkit&#x27;s set. Widely blamed for inciting the crowd to violence, Durst later stated in an interview, &quot;I didn&#x27;t see anybody getting hurt. You don&#x27;t see that. When you&#x27;re looking out on a sea of people and the stage is in the air and you&#x27;re performing, and you&#x27;re feeling your music, how do they expect us to see something bad going on?&quot; Former Limp Bizkit manager Peter Katsis defended Durst in an interview for Netflix&#x27;s 2022 documentary on the festival, claiming that &quot;pointing the finger at Fred is about the last thing anybody should do. There really isn&#x27;t a way to control 300,000 people. The best thing he could do is put on the best show possible, and that&#x27;s what he did.&quot;. Their third album, &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot;, debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 1,054,511 copies in its first week of being released, with 400,000 of those copies being sold in the album&#x27;s first day of release making it the largest first-week sales debut for a rock album in the United States.

Crazy Town was met with more ire from metal purists than any other rap rock band due to looking more like a hip hop crew than a metal band. Crazy Town&#x27;s music and image reflected the band members&#x27; background in the underground hip hop scene in Los Angeles, anticipating nu metal. Their lyrics reflected &quot;one of the most dynamic and volatile sociocultural environments on the planet [...] where the urban squalor of the South Central district exists just minutes away from the glitz of Beverly Hills.&quot; Rapper KRS-One recorded a guest appearance for the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Gift of Game&quot;. Although Crazy Town were best known for having a rap metal sound, their biggest hit, &quot;Butterfly&quot;, was &quot;decidedly hip-hop&quot;. &quot;Butterfly&quot; would be the only Hot 100 hit by a rap rock act. According to &quot;Vulture&quot;, the 1990s were capped off by the short-lived late-90s sitcom &quot;Shasta McNasty&quot;, which encapsulated numerous 1990s trends in its depiction of a fictional rap rock band, brought the genre to primetime.

===Further developments (2000s to 2020s)===
The style of crunk developed by Lil Jon was categorized as a &quot;southern rap take on punk, which prioritised uncomfortably loud horns and repetitive screams.&quot; Linkin Park debuted in 2000 with their album &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; and would continue to be the most visible rap rock group of the 21st century, going as far as to collaborate with rapper Jay-Z on the 2004 release &quot;Collision Course&quot;. Subsequently, Kid Rock and Linkin Park&#x27;s styles changed, with Kid Rock having shifted to a country rock sound. Hollywood Undead was seen as a revival of the rap rock sound, although they considered themselves a rock band with hip hop influences, rather than a rap rock band. &quot;HotNewHipHop&quot; said that Kid Cudi blurred the lines between genres with his album &quot;Man on the Moon II&quot; (2010), which contained collaborations with indie rock artists St. Vincent and HAIM, and would deliver further into rock on his albums &quot;WZRD&quot; (2012) and &quot;Speedin&#x27; Bullet 2 Heaven&quot; (2015). The publication suggested that the negative reception to the latter two albums, as well as Lil Wayne&#x27;s &quot;Rebirth&quot; (2010), were &quot;glaring examples of the music media immediately shutting down Black artists for stepping outside of the confines of what is deemed as &#x27;Black music.&#x27;&quot; The publication also said that Lil Wayne&#x27;s use of autotune on the album and its &quot;raw rock attitude&quot; would prove &quot;to be highly influential on the next generation of rap rockstars.&quot; By 2011, the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; reported that rap rock &quot;seemed [...] dead&quot;. However, that year saw the release of several acclaimed rap rock projects, including &quot;Wugazi&quot;, a mashup mixtape in which raps by Wu-Tang Clan were paired with instrumentals by the band Fugazi, and the rap rock mixtape &quot;Exmilitary&quot; by the band Death Grips, which &quot;[coupled] contemporary avant-rock techniques with underground rap sonics&quot;; while some of the mixtape&#x27;s samples and influences were more mainstream, such as a sample of a David Bowie song, most of the mixtape&#x27;s samples came from American underground bands like Black Flag and Minutemen. Twenty One Pilots composed the rap rock songs &quot;Stressed Out&quot; and &quot;Heathens&quot;, which both peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 2016.

In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote, &quot;if, at some point, you made a name for yourself through combining rap and rock, chances are you either distance yourself vigorously from such efforts now or have learned to adjust to life as a walking joke.&quot; In 2018, conversely, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that &quot;rap-rock as we once knew it as dead&quot;, while &quot;HotNewHipHop&quot; said that the genre showed &quot;no signs of stopping&quot;. The late 2010s saw the emergence of female rap rock artists such as Princess Nokia, Rico Nasty and Bali Baby, diverging from the typically male-dominated rap rock acts of the past.

In 2020, &quot;NME&quot; writer Kyann-Sian Williams reported a resurgence in rap rock, which fans dubbed &quot;glock rock&quot; due to the unfavorable reputation of rap rock. Williams cited as representatives of glock rock, Lil Uzi Vert, a punk rock-influenced rapper who identified as a &quot;rockstar&quot; and cited Marilyn Manson as their all-time favorite musical artist, Machine Gun Kelly, a rapper influenced by emo and pop punk, City Morgue, a group that &quot;mixed thrash metal with pulsating 808s&quot;, as well as Trippie Redd, Post Malone, Clever and The Kid LAROI. Also emerging in this period was Oxymorrons, a rap rock group described as being &quot;too rock for hip-hop [and] too hip-hop for rock&quot;; &quot;Kerrang!&quot; writer Sophie K. described them as &quot;a talented rock band who are able to properly rap with authenticity as well, seamlessly switching between clean vocals, electronics, fuzzy guitars and angsty rap vocals&quot;. Rappers dominated the rock charts throughout 2020.

<text>Robert William Macaulay (May 25, 1921 – August 17, 2010) was a Canadian politician.

==Background==
Macaulay was born in Toronto in 1921 to Hazel and Leopold Macaulay. His father served as an MPP and a cabinet minister in the government of George Henry in the 1930s. He attended Upper Canada College before enlisting in the army during World War II where he served with the 48th Highlanders. After the war, he studied at the University of Toronto and graduated with a degree in law from Osgoode Hall. He was called to the bar in 1948 and worked in the field for over 50 years. He and his wife Joy raised two children.

==Politics==
Macaulay was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as the Progressive Conservative Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for the Toronto riding of Riverdale in the 1951 Ontario election. He was re-elected three times and served for 13 years.

In 1958, Premier of Ontario Leslie Frost appointed him to the cabinet as minister without portfolio with responsibilities in the Treasury Board. He was also appointed as a vice-chairman of Ontario Hydro. In 1959, he was promoted to the new position of Minister of Energy Resources.

When Frost retired, Macaulay ran to succeed him in the 1961 Progressive Conservative leadership convention finishing third on the fifth ballot. The victor, John Robarts, made Macaulay his Minister of Economics and Development. Macaulay retained his seat in the 1963 Ontario election, but he resigned from cabinet shortly afterwards citing health reasons. He remained in the legislature until May 1964 when he resigned his seat and returned to private life.

<doc id="1069376" wikidata="Q5473493" url="?curid=1069376" title="Fossil Mountain (Wyoming)">
<text>Fossil Mountain () is located in the Teton Range, within the Jedediah Smith Wilderness of Caribou-Targhee National Forest, U.S. state of Wyoming.

As mapped by J. D. Love and others, the peak of Fossil Mountain consists of relatively flat-lying beds of the Mississippian Madison Limestone and underlying Devonian Darby Formation. Underlying the Darby Formation and exposed in shear clifts and floors of glacially modified valleys are the Ordovician Bighorn Dolomite and Cambrian Gallatin Formation. In all, there is about of lower and middle Paleozoic sedimentary strata exposed within the area of Fossil Mountain.

The study of the sedimentary strata within the Teton Range, shows that these strata consist mostly of limestones and dolomites. The Madison Limestone consists of a basal, dark-colored, fine-grained dolomitic limestones overlain by hundreds of feet of gray limestone that is classified as fossiliferous oosparite and fossiliferous pelsparite. Abundant fossils of shells and corals, which are protected by federal laws, have been found in the Madison Limestone at Fossil Mountain. Underlying the Madison Limestone, the Darby Formation consists predominantly of dolomites and limestones that commonly contain discontinous layers of calcareous shale or sandstone.

==Fossil Mountain Ice Cave==
Fossil Mountain Ice Cave is a notable solutional cave in the Madison Limestone west of Fossil Mountain. This cave is also known as &quot;Darby Ice Cave&quot;, &quot;Darby Canyon Caves&quot;, or &quot;Wind Cave&quot;. This cave has about of passage. The underground distance between entrances is about of travel underground on the surface. It is noted for the presence of layered ice and sediments depoists up to thick.

Fossil Mountain Ice Cave has a combination of hazards that have resulted in frequent rescues. The safe exploration of this cave requires the participation of cavers with previous experience with this cave; expertise in ice and rock caving; specialized and appropriate caving equipment; and detailed planning and preparation, including the prepositioning of ropes, for a visit to this cave. Also, visiting this cave has detrimental effects on the preservation of scientifically significant ice deposits found within this cave. For example, visitor-induced melting of ice deposits was noted as early as 1975.

The analysis of measurements of stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen recovered form samples of ice collected from Fossil Mountain Ice Cave provided a record of paleotemperatures of this part of the Teton Range for the past 175 years. They showed a continuing increase in local temperatures over the past the past 160 years. In addition, two consecutive very cold years in the early 1870s were found.

<doc id="1069391" wikidata="Q5360711" url="?curid=1069391" title="Elie Martel">
<text>Elie Walter Martel (born November 26, 1934) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1967 to 1987, as a member of the New Democratic Party (NDP). He represented the Sudbury East electoral district from its inception in 1967 until he retired in 1987. During the late 1970s and into the 1980s, he was the Ontario NDP&#x27;s house leader. He was on the party&#x27;s labour left-wing and had conflicts with party leadership, including future premier Bob Rae. After he retired from politics, he served on the Ontario government&#x27;s Environmental Assessment Board as one of its vice chairs. His daughter Shelley Martel took over his Sudbury East seat and continued to serve the people of Sudbury when it became the Nickel Belt electoral district at the end of the 20th century. Between her and her father, the Martels represented Sudbury at Queen&#x27;s Park for 40 years. Prior to his political career, Martel was a teacher and principal in the Catholic school system in the Sudbury area.

==Personal life==
Martel was born in Capreol, Ontario, into a French speaking family and was educated at an English-speaking boarding school that forced him to stop speaking his family&#x27;s native language. He quit school three times to work on the railroad, and at Inco. He finally completed secondary school and then went to Laurentian University to major in history. After university, he went to North Bay Teacher&#x27;s College. He worked as a teacher and high school principal in the Sudbury area before entering politics.

His wife Gaye is the daughter of Norman Fawcett, who was Nickel Belt&#x27;s federal Member of Parliament from 1965 to 1968.

==Career in politics==

Martel was first elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1967 election, defeating Progressive Conservative candidate Cecil Fielding by 1,146 votes in the new Northern Ontario electoral district of Sudbury East. His victory happened the same year that the United Steelworkers absorbed INCO&#x27;s International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers union local 598, ending almost 20 years of very bitter political infighting between the unions and the CCF/NDP. The infighting ousted former CCF MPP, Bob Carlin because the party feared the Sudbury riding association was controlled by communists in the Mine, Mill union. Only after the Steelworkers&#x27; prolonged takeover of Mine, Mill, did the NDP finally have unity between its warring factions, thereby allowing Martel to win the seat. 

He was on the left-wing of the New Democratic Party, and was strongly supported by its trade-union base. In 1974, Martel supported the striking uranium miners at Elliot Lake who were demanding improved safety and support from employers. Along with other NDP legislators from the Sudbury area, he frequently called for the area&#x27;s Falconbridge Ltd. and Inco&#x27;s nickel mines to be nationalized.

Early in his career, Martel pressed then education minister, Bill Davis to support full funding for Catholic high schools in late 1968. As premier, Davis, in mid-June 1984, decided to fund public separate high schools, reversing his previous position going back to when Martel first brought it up in the 1960s. 

Martel was re-elected by comfortable margins in the elections of 1971, 1975, 1977, 1981 and 1985, and served as an opposition member for his entire legislative career. Martel was House Leader of the NDP for seven years, from 1978 to 1985. He stepped down from that position after being left-off the NDP&#x27;s negotiating team that eventually brokered the accord between the Liberals and the NDP to form a stable minority government in May 1985. NDP leader Bob Rae thought that Martel was &quot;too much of a lone wolf,&quot; to negotiate the deal.

Martel encouraged Bob Rae to seek the provincial NDP leadership in 1981, but began developing his own organization when Rae delayed his entry. He eventually withdrew from the contest to support Rae&#x27;s candidacy, but his personal and professional relationship with Rae deteriorated when the campaign was over. By some accounts, the two men strongly disliked one another on a personal level.

==Retirement==

Martel stood down as a Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) in 1987, and was succeeded in Sudbury East by his daughter Shelley Martel after a bitter battle for the riding&#x27;s NDP nomination between her and Rev. William Major. Shortly after his retirement, Martel was named vice-chair of the Environmental Assessment Board by Liberal Premier of Ontario David Peterson.

Nearly a decade after he retired from the Ontario Legislature, he ran as a candidate for the federal New Democratic Party in the 1997 federal election. He finished second to Liberal incumbent Ray Bonin the in Nickel Belt electoral district.

The NDP won the 1990 Ontario general election and formed their first majority government. Shelley Martel was subsequently named as minister for Northern Development and government house leader. In 1998, Sudbury East was dissolved and merged into the provincial Nickel Belt electoral district for the 1999 provincial election. Shelley Martel continued to represent that constituency provincially until her retirement in 2007, ending the family&#x27;s forty-year run of representing the greater Sudbury area. She is married to Howard Hampton, former leader of the Ontario New Democrats.

<text>The [[Kingdom of France]] in the early modern period, from the Renaissance () to the Revolution (1789–1804), was a monarchy ruled by the House of Bourbon (a Capetian cadet branch). This corresponds to the so-called &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; (&quot;old rule&quot;). The territory of France during this period increased until it included essentially the extent of the modern country, and it also included the territories of the first French colonial empire overseas.

The period is dominated by the figure of the &quot;Sun King&quot;, Louis XIV (his reign of 1643–1715 being one of the longest in history), who managed to eliminate the remnants of medieval feudalism and established a centralized state under an absolute monarch, a system that would endure until the French Revolution and beyond.

== Geography ==

In the mid 15th century, France was significantly smaller than it is today, and numerous border provinces (such as Roussillon, Cerdagne, Calais, Béarn, Navarre, County of Foix, Flanders, Artois, Lorraine, Alsace, Trois-Évêchés, Franche-Comté, Savoy, Bresse, Bugey, Gex, Nice, Provence, Corsica and Brittany) were autonomous or foreign-held (as by the Kingdom of England); there were also foreign enclaves, like the Comtat Venaissin. In addition, certain provinces within France were ostensibly personal fiefdoms of noble families (like the Bourbonnais, Marche, Forez and Auvergne provinces held by the House of Bourbon until the provinces were forcibly integrated into the royal domaine in 1527 after the fall of Charles III, Duke of Bourbon).

The late 15th, 16th and 17th centuries would see France undergo a massive territorial expansion and an attempt to better integrate its provinces into an administrative whole. During this period, France expanded to nearly its modern territorial extent through the acquisition of Picardy, Burgundy, Anjou, Maine, Provence, Brittany, Franche-Comté, French Flanders, Navarre, Roussillon, the Duchy of Lorraine, Alsace and Corsica.
French acquisitions from 1461 to 1789:
* Under Louis XI – Provence (1482), Dauphiné (1461, under French control since 1349)
* Under Henry II – Calais, Trois-Évêchés (1552)
* Under Henry IV – County of Foix (1607)
* Under Louis XIII – Béarn and Navarre (1620, under French control since 1589 as part of Henry IV&#x27;s possessions)
* Under Louis XIV
** Treaty of Westphalia (1648) – Alsace
** Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) – Artois, Northern Catalonia (Roussillon, Cerdagne)
** Treaty of Nijmegen (1678–79) – Franche-Comté, Flanders
* Under Louis XV – Lorraine (1766), Corsica (1768)

Only the Duchy of Savoy, the city of Nice and some other small papal (e.g., Avignon) and foreign possessions would be acquired later. (For a map of historic French provinces, see Provinces of France). France also embarked on exploration, colonisation, and mercantile exchanges with the Americas (New France, Louisiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Haiti, French Guiana), India (Pondicherry), the Indian Ocean (Réunion), the Far East, and a few African trading posts.

Although Paris was the capital of France, the later Valois kings largely abandoned the city as their primary residence, preferring instead various châteaux of the Loire Valley and Parisian countryside. Henry IV made Paris his primary residence (promoting a major building boom in private mansions), but Louis XIV once again withdrew from the city in the last decades of his reign and Versailles became the primary seat of the French monarchy for much of the following century.

The administrative and legal system in France in this period is generally called the Ancien Régime.

== Demography ==

The Black Death had killed an estimated one-third of the population of France from its appearance in 1348. The concurrent Hundred Years&#x27; War slowed recovery. It would be the early 16th century before the population recovered to mid-14th-century levels.

With an estimated population of 11 million in 1400, 20 million in the 17th century, and 28 million in 1789, until 1795 France was the most populated country in Europe (even twice the size of Britain or the Dutch Republic) and the third most populous country in the world, behind only China and India.

These demographic changes also led to a massive increase in urban populations, although on the whole France remained a profoundly rural country. Paris was one of the most populated cities in Europe (estimated at 400,000 inhabitants in 1550; 650,000 at the end of the 18th century). Other major French cities include Lyon, Rouen, Bordeaux, Toulouse, and Marseille.

These centuries saw several periods of epidemics and crop failures due to wars and climatic change. (Historians speak of the period 1550–1850 as the &quot;Little Ice Age&quot;.) Between 1693 and 1694, France lost 6% of its population. In the extremely harsh winter of 1709, France lost 3.5% of its population. In the past 300 years, no period has been so proportionally deadly for the French, both World Wars included.

== Language ==

Linguistically, the differences in France were extreme. Before the Renaissance, the language spoken in the north of France was a collection of different dialects called Oïl languages whereas the written and administrative language remained Latin. By the 16th century, there had developed a standardised form of French (called Middle French) which would be the basis of the standardised &quot;modern&quot; French of the 17th and 18th century which in turn became the lingua franca of the European continent. (In 1539, with the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, Francis I of France made French alone the language for legal and juridical acts.) Nevertheless, in 1790, only half of the population spoke or understood standard French.

The southern half of the country continued to speak Occitan languages (such as Provençal), and other inhabitants spoke Breton, Catalan, Basque, Dutch (West Flemish), and Franco-Provençal. In the north of France, regional dialects of the various langues d&#x27;oïl continued to be spoken in rural communities. During the French revolution, the teaching of French was promoted in all the schools. The French used would be that of the legal system, which differed from the French spoken in the courts of France before the revolution. Like the orators during the French revolution, the pronunciation of every syllable would become the new language.

France would not become a linguistically unified country until the end of the 19th century.

== Administrative structures ==

The Ancien Régime, the French term rendered in English as &quot;Old Rule&quot;, &quot;Old Kingdom&quot;, or simply &quot;Old Regime&quot;, refers primarily to the aristocratic, social and political system established in France from (roughly) the 15th century to the 18th century under the late Valois and Bourbon dynasties. The administrative and social structures of the Ancien Régime were the result of years of state-building, legislative acts (like the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts), internal conflicts and civil wars, but they remained a confusing patchwork of local privilege and historic differences until the French Revolution took place in a radical time suppression of administrative incoherence.

=== Background ===
The Peace of Etaples (1492) marks, for some, the beginning of the early modern period in France.

After the Hundred Years&#x27; War (1337–1453), France supported the Lancastrian side in The Wars of the Roses. France and England signed the Treaty of Picquigny in 1475 — the official end date of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. In 1492 and 1493, after supporting the victorious House of Tudor in the Battle of Bosworth Field, Charles VIII of France signed three additional treaties with Henry VII of England, Maximilian I of Habsburg, and Ferdinand II of Aragon respectively at Étaples (1492), Senlis (1493) and in Barcelona (1493). As the 15th century drew to a close, French kings could take confidence in the fact that England had been mostly driven from their territory and so they could now embark on an expansionist foreign policy. The invasion of Italy by Charles VIII in 1494 began 62 years of war with the Habsburgs (the Italian Wars).

=== Foreign relations ===
=== Wars ===
Despite the beginnings of rapid demographic and economic recovery after the Black Death of the 14th century, the gains of the previous half-century were to be jeopardised by a further protracted series of conflicts, the Italian Wars (1494–1559), where French efforts to gain dominance ended in the increased power of the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperors of Germany.

In 1445, the first steps were made towards fashioning a regular army out of the poorly disciplined mercenary bands that French kings traditionally relied on. The medieval division of society into &quot;those who fought (nobility), those who prayed (clergy), and those who worked (everyone else)&quot; still held strong and warfare was considered a domain of the nobles. Charles VIII marched into Italy with a core force consisting of noble horsemen and non-noble foot soldiers, but in time the role of the latter grew stronger so that by the middle of the 16th century, France had a standing army of 5000 cavalry and 30,000 infantry. The military was reorganized from a system of legions recruited by province (Norman legion, Gascon legion, etc.) to regiments, an arrangement which persisted into the next century. However, the nobility and troops were often disloyal to the king, if not outright rebellious, and it took another army reform by Louis XIV to finally transform the French army into an obedient force.

Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan, seeking an ally against the Republic of Venice, encouraged Charles VIII of France to invade Italy, using the Angevin claim to the throne of Naples, then under Aragonese control, as a pretext. When Ferdinand I of Naples died in 1494, Charles invaded the peninsula. For several months, French forces moved through Italy virtually unopposed, since the &quot;condottieri&quot; armies of the Italian city-states were unable to resist them. Their sack of Naples finally provoked a reaction, however, and the League of Venice was formed against them. Italian troops defeated the French at the Battle of Fornovo, forcing Charles to withdraw to France. Ludovico, having betrayed the French at Fornovo, retained his throne until 1499, when Charles&#x27;s successor, Louis XII of France, invaded Lombardy and seized Milan.

In 1500, Louis XII, having reached an agreement with Ferdinand II of Aragon to divide Naples, marched south from Milan. By 1502, combined French and Aragonese forces had seized control of the Kingdom; disagreements about the terms of the partition led to a war between Louis and Ferdinand. By 1503, Louis, having been defeated at the Battle of Cerignola and Battle of Garigliano, was forced to withdraw from Naples, which was left under the control of the Spanish viceroy, Ramón de Cardona. French forces under Gaston de Foix inflicted an overwhelming defeat on a Spanish army at the Battle of Ravenna in 1512, but Foix was killed during the battle, and the French were forced to withdraw from Italy by an invasion of Milan by the Swiss, who reinstated Maximilian Sforza to the ducal throne. The Holy League, left victorious, fell apart over the subject of dividing the spoils, and in 1513 Venice allied with France, agreeing to partition Lombardy between them.
Louis mounted another invasion of Milan, but was defeated at the Battle of Novara, which was quickly followed by a series of Holy League victories at La Motta, Guinegate, and Flodden, in which the French, Venetian, and Scottish forces were decisively defeated. However, the death of Pope Julius left the League without effective leadership, and when Louis&#x27; successor, Francis I, defeated the Swiss at Marignano in 1515, the League collapsed, and by the treaties of Noyon and Brussels, surrendered to France and Venice the entirety of northern Italy.

The elevation of Charles of Spain to Holy Roman Emperor, a position that Francis had desired, led to a collapse of relations between France and the Habsburgs. In 1519, a Spanish invasion of Navarre, nominally a French fief, provided Francis with a pretext for starting a general war; French forces flooded into Italy and began a campaign to drive Charles from Naples. The French were outmatched, however, by the fully developed Spanish tercio tactics, and suffered a series of crippling defeats at Bicocca and Sesia against Spanish troops under Fernando d&#x27;Avalos. With Milan itself threatened, Francis personally led a French army into Lombardy in 1525, only to be defeated and captured at the Battle of Pavia; imprisoned in Madrid, Francis was forced to agree to extensive concessions over his Italian territories in the &quot;Treaty of Madrid&quot; (1526).
The inconclusive third war between Charles and Francis began with the death of Francesco II Sforza, the duke of Milan. When Charles&#x27; son Philip inherited the duchy, Francis invaded Italy, capturing Turin, but failed to take Milan. In response, Charles invaded Provence, advancing to Aix-en-Provence, but withdrew to Spain rather than attacking the heavily fortified Avignon. The Truce of Nice ended the war, leaving Turin in French hands but effecting no significant change in the map of Italy. Francis, allying himself with Suleiman I of the Ottoman Empire, launched a final invasion of Italy. A Franco-Ottoman fleet captured the city of Nice in August 1543, and laid siege to the citadel. The defenders were relieved within a month. The French, under François, Count d&#x27;Enghien, defeated an Imperial army at the Battle of Ceresole in 1544, but the French failed to penetrate further into Lombardy. Charles and Henry VIII of England then proceeded to invade northern France, seizing Boulogne and Soissons. A lack of cooperation between the Spanish and English armies, coupled with increasingly aggressive Ottoman attacks, led Charles to abandon these conquests, restoring the status quo once again.

In 1547, Henry II of France, who had succeeded Francis to the throne, declared war against Charles with the intent of recapturing Italy and ensuring French, rather than Habsburg, domination of European affairs. An early offensive against Lorraine was successful, but the attempted French invasion of Tuscany in 1553 was defeated at the Battle of Marciano. Charles&#x27;s abdication in 1556 split the Habsburg empire between Philip II of Spain and Ferdinand I, and shifted the focus of the war to Flanders, where Philip, in conjunction with Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, defeated the French at St. Quentin. England&#x27;s entry into the war later that year led to the French capture of Calais, England&#x27;s last possession on the French mainland, and French armies plundered Spanish possessions in the Low Countries; but Henry was nonetheless forced to accept the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis, in which he renounced any further claims to Italy.

=== The Wars of Religion ===
Barely were the Italian Wars over, when France was plunged into a domestic crisis with far-reaching consequences. Despite the conclusion of a Concordat between France and the Papacy (1516), granting the crown unrivalled power in senior ecclesiastical appointments, France was deeply affected by the Protestant Reformation&#x27;s attempt to break the unity of Roman Catholic Europe. A growing urban-based Protestant minority (later dubbed &quot;Huguenots&quot;) faced ever harsher repression under the rule of Francis I&#x27;s son King Henry II. After Henry II&#x27;s unfortunate death in a joust, the country was ruled by his widow Catherine de&#x27; Medici and her sons Francis II, Charles IX and Henry III. Renewed Catholic reaction headed by the powerful dukes of Guise culminated in a massacre of Huguenots (1562), starting the first of the French Wars of Religion, during which English, German, and Spanish forces intervened on the side of rival Protestant and Catholic forces. Opposed to absolute monarchy, the Huguenots Monarchomachs theorized during this time the right of rebellion and the legitimacy of tyrannicide.

The Wars of Religion culminated in the War of the Three Henrys in which Henry III assassinated Henry de Guise, leader of the Spanish-backed Catholic league, and the king was murdered in return. After the assassination of both Henry of Guise (1588) and Henry III (1589), the conflict was ended by the accession of the Protestant king of Navarre as Henry IV (first king of the Bourbon dynasty) and his subsequent abandonment of Protestantism (Expedient of 1592) effective in 1593, his acceptance by most of the Catholic establishment (1594) and by the Pope (1595), and his issue of the toleration decree known as the Edict of Nantes (1598), which guaranteed freedom of private worship and civil equality.

=== France in the 17th and 18th centuries ===
France&#x27;s pacification under Henry IV laid much of the ground for the beginnings of France&#x27;s rise to European hegemony. One of the most admired French kings, Henry was fatally stabbed by a Catholic fanatic in 1610 as war with Spain threatened. Troubles gradually developed during the regency headed by his queen Marie de Medici. France was expansive during all but the end of the 17th century: the French began trading in India and Madagascar, founded Quebec and penetrated the North American Great Lakes and Mississippi, established plantation economies in the West Indies and extended their trade contacts in the Levant and enlarged their merchant marine.

Henry IV&#x27;s son Louis XIII and his minister (1624–1642) Cardinal Richelieu, elaborated a policy against Spain and the German emperor during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) which had broken out among the lands of Germany&#x27;s Holy Roman Empire. An English-backed Huguenot rebellion (1625–1628) defeated, France intervened directly (1635) in the wider European conflict following her ally (Protestant) Sweden&#x27;s failure to build upon initial success.

After the death of both king and cardinal, the Peace of Westphalia (1648) secured universal acceptance of Germany&#x27;s political and religious fragmentation, but the Regency of Anne of Austria and her minister Cardinal Mazarin experienced a civil uprising known as the Fronde (1648–1653) which expanded into a Franco-Spanish War (1653–1659). The Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) formalised France&#x27;s seizure (1642) of the Spanish territory of Roussillon after the crushing of the ephemeral Catalan Republic and ushered a short period of peace.

For most of the reign of Louis XIV (1643–1715), France was the dominant power in Europe, aided by the diplomacy of Richelieu&#x27;s successor (1642–1661) Cardinal Mazarin and the economic policies (1661–1683) of Colbert. Colbert&#x27;s attempts to promote economic growth and the creation of new industries were not a great success, and France did not undergo any sort of industrial revolution during Louis XIV&#x27;s reign. Indeed, much of the French countryside during this period remained poor and overpopulated. The resistance of peasants to adopt the potato, according to some monarchist apologists, and other new agricultural innovations while continuing to rely on cereal crops led to repeated catastrophic famines long after they had ceased in the rest of Western Europe. Prior to Louis XIV&#x27;s reign, French soldiers frequently went into battle barefoot and with no weapons. On the other hand, France&#x27;s high birthrate until the 18th century proved beneficial to its rulers since it meant the country could field larger armies than its neighbors. In fact, the king&#x27;s foreign policy, as well as his lavish court and construction projects, left the country in enormous debt. The Palace of Versailles was criticized as overly extravagant even while it was still under construction, but dozens of imitations were built across Europe. Renewed war (the War of Devolution 1667–1668 and the Franco-Dutch War 1672–1678) brought further territorial gains (Artois and western Flanders and the free county of Burgundy, left to the Empire in 1482), but at the cost of the increasingly concerted opposition of rival powers.
French culture was part of French hegemony. In the early part of the century French painters had to go to Rome to shed their provinciality (Nicolas Poussin, Claude Lorrain), but Simon Vouet brought home the taste for a classicized baroque that would characterise the French Baroque, epitomised in the Académie de peinture et de sculpture, in the painting of Charles Le Brun and the sculpture of François Girardon. With the Palais du Luxembourg, the Château de Maisons and Vaux-le-Vicomte, French classical architecture was admired abroad even before the creation of Versailles or Perrault&#x27;s Louvre colonnade. Parisian salon culture set standards of discriminating taste from the 1630s, and with Pascal, Descartes, Bayle, Corneille, Racine and Molière, France became the cultural center of Europe. In an effort to prevent the nobility from revolting and challenging his authority, Louis implemented an extremely elaborate system of court etiquette with the idea that learning it would occupy most of the nobles&#x27; time and they could not plan rebellion. By the start of the 18th century, the nobility in France had been effectively neutered and would never again have more power than the crown. Also, Louis willingly granted titles of nobility to those who had performed distinguished service to the state so that it did not become a closed caste and it was possible for commoners to rise through the social ranks. The king sought to impose total religious uniformity on the country, repealing the Edict of Nantes in 1685. The infamous practice of dragonnades was adopted, whereby rough soldiers were quartered in the homes of Protestant families and allowed to have their way with them. Scores of Protestants fled France, costing the country a great many intellectuals, artisans, and other valuable people. Persecution extended to unorthodox Catholics like the Jansenists, a group that denied free will and had already been condemned by the popes. Louis was no theologian and understood little of the complex doctrines of Jansenism, satisfying himself with the fact that they threatened the unity of the state. In this, he garnered the friendship of the papacy, which had previously been hostile to France because of its policy of putting all church property in the country under the jurisdiction of the state rather than of Rome.

Cardinal Mazarin oversaw the creation of a French navy that rivaled England&#x27;s, expanding it from 25 ships to almost 200. The size of the army was also considerably increased.

Starting in the 1670s, Louis XIV established the so-called Chambers of Reunion, courts in which judges would determine whether certain Habsburg territories belonged rightfully to France. The king was relying on the somewhat vague wording in the Treaty of Westphalia, while also dredging up older French claims, some dating back to medieval times. Through this, he concluded that the strategically important imperial city of Strassburg should have gone to France in 1648. In September 1681, French troops occupied the city, which was at once strongly fortified. As the imperial armies were then busy fighting the Ottoman Empire, they could not do anything about this for a number of years. The basic aim of Louis&#x27; foreign policy was to give France more easily defensible borders, and to eliminate weak spots (Strassburg had often been used by the Habsburgs as a gateway into France).
Following the Whig establishment on the English and Scottish thrones by the Dutch prince William of Orange in 1688, the anti-French &quot;Grand Alliance&quot; of 1689 was established. With the Turks now in retreat, the emperor Leopold could turn his attention to France. The ensuing War of the Grand Alliance lasted from 1688 to 1697. France&#x27;s resources were stretched to the breaking point by the cost of fielding an army of over 300,000 men and two naval squadrons. Famine in 1692–1693 killed up to two million people. The exhaustion of the powers brought the fighting to an end in 1697, by which time the French were in control of the Spanish Netherlands and Catalonia. However, Louis gave back his conquests and gained only Haiti. The French people, feeling that their sacrifices in the war had been for nothing, never forgave him.

The Battle of La Hougue (1692) was the decisive naval battle in the war and confirmed the durable dominance of the Royal Navy of England.

In November 1700, the severely ill Spanish king Charles II died, ending the Habsburg line in that country. Louis had long waited for this moment, and now planned to put a Bourbon relative, Philip, Duke of Anjou, on the throne. Essentially, Spain was to become an obedient satellite of France, ruled by a king who would carry out orders from Versailles. Realizing how this would upset the balance of power, the other European rulers were outraged. However, most of the alternatives were equally undesirable. For example, putting another Habsburg on the throne would end up recreating the empire of Charles V, which would also grossly upset the power balance. After nine years of exhausting war, the last thing Louis wanted was another conflict. However, the rest of Europe would not stand for his ambitions in Spain, and so the War of the Spanish Succession began, a mere three years after the War of the Grand Alliance.

The disasters of the war (accompanied by another famine) were so great that France was on the verge of collapse by 1709. In desperation, the king appealed to the French people to save their country, and in doing so gained thousands of new army recruits. Afterwards, his general Marshal Villars managed to drive back the allied forces. In 1714, the war ended with the treaties of Utrecht and Rastadt. France did not lose any territory, and there was no discussion of returning Flanders or Alsace to the Habsburgs. While the Duke of Anjou was accepted as King Philip V of Spain, this was done under the condition that the French and Spanish thrones never be united. Finally, France agreed to stop supporting Jacobite pretenders to the English throne. Just after the war ended, Louis died, having ruled France for 72 years.

While often considered a tyrant and a warmonger (especially in England), Louis XIV was not in any way a despot in the 20th-century sense. The traditional customs and institutions of France limited his power and in any case, communications were poor and no national police force existed.

Overall, the discontent and revolts of 16th- and 17th-century France did not approach the conditions that led to 1789. Events such as the Frondes were a naïve, unrevolutionary discontent and the people did not challenge the right of the king to govern nor did they question the Church.

The reign (1715–1774) of Louis XV saw an initial return to peace and prosperity under the regency (1715–1723) of Philip II, Duke of Orléans, whose policies were largely continued (1726–1743) by Cardinal Fleury, prime minister in all but name. The exhaustion of Europe after two major wars resulted in a long period of peace, only interrupted by minor conflicts like the War of the Polish Succession from 1733 to 1735. Large-scale warfare resumed with the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748). But alliance with the traditional Habsburg enemy (the &quot;Diplomatic Revolution&quot; of 1756) against the rising power of Britain and Prussia led to costly failure in the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763) and the loss of France&#x27;s North American colonies.
On the whole, the 18th century saw growing discontent with the monarchy and the established order. Louis XV was a highly unpopular king for his sexual excesses, overall weakness, and for losing Canada to the British. A strong ruler like Louis XIV could enhance the position of the monarchy, while Louis XV weakened it. The writings of the philosophers such as Voltaire were a clear sign of discontent, but the king chose to ignore them. He died of smallpox in 1774, and the French people shed few tears at his passing. While France had not yet experienced the industrial revolution that was beginning in England, the rising middle class of the cities felt increasingly frustrated with a system and rulers that seemed silly, frivolous, aloof, and antiquated, even if true feudalism no longer existed in France.

Anti-establishment ideas fermented in 18th-century France in part due to the country&#x27;s relative egalitarianism. While less liberal than England during the same period, the French monarchy never approached the absolutism of the eastern rulers in Vienna, Berlin, St. Petersburg, and Constantinople in part because the country&#x27;s traditional development as a decentralized, feudal society acted as a restraint on the power of the king. Different social classes in France each had their own unique set of privileges so that no one class could completely dominate the others.

Upon Louis XV&#x27;s death, his grandson Louis XVI became king. Initially popular, he too came to be widely detested by the 1780s. Again a weak ruler, he was married to an Austrian archduchess, Marie Antoinette, whose naïvety and cloistered/alienated Versailles life permitted ignorance of the true extravagance and wasteful use of borrowed money (Marie Antoinette was significantly more frugal than her predecessors). French intervention in the US War of Independence was also very expensive.

With the country deeply in debt, Louis XVI permitted the radical reforms of Turgot and Malesherbes, but noble disaffection led to Turgot&#x27;s dismissal and Malesherbes&#x27; resignation in 1776. They were replaced by Jacques Necker. Necker had resigned in 1781 to be replaced by Calonne and Brienne, before being restored in 1788. A harsh winter that year led to widespread food shortages, and by then France was a powder keg ready to explode.

On the eve of the French Revolution of 1789, France was in a profound institutional and financial crisis, but the ideas of the Enlightenment had begun to permeate the educated classes of society.

On 1792 September 21 the French monarchy was effectively abolished by the proclamation of the French First Republic.

== Social history ==
France in the Ancien Régime covered a territory of around , and supported 22 million people in 1700. At least 96% of the population were peasants. France had the largest population in Europe, with European Russia second at 20 million. Britain had nearly six million, Spain had eight million, and the Austrian Habsburgs had around eight million. France&#x27;s lead slowly faded after 1700, as other countries grew faster.

=== Rural society ===
In the 17th century rich peasants who had ties to the market economy provided much of the capital investment necessary for agricultural growth, and frequently moved from village to village (or town). Geographic mobility, directly tied to the market and the need for investment capital, was the main path to social mobility. The &quot;stable&quot; core of French society, town guilds people and village laboureurs, included cases of staggering social and geographic continuity, but even this core required regular renewal. Accepting the existence of these two societies, the constant tension between them, and extensive geographic and social mobility tied to a market economy holds the key to a clearer understanding of the evolution of the social structure, economy, and even political system of early modern France. Collins (1991) argues that the Annales School paradigm underestimated the role of the market economy; failed to explain the nature of capital investment in the rural economy; and grossly exaggerated social stability.

=== Women and families ===
Very few women held any power—some queens did, as did the heads of Catholic convents. In the Enlightenment, the writings of philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau gave a political program for reform of the Ancien Régime, founded on a reform of domestic mores. Rousseau&#x27;s conception of the relations between private and public spheres is more unified than that found in modern sociology. Rousseau argued that the domestic role of women is a structural precondition for a &quot;modern&quot; society. Within early modern society, women of urban artisanal classes participated in a range of public activities and also shared work settings with men (even though they were generally disadvantaged in terms of tasks, wages and access to property.)
Salic law prohibited women from rule; however, the laws for the case of a regency, when the king was too young to govern by himself, brought the queen into the center of power. The queen could assure the passage of power from one king to another—from her late husband to her young son—while simultaneously assuring the continuity of the dynasty.

==== Education for girls ====
Educational aspirations were on the rise and were becoming increasingly institutionalized in order to supply the church and state with the functionaries to serve as their future administrators. Girls were schooled too, but not to assume political responsibility. Girls were ineligible for leadership positions and were generally considered to have an inferior intellect to their brothers. France had many small local schools where working-class children—both boys and girls—learned to read, the better &quot;to know, love and serve God&quot;. The sons and daughters of the noble and bourgeois elites, however, were given quite distinct educations: boys were sent to upper school, perhaps a university, while their sisters (if they were lucky enough to leave the house) were sent for finishing at a convent. The Enlightenment challenged this model, but no real alternative presented itself for female education. Only through education at home were knowledgeable women formed, usually to the sole end of dazzling their salons.

==== Stepfamilies ====
A large proportion of children lived in broken homes or in blended families and had to cope with the presence of half-siblings and stepsiblings in the same residence. Brothers and sisters were often separated during the guardianship period and some of them were raised in different places for most of their childhood. Half-siblings and stepsiblings lived together for rather short periods of time because of their difference in age, their birth rank, or their gender. The lives of the children were closely linked to the administration of their heritage: when both their mothers and fathers were dead, another relative took charge of the guardianship and often removed the children from a stepparent&#x27;s home, thus separating half-siblings.

The experience of step-motherhood was surrounded by negative stereotypes; the Cinderella story and many other jokes and stories made the second wife an object of ridicule. Language, theater, popular sayings, the position of the Church, and the writings of jurists all made stepmother a difficult identity to take up. However, the importance of male remarriage suggests that reconstitution of family units was a necessity and that individuals resisted negative perceptions circulating through their communities. Widowers did not hesitate to take a second wife, and they usually found quite soon a partner willing to become a stepmother. For these women, being a stepmother was not necessarily the experience of a lifetime or what defined their identity. Their experience depended greatly on factors such as the length of the union, changing family configuration, and financial dispositions taken by their husbands.

By a policy adopted at the beginning of the 16th century, adulterous women during the ancien régime were sentenced to a lifetime in a convent unless pardoned by their husbands and were rarely allowed to remarry even if widowed.

== Religion ==

Prior to the French Revolution, the Catholic Church was the official state religion of the Kingdom of France. France was traditionally considered the Church&#x27;s eldest daughter (French: &quot;Fille aînée de l&#x27;Église&quot;), and the King of France always maintained close links to the Pope. However, the French monarchy maintained a significant degree of autonomy, namely through its policy of &quot;Gallicanism&quot;, whereby the king selected bishops rather than the papacy.

During the Protestant Reformation of the mid 16th century, France developed a large and influential Protestant population, primarily of Reformed confession; after French theologian and pastor John Calvin introduced the Reformation in France, the number of French Protestants (Huguenots) steadily swelled to 10 percent of the population, or roughly 1.8 million people. The ensuring French Wars of Religion, and particularly the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre, decimated the Huguenot community; Protestants declined to seven to eight percent of the kingdom&#x27;s population by the end of the 16th century. The Edict of Nantes brought decades of respite until its revocation in the late 17th century by Louis XIV. The resulting exodus of Huguenots from the Kingdom of France created a brain drain, as many of them had occupied important places in society.

<text>Waitara is a town in the northern part of the Taranaki region of the North Island of New Zealand. Waitara is located just off State Highway 3, northeast of New Plymouth.

Waitara was the site of the outbreak of the Taranaki Wars in 1860 following the attempted purchase of land for British settlers from its Māori owners. Disputes over land that was subsequently confiscated by the Government continue to this day.
There are several different stories regarding the origin of the name &quot;Waitara&quot;. One is that it was originally &quot;Whai-tara&quot; – &quot;path of the dart&quot; – so named because Whare Matangi followed the path of a dart to find his father Ngarue. Another is that Turi named it from his wide stride when crossing the water of the river. Another is that Turi named it &quot;Waitarangia&quot; because the coldness of the water affected his skin. Yet another is that it means &quot;mountain stream&quot;. In 1867 the settlement was named Raleigh, after Sir Walter Raleigh. It reverted to its former name with the establishment of the borough of Waitara in 1904.

==History and culture==

===Early history===

Prior to European colonisation, Waitara lay on the main overland route between the Waikato and Taranaki districts. Vestiges of numerous pā on all strategic heights in the district indicate close settlement and closely contested possession, just before and in early European times, by various tribes. Whalers and sealers, who had come from the northern hemisphere, gained help from and formed relationships with local Māori in the early 19th-century, but the area was largely vacated in the 1820s and 1830s following warfare between the resident Te Āti Awa iwi (tribe) and those of iwi from north Auckland down to the Waikato. Some Te Āti Awa were taken to Waikato as prisoners and slaves, but most migrated to the Cook Strait area in pursuit of guns and goods from whalers and traders.

Pākehā settlers who came to New Plymouth (founded in 1841) in the 1840s and 1850s viewed nearby Waitara as the most valuable of Taranaki&#x27;s coastal lands because of its fertile soil and superior harbour. The New Zealand Company drew up plans for settlement from New Plymouth to beyond Waitara, and sold blocks to immigrants despite a lack of proof that the company&#x27;s initial purchase of the land had been legitimate. The company claimed that Te Āti Awa had either abandoned the land or lost possession of it, owing to conquest by Waikato Māori. (The Land Claims Commission later upheld this view, but subsequently Governor Robert FitzRoy (in office 1843–1845) rejected it, as did the Waitangi Tribunal in 1996.)

===First Taranaki War===

Tensions between settlers and local Māori began as early as July 1842, when settlers who had taken up land north of the Waitara River were driven from their farms. A year later 100 men, women and children sat in a surveyors&#x27; path to disrupt the surveying of land for sale.

Between March and November 1848 Wiremu Kīngi Te Rangitāke, a Te Āti Awa chief who staunchly opposed the sale of land in the Waitara area, returned to the district from Waikanae with almost 600 men, women and children and some livestock to retake possession of the land. They established substantial cultivations of wheat, oats, maize and potatoes, selling it to settlers and also for export; his followers also laboured on settler farms. The Waitangi Tribunal noted that the group allegedly eventually owned 150 horses and up to 300 head of cattle.

Despite Kingi&#x27;s opposition however, payments were made by government agents secretly to Maori individuals for prospective sales of land in the Waitara area, prompting spates of violence between those supporting and opposing land sales.

In 1857 the issue came to a head with the offer for sale of land at Waitara and at Turangi, further to the north, by two individuals, Īhāia Te Kirikūmara and a minor chief, Pokikake Te Teira. Teira&#x27;s 600-acre (240 hectare) Waitara block, located on the west side of the Waitara River and known as the Pekapeka block, became the focal point of a dispute between the colonial government (chiefly representing settlers) and Māori over the right of individuals to sell land that Māori custom regarded as owned by the community. The dispute ultimately led to the outbreak of war in Waitara on 17 March 1860, when 500 troops began a bombardment of Kingi&#x27;s Te Kohia pā, which had been built two days&#x27; prior. By the end of March, of the four kāinga in the Pekapeka block (Te Whanga, Kuikui, Hurirapa and Wherohia), only Hurirapa, the community led by Ihaia and Teira, remained. Imperial troops established Camp Waitara to the south of the Pekapeka block, at the former location of Pukekohe pā, which became the base of the 40th Regiment, and was one of the largest redoubts in the country. The war, in which 2,300 Imperial troops fought about 1,400 Māori, ran for 12 months before a ceasefire was negotiated.

Later campaigns during the war included the major British defeat in the Battle of Puketakauere, close to Te Kohia pā, on 27 June 1860 which cost the lives of 32 Imperial troops and of five Māori. A major British sapping operation at the strongly defended Te Arei pā up the Waitara River began in February 1861, but was abandoned when a ceasefire was effected the following month. As a result of this operation, Colour Sergeant John Lucas was awarded the Victoria Cross.

===Second Taranaki War===

In May 1863 war resumed in Taranaki. The government immediately renounced the earlier Waitara purchase, abandoning all claims to it, and instead created a plan for the confiscation of greater tracts of land under new laws, supposedly as a reprisal for the Oakura killings. In 1865 the Pekapeka block that had been at the heart of the initial dispute with Kingi was confiscated – therefore finding its way back into government control – on the basis that Kingi was at war, though the Waitangi Tribunal concluded there was no evidence he had engaged in hostilities after 1861.

In 1884 the Government returned as &quot;Native reserves&quot; 103,000 hectares of the 526,000 hectares of Taranaki land it had confiscated, although the land remained in government control. By 1990 half of the &quot;reserves&quot; had been sold to Pākehā settlers by the Native Trustee without reference to Maori. The remainder was leased to settlers with Maori receiving only a &quot;peppercorn&quot; rental return.

The Pekapeka Block – which had been the catalyst of the Taranaki Wars and, by extension, the policy of land confiscation – was divided up and given as endowments, or gifts, to the Waitara Borough Council and Taranaki Harbours Board. In 1989 the land was transferred to the New Plymouth District Council, which in turn voted in March 2004 to sell it to the Government with the intention of it being passed to Te Āti Awa as part of the Waitangi Treaty settlement. That process was blocked by the High Court in November 2005 after a challenge by the Waitara Leaseholders Association. Association members, each of whom owns a house but leases the (once confiscated) land on which it stands, want to own the land freehold.

===Treaty settlement===

In September 1990 the Waitangi Tribunal began hearing 21 Treaty of Waitangi claims concerning the Taranaki district. Much of the tribunal&#x27;s investigation focused on events around Waitara from 1840 to 1859.

The tribunal presented its report to the Government in June 1996, noting: &quot;The Taranaki claims could be the largest in the country. There may be no others where as many Treaty breaches had equivalent force and effect over a comparable time. For the Taranaki hapu, conflict and struggle have been present since the first European settlement in 1841 ... Taranaki Maori were dispossessed of their land, leadership, means of livelihood, personal freedom, and social structure and values. As Maori, they were denied their rights of autonomy, and as British subjects, their civil rights were removed. For decades, they were subjected to sustained attacks on their property and persons.&quot;

In its report, the tribunal observed that to the offence of local Maori, many street names in Waitara honoured the architects of the illegal land confiscation, including chief crown purchasing agent Donald McLean, Land Purchase Commissioner Robert Parris, Governor Thomas Gore Browne and military officers Charles Emilius Gold and Peter Cracroft. It said: &quot;It is our view that name changes are needed. It is when leaders like Kingi, who understood the prerequisites for peace, are similarly memorialised on the land and embedded in public consciousness that those names will cease to stand for conquest and the Waitara war will end.&quot;

In November 1999 the New Zealand Government signed a Heads of Agreement with Te Āti Awa to settle its claims, a process that would provide financial compensation and an apology for the confiscation of land.

===Marae===
Waitara has two marae.

Kairau Marae features Te Hungaririki meeting house, and is a meeting ground for the Pukerangiora hapū of Te Āti Awa. In October 2020, the Government committed $300,080 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade the marae, creating 15 jobs.

Ōwae or Manukorihi Marae features Te Ikaroa a Māui meeting house and is a marae of Te Āti Awa hapū of Manukorihi, Ngāti Rāhiri and Ngāti Te Whiti. In October 2020, the Government committed $360,002 to upgrade the marae and another marae, creating 15 jobs.

==Demographics==
Waitara covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Before the 2023 census, the town had a smaller boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Waitara had a population of 6,918 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 435 people (6.7%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 627 people (10.0%) since the 2006 census. There were 2,613 households, comprising 3,369 males and 3,543 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.95 males per female, with 1,512 people (21.9%) aged under 15 years, 1,311 (19.0%) aged 15 to 29, 2,799 (40.5%) aged 30 to 64, and 1,296 (18.7%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 72.4% European/Pākehā, 43.1% Māori, 3.5% Pacific peoples, 1.5% Asian, and 1.6% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 6.3, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 54.9% had no religion, 30.4% were Christian, 2.0% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.2% were Hindu, 0.1% were Muslim, 0.2% were Buddhist and 1.4% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 342 (6.3%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 1,821 (33.7%) people had no formal qualifications. 339 people (6.3%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 2,298 (42.5%) people were employed full-time, 657 (12.2%) were part-time, and 351 (6.5%) were unemployed.

== Economy ==

The first port in Taranaki to engage in international trade was Waitara, in 1823, when the barque &quot;William Stoveld&quot; anchored in the river mouth and traded with Māori.

With the establishment of the freezing works in 1872 the river port became even more important to the Province. However the river has a bar at its entrance which can only be crossed at high tide. With the development of a breakwater at the port in New Plymouth, and the railway to New Plymouth the Waitara port quickly became unimportant. Construction of a railway line between Waitara and New Plymouth began in August 1873. By the time the line opened on 14 October 1875, the town had a harbour board, two printing houses, a soap and candle factory, an iron foundry, a boat-building yard, two breweries, a wool-scouring plant and a tannery.

From 1887 the economy of Waitara became dependent on the frozen meat trade – first to Great Britain and since the creation of the European Common Market, to Asian countries. Except for some very early shipments from Waitara, frozen meat was transported to the port of New Plymouth by rail.

In 1902 Thomas Borthwick and Sons (Australasia) Ltd, a subsidiary of a UK company, bought the Waitara Freezing and Cold Storage Company plant at Waitara. Until 1998, the freezing works employed between 1000 and 1500 workers, by far the largest employer in a town with a population of between 3000 and 5000. In 1990, Borthwicks sold the Waitara works to AFFCO Holdings.

In 1995 AFFCO closed the Waitara works with the consequent severe loss of employment in the town. The shutdown followed the closure of a Swanndri clothing factory, a small-scale but locally significant Subaru car assembly plant and a wool scouring plant. The number of registered unemployed in the town rose from 700 to 1000, helping to boost the unemployment rate for the Taranaki region, which includes New Plymouth and Waitara, to 9.8 percent, compared with the national average of 6.7 percent. The loss of jobs affected Maori workers disproportionately because they were heavily represented in the work&#x27;s labour force. Maori were 3.4 times more likely than non-Maori to be living in a &quot;deprived&quot; situation. After the closure, the majority of buildings making up the Waitara freezing works were demolished, significantly changing the townscape (the area on the right on the far side of the river in the image of Waitara below, was the site of the freezing works).

ANZCO Foods Group subsequently built a plant to manufacture smallgoods such as salami, sausages and hamburger patties on the site of the freezing works. However, AFFCO went to court to enforce a 20-year encumbrance which restricts meat processing and associated activities on the site. It succeeded in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal in preventing the new plant from opening, although an ANZCO subsidiary was allowed to continue using freezer and coolstore facilities there. The two companies are said to have reached an agreement. ANZCO now operates from the site, and has become one of the major employers in the township.

Although the freezing works had been the economic backbone of Waitara, for over 75 years the plants had discharged blood, waste and effluent from the slaughter houses, chains and tanneries directly into the Waitara River, less than 3 km from the sea, well within the tidal zone. Even after an ocean outfall was built in collaboration with the town council&#x27;s sewerage system, at Waitangi Tribunal hearings in Waitara, local Maori gave evidence that they had &quot;…historic associations with the coastline in this area and depend upon the sea resources to provide them with the diet to which they have been accustomed for many centuries…..thus the contamination of one reef would deprive hapu which customarily was entitled to the sea food from the reef&quot;.

Two large petrochemical plants are now the most important industrial activity in Waitara. The Waitara Valley plant is dedicated to production of methanol from natural gas (about 1500 tonnes per day). The Motunui plant, originally designed to produce synthetic petrol from methanol was modified to produce chemical grade methanol for export. The high cost of synthetic petrol production and low market prices made the process uneconomical at the time. Motunui has the two largest wooden structures in the southern hemisphere and they are only exceeded in size, anywhere in the world, by the Buddhist temple Tōdai-ji in Nara, Japan. The Motunui plant was closed in December 2004, and restarted in 2008. An onshore production facility for the Pohokura oilfield has been built immediately adjacent to it.

The town continues to be a service centre for the farming sector, particularly to the north and northeast. Farming in the Waitara catchment includes dairying, beef cattle for meat, sheep for both meat and wool, fruit—mainly kiwifruit—other horticulture including tree and shrub nurseries, and poultry for meat and eggs.

==Sport==
The original Waitara Cricket Club was formed in October 1878, with Mr. J. Elliot elected club captain. Mr L. Issit as secretary and treasurer and a committee consisting of Messrs. Bayly, Tutty and Smith. Annual subscriptions for members were set at 10s. The club colours were chosen to be the same as the Waitara Boating Club, &quot;scarlet and white&quot;.

The Waitara Soccer Club was first formed in 1905, and was originally based at the Pukekohe Domain (Camp Reserve), Browne Street, Waitara. The first match the club played was against the New Plymouth A.F.C. on the afternoon of 18 May 1905. Waitara took the lead early in the match, then New Plymouth scored three answered goals for a 3–1 victory. In its first season in the Taranaki Championship, the club won the Julian Cup.

<doc id="1069403" wikidata="Q606557" url="?curid=1069403" title="Eric Carle">
<text>Eric Carle (June 25, 1929 – May 23, 2021) was an American author, designer and illustrator of children&#x27;s books. His picture book &quot;The Very Hungry Caterpillar&quot;, first published in 1969, has been translated into more than 66 languages and sold more than 50 million copies. Carle&#x27;s career as an illustrator and children&#x27;s book author accelerated after he collaborated on &quot;Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?&quot;. Carle illustrated more than 70 books, most of which he also wrote, and more than 145 million copies of his books have been sold around the world.

==Early life, family, and education==
Carle was born on June 25, 1929, in Syracuse, New York, the son of Johanna (née Oelschlaeger) and Erich W. Carle, a civil servant. When he was six years old, his mother, homesick for Germany, led the family back to Stuttgart. Carle was educated there and graduated from the local art school, the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart. His father was drafted into the German Army at the beginning of World War II (1939) and taken prisoner by the Soviet forces when Germany capitulated in May 1945. He returned home in late 1947, weighing . Carle told &quot;The Guardian&quot; years later that his father was a broken man when he returned after his military service, recalling Erich was a &quot;sick man. Psychologically, physically devastated.&quot;

Carle was sent to the small town of Schwenningen to escape the bombings of Stuttgart. When he was 15, the German government conscripted boys of that age to dig trenches on the Siegfried Line. Carle did not care to think about it deeply and said his wife thought he suffered from post-traumatic stress:
==Career==
Always homesick for the US, Carle returned, eventually settling in New York City in 1952 with only US$40 in savings (). He worked as a graphic designer in the promotion department of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Carle was drafted into the US Army during the Korean War and stationed in Germany with the 2nd Armoured Division as a mail clerk. After his discharge, Carle returned to his job at &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He later became the art director of an advertising agency.
Educator and author Bill Martin Jr. noticed the illustration of a red lobster Carle had created for an advertisement and asked him to collaborate on a picture book.

&quot;Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?&quot; was published by Henry Holt &amp; Co. in 1967 and became a best-seller. Thus began Carle&#x27;s career as an illustrator, and soon he was writing and illustrating his own stories. His first books as both author and illustrator were &quot; to the Zoo&quot; and &quot;The Very Hungry Caterpillar&quot; in 1969. &quot;The Very Hungry Caterpillar&quot; was voted the number two children&#x27;s picture book behind Maurice Sendak’s &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; in a 2012 survey of &quot;School Library Journal&quot; readers.

Carle&#x27;s artwork was created as collage, using hand-painted papers, which he cut and layered to form bright and colourful images. Many of Carle&#x27;s books have an added dimension—die-cut pages, twinkling lights as in &quot;The Very Lonely Firefly&quot;, even the lifelike sound of a cricket&#x27;s song as in &quot;The Very Quiet Cricket&quot;. The themes of his stories are usually drawn from nature and inspired by the walks his father would take him on across meadows and through woods.

In Carle&#x27;s own words:


Carle and his wife Barbara Morrison founded The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art, a museum devoted to the art of children&#x27;s books in Amherst, Massachusetts, adjacent to Hampshire College. According to the museum, it has had over one million visitors since it opened its doors in 2002.

==Honors and awards==
Carle received numerous honorary degrees from colleges and universities including Williams College in 2016, Smith College in 2014, Appalachian State University in 2013 and Bates College in 2007.

Carle won numerous awards for his work in children&#x27;s literature, including the Japan Picture Book Award, the Regina Medal and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society of Illustrators. In 2003, Carle received the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award (now called the Children&#x27;s Literature Legacy Award), from the professional children&#x27;s librarians, which recognizes an author or illustrator whose books, published in the US, have made &quot;a substantial and lasting contribution to literature for children&quot;. The committee cited Carle&#x27;s &quot;visual observations of the natural world&quot; and his innovative designs: &quot;Taking the medium of collage to a new level, Carle creates books using luminous colors and playful designs often incorporating an interactive dimension, tactile or auditory discoveries, die-cut pages, foldouts, and other innovative uses of page space.&quot; In 2010, Carle was a US nominee for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award, &quot;the highest international recognition given to an author and an illustrator of children&#x27;s books.&quot;

Google paid tribute to Carle and his book &quot;The Very Hungry Caterpillar&quot; by asking him to design the logo &quot;Google doodle&quot;, introduced on its home page on March 20, 2009, celebrating the first day of spring.

In 2019, a jumping spider mimicking a caterpillar was named in Carle&#x27;s honor, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the publication of &quot;The Very Hungry Caterpillar&quot;, and to celebrate his 90th birthday.

The Frist Art Museum of Nashville, Tennessee&#x27;s exhibition &quot;Eric Carle&#x27;s Picture Books: Celebrating 50 Years of &quot;The Very Hungry Caterpillar&quot;&quot; was on display from October 18, 2019, through February 23, 2020. In November 2019, Carle sold his publishing rights to Penguin Random House.

==Personal life==

For over 30 years, Carle and his second wife, Barbara (Morrison) Carle, resided in Northampton, Massachusetts as well as a winter home in Key Largo, Florida. Carle had a son and a daughter.

Eric Carle died on May 23, 2021, at his summer studio in Northampton from kidney failure, at age 91. An official announcement was made by his family on May 26, 2021, via their website. His wife Barbara had died in 2015 at her home in North Carolina.

<text>Te Aute College (Māori: Te Kura o Te Aute) is a school in the Hawke&#x27;s Bay region of New Zealand. It opened in 1854 with twelve pupils under Samuel Williams, an Anglican missionary, and nephew and son-in-law of Bishop William Williams. It has a strong Māori character.

It was built on land provided by Ngai Te Whatuiapiti, a hapū of the Ngāti Kahungunu iwi. In 1857, a Deed of Gift transferred the land from Te Whatuiapiti to the Crown, with a request that it be granted to the Bishop of New Zealand and his successors.

==History==

=== Establishment ===
Te Aute is situated within a valley of significant strategic importance to local hapū. The nearby Roto-a-Tara pā had been the key stronghold for Te Whatuiapiti during the Musket Wars, and was still a key settlement during the 1850s. From as early as 1840 the Anglican Bishop William Williams had established a mission station at Gisborne and was proselytizing actively among the East Coast tribes, and William Colenso had established a mission in Napier. Plans to establish a school for the local hapū were in motion from as early as 1851, when large blocks of Māori land in the region were acquired by the Crown. Then, when Colenso was dismissed from his mission in 1851, Williams&#x27; nephew Samuel Williams took up residence in the region, and began advancing the plan to establish a school. He met with Te Whatuiapiti representatives at Roto-a-Tara pā on 17 April 1853, accompanied by the Governor Sir George Grey, who provided the Crown&#x27;s backing for the plan. An agreement was made at that meeting for a school to be established at Te Aute, with the crown supplying 4000 acres of land and Te Whatuiapiti hapū gifting an additional 3397 acres. In recent decades, the original acquisition of the Crown&#x27;s portion of land gifted for the school has been the subject of a Waitangi Tribunal claim, which is presently in the settlement process.

=== Early history ===
After only five years in operation, a fire destroyed much of the college and forced its closure in 1859. Samuel Williams began fundraising for the reconstruction of the college, accumulating £700 by 1870 – in part thanks to financial assistance from an aunt, Catherine Heathcote. Rebuilding began in 1871 and was completed in 1872. The college was reopened in 1872 under John Reynolds as headmaster. It began to grow steadily, with 24 Māori and 3 English boarders in attendance by 1874, and some day pupils.

The college chapel was constructed in 1900, in a design by architect Charles Natusch.

Between 1878 and 1912 Te Aute was led by headmaster John Thornton, who implemented a curriculum developed along the lines of an English grammar school. In 1883 the college was visited by James Pope, the government-appointed inspector of native schools, and received praise for Thornton&#x27;s curriculum. Pope described the standards reached at Te Aute in mathematics and science as &#x27;equal to those of any secondary school in the country.&#x27;

By 1900 Te Aute was renowned for high academic standards and had become pre-eminent among Māori boarding colleges, as it was sending several boys onto university each year.

=== 20th century ===
In 1906 a Royal Commission of Inquiry was established to investigate the effectiveness of teaching at Te Aute and other Māori boarding colleges. George Hogben, the newly appointed inspector of native schools, recommended that the college discontinue instruction in Latin, euclidean geometry, and algebra, and increase agricultural and manual instruction. His view was that the most academically able students could be sent to ordinary secondary schools, and he predicted that eventually Te Aute would have no role to play in preparing boys for university. Thornton defended the existing academic curriculum, arguing that Māori opinion favoured academic instruction and that Māori parents relied on Te Aute for academic rather than vocational education. Ultimately the commission recommended that greater emphasis be placed on manual and technical instruction in agriculture, and the college&#x27;s trustees complied under pressure from the Department of Education. In the following years the college&#x27;s attempted pivot toward vocational instruction began alienating academically gifted students, notably Golan Maaka. In 1922, Maaka became disillusioned with the heavy focus on agricultural instruction and the lack of Māori cultural studies at the college. He left Te Aute as a result and completed his schooling in Dannevirke instead.

In 1918 the college was damaged significantly by fire again. This coincided with the impact of the 1918 influenza epidemic, ultimately forcing the college to close temporarily. Reconstruction planning began immediately, with college trustees opting for more modern brick buildings. While construction planning continued, the college reopened in 1919 under a new headmaster E. G. Loten. Loten was a proponent of agricultural education, and satisfied the Department of Education&#x27;s wish for an agriculturally intensive curriculum. On 9 September 1922 the foundation stone of the first new brick facility was laid by Churchill Julius, the Archbishop of New Zealand. It was named The Julius Wing and was opened in April 1923. Later that year, the foundation stone of the second brick facility was laid by the Governor General, The Viscount Jellicoe, and the building was named The Jellicoe Wing. The third and final brick facility was the largest – it contained the college library, its assembly hall and its administration offices – and was named after Governor General Sir Charles Fergusson, who laid its foundation stone in 1926 and officially opened it in 1927.

On 3 February 1931, the college was severely damaged by the Hawke&#x27;s Bay earthquake. There were no deaths, but the top storey of the Jellicoe and Julius wings were levelled, and the tower atop the Fergusson block collapsed. The buildings were repaired and reinforced, but the cost of £7,769 placed an enormous financial burden on the college.

On 27 November 1986, the house of Allen Williams was recognised as a Category I heritage building by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. Williams was a nephew of Samuel Williams, and the house – known as The Cottage – is the last remaining residential building from the time of the college&#x27;s foundation.

In 1992 Hukarere Girls&#x27; College was closed, and many of its students were permitted to board at Te Aute instead. As a result, the college became co-educational, but later reverted to a boys&#x27; school when Hukarere was reopened in 1993.

== Young Māori Party==

The Young Māori Party established in 1902, which was dedicated to improving the position of Māori, grew out of the Te Aute Students Association, started by former students of the college in 1897. Old boys of Te Aute who were associated with the Young Māori Party include Rēweti Kōhere, Āpirana Ngata, Te Rangi Hīroa, Paraire Tomoana and Māui Pōmare.

==Scholarships==
Several scholarship funds have been set up since the college&#x27;s establishment. In October 1877, Sir Douglas Maclean set up the Te Makarini Trust with an initial endowment of £3,000, which still provides annual scholarships to gifted students. The fund was established in memory of Sir Donald McLean, an influential figure in Māori-settler relations in the mid-1800s and a prominent Hawke&#x27;s Bay magistrate. In 1908, a legacy of £1,000 from the late Sir Walter Buller was gifted to the Te Aute Trustees for investment, the proceeds of which provided for a scholarship for many of the college&#x27;s students over the following decades.

<text>In the United States, airways or air routes are defined by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in two ways:

&quot;VOR Federal airways and Low/Medium Frequency (L/MF) (Colored) Federal airways&quot;

These are designated routes which aeroplanes fly to aid in navigation and help with separation to avoid accidents. Airways are defined with segments within a specific altitude block, corridor width, and between fixed geographic coordinates for satellites navigation system, or between ground-based radio transmitter navigational aids (navaids; such as VORs or NDBs) or the intersection of specific radials of two navaids.

==United States==

=== History ===
To guide airmail pilots on their delivery routes, the United States Postal Service constructed the first airways in the United States, the Contract Air Mail routes. These airways were between major cities and identified at night by a series of flashing lights and beacons which pilots flew over in sequence to get from one city to the next. Intermediate fields were located every in case of emergencies, with at least two landing strips a minimum of in length, and in width. Rotating airways beacons were erected every . However, these visual airways required the pilots to be in visual contact with the ground, which precluded flying in fog or clouds. Subsequently, the Department of Commerce funded the development of other means of airway navigation.

The first airways to be delineated by radio frequency were based on the old Low-frequency radio range also called the &quot;Four Course Radio Range&quot; or &quot;A/N&quot; system. The pilot listened for the stronger of the Morse codes transmitters (&quot;· –&quot; for &quot;A&quot; and &quot;– ·&quot; for &quot;N&quot;, indicating left or right of the course); the objective was to be centered on course hearing a steady tone (the A and N Morse codes merge to form a steady tone when the receiver is equidistant from both transmitters).

Later airways were based on low/medium frequency ground stations, like the beat frequency oscillator (BFO) and the non-directional beacon (NDB). These L/M frequency airways were the &quot;colored airways&quot;. Colored airways still exist, mostly in Alaska. There are only a few colored airways remaining in the contiguous United States. There is one colored airway on the coast of North Carolina called G13 (Green 13). There is one Canadian colored airway designated A16 (Amber 16) that transits through US airspace in northwestern Washington State and is visible on the Seattle sectional chart. Additionally, there are several colored airways connecting to, and transitioning through, the Florida Keys. B9 (Blue 9) connects the Southern Florida mainland to Marathon Key. B646 (Blue 646) connects Mérida, Mexico to Nassau, Bahamas and transitions through the Florida Keys. A portion of B646 connects Key West to Marathon Key and serves as a bypass for aircraft unable to meet the 15,000 foot minimum altitude along that portion of V3. Finally, G765 (Green 765) connects Key West to Cozumel, Mexico. Colored airways are all depicted in brown on low and high altitude charts produced by the FAA&#x27;s Aeronautical Navigation Products.

=== Boundary ===
Federal airways is defined to be wide and usually a floor of above the ground. It does not include the airspace of a prohibited area. Aerobatic flights are prohibited within federal airways.

=== Victor airways ===
Low altitude airways (below MSL) that are based on VOR stations, appear on sectional charts, world aeronautical charts, and en route low altitude charts and are designated with the prefix &quot;V&quot; (pronounced &quot;victor&quot;, hence, &quot;victor airways&quot;). Victor airways are usually assigned odd route numbers for north-south routes and even route numbers for east-west routes. Route numbers are listed serially if more than one airways share the same route segment.

=== Jet routes ===
High altitude airways (from MSL to FL450) based on VOR stations are called jet routes; they appear on high altitude charts (that usually do not show topography, as the low altitude charts do) and are prefixed by the letter &quot;J&quot;. VOR-based routes are depicted in black on low and high altitude charts produced by the FAA&#x27;s Aeronautical Navigation Products.

=== RNAV routes ===
With the invention of RNAV routes, airway structure no longer has to be based on ground-based navaids; a new naming convention is used. RNAV routes not based on VOR routes in low altitudes are preceded with the letter &quot;T&quot;; high airway routes are designated with the letter &quot;Q&quot;. RNAV routes are depicted in blue on low and high altitude charts produced by the FAA&#x27;s Aeronautical Navigation Products. In addition to the published RNAV routes, if radar monitoring and traffic flow allow, air traffic controllers may approve random RNAV routes for IFR flights.

==Europe==

Airways are corridors wide of controlled airspace with a defined lower base, usually FL070–FL100, extending to FL195. They link major airports giving protection to IFR flights during the climb and descent phases, and often for non-jet aircraft, cruise phase of flight. Historically, they were laid out between VORs; however, advances in navigational technology mean that this is no longer a necessity. Each airway has a designator containing one letter and one to three numbers. All airspace above FL195 is class C controlled airspace, the equivalent to airways being called Upper Air Routes and having designators prefixed with the letter &quot;U&quot;. If an upper air route follows the same track as an airway, its designator is the letter &quot;U&quot; prefix and the designator of the underlying airway.

In the UK, airways are all class A below FL195 and, therefore, VFR flights are prohibited.

==Air corridor==

An air corridor is a designated region of airspace that an aircraft must remain in during its transit through a given region. Air corridors are typically imposed by military or diplomatic requirements. During the Berlin Blockade, for example, pilots flying across Soviet-controlled German airspace were required to maintain very specific positioning within air corridors defined by the commander in charge of the airlift. Subsequent flights, both military and civilian, between West Germany and West Berlin during the Cold War were required to remain within their designated corridor or risk being shot down.

Air corridors should not be confused with airways. Airways are navigational aids which a pilot generally may deviate from when circumstances warrant, while compliance with a designated air corridor is mandatory.

<text>Voters Outreach of America is a private voter registration firm, based out of Las Vegas, Nevada, run by Aaron James. 
In October 2004, allegations surfaced in several states that the group had collected and submitted Republican voter registration forms while inappropriately disposing of Democratic registration forms. Oregon and Nevada subsequently announced investigations into these allegations. Under state laws in these states, private canvassers must turn in all forms they collect. Similar allegations were made in Western Pennsylvania.

<text>Norman Edward Fawcett (July 29, 1910 – January 26, 1997) was a Canadian politician, who represented the riding of Nickel Belt in the House of Commons of Canada from 1965 to 1968. He was a member of the New Democratic Party.

He was born in Adanac, Saskatchewan. He later settled in Capreol, Ontario, where he worked as a railway conductor and a union activist before entering municipal politics, serving as a municipal councillor and deputy mayor beginning in 1962.

Fawcett won the 1965 Canadian federal election in Nickel Belt following the resignation of Liberal Member of Parliament Osias Godin. He represented Nickel Belt for two and a half years in the 27th Canadian Parliament, and lost his seat to Liberal challenger Gaetan Serré in the 1968 election. Following his defeat, he was re-elected to Capreol&#x27;s town council as mayor in 1969, serving four years. After two years out of office, he was re-elected to town council in 1975, serving as councillor and deputy mayor until his retirement from politics in 1991.

Following his death in 1997, Raymond Bonin, John Williams, Elsie Wayne, Bill Blaikie and René Laurin delivered statements of tribute to Norman Fawcett in the House of Commons of Canada.

Fawcett&#x27;s daughter Gaye is married to Elie Martel, who was the Member of Provincial Parliament for Sudbury East from 1967 to 1987. Shelley Martel, Elie Martel&#x27;s daughter and Fawcett&#x27;s granddaughter, won election to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario upon Elie Martel&#x27;s retirement, and continued to represent the riding of Nickel Belt until her own retirement from politics in 2007. She was married to former Ontario New Democratic Party leader Howard Hampton.

<text>The maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) or maximum gross takeoff weight (MGTOW) or maximum takeoff mass (MTOM) of an aircraft, also known as the maximum structural takeoff weight or maximum structural takeoff mass, is the maximum weight at which the pilot is allowed to attempt to take off, due to structural or other limits. The analogous term for rockets is gross lift-off mass, or GLOW. MTOW is usually specified in units of kilograms or pounds.

MTOW is the heaviest weight at which the aircraft has been shown to meet all the airworthiness requirements applicable to it. It refers to the maximum permissible aircraft weight at the start of the takeoff run. MTOW of an aircraft is fixed and does not vary with altitude, air temperature, or the length of the runway to be used for takeoff or landing.

Maximum permissible takeoff weight or &quot;regulated takeoff weight&quot;, varies according to flap setting, altitude, air temperature, length of runway and other factors. It is different from one takeoff to the next, but can never be higher than the MTOW.

==Certification standards==
Certification standards applicable to the airworthiness of an aircraft contain many requirements. Some of these requirements can only be met by specifying a maximum weight for the aircraft, and demonstrating that the aircraft can meet the requirement at all weights up to, and including, the specified maximum. This limit is typically driven by structural requirements – to ensure the aircraft structure is capable of withstanding all the loads likely to be imposed on it during the takeoff, and occasionally by the maximum flight weight.

==Multiple MTOW==
It is possible to have an aircraft certified with a reduced MTOW, lower than the structural maximum, to take advantage of lower MTOW-based fees, such as insurance premiums, landing fees and air traffic control fees are MTOW based. This is considered a permanent modification.

Alternatively, holders of an Air Operator Certificate (AOC) may vary the Maximum Declared Take-Off Weight (MDTOW) for their aircraft. They can subscribe to a scheme, and then vary the weight for each aircraft without further charge.

An aircraft can have its MTOW increased by reinforcement due to additional or stronger materials. For example, the Airbus A330 242 tonnes MTOW variant / A330neo uses Scandium–aluminium (scalmalloy) to avoid an empty weight increase.

==Maximum permissible takeoff weight or maximum allowed takeoff weight==
In many circumstances an aircraft may not be permitted to take off at its MTOW. In these circumstances the maximum weight permitted for takeoff will be determined taking account of the following:
* Wing flap setting. See the Spanair Flight 5022 crash
* Airfield altitude (height above sea-level) – This affects air pressure which affects maximum engine power or thrust. 
* Air temperature – This affects air density which affects maximum engine power or thrust.
* Length of runway – A short runway means the aircraft has less distance to accelerate to takeoff speed. The length for computation of maximum permitted takeoff weight may be adjusted if the runway has clearways and/or stopways.
* Runway wind component – The best condition is a strong headwind straight along the runway. The worst condition is a tailwind. If there is a crosswind it is the wind component along the runway which must be taken into account.
* Condition of runway – The best runway for taking off is a dry, paved runway. An unpaved runway or one with traces of snow will provide more rolling friction which will cause the airplane to accelerate more slowly. See the Munich air disaster.
* Obstacles – An airplane must be able to take off and gain enough height to clear all obstacles and terrain beyond the end of the runway.

The maximum weight at which a takeoff may be attempted, taking into account the above factors, is called the maximum permissible takeoff weight, maximum allowed takeoff weight or regulated takeoff weight.

==Field Limited Weight==
The Field Limited Weight is the lowest of the: 
*Take-Off Distance Limited Weight
*Engine-Out accelerate-stop distance limited weight
*Engine-Out Take-Off Distance Limited Weight

==Runway Limited Weight==
The Runway Limited Weight is the lowest of the: 
*Field Limited Weight
*VMCG limited weight
*Tyre speed limited weight
*Brake energy limited weight

==Regulated Take-Off Weight==
The Regulated Take-Off Weight is the lowest of the:
*Runway limited weight
*Obstacle limited weight
*Climb limited weight

<text>Archibald Kelso Roberts (September 11, 1898 – October 8, 1970) was a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1943 to 1948 and again from 1951 to 1967. Both times he represented the downtown Toronto riding of St. Patrick. He served as a senior cabinet minister in the governments of Leslie Frost and John Robarts.

==Background==
Roberts was born in Belleville, Ontario, in 1898. Roberts was married to Lillian Brathwaite and had three sons: Alexander (Alec) Roberts, Frank Kelso Roberts, (May 14, 1939 – July 1, 2003) who became a judge in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and a part-time judge of the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories, and Greer Roberts.

==Politics==
He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as the Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for the Toronto riding of St. Patrick in the 1943 Ontario election that brought the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party to power under George Drew.

Though a backbencher, he ran to succeed Drew in the 1949 provincial PC leadership convention, coming in third place.

In 1955, Drew&#x27;s successor as Premier of Ontario, Leslie Frost, elevated Roberts to cabinet as attorney-general. Early in his term, Roberts supported strengthening the &quot;Fair Accommodation Practices Act&quot; to require restaurants and bars to serve all customers equally, regardless of race or ethnicity. 

Roberts ran for the leadership of the party again in 1961 when Frost resigned, and led on the first ballot but then fell behind John Robarts, who went on to win on the sixth ballot. Roberts remained attorney-general until 1962 when he became Minister of Lands and Forests. Kelso had delivered a report that declared organized crime was virtually nonexistent in Ontario; the position was widely ridiculed and likely led to his demotion. &quot;In Canada,&quot; he had written, &quot;there&#x27;s nothing that can be likened to the Mafia, an organization that in Italy was dismantled long ago by Mussolini.&quot;

Roberts came under particular criticism when the press reported that he and officers of the Ontario Provincial Police had communicated with organized crime syndicates in Canada and the US. Roberts resisted calls to call a Royal Commission to investigate organized crime in Ontario and examine allegations that his ministry was covering up instances in which it deliberately or through lax procedures assisted organized crime. After the cabinet decided to give in to opposition demands that a Royal Commission be called, Roberts persisted in criticising the commission and interfering with its work until Premier Robarts decided to remove him as attorney-general and to demote him to ministry of land and forests. The Royal Commission ultimately cleared Roberts and his ministry of wrongdoing but found that organized crime was much more widespread in the province than Roberts had believed.

Roberts retired from cabinet in 1966, and retired from the legislature when the 1967 Ontario election was called. In 1969, he wrote a book, &quot;The Member for St. Patrick - 30 Years of Ontario Political Action.&quot; He died in 1970.

<doc id="1069442" wikidata="Q710538" url="?curid=1069442" title="Charles Bickford">
<text>Charles Ambrose Bickford (January 1, 1891 – November 9, 1967) was an American actor known for supporting roles. He was nominated three times for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1943), &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1947) and &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot; (1948). His other roles include &quot;Whirlpool&quot; (1950), &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1954) and &quot;The Big Country&quot; (1958).

==Early life==
Bickford was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, during the first minute of 1891. His parents were Loretus and Mary Ellen Bickford. The fifth of seven children, he was an intelligent but very independent and unruly child. He had a particularly strong relationship with his maternal grandfather, a sea captain, who was a powerful influence during his formative years. At the age of nine, he was tried and acquitted of the attempted murder of a trolley motorman, who had callously driven over and killed his beloved dog. He attended Foster School and Everett High School.

Always more interested in experiencing life than reading about it, Bickford was considered &quot;the wild rogue&quot; of the family, causing his parents frequent consternation. In his late teens, he drifted aimlessly around the United States for a time. Before breaking into acting, he worked as a lumberjack and investment promoter, and for a short time, ran a pest-extermination business. He was a stoker and fireman in the United States Navy when a friend dared him to get a job in burlesque. Bickford served as an engineer lieutenant in the United States Army during World War I. His first entry into acting was on the stage, eventually including Broadway. This venue provided him with an occasional living and served as the principal training ground for developing his acting and vocal talents.

==Career==
Bickford had intended to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to earn an engineering degree, but while wandering around the country, he became friends with the manager of a burlesque show, who convinced Bickford to take a role in the show. He debuted in Oakland, California in 1911. Bickford enjoyed himself so much that he abandoned his plans to attend MIT. He made his legitimate stage debut with the John Craig Stock Company at the Castle Square Theatre in Boston in 1912. He eventually joined a road company and traveled throughout the United States for more than a decade, appearing in various productions. In 1925, while working in a Broadway play called &quot;Outside Looking In&quot;, co-star James Cagney (in his first Broadway role) and he received rave reviews. He was offered a role in Herbert Brenon&#x27;s 1926 film of &quot;Beau Geste&quot;, but anxious not to give up his newfound Broadway stardom, refused it, a decision he later came to regret. Following his appearance in the critically praised but unsuccessful Maxwell Anderson-Harold Hickerson drama about the Sacco and Vanzetti case &quot;Gods of the Lightning&quot; (Bickford was the Sacco character), he was contacted by filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille and offered a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studios to star in DeMille&#x27;s first talking picture: &quot;Dynamite&quot;. He soon began working with MGM studio chief Louis B. Mayer on a number of projects.

Bickford became a star after playing Greta Garbo&#x27;s lover in &quot;Anna Christie&quot; (1930), but never developed into a leading man. Always independent minded, exceptionally strong-willed, and quick with his fists, Bickford frequently argued and nearly came to blows with Mayer and any number of other MGM authority figures during the course of this contract with the studio. During the production of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, he punched out his director following a string of heated arguments, primarily related to the interpretation of his character&#x27;s role. Throughout his early career on both the stage and later films, Bickford rejected numerous scripts and made no secret of his disdain for much of the material he was offered. Not surprisingly, his association with MGM was short-lived, with Bickford asking for and quickly receiving a release from his contract. He soon found himself blacklisted at other studios, though, forcing him to take the highly unusual step (for that era) of becoming an independent actor for several years. His career took another turn in 1935, when he was mauled by a lion and nearly killed while filming &quot;East of Java.&quot; While he recovered, he lost his contract with Twentieth Century-Fox and his leading-man status owing to extensive neck scarring suffered in the attack, coupled with his advancing age. Soon, he made a very successful transition to character roles, which he felt offered much greater diversity and allowed him to showcase his talent to better effect. Much preferring the character roles that became his forte, Bickford appeared in many notable films, including &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot;, &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, and &quot;Not as a Stranger&quot;.
Finding great success playing an array of character roles in films and later in television, Bickford quickly became highly sought-after; his burly frame and craggy, intense features, coupled with a gruff, powerful voice lent themselves to a wide variety of roles. Most often, he played lovable father figures, stern businessmen, heavies, ship captains, or authority figures of some sort. During the 1940s, he was nominated three times for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He served as host of the 1950s television series &quot;The Man Behind the Badge&quot;. 

On April 16, 1958, Bickford appeared with Roger Smith in &quot;The Daniel Barrister Story&quot; on &quot;Wagon Train&quot;. 

Bickford continued to act in projects right up to his death. He guest-starred on &quot;The Islanders&quot;, &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Show&quot;, and &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;. In his final years, Bickford played rancher John Grainger, owner of the Shiloh Ranch, on &quot;The Virginian&quot;. Bickford was well-liked by both fans and his fellow actors, including series lead James Drury. According to Drury, Bickford, who guest-starred earlier in the series in an unrelated role, wished he could have been on the series from the beginning. According to Paul Green, author of &quot;A History of Television&#x27;s The Virginian, 1962-1971&quot;, Bickford&#x27;s vigorous portrayal of John Grainger helped restore the quality of the show after what some considered a chaotic fourth season. 

Two of the actor&#x27;s late-career, big-screen roles came in the Western &quot;The Big Country&quot; (1958), as a wealthy and ruthless rancher, with Gregory Peck and Charlton Heston; and in the drama &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; (1962), as the forlorn father of an alcoholic, with Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick. President Dwight D. Eisenhower ran &quot;The Big Country&quot; four nights in a row in the White House when it was first released.

==Personal life==
Bickford married actress Beatrice Ursula Allen (stage name Beatrice Loring) in Manhattan in 1916. The couple had two children, daughter Doris, known as &quot;Bunny&quot;, and son Rex. 

Bickford was a practicing Catholic and a Democrat who supported Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s campaign during the 1952 presidential election.

In 1965, Bickford published his autobiography &quot;Bulls, Balls, Bicycles, &amp; Actors&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Bickford died in Los Angeles on November 9, 1967, at age 76, of pneumonia and a blood infection after being hospitalized for an extended period.

Bickford received two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. His motion-picture star is located at 6780 Hollywood Boulevard, and his television star is located at 1620 Vine Street.

<doc id="1069443" wikidata="Q3188260" url="?curid=1069443" title="Lighting control console">
<text>A lighting control console (also called a lightboard, lighting board, or lighting desk) is an electronic device used in theatrical lighting design to control multiple stage lights at once. They are used throughout the entertainment industry and are normally placed at the front of house (FOH) position or in a control booth.

All lighting control consoles can control dimmers which control the intensity of the lights. Many modern consoles can control Intelligent lighting (lights that can move, change colors and gobo patterns), fog machines and hazers, and other special effects devices. Some consoles can also interface with other electronic performance hardware (i.e. sound boards, projectors, media servers, automated winches and motors, etc.) to improve synchronization or unify their control.

Lighting consoles communicate with the dimmers and other devices in the lighting system via an electronic control protocol. The most common protocol used in the entertainment industry today is DMX512, although other protocols (e.g. 0-10 V analog lighting control) may still be found in use, and newer protocols such as ACN and DMX-512-A are evolving to meet the demands of ever increasing device sophistication. Some lighting consoles can communicate over a Local IP network infrastructure to provide control over more scalable systems. A common protocol for this is ESTA E1.31 sACN (pronounced: streaming A.C.N.) or Art-Net.

== Types of control consoles ==

Consoles vary in size and complexity, from small preset boards to dedicated moving light consoles. The purpose of all lighting consoles, however is the same: to consolidate control of the lights into an organized, easy-to-use system, so that the lighting designer can concentrate on producing a good show. Most consoles accept MIDI Show Control signals and commands to allow show control systems to integrate their capabilities into more complex shows.

=== Preset boards ===

Preset boards are the most basic lighting consoles—and also the most prevalent in smaller installations. They consist of two or more identical fader banks, called scenes. The faders (control slides) on these scenes can be manually adjusted. Each scene has the same number of channels which control the same dimmers. So the console operator can build a scene offline or in &quot;blind&quot;, a cross-fader or submaster is used to selectively mix or fade between the different scenes.

Generally, at least with a preset board, the operator has a cue sheet for each scene, which is a diagram of the board with the faders in their positions, as determined by the lighting designer. The operator sets the faders into their positions based on the cue sheets. Typically during a cue, the operator sets the next scene. Then the operator makes the transition between the scenes using the cross-fader.

Preset boards are not as prevalent since the advent of digital memory consoles, which can store scenes digitally, and are generally much less cumbersome but more expensive than preset boards. However, for small setups such as that of a DJ, they remain the board of choice for their simple to use interface and relative flexibility. Preset boards generally control only conventional lights; though some advanced hybrid consoles can be patched to operate intelligent lights in a round-about way by setting the control channels of the light to channels the preset board can control. However, this is not recommended since it is a cumbersome process.

=== Memory consoles ===

Memory-based consoles have become very popular in almost all larger installations, particularly theatres. This type of controller has almost completely replaced preset consoles as controllers of choice. Memory consoles are preferable in productions where scenes do not change from show to show, such as a theatre production, because scenes are designed and digitally recorded, so there is less room for human error, and less time between lighting cues is required to produce the same result. They also allow for lighting cues to contain larger channel counts due to the same time savings gained from not physically moving individual channel faders.

Many memory consoles have a bank of faders. These faders can be programmed to control a single channel (a channel is a lighting designer&#x27;s numerical name for a dimmer or group of dimmers) or a group of channels (known as a &quot;submaster&quot;). The console may also have provision to operate in analog to a manual desk for programming scenes or live control. On more advanced consoles, faders can be used to control effects, chases (sequences of cues), and moving light effects (if the console can control moving lights).

=== Moving light controllers ===

Moving Light Controllers are another step up in sophistication from Memory Consoles. As well as being capable of controlling ordinary luminaires via dimmers, they provide additional controls for intelligent fixtures. On midrange controllers, these are usually provided as a section separate from main Preset and Cue stack controls. These include an array of buttons allowing the operator to select the fixture or fixtures they want to control, and a joystick, or a number of wheels or rotary encoders to control fixture attributes such as the orientation (pan and tilt), focus, colour, gobos etc. found in this type of light. Unlike a fader that shows its value based on the position of a slider, a wheel is continuously variable and provides no visual feedback for the value of a particular control. Some form of display such as LCD or LED is therefore vital for displaying this information. The more advanced desks typically have one or more touchscreens, and present a GUI that integrates all the aspects of the lighting.

As there is no standard way of controlling an intelligent light, an important function for this type of desk is to consolidate the various ways in which the hundreds of types of intelligent lights are controlled into a single &quot;abstract&quot; interface for the user. By integrating knowledge of different fixtures and their attributes into the lighting desk software, the detail of how an attribute such as pan or tilt is controlled for one device vs. another can be hidden from the operator. This frees the operator to think in terms of what they want to achieve (e.g. pan 30 degrees clockwise) instead of how it is achieved for any given fixture (e.g. send value 137 down channel 23). Furthermore, should a lighting fixture need to be replaced with one from a different vendor that has different control sequences, no change need be apparent to the control operator. For some further discussion on how intelligent fixtures are controlled, see Digital MultipleX (DMX).

=== Personal computer-based controllers ===

Personal Computer (PC) based controllers are increasing in popularity owing to portability and reduced cost. These lighting console solutions use software with a feature set similar to that found in a hardware-based console. As dimmers, automated fixtures and other standard lighting devices do not generally have current standard computer interfaces, options such as DMX-512 ports and fader/submaster panels connected via USB are commonplace.

This system allows a &quot;build-to-fit&quot; approach: the end user initially provides a PC that fits their budget and any other needs with future options to improve the system, for example, by increasing the number of DMX outputs or additional console style panels.

Many lightboard vendors offer a PC software version of their consoles. Commercial lighting control software often require a specific, and possibly expensive, hardware DMX interface. However, inexpensive (&lt;$150) DMX -&gt; USB PC interfaces such as the ENTTEC and DMXKing DMX USB Pro with public API and other DIY, and free or Open source software hardware combinations are available.

Many console vendors also make a software simulator or &quot;offline editor&quot; for their hardware consoles, and these are often downloadable for free. The simulator can be used to pre-program a show, and the cues then loaded into the actual console. In addition, lighting visualization software is available to simulate and approximate how lighting will appear on stage, and this can be useful for programming effects and spotting obvious programming errors such as incorrect colour changes.

===Remote focus unit===
Many memory consoles have an optional Remote Focus Unit (RFU) controller that can be attached to the light board and used to control the board&#x27;s functions (though usually in some limited capacity). They are usually small enough to be handheld. This is ideal in situations where moving the light board is impractical, but control is needed away from where the board is located. That is, if the light board is in a control room that is located far from the fixtures, such as a catwalk, an RFU can be attached and an electrician or the lighting designer can bring it to a location which is close to the lights. Some of the newer and more advanced boards have RFUs that can be connected through USB or even wirelessly.

Various manufacturers offer software for devices such as Android and iPhones that cause the devices to act as remote controllers for their consoles. Also, independent software developers have released applications that can send Art-Net packets from an iPhone, thus enabling an iPhone to serve as a fully featured console when used in conjunction with an Art-Net to DMX converter or Art-Net compatible luminaries and dimmers. An example of this is ETC&#x27;s (Electronic Theater Controls) app called iRFR for Apple devices or aRFR for Android devices.

The &quot;Controller Interface Transport Protocol&quot;, or &quot;CITP&quot;, is a network protocol used between visualizers, lighting control consoles and media servers to transport non-show critical information during pre-production. The protocol is used for a number of purposes including SDMX, browsing media and thumbnails, and streaming media among different devices.

<doc id="1069446" wikidata="Q4688034" url="?curid=1069446" title="Aerial survey">
<text>Aerial survey is a method of collecting geomatics or other imagery data using airplanes, helicopters, UAVs, balloons, or other aerial methods. Typical data collected includes aerial photography, Lidar, remote sensing (using various visible and invisible bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as infrared, gamma, or ultraviolet) and geophysical data (such as aeromagnetic surveys and gravity measurements). It can also refer to a chart or map made by analyzing a region from the air. Aerial survey should be distinguished from satellite imagery technologies because of its better resolution, quality, and resistance to atmospheric conditions that can negatively impact and obscure satellite observation. Today, aerial survey is often recognized as a synonym for aerophotogrammetry, a part of photogrammetry where the camera is airborne. Measurements on aerial images are provided by photogrammetric technologies and methods.

Aerial surveys can provide information on many things not visible from the ground.

==Terms used in aerial survey==
; exposure station or air station: the position of the optical center of the camera at the moment of exposure.
; flying height: the elevation of the exposure station above the datum (usually mean sea level).
;altitude: the vertical distance of the aircraft above the Earth&#x27;s surface.
;tilt the angle between the aerial camera and the horizontal axis perpendicular to the line of flight.
; tip: the angle between the aerial camera and the line of flight.
;principal point: the point of intersection of the optical axis of the aerial camera with the photographical plane.
;isocentre: the point on the aerial photograph in which the bisector of the angle of tilt meets the photograph.
;nadir point: the image of the nadir, i.e. the point on the aerial photograph where a plumbline dropped from the front nodal point pierces the photograph.
;scale: ratio of the focal length of the camera objective and the distance of the exposure station from the ground.
;azimuth: the clockwise horizontal angle measured about the ground nadir point from the ground survey North meridian in the plane of photograph.
;orthomosaic: A high-resolution map created by orthophotos, usually via drones is termed as an orthomosaic. Ortho meaning a nadir image and mosaic meaning a collection of images.
;Temporal Resolution:Time between observations.

==Uses==
Aerial surveys are used for:

*Archaeology
* Fishery surveys
* Geophysics in geophysical surveys
*Hydrocarbon exploration
* Land survey
* Mining and mineral exploration
* Monitoring wildlife and insect populations (called aerial census or sampling)
* Monitoring vegetation and ground cover
* Reconnaissance
* Transportation projects in conjunction with ground surveys (roadway, bridge, highway)

Aerial surveys use a measuring camera where the elements of its interior orientation are known, but with much larger focal length and film and specialized lenses.

==Aerial survey sensors==
In order to carry out an aerial survey, a sensor needs to be fixed to the interior or exterior of the airborne platform with line-of-sight to the target; it is remotely sensing. With manned aircraft, this is accomplished either through an aperture in the skin of the aircraft or mounted externally on a wing strut. With unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), sensors are often mounted under or inside the vehicle, allowing for rapid data collection over challenging terrains, though sometimes with less precision than traditional methods.

Aerial survey systems typically include the following components:
* Flight navigation software to guide the pilot in flying the desired survey pattern.
* GNSS, combining GPS and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to provide accurate position and orientation data.
* Gyro-stabilized mounts to counteract the effects of aircraft roll, pitch, and yaw.
* Data storage units to securely save the recorded data.

==Examples of aerial survey sensors==
* Vexcel UltraCam today consists of four photogrammetric nadir and oblique cameras (Eagle, Falcon, Osprey, Condor) and their calibrations.
* Leica ADS100
* WaldoAir XCAM
* RIEGL LMS-Q780
* Trimble AX80
* Gpixel GMAX32152 / GMAX32103

<doc id="1069454" wikidata="Q652765" url="?curid=1069454" title="Argyre Planitia">
<text>Argyre Planitia is a plain located within the impact basin Argyre in the southern highlands of Mars. Its name comes from a map produced by Giovanni Schiaparelli in 1877; it refers to Argyre, a mythical island of silver in Greek mythology.

Argyre is centered at and lies between 35° and 61° S and 27° and 62° W in the Argyre quadrangle. The basin is approximately wide and drops below the surrounding plains; it is the second-deepest impact basin on Mars after Hellas. The crater Galle, located on the east rim of Argyre at , strongly resembles a smiley face.

The basin was formed by a giant impact event by an impactor around in diameter during the Late Heavy Bombardment of the early Solar System, approximately 4–3.8 billion years ago, and may be one of the best preserved ancient impact basins from that period. Argyre is surrounded by rugged massifs which form concentric and radial patterns around the basin. Several mountain ranges are present, some of these mountain ranges include Charitum and Nereidum Montes.

==Past water flows==
Four large Noachian epoch channels lie radial to the basin. Three of these channels (Surius Vallis, Dzígai Vallis, and Pallacopas Vallis) flowed into Argyre from the south and east through the rim mountains. The fourth, Uzboi Vallis, appears to have flowed out from the basin&#x27;s north rim to the Chryse region and may have drained a lake of melting ice within the basin. A smaller outflow channel named Nia Valles is relatively fresh-looking, and probably formed during the early Amazonian after the major fluvial and lacustrine episodes had finished.

The original basin floor is buried with friable, partially deflated layered material that may be lake sediment. No inner rings are visible; however, isolated massifs within the basin may be remnants of an inner ring.

==Past habitability==
After the formation of the impact basin, heat from the impact event along with geothermal heating may have allowed for liquid water to persist for many millions of years. The lake&#x27;s volume could have been equal to that of Earth&#x27;s Mediterranean Sea. The basin would have supported a regional environment favorable for the origin and the persistence of life. This region shows a great deal of evidence of glacial activity with flow features, crevasse-like fractures, drumlins, eskers, tarns, arêtes, cirques, horns, U-shaped valleys, and terraces. Because of the shapes of Argyre sinuous ridges, the authors agree with previous publications in which they are eskers.

Based on morphometrical and geomorphological analysis of the Argyre eskers and their immediate surroundings, it was suggested that they formed beneath an approximately 2 km thick, stagnant (i.e., stationary) ice sheet around 3.6 billion years ago. This stagnant body of ice might have resembled a Piedmont-style glacier comparable to today&#x27;s Malaspina Glacier in Alaska.

<text>A statistical database is a database used for statistical analysis purposes. It is an OLAP (online analytical processing), instead of OLTP (online transaction processing) system. Modern decision, and classical statistical databases are often closer to the relational model than the multidimensional model commonly used in OLAP systems today.

Statistical databases typically contain parameter data and the measured data for these parameters. For example, parameter data consists of the different values for varying conditions in an experiment (e.g., temperature, time). The measured data (or variables) are the measurements taken in the experiment under these varying conditions.

Many statistical databases are sparse with many null or zero values. It is not uncommon for a statistical database to be 40% to 50% sparse. There are two options for dealing with the sparseness: (1) leave the null values in there and use compression techniques to squeeze them out or (2) remove the entries that only have null values.

Statistical databases often incorporate support for advanced statistical analysis techniques, such as correlations, which go beyond SQL. They also pose unique security concerns, which were the focus of much research, particularly in the late 1970s and early to mid-1980s.

== Privacy in statistical databases ==

In a statistical database, it is often desired to allow query access only to aggregate data, not individual records. Securing such a database is a difficult problem, since intelligent users can use a combination of aggregate queries to derive information about a single individual.

Some common approaches are:
* only allowing aggregate queries (SUM, COUNT, AVG, STDEV, etc.)
* rather than returning exact values for sensitive data like income, only return which partition it belongs to (e.g. 35k-40k)
* return imprecise counts (e.g. rather than 141 records met query, only indicate 130-150 records met it.)
* do not allow overly selective WHERE clauses
* audit all users queries, so users using system incorrectly can be investigated
* use intelligent agents to detect automatically inappropriate system use

For many years, research in this area was stalled, and it was thought in 1980 that, to quote:
:The conclusion is that statistical databases are almost always subject to compromise. Severe restrictions on allowable query set sizes will render the database useless as a source of statistical information but will not secure the confidential records.
But in 2006, Cynthia Dwork defined the field of differential privacy, using work that started appearing in 2003. While showing that some semantic security goals, related to work of Tore Dalenius, were impossible, it identified new techniques for limiting the increased privacy risk resulting from inclusion of private data in a statistical database. This makes it possible in many cases to provide very accurate statistics from the database while still ensuring high levels of privacy.

<text>Historic Deerfield is a museum dedicated to the heritage and preservation of Deerfield, Massachusetts, and history of the Connecticut River Valley. Its historic houses, museums, and programs provide visitors with an understanding of New England&#x27;s historic villages and countryside. It is located in the village of Old Deerfield which has been designated a National Historic Landmark District (as the Old Deerfield Historic District), and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The museum also hosts the Dublin Seminar for New England Folklife.

==Sites==
Eleven historic house museums are located in Historic Deerfield. Most are viewed on guided tours. A modern museum and a visitors center are part of the complex. The museum offers special exhibitions, family activities, workshops and seminars on historic subjects, and a gift shop. The Deerfield Inn is available for visitors.

* Ashley House is the 1734 home of Deerfield&#x27;s 18th-century minister, with furnishings of the Connecticut River elite and English ceramics.
* Allen House is a 1734 home that was the 20th-century residence of Historic Deerfield&#x27;s founders, Henry and Helen Flynt. The Flynt family renovated the house in 1945. The home features their personal collection of American antiques and is open by arrangement.
* Stebbins House is the 1799 home of Asa Stebbins. The brick house features Federal period decorations, including neoclassical furnishings dating from 1790 to 1830.

* Sheldon House was built in 1754–55 and is interpreted to the period of 1780 to 1810. This house is open for self-guided tours.
* Wells-Thorn House is a 1747 house featuring rooms demonstrating different periods and lifestyles from 1725 to the 1850s.
* Williams House is a c. 1730 house extensively renovated in 1817. The house features Federal-style furnishings and decorations.
* Flynt Center of Early New England Life is a modern museum with changing exhibits of history, heritage crafts, decorative arts, and other topics.

==History==
Historic Deerfield was founded by Henry and Helen Flynt, who had visited Deerfield in 1936 when their son attended Deerfield Academy. It was originally called &quot;The Heritage Foundation&quot; (not to be confused with The Heritage Foundation), but was changed to Historic Deerfield after Flynt&#x27;s death in 1970.

==Local geography==
Historic Deerfield is based on a 330-year-old, mile-long street situated along the Deerfield River in the Pioneer Valley of Western Massachusetts.

== Deerfield history ==
At the time of European contact, the area now known as Deerfield was inhabited by the indigenous Pocumtuck nation. The town was originally established as a grant of land to the residents of Dedham, Massachusetts, who had given land to the Massachusetts Bay Colony for the purpose of settling Christianized Indians.

For much of the colonial period Deerfield was one of New England&#x27;s frontier villages. Briefly abandoned during King Philip&#x27;s War in the 1670s, it was subjected to French and Indian raids during King William&#x27;s War in the 1690s. In Queen Anne&#x27;s War the village was subjected to a major raid, in which 40 percent of the population was taken prisoner. French and allied Abenaki, Mohawk, and other warriors breached the palisade and raided the village. They killed numerous settlers and took more than 100 residents captive. Before leaving for Canada, the raiding party burned the village.

Almost all of those who survived the attack and the march to Canada eventually were ransomed and returned to New England. Eunice Williams, captured at age eight, was adopted by a Mohawk family and became totally assimilated. She married a Mohawk man and had a family with him, choosing not to return to New England. In 1741 she visited surviving siblings for the first time, and she made two more visits later.

Deerfield survived the raid, and the frontier was pushed farther north and west. Settlers eventually moved into present-day Vermont and established settlements farther up the Connecticut River in New Hampshire.

== Art From Deerfield ==
The town of Deerfield is home to a particular group of needlework samplers that share several defining features, known as the &quot;White Dove&quot; school. Popular in the area from 1790–1830, this style of sampler is named for the embroidered depiction of white doves outlined in black. Along with the doves, the style was typically characterized by an arrangement of baskets holding fruits and flowers, usually in a pyramid shape, sewn underneath an alphabet or verse, and surrounded by a three sided border. The uniformity in the works created from 1798–1826 suggests that the girls who created them studied under one instructor, but who they were and where they taught is unknown.

A well known example of the White Dove style was created by a girl named Esther Slate, at the age of ten years old in 1824. There are no less than three alphabets stitched into four separate rows, the first two alphabets are in a cursive font in both upper and lowercase letters, and the third alphabet is a block type font. The sampler is bordered by green vine motives on three sides, with a geometric triangle pattern on the bottom edge. Below the alphabets, Esther embroidered a garden scene, with a blue house in the center, flanked by two trees on either side, and a white picket fence surrounding them. Underneath the fence, the titular two white doves outlined in black stand with their wings spread. The picture is symmetrical up to the second tree on either side. On the left hand side, birds perch on sunflowers and crops, while an elephant and a monkey reside underneath. To the right, a fruit tree stands next to two of the popular white dove style fruit baskets.

Though the instructor who taught this style is unknown, the surviving pieces of the White Dove school were created by the children of prominent families in the area, and are in the collection of Historic Deerfield. Other examples of the style include the other sampler pictured on this page, made by Katy Bernard in 1793.

<text>James Deuchar (26 June 1930 – 9 September 1993) was a Scottish jazz trumpeter and big band arranger, born in Dundee, Scotland. He found fame as a performer and arranger in the 1950s and 1960s. Deuchar was taught trumpet by John Lynch, who learned bugle playing as a boy soldier in the First World War, and who later was Director of Brass Music for Dundee.

==Career==
After National Service at Padgate, Warrington, England, Deuchar worked with the British modern jazz unit the Johnny Dankworth Seven. In the 1950s, he worked with a number of commercial bands, such as the Oscar Rabin Band, and also intermittently with Ronnie Scott. In the late 1950s, he worked with Kurt Edelhagen&#x27;s orchestra in Germany.

He returned to the UK and worked again with Scott (1960–62) and with Tubby Hayes (1962–66). As a highly gifted player and a leading exponent of the &quot;modern&quot; style, he was in some demand and achieved success as a touring player in Europe and the United States. He also &quot;sat in&quot; with leading American players at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s club as musical exchanges were liberalised at the start of the 1960s.

He returned to work with Edelhagen in 1966. In the 1960s and early 1970s, he also worked with The Kenny Clarke-Francy Boland Big Band, featuring leading European and expatriate American musicians. He returned to London around 1971, working freelance, and then to Dundee in the mid-1970s. He continued to arrange, play and guest in a number of settings, including the BBC Big Band in London and the BBC Scottish Radio Orchestra in Glasgow, until his health deteriorated. 

He died in 1993, aged 63.

<text>In English-speaking countries, Belgian waffles are a variety of waffle with a lighter batter, larger squares, and deeper pockets than American waffles. Belgian waffles were originally leavened with yeast, but baking powder is now often used. They are often eaten as a breakfast food; toppings vary from whipped cream, confectioners sugar, soft fruit, and chocolate spread, to syrup and butter or margarine. They may also be served with vanilla ice cream and fresh fruit (such as strawberries) as a dessert.

In Belgium itself, there are several kinds of waffles, including the Brussels waffle and the Liège waffle.

==History==
Originally showcased in 1958 at Expo 58 in Brussels, Belgian waffles were introduced to the United States by a Belgian named Walter Cleyman at the Century 21 Exposition in Seattle in 1962, and served with whipped cream and strawberries. The waffles were further popularized in the United States during the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair at Flushing Meadows Park in Queens, New York City. These waffles were introduced by Maurice Vermersch of Brussels, Belgium. Largely based on a simplified recipe for the Brussels waffles, Vermersch decided to change the name to the Bel-Gem Waffle upon observing that many Americans could not correctly identify Brussels as the capital of Belgium. These waffles were served with whipped cream and strawberries, and they were sold for a dollar.

<text>Alfred Wallace Downer (May 1, 1904 – August 3, 1994) was a Canadian politician and longtime member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

==Background==
Downer was born near Penetanguishene in Simcoe County, Ontario. He was educated at Cookstown Continuation School, Alliston High School, the University of Toronto and Wycliffe College. After completing his schooling, he was ordained an Anglican priest. He was a vicar and then a canon in the Anglican Church of Canada and a member of the Conservative Party.

==Politics==
He ran unsuccessfully in the provincial riding of Wellington Northeast in 1929 and then was first elected to the legislature as the member for Dufferin—Simcoe in the 1937 election. He served as Member of Provincial Parliament until 1975, winning a provincial record of ten consecutive elections.

While an elected MPP, he also served in the military during World War II, serving as chaplain of the Queen&#x27;s York Rangers in North Africa and Europe. From 1955 until 1959, he served as Speaker of the legislative assembly. He also served as a liquor control commissioner beginning in 1960.

Downer was a candidate in the 1961 PC leadership convention, but was eliminated on the third ballot.

Downer had expected to run in the 1975 election and had expected to win his party&#x27;s nomination by acclamation but was upset by another candidate, George McCague, at the Progressive Conservative nomination meeting.

In 1994, Downer died at the age of 90. in Collingwood, Ontario.

<doc id="1069504" wikidata="Q1249903" url="?curid=1069504" title="Lordosis behavior">
<text>Lordosis behavior (), also known as mammalian lordosis (Greek lordōsis, from &quot;lordos&quot; &quot;bent backward&quot;) or presenting, is the naturally occurring body posture for sexual receptivity to copulation present in females of most mammals including rodents, elephants, cats, and humans. The primary characteristics of the behavior are a lowering of the forelimbs but with the rear limbs extended and hips raised, ventral arching of the spine and a raising, or sideward displacement, of the tail. During lordosis, the spine curves dorsoventrally so that its apex points towards the abdomen.

==Description==
Lordosis is a reflex action that causes many non-primate female mammals to adopt a body position that is often crucial to reproductive behavior. The posture moves the pelvic tilt in an anterior direction, with the posterior pelvis rising up, the bottom angling backward and the front angling downward. Lordosis aids in copulation as it elevates the hips, thereby facilitating penetration by the penis. It is commonly seen in female mammals during estrus (being &quot;in heat&quot;). Lordosis occurs during copulation itself and in some species, like the cat, during pre-copulatory behavior.

==Neurobiology==

The lordosis reflex arc is hardwired in the spinal cord, at the level of the lumbar and sacral vertebrae (L1, L2, L5, L6 and S1). In the brain, several regions modulate the lordosis reflex. The vestibular nuclei and the cerebellum, via the vestibular tract, send information which makes it possible to coordinate the lordosis reflex with postural balance. More importantly, the ventromedial hypothalamus sends projections that inhibit the reflex at the spinal level, so it is not activated at all times. Sex hormones control reproduction and coordinate sexual activity with the physiological state. Schematically, at the breeding season, and when an ovum is available, hormones (especially estrogen) simultaneously induce ovulation and estrus (heat). Under the action of estrogen in the hypothalamus, the lordosis reflex is uninhibited. The female is ready for copulation and fertilization.

When a male mammal mounts the female, tactile stimuli on the flanks, the perineum and the rump of the female are transmitted via the sensory nerves in the spinal cord. In the spinal cord and lower brainstem, they are integrated with the information coming from the brain, and then, in general, a nerve impulse is transmitted to the muscles via the motor nerves. The contraction of the longissimus and transverso-spinalis muscles causes the ventral arching of the vertebral column.

== Hormonal and cerebral regulation ==
Sexual behaviour is optimized for reproduction, and the hypothalamus is the key brain area which regulates and coordinates the physiological and behavioural aspects of reproduction. Most of the time, the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN) inhibits lordosis. But when environmental conditions are favorable and the female is in estrus, the estrogen hormone, estradiol, induces sexual receptivity by the neurons in the ventromedial nucleus, the periaqueductal gray, and other areas of the brain. The ventromedial hypothalamus sends impulses down axons synapsing with neurons in the periaqueductal gray. These convey an impulse to neurons in the medullary reticular formation which project down the reticulospinal tract and synapse with the neurobiological circuits of the lordosis reflex in the spinal cord (L1–L6). These neurobiological processes induced by estradiol enable the tactile stimuli to trigger lordosis.

The mechanisms of regulation of this estrogen-dependent lordosis reflex have been identified through different types of experiments. When the VMN is lesioned lordosis is abolished; this suggests the importance of this cerebral structure in the regulation of lordosis. Concerning hormones, displays of lordosis can be affected by ovariectomy, injections of estradiol benzoate and progesterone, or exposure to stress during puberty. Specifically, stress can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and therefore decrease concentrations of gonadal hormones. Consequently, these reductions in exposure to gonadal hormones around puberty can result in decreases in sexual behavior in adulthood, including displays of lordosis.

== In humans==
While lordosis behavior has not been observed in humans, positions similar to lordosis can be seen in those being mounted from behind, with the autonomous lordosis reflex replaced by a conscious decision to expose the vulva for penetration.

In a 2017 study, using 3D models and eye-tracking technology it is shown that the slight thrusting out of a woman&#x27;s hips influences how attractive others perceive her to be and captures the gaze of both men and women. The authors argue &quot;while reflexive lordosis posture is not exhibited by human females and receptivity is not passive or obligatory for them, a manifestation of lumbar curvature might serve as a vestigial remnant of proceptivity-/receptivity-communicative signal between men and women&quot;. Previously, anthropologist Helen Fisher also speculated that when a human female wears high-heeled footwear the buttocks thrusts out and the back arches into a pose that simulates lordosis behavior, which is why high heels are considered &quot;sexy&quot;. Recent evidence has also supported the perception of sexual receptivity in women when arching the back in supine and quadruped poses. Researchers have found that women perceive other women exhibiting this posture as a potential threat to their romantic relationship.

<text>August Christoph Carl Vogt (; ; 5 July 1817 – 5 May 1895) was a German scientist, philosopher, popularizer of science, and politician who emigrated to Switzerland. Vogt published a number of notable works on zoology, geology and physiology. All his life he was engaged in politics, in the German Frankfurt Parliament of 1848–49 and later in Switzerland.

==Early life==

Vogt was born in Giessen, the son of , professor of clinics, and Louise Follenius. His maternal uncle was Charles Follen. From 1833 to 1836, he studied medicine at the University of Giessen, and continued his training in Bern, Switzerland, earning his PhD. in 1839. He then worked with Louis Agassiz in Neuchâtel.

==Life and Career==
In 1847 he became professor of zoology at the University of Giessen, and in 1852 professor of geology and afterwards also of zoology at the University of Geneva. His earlier publications were on zoology. He dealt with the Amphibia (1839), Reptiles (1840), with Mollusca and Crustacea (1845) and more generally with the invertebrate fauna of the Mediterranean (1854). In 1842, during his time with Louis Agassiz, he discovered the mechanism of apoptosis, the programmed cell death, while studying the development of the tadpole of the midwife toad (&quot;Alytes obstetricans&quot;). Charles Darwin mentions Vogt&#x27;s support for the theory of evolution in the introduction to his &quot;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex&quot; (1871).

Vogt was a proponent of scientific materialism and atheism, eager to engage in public debates with philosophical and scientific opponents, such as in his work &quot;Köhlerglaube und Wissenschaft&quot; of 1855, which was reprinted four times the same year. 

Vogt defended the theory of polygenist evolution; he rejected the monogenist beliefs of most Darwinists and instead believed that each race had evolved from a different type of ape. He wrote the White race was a separate species from Negroes. In Chapter VII of his &quot;Lectures on Man&quot; (1864), he compared the Negro to the White race and described them as “two extreme human types”. The differences between them, he claimed, are greater than those between two species of ape; and this proved that Negroes are a separate species from Whites. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1869. He died in Geneva at the age of 77.

==Politics==
Vogt was active in German politics and was a left-wing representative in the Frankfurt Parliament. Karl Marx scathingly replied to attacks by Carl Vogt in his book &quot;Herr Vogt&quot; (Mister Vogt) in 1860.

Years later, in 1870, with the fall of the Second Empire, French Republic under the Government of National Defense put up a &quot;Commission chargée de réunir, classer et publier les papiers saisis aux Tuileries&quot; (&quot;Commission responsible for collecting, classifying and publishing the papers seized at the Tuileries&quot;) under the chairmanship of to publish the documents that survived the Tuileries Palace fire. In the published documents there was a list, prepared with the collaboration of André Lefèvre, that revealed some of the Bonapartist agents, among them, a man named Vogt: &quot;Vogt (?). Il lui est remis, en août 1859, 40,000 fr.&quot; (&quot;Vogt (?). He was given, in August 1859, 40.000 francs.&quot;)

After this publication, this issue also was handled in German Marxist/social-democratic papers. Newspaper &quot;Der Volksstaat&quot; published these passages in April 15. In &quot;Der Volksstaat&quot;&#x27;s May 10 issue, Engels, with his article &quot;Abermals „Herr Vogt“&quot; (&quot;Once again on Herr Vogt&quot;) further commented on the identity of the person named as &quot;Vogt (?)&quot;, and claimed it being Carl Vogt. Engels explained:

This revelation was later adapted by other Marxists and Marxologists too, and since then being canonized. Marx&#x27;s daughter, Eleanor Marx, in her biography of her father published after his death, also mentioned this affair. This question was mentioned in numerous Marxist texts, notably, publications of Herr Vogt or about Carl Vogt.

==Honors==

The city of Geneva, Switzerland named a boulevard (Boulevard Carl-Vogt) after Vogt and erected a memorial bust in front of a building of the University of Geneva. In September 2022, the university board of the University of Geneva decided to change the name of a university building named after Carl Vogt due to his racist and sexist theories.

<doc id="1069515" wikidata="Q5252917" url="?curid=1069515" title="Tomorrow Is Yesterday">
<text>&quot;Tomorrow Is Yesterday&quot; is the nineteenth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by D. C. Fontana and directed by Michael O&#x27;Herlihy, it first aired on January 26, 1967. It was the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode to be written solely by a woman (Fontana had previously written the teleplay for the episode “Charlie X” but the story was credited to Gene Roddenberry).

In the episode, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is sent back in time to Earth in the 1960s, where the US Air Force detects it. The crew must correct the damage to the timeline and find a way to travel back to the future.

==Plot==
The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; is sent back in time to Earth during the 1960s by the effects of a high-gravity &quot;black star&quot;. &quot;Enterprise&quot; appears in Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere and is detected by military radar.

When the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is labeled a UFO, a U.S. Air Force F-104 interceptor, piloted by Captain John Christopher, is scrambled to identify the craft. Fearing the fighter may be carrying nuclear weapons, Captain Kirk orders a tractor beam to be used on the jet, which causes it to break apart. To save the life of the pilot, they beam Christopher aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

Fearing Christopher could disrupt the timeline if returned to Earth, Kirk at first decides that the pilot must stay with the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. When Science Officer Spock later discovers that the pilot&#x27;s as-yet-unborn son will play an important role in a future mission to Saturn, Kirk realizes he must return Christopher to Earth after all.

After learning of the existence of film taken of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; by Christopher&#x27;s wing cameras, Kirk and Lt. Sulu beam down to the airbase to recover the film and any other evidence of their visit. They are caught by an Air Policeman, who accidentally activates an emergency signal on Kirk&#x27;s communicator and is beamed aboard. Kirk and Sulu continue their search, after which Kirk is captured again and Sulu escapes.

Spock, Sulu, and Christopher, who knows the base&#x27;s layout, beam down to recover Kirk. After Kirk&#x27;s guards are subdued, Christopher takes one of their guns and demands to be left behind. Spock, having anticipated Christopher would make such an attempt, appears behind Christopher and disables him with a Vulcan nerve pinch.

After they return to the ship, Spock and Chief Engineer Scott inform Kirk of a possible escape method by slingshotting around the Sun to break away and return to their time. The maneuver is risky, since even a small miscalculation could destroy the ship, or make them miss their own era.

Kirk approves the maneuver. &quot;Enterprise&quot; begins the maneuver and time on board begins to move backwards. Christopher is beamed back to his fighter jet at the instant he first encountered the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, preventing any film evidence of the ship being produced, and erasing his memory of his time on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The same is done with the Air Policeman. &quot;Enterprise&quot; then successfully returns to the 23rd century.

==Production==
The episode was originally conceived as part two to an earlier episode, &quot;The Naked Time&quot;; when the ending to that episode was revised, &quot;Tomorrow is Yesterday&quot; was reworked as a stand-alone story.
Associate producer Robert Justman devised the original idea for the story, and it was handed to Dorothy Fontana to create a teleplay. Justman received neither credit nor payment for doing so, whereas Roddenberry&#x27;s agent charged the studio up to $3,000 for his own stories and rewrites.

==Reference in further &quot;Star Trek&quot; stories==
The method of time travel in this episode was used subsequently to send the &quot;Enterprise&quot; back to the year 1968 in the second season episode &quot;.&quot; It is presumed the same technique was used to return the ship to her proper time after the episode ended.

The second issue of IDW Publishing&#x27;s comic book series &quot;Assignment: Earth&quot; (a continuation of the , drawing on the episode&#x27;s status as a failed backdoor pilot for a spin-off television series) shows the protagonists, Gary Seven and his assistant Roberta Lincoln, becoming peripherally involved in the events of &quot;Tomorrow is Yesterday&quot;, acting on their own to prevent the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s presence from affecting history. Due to peculiarities of time travel, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crewmembers have not yet met Seven and Lincoln at this point, but it is Seven&#x27;s and Lincoln&#x27;s second encounter with them (though they are careful to avoid direct contact, so as not to alter the proper course of events).

The &quot;slingshot maneuver&quot; was employed a third time by the crew in the motion picture &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;, this time to travel back to the year 1986, and to return the Klingon Bird of Prey, renamed &quot;Bounty&quot;, which the command crew had captured at the end of &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;, to 2286.

Dr. Agnes Jurati notes in &quot;Penance&quot;, the twelfth episode of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, that &quot;Kirk&#x27;s &quot;Enterprise&quot;&quot; used the method multiple times, and proposed doing the same, in order to restore their timeline. Responding to the objection that Kirk was able to succeed only because he had Spock to perform the calculations, Jurarti struck a deal for the services of the captive Borg Queen who was just as eager to set the timeline aright. The Borg Queen, Admiral Picard, and his crew, flew &quot;La Sirena&quot; back to 2024 in the following episode, &quot;Assimilation&quot;.

The &quot;Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual&quot; is described, in two forewords to the manual proper, as having had its contents accidentally downloaded into the main computer of a United States Air Force facility located in Omaha during the accidental time trip the &quot;Enterprise&quot; took in &quot;Tomorrow Is Yesterday&quot;—specifically Offutt Air Force Base, headquarters of the Strategic Air Command, referred to as the Omaha Installation in the script.

==Reception==
In 2009, Tor.com rated it 5 out 6, noting that it depicted a sort of &quot;hope and optimism and excitement about the new frontier&quot; at a time before the first lunar landing mission. The day after the first airing of this episode saw the Apollo 1 disaster.

Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a &#x27;B−&#x27; rating, describing it as &quot;so-so&quot; and &quot;passable&quot;.

SyFy ranked &quot;Tomorrow is Yesterday&quot; as the 11th best time travel plot in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, in 2016.

In 2018, CBR ranked this one of the top-twenty time travel themed episodes of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; series.

In 2018, BuzzFeed listed this as example of an episode of a TV series that would serve as a better introduction to the series than the pilot. They point out that the franchise can be overwhelming to newcomers, and praised this episode as &quot;beautiful, witty, and really makes you think&quot;.

In 2019, &quot;Nerdist&quot; ranked &quot;Tomorrow is Yesterday&quot; the sixth best time travel episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

<text>Lake Neusiedl (, ; or ; ; ; ), or Fertő (), is the largest endorheic lake in Central Europe, straddling the Austrian–Hungarian border. The lake covers , of which is on the Austrian side and on the Hungarian side. The lake&#x27;s drainage basin has an area of about . From north to south, the lake is about long, and it is between and wide from east to west. On average, the lake&#x27;s surface is above the Adriatic Sea and the lake is no more than deep. 

The landscape surrounding the lake has been occupied since about 6000 BC, and the towns and villages around the lake have been significant trading centers and meeting points for different cultures for centuries. Because of its cultural importance and the rural architecture of the villages around it, Lake Neusiedl and the surrounding area was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2001.

== Water level fluctuations ==
In the past, rainfall and aridity caused significant floods (which in 1768 enlarged the lake to its maximum documented size of ) and significant decreases in the lake&#x27;s level, although frequently there seemed to be no apparent connection between the size of the lake&#x27;s surface area and the weather situation.

Stratigraphy shows that the lake bed has totally dried up at least 100 times since its formation (18,000–14,000 BC). During recent history the lake&#x27;s complete disappearance has been documented in considerable detail on several occasions, e.g. in 1740–1742, 1811–1813, and most recently in 1866, when the private diary of a local, Gottlieb Wenzel, noted that he crossed the bed of the lake on 4 June without soiling his boots. Parts of the lake bed were claimed for agriculture; wheat and turnips were being planted. However, in 1871 the lake began to return and by the spring of 1876 it had already reassumed its usual size. The last (brief and partial) vanishing took place during the summer of 1949 when the northern part of the lake bed (to the approximate latitude of Podersdorf) fell dry for a few weeks. Each time the drying-up of the lake bed caused major environmental disruptions because the humidifying and temperature buffering effect of the large water body was absent, and because the winds blew large amounts of salty dust into the surrounding villages. On earlier occasions the lake was sometimes referred to as a &quot;swamp&quot;, suggesting a very low water level with an expansion of reeds throughout the lake bed. Two records dated to 1318 and 1324, respectively mention a &quot;river&quot;, implying that at this time the lake might have been reduced to a central body of water running from north to south.

Today the water level is controlled by an artificial outflow, the , and a sluice on Hungarian territory near Fertőújlak, and bilateral issues are dealt with by the Austro-Hungarian water commission which was established in 1956. However, comparatively minor fluctuations of the lake&#x27;s level continue to occur. In 1965 the lake gained of water within a single month, raising its level by . The water level decreased to a similar extent, by within one year as a result of the drought of 2003. Both types of events are perfectly within the normal range, and because of the shallowness of the water can be either exacerbated or compensated by the effects of wind pressure, which can temporarily raise or reduce the local water level by as much as . However, the lake remains sensitive to changes in its equilibrium, as recent climate change scenario simulations have shown.
Before the regulation works of the 19th century, the lake extended in the southeast to the marshlands of the Hanság () which have been increasingly drained and claimed for agriculture from the 16th century onward. Originally, the lake was thus closely connected to the Danube and the Rába river systems.

== Nature and wildlife ==
Most of the lake is surrounded by reeds which serve as a habitat for wildlife (making the lake an important resting place for migratory birds) and are harvested in winter as soon as the ice is solid enough. This serves a double purpose, one ecological (removal of the bulk of organic matter that would otherwise decay in the lake) and one economic (the reed is sold for various purposes, mostly related to construction and housing). During the summer months, there are occasional reed fires, as dry reed is easily flammable, and fires spread quickly because of the almost constant wind. Water quality is determined by temperature, wind, and by the amount of salt and mud emanating with the ground water from the sediments.

Several plans for dams and other intrusive construction works which would have destroyed the lake and its biotopes were discussed during the first half of the 20th century but came to nothing. Detailed plans to divide the lake bed with earthworks so that certain parts with reasonably fertile soil could be permanently drained and claimed for agriculture while the remaining parts would be used for intensive aquaculture had been finalized and approved in 1918 but were abandoned when most of the lake became Austrian territory after World War I. In 1971 plans for a bridge across the Austrian part of the lake were thwarted by environmentalists.

In 1993 the National Park Neusiedler See-Seewinkel gained international acceptance as an IUCN Category II preserve. In 2001 the national parks in Austria and Fertő-Hanság in Hungary were together accepted as a World Heritage Site. Lake Neusiedl See and its surrounding areas in Austria also enjoy protection through the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands.

===Mammals===
Over 40 mammal species have been recorded from the area, including the European ground squirrel, the steppe polecat and the European hamster.

===Birds===
In the area over 300 bird species have been recorded with the earliest studies made by the Hungarian naturalist István Fászl. Of these, around 150 breed, representing around 40% of the European and 80% of all Austrian bird species. The area contains one of the largest breeding populations of great egrets, with up to 700 pairs. There are also around 35 pairs of grey heron and 70 pairs of great bustard. One of the best known bird species in the area is the white stork, which is seen as a symbol of the region. Other species present include Eurasian spoonbill, purple heron, eastern imperial eagle, white-tailed eagle, greylag goose, golden oriole, European bee-eater, pied avocet, ruff, Kentish plover, common tern, common redshank, black-tailed godwit, Eurasian curlew, western yellow wagtail, short-eared owl, Montagu&#x27;s harrier and many others which are of interest to local and visiting birdwatchers.

===Fish===
Native fish species include the pike, zander, European carp and wels catfish, alongside numerous minnows, such as stickleback, common bleak, white bream, common bream and ruffe. The European eel is not native to the lake, but was introduced as a food source for humans. Due to environmental concerns, further releases of young eels has been recently banned. The Prussian carp has also been introduced to the lake, alongside the pumpkinseed.

===Amphibians===
The European tree frog is a common species in the area. Other amphibians that can be found, especially in the reed belt and the lakeside edge, include common toad, European green toad, common spadefoot, moor frog, agile frog, pool frog, marsh frog, edible frog and the European fire-bellied toad. Danube crested newt and smooth newt are also present.

===Reptiles===
Reptiles are represented by the grass snake and a number of lizard species including the European green lizard, sand lizard and the common lizard. Occasionally, dice snakes may be seen, but the meadow viper, which was previously identified around the lake, has not been seen since 1973.

== Towns and villages around the lake ==
Traces of human settlement around Lake Neusiedl go back to the neolithic period. The area became densely populated from the 7th century BC onward, initially by people of the Hallstatt culture and remained so throughout Roman times. In 454 Theodoric the Great, the preeminent king of the Ostrogoths, was born here. Near Fertőrákos there are two Roman villas and a 3rd-century Mithras temple open to visitors.

The more important extant towns lying on the lake&#x27;s shore are Illmitz (Illmic), Podersdorf am See (Pátfalu), Weiden (Védeny), Neusiedl am See (Nezsider), Jois (Nyulas), Winden (Sásony), Breitenbrunn (Fertőszéleskút), Purbach am Neusiedlersee (Feketeváros), Donnerskirchen (Fertőfehéregyháza), Oggau (Oka), Rust (Ruszt) and Mörbisch (Fertőmeggyes) in Austria, and Sopron, Fertőrákos, Fertőboz, Fertőd, Balf and Fertőújlak in Hungary, with the communities of Illmitz, Apetlon (Mosonbánfalva) and Podersdorf am See forming the so-called Seewinkel (lake corner), which is located between the lake and the Hungarian border. Hungarian names of Austrian towns lying on the lake&#x27;s shore are given in parentheses.

== Tourism ==
Despite remaining a protected wildlife habitat, the region of Lake Neusiedl, particularly in its Austrian part, draws significant numbers of tourists. The lake is known as the &quot;Sea of the Viennese&quot;, as it offers ample opportunities for sailing and windsurfing at a reasonable distance from Vienna. There is also some commercial fishing.

Low water levels pose a problem for sailing and commercial shipping, as boats hit the ground more frequently and mooring sites can become temporarily unusable. However, it somewhat facilitates the annual freestyle mass crossing of the lake from Mörbisch to Illmitz. Everybody who can swim and is more than in height can participate in this event, which was revived in 2004.
