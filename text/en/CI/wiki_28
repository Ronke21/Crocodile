<text>Alvin Glenn Davis (born September 9, 1960), nicknamed &quot;Mr. Mariner&quot;, is an American former Major League Baseball first baseman and designated hitter. He played eight of his nine seasons for the Seattle Mariners and won the American League Rookie of the Year Award in 1984.

==Early years==
The youngest of four sons, Davis was born and raised in Riverside, California. His father died in 1970. Davis graduated from John W. North High School in 1978. He was selected in the eighth round (189th overall) of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft by the San Francisco Giants, but opted to attend Arizona State University play college baseball for the Arizona State Sun Devils. Davis, who batted left-handed and threw right-handed, was later drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the sixth round (144th overall) of the 1981 Major League Baseball draft, but opted to stay in college and earned a degree in finance.

==Minor league career==
After his senior season at Arizona State in 1982, Davis was drafted in June by the Seattle Mariners in the sixth round (138th overall). He played the rest of the season in Double-A for the Lynn Sailors in the Eastern League, batting .284 with 12 home runs and 56 runs batted in (RBI) in 74 games. Davis continued at that level in 1983 in Tennessee, with the Chattanooga Lookouts in the Southern League. He hit .296 with 18 home runs and 83 RBI in 131 games, and nearly averaged a walk per game.

Davis began the 1984 season in Triple-A, with the Salt Lake City Gulls of the Pacific Coast League. After just one game, he was promoted to the majors, due to a hand injury to Ken Phelps on April 6, and Davis remained with Seattle for eight seasons, through 1991. In that only game for Salt Lake, he went 2-for-3 with an RBI and a walk, and never returned to the minors.

==Major league career==
===Seattle Mariners===
During a nine-year major league career, Davis batted .280 with 160 home runs and 683 RBI in 1,206 career games. He hit 20-plus homers in three seasons, and drove in over 100 runs twice.

Davis holds the Mariners and Major League Baseball record for the most consecutive games reaching base to start a career, with 47. Well-liked by Mariners fans, Davis held most of the young franchise&#x27;s offensive records until the arrival of Ken Griffey Jr., Edgar Martínez, and Alex Rodriguez. His fellow players thought highly of him as well. &quot;You know sooner or later we&#x27;re going to score some runs,&quot; teammate Ed Vande Berg said in 1984. &quot;We have mister everything on the offense – Mr. Alvin Davis.&quot; Tommy John called him a &quot;modern-day George Scott,&quot; explaining, &quot;When Scott first came into the league, no one knew how to pitch to him, and they didn&#x27;t find out for three years.&quot;

Davis made his major league debut in the Kingdome on April 11, 1984; he homered in his first two big league and collected two doubles in his sixth and three doubles in the next. After his first week, Davis had a .370 batting average, a .778 slugging percentage, and a seven-game hitting streak. He reached base in each of the first 47 games of his career, and was chosen for his only All-Star Game as a rookie. Named the Mariners&#x27; MVP, he was also voted the American League&#x27;s Rookie of the Year, with a .284 batting average, 27 home runs, and 116 RBI in 152 games. Davis hit a career-high 29 home runs in 1987, and he had perhaps his best season in 1989, when he finished second in the American League with a .920 OPS.

With the addition of Pete O&#x27;Brien in 1990, Davis was increasingly used as Seattle&#x27;s designated hitter. He only saw action on defense as a first baseman in 52 games that season, further reduced to just 14 games in 1991. His batting average fell to .221 in 1991 with 12 home runs and 69 RBI in 145 games; with young Tino Martinez in the organization, Davis was not in the team&#x27;s plans for 1992.

Davis&#x27; season high for home runs was 29 in 1987 and his most RBI (116) came as a rookie in 1984. His highest batting average for a season was .305 in 1989. Davis hit the last home run in Chicago&#x27;s Comiskey Park on September 29th, 1990.

===California Angels===
After eight years in Seattle, Davis signed a one-year, $800,000 contract with the California Angels on February 14, 1992. In 40 games with the Angels in a platoon role, he hit .250 with no homers and 16 RBI. Davis had two hits in his final major league game, but was released after only a half season in late June. joined the Kintetsu Buffaloes of Osaka in Japan, and appeared in 40 games in the Pacific League, batting .275 with five home runs and 12 RBI.

==Personal life==
Davis lives in his hometown of Riverside with his wife Kim; they have three children. Davis has been a volunteer at Cornerstone Fellowship Bible Church in Riverside, California for the past nine years overseeing the church&#x27;s finances and has served as a member of the church&#x27;s elder board for over 20 years. He has also previously coached baseball at Martin Luther King High School for ten years. After his father&#x27;s death in 1970, Davis and his mother Mylie had a very close relationship, and she relocated from Riverside to Tempe when he was in college.

In 1997, Davis was inducted into the Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame.

In 2012, Davis returned to the Seattle Mariners organization as a roving minor league instructor.

His niece is professional wrestler Candice LeRae.

<text>Seven of One, stylised as 7 of 1, is a British sitcom anthology series that aired on BBC2 in 1973. Starring Ronnie Barker, &quot;Seven of One&quot; is a series of seven separate 30-minute episodes that would serve as possible pilots for sitcoms. Originally it was to be called &quot;Six of One&quot;, which Barker planned to follow up with another series called &quot;And Half a Dozen of the Other&quot;. This was a BBC equivalent of a similar showcase for London Weekend Television called &quot;Six Dates with Barker&quot; created in 1971.

In addition to Barker, &quot;Seven of One&quot; also featured Roy Castle, Bill Maynard, Talfryn Thomas, Prunella Scales, Glynn Edwards, Joan Sims, Keith Chegwin, Leslie Dwyer, Robin Parkinson, Sam Kelly, Christopher Biggins, Richard O&#x27;Callaghan, Yootha Joyce, David Jason, and Avis Bunnage in supporting roles. The series was released on BBC DVD in 2005.

==Episodes==
==Successful pilots==
Whilst most of the pilots were not developed any further, &quot;Prisoner and Escort&quot; was chosen to be developed into a series and became &quot;Porridge&quot; (1974–1977), which also led to a spin-off series called &quot;Going Straight&quot; in 1978, a feature film adaptation of &quot;Porridge&quot; in 1979, and many years later a sequel sitcom &quot;Porridge&quot; (2016–2017).

&quot;Open All Hours&quot; was later developed into a sitcom of the same name, &quot;Open All Hours&quot; (1976, 1981–1982, 1985), and many years later a sequel sitcom named &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot; (2013–2019). Additionally, &quot;My Old Man&quot; also led to a sitcom of the same name, &quot;My Old Man&quot; (1974–1975), which was made by Yorkshire Television and shown nationally on ITV, but not including Barker and instead featuring an entirely new cast led by Clive Dunn.

Ronnie Barker&#x27;s favourite of the seven pilots was &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly You for a Quid&quot;, which he initially chose to do as a series, before being convinced by the BBC that it would be harder to do a full series of scripts about Evan Owen in a Welsh gambling community compared to Norman Stanley Fletcher in the prison setting of &quot;Prisoner and Escort&quot;.

<text>Nilambur is a major town, a municipality and a Taluk in the Malappuram district of the Indian state of Kerala. It is located close to the Nilgiris range of the Western Ghats on the banks of the Chaliyar River. This place is also known as &#x27;Teak Town&#x27; because of the abundance of Nilambur teaks, which is a variety of a large, deciduous tree that occurs in mixed hardwood forests. Unlike many Municipalities of India; Nilambur is covered with large amounts of vegetation, making it very scenic. 

In the British records, Nilambur and its surroundings are collectively described as &quot;Nilambur Valley&quot;. The bank of river Chaliyar at Nilambur region is also known for natural Gold fields. Explorations done at the valley of the river Chaliyar in Nilambur has shown reserves of the order of 2.5 million cubic meters of placers with 0.1 gram per cubic meter of gold. The hilly forested area of Nilambur Taluk forms a portion of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve of rich biodiversity. Nilambur is located about west of Ooty and southwest of Gudalur town, and northeast of Manjeri, on Ooty-Gudalur-Nilambur-Calicut road.

The m high Mukurthi peak, which is situated in the border of Nilambur Taluk and Ooty Taluk, and is also the fifth-highest peak in South India as well as the third-highest in Kerala after Anamudi () and Meesapulimala (), is the highest point of elevation in Malappuram district. It is also the highest peak in Kerala outside the Idukki district. The high Anginda peak, which is located closer to Malappuram-Palakkad-Nilgiris district border is the second-highest peak. Vavul Mala, a high peak situated on the trijunction of Nilambur Taluk of Malappuram, Wayanad, and Thamarassery Taluk of Kozhikode districts, is the third-highest point of elevation in the district. The Nilambur Taluk has several small and medium-sized tributaries of Chaliyar river.

UNESCO has included Nilambur in its Global Network of Learning Cities (GNLC) in recognition of its outstanding efforts to make lifelong learning a reality for all at the local level.

==Etymology==
It is believed that Nilambur was derived from Nilambapuri, the old name of Nilambur Kingdom. 

== History ==
The teaks for the construction of &quot;Uru&quot;, a kind of ships those were used for maritime trade through Beypore port, were usually taken from Nilambur Teak Forests. The oldest teak plantation of the world in the Conolly&#x27;s plot is just from the town. It was named in memory of Henry Valentine Conolly, the then Malabar district collector. Teak Museum at Nilambur is maintained by the Kerala Forest Research Institute which was established for the memory of the oldest known Teak plantation in the world. The town is also famous for Nilambur Kovilakam, where the &quot;Nilambur Rajas&quot; resided and ruled the land. &quot;Nilambur Rajas&quot; were vassals to the Zamorins of Calicut, based at Nilambur.

The Nilambur–Shoranur line is among the shortest as well as picturesque broad gauge railway lines in India. It was laid by the British in colonial era for the transportation of &quot;Nilambur Teak&quot; logs into United Kingdom through Kozhikode. During British rule, Nilambur&#x27;s chief importance laid in producing teaks. In the old administrative records of the Madras Presidency, it is recorded that the most remarkable plantation owned by Government in the erstwhile Madras Presidency was the Teak plantation at Nilambur planted in 1844.

Nilambur Teak is the first forest produce to get its own GI tag.

On 2nd September 2022, Nilambur joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities (GNLC).

<text>The Murg is an 80.2-kilometre-long river (including its headstream, the &quot;Rechtmurg&quot;) and tributary of the Rhine in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It flows through the Northern Black Forest into the Upper Rhine Plain, crossing the counties of Freudenstadt and Rastatt.

== Geography ==
===Course===
The Murg valley is one of the largest and deepest valleys in the Black Forest (up to over 700 metres deep) and generally runs in a northerly direction. It separates the precipitation-rich main crest of the Northern Black Forest, including the Hornisgrinde (1,164 m), to the west, from the densely forested bunter sandstone plateaux in the east.

The Murg originates from 2 large headstreams in the western part of the municipality of Baiersbronn. Below the Schliffkopf at about , the main headstream of the Right Murg (&quot;Rechtmurg&quot;) is formed by the Schurbach stream and Tränkenteich pond, a little above the &quot;Murgursprung&quot; (&quot;Murg Source&quot;). The other western headstream is the Red Murg (&quot;Rotmurg&quot;), whose source is the Red Murg Spring (&quot;Rotmurgbrunnen&quot;, also 915 m) which leaves the pass summit of Ruhestein (915 m) and is fed by brooks such as the &quot;Finsterbächle&quot; and &quot;Muckenbächle&quot;.

From the confluence of its two headstreams at about 595 m the Murg flows southeast through the valley of Mitteltal to Baiersbronn, where it swings into line with the &quot;Forbach&quot; which joins from the south. From here it is followed by the B 462 and the Murg Valley Railway. Initially it runs northeastwards to Klosterreichenbach, but thereafter it heads north-northwest. In the wide Wiesental valley it passes the villages of Röt, Huzenbach and Schönmünzach. After flowing through a narrow, sparsely populated and steep-sided gorge the river passes a rocky section in which are the settlements of Forbach, Gausbach, Langenbrand and Au im Murgtal. In its slowly widening valley, the villages of Weisenbach, Hilpertsau, Obertsrot, Scheuern, the town of Gernsbach and finally the village of Hörden follow in quick succession. Between the now gently rising hillsides the Murg runs northwest through Ottenau, past the industrial town of Gaggenau and the villages of Bad Rotenfels, Oberndorf, Bischweier and Kuppenheim, where it reaches the Upper Rhine Plain. Here it crosses under the A 5 motorway near Niederbühl and, in the area of Rastatt, the B 3, the Rhine Railway the Mannheim–Basel railway &quot;(Rhine Valley Railway)&quot;. Below Rheinau the Murg empties into the Rhine near Steinmauern at about 110 m at Rhine kilometre number 344.5.

On the French side the Sauer from the North Vosges joins the Rhine almost opposite the Murg.

=== Waterbody data ===
From the confluence of its two headstreams (&quot;Rechtmurg&quot; and &quot;Rotmurg&quot;) in Baiersbronn-Obertal to its mouth on the Rhine the Murg is 72.350 km (~ 72.4 km) long. Together with the Rotmurg which rises at the &quot;Rotmurgbrunnen&quot; near Ruhestein it is 79.661 km (~ 79.7 km) long and together with the Rechtmurg which begins on the Schliffkopf at the &quot;Murgursprung&quot; and has a length of 7.881 km it is 80.231 km (~ 80.2 km) long.

The catchment of the Murg covers 617 km2.

In relation to its catchment the Murg has a high volumetric flow (18.4 m3/s). The catchment areas of the Murg headstreams and its tributary, the Schönmünzach, have an area flow rate of 50 L/s.km2, the highest in Baden-Württemberg.

=== Natural regions ===
The Murg flows from south to north through four very different valley landscapes.

* Its upper section in the area of Baiersbronn is a typical Black Forest valley with broad meadow bottoms and villages once dominated by agriculture. Many of the side valleys have a typical trough valley shape with steep sides.
* The middle section of the Murg valley is a lonely, forest gorge with granite crags and a gradient of up to 3.3%, very much like a mountain stream. Until 1918, the Murg, together with the Raumünzach, its biggest tributary, a well known whitewater river due to its weight of water. Since then, the hydroelectric potential of the river has been used in the Murg Power Station. It lies just above Forbach, the main settlement in this part of the valley.
* The lower Murg valley is, like the Wiesental, one of the industrial corridors of the Black Forest. The valley here is over 700 metres deep, initially with a trackless gorge bottom that increasingly broadens and provides room for a settlement strip of numerous villages and towns. Its historic centre is Gernsbach, also the hub of the paper and cardboard industry of the valley; the largest town has become Gaggenau with its tradition-rich motor manufacturing (including Unimog). The river is accompanied in many places by industrial ditches and from Gernsbach-Nord has been almost entirely canalised. Renaturalisation work was carried out at Bischweier in 2011. The aim was to create a near-natural riverbed with differences in current, substrates and depth, so that a variety of habitats could be created for fish and other small creatures. The riverbed here can be left to grow unfettered.
* Near Kuppenheim the Murg enters the Rhine Plain, where it flows around the centre of Rastatt. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries the course of the Murg in the Rhine Valley was canalised. Immediately before its present confluence on the Rhine near Steinmauern the river&#x27;s canal cuts through the wetlands of Rastatt&#x27;s Rhine river meadows. Its confluence was moved about 1.5 kilometres to the northwest in the course of work to straighten the Rhine by Johann Gottfried Tulla.

=== Tributaries ===
The Murg does not flow through the middle of its elongated catchment, but further to the east, so that more and larger tributaries join it from the west than from the east. Its western tributaries included the Tonbach, Schönmünz, Raumünzach and Oos (north branch) and its tributaries from the east include the Forbach and Sasbach.

=== Administrative divisions ===
The old state border between the Kingdom of Württemberg and the Grand Duchy of Baden runs between Baiersbronn-Schönmünzach and Forbach-Kirschbaumwasen. The upper, formerly Württemberg part of the valley belongs today to the county of Freudenstadt. The lower, section, which from the 12th century was ruled by the Ebersteins and later went to Baden, is today part of the county of Rastatt.

=== Towns and villages ===

The following towns and villages lie along the Murg, from source to mouth:
== Dialects ==
Several dialect regions meet one another in the Murg Valley. The area around the upper reaches, around Old Württemberg Baiersbronn, forms the westernmost tip of the Swabian dialect region. The old state border with Baden further downstream is identical with the dialect boundary with Upper Rhine Alemannic, which is strongly defined even today, and which dominates the lower part of the Murg valley. On the lower reaches of the Murg on the Rhine Plain is an Alemannic-Franconian transition dialect with numerous South Franconian dialect features.

==History==
The Murg historically was important for timber rafting. Wood was rafted first as far as Steinmauern, where it was dried and combined into bigger rafts. From Steinmauern the larger rafts were floated down to Mannheim and onward to the Netherlands.

During the last phase of the Baden Revolution of 1849, the Murg formed the last-ditch defence line for the remanats of the revolutionary army. Driven by overwhelmingly numerous Prussian forces out of the capital Karlesruhe and much of Baden&#x27;s territory, the revolutionaries staged a fighting withdrawal to the fortress city of Rastatt. The Murg, directly north and east of Rastatt, formed a defence line which they defended with great tenacity.

== Economy and Infrastructure ==

=== Transport ===
The Murg Valley Railway and the Black Forest Valley Highway (&quot;Bundesstraße 462&quot;) follow the Murg Valley. Both are amongst the most notable transportation routes in Germany for civil engineering and natural beauty.

The gorge-like character of the middle Murg valley was a major obstacle to the development of the transport routes for centuries. The first road from Gernsbach to the upper valley bypassed this section: the Old Wine Road (&quot;Alte Weinstraße&quot;), as the old trading route was called, ran steeply uphill at first and then ran along the heights of the eastern flanks of the valley. It was not until the second half of the 18th century that a continuous road was built along the bottom of the valley.

The construction of the Murg Valley Railway began with independent sections from Rastatt and Freudenstadt. On the Baden side the first section from Rastatt to Gernsbach went into operation in 1869, Württemberg followed in 1901 with the route from Freudenstadt to Klosterreichenbach. After several expansion stages, a continuous railway connexion was finally established in 1928, i.e. 60 years after the start of construction, and only when the respective national railways were under the sovereignty of the German Reich.

=== Timber rafting ===
Until the 19th century, the Murg was an important route for timber rafting in the valley. Timber merchants and sawmill owners in the Eberstein (later Baden) part of the valley merged to form the trading company of the Murg Shipping Association (&quot;Murgerschifferschaft&quot;) whose earliest statutes date to 1488. The logs felled in the middle and lower parts of the Mur valley, were floated down the Murg to Steinmauern, where they were dried and assembled into larger rafts. These were transported by Rhine raftsmen, who had a monopoly on this section, on the Rhine to Mannheim. At Mannheim, even larger floating wooden structures were built, some of which were rafted down to the Netherlands.

In the 18th century, the great demand for logs from the Netherlands led to a boom in the timber trade, which led to extensive clearing of the forests until the end of the century. Instead of the Murg Shipping Association, which specialized in sawn timber and did not have enough capital to manage the log trade, other timber companies took over this business.

The transportation of timber was hampered by the rocky gorge in the middle valley. This section could not be traversed by rafts until 1768. As early as the early 18th century, Wüerttemberg&#x27;s timber trading companies had attempted to create a rafting route by blasting through the rock in the riverbed in order to float the logs from the upper valley down to the Rhine and the Netherlands. However, due to differences with the Bishopric of Speyer in Gernsbach, most of the Württemberg timber at Huzenbach had to be transported about 200 metres up the mountain and then transported to the neighbouring valleys of the Nagold and Enz. For this purpose, a lift called the &quot;machine&quot; was built in 1755. The logs were hoisted up the steep mountain slope using a series of man-powered wheels. However, this rickety structure was abandoned after a few years and the transport was taken over again by wagons.

In order to float the logs from the side valleys into the Murg, splash dams (&quot;Schwallungen&quot;) were built in the forest, such as the Herrenwieser Schwallung, and existing lakes were further impounded to raise their levels.

Rafting became less important after the construction of the Murg Valley Railway. In 1896, the last raft floated down the river Murg. In 1913 the rafting company closed and was officially banned in 1923.

=== Hiking and cycling ===
In 1981, the Murg Valley Trail (&quot;Murgtalwanderweg&quot;) was established, running for approximately 100 kilometres following the course of the Murg from its source to its mouth. The Murgleiter trail runs for 110 km between Gaggenau and Schliffkopf along the heights on the other side of the river. The Gernsbacher Runde explores the heights of the Murg valley near Gernsbach. In Forbach the West Way (Black Forest) crosses the valley as part of the E1 European long distance path.

The 67-kilometre-long cycle route known as the &quot;Tour de Murg&quot;, begins in Freudenstadt and accompanies the river from Baiersbronn to Rastatt.

The Appearance Manager is implemented as an abstraction layer between the Control Manager and QuickDraw. Previously, controls made direct QuickDraw calls to draw user interface elements such as buttons, scrollbars, window title bars, etc. With the Appearance Manager, these elements are abstracted into a series of APIs that draw the item as a distinct entity on behalf of the client code, thus relieving the Control Manager of the task. This extra level of indirection allows the system to support the concept of switchable &quot;themes&quot;, since client code simply requests the image of an interface element (a button or scroll bar, for example) and draws its appearance. Kaleidoscope, a 3rd party application, was the first to utilize this functionality with via &quot;scheme&quot; files, followed by an updated Appearance Control Panel in Mac OS 8.5, which acted similarly via &quot;theme&quot; files. Schemes and themes are similar in concept, but they are not internally compatible.

An updated and more powerful version of the Appearance Manager was used for Carbon applications in Mac OS X even after Apple made the transition to Aqua. The Extras.rsrc file is an updated version of an Appearance Theme that is compatible with the newer Appearance Manager. As of Mac OS X version 10.3, &#x27;layo&#x27; data is no longer used, even for Carbon applications, so the continued existence of the Appearance Manager can no longer be confirmed.

==Appearance themes==

The default look and feel of the Appearance Manager in Mac OS 8 and 9 is Platinum design language, which was intended to be the primary GUI for Copland. Platinum retains many of the shapes and positions of elements from System 7 and earlier, like window control widgets and buttons and while Charcoal is the default system font, Chicago was available via a menu option. However, various shades of grey are used extensively throughout the interface, as opposed to previous interfaces which are mostly monochrome black and white. Apple Platinum is not a theme, however, as it is actually embedded into the Appearance Manager. The Appearance Control Panel has the ability to attach a theme to the Appearance Manager. There is an Apple Platinum file in the themes folder in the System Folder which acts as a stub, but no functional theme elements are embedded into it. Customizable palettes (&#x27;clut&#x27; resources) are used for progress bars, scroll thumbs, slider tabs and menu selections in Apple Platinum and this unique option is not available to real themes. The Appearance Control Panel uses the type code &#x27;pltn&#x27; to identify if a file should act like a palette modification stub to Apple Platinum and the type code &#x27;thme&#x27; to identify if a file should act like an Appearance Theme. An important distinction is that the Appearance &quot;Control Panel&quot; implements themes into the Appearance Manager. Kaleidoscope is third-party software that implements schemes into the Appearance Manager. Kaleidoscope is not a substitute for the Appearance Manager; it is a substitute for the Appearance Control Panel.

Apple widely demonstrated two Appearance Themes which override Apple Platinum, Hi-Tech and Gizmo. Hi-Tech is based on a shades-of-black color scheme that made the interface look like a contemporary piece of audio-visual equipment. Gizmo is a period-appropriate Memphis-style interface, using many bold colors, patterns, and &quot;wiggly&quot; interface elements. Both changed every single element of the overall GUI, leaving no trace of Apple Platinum. A third theme, Drawing Board, was later introduced, developed at Apple Japan. This theme uses elements that make the interface look like it has been drawn in pencil on a drafting board, including small &quot;pencil marks&quot; around the windows, a barely visible graph paper grid on the desktop, and &quot;squarish&quot; elements with low contrast. Although themes are supported in all released versions of Mac OS 8.5 through 9.2.2, the three aforementioned themes were only present in pre-release versions of Mac OS 8.5 and were removed without explanation in the final release.

One retrospective review by a long-time Mac user described the themes as being a mistake and waste of engineering resources, saying the &quot;Hi-Tech&quot; theme &quot;looked like a typical dark over-decorated techno skin that became popular for Linux desktops&quot; and that &quot;Gizmo&quot; looked &quot;awful...the Finder in a clown suit&quot;.

==Typography==

By default, a font called Charcoal is used to replace the similar Chicago typeface that was used in earlier versions of the Mac OS. A number of additional system fonts are also provided, including Capitals, Gadget, Sand, Techno, and Textile. In order to be a system font, glyphs specific to the Mac operating system need to be provided, such as the Command key symbol (⌘). System fonts are normally displayed at 12 points.

Later versions of the Appearance Manager also apply anti-aliasing to type displayed on the screen above a certain size, by default . This improves the overall look of the text by reducing the perception of rasterization artifacts. Anti-aliasing is adjustable in the Appearance Control Panel.

==Shareware products==
Shareware products exist that provided some features of the Appearance Manager before they were offered directly in the Appearance Control Panel. Church Windows and Décor provide desktop picture functionality. WindowShade, which had been purchased by Apple and bundled with System 7.5, provides collapse functionality. When windows collapse, they &quot;roll up&quot;, leaving only the title bar.

===Kaleidoscope===
Kaleidoscope, written by Arlo Rose and Greg Landweber, applied &quot;schemes&quot; to the GUI before Apple released an update to the Appearance Control Panel with Mac OS 8.5 which provides similar functionality using &quot;themes&quot;. Whereas only a handful of themes were ever developed, thousands of Kaleidoscope schemes were developed.

When theme support in the Appearance Control Panel was first announced, the team responsible for it demonstrated an automatic tool specifically designed to convert the tens of thousands of existing Kaleidoscope scheme files into Appearance Manager-compatible theme files. This tool was not released to the public; however, a similar tool has been developed.

Kaleidoscope remained the primary theming platform, even after the Appearance Control Panel offered theming capabilities in Mac OS 8.5. Steve Jobs returned to Apple just before the release of Mac OS 8.5, and he decided to officially drop support for themes because he wanted to preserve a consistent user interface. Because of this, Apple released little documentation for the theme format, withheld their own beta-released themes, and even issued a cease and desist notice to the authors of a third-party theme editor on grounds that it was intended to allow users to create themes that imitate the Aqua interface in Mac OS X. At the same time, the format of Kaleidoscope schemes continued to evolve. As a result, Kaleidoscope schemes proliferated while Appearance themes never really took off. Kaleidoscope was only rendered obsolete with the transition to Mac OS X, with which Kaleidoscope is not compatible.

<text>The gens Licinia was a celebrated plebeian family at ancient Rome, which appears from the earliest days of the Republic until imperial times, and which eventually obtained the imperial dignity. The first of the gens to obtain the consulship was Gaius Licinius Calvus Stolo, who, as tribune of the plebs from 376 to 367 BC, prevented the election of any of the annual magistrates, until the patricians acquiesced to the passage of the &quot;lex Licinia Sextia&quot;, or Licinian Rogations. This law, named for Licinius and his colleague, Lucius Sextius, opened the consulship for the first time to the plebeians. Licinius himself was subsequently elected consul in 364 and 361 BC, and from this time, the Licinii became one of the most illustrious gentes in the Republic.

==Origin==
The nomen &quot;Licinius&quot; is derived from the cognomen &quot;Licinus&quot;, or &quot;upturned&quot;, found in a number of Roman gentes. &quot;Licinus&quot; may have been an ancient praenomen, but few examples of its use as such are known. The name seems to be identical with the Etruscan &quot;Lecne&quot;, which frequently occurs on Etruscan sepulchral monuments. Some scholars have seen evidence of an Etruscan origin for the Licinii in the tradition that Etruscan players were first brought to Rome to take part in the theatrical performances (&quot;ludi scaenici&quot;) in the consulship of Gaius Licinius Calvus, BC 364. This could, however, be coincidental, as Livy explains that the games were instituted this year in order to palliate the anger of the gods. In fact, the name of &quot;Licinius&quot; appears to have been spread throughout both Latium and Etruria from a very early time, so the fact that it had an Etruscan equivalent does not definitely show that the gens was of Etruscan derivation.

==Praenomina==
The chief praenomina used by the Licinii were &quot;Publius, Gaius, Lucius&quot;, and &quot;Marcus&quot;, all of which were very common throughout Roman history. The family occasionally used &quot;Sextus&quot;, and there is at least one instance of &quot;Gnaeus&quot; during the first century BC. &quot;Aulus&quot; was used by the Licinii Nervae. As in other Roman families, the women of the Licinii generally did not have formal praenomina, but were referred to simply as &quot;Licinia&quot;; if further distinction were needed, they would be described using various personal or family cognomina.

==Branches and cognomina==
The family-names of the Licinii are &quot;Calvus&quot; (with the agnomina &quot;Esquilinus&quot; and &quot;Stolo&quot;), &quot;Crassus&quot; (with the agnomen &quot;Dives&quot;), &quot;Geta, Lucullus, Macer, Murena, Nerva, Sacerdos&quot;, and &quot;Varus&quot;. The other cognomina of the gens are personal surnames, rather than family-names; these include &quot;Archias, Caecina, Damasippus, Imbrex, Lartius, Lenticula, Nepos, Proculus, Regulus, Rufinus, Squillus&quot;, and &quot;Tegula&quot;. The only cognomina which occur on coins are &quot;Crassus, Macer, Murena, Nerva&quot;, and &quot;Stolo&quot;. A few Licinii are known without a surname; most of these in later times were freedmen.

The surname &quot;Calvus&quot; was originally given to a person who was bald, and it was the cognomen of the earliest family of the Licinii to distinguish itself under the Republic. The first of this family bore the agnomen &quot;Esquilinus&quot;, probably because he lived on the Esquiline Hill. &quot;Stolo&quot;, a surname given to the most famous of the family, may be derived from the &quot;stola&quot;, a long outer garment or cloak, or might also refer to a branch, or sucker. Although the family of the Licinii Calvi afterward vanished into obscurity, the surname &quot;Calvus&quot; was later borne by the celebrated orator and poet Gaius Licinius Macer, who lived in the first century BC. His cognomen &quot;Macer&quot;, designated someone who was lean.

Another family of the Licinii bore the cognomen &quot;Varus&quot;, which means &quot;crooked, bent,&quot; or &quot;knock-kneed.&quot; The Licinii Vari were already distinguished, when their surname was replaced by that of &quot;Crassus.&quot; This was a common surname, which could mean &quot;dull, thick,&quot; or &quot;solid,&quot; and may have been adopted because of the contrast between this meaning and that of &quot;Varus&quot;.

The surname &quot;Dives&quot;, meaning &quot;rich&quot; or &quot;wealthy,&quot; was borne by some of the Licinii Crassi. It was most famous as the surname of Marcus Licinius Crassus, the triumvir, and has been ascribed to his father and brothers, but it is not altogether certain whether it originated with his father, or with the triumvir, in which case it was retroactively applied to the previous generation.

&quot;Lucullus&quot;, the cognomen of a branch of the Licinii, which first occurs in history towards the end of the Second Punic War, is probably derived from &quot;lucus&quot;, a grove, or perhaps a diminutive of the &quot;praenomen Lucius&quot;. The surname does not appear on any coins of the gens.

A family of the Licinii bore the surname &quot;Murena&quot; (sometimes, but erroneously, written &quot;Muraena&quot;), referring to the sea-fish known as the murry or lamprey, a prized delicacy since ancient times. This family came from the city of Lanuvium, to the southeast of Rome, and was said to have acquired its name because one of its members had a great liking for lampreys, and built tanks for them. The same surname occurring in other families might be said to be derived from the type of shellfish known as &quot;murex&quot;, from which a valuable dye was extracted.

Of the other surnames of the Licinii might be mentioned &quot;Nerva&quot;, the surname of a family of the Licinii that flourished from the time of the Second Punic War until the early Empire, derived from &quot;nervus&quot;, &quot;sinewy&quot;; &quot;Geta&quot;, perhaps the name of a Thracian people, to whom one of the Licinii might have been compared; and &quot;Sacerdos&quot;, a priest, one of a number of cognomina derived from occupations.

==Members==
===Early Licinii===
* Gaius Licinius, one of the first tribunes of the plebs elected, in 493 BC. He and his colleague, Lucius Albinius Paterculus, are said to have elected three others, although according to Dionysius, all five were elected by the people.
* Publius Licinius, one of the first &quot;tribuni plebis&quot; in 493 BC. According to Dionysius he was elected by the people, although according to Livy he was one of three chosen by his colleagues.
* Spurius Licinius, according to Livius &quot;tribunus plebis&quot; in 481 BC, although Dionysius gives his nomen as &quot;Icilius&quot;. Dionysius may be correct, as the praenomen &quot;Spurius&quot; was not used by any other members of the &quot;gens Licinia&quot;.

===Licinii Calvi===
* Publius Licinius P. f. Calvus, father of the elder Esquilinus.
* Publius Licinius P. f. P. n. Calvus Esquilinus, &quot;tribunus militum consulari potestate&quot; in 400 BC; according to Livius, one of the first plebeians elected to this office, although some of the consular tribunes in 444 and 422 may also have been plebeians.
* Publius Licinius P. f. P. n. Calvus Esquilinus, &quot;tribunus militum consulari potestate&quot; in 396 BC, substituted for his father, who had been elected for the second time, but declined the office on account of his advanced age.

He was probably consul in either 364 or 361, but he has been confused with his contemporary, Gaius Licinius Calvus Stolo.
* Gaius Licinius C. f. P. n. Calvus, surnamed &quot;Stolo&quot;, one of the two &quot;tribuni plebis&quot; who brought forward the &quot;lex Licinia Sextia&quot;, and who accordingly was elected consul in either 364 or 361 BC, or perhaps in both years.
* Licinius Calvus (Stolo), the son of Gaius Licinius Stolo, with whom he held a thousand Iugera of land, causing his father to be prosecuted for breaking his own regulations regarding land ownership.

<text>The House of Representatives of Puerto Rico () is the lower house of the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico, the bicameral territorial legislature of Puerto Rico. The House, together with the Senate, control the legislative branch of the government of Puerto Rico.

The structure and responsibilities of the House are defined in Article III of the Constitution of Puerto Rico, which vests all legislative power in the Legislative Assembly. Every bill must be passed by the Senate and by the House, and signed by the governor in order to become law.

The House has exclusive power to initiate impeachments and bring an indictment. The constitution also establishes that the appointment of the Secretary of State and the Comptroller require the advice and consent of the House, with all other appointments confirmed by the Senate alone. Financially, all bills for raising revenue must originate in the House.

Structurally, the House is normally composed of 51 members. Forty are elected from single-member districts across the commonwealth (with one representative per district), elected through Single-member Plurality while 11 are elected at-large through Single non-transferable voting.

The House has been meeting since 1900, after the enactment of the Foraker Act established the body formally.

The House of Representatives, along with its members and staff, is housed in the western half of the Capitol of Puerto Rico, namely in the Ernesto Ramos Antonini House Annex Building, the Antonio R. Barceló Building, and the Luis A. Ferré Building.
== History ==
Created in 1900 as the House of Delegates under the Foraker Act, the lower body of the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly was the only elected body until the Senate was created in 1917 under the Jones-Shafroth Act, then creating a bicameral legislature.

The House of Delegates was controlled by the Republican Party from its creation in 1900 through 1904. In January 1905, the House switched to control by the Union Party, which would remain in power until 1924. A coalition of the Republican Party and Socialist Party of Puerto Rico controlled the House until 1944, save for a brief period from 1941 to 1943 of the Popular Democratic Party.

After the Popular Democratic Party&#x27;s landslide victory in 1944, that party controlled the House until 1969, when the New Progressive Party won the House and the governorship, but not the Senate, creating Puerto Rico&#x27;s first split government. Ángel Viera Martínez, a former prosecutor and freshman representative from San Juan, was elected to the first of three stints as Speaker.

In 1973, the Popular Democratic Party reacquired control of the House but was ousted as the majority party in the 1976 elections, won by the New Progressive Party. Viera Martínez was elected in 1977, to his second stint as Speaker.

As a result of the 1980 elections, the New Progressive Party had won 26 seats and the Popular Democratic Party 25, but the latter challenged the results of the 35th Representative District, creating a tie with each party holding 25 seats, pending the final results of that district. Since the new House in 1981 was tied, it was unable to elect a Speaker, as required, by an absolute majority. To complicate matters, Ramón Muñiz (PDP-32nd District) died on the House floor in January 1981 and Representative-elect Fernando Tonos Florenzán&#x27;s election was invalidated due to him not having the Constitutionally required 25 years to serve in the House, leaving the House with 25 New Progressives and 23 Popular Democrats. House Secretary Cristino Bernazard, who normally would have presided over the House only until it elected its new Speaker in its inaugural session, became the first unelected Acting Speaker of the House. During Bernazard&#x27;s incumbency, he appointed co-chairs to the House standing committees and required that all House decisions and legislation be approved by consensus. After some political wrangling, in what became known as the Viera-Colberg Pact, the House elected Viera Martínez once again as Speaker for the remainder of 1981 and maverick Popular Democratic Rep. Severo Colberg Ramírez as Speaker from 1982 until 1984. In late 1981, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Popular Democratic candidate in the 35th District, and with the Popular Democrats finally filling in the two vacancies they had, that party gained control of the House, with a majority of 26.

Even though the Popular Democratic Party retained the House in the 1984 general elections, Colberg decided to comply with a party commitment and endorse a new Speaker, José Ronaldo &quot;Rony&quot; Jarabo who served as Speaker from 1985 to 1992. Jarabo was defeated in a primary in 1992, and as the New Progressive Party won the 1992 general elections, he was succeeded by the first woman Speaker, Zaida Hernandez Torres, who served until 1996, when she left the House to run for Mayor of San Juan.

Hernandez&#x27;s Speaker pro Tempore, Edison Misla Aldarondo, became Speaker in 1997. After he left office in 2000, he was convicted of corruption charges in federal and state courts. He was succeeded in office by Carlos Vizcarrondo during the 2001–2004 term.

In 2005, as a Popular Democratic governor took office, the New Progressive Party controlled the Senate and the House, and José Aponte Hernández, a loyalist of former Governor Pedro Rosselló, was elected as Speaker of the House. In addition to the tension with the executive branch, Aponte&#x27;s term was tinged with greater-than-average tension with the Senate, in which his support for Rossello&#x27;s bid to oust Senate President Kenneth McClintock, whom he called a &quot;traitor&quot; to his party, took him to lead over 20 New Progressive representatives to converge on the Senate floor in opposition to McClintock&#x27;s permanence as Senate President, considered by many the all-time historical low-point in Senate–House relations.

Aponte was defeated for re-election as Speaker in the House caucus held after the 2008 general elections, and Jenniffer A. González Colón became the Speaker, taking office on 12 January 2009.

The current Speaker, as of 2021, is Rafael Hernández Montañez.

== Functions ==
The House of Representatives, along with the Senate of Puerto Rico, are in charge of the legislative power of the Government of Puerto Rico.

The House has exclusive power to initiate impeachment proceedings and, with the concurrence of two-thirds of the total number of members of which it is composed, to bring an indictment. The Constitution also establishes that all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House. The appointment of the Secretary of State shall in addition require the advice and consent of the House.

== Membership ==

=== Qualifications ===
Article III of the Constitution of Puerto Rico states that no person can be a member of the House of Representatives unless the candidate:
* is capable of reading and writing in either Spanish or English;
* is a citizen of the United States;
* is a citizen of Puerto Rico;
* has resided in Puerto Rico for at least two years immediately prior to the date of his election or appointment; and,
* is over twenty-five years of age.

=== Elections ===
Elections to the House are held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday of November, along with the elections for governor, resident commissioner, the Senate, the mayors, and the municipal assemblies. The last election was held on 3 November 2020 where the members of the 31st House of Representatives of Puerto Rico House of Representatives of Puerto Rico were elected. The next election is scheduled for 5 November 2024 where the members of the 30th House of Representatives of Puerto Rico will be elected. Members of the House are elected for a four-years term.

Only American citizens (including Puerto Ricans) that meet all the following requirements may vote for representatives:
* must legally reside in Puerto Rico,
* must be at least 18 years old by the date of the election,
* must have been qualified by the Puerto Rico State Commission on Elections before the election or on the very same day of the election after he presents himself to his nearest place of voting and shows proper documentation, and
* must have not been declared mentally incapacitated by court.

Citizens cast their votes in colleges () which are simply usually the nearest public school to where the voter declared as residence. Votes are required by law to be cast in secret, unless the citizen has a physical impairment that does not allow him to. Those citizens unable to travel to colleges due to medical impairments may vote at their place of residence (homes, elder homes, etc.) or wherever they are convalescing (hospitals, clinics, etc.). In both of these extraordinary cases, officials from the Puerto Rico State Commission on Elections will provide aid so that the citizens can cast their vote—either by using verbal or non-verbal communication—with members from the different political parties required to observe the process in order to ensure accuracy, fairness, transparency, order, and legitimacy.

Ballots are redacted in both English and Spanish regardless of whether English is an official language or not.

To elect the members of the House, Puerto Rico is divided into forty (40) representative districts that do not follow a particular pattern; they are strictly based on a similar number of inhabitants. These districts are in turn divided into one or more precincts: an electoral division which, in turn, is constituted by colleges. For each district, citizens may vote only for one candidate from the district in which they declared residence by first-past-the-post. District representatives are expected to give priority to matters related to the district they represent but are not required to do so by law.

In addition, citizens are allowed to vote for one candidate at-large of their preference by single non-transferable vote. The eleven at-large candidates with the majority of votes serve as representatives at-large alongside the district representatives with the same powers and rights. Representatives at-large are expected to serve any individual or group but are not required to do so by law; they also serve as a mechanism for citizens who do not wish to channel their affairs through their district representative for whatever reason.

=== Term ===
Representatives serve terms of four years each. A member who has been elected, but not yet seated, is called a &quot;representative-elect&quot;; a member who has been appointed to a seat, but not yet seated, is called a &quot;representative-designate&quot;. The Puerto Rico Constitution does not provide for term limits.

=== Salary and benefits ===
The annual salary for full-time work of each representative is $73,775 USD annually, except for the Speaker which receives $110,663, and the Speaker pro tempore, the Majority and Minority Leaders, the Majority and Minority Whips, and the presidents of the Commission on Government and the Commission on Treasury which receive $84,841 each.

Representatives are allowed to generate additional income from outside their legislative employment subject to restrictions, and only the representatives which do not receive an annual salary are entitled to additional benefits such as per diem or car allowance. Costs associated to traveling outside of Puerto Rico is reimbursed. Cost-of-living adjustments have been frozen since 2005. All representatives qualify for the same retirement and health benefits as of all other employees of the government of Puerto Rico.

In addition, all representatives are provided with office space, secretarial services, advisors, support personnel, office supplies, and stationery. Hiring of personnel working directly for each representative is at the discretion of each representative. Rather than providing these resources and services directly, representatives are instead assigned a budget from which they retrieve funds to cover such costs. Representatives that preside commissions are assigned larger budgets than those who do not, thus creating a difference between the budgets assigned to representatives from the party holding a majority in the House versus the ones in minority as majority representatives tend to be the ones who preside commissions.

== Majority and minority parties ==
The &quot;Majority party&quot; is the political party that holds a majority of seats. The next-largest party is known as the minority party. The president &quot;pro tempore&quot;, committee chairs, and some other officials are generally from the majority party.

Section 9 of Article III of the Constitution of Puerto Rico states that should a Party control more than two-thirds of the seats in the House of Representatives, the losing candidates with the most percentage of votes will be given seats in the Legislature until the total of minority members reaches seventeen (17). In order to qualify to a Section 9 seat, the candidates must belong to a party that received a minimum number of votes in the General Elections of that year.

== Officers ==
The House is served by several officers with and without voting powers, and elected from within and outside its ranks. Of these, only the Speaker was established by the Constitution; all other officers were established by internal rules adopted by each session of the House. Only the Speaker, Speaker &quot;pro tempore&quot;, the Majority and Minority Leaders, and the Majority and Minority Whips have voting powers as all are elected from within. Non-voting officers are elected from outside House ranks and simply assist in internal procedures and clerical tasks, and in the observance of internal rules, laws, and the Constitution. Typical non-voting officers include the Secretary, the Sergeant-at-Arms, and other officers appointed by the different commissions as part of their own internal affairs.

=== Speaker ===

The Speaker of the House is the highest-ranking officer and the presiding officer of the House. The post was created by Article III of the Constitution of Puerto Rico which establishes that, &quot;[...]the House of Representatives [shall elect] a Speaker from among [its] members.&quot; The Speaker is substituted by the Speaker &quot;pro tempore&quot; in his absence. Its counterpart in the Senate is the President.

The current Speaker is Carlos Johnny Méndez, representative District 36 from the New Progressive Party.

=== Speaker pro tempore ===
The Speaker &quot;pro tempore&quot; is the second-highest-ranking officer of the House of Representatives and substitutes the Speaker of the House in his absence. Its counterpart in the Senate is the President pro tempore.

The current Speaker &quot;pro tempore&quot; is José &quot;Conny&quot; Varela, representative at-large from the PDP.

=== Party leaders ===

Each party elects floor leaders denominated &quot;Majority leader&quot; or &quot;Minority leader&quot;, accordingly, as well as a &quot;Majority Whip&quot; or a &quot;Minority Whip&quot;. Floor leaders act as the party chief spokespeople. The current leaders are Majority Leader Ángel Matos García, Majority Whip Roberto Rivera Ruiz de Porras, and Minority Leaders are Carlos &quot;Johnny&quot; Méndez (PNP), Mariana Nogales Molinelli (MVC), Denis Márquez Lebrón (PIP), and Lisie Burgos Muñiz (PD).

=== Non-member officers ===
The House is served by several officials who are not members.

The Senate&#x27;s chief administrative officer is the Secretary of the House, who maintains public records, disburses salaries, monitors the acquisition of stationery and supplies, and oversees clerks. The Secretary automatically presides over the House in the interim, once the term of the incumbent Speaker is finished, but before the House elects a new Speaker.

Another official is the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House who maintains order and security on the Senate premises as the Senate&#x27;s chief law enforcement officer.

This officers are elected by the Senate, usually during its inaugural session, immediately after the election of the body&#x27;s. The current Secretary is Elizabeth Stuart Villanueva while the current Sergeant-At-Arms is Henry Tallaboa Collazo.

<text>The Tour of Britain is a multi-stage cycling race, conducted on British roads, in which participants race across Great Britain to complete the race in the fastest time.

The event dates back to the first British stage races held just after the Second World War. Since then, various different events have been described as the Tour of Britain, including the Milk Race, the Kellogg&#x27;s Tour of Britain and the PruTour.

The most recent version of the Tour of Britain began in 2004 as part of the UCI Europe Tour. From 2014, the race was rated 2.HC by the UCI. The race became part of the new UCI ProSeries in 2020.

==Tour of Britain (1945–1999)==

===Origins===
The Tour of Britain has its origins in a dispute between cyclists during the Second World War. The British administrative body, the National Cyclists&#x27; Union (NCU), had feared since the 19th century that massed racing on the roads would endanger all racing, including early-morning time trials and, originally, the very place of cyclists on the road.

A race organised from Llangollen to Wolverhampton on 7 June 1942, in defiance of the NCU, led to its organisers and riders being banned. They formed a new body, the British League of Racing Cyclists (BLRC), which wanted not only massed racing but a British version of the Tour de France.

The first multi-day stage race in Britain was the Southern Grand Prix in Kent in August 1944. It was won by Les Plume of Manchester. The first stage was won by Percy Stallard, the organiser of the Llangollen-Wolverhampton race in 1942.

The experience encouraged the BLRC to run a bigger race, the Victory Cycling Marathon, to celebrate the end of the war in 1945. It ran from Brighton to Glasgow in five stages and was won by Robert Batot of France, with Frenchmen taking six of the top 10 places, the mountains competition and best team.

Chas Messenger, a BLRC official and historian, said: &quot;No one had ever put on a stage race in this country, other than the Southern Grand Prix, and even fewer people had even seen one. So raw were they that Jimmy Kain (the organiser) even wrote to the Auto-Cycle Union – the body for motorcycle racing – and the flags used by them were taken as a guide to what was needed. Kain recalled the precarious budget: &quot;£44 entry fees and £130 of my own money and £16 when I went round with the hat after the Bradford stage.&quot;

The writer Roger St Pierre said:
:&quot;It was reported that 20,000 watched the start but I&#x27;ve seen a picture which would indicate it was probably three or four times that number. What outsiders didn&#x27;t see though was just what a ramshackle affair it all was, with riders finishing stages often miles longer than billed then having to find a bed for the night – with the poorer riders ending up spending the night huddled in barns, haylofts or even under the hedgerows.&quot;

The BLRC was not recognised by the world governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale and so it recruited its French riders from another rebel organisation, the communist Fédération Sportive et Gymnastique du Travail, using French café-owners in Soho, London, as their link.

===Sponsors and politics===
The Victory Cycling Marathon was run on what little money the BLRC could raise. Riders stayed in cheap boarding houses and officials used their own cars. In 1947, the &quot;News of the World&quot; gave £500 to the race, by then called Brighton-Glasgow. Within a year it pulled out again, concerned by the internal arguments that had bedevilled the BLRC from the start. The 1950 race was sponsored by &quot;Sporting Record&quot;, another newspaper, followed by the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in 1951.

The cycling official John Dennis said in 2002:
:&quot;The most effective sponsor of the Tour of Britain (the &quot;Daily Express&quot;) was lost as a result of the constant bickering between rival officials and organisations. I was the press officer to the &quot;Express&quot; publicity director, Albert Asher, and saw it all happen. He was upset by the petty disagreements and decided to support the new Formula 1 motor-racing instead.&quot;

Sponsorship was taken up by the makers of Quaker Oats in 1954, and then in 1958 by the Milk Marketing Board.

===The Milk Race ===

The Milk Marketing Board (MMB) was a sales monopoly for dairy farmers in England and Wales. A semi-professional cyclist from Derby, Dave Orford, asked the MMB to pay for &quot;Drink more milk&quot; to be embroidered on the jersey of every semi-professional, or independent, rider in the country. The MMB could then advertise that races had been won because of the properties of milk and the winner would receive a £10 bonus as a result.

Orford met the MMB&#x27;s publicity officer, Reg Pugh, at the board&#x27;s headquarters in Thames Ditton, west of London. Orford said: &quot;At the end of the discussion he stated that the MMB would prefer to sponsor a major international marathon. So the Milk Race, the Tour of Britain, was born, starting in 1958 and lasting for 35 years, the longest cycle sponsorship in the UK ever.&quot; A tie-in video game, &quot;Milk Race&quot;, was released in 1987.

The first two races were open to semi-professionals but from 1960 until 1984 it was open only to amateurs. From 1985 until 1993 it was open to both amateurs and professionals. The Milk Race ended in 1993 because the MMB was wound up with the passing of the UK&#x27;s Agriculture Act 1993.

In May 2013 the &quot;Milk Race&quot; name was revived for an annual one-day criterium in Nottingham, with elite men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s races. The event is organised by Race Director Tony Doyle and sponsored by the Dairy Council and the Milk Marketing Forum.

===Kellogg&#x27;s Tour and PruTour===
The professional Kellogg&#x27;s Tour of Britain ran for eight editions from 1987 to 1994. This tour, particularly in its early years, was characterised by very long hilly stages, a typical example being the Newcastle upon Tyne to Manchester stage via the Yorkshire Dales in the 1987 event. The Prudential plc-sponsored PruTour (1998–1999) ran twice. Concerns about safety during the races contributed to both events&#x27; demise through the withdrawal of sponsorship; in the case of the Kellogg&#x27;s Tour this followed a member of the public driving head-on into the peloton in the Lake District, and in the case of the PruTour a police motorcyclist being killed in a collision with a motorist near Worcester.

===Winners===

==Tour of Britain (from 2004)==
After a five-year hiatus, the Tour of Britain returned in 2004. It began as a five-stage race before increasing to six days in 2005, seven in 2007 and eventually an eight-stage race in 2008. It is a professional men&#x27;s race, typically attracting between 10 and 12 UCI WorldTeams, as well as a handful of UCI ProTeams, four British-registered UCI Continental Teams and a Great Britain national squad which often comprises riders from British Cycling&#x27;s Senior Academy programme.

===History===

===2004===

The 2004 Tour of Britain was the first edition of the modern incarnation of the race. It took place over five days between Wednesday 1 – Sunday 5 September, organised by Surrey-based SweetSpot Group in collaboration with the BCF (British Cycling Federation). It was the first Tour of Britain to be held since 1999. SweetSpot MD Hugh Roberts and race director Mick Bennett, who were behind the event&#x27;s return, are still involved with the race in 2020.

Sponsored by the Regional Development Agencies, it attracted teams such as T-Mobile and U.S. Postal Service. It was designated a 2.3 category race on the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) calendar. Highlights of the event were shown as part of BBC&#x27;S Grandstand programme a week after the final stage.

The tour climaxed with a criterium in London, where an estimated 100,000 spectators saw a long break by Bradley Wiggins last until the penultimate lap, before Enrico Degano of Team Barloworld took the sprint on the line. The Colombian Mauricio Ardila, of Chocolade Jacques, won the General Classification.

===2005===

The 2005 race was run as a UCI 2.1 category in six stages starting in Glasgow on Tuesday 30 August and finishing in London on Sunday 4 September. British rider Roger Hammond took victory in Blackpool on stage two, becoming the first home rider to win a stage of the modern race. However, the overall title was won by Belgian rider Nick Nuyens, who is only one of two riders to have led the modern race from start to finish.

Future Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas and Mark Cavendish both made their first appearances in the race during the 2005 Tour; Thomas placed 42nd overall, Cavendish (who finished third in Blackpool on stage two and sixth in Nottingham two days later) 84th.

===2006===

The 2006 Tour of Britain took place from Tuesday 29 August to Sunday 3 September as a UCI category 2.1 event. Martin Pedersen and Andy Schleck of Team CSC won the overall and King of the Mountains classification, respectively. Mark Cavendish (T-Mobile Team) won the points classification and Johan van Summeren (Davitamon–Lotto) the sprints classification. Like Nuyens in 2005, Pedersen topped the overall standings from start to finish. The race&#x27;s final stage, held between Greenwich Park and The Mall, was televised live on BBC&#x27;s Grandstand, making it the first and only stage to enjoy such coverage between 2004 and 2011.

===2007===

The 2007 Tour of Britain was extended to seven days, with the extra day being used to run a stage in Somerset for the first time. Instead of finishing in London, the 2007 race started in London and finished in Glasgow, which used the event to boost its bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games. French rider Romain Feillu won overall by just 0.49 seconds over Spaniard (and stage four winner in Bradford) Adrián Palomares. His victory margin remains the smallest in modern race history. Mark Cavendish won the race&#x27;s opening two stages (a 2.5 km prologue at Crystal Palace Park and in Southampton) as well as the points competition, while Yorkshire&#x27;s Ben Swift won the mountains competition.

===2008===

The tour increased by yet another day for 2008, with eight stages scheduled, from Sunday 7 to Sunday 14 September. The race began in London and finished in Liverpool. ITV4 broadcast the race for the first time, with each stage enjoyed hour-long highlight shows presented by Ned Boulting. As per compatriot Romain Feillu in 2007, overall champion Geoffroy Lequatre claimed the victory despite not winning a single stage of the Tour. Italian rider Alessandro Petacchi and future champion Edvald Boasson Hagen both won three stages apiece; Petacchi triumphed in London (stage one), Gateshead (six) and Liverpool (eight), while Boasson Hagen was first across the line in Stoke-on-Trent (stage four), Dalby Forest (five) and Drumlanrig Castle (seven).

===2009===

The sixth edition, the 2009 Tour of Britain, was also raced over eight days, Saturday 12 to Saturday 19 September. The race started in Scunthorpe and finished in London. Boasson Hagen was the dominant overall winner, claiming a record four-consecutive stage victories (in Peebles, Blackpool, Stoke-on-Trent and Bideford) en route to the title. In his first season as a pro, Katusha–Alpecin rider Ben Swift memorably took his maiden career victory ahead of team-mate Filippo Pozzato in Yeovil.

===2010===

The 2010 edition of the Tour of Britain was held from Saturday 11 to Saturday 18 September and was won by Michael Albasini. His winning margin of 65 seconds over Slovenian rider Borut Božič is the largest in modern race history. Albasini laid the foundations of his victory by winning in Swansea on stage three; that day&#x27;s route included two ascents of the city&#x27;s famed Constitution Hill, a 300-metre cobbled climb that averages a gradient of 19.3%. Team Sky made their race debut in the 2010 Tour, winning stage two in Stoke-on-Trent with New Zealander Greg Henderson. While the race finished in London for the fifth time in seven editions, the 2010 Tour finale took place around ExCeL London owing to a clash with the Pope&#x27;s visit to London, which meant that the centre of the city was out of bounds to the race on the orders of the police and security services.

===2011===

The 2011 Tour of Britain was held from Sunday 11 to Sunday 18 September. Stage two, scheduled to take place between Kendal and Carlisle, was cancelled due to bad weather. It remains the only stage of the modern race not to run as planned. The general classification was won by Dutch rider Lars Boom. This edition of the race outlined the event&#x27;s growing stature on the international cycling calendar, as Thor Hushovd became only the second reigning UCI road world champion to win a stage of the race wearing the iconic Rainbow Jersey when he triumphed in Caerphilly on stage four. Furthermore, Mark Cavendish returned to the race for the first time since the 2007 Tour of Britain less than two months after he won the Points classification in the Tour de France. The Manxman won the opening stage in Dumfries and London circuit race finale; he also set up HTC–Highroad team-mate Mark Renshaw to win in Exmouth on day five.

===2012===

The 2012 Tour of Britain was held from Sunday 9 to Sunday 16 September. With the British public&#x27;s interest in cycling high off the back of Bradley Wiggins&#x27; victory in that summer&#x27;s Tour de France and the London 2012 Olympic Games, the final two hours of each stage during the 2012 race were shown live on ITV4 and Eurosport.

Jonathan Tiernan-Locke originally won the event, the first British rider to do so since its relaunch. In 2014, following investigation for biological passport irregularities, Tiernan-Locke was banned for two years and stripped of his 2012 title. The race was retrospectively awarded to Australia&#x27;s Nathan Haas, riding for the Garmin–Sharp team. Mark Cavendish, in his last race as World Champion, won three stages including the final stage in an uphill sprint up Guildford&#x27;s cobbled high street. Tour de France 2012 winner, Bradley Wiggins was forced to pull out of the Tour after stage 5, as a result of a stomach bug.

===2013===

The tenth edition, the 2013 Tour of Britain, took place from Sunday 15 to Sunday 22 September comprising eight stages. Wiggins won in what proved to be Team Sky&#x27;s only general classification victory in the race, beating IAM Cycling&#x27;s Martin Elmiger by 26 seconds, having put 54 seconds into the Swiss rider during the stage three individual time trial around Knowsley, Merseyside. The race notably featured its first hill-top finish, which took place upon Haytor, Devon, on stage six. Riding for the Great Britain national team, future Vuelta a España winner Simon Yates – then aged just 21 – took a famous victory.

===2014===

The eleventh edition, the 2014 Tour of Britain, consisted of eight stages between Sunday 7 and Sunday 14 September. For the first time, it was categorised as a UCI 2.HC race and featured a title sponsor: Friends Life Group. It began in Liverpool and finished in London, with two stage finishes in Wales, three in the west of England, and two in the south-east. The race was won by Dylan van Baarle. German sprinter Marcel Kittel won the stages in Liverpool and London just weeks after he triumphed in two of the three British stages that featured in the 2014 Tour de France; his London victory in the Tour of Britain came on Whitehall, whereas stage three of the 2014 Tour de France finished on The Mall, London. Another British victory looked likely when Essex&#x27;s Alex Dowsett, riding for the Movistar Team (men&#x27;s team), moved into the race lead after forming part of a three-man breakaway on stage six between Bath and Hemel Hempstead. However, he lost the lead after the following day&#x27;s stage between Camberley and Brighton, and went on to finish eighth overall.

===2015===

Edvald Boasson Hagen made more history at the 2015 Tour of Britain when he became the first rider to win the modern edition for a second time. The 12th edition of the modern race, held between Sunday 6 and Sunday 13 September, was sponsored by Aviva following their acquisition of Friends Life in April 2015. In another first, Anglesey hosted the Grand Départ, becoming the first of Britain&#x27;s small islands to welcome the Tour. The race visited the cities of Edinburgh (stage four start), Stoke-on-Trent (stage six start) and Nottingham (stage six finish), as well as smaller towns such as Prudhoe (population of 11,675 in the 2011 United Kingdom census) and Fakenham (population: 7,357). London again hosted the final stage, however the Tour used a new circuit centred around Regent Street and Piccadilly as opposed to its traditional Whitehall loop, versions of which featured in seven editions of the race between 2004 and 2014. German rider André Greipel, riding for Lotto–Soudal was first across the line but was subsequently disqualified for a dangerous sprint. In doing so, he became the first rider to be stripped of a stage win in modern race history; Elia Viviani was awarded the victory to go alongside successes in Wrexham on stage one and Floors Castle on stage three.

===2016===

The 2016 Tour of Britain, held between Sunday 4 and Sunday 11 September, was won by home rider Steve Cummings, who had previously finished second in 2008 and 2011. The race ran without a title sponsor for the first time since 2013 following the conclusion of a sponsorship agreement with Aviva in June of that year.

Glasgow hosted the race&#x27;s Grand Départ for the first time in 10 years; as per the 2006 Tour, Castle Douglas also welcomed the first finish of the race, won by André Greipel. Cummings formed the basis of his overall victory by placing second on Kendal&#x27;s steep Beast Banks climb on stage two, before moving into the race lead after the individual time trial in Bristol on stage 7a (the 2016 race was the third and, at present, last edition to feature a split stage). enjoyed a productive week, with Ian Stannard soloing to a memorable victory at Tatton Park and Wout Poels taking victory atop a wind-swept Haytor on stage six. Poels&#x27; success followed his win on Hartside Pass in the 2015 race&#x27;s hill-top finish stage. The 2016 Tour also proved to be the last professional race of Bradley Wiggins&#x27; cycling career before he retired from the sport. He placed 105th overall, riding for the eponymous squad.

===2017===

The 2017 Tour of Britain, which took place between Sunday 3 and Sunday 10 September, was won by Dutch rider Lars Boom. The rider&#x27;s victory saw him become the second rider to win the modern race overall for a second time following Edvald Boasson Hagen&#x27;s wins in 2009 and 2015.

This edition of the race was sponsored by OVO Energy, the first of three editions that the Bristol-based energy supply company were the title partner of. In another move that emphasised the race&#x27;s status on the international cycling calendar, ITV4 broadcast each stage live in full for the first time.

===2018===

Julian Alaphilippe became the first Frenchman to win the Tour of Britain since 2008 when he triumphed in the 2018 edition. Held between Sunday 2 and Sunday 9 September, the 2018 Tour of Britain was watched by over 1.5 million roadside spectators and featured the likes of Chris Froome – his first participation in the event since 2009 – and that year&#x27;s Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas. Fittingly for Thomas, the race started in Wales, with the other seven stages taking place in England.

Outlining the event&#x27;s innovative nature, the race&#x27;s first-ever team time trial stage took place on day five of the Tour. Starting in Cockermouth, the 14 km uphill stage finished at Whinlatter having climbed the western side of the fell. The following day&#x27;s stage also finished atop Whinlatter, albeit after two ascents of its eastern side.

===2019===

The 2019 Tour of Britain, the first edition of the race to be run from Saturday to Saturday since 2010 (7 to 14 September), was won by Mathieu van der Poel after a race-long battle with Italian rider Matteo Trentin (Mitchelton–Scott).

Together with compatriot Dylan Groenewegen, van der Poel won three stages of the race, including the Greater Manchester finale on day eight – one that started in Altrincham and visited all 10 boroughs of the metropolitan county before finishing along Deansgate. While the 2019 Tour was the first edition of the race since 2012 that did not visit London, Glasgow and Newcastle both featured along the route.

===2020===
Scheduled to take place between Sunday 6 and Sunday 13 September, the 2020 Tour of Britain was due to start with its first Cornwall Grand Départ. Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen were to host the final stage, marking the furthest point north the race would have visited. The race would have formed part of the UCI ProSeries, comprising the second tier of the men&#x27;s elite road cycling events, launched by the sport&#x27;s governing body for 2020. In May 2020, the 2020 edition was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 Tour of Britain followed the route scheduled for the 2020 edition.

===2021===
The men&#x27;s Tour of Britain racereturned to its usual September format after the previous year&#x27;s cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race started on 5 September in Penzance, Cornwall, and finished on 12 September in Aberdeen, Scotland.

===2022===
The race returned to Yorkshire for the first time since 2009 and was scheduled to pass through Dorset for the first time. The final three stages were cancelled, and the race declared completed, due to the death of Elizabeth II.

===2023===

The 2023 race began in Manchester on 3 September and finished in Wales on Sunday 10 September. Full details of the route were announced in summer 2023.

=== 2024 ===

In late 2023, British Cycling terminated its agreement with race organiser and promoter SweetSpot due to a financial dispute; it was reported that SweetSpot was alleged to owe British Cycling £700,000 in unpaid licencing fees. In January 2024, SweetSpot entered liquidation, and the race was removed from the 2024 calendar. In February, British Cycling stated its intention to take on the organisation of both the Tour of Britain and the Women&#x27;s Tour, which was renamed to the Tour of Britain Women. Both Tours were eventually re-added to the UCI calendar. Although British Cycling initially intended the 2024 Tour of Britain Men to consist of eight stages, it was reduced to six, with the intention being also to extend the Tour of Britain Women to six stages in 2025, equalising the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tours. In May, Lloyds Bank agreed with British Cycling to become title partner of both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Tours, a deal reportedly worth around £20 million over five years. The Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men began in Kelso, Scottish Borders, on Tuesday 3 September, and concluded in Felixstowe, Suffolk on Sunday 8 September. The men&#x27;s tour was won by Stevie Williams.

=== 2025 ===
The 2025 edition will take place from Tuesday 2 September to Sunday 7 September.

<text>The Ak 5 (, English: Automatic Carbine 5) is a license-built Swedish version of the Belgian FN FNC assault rifle, with certain modifications, mostly to adapt the weapon to the partially subarctic Swedish climate. The Ak 5 is the current service rifle of the Swedish Armed Forces, adopted in 1986, partially replacing the Ak 4, a license-built version of the Heckler &amp; Koch G3.

In 2021, Sweden announced that they were looking to develop a new rifle in collaboration with Finland, which would replace the Ak5. In 2023 this rifle took shape as the new Automatkarbin 24.

==History==
In the mid-1970s, despite the failure of the &quot;Nytt infanterivapen&quot; (New Infantry Weapon) program, the Swedish Armed Forces decided to continue to follow the general transition towards smaller calibre ammunition and directed the Försvarets MaterielVerk (FMV) (Defence Materiel Administration) to procure a suitable replacement for the Ak 4 capable of using 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition, which under STANAG4172 is a standard cartridge for NATO forces as well as many non-NATO countries.
The weapon was required to be highly reliable in the subarctic climate of northernmost Sweden, as well as being easy to handle and maintain, while meeting a certain minimum level of accuracy.

From 1975 the FMV evaluated and tested the Colt M16A1, Stoner 63A1, ArmaLite AR-18, Steyr AUG, Beretta M70, IMI Galil, FN FNC, FN CAL, SIG 540, HK33 and FFV 890C (a Swedish Galil variant) 5.56×45mm NATO assault rifles. The FN FNC and FFV 890C were tested from 1979 to 1980 at infantry regiment I11 in Växjö.

After further testing from 1981 to 1985 the FMV eventually chose the Belgian FN FNC, which received several modifications. These included a larger trigger guard and cocking handle (to allow for operation while wearing winter gloves, a necessity for temperatures reaching down to ), a larger handguard, a different collapsible shoulder stock, different iron sights and gas block, a modified bolt, deletion of the 3-round burst capability, and a corrosion-resistant green (instead of black) finish. Further the detachable box magazines were modified to be interchangeable with the M16 rifle STANAG magazines. This rifle was finally accepted by the Swedish military as the Ak5 in 1986.

Swedish blank ammunition uses a wooden plug in place of a bullet, so the flash suppressor was fitted with grooves to accept the Swedish blank-firing adaptor, which besides choking the barrel to ensure enough gas pressure for reliable operation also prevents potentially dangerous pieces of wood from leaving the weapon by smashing the plug into a fine sawdust. The flash suppressor was also designed to accept rifle grenades, although none have been accepted into service.

During the troop trials there were an alarming number of complaints by soldiers about damaged teeth from being struck in the mouth by the muzzle end. This was revealed to be caused by the practice of having the weapon slung across the chest rather than the back. Rather than changing this practice (which would reduce the ability of the soldier to rapidly bring the rifle into action), a special plastic cap (later changed to a hard rubber version) was issued to cover the muzzle.
== Variants ==
The Ak 5 is the Swedish licensed produced version of the FN FNC. Along with its other variants (Ak5B, Ak5C and Ak5D), all respectively have a cyclic rate of fire of around 650–700 rounds per minute(RPM).

===CGA5C2===
The CGA5C2 (&quot;Carl Gustav Automatic Carbine 5 C2&quot;) was a prototype model during the evaluation and development of the Ak5 in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

===Ak 5===
The first versions of the Ak 5 family were made by the Swedish company FFV Ordnance AB (later part of Saab Bofors Dynamics) under license from FN, with deliveries starting in 1986. This version of the Ak5 is still in the inventory of the Swedish Armed Forces, but is no longer issued to soldiers, having been replaced by the Ak5C and Ak5D. This version uses fixed iron sights, and the Swedish Armed Forces have estimated that the maximum practical distance is 400 meters, but it can be used at longer ranges. This brings it in line with the M16, using the Swedish Armed Forces definition of maximum practical distance.

As issued, the Ak 5 did not have a bayonet lug. A bayonet lug adaptor (using the Ak4 bayonet) is fitted to some rifles for ceremonial duties, such as the Royal Guards at the Stockholm Palace.

===Ak 5B===

The Ak 5B is the designated marksman version of the Ak 5. Modifications include fittings for a 4×25.5 SUSAT L9A1 tritium sight, a cheek pad on the buttstock, and removal of the iron sights. This weapon was typically carried by squad leaders. This version weighs 4.8 kg (without magazine) and 5.4 kg (with full magazine). Approximately 5200 of this version were made. It is no longer in service.

===Ak 5C===
At the beginning of the 21st century the Swedish military wanted a more modern assault rifle for integration in a future Swedish soldier program. The rifle had to have a Rail Integration System, better ergonomics and improved reliability. Instead of purchasing a new assault rifle, Sweden opted to modify the existing Ak5B rifle family already in use reducing program risks and costs.

Before the Ak 5C went into mass production, it was thoroughly evaluated. This was done by having certain units use an experimental model designated Ak5CF where &quot;F&quot; stands for the Swedish word &quot;försök&quot; (in this context, &quot;experiment&quot; or &quot;trial&quot;). During the trial over one million rounds were fired and the rifles exhibited a Mean Rounds Between Stoppage value of 3,500. The test users found the test weapon too heavy and long so the barrel length was reduced to 350 mm to reduce overall weight and move the center of gravity closer to the user. These tests were completed in June 2005 and four months later, the FMV signed a contract with Saab Bofors Dynamics covering the modification of nearly 40,000 Ak5 assault rifles, which took the company approximately four years to implement. Serial deliveries were scheduled to begin in June 2006 and the Ak5C was first issued to priority units serving in Afghanistan (ISAF), Chad (EUFOR Chad/CAR), and Kosovo (KFOR).

The Ak 5C is the modernized version of the original Ak5, following the trend of modular weapons. One of the most significant improvements is the MIL-STD-1913 rail system to which a variety of different optics, lights and sights can be mounted, such as telescopic sights and image intensifiers. The double gas position, iron sights and bolt catch of the original Ak5 rifle family were discarded.

New features of the Ak 5C compared to the original Ak 5:
* Increased reliability Mean Rounds Between Stoppage &gt; 2,000
* Barrel shortened to 
* Weight reduced to 
* MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail system at the top and bottom of the hand guard
* Adjustable buttstock
* Foldable emergency iron sights (for ranges up to 300 m)
* Automatic bolt catch
* Ambidextrous selector levers
* Translucent 30-round plastic box magazines
* New slimmer pistol grip at a different angle (similar to the one on Ksp 90)
* Modified hand guard with cut outs for pressure switches and cables on the right and left side
* Forward vertical grip at 6 o&#x27;clock position (detachable)
* New prong-type flash suppressor
* Tactical sling (nylon)
* Fire selector on both sides of the rifle.

The CS red dot sight with a 4 MOA red dot reticle was chosen as the standard optical sight for the Ak5C. Other day or night aiming optics can also be mounted on the MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail system.

There has been some confusion about the M203 grenade launcher. While the Ak5C is prepared to accept the launcher, the correct designation (translated from Swedish) would be &quot;Ak 5[version] with grenade attachment&quot; for the combination. The bayonet-lug adapter for the Ak4 bayonet is not used with the Ak5C. Instead a new bayonet for ceremonial use only was issued to the troops. This bayonet is attached to the 6 o&#x27;clock rail on the hand guard.

The Ak 5C is now the standard-issue rifle of the Swedish armed forces, and production of the A and B versions are currently discontinued and existing stock put in storage.

===Ak 5D===
The Ak 5D has a shortened barrel and handguard. It also features the MIL-STD-1913 rail system for easy mounting of a variety of sights.

Due to the smaller dimensions of the carbine, the Ak 5D is especially suited for ranger/urban warfare units and vehicle crews who often benefit from a more lightweight and compact weapon when taking into account the nature of their assignments and the environments in which they often operate. The Swedish Police have used a version of the Ak5D; see below.

The newest Ak 5D Mk2 version has the same upgrades as the &quot;C&quot; model but retains the shorter barrel.

===CGA5P===
Some units of the Swedish Police have used a special version of the Ak 5D called CGA5P or sometimes (incorrectly) Ak5DP. Essentially it is a black (instead of the regular military green) Ak5D with automatic fire capability disabled by a hex screw, which can be removed if automatic fire is needed. Unlike the Ak5D, the police version has fixed sights but is still equipped with the MIL-STD-1913 rail system to allow the use of telescopic sights or red dot sights. Unlike its military counterparts (except for the Ak5C/D versions), the police version has safety catches on both sides of the weapon.

<text>The Rank Group plc is a gambling company based in the United Kingdom. Rank was involved in the cinema and motion picture industry until 2006, and continues to use the Gongman logo originally used by the Rank Organisation&#x27;s film distribution subsidiary General Film Distributors. Its brands now include Mecca Bingo, and Grosvenor Casinos, the UK&#x27;s largest casino operator.

Rank&#x27;s principal market and headquarters are in the United Kingdom, where it operates Grosvenor Casinos (56 casinos), Mecca Bingo (96 bingo clubs) and Rank Interactive (online gaming and betting). It also operates additional Grosvenor Casinos clubs in Belgium (two casinos), and Rank España in Spain (10 bingo clubs).

Rank is listed on the London Stock Exchange.

==History==
The company was formed to acquire the business interests of the Rank Organisation, which itself was formed out of the business interests of its founder, J. Arthur Rank. Until the start of the 21st century, the group still had a tremendous amount of leisure holdings; however, as the decade progressed it divested these interests, beginning with Pinewood Studios and the Odeon cinema chain. It also shed its engineering interests, such as its share in Rank Xerox, selling Rank Leisure Machine Services to Gamestec. It sold its holiday and recreation facilities: Oasis Forest Holiday Villages was sold to Center Parcs UK, and all its Butlins, Warner and Haven Holidays facilities were all sold to Bourne Leisure.

The company then sold off its nightclub division, Rank Entertainment, as well as its interest in Universal Orlando Resort, and disposed of the Rank film library to Carlton Communications, to which it had recently also sold the Rank Screen Advertising Film Division, which was latterly known as Cinema Media (now Digital Cinema Media).

In December 2005, Rank sold Deluxe Film (formerly Rank Film Laboratories) for £430 million, effectively ending its 60-year association with the film and cinema business. This meant Rank Leisure had become focused on gambling operations, with its remaining business interests concentrating on Grosvenor and G Casinos, Top Rank and Mecca Bingo, and online gambling through Rank Interactive, after the company acquired the Blue Square betting business in 2003. Finally leaving all non-gambling leisure behind, in December 2006, Rank sold the Hard Rock business, excluding the London casino venue which was rebranded to G Casinos, to the Seminole Tribe of Florida for US$965 million.

In May 2012, Rank agreed to purchase 23 casinos from Gala Coral for £205 million. After the Competition Commission ruled that the deal would only go ahead if four venues were excluded, in March 2013 Rank agreed to purchase 19 casinos from Gala Coral for £179 million, making Rank the UK&#x27;s largest casino operator. In April 2013, the group sold its Blue Square interactive gaming business, launched in 1999, to Betfair. In January 2017, Rank Group and Mecca Bingo announced the renewal of their contract, which guarantees the use of Playtech&#x27;s Virtue Fusion platform at the bingo site for another 10 years.

==Operations==
===Grosvenor Casinos===

Established in 1970, Grosvenor Casinos (formerly County Clubs) is a UK-based chain of over 50 casinos located in major towns and cities across the UK with two sister casinos located in Belgium. In 2010, the group had an active membership of 1 million customers across its 35 UK clubs under the Grosvenor brand. In March 2013, Rank announced that it had conditionally agreed to purchase 19 Gala Casinos from the Gala Coral Group in a £179 million deal. With the addition of these casinos and a further three non-operating licences, Rank has become the largest casino operator in the UK, with 56 casinos.

===Mecca Bingo ===

Mecca Bingo (formerly called Top Rank) is a UK-based social and bingo club leisure company, with sites located in several major towns and cities across the UK. The company operates meccabingo.com and meccagames.com as extensions of the Mecca Bingo brand. Mecca Bingo now offers players the ability to interact with a live dealer in the desktop and mobile app (iOS and Android) platforms instead of relying on a random number generator.

====Controversy====

On 25 December 1997, many Muslims were angered that the name of their holiest city, Mecca, was also the name of a gambling company, as gambling is strictly forbidden in Islam. Bricks were thrown through windows at a Mecca Bingo hall in Luton, causing £3000 of damage. In a meeting held between community leaders and Mecca Bingo executives on 6 January 1998, Hazel Simmons, chairwoman of equal opportunities at Luton Borough Council, said, &quot;We are aware of a groundswell of public opinion and I personally believe this to be insensitive in what is now a truly multicultural society.&quot; However, Mecca Bingo said that the name change from Top Rank was not insensitive and was part of a policy of bringing their nationwide chain of bingo halls under one name. Sergeant Peter Shepherd said, &quot;It was unrealistic to expect that anything definite could be resolved at the meeting, but at least it was constructive to have the dialogue.&quot;

===enracha===
enracha is Rank&#x27;s interactive Spanish gaming site launched in 2011. enracha offers a wide range of online slots, videobingo, blackjack, roulette, live roulette, skill games and other casino games.

==Technology==
In January 2015, Rank announced that it would move to a new technology platform supplied by Bede Gaming. The public announcement said the rationale for the new platform is to give greater control, flexibility and speed in integrating third-party and retail content and functionality. The platform will integrate Rank&#x27;s digital and land-based businesses to allow for a single view for the customer.

<text>Panathinaikos Football Club ( ), known as Panathinaikos, or by its full name, and the name of its parent sports club, [[Panathinaikos A.O.]] or PAO (; &quot;Panathinaïkós Athlitikós Ómilos&quot;, ), is a Greek professional football club based in Athens, Greece.

Panathinaikos was founded in 1908 as &quot;Podosfairikos Omilos Athinon&quot; (&quot;Football Club of Athens&quot;) by Georgios Kalafatis, they play in Super League Greece, being one of the most successful clubs in Greek football and one of the three clubs which have never been relegated from the top division. Among their major titles are 20 Greek Championships, 20 Greek Cups, achieving eight times the Double and 3 Greek Super Cups. They are also one of three clubs to win a Greek championship undefeated, going without a loss in a top-flight campaign in the 1963–64 season. Panathinaikos is the only Greek team that has reached the UEFA Champions League final in 1971 (which they lost to Ajax 2–0), and also the semi-finals twice, in 1985 and 1996. It is also the only Greek team that has played for the Intercontinental Cup (1971). Furthermore, they have reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League on another two occasions (in 1992 and 2002), as well as the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup twice (1988 and 2003). They have also won the Balkans Cup in 1977. According to research and polls, Panathinaikos is the second most popular football team in Greece. Panathinaikos is also a member of the European Club Association.

They have played their home games in the Leoforos Alexandras Stadium, considered their traditional home ground, and the Athens Olympic Stadium.

Panathinaikos hold a long-term rivalry with Olympiacos, the clash between the two teams being referred to as the &quot;Derby of the Eternal Enemies&quot;.

==History==
=== Early years ===
According to the official history of the club, Panathinaikos was founded by the 17 years old track and field athlete Giorgos Kalafatis on 3 February 1908, when he decided to break away from Panellinios Gymnastikos Syllogos following the club&#x27;s decision to discontinue its football team. The young athlete was followed by the athletes Alexandros Kalafatis (the founder&#x27;s brother), and Mr. Doukakis, Bouboulis, Chrisis, Granitsas, Mantzakos, Papageorgiou, Gaetas, Demertzis, Stavropoulos, Paschos, Misakian, Reppas, Sapounias and Garoufalias.

The name of the new club was &quot;Podosferikos Omilos Athinon&quot; (&quot;Football Club of Athens&quot;). It was founded with the aim of spreading and making more known this new sport (football) to the Athenian and Greek public in general. Also, the intention of the founders was to create a team for all of Athens and to be connected with the rest of the European football movement, which was already active. According to Loukas Panourgias, &quot;they wanted their Club not to be like all the others, but a team for Athens, for the entire capital...&quot; Establishing a football-only club at that time was a challenge to the prevailing norms of Greek society.&quot;&quot;The founding of a football club at a time when this sport was universally regarded as a street game and was openly persecuted by everyone, both authorities and non-authorities alike, was a clear act of rebellion against the prevailing perceptions of sports at the time&quot;(Athlitismos, 1927).&quot;
The first president elected was Alexandros Kalafatis, brother of Giorgos. The ground of the team was in Patission Street. Oxford University athlete John Cyril Campbell was brought in as coach, the first time that a foreigner was appointed as the coach of a Greek team. Konstantinos Tsiklitiras, the great Greek athlete of the early 20th century, played as goalkeeper for the new team.


During the turbulent 1910s, marked by the Balkan Wars and World War I, football activity declined. Goalkeeper Konstantinos Tsiklitiras volunteered for the army, fought at the Battle of Bizani, contracted meningitis, and died in Athens at 24. Founder Giorgos Kalafatis served in all three wars, eventually reaching the rank of rear admiral and later on served a military doctor in the Asia minor campaign. In 1910, after a dispute among a number of board members, Kalafatis with most of the players—also followed by Campbell—decided to pull out of POA and secured a new ground in Amerikis Square and the next year the team won the 1911 SEGAS Championship. Subsequently, the name of the club changed to Panellinios Podosferikos Omilos (&quot;Panhellenic Football Club&quot;) and its colours to green and white. By 1914, Campbell had returned to England but the club was already at the top of Greek football with players such as Michalis Papazoglou, Michalis Rokkos and Loukas Panourgias and went on to win the football tournament of 1915.

In 1918, the team adopted the trifolium (shamrock) as its emblem, symbol of harmony, unity, nature, fertility and good luck, as proposed by Michalis Papazoglou. In 1921 and 1922, the Athens-Piraeus FCA organised the first two post-WWI championships, in both of which PPO was declared champion. By that stage, the club had outgrown both the grounds in Patission Street and Amerikis Square, due mainly to its expansion in other sports, and began to look at vacant land in the area of Perivola on Alexandras Avenue as its potential new ground. After long discussions with the Municipality of Athens, an agreement was finally reached and in 1922 &quot;Leoforos&quot; (&quot;Avenue&quot; in Greek) was granted to the club.

The move to a permanent home ground also heralded another—final—name change to Panathinaikos Athlitikos Omilos (PAO), &quot;All-Athenian Athletic Club&quot;, on 15 March 1924, from now on a multi-sport club. However, the decision was already taken by 1922.

In 1926, the Hellenic Football Federation (HFF) was founded and the first Greek Championship under its authority took place in 1927. The club dominated Athenian football, winning the Athens championships of 1925 1926 1927 and 1929 organized by the Athens Football Clubs Association.


Panathinaikos won undefeated the Championship of 1929–30 under the guidance of József Künsztler and Angelos Messaris as the team&#x27;s star player. Other notable players of this &quot;Belle Époque&quot; period of the team were Antonis Migiakis, Diomidis Symeonidis, Mimis Pierrakos and Stefanos Pierrakos, among others. They thrashed rivals Olympiacos 8–2, a result that still remains the biggest win either team has achieved against its rival, with Messaris scoring three goals. The team also defeated Aris 1–4 away in Thessaloniki. Messaris, who scored again three goals, became a hero and chant for the fans.

=== Crisis and WWII years ===
In 1931, a serious disagreement between leading board member Apostolos Nikolaidis from one side, and some players (most notably Angelos Messaris) and club&#x27;s officials on the other side, regarding the professionalisation in the Greek football, which lasted two years, damaged the club and led to a counterproductive period. In the meantime, the HFF Greek Cup had commenced in 1932. The last bright moment for the Greens before World War II was winning the Cup for the first time in 1940 against Aris, 3–1.
In 1940, with the break out of the Greco-Italian War, many players of the club joined the Hellenic Army. Mimis Pierrakos was killed during the war (later, during the 1950s, his bones were transferred from Albania back to Athens). During the Axis Occupation of Greece from 1941 to 1944, many players of the team became members of United Panhellenic Organization of Youth (PEAN) resistance organisation., while Michalis Papazoglou had a leading role in the resistance group of Jerzy Iwanow-Szajnowicz.P

After this long crisis period, Panathinaikos had to wait until 1949 to win again a Greek Championship under the guidance of the Austrian coach Johann Strnad. That same year, Vangelis Panakis and Kostas Linoxilakis came to the club and quickly became the side&#x27;s new star players. Panathinaikos was again champion for the 1952–53 Panhellenic Championship.

Until 1959, the team had also won seven of the last eight Athens Championships, the regional championships organised in Greece. In 1959, Mimis Domazos, the emblematic captain of the team, made his first appearance with Panathinaikos and the same year took place the first season under the new system of Alpha Ethniki (1959–60 Alpha Ethniki). Panathinaikos was the champion team.

=== 1960s: The Golden Decade, the Bobek&#x27;s rejuvenation ===
During the next years, Panathinaikos were again champions in 1961, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1969 and 1970. Moreover, the team won two more Greek Cups, in 1967 and 1969. Also, during these years, a long process of rejuvenation took place in the club. Notable players retired, such as Panakis, Linoxilakis, Takis Loukanidis and Andreas Papaemmanouil, and the team had to count on young players like Domazos, Antonis Antoniadis, Anthimos Kapsis, Kostas Eleftherakis and Takis Ikonomopoulos.

Stjepan Bobek was the main contributor to this process. In 1963, he became the club&#x27;s head coach, changing the playing style of the team to a 4–3–3 and created a new team based on young players (the &quot;Bobek&#x27;s rejuvenation&quot;). Under his guidance, Panathinaikos won the Championship of 1964 without a loss, making them one of the two teams that has won the Greek Championship (with its modern system) undefeated. Notable players of the team included Panakis, Domazos, Takis Ikonomopoulos, Totis Filakouris, Frangiskos Sourpis and Aristidis Kamaras.

With the establishment of the Greek military regime, the president of the club, Loukas Panourgias, was forced out of the presidency. The contract of Bobek was cancelled by the State, while Apostolos Nikolaidis, the old player, manager and official of the club, went on trial.

In 1967, the great Béla Guttmann came as coach, but he soon left and ex-player Lakis Petropoulos was appointed. Under his guidance, Panathinaikos won the championships of 1969 (with a double) and 1970.

=== Puskás years and the epic road to Wembley ===

==== 1970–71 European Cup finalists ====
In 1971, under the guidance of Ferenc Puskás, Panathinaikos were 1970–71 European Cup finalists, the first and only Greek team until today, losing 2–0 to Ajax at Wembley Stadium. In the road to the final, they eliminated Jeunesse Esch, Slovan Bratislava, Everton and Red Star Belgrade. Notable players included the captain Mimis Domazos, Anthimos Kapsis, Aristidis Kamaras, Kostas Eleftherakis, Totis Filakouris and the goalkeepers Takis Ikonomopoulos and Vasilis Konstantinou. Antonis Antoniadis was the top scorer in the competition scoring ten goals.
In a warmup game before the 1971 final, they defeated Worcester Park 16 - 0.

In the same year, Panathinaikos played for the 1971 Intercontinental Cup (due to the refusal of Ajax to participate), where they lost to Uruguayan club Nacional (1–1 in Greece, 2–1 in Uruguay). Totis Filakouris was the scorer for the Greek club.

During the last amateur years of Greek football, the &quot;Trifolium&quot; won one more Championship in 1972. Antonis Antoniadis was again top scorer with 39 goals (also second in Europe). His record remains until today in the Greek league.

With the collapse of the military regime, Apostolos Nikolaidis became again active for the club and was appointed honorary president of Panathinaikos. In 1975, one of the greatest coaches of his era, the Brazilian Aymoré Moreira, who mainly worked in Brazil (World Cup Champion with the Brazil national team in 1962), was appointed. After a year and a half of poor results, however, he was replaced by Kazimierz Górski. With Górski, Panathinaikos won the double in 1977, followed by a Balkans Cup victory in the same year. Notable foreign players who played for the team during the late 1970s include Juan Ramón Verón, Araquem de Melo and Óscar Álvarez.

=== Vardinogiannis era (1979–2012) ===
In 1979, Greek football turned professional. The Vardinogiannis family purchased PAO&#x27;s football department and Giorgos Vardinogiannis became president. Panathinaikos were one of the first Greek clubs that formed a women&#x27;s team in 1980, but that department is currently inactive.

The transformation period lasted a few years, but in 1982 the club won its first professional era trophy, the Greek Cup, and during the 1980s they would go on winning two championships (1984, 1986), four more Greek Cups (1984, 1986—with a 4–0 against Olympiacos in the final—, 1988, 1989) and the Greek Super Cup in 1988. The great star of the team during these years was Dimitris Saravakos, nicknamed &quot;The Kid.&quot; Saravakos, a high-technique explosive midfielder and iconic captain of Panathinaikos, was the alsolute idol for the fans during the 1980s, while other players included Nikos Sarganis, Spiros Livathinos, Velimir Zajec, Juan Ramón Rocha, Christos Dimopoulos and Giannis Kyrastas.

In the 1984–85 season, Panathinaikos, with coach Jacek Gmoch and stars Dimitris Saravakos, Velimir Zajec, Juan Ramón Rocha and Ioannis Kyrastas, made a run in Europe, eliminating Feyenoord, Linfield and IFK Göteborg to reach the semi-finals of the European Cup, where they were knocked out by Liverpool.

In 1987–88, they made it also to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup, eliminating Juventus, Auxerre and Budapest Honvéd. Dimitris Saravakos was top scorer of the competition.

The 1990s were an even more successful period for the club, both nationally and internationally. Four Greek championships (1990, 1991, 1995, 1996), four Greek Cups (1991, 1993, 1994, 1995) and two Greek Super Cups (1993, 1994) were awarded to the club.

In the 1991–92 season, Panathinaikos reached also the last eight of the European Cup and took part in the first ever European tournament to have a group stage.

In 1995–96, with Juan Ramon Rocha as coach and key players Krzysztof Warzycha, Józef Wandzik, Stratos Apostolakis, Georgios Georgiadis, Dimitris Markos, Giannis Kalitzakis, Giorgos Donis and Juan Jose Borrelli, Panathinaikos reached the Champions League semi-finals, finishing first in the group stage against Nantes, Porto, Aalborg BK and eliminating Legia Warsaw in the quarter-finals.

In the semi-finals, Panathinaikos faced Ajax, recording an impressive 0–1 first leg away victory with Krzysztof Warzycha scoring the winning goal. Ajax had a record of 22 undefeated international matches until then, with Panathinaikos breaking their series. The Greek team, however, suffered a 0–3 defeat on the second leg. Thus, Panathinaikos was denied entry to a Champions League final once more.

In the summer of 2000, President Giorgos Vardinogiannis resigned from his duties with complaints for the refereeing situation in Greece and passed his shares to his nephew Giannis Vardinogiannis, who changed the style of the club&#x27;s management. Angelos Anastasiadis was initially appointed coach of the team and later the ex-player Giannis Kyrastas.

With the arrival of coach Sergio Markarián, Panathinaikos reached the quarter-finals of the 2001–02 UEFA Champions League, being eliminated by Barcelona. Panathinaikos had passed the first group stage as the top club against Arsenal, Mallorca and Schalke 04, and the second group stage as second against Real Madrid, Porto and Sparta Prague.

In the first leg of the quarter-finals, Panathinaikos managed to defeat Barcelona by 1–0 in Leoforos Alexandras Stadium. The second leg in Camp Nou was to be an eventful one. Panathinaikos scored first thanks to a beautiful goal by Michalis Konstantinou but eventually was eliminated as Barcelona scored three goals.

Ιn Europe, Panathinaikos made it to the quarter-finals of UEFA Cup quarter-finals. En route, the Greek team had knocked-out Litex Lovech, Fenerbahçe (with an impressive 4–1 win in Leoforos Alexandras Stadium), Slovan Liberec and Anderlecht.
During the quarter-finals, although winning the first match in Estádio das Antas against eventual winners of the trophy FC Porto of José Mourinho, with the header of Emmanuel Olisadebe, they were eliminated in the second leg after extra time.

Notable players of this team included Takis Fyssas, Giorgos Karagounis, Antonis Nikopolidis, Angelos Basinas, Nikos Lyberopoulos, Michalis Konstantinou, Giourkas Seitaridis, Sotirios Kyrgiakos, Paulo Sousa, Goran Vlaović, Rene Henriksen, Joonas Kolkka, Jan Michaelsen and Emmanuel Olisadebe, considered by the fans one of the best teams in the club&#x27;s history.

During 2002–03 Alpha Ethniki season, they lost the Greek championship in the last two games by arch-rivals Olympiacos.

Under the guidance of Israeli coach Itzhak Shum, Panathinaikos managed to win the championship in 2004. They won also the Cup, beating Olympiacos 3–1 in the final, making the double. New players like Ezequiel González, Lucian Sanmartean and Markus Münch had signed the summer before. In the Champions League, they came third in the group stage facing Manchester United, VfB Stuttgart and Rangers.

However, Shum was unexpectedly fired early in the next season (2004–05) and Zdeněk Ščasný succeeded him on the bench. Panathinaikos finished second in the championship, while in the Champions League they came again third in the group stage facing Rosenborg, PSV and Arsenal. They continued in the UEFA Cup, where they were eliminated by Sevilla.

In 2005, major changes were made in the team&#x27;s roster. Players like Angelos Basinas and Michalis Konstantinou departed, while others like Flávio Conceição, Igor Bišćan and Andreas Ivanschitz arrived. Ščasný gave his seat to Alberto Malesani. At the start of the 2006–07 season, Malesani left the team and was replaced by Hans Backe, who left only three months after his appointment; Víctor Muñoz was his replacement. For the 2007–08 season, Panathinaikos hired José Peseiro.


On 22 April 2008, and under pressure from the fan base, main shareholder Giannis Vardinogiannis gave a press conference in which he announced the decision of his family to reduce their share in the club to 50%—after 30 years of full ownership—through an €80 million increase of the company&#x27;s capital stock. After the negotiations and the share capital increase, the Vardinogiannis family would hold 56% of the club, the amateur Club 10% and the other shareholders 34% (with main investors Andreas Vgenopoulos, Pavlos Giannakopoulos, Adamantios Polemis and Nikos Pateras). Nikos Pateras was selected to be the new president of the club.

Following the major changes in 2008, Panathinaikos hired Henk ten Cate as coach and bought many expensive players, such as Gilberto Silva from Arsenal and Gabriel from Fluminense. In the 2008–09 season, the Greens proved that they could hold their weight in the Champions League by reaching the last 16. However, they disappointed in the Greek Championship, finishing third in the regular season, though they managed to come second overall after the playoff mini-league.

The 2009–10 season was a successful one for Panathinaikos. During the summer transfer period, the club bought Djibril Cissé from Marseille, Kostas Katsouranis from Benfica, Sebastián Leto from Liverpool and various other players, spending more than €35 million in total. Henk ten Cate left in December to be replaced by Nikos Nioplias. The team managed to reach the last 16 of the Europa League, eliminating A.S. Roma after two amazing matches in Olympic Stadium of Athens and Stadio Olimpico. Panathinaikos also won both the Greek Championship and the Greek Cup, beating Aris by 1–0 in the final of the latter, thanks to a goal by Sebastián Leto.

In 2011, due to financial problems and management disagreements, Panathinaikos sold Cissé for €5.8 million to Lazio and first-choice goalkeeper Alexandros Tzorvas to Palermo to reduce the budget. New players then entered, such as Quincy Owusu-Abeyie, Toché, Vitolo and Zeca. The club also changed their president and chose Dimitris Gontikas to be the new chairman. Panathinaikos failed to qualify to the group stage of 2011–12 Champions League after they were knocked out by Odense BK 4–5 on aggregate.

=== Alafouzos era (2012–present) ===
Panathinaikos&#x27; downfall continued as a result of the serious riots in the Panathinaikos–Olympiacos derby of 18 March 2012. The entire board quit and Panathinaikos remained headless for about two months. However, the owner of Skai TV, Giannis Alafouzos, devised a plan to take Vardinogiannis&#x27; shares (54.7%) and make them available to fans around Greece so that everyone could contribute a desired amount, so that Panathinaikos could overcome the crisis. His plan seemed to be working, as a new 20-member board was elected with Dimitris Gontikas at the president&#x27;s chair again, though it was yet to be seen how the fans would respond to Panathinaikos&#x27; call for help.

On 2 July 2012, the PAO Alliance 2012 finally opened to the public so that everyone could be a member and contribute a desired amount in return for privileges. After a few weeks of operation, 8,606 members had signed up, some of which were current or former Panathinaikos players, including Jean-Alain Boumsong, Sotiris Ninis, Gilberto Silva and Djibril Cissé, among others.

On 18 July 2012, marked a historical day in Panathinaikos history, as Giannis Vardinogiannis gave his shares—54.7% of Panathinaikos—to the Panathinaikos Alliance, thereby allowing Panathinaikos to have a fresh start with their own fans at the steering wheel, who through elections (among the members of the Alliance) they compose the board of directors and elect the club&#x27;s president. The first president elected was Giannis Alafouzos.

The first season with the Panathinaikos Alliance at the helm was nothing short of abysmal for the club. While still enduring financial troubles, Panathinaikos finished sixth in the championship and failed to qualify for the European competition for the first time in 16 years.

For the 2013–14 season, the membership had risen up to 9,305 members. Starting the football year, both fans and journalists were very sceptical of Panathinaikos&#x27; chances of a successful season, and many people expected the team to suffer relegation from the Super League Greece. In May 2013, Yannis Anastasiou was appointed manager, and he planned a team based on players from the Panathinaikos Youth Academies joined by experienced foreign players looking to revive their careers. Despite the early scepticism, Panathinaikos&#x27; fans supported the team through the rough start, and the season turned out to be a massive success in light of the dire financial situation of the club and the young and inexperienced squad. The club finished fourth in the regular season and second after the playoffs (meaning they qualified for the 2014–15 Champions League), with Marcus Berg the top scorer of the team. Panathinaikos also won the 2013–14 Greek Football Cup after a 4–1 win over PAOK.

On 2 November 2015, after bad performances and a home draw with AEK Athens, manager Yannis Anastasiou was sacked and replaced by Andrea Stramaccioni. Further successive poor results under the latter&#x27;s reign, combined with loss of dressing room control, led to the dismissal of Stramaccioni on 1 December 2016, with former Panathinaikos player and Greece international Marinos Ouzounidis taking over the management at the club. Ouzounidis had some great moments with Panathinaikos and was generally liked by the fans. His resignation, due to problems with owner Giannis Alafouzos sparked another wave of disappointment and hatred against Alafouzos from the fans.

On 24 April 2018 UEFA decided to exclude Panathinaikos FC from participating in the next UEFA club competition for which it would otherwise qualify in the next three seasons as a result of Financial Fair Play breaches

Giorgos Donis was announced as the new coach on 3 July 2018. Coach Donis had a great start of the season despite beginning with −6 points in the championship, counting 6 consecutive wins that put Panathinaikos on top of the table. However, due to problems with his salary and a clash with Giannis Alafouzos, he was forced to resign in 2019. This situation made the relations between Alafouzos and the fans worse, with protests and demonstrations during games against him. Panathinaikos remained one of the top clubs in Greece, but its absence from European tournaments was a major factor in the fans&#x27; disappointment with the ownership. During the summer of 2020, a series of bad decisions were made from Giannis Alafouzos, who chose to let most of the players that had contributed to a very good season go.

Spaniard Dani Poyatos signed on as head of the club on 22 July 2020 for two years, taking over from George Donis&#x27; work. Poyatos was sacked after a poor start of the season on 12 October and was replaced by László Bölöni. After a disappointing fifth position in the league and the failure to guide them to a European qualification spot Bölöni was sacked and replaced by Ivan Jovanović.

During the 21-22 season under the management of Ivan Jovanović, the team achieved its major goal of returning to European Competitions finishing fourth, and won their 19th Greek Cup, beating PAOK 1–0 in the final ending an eight-year trophy drought. Ivan Jovanović was offered a two-year extension to his contract, which he accepted.

==== 2022-23 season, close call triumph &amp; inches away from first league trophy in 13 years ====
After a five-year absence from European Competitions, Panathinaikos has won a place in the third qualifying round of the 2022–23 UEFA Europa Conference League, drawing Czech Slavia Prague. Any chance of return to a European group stage has been lost after losing 3–1 on aggregate.

Their exclusion from Europe wasn&#x27;t enough, since the squad was off to an exceptional start to the 2022-23 Super League Greece season, ultimately hitting the largest unbeaten streak in Europe for the 2022–23 season) of 16 matches, 3 of which are drawn. The streak broke loose when Panathinaikos faced second-placed AEK Athens, which ended in a 1–0 away loss.

All eyes were on the fact that Panathinaikos finished the regular season placed first with 61 points, followed by AEK Athens with 59 points, a critically low difference between the two teams, with the remaining play-off round deciding on who will lift the trophy. In the end, the play-off round saw the overturn of the eventual title holder of the 2022-23 Super League, when Panathinaikos (1st at 77 points) faced a 1–0 away loss against Olympiacos F.C. placing AEK in the first place (with 80 points) of the play-off round.

In the last round, Panathinaikos faced Aris Thessaloniki F.C. and the match ended at 1-1, having achieved one point (making it 78 points), ultimately ending every hope for achieving the first league title since 2010. AEK faced Volos, who were at the bottom of the play-offs table, which resulted in a 4–0 home win and the achievement of the 2022-23 league for AEK Athens.

Panathinaikos won the 2023–24 Greek Football Cup by defeating Aris in the final with 1–0, thus clinching their 20th Greek Cup title and sealing their position in next year&#x27;s UEFA Competitions and more specifically in the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League second qualifying round.

On October 30, 2024, the club announced that Rui Vitoria will be its next coach.

==Crest and colours==
===Crest evolution===
White was the colour that was first used by the team in 1908 (probably like that of the first crest). The first symbol of the club was an association football ball of the era.

In 1911, the colours changed to green and white. In 1918, Michalis Papazoglou proposed the trifolium, symbol of harmony, unity, nature and good luck, as emblem of Panathinaikos. The officials of the club were looking for a universal, non-nationalistic or localistic, symbol aiming to represent the whole Athens at the country and further at the world. Papazoglou used to have it sewn on his shirt since he was competing for a club in his native Chalcedon, Constantinople (present-day Istanbul, Turkey). He was possibly inspired by Billy Sherring, an Irish Canadian athlete who had won the Athens 1906 Olympic marathon (1906 Intercalated Games) wearing a white outfit with a big green shamrock on the chest.

Georgios Chatzopoulos, member—and later president—of the club and director of the National Gallery, took over to design the new emblem for the team. Up to the end of the 1970s, a trifolium (green or white) was sewed on heart&#x27;s side of the jersey and was big in size. With the beginning of professionalism, the crest of the F.C. was created, accompanied by the club initials and the year of founding, 1908.

Until today, the team&#x27;s traditional colours are green and white (green for health, nature, such as physiolatry, and white for virtue), although the white sometimes is omitted, used as trim or as an alternative. During the first years after the establishment of green as Panathinaikos&#x27; primary colour, players were wearing green shirts, white shorts and green socks. During the 1930s, an appearance with characteristic horizontal strips was established. This motive was used also in the next decades as primary or second choice. Since then, the uniform style has changed many times, but green has always remained the team&#x27;s primary colour.

===Shirt sponsors and manufacturers===
Since 1979, when football became professional in Greece, Panathinaikos had a specific kit manufacturer and since 1983 a specific shirt sponsor as well. The following table shows in detail Panathinaikos kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors by year:

==Stadiums and facilities==


Panathinaikos&#x27; traditional home ground since the early 1920s is the Leoforos Alexandras Stadium, the oldest active football stadium in Greece, in the Ampelokipoi district of central Athens. The stadium is located on Alexandras Avenue and is most commonly referred to as &quot;Leoforos&quot; (Greek for &quot;Avenue&quot;). It is considered one of the most historic stadiums in Greece, as it was used by the Greece national football team as home ground for many years (most recently for the UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying matches) and even by Panathinaikos&#x27; biggest rivals, AEK Athens and Olympiacos, on various occasions.

Panathinaikos left &quot;Leoforos&quot; in 1984 to play in the newly built Athens Olympic Stadium. In 2000, then-club president Angelos Filippidis announced a return to the Leoforos Alexandras Stadium, following a €7 million renovation. Capacity was reduced from 25,000 to 16,620, new dressing rooms were built and modular stand roofing was added in compliance with UEFA requirements, but in 2004, stricter standards were announced and the Leoforos Alexandras Stadium would need further expansion were it to remain suitable for UEFA-sanctioned matches. This was precluded by local zoning regulations and the team had to return to the Olympic Stadium once more until a new stadium, the proposed Votanikos Arena, was built. The &quot;Leoforos&quot; ground was due for demolition.

On 27 January 2007, the board of Panathinaikos decided to reuse the Leoforos Alexandras Stadium for the team&#x27;s 2007–08 domestic league and UEFA Cup home games. Additionally, the club officials decided to install new a new pitch, new seats and upgrade the press conference room and the restrooms.

As of October 2013, and due to the club&#x27;s and the country&#x27;s financial troubles, the construction of the Votanikos Arena has stopped and consequently the plans for the demolition of the Leoforos Alexandras Stadium have been put on hold. After another five-year spell at the Olympic Stadium, the team has returned to its traditional home ground once again.

The current president of the club, Giannis Alafouzos, declared his intention for another renovation of the stadium and the capacity increase, while the Panathinaikos Movement made its propositions for a total reconstruction.

In 2019 the owner of Panathinaikos basketball team presented a funding plan for the construction of the new football and basketball stadiums. The Greek government confirmed in 2022 the construction of the new stadiums in the Votanikos area near Eleonas metro station to be completed by 2026.

Paiania used to be the training ground of Panathinaikos since 1981, the same year that the Panathinaikos F.C. Academy was reorganised into one of the best in Greece. It became the farm that trained its top-tier teams&#x27; notable players, such as Giorgos Karagounis, Angelos Basinas, Sotirios Kyrgiakos, Sotiris Ninis, and the Greece national team. In 2013, the club and academy would be moved from Paiania to that of the new Georgios Kalafatis Sports Center in Koropi, to be owned by the club and academy.

==Financial information==
Until 1979, football in Greece was amateur. The team, along with the other departments of Panathinaikos A.O., depended on the financial support of the club&#x27;s members. The president (responsible for all athletic departments) was elected by the board members. In 1979, Greece&#x27;s football turned professional and the Vardinogiannis family purchased the football department. Giorgos Vardinogiannis became the new president. Vardinogiannis family were the owners of the club the next decades.

On 22 April 2008, growing pressure of the fan base over the past 30 years compelled the main shareholder representative of the club, Giannis Vardinogiannis, to announce at a press conference the family would reduce their financial stake in the club from 100 per cent to 50 per cent through an €80 million increase issue of the company&#x27;s capital stock. Negotiations followed and the following were agreed: Nikos Pateras was selected to be the new president; the Vardinogiannis family would hold 56 per cent of the club, the amateur club 10 per cent (same as before) and a group of new shareholders 34 per cent (Pavlos Giannakopoulos, Nikos Pateras, Adamantios Polemis and Andreas Vgenopoulos, plus other minor shareholders).

In 2011, financial problems and management disagreements caused the club to reduce the budget and sell many players. In 2012, the owner of Skai TV, Giannis Alafouzos, devised a plan to take Vardinogiannis&#x27; shares (54.7%) and make them available to fans around Greece so that everyone could contribute, so that Panathinaikos could overcome the crisis. His intention was to create a new, for the Greek athletic standards, supporter-owned football club. On 2 July 2012, the Panathenaic Alliance finally opened to the public so that everyone could be a member and contribute a desired amount in return for privileges. A few days later, Giannis Vardinogiannis gave his shares—54.7% of Panathinaikos—to the Alliance, while the other shareholders maintained their percentage. The members of the Alliance elected a board of directors and club president. The first president elected was Giannis Alafouzos. In 2013, was decided the move of the team from the previous training center of Paiania to a new one, owned by the club. Located in the area of Koropi, Georgios Kalafatis Sports Center became the new training ground and academy base of Panathinaikos.

For the 2014–15 season, the membership had risen up to 8,495 members contributing a total of €2,680,041.

Panathinaikos currently is a partially supporter-owned football club.
According to the latest accounts in 2016 Panathenaic Alliance shares have been reduced to (15%), Giannis Alafouzos through Sortivo International Ltd and his own shares is the largest shareholder at (74%). Giannis Alafouzos suddenly decided to quit the team in September 2017, announcing his departure in a written statement and inviting potential investors to express their interest in buying the team. With rapidly growing doubts about the commitment and the sporting progression of the club, Alafouzos eventually decided to re-invest in the playing and coaching staff around June 2021.

==Supporters==

Panathinaikos was founded by middle class athletes (with Giorgos Kalafatis as a key figure) aiming of spreading and making more known football to the Athenian and Greek public in general. Also, their intention was to create a team for all of Athens and to be connected with the rest of the European football movement, which was already active.

Today, according to UEFA and numerous polls and researches by the biggest newspapers and poll companies in a span of 20 years, Panathinaikos is the second most popular football team in Greece, with the difference behind Olympiacos to be varied between 2% and 9% among the fans. They have the highest popularity in Athens metropolitan area according to many of the corresponding polls, having also a large fanbase in all Greek prefectures, in Cyprus and in the Greek diaspora. They historically have a large fanbase among the highly educated Greek upper class (traditionally representing the old Athenian society), while they are also very popular among the middle and lower classes.

Panathinaikos supporters hold both records of the most season tickets sales (31,091 in 2010) and highest average attendance for a unique season (44,942 in the 1985–86 season) in the history of Greek football.

The main organised supporters of Panathinaikos are known as Gate 13 (established in 1966), the oldest fan association in Greece, which consists of around 80 clubs alongside Greece and Cyprus.
Gate 13 style of supporting includes the use of green fireworks, large and small green flags, displaying of banners and especially the creation of colourful and large choreographies, noisy and constant cheering and other supporters stuff. Gate 13 has over the years become a part of the club by affecting club decisions and by following the club on all occasions.

They share a traditional friendship with the Hungarian club Ferencváros and Ultras Rapid Wien, based mainly on the common green and white colours. Moreover, they have been sharing since the early 10s&#x27; close relations with Dinamo Zagreb&#x27;s Bad Blue Boys (based on their common rivalry with Red Star and Olympiacos fans, capital city teams and mutual respect for each other&#x27;s ultras achievements) and also with Fedayin of A.S. Roma based on the capital city team factor, their mutual respect and the ancient Athens and ancient Roma cultural connection.

PALEFIP (Panhellenic club of Panathinaikos friends) is another supporters organisation.

Panathenaic Alliance, a collective organisation of the fan base, is the major shareholder of the football club, making it currently the only supporter-owned football club in Greece. The members of the Alliance, through elections, compose the board of directors and elect the club&#x27;s president.

Panathinaikos Movement, founded in 2012, is also a Greek political party founded by people with an initial common their love for the sports club of Panathinaikos and the wish for a new stadium for the football team, despite the bureaucracy of the Greek state.

==Statistics and records==


Mimis Domazos holds the record for Panathinaikos appearances, having played 502 first-team matches between 1959 and 1980. Striker Krzysztof Warzycha comes second, having played 390 times. The record for a goalkeeper is held by Takis Ikonomopoulos, with 303 appearances.

==Contribution to the Greece national team==
Overall, Panathinaikos has a significant contribution to the Greece national football team. Giorgos Kalafatis, the founder of Panathinaikos, was the member of the Greece national team that participated in the Inter-Allied Games in Paris, while later he was also a player/manager for Greece in the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp. During the next decades, Panathinaikos highlighted some of the best Greek players in the history of Greek football, who contributed also to the national team (Migiakis, Linoxilakis, Loukanidis, Domazos, Antoniadis, Kapsis, Ikonomopoulos, Saravakos etc.). Six Panathinaikos players were members of the first appearance of the national team in a World Cup in 1994 (Saravakos, Kolitsidakis, Apostolakis, Kalitzakis, Nioplias, Marangos).

Six players of the club were part of the golden team of 2004 that won the UEFA Euro 2004 (UEFA Euro 2004): Giourkas Seitaridis, Angelos Basinas, Giannis Goumas, Dimitris Papadopoulos, Kostas Chalkias, Antonis Nikopolidis .

<doc id="1053153" wikidata="Q1307082" url="?curid=1053153" title="Mazda Sentia">
<text>The is a mid-size rear wheel drive luxury car that was sold by Mazda in Japan from 1991 to 1999 over two generations. It replaced the Mazda Luce nameplate on the Mazda H platform, and continued the tradition of being Mazda&#x27;s largest flagship sedan, which had been in production since the late 1960s.

The Sentia was also built under license in South Korea until October 2002 by Kia, at the Hwaseong Plant (formerly Asan Bay) where it was sold as the Kia Enterprise.
== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Sentia&quot; is derived from the Latin word &quot;&quot;, meaning to sense, feel or hear.
== First generation (HD; 1991–1996)==
Shortly after the release of the fourth-generation Mazda Luce HC in 1986 (1987 in some markets), development began on a successor. Design work took place under chief designer Shunji Tanaka, who began to consider a more unconventional approach in early 1988. After struggling with development of a theme known as &quot;Prince&#x27;s Coach&quot; (after the Japanese Crown Prince, later Emperor, Akihito), leading to an unusually large number of rejected full-size models, a young American designer named Peter Montero was tasked with developing a theme with 1/5 scale model. During development of this theme, Montero proposed that, as a non-luxury brand targeting luxury models, a proper rear-wheel drive proportion should be emphasized. After presentation of the theme to and review of the 1/5 scale model with management, a previous full-scale model was modified by pulling the front wheels forward, lengthening its dash-to-axle distance and shortening its front overhang. Another young designer in Mazda&#x27;s Hiroshima studio, Dori Regev, then developed the final feasibility-proven design, which was approved later that year and frozen on 24 December 1988 for 1991 production, with prototype testing commencing in 1989.

When the Sentia was introduced in Japan, it was also sold at Mazda&#x27;s short-lived exclusive luxury channel as the ɛ̃fini MS-9 as a higher content luxury sedan, with optional items on the Sentia as standard on the MS-9. The Sentia was the largest Mazda sold during this era, and came with a 3.0-liter V6 engine, setting the Sentia as the top level flagship of Mazda. The width dimension has particular significance in Japan, due to dimension regulations, where Japanese consumers pay an additional annual tax for larger vehicles.

The Sentia was marketed by Mazda as having a &quot;front midship&quot; layout: the V6 engine sits behind the front axle, while the fuel tank rests above the rear axle. The implementation of the engine installation behind the front axle showed technology earlier used by Mazda in its rotary-engine powered products, primarily the Mazda RX-7 and the Mazda Cosmo.
To showcase Mazda&#x27;s advanced technology prowess, this iteration of the Sentia also debuted Mazda&#x27;s speed-sensitive four-wheel steering system. At speeds of lower than , the rear wheels steer in an opposite (toe out) direction from the front wheels, in order to reduce the turn radius. At higher speeds they steer in the toe in direction to improve stability.

Solar ventilation system is a setup where amorphous solar cells in the sunroof panel power small ventilation fans located in the trunk area, in order to cool the cabin while the car is parked in the sun. This setup would later be found on the Eunos800/Millenia.

Two engines were available. Both having their roots in prior Mazda V6s, and have no relation to the aluminum KL series found in the Capella-platformed Mazdas. The 3.0-liter JE-ZE received a new variable-length intake manifold to boost its power rating to . The 2.5-liter J5-DE was also available, rated at . Two different engine displacements were offered in Japan so as to give buyers a choice between which annual road tax obligation they were willing to pay. The bigger engine was substantially better equipped with luxury features and conveniences for choosing the larger engine.

=== 929 ===
The HD generation of the 929 appeared in 1991, with the smaller four-cylinder engines dropped in favour of V6 engines only. It was sold as the ɛ̃fini MS-9 under Mazda&#x27;s ill-fated diversification plan. There was no longer a Luce rotary version, and the Cosmo got a new platform as well. A new model, the Sentia, appeared on the same platform. In Canada, the car was known as the 929 Serenia. This was the only year to carry the Mazda &quot;diamond&quot; badge from 1992, and the updated &quot;diamond&quot; badge (a smoother version) to appear on all 1993 models.

The Mazda 929 was available with ABS, full electrics, cruise, 4WS, 4WD (in some markets), as well as a &#x27;solar vent&#x27; that vented the heat from the car.

The Sentia continued for one more generation, but export of the 929 to North America stopped in 1995 with the front-wheel drive Mazda Millenia remaining at the top of the company&#x27;s lineup. The 929 was withdrawn from North America due to a lack of interest in non-luxury brand Japanese imports of this size, evidenced by the withdrawal of the Toyota Cressida in 1992.

During the early 1990s Mazda had considered introducing its own luxury brand, Amati, to compete with Lexus, Infiniti and Acura but later withdrew their plans. The 929 was replaced by the Mazda Millenia as the flagship sedan, but the Millenia is front-wheel drive. 929 Serenia sales ended in Canada after the 1994 model year, and the United States followed suit with the 1995 model year. It was also sold in South Korea as the badge engineered Kia Enterprise, using Mazda-sourced engines.

Engines:
* 2.5 L (2494 cc) &quot;J5-DE&quot; V6, DOHC, 
* 3.0 L (2954 cc) &quot;JE-E&quot; V6, SOHC, /180 lb·ft (245 N·m)

== Second generation (HE; 1995–1999)==
The final HE generation of the Sentia appeared in late 1995 in Asia and in Australia in April 1996 as the 929. The engine remained a carry-over, and the dimensions of the vehicle were reduced from the previous model. Production remained short; exports were halted to Australia in 1997 due to poor sales and an increasingly high price tag (in its final year the 929&#x27;s price had increased to over AUD$83,000 in the Australian market—about the same price as an entry-level BMW 5 Series).

The 1995 Sentia used Mazda&#x27;s updated HE platform, and was the last large RWD sedan from Mazda. Japanese automotive magazine &quot;Best Car Magazine&quot; showed that the car incorporates a number of styling cues from the stillborn Amati 1000. This generation Sentia had been developed with the proposed Mazda flagship in mind. Anticipating that it would take over the role of formal-use vehicles (i.e. chauffeur-driven transport for executives) in the product line, this Sentia is considerably geared towards private owners in its focus. The mechanical underpinnings are largely carried over from the previous Sentia. The exterior and interior received a mild redesign to make the car more stately, and suitable for formal corporate use. This includes a larger grille, taller roofline for improved rear headroom, as well as large expanses of woodgrain panelling.

The Japanese TV advertising campaign featured Sean Connery stating &quot;Sentia...striking!&quot;.

Engines:
* 3.0 L (2,954 cc) JE-E SOHC 18 valve V6
* 3.0 L (2,954 cc) &quot;JE-ZE&quot; DOHC 24 valve V6, 138 kW (185 hp)/

The second-generation Sentia drops the 2.5-liter engine, and uses the 3-liter unit in two different tuning for and respectively.

=== Kia Enterprise ===

The Kia Enterprise was a sedan built by Kia Motors at its Hwaseong Plant and was based on the Mazda Sentia. It was made available for sale in 1998. It was powered by one of three Mazda-sourced petrol engines of 2.5, 3.0, or 3.6 litres. As before, Kia&#x27;s full-size sedan was based on a Mazda platform and its predecessor was called the Kia Potentia. The Enterprise has a FR layout with multilink front and rear suspension. In 2002, it was replaced by the Kia Opirus, a platform shared with the Hyundai Grandeur. The Enterprise was a left hand drive vehicle, while the Sentia was right hand drive. It was the last rebadged Mazda released by Kia motors before the company merged with Hyundai Motor Company due to the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997.

<text>Gottlieb Conrad Christian Storr (June 16, 1749, Stuttgart – February 27, 1821, Tübingen) was a German physician, chemist, and naturalist.

In 1768 he obtained his doctorate from the University of Tübingen, where he also served as a professor of chemistry, botany, and natural history from 1774 to 1801. He is the taxonomic authority of several genera, including &quot;Mellivora&quot;, whose only species is the honey badger (&quot;Mellivora capensis&quot;).

<text>Henry Chandler Cowles (February 27, 1869 – September 12, 1939) was an American botanist and ecological pioneer. A professor at the University of Chicago, he studied ecological succession in the Indiana Dunes of Northwest Indiana. This led to efforts to preserve the Indiana Dunes. One of Cowles&#x27; students, O. D. Frank continued his research.

==Life and work==

Born in Kensington, Connecticut, Cowles attended Oberlin College in Ohio. He studied at the University of Chicago with the plant taxonomist John M. Coulter and the geologist Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin as main teachers. He obtained his PhD in 1898 for his study of vegetation succession on the Lake Michigan sand dunes. The inspiration to these studies came from reading &quot;Plantesamfund&quot; by the Danish botanist and pioneer ecologist Eugen Warming. Cowles studied Danish to be able to read the original and later (1905) visited Warming in Copenhagen. The translation of Warming&#x27;s term into English as &quot;Oecology&quot; led to Cowles becoming one of the primary popularizers of the term ecology in the United States. Cowles was one of the founding members of the Ecological Society of America in 1915.

Cowles married Elizabeth Waller in 1900, and their daughter Harriet was born in 1912.

==Legacy==

One of Cowles&#x27;s field study locations is now named &quot;Cowles Bog&quot; in his honor; Cowles Bog and nearby dune locations were later preserved for the public as part of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore (national park as of February 2019). Cowles Bog is located west of Mineral Springs Road in the Town of Dune Acres, Indiana.

Among Cowles&#x27;s students who advanced American ecology were Victor E. Shelford, William Skinner Cooper, Paul B. Sears, George Damon Fuller, Walter P. Cottam, Arthur G. Vestal and May Theilgaard Watts. Cowles also served as a special field assistant of the United States Geological Survey.

==Works==

His publications include: 
* &quot;Ecological Relations of the Vegetation on the Sand Dunes of Lake Michigan&quot; (1899)
* &quot;Text-Book of Botany&quot;, Volume II: Ecology (1910) (with John Merle Coulter (Volume I, Part I: Morphology) and Charles Reid Barnes (Volume I, Part II: Physiology) 
* &quot;Plant Societies of Chicago and Vicinity&quot; (1901)

<text>Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk (born December 20, 1950) is a professor at the University of Miami&#x27;s School of Architecture and an architect and urban planner in Miami, Florida. 

Plater-Zyberk is considered to be a representative of the New Urbanism school of urban planning, and an advocate of the New Classical school of architecture. She is also a co-founder and principal of DPZ CoDesign, a Miami-based architecture firm.

==Early life and education==
Plater-Zyberk was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Jozafat Plater-Zyberk (1906–1994), an architect, and his wife, Maria Meysztowicz (1911–2000), a professor of French at Villanova University. Plater-Zyberk is an alumna of Sacred Heart Academy Bryn Mawr, and received her undergraduate degree in architecture and urban planning from Princeton University (1972) and a master&#x27;s degree in architecture from the Yale School of Architecture in 1974. She also received an honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts from the Yale School of Architecture in 2023. 

==Career==
In 1977, Plater-Zyberk co-founded the Miami firm Arquitectonica with her husband Andrés Duany, Bernardo Fort-Brescia, Laurinda Hope Spear, and Hervin Romney. Arquitectonica was known for its signature style: a dramatic, expressive high-tech modernism. The firm&#x27;s Atlantis Condominium was featured in the opening credits of the television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;.

In 1980, Duany and Plater-Zyberk founded DPZ CoDesign, based in Miami. DPZ became a leader in the national movement called New Urbanism and distinguished itself by designing traditional towns and transforming existing suburbs into livable downtowns. The firm first received international recognition in the 1980s as the designer of Seaside, Florida, and has completed designs and codes for over two hundred new towns, regional plans, and community revitalization projects.

Plater-Zyberk has taught at the University of Miami School of Architecture since 1979. In 1988, she created a graduate program in Suburb and Town Design after which she continued to explore contemporary issues in city growth and reconstruction with students and faculty. She served as dean of the university&#x27;s School of Architecture from 1995 to 2013, and as dean she hired the architect Léon Krier to design his first public building in Florida for the school of architecture (his only other buildings in America are his former house at Seaside and a meeting hall in the Duany Plater-Zyberk planned resort of Windsor). She has also served as director of the university&#x27;s Center for Urban Community and Design, organizing and promoting numerous design exercises to the benefit of communities throughout South Florida. In the Fall of 2008, Plater-Zyberk was tapped into Iron Arrow Honor Society, the highest Honor attained at the University of Miami. In 2014, she was awarded the Arts &amp; Culture Award by the Coral Gables Community Foundation.

For ten years, Plater-Zyberk was a trustee of Princeton University, where she chaired the university&#x27;s Building Committee during an active period of building and expansion. During her tenure on the Building Committee, the university hired architects such as Robert Venturi, Frank Gehry, and Demetri Porphyrios. Porphyrios designed the Collegiate Gothic Whitman College, the first in a series of new Collegiate Gothic buildings to be built in the historic center of the campus.

Plater-Zyberk is a founder and emeritus board member of the Congress for the New Urbanism, which was established in 1993. She has been a visiting professor at many major North American schools of architecture, has been awarded several honorary doctorates and awards, and lectures frequently. In 2001, she and Duany were awarded the Vincent Scully Prize by the National Building Museum in recognition of their contributions to the American built environment. In 2008, she was appointed to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts. Her recent books include &quot;The New Civic Art&quot; and &quot;Suburban Nation: The Rise of Sprawl and the Decline of the American Dream&quot;.

<text>A revolver cannon is a type of autocannon, commonly used as an aircraft gun. It uses a cylinder with multiple chambers, similar to those of a revolver handgun, to speed up the loading-firing-ejection cycle. Some examples are also power-driven, to further speed the loading process. Unlike a rotary cannon, a revolver cannon only has a single barrel, so its spun weight is lower. Automatic revolver cannons have been produced by many different manufacturers.

== History ==

=== Precursors ===

An early precursor was the Puckle gun of 1718, a large flintlock revolver gun, manually operated. The design idea was impractical, far ahead of what 18th century technology could achieve.

During the 19th century, Elisha Collier and later Samuel Colt used the revolver action to revolutionize handguns.

William A. Alexander of Mobile, Alabama invented a Rapid Firing Cannon Gun made from a design by Captain Weingard, both of whom also helped build the H.L. Hunley submarine. The gun was the prototype for the Gatling Gun. It was made in Mobile, Alabama and was the first to be used in the defense of Mobile. 
When the Confederates had to evacuate Mobile, they placed it on the ship the Magnolia to be shipped further inward for use upriver. The Union was gaining on them so to keep it out of their clutches they pushed it overboard into the river. The Union discovered the gun under the water and fished it out. 
In 1864 Alexander was called back to Mobile, AL. from Charleston, SC, to build one of his Rapid Firing Guns.

The Confederate States of America used a single 2-inch, 5-shot revolver cannon with manually rotated chambers during the Siege of Petersburg. The gun was captured in Danville, Virginia by Union forces on April 27, 1865.

The Hotchkiss revolving cannon of the late 19th century was not a revolver cannon in the modern sense but was rather a Rotary cannon, with multiple barrel allowing for feeding and extraction operations in parallel in different barrels.

In 1905, C. M. Clarke patented the first fully automatic, gas-operated rotary chamber gun, but his design was ignored at the time. Clarke&#x27;s patent came as reciprocating-action automatic weapons like the Maxim gun and the Browning gun were peaking in popularity.

In 1932, the Soviet ShKAS machine gun, 7.62 mm calibre aircraft ordnance used a twelve-round capacity, revolver-style feed mechanism with a single barrel and single chamber, to achieve firing rates of well over 1800 rounds per minute, and as high as 3,000 rounds per minute in special test versions in 1939, all operating from internal gas-operated reloading. Some 150,000 ShKAS weapons were produced for arming Soviet military aircraft through 1945.

Around 1935, Silin, Berezin and Morozenko worked on a 6000 rpm 7.62 mm aircraft machine gun using revolver design, called SIBEMAS (СИБЕМАС), but this was abandoned.

=== Modern ===
It was not until the mid-1940s that the first practical revolver cannon emerged.

The archetypal revolver cannon is the Mauser MK 213 from World War II, from which almost all current weapons are derived. However, various problems, such as only moderate improvements in rate of fire and muzzle velocity, coupled with excessive barrel wear, and the effects of the Allied bombing campaign against German industry, meant that at the end of the war only five prototypes (V1 to V5) of either 20 mm MG 213 or 30 mm MK 213 were finished. In the immediate post-war era the unfinished weapon, and the engineers who worked on it, were seized by the Allies to continue development; Both the British and French worked on the 30 mm versions of the MK 213, producing the ADEN and DEFA, respectively. Switzerland produced the Oerlikon KCA. The American M39 cannon used the 20 mm version, re-chambered for a slightly longer 102 mm cartridge, intermediate between the MK 213&#x27;s 82 mm and Hispano-Suiza HS.404&#x27;s 110 mm case lengths. Several generations of the basic ADEN/DEFA weapons followed, remaining largely unchanged into the 1970s.

Around that time, a new generation of weapons developed, based on the proposed NATO 25 mm caliber standard and the Mauser 27 mm round. A leading example is the Mauser BK-27. In the 1980s, the French developed the GIAT 30, a newer generation power-driven revolver cannon. The Rheinmetall RMK30 modifies the GIAT system further, by venting the gas to the rear to eliminate recoil.

Larger experimental weapons have also been developed for anti-aircraft use, like the Anglo-Swiss twin barrel but single chamber 42 mm Oerlikon RK 421 given the code name &quot;Red King&quot; and the related single-barrel &quot;Red Queen&quot; - all of which were cancelled during development. The largest to see service is the Rheinmetall Millennium 35 mm Naval Gun System.

Soviet revolver cannon are less common than Western ones, especially on aircraft. A mechanism for a Soviet revolver-based machine gun was patented in 1944. The virtually unknown Rikhter R-23 was fitted only to some Tu-22 models, but later abandoned in favor of the two-barrel, Gast gun Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23 in the Tu-22M. The Rikhter R-23 does have the distinction of being fired from the space station Salyut 3. The Soviet navy has also adopted a revolver design, the NN-30, typically in a dual mount in the AK-230 turret.

== Characteristics ==
With a single barrel mated to a cylinder with multiple chambers, this type of autocannon uses the revolver principle to accelerate the cycle of loading, firing and ejecting multiple rounds of ammunition, achieving a very high rate of fire compared to conventional cannon of the same calibre.

=== Compared to rotary autocannon ===
Automatic revolver cannons generally have a lower maximum sustained rate of fire than that of rotary cannons because their barrel suffers from much higher heating loads, as it alone must fire every round. Rotary autocannons are capable of a rate of fire of up to 10,000 rounds per minute (such as the Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-23), while revolver cannons are capable of a rate of fire of up to 2,500 rounds per minute (such as the GIAT 30). However, revolver cannons are generally able to be made much lighter than rotary autocannons, requiring less support and mounting hardware—rotary autocannons spin the whole multiple barrel and breech assembly, which, in equal caliber versions, can weigh hundreds of kilograms more in comparison (though the weight per rounds fired per minute is lower for the rotary). The firing rate of a rotary autocannon is directly related to the rotational speed of the barrel cluster. The need to accelerate this cluster generally requiring a large, external power supply means that the maximum attainable rate of fire is not immediately available. In addition, rotaries suffer from lower accuracy, due to dispersion caused by multiple barrels rotating at a varying speed. As a result of their design, revolver cannons do not suffer from these issues.

<doc id="1053173" wikidata="Q7787391" url="?curid=1053173" title="Thomas Barlow (bishop)">
<text>Thomas Barlow (1607, 1608 or 1609 – 8 October 1691) was an English academic and clergyman, who became Provost of The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, and Bishop of Lincoln. He was seen in his own time and by Edmund Venables in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; to have been a trimmer (conforming politically for advancement&#x27;s sake), and have a reputation mixed with his academic and other writings on casuistry. His views were Calvinist and strongly anti-Catholic – he was among the last English bishops to dub the Pope Antichrist. He worked in the 1660s for &quot;comprehension&quot; of nonconformists, but supported a crackdown in the mid-1680s. Despite his anti-Catholic prejudices, Barlow declared loyalty to James II of England upon his accession.

==Early life==
Barlow was the son of Richard Barlow of Long-gill in the parish of Orton, Eden in Westmorland (now Cumbria). He was educated at Appleby grammar school. Aged 16, he entered Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, as a servitor, rising to be a tabarder (scholar). He took his BA degree in 1630 and his MA in 1633, when he was elected a fellow of his college. In 1635 he was appointed metaphysical reader to the university, being seen as a master of casuistry, logic, and philosophy. Among his pupils was John Owen.

He associated at Oxford with Robert Sanderson and particularly with Robert Boyle, who made Oxford his chief residence from 1654 to 1668. Barlow was a learned Calvinist, who opposed Jeremy Taylor and George Bull, and with Thomas Tully was one of the guardians in Interregnum Oxford of acceptable orthodoxy. On the death of John Rouse, Barlow was elected to the librarianship of the Bodleian on 6 April 1652, a post he held until he succeeded to the Lady Margaret professorship in 1660. He favoured the scholars Anthony à Wood, Anthony Horneck, whom he had appointed as chaplain in Queen&#x27;s, and Thomas Fuller, and was hospitable to Christopher Davenport. He spoke of infant baptism in a letter to John Tombes, which later affected his prospect of preferment.

Barlow retained his fellowship in 1648 with support from John Selden and his former pupil John Owen, having contributed anonymously a tract on the parliamentary visitation of Oxford in that year. He became Provost of his college in 1657. In 1658 he brought tactful support to Sanderson on behalf of Boyle.

==Under Charles II==
On the Restoration, Barlow was one of the commissioners for restoring the members of the university who had been ejected in 1648 and expelling the intruders. On behalf of John Owen, molested for preaching in his own house, he mediated with Edward Hyde, the Lord Chancellor. Henry Wilkinson was removed as Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity on 25 September 1660, in favour of Barlow. A few days before, on 1 September, he had taken his degree of D.D., one of a batch of loyalists created doctors by royal mandate. On the death of Barton Holiday in 1661, Barlow was appointed Archdeacon of Oxford, but there was a delay caused by a dispute between him and Thomas Lamplugh, ultimately decided in Barlow&#x27;s favour, who was eventually installed on 13 June 1664. Barlow meanwhile was accused by Wood of underhand meddling in the election of Thomas Clayton to the wardenship of Merton College in 1661.

Barlow wrote at the request of Robert Boyle an elaborate treatise on &quot;Toleration in Matters of Religion&quot; at this time, but it was not published until after his death (in &quot;Cases of Conscience&quot;, 1692). Barlow&#x27;s reasoning is based more on expediency than on principle. He shows that the religious toleration he advocates does not extend to atheists, papists or Quakers. Earlier, when Jews were applying to Cromwell for readmission into England, Barlow had composed &quot;at the request of a person of quality&quot; a tract on &quot;Toleration of the Jews in a Christian State&quot;, published in the same collection. On the other hand, Barlow was one of a group of Oxford grandees hostile to the Royal Society, along with John Fell, Obadiah Walker, and Thomas Pierce. He was an enemy of the &quot;new philosophy&quot; (as propounded by leading Royal Society members), giving as his confessional reasons that it was &quot;impious if not plainly atheistic, set on foot and carried on by the arts of Rome,&quot; so designing to ruin the Protestant faith by disabling men from defending the truth. He noted the Catholic background of Descartes, Gassendi, Mersenne and Du Hamel. His &quot;Directions to a young Divine for his Study of Divinity&quot; of this period contain a catalogue of theological works classified by subjects, with remarks on their value and character.

As pro-vice-chancellor of the university in 1673, he called in question William Richards, Chaplain of All Souls College, for Arminian doctrine in a sermon at St Mary&#x27;s. He censured on doctrinal lines the publication of George Bull&#x27;s &quot;Harmonia Apostolica&quot;. He wrote much in this period, but published little. &quot;Mr. Cottington&#x27;s Divorce Case&quot;, on which Barlow&#x27;s reputation as an ecclesiastical lawyer and casuistic divine mainly rests, was written in 1671.

Barlow was prominent in two abortive schemes of comprehension (inclusion into the state church) set on foot in October 1667 and February 1668. The &quot;Comprehensive Bill&quot;, based on the Declaration of Breda, was drawn up by Sir Robert Atkyns and Sir Matthew Hale, and revised and endorsed by Barlow and his friend John Wilkins. Its introduction was frustrated by a Commons declaration and the plan was finally dropped. Barlow had some part in the release of John Bunyan from Bedford gaol in 1677.

In 1675, Barlow became Bishop of Lincoln through the good offices of two secretaries of state, Sir Joseph Williamson and Henry Coventry, both graduates of Queen&#x27;s College, the latter having been his pupil; Gilbert Sheldon was opposed. Barlow&#x27;s consecration (on 27 June) did not occur in the customary Lambeth Chapel, but in the chapel attached to the Holborn palace of the Bishop of Ely (then Peter Gunning). George Morley of Winchester was the consecrating prelate. Barlow resided mostly at Buckden Palace, near Huntingdon, and was accused of never having entered his own cathedral. The Bishop&#x27;s Palace at Lincoln had still not been repaired after the damage done in the English Civil War, although George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax remonstrated with Barlow on the subject in 1684.

Barlow told his friend Sir Peter Pett that the real ground of hostility was not his avoidance of Lincoln, but his continuing hostility to Catholicism. In 1678, when Titus Oates forwarded his theory of a Popish Plot, Barlow had publicly declared enmity to the papists and their supposed leader, James, Duke of York. When the bill enforcing a test against popery was introduced, which excluded such peers from the House of Lords, Gunning of Ely defended the church of Rome from the charge of idolatry, but Barlow answered him vehemently. In 1680, while the Popish Plot panic was still at its height, he republished under the title of &quot;Brutum Fulmen&quot;, the papal bulls of Pius V and Paul III, pronouncing the excommunication and deposition of Queen Elizabeth and of Henry VIII, with inflammatory comments, and learned proofs that &quot;the pope is the great Antichrist, the man of sin, and the son of perdition.&quot; In 1682 appeared Barlow&#x27;s answer to &quot;whether the Turk or pope be the greater Antichrist.&quot; He confirmed this in a letter of 1684 to the Earl of Anglesey, arguing again that &quot;the pope is Antichrist.&quot;

When in 1684 Henry Viscount St John was convicted of killing Sir William Estcourt in a brawl, and Charles II used the royal prerogative for his pardon, Bishop Barlow published an elaborate tract (1684–1685) in support of regal power to dispense with penal laws. This was succeeded by &quot;a case of conscience&quot;, proving that kings and supreme powers had authority to dispense with the positive precept condemning murderers to death. In the same year (1684), as the persecutions of nonconformists increased in violence and the quarter sessions of Bedford published &quot;a sharp order&quot; enforcing strict conformity, Barlow issued a letter to the clergy of his diocese requiring them to publish the order in their churches. A &quot;free answer&quot; was written to this letter by John Howe.

==Under James II==
When the Catholic James II became king, Barlow swiftly declared loyal affection to the new sovereign. When James issued his first declaration for liberty of conscience, Barlow was one of four bishops who sent an address of thanks to the sovereign and caused it to be signed by 600 of his clergy. He also issued a letter defending his conduct. James Gardiner, then sub-dean, was a strong whig and refused to sign the address, but on the appearance of the second declaration of 1688, Barlow addressed an equivocal letter to his clergy (on 29 May 1688).

==Under William and Mary==
William and Mary, on coming to the throne, demanded a new oath of hostility toward Rome. Barlow voted with the bishops that James had abdicated and took the oaths to his successors. He was reportedly ready to replace non-jurors in his diocese. Barlow died at Buckden on 8 October 1691 aged 84 and was buried in the chancel of the parish church, by his own desire in the same grave as his predecessor William Barlow. A monument on the north wall commemorates both in an epitaph of his composition.

==Works==
Thomas Barlow&#x27;s writings include:
*&quot;Exercitationes aliquot metaphysicae de Deo&quot; (1637)
*&quot;Plain reasons why a Protestant of the Church of England should not turn Roman Catholic&quot; (1688)
*&quot;Cases of Conscience&quot; (1692)

==Library Collections==
At his death in 1691, Barlow bequeathed 54 manuscript volumes and a variety of printed books to the Bodleian Library. About 600 books from Barlow&#x27;s collection, especially duplicates (books already owned by the Bodleian) went to the library of Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. The printed books from Barlow&#x27;s library, which was finally assimilated into the Bodleian in 1694, are currently held under the shelfmark &quot;Linc.&quot; for &quot;Linconiensis&quot;, a reference to Barlow&#x27;s title as the Bishop of Lincoln.

According to William Poole, &quot;Barlow’s books are of especial value because he was a compulsive annotator.&quot; A staunch Calvinist, Barlow often made annotations to argue with the theology of the authors he read. Poole adds that Barlow &quot;marked&quot; books as though he were reading &quot;tutorial essays&quot; from students. Barlow&#x27;s annotations have also been useful to scholars because he often made biographical notes about authors, other works they had written, and other editions of the same work.

Many of the printed books in Barlow&#x27;s library that are currently held at the Bodleian reflect his interest in theology, the reign of Charles I, and events during the English Civil War and Interregnum. These include many shorter polemical pamphlets and tracts related to volatility in the 1640s and 50s such as

*F 2.63(25) Linc.: &quot;A declaration: or, representation from His Excellencie, Sir Tho. Fairfax, and the Army under his command: Humbly tendred to the Parliament concerning the just and fundamental rights and liberties of themselves and the kingdom&quot;. (1647)
*C 13.13(45) Linc.: &quot;Matters of great note and consequence: 1 Divers questions upon his Majesties last answer concerning the militia resolved upon by both Houses of Parliament to be of dangerous consequence. 2 A true relation of the strange and untimely deathes which hath successively befalen all the nobility and others, which have beene the possessors of Shirborne Castle, in Dorset-shire since that it was unlawfully usurped and taken from the church by King Stephen in Anno Dom. 1100. Which castle is now in the possession of George Lord Digby, and how the case stands with him I leave to the courteous reader to censure. Whereunto is added, certaine articles of high treason against the said Lord Digby&quot; (1642)
*C 14 6[9] Linc.: &quot;A short story of the rise, reign, and ruine of the Antinomians, familists &amp; libertines, that infected the churches of New-England: and how they were confuted by the Assembly of ministers there: as also of the magistrates proceedings in court against them. Together with Gods strange and remarkable judgements from heaven upon some of the chief fomenters of these opinions; and the lamentable death of Ms. Hutchison. Very fit for these times; here being the same errours amongst us, and acted by the same spirit. Published at the instant request of sundry, by one that was an eye and eare-witnesse of the carriage of matters there&quot;. (1644)

Barlow&#x27;s manuscripts at the Bodleian cover a range of subjects, genres, and time periods. These include

*Medieval literature: 
**Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; (MS Barlow 20)
*Classical rhetoric:
**Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De inventione rhetorica&quot; (MS Barlow 40)
*Church history:
**Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; (MS Barlow 3)
**Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; (MS Barlow 39)
*Contemporary theology:
**&quot;The Presbyterian Platforme simply sett downe&quot; (MS Barlow 19)
*Papers written by Barlow&#x27;s fellow Bishop James Ussher whose work Barlow helped edit:
**MS Barlow 10

<text>Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger (17 September 1803 near Grottkau, Silesia, Kingdom of Prussia – 30 December 1863 in Berlin) was a German zoologist and ornithologist.

Gloger was the first person to recognise the structural differences between swallows and swifts, and also the first to put up artificial bat boxes.

He was the originator of what is now known as Gloger&#x27;s rule, which states that dark pigments increase in races of animals (birds were the examples in which he originally noticed the pattern) living in warm and humid habitats. He put forward this theory in his &quot;Das Abändern der Vögel durch Einfluss des Klimas&quot; (1833). The exact way this pattern is actually caused is still unclear, but in birds it has been suggested that darker pigmented plumage provides protection against feather-degrading bacteria, whose activity is greater in warm and humid regions. His other works include &quot;Gemeinnütziges Hand- und Hilfsbuch der Naturgeschichte&quot; (1841).

<text>The West Cheshire Association Football League (commonly known as the West Cheshire League) is an English football league in the county of Cheshire, which also includes teams from Merseyside. Its current principal sponsor is &quot;Carlsberg&quot;, also sponsor of the South West Peninsula League. It has a Division One, Division Two and Division Three. Division One sits at step 7 (or level 11) of the National League System.

The top five teams may be eligible for promotion to the North West Counties Football League Division One. After several triumphs in Division One, Cammell Laird was promoted to the North West Counties League in 2004, and its reserve team, which had won Division Two, was promoted to Division One. It was the only team since Vauxhall Motors to be promoted from the league, until Runcorn Town was promoted in 2010. In 2014, Vauxhall Motors returned to the league.

The league also runs cup competitions.

<text>H3 is a pyrotechnic composition which is used mostly as a burst charge for small diameter shells. It is friction and shock sensitive, as are most compositions containing chlorates. For this reason, H3 should be mixed using the &quot;diaper method&quot; and not with a ball mill. The composition consists of:

*Potassium chlorate (KClO3) (oxidizing agent) - 75%
*Charcoal (fuel) - 25%
*Dextrin (binder) - 2% (additional percent)

Due to the potassium chlorate, H3 should not be mixed with sulfur or compositions containing sulfur, as sulfur increases the sensitivity of the mixture.

She completed her schooling at Rajah&#x27;s Higher Secondary School in Nileshwaram. She began learning classical dance whilst at school and participated in various dance competitions. 

==Acting career==
Kavya first appeared as a child artist in Kamal&#x27;s film &quot;Pookkalam Varavayi&quot; (1991) at the age of six in a cameo role along the students in a bus. Subsequently, she was offered parts in other projects such as &quot;Pavam IA Ivachan&quot; (1994), &quot;Parassala Pachan Payyannur Paramu&quot; (1994) by P. Venu and &quot;Azhakiya Ravanan&quot; (1996), directed by Kamal. She was offered one of the female lead in &quot;Chandranudikkunna Dikkil&quot;, also starring Dileep, in 1999. After the success of &quot;Chandranudikkunna Dikhil&quot;, Kavya and Dileep became a popular pairing in Malayalam cinema, and they worked together in 21 movies. Some of their movies are &quot;Thenkasipattanam&quot; (2000),&quot; Darling Darling&quot; (2000), &quot;Dhosth&quot; (2001), &quot;Meesa Madhavan&quot; (2002) which was one of biggest grosser of the year and was directed by Lal Jose, &quot;Mizhi Randilum&quot; (2003) in which she played a double role, &quot;Sadanandante Samayam&quot; (2003), &quot;Thilakkam&quot; (2003) directed by Jayaraj, &quot;Runway&quot; (2004) directed by Joshiy, &quot;Kochi Rajavu&quot; (2005), &quot;Lion&quot; (2006) again directed by Joshiy, &quot;Chakkaramuthu&quot; (2006), &quot;Inspector Garud&quot; (2007), &quot;Paappi Appacha&quot; (2010), &quot;Vellaripravinte Changathi&quot; (2011) and &quot;Pinneyum&quot; (2016). Most of their movies were in the romantic comedy genre.

She also acted in films with Mammootty and Mohanlal, and in movies with several stars, such as &quot;Ee Pattanathil Bhootham&quot;, &quot;Christian Brothers&quot; and &quot;China Town&quot;.

She got critical acclaim for her performance of the role of Ganga in &quot;Perumazhakkalam&quot; for which she won 2004 Kerala State Film Award for Best Actress and for the role of Ashwati in &quot;Gaddama&quot; where she played a housemaid working in Saudi Arabia.

She was cast in Adoor Gopalakrishnan&#x27;s &quot;Naalu Pennungal&quot; in which she played a supporting role.

Though she had many offers from Tamil cinema, she was very reluctant to act due to her busy schedule in Malayalam. Her first was &quot;Kasi&quot; (2001) which was the remake of Vinayans &quot;Vasanthiyum Lakshmiyum Pinne Njaanum&quot;. She went on to act in &quot;En Mana Vaanil&quot; and &quot;Sadhu Miranda&quot; and enjoyed moderate success.

She also sang songs for the movies &quot;Hadiya&quot; (2017) and &quot;Daivame Kaithozham K. Kumar Akanam&quot; (2018).

From acting as a child to acting as an actress, Sreeja has provided voice to her in many films. Devi, Praveena, Bhagyalakshmi and Vimmy Mariam George and Nithuna Nevil Dinesh have also lent their voices in some films.

<text>The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico () is the territorial legislature of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, responsible for the legislative branch of the government of Puerto Rico. The Assembly is a bicameral legislature consisting of an upper house, the Senate (Spanish: &quot;Senado&quot;) normally composed of 27 senators, and the lower house, the House of Representatives (Spanish: &quot;Cámara de Representantes&quot;) normally consisting of 51 representatives. Eleven members of each house are elected at-large rather than from a specific legislative district with all members being elected for a four-year term without term limits.

The structure and responsibilities of the Legislative Assembly are defined in Article III of the Constitution of Puerto Rico which vests all legislative power in the Legislative Assembly. Every bill must be passed by both houses and signed by the Governor of Puerto Rico to become law. Each house has its unique powers. The constitution also states that each house shall be the unique judge on the legal capacity of its members. The constitution also grants parliamentary immunity to all elected members of the Legislative Assembly.

The assembly currently in session is the 19th Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico, composed of the 27th Senate and the 31st House of Representatives.

The Legislative Assembly convenes at the Capitol in San Juan.

==History==

The House of Representatives is the oldest legislative body in Puerto Rico. It was formed on November 25, 1897, when the Spanish government of Prime Minister Práxedes Mateo Sagasta granted autonomy to the archipelago, creating a House that was composed of 32 members. In addition to the House, there was also an Administrative Council of 15 members, eight of whom were elected by a &quot;Colegio de Compromisarios&quot; and the other seven were named by the Governor General in representation of the Spanish monarch.

After Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States on July 25, 1898, as part of the Spanish–American War, a military government was imposed archipelago. This was until April 12, 1900, when the U.S. Congress approved the first civil government for Puerto Rico under the federal Foraker Act. The act granted the archipelago with a civil governor (named by the U.S. President) and a House of Delegates composed of 35 members elected by the people of Puerto Rico, as well as an Executive Council of 11 members, designated all by the U.S. president, and six sitting members consisting of the governor&#x27;s cabinet.

The political arrangement under the Foraker Act continued until 1917. On March 2 of that year, president Woodrow Wilson approved the Jones–Shafroth Act (), which provided for the creation of an completely separate legislative branch with regards to the Executive branch in sections 25-39 of the statute. It established a House of Representatives with 39 members and a Senate of 19 members, all elected directly by the people of the unincorporated territory. Puerto Rico was then divided into 7 senatorial districts and 35 house districts. The first Senate of Puerto Rico was elected in July 1917.
The unincorporated territory is divided into 8 senatorial and 40 House districts. On July 25, 1952, the Constitution of Puerto Rico was formally adopted, establishing the current House of Representantes and Senate as the bicameral houses of the Legislative Assembly (as stated in Article III).

==Powers==
The Constitution of Puerto Rico vests all legislative powers in the Legislative Assembly. Each house has the sole power to be the judge of the legal capacities of its members. The members of both houses are protected by parliamentary immunity, which Article III, Section 14 states &quot;no member of the Legislative Assembly shall be imprisoned...&quot;, they also shall not be held accountable for anything said in the floor.

Each House holds exclusive powers that are not given to the other. The House of Representatives has the exclusive power to initiate an impeachment process and the Senate the exclusive power to pass judgement. All laws dealing with the commonwealth budget or taxes must originate in the House of Representatives. The Senate retains the exclusive power to extend its consent to appointments to government offices made by the governor (judges, cabinet secretaries and others) as stated by law or Constitution.

The Legislative Assembly, with the consent of two-thirds of each chamber may propose amendments to the constitution. Proposed amendments are then subject to approval by the people of Puerto Rico in a referendum. It also has the power to consolidate or create municipalities.

==Qualifications==
Under Article III, Sections 5 and 6, members of the Legislative Assembly must be fluent in either Spanish or English, must be a citizen of the United States and Puerto Rico, and have resided in Puerto Rico for at least two years prior to their election. Senators must be at least 30 years old, while House representatives must be at least 25 years old. Both Senators and Representatives (except those elected at-large) must reside in their constituent district at least one year prior to their election.

==Sessions==
The following is a list of legislative assemblies, with a count starting on the legislature elected in the 1948 Puerto Rican general election, following the enactment of the Puerto Rico Elective Governor Act of 1947 by president Harry S. Truman.

==Moves to unicameralism==
Act No. 477 of September 23, 2004 provided for a referendum to be held on July 10, 2005, in which Puerto Rican voters were to indicate if they favored changing the Legislative Assembly to a single house, or maintain the bicameral legislature established by the 1917 Jones Act, which had been retained (with modifications) by the 1952 Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. A vote for unicameralism would constitute a mandate for the Legislative Assembly to hold a second referendum on July 9, 2007, on the constitutional amendment that would establish a unicameral legislature by 2009.

In the unicameral referendum held on July 10, 2005, Puerto Rican voters approved a mandate for the Legislative Assembly to hold a second referendum on the constitutional amendment that would establish unicameral legislature by 456,267 votes in favor, versus 88,720 against; voter turnout was only 22.6%, the lowest turnout figure in Puerto Rico&#x27;s electoral history, vastly below the 81.7% that had gone to the polls just a few months earlier for the general election. Another referendum was scheduled for July 2007 to approve the specific amendments to the Constitution of Puerto Rico that are required for the change. However, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico ruled in June that it could not force the Legislative Assembly to initiate a constitutional amendment process to become a single chamber legislature. Further moves to unicameralism have been tabled.

<doc id="1053214" wikidata="Q2406502" url="?curid=1053214" title="Thornton, West Yorkshire">
<text>Thornton is a village and former civil parish, within the metropolitan borough of the City of Bradford, in West Yorkshire, England. It lies to the west of the city centre of Bradford, and together with neighbouring Allerton, had a total resident population in 2001 of 15,004, increasing to 17,276 in 2011 and 18,520 in 2021. Its most famous residents were the Brontës.

The preserved centre of the village retains the character of a typical Pennine village, with stone-built houses with stone flagged roofs. The surrounding areas consist of more modern housing, particularly towards the eastern and western edges of the village, still isolated from the rest of the city of Bradford by green fields.

== Geography and administration ==
Thornton derives from Old English and means a thorn tree at a farm or settlement. It was mentioned in the Domesday Book of the 11th century, when it had been laid waste by William the Conqueror&#x27;s harrying of the North, punishment for an uprising against the Norman invaders of 1066.

Thornton was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Bradford, becoming a civil parish in its own right in 1866. In 1865 Thornton was declared to be a Local Government District, administered by a local board. Such local boards became urban district councils under the Local Government Act 1894. Thornton Urban District existed for less than five years; in 1899 it was incorporated into the city of Bradford. The civil parish of Thornton continued to exist until 1974, but as an urban parish it had no parish council, being directly administered by the city council. In 1951 the parish had a population of 6097.

The parish was abolished in 1974 when the larger City of Bradford metropolitan borough was created, since when it has been an unparished area. Thornton comprises part of the Thornton and Allerton ward. It falls within the parliamentary constituency of Bradford West.

Its elevation, poor soils, isolation from major transport routes, and rainfall of close to 1000mm per year has limited its farming productivity. Resources such as coal, iron and sandstone, the development of turnpike roads, and the coming of the railways enabled Thornton to share in the prosperity generated by the 19th-century wool worsted trade. The increasing use of steam-powered mills (at the expense of the former cottage-industry production methods) concentrated production in the valleys of the city centre. Foreign imports, the Second World War, and closure of the railways, all contributed to the decline in manufacturing. Today, Thornton is often treated as a residential suburb of Bradford.

The main thoroughfare through the village was Market Street, until this road was bypassed in 1826 by the new Thornton Road (B6145). In the two centuries after its construction, most building work has since taken place along Thornton Road, extending the village down the slope of the hill it sits upon. This has left Market Street largely untouched and it retains its original character and stonework on the buildings. Market Street therefore forms the backbone of the conservation area in the village, while Thornton Road remains the main artery for traffic to Bradford, Allerton, Halifax, Keighley and Denholme.

== Notable residents ==
Thornton&#x27;s most famous residents were the Brontës. The Rev Patrick Brontë became the incumbent of Thornton Chapel in 1815, and Charlotte, Branwell, Emily and Anne Brontë were born at 74 Market Street, Thornton before the family moved to Haworth. In November 2023 the house was purchased by a campaign group which aims to restore and preserve the house as the Brontë Birthplace. The remains of the church where the father preached, known as the Bell Chapel, can be seen in the restored old graveyard off Thornton Road opposite the current church. The long Brontë Way passes through Thornton on its way between Gawthorpe Hall in Lancashire and Oakwell Hall in the Birstall area.

Professional wrestler Les Kellett had a small holding and café called &quot;The Terminus&quot;, where trolleybuses terminated before returning to Bradford, with his wife Margaret. On behind the house Kellett sometimes bred pigs and once said he kept fifty head of cattle.

==Thornton Viaduct==

Thornton Viaduct was a railway viaduct for the Great Northern Railway line running from Queensbury to Keighley via Thornton. It was built in an S-shape to allow a smooth access to Thornton railway station. 
The viaduct is now a Grade II listed building.

The viaduct was reopened as part of The Great Northern Railway Trail between Cullingworth and Queensbury along the track bed in 2009, with a final link up to Queensbury opening in 2012.

<doc id="1053216" wikidata="Q1081171" url="?curid=1053216" title="Christian Motorcyclists Association">
<text>The Christian Motorcyclists Association (CMA) is an international Christian non-profit organization established in 1975. Its purpose is evangelizing to the motorcycling community.

==History==
CMA was started by Herb Shreve, an Arkansas pastor who purchased a motorcycle to close the generation gap with his rebellious son. He began evangelizing motorcycle rallies, and in 1975, he resigned from his church to start CMA.
The organization grew to over 125,000 members and over 1200 chapters in all 50 states, and then gained chapters in 31 foreign countries, through the CMA International Ministry. René Changuion started CMA South Africa in 1980 and was the first country to be in the CMA International Coalition, now called CMA International. The UK organization was formed in 1983 when members of the Christian Bikers Association, established in the UK in 1979, approached the CMA in the USA and South Africa.

==Organization==
CMA is not a club but a ministry. This distinguishes CMA from other biker motorcycle clubs that associate due to manufacturer brand loyalty or riding style. CMA&#x27;s ministry team program is designed to &quot;make ministers of their members.&quot; This implies a breakdown of the traditional distinction between clergy and laity that exist in most Christian ministries. Members are associated with the national organization and then independently may become members of local chapters.

CMA operates under a Board of Directors working in conjunction with six regional evangelists, a Lead evangelist, and Special Projects Evangelist, in order to support the goals and objectives of the organization. The current Chairman is John Ogden, Sr. This leadership team oversees CMA from a national level by appointing other state, area, and local leaders across the country. The headquarters is in Hatfield, Arkansas.

CMA publishes a monthly magazine, &quot;Heartbeat&quot;. The CMA is a member of Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA) and Evangelical Press Association (EPA).

CMA (UK), which has an estimated 1,000 members, has an outreach arm called Holy Joe&#x27;s whose members provide a cafe and helmet park at motorcycling shows and events. Proceeds from these and HJ&#x27;s annual bike show are donated to charities such as emergency medical motorcycle couriers Freewheelers EVS.

<text>Daniel Darko Luger MBE (born 11 January 1975) is a former English rugby union international who was a member of the squad that won the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

== Rugby career ==

===Club career===

Dan Luger was born in Chiswick and is the son of a Croatian father (head of Croatia&#x27;s rugby federation) and Czech mother. Dan was firstly educated at Ashton House School, then moving on to Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith joining local club Richmond as a junior.

Dan Luger played top flight rugby as a left or right wing for a number of England Premiership clubs from 1994 to 2003. He began as a junior at Richmond graduating to the senior XV before his twentieth birthday. Then he went on to play for he play for Orrel where he was first selected for the national team at U-21 level. His blistering pace stopped Orrell being relegated that season and he moved on to his first spell at Harlequins where he prospered earning the first of his full England caps. Luger suffered a series of injuries but was harlequins highest try scorer. He left the club following 1998–99 season and the Rugby World Cup where England lost in the quarter final to South Africa. He made the second highest metres gained in the tournament behind Jonah Lomu.

He joined London rivals Saracens for two injury hit seasons before returning to Harlequins where he continued being one of England and the British and Irish Lions star players. In 2003 he began a three-season stint with USA Perpignan in Catalonia where he became a French top 14 champion. On leaving Perpignan he played for RC Toulon where he went on to win the French pro D2 championship and was the club&#x27;s highest try scorer and Rugby Nice Côte d&#x27;Azur where he combined playing with a coaching role.

===International career===

Although plagued by injury, his international record is exceptional: 24 tries in 38 matches. Only five players have scored more England tries having started his international career by scoring in both of his first two internationals against the Netherlands and Italy in World Cup qualifiers in 1998.

He made his first appearance for England A against Argentina at Northampton in December 1996 having played earlier that year in the World Students Cup in South Africa and for England U21s.

Luger made his international début in 1998, showing promise in the autumn 1999 World Cup qualification games, one against the Netherlands. He played in the 1999 Rugby World Cup, scoring a notable try against Fiji.

In November 2000, Luger scored a famous last minute match-winning try in an versus match. Iain Balshaw kicked ahead and he touched down in the corner, with eight minutes of injury time played.

During the 2001 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia, Luger scored a hat-trick of tries in the opening match against Western Australia. However, an injury ended his tour, when he fractured a cheekbone in a training accident.

A try from him topped the 42-6 Grand Slam victory over Ireland at Lansdowne Road back in April 2003 and he was again on the score sheet in August when he touched down in England&#x27;s 43-9 humbling of Wales at the Millennium Stadium during the World Cup warm-up matches.

He came on as an illegal substitute during the England-Samoa game at the 2003 Rugby World Cup, when the player he was intended to replace (Mike Tindall) hadn&#x27;t left the field before Luger came on. Luger even made a tackle before being ordered off the field again. This led to a dispute over whether England should be fined, or perhaps even docked points as a penalty for having sixteen players on the field for a short period of time. Ultimately England were fined £10,000. He did not receive a cap for this appearance, a decision made by Clive Woodward. He was an integral part of the world champion winning side.

Luger was also a notable England Sevens player playing at international level for a number of years to 2006.

==Bobsleigh==
In 2009, along with Olympic medalists, Jason Gardener and Craig MacLean, and World Championship medal-winning decathlete, Dean Macey, he took part in the British Bobsleigh Championships at Cesana Pariol in Italy. He was given the position of driver and his brakeman was Craig. They qualified for the British championship. However, during their initial run Craig suffered several injuries after a collision on the track, and the duo were forced to withdraw from the competition on advice from medical specialists.

==Financial services career==
Luger has worked in financial sales, trading and hedge funds.

==Peace Commitment==
Dan Luger is a member of the &#x27;Champions for Peace&#x27; club, a group of famous elite athletes committed to serving peace in the world through sport, created by Peace and Sport, a Monaco-based international organization.

<doc id="1053227" wikidata="Q1939" url="?curid=1053227" title="Nicolas Anelka">
<text>Nicolas Sébastien Anelka (born 14 March 1979) is a French professional football manager and former player who played as a forward. As a player, he regularly featured in his country&#x27;s national team, often scoring at crucial moments. Known for his ability to both score and assist goals, he has been described as a classy and quick player, with good aerial ability, technique, shooting, and movement off the ball, and was capable of playing both as a main striker and as a second striker.

Anelka began his career at Paris Saint-Germain, but soon moved to Arsenal. At Arsenal, he won the 1997–98 Premier League and FA Cup double. He became a first team regular and won the PFA Young Player of the Year Award the following season. He moved to Real Madrid for £22.3 million in 1999. He was part of the Real Madrid team that won the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League, but he did not settle in well and returned to PSG in a £20 million deal. Despite regular first team football in Paris, Anelka set his eyes upon the Premier League once more, moving on loan to Liverpool in January 2002 before joining Manchester City for £13 million at the start of the 2002–03 season.

After three seasons in Manchester, he moved to Turkish club Fenerbahçe for two seasons, before returning to England to join Bolton Wanderers in deals worth £7 million and £8 million respectively. He was then transferred to Chelsea from Bolton for a reported £15 million in January 2008. At Chelsea, he won one Premier League title and two FA Cup trophies, as well as played in the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League final. In 2009, he won the Premier League Golden Boot award as the league&#x27;s top goalscorer. During his transfers over the years, he has built an aggregate transfer cost of just under £90 million. After leaving Chelsea, he had brief stints at Shanghai Shenhua, Juventus, West Bromwich Albion and Mumbai City.

Anelka played 69 times at international level and won his first international honours with France at UEFA Euro 2000, also winning the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup the following year. His failure to settle at club level limited his international appearances, but he returned to the national team for Euro 2008. On 19 June 2010, he was excluded by the French Football Federation (FFF) from the 2010 World Cup in South Africa for &quot;comments directed against the national coach, Raymond Domenech.&quot; He did not play again for the national team.

==Early and personal life==
Anelka was born in Le Chesnay, Yvelines, to parents who had moved from Martinique in 1974. Thereafter, they settled in Trappes, near Paris. His childhood friends from Trappes include the actors Omar Sy and Jamel Debbouze. His mother is a secretary in the local high school.

Anelka is married to Barbara Tausia, a Belgian choreographer. Together, they have two sons, Kais, born in 2008, and Kahil, born in 2010. He acted in the 2002 film &quot;Le Boulet&quot; as a footballer named Nicolas. He has said that when he retires from football, he would like to work in the film industry because he has a friend in the business. He said, &quot;I have a friend who&#x27;s a producer, who makes lots of films. He recently did &quot;Astérix&quot;. So it&#x27;s already agreed that I&#x27;m going to do other films. It helps to know actors and producers. It&#x27;s different to football and it&#x27;s something I enjoy very much because there&#x27;s no ball. I like pretending to be somebody else, it&#x27;s fun.&quot;

Anelka has two brothers, Claude and Didier.

After discussing religion with some childhood friends, Anelka converted to Islam in 2004 in the United Arab Emirates, taking the Muslim name of &quot;Abdul-Salam Bilal&quot;. Anelka has said that he initially fasted during daylight hours as is required for the Muslim month of Ramadan, but &quot;I realised I often got injured just after the period of Ramadan, so I don&#x27;t observe it strictly any more&quot;. Initially, Anelka considered leaving European football to play in the UAE: &quot;I am ready to stay here and to play for a club in the Emirates. I am not keen to go back to England or France.&quot; However, this did not come to pass and he briefly moved to Turkey instead, as well as three more English clubs.

Anelka is also known for his controversial relationship with French comedian Dieudonné M&#x27;bala M&#x27;bala and attracted widespread condemnation after performing the &quot;quenelle&quot; hand gesture, created by M&#x27;bala and regarded as anti-Semitic, on the pitch when playing for West Bromwich Albion in 2013. Anelka responded that the gesture was anti-establishment, not anti-Semitic. An FA disciplinary hearing nonetheless banned Anelka for five matches, but found that he was not anti-Semitic and had not intended the gesture to express or promote anti-Semitism. After West Brom suspended him pending their own investigation, Anelka was given notice of termination of his contract by the club due to the club and player being unable to come to terms over the conditions required for the suspension by the club to be lifted, as well as comments made by Anelka on Twitter. In 2020, Anelka said the &quot;quenelle&quot; was only a protest against his former manager Steve Clarke, who is not Jewish.

Anelka has been the subject of the 2012 Canal+ documentary &quot;L&#x27;Entrée des Trappistes&quot; about his friendship with Sy and Debbouze, and the feature-length 2020 Netflix documentary &quot;&quot;.

==Club career==
===Paris Saint-Germain===
Anelka began his career at Paris Saint-Germain as a youth player at age 16.

===Arsenal===
In February 1997, at age 17, Anelka joined Premier League club Arsenal for a £500,000 transfer fee under newly appointed manager Arsène Wenger. The transfer caused controversy in France as Arsenal sought to sign him for free under the precedent of the recent Bosman ruling, despite there being exceptions for players under the age of 24; Wenger said this age restriction was only for domestic transfers.

His first team opportunities were limited in the 1996–97 season, but in 1997–98, he broke into the first team after a long-term injury to striker Ian Wright. In November 1997, Anelka scored his first goal for Arsenal in a 3–2 home win against Manchester United. Anelka was a key player in Arsenal&#x27;s Double win of both the Premier League and FA Cup that season. Anelka scored the second goal in Arsenal&#x27;s 2–0 win over Newcastle United in that season&#x27;s FA Cup final.

Anelka was Arsenal&#x27;s top scorer in the 1998–99 season with 17 Premier League goals. This form saw him voted the PFA Young Player of the Year, but Arsenal failed to defend their Premier League and FA Cup titles and made little progress in the UEFA Champions League. Fans turned on the striker amid transfer speculation and a perceived lack of enthusiasm, giving him the nickname &quot;Le Sulk&quot;. During the close season, Anelka stated a desire to leave Arsenal, claiming the English press was responsible for his unhappiness in England. On 2 August 1999, he joined Real Madrid.

With regard to his time with &quot;the Gunners&quot;, Anelka later said he believes he should have never left Arsenal, a club that he has great &quot;love&quot; for. Of his former boss at Highbury, Arsène Wenger, Anelka is a huge admirer and a strong supporter of him. Anelka also placed at 29th in the club&#x27;s compilation of the 50 Greatest Gunners of all-time. In all, he made 90 appearances for Arsenal, scoring 28 goals altogether for the club.

===Real Madrid===
In the summer of 1999, Anelka moved to Real Madrid for a £22.3 million transfer fee. He took time to score for the club; on a visit to the football tabloid &quot;Marca&quot; he played a &quot;FIFA&quot; game with the staff, who then released the mocking front-page headline &quot;Anelka finally scores a goal...on a video game&quot;. He failed to score for Real Madrid in his first five months at the club, eventually recording his first goal in the opening match of the FIFA Club World Championship against Al-Nassr on 5 January 2000. Two days later, he scored twice against Corinthians in the same competition, also missing an 81st-minute penalty kick that would have given him a hat-trick.

On 28 February 2000, Anelka scored his first La Liga goal in a 3–0 defeat of rivals Barcelona in &quot;El Clásico&quot; at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. However, in March, he was suspended by club president Lorenzo Sanz after refusing to train, because of a disagreement with head coach Vicente del Bosque. After returning to the team, Anelka scored in both legs of the Champions League semi-final to give &quot;Los Blancos&quot; a 3–2 aggregate victory over Bayern Munich and advance to the competition final. He started in the final, held at the Stade de France in his home city of Paris, as Real Madrid ran out 3–0 winners over Valencia to win an eighth European Cup.

===Return to Paris Saint-Germain===
Anelka signed a six-year professional contract at Paris Saint-Germain in July 2000, a return to the club at which he used to play as a youth player, in a transfer deal worth £22 million. The Paris club had finished second in Ligue 1 that season, thereby qualifying for the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League. Anelka&#x27;s return was met with much fanfare. Canal Plus, which owned Paris Saint-Germain, financed the transfer, while PSG sponsor Nike covered much of Anelka&#x27;s compensation of £30–35,000 per week.

Anelka started well and was appointed captain of a team that was briefly at the top of 2000–01 French Division 1, but the team&#x27;s form quickly dropped. In December 2000, following a 5–1 loss to Sedan, Philippe Bergeroo was replaced as PSG manager by Luis Fernández. PSG finished ninth in Ligue 1 that season, earning a place in next season&#x27;s UEFA Intertoto Cup. PSG finished second in the first round of group stage, behind Bayern Munich, but finished bottom of the second group stage, behind Deportivo de La Coruña, Galatasaray and Milan.

However, once again, Anelka developed issues with his head coach, Luis Fernández (who was already under pressure for benching Ronaldinho due to his work ethic).

====Liverpool (loan)====
After two and a half years, Anelka returned to the Premier League in December 2001 to join Liverpool on a short-term loan deal until the end of the season. He contributed to Liverpool&#x27;s late push to come second in the 2001–02 FA Premier League, scoring goals against Everton,
Fulham, Blackburn Rovers, Ipswich Town, and in the 2001–02 FA Cup against Birmingham City, but manager Gérard Houllier opted not to offer him a permanent deal after the end of the season in favour of signing Senegalese forward El Hadji Diouf.

===Manchester City===
Anelka joined Manchester City on 24 May 2002, with the £13 million transfer fee paid by manager Kevin Keegan, then a club record high. In his first season at City, Anelka was the club&#x27;s top scorer with 14 goals, including a goal in the last ever Manchester Derby at Maine Road against Manchester United, against former club Arsenal and a last minute winner at Anfield after scoring a penalty just moments earlier. In his second season at City, he finished top scorer again, in the club&#x27;s first season at the City of Manchester Stadium, with 25 goals. On 16 October 2004, he won and scored a penalty against Chelsea, which led to José Mourinho&#x27;s first defeat as Chelsea manager.

===Fenerbahçe===
In January 2005, Manchester City announced Anelka had completed a £7 million transfer to Turkish team Fenerbahçe. He helped the Turkish club win the Süper Lig title in 2005, and played with them in the UEFA Cup that season, as well as the UEFA Champions League the season after.

===Bolton Wanderers===
On 25 August 2006, Bolton Wanderers signed Anelka on a four-year deal for a club record transfer fee of £8 million. He made his debut for Bolton against Watford on 9 September 2006. He opened his account on 19 September in a League Cup match against Walsall, scoring the last goal of a 3–1 away win. After 11 matches without a goal in the Premier League, he scored his first goals – a brace – on 25 November to help down Arsenal 3–1. He finished the 2006–07 Premier League season as Bolton&#x27;s top scorer with eleven goals.

In January 2007, Anelka stated he would be willing to leave Bolton for a return to former club Arsenal. However, he pledged his future to Bolton in July 2007 following talks with manager Sammy Lee. Anelka later said he would reluctantly consider leaving the club if Bolton&#x27;s poor start to the 2007–08 season continued, but later signed a new four-year contract lasting until 2011 on 30 August. In June 2020 Anelka admitted he signed the contract so that Bolton could get a bigger transfer fee when he left.

===Chelsea===
On 11 January 2008, it was confirmed Anelka would join Chelsea for £15 million. He made his Chelsea debut against Tottenham Hotspur on 12 January 2008, and scored his first goal two weeks later in the FA Cup against Wigan Athletic. He scored his first league goal on 2 February against Portsmouth, but failed to score again for Chelsea during the 2007–08 season.

In the 2008 Champions League final, Anelka delivered Chelsea&#x27;s seventh penalty which was saved by Edwin van der Sar, resulting in Manchester United winning the competition. Anelka later blamed manager Avram Grant for his penalty miss, claiming Grant brought him on to play as a late substitute without a proper warm up beforehand and also too late in the game to acclimatize himself in it.

On 3 August 2008, Anelka scored four goals in a 5–0 friendly win against Milan.

With Didier Drogba injured at the beginning of the 2008–09 season, Anelka made a very impressive start to the campaign. His goalscoring spree won him the Golden Boot Award on 14 November 2008 for being the first player that season to score ten Premier League goals. Anelka scored his first competitive hat-trick for Chelsea against Sunderland, in a 5–0 home win on 1 November 2008, and followed this up with two braces against Blackburn Rovers, then West Bromwich Albion. He established himself as an important member of the squad and maintained his place in the team despite the return to fitness of Drogba. After the arrival of Guus Hiddink, Anelka was more often played on the wing. Furthermore, he was ranked among the top goalscorers in the league for the season. He scored another hat-trick against Watford in the FA Cup to earn Chelsea a 3–1 victory at Vicarage Road. On 10 May, he scored one goal and set up another in a 4–1 away win against former club Arsenal. Anelka did not celebrate the goal which he scored in the game, as he disclosed &quot;he still loved Arsenal&quot;. A goal in Chelsea&#x27;s final Premier League game of the season at Sunderland put him as top goal scorer for the season in the Premier League, earning him the Golden Boot with 19 goals.

Anelka scored his first goal of the 2009–10 season against West London rivals Fulham in a 2–0 win at Craven Cottage, before continuing his fine form with the opening goal in Chelsea&#x27;s 3–0 win over Burnley the following weekend. He scored his third goal of the season in the opening match of the 2009–10 Champions League group stage in the 1–0 victory over Porto. Anelka scored one of the best goals of his season against APOEL in the Champions League with the ball being passed into the net from outside the box. Anelka scored his third league goal of the season against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in a 2–0 win with the second goal coming from compatriot Florent Malouda. Anelka continued his fine scoring run in the Champions League with the winner in the 1–0 victory over Porto at the Estádio do Dragão, making Chelsea only the second ever English side to win at Porto&#x27;s home ground. He continued his scoring in the season by scoring Chelsea&#x27;s first goal in a 3–3 draw against Everton in the Premier League, his first goal in the competition since October. He followed that up with another goal in Chelsea&#x27;s 2–1 victory over Portsmouth.

On 16 January 2010, on his return from injury, Anelka scored twice in an astonishing 7–2 victory over Sunderland. He continued this fine form into the next match scoring in an FA Cup tie against Preston North End, bringing his tally in the previous four matches to five goals. After the return of Didier Drogba from the African Cup of Nations, Anelka had been playing on the wing to support him. Anelka scored his first goal since January in a 1–0 win over his former club Bolton in April 2010, putting Chelsea four points ahead of second-place Manchester United. On the final day of the season, Anelka scored two goals against Wigan Athletic, including the first Chelsea goal in the sixth minute, to help Chelsea win their third Premier League title and their first in four years. Anelka (along with Ashley Cole) joined Henning Berg in the exclusive band of players who have won the Premier League title with two different clubs. On 24 June 2010, Chelsea announced Anelka had signed a new one-year extension to his existing contract that will keep him at the club until 2012.

Anelka started the 2010–11 campaign in fine form for Chelsea. He assisted Florent Malouda&#x27;s last goal against West Brom on the opening day of the Premier League season, scored a double in the next game against Wigan Athletic, then won a penalty against Stoke City in Chelsea&#x27;s third game of the season. He continued this fine form in Chelsea&#x27;s first Champions League match, scoring a first half brace against MŠK Žilina. Further goals against Marseille and Spartak Moscow ensured this was the first season since playing for Paris Saint-Germain he had scored at least four goals in a Champions League season. On 19 October, during Chelsea&#x27;s Champions League group stage match against Spartak, Anelka continued his impressive goal scoring form in the Champions League, scoring the second goal of the match and his 50th goal for Chelsea in the 43rd minute of the game. He ended the 2010–11 season with 16 goals from 45 appearances in all competitions.

Anelka scored Chelsea&#x27;s first goal of the 2011–12 season against West Brom in a 2–1 Premier League victory. This would prove to be Anelka&#x27;s final goal for Chelsea, however, as he failed to find the net in 14 further appearances in 2011. On 3 December 2011, after Chelsea&#x27;s 3–0 victory against Newcastle United, manager André Villas-Boas confirmed to the media that Anelka, along with centre-back Alex, had submitted transfer requests to the club and would be free to leave Chelsea in January. On 12 December, Chelsea confirmed Anelka would join Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua. Zhu Jun, owner of Shanghai Shenhua, confirmed his club had sealed a deal with Anelka in his Weibo on 12 December 2011. This deal was later officially announced by both clubs and was finalized the same day.

In total, Anelka scored 59 goals for Chelsea in 184 appearances.

===Shanghai Shenhua===
On 1 January 2012, Anelka moved to Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua, with his annual salary reported to be around €12 million. Following his move, Anelka revealed he turned down the chance to join his former club PSG the previous month in favour of signing for Shanghai Shenhua, and explained that his move was because he did not have attractive offers to remain within Europe. On 21 February 2012, he scored his debut goal in a pre-season friendly match against Hunan Billows, just 40 seconds after the start of the match. Anelka failed to make his Chinese Super League (CSL) debut due to ankle injury on the opening league match of the season against Jiangsu Sainty. He eventually made his CSL debut and scored his first CSL goal on 16 March 2012, in a 3–2 away defeat against bitter rivals Beijing Guoan. On 11 April 2012, Anelka was named as part of the coaching staff to help struggling manager Jean Tigana.

On 19 June 2012, it was confirmed that Anelka&#x27;s former Chelsea teammate Didier Drogba would join Shanghai Shenhua. On 7 June 2012, it was claimed Anelka was keen on a move back to the Premier League after he was involved in a heated exchange with a fan for refusing to bow in front of the travelling Shenhua fans with his teammates. Anelka provided two assists for Drogba and headed in a late equaliser to earn Shenhua a point in a 3–3 draw with Shandong Luneng Taishan on 25 August.

====Juventus (loan)====
On 26 January 2013, Anelka joined Italian side Juventus on a five-month loan deal. He made his debut for Juventus against Celtic in the Champions League. Anelka made two further appearances for Juventus, both in Serie A, as the club won the league title.

===West Bromwich Albion===
On 4 July 2013, Anelka joined West Bromwich Albion on a free transfer after being released by Shanghai Shenhua, marking another return to the Premier League, the sixth Premier League club he has played for in his career. He said he would like to end his career in England, at West Brom. On 22 August 2013, Anelka reportedly walked out of a training session telling staff he was leaving the club to retire. The reports were quickly denied by the club, which confirmed Anelka would miss one match and that he had left the session early on compassionate grounds following the death of his agent. On 28 August 2013, it was announced that since completing his week of compassionate leave, Anelka had decided to remain with the club and would begin training the following day in preparation for West Brom&#x27;s forthcoming match against Swansea City. He subsequently returned full-time to the team.

Anelka scored his first goal for the club in a 3–3 draw with West Ham United on 28 December 2013, scoring a first-half brace in his first appearance in over two months. During his goal celebration he performed a &quot;quenelle&quot;, a hand gesture popularized by his comedian friend Dieudonné, described by some critics as an inverted Nazi salute. The Football Association (FA) and anti-racism organisations investigated the incident following allegations of anti-Semitism. On 27 February 2014, an FA disciplinary hearing banned Anelka for five matches, fined him £80,000 and ordered him to complete an educational course. In the hearing, the FA disciplinary hearing panel concluded, &quot;[W]e did not find that Nicolas Anelka is an anti-Semite or that he intended to express or promote anti-Semitism by his use of the &quot;quenelle&quot;.&quot; Anelka and the FA both decided not to appeal this verdict. In the 2020 documentary &quot;Anelka: Misunderstood&quot;, Anelka said that the &quot;quenelle&quot; was only a protest at former West Brom manager Steve Clarke, who is not Jewish.

Anelka used social media to announce he was terminating his contract with West Brom. West Brom responded that Anelka had given the club no official notification of his intention to leave, and later gave him 14 days notice of termination from the club for gross misconduct.

===Mumbai City FC ===
On 15 September 2014, Anelka joined Mumbai City of the newly formed Indian Super League. Following a three-match global ban, he made his debut on 28 October 2014 in a 5–1 defeat at Chennaiyin FC. Five days later, in his first home match at the DY Patil Stadium, Anelka scored the match&#x27;s only goal to defeat Kerala Blasters. On 5 November, he scored his only other goal of the season, for a home game of the same outcome against the Delhi Dynamos. Anelka played a total of seven matches for Mumbai, as they finished seventh and did not qualify for the end-of-season play-offs.

In January 2015, Anelka had agreed a deal to join Algerian side NA Hussein Dey on an 18-month contract. However, the move was blocked by the Algerian Football Federation as, &quot;Only those aged under 27 and playing on the international level for their countries are allowed to sign up with our clubs.&quot; Anelka subsequently returned to Mumbai and was named the team&#x27;s player-manager on 3 July 2015.

==International career==
At youth level, Anelka played for the French under-20 team at the 1997 World Youth Championship, and made his senior team debut for France in a goalless draw with Sweden national team on 22 April 1998. Anelka was not selected for the 1998 FIFA World Cup-winning squad, but quickly became France&#x27;s first choice centre forward during the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying campaign, scoring the opening goal in France&#x27;s 3–2 win over Russia on his first international start and scoring both goals in a comfortable 2–0 win over England at Wembley Stadium in February 1999. Anelka made his first appearance in a major tournament at Euro 2000, which France went on to win. He also formed part of the squad which won the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup, where he scored his only tournament goal in a 5–0 win over hosts South Korea in the opening game. In November 2002, he rejected an emergency call-up by Jacques Santini to face Serbia and Montenegro and was barred by the manager; in February 2004 he eyed a return for the UEFA Euro 2004 squad as Djibril Cissé was suspended.

In November 2005, now under, Raymond Domenech, Anelka returned to the France squad for a friendly against Costa Rica in Martinique. The match in the homeland of Anelka&#x27;s parents was the team&#x27;s first in the French Caribbean. He scored in the 3–2 win. When Cissé was forced out of 2006 World Cup due to injury, Lyon striker Sidney Govou was called up as Cissé&#x27;s replacement rather than Anelka.

Anelka came on as a substitute in the Euro 2008 qualifier against Lithuania on 24 March 2007, and scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory. Following his performance, Anelka was praised by France manager Raymond Domenech: &quot;It is the Nicolas I like to see... when he shows these qualities, he is a candidate for a permanent place.&quot; He also scored in the 2–0 victory against Ukraine on 2 June 2007.

Anelka featured in the France squad for Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland. Anelka started France&#x27;s first group game against Romania, but was substituted after 72 minutes. He did not start either of France&#x27;s remaining two games in the tournament against the Netherlands and Italy, coming on as a substitute in both games.

Anelka played a key role in France&#x27;s 2010 World Cup playoff against the Republic of Ireland. He scored the winning goal in the 72nd minute that put France in a good position with one away goal.

During the 2010 World Cup, Anelka was sent home after reportedly abusing coach Raymond Domenech at half-time during the 2–0 defeat to Mexico. Following criticism of his positioning by Domenech, Anelka is reported to have said, &quot;,&quot; meaning, &quot;Go fuck yourself, you dirty son of a whore.&quot; The incident was later reported by the media, and the player refused to publicly apologise when asked to do so by French Football Federation (FFF) president Jean-Pierre Escalettes. The next day, the squad refused to go to training in protest against Anelka&#x27;s expulsion. Anelka was subsequently given an 18-game suspension from international football by the FFF as punishment for his actions, effectively ending his international career. Anelka later claimed to be &quot;dying with laughter&quot; at the 18-match ban, as he had already decided to retire from international play.

Anelka took &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; to court for their front page, demanding €150,000 in compensation. He lost the case as he only denied the wording of the insult that was attributed to him, and not the fact that he made an insult. In a 2018 documentary, Domenech said that Anelka only insulted his management, not him as a person or his mother.

==Retirement==
After retiring as a player, Anelka joined the technical staff of Dutch Eredivisie side Roda JC in February 2017, claiming he wanted to help his friend and the club&#x27;s shareholder Aleksey Korotaev. In November 2018, he joined Lille as a youth forwards coach. On 3 February 2021 he became the sporting director of Hyères, under the new ownership of Mourad Boudjellal. He departed three months later, on 4 May, with no first team game taking place during his tenure due to the COVID-19 pandemic in France. On 25 January 2024, Anelka was appointed as president of TFF First League club Ümraniyespor. Less than six months later, on 8 July, Anelka resigned from his position at the club.

Bennett received the Distinguished Service Cross as well as two Purple Hearts for his service. He was born in Lakeside, Ohio and retired to Asheville, North Carolina. He entered military service from Ohio.

On 6 June 1944, Lieutenant Colonel Bennett, along with the 62nd Armored Field Artillery Battalion which he commanded, landed with the second wave at 0720 on D-Day. His party was subjected to a tremendous volume of machine gun fire which inflicted 50 percent casualties before they reached the comparative safety of the shingle at the base of the cliff adjoining the beach. Observing that following units were pinned down on the beach, he immediately left his cover and moved about the beach under heavy fire in order to assemble and reorganize the infantry assault companies, four tanks, and an antiaircraft unit.

By redistributing the remaining officers and equipment; by emplacing the .50 caliber machine guns of the antiaircraft unit so as to give close support to the infantry; and by radioing for tank and artillery fire support from the LCTs, he organized a sizable force and, at about 1000 hours, successfully assaulted the ridge. He then continued moving about the beach under intense fire and succeeded in locating a protected place to bring his battalion and move it across the beach. Lieutenant Colonel Bennett, in disregarding his own safety under such heavy enemy fire throughout the day and in his clear thinking, contributed immeasurably to the establishment of the beachhead.

General Bennett recounts his World War II experience in his memoir, &quot;Honor Untarnished&quot;, published by Tom Doherty Associates, LLC in 2003. He graduated from the Command and General Staff College in 1951 and the Army War College in 1955. General Bennett also served as superintendent of the United States Military Academy from 1966 to 1969. He was Commander of VII US Corps from June 1968 until September 1969, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency from September 1969 until August 1972 and Commander of U.S. Forces Korea from September 1972 until July 1973. He retired in 1974 as commanding general of the U.S. Army Pacific Command.

Bennett died on November 28, 2005, at the age of 90 and was buried at the United States Military Academy Cemetery in West Point, New York.

Gen. Bennett was inducted into the inaugural class of the Phi Kappa Tau Hall of Fame at the fraternity&#x27;s centennial convention in 2006.

<text>Loftus Road, currently known as MATRADE Loftus Road Stadium for sponsorship reasons, is a football stadium in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, London, England, which is home to Queens Park Rangers Football Club, with a capacity of 18,439.

In 1981, it became the first stadium in British professional football to have an artificial pitch of Omniturf installed. This remained in use until 1988, after which a natural grass pitch was reintroduced.

Rugby union team London Wasps shared the ground with QPR between 1996 and 2002 and Premier League football club Fulham shared it from 2002 to 2004 while Craven Cottage was closed for reconstruction. AFC Wimbledon started the 2020–2021 season sharing the ground while they waited for their new stadium in Merton to be finished. Other users of the stadium have included the Jamaican and Australian national football teams. In 1985, Barry McGuigan defeated Eusebio Pedroza for the World Boxing Association featherweight championship at the stadium.

On 7 June 2019, the club gifted the naming rights to the stadium to The Kiyan Prince Foundation, a charity set up in honour of former QPR youth player Kiyan Prince, resulting in the stadium becoming known as the Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium. On 25 May 2022, the club announced that the stadium name would revert to Loftus Road ahead of the 2022–23 season.

On 26 October 2023, the club announced that it had signed a three-year agreement to sell the naming rights of the stadium to MATRADE; thus Loftus Road will be known as the &quot;MATRADE Loftus Road Stadium&quot; until the 2025–26 season.

==History==
The ground was first used on 11 October 1904 by Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, an amateur side that was disbanded during the First World War. QPR moved to Loftus Road in 1917, having had their ground at Park Royal commandeered by the army in February 1915. At that time the ground was an open field with a pavilion. One stand from Park Royal was dismantled and re-erected in 1919, forming the Ellerslie Road stand. This stand was the only covered seating in the ground until 1968 and was replaced in 1972. It had a capacity of 2,950.

QPR moved out of Loftus Road at the start of the 1931–32 season, moving to nearby White City Stadium, but after a loss of £7,000, the team moved back for the start of the 1933–34 season. In 1938, a new covered terrace for 6,000 spectators was constructed by a company called Framed Structures Ltd at the Loftus Road end, taking the overall ground capacity up to 30,000. It cost £7,000 (with £1,500 donated by the QPR Supporters Club) and was opened by Herbert Morrison, the leading Labour MP and future wartime Home Secretary, at the match against Crystal Palace on 29 October. The covered section of the terracing was concreted at that time; the uncovered section was concreted in 1945.

In April 1948, after winning the Third Division (South) championship, the club bought the freehold of the stadium plus 39 houses in Loftus Road and Ellerslie Road for £26,250, financed by a share flotation that raised £30,000. When the club&#x27;s finances were under pressure in the late 1950s the houses had to be sold. On 5 October 1953 floodlights were used at Loftus Road for the first time for a friendly game against Arsenal. In summer 1966 the original floodlights were replaced by much taller floodlight pylons. In summer 1980 these in turn were replaced with new floodlights.

QPR experimented once again with a move to White City Stadium in the 1962–63 season, but moved back to Loftus Road once more after less than one full season. In the summer of 1968 the South Africa Road stand was constructed at a cost of £150,000 to replace the old open terracing. In 1972 a new stand was completed in Ellerslie Road, replacing the tin-roofed grandstand erected in 1919, and first used in the match against Oxford United on 2 December 1972. The changing rooms and offices were moved to South Africa Road and the television gantry moved in the other direction.

The stadium&#x27;s highest recorded attendance of 35,353 was in a game against Leeds United on 27 April 1974. The following summer the paddock of the South Africa Road stand was converted from terracing to seating with the installation of 4,600 seats, thus lowering the capacity of the stadium to the 31,002 present for the last home match of the 1975/6 season against Leeds United on 24 April 1976.

During the summer of 1981 an artificial pitch of Omniturf was installed at Loftus Road, the first such surface to be used in British professional football. The surface was not favoured by everyone, with QPR keeper Peter Hucker describing it as &quot;basically a bit of carpet over two feet of concrete&quot;, and stated that as a goalkeeper, he strongly disliked diving onto it saying that &quot;I&#x27;d have close to third degree burns because the pitch would totally rip the skin off.&quot; Rangers lost the first league match played on the new surface 1-2 versus Luton Town on 1 September 1981. During the time that Loftus Road had the Omniturf pitch installed, QPR reached two cup finals and became Second Division champions, something that critics claimed was caused by the advantage the pitch presented, and QPR&#x27;s home games in the 1984–85 UEFA Cup were played at Arsenal&#x27;s Highbury Stadium. It was claimed that manager Terry Venables would let opposition teams train on the pitch when it was dry, and then deliberately dampen the pitch so that the ball played differently to what they expected at kick off. It was removed in April 1988 because of football legislation and replaced with grass. There were just three other league stadiums in the whole country with a plastic pitch, and by 1994 all of these had been ripped up.

New stands were opened at the School End in the summer of 1980 and one year later at the Loftus Road end. At the same time as the new Loftus Road stand was built executive boxes were installed in the lower tier of the South Africa Road stand and the artificial pitch laid. The stadium capacity at this time was 27,000 and it was one of the most modern and advanced stadiums in Britain having been completely reconstructed over a 13-year period from 1968 to 1981. Between the summer of 1994 and the start of 2022–23 season; Loftus Road ground was an all-seater stadium with the construction of seating in the lower Loftus Road stand. The last match where home spectators were able to watch the match from terracing was on 16 April 1994 against Everton. Standing returned to Loftus Road in 2022 when the club introduced rail seating in the ML, NL &amp; PL blocks in the Lower Loft and the R Block in the Stanley Bowles Stand.

The owning company, also called Loftus Road, of QPR, London Wasps and the stadium itself, went into the red in the late 1990s only a couple of seasons after it was formed in 1996. In 2001, there were concerns that Queens Park Rangers and the stadium would need to be sold separately when the club went into administration. There was interest from commercial buyers and housing developers. A supporter&#x27;s trust was set up to keep the club at Loftus Road, and to fight the suggested move out of the stadium and to Milton Keynes. One further suggestion was a merger between QPR and fellow London club Wimbledon, with the newly merged club playing at Loftus Road, but this idea was abandoned following the response from supporters. A £1 million payment by QPR&#x27;s long time local rivals Fulham in 2002 helped to alleviate the financial problems in return for a ground sharing agreement while Craven Cottage was developed.

Loftus Road briefly became home to non-league football club Yeading as they faced Premiership club Newcastle United in the third round of the 2005 FA Cup. The decision was made as Yeading felt that their home stadium could not suitably segregate the fans. Despite holding out for fifty minutes, Yeading went on to lose the match, 2–0.

In a fundraiser for the Grenfell Tower fire, which happened on 14 June 2017, Loftus Road stadium hosted a special match – appropriately named &#x27;Game 4 Grenfell&#x27; – for the people who died. Celebrities participating included Olly Murs, Sir Mo Farah and many more. This took place on 2 September 2017.

On 7 June 2019, following nominations and a fan vote from a shortlist, it was announced that Loftus Road Stadium would be renamed the &#x27;Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium&#x27; in honour of the former QPR youth team member Kiyan Prince who was fatally stabbed in 2006.

In December 2021, it was announced that the Ellerslie Road Stand would be renamed the Stanley Bowles Stand. In February 2022 the club announced a fundraising campaign, asking supporters to pay for the planned renaming costs.

Ahead of the 2022–23 season, the club installed just under 1000 rail seats in the ML, NL &amp; PL blocks in the Lower Loft and the R Block in the Stanley Bowles Stand and the upper tier of the School End stand used by visiting supporters.

In the summer of 2023 the old &quot;Blue and White Club&quot; bar in the Lower Loftus Road stand was renamed the &quot;Forever Rs bar&quot;, after the former players, managers and coaches association that had been created in 2016. The bar contains memorabilia donated by both fans and the club and is used to host talks with former players and other fan related events. It also lists all of the more than 100 former players, managers and coaches inducted to &quot;Forever Rs&quot; since its creation.

===The future===
Following a number of years of uncertainty about whether the club would expand the capacity of the stadium, or relocate to a new site in the event of a return to the Premier League, chairman Tony Fernandes announced, on 28 November 2011, that the club was investigating the possibility of relocating to a new site in West London in order to build a larger stadium. The current capacity of the stadium is 18,439.

It was not the first time that an owner had suggested moving out of Loftus Road, with director Antonio Caliendo suggesting, in March 2006, a potential site for a new shopping and leisure development near the BBC Television Centre, and then QPR manager, Luigi De Canio, suggesting in 2008 that the team needed to leave the stadium in order to fulfil its ambitions.

In August 2013, QPR started discussions with Hammersmith and Fulham Council about moving into a new stadium, believed to be at Old Oak Common, and soon after, in December, confirmed that they would be leaving Loftus Road for the short move across west London. However, in July 2014, those plans suffered a setback, with the current tenants at Old Oak – Car Giant – suggesting the club&#x27;s plans were &quot;speculative and presumptuous&quot;. The new stadium was planned to be called New Queens Park.

===Naming history===
*1904–2019: Loftus Road Stadium
*2019–2022: Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium
*2022–2023: Loftus Road Stadium
*2023–present: MATRADE Loftus Road Stadium

==Structures and facilities==
The stadium has a capacity of 18,439. The four stands are the Loftus Road End (often shortened to The Loft), The Stanley Bowles Stand, Bhatia Stand and the Achilleus Security Stand, the Upper Tier of which is used by away supporters with the lower tier also allocated when demand justifies it.

Because of the size of the stadium, supporters find themselves much closer to the pitch compared to many other stadiums. All four of the modern stands meet with no gaps, giving the overall impression of a tightly enclosed stadium. All the stands have two tiers, with the exception of the Stanley Bowles Stand.

The Bhatia stand, formerly known as the South Africa Road stand, is the biggest of the four stands. It is a two tier stand which includes The Paddocks and contains a row of executive boxes separating The Paddocks and the upper tier. It also houses the dugouts, changing rooms, executive suites, tunnel, club offices, club shop, box office and press conference rooms. The Paddocks area is the cheapest in the ground, whereas the upper tier is the most expensive. The exclusive W12 and C Clubs are located here.

The Loft is a two tier stand built in 1981 behind the goal and is traditionally where most members and season ticket holders sit. The lower tier became a Family Stand in the summer of 2012. This is the third most expensive stand to sit in. QPR generally opt to attack this end in the second half because it is believed to be good luck. The police crowd observation box is located in this stand and it is home to the members&#x27; bar in the ground, The Blue and White Bar. A new colour scoreboard is located at this end, installed in Summer 2008, on the advertising boards between the upper and lower tiers. As of August 2022 The Lower Loft contains 726 rail seats used for safe standing in Blocks ML, NL and PL.

The Stanley Bowles Stand, formerly known as the Ellerslie Road stand, was rebuilt in 1972. It is a single tiered stand and is the smallest in height, but not in noise and capacity. It is home to the &quot;Q Block&quot; where, along with the Loft&#x27;s P and R blocks QPR&#x27;s loudest and most partisan following are located. The R Block contains 237 rail seats so the rowdiest fans can stand during the game. This stand is a favourite of some fans because of the view and atmosphere, and is the second most expensive stand in the stadium. It is also home to the commentary and television camera gantry, and is the only stand whose seat colours are not arranged in blue and white hoops, spelling out &quot;QPR&quot; instead and chants of “captain jack” can be heard echoing around the stadium

At the west end of the stadium is the Achilles Security Stand. The upper tier holds around 1850 seats which are allocated to away fans. with the lower tier now only occupied by home fans for league games, with the exception of cup matches, with the away fans being allocated both the upper and lower tiers.

==Other uses==
Loftus Road was home to professional rugby union team London Wasps from September 1996 to the end of the 2001–02 season, having moved from their home in Sudbury, Middlesex, as part of the deal in which Chris Wright took control of both Wasps and QPR. Wasps won the English Premiership in their first season at Loftus Road. It was part of a 7-year ground share deal negotiated by Chris Wright who had just bought Wasps as rugby union became professional. Wasps agreed to move out, to Wycombe Wanderers&#x27; Adams Park ground, at the end of the 2001–02 season to allow Fulham F.C. to rent for 2 seasons between 2002 and 2004, while their ground, Craven Cottage, was redeveloped. It was Fulham&#x27;s preferred temporary ground, with the other suggested alternative being West Ham&#x27;s Upton Park. It was open for Wasps to return, but Wasps decided not to move back after Fulham left. It has also been used to host the final of the British Universities and Colleges Sport football tournaments.

The venue has also been used to host boxing in the past, with the most notable bout being between Irishman Barry McGuigan and Panamanian Eusebio Pedroza on 8 June 1985 for the WBA featherweight championship in front of a sold out capacity of 27,000 spectators. The stadium was transformed into a little bit of Ireland for the evening, with the &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot; on sale, and man dressed as a leprechaun dancing around the ring before the main event. McGuigan knocked the Panamanian down in the 7th round en route to a unanimous decision win: Pedroza was making the nineteenth defense of his title, and Ireland had not had a boxing world champion for 35 years. The band Yes performed at the stadium on 10 May 1975, which was recorded and featured on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;.

===Internationals===
Loftus Road hosted two England B internationals. The first was against France B in 1992 with the hosts winning, 2–0, and the other was against Russia-2 in 1998 and won, 4–1.

It was the first &#x27;neutral&#x27; venue to capitalise on hosting international friendlies not involving England.

A testimonial match for Simon Barker saw QPR lose to the Jamaica national team by 2–1 in March 1998, with the national team returning to Loftus Road in 2002 to play Nigeria where they lost, 1–0. Israel requested to play their Euro 2004 qualifying match against Cyprus as UEFA had banned Israel from hosting home games on its own territory due to security concerns. The application was rejected as there were already five scheduled matches over the course of thirteen days as it was during the time that QPR were sharing Loftus Road with Fulham. QPR themselves played the Iranian national team in a pre-season friendly on 23 July 2005. On 14 November 2006, Australia drew 1–1 with Ghana in an international friendly at the ground. In 2007 Denmark won, 3–1, against Australia at Loftus Road. In 2008, Australia played another friendly at Loftus Road against South Africa, the match ended 2–2. South Korea won, 2–0, against Ivory Coast at Loftus Road on 3 March 2010.

Loftus Road hosted the 2015 Saudi Super Cup between Al Nassr and Al Hilal, marking the first time that the competition was held outside of Saudi Arabia.

The stadium hosted two rugby league internationals. The first was a 2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations match between Australia and New Zealand on Saturday 23 October 2004 with Australia winning, 32–16. The other was a 2005 Rugby League Tri-Nations match between Great Britain and New Zealand on 29 October 2005 with New Zealand winning, 42–26.

====List of international football matches====

==Transport==
There are several London Underground stations near the stadium, the closest being White City, which is on the Central line, about five minutes walk away from the stadium. A further two minutes walk away is Wood Lane on the Hammersmith &amp; City line. Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market is also on the Hammersmith &amp; City line. Other nearby stations include those at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush on the Central line, and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush which operates trains on the London Overground and Southern networks. The Underground stations have on rare occasions been a means for Away teams to arrive, e.g. Coventry City&#x27;s players arrived via the tube station in 2008 after their coach got stuck in traffic.

A number of London Bus routes run near the stadium. From South Africa Road to the north, the 228 runs in both directions, terminating at Maida Hill and Central Middlesex Hospital. On the same road, the 283 runs through to East Acton, and although it does not stop when running in the other direction on South Africa Road, it does stop on the adjacent Bloemfontein Road. Other buses nearby are the 260, 207 and SL8, each of which run down the Uxbridge Road.

<text>Patrick McDonagh (born ) is the founder and owner of Supermac&#x27;s, an Irish fast food franchiser. Originally working as a school teacher, he later became a multi-millionaire.

== Personal life ==

McDonagh is a native of County Galway, where he lives with his wife Una. He was educated at Carmelite College, Moate, County Westmeath, and Mary Immaculate College, Limerick. Trained as a teacher, he worked for a time as a teacher (and later principal) in a national school near Loughrea, County Galway.

He earned the nickname &quot;Supermac&quot; whilst playing Gaelic football for the Carmelite College in Moate. This then became the choice of name for his business, &quot;Supermac&#x27;s&quot;. McDonagh has an interest in sport, and his company has sponsored several sports teams, including sponsoring Galway&#x27;s football and hurling teams for several decades.

== Business ventures ==

McDonagh founded Supermac&#x27;s in Ballinasloe, County Galway, Ireland in 1978 after failing to get planning permission to build a pool hall. He expanded the franchise to over 100 stores across Ireland.

He also owns other business ventures in the food and hospitality industry. Among these are the Claddagh Irish Pubs, an Irish pub-themed chain in the United States, founded in 2001. In 2006 McDonagh bought the franchise rights for Papa John&#x27;s Pizza in Ireland. As of 2019, there were over 63 Papa John&#x27;s Pizza outlets throughout the country. In 2014, he established SuperSubs salad and sandwich bars which operate from some Supermac&#x27;s outlets.

McDonagh&#x27;s other ventures include travel plazas across Ireland including the Barack Obama Plaza off the M7 at Moneygall, Tipperary Town Plaza (Limerick Road), Mallow N20 Plaza (Limerick Road), Ballyhea (Limerick Road), the Galway Plaza Junction 16 on the M6 and the Charlestown Service Station in County Mayo. He also owns the Killeshin Hotel, Portlaoise and the Charleville Park Hotel, Cork which he purchased after the development of the Loughrea Hotel &amp; Spa, Galway and the Castletroy Park Hotel, Limerick which were bought in 2014 and 2012 respectively. In 2018 he purchased the Athlone Springs hotel.

<text>O Vicedo is a municipality located on the extreme northern coast of Galicia, Spain, in the province of Lugo. It belongs to the comarca of A Mariña Occidental.

==Etymology==
&quot;O Vicedo&quot; seems to have its base in the Latin word &quot;vitiates&quot;. Therefore, it can be translated as &quot;the place where the &#x27;vice&#x27; abounds&quot;. &#x27;Vice&#x27; is an annual legume of the &quot;Papilionaceae&quot; subfamily that abounds in coastal zones all throughout Europe.

==Geography and environment==

===Location===
The municipality of O Vicedo is located in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. It is located in the comarca of A Mariña Occidental, north of the Autonomous Community of Galicia. It is bordered on the north by the Cantabrian Sea, to the south by the municipality of Ourol, to the east by Viveiro and to the west by Mañón. Its district covers an area of 75.96 km2.

===Orography===
The landscape of the O Vicedo municipality is characterized as generally hilly with strong contrasts. The municipality is crossed by two mountain cores that run from south to north. The mountain range of Couteiro, which begin in the municipality with Ourol in the civil parish of Cabanas, reaches its highest point on Mount Padro, close to Vivero border. The other main formation is that of Riobarba with a low altitude. This formation forms a series of mountains.

===Coast===
On the coast of the municipality of O Videdo there are a total of eight beaches. They have different dimensions and occupations according to their characteristics and the environment where they are located.

== Parishes ==
It is composed of the following &quot;parroquias&quot; or &quot;freguesias&quot; (parishes):

As Negradas, Cabanas, Mosende, San Román do Vale, Santo Estevo do Vale (O Vicedo), Riobarba, Suegos.

In the Middle Age the parishes that now compose all the municipality of O Vicedo belonged to different Lords, and were under their jurisdiction (As Negradas, Galdo, Viveiro, etc.).

With the Constitution of 1812 the first municipalities were created. The territory that now occupies the municipality of O Vicedo was divided into 3 municipalities: As Negradas, Val, and Cabanas.

A new municipal division was defined in 1835 when the present territory of the municipality was distributed to the following councils: Galdo (O Vicedo, Negradas and Vale) and Viveiro (Suegos, Mosende, Riobarba and Cabanas). This division lasted only 5 years and in 1840 the municipality of Riobarba appeared, reflected in the Government report on the Province of Lugo which defined the present parishes. In 1952 the Civil Governor of Lugo moved the municipality capital to O Vicedo.

== Government ==
O Vicedo achieved some national notoriety within Spain during the 1990s when a corruption scandal developed, involving the then mayor Isaac Prado Villapol and other councilors from the Partido Popular (PP).

<doc id="1053265" wikidata="Q6962909" url="?curid=1053265" title="Nancy Pearl">
<text>Nancy Pearl (born January 12, 1945) is an American librarian, best-selling author, literary critic and the former executive director of the Washington Center for the Book at Seattle Public Library. Her prolific reading and her knowledge of books and literature first made her locally famous in Seattle, Washington, where she regularly appears on public radio recommending books. She achieved broader fame with &quot;Book Lust,&quot; her 2003 guide to good reading. Pearl was named 2011 Librarian of the Year by &quot;Library Journal&quot;. She is also the author of a novel and a memoir.

==Life==
Nancy Pearl was raised in Detroit, Michigan and, by her own account, spent much time of her childhood at the public library. Her decision to become a librarian started at the age of 10 with the inspiration of the children&#x27;s librarian at her local public library. She credits books and librarians with helping her through a difficult childhood: &quot;It&#x27;s not too much of an exaggeration—if it&#x27;s one at all—to say that reading saved my life.&quot; She earned her master&#x27;s in library science at the University of Michigan (1967) and became a children&#x27;s librarian in her hometown library system before moving on to other libraries. As a hobby, Pearl wrote poetry as a young woman and in 1980 published a story in &quot;Redbook&quot; magazine called &quot;The Ride to School.&quot;

Pearl moved with her husband, professor Joe Pearl, from Detroit to Oklahoma, where she raised two daughters (Eily Raman and Katie) while earning another master&#x27;s degree, this one in history. She worked in an independent bookstore, Yorktown Alley, as well as the Tulsa City-County Library System. Craig Buthod, who worked with Pearl in Tulsa before he became the deputy director of the Seattle Public Library, recruited her to come to Seattle in 1993. She originally traveled to Seattle without her husband for four years, until he reached retirement age and joined her. Pearl said the decision to join the library was one of the few times in her life when she instinctively knew she was doing the right thing.

In Seattle, she became something of a local celebrity, founding the pioneering and much-imitated &quot;If All Seattle Read The Same Book&quot; project, encouraging every adult and every adolescent in the city to read the same book at the same time. The project, initially funded by a grant from the Lila Wallace-Reader&#x27;s Digest Fund, was subsequently adopted by a number of cities, including Chicago, Buffalo and Rochester. Pearl appeared regularly on KUOW public radio to review and recommend books. While there she first came up with her &quot;Rule of 50&quot; to read a book&#x27;s first 50 pages before deciding if you were interested enough to finish it or uninterested enough to quit. She later became the executive director of the library system&#x27;s Washington Center for the Book. She has also taught a readers&#x27; advisory course at the University of Washington Information School called &quot;Book Lust 101.&quot;

==Writing career==
Pearl achieved broader fame with &quot;Book Lust: Recommended Reading for Every Mood, Moment and Reason&quot; (2003), her readers&#x27; advisory guide to good reading. &quot;More Book Lust&quot; (2005), with the same subtitle, received much acclaim (&quot;a sprightly follow-up&quot;) and was chosen by the &quot;Today Show&quot; as one of its book-club selections. In March 2007, Pearl released a book of recommendations for children and teens titled &quot;Book Crush.&quot;

Pearl is also the author of the novel &quot;George &amp; Lizzie&quot; and &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Library,&quot; co-written with Jeff Schwager, which contains interviews with 23 American authors, including Pulitzer Prize-winners Michael Chabon, Jennifer Egan, Louise Erdrich, Richard Ford, Andrew Sean Greer, Viet Thanh Nguyen, and Donna Tartt.

==Editing career ==
In January 2012, Amazon.com announced that it would publish a number of out-of-print titles recommended by Pearl, in a venture called Book Lust Rediscoveries. Approximately six novels, originally published between 1960 and 2000, will be published each year in various print and electronic formats. For each title, Pearl will provide an introduction, book discussion points and suggestions for further reading.

&quot;Amazon just blew me, my agent – both of us – away with their enthusiasm for doing something so wonderful as resurrecting books that never should have gone out of print in the first place,&quot; Pearl said on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Morning Edition&quot;. Although 20 traditional publishers had turned down Pearl&#x27;s proposal for the rediscoveries, Amazon&#x27;s agreement to re-issue the titles set off an intense negative response.

&quot;I knew the minute I signed the contract that there would be people who would not be happy, but the vehemence surprised me,&quot; Pearl told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in February 2012. &quot;I understand and sympathize with the concerns about Amazon&#x27;s role in the world of books. If I had to do this deal all over again ... well, it&#x27;s a hard question. But I would still want these books back in print.&quot;

Others applauded Pearl for rescuing beloved, out of print books, including two by American novelist and short-story writer Elizabeth Savage who&#x27;d once written &quot;It is very dangerous to get caught without something to read&quot;—a favorite line of Pearl&#x27;s. Savage&#x27;s novels, &quot;The Last Night at the Ritz&quot; and &quot;The Girls from the Five Great Valleys&quot;, now appear under the Book Lust label.

==Criticism==

Nancy Pearl has faced criticism for her involvement in several controversies.

In 2003, the release of the &quot;Nancy Pearl Librarian Action Figure&quot; by Archie McPhee sparked debate within the library community. While some viewed the figure as a lighthearted tribute, others criticized it for perpetuating stereotypes of librarians, particularly with its &quot;shushing&quot; action, which some felt reinforced outdated perceptions of the profession.

In 2011, Pearl partnered with Amazon to launch the &quot;Book Lust Rediscoveries&quot; series, aiming to reissue out-of-print books. This collaboration drew criticism from independent booksellers and librarians who viewed Amazon as a threat to local bookstores and the publishing ecosystem. Critics questioned why Pearl, a prominent figure in the literary community, would align with a company perceived as undermining independent bookstores.

In 2022, during an American Library Association (ALA) Annual Conference panel titled &quot;Unite Against Book Bans,&quot; Pearl made comments suggesting that opposing book bans necessitates including books that may be offensive, even to librarians themselves. Her remarks were met with criticism, with some interpreting them as a defense of including materials like Holocaust denial literature in library collections. The ensuing debate highlighted tensions between intellectual freedom and the ethical responsibilities of librarians in curating collections.

==Recognition and awards==

Pearl has had her face on an American Library Association poster and has received numerous awards. Her book reviews appear in &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, &quot;Booklist&quot;, &quot;Library Journal&quot;, and on the radio on KUOW-FM Seattle, and KWGS Tulsa, Oklahoma.

In 2003 she received an unusual honor when the Seattle-based company Accoutrements created a librarian action figure in her likeness to be sold in their Seattle store, Archie McPhee. Featuring Pearl with a stack of books and a finger to her lips, the doll&#x27;s &quot;push to shush&quot; action was popular with some librarians and dismaying to others who felt that the doll reinforced librarian stereotypes. Pearl herself said that the shushing aspect of the action figure would determine &quot;which librarians have a sense of humor.&quot;

A tribute band called &#x27;The Nancy Pearls&#x27; gave their debut bluegrass performance on the Mitchell Library rooftop (Sydney, Australia) on December 17, 2004.

<doc id="1053268" wikidata="Q4537881" url="?curid=1053268" title="Allyn Abbott Young">
<text>Allyn Abbott Young (September 19, 1876 – March 7, 1929) was an American economist. He was born in Kenton, Ohio, into a middle-class family. Over his career, he served as president of the American Statistical Association in 1917 and the American Economic Association in 1925, making him one of the few individuals to lead both organizations. In 1929, Young was president of Section F (Economics) of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He died in London at the age of 52 from pneumonia during an influenza epidemic.

==Life==
As documented in a 1995 biography by Charles Blitch, Young was a brilliant student, graduating from Hiram College in 1892 at the age of sixteen, the youngest graduate on record. After a few years in the printing trade he enrolled in 1898 in the graduate school of the University of Wisconsin where he studied economics under Richard T. Ely and William A. Scott, history under Charles H. Haskins and Frederick Jackson Turner, and statistics under Edward D. Jones. In 1900 he was engaged for a year as an assistant in the United States Bureau of the Census in Washington, D.C., where he established lifelong friendships with Walter F. Willcox, Wesley C. Mitchell and Thomas S. Adams.

Young returned to the University of Wisconsin as instructor in Economics for the 1901–02 academic session and graduated there in 1902 with a doctoral dissertation on Age Statistics. He then embarked on what Blitch has called a peripatetic academic career, beginning with posts at Western Reserve University, 1902–04; Dartmouth, 1904–05; and Wisconsin, 1905–06. He was then head of the economics department at Stanford, 1906–10, followed by a year at Harvard as visitor, 1910–11, and two years at Washington University in St Louis, 1911–13. In 1914, he became one of the inaugural Fellows of the American Statistical Association. From 1913 to 1920 he was professor at Cornell University, but war took him to Washington D.C., in 1917 to direct the Bureau of Statistical Research for the War Trade Board, and to New York in 1918 to head the economics division of a group known as &quot;The Enquiry&quot; under Colonel Edward M. House, the group charged with laying the groundwork for the Paris Peace Conference.

After the war, Young moved to Harvard in 1920 where he stayed until 1927 when he accepted William Beveridge&#x27;s offer of the chair vacated by Edwin Cannan at the London School of Economics. He remained at the LSE for three years before returning to Harvard. In December 1928 he traveled to the University of Chicago to explain in person why he felt unable to accept their invitation to be chairman of their economics department. It was shortly after his return to London that he succumbed to the fateful influenza epidemic. He was 52 years old.

At the time of his death T. E. Gregory, a colleague at the LSE, wrote that Young had recently &quot;begun work on a systematic treatise on economic theory and had resumed the writing of the work upon monetary theory which he had begun at Harvard.&quot; He continued:

:A passion for thoroughness would drive him on to explore every inch of the field in which he was for the time interested: he was always convinced that economic truth was not the monopoly of a single school or way of thinking, and that the first duty of a teacher and thinker was to see the strong points in every presentation of a point of view. Such an attitude of mind, combined with great personal modesty, made for unsystematic writing: for scattered papers and articles and not for a comprehensive treatise. In many respects he resembled Edgeworth, for whose work he felt a growing admiration; and if Young&#x27;s work is ever collected, it will be seen that, like Edgeworth&#x27;s, it amounts in sum to a very considerable and impressive achievement.

In 1971, Nobel Laureate Bertil Ohlin, who attended a course of Young&#x27;s at Harvard in 1922–23, wrote to Young&#x27;s biographer:

:I am inclined to believe that he was a man, who knew and thoroughly understood his subject—economics—better than anyone else I have met. I tested him by means of a question about the &quot;Wicksell effect&quot;, i.e. the special aspects of the marginal productivity of capital, which at that time was practically unknown in most countries outside of Scandinavia. He immediately gave a fine account in a five minutes speech before the students. What characterizes Allyn Young as an economist was that he had deep understanding of all fields of economic theory while other economists knew well one third of the theory and had only superficial knowledge of the rest.

Much of his writing was published anonymously and posthumously in encyclopedias, but rescued from oblivion in a volume edited by Perry Mehrling and Roger Sandilands (1999). His best-known single paper was his presidential address to the British Association in September 1928 on &quot;Increasing returns and economic progress&quot;. Nicholas Kaldor insisted that this paper had been neglected because it was 50 years ahead of his time, but it has recently enjoyed a revival of interest as an acknowledged forerunner of modern &quot;endogenous growth theory&quot;.

Paul Samuelson named Young (along with Harry Gunnison Brown, Wesley Clair Mitchell, Henry Ludwell Moore, Frank Knight, Jacob Viner, and Henry Schultz) as one of the several &quot;American saints in economics&quot; born after 1860.

<doc id="1053281" wikidata="Q2560233" url="?curid=1053281" title="Shadow Raiders">
<text>Shadow Raiders is a Canadian animated television series produced by Mainframe Entertainment and syndicated by The Summit Media Group, that aired from September 16, 1998, to June 23, 1999. The show was loosely based on the Trendmasters toy line, &quot;War Planets&quot;. The original character designs were created by &quot;ReBoot&quot; designer, Brendan McCarthy. The series focused on the four warring planets of a solar system called the Cluster as they were forced to set aside their differences and form a coalition against the menace of the Beast Planet.

==Plot==
&quot;Shadow Raiders&quot; is set in a five-planet star system known as the Cluster. The four inhabited planets are in a constant state of war, always raiding one another for resources unique to each planet. However, when an alien named Tekla comes from another solar system, she brings a warning: the Beast Planet is coming. Now Graveheart, a humble miner of Planet Rock, must convince the leaders of Fire, Rock, Bone, and Ice to put aside their differences and stand together against the Beast, their new common enemy.

The story begins as Tekla&#x27;s homeworld of Planet Tek is consumed by the Beast Planet. She and her robotic companion, Voxx, escape to the Cluster through a Beast jump portal to warn them of the impending danger. Tekla is pursued by Beast drones and crash-lands on Planet Ice, where she is rescued by Graveheart. The drones subsequently attack and slaughter the combined forces of Rock and Ice in the area, leaving only Tekla, Graveheart, and Ice King Cryos. The threat convinces Cryos and Graveheart to form an alliance of the Cluster worlds against the Beast Planet.

The first season revolves around the efforts of Graveheart, who has become the de facto leader of the Alliance, to convince the leaders of the other Cluster worlds to join the Alliance. The first planet they visit is his home planet, Planet Rock, but Lord Mantel stubbornly refuses to ally himself with the other worlds after Rock&#x27;s Battle Moons repel a Beast attack. Graveheart&#x27;s friend and captain of the Royal Guard, Jade, joins him to help rally planets Fire and Bone to his cause. Fire and Bone join the Alliance.

The Beast forces are tracked to the dead world of Remora, converted into a fortress by the Beast drones. An attack by the combined forces of Ice, Fire, and Bone, with some timely intervention by Rock&#x27;s Battle Moons, sees the destruction of Remora. However, this only serves to anger the Beast Planet, which emerges from within the Cluster&#x27;s star and proves its superiority by destroying one of the Battle Moons with a single blast from halfway across the system. It then unleashes its wrath upon the nearest planet; Fire.

The second season focuses on the Alliance&#x27;s efforts to avoid the unstoppable Beast Planet. Each world in the Cluster is discovered to be equipped with &quot;World Engines&quot;, massive drive systems which can propel the planets through space. Using these, the worlds of the Cluster flee the Beast; Fire&#x27;s engine is damaged and the planet is thus sacrificed in a futile attempt to stop the Beast. Fire&#x27;s population is moved to the remaining Battle Moons, now down to three following the battle to save Fire. On their journey, they discover Planet Sand, which joins the Alliance, and Planet Jungle, which the Alliance blows up when the Beast tries to consume it; this, too, proves useless. The plants of Jungle live on as a single cutting which is given to Emperor Femur of Bone.

The finale introduces the Prison Planet, a teleport world used as a penal colony. Graveheart and Cryos are captured by a faction of convicts led by Jewelia, a devious woman who takes a liking to Graveheart. Femur and Jade are taken by a second faction commanded by Sternum, Femur&#x27;s nobler brother, from whom Femur stole the throne of Planet Bone. Convinced that their friends have been slain by the other faction, the two pairs join the fight on the side of their respective faction until the truth is revealed. Meanwhile, Lord Mantel takes control of the Alliance by force, convinced that his forces are superior to the Beast. His arrogance nearly dooms the Alliance and costs Mantel his life when Blokk invades Rock and kills him in single combat. As the Beast Planet is about to consume Planet Rock, the Prison Planet teleports into its path. Graveheart and his group use Sternum&#x27;s Telepod to travel to Rock. Sternum then teleports the Prison Planet out of the system, taking the Beast Planet with it. Alliance members mistakenly think that Beast Planet would have been destroyed during the teleportation. A final battle between Graveheart and Blokk results in Blokk&#x27;s demise, Jade&#x27;s rise to ruler of Planet Rock, and the Alliance&#x27;s new era of peace. However, the story ends with a scene in a distant part of the galaxy, moments before the destruction of Planet Reptizar at the hands of the Beast Planet.

Although the show ended after its second season, a proposed third would have answered major questions, like the origin of the Beast Planet.

==Setting==
The main setting of &quot;Shadow Raiders&quot; is the Cluster, a series of four interdependent worlds. The four main planets – Fire, Rock, Bone, and Ice – have warred for as long as any of them can remember over their natural resources: Fire produces energy, Rock produces metals and minerals, Bone produces food, and Ice produces water, and all four worlds depend on each other to survive.

A large part of the series mythology in the second season is the World Engines, a propulsion system built into the planets of the Cluster (and presumably many other worlds, since two different planets in different solar systems have them) by an ancient alien race. Using five mountain-sized energy thrusters which emerge from the planet&#x27;s surface, the World Engines can propel a planet through space at great speeds. A combination of an atmospheric shield and artificial gravity generators keep the sudden shift in orbit and lack of a star from killing everyone on the surface. The Prison Planet has a variation known as Teleport Engines, which teleport the world to different locations in space instantly. The same artificial gravity and atmospheric shielding technology is used to protect the inhabitants. Each set of engines is located at the core of its world and can be reached using Telepods, small platforms on the surface of each world. The Telepods send the user to the core of the planet where they can use the computer to move the planet. The Telepods can also be used to move people from one planet to another.

The World Engines are equipped with sensors capable of detecting – but not acting upon – threats to the planet. The AI is able to recommend a course of action, and does not appear to require clearance of any sort, responding to any voice commands given. The Telepod technology was reverse-engineered by Tekla to create a force field generator so anyone can physically fight a Null Matter being without disintegrating on contact.

==War Planets toy line==
The &quot;Shadow Raiders&quot; series was based on the War Planets toys from Trendmasters. Toys of Planets Ice, Fire, Bone, Rock, Sand, Tek, Water, Reptizar, Remora, the Beast Planet, several Battle Moons and Beast, Bone and Ice Tanks were created. The series is not strictly set around the toys since more worlds than just Rock have Battle Moons. Several toys were brought out that were based on the &quot;Shadow Raiders&quot; series but they were either figures of the main characters or ships.

==Episodes==
===Series overview===
===Season 1 (1998)===
===Season 2 (1999)===
==Cancellation==
The series had originally been planned to produce three seasons with 40 episodes in total. But despite favorable ratings of the season two&#x27;s initial broadcasting, the toy line sales were unacceptable in the program&#x27;s production country, prompting the series cancellation due to the program&#x27;s sole existence as the toy line&#x27;s promotion, eliminating any possibility of the third season&#x27;s production.

==Home releases==
The entire series was released on DVD by ADV Films in the year 2000. The series was spread over six volumes. Bonus features on the DVDs included data files on the characters, animation turnarounds, and a series trailer, featuring original animation not seen in the series. Much like fellow Mainframe Entertainment series ReBoot, the North American DVDs are long out of print and rare, though tend to fetch substantially less than other Mainframe DVDs.

Both complete seasons are available in two sets in the United Kingdom. Eight volumes were released in Germany (English + German audio) and six volumes were released in Russia, both also containing all 26 episodes.

<text>Gaius Licinius Macer (died 66BC) was a Roman annalist and politician.

==Life==
A member of the ancient plebeian clan Licinia, he was tribune in 73BC. Sallust mentions him agitating for the people&#x27;s rights. He became praetor in 68BC, but in 66BC Cicero succeeded in convicting him of bribery and extortion, upon which Macer committed suicide.

==Work==
Macer wrote a history of Rome, in 16 books. The work is now lost, but from Livy and Dionysius who both used it, we know that it began with the founding of the city, and that Pyrrhus appeared in Book II. Livy casts doubt on Macer&#x27;s reliability, suggesting that he misrepresented events in order to glorify the Licinii, but notes that he quotes original sources such as the Linen Rolls. According to Macrobius, he credited Romulus with the introduction of intercalation to the Roman calendar.

<doc id="1053288" wikidata="Q1321914" url="?curid=1053288" title="Tobu Railway">
<text>is a Japanese commuter railway and &quot;keiretsu&quot; holding company in the Greater Tokyo Area as well as an intercity and regional operator in the Kantō region. Excluding the Japan Railways Group companies, Tobu&#x27;s rail system is the second longest in Japan after Kintetsu. It serves large portions of Saitama Prefecture, Gunma Prefecture and Tochigi Prefecture, as well as northern Tokyo and western Chiba Prefecture. The Tobu Railway Company is listed in the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the Nikkei 225 index.

The Tobu corporate group is also engaged in road transportation (bus/taxi), real estate, and retail. It is the owner of the Tokyo Skytree, the third tallest tower in the world. The company is a member of the Fuyo Group &quot;keiretsu&quot;.

The name &quot;Tobu&quot; is formed from the kanji for east (&quot;東&quot;) and Musashi (&quot;武&quot;蔵), the initial area served.

==History==
Tobu is one of the oldest railway companies in Japan. It was established in November 1897 and began operation between Kita-Senju and Kuki in August 1899. The Tojo Railway was founded in 1911 as a separate company, but shared its president and head office with Tobu.

In 1905, Nezu Kaichirō became the president of Tobu Railway and successfully helped to grow the company to one of the largest private rail operators in the Kanto region.

In 1924, Tobu began operating its first electric train on the Isesaki Line between Asakusa (later Narihirabashi, today Tokyo Skytree Station) and Nishiarai.

Tobu was the first railway in the Kanto region to adopt quadruple tracks, on the Kita-Senju to Takenotsuka sector in 1974. The Tobu Dobutsu Koen (Tobu Animal Park) opened in 1981.

==Railway network==

Tobu has two isolated networks which are connected by the Chichibu Railway for ferrying of its rolling stock.

The Tobu Main Line network has a tree topology starting at in Tokyo, with the Isesaki Line as the trunk, and the Tobu Kameido Line, Daishi Line, Tobu Urban Park Line, Tobu Sano Line, Koizumi Line, Tōbu Kiryū Line, and Nikkō Line forming the branches, with further branches into the Tobu Utsunomiya Line and Tobu Kinugawa Lines. It offers surcharged, seat-reserved limited express services from Tokyo to Nikkō and Kinugawa.

The Tojo Line runs northwest from in Tokyo to central and western Saitama Prefecture. A branch, the Ogose Line, runs to from .

Tobu&#x27;s terminals in Tokyo are at (Main Line express services), (most other Main Line services) and (Tojo Line). The Skytree and Isesaki Lines interoperate with the Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line, Tokyo Metro Hanzomon Line and the Tokyu Den-en-toshi Line to serve central, southwestern Tokyo and Kanagawa Prefecture, while the Tojo Line interoperates with the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line, Tokyo Metro Yurakucho Line, Tokyu Toyoko Line and Minatomirai Line to serve central and southwest Tokyo and Kanagawa Prefecture.

<text>Bannerghatta National Park is a national park in India, located In Bengaluru and Ramanagara District, Karnataka. It was founded in 1970 and declared as a national park in 1974. In 2002, a small portion of the park became a zoological garden, the Bannerghatta Biological Park.

There are ancient temples in the park for worship and it is a destination for trekking and hiking. Within the national park area are six rural villages enclosed within three large enclosures for sheep and cattle farming. This park offers a wide range of diverse wildlife to the explorers. Coming from the finest of Bengaluru, Karnataka, this park offers a guided bus tour all along the 6 km safari roads, which is specially made for safaris and foreign tourist gatherers.

Between 1995 and 2021, the dry deciduous forests in the National Park shrunk approximately by 44% due to uncontrolled diversion of forest land for agricultural purpose, urbanisation, etc

== Geography ==
The 65,127.5 acre (260.51 km2) national park is located about 22 km south of Bangalore in the hills of the Anekal range with an elevation of 1245 - 1634m. The park has a hilly terrain of granite sheets under moist deciduous forest valleys and scrubland on higher areas. Sixteen villages border the park. Most of the national park consists of artificial forest, and some animals have been introduced. The park is part of a wildlife corridor for elephants which connects the BR Hills and the Sathyamangalam forest. The park is contiguous with Talli reserve forest in the southeast and Bilikal forest in the south.

=== Water sources ===
The park&#x27;s rainfall is 700 mm per year. The Suvarnamukhi stream runs through the national park. On 15 May 2014, four bore wells were opened to provide water in dry times.

===Flora===
Flora in the park include:

* &quot;Narcissus latifolia&quot;
* &quot;Schleichera oleosa&quot;
* &quot;Terminalia tomentosa&quot;
* Sandalwood
* Neem
* &quot;T. arjuna&quot;
* &quot;Grewia tilaefolia&quot;
* &quot;Santalum album&quot;
* Tamarind
* Bamboo
* &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;
* &quot;Bauhinia purpurea&quot;
* &quot;Samanea saman&quot;
* &quot;Peltphorum pterocarpum&quot;
===Fauna===

One hundred and one species of birds have been recorded in the park. The fauna pose some risk to humans. In August 2012, a man was trampled to death by an elephant. Occasionally, animals leave the reserve, coming into contact with humans. For example, elephants have been sighted on the Bantamweight-Anekal road which passes close to the park. In 2007, a leopard and her cubs entered a local school.

== Illegal mining around Bannerghatta national park ==
The park is threatened by multiple granite quarries operating around the national park. These quarries are located alarmingly close to critical elephant corridors inside the national park such as Kardikal - Madeswara corridor. While there is ban on mining and granite quarrying around the national park within a radius of One km from the boundary demarcated as &quot;Safe Zone&quot;, quarries operate unabatedly. Vehicular movement is also uncontrolled. Tremors from the explosives used in the quarry operations are felt across a radius of at least five km adversely affecting elephants and other wild animals.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Bannerghatta&quot;, a 2021 Malayalam language movie released on Amazon Prime, is based on the Bannerghatta National Park.

<doc id="1053290" wikidata="Q1849539" url="?curid=1053290" title="Time bomb">
<text>A time bomb (or a timebomb, time-bomb) is a bomb whose detonation is triggered by a timer. The use or attempted use of time bombs has been for various purposes including insurance fraud, terrorism, assassination, sabotage and warfare. They are a frequent plot device in thriller and action films as they offer a way of imparting a dramatic sense of urgency.

==Construction==

The explosive charge is the main component of any bomb, and makes up most of the size and weight of it. It is the damaging element of the bomb (along with any fragments or shrapnel the explosion might produce with its container or neighboring objects). The explosive charge is detonated by a detonator.

A time bomb&#x27;s timing mechanism may be professionally manufactured either separately or as part of the device, or it may be improvised from an ordinary household timer such as a wind-up alarm clock, wrist watch, digital kitchen timer, or notebook computer. The timer can be programmed to count up or count down (usually the latter; as the bomb detonates when the time runs out).

==Types==
Types of time bombs include:
* Delay-action bomb (bombs dropped by aircraft with a delay to increase damage/disruption)
* Improvised explosive device (&quot;home-made&quot; bombs with a delay to allow the person placing the bomb to escape)
* Limpet mine (attached to enemy ships by naval divers)

==List of notable incidents involving time bombs==

* Fuse (explosives)
* Ticking time bomb scenario (hypothetical justification of torture)
* Software time bomb

<doc id="1053291" wikidata="Q536393" url="?curid=1053291" title="Angelo Poffo">
<text>Angelo John Poffo (April 10, 1925 – March 4, 2010) was an American professional wrestler and wrestling promoter. He ran International Championship Wrestling for a number of years, holding cards in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Arkansas. He is the father of &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage and &quot;The Genius&quot; Lanny Poffo and the father-in-law of Miss Elizabeth.

==Early life, family and education==
Poffo was born in Downers Grove, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago), to Italian immigrants. At the time of beginning first grade, he spoke no English.

Poffo enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II. He served as a pharmacist&#x27;s mate at Naval Base San Diego. While in the Navy, Poffo began weight training. On July 4, 1945, he set a world record for sit-ups. He completed 6,033 sit-ups in four hours and ten minutes. According to his son Lanny, after 6,000 sit-ups he did 33 more, one for each year of Jesus&#x27;s life.

After leaving the Navy, Poffo attended DePaul University and was a catcher for the DePaul Blue Demons baseball team. He studied physical education and was a competitive chess player.

== Professional wrestling career ==
Poffo started wrestling in 1948 at Karl Pojello&#x27;s gym in Illinois. His first match was in 1949 against Ruffy Silverstein. He sometimes wrestled as &quot;the Masked Miser&quot; (an in-joke about Poffo&#x27;s real life extreme frugality with money) and managed other wrestlers as &quot;the Miser&quot;. He became a villainous character for the first time in 1950. In the mid-1950s, Bronco Lubich acted as his manager. He won the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (Chicago version) in 1958.

He formed a villainous tag team with Chris Markoff called &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Duo&quot; in 1966, and they were managed by Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan. Prior to that, in 1964 he briefly teamed with Nicoli Volkoff (often confused with Nikolai Volkoff, who did not begin wrestling in the US until 1970) and held the WWA tag team championship. In 1973, he formed the team &quot;The Graduates&quot; with Ken Dillinger.

Poffo wrestled in the 1970s and 1980s under a mask as the &quot;Carpet Bagger&quot; for Emile Dupree&#x27;s Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling in the Maritime Provinces of Canada. He also bought into the promotion, when his sons were old enough to join. He wrestled wearing a yellow mask with a dollar sign on the forehead and a blue sequined ring jacket with a big dollar sign on the back. In addition, Poffo ran International Championship Wrestling from 1979 to 1983 in Kentucky. From 1983 to 1985 he worked for Continental Wrestling Association.

According to Poffo&#x27;s son Lanny, Vince McMahon declined to include Poffo in a 1987 World Wrestling Federation event featuring legends. Lanny Poffo claims that this decision caused an early rift in the relationship between McMahon and Poffo&#x27;s other son, Randy Savage. His last match was in 1991 against Luis Martinez.

He made a few appearances in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1995 managing his son, Randy Savage. At Slamboree 1995, Poffo became involved in his son&#x27;s feud with Ric Flair, who put him in a figure four leglock. At the event, he was inducted into the WCW Hall of Fame as a member of the class of 1995.

==Personal life==
During Poffo&#x27;s time in college, he met another student at DePaul, Judith (Judy) nee Sverdlin from Naperville, Illinois; they wed on June 6, 1949. They were married for more than 60 years, and together they had two sons, Randy (1952–2011) and Lanny (1954–2023), both professional wrestlers. After retiring from professional wrestling, Poffo taught physical education in Illinois. His son Randy would support his parents, sending them on trips abroad until they were too old to travel. On Angelo&#x27;s 70th birthday in 1995, Randy paid $50,000 () to buy his father a yellow Cadillac automobile, the same car Poffo had purchased in 1959 and drove around the wrestling circuit for 200,000 miles. When Poffo was sick, Randy installed an invalid toilet and walk-in bathtub in his parents&#x27; home. He was also known for saving money to help provide his family.

On March 4, 2010, Poffo died in his sleep at age 84. His son Randy told the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot;, “I have always been proud to call Angelo Poffo my father, he is a great example of a self-sacrificing, hard-working man who always put his family first. He has always been my hero and my mentor, and the priceless gifts he gave I will have and cherish forever.”

Poffo is buried at Queen of Heaven Catholic Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois, near his hometown of Downers Grove.

<text>Kerry Group plc is a public food company headquartered in Ireland. It is quoted on the Dublin ISEQ and London stock exchanges.
Given the company&#x27;s origins in the co-operative movement, farmer-suppliers of the company retain a significant interest in the company.

== History ==
Kerry was founded in 1972 in Listowel, County Kerry as a private company (North Kerry Milk Products) with three shareholders – state-owned Dairy Disposal Company (42.5%), a federation of eight small farmer co-operatives in Kerry (42.5%) and Erie Casein Company Inc. from the US (15%).

In 1986, a significant milestone in the formation of the public limited company involved the Group acquiring the undertaking, property and assets of Kerry Co-operative Creameries and as a consideration 90 million ordinary shares in Kerry Group plc being issued to the Co-op. It floated on the Irish Stock Exchange at a price of 52p per share.

Kerry Group has a long history of acquisitions. In 1982, the company acquired pork manufacturer Duffy Meats and Henry Denny &amp; Sons. In 1988, it acquired Beatreme Food Ingredients, a division of the Beatrice Corporation for $130m. In 2000, it acquired Shade Foods Inc, a US sweet ingredients provider for US$80 million, Armor Foods, a savory flavorings company for US$35 million and Solnuts, a provider of value-added soy-based nutritional ingredients.

In March 2004, the company bought the Quest Food Ingredients Group, a food ingredients business, for US$440 million. Then in August 2005, the company acquired Noon Products, a supplier of Indian and Thai ready meals, for £124m.

In September 2012, the company acquired Cargill Flavor Systems, a manufacturer of food flavouring, for $230 million.

In February 2015, the company acquired Rollover, a supplier of hot dogs. Then in October 2015, the company acquired Red Arrow Products, Island Oasis and Wellmune, three businesses in the US taste and nutrition sector, for US$735 million.

In 2021, Kerry was on the list of Industry Outlook&#x27;s Top 10 Food Additive Manufacturers, in addition to being ranked second on the Top 20 Global Food Preservative Companies list by FoodTalks, a Chinese food media platform.

In June 2021, Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride agreed to buy Kerry Group&#x27;s consumer foods in the meat and meals business. In June 2021, Kerry Group also agreed to acquire Niacet for the value of €853 million.

In July 2021, the company acquired Biosearch Life, a biotechnology company focused on the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and functional food sectors.

In February 2022, Kerry Group announced two acquisitions: c-LEcta, a biotechnology company, and Enmex, a Mexican based enzyme manufacturer.

In April 2022, Kerry Group acquired Natreon, Inc, a US based supplier of branded Ayurvedic botanical ingredients.

In August 2022, Kerry Group acquired the B2B powdered cheese business and related assets of The Kraft Heinz Company for consideration of $107.5 million.

In January 2023, IRCA, Advent International’s portfolio company, agreed to buy Kerry Group’s Sweet Ingredients Portfolio for €500 million.

In December 2023, the company acquired the lactase enzyme business of Danish companies Chr. Hansen and Novozymes for €150 million.

In December 2024, 82% of eligible Kerry Co-op members approved a €1.4 billion proposal to acquire 70% of Kerry Dairy Ireland and exchange their Co-op shares for direct ownership in Kerry Group Plc. To fund the deal, 2.9 million Kerry Plc shares will be redeemed, raising €250 million, with the balance covered by loans linked to the share price. Members will have the flexibility to hold or sell their shares, while Kerry’s dairy farmers will have the opportunity to purchase the remaining 30% of Kerry Dairy Ireland by 2035 for €150 million.

<doc id="1053299" wikidata="Q1063123" url="?curid=1053299" title="Anti-Catholicism">
<text>Anti-Catholicism, also known as Catholophobia, is hostility towards Catholics and opposition to the Catholic Church, its clergy, and its adherents. At various points after the Reformation, many majority-Protestant states, including England, Northern Ireland, Prussia and Germany, Scotland, and the United States, turned anti-Catholicism, opposition to the authority of Catholic clergy (anti-clericalism), opposition to the authority of the pope (anti-papalism), mockery of Catholic rituals, and opposition to Catholic adherents into major political themes and policies of religious discrimination and religious persecution. Major examples of groups that have targeted Catholics in recent history include Ulster loyalists in Northern Ireland during the Troubles and the second Ku Klux Klan in the United States. The anti-Catholic sentiment which resulted from this trend frequently led to religious discrimination against Catholic communities and individuals and it occasionally led to the religious persecution of them (frequently, they were derogatorily referred to as &quot;papists&quot; or &quot;Romanists&quot; in Anglophone and Protestant countries). Historian John Wolffe identifies four types of anti-Catholicism: constitutional-national, theological, popular and socio-cultural.

Historically, Catholics who lived in Protestant countries were frequently suspected of conspiring against the state in furtherance of papal interests. Their support of the alien pope led to allegations that they lacked loyalty to the state. In majority Protestant countries which experienced large scale immigration, such as the United States and Australia, suspicion of Catholic immigrants and/or discrimination against them frequently overlapped or was conflated with nativist, xenophobic, ethnocentric and/or racist sentiments (e.g. anti-Irish sentiment, anti-Filipino sentiment, anti-Italianism, anti-Spanish sentiment, and anti-Slavic sentiment, specifically anti-Polish sentiment).

In the early modern period, the Catholic Church struggled to maintain its traditional religious and political role in the face of rising secular power in Catholic countries. As a result of these struggles, a hostile attitude towards the considerable political, social, spiritual and religious power of the Pope and the clergy arose in majority Catholic countries in the form of anti-clericalism. The Inquisition was a favorite target of attack. After the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, anti-clerical forces gained strength in some primarily Catholic nations, such as France, Spain, Mexico, and certain regions of Italy (especially in Emilia-Romagna). Certain political parties in these historically Catholic regions subscribed to and propagated an internal form of anti-Catholicism, generally known as anti-clericalism, that expressed a hostile attitude towards the Catholic Church as an establishment and the overwhelming political, social, spiritual and religious power of the Catholic Church. Anti-clerical governments often attacked the Pope&#x27;s ability to appoint bishops in order to ensure that the Church would not be independent from the State, confiscated Church property, expelled Catholic religious orders such as the Jesuits, banned Classical Christian education, and sought to replace it with a State-controlled school system.

==In primarily Protestant countries==


Protestant Reformers, including Martin Luther, John Calvin, John Wycliffe, Henry VIII, Thomas Cranmer, John Thomas, Ellen G. White, John Knox, Charles Taze Russell, Isaac Newton, Roger Williams, Cotton Mather, and John Wesley, as well as most Protestants of the 16th–19th centuries, identified the Papacy with the Antichrist. The Centuriators of Magdeburg, a group of Lutheran scholars in Magdeburg which was headed by Matthias Flacius, wrote the 12-volume &quot;Magdeburg Centuries&quot; in order to discredit the Papacy and lead other Christians to recognize the Pope as the Antichrist. The fifth round of talks in the Lutheran–Catholic dialogue notes,

Doctrinal works of literature which were published by the Lutherans, the Reformed churches, the Presbyterians, the Baptists, the Anabaptists, and the Methodists contain references to the Pope as the Antichrist, including the Smalcald Articles, Article 4 (1537), the &quot;Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope&quot; (1537), the Westminster Confession, Article 25.6 (1646), and the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith, Article 26.4. In 1754, John Wesley published his &quot;Explanatory Notes Upon the New Testament&quot;, which is currently an official Doctrinal Standard of the United Methodist Church. In his notes on the Book of Revelation (chapter 13), he commented: &quot;The whole succession of Popes from Gregory VII are undoubtedly Antichrists. Yet this hinders not, but that the last Pope in this succession will be more eminently the Antichrist, the Man of Sin, adding to that of his predecessors a peculiar degree of wickedness from the bottomless pit.&quot;

Referring to the Book of Revelation, Edward Gibbon stated that &quot;The advantage of turning those mysterious prophecies against the See of Rome, inspired the Protestants with uncommon veneration for so useful an ally.&quot; Protestants condemned the Catholic policy of mandatory celibacy for priests.

During the Enlightenment Era, which spanned the 17th and 18th centuries, with its strong emphasis on the need for religious toleration, the Inquisition was a favorite target of attack for intellectuals.

===British Empire===
====Great Britain====

Institutional anti-Catholicism in Britain and Ireland began with the English Reformation under Henry VIII. The Act of Supremacy of 1534 declared the English crown to be &quot;the only supreme head on earth of the Church in England&quot; in place of the pope. Any act of allegiance to the latter was considered treasonous because the papacy claimed to have both spiritual and political power over its followers. It was under this act that saints Thomas More and John Fisher were executed and became martyrs for the Catholic faith.

Queen Mary, Henry&#x27;s daughter, was a devout Catholic. She tried to reverse the Reformation during her five years as Queen (1553-1558), marrying the Catholic king of Spain and executing Protestant leaders. Protestants reviled her as &quot;Bloody Mary&quot;.
Anti-Catholicism among many of the English was not only grounded in their fear that the pope sought to reimpose religio-spiritual authority over England, it was also grounded in their fear that the pope also sought to impose secular power over them in alliance with their arch-enemies France and Spain. In 1570, Pope Pius V sought to depose Elizabeth with the papal bull &quot;Regnans in Excelsis&quot;, which declared that she was a heretic and purportedly dissolved the duty of all of Elizabeth&#x27;s subjects to maintain their allegiance to her. This rendered Elizabeth&#x27;s subjects who persisted in their allegiance to the Catholic Church politically suspect, and it also made the position of her Catholic subjects largely untenable if they tried to maintain both allegiances at once. The Recusancy Acts, which made worship in the Anglican Church a legal obligation, date back to Elizabeth&#x27;s reign.

Assassination plots in which Catholics were prime movers fueled anti-Catholicism in England. These plots included the famous Gunpowder Plot, in which Guy Fawkes and other conspirators plotted to blow up the English Parliament while it was in session. The fictitious &quot;Popish Plot&quot; involving Titus Oates was a hoax that many Protestants believed to be true, exacerbating Anglican-Catholic relations.

The Glorious Revolution of 1688–1689 involved the overthrow of King James II, of the Stuart dynasty, who favoured the Catholics, and his replacement by a Dutch Protestant. For decades the Stuarts were supported by France in plots to invade and conquer Britain, and anti-Catholicism persisted.

====Gordon Riots 1780====

The Gordon Riots of 1780 was a violent anti-Catholic riot in London against the Papists Act 1778. Passed by Parliament, the new law was supposed to reduce official discrimination against British Catholics. Lord George Gordon, head of the Protestant Association, warned that the law would enable Catholics who were serving in the British Army to become a dangerous threat. The protest evolved into riots and widespread looting. Local magistrates feared reprisals and as a result, they did not enforce the riot act. The riots were not suppressed until the Army moved in and dispersed the crowds by shooting them, killing hundreds of rioters. The violence lasted from 2 June to 9 June 1780. Public opinion, especially in middle-class and elite circles, repudiated anti-Catholicism and lower-class violence, and it also rallied behind the government of Lord North. Demands for the establishment of a police force in London were subsequently made.

====19th century====

Anglo-French conflicts during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, which lasted from 1793 until 1815, saw the rise of anti-Catholicism as an underlying method to unify the Protestant populations of England, Scotland and Wales. Permeating through all social classes, antagonism towards Catholicism became firmly enmeshed with British national identity. As noted by English historian Linda Colley in her seminal work &quot;Britons: Forging of a Nation 1707–1837&quot;, the &quot;defensive unity brought on by war with a Catholic French &#x27;other&#x27; helped transform Great Britain from a new and largely artificial polity into a nation with a strong self-image rooted in Protestantism.&quot;

Catholics in Ireland gained the right to vote in the 1790s but they were politically inert for another three decades. Finally, they were mobilized by Daniel O&#x27;Connell into majorities in most of the Irish parliamentary districts. They could only elect, but Catholics could not be seated in parliament. The Catholic emancipation issue became a major crisis. Previously anti-Catholic politicians led by the Duke of Wellington and Robert Peel reversed themselves to prevent massive violence. All Catholics in Britain were &quot;emancipated&quot; in the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829; that is, they were freed from most of the penalties and restrictions they faced. Anti-Catholic attitudes continued, however.

====Early 20th century====

In 1937, ten young men and boys, aged from 13 to 23, burned to death in a fire on a farm in Kirkintilloch, Scotland. All were seasonal workers from Achill Sound in County Mayo, Ireland. &quot;The Vanguard&quot;, the official newspaper of the Scottish Protestant League, referred to the event in the following text:
:The Scandal of Kirkintilloch is not that some Irishmen have lost their lives in a fire; it is that Irish Papists brought up in disloyalty and superstition are engaged in jobs which should belong by right to Scottish Protestants.

:The Kirkintilloch sensation again reminds the People of Scotland that Rome&#x27;s Irish Scum still over-run our land.

====Since 1945====
Since World War II, anti-Catholic feeling in England has abated somewhat. Ecumenical dialogue between Anglicans and Catholics culminated in the first meeting between an Archbishop of Canterbury and a Pope since the Reformation when Archbishop Geoffrey Fisher visited Rome in 1960. Since then, the dialogue has continued through envoys and standing conferences. Meanwhile, both the nonconformist churches such as the Methodists, and the established Church of England, have dramatically declined in membership. Membership in the Catholic Church continues to grow in Britain, thanks to the immigration of Irish and more recently, the immigration of Polish workers.

Conflict and rivalry between Catholicism and Protestantism since the 1920s, especially since the 1960s, has centered on the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

Anti-Catholicism in Britain was long represented by the burning of an effigy of the Catholic conspirator Guy Fawkes during widespread celebrations of Guy Fawkes Night every 5 November. However, this celebration has lost most of its anti-Catholic connotations. According to Clive D. Field, only faint remnants of anti-Catholicism are found today.

====Ireland====

As punishment for the rebellion of 1641, almost all of the lands which were owned by Irish Catholics were confiscated and given to Protestant settlers. Under the Penal Laws, no Irish Catholic could sit in the Parliament of Ireland, even though some 90% of Ireland&#x27;s population was native Irish Catholic when the first of these bans was introduced in 1691. Tensions between Irish Catholics and Protestants have been blamed for much of &quot;The Troubles&quot;.

During the 18th century, the Peep o&#x27; Day Boys, an agrarian association composed of Irish Protestants, engaged in numerous acts of anti-Catholic violence through County Armagh. These acts culminated in the Armagh disturbances, a period of intense sectarian conflict during the 1780&#x27;s and 1790&#x27;s between the Peep o&#x27; Day Boys and the Catholic Defenders. The Peep o&#x27; Day Boys would conduct early morning raids on Catholic homes to confiscate weapons, which Irish Catholics were forbidden from owning under the Penal Laws. This led to confrontations between them and the Defenders, which culminated in the Battle of the Diamond, a confrontation which saw six killed and many more wounded. Though the Orange Order would denounce the actions of the Peep o&#x27; Day Boys, further anti-Catholic violence would continue to erupt in Ireland in the years leading up the Irish Rebellion of 1798.

=====Laws which restricted the rights of Irish Catholics=====

The Great Famine of Ireland was exacerbated by the imposition of anti-Catholic laws. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the penal laws prohibited Irish Catholics from either purchasing or leasing land, from voting, from holding political office, from living either within away from a corporate town, from obtaining an education, from entering a profession, and doing many of the other things which a person needed to do in order to succeed and prosper in society. The laws had largely been reformed by 1793, and in 1829, Irish Catholics could again sit in parliament following the Act of Emancipation.

====Northern Ireland====

The state of Northern Ireland came into existence in 1921, following the Government of Ireland Act 1920. Though Catholics were a majority on the island of Ireland, comprising 74% of the population in 1911, they were a third of the population in Northern Ireland.

In 1934, Sir James Craig, the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, said, &quot;Since we took up office we have tried to be absolutely fair towards all the citizens of Northern Ireland... They still boast of Southern Ireland being a Catholic State. All I boast of is that we are a Protestant Parliament and a Protestant State.&quot;

In 1957, Harry Midgley, the Minister of Education in Northern Ireland, said, in Portadown Orange Hall, &quot;All the minority are traitors and have always been traitors to the Government of Northern Ireland.&quot;

The first Catholic to be appointed a minister in Northern Ireland was Dr Gerard Newe, in 1971.

In 1986, at the annual conference of the Democratic Unionist Party, MP for Mid Ulster William McCrea interrupted councillor Ethel Smyth when she said she regretted the death of Sean Downes, a 24-year-old Catholic civilian who had been killed by a plastic bullet fired by the RUC during an anti-internment march in Andersonstown in 1984. McCrea shouted, &quot;No. No. I&#x27;ll not condemn the death of John Downes [sic]. No Fenian. Never. No&quot;. In Northern Ireland and Scotland, &quot;Fenian&quot; is used by some as a derogatory word for Roman Catholics.

In 2001 and 2002, the Holy Cross dispute occurred in the Ardoyne area of north Belfast. The Holy Cross school, a Catholic primary school for girls, is situated in the middle of a Protestant area. In June 2001—during the last week of school before the summer break—Protestant loyalists began picketing the school, claiming that Catholics were regularly attacking their homes and denying them access to facilities. The picket resumed on 3 September, when the new school term began. For weeks, hundreds of loyalist protesters tried to stop the schoolchildren and their parents from walking to school through their area. Hundreds of riot police, backed up by British soldiers, escorted the children and parents through the protest each day. Some protesters shouted sectarian abuse and threw stones, bricks, fireworks, blast bombs and urine-filled balloons at the schoolchildren, their parents and the RUC. The &quot;scenes of frightened Catholic schoolgirls running a gauntlet of abuse from loyalist protesters as they walked to school captured world headlines&quot;. Death threats were made against the parents and school staff by the Red Hand Defenders, a loyalist paramilitary group.

====Canada====

Fears of the Catholic Church were quite strong in the 19th century, especially among Presbyterian and other Protestant Irish immigrants across Canada.

In 1853, the Gavazzi Riots left 10 dead in Quebec in the wake of Catholic Irish protests against anti-Catholic speeches by ex-monk Alessandro Gavazzi. The most influential newspaper in Canada, &quot;The Globe&quot; of Toronto, was edited by George Brown, a Presbyterian immigrant from Ireland who ridiculed and denounced the Catholic Church, Jesuits, priests, nunneries, etc. Irish Protestants remained a political force until the 20th century. Many belonged to the Orange Order, an anti-Catholic organization with chapters across Canada that was most powerful during the late 19th century.

A key leader was Dalton McCarthy (1836–1898), a Protestant who had immigrated from Ireland. In the late 19th century he mobilized the &quot;Orange&quot; or Protestant Irish, and fiercely fought against Irish Catholics as well as the French Catholics. He especially crusaded for the abolition of the French language in Manitoba and Ontario schools.

In response to the 2021 Canadian Indian residential school gravesite discoveries, numerous churches and monuments in Western Canada have been vandalized or burned down.

====French language schools in Canada====
One of the most controversial issues was public support for Catholic French-language schools. Although the Confederation Agreement of 1867 guaranteed the status of Catholic schools when they were legalized by provincial governments, disputes erupted in numerous provinces, especially in the Manitoba Schools Question in the 1890s and in Ontario in the 1910s. In Ontario, Regulation 17 was a regulation by the Ontario Ministry of Education that restricted the use of French as a language of instruction to the first two years of schooling. French Canada reacted vehemently and lost, dooming its French-language Catholic schools. This was a central reason for French Canada&#x27;s distance from the World War I effort, as its young men refused to enlist.

Protestant elements succeeded in blocking the growth of French-language Catholic public schools. However, the Irish Catholics generally supported the English language position which was advocated by the Protestants.

====Newfoundland====
Newfoundland long experienced social and political tensions between the large Irish Catholic working-class, on the one hand and the Anglican elite on the other. In the 1850s, the Catholic bishop organized his flock and made them stalwarts of the Liberal party. Nasty rhetoric was the prevailing style elections; bloody riots were common during the 1861 election. The Protestants narrowly elected Hugh Hoyles as the Conservative Prime Minister. Hoyles unexpectedly reversed his long record of militant Protestant activism and worked to defuse tensions. He shared patronage and power with the Catholics; all jobs and patronage were split between the various religious bodies on a per capita basis. This &#x27;denominational compromise&#x27; was further extended to education when all religious schools were put on the basis which the Catholics had enjoyed since the 1840s. Alone in North America Newfoundland had a state funded system of denominational schools. The compromise worked and politics ceased to be about religion and became concerned with purely political and economic issues.

====Australia====
The presence of Catholicism in Australia came with the 1788 arrival of the First Fleet of British convict ships at Sydney. The colonial authorities blocked a Catholic clerical presence until 1820, reflecting the legal disabilities of Catholics in Britain. Some of the Irish convicts had been transported to Australia for political crimes or social rebellion and authorities remained suspicious of the minority religion.

Catholic convicts were compelled to attend Church of England services and their children and orphans were raised as Anglicans. The first Catholic priests to arrive came as convicts following the Irish 1798 Rebellion. In 1803, Fr James Dixon was conditionally emancipated and permitted to celebrate Mass, but following the Irish led Castle Hill Rebellion of 1804, Dixon&#x27;s permission was revoked. Fr Jeremiah Flynn, an Irish Cistercian, was appointed as Prefect Apostolic of New Holland and set out uninvited from Britain for the colony. Watched by authorities, Flynn secretly performed priestly duties before being arrested and deported to London. Reaction to the affair in Britain led to two further priests being allowed to travel to the colony in 1820. The Church of England was disestablished in the Colony of New South Wales by the &quot;Church Act of 1836&quot;. Drafted by the Catholic attorney-general John Plunkett, the act established legal equality for Anglicans, Catholics and Presbyterians and was later extended to Methodists.

By the late 19th century approximately a quarter of the population of Australia were Irish Australians. Many were descended from the 40,000 Irish Catholics who were transported as convicts to Australia before 1867. The majority consisted of British and Irish Protestants. The Catholics dominated the labour unions and the Labor Party. The growth of school systems in the late 19th century typically involved religious issues, pitting Protestants against Catholics. The issue of independence for Ireland was long a sore point, until the matter was resolved by the Irish War of Independence.

Limited freedom of belief is protected by Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia, but sectarianism in Australia was prominent (though generally nonviolent) in the 20th century, flaring during the First World War, again reflecting Ireland&#x27;s place within the Empire, and the Catholic minority remained subject to discrimination and suspicion. During the First World War, the Irish gave support for the war effort and comprised 20% of the army in France. However, the labour unions and the Irish in particular, strongly opposed conscription, and in alliance with like-minded farmers, defeated it in national plebiscites in 1916 and 1917. The Anglicans in particular talked of Catholic &quot;disloyalty&quot;. By the 1920s, Australia had its first Catholic prime minister.

During the 1950s, the split in the Australian Labor Party between allies and opponents of the Catholic anti-Communist B. A. Santamaria meant that the party (in Victoria and Queensland more than elsewhere) was effectively divided between pro-Catholic and anti-Catholic elements. As a result of such disunity the ALP was defeated at every single national election between 1955 and 1972. In the late 20th century, the Catholic Church replaced the Anglican Church as the largest single Christian body in Australia; and it continues to be so in the 21st century, although it still has fewer members than do the various Protestant churches combined.

While older sectarian divides declined, commentators have observed a re-emergence of anti-Catholicism in Australia in recent decades amid rising secularism and broader anti-Christian movements.

====New Zealand====
According to New Zealand historian Michael King, the situation in New Zealand has never been as clear as in Australia. Catholics first arrived in New Zealand in 1769, and the Church has had a continuous presence in the country from the time of permanent settlement by Irish Catholics in the 1820s, with the first Maori converted to Catholicism in the 1830s. The signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, which formalised New Zealand&#x27;s status as a British colony and instigated substantial immigration from England and Scotland, resulted in the country developing a predominantly Protestant religious character. Nonetheless, French bishop Jean Baptiste Pompallier was able to negotiate the inclusion of a clause guaranteeing freedom of religion in some of the versions of the treaties signed and oral promises during meetings beforehand.

New Zealand has had several Catholic prime ministers, which is indicative of the widespread acceptance of Catholicism within the country; Jim Bolger, who lead the Fourth National Government of the 1990s, was the country&#x27;s fourth Catholic prime minister; Bill English, who lead the Fifth National Government from 2016 to 2017, was the fifth and most recent. Probably the most notable of New Zealand&#x27;s Catholic prime ministers was Michael Joseph Savage, an Australian-born trade unionist and social reformer who instigated numerous progressive policies as leader of the First Labour Government of the 1930s.

===German Empire===

Unification into the German Empire in 1871 saw a country with a Protestant majority and large Catholic minority, speaking German or Polish. Anti-Catholicism was common. The powerful German Chancellor Otto von Bismarcka devout Lutheranforged an alliance with secular liberals in 1871–1878 to launch a Kulturkampf (literally, &quot;culture struggle&quot;) especially in Prussia, the largest state in the new German Empire to destroy the political power of the Catholic Church and the Pope. Catholics were numerous in the South (Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg) and west (Rhineland) and fought back. Bismarck intended to end Catholics&#x27; loyalty with Rome (ultramontanism) and subordinate all Germans to the power of his state.

Priests and bishops who resisted the Kulturkampf were arrested or removed from their positions. By the height of anti-Catholic legislation, half of the Prussian bishops were in prison or in exile, a quarter of the parishes had no priest, half the monks and nuns had left Prussia, a third of the monasteries and convents were closed, 1800 parish priests were imprisoned or exiled, and thousands of laymen were imprisoned for helping the priests. There were anti-Polish elements in Greater Poland and Silesia. The Catholics refused to comply; they strengthened their Centre Party.

Pius IX died in 1878 and was replaced by more conciliatory Pope Leo XIII who negotiated away most of the anti-Catholic laws beginning in 1880. Bismarck himself broke with the anti-Catholic Liberals and worked with the Catholic Centre Party to fight Socialism. Pope Leo officially declared the end of the Kulturkampf on 23 May 1887.

====Nazi Germany====
The Catholic Church faced repression in Nazi Germany (1933–1945). Hitler despised the Church even though he had been brought up in a Catholic home. The long-term aim of many Nazis was the de-Christianization of Germany and the establishment of a form of Germanic paganism which would replace Christianity. however Richard J. Evans writes that Hitler believed that in the long run National Socialism and religion would not be able to co-exist, stressing repeatedly that Nazism was a secular ideology, founded on modern science: &quot;Science, he declared, would easily destroy the last remaining vestiges of superstition&quot;. Germany could not tolerate the intervention of foreign influences such as the Pope and &quot;Priests, he said, were &#x27;black bugs&#x27;, &#x27;abortions in black cassocks. Nazi ideology desired the subordination of the Church to the State and could not accept an autonomous establishment, whose legitimacy did not spring from the government. From the beginning, the Catholic Church faced general persecution, regimentation and oppression. Aggressive anti-Church radicals like Alfred Rosenberg and Martin Bormann saw the conflict with the Churches as a priority concern, and anti-Church and anti-clerical sentiments were strong among grassroots party activists. To many Nazis, Catholics were suspected of insufficient patriotism, or even of disloyalty to the Fatherland, and of serving the interests of &quot;sinister alien forces&quot;.

Adolf Hitler had some regard for the organisational power of Catholicism, but towards its teachings he showed nothing but the sharpest hostility, calling them &quot;the systematic cultivation of the human failure&quot;: To Hitler, Christianity was a religion that was only fit for slaves and he detested its ethics. Alan Bullock wrote: &quot;Its teaching, he declared, was a rebellion against the natural law of selection by struggle and the survival of the fittest&quot;. For political reasons, Hitler was prepared to restrain his anti-clericalism, seeing danger in strengthening the Church by persecuting it, but he intended to wage a show-down against it after the war. Joseph Goebbels, the Minister for Propaganda, led the Nazi persecution of the Catholic clergy and wrote that there was &quot;an insoluble opposition between the Christian and a heroic-German world view&quot;. Hitler&#x27;s chosen deputy, Martin Bormann, was a rigid guardian of Nazi orthodoxy and saw Christianity and Nazism as &quot;incompatible&quot;, as did the official Nazi philosopher, Alfred Rosenberg, who wrote in &quot;Myth of the Twentieth Century&quot; (1930) that the Catholic Church were among the chief enemies of the Germans. In 1934, the &quot;Sanctum Officium&quot; put Rosenberg&#x27;s book on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; (forbidden books list of the Church) for scorning and rejecting &quot;all dogmas of the Catholic Church, indeed the very fundamentals of the Christian religion&quot;.

The Nazis claimed that they had jurisdiction over all collective and social activities and based on their claim, they infiltrated all collective and social institutions, interfered in all of the activities which they performed, and banned them if they did not become Nazified, including Catholic schools, youth groups, workers&#x27; clubs and cultural societies. Hitler moved quickly to eliminate Political Catholicism, rounding up members of the Catholic aligned Bavarian People&#x27;s Party and Catholic Centre Party, which ceased to exist in early July 1933. Vice Chancellor Papen meanwhile, amid continuing molestation of Catholic clergy and organisations, negotiated a Reich concordat with the Holy See, which prohibited clergy from participating in politics. Hitler then proceeded to close all Catholic institutions whose functions were not strictly religious:

Almost immediately after agreeing the Concordat, the Nazis promulgated their sterilization law, an offensive policy in the eyes of the Catholic Church and moved to dissolve the Catholic Youth League. Clergy, nuns and lay leaders began to be targeted, leading to thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or &quot;immorality&quot;. In Hitler&#x27;s Night of the Long Knives purge, Erich Klausener, the head of Catholic Action, was assassinated. Adalbert Probst, national director of the Catholic Youth Sports Association, Fritz Gerlich, editor of Munich&#x27;s Catholic weekly and Edgar Jung, one of the authors of the Marburg speech, were among the other Catholic opposition figures killed in the purge.

By 1937, the Church hierarchy in Germany, which had initially attempted to co-operate with the new government, had become highly disillusioned. In March, Pope Pius XI issued the &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; encyclicalaccusing the Nazis of violations of the Concordat, and of sowing the &quot;tares of suspicion, discord, hatred, calumny, of secret and open fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church&quot;. The Pope noted on the horizon the &quot;threatening storm clouds&quot; of religious wars of extermination over Germany. The Nazis responded with, an intensification of the Church Struggle. There were mass arrests of clergy and Church presses were expropriated. Goebbels renewed the regime&#x27;s crackdown and propaganda against Catholics. By 1939 all Catholic denominational schools had been disbanded or converted to public facilities. By 1941, all Church press had been banned.

Later Catholic protests included the 22 March 1942 pastoral letter by the German bishops on &quot;The Struggle against Christianity and the Church&quot;. About 30 per cent of Catholic priests were disciplined by police during the Nazi era. In effort to counter the strength and influence of spiritual resistance, the security services monitored Catholic clergy very closelyinstructing that agents monitor every diocese, that the bishops&#x27; reports to the Vatican should be obtained and that bishops&#x27; activities be discovered and reported. Priests were frequently denounced, arrested, or sent to concentration campsmany to the dedicated clergy barracks at Dachau. Of a total of 2,720 clergy imprisoned at Dachau, some 2,579 (or 95%) were Catholic. Nazi policy towards the Church was at its most severe in the territories it annexed to Greater Germany, where the Nazis set about systematically dismantling the Churcharresting its leaders, exiling its clergymen, closing its churches, monasteries and convents. Many clergymen were murdered.

===Netherlands===

The independence of the Netherlands from Spanish rule led to the formation of a majority Protestant country in which the dominant form of Protestantism was Calvinism. In Amsterdam, Catholic priests were driven out of the city and following the Dutch takeover, all Catholic churches were converted into Protestant churches. Amsterdam&#x27;s relationship with the Catholic Church was not normalized until the 20th century.

===Nordic countries===
====Norway====

After the dissolution of Denmark-Norway in 1814, the new Norwegian Constitution of 1814, did not grant religious freedom, as it stated that both Jews and Jesuits were denied entrance to the Kingdom of Norway. It also stated that attendance in a Lutheran church was compulsory, effectively banning Catholics. The ban on Catholicism was lifted in 1842, and the ban on Jews was lifted in 1851. At first, there were multiple restrictions on the practice of Catholicism by Norwegians and only foreign citizens were freely allowed to practice it. The first post-reformation parish was founded in 1843, Catholics were only allowed to celebrate Mass in this one parish. In 1845 most of the restrictions on the practice of non-Lutheran Christianity were lifted, and Catholics were now allowed to freely practice their religion, but Monasticism and the Jesuits were not allowed in the country until 1897 and 1956 respectively.

====Swedish Empire====

During the period of great power in Sweden, conversions to Catholicism were punished with fines or imprisonment and in exceptional cases, death. Sweden during the Thirty Years War saw itself as the protector of Protestantism in all of Europe against the pope. The Linköping Bloodbath of 20 March 1600 saw several prominent Catholic nobles beheaded by order of King Charles IX of Sweden. The executions were partially motivated by the Polish invasion of Sweden and a threat of a potential Catholic takeover under Polish king Sigismund III Vasa, who planned to reconvert Sweden back to Catholicism. The Battle of Stångebro prevented Sigismund from conquering and reconverting Sweden. Catholic nobles were put in a majority of leading positions by Sigismund In the Swedish government without the approval of the Swedish people or parliament. The conspiracy provoked new laws preventing Catholics from holding leading government positions in the Swedish government. Due to the Austrian emperor winning a lot of great victories before Sweden joined. The war and Swedish successes cemented Protestantism&#x27;s continued survival in the Holy Roman Empire and the following anti-Catholicism ingrained in the religion.

Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden was known as the &quot;Lion from the North&quot;. He did prevent the pillaging of Catholic villages of Swedish troops by proclaiming Protestant moral superiority in 1631, while Catholic armies were plundering Saxony. He did not wear any armour during the Battle of Rain against the Catholics and proclaimed he was divinely chosen by God to lead the Protestants to glory, and so felt he needed no protection in battle.
Russian Orthodox populations had the right to practice their faith since their incorporation in 1617 after the Ingrian War and never faced similar persecution. Even after Eastern Orthodoxy was legalized, there remained an extreme anti-Catholic sentiment in Sweden which was widely supported by German nobility and German Protestants in Swedish territories.

Only in 1781 did Catholics have the right to worship once again in Sweden, the latest of all major religions except Judaism that was legalized in the same era, even though Judaism had already been in practice tolerated since Charles XII of Sweden brought Muslim and Jewish advisors with him from the Ottoman Empire. While Protestant Swedes could not join any other religious organization until 1873, still, in 1849, Catholic converts were punished with imprisonment. Conversion to Catholicism was punished with fines or imprisonment even after the reform. Catholics could not become a minister of the Swedish government or work as teachers or nurses in Sweden until 1951.

===United States===
John Higham described anti-Catholicism as &quot;the most luxuriant, tenacious tradition of paranoiac agitation in American history.&quot;
* Jenkins, Philip. &quot;The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice&quot; (Oxford University Press, New ed. 2004). British anti-Catholicism was exported to the United States. Two types of anti-Catholic rhetoric existed in colonial society. The first, which was derived from the heritage of the Protestant Reformation and the religious wars of the sixteenth century, consisted of the &quot;Anti-Christ&quot; and the &quot;Whore of Babylon&quot; variety and it dominated Anti-Catholic thought until the late seventeenth century. The second was a more secular variety which focused on the supposed intrigue of the Catholics and accused them of plotting to extend medieval despotism worldwide.

Historian Arthur Schlesinger Sr. has called anti-Catholicism &quot;the deepest-held bias in the history of the American people&quot;.

Historian Joseph G. Mannard says that wars reduced anti-Catholicism: &quot;enough Catholics supported the War for Independence to erase many old myths about the inherently treasonable nature of Catholicism... During the Civil War the heavy enlistments of Irish and Germans into the Union Army helped to dispel notions of immigrant and Catholic disloyalty.&quot;

====Colonial era====
American anti-Catholicism has its origins in the Protestant Reformation which generated anti-Catholic propaganda for various political and dynastic reasons. Because the Protestant Reformation justified itself as an effort to correct what it perceived were the errors and the excesses of the Catholic Church, it formed strong positions against the Catholic bishops and the Papacy in particular. These positions were brought to New England by English colonists who were predominantly Puritans. They opposed not only the Catholic Church but also the Church of England which, due to its perpetuation of some Catholic doctrines and practices, was deemed insufficiently &quot;reformed&quot;. Furthermore, English and Scottish identity to a large extent was based on opposition to Catholicism. &quot;To be English was to be anti-Catholic,&quot; writes Robert Curran.


Because many of the British colonists, such as the Puritans and Congregationalists, were fleeing religious persecution by the Church of England, much of early American religious culture exhibited the more extreme anti-Catholic bias of these Protestant denominations. Monsignor John Tracy Ellis wrote that a &quot;universal anti-Catholic bias was brought to Jamestown in 1607 and vigorously cultivated in all the thirteen colonies from Massachusetts to Georgia&quot;. Colonial charters and laws often contained specific proscriptions against Catholics. For example, the second Massachusetts charter of October 7, 1691, decreed &quot;that forever hereafter there shall be liberty of conscience allowed in the worship of God to all Christians, except Papists, inhabiting, or which shall inhabit or be resident within, such Province or Territory&quot;. Historians have only identified one Catholic who lived in colonial BostonAnn Glover. She was hanged as a witch in 1688, four years before the much more famous witchcraft trials in nearby Salem.

Monsignor Ellis noted that a common hatred of the Catholic Church could unite Anglican clerics and Puritan ministers despite their differences and conflicts. One of the Intolerable Acts passed by the British Parliament that helped fuel the American Revolution was the Quebec Act of 1774, which granted freedom of worship to Roman Catholics in Canada.

====New nation====
The patriot reliance on Catholic France for military, financial and diplomatic aid led to a sharp drop in anti-Catholic rhetoric. Indeed, the king replaced the pope as the demon patriots had to fight against. Anti-Catholicism remained strong among loyalists, some of whom went to Canada after the war while most remained in the new nation. By the 1780s, Catholics were extended legal toleration in all of the New England states that previously had been so hostile. &quot;In the midst of war and crisis, New Englanders gave up not only their allegiance to Britain but one of their most dearly held prejudices.&quot;

George Washington was a vigorous promoter of tolerance for all religious denominations as commander of the army (1775–1783) where he suppressed anti-Catholic celebrations in the Army and appealed to French Catholics in Canada to join the American Revolution; a few hundred of them did. Likewise he guaranteed a high degree of freedom of religion as president (1789–1797), when he often attended services of different denominations. The military alliance with Catholic France in 1778 changed attitudes radically in Boston. Local leaders enthusiastically welcomed French naval and military officers, realizing the alliance was critical to winning independence. The Catholic chaplain of the French army reported in 1781 that he was continually receiving &quot;new civilities&quot; from the best families in Boston; he also noted that &quot;the people in general retain their own prejudices.&quot; By 1790, about 500 Catholics in Boston formed the first Catholic Church there.

Fear of the pope agitated some of America&#x27;s Founding Fathers. For example, in 1788, John Jay urged the New York Legislature to prohibit Catholics from holding office. The legislature refused, but did pass a law designed to reach the same goal by requiring all office-holders to renounce foreign authorities &quot;in all matters ecclesiastical as well as civil&quot;. Thomas Jefferson, looking at the Catholic Church in France, wrote, &quot;History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government&quot;, and &quot;In every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the despot, abetting his abuses in return for protection to his own.&quot;

====1840s–1850s====

Anti-Catholic fears reached a peak in the nineteenth century when the Protestant population became alarmed by the influx of Catholic immigrants. Irish and German Catholic immigrants in particular were pouring into the US at rapid speeds in the early decades of the nineteenth century. Some settled in urban centers in the East, but a large portion also began moving to the unsettled western land along the Mississippi River Valley. The land provided the resources that they would need to survive in their new home, but it also created tensions with the Protestant Americans looking to inhabit the land themselves. Theories about the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s intentions were abundant since it appeared that the church was impeding on the Protestants&#x27; right to the western lands.

Some Protestant ministers preached the belief that the Catholic Church is the Whore of Babylon which is described in the Book of Revelation. The resulting &quot;nativist&quot; movement, which achieved prominence in the 1840s, was whipped into a frenzy of anti-Catholicism that led to mob violence, most notably the Philadelphia Nativist Riot of 1844. Historian David Montgomery argues that the Irish Catholic Democrats in Philadelphia had successfully appealed to the upper-class Whig leadership. The Whigs wanted to split the Democratic coalition, so they approved Bishop Kendrick&#x27;s request that Catholic children be allowed to use their own Bible. That approval outraged the evangelical Protestant leadership, which rallied its support in Philadelphia and nationwide. Montgomery states:
:The school controversy, however, had united 94 leading clergymen of the city in a common pledge to strengthen Protestant education and &quot;awaken the attention of the community to the dangers which... threaten these United States from the assaults of Romanism.&quot; The American Tract Society took up the battle cry and launched a national crusade to save the nation from the &quot;spiritual despotism&quot; of Rome. The whole Protestant edifice of churches, Bible societies, temperance societies, and missionary agencies was thus interposed against Catholic electoral maneuvers ... at the very moment when those maneuvers were enjoying some success.

The nativist movement found expression in a national political movement called the &quot;American&quot; or Know-Nothing Party of 1854–1856. It had considerable success in local and state elections in 1854–55 by emphasizing nativism and warning against Catholics and immigrants. It nominated former president Millard Fillmore as its presidential candidate in the 1856 election. However, Fillmore was not anti-Catholic or nativist; his campaign concentrated almost entirely on national unity. Historian Tyler Anbinder says, &quot;The American party had dropped nativism from its agenda.&quot; Fillmore won 22% of the national popular vote.

During this period of time, discussions of public versus religious education were growing in both urban and rural settings. Protestants and Catholics alike understood the importance of educating the youth; however, finding common ground on how to approach education became a challenge with differing values mixing together.

While the push for moderated school systems increased in the mid-nineteenth century, government oversight was common, especially in less-populated, rural regions. As such, the local church and community tended to create educational systems centered on their particular faith, and education was largely seen as a group effort. In urban areas, public education was more closely monitored and at the forefront of politics since cities saw the largest increases in immigrant population which brought in new children to educate.

Many Catholic immigrants coming into the United States found it was more comforting to stay tightly-knit with those of the same nationality, leading churches to create their own educational facilities for the children within a particular community. Every immigrant group coming from a Catholic country had unique saints to venerate and views on how to educate their children, so ethnic groups tended to stick together in order to preserve their traditions. Classes were taught in the immigrants&#x27; native language in an attempt to keep their culture alive as well, but many American Protestants viewed this negatively, as though the immigrants were unwilling to adjust to their new lives in an English-speaking nation.

The push for public education came from a hope that America would become a more prosperous place if it were made up of well-rounded, well-educated individuals. And because immigrants made up a large portion of the population, common education had to be established. Many Catholic communities wanted to remain separate, though, since public education tended to have Biblical influence from the Protestant Christian King James Bible. Major disputes erupted because the Catholic church did not want their youth to be educated under Protestant ideologies, as most public schools read Bible hymns and utilized McGuffey Readers, which featured Biblical passages teaching moral lessons to students from a Protestant point of view.

The disagreements between faiths led leaders of public education systems, typically Protestant in faith, to advocate for disintegration between schools. To the leaders, the Catholic community was not worthwhile and had too many differences from Protestantism; therefore, they assumed, combining educational systems would only bring about further complications. Additionally, combining systems meant leaders on either side would have to give up their authority in dictating the ideas and lessons pushed to the forefront in public education.

Anti-Catholicism among American Jews further intensified in the 1850s during the international controversy over the Edgardo Mortara case, when a baptized Jewish boy in the Papal States was removed from his family and refused to return to them.

==== 1860s-1890s ====
The First Vatican Council convened in 1869 and caused another rift to form between Catholics and Protestants. The Council passed the doctrine of papal infallibility, claiming that the pope, like Peter in ancient Christianity, retained an ability to make definitive decisions about official doctrinal disputes over faith and morals. Protestants viewed this as an attempt for the Roman Catholic Church and the pope, who was Pope Pius IX at the time, to establish greater power over their Catholic followers.

This distrust of Rome continued to infiltrate the educational facilities in the United States as well, leading to the fight for eliminating government-funded Catholic schooling. Many cities made attempts to integrate school systems, though there were varying degrees of success. One of the successful attempts was allowing Catholic teachers to find work within public schools, teaching children of countless denominations. But there were instances of limiting Catholics in public education as seen in Poughkeepsie, NY, in 1873 when a law was passed that forbade Catholic garments from being worn within public education facilities--it was not repealed until 1898.

In the Orange Riots in New York City in 1871 and 1872, Irish Catholics violently attacked Irish Protestants, who carried orange banners.

In 1875, another attempt at limiting Catholic funding came about in the form of the Blaine Amendment. It was brought into the courts after James G. Blaine, who was searching for a campaign platform for presidency, created an argument for defunding parochial, or denominational, schools. Though it was not explicitly stated to be against Catholicism, Catholic versus public education had been a heated topic for several years by this point. Many newspapers argued that Blaine wanted to build his following from those who held anti-Catholic beliefs. Although the amendment was vetoed, it made lasting impacts on the United States. After 1875, many states passed constitutional provisions, called &quot;Blaine Amendments&quot;, forbidding tax money be used to fund parochial schools. In 2002, the United States Supreme Court partially vitiated these amendments, when they ruled that vouchers were constitutional if tax dollars followed a child to a school even if the school were religious.

A favorite rhetorical device in the 1870s was using the code words for Catholicism: &quot;superstition, ambition and ignorance&quot;. President Ulysses Grant in a major speech to veterans in October 1875 warned that America again faced an enemy: religious schools. Grant saw another civil war in the &quot;near future&quot;: it would not be between North and South, but will be between &quot;patriotism and intelligence on the one side and superstition, ambition and ignorance on the other.&quot; According to historian Charles W. Calhoun, &quot;at various points in his life, Grant had bristled privately at what he considered religious communicants&#x27; thralldom to a domineering clergy, but he did not specifically mention Catholicism in his speech. Still, Catholic journals decried the president&#x27;s seeming exploitation of religious bigotry.&quot; In his December 1875 Annual Message to Congress, Grant urged taxation on &quot;vast amounts of untaxed church property&quot; which Professor John McGreevey says was &quot;a transparently anti-Catholic measure since only the Catholic Church owned vast amounts of propertyin schools, orphanages, and charitable institutions&quot;. Grant told Congress such legislation would protect American citizens from tyranny &quot;whether directed by the demagogue or by priestcraft.&quot;

====20th and 21st centuries====
Anti-Catholicism played a major role in the defeat of Al Smith, the Democratic nominee for president in 1928. Smith did very well in Catholic precincts, but he did poorly in the South relative to previous Democratic presidential candidates, as well as among the Lutherans of the North. His candidacy was also hampered by his close ties to the notorious Tammany Hall political machine in New York City and his strong opposition to prohibition. His cause was uphill in any case, because he faced a popular Republican leadership in a year of peace and unprecedented prosperity.

The passage of the 18th Amendment in 1919, a culmination of a half-century of anti-liquor agitation, also fueled anti-Catholic sentiment. Prohibition enjoyed strong support among dry pietistic Protestants, and equally strong opposition by wet Catholics, Episcopalians, and German Lutherans. The drys focused their distrust on the Catholics who showed little popular support for the enforcement of prohibition laws, and when the Great Depression began in 1929, there was increasing sentiment that the government needed the tax revenue which the repeal of Prohibition would bring.

Over 10 million Protestant soldiers who served in World War II came into close contact with Catholic soldiers; they got along well and, after the war, they played a central role in spreading a greater level of ethnic and religious toleration for Catholics among other white Americans. Although anti-Catholic sentiment declined in the U.S. in the 1960s, particularly after John F. Kennedy became the first Catholic U.S. president, traces of it persist in both the media and popular culture. In March 2000, the Catholic League criticized &quot;Slate&quot; magazine and journalist Jack Shafer for a piece the League described as taking &quot;delight in justifying anti-Catholicism.&quot; Anti-Catholic hate crimes against persons and property have also continued to occur. The summer of 2020 saw a wave of anti-Catholic acts which ranged from the vandalization of churches and cathedrals; to the destruction and often the decapitation of statues, particularly statues of St Junipero Serra, Mary, and Jesus; in states including Illinois and Florida. Many of these acts are tied to other political movements, the most notable of them is the QAnon movement, but other far right groups have also espoused anti-Catholic sentiment. One popular conspiracy theory is based on the belief that the three stars on the DC flag stand for London, the Vatican and Washington. Another far-right conspiracy claims the pope was arrested for sexual abuse.

==In primarily Catholic countries==
Anti-clericalism is a historical movement that opposes religious (generally Catholic) institutional power and influence in all aspects of public and political life, and the involvement of religion in the everyday life of the citizen. It suggests a more active and partisan role than mere laïcité. The goal of anticlericalism is sometimes to reduce religion to a purely private belief-system with no public profile or influence. However, many times it has included outright suppression of all aspects of faith.

Anticlericalism has at times been violent, leading to murders and the desecration, destruction and seizure of Church property. Anticlericalism in one form or another has existed throughout most of Christian history, and it is considered to be one of the major popular forces underlying the 16th century reformation. Some of the philosophers of the Enlightenment, including Voltaire, continually attacked the Catholic Church, both its leadership and its priests, claiming that many of its clergy were morally corrupt. These assaults in part led to the suppression of the Jesuits, and played a major part in the wholesale attacks on the very existence of the Church during the French Revolution in the Reign of Terror and the program of dechristianization. Similar attacks on the Church occurred in Mexico and Portugal since their 1910 revolutions and in Spain during the twentieth century.

===Austria===
Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II (emperor 1765–1790) opposed what he called &quot;contemplative&quot; religious institutionsreclusive Catholic institutions that he perceived as doing nothing positive for the community. Although Joseph II was himself a Catholic, he also believed in firm state control of ecclesiastical matters outside of the strictly religious sphere and decreed that Austrian bishops could not communicate directly with the Roman Curia. His policies are included in what is called Josephinism, that promoted the subjection of the Catholic Church in the Habsburg lands to service for the state.

The Secularization Decree issued on 12 January 1782 banned several monastic orders not involved in teaching or healing and liquidated 140 monasteries. The banned monastic orders: Jesuits, Camaldolese, Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, Carmelites, Carthusians, Poor Clares, Order of Saint Benedict, Cistercians, Dominican Order (Order of Preachers), Franciscans, Pauline Fathers and Premonstratensians, and their wealth was taken over by the Religious Fund.

====Austria-Hungary====
Georg Ritter von Schönerer (1842–1921) was an Austrian landowner and politician of Austria-Hungary. He was a major opponent of political Catholicism and the founder of the movement &quot;Away from Rome!&quot;, aimed the conversion of all the Catholic German-speaking population of Austria to Lutheranism, or, in some cases, to the Old Catholic Churches.

===Brazil===
Brazil has the largest number of Catholics in the world, and as a result, it has not experienced any large anti-Catholic movements.

During the 19th century, the Religious Issue was the name given to the crisis when Freemasons in the Brazilian government imprisoned two Catholic bishops for enforcing the Church&#x27;s prohibition against Freemasonry.

Even during times in which the Church was experiencing intense conservatism, such as the era of the Brazilian military dictatorship, anti-Catholicism was not advocated by the left-wing movements (instead, Liberation theology gained force). However, with the growing number of Protestants (especially Neo-Pentecostals) in the country, anti-Catholicism has gained strength. A pivotal moment during the rise of anti-Catholicism was the kicking of the saint episode in 1995. However, owing to the protests of the Catholic majority, the perpetrator was transferred to South Africa for the duration of the controversy.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, drug dealers took advantage of the pandemic to unite five slums in Rio de Janeiro imposing evangelical Protestantism on the area and attacking Catholics (and also members of Umbanda).

===Colombia===

Anti-Catholic and anti-clerical sentiments, some of which were spurred by an anti-clerical conspiracy theory which was circulating in Colombia during the mid-twentieth century, led to the persecution and killing of Catholics, most specifically, the persecution and killing of members of the Catholic clergy, during the events which are known as La Violencia.

===Cuba===
Cuba, under the rule of the atheist Fidel Castro, succeeded in reducing the ability of the Catholic Church to work by deporting one archbishop and 150 Spanish priests, by discriminating against Catholics in public life and education and refusing to accept them as members of the Communist Party. The subsequent flight of 300,000 Cubans from the island also helped to diminish the Church there.

===France===
During the French Revolution (1789–1795), the clergy and the laity were persecuted and Church property was confiscated and destroyed by the new government as part of a process of &quot;Dechristianization&quot;, the aims of which were the destruction of Catholic practices and the destruction of the very faith itself, culminating in the imposition of the atheistic Cult of Reason followed by the imposition of the deistic Cult of the Supreme Being. The persecution led Catholics who lived in the west of France to wage a counterrevolution, the War in the Vendée, and when the state was victorious, it killed tens of thousands of Catholics. A few historians have called the killings a genocide. However, most historians believe that the killings constituted a brutal crackdown against political enemies rather than a genocide. The French invasions of Italy (1796–1799) included an assault on Rome and the exile of Pope Pius VI in 1798.

Relations improved in 1802 when Napoleon came to terms with the Pope in the Concordat of 1801. It allowed the Church to operate but did not give back the lands; it proved satisfactory for a century. By 1815 the Papacy supported the growing alliance against Napoleon, and was re-instated as the State Church during the conservative Bourbon Restoration of 1815–1830. The brief French Revolution of 1848 again opposed the Church, but the Second French Empire (1851–1871) gave it full support. The history of 1789–1871 had established two campsthe left against the Church and the right supporting itthat largely continued until the Vatican II process in 1962–1965.

The Government of France&#x27;s Third Republic (1871–1940) was dominated by anti-clericalism, the desire to secularise the State and cultural life, based on an obsession with being faithful to the most extreme currents of the French Revolution. This was the position of the radicals and socialists. in 1902 Émile Combes became Minister of the Interior, and the main energy of the government was devoted to furthering an anti-clerical agenda. The parties of the Left, Socialists and Radicals, united upon this question in the &quot;Bloc republicain&quot;, supported Combes in his application of the law of 1901 on the religious associations, and voted the new bill on the congregations (1904). By 1904, through his efforts, nearly 10,000 religious schools had been closed and thousands of priests and nuns left France rather than be persecuted. Under his guidance parliament passed the 1905 French law on the separation of Church and State, which reversed the Napoleonic arrangement of 1801.

In the Affaire Des Fiches, in France in 1904–1905, it was discovered that the militantly anticlerical War Minister under Combes, General Louis André, had imposed religious discrimination upon the French armed forces by using the Masonic Grand Orient de France&#x27;s huge card index documenting which military officers were practicing Catholics and attended Mass and then blocking them from all future promotions. Exposure of the policy in the National Assembly by the opposition almost caused the government to fall; instead Emile Combes retired.

===Italy===

In the Napoleonic era, anti-clericalism was a powerful political force. From 1860 through 1870, the new Italian government, under the House of Savoy, outlawed all religious orders, both male and female, including the Franciscans, the Dominicans and the Jesuits, closed down their monasteries and confiscated their property, and imprisoned or banished bishops who opposed this (see Kulturkampf). Italy took over Rome in 1870 when it lost its French protection; the Pope declared himself a prisoner in the Vatican. Relations were finally normalized in 1929 with the Lateran Treaty.

=== Ireland ===
Following the defeat of the Catholic King James II by William III at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, the Protestant elite installed by the English monarchy through Plantations, sought to consolidate their power and prevent any resurgence of Catholic influence. To achieve this, they enacted a series of laws known as the Penal Laws, designed to systematically oppress Catholics and other non-Anglican religious groups.

The Penal laws imposed a number of civil disabilities among Catholics, such as fines for participating in Catholic Worship, and even Capital Punishment for priests found to be practicing their ministry within Great Britain and Ireland. Catholics were also prohibited from being landed, Voting, Teaching, Holding any Public Office and bringing religious paraphernalia from Rome into Britain 

===Mexico===
Following the Reform War, President Benito Juárez issued a decree nationalizing Church properties, separating Church and State, and suppressing religious orders.

In the wake of the Mexican Revolution, the Mexican Constitution of 1917 contained further anti-clerical provisions. Article 3 called for secular education in the schools and prohibited the Church from engaging in primary education; Article 5 outlawed monastic orders; Article 24 forbade public worship outside the confines of churches; and Article 27 placed restrictions on the right of religious organizations to hold property. Article 130 deprived clergy members of political rights.

Mexican President Plutarco Elías Calles&#x27;s strict enforcement of previous anti-clerical legislation denying priests&#x27; rights, enacted as the Calles Law, prompted the Mexican Episcopate to suspend all Catholic worship in Mexico from August 1, 1926, and sparked the bloody Cristero War of 1926–1929 in which some 50,000 peasants took up arms against the government. Their slogan was &quot;¡Viva Cristo Rey!&quot; (Long live Christ the King!).

The effects of the war on the Church were profound. Between 1926 and 1934 at least 40 priests were killed. Where there were 4,500 priests serving the people before the rebellion, in 1934 there were only 334 priests licensed by the government to serve fifteen million people, the rest having been eliminated by emigration, expulsion, assassination or not obtaining licenses. It appears that ten states were left without any priests. Other sources indicate that the persecution was such that, by 1935, 17 states had no registered priests.

Some of the Catholic casualties of this struggle are known as the Saints of the Cristero War. Events relating to this were famously portrayed in the novel &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; by Graham Greene.

===Nicaragua===

===Poland===
&quot;For the situation in Russian Poland, see Anticatholicism in Russian Empire&quot;

Catholicism in Poland, the religion of the vast majority of the population, was severely persecuted during World War II, following the Nazi invasion of the country and its subsequent annexation into Germany. Over 3 million Catholics of Polish descent were murdered during the Invasion of Poland, including 3 bishops, 52 priests, 26 monks, 3 seminarians, 8 nuns and 9 lay people, later beatified in 1999 by Pope John Paul II as the 108 Martyrs of World War II.

The Roman Catholic Church was even more violently suppressed in Reichsgau Wartheland and the General Government. Churches were closed, and clergy were deported, imprisoned, or killed, among them was Maximilian Kolbe, a Pole of German descent. Between 1939 and 1945, 2,935 members of the Polish clergy (18%) were killed in concentration camps. In the city of Chełmno, for example, 48% of the Catholic clergy were killed.

Catholicism continued to be persecuted under the Communist regime from the 1950s. Contemporary Stalinist ideology claimed that the Church and religion in general were about to disintegrate. Initially, Archbishop Wyszyński entered into an agreement with the Communist authorities, which was signed on 14 February 1950 by the Polish episcopate and the government. The Agreement regulated the matters of the Church in Poland. However, in May of that year, the Sejm breached the Agreement by passing a law for the confiscation of Church property.

On 12 January 1953, Wyszyński was elevated to the rank of cardinal by Pius XII as another wave of persecution began in Poland. When the bishops voiced their opposition to state interference in ecclesiastical appointments, mass trials and the internment of priests beganthe cardinal being one of its victims. On 25 September 1953 he was imprisoned at Grudziądz, and later placed under house arrest in monasteries in Prudnik near Opole and in Komańcza Monastery in the Bieszczady Mountains. He was released on 26 October 1956.

Pope John Paul II, who was born in Poland as Karol Wojtyla, often cited the persecution of Polish Catholics in his stance against Communism.

===Spain===
Anti-clericalism in Spain at the start of the Spanish Civil War resulted in the killing of almost 7,000 clergy, the destruction of hundreds of churches and the persecution of lay people in Spain&#x27;s Red Terror. Hundreds of Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War have been beatified and hundreds more in October 2007.

==In mixed Catholic-Protestant countries==
===Switzerland===
The Jesuits (Societas Jesu) were banned from all activities in either clerical or pedagogical functions by Article 51 of the Swiss constitution in 1848. The reason for the ban was the perceived threat to the stability of the state resulting from Jesuit advocacy of traditional Catholicism; it followed the Roman Catholic cantons forming an unconstitutional &quot;separate alliance&quot; leading to civil war. In June 1973, 55% of Swiss voters approved removing the ban on the Jesuits (as well as Article 52 which banned monasteries and convents from Switzerland). (See &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; and &quot;Religion in Switzerland&quot;)

== In primarily Orthodox countries ==

=== Byzantine Empire ===
In the East–West Schism of 1054, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church broke their full communion with each other because of Ecclesiastical differences, Theological, and Liturgical disputes.

In April 1182, the Eastern Orthodox population of the Byzantine Empire committed a large-scale massacre against the Catholic population of Constantinople, this massacre is known as the Massacre of the Latins and it further worsened relations and increased enmity between Eastern Orthodoxy and Catholicism.

=== Russian Empire ===
During Russian rule, Catholics, primarily Poles and Lithuanians, suffered great persecution not only because of their ethnic-national background, but also for religious reasons. Especially after the uprisings of 1831 and 1863, and within the process of Russification (understanding that there is a strong link between religion and nationality), the tsarist authorities were anxious to promote the conversion of these peoples to the official faith, intervening in public education in those regions (an Orthodox religious education was compulsory) and censoring the actions of the Catholic Church. In particular, attention was focused on the public actions of the Church, such as masses or funerals, because they could serve as the focus of protests against the occupation. Many priests were imprisoned or deported because of their activities in defense of their religion and ethnicity. In the late nineteenth century, however, there was a progressive relaxation of the control of Catholic institutions by the Russian authorities. Additionally, all the Eastern Catholic population was forced to convert to the Orthodox faith, with refusal often being met with violence and even murder, like the martyrs of Pratulin.

===Former Yugoslavia===

During World War II in Yugoslavia, the Chetniks killed an estimated 18,000–32,000 Croats, who were mostly Roman Catholic. The terror tactics against the Croats were, to at least an extent, a reaction to the genocide which the Ustaše committed against the Serbs. Along with mass murder, the Ustashe conducted religious persecution of Serbs that included a policy of forced conversion from Eastern Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism, often with the participation of local Catholic priests. However, the largest Chetnik massacres took place in eastern Bosnia, where they preceded significant Ustashe operations. Croats (and Muslims) who lived in areas that were intended to be parts of Greater Serbia were supposed to be cleansed of non-Serbs, in accordance with Mihailović&#x27;s directive of 20 December 1941. About 300 villages and small towns were destroyed, along with a large number of mosques and Catholic churches. Fifty-two Catholic priests were killed by Chetniks throughout the war. A number of Catholic nuns were also raped and killed, including the killing of several nuns from Goražde in December 1941.

During the war in Croatia, the ICTY determined that ethnic Croats were persecuted on political, racial and religious grounds, as part of a general campaign of killings and forced-removals of Croat civilians. This included the deliberate destruction of religious buildings and monuments. Approximately 450 Catholic churches were destroyed or severely damaged, with another 250 suffering lesser damages. In addition, approximately 151 rectories, 31 monasteries, and 57 cemeteries were destroyed or severely damaged. While another 269 religious buildings were destroyed during the Bosnian War.

===Ukraine===

The Khmelnytsky Uprising in the 17th century has a symbolic meaning in the history of Ukraine&#x27;s relationship with Poland. It ended the Polish Catholic &quot;szlachta&quot;′s domination over the Ukrainian Orthodox population. The insurgency was accompanied by mass atrocities committed by Cossacks against prisoners of war and the civilian population, including Roman Catholic and Ruthenian Uniate clergy.

Attacks on Catholic Poles during the massacres in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia in 1943–1945 were marked with extreme brutality. The UPA&#x27;s actions resulted in up to 100,000 Polish deaths. The Roman Catholic Church suffered huge losses in UPA attacks. According to Norman Davies, &quot;Roman Catholic priests were axed or crucified. Churches were burned with all their parishioners.&quot;

An OUN order from early 1944 stated: 

In the separatist region which is known as the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic, the government has declared that the Russian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate is the state religion in 2014, and Protestant churches have been occupied by paramilitaries. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have lost their property, and their Kingdom Halls have been occupied by rebels in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic, Ukrainian Orthodox, and Protestant clergy have been kidnapped by groups such as the Russian Orthodox Army, and they have also been accused of opposing Russian Orthodox values. Human Rights Watch says that the bodies of several members of the Church of the Transfiguration were found in a mass grave in 2014.

==Non-Christian nations==
===Bangladesh===

On 3 June 2001, nine people were killed by a bomb explosion at a Roman Catholic church in the Gopalganj District.

=== Burkina Faso ===

On May 12, 2019, six Catholics including a priest were killed by gunmen who rode on motorcycles and stormed a church in Dablo during a Sunday morning mass. A day later, on May 13, 2019, four people were killed and a statue of the Virgin Mary was destroyed by armed men in an attack on Catholic parishioners during a religious procession in the remote village of Zimtenga.

===China===

The Daoguang Emperor modified an existing law, making the spread of Catholicism punishable by death.
During the Boxer Rebellion, Catholic missionaries and their families were murdered by Boxer rebels. During the 1905 Tibetan Rebellion, Tibetan rebels murdered Catholics and Tibetan converts.

Since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, all religions including Catholicism only operate under state control. However, many Catholics do not accept State control of the Church and as a result, they worship clandestinely. There has been some rapprochement between the Chinese government and the Vatican.

Chinese Christians have reportedly been persecuted in both official and unsanctioned churches. In 2018, the Associated Press reported that China&#x27;s paramount leader Xi Jinping &quot;is waging the most severe systematic suppression of Christianity in the country since religious freedom was written into the Chinese constitution in 1982&quot;, which has involved &quot;destroying crosses, burning bibles, shutting churches and ordering followers to sign papers renouncing their faith&quot;.

Japanese soldiers murdered the French Canadian Jesuit Catholic priests Armand Lalonde, Alphonse Dubé and Prosper Bernard in Feng County, Jiangsu on 18 March 1943.

Japanese soldiers murdered Catholic priests and monks in January 1939 in Hejian and September 1941 in Yuntaishan. Several figures of Catholic Saints and convents and churches were destroyed by Japanese in Hong Kong.

=== East Timor ===
The Japanese murdered Christians and forced girls into prostitution in Timor and Sumba, desecrating sacred vessels and vestments in churches and using the churches as brothels. Javanese girls were brought as prostitutes by the Japanese to Flores and Buru.

===Japan===

On 5 February 1597 a group of twenty-six Catholics were killed on the orders of Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
During the Tokugawa Shogunate, Japanese Catholics were suppressed, leading to an armed rebellion during the 1630s. After the rebellion was crushed, Catholicism was further suppressed and many Japanese Catholics went underground. Catholicism was not openly restored to Japan until the 1850s.

===Pakistan===

===North Korea===
===South Korea===

Catholic priests and nuns have been arrested and harassed for protesting against the construction of the Jeju Island Naval Base.

===Sri Lanka===
==== Government actions ====
In Sri Lanka, A Buddhist-influenced government took over 600 parish schools in 1960 without compensation and secularized them. Attempts were made by future governments to restore some autonomy.

==== Anti-Catholic violence ====

Since 2000, in a context of rising violence against religious minorities, i.e. Christians, Muslims and Hindus, multiple attacks on Catholic churches occurred. For instance, in 2009, a mob of 1,000 smashed the interior of a church in the town of Crooswatta, assaulting parishioners with clubs, swords and stones, forcing several of them to be treated in hospitals. In 2013, vandals smashed a statue of the Virgin Mary as well as a tabernacle, and they also tried to burn the Eucharist at a church in Angulana, near Colombo.

The term &quot;anti-Catholic Catholic&quot; has come to be applied to Catholics who are perceived to view the Catholic Church with animosity. Traditionalist or conservative Catholics frequently use it as a descriptive term for modernist or liberal Catholics, especially those modernist or liberal Catholics who seek to reform Church doctrine, make secularist critiques of the Catholic Church, or place secular principles above Church teachings. Those who take issue with the Catholic theology of sexuality are especially prone to be given this label.

===Suppression of the Jesuits===

Prime Minister Pombal of Portugal was aggressively hostile to the Jesuit order because it reported to an Italian powerthe Popeand it also tried to operate independently rather than operate under the control of the government. In Portugal as well as in much of Catholic Europe, he waged a full-scale war against the Jesuits. The Jesuit order was suppressed in the Portuguese Empire (1759), France (1764), the Two Sicilies, Malta, Parma, the Spanish Empire (1767), and Austria and Hungary (1782). The Pope himself suppressed the order everywhere in 1773, but it survived in Russia and Prussia. The suppression of the Jesuits was a major blow to Catholic education across Europe, with nearly 1000 secondary schools and seminaries were shut down. Their lands, buildings, and endowments were confiscated; their teachers were scattered. Although Jesuit education had become old fashioned in Poland and other areas, it was the main educational support network for Catholic intellectuals, senior clergy, and prominent families. Governments unsuccessfully attempted to replace all of those schools, but there were far too few non-clerical teachers who were suitable.

The Jesuit order was restored by the pope in 1814 and it flourished in terms of rebuilding schools and educational institutions but it never regained its enormous political power. The suppression of the Jesuits has been described as &quot;an unmitigated disaster for Catholicism.&quot; The political weakness of the once-powerful institution was on public display for more ridicule and bullying. The Church lost its best educational system, its best missionary system, and its most innovative thinkers. Intellectually, it would take two centuries for the Church to fully recover.

==In popular culture==

Anti-Catholic stereotypes are a long-standing feature of English literature, popular fiction, and pornography. Gothic fiction is particularly rich in this regard. Lustful priests, cruel abbesses, immured nuns, and sadistic inquisitors appear in such works as &quot;The Italian&quot; by Ann Radcliffe, &quot;The Monk&quot; by Matthew Lewis, &quot;Melmoth the Wanderer&quot; by Charles Maturin and &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe. Additionally, priests, clergymen, and even regular Catholic laity are oftentimes portrayed as pedophiles in media, due to the sex abuse scandals within the church in recent times.

<text>Lough Swilly () in Ireland is a glacial fjord or sea inlet lying between the western side of the Inishowen Peninsula and the Fanad Peninsula, in County Donegal. Along with Carlingford Lough and Killary Harbour it is one of three glacial fjords in Ireland.

==Name==

Both Lough Swilly () and the adjoining River Swilly () have the same derivation, and are sometimes associated with a legendary multi-eyed sea monster, &quot;Suileach&quot;, that was reputedly killed by Saint Colmcille (521–597). In &quot;The Origin and History of Irish Names of Places&quot; (1900), the historian Patrick Weston Joyce writes that &quot;súil&quot; may refer to whirlpools or to eyes and that &quot;suileach&quot; means &quot;abounding in eyes or whirlpools&quot;.

==Geography and ecology==
Located on the Fanad Peninsula, in County Donegal, the northern extremities of the lough are marked by Fanad Head with its lighthouse and Dunaff Head. Towns situated on the lough include Buncrana on Inishowen and Rathmullan on the western side. At the southern end of the lough lies Letterkenny.

In the south of the lough a number of islands (Burt, Inch, Coney, Big Isle) were poldered and the land reclaimed during the 19th century for agriculture and the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway constructed embankments on the line from Derry to Letterkenny. These reclaimed lands are now wetlands associated with wildlife conservation and birdwatching, and support over 4,000 whooper swans and thousands of Greenland white front, barnacle, greylag and brent geese.

The lough is known for its wildlife-watching (dolphins, porpoise, seabirds, migratory geese and swans) and diving on a number of ship wrecks, including sunk by a German mine (possible torpedo), which went down with 3,211 ingots of gold of which 3,191 were recovered.

==History==
The lough, and the Grianán Ailigh hill fort (early fortification and palace dating from 2000 to 5000 BC) at its southeastern bend, were recorded on Ptolemy&#x27;s map of the world. It has a number of early Stone Age monuments and Iron Age fortifications along its shores, as well as a number of shell middens dated to approximately 7000 BC.

Swilly was the departure point for the &#x27;Flight of the Earls&#x27; in 1607. This event, which followed a failed uprising in September 1607, saw Hugh O&#x27;Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone, and Rory O&#x27;Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell (the last Gaelic chieftains in Ireland at that time), set sail from Rathmullan with ninety of their followers.

During a gale on 4 December 1811, the Royal Navy 36-gun was shipwrecked in Lough Swilly. There were no survivors out of the estimated 253 aboard, with approximately 200 bodies washed up on shore.
Due to its natural shelter and its depth, the lough was an important naval port. In October 1798, immediately prior to the outbreak of the Napoleonic wars, a French fleet carrying Wolfe Tone of the United Irishmen, plus troops to assist in 1798 rebellion, was intercepted and defeated in a naval battle at the entrance to Lough Swilly. Subsequently, Tone was captured and taken ashore at Buncrana on the east side of the Swilly.

A subsequent reassessment of the threat of invasion led to the building of a series of fortifications guarding the different approaches and landing points within the lough which were completed between 1800 and 1820. Martello towers were built around 1804 to defend the approaches to Derry. The six on the lough cost €1,800 each, were armed with smoothbore cannon, firing round shot and were completed in six months. Immediately prior to World War I the War Office improved the Napoleonic forts and their armaments as well as adding another fort at the entrance to the lough at Lenan Head with guns (12-mile range) – the largest in Ireland at the time. The remains of these fortifications are still at Lenan Head Fort, Fort Dunree (now a military and wildlife museum), Ned&#x27;s Point, Buncrana, Inch Fort and on the west coast at Rathmullan, Knockalla and Macamish Point.

During the First World War, the lough was used by the Royal Navy as an anchorage for elements of the Grand Fleet, an amalgamation of the pre-war Home and Atlantic Fleets, under Admiral Sir John R. Jellicoe and a gathering/staging point for Atlantic convoys. During this period a boom was placed across the lough between Macamish Point and Ned&#x27;s Point, supported by a number of trawlers, to prevent U-boat attacks. After the Irish War of Independence the lough was also one of the Treaty Ports specified in the Anglo-Irish Treaty until its final handing over at Fort Dunree in 1938.

According to exhibits at Fort Dunree, during World War II Irish troops operated the guns there with explicit instructions to fire at any ship that might threaten Irish neutrality by entering the natural harbour. On one occasion in this period, a Royal Navy ship entered the lough and – while it did not initially respond to signals that it should turn back – left the area without any action being taken.

The trains of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway served the area around Lough Swilly until 1953, when the company&#x27;s trains were replaced by buses. These operated until 2014, when the company was closed down and liquidated.

<text>Statistical learning theory is a framework for machine learning drawing from the fields of statistics and functional analysis. Statistical learning theory deals with the statistical inference problem of finding a predictive function based on data. Statistical learning theory has led to successful applications in fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, and bioinformatics.

==Introduction==
The goals of learning are understanding and prediction. Learning falls into many categories, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, online learning, and reinforcement learning. From the perspective of statistical learning theory, supervised learning is best understood. Supervised learning involves learning from a training set of data. Every point in the training is an input–output pair, where the input maps to an output. The learning problem consists of inferring the function that maps between the input and the output, such that the learned function can be used to predict the output from future input.

Depending on the type of output, supervised learning problems are either problems of regression or problems of classification. If the output takes a continuous range of values, it is a regression problem. Using Ohm&#x27;s law as an example, a regression could be performed with voltage as input and current as an output. The regression would find the functional relationship between voltage and current to be such that
formula_1
Classification problems are those for which the output will be an element from a discrete set of labels. Classification is very common for machine learning applications. In facial recognition, for instance, a picture of a person&#x27;s face would be the input, and the output label would be that person&#x27;s name. The input would be represented by a large multidimensional vector whose elements represent pixels in the picture.

After learning a function based on the training set data, that function is validated on a test set of data, data that did not appear in the training set.

==Formal description==
Take formula_2 to be the vector space of all possible inputs, and formula_3 to be the vector space of all possible outputs. Statistical learning theory takes the perspective that there is some unknown probability distribution over the product space formula_4, i.e. there exists some unknown formula_5. The training set is made up of formula_6 samples from this probability distribution, and is notated 
formula_7
Every formula_8 is an input vector from the training data, and formula_9 is the output that corresponds to it.

In this formalism, the inference problem consists of finding a function formula_10 such that formula_11. Let formula_12 be a space of functions formula_10 called the hypothesis space. The hypothesis space is the space of functions the algorithm will search through. Let formula_14 be the loss function, a metric for the difference between the predicted value formula_15 and the actual value formula_16. The expected risk is defined to be
formula_17
The target function, the best possible function formula_18 that can be chosen, is given by the formula_18 that satisfies
formula_20

Because the probability distribution formula_21 is unknown, a proxy measure for the expected risk must be used. This measure is based on the training set, a sample from this unknown probability distribution. It is called the empirical risk
formula_22
A learning algorithm that chooses the function formula_23 that minimizes the empirical risk is called empirical risk minimization.

==Loss functions==
The choice of loss function is a determining factor on the function formula_23 that will be chosen by the learning algorithm. The loss function also affects the convergence rate for an algorithm. It is important for the loss function to be convex.

Different loss functions are used depending on whether the problem is one of regression or one of classification.

===Regression===
The most common loss function for regression is the square loss function (also known as the L2-norm). This familiar loss function is used in Ordinary Least Squares regression. The form is:
formula_25

The absolute value loss (also known as the L1-norm) is also sometimes used:
formula_26

===Classification===

In some sense the 0-1 indicator function is the most natural loss function for classification. It takes the value 0 if the predicted output is the same as the actual output, and it takes the value 1 if the predicted output is different from the actual output. For binary classification with formula_27, this is:
formula_28
where formula_29 is the Heaviside step function.

==Regularization==
In machine learning problems, a major problem that arises is that of overfitting. Because learning is a prediction problem, the goal is not to find a function that most closely fits the (previously observed) data, but to find one that will most accurately predict output from future input. Empirical risk minimization runs this risk of overfitting: finding a function that matches the data exactly but does not predict future output well.

Overfitting is symptomatic of unstable solutions; a small perturbation in the training set data would cause a large variation in the learned function. It can be shown that if the stability for the solution can be guaranteed, generalization and consistency are guaranteed as well. Regularization can solve the overfitting problem and give the problem stability.

Regularization can be accomplished by restricting the hypothesis space formula_12. A common example would be restricting formula_12 to linear functions: this can be seen as a reduction to the standard problem of linear regression. formula_12 could also be restricted to polynomial of degree formula_33, exponentials, or bounded functions on L1. Restriction of the hypothesis space avoids overfitting because the form of the potential functions are limited, and so does not allow for the choice of a function that gives empirical risk arbitrarily close to zero.

One example of regularization is Tikhonov regularization. This consists of minimizing
formula_34
where formula_35 is a fixed and positive parameter, the regularization parameter. Tikhonov regularization ensures existence, uniqueness, and stability of the solution.
==Bounding empirical risk==
Consider a binary classifier formula_36. We can apply Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality to bound the probability that the empirical risk deviates from the true risk to be a Sub-Gaussian distribution. 
formula_37
But generally, when we do empirical risk minimization, we are not given a classifier; we must choose it. Therefore, a more useful result is to bound the probability of the supremum of the difference over the whole class. 
formula_38
where formula_39 is the shattering number and formula_6 is the number of samples in your dataset. The exponential term comes from Hoeffding but there is an extra cost of taking the supremum over the whole class, which is the shattering number.

<text>Lough Foyle, sometimes Loch Foyle ( or &quot;loch of the lip&quot;), is the estuary of the River Foyle, on the north coast of Ireland. It lies between County Londonderry in Northern Ireland and County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland. Sovereignty over the waters has been in dispute since the Partition of Ireland.

==Flora and fauna==
===Flora===
A survey of Lough Foyle was made between March 1937 and June 1939 by Helen Blackler. In this, a map shows the distribution of certain species of algae in the lough and a full annotated list of the algae recorded along with photographs of the different sites. The list included: Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae, Rhodophyceae, lichens and two species of &quot;Zostera&quot;. The marine algae of Lough Foyle are also included in Morton (2003).

===Fauna===
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has a reserve at the lough.

==Transport==
In 1792 the four-mile Strabane Canal was constructed from the tidal waters of Lough Foyle at Leck, to Strabane. The canal fell into disuse in 1962. In June 2006 the Strabane Lifford Development Commission awarded a £1.3m cross-border waterways restoration contract. The project involves the restoration of one and a half miles of canal and two locks to working order. Work began on the Lough Foyle side of the canal in the summer of 2006, but by 2010 the partial restoration was deemed unsatisfactory and the local council refused to continue to maintain the canal. The Broharris Canal was constructed in the 1820s when a cut – some two miles long on the south shore of Lough Foyle near Ballykelly – was made in the direction of Limavady. It served both as a drainage channel and a navigation, with goods being brought from the Londonderry Port, and shellfish and kelp from the sandbanks along the shore.

In the summertime, a ferry service operates between Greencastle and Magilligan across Lough Foyle.

===Railway travel===
NI Railways runs from Derry~Londonderry railway station along the scenic shore of Lough Foyle – with views of Inishowen in County Donegal as well as the Atlantic Ocean – via Coleraine to Belfast Lanyon Place and Belfast Grand Central. The strategically important Belfast–Derry railway line is to be upgraded to facilitate more frequent trains and improvements to the permanent way, such as track and signalling to enable faster services.

From Londonderry railway station the next stop is Bellarena followed by Castlerock then Coleraine en route to Belfast. Walkers alighting from trains arriving at Castlerock can walk to Mussenden Temple owned by the National Trust and can see the mouth of Lough Foyle and Greencastle some distance away in County Donegal.

==Literature==
The main character of Alfred Bester&#x27;s famous science-fiction novel, &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot;, is named Gulliver Foyle. Bester took the names of his characters from various locations in Ireland and Great Britain.

==First World War==
The United States Navy established the Naval Air Station Lough Foyle on the Inishowen side of the lough on 1 July 1918 to operate seaplanes during the First World War. The base closed shortly after the First Armistice at Compiègne.

==Second World War==
At the end of the Second World War, after the Allied victory, the remainder of the German Atlantic fleet of U-boats used to attack supply lines from North America to Britain during the Battle of the Atlantic were assembled in Lough Foyle and scuttled – as part of Operation Deadlight.

==Disputed status==
Lough Foyle is a disputed territory between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom; after the Partition of Ireland in the early 1920s, each side claimed that it was in their own territory. Although this dispute is still ongoing, there are currently no negotiations as to its ownership.

The UK&#x27;s Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) underlined its view on 2 June 2009 that all of Lough Foyle is in the United Kingdom, a spokesperson stating:
&#x27;The UK position is that the whole of Lough Foyle is within the UK. We recognise that the Irish Government does not accept this position...There are no negotiations currently in progress on this issue. The regulation of activities in the Lough is now the responsibility of the Loughs Agency, a cross-border body established under the Good Friday Agreement.&#x27;

In November 2016, James Brokenshire, MP, the UK&#x27;s Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, reiterated the UK&#x27;s view that all of Lough Foyle is in the UK, whilst Charles Flanagan, TD, the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s Minister for Foreign Affairs, stated that the Republic of Ireland did not recognise Britain&#x27;s claim to the entirety of Lough Foyle.

<text>Lanny Mark Poffo (December 28, 1954 – February 2, 2023) better known by his ring names &quot;Leaping&quot; Lanny Poffo and the Genius, was a Canadian-American professional wrestler, motivational speaker, poet, and actor. Poffo was a second generation professional wrestler, his father being Angelo Poffo. His brother Macho Man Randy Savage was also a professional wrestler.

== Early life ==
Poffo was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to Angelo Poffo, an Italian American Catholic, and Judy (Sverdlin) Poffo, a Jewish-American of Belarusian and Lithuanian descent. He was the younger brother of &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage and grew up in Downers Grove, Illinois.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1974–1979) ===
Poffo made his debut in 1974, losing to Wayne Cowan in the opening match of an All-South Wrestling Alliance card held in Atlanta, Georgia, on April 16. Poffo remained in the promotion for several months, defeating Cowan in a rematch and also gaining a win over The Great Fuji. On a card on July 9, 1974, in Atlanta he teamed with his father Angelo Poffo for the first time, defeating the veteran team The Royal Kangaroos.

Still in his rookie year, Poffo and his father then headed to Big Time Wrestling, one of the varied promotions affiliated with the National Wrestling Alliance at that time. In their initial match with BTW, Lanny and Angelo lost by disqualification to Lou Thesz and Mighty Igor on November 30, 1974, at a house show in Detroit, Michigan. They quickly began a house show series against the team of Bobo Brazil and Fred Curry. The two wrestled as heels, with Angelo Poffo wearing a graduation gown and cap similar to the attire Lanny later adopted in the WWF. That year they won the NWA World Tag Team Championship, and the father/son duo held it until 1975 with successful defenses over The Mongols and Brazil and Curry. While still tag-team champions, the Poffos moved on to the St. Louis Wrestling Club and continued to defend their championship. In 1975 they lost the title and returned to Big Time Wrestling.

1976 found Lanny wrestling primarily in singles matches in BTW, NWA Western States, and the St. Louis Wrestling Club. On May 29, 1976, Lanny received his first shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, losing a televised match to Terry Funk on &quot;Wrestling at the Chase&quot;. He then defeated wrestlers such as Don Red Cloud, Raoul Guzman, and Gary Fulton. Lanny moved to Jim Crockett&#x27;s Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling in July 1976, and for the first time began teaming with his brother Randy Poffo (Randy Savage). The Poffo Brothers immediately began touring on the MACW house show circuit, defeating such teams as Johnny Eagle and Manuel Soto or Danny Miller and Johnny Weaver for the remainder of the year.

With his brother Randy having departed MACW after February, Lanny proceeded into 1977 as a singles wrestler once more. After gaining victories over George Rossi, Herb Gallant, and Leroy Rochester, Poffo gained another shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship when he faced off against Harley Race at an event in Chattanooga on February 4, 1978. This time Lanny wrestled the champion to a draw.

In April 1978, Poffo moved on to Emile Duprée&#x27;s Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling which had a weekly television spot on the Maritime region&#x27;s CTV-affiliated ATV system and toured the Maritimes doing shows seven days per week with some days hosting two shows in two different towns. That year, he became the first ever AGPW International Heavyweight Champion. On May 23, 1978, he wrestled his brother (now known as Randy Savage) for the very first time, defeating him by disqualification at an event held in Truro, Nova Scotia. Savage later defeated his brother for the title, which they traded in 1978 and 1979. On July 18, 1978, their final title match ended in a draw at a show in Hartland, New Brunswick.

Poffo next moved to NWA affiliate Pacific Northwest Wrestling and made his debut on November 16, 1979, when he wrestled Kurt von Steiger to a draw at an event in Portland, Oregon. He faced a variety of opponents in PNW, including Adrian Adonis, Hiro Ota, and Tully Blanchard. On February 22, 1979, he unsuccessfully challenged NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Champion Roddy Piper. Following a defeat to Gene Kiniski the next month, he departed the promotion.

===International Championship Wrestling (1979–1984)===
In 1978, Lanny&#x27;s father Angelo founded International Championship Wrestling (ICW), an &quot;outlaw&quot; rival to NWA affiliates Southeastern Championship Wrestling and NWA Mid-America. Eventually Angelo further expanded and signed talent away from the World Wrestling Association and Jerry Jarrett&#x27;s Continental Wrestling Association (CWA), forming a strong rivalry with the other territories. It was into the maelstrom that Lanny Poffo entered in the summer of 1979 as he jumped to his father&#x27;s promotion. He became a star in ICW and eventually became the promotion&#x27;s champion, where he wrestled with and against Randy Savage. The two brothers dominated the ICW Heavyweight Championship, and over the next six years, the only other wrestler to hold it was Paul Christy. Lanny remained a mainstay of the promotion until it folded in 1984.

===Mid-South Wrestling (1984)===
Shortly before the dissolution of ICW, Lanny began making appearances in Bill Watts&#x27; Mid-South Wrestling. His first matches came on October 12, 1983, when he defeated Art Crews and Doug Vines at a MSW television taping in Shreveport. In December he formed a team with Rick Rude and began a house show series with The Midnight Express that carried through January 1984. Lanny then moved back into singles competition and wrestled Buddy Landel in numerous matches.

===Continental Wrestling Association (1984–1985)===
On June 18, 1984, Lanny joined his brother Randy Savage who had jumped to the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA), defeating Bart Batten and Johnny Wilhoit at an event in Memphis. They almost immediately entered into a feud with The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express, a series that lasted throughout the summer. On October 1, 1984, he unsuccessfully challenged CWA International Heavyweight Champion Eddie Gilbert. That winter Poffo and Savage moved on to a house show series against Gilbert and Tommy Rich. In January 1985, they entered a tournament to crown the AWA Southern Tag-Team Champions, but were defeated by The Interns in the semi-finals. In the spring, they began a feud with AWA Southern Champions The Fabulous Ones, but were unable to capture the title. In June 1985, his brother departed for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), and Lanny was soon signed to a contract there as well.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1985–1992) ===

==== &quot;Leaping&quot; Lanny Poffo (1985–1989) ====
Poffo debuted in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) on June 21, 1985 at Madison Square Garden defeating Terry Gibbs. Although both Poffo brothers joined the WWF at the same point, their relationship was never acknowledged by the promotion. While Lanny was not a headlining WWF star like his brother, he initially built a niche for himself wrestling as a babyface. In his first role as &quot;Leaping&quot; Lanny Poffo, he would bring frisbees to the ring, read a short poem written on one of them that he himself had penned, and then throw the frisbees into the crowd. Each poem typically ridiculed the heel whom he was about to wrestle, or built heat in favor of the face with whom the heel was feuding at the time.

Lanny was initially undefeated in the WWF, defeating opponents such as Mr. X, Rene Goulet, Terry Gibbs, Barry O, and Moondog Spot. He suffered his first defeat on July 27 edition of Championship Wrestling, teaming with Keith Diamond in a loss to The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff. This presages a series of losses to Jesse Ventura, Big John Studd, and The Missing Link. During his early career in the WWF, he was not a main-eventer and wrestled primarily as enhancement talent on television shows. Rather than being squashed like most jobbers at the time, he displayed a greater amount of offense in his matches. He found great success on house shows, where he continued to defeat other undercard wrestlers. Poffo performed an agile, athletic, high-flying style at a time when big, heavy power wrestlers still dominated the promotion. He was one of the first wrestlers in North America to use moves like the Senton Bomb and the moonsault, though commentators of the time referred to the latter as a &quot;leaping backflip&quot;.

He made his first Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event appearance on October 5, 1985, when he recited a poem at the wedding of Uncle Elmer. Entering 1986, he continued to be highly competitive against lower-level opposition, reeling off house show or televised victories over Terry Gibbs, Barry O, Rene Goulet, Tiger Chung Lee and S. D. Jones, between losses to Hercules, and Jim Neidhart. Lanny attained some infamy in late 1986 and early 1987 by competing in a series of Bunkhouse Battle Royals in full knight&#x27;s armor. He also is noted for competing in a Battle Royal on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event X&quot; at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit in 1987, where he was headbutted and eliminated by André the Giant, causing him to bleed heavily all over the floor and have to be carried out on a stretcher. André, in his first televised match as a heel, had accidentally caught Poffo on the bridge of the nose with his headbutt and stitches were required to close the resulting wound.

In February 1987, he participated in another famous angle, teaming with The Can-Am Connection in a six-man tag team match against &quot;Adorable&quot; Adrian Adonis and The Dream Team. During the match, Adonis accidentally cut the hair of Brutus Beefcake, leading to the latter&#x27;s face turn and assumption of &quot;The Barber&quot; gimmick. Poffo and the Can-Ams won this WWF Superstars of Wrestling match by pinfall.

In January 1988, Lanny defeated Sika the Savage Samoan on a series of upsets, and during the following month he began a lengthy house show series with the newly heel-turned Dan Spivey. Poffo continued to receive a strong push against lower-level competition like Barry Horowitz, but was unable to break through as a top tier member of the roster. He entered a house show series with Jim Neidhart following the temporary dissolution of The Hart Foundation, but was unsuccessful in these contests. His fortunes changed somewhat later in the summer when he feuded with &quot;Dangerous&quot; Danny Davis on the house show circuit, pinning Davis on multiple occasions. Entering the fall of 1988 he faced numerous preliminary opponents and embarked on a lengthy winning streak, defeating Barry Horowitz, Sandy Beach, and George Skaaland. He continued to compete against opening card talent for the remainder of the year and was largely successful.

Poffo began 1989 with a loss to Iron Mike Sharpe at a house show on January 1 in West Palm Beach, Florida, and this was followed by a televised defeat on January 13 in Boston to The Brooklyn Brawler. After a smattering of wins, he then lost to Conquistador No. 1 on February 20, 1989, in Worcester, MA. These were followed by a pair of defeats to Tim Horner in March 1989.

==== The Genius (1989–1992) ====
On March 18, 1989, Poffo turned heel. He berated the local Boston sports teams, insulting them in his poetry, and instantly drew heat from the Boston crowd. He was subsequently reintroduced as &quot;The Genius&quot;, a highly intelligent, arrogant heel who wore an academic cap and gown to the ring. After weeks of giving poetry as The Genius, he had his debut against Sonny Rodgers and defeated him. His poems now ridiculed the face wrestlers, and he adopted an exaggerated effeminate, showboating manner, similar to that employed by Gorgeous George, to draw heat from the crowd. He began a house show series against Jim Powers that spring and embarked on a lengthy winning streak. That summer he moved on to feud with Powers&#x27; former The Young Stallions partner Paul Roma and was also victorious. His first pinfall loss under his new heel persona came on August 12, to Koko B. Ware at a house show in Richfield, Ohio.

The Genius was featured on WWF Superstars during the coronation of Randy Savage as the new &quot;King of the WWF&quot;; Lanny read the proclamation for his real-life brother. He continued to win in his house show series with Koko B Ware and at the same time began to serve as &quot;executive consultant&quot; (and occasional tag team partner) for Mr. Perfect.

On November 5, 1989 at &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXIV&quot;, The Genius faced WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan and spent much of the match taunting Hogan and drawing heat from the crowd with his absurd antics. Several minutes into the match, Mr. Perfect appeared at ringside where he goaded Hogan and defaced the championship belt by sticking chewing gum on it. During the match, Hogan tossed The Genius outside the ring, subsequently Mr. Perfect attended to the Genius. Hogan followed him outside the ring, and then threw The Genius back into the ring. With Hogan&#x27;s back to Mr. Perfect and the referee was distracted, Mr. Perfect struck him with the championship belt and putting him down for the count out. Later in the show, Mr. Perfect and The Genius destroyed the stolen belt with a hammer. This was the first time in 21 months (since a loss to André the Giant at The Main Event) that Hogan lost on WWF television.

The Genius had his first televised defeat when he teamed with Mr. Perfect against WWF World Champion Hulk Hogan and Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior on the January 29, 1990 episode of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;. That winter he entered a house show series against Jim Neidhart and was generally victorious here as well. He made his first PPV appearance at the 1990 Royal Rumble and wrestled Brutus Beefcake to a double disqualification after &quot;The Barber&quot; began cutting his hair and Hennig interfered.

In March, The Genius lost at house shows to Jim Neidhart. He also teamed with Hennig in losing efforts against Hulk Hogan and various partners. At WrestleMania VI, he had his hair cut by Brutus Beefcake after Mr. Perfect was pinned. Shortly after WrestleMania VI, Bobby Heenan became Mr. Perfect&#x27;s manager. The Genius then feuded with Brutus Beefcake and took to wearing wigs and amateur wrestling headgear to cover the haircut that &quot;The Barber&quot; had given him.

By the summer of 1990, The Genius had lost his feud with Beefcake and started to move back down the card. In June he renewed his house show series with Koko B. Ware; this time, &quot;The Birdman&quot; dominated on shows around the country. The feud continued through the summer and achieved national visibility on the August 27, 1990, edition of Prime Time, where Ware defeated The Genius on television. Poffo made a guest appearance on the October 13, 1990, episode of Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXVIII, participating in Oktoberfest activities along with The Hart Foundation, 
Jim Duggan, Mr. Fuji, and The Orient Express. That winter he engaged in opening match contests with Dustin Rhodes, Shane Douglas and Jim Brunzell.

After being on sabbatical for several months, The Genius returned in April 1991, wrestling Greg Valentine, Jim Duggan, and Bret Hart. He also participated in the joint WWF/SWS tour and faced Jim Powers on each show. On June 26, 1991, he scored a major upset victory in his comeback when he defeated Jim Duggan at a house show in Lansing, MI. On the September 7, 1991, edition of WWF Superstars he became the manager of The Beverly Brothers (Mike Enos and Wayne Bloom). Unlike during his time as Mr. Perfect&#x27;s manager, he generally remained on the sidelines for much of the remainder of 1991 and wrestled very sporadically.

In December 1991, The Genius teamed with The Beverly Brothers in six-man matches against The Bushwhackers and Jim Neidhart. In the 1992 Royal Rumble, he managed The Beverly Brothers to a win over The Bushwhackers. He also continued to occasionally wrestle, and picked up a televised win over Brian Costello on the July 6 episode of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot; and wrestled house show matches against Jim Brunzell, Virgil, and Bob Bradley. On the August 28 episode, he teamed with the Beverly Brothers in an unsuccessful effort against The Legion of Doom and Paul Ellering. At SummerSlam 92, the Beverlys lost to The Natural Disasters in a WWF Tag Team Championship. He continued to manage them until the 1992 Survivor Series before being released in December 1992.

=== Hiatus and return (1993–1994) ===
After a six-month break, Poffo returned to action in June 1993 and joined World Wrestling Superstars on a tour of Germany where he was matched against Demolition Ax. He worked later that year for the International Championship Wrestling Alliance and wrestled Manny Fernandez, Jeff Bradley, and Brutus Beefcake. In December 1993 he appeared for Anvil Promotions and Johnny West, B. Brian Blair, and Al Hardimon. On March 12, 1994, he traveled to Brantford, Connecticut, to face The Warlord.

After a nineteen-month absence from the WWF, Poffo returned in May 1994, defeating Koko B. Ware on two house shows in Florida. His final WWF match was a loss to Mabel on June 11 at an event in Richmond, Virginia.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1995–1999) ===
Poffo signed a WCW contract in 1995, but may have wrestled only once during his time there (two sites record him as having defeated a preliminary wrestler in a dark match at a WCW Saturday Night taping on October 14, 1997, in Fort Myers, Florida). In a later shoot interview, Poffo explained that he was contacted by his brother (Randy Savage), who was wrestling in WCW at the time, with the guarantee of a contract. Savage, who had purchased the Gorgeous George gimmick, offered the character to Poffo, feeling that his brother would generate heat as a heel. Poffo signed the contract with WCW, began an intense training regimen, and bleached his hair blonde in preparation for his return to the ring. As he recalled, despite being under contract for five years and receiving regular paychecks, he was never contacted with any bookings. His own repeated calls to the office went unreturned, and he was simply never used by WCW. Ultimately, Savage gave the Gorgeous George moniker to his then-girlfriend and valet Stephanie Bellars.

=== Later career (2000–2020) ===
After a six-year sabbatical from professional wrestling, Poffo returned to be a part of Wrestle Reunion in Tampa, Florida, on January 28–30, 2005, and defeated &quot;The Royal Stud&quot; Adam Windsor at that event.

He also wrestled in Canada as part of the Supershow later known as Great North Wrestling from 2007 to 2008 in Ottawa, Pembroke and Hawkesbury, Ontario. Later Great North worked in Thunder Bay in 2009 and New Brunswick in fall of 2010. Sometimes Poffo teamed with The Honky Tonk Man and feuded with Hannibal.

Poffo has toured the East Coast of Canada with UCW, wrestling in Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. After that tour, Poffo also wrestled in Poland and Florida, as well as a show in England.

On September 3, 2011, Poffo won a 25-man battle royal for the vacated Great North Wrestling Canadian Championship in Hawkesbury, Ontario. He dropped to title to Jeremy Prophet three weeks later in Perth-Andover, New Brunswick.

On May 6, 2012, in Reading, Pennsylvania, Poffo teamed with JD Smooth for a disqualification loss to &quot;Pretty Ugly&quot; in Regional Championship Wrestling&#x27;s Rumblemania 8.

On March 28, 2015, Poffo returned to WWE at the 2015 Hall of Fame induction ceremony to induct his late brother, Randy Savage. He read poems and shared memories of Savage, before representing him the next day with the other inductees at WrestleMania 31

On September 1, 2018, Poffo appeared at All In in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, accompanying &quot;Black Machismo&quot; Jay Lethal as Lethal successfully defended the ROH World Championship against Flip Gordon. Lanny also appeared on ROH telecasts announcing the action, doing commentary from ringside using his extended vocabulary that he made famous during his Leaping Lanny days of the past.

Poffo wrestled his last match on March 5, 2020, at The Reena Rumble in Toronto, alongside wrestlers Papa Shango, Virgil, Brooklyn Brawler and local stars The Megan Boys Buck Gunderson and Mysterion the mind reader.

==Personal life and death==
Poffo was married and had a daughter named Meghan from whom he had grandchildren.

Poffo began living in Ecuador in October 2020.

Outside wrestling, Poffo published two books. One is a collection of poems and limericks, most of which were related to drug and alcohol awareness, directed toward young children. Poffo was a vocal opponent of tobacco smoking and also published an anti-smoking book of limericks entitled &quot;Limericks from the Heart and Lungs!&quot; He appeared in infomercials as an endorser of Tony Little&#x27;s Gazelle Freestyle exercise machine, and was a certified credit counselor and motivational speaker.

In March 2013, Poffo played a K9 police officer in the Investigation Discovery network&#x27;s &quot;I (Almost) Got Away With It&quot;.

In 2018, Poffo released a biographical comic through Squared Circle Comics, titled &quot;The Genius Lanny Poffo&quot;. 

On September 3, 2018, Poffo, alongside JP Zarka of ProWrestlingStories.com, launched a weekly podcast titled &quot;The Genius Cast with Lanny Poffo&quot;. The podcast featured 20 episodes, and ended its run on January 21, 2019.
===Death===
On February 2, 2023, Jim Duggan, a longtime personal friend of the Poffo family, revealed that Poffo had died in New York City at the age of 68. Dave Meltzer revealed the cause of death to be heart failure.

<text>Clew Bay (; ) is a large ocean bay on the Atlantic coast of County Mayo, Ireland. It is roughly rectangular and has more than a hundred small islands on its landward side; Ireland&#x27;s best example of sunken drumlins. The larger Clare Island guards the entrance of the bay.

The bay is overlooked by Croagh Patrick to the south and the Nephin Beg Mountains to the north. From the southwest part of the bay eastwards are the settlements Louisburgh, Lecanvey, Murrisk, and Westport; north of Westport is Newport, and westwards from there lies Mulranny, gateway to Achill.

== History ==

The bay was historically known in Irish as &quot;Cuan Mod&quot; (&quot;harbour of Mod&quot;) or &quot;Modlind&quot; (&quot;pool of Mod&quot;), and was associated with the Fir Bolg. This later became &quot;Cuan Modha&quot;. Some writers claim that this name derives from Modh, one of the Tuatha Dé Danann. Another possibility is the Old Irish &quot;mod&quot;, &quot;moth&quot;, which meant &quot;penis&quot; or &quot;man&quot;.

Another old name is &quot;Cuan Umhaill&quot; (&quot;harbour of Umhaill&quot;). It was rendered in English as &quot;Bay of the Owly&quot; and &quot;Bay of the Owles.&quot; Other English names were the Bay of Borace, Horrus, and Baragh, all references to Burrishoole (&quot;Buiríos Umhaill&quot;). The name &#x27;Clew Bay&#x27;, of uncertain origin, first appears in a 1714 map; it may be derived from &quot;cliath&quot;, &quot;hurdle&quot;.

Clew Bay was the heart of the Gaelic territory of Umhaill, ruled by the Uí Máille (O&#x27;Malleys). Umhaill&#x27;s last and most famous ruler was Grace O&#x27;Malley (Gráinne Ní Mháille), nicknamed &quot;the pirate queen&quot;. The O&#x27;Malleys had a fleet of ships and several castles around Clew Bay, including Carrickkildavnet Castle, Carrickahowley Castle and Granuaile&#x27;s Castle.

During the Irish Civil War in July 1922, 400 Free State troops were landed at Clew Bay to take Westport and Castlebar from Anti-Treaty forces.

In 2024, the discovery of a submerged late Bronze Age fort from the depths of Clew Bay was announced by a team from Connemara and Mayo County Council. 

== Inishgort Lighthouse ==
Inishgort Lighthouse stands on the island of Inishgort, from Murrisk.

== Fish farming in Clew Bay ==
In recent years there has been controversy over fish-farming in the bay. &quot;The Organic Salmon Company&quot; (now owned by Mowi) is based in Clare Island.

==Islands of Clew Bay==

The bay is also home to Dorinish, a private island purchased by John Lennon in 1967. Glenans Ireland, a non-profit sailing school, had a branch on Collanmore Island where sailing was taught.

Legend has it that Clew Bay has 365 islands in it—&quot;an island for every day of the year&quot;. The large number of drumlins at the east end of the bay gave rise to this myth, but in fact there are not so many.

<doc id="1053316" wikidata="Q551668" url="?curid=1053316" title="Gaius Licinius Macer Calvus">
<text>Gaius Licinius Macer Calvus (28 May 82 BC – ) was an orator and poet of ancient Rome.

Son of Licinius Macer and thus a member of the &quot;gens Licinia&quot;, he was a friend of the poet Catullus, whose style and subject matter he shared.

Calvus&#x27;s oratorical style opposed the &quot;Asian&quot; school in favor of a simpler Attic model: he characterized Cicero as &quot; (loose and nerveless), while Cicero described him as &quot; (bloodless and dry). However, there was no enmity between these two, and Cicero praised Calvus highly.

Tacitus mentions twenty-one of his speeches, including several speeches against Publius Vatinius. Calvus likely prosecuted Vatinius multiple times, in 58 BC and then later in 54 BC, where he was defended by Cicero. One of these trials (probably the second) is described in Catullus&#x27;s poem 53. At the trial one of the bystanders caused Catullus to laugh by crying out &quot;Great gods, what an eloquent !&quot;. The meaning of the rare word has been disputed, but it has been suggested that it may have referred to Calvus&#x27;s wit or short stature. There may also have been an obscene meaning.

Seneca the Elder mentions his short stature, and refers a story in which Calvus asked to be raised to a platform, so that he could defend one of his clients, Asinius Pollio, being attacked by supporters of Gaius Cato. Seneca also tells a story of how, at a trial, the defendant jumped up and complained &quot;I ask you, judges, am I to be condemned just because that man is a good speaker?&quot;

Catullus counted him as a close friend and addressed several poems to him. In one of these, no. 50, he describes how he and Calvus spent a pleasant afternoon taking turns to write short poems.

Frédéric Plessis published fragments of Calvus in 1896.

<doc id="1053317" wikidata="Q1788904" url="?curid=1053317" title="Old Head of Kinsale">
<text>The Old Head of Kinsale () is a headland near Kinsale, County Cork, Ireland.

A castle has been on the headland since at least the 3rd century, with the current iteration built in 1223. An early lighthouse was established here in the 17th century by Robert Reading. The area is the nearest point of land to where the was sunk in 1915, from the site of the sinking. Currently, access to the Old Head is restricted as it is on the site of a private golf course, which has proven to be controversial.

==Castle==

The Old Head Castle is made up of a long wall with several towers along it, which closes off the headland of the Old Head from the rest of the mainland. It is reported to have been built around the 3rd century AD by the Irish chieftain Cearmna. It was originally named &quot;Dún Cearmna&quot; (Cearmna&#x27;s fort). The land was given to Milo de Cogan by King Henry II.

Following de Cogan&#x27;s death, ownership passed to his son Richard, whose daughter married Milo de Courcy. De Courcy built a new castle around 1223. Consequently, the castle is sometimes called De Courcy Castle. In the 16th century, ownership of the castle passed to Owen MacCarthy, seizing it from the de Courcys. The English regained control of the castle in 1600, ahead of the Spanish invasion of Kinsale.

==Lighthouse==
The Old Head has hosted &quot;lighthouses&quot; for millennia, with references to a beacon of light being maintained on the headland dating back to pre-Christian Ireland. On 13 November 1665 Charles II granted letters patent to Sir Robert Reading to construct six lighthouses around the coast of Ireland. One of these was established on the Old Head of Kinsale, and constituted the first lighthouse on the peninsula as would be recognised as such today. The lighthouse constituted a brazier on the roof of a cottage. There had been earlier beacons, but this was the first proper building which is still extant. Some time after 1683 the light was discontinued, and a petition presented to the House of Commons for its reinstatement.

In 1804 the Revenue Commissioners replaced the brazier with a temporary lantern lit by oil lamps. Eight years later it was recommended that the temporary light be replaced by a permanent tower lighthouse with keepers&#x27; cottages at its base. The new light opened on 16 May 1814. This tower was tall, and rose above sea-level at high water. This proved to be too tall, as the light was often hidden by fog and low-lying clouds. Trinity House recommended a new lighthouse lower down right at the point of the Old Head. Construction started on 20 March 1850 and was completed three years later and first shone on 1 October 1853. Between 1855 and 1907 a red sector covered Courtmacsherry Bay. In 1893 a fog signal was established which was maintained until 2011.

A new lantern was installed in 1907 with the current character of &quot;Gp Fl(2) W 10s&quot; (a group of 2 white flashes repeated every 10 seconds). In 1972 the paraffin lamp was replaced by electricity and the range increased to . Between 1974 and 1992 a radio beacon was transmitted. In 1987 the lighthouse was converted to automatic operation. In 2005 the range was reduced to . In January 2009 an AIS station was established.

==&quot; Lusitania&quot;==

On 7 May 1915, the passenger liner was travelling from New York to Liverpool, when she was torpedoed by a German U-boat, around from the Old Head of Kinsale. The liner sank in 18 minutes, killing 1,199 of the 1,959 passengers and crew. The bodies were subsequently transported to Queenstown. In 2015, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the sinking, a museum opened at the signal tower of the Old Head lighthouse. The owner of the wreck of the &quot;Lusitania&quot; lent various artefacts to house in the museum, which were recovered by Eoin McGarry four years earlier during an authorised dive.

==Golf==

Today, the Old Head of Kinsale is visited by golfers who come to play on its 18-hole golf course that opened in 1997.

Since the golf course opened, access to the Old Head of Kinsale has been restricted to golfers and guests only, and there has been a long-running campaign for the restoration of public access organised by the &quot;Free the Old Head of Kinsale&quot; campaign. This has mainly taken the format of &quot;people&#x27;s picnics&quot;, some of them involving &quot;incursions&quot; onto the headland and holding the picnics at the Old Head lighthouse.

<doc id="1053325" wikidata="Q303076" url="?curid=1053325" title="Malin Head">
<text>Malin Head () is the most northerly point of mainland Ireland, located in the townland of Ardmalin on the Inishowen peninsula in County Donegal. The head&#x27;s northernmost point is called Dunalderagh at latitude 55.38ºN. It is about north of the village of Malin. The island of Inishtrahull is further north, about northeast of the headland. Malin Head gives its name to the Malin sea area. There is a weather station on the head, which is one of 22 such stations whose reports are broadcast as part of the BBC Shipping Forecast. A tower built in 1805 is on Altnadarrow, also known locally as the Tower Hill.

Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; (2nd century AD) described a point called Βορειον (&quot;Boreion&quot;, &quot;the northern&quot;) which probably referred to Malin Head.

==Locality==
To the northeast Inistrahull Island can be seen. The first lighthouse on the island was put into operation in 1813, and the light flashes every 30 seconds.

Below Altnadarrow to the east lies Ballyhillion beach, a unique raised beach system of international scientific importance. The very distinct shorelines show the changing relationship between the sea and the land from the time the glaciers began to melt, some 15,000 years ago. At that time County Donegal was depressed by the weight of an immense ice sheet, so the level of the sea, relative to today&#x27;s shore, was up to 80 feet higher than today.

Scenes from &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; were filmed in Malin Head.

==Weather station==
Weather reports commenced in Malin Head in 1885. In 1955 a new Meteorological station was built beside the coastguard station by Met Éireann. Hourly data points, which include sunshine, wind, rain etc, are recorded here.

===Climate===
Malin Head has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen class Cfb). 
As a result of its exposed coastal location, high winds and storms are a notable presence for much of the year. Summers are typically mild bordering on cool, while winters have cool days and crisp nights.
==Wartime use==

A military watchtower was built on Altnadarrow in 1805, during the Napoleonic Wars. Around 1902, a signal station used by the Marconi Company was built close to the old Napoleonic watchtower. Both of these buildings still stand. 
During The Emergency (World War II), the Government of Ireland allowed the British Government to site two radio direction finders on Malin Head. This top-secret operation was mentioned in The Cranborne Report. The RDF equipment was used by Allied naval and air forces to monitor U-boat and aerial activity in the North Atlantic. A detailed history of radio at Malin Head, &quot;Marconi Wireless Radio Station: Malin Head from 1902&quot; was published in 2014.

To the north of Altnadarrow and just before Dúnalderagh, a ground marker reading &#x27;80 EIRE&#x27; can be seen in large letters that were formed from placing stones together to form the letters. This was to signify to overflying planes that they were crossing Irish territory and that Ireland was neutral.

==Ornithology ==
Malin Head is an ideal vantage point from which to view the autumnal movements of seabirds such as gannets, shearwaters, skuas, auks and others, on their southward migration flights. Rarities have included Black-browed Albatross, Feas Petrel and many other rare seabirds have been recorded here. This is also a good vantage point for viewing Basking sharks and the resident pod of Bottle-nosed Dolphins.

<doc id="1053330" wikidata="Q704367" url="?curid=1053330" title="Moritz Volz">
<text>Moritz Volz (born 21 January 1983) is a German former professional footballer, media pundit and scout. He played as a right-back with Schalke 04, Arsenal, Wimbledon, Fulham, Ipswich Town, FC St. Pauli and 1860 Munich.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Volz was born in Siegen and started his career in his native Germany at Schalke 04, before being spotted by Arsenal while playing for the German youth team. He was offered a contract and joined the Gunners in the summer of 1999. Volz&#x27;s debut for the Gunners came in a League Cup defeat to Ipswich Town in 2000. With the club&#x27;s academy, Volz also won the FA Youth Cup in 2000 and 2001. He made another appearance for Arsenal&#x27;s first team a year later in a League Cup defeat to Sunderland. In February 2003, he was loaned out to Wimbledon, where he impressed by scoring on his debut against Brighton and going on to make nine further appearances for the Dons. He returned from loan in the summer of the same year before joining Fulham, again on loan, in August 2003. The move was made permanent in January 2004.

===Fulham===
At Fulham, Volz attained cult-figure status with the fans, in part due to his commitment, passion and community involvement. He was also popular with the club&#x27;s faithful given that he rode his bicycle to home games. He had several nicknames at Craven Cottage, such as &#x27;220 Volz&#x27;, &#x27;The Electrician&#x27;, &#x27;Mr Resistor&#x27;, &#x27;The Hoff&#x27; due to his adulation of David Hasselhoff, &#x27;The Lightbulb&#x27; and the rather simple &#x27;Volzy&#x27;. For the match against Aston Villa on Saturday 21 October 2006, he had &#x27;The Hoff&#x27; written on his boots for good luck and promptly scored his first goal in three years.

Volz signed a contract extension on 9 December 2006, which kept him at the club until 2009. 
On 30 December 2006, he went on to score the 15,000th goal in Premier League history for Fulham against Chelsea. Inevitably, this feat gave birth to the new nickname &#x27;15,000 Volz&#x27;. As he scored that goal, Volz donated £15,000 to three charitable organisations: Kick 4 Life, The Prince&#x27;s Trust, and Fulham Football Club&#x27;s Community charity. In July 2008, Volz was awarded PPF Community Champion Award, which is associated with &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper.

On 28 August 2008, he signed for Championship side Ipswich Town on a season-long loan deal. Volz joined the club as he hoped to help the Tractor Boys get promoted to the Premier League. Altogether, he was capped a total of 22 times for the club.

On 1 July 2009, he was released from Fulham as he came to the end of his contract and was so praised by the club for his loyal service. Volz sent a farewell message to Fulham supporters upon the club&#x27;s website. While on the lookout for a new team, he kept training with the club to maintain his fitness and also did media work for Sky Sports at the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.

On 2 January 2010, Volz got a trial with former club Schalke 04. He joined the team at Chiclana de la Frontera for a training camp.

===FC St. Pauli===
Volz eventually joined up with FC St. Pauli on 15 June 2010, signing a two-year contract. He made his debut on 5 November 2010 against Schalke 04.

===1860 Munich===
Volz joined 1860 Munich on 5 June 2012, signing a three-year contract. At 1860 Munich he won the 2014–15 2. Bundesliga relegation playoffs, with the club thus staying within the league.

==International career==
Although Volz was not part of the German team that reached the semi-finals of the World Cup on home soil in 2006, he was an ever-present force in Dieter Eilts&#x27; successful under-21 side. He helped the team qualify for the European Championships in summer 2006. Volz was included in the senior squad for the 17 November 2004 game in Leipzig against Cameroon but did not appear on the field.

==Scouting and media work==
Volz wrote for &quot;The Times&quot; and worked as a pundit for Sky Sports, Setanta Sports and ITV while playing in the UK. He later worked as a colour commentator for DAZN in Germany.

After his retirement in the summer of 2015 Volz worked in 1860 Munich&#x27;s youth department. He was later a scout for Arsenal.

<text>The Derryveagh Mountains () are the major mountain range in County Donegal, Ireland. It makes up much of the landmass of the county and is the area of Ireland with the lowest population density. The mountains separate the coastal parts of the county, such as Gweedore and Glenties, from the major inland towns such as Ballybofey and Letterkenny. Its highest peak is Errigal.

<doc id="1053333" wikidata="Q7593954" url="?curid=1053333" title="St Lawrence, Isle of Wight">
<text>St Lawrence is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Ventnor, on the south (English Channel) coast of the Isle of Wight, in southern England. It is located to the west of the town of Ventnor, in the Undercliff, which is subject to landslips. The Undercliff lies between the original high cliff and the sea, formed over thousands of years, since the last Ice Age, from accumulated landslips. Several rocky coves can be accessed from the coastal path, which affords fine views of some prominent Victorian villas, set in a wooded landscape below the great rock wall of the original sea cliff: Woody Bay, Mount Bay and Orchard Bay. The area of the parish was around in size. In 1931 the parish had a population of 329. On 1 April 1933 the parish was abolished and merged with Ventnor.

==History==
St. Lawrence is much older than Ventnor dating back to at least the Middle Ages. The &quot;Old Church of St. Lawrence&quot; dates from the 12th century. When first built it was only 20 feet long and 12 feet wide, considered at the time to be the smallest church in England. In 1842 it was lengthened by the addition of a ten-foot chancel. Although there are undoubtedly smaller chapels including the tiny church at Les Vauxbelets on Guernsey, this arguably remains the smallest to be built as a parish church — although this role has long since been supplanted by a larger, Victorian church in the village. 
The old church has a 15th-century baptismal font - a stoup that is about 500 years old and a series of 18th-century hat pegs. The piscina niche is almost the same age as the church. The church was refurbished in 1926–7. A larger church, St Lawrence&#x27;s Church, St Lawrence, is situated away from the Old Church dates from the 19th century. It also has a 17th-century altar and a chest that dates from 1612.

In the 1870s the village was described in the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales as consisting of &quot;ivy mantled thatched cottages, with orchards&quot; with many Juniper trees nearby.

During World War II the village was home to RAF St Lawrence. Originally a temporary base for RAF Ventnor and RAF Thorney Island, by 1942 it was a fully active radar base in its own right. The base had two masts approximately 200 yards apart. The base ceased operations in 1947 and in 1994 a memorial plaque was placed at the site.

==William Spindler==
St Lawrence was in the nineteenth century the subject of an ambitious plan by a German developer and philanthropist, named William Spindler (who had made his fortune as a chemist in Berlin), to develop St Lawrence as a resort to rival Ventnor. He lived at Old Park, a mansion near Binnel Bay, from 1881 to his death in 1889 and is buried in Whitwell churchyard. During his time in St. Lawrence, he had an enormous influence there and on the surrounding areas. He possibly alienated local opinion with a series of &quot;improving pamphlets&quot; criticising local perceived laziness. He decried the lack of woodland in the area and employed local men to plant a million trees. He paid a large part of the money needed to supply St Lawrence and Whitwell with drinking water. You can see red-painted hydrants bearing lions&#x27; heads dotted about Whitwell&#x27;s streets, and the occasional black-painted St Lawrence hydrants, one of which stands beside Seven Sisters Road, in the heart of the old village. Several huge pieces of masonry in Binnel Bay, all that is left of a harbour, are known locally as &quot;Spindler&#x27;s Follies&quot;.

==Amenities==
The village has a post office, two churches and a village hall. A building at Old Park, where William Spindler lived, houses artists&#x27; studios, open to the public once a year over the August bank holiday weekend, together with The Bunker art gallery, housed in a Second World War radar station nearby.

Pelham Wood Nature Reserve is situated beside the Undercliff Drive and is open to the public. On the other side of the main road is a turning leading to St Lawrence Well, with its ornate Victorian well housing.

Close to the newer church is the entrance to the Rare Breeds Park, which closed down due to loss of revenue from legally enforced closure during the foot and mouth epidemic of 2001.

==Transport==
The Undercliff Drive, the main road between Ventnor and Niton, was closed beyond St Lawrence in February 2014 by a landslip. Access was later restored for pedestrians and cyclists via a footbridge, the lack of through motorised traffic making this stretch of road much safer and quieter for walkers and cyclists than before. Due to the road closure, St Lawrence is now only served by local bus Number 31, operated by Minibus Plus.com on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.

<text>Andy Adams (May 3, 1859 – September 26, 1935) was an American writer of western fiction.

==Life and career==
Andy Adams was born in Thorncreek Township, Indiana, the son of Andrew Adams, who was of Irish descent, and Elizabeth Elliott, who was of Scottish descent. As a boy, he helped with the cattle and horses on the family farm. During the early 1880s, he went to Texas, where he stayed for 10 years, spending much of that time driving cattle on the western trails. In 1890, he tried working as a businessman, but the venture failed, so he tried gold-mining in Colorado and Nevada. In 1894, he settled in Colorado Springs, where he lived until his death.

He began writing at the age of 43, publishing his most successful book, &quot;The Log of a Cowboy&quot;, in 1903. His other works include &quot;A Texas Matchmaker&quot; (1904), &quot;The Outlet&quot; (1905), &quot;Cattle Brands&quot; (1906), &quot;Reed Anthony, Cowman: An Autobiography&quot; (1907), &quot;Wells Brothers&quot; (1911), and &quot;The Ranch on the Beaver&quot; (1927).

&quot;The Log of a Cowboy&quot; is an account of a five-month drive of 3,000 cattle from Brownsville, Texas, to Montana during 1882 along the Great Western Cattle Trail. Although the book is fiction, it is based on Adams&#x27;s own experiences, and it is considered by many to be literature&#x27;s best account of cowboy life. Adams was disgusted by the unrealistic cowboy fiction being published in his time; &quot;The Log of a Cowboy&quot; was his response. It is still in print, and even modern reviewers consider it compelling. The Chicago Herald said: &quot;As a narrative of cowboy life, Andy Adams&#x27; book is clearly the real thing. It carries its own certificate of authentic first-hand experience on every page.&quot;

<text>The Blue Stack Mountains or Bluestack Mountains, also called the Croaghgorms (), are the major mountain range in the south of County Donegal, Ireland. They provide a barrier between the south of the county, such as Donegal Town and Ballyshannon, and the towns to the north and west such as Dungloe and Letterkenny. The road between the two parts of the county goes through the Barnesmore Gap.

The highest mountain in the range is Croaghgorm, which is high. Nearby summits include Ardnageer (, Croaghanirwore (), Croaghbarnes (), Croaghblane (), Croaghnageer (), Croveenananta (), Gaugin Mountain (), Lacroagh (), Lavagh More () and Lavagh Beg ().

<text>Silvermines, historically known as Bellagowan (), is a village in County Tipperary in Ireland. It lies immediately north of the Silvermine mountain range and takes its name from the extensive mines of lead, zinc, copper, baryte and silver nearby. Towards the very south of the Silvermine Mountains is the highest peak in the mountains, &quot;Keeper Hill&quot; or in Irish Sliabh Cimeálta, which rises to 695m, dominating the area. Silvermines is located near the town of Nenagh on the R499 regional road. It is a parish in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe and is also in the historical barony of Ormond Upper.

==Mining heritage==

The earliest record of mining in the district is from 1289, but was short-lived. Mining resumed in the 17th century and continued intermittently until 1874. It restarted in 1949, and shortly after a world-class deposit of baryte was found and opencast mining of this began in 1963 by Magcobar (Ireland) Ltd. Soon after a multi-million-tonne orebody grading about 11% combined lead and zinc was also discovered. This was worked underground from 1968 to 1982 by Mogul of Ireland Ltd. The Magcobar mine closed in September 1992, and its extensive spoil heaps are a prominent local landmark, visible for miles. The Mogul mine became famous for the many fine mineral specimens it produced, particularly of the ore minerals galena and sphalerite.

The Old Smelting House, now a ruin, is listed as a protected structure by Tipperary County Council (RPS Ref S477).

Recently, the area has come to media attention as the integrity of the village&#x27;s water supply was threatened by pollution from the tailings left behind at the mine.

==Transport==
Freight trains no longer serve Silvermines.

Bus Éireann route 323 from Newport, County Tipperary to Nenagh serves the village on Fridays-only. There is a journey at 11.00 am to Nenagh. This returns from Nenagh railway station at 1.45 pm, serving the village at 2.05 pm and continuing to Newport.

==Slieve Felim Way==
The Slieve Felim Way, a long-distance trail through the Silvermine and Slieve Felim Mountains has a trail-head in the village. It is designated as a National Waymarked Trail by the National Trails Office of the Irish Sports Council and is managed by Shannon Development and Coillte.

<doc id="1053352" wikidata="Q13054" url="?curid=1053352" title="Steed Malbranque">
<text>Steed Claude Malbranque (born 6 January 1980) is a former professional footballer. Born in Belgium, he represented France at international level.

Malbranque started his professional career with Lyon, before moving to England in 2001, where he had spells with Fulham, Tottenham Hotspur and Sunderland. He returned to France in 2011 for a short spell with Saint-Étienne. In 2012, he joined Lyon for the second time. At Tottenham, he became one of 17 Spurs players to manage 50 games in a single season. He principally played as a winger or attacking midfielder. During his second spell at Lyon he also played as a central midfielder.

==Club career==
===Lyon===
He was a trainee at Lyon youth academy between 1995 and 1997, during which time he won the Under-15 championship twice, the Under-17 Cup and the reserve team championship. He also captained the French Under-18 side.

He made his professional debut for the club in a 1–1 draw against Montpellier on 21 February 1998 aged 18. He went on to play a total of 96 games for the club, which included 12 appearances and two goals in the Champions League and seven appearances in the UEFA Cup.

Malbranque was an unused substitute in the final as Lyon won the 2001 French Coupe de la Ligue.

During his time at the club, there was a chance to join English club Arsenal after impressing in a Champions League tie at Highbury and the following tie, a 3–0 victory over Bayern Munich at Stade de Gerland. He rejected the move as he felt he was not ready to play in the Premier League.

===Fulham===
He eventually made his move to the Premier League in 2001, joining Fulham for a fee believed to be £4.5 million, making his debut in a 3–2 defeat at Old Trafford against Manchester United. He went on to score 10 goals in his first season. As a result, making an impressive display in his first season at Fulham, Malbranque was described by Christian Damiano, who has kept track of Malbranque&#x27;s development since he was 13-year-old, as &quot;the number 10 position that Zidane excels at Fulham&quot;.

He became a firm favourite during his five years at the club, playing a total of 211 games and scoring 44 goals, including six appearances and three goals in Fulham&#x27;s short-lived UEFA Cup campaign in the 2002–03 season. He was the top scorer that season with 13 goals that helped save Fulham from relegation. He was offered the chance to play for Belgium towards the end of the campaign, having not represented the full France side; however, he turned it down with the hope that he would eventually break into the full French squad. He scored in Fulham&#x27;s 3–1 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford in October 2003. During the same month, Malbranque would sign a new four-year contract to keep him at Craven Cottage until 2007.

On 13 May 2006, after extensive contract talks with the club failed, Malbranque was placed on the transfer list at Fulham after he declared his intention to leave at the end of his contract. There was rumoured interest from Reading, Middlesbrough, West Ham United, Manchester City, Everton and Newcastle United, but he opted to sign for Tottenham Hotspur on the deadline day of the transfer window (31 August) for a fee believed to be £2 million, despite an injury that would keep him out for approximately 10 weeks.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Malbranque made his debut for Tottenham Hotspur almost 10 weeks after signing for the club on 8 November at White Hart Lane playing 63 minutes in a League Cup 3–1 victory over Port Vale. He had been unable to play earlier than that after a non-essential groin operation.

He scored his first goal for Spurs in an emphatic 5–1 victory over Charlton Athletic at White Hart Lane on 9 December. Malbranque became a fan favourite at Tottenham because of his strong work ethic. Malbranque finished the 2007–08 season in the top five in the Premier League for tackles made and tackles per minute, demonstrating his work ethic and tackling ability.

He scored Tottenham&#x27;s 150th goal in European competition with his goal in the second leg of the UEFA Cup last 16 against Sporting Braga on 14 March 2007 at White Hart Lane. On 12 April 2007, during the second leg of the UEFA Cup quarter-final against defending champions Sevilla, Malbranque famously scored an anomalous own goal. A Sevilla corner was met with a header from Christian Poulsen. The ball appeared to be going wide of the goal until Malbranque took a wild lash at the ball to clear it and keep it in play. The ball was sliced backwards into Spurs&#x27; own net. The match ended in a 2–2 draw, but Sevilla went through to the next round on 4–3 aggregate.

He started for Spurs as they won the 2008 Football League Cup Final against Chelsea.

===Sunderland===
Malbranque followed teammates Pascal Chimbonda and Teemu Tainio to Sunderland. Malbranque signed a four-year contract on 30 July 2008. He went on to score his first goal for the club with the first goal in Sunderland&#x27;s 4–1 victory over Hull City at the KC Stadium. Malbranque enjoyed his best form in a Sunderland shirt during the 2009–10 season, proving fruitful on the left wing as opposed to the right. He scored his second Sunderland goal in their FA Cup third round victory over non-league Barrow. His run of form helped Sunderland climb the table after a positive streak of results mid-season.

Malbranque remained at Sunderland for the 2010–11 season, moving into a more central role to accommodate loan signing Danny Welbeck. He featured in Sunderland&#x27;s early seven match unbeaten run, which included games against Manchester City, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United. Malbranque missed a penalty in Sunderland&#x27;s 2–0 victory against Stoke City. On 1 February 2011, he made his 100th appearance for Sunderland playing against Chelsea at the Stadium of Light.

Malbranque became a fan favourite during his time with Sunderland but in the 2011 summer transfer window it was revealed that he was in advanced talks with French team Saint-Étienne with a view to joining them. His manager at Sunderland, Steve Bruce, stated he was surplus to requirements, and it was also revealed his transfer would free up funds for new summer signings as well as cut their wage bill.

===Saint-Étienne===
On 3 August 2011, it was announced Malbranque had signed with French side AS Saint-Étienne on a two-year contract, thus ending a 10-year stay in English football.
A month after joining, rumours circulated that Malbranque had asked to be released from his contract due his son being ill with cancer. Malbranque eventually released a statement issued by London-based solicitors Thomas Cooper denying this:

&quot;Steed has read with concern the recent stories currently circulating about him and his family,
He would like to reassure all of his friends in England and throughout world football that these stories are wholly without foundation.
Steed does not have a son and his immediate family are all in good health.
Steed does not know the origin of these stories but would like to stress that they are without merit.
He trusts that they will now cease immediately.&quot;

The following day, Saint-Étienne announced they and Malbranque had agreed to a mutual termination of his contract.

There was another circulated that Malbranque would consider retirement, something that denied by Malbranque himself.

===Return to Lyon===
On 2 August 2012, it was confirmed by Malbranque&#x27;s first club Lyon that he was being taken on trial with the view to a permanent contract. On 25 August 2012 Malbranque signed a one-year contract with Lyon after spending three weeks with the club.

In his first game after returning to Lyon, Malbranque played a superb game against Valenciennes being paired with Maxime Gonalons in midfield and helped his team win the game 3–2. He played the next game for Lyon on 16 September, against Ajaccio and in 75th minute of the match he delivered an assist to Lisandro to make the final result 2–0 for Lyon. In a UEFA Europa League tie against Hapoel Kiryat Shmona on 4 October, Malbranque delivered another key assist, this time from a corner in the 93rd minute for Gueïda Fofana to head the ball into the net and make the final result 4–3 for Lyon. On 21 October Lyon played against Brest and it was again Malbranque with a wonderful chip assist in the 57th minute for Gomis to make the final result 1–0 for Lyon. On 4 November, Lyon encountered Bastia at Gerland and Malbranque assisted for Briand and two minutes later scored a penalty himself in the 95th minute to make the final score 5–2 for Lyon. On 11 November, he assisted from a free kick for Gonalons in Sochaux, but Sochaux equalised through Sloan Privat in the 71st minute and the match ended 1–1. A week later Lyon played against Reims and won 3–0 with Malbranque assisting Lisandro for the third goal in the 90th minute. On 28 November, with Lyon visiting Marseille, Malbranque scored a volley from Lacazette&#x27;s cross making it 3–0 for Lyon. The game eventually ended with Lyon winning 4–1, with Gomis adding Lyon&#x27;s fourth goal. He made his sixth Ligue 1 assist of the season for Michel Bastos&#x27; equaliser against Nancy on 12 December 2012, with the game ending 1–1. During the same month, Malbranque would sign a new contract with the club, which will keep him until 2014.

In their first league game of 2013, Lyon played away against ESTAC Troyes on 12 January winning the match 2–1, with Malbranque assisting from the corner for Gonalons&#x27; opener in 11th minute.

===Caen===
On 17 June 2016, Malbranque signed for Caen as a free agent on a one-year contract.

===Amateur leagues===
In November 2017, he came out of retirement to sign with Chasselay MDA, playing in the Championnat National 2. On 4 September 2020, he joined Limonest in the Championnat National 3.

==International career==
Born in Belgium to French parents, Malbranque was called up to the French Under-21s and was part of the squad of &quot;Les Bleus&quot; that lost to the Czech Republic in the final of the 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship.

In February 2004, after failing to break into France&#x27;s senior squad, Malbranque expressed an interest in representing the Belgium national team. However, the &quot;Red Devils&quot;&#x27; coach Aimé Anthuenis claimed that Malbranque was not eligible to represent the country. A month later, Malbranque was called into the senior France squad for a friendly against the Netherlands but was an unused squad member.

In November 2012, Malbranque received a call-up to the French squad for a friendly against Italy but again failed to earn his debut cap.

<text>Manchester Cathedral, formally the Cathedral and Collegiate Church of St Mary, St Denys and St George, in Manchester, England, is the mother church of the Anglican Diocese of Manchester, seat of the Bishop of Manchester and the city&#x27;s parish church. It is on Victoria Street in Manchester city centre and is a grade I listed building.

The former parish church was rebuilt in the Perpendicular Gothic style in the years following the foundation of the collegiate body in 1421. Then at the end of the 15th century, James Stanley II (warden 1485–1506 and later Bishop of Ely 1506–1515) was responsible for rebuilding the nave and collegiate choir with high clerestory windows; also commissioning the late-medieval wooden internal furnishings, including the pulpitum, choir stalls and the nave roof supported by angels with gilded instruments. The collegiate church became the cathedral of the new Diocese of Manchester in 1847. It was extensively refaced, restored and extended in the Victorian period, and again following bomb damage during World War II. It is one of fifteen Grade I listed buildings in Manchester.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The origins of Manchester&#x27;s first churches are obscure. The &quot;Angel Stone&quot;, a small carving of an angel with a scroll, is preserved in the cathedral. It was discovered in the wall of the cathedral&#x27;s south porch providing evidence of an earlier, possibly Anglo-Saxon, church. It has been dated to around 700 AD, however the Corpus of Anglo-Saxon sculpture dates the sculpture to the twelfth century. Its Latin inscription translates as &quot;into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit&quot;. The first church, possibly sited on or near the site of St Ann&#x27;s Church, was destroyed by Danish invaders in 923 and a church dedicated to St Mary, built by King Edward the Elder, possibly where St Mary&#x27;s Gate joins Exchange Street, was mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086. The Domesday Book entry for Manchester reads &quot;the Church of St Mary and the Church of St Michael hold one carucate of land in Manchester exempt from all customary dues except tax&quot;.

===Parish church===
Construction of the predecessor parish church between the Rivers Irk and Irwell and an ancient watercourse crossed by the Hanging Bridge started in 1215 within the confines of the Baron&#x27;s Court beside the manor house on the site of Manchester Castle. The lords of the manor were the Grelleys whose coat of arms is still associated with the cathedral. The Grelleys acted as stewards, building and endowing the first chancery, the St Nicholas Chancery. In 1311, the Grelley estate passed by marriage to the de la Warres. In 1349 the St Nicholas Chancery was endowed by the de Traffords. In 1382 Thomas de la Warre became its rector.

The church had a six-bay aisled nave and six-bay chancel with aisles and a west tower in the perpendicular style of the late-medieval period.

===Collegiate church===
Thomas de la Warre became Baron de la Warre in 1398. A priest for more than 50 years, he was granted a licence from King Henry V and Pope Martin V to establish a collegiate church in Manchester in 1421. The college was established by royal charter, with a warden, eight fellows, four singing clerks and eight choristers. The parish church was dedicated to St Mary and to that dedication were added St George, the patron saint of England, and St Denys, the patron saint of France, perhaps reflecting de la Warre&#x27;s French heritage, or Henry V&#x27;s claim to the French throne. The college of priests was housed in new buildings on the site of the former manor house that survive as Chetham&#x27;s Library paid for by de la Warre. He appointed John Huntingdon as the college&#x27;s first warden who, between 1422 and 1458, rebuilt the eastern arm of the parish church to provide the collegiate choir. Huntington&#x27;s monumental brass (much restored) is laid on the chancel floor. Huntington is also commemorated in Victorian rebus, carvings of a man &quot;hunting&quot; and a man with a &quot;tun&quot; (barrel of ale), on either side of the arch accessing the Lady Chapel. The church&#x27;s 14th-century west tower and Lady Chapel were incorporated into the current structure although little or no fabric of that date is still visible, and the Lady Chapel was lost in 1940.

Traditionally the third warden, Ralph Langley (1465–1481), is credited with rebuilding the nave but the nave and choir were substantially reconstructed again by James Stanley II (1485–1506) a few years later, when he raised the clerestory and provided the richly decorated timber roofs and choir stalls. James&#x27;s stepmother, Lady Margaret Beaufort was mother of Henry VII and through their alliance with the Tudor dynasty the Stanleys acquired both fabulous wealth and access to architects and craftsmen working on royal commissions. On stylistic grounds, the chancel arcades and clerestory of the cathedral are attributed to John Wastell, the architect for the completion of Kings College Chapel, Cambridge. The choir stalls, carved at the workshop of William Brownflet of Ripon, are the finest of a series which includes the surviving stalls at Ripon Cathedral, Beverley Minster and Bridlington Priory. The carving of the misericord seats is exceptionally fine. James Stanley was responsible for the embellishment of the nave roof with supports in the form of fourteen life-size angel minstrels; and for the endowment of his own chantry chapel (now destroyed) near the north-east corner, in which he was buried in 1515.

The college was dissolved in 1547 in the reign of Edward VI by the Chantries Act, but refounded by his sister Mary in 1553. Its future was uncertain when Elizabeth I succeeded in 1559, but was assured when she granted a new charter in 1578, allowing a warden, four fellows, two chaplains, four singing men and four choristers. The dedication of the college (but not the church) was changed to the college of Christ. Manchester and Southwell Minster were the only two medieval collegiate foundations where daily choral worship was maintained after the Reformation until they were joined by Ripon when its collegiate foundation was restored in 1607. John Dee, magus and astrologer for Elizabeth I was warden from 1595 to 1608 and occupied the wardens&#x27; lodgings now incorporated into Chetham&#x27;s Library. The present charter, the fourth, was granted by Charles I preserving the dedication of the college to Christ.

====Chantry chapels====

In the early 16th century an almost complete sequence of chantry chapels was constructed along the north and south sides of the church creating a double aisle around the parochial nave, which is consequently much wider than it is long. Manchester is commonly claimed to have the widest nave of any cathedral in England. On the south side, the oldest of the chantry chapels, the St Nicholas Chapel, was rebuilt by the de Traffords in 1470. St George&#x27;s Chapel was endowed by William Galley in 1503 and Richard Beswick endowed the Jesus Chapel in 1506. On the north side, William Radcliffe of Ordsall Hall endowed the Holy Trinity Chapel in the northwest corner in 1498. Huntington left money and land for the St James&#x27; Chapel which was built in 1507. The largest of the chantries, the St John the Baptist Chapel, was begun by James Stanley the Bishop of Ely in 1513. The attached funerary chapel for James Stanley, the Ely Chapel, was destroyed by bombing in 1940. The brass from atop Stanley&#x27;s tombchest was rescued from the wreckage, and remounted vertically against the rebuilt north wall of the Regiment Chapel.

The western chapels are no longer demarcated, as the screens that divided them have been removed giving the appearance of double aisles on either side of the nave.

====Batch marriages====

Until 1850, the Collegiate Church remained the parish church for the whole of Manchester (this is the ancient parish, including almost the whole area of the modern City of Manchester excepting Wythenshawe), an area which in 1821 had a population of 187,031. Within this vast parish there were considerable numbers of chapels of ease and proprietary chapels for parochial worship – as well as other chapels for dissenters and Roman Catholics. Nevertheless, the Wardens and fellows of the Collegiate church maintained their legal right to a fee of 3s. 6d. for all marriages conducted within their parish; so, unless a couple were able and willing to pay two sets of marriage fees, the only place in Manchester where a marriage might legally be contracted was the collegiate church. In practice, this religious duty fell on the pastoral chaplain employed by the Warden and fellows; who from 1790 to 1821 was the eccentric figure of the Revd. Joshua &#x27;Jotty&#x27; Brookes. In 1821 a total of 1,924 marriages were solemnized in the collegiate church; commonly in batches of a score or more. The couples to be married were most often desperately poor but Brookes was no respecter of status, so all were subjected to his &#x27;production line&#x27; methods. Commonly, the groom and friends would decamp to a nearby ale-house while the bride kept place in the queue; but if there was one groom too few when a group of couples were lined up in front of the altar, Brookes notoriously would countenance no delay, but would continue the marriage with any passer-by (or even one of the other grooms) as a proxy stand-in. Brookes is commonly reckoned to have conducted more marriages, funerals and christenings than any English clergyman before or since.

As the population of Manchester increased further; so the numbers of christenings, weddings and funerals celebrated in the collegiate church also grew. In 1838, there were 5,164 christenings, 1,457 funerals, and 2,615 weddings.

=== Cathedral ===

Under the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act 1840, the warden and fellows of the collegiate church were translated into a dean and canons in preparation for becoming the cathedral of the new Diocese of Manchester which came into effect in 1847. Initial proposals for a new cathedral to be built to the designs of R. C. Carpenter on Piccadilly Gardens were not proceeded with. The building was extensively renovated in 1882.

During the Manchester Blitz in 1940, a German bomb exploded a few yards from the north-east corner, severely damaging the cathedral roofs and demolishing the medieval lady chapel and James Stanley&#x27;s chantry chapel. All stained-glass windows were blown out, the organ-case over the pulpitum was destroyed, and the medieval choir stalls toppled inwards so as to meet one another. It took almost 20 years to complete the repairs, in the course of which the Lady Chapel was rebuilt to the designs of Hubert Worthington and the St John the Baptist Chapel was refitted as the regimental chapel for the Manchester Regiment. The cathedral was again damaged in the IRA bombing in June 1996.

The cathedral houses extensive parish and historical archives, dating back to 1421. In 2003, a project began to provide an exhaustive catalogue of the archive&#x27;s contents to the public. The cathedral was granted Grade I listed building status in January 1952. Grade I structures are considered to be &quot;buildings of exceptional interest&quot;.

== Architecture ==
The cathedral is constructed of three types of stone. The walls and internal piers were originally constructed in a dark purple-brown Collyhurst sandstone formed in the Early Permian period. This is now visible only in the tower arch of the nave, in the interior of the Jesus Chapel and in the chancel; as in the early 19th century all the surfaces of the nave and aisles were scored to be encased in Roman Cement. This damaged the structure so severely that most internal and external stonework had to be replaced in the later 19th century restorations in buff-grey Fletcher Bank Grit from Ramsbottom. The nave floors have, since the 1960s, been relaid in limestone from the Peak District which contains crinoid fossils.

===Restorations===
By the 1840s the external and internal stonework was in a poor state, partly due to the poor weathering qualities of the Collyhurst sandstone, but also because of an ill-advised attempt to lighten the interior by coating the internal surfaces of the nave with Roman cement by John Palmer. The external stonework was replaced between 1850 and 1870 in a restoration by J. S. Crowther, who also replaced the internal stonework of the nave walls and arcades with exact reproductions of the originals. The west tower was heightened in 1868 by J.P. Holden, who also replaced its external stonework. Basil Champneys added the vestry, canons&#x27; library and western porches in 1898; while Percy Worthington provided further accommodation to the South-east, originally as a choir school, but subsequently converted to offices. Consequently, the cathedral gives the impression of being a 19th-century structure.

To accommodate upgrading work on the cathedral&#x27;s heating system, in 2013 a temporary wooden cathedral was built on Victoria Street to allow worship to take place.

=== Furniture ===

====Angel minstrels====

The nave roof brackets are supported by fourteen angel sculptures, each playing a different late medieval instrument, believed to be the gift of James Stanley II.

South side (from the east):

Portative organ, harp, psaltery (plucked), dulcimer (played with hammers), lute, fithele, hurdy-gurdy

North side (from the east):

clavicymbal, trumpet, shawm, Scots pipes (mouth-blown), Irish pipes (bellows-blown), recorder, tabor

It is supposed that, in the 19th century restoration of the nave, the clavicymbal and organ were inadvertently transposed; as otherwise the south side has stringed instruments, and the north side mostly wind instruments. Only the organ presents an instrument that would commonly have been heard in church in the early 16th century; the other instruments would have been more typically used to accompany secular songs and dances. All these instruments, however, might well have been heard accompanying mystery play performances in the street, and in popular religious processions.

==== Misericords ====

The cathedral has thirty 16th-century misericords, considered to be among the finest in Europe. They are similar in style to those at Ripon Cathedral and Beverley Minster. Although Manchester&#x27;s are of a later date, they were probably carved by the same school at Ripon. One of the most notable is N-08, the earliest known depiction of backgammon in the UK.

==== Stained glass ====

All the Victorian stained glass was destroyed during the Manchester Blitz in 1940. Until the late 1960s, only two windows had been replaced, notably the Fire Window by Margaret Traherne (1966). The dean and chapter commissioned Tony Hollaway to prepare a scheme for reglazing the cathedral, with priority to the five western windows: St George (1973), St Denys (1976), St Mary (1980), The Creation (1991) and The Apocalypse (1995). To commemorate the restoration of the cathedral following an IRA bomb in 1996, the Healing Window by Linda Walton was installed in 2004.

==== Bells ====
The ten bells in the cathedral tower hung for change ringing were cast by Gillett &amp; Johnston of Croydon in 1925. The tenor (largest) bell weighs 1.3 tonnes and the bells are tuned to the key of D. The bells are rung for church service on Sunday mornings and on special occasions including a visit by Elizabeth II to distribute the Royal Maundy. One of the recipients was the tower captain, Roland Eccles, for 35 years of service to ringing and the cathedral community.

==Dean and chapter==
As of 28 July 2024:
*Dean — Rogers Govender (since 14 January 2006)
*Precentor and Sub Dean— Ian Jorysz
*Canon Missioner — Grace Thomas
*Archdeacon of Rochdale (Diocesan Canon) — Karen Smeeton
==In literature==
Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poetical illustration, Collegiate Church, Manchester, to an engraving of a picture of the interior by Thomas Allom was published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1833.
==Visitor centre==
The visitor centre by the cathedral&#x27;s south porch costing £3 million was opened by Elizabeth II. It has a shop and an exhibition room. The main attraction is the 15th-century Hanging Bridge, a scheduled monument, that was once the main approach to the church but was buried for more than 100 years.

==Music==

===Organ===
In the course of the 19th century restorations of the interior, the cathedral was provided with an organ mounted over the medieval pulpitum in an elaborate case designed by George Gilbert Scott. This instrument was destroyed in the Christmas Blitz of 1940, and was replaced in 1952 with an organ built into the north and south choir aisles. In 2016, this organ was itself replaced by an entirely new instrument, once again mounted over the pulpitum, and funded from the Stoller foundation. The new organ case and letterings were designed by Stephen Raw.

===Organists===

Organist and Master of the Choristers: Christopher Stokes. Sub Organist: Geoffrey Woollatt.

Notable previous organists include Edward Betts (d.1767), Joseph John Harris (1848–1869), Frederick Bridge (1869–75), Sydney Nicholson (1908–1919), Norman Cocker (1943–1954), Allan Wicks (1954–1962) and Gordon Stewart (1981–1992).

===Choir===

The 1421 foundation statutes of the collegiate church provided for an endowed choir of lay clerks and singing boys; and these endowments were renewed when the college was refounded after the Reformation. However, although from the 17th century, there were two grammar schools close by - Manchester Grammar School and Chetham&#x27;s Hospital School - there was, until the 20th century no provision for a choir school; dedicated choir school premises only being constructed by Percy Worthington in 1934. This school did not resume following war damage; so in 1969, when Chetham&#x27;s School was refounded as a dedicated school of music, scholarships were established to enable boys aged 8–13 to serve the cathedral choir. These scholarships were subsequently modified in the 1970s, so as to support both girls&#x27; and boys&#x27; voices; the first statutory choir in the Church of England to make this change. There are now places for 20 choristers and 6 lay clerks.

<text>Sylvain Legwinski (born 6 October 1973) is a French former professional footballer, who played as a midfielder. He is now assistant coach at AS Monaco in France.

Having made a name for himself at AS Monaco and Bordeaux, he played seven years of his professional career in England, collecting more than 200 official appearances for Fulham and Ipswich Town.

==Club career==
Legwinski was born in Clermont-Ferrand. The son of a basketball player with Polish descent who settled at Vichy, he joined AS Monaco FC&#x27;s youth system at 18, as Arsène Wenger was the main squad&#x27;s manager, giving the player his first team debuts shortly after. He developed into a midfield force under Jean Tigana&#x27;s guidance, scoring nine league goals in 1996–97, as Monaco won the national title.

After two seasons and four games into 2001–02 with FC Girondins de Bordeaux, Legwinski rejoined Tigana at Fulham. At the beginning of the 2006–07 season, new Fulham boss Chris Coleman made it clear that Legwinski did not fit into the side&#x27;s future plans and, in August 2006, following a successful trial with Ipswich Town, the player signed a two-year contract.

In his first year at the club, Legwinski won the supporter&#x27;s and manager&#x27;s Player of the Year Award for 2006–07, netting five league goals. During the campaign, he became the only Ipswich player to have scored against all East Anglian opposition during one season (Norwich City, Colchester United, Southend United and Luton Town).

However, Legwinski found himself out of the picture for much of the following season, still managing to find the net twice, in draws against Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers and Burnley. Due to the team&#x27;s extensive midfield, he was told he would not be offered a new contract and, as Town teammate Fabian Wilnis, started looking to the future, working towards his coaching badges.

In September 2008, Legwinski underwent an unsuccessful trial with Swedish team IFK Göteborg. Early in the following year, he had another tryout in the country, with Örgryte IS, which had just won promotion to the top flight.

In March 2009, Legwinski joined St Neots Town as a player/assistant manager, joining player-manager Steve Lomas. Shortly after, definitely retired, he moved to Crystal Palace as a youth coach.
He is now assistant coach at AS Monaco in France.

==International career==
An under-21 international, Legwinski scored once in four matches for the 1996 Summer Olympics quarter-finalists.
