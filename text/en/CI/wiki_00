<doc id="1042244" wikidata="Q5869649" url="?curid=1042244" title="History of the Jews in England (1066–1290)">
<text>The first Jews in England arrived after the Norman Conquest of the country by William the Conqueror (the future William I) in 1066, and the first written record of Jewish settlement in England dates from 1070. Jews suffered massacres in 1189–90, and after a period of rising persecution, all Jews were expelled from England after the Edict of Expulsion in 1290.

In some accounts, the later half of the period is contrasted with the earlier half, in terms of rising persecution and violence, but evidence of tolerance between people living close to each other continues to be found throughout. Persecution and violence appear to have been imposed and incited by people with power, whether from the Church, crown or aristocracy. Plenty of evidence for peaceful coexistence of the different religious populations exists from the thirteenth century, such as mentions of gentile attendance at Jewish weddings. Ultimately, as Jewish people were dependent on the Crown for their presence and protection as non-Christians, the attitude and response of the English crown was decisive for their safety or lack of it.

The experience of English Jewry was particularly significant, both in terms of its political, economic, religious and social importance to England as a whole, and in terms of the development of anti-Semitism; many false accusations and associations were developed in England in this period, and prejudices were more deeply felt, than in other parts of Europe. Most notorious is the accusation of ritual child murder, but also included an association of Jewry with international conspiracy and magic. Anti-Jewish prejudices were expressed in some of the &quot;earliest and most elaborate&quot; devotional artworks to do so, at Lincoln Cathedral and the Cloisters Cross, for example, or, more recently identified, the Hereford Mappa Mundi.

Edward I is also identified as internationally significant, as the first monarch to attempt state-sponsored conversions, to permanently exclude Jews from his kingdom, and the first English monarch to use anti-Semitism as an instrument of state policy.

The Expulsion and its surrounding events also led to the formation of a strong strain of anti-Semitism within English identity that outlasted the period, including the idea that England was unique precisely because it did not include Jews.

Nevertheless, treatment of Jewish aspects of English medieval history in mainstream texts is often held to be under-represented, despite the continuing significance of events such as the expulsion of the Jews, as the first statewide, permanent expulsion in Christian Europe and for its impact on European anti-Semitism which ultimately led to the Shoah.

==William I to Henry I: 1066–1135==
There is no record of Jews in England before the Norman Conquest in 1066. The few references to Jews in the Anglo-Saxon laws of the Roman Catholic Church relate to Jewish practices about Easter.

Soon after William I&#x27;s Conquest, Jewish merchants, probably from Rouen, in Normandy, began to settle in England. However, Jews were not permitted to own land or to participate in trades (except for medicine). They were limited primarily to money lending. As Catholic doctrine held that money lending for interest was the sin of usury, Jews dominated this activity. The earliest immigrants spoke Judeo-French founded on the Norman language.

Around 1092, Gilbert Crispin, the Abbot of Westminster, issued a disputation about his exchange with an erudite Jew, whom he knew as a friend and business colleague, entitled &quot;Disputation of a Jew with a Christian about the Christian Bible.&quot; Crispin wrote:

This disputation was notable for the even-handed presentation of both the Christian and Jewish points of view, and for the congenial tone of the exchange.

At first, the status of Jews was not strictly determined. An attempt was made to introduce the continental principle that all Jews were the king&#x27;s property and a clause to that effect was inserted under King Henry I in some manuscripts of the so-called &quot;Leges Edwardi Confessoris&quot; &quot;Laws of Edward the Confessor&quot;.

However, during Henry&#x27;s reign (1100–1135) a royal charter was granted to Joseph, the chief rabbi of London, and all his followers. Under this charter, Jews were permitted to move about the country without paying tolls, to buy and sell goods and property, to sell their pledges after holding them a year and a day, to be tried by their peers, and to be sworn on the Torah rather than on a Christian Bible. Special weight was attributed to a Jewish person&#x27;s oath, which was valid against that of 12 Christians, because they represented the king of England in financial matters. The sixth clause of the charter was especially important: it granted Jews the right of movement throughout the kingdom, as if they were the king&#x27;s own property (&quot;sicut res propriæ nostræ&quot;).

Jews did not settle outside of London before 1135.

==Stephen to Henry II: 1135–1189==
Christian-Jewish relations in England were disturbed under King Stephen who burned down the house of a Jewish man in Oxford (some accounts say with the owner in it) because he refused to pay a contribution to the king&#x27;s expenses. It was also during this time that the first recorded blood libel against Jews was brought in the case of William of Norwich (March, 1144).

While the crusaders in Germany were attacking Jews, outbursts against the latter in England were, according to the Jewish chroniclers, prevented by King Stephen.

With the restoration of order under Henry II, Jews renewed their activity. Within five years of his accession, Jews are found at London, Oxford, Cambridge, Norwich, Thetford, Bungay, Canterbury, Winchester, Newport, Stafford, Windsor, and Reading. However, they were not permitted to bury their dead elsewhere than in London until 1177. Their spread throughout the country enabled the king to draw upon them as occasion demanded; he repaid them by demand notes on the sheriffs of the counties, who accounted for payments thus made in the half-yearly accounts on the pipe rolls (see Aaron of Lincoln).

Strongbow&#x27;s conquest of Ireland (1170) was financed by Josce, a Jewish man from Gloucester; and the king accordingly fined Josce for having lent money to those under his displeasure. As a rule, however, Henry II does not appear to have limited in any way the financial activity of Jews. The favourable position of the English Jews was shown, among other things, by the visit of Abraham ibn Ezra in 1158, by that of Isaac of Chernigov in 1181, and by the resort to England of the Jews who were exiled from France by Philip Augustus in 1182, among them probably being Judah Sir Leon of Paris.

In 1168, when concluding an alliance with Frederick Barbarossa, Henry II seized the chief representatives of the Jews and sent them to Normandy, while tallaging the rest 5,000 marks). When, however, he asked the rest of the country to pay a tithe for the crusade against Saladin in 1186, he demanded a quarter of the Jewish chattels. The tithe was reckoned at £70,000, the quarter at £60,000. It is improbable, however, that the whole amount was paid at once, as for many years after the imposition of the tallage arrears were demanded from the Jews.

The king had probably been led to make this large demand upon English Jewry by the surprising windfall which came to his treasury at the death of Aaron of Lincoln. In this period, Aaron of Lincoln is believed to have been, probably, the wealthiest man in 12th-century Britain, in liquid assets. All property obtained by usury, whether Jewish or Christian, fell into the king&#x27;s hands on Aaron&#x27;s death; his estate included £15,000 of debts owed by some 430 debtors scattered around the English counties. In order to track down and collect these debts a special section of the Royal Exchequer was constituted, which was known as the &quot;Aaron&#x27;s Exchequer&quot;. The cash treasure of the Aaron&#x27;s estate, that came into the king&#x27;s hands, however, was lost on a shipwreck during a transport to Normandy.

In this era, Jews lived on good terms with their non-Jewish neighbours, including the clergy; they entered churches freely, and took refuge in the abbeys in times of commotion. Some Jews lived in opulent houses, and helped to build a large number of abbeys and monasteries. However, by the end of Henry&#x27;s reign they had incurred the ill will of the upper classes, and anti-Jewish sentiment spread further throughout the nation, fostered by the crusades.

==Massacres at London, Bury and York (1189–1190)==

Richard I had taken the cross before his coronation (3 September 1189). A number of the principal Jews of England presented themselves to do homage at Westminster; but there was a long-standing custom against Jews (and women) being admitted to the coronation ceremony, and they were expelled during the banquet which followed the coronation, whereupon they were attacked by a crowd of bystanders. The rumour spread from Westminster to London that the king had ordered a massacre of the Jews; and a mob in the Old Jewry, after vainly attacking the strong stone houses of the Jews throughout the day, set them on fire at night, killing those within who attempted to escape. The king was enraged at this insult to his royal dignity, but was unable to punish more than a few of the offenders, owing to their large numbers and to the considerable social standing of several of them. After his departure on the crusade, riots with loss of life occurred at Lynn, where some Jews attempted to attack a baptised who had taken refuge in a church. The Christian population burned down the Jews&#x27; houses and murdered them. So, too, at Stamford Fair, on 7 March 1190, many were slain, and on 18 March, 57 were slaughtered at Bury St Edmunds. The Jews of Lincoln saved themselves only by taking refuge in the castle.

Isolated attacks on Jews also occurred at Colchester, Thetford, and Ospringe.

A significant loss of life occurred at York on the night of 16 March (Shabbat HaGadol, the Shabbat before Passover) and 17 March 1190. As crusaders prepared to leave on the Third Crusade, religious fervour resulted in several incidents of anti-Jewish violence. Josce of York, the leader of the Jews in York, asked the warden of York Castle to receive them with their wives and children, and they were accepted into Clifford&#x27;s Tower. However, the tower was besieged by the mob of crusaders, demanding that the Jews convert to Christianity and be baptized. Trapped in the castle, the Jews were advised by their religious leader, Rabbi Yomtov of Joigny, to kill themselves rather than convert; Josce began by slaying his wife Anna and his two children, and then was killed by Yomtov. The father of each family killed his wife and children, before Yomtov and Josce set fire to the wooden keep, killing themselves. The handful of Jews who did not kill themselves died in the fire, or were murdered by rioters. Around 150 people are thought to have been killed in the incident.

==Ordinance of the Jewry, 1194==
During Richard&#x27;s absence in the Holy Land and during his captivity, the Jews of England were harassed by William de Longchamp. The Jewish community was forced to contribute 5,000 marks toward the king&#x27;s ransom, more than three times as much as the contribution of the City of London.

On his return, Richard determined to organise the Jewish community in order to ensure that he should no longer be defrauded of his just dues as universal legatee of the Jewry by any such outbreaks as those that occurred after his coronation. Richard accordingly decided, in 1194, that records should be kept by royal officials of all the transactions of the Jews, without which such transactions would not be legal.

Every debt was to be entered upon a chirograph, one part of which was to be kept by the Jewish creditor, and the other preserved in a chest to which only special officials should have access. By this means the king could at any time ascertain the property of any Jew in the land; and no destruction of the bond held by a Jew could release the creditor from his indebtedness.

This &quot;Ordinance of the Jewry&quot; was, in practice, the beginning of the office of Exchequer of the Jews, which made all the transactions of the English Jewry liable to taxation by the King of England, who thus became a sleeping partner in all the transactions of Jewish money lending. The king besides demanded two bezants in the pound, that is, 10 per cent, of all sums recovered by the Jews with the aid of his courts.

At this point in time Jews had many of the same rights as gentile citizens. However, their loans could be recovered at law, whereas the Christian money lender could not recover more than his original loan. They were in direct relation to the king and his courts; but this did not imply any arbitrary power of the king to tax them or to take their money without repayment, as is frequently exemplified in the pipe rolls.

==Leadership of the Chief Rabbis, 13th century==
Jews were allowed to have their own jurisdiction, and there is evidence of their having a &quot;beth din&quot; with three judges. Reference is made to the &quot;parnas&quot; (president) and &quot;gabbai&quot; (treasurer), of the congregation, and to scribes and chirographers. A complete system of education seems to have been in vogue.

At the head of the Jewish community was placed a chief rabbi, known as &quot;the presbyter of all the Jews of England&quot;; he appears to have been selected by the Jews themselves, who were granted a congé d&#x27;élire by the king. The latter claimed, however, the right of confirmation, as in the case of bishops. The Jewish presbyter was indeed in a measure a royal official, holding the position of adviser, as regards Jewish law, to the Exchequer of the Jews, as the English legal system admitted the validity of Jewish law in its proper sphere as much as it did that of the canon law.

Six presbyters are known in the 13th century: Jacob of London, reappointed 1200; Josce of London, 1207; Aaron of York, 1237; Elyas of London, 1243; Hagin fil Cresse, 1257; and Cresse fil Mosse.

==Under John, 1205–1216==
As early as 1198 Pope Innocent III had written to all Christian princes, including Richard of England, calling upon them to compel the remission of all usury demanded by Jews from Christians. This would render the Jewish community&#x27;s very existence impossible.

On 15 July 1205, the pope laid down the principle that Jews were doomed to perpetual servitude because they had crucified Jesus. In England the secular power soon followed the initiative of the Church. John, having become indebted to the Jewish community while in Ireland, at first treated Jews with a show of forbearance. He confirmed the charter of Rabbi Josce and his sons, and made it apply to all the Jews of England; he wrote a sharp remonstrance to the mayor of London against the attacks that were continually being made upon the Jews of that city, alone of all the cities of England. He reappointed one Jacob archpriest of all the English Jews (12 July 1199).

But with the loss of Normandy in 1205 a new spirit seems to have come over the attitude of John to his Jews. In the height of his triumph over the pope, he demanded the sum of no less than £100,000 from the religious houses of England, and 66,000 marks from the Jews (1210). One of the latter, Abraham of Bristol, who refused to pay his quota of 10,000 marks, had, by order of the king, seven of his teeth extracted, one a day, until he was willing to disgorge.

Though John squeezed as much as he could out of the Jewish community, they were an important element on his side in the triangular struggle between king, barons, and municipalities which makes up the constitutional history of England during his reign and that of his son. Even in the Magna Carta, clauses were inserted preventing the king or his Jewish subjects from obtaining interest during the minority of an heir.

==Increasing persecution, 13th century==

With the accession of Henry III (1216) the position of the Jews became somewhat easier, but only for a short time. Innocent III had in the preceding year caused the Fourth Council of the Lateran to pass the law enforcing the Badge upon the Jews; and in 1218 Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, brought it into operation in England, the badge taking the form of an oblong white patch of two finger-lengths by four. The action of the Church was followed by similar opposition on the part of the English boroughs.

Petitions were accordingly sent to the king in many instances to remove his Jews from the boroughs, and they were expelled from Bury St. Edmunds in 1190, Newcastle in 1234, Wycombe in 1235, Southampton in 1236, Berkhamsted in 1242, Newbury in 1244. Simon de Montfort issued an edict to expel the Jewish population from Leicester in 1231, &quot;in my time or in the time of any of my heirs to the end of the world&quot;. He justified his action as being &quot;for the good of my soul, and for the souls of my ancestors and successors&quot;. The Jews appear to have found refuge in the suburbs outside his control.

The Papacy continued to develop its theological commitment to restrictions on Judaism and Jews. In England, a number of Benedictine priories showed particular hostility to Jews, or sought to capitalize on it. The fictional stories of Jewish ritual murder, for instance, emerged from Benedictine priories, apparently attempting to set competing local cults. In Worcester, Bishop William de Blois pushed for tighter restrictions on Jews, writing to Pope Gregory IX for assistance in enforcing segregation between Jews and Christians, including wearing of badges and prohibitions on Christians working for Jews especially within their homes.

The value of the Jewish community to the royal treasury had become considerably lessened during the 13th century through two circumstances: the king&#x27;s income from other sources had continually increased, and the contributions of the Jews had decreased both absolutely and relatively. Besides this, the king had found other sources from which to obtain loans. Italian merchants, &quot;pope&#x27;s usurers&quot; as they were called, supplied him with money, at times on the security of the Jewry. By the contraction of the area in which Jews were permitted to exercise their money-lending activity their means of profit were lessened, while the king by his continuous exactions prevented the automatic growth of interest.

By the middle of the 13th century the Jews of England, like those of the Continent, had become chattels of the king. There appeared to be no limit to the exactions he could impose upon them, though it was obviously against his own interest to deprive them entirely of capital, without which they could not gain for him interest. The great financial pressure Henry placed on the Jews caused them to force repayment of loans to the sale of bonds, fueling anti-Jewish resentment. Taxation of 20,000 marks in 1241, £40,000 in 1244, £50,000 twice in 1250, meant that taxation in 1240–1255 amounted to triple the taxation raised in 1221–1239. Bonds were seized for a fraction of their value when cash payments could not be met, resulting in land wealth being transferred to courtiers. Jewish bonds were purchased and used by richer Barons and members of Henry III&#x27;s royal circle as a means to acquire lands of lesser landholders, through payment defaults. Licoricia of Winchester is an example of a Jew who was forced to contribute £2,500, towards the construction of the Edward the Confessor shrine in Westminster Abbey, in addition to 5,000 marks taken from the estate of her husband David of Oxford on his death in 1244.

Henry had built the &quot;Domus Conversorum&quot; in London in 1232 to help convert Jews to Christianity, and efforts intensified after 1239. As many as 10 percent of the Jews in England had been converted by the late 1250s in large part due to their deteriorating economic conditions.

===Blood libels and Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln===

Many anti-Jewish stories involving tales of child sacrifice circulated in the 1230s–1250s, including the account of &quot;Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln&quot; in 1255. The event is considered particularly important, as the first such accusation endorsed by the Crown. In August 1255, a number of the chief Jews who had assembled at Lincoln to celebrate the marriage of a daughter of Berechiah de Nicole were seized on a charge of having murdered a boy named Hugh. Henry intervened to order the execution of Copin, who had confessed to the murder in return for his life, and removed 91 Jews to the Tower of London. 18 were executed, and their property expropriated by the Crown. The king had mortgaged the Jewish community to his brother Richard of Cornwall in February 1255, for 5,000 marks, and had lost all rights over it for a year, Henry thus receiving no income from it except in the case of executions. The story was referred to in later English literature including Chaucer and Marlowe, and entered popular folk culture through a contemporary ballad. It was quoted as fact by Thomas Fuller in his posthumous 1662 book &quot;Worthies of England&quot;.

===Further restrictions and the Statute of Jewry 1253===
Henry III passed the Statute of Jewry in 1253, which attempted to stop the construction of synagogues and reinforce the wearing of Jewish badges (rather than accepting fines). A prohibition on Christian servants working for Jews was to reduce the &#x27;risk&#x27; of sexual contact, also prohibited. It remains unclear to what extent this statute was actually implemented by Henry. The laws themselves were following the Catholic church&#x27;s existing pronouncements.

In the later 1250s, as Henry was not fully in control over government, the Barons asked for limits on the resale of Jewish bonds. Jewish loans became a motivating factor in the following war. Henry&#x27;s policies up to 1258 of excessive Jewish taxation, anti-Jewish legislation and propaganda had caused a very important and negative change.

===Targeting of Jews during the conflict with the Barons===
While the level of debts to Jewish moneylenders was in fact lower in the 1260s than the 1230s, Henry III&#x27;s policies had made the landowning classes fear that debts to Jews would lead to them being deprived of their lands, which were used to secure loans. Excessive taxation of Jews, forcing them to collect no matter what the circumstances, was one factor in this. The other was the King&#x27;s support for courtiers and relatives who bought Jewish loans in order to dispossess defaulters of their landholdings. These were the fears that de Montfort and his supporters played on to bring support to their rebellion.

With the outbreak of the Barons&#x27; war violent measures were adopted to remove all traces of indebtedness either to the king or to the higher barons. The Jewries of London, Canterbury, Northampton, Winchester, Cambridge, Worcester, and Lincoln were looted (1263–1265), and the &quot;archæ&quot; (official chests of records) either destroyed or deposited at the headquarters of the barons at Ely.

Simon de Montfort, who in 1231 had expelled the Jews from his town of Leicester, when at the height of his power after the battle of Lewes cancelled the debts and interest owed to Jews of around 60 men, including those held by his baronial supporters.

Montfort had been accused of sharing the plunder but issued edicts for their protection after the battle. Nevertheless, his closest allies including two of his sons had led the violence and killing, so it seems implausible to regard him as ignorant of the likely consequences of the campaign.

===Later policies of Henry III===
Once de Montfort was dead and the rebels were defeated, Henry&#x27;s policy went into reverse and as best as he was able, the debts were reimposed. However, Henry&#x27;s finances were very weak, and he also wished to pursue the Crusade that he had tried to mount in the 1250s. Parliament refused to comply without legislation that restricted the abuse of Jewish finances, particularly by Christians. In 1269 Henry agreed to limits on perpetual fee-rents, an end to the sale of Jewish loans to Christians without the permission of the Crown and a prohibition on levying interest on loans purchased by Christians. These were the grievances that had helped fuel the wider crisis since 1239. In 1271 he conceded a ban on Jews holding freehold land and again ordered that the previous legislation be enforced. Nevertheless, these policies would not be adequate in allaying wider fears, which quickly resurfaced under Edward I.

In Lincoln, Henry III ordered for a man by the name of Jopin, who was accused of murdering and torturing an 8/9 year old Christian boy in a witchcraft ceremony, to be killed along with another 91 Jews and all to be sent to London. When the executions were ongoing in London, Richard, Earl of Cornwall stopped the executions while 18 had already died. Similar cases happened in London and Northampton in the 1260s and 1270s.

==Edward I and the Expulsion==

 Edward I is noted for his violence against the Welsh and Scots, but his reputation concerning the Jews is not well recognized. This has been a matter of controversy for scholars concerned with Jewish history, who see a blind spot in works of general history failing to explain his actions and prejudices. For contemporaries, however, his reputation was noted, and the events of the Expulsion even seen in a global context; for instance in the widely circulated &quot;Commendatio lamentabilis&quot; dedicated to him after his death, he was said to be greater than the Pharaohs for his expulsion of the Jewry.

Edward can be said to be the first English monarch to use anti-Semitism as an instrument of government policy. Prior to his reign, Kings had generally tried to preserve their ability to extract taxation from Jews, so had acted to limit violence and other attacks on them. Anti-Semitism had been utilised by opponents to the crown, rather than by the crown itself, but during the reign of Edward I anti-Semitism was &quot;deliberately deployed and developed in the interests of the English state&quot;. Edward began to take measures which were designed to focus discontent on Jews, or to take credit for acting against them; most significantly through the allegations of coin-clipping which labelled the entire Jewish community as criminals. He also appears to have taken a strong interest in specific actions taken against Jews, such as in cases of alleged blasphemy by Jews.

There is disagreement about the motivations behind some of Edward&#x27;s actions. It is possible to see some of Edward&#x27;s actions as purely financially inspired, including ultimately the Expulsion, which can be seen as primarily a concession to Parliament in return for grants of taxation. This tends to be the conventional view, but risks underestimating his own &quot;sincere religious bigotry&quot; especially when considering other actions made in the run up to the Expulsion.

Other questions of controversy include whether Edward&#x27;s attempts to convert Jews to Christianity or provide them with alternative employment to money lending when usury was banned were genuine. These can be interpreted as positive steps or as cynical actions that were certain to fail. It is difficult to know what was in Edward&#x27;s mind, as there is not a documentary record for it, other than official statements and justifications. It is also possible to infer the likely influences on him, from his relatives and advisers, many of whom were extremely hostile to Jews, such as Robert Grosseteste.

Edward&#x27;s restrictions on Jews took place in an environment where Church leaders, including figures like Thomas de Cantilupe and his successor as Bishop of Hereford, Richard Swinefield, were campaigning for harsher measures against Jewish communities. In this, they were supported by the Holy See, which through his reign, introduced progressively tougher calls to separate Jews from gentiles, through enforcement of the wearing of Jewish badges, and restrictions on social contact.

Jews were expelled from some towns, often where they had been long present. With Edward&#x27;s permission, they were expelled from the dower lands of his mother Eleanor of Provence in January 1275, which included towns such as Marlborough, Gloucester, Cambridge and Worcester. Other local expulsions took place in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Warwick, Wycombe (1234), Northamptonshire (1237), Newbury (1243), Derby (1261), Romsey (1266), Winchelsea (1273), Bridgnorth (1274) and Windsor (1283). Jews were banned from entering any of the new north Welsh boroughs created by Edward I under their town charters.

===&quot;Statutum de Judaismo&quot;, 1275===

 Edward I returned from the Crusades in 1274, two years after his accession as King of England. In 1275, he made some experimental decrees. The Church laws against usury had recently been reiterated with more than usual vehemence at the Second Council of Lyon (1274), and Edward in the &quot;Statutum de Judaismo&quot; (Statute of the Jewry) absolutely forbade Jews to lend on usury (their primary business), but granted them permission to engage in commerce and handicrafts, and even to take farms for a period not exceeding ten years, though he expressly excluded them from all the feudal advantages of the possession of land.

This permission to own land, however, regarded as a means by which Jews in general could gain a livelihood, was largely illusory. Farming can not be taken up at a moment&#x27;s notice, nor can handicrafts be acquired at once. Moreover, in England in the 13th century the guilds were already securing a monopoly of all skilled labor, and in the majority of markets only those could buy and sell who were members of the Guild Merchant.

By depriving the Jews of a resort to usury, Edward was practically preventing them from earning a living under the conditions of life then existing in feudal England; and in principle the &quot;Statute of the Jewry&quot; expelled them fifteen years before the final expulsion. Some of the Jews attempted to evade the law by lending money against goods to be received. Others joined the &quot;Domus Conversorum&quot; and a proportion left the country.

Despite the impoverished state of the Jews, Edward I continued to try to exact taxation. A talage was exacted in 1277 and 1278, the latter yielding just 3,000 marks. Threats were made to defaulters, including exile and loss of their property, but this meant little to the vast majority of Jews who were poor and unable to pay the sums demanded by the state. The Crown ceased demanding talages, a fact that Richardson calls &quot;significant&quot;. The community had run out of money.

In 1287–1288, yielding around £4,000 of a hoped for £13,333, it is likely that the Crown arrested the Jewish population prior to collecting the tax as a means of extorting as much as possible.

===Exploitation of Jewish debts by the Crown===

 From the 1270s onwards, the Crown stepped up the acquisition of land from indebted English landowners by forcing the sale of debt bonds held by Jews. Since the early 1200s, the Jewish community had been taxed well beyond its means, leading to a reduction in the capital the small number of rich Jewish moneylenders had to support their lending. Jews were also disallowed from holding land assets. To recoup against a defaulted debt, the bonds for the lands could be sold. Continued excessive tallages would force Jewish lenders to sell their bonds very cheaply to release their capital, which would be bought by courtiers, Edward and, most prominently, his wife Eleanor of Castile. Access to the purchase of Jewish bonds was in effect a form of royal patronage.

By the 1270s, this had led the Jewish community into a desperate position, while Edward, Eleanor and a few others gained vast new estates. Contemporaries, however, saw the problem as resulting from Jewish &quot;usury&quot; which contributed to a rise in antisemitic beliefs. Eleanor&#x27;s participation in &quot;Jewish usury&quot; and dispossession of middling landowners caused her to be criticised both by members of the landed classes and by the church. A spectacular example of an estate picked up cheaply can be seen in the release of Leeds Castle to Edward and Eleanor by William de Leybourne, which became a favourite residence.

Discontent built up about these transactions, and fed into the political demands made by the landowning classes for restrictions on the Jews, both financial and social. Concerns were also picked up by the church, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Peckham, writing to her to warn her against acquiring &quot;lands which the Jews have extorted with usury from Christians under the protection of the royal court&quot;.

===Coin clipping crisis===
During the 1270s and 80s, the Crown attempted to crack down on tampering with coins, by &quot;clipping&quot; the edges. The Crown organised arrests in 1276, and then further mass arrests of Jews in 1278. This took place in the context of diminishing tax returns from the Jewish community, while Edward was in extreme financial difficulties.

Approximately 600 Jews were imprisoned in 1278, probably representing nearly every Jewish head of household, as the Jewish population stood at no more than 3,000 at the time. 298 Jews were executed in London alone. Instructions to justices administering the process &quot;made plain that the proceedings were unequivocally anti-Jewish&quot; and extended their remit to blasphemy charges. There is evidence of Edward regularly briefing (&quot;viva voce&quot;) leading actors, especially regarding the seizure and disposal of property, but also regarding sentencing, including late in the process, to rein back the numbers being sentenced to death.

Overall, in the 1270–1290 period slightly more Christians than Jews were arrested, but nearly ten times more Jews were executed than Christians, indicating that &quot;religious prejudice was the crucial factor involved in the degree of punishment&quot;. In the short term, profits were made by the Crown from seizures and fines, but there was no improvement of the coinage itself; problems with the coinage persisted well into the 1300s.

Property from the condemned was forfeit, and anything that had been hidden or was dealt with after the trials was due to Queen Eleanor, who thereby profited extensively from the executions. An identifiable £16,500 was collected by the Crown in fines and sales of seized assets over a five year period.

===Intervention of the Church===

In Easter 1285, the Prelates, (senior church leaders) of the Province of Canterbury under Peckham&#x27;s leadership drew up complaints to Edward, two of which were regarding what they saw as lax restrictions on Jews. They complained about converts lapsing back to Judaism, and called for a crack down on usury, which although banned since 1275 under the Statute of the Jewry, they believed was still being practiced, asking that &quot;the Jews&#x27; fraud and malice be vigorously opposed&quot;. Edward replied that there was little that could be done,&quot;because of their evilness&quot;. In response, the prelates expressed their shock and stated that the Crown was permitting Jews to &quot;ensnare Christians through usurious contracts and to acquire the manors of nobles through the sink of usury&quot;. Edward was, they said, capable of stopping this &quot;perversity&quot;, and advised that &quot;through the threat of horrible punishments, which our lips will not name, he may strive to punish all userers&quot;.

Relations between Christians and Jews could be convivial, but was in theory at least heavily restricted, and a matter the church viewed as highly threatening. The Bishop of Hereford, Richard Swinefield, was outraged when in early summer 1286 when he heard that a Jew had invited local dignitaries to a wedding. First, he demanded that nobody attend, &quot;under pain of canonical discipline&quot;. The Jews, he said, &quot;have invited—not secretly but quite openly—some of our Christians in order to disparage the Christian faith of which they are the enemies and preach heresies to the simple people thus generating scandal by their intercourse&quot;.

When Swinefield was disobeyed, he threatened those who had attended the wedding with ex-communication, unless they repented and he was given &quot;satisfaction&quot;. He reported the whole affair directly to the Papal See, in part as he was at the time concerned with securing the canonization of his predecessor Thomas de Cantilupe. It is often believed that this correspondence led to Pope Honorius&#x27;s intervention demanding that restrictions on Christian-Jewish relations in England be applied rigorously.

Whether related to Swinefield&#x27;s complaints or not, in late 1286, Pope Honorius IV addressed a special rescript to the Archbishops of York and Canterbury claiming that the Jews had an evil effect on religious life in England through free interaction with Christians and called for action to be taken to prevent it. The Church responded with the Synod of Exeter in 1287, restating the Church laws against commensality between Jews and Christians, enforcing the wearing of Jewish badges and prohibiting Jews from holding public office, have Christian servants, or appear in public during Easter. Jewish physicians were also forbidden to practise and the ordinances of the Synod of Oxford of 1222 which prohibited the construction of new synagogues and the entry of Jews into Churches were restated.

===Expulsion of the Jews from Gascony===
Local expulsions of Jews were not new. They had happened frequently in many countries, and regularly in England. Edward would have been very conscious of these. In 1275, Edward had permitted the Queen mother Eleanor, to expel Jews from her lands, which included a number of towns with significant Jewish populations.

In 1287, Edward was in need of cash to free Charles of Salerno and ordered the local Jews expelled from the duchy of Gascony. This and other heavy expenses led to the need to raise revenues wherever he was able. As a result, some historians link the expulsion of Gascony&#x27;s Jews and the seizure of their property and transfer of outstanding to the King&#x27;s name to this need for cash. Others believe that the amounts raised were in fact small and note that they seem to have been distributed to mendicant orders in Aquitaine, and conclude it is more plausible to see the expulsion as a &quot;thank-offering&quot; for Edward&#x27;s recovery from illness.

Charles of Salerno himself expelled the Jews of Maine and Anjou in 1289, accusing them of &quot;dwelling randomly&quot; with the Christian population and cohabiting with Christian women. Understanding that he would suffer financially, he linked the expulsion to general taxation of the population as &quot;recompense&quot;. Huscroft speculates that Edward and Charles learnt from each other in the model of expulsion which Edward shortly after implemented in England.

===Expulsion, 1290===

 By the time he returned to England in 1289, King Edward was deeply in debt. His experiment to convert the Jews to Christianity and remove their dependence on lending at interest could be seen to have failed. Moreover, it was increasingly impossible to raise money from the Jewish population; they had been repeatedly overtaxed.

On 14 June 1290, he summoned Knights of the shires to attend Parliament by 15 July. Then, on 18 June, Edward sent secret orders to the Sheriffs of cities with Jewish residents that the &quot;archae&quot; containing records of Jewish debts be sealed.

 Parliament met on 15 July. Taxation granted by Parliament to Edward was very high, at £116,000, probably the highest of the middle ages, apparently in return for the expulsion of the Jews. The Church later voluntarily agreed to pay tax of a tenth, in gratitude.

On the Hebrew calendar, this date was 9 Av (Tisha B&#x27;Av) 5050, commemorating the fall of the Temple at Jerusalem; it is unlikely to be a coincidence, and was noted &quot;with awe&quot; by Jewish chroniclers. Writs were sent to Sheriffs on the same day, explaining that all Jews were to leave by All Saints&#x27; Day, 1 November 1290.

Proclamations were made ordering the population not to &quot;injure, harm, damage or grieve&quot; the departing Jews. Wardens at the Cinque Ports were to told to make arrangements for their safe passage. There were limits on the property that Jews could take with them. Although a few favoured persons were allowed to sell their homes before they left, the vast majority had to forfeit any outstanding debts, homes or immobile property, including Synagogues and cemeteries. 

 Henry wrote to the Barons of his Exchequer on 5 November, giving us the clearest official explanation of his actions available. In it, he claimed that Jews had broken trust with him by continuing to find ways to charge interest on loans. He labelled them as criminals and traitors, and said they were expelled &quot;in honour of the Crucified&quot;. Interest on their debts was to be cancelled.

Although it is believed that most of the Jews leaving England were able to do so free from harm, there are some records of piracy leading to the death of some of the people forced to leave. In October, a ship was chartered by poorer London Jews whose captain convinced the Jews to walk with him on a sandbank, and left them stranded on it. Other incidents of piracy and murder are recorded in Portsmouth and near Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex. 

 The condition of the sea in Autumn also led to deaths, as poorer Jewish passengers crossed the Channel to Wissant near Calais. Ships were lost at sea, others arrived with their passengers destitute. It is unclear where most of the migrants went. There are Anglo-Jewish names and documents recorded in France, Germany, Italy and Spain; including the title deeds to an English monastery found in the wood store of a synagogue in Cairo.

For the Crown, there was an immediate windfall in terms of Jewish property to be sold. Some of the property was given away to courtiers, the church and family, in a total of 85 grants. For example, Queen Eleanor&#x27;s tailor was granted the Synagogue in Canterbury. Property sales were mostly completed by spring 1291, and around £2,000 was raised. £20,000 worth of debts were seized, but barely anything was collected. The reasons for this are unclear, but could include an attempt to win political favour by providing benefit to those previously indebted.

Between the expulsion of the Jews in 1290 and their informal return in 1655 there is no official trace of Jews as such on English soil except in connection with the Domus Conversorum, which kept a number of them within its precincts up to 1551 and even later.

==Attitudes to the Jewry after 1290==
 Edward I continued to use the expulsion of the Jewry as a political tool after 1290. He took care to ensure that he was seen as a protector of Christendom from the criminality of Jews, for instance by sponsoring the cult of Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln, a child whose supposed murder and crucifixion by Jews had led to popular veneration. His own craftsmen rebuilt the shrine in the same style as the Eleanor crosses, and included memorialisation of Queen Eleanor and the Royal coat of arms; by which a &quot;more explicit identification of the crown with the ritual crucifixion charge can hardly be imagined.&quot; Hillaby believes that the Eleanor crosses and renovated shrine played a critical role in disseminating the &quot;Little St Hugh&quot; myth.

 The promotion of the cult of the former Bishop of Hereford Thomas de Cantilupe by Swinefield and Edward I also appears to have played a role in propagandising anti-semitic values well beyond the expulsion, including within the Hereford &quot;Mappa Mundi&quot;.

Longer term, it is often believed that English identity after the Expulsion held a strong strand of antisemitism, developing negative ideas of what Jews were, and what dangers they posed. Images of Jews are &quot;rife&quot; in devotional literature of the late middle ages including sermons and plays. Cohen writes that:
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries saw the proliferation of the Host-desecration story in England: in collections of miracle stories, many of them dedicated to the miracles of the Virgin Mary; in the art of illuminated manuscripts used for Christian prayer and meditation; and on stage, as in popular Croxton &quot;Play of the Sacrament&quot;, which itself evoked memories of an alleged ritual murder committed by Jews in East Anglia in 1191. 
Depictions of Jews and anti-semitic themes can also be found in literature from Chaucer through to Shakespeare&#x27;s time and beyond, albeit softened in comparison with the thirteenth century. Before the readmission of Jews, the idea that England was unique in part because it was free of Jews appears to have developed, feeding into an idea that English identity excluded Jewishness: &quot;between 1290 and 1656 the English came to see their country defined in part by the fact that Jews had been banished from it.&quot;

<text>The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America-College Retirement Equities Fund (TIAA, formerly TIAA-CREF) is an American financial services organization that is a private provider of financial retirement services in the academic, research, medical, cultural and governmental fields. TIAA is listed on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 100 and serves over 5 million active and retired employees participating at more than 15,000 institutions and has $1 trillion in combined assets under management with holdings in more than 50 countries ().

==Profile==
Long organized as a tax-exempt non-profit organization, a 1997 tax bill removed TIAA&#x27;s tax exemption. It is now organized as a non-profit organization, the TIAA Board of Governors, with taxable subsidiaries; all profits are returned to policyholders.

TIAA bought its Manhattan headquarters building, 730 Third Avenue, in 1955. It has major offices in Denver, Colorado; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Dallas, Texas; as well as 70 local offices throughout the U.S. In 2018, TIAA ranked 84th on Fortune&#x27;s list of the 500 largest corporations in America. , TIAA is the largest global investor in agriculture, the second-largest grower of wine grapes in the United States (by acreage), and the third-largest commercial real estate manager in the world.

==History==
In 1918, Andrew Carnegie and his Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, under the leadership of Henry S. Pritchett, created the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (TIAA), a fully funded system of pensions for professors. Funding was provided by a combination of grants from the foundation and Carnegie Corporation of New York, as well as ongoing contributions from participating institutions and individuals. The policyholders voted in 1921 to implement policyholder representation on the TIAA board so that educators would have a role in running the organization.
TIAA&#x27;s namesake and signature investment/insurance product is the TIAA Traditional, which offers a contractually guaranteed return on principal and, at the discretion of the board of trustees on a periodic basis, additional profit/dividend interest over and above the guaranteed return. From the relatively illiquid and stable, long-term investments of its general account, TIAA has been able to consistently add some dividends to TIAA Traditional contributions since 1948. 

=== Annuities and Real-Estate ===

In 1952, TIAA created the College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF) a variable annuity, in order to diversify its retirement funds.

In 1995, TIAA introduced the TIAA Real Estate account, also a variable annuity, but more stable than equity investments and more flexible than TIAA Traditional.

===21st century===
On June 15, 2007, TIAA became one of the first U.S. companies to voluntarily adopt, and the first to implement, a policyholder advisory vote on executive compensation policy.

On February 22, 2016, TIAA-CREF rebranded as simply TIAA as part of a new marketing and imaging campaign. CMO Connie Weaver explained that the old name was perceived by customers as being complicated, and that the new branding scheme was meant to portray a simpler and friendlier image of the organization.

, TIAA was providing parental leave irrespective of the parent&#x27;s gender.

====Environmental Impacts ====
In May 2021, TIAA announced its net zero by 2050 commitment for the General Account. In 2022, TIAA’s annual climate report, “Ensuring Our Future,” stated that TIAA views climate risk as investment risk. A November 2022 report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) asserts that TIAA’s failure to divest its fossil fuel holdings to clear its portfolio of financial and environmental risk is strategically unsound.

On October 19, 2022, nearly 300 TIAA clients filed a complaint with the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment initiative (PRI), asking PRI to remove TIAA from its list of sustainable investors. TIAA is one of the world’s largest fossil fuel investors, with at least $78 billion invested in coal, oil and gas industries. After the top two coal investors Vanguard and BlackRock, TIAA is the fifth largest holder of coal bonds worldwide with $6.7 billion invested in companies that mine, transport, and burn coal for energy. PRI agreed to review the complaint but dismissed it after internal review. 

In March of 2024, a group of TIAA clients and university student activists published their response to TIAA sponsoring the Big 10 while utilizing harmful investing practices. The activists stated that land grabs, the spraying of toxic chemicals, and fossil fuel investments are contributing to the climate crisis.

====Investments and diversification====
* 2012: bought Festival Place, a shopping center in Basingstoke, England for £280 million.
* 2013: purchased a 50% stake in the Grand Canal Shoppes, including the Shoppes at the Palazzo, in Las Vegas, Nevada, for net proceeds of US$410 million as part of a new joint venture with General Growth Properties. GGP will continue to oversee the asset management of the project.

* 2016: announced deal to buy EverBank Financial Corp. for $2.5 billion in cash; completed June 12, 2017. The combined bank&#x27;s legal entity name is TIAA, FSB.

Nearly a year after the acquisition of EverBank, TIAA began rebranding all of its banking activities under the TIAA Bank name on June 4, 2018. In November 2022, TIAA announced plans to sell TIAA Bank to private investors. TIAA Bank changed its name back to EverBank when the transaction was completed.

<text>Ambassador Auditorium is located on the historic Ambassador College campus in Pasadena, California, United States. The auditorium&#x27;s main hall has a capacity of 1,262 people. Some concertgoers call it &quot;The Carnegie Hall of the West&quot;. Ambassador Auditorium is a large chamber music-sized hall with large concert halls. It seats 1,262 people. This concert hall hosted 20 seasons of musicians and performers from 1974 to 1995.

It was built under the guidance of Herbert W. Armstrong as both a facility to be used by the Worldwide Church of God (WCG) for church services, college functions for the then adjacent Ambassador College, and as a concert hall for public performances celebrating the performing arts. It was officially opened by the Vienna Symphony Orchestra.

== History ==
After 2,500 concerts and recitals, the WCG, which operated the college and auditorium, ceased operation of both in the 1990s and sold the property. Under Joseph W. Tkach Sr., the performing arts series was shut down in 1995, saying they could no longer afford to subsidize the program and that it was not central to the mission of the church. The WCG later relocated its operations to nearby Glendora.

On January 26, 1996, National Public Radio staged a battle of the bands between the contending cities in Super Bowl XXX. Pittsburgh&#x27;s &quot;River City Brass Band&quot; played &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; by John Philip Sousa and the &quot;Battle Royal March&quot; by Fred Jewell in concert at Ambassador Auditorium, followed by a performance from Dallas at the Meyerson Symphony Hall.

On May 14, 2004, the church announced the sale of approximately 13 acres (53,000 m²) of its former 31-acre (125,000 m²) campus to Harvest Rock Church (HRC) and Maranatha High School. The sale included the Ambassador Auditorium, now under the sole ownership of Che Ahn&#x27;s HRock Church of Pasadena. Since the acquisition of Ambassador Auditorium, HRC has re-opened the venue to the public. It hosts many regional ensembles, including the Colburn Orchestra and the Pasadena Symphony. HRock Church&#x27;s services, conferences and special events are also held at the Auditorium along with Maranatha&#x27;s.

From 2010–2019, the Ambassador Auditorium surroundings underwent massive change as the original Ambassador College campus was parceled up and sold to developers who tore down most other structures on the campus, including the Fine Arts &amp; Science Centers, Hall of Administration, and the library, in favor of apartment and condominium structures.

<text>is a Japanese rock band, formed in 1973 by five musicians in Asahikawa, Hokkaido. After debuting in Tokyo in 1982, they became one of Japan&#x27;s most successful rock bands of the 1980s.

== History ==
=== 1970s: Beginnings ===
Formed in 1973 as the high-school garage band Invader in Asahikawa, Hokkaido, its original members included vocalist Koji Tamaki, guitarist Yutaka Takezawa and guitarist/keyboardist Toshiya Takezawa, who is also Yutaka&#x27;s brother. Later, in late 1973, Koji&#x27;s brother and drummer, Kazuyoshi Tamaki and bassist Takahiro Miyashita joined. In 1977, the band changed its name to Anzen Chitai (&quot;Safety Zone&quot;), and Kazuyoshi Tamaki left the group to be replaced by Ichiji Ohira. By December 1977, Anzen Chitai merged with another band, the , and added three more members: bassist Haruyoshi Rokudo, guitarist Wataru Yahagi, and drummer Yuji Tanaka. By this point, they had expanded to an eight-member group. Within the next three years, Toshiya Takezawa and Takahiro Miyashita left. Yuji Tanaka also left at this point.

=== 1980s: Commercial success ===
In 1981, they began work as a backup band for singer-songwriter Yōsui Inoue, and released their debut single, under the Kitty Records in February 1982. However, the final personnel change occurred as Ichiji Ohira left, and Yuji Tanaka returned in his place, establishing the current lineup.

Under the guidance of their producer and co-arranger , lead guitarist and vocalist of the psychedelic rock group The Mops, the band continued to refine their craft in the studio. Their status as a backup band soon changed: in 1984, reached No. 1 on the Oricon charts, to be followed by among others, &quot;Kanashimi ni Sayonara&quot; (悲しみにさよなら) and &quot;Suki Sa&quot; (好きさ) (featured on the popular Rumiko Takahashi anime series &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot;). &quot;Wine Red no Kokoro&quot; was composed by Koji Tamaki with lyrics by Yōsui Inoue. Koji Tamaki was credited as the sole composer in virtually all of Anzen Chitai&#x27;s music, with Gorō Matsui being the lyricist frequently. Their popularity in the 1980s culminated in a five-day sold-out concert tour at the Nippon Budokan in 1987, which had a total attendance of 60,000. They also held concerts outside Japan, including concerts in Hong Kong Coliseum.

=== 1990s and 2000s: Frequent hiatuses ===
Despite a couple of hiatuses for the sake of solo careers (July 1988 – March 1990, 1993–2001), Anzen Chitai continued to record and tour. A new studio album was released in October 2003, titled &quot;Anzen Chitai X&quot; (their tenth studio album). After their Japanese concert tour in support of the &quot;Anzen Chitai X&quot; album, the band announced at the end of 2003 that they are taking yet another indefinite hiatus.

In 2006, Koji Tamaki remained active as a solo performer and television actor, with Wataru Yahagi performing in both his solo albums and concerts. Yutaka Takezawa was also active in the music business as a composer, producer, arranger and session guitarist.

On April 28, 2008, fan club members were notified that Tamaki had announced his retirement from music, as well as the closing of the official Koji Tamaki &amp; Anzenchitai fan club, Star. Illness requiring long-term treatment was cited as the reason for as his decision.

During the second half of 2009, the band held secret meetings and decided to regroup. Similar to their amateur days, band members lodged together to practise and compose music.

=== 2010–present: Returning from hiatus ===
On January 8, 2010, the band announced the resumption of their career along with making appearance on the television program &quot;Tokudane!&quot;. Switching back to Universal Music Japan (which has absorbed their former label Kitty Records and is the distributor of their pre-Sony Music Japan catalog) as their record label, a music video for their new single &quot;Aoi Bara&quot; was released. Their double A-side single &quot;Aoi Bara/Wine Red no Kokoro (2010 version)&quot; was released on March 3, 2010. Tamaki wrote the lyrics and music of &quot;Aoi Bara.&quot; The single debuted at #9 on Oricon weekly charts, becoming their first Top 10 single in 21 years and 6 months since &quot;Hohoemi ni Kanpai&quot; in 1988.

Anzen Chitai released &quot;Anzenchitai XI Starts &quot;Mata ne...&quot;&quot;, their first album in nearly seven years, on May 26, 2010. They then released &quot;Anzen Chitai Hits&quot; on June 30, 2010. This album encapsulated the rerecorded versions of their singles throughout the 1980s. Their next studio album, &quot;Anzenchitai XII&quot;, was released on September 14, 2011, quickly followed by &quot;Anzenchitai XIII Junk&quot; just months later on November 16, 2011. The band&#x27;s fourteenth studio album, &quot;Anzenchitai XIV ~The Saltmoderate Show~&quot;, was released on March 16, 2013.

On December 23, 2022, it was announced that drummer Yuji Tanaka had died on December 17, at the age of 65.

<doc id="1042259" wikidata="Q738621" url="?curid=1042259" title="Landline">
<text>A landline is a telephone connection that uses metal wires or optic fibre from the owner&#x27;s premises also referred to as: POTS, Twisted pair, telephone line or public switched telephone network (PSTN). 

Landline services are traditionally provided via an analogue copper wire to a telephone exchange. Landline service is usually distinguished from other more modern forms of telephone services which use Internet Protocol based services over optical fiber (Fiber-to-the-x) or other broadband services (VDSL/Cable) using Voice over IP, although sometimes modern fixed phone services delivered over a fixed internet connection are sometimes referred to as a landline (non-cellular service).

== Characteristics ==
Landline service is typically provided through the outside plant of a telephone company&#x27;s central office, or wire center. The outside plant comprises tiers of cabling between distribution points in the exchange area, so that a single pair of copper wire, or an optical fiber, reaches each subscriber location, such as a home or office, at the network interface. Customer premises wiring extends from the network interface (&quot;NID&quot;) to the location of one or more telephones inside the premises.

A subscriber&#x27;s telephone connected to a landline can be hard-wired or cordless and typically refers to the operation of wireless devices or systems in fixed locations such as homes. Fixed wireless devices usually derive their electrical power from the utility mains electricity, unlike mobile wireless or portable wireless, which tend to be battery-powered. Although mobile and portable systems can be used in fixed locations, efficiency and bandwidth are compromised compared with fixed systems. Mobile or portable, battery-powered wireless systems can be used as emergency backups for fixed systems in case of a power blackout or natural disaster.

Other aspects of landline is the ability to carry high-speed internet popularly known as digital subscriber line (DSL) which links back to the digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) within the central office, T-1/T-3, or ISDN.

== Usage and statistics ==
In 2003, the CIA World Factbook reported approximately 1.263 billion main telephone lines worldwide. China had more than any other country, at 350 million, and the United States was second with 268 million. The United Kingdom had 23.7 million residential fixed home phones.

A 2013 International Telecommunication Union report showed that the total number of fixed-telephone subscribers in the world was about 1.26 billion.

In many parts of the world, including Africa and India, the growth in mobile phone usage has outpaced that of landlines. In the United States, while 45.9 percent of households still had landlines as of 2017, more than half had only mobile phones. This trend is similar in Canada, where more than one in five households used mobile phones as their only source for telephone service in 2013. However, voice over IP (VoIP) services offer an alternative to traditional landlines, allowing numbers to remain in use without being tied to a physical location, making them more adaptable to modern ways of working. The FCC maintains both landline and Voice over IP subscriber numbers to monitor long term trends in usage.

== Successors ==
===2000s===
In many countries, landline service has not been readily available to most people. In some countries in Africa, the rise in cell phones has outpaced growth in landline service. Between 1998 and 2008, Africa added only 2.4 million landlines. In contrast, between 2000 and 2008, cell phone use rose from fewer than 2 in 100 people to 33 out of 100. There has also been a substantial decline of landline phones in the Indian subcontinent, in urban and even more in rural areas.

In the early 21st century, installations of landline telephones has declined due to the advancement of mobile network technology and the obsolescence of copper wire networking. It is more difficult to install landline copper wires to every user than it is to install transmission towers for mobile service that many people can connect to. Some predict that these metallic networks will be deemed completely out of date and replaced by more efficient broadband and fiber optic landline connections extending to rural areas and places where telecommunication was much more sparse. In 2009, &quot;The Economist&quot; wrote &quot;At current rates the last landline in America will be disconnected sometime in 2025.&quot;

In 2004, only about 45% of people in the United States between the ages of 12 and 17 owned cell phones. At that time, most had to rely on landline telephones. Just 4 years later, that percentage climbed to about 71%. That same year, 2008, about 77% of adults owned a mobile phone. 

===2010s===
In the year 2013, 91% of adults in the United States owned a mobile phone. Almost 60% of those with a mobile had a smartphone. A National Health Interview Survey of 19,956 households by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released May 4, 2017 showed 45.9 percent of U.S. households still had landlines, while 50.8 percent had only cell phones. Over 39 percent had both.

In Canada, more than one in five of households use cell phones as their only source for telephone service. In 2013, statistics showed that 21% of households claimed to only use cellular phones. Households that are owned by members under the age of 35 have a considerably higher percentage of exclusive cell phone use. In 2013, 60% of young household owners claimed to only use cell phones. In 2019, 54% of Canadian households and 86.4% of German households. had a landline telephone.

===2020s===
In June 2020, it was reported that 60% of Australian adults used only mobile phones, with no landline. In 2021, only 14.5% of Australian and 29.4% of American households used landline at home. In contrast, 73% of UK households still had a landline connection in 2020 though this could be in part explained by broadband packaging practices. In 2022, 82.9% of German households had at least one landline phone while 73 percent of U.S. households had only a cell phone, 25 percent had a landline and cell service, and 1 percent had only a landline.

 Estonia and the Netherlands have retired the legacy parts of the public switched telephone network (PSTN). In the United Kingdom, the analogue copper landline network is due to be terminated in 2025. The VoIP replacement is known as &quot;Digital Voice&quot; (on a BT service) in the UK. France, Germany and Japan are also in the process of replacing theirs. 

By means of porting, voice over IP services can host landline numbers previously hosted on traditional fixed telephone networks. VoIP services can be used anywhere an internet connection is available on many devices including Smartphones, giving great flexibility to where calls may be answered and thus facilitating remote, mobile and home working, for example. VoIP porting allows landline numbers to remain in use, whilst freeing them from actual landlines tied to one location. This is useful where landline numbers are believed to be preferred by callers, or where it is preferable that legacy landline numbers remain connected.

<text>In electrodynamics, Poynting&#x27;s theorem is a statement of conservation of energy for electromagnetic fields developed by British physicist John Henry Poynting. It states that in a given volume, the stored energy changes at a rate given by the work done on the charges within the volume, minus the rate at which energy leaves the volume. It is only strictly true in media which is not dispersive, but can be extended for the dispersive case.
The theorem is analogous to the work-energy theorem in classical mechanics, and mathematically similar to the continuity equation.

== Definition ==

Poynting&#x27;s theorem states that the rate of energy transfer per unit volume from a region of space equals the rate of work done on the charge distribution in the region, plus the energy flux leaving that region.

Mathematically:

where:

* formula_1 is the rate of change of the energy density in the volume.
* ∇•S is the energy flow out of the volume, given by the divergence of the Poynting vector S.
* J•E is the rate at which the fields do work on charges in the volume (J is the current density corresponding to the motion of charge, E is the electric field, and • is the dot product).

=== Integral form ===

Using the divergence theorem, Poynting&#x27;s theorem can also be written in integral form:

where
*S is the energy flow, given by the Poynting Vector.
*formula_2 is the energy density in the volume.
*formula_3 is the boundary of the volume. The shape of the volume is arbitrary but fixed for the calculation.

=== Continuity equation analog ===
In an electrical engineering context the theorem is sometimes written with the energy density term &quot;u&quot; expanded as shown. This form resembles the continuity equation:

:formula_4,

where

*&quot;ε&quot;0 is the vacuum permittivity and &quot;μ&quot;0 is the vacuum permeability.
*formula_5 is the density of reactive power driving the build-up of electric field,
*formula_6 is the density of reactive power driving the build-up of magnetic field, and
*formula_7 is the density of electric power dissipated by the Lorentz force acting on charge carriers.

==Derivation==
The rate of work done by the electromagnetic field on the infinitesimal charge formula_8is given by the Lorentz Force Law as:
formula_9 (the dot product formula_10 because from the definition of cross product the cross product of v and B is perpendicular to v.
Where formula_11is the volume charge density and formula_12 is the current density at the point and time where formula_13 is the velocity of the charge dq.
The rate of work done on the whole charges in the volume V will be the volume integral
formula_14

By Ampère&#x27;s circuital law:
formula_15
(Note that the H and D forms of the magnetic and electric fields are used here. The B and E forms could also be used in an equivalent derivation.)

Substituting this into the expression for rate of work gives:
formula_16

Using the vector identity formula_17:
formula_18

By Faraday&#x27;s Law:
formula_19
giving:
formula_20

Continuing the derivation requires the following assumptions:
* the charges are moving in a medium which is not dispersive.
* the total electromagnetic energy density, even for time-varying fields, is given by formula_21

It can be shown that:
formula_22 and formula_23
and so:
formula_24

Returning to the equation for rate of work,
formula_25

Since the volume is arbitrary, this can be cast in differential form as:
formula_26
where formula_27 is the Poynting vector.

==Poynting vector in macroscopic media== 
In a macroscopic medium, electromagnetic effects are described by spatially averaged (macroscopic) fields. The Poynting vector in a macroscopic medium can be defined self-consistently with microscopic theory, in such a way that the spatially averaged microscopic Poynting vector is exactly predicted by a macroscopic formalism. This result is strictly valid in the limit of low-loss and allows for the unambiguous identification of the Poynting vector form in macroscopic electrodynamics.

==Alternative forms==
It is possible to derive alternative versions of Poynting&#x27;s theorem. Instead of the flux vector as above, it is possible to follow the same style of derivation, but instead choose , the Minkowski form , or perhaps . Each choice represents the response of the propagation medium in its own way: the form above has the property that the response happens only due to electric currents, while the form uses only (fictitious) magnetic monopole currents. The other two forms (Abraham and Minkowski) use complementary combinations of electric and magnetic currents to represent the polarization and magnetization responses of the medium.

== Modification ==
The derivation of the statement is dependent on the assumption that the materials the equation models can be described by a set of susceptibility properties that are linear, isotropic, homogenous and independent of frequency. The assumption that the materials have no absorption must also be made. A modification to Poynting&#x27;s theorem to account for variations includes a term for the rate of non-Ohmic absorption in a material, which can be calculated by a simplified approximation based on the Drude model.

formula_28

== Complex Poynting vector theorem ==

This form of the theorem is useful in Antenna theory, where one has often to consider harmonic fields propagating in the space.
In this case, using phasor notation, formula_29 and formula_30.
Then the following mathematical identity holds:
:formula_31
where formula_32 is the current density.

Note that in free space, formula_33 and formula_34 are real, thus,
taking the real part of the above formula, it expresses the fact that the averaged radiated power flowing through formula_35 is equal to the work on the charges.

<text>The London Broncos are a professional rugby league club based in Wimbledon, England. They play their home games at Plough Lane and compete in the Championship, the second tier of British rugby league.

Whilst the club has never won a major trophy, they have finished second in the League Championship once and have been Challenge Cup runners-up once. They have also won the Championship Grand Final, to gain promotion to the Super League, on two occasions.

Originally formed as Fulham Rugby League Club in 1980, they have also previously been known as London Crusaders and Harlequins Rugby League. London&#x27;s home colours are black and red.

==History==

===Origins===

Professional rugby league was briefly represented in London during the 1930s by London Highfield (1933), Acton and Willesden (1935–36) and Streatham and Mitcham (1935–36). All these were speculative clubs set up by local businessmen purely as money making exercises, and were ultimately driven out of business through poor finances. Thereafter, the sport of rugby league in England remained exclusively a northern based game for over forty years until the formation in 1980 of a new club in London, Fulham.

===1980–1991: Fulham R.L.F.C.===
In June 1980, Fulham Football Club chairman Ernie Clay set up a rugby league team at Craven Cottage, with the primary intention of creating another income stream for the football club. Warrington director Harold Genders, who had helped to persuade Clay of the potential benefits of establishing a rugby league club in the capital, resigned from the Warrington board to become managing director of Fulham R.L.F.C. The Rugby Football League (RFL), keen to encourage the expansion of the sport beyond its traditional northern heartland, accepted the new club at once. One of the game&#x27;s leading players, Reg Bowden, was recruited by Genders to act as player-coach and the club&#x27;s first signing was Roy Lester, on a free transfer from Warrington. Within nine weeks, Genders and Bowden had assembled a team of very experienced players, most of whom were approaching retirement, together with a few promising youngsters. 

The first match, on 14 September 1980, was a major success; nearly 10,000 Londoners attended the game at Craven Cottage to see the newly formed side convincingly beat highly regarded Wigan 24–5. On 15 February 1981, more than 15,000 were present to see Fulham take on Wakefield Trinity in the Challenge Cup, a club attendance record that still stands. The new Fulham RL team quickly proved to be very competitive and went on to win promotion at the end of their inaugural season. After that initial success, however, immediate relegation from the first division in 1981–82 was something of a reality check.

Fulham played two &quot;home&quot; games against Swinton and Huddersfield at Widnes in 1983 as the pitch at the Cottage had disintegrated in the wet winter following the collapse of the main drain to the River Thames under the Miller Stand.

The club also played several one-off games in 1983 at various football grounds around London; matches were played at Wealdstone&#x27;s Lower Mead stadium, Hendon&#x27;s Claremont Road ground, Brentford&#x27;s Griffin Park and Chelsea&#x27;s Stamford Bridge.

Despite winning the Division Two Championship comfortably in 1982–83, a second immediate relegation in 1983–84, coupled with continuing financial losses, saw Clay, under pressure from the Fulham football club board, pull the plug at the end of their fourth season. However, with the backing of supporters Roy and Barbara Close and the appointment of a new coach, former player Roy Lester, Fulham RL still had a future. Most of the existing players moved on as free agents, and a new squad began life based at the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre for the 1984–85 season.

After a single season, the club then moved to a new home at Chiswick Polytechnic Sports Ground in the summer of 1985, and would remain there for five years. Bill Goodwin replaced Lester as coach from 1986 to 1987. In August 1986, Fulham hit a serious cash crisis and were forced to withdraw temporarily from the RFL only 11 days before the start of the season, but were able to re-launch in September. Bev Risman was appointed coach at Fulham in 1987. The team was in the bottom half of the second division and continually struggled for success, and Risman left after a couple of seasons and Bill Goodwin returned. Phil Sullivan was coach for just two months between January and February 1989, thereafter Goodwin came in for his third spell and held the reins until May 1989 when Ross Strudwick was appointed.

The club returned to the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in 1990, this time making it their home for three seasons.

In May 1991, York and Fulham toured Russia.

===1991–1994: London Crusaders===
Prior to the start of the 1991–92 season the club&#x27;s name was officially changed from Fulham RLFC to London Crusaders RLFC. A slightly more successful period on the pitch begun at this point. Ross Strudwick was replaced as coach by Darryl van der Velde in 1992 but continued as club manager until 1993.

In June 1993 the club moved once again, from Crystal Palace National Sports Centre to Barnet Copthall arena. In November 1993, London Crusaders imposed a 20% pay cut on all staff to ease financial problems. With the club in financial straights, the RFL briefly took ownership of the Crusaders in 1993–94 to protect their southern outpost, but the club were then acquired by new owners Britannic Shipping; Strudwick stepped down as manager to give the club&#x27;s new owners a clean slate.

Despite the club&#x27;s financial problems, the team proved very competitive on the pitch under coach Tony Gordon and narrowly missed out on automatic promotion back to the First Division by a single point. The climax of the Crusaders&#x27; era was a May 1994 appearance in the Divisional Premiership Final at Old Trafford; although they lost 22–30 to Workington Town, the club had gone into the game with the knowledge that an exciting take-over bid had just been announced.

===1994–2005: London Broncos===

In the spring of 1994, just prior to the Divisional Premiership Final, it was announced that the successful Australian NRL club Brisbane Broncos was buying the London Crusaders club, which would be renamed London Broncos from the start of the forthcoming 1994–95 season. Gordon was replaced by a Brisbane coach, Gary Grienke. The first home game under the new Broncos moniker was against Keighley at Hendon F.C.&#x27;s ground at Claremont Road, though most home games were still played at Barnet Copthall.

For the 1995–96 season the club found another new home base, returning to south-west London at The Stoop Memorial Ground, home of Harlequins Rugby Union Club. Despite finishing fourth in the Second Division the previous season, London Broncos were selected by the RFL to be part of the radical new Super League competition scheduled to begin in the summer of 1996, on the basis that the RFL felt it was commercially essential for the sport&#x27;s national profile to have a team based in the nation&#x27;s capital. The regular 1995–96 season, deliberately made brief to accommodate for Super League, ran from August 1995 to January 1996 and saw London included together with the top ten teams from the 1994–95 First Division in a &#x27;Centenary League Championship&#x27;, effectively a &quot;dry run&quot; for Super League. Faced with much stronger opposition, London struggled and finished second from last.

The club moved once more prior to the start of the 1996 inaugural summer season of Super League, this time to south-east London to play at The Valley, home of Charlton Athletic, which is when current owner David Hughes initially became involved with the club. Former Brisbane Broncos coach Tony Currie was appointed to the role of head coach. The team performed far beyond initial expectations and eventually finished a highly creditable fourth, with Greg Barwick the top points scorer for the club. That season also brought the best London home attendances since the first season at Craven Cottage. Tony Rea retired from playing to take up the Chief Executive role at the club.
After only one season at The Valley, the club were on their way back to south-west London to play at the Stoop Memorial Ground again for the 1997 season. The second season of Super League saw an even greater improvement in the team&#x27;s performance, finishing a remarkable second to the eventual champions, Bradford Bulls. This represents London&#x27;s best ever final league position to date. Richard Branson&#x27;s highly successful Virgin Group became the majority shareholders and primary sponsors of the club, and the immediate future looked very bright. Highlights that year included victories at the Stoop over Canberra in the World Club Challenge and comprehensive league victories against Bradford and Wigan.

In 1998, as part of rugby league&#x27;s &quot;on the road&quot; scheme, London Broncos played Bradford Bulls at Tynecastle in Edinburgh in front of over 7,000 fans. Success continued in 1998 with a first appearance in the Challenge Cup semi-finals, losing to Wigan. Head coach Tony Currie left the club at the end of the 1998 Super League season and was replaced by Dan Stains.

In 1999, the club went one stage better in the Challenge Cup. Following a famous last-minute semi-final victory over Castleford, the Broncos reached the Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium for the first time, but despite taking a shock early lead in the game and performing bravely, they were soundly defeated 52–16 by red-hot favourites Leeds.

The club returned to the Valley for the 2000 season, but sacked Stains after enduring a long losing streak. Tony Rea was appointed temporary joint head coach with Stains&#x27; assistant Les Kiss. Rea and Kiss managed to steer Broncos out of the slump. In 2000, the experienced John Monie was appointed Head Coach. Monie only stayed in the job until the last month of the 2000 Super League season with the club having had mediocre results during his tenure. Rea took over as caretaker coach until the end of the season and Broncos eventually reached mid-table security. Rea then resigned his Chief Executive role at the end of the 2000 season to become Head Coach on a full-time basis.

York made an approach to the Virgin Group to buy the London Broncos in August 2001, with the aim of buying a Super League place for a proposed merged club to be based in York under a new name, York Wasps. This attempt was thrown out when Richard Branson rebuffed the offer as &#x27;ridiculous, and speculative at best&#x27;.

In 2002, fervent club supporter David Hughes purchased the majority shareholding from Virgin in a major restructuring of the club. The Broncos moved once again, to play their home matches at Griffin Park as tenants of Brentford FC. 2003 marked the club&#x27;s first Super League playoff appearance, losing in the first round to St. Helens 24–6 at Knowsley Road.

The 2005 season was marked by significant activity off the pitch as the club welcomed new chairman and majority shareholder Ian Lenagan who had bought 65% of the shares. This was followed by the announcement of a partnership with Harlequins Rugby Union Club that saw the club return to The Stoop Memorial Ground, this time formally renamed as Harlequins RL and adopting the host club&#x27;s kit and crest for the 2006 season.

===2006–2011: Harlequins Rugby League===
Ian Lenagan became the majority shareholder in the London Broncos in July 2005 and within a week of his arrival, the team was formally renamed &quot;Harlequins RL&quot;. Press releases of the time suggested that this would make the combined club &quot;a powerhouse in both codes&quot; according to Mark Evans of the Union club and provide a &quot;very, very strong future for rugby league in the capital&quot; according to Lenagan. The arrangement between the clubs was described as a &quot;long-term partnership&quot;.

At the time of the announcement there were many projected benefits of the two clubs sharing and pooling; both clubs were to play at the same ground and have access to the training facilities at the Richardson Evans Playing Fields, Roehampton Vale, though this was little more than a public park and not actually fit for a professional club of either code. In practice, there was no integration between the rugby codes, no joint player development, and the administrative and commercial resource sharing was little more than the RU club allowing the RL club some shared office space.

The sole integration programme appeared to be a combined fund raising lottery – which folded long before the Rugby League club permanently left the Twickenham Stoop – and two &quot;double header&quot; match days. These were in 2006, in which the Union side played first, followed by the League side, but the lengthy two hour gap between fixtures was a deterrent to the Union supporters and the majority had left the ground before the kick-off of the League fixture. Plymouth Albion and Leeds Carnegie were the Union opponents for the Union team whilst the Rugby League team played Huddersfield and St Helens.

On the field, the Harlequins RL club started with an encouraging 8,213 watching the home game against St Helens on 11 February 2006 but a heavy loss was followed by further consecutive home losses against Wakefield and Castleford, before a thumping 0–60 home defeat to Leeds. It was not until the fifth home game in the season that the team won at the Twickenham Stoop against Catalans Dragons in round 9.

Whilst the club started with a goal of 5,500 average home ground attendance by mid 2007. the actual attendance average was around the 3,500 level.

A 38–18 loss against bottom of the table Catalan, who were in their first year in Super League, was followed by a close home defeat to a Wigan team after each team scored. Harlequins were at this point 9th out of 12.

On 8 July 2006, Ian Lenagan removed Tony Rea as head coach, and moved him &quot;upstairs&quot; to a position on the club&#x27;s board of directors. In his place, Brian McDermott, an assistant coach at Leeds Rhinos, was appointed as head coach. Results at home improved, taking Harlequins RL to 7th place in Super League XI. 
The 2007 season saw the team pull off an incredible opening win against St Helens and by 7 July the team was 5th in the table, but a collapse in form in the second half of the season – a recurring theme of the McDermott reign – saw the team win only once from eight matches to finish 9th.

At the end of the season, Ian Lenagan took over control of fellow Super League side Wigan Warriors and was given two years to sell his Harlequins shares.

In 2008, Harlequins RL got off to a good start, winning six from the first ten games, but as was customary a second half of the season collapse saw the club won only five from the last seventeen games to finish in 9th again.

In 2009, the club was playing very well in the early part of the season, which extended up until 12 June with ten wins from sixteen, but yet again the rest of the season proved miserable with one win from 12 seeing the club slide from 5th position to 11th.

Home supporters were particularly displeased with the 0–48 home loss to Castleford and the 0–36 half time score v Bradford.

By round 12 in 2010, the club had won only one game from the first eleven and were bottom of the table, meaning that McDermott had seen the team win just twice in twenty three games, and at half-time away at Wigan the team were losing 24–6 before pulling off their finest comeback as Harlequins RL to win 38–26. That result seemed to spur the team into life briefly, with three more wins from the next four, but after that there was an end-of-season collapse to join the start-of-season collapse.

The round 25 game at Catalan saw the Quins bottom of the table with Catalan on a similar points tally and the game looked likely to decide who would finish bottom. The Quins were winning 16–12 with just a couple of minutes to go when Catalan were over the line with ball in hand, but Will Sharp stripped the ball from the Dragons player and Quins managed to hold out for the win.

The final game under McDermott saw Harlequins lose to Warrington at home; 7 wins from his last 38 games.

It was a shock to Harlequins RL supporters to see McDermott&#x27;s assistant take over but this bizarre decision seemed to be warranted as Rob Powell oversaw three wins from their first three matches, placing them at the top of the ladder.

Away wins at Leeds Rhinos and St Helens seemed to herald a new dawn, however, the club&#x27;s run of success was ended with a club record 82–6 defeat to Warrington Wolves on 20 March 2011 and the team were within a try of losing by the all-time Super League record margin of −80 held by Salford City Reds.

After that the Harlequins only won two more games in the next six months and the Harlequins RL era drew to a close when the club played St Helens in their final game under that name on 10 September 2011.

===2012–present: Return to London Broncos===
The club announced on 1 November 2011 that it would be returning to the London Broncos name from the 2012 season. In addition, the team unveiled a new logo as well as new colours of black, light blue and silver. On 4 February, London Broncos played their first competitive match against St. Helens since reverting to that name. The game was won by St. Helens 34–24 in front of a 4,924 crowd, which was higher than all of their attendances in the year before. In the match, seven players made their debuts for the club.

In the 2012 season, the Broncos played two home games &quot;on the road&quot; away from the Twickenham Stoop, on 6 June vs Bradford at Leyton Orient FC&#x27;s Brisbane Road, where they were narrowly beaten 22–29 in front of 2,844 fans, and on 20 June vs Hull F.C. at Gillingham FC&#x27;s Priestfield Stadium, as recognition for the work Medway Dragons had done in growing rugby league in Kent. The game proved to be popular with 3,930 turning up to watch London narrowly beaten 12–14 by Hull.

Tony Rea was appointed as the club&#x27;s head coach for a second time in August 2012 taking over from Rob Powell. In 2013, London Broncos used four venues for their home games with the majority being played at the Twickenham Stoop. On 8 June 2013, London once again played a home game at Priestfield Stadium, this time being heavily beaten 82–10 by Warrington in front of 3,041 fans. On 28 March, London had to play a home game at Esher RFC&#x27;s ground at Molesey Road due to a waterlogged pitch at the Stoop. For the next home game on 6 April, Harlequins RU didn&#x27;t allow London to use the Stoop due to a Heineken Cup game, forcing them to play Bradford at Adams Park in High Wycombe.

London Broncos had a successful Challenge Cup campaign in 2013, reaching the semi-finals for the first time since their Wembley appearance in 1999. In round 4, London beat part-timers Featherstone Rovers 24–12 and in round 5, defeated Bradford 25–16. In the quarter-finals, London Broncos beat part-timers Sheffield Eagles 29–10 to book a place in the semi-finals. On 27 July, London Broncos&#x27; dream of reaching the Wembley final for the second time came emphatically to an end with a televised 0–70 defeat by Wigan, a record score in a Challenge Cup semi-final.

On 29 June 2013, London Broncos announced the loan signing of Australian Jamie Soward until the end of the season. Soward quickly became a fans favourite with a man of the match performance on his debut v Salford (scoring a try and kicking five goals) and received a standing ovation from the crowd despite being defeated 30–44. Soward put in impressive performances in his short venture in England and in 9 games scored 67 points (5 tries, 23 goals, 1 drop goal).

The club&#x27;s financial struggles were made evident when, on 20 November 2013, the club announced that it would have to enter administration in ten working days if a new owner was not found. On 3 December 2013, London Broncos announced, &quot;The club will be instructing lawyers to file a further notice of intention to appoint administrators at court, which shall be effective for 10 business days&quot;. The club&#x27;s saviour David Hughes later decided to carry on putting millions into the club.

On 13 December 2013, London Broncos announced a move to the Hive Stadium in Canons Park, the new home of Barnet F.C., from the start of the 2014 season. After London lost 21 players from their 2013 squad, they faced a huge task to build up their squad again with minimal finances. The Broncos managed to retain twelve players from 2013 and in the off season signed 16 players (five on loan) including Tongan international fullback Nesiasi Mataitonga and former England international hooker Scott Moore. Tony Rea quit as coach following Broncos&#x27; 11-game winless start to the new Super League season. Assistant coach Joey Grima became head coach, having been asked to take charge for the rest of the season and next.Rea replaced by Grima at Broncos. Despite several closely contested games in 2014, the team struggled throughout the season against teams with far more strength in depth and much greater financial resources, and finished the season bottom of the Super League table, with only one win.

A supporters club (the LBSA) was founded in 2014 in order for fans to have a voice regarding their team. In July, at a pre-match lunch hosted by former Broncos Martin Offiah and Shaun Edwards, the LBSA announced its Hall of Fame, with six inaugural inductees: Reg Bowden, Peter Gill, Mark Johnson, Hussain M’Barki, Rob Purdham, Steele Retchless and Scott Roskell.

====2015–2018: Relegation to the Championship====
On 13 July 2014, London Broncos were relegated from the Super League to the Championship after a 72–12 loss to Warrington.

The capital club had competed in all 19 Super League seasons and this was the club&#x27;s first relegation since 1984 as Fulham RL and the first time the club competed in the second tier since 1995.

Relegation bought another mass exodus of players, with the club losing many key homegrown and non-homegrown players.

In the 2015 season, London Broncos had a poor season. Head Coach Joey Grima had issues with senior players like Foran, Cordoba, Mathers, Adamson and Lovegrove which meant that by about a third of the way into the season none were selectable. The club trained players went into the double digits that season but of them only Alex Walker and Matt Davis would be successful in the long run. As pressure built, Grima resigned leaving Andrew Henderson in charge. Henderson had too much to do and Broncos were a long way short of making the Super 8 play-offs that would have given them a chance of promotion back to Super League. However a surprise away win in the qualifiers at Dewsbury Rams saw the club make it to the Championship Shield Grand Final in Widnes but they were heavily beaten 36–4 by Featherstone Rovers.

In 2016, London Broncos moved to Ealing having signed a three-year deal to play at the Trailfinders Sports Ground, home of rugby union side Ealing Trailfinders. On 3 July, the Broncos beat Dewsbury 36–6 to secure a place in the Qualifiers against the bottom 4 Super League teams for promotion. Henderson signed Penrith Panthers playmaker Jamie Soward, who had previously played for the Broncos in 2013, until the end of the season. London Broncos finished 2nd in the Championship heading into the Qualifiers for a place in the Super League. The Broncos started the Qualifiers with a narrow 34–30 away loss to Leigh. London then won their first game in the competition, setting a record club score victory over Batley 76–16 at the Trailfinders Sports Ground. The following week, Henderson&#x27;s team put in a gutsy performance despite going down 28–42 to Leeds in front of a record rugby league crowd at the ground of 1,845 in front of the Sky Sports cameras.

In 2017 the Broncos again finished second and reached the qualifiers for a second consecutive year. The team put in several impressive performances including a close 38–40 loss against Warrington Wolves; lost by just two points against Catalans Dragons away and came within six points of beating Hull KR. However the last two games were both hammerings whilst Broncos also blew the lead against Featherstone to draw on the hooter and only actually beat Halifax. Shortly after the season finished Andrew Henderson, who had successfully managed the club through a troubled period, left to help manage Warrington Wolves.

Danny Ward was promoted to Head Coach and in 2018 the Broncos got off to a flying start with seven wins in a row to go first in the Championship table with five straight wins, breaking their previous record for the best start to a season with a 68–12 home victory over Batley Bulldogs. A mid-season slump saw the club needing an improbable sequence of results to make the play-offs but six wins and a draw from the last seven saw the club achieve exactly that and make Super 8s – the Qualifiers.

====2018–present: Promotion and subsequent relegation====
Following a strong 2018 campaign in the Championship, Danny Ward carried off the Championship Head Coach of the Year Award at the end of season awards dinner held at the Principal Hotel in Manchester. The Broncos finished second in the regular season and commenced their Super 8s – Qualifiers campaign with a one-point win over the Widnes Vikings in which Jarrod Sammut kicked a vital 79th minute drop goal to secure the victory. This good start was followed up with key victories over Salford, Toulouse and Halifax to leave the Broncos with 8 points in the Qualifiers table sitting in fifth behind the Toronto Wolfpack in fourth, which meant London faced the Wolfpack away at the Lamport Stadium in Toronto on 7 October 2018 to decide the final Super League place in the so-called &#x27;Million Pound Game&#x27;. London won a very tense and defensive game 4–2, thus earning promotion to Super League for the 2019 season. However, in spite of handing table leaders St Helens two of their three losses in the 2019 season, and several other notable wins against stronger opponents, Broncos were relegated after only one season back in the top flight, after losing their final game of the season to Wakefield.

With the entire 2020 Championship season cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the RFL advised the Broncos that their present ground at Ealing would be deemed as unsuitable for top level matches should they return to the Super League, so in December 2020 the club entered into discussions with AFC Wimbledon to groundshare at their newly built Plough Lane stadium in Wimbledon. The agreement was confirmed in mid July 2021 and the club played its first game at its new home in January 2022, a pre-season friendly against Widnes. 

In the 2022 RFL Championship season, London started poorly and for most of the season were in the relegation zone. The club managed to win four of their last ten matches in the league to avoid relegation and finish 11th on the table.
The 2023 RFL Championship season saw London finish 5th in the table and qualify for the playoffs. They would go on to defeat Sheffield in the opening playoff game and then beat league leaders Featherstone, who had finished 18 points above them in the regular season, to reach the playoff final. London would then go on to upset Toulouse Olympique in the Million Pound Game 18–14 to seal a spectacular return to the Super League.

London started the 2024 Super League season with ten consecutive losses where they conceded nearly 40 points a game. London earned their first win in round 11 against fellow strugglers Hull F.C., recording a 34–18 victory. Further victories came in an upset against play-off chasers Catalans Dragons and the return fixture against Hull F.C. The Broncos finished bottom of the table on the final day of the season, following a 0–54 defeat to Warrington Wolves, having entered the matchweek one point difference higher than Hull F.C. At the end of the season, David Hughes, who had owned the club for 27 years, announced he was walking away from the club. As of 14th October 2024, discussions and crowdfunding efforts are underway to save the club from closure and continue a professional rugby league presence in London. On 24 October 2024, London were relegated back to the Championship through the IMG grading system and were replaced by Wakefield Trinity.
In January 2025, London suffered a shock 17-10 defeat to RFL League One side Goole in the second round of the 2025 Challenge Cup.

==Stadium==
The Broncos have played home matches at numerous different grounds around London since the club&#x27;s original formation. In 2021 they hoped to move their home ground to Plough Lane stadium in Wimbledon, as tenants of AFC Wimbledon, looking to agree a ten-year lease with break and extension clauses. Until an arrangement to use Plough Lane was reached, the club continued to play at Trailfinders Sports Ground. The Broncos finally began play at Plough Lane in 2022.

==Colours and badge==

===Colours===
The original Fulham team wore an all black kit, with a broad white chevron, bordered with red, across the chest. As London Crusaders, the kit used the same colours, but in a variety of designs over the seasons. London Broncos wore red, yellow and blue also in a variety of styles, with red being the predominant colour for the last 5 years of their existence. When the club became known as Harlequins RL they adopted the colours of host rugby union side Harlequins. When the club returned to being known as the London Broncos, the home kit was black with a light blue trim and the reverse for the away kit. In 2015, the London Broncos reverted to their original Fulham colours, much to the approval of long-term fans, with their home kit being predominantly black with a broad white chevron and a red strip bordering the chevron. The away kit is predominantly red with a broad black chevron with white border. For the 2022 season, the club will play in blue and yellow, referencing the traditional colours of their new hosts in Wimbledon. The club have indicated that they will revert to black from 2023.

===Badge===
As Fulham RLFC, the club utilised the badge of the host football club, which at the time was the emblem of the local administrative borough, Hammersmith and Fulham. The first badge as London Broncos was a red and white crest with a horse&#x27;s head on the front with London inscripted on the top. This was worn, with some minor adjustments, until 2006 when the club became known as Harlequins RL.

As Harlequins RL, the club crest was the same as that of the host rugby union team. This was used up until 2011.

In 2012, the club reverted to the name London Broncos and created a new crest, based on the original Broncos badge but featuring a horse&#x27;s head in a modern stylised fashion, depicted in silver and blue.

<text>James Gorman Thomas III (born December 12, 1950) is an American former professional baseball player. He played Major League Baseball (MLB) as a center fielder and right-handed hitter. Thomas played in the American League (AL) with the Milwaukee Brewers (1973–76, 1978–83, 1986), Cleveland Indians (1983) and Seattle Mariners (1984–86).

With the Brewers, Thomas was one of the franchise&#x27;s most popular players. He was a leading home run hitter in the late 1970s and early 1980s, though he hit for a low batting average and frequently struck out. Thomas had good fielding skills and his throwing arm was strong until shoulder surgery in 1984, after which he became a designated hitter until his retirement in 1986.

==Early life==
Thomas was born in Charleston, South Carolina. His father, Gorman Sr, was a postal worker and a former minor league pitcher. Thomas was raised in nearby James Island. His family moved to Columbia, South Carolina where he attended Cardinal Newman High School through his junior year, playing on a state championship basketball team in 1968. He attended James Island High School his senior year. In high school, Thomas earned 14 letters in four sports - baseball, football, basketball and track. He was selected in the first round (21st overall) of the 1969 Major League Baseball draft by the Seattle Pilots, becoming the first-ever draft pick in the history of the team.

==Career==

===Milwaukee Brewers===
In 1971, Thomas played Class A baseball in the Milwaukee system with the Danville Warriors that year. Thomas led the Midwest League in both home runs (31) and strikeouts (170). The next year with the Class AA San Antonio Brewers, Thomas led the Texas League in the same two categories, registering 26 home runs and 171 strikeouts in 135 games.

Thomas spent parts of 1973 and 1974 in the major leagues with the Brewers, but he mostly played Class AAA baseball during those seasons. With the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast League in 1974, Thomas finished second in the league in home runs (51), third in RBI (122), fourth in walks (93), third in runs scored (117) and first in strikeouts (175). He spent most of the next two years on the bench with the Brewers, but he enjoyed being teammates with Hank Aaron during Aaron&#x27;s last two MLB seasons.

Thomas played in Class AAA with the Spokane Indians for the entire 1977 season, batting .322 with 36 home runs and 114 RBI in 143 games. After the season, Thomas was traded to the Texas Rangers as the player to be named later in an earlier trade for Ed Kirkpatrick. Rangers executive Dan O&#x27;Brien Sr. explained the move as a temporary &quot;friendship deal&quot;. Brewers general manager Harry Dalton needed to open up a roster spot over the winter, and he asked O&#x27;Brien to hold Thomas on the Texas roster for a few months. In February 1978, O&#x27;Brien sold Thomas back to Milwaukee before he appeared in any games with the Rangers.

Becoming an everyday center fielder for the Brewers in 1978, Thomas batted .246 with 32 home runs and 86 RBI in 137 games. In 1979, Thomas enjoyed his best MLB season, compiling career high numbers in home runs (45, first in the AL), RBI (123), runs scored (97), hits (136), doubles (29), walks (98), on-base percentage (.356), total bases (300), slugging percentage (.539) and OPS (.895). After the season, he finished seventh in MVP Award voting. Thomas was affectionately known as &quot;Stormin&#x27; Gorman.&quot;

In 1980, Thomas had another productive season, batting .239 with 38 home runs and 105 RBI while playing in all 162 games. Gorman followed that up by finishing second in the AL in home runs with 21 and being named to the AL All-Star Team in 1981. He finished eighth in MVP Award voting that year. In 1982, Thomas hit .245 with an AL-high 39 home runs (tying with Reggie Jackson for the league lead), and he recorded 112 RBI to help the Brewers win the American League East. The Brewers went on to win the ALCS and face the Cardinals in the World Series, where they lost to the Cardinals in seven games, with Thomas striking out against Bruce Sutter to end the Series.

While with the Brewers, Thomas opened a bar in Milwaukee with pitcher Pete Vuckovich. It was called &quot;Stormin&#x27; &amp; Vuke&#x27;s&quot;, a play on their nicknames.

===Trade to the Indians===
Thomas was dealt along with Jamie Easterly and Ernie Camacho from the Brewers to the Cleveland Indians for Rick Manning and Rick Waits on June 6, 1983. Thomas&#x27;s play had declined late in the 1982 season; he hit .181 after September 1, and he had only four hits in 41 at bats (.098) in the 1982 postseason. After the announcement of the trade, angry Brewers fans flooded the team&#x27;s switchboard with phone calls criticizing the transaction.

After the 1983 season, Thomas expressed his desire for another trade, saying that he did not feel comfortable playing in Cleveland. In 1983, he batted a combined .209 with 22 home runs and 69 RBI in 152 games with Milwaukee and Cleveland. Thomas had hit more home runs during the period from 1978 to 1983 than any other player in the AL (197).

===Later career===
On December 7, 1983, Thomas was traded to the Seattle Mariners alongside Jack Perconte in exchange for Tony Bernazard. Thomas played in only 35 games for Mariners in 1984, batting just .157 with a home run and 13 RBI before he underwent season-ending rotator cuff surgery in June. In spring training before the 1985 season, Thomas had some difficulty with the timing of his swing, but he was able to swing without pain and he was looking forward to assuming Seattle&#x27;s designated hitter role. Thomas was selected as &quot;The Sporting News&quot; AL Comeback Player of the Year in 1985, as he became the first player in Mariners history to hit 30 home runs in a season. He finished the season batting .215 with 32 home runs and 87 RBI in 135 games. However, Thomas began to feel alienated from his teammates. At a team tenth anniversary party, Thomas was left out of a 1985 Mariners highlight video. Mariners executives said they tried to trade him away but that there was minimal interest in Thomas because of his age and his limitation to the designated hitter role.

After Dick Williams took over as the manager in Seattle toward the beginning of the 1986 season, Thomas saw decreased playing time. By late June, he was hitting .194 with 10 home runs and 26 RBI in 57 games, and the team decided to release him. Thomas was making $650,000 that season and Mariners owner George Argyros had to absorb the loss of $361,000 that was still owed to Thomas under that contract. Thomas contemplated retirement, and he turned down a contract offer from the Detroit Tigers, but he signed with the Brewers a couple of weeks later to fill a designated hitter and pinch hitter role.

Thomas retired after the 1986 season. He was a career .225 hitter (.324 on-base percentage) with 268 home runs and 782 RBI in 1,435 games.

==Later life==
In retirement, Thomas played amateur golf and spent time hunting and carving duck decoys. In the early 1990s, he collected limited-edition prints and considered opening an art gallery. Thomas works under a personal services contract with the Brewers to make appearances in the community and welcome visitors to Gorman&#x27;s Grill at American Family Field. He was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 2003.

<doc id="1042272" wikidata="Q3554516" url="?curid=1042272" title="Vanessa Estelle Williams">
<text>Vanessa Estelle Williams, sometimes professionally credited as Vanessa E. Williams (born May 12, 1963), is an American actress and producer. She is best known for her roles as Maxine Joseph–Chadway in the Showtime drama series, &quot;Soul Food&quot; (2000–2004), for which she received NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series and as Nino Brown&#x27;s feisty gun moll, Keisha in the 1991 crime drama film, &quot;New Jack City&quot;. Williams is also known for her role as Anne-Marie McCoy in the first and fourth of the &quot;Candyman&quot; films, and as Rhonda Blair in the first season of the Fox prime time soap opera, &quot;Melrose Place&quot; (1992–93).

== Early life and education ==
Williams was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. Williams has three brothers and 1 sister. Her mother, Verdell, died when she was 10 years old leaving Williams to be raised by her grandmother, Johnnie Mae Mungen. Her father died in 2016. She has traced her ancestry back to Georgia and Virginia. After high school she went on to get a bachelor&#x27;s degree in theater and business management from Marymount Manhattan College.

==Career==
Williams later went to acting in films and television, In the area of acting, she ran into name conflict with singer/actress and former Miss America Vanessa Williams (also born 1963). Screen Actors Guild rules prohibited duplicate stage naming. Vanessa Estelle had registered the name &quot;Vanessa Williams&quot; first, so as a compromise, the former Miss America was occasionally credited as &quot;Vanessa L. Williams&quot; in acting credits. To compound the confusion, both actresses starred in versions of the drama &quot;Soul Food&quot; (Vanessa L. Williams in the film version, and Vanessa E. Williams in its TV series adaptation). The Screen Actors Guild eventually took the issue to arbitration and decided both actresses could use the professional name &quot;Vanessa Williams&quot;.

=== Television ===
Williams began her acting career in 1989, appearing in episodes of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. In 1992, she was cast as Rhonda Blair, the first and only black regular character, in the Fox prime time soap opera, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. She was written off after only one season for lack of direction. &quot;I think they didn&#x27;t make the effort to equip themselves [to write for a black character], either by hiring a black writer or asking me things,&quot; said Williams later.

She later had guest starring roles on &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; and &quot;Living Single&quot;, before she was cast as a series regular in the ABC legal drama, &quot;Murder One&quot; (1995–1996) created by Steven Bochco. She received her first nomination for an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her performance on the show. In 1996, Williams had a recurring role as Dr. Grace Carr in the CBS medical drama series, &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;, for which she received an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series nomination.
In 2000, Williams was cast as Maxine Chadway in the Showtime drama series &quot;Soul Food&quot;, a continuation of the successful 1997 film of the same name. Two other leads were played by Nicole Ari Parker and Malinda Williams. In the 1997 film, Vanessa L. Williams played the leading role of Teri Joseph, and Vivica A. Fox played Maxine. For her performance, Williams won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series in 2003, and received three additional nominations. The series aired to 2004 and went on to be the longest running drama with a predominantly black cast in the history of American prime-time television.

After &quot;Soul Food&quot;, Williams had guest starring roles on &quot;Cold Case&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot; and &quot;Lincoln Heights&quot;. In 2015, she was cast in a recurring role of Iris West&#x27;s mother in The CW drama series, &quot;The Flash&quot;. In October 2016, it was announced she was cast in the role of Valerie Grant on the NBC soap opera, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. In 2020, she was cast in a recurring role as Pippa Pascal in the second season &quot;The L Word: Generation Q&quot;, a role which she reprised for season three.

=== Film ===
In film, Williams is best known for playing Keisha in the 1991 crime thriller &quot;New Jack City&quot; opposite Wesley Snipes and Ice T. She is also known for playing Anne-Marie McCoy in the 1992 horror film &quot;Candyman&quot; opposite Tony Todd and Virginia Madsen. The following years she had small parts in &quot;Drop Squad&quot; (1994), &quot;Mother&quot; (1996), &quot;Punks&quot; (2000), &quot;Like Mike&quot; (2002), and &quot;Imagine That&quot; (2009) alongside &quot;Soul Food&quot; co-star Nicole Ari Parker. Williams has also starred in a number of made for television movies, including Emmy Award-nominated performance in &quot;Our America&quot; (2002). She also had roles in several smaller productions in recent years. In 2021, she returned to her role of Anne-Marie McCoy in the fourth film in the &quot;Candyman&quot; film series.

==Personal life==
Williams married Andre Wiseman in November 1992 when the couple eloped. The couple have two sons together: Omar Tafari (March 5, 1997) and Haile Zion Ali (born 2003). In April 2018, Williams filed for divorce from Wiseman for the second time.

<doc id="1042273" wikidata="Q6955250" url="?curid=1042273" title="NSA encryption systems">
<text>The National Security Agency took over responsibility for all US government encryption systems when it was formed in 1952. The technical details of most NSA-approved systems are still classified, but much more about its early systems have become known and its most modern systems share at least some features with commercial products.

NSA and its predecessors have produced a number of cipher devices. Rotor machines from the 1940s and 1950s were mechanical marvels. The first generation electronic systems were quirky devices with cantankerous punched card readers for loading keys and failure-prone, tricky-to-maintain vacuum tube circuitry. Late 20th century systems are just black boxes, often literally. In fact they are called &quot;blackers&quot; in NSA parlance because they convert plaintext classified signals (&quot;red&quot;) into encrypted unclassified ciphertext signals (&quot;black&quot;). They typically have electrical connectors for the red signals, the black signals, electrical power, and a port for loading keys. Controls can be limited to selecting between key fill, normal operation, and diagnostic modes and an all important &quot;zeroize&quot; button that erases classified information including keys and perhaps the encryption algorithms. 21st century systems often contain all the sensitive cryptographic functions on a single, tamper-resistant integrated circuit that supports multiple algorithms and allows over-the-air or network re-keying, so that a single hand-held field radio, such as the AN/PRC-148 or AN/PRC-152, can interoperate with most current NSA cryptosystems.

Little is publicly known about the algorithms NSA has developed for protecting classified information, called Type 1 algorithms by the agency. In 2003, for the first time in its history, NSA-approved two published algorithms, Skipjack and AES, for Type 1 use in NSA-approved systems.

== Security factors ==

NSA has to deal with many factors in ensuring the security of communication and information (COMSEC and INFOSEC in NSA jargon):

* Confidentiality: making sure messages cannot be read by unauthorized parties.
* Authentication: the validation of the source of transmitted messages.
* Nonrepudiation: making sure that transmitted messages cannot be forged.
* Traffic flow security: making sure an adversary cannot obtain information from traffic analysis, often accomplished by link encryption.
* Key management: getting keys securely to thousands of cipher devices in the field, perhaps the most difficult part of implementing an encryption system. One NSA goal is benign fill, a technology for distributing keys in a way that the humans never have access to plaintext key.
* Investigative access: making sure encrypted communications are accessible to the US government. While few would argue with the need for the government to access its own internal communications, the NSA Clipper chip proposal to extend this key escrow requirement to public use of cryptography was highly controversial.
* TEMPEST: protecting plaintext from compromise by electronic, acoustic, or other emanations.
* Tamper resistance, tamper-evident, self-destruct: ensuring security even if cipher devices are physically accessed without authorization or are captured.
* Meeting military specifications for size, weight, power consumption, mean time between failures, and ruggedness for use in mobile platforms.
* Ensuring compatibility with military and commercial communication standards.
* Electromagnetic pulse hardening: protecting against nuclear explosion effects, particularly electromagnetic pulse.
* Controlling cost: making sure encryption is affordable so units that need it have it. There are many costs beyond the initial purchase price, including the manpower to operate and maintain the systems and to ensure their security and the cost of key distribution.
* Enabling secure communication with allied forces without compromising secret methods.

== Five generations of NSA encryption ==

The large number of cipher devices that NSA has developed in its half century of operation can be grouped into five generations (decades given are very approximate):

=== First generation: electromechanical ===

First generation NSA systems were introduced in the 1950s and were built on the legacy of NSA&#x27;s World War II predecessors and used rotor machines derived from the SIGABA design for most high level encryption; for example, the KL-7. Key distribution involved distribution of paper key lists that described the rotor arrangements, to be changed each day (the &quot;cryptoperiod&quot;) at midnight, GMT. The highest level traffic was sent using one-time tape systems, including the British 5-UCO, that required vast amounts of paper tape keying material.

=== Second generation: vacuum tubes ===

Second generation systems (1970s) were all electronic designs based on vacuum tubes and transformer logic. Algorithms appear to be based on linear-feedback shift registers, perhaps with some non-linear elements thrown in to make them more difficult to cryptanalyze. Keys were loaded by placing a punched card in a locked reader on the front panel. The cryptoperiod was still usually one day. These systems were introduced in the late 1960s and stayed in use until the mid-1980s. They required a great deal of care and maintenance, but were not vulnerable to EMP. The discovery of the Walker spy ring provided an impetus for their retirement, along with remaining first generation systems.

=== Third generation: integrated circuits ===

Third generation systems (1980s) were transistorized and based on integrated circuits and likely used stronger algorithms. They were smaller and more reliable. Field maintenance was often limited to running a diagnostic mode and replacing a complete bad unit with a spare, the defective cipher device being sent to a depot for repair. Keys were loaded through a connector on the front panel. NSA adopted the same type of connector that the military used for field radio handsets as its fill connector. Keys were initially distributed as strips of punched paper tape that could be pulled through a hand held reader (KOI-18) connected to the fill port. Other, portable electronic fill devices (KYK-13, etc.) were available as well.

=== Fourth generation: electronic key distribution ===

Fourth generation systems (1990s) use more commercial packaging and electronic key distribution. Integrated circuit technology allowed backward compatibility with third generation systems. Security tokens, such as the KSD-64 crypto ignition key (CIK) were introduced. Secret splitting technology allows encryptors and CIKs to be treated as unclassified when they were separated. Later the Fortezza card, originally introduced as part of the controversial Clipper chip proposal, were employed as tokens. Cryptoperiods were much longer, at least as far as the user was concerned. Users of secure telephones like the STU-III only have to call a special phone number once a year to have their encryption updated. Public key methods (FIREFLY) were introduced for electronic key management (EKMS), which employed a commercial or militarized personal computer running MS-DOS to generate cryptographic keys and signal operating instructions (SOI/CEOI). An NSA-supplied AN/CSZ-9 hardware random number generator produced the needed random bits. The CSZ-9 connects to the PC through an RS-232 port and is powered by five D cell (BA-30) batteries. In later phases of EKMS, the random data functionality is included in an NSA key processor (KP). Keys could now be generated by individual commands instead of coming from NSA by courier.

A common handheld fill device (the AN/CYZ-10) was introduced to replace the plethora of devices used to load keys on the many third generation systems that were still widely used. Encryption support was provided for commercial standards such as Ethernet, IP (originally developed by DOD&#x27;s ARPA), and optical fiber multiplexing. Classified networks, such as SIPRNet (Secret Internet Protocol Router Network) and JWICS (Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System), were built using commercial Internet technology with secure communications links between &quot;enclaves&quot; where classified data was processed. Care had to be taken to ensure that there were no insecure connections between the classified networks and the public Internet.

=== Fifth generation: network-centric systems ===

In the twenty-first century, communication is increasingly based on computer networking. Encryption is just one aspect of protecting sensitive information on such systems, and far from the most difficult one. NSA&#x27;s role will increasingly be to provide guidance to commercial firms designing systems for government use. HAIPE solutions are examples of this type of product (e.g., KG-245A and KG-250 ).

Other agencies, particularly NIST, have taken on the role of supporting security for commercial and sensitive but unclassified applications. NSA&#x27;s certification of the unclassified NIST-selected AES algorithm for classified use &quot;in NSA-approved systems&quot; suggests that, in the future, NSA may use more non-classified algorithms. The KG-245A and KG-250 use both classified and unclassified algorithms.

The NSA Information Assurance Directorate is leading the Department of Defense Cryptographic Modernization Program, an effort to transform and modernize Information Assurance capabilities for the 21st century. It has three phases:

* Replacement: Replace all devices at risk.
* Modernization: Integrate modular programmable/embedded crypto solutions.
* Transformation: Be compliant with Global Information Grid/NetCentric requirements.

NSA has helped develop several major standards for secure communication: the &quot;Future Narrow Band Digital Terminal (FNBDT)&quot; for voice communications, &quot;High Assurance Internet Protocol Interoperability Encryption- Interoperability Specification (HAIPE)&quot; for computer networking and Suite B encryption algorithms.

== NSA encryption by type of application ==

The large number of cipher devices that NSA has developed can be grouped by application:

=== Record traffic encryption ===

During World War II, written messages (known as record traffic) were encrypted off line on special, and highly secret, rotor machines and then transmitted in five-letter code groups using Morse code or teletypewriter circuits, to be decrypted off-line by similar cipher devices at the other end. The SIGABA rotor machine, developed during this era continued to be used until the mid-1950s, when it was replaced by the KL-7, which had more rotors.

The KW-26 ROMULUS was a second generation cipher device in wide use that could be inserted into teletypewriter circuits so traffic was encrypted and decrypted automatically. It used electronic shift registers instead of rotors and became very popular (for a COMSEC device of its era), with over 14,000 units produced. It was replaced in the 1980s by the more compact KG-84, which in turn was superseded by the KG-84-interoperable KIV-7.

=== Fleet broadcast ===

US Navy ships traditionally avoid using their radios to prevent adversaries from locating them by direction finding. The Navy also needs to maintain traffic security, so it has radio stations constantly broadcasting a stream of coded messages. During and after World War II, Navy ships copied these &quot;fleet broadcasts&quot; and used specialized &quot;call sign encryption&quot; devices to figure out which messages were intended for them. The messages would then be decoded off line using SIGABA or KL-7 equipment.

The second generation KW-37 automated monitoring of the fleet broadcast by connecting in line between the radio receiver and a teleprinter. It, in turn, was replaced by the more compact and reliable third generation KW-46.

=== Strategic forces ===

NSA has the responsibility to protect the command and control systems for nuclear forces. The KG-3X series is used in the US government&#x27;s &quot;Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network&quot; and the &quot;Fixed Submarine Broadcast System&quot; used for transmission of emergency action messages for nuclear and national command and control of US strategic forces. The Navy is replacing the KG-38 used in nuclear submarines with KOV-17 circuit modules incorporated in new long-wave receivers, based on commercial VME packaging. In 2004, the US Air Force awarded contracts for the initial system development and demonstration (SDD) phase of a program to update these legacy generation systems used on aircraft.

=== Trunk encryption ===
Modern communication systems multiplex many signals into wideband data streams that are transmitted over optical fiber, coaxial cable, microwave relay, and communication satellites. These wide-band circuits require very fast cipher devices.

The WALBURN family (KG-81, KG-94/194, KG-94A/194A, KG-95) of equipment consists of high-speed bulk encryption devices used primarily for microwave trunks, high-speed land-line circuits, video teleconferencing, and T-1 satellite channels. Another example is the KG-189, which support SONET optical standards up to 2.5 Gbit/s.

Digital Data encryptors such as KG-84 family which includes the TSEC/KG-84, TSEC/KG-84A and TSEC/KG-82, TSEC/KG-84A and TSEC/KG-84C, also the KIV-7.

====KIV-7====
The KIV-7 is a National Security Agency Type-1, single-channel encryptor originally designed in the mid-1990s by AlliedSignal Corporation to meet the demand for secure data communications from personal computers (PC), workstations, and FAXs. It has data rates up to 512 kbit/s and is interoperable with the KG-84, KG-84A, and KG-84C data encryption devices.

Several versions of the KIV-7 have been developed over the years by many different corporations that have either bought the rights to build the KIV-7 or through corporate mergers.

*KIV-7 Speeds up to 512 kbit/s
*KIV-7 HS Speeds up to T-1 (1.54 Mbit/s)
*KIV-7HSB Speeds up to 2.048 Mbit/s
*KIV-7M Speeds up to 50 Mbit/s and supports the High Assurance Internet Protocol Interoperability Specification (HAIPIS)
(The National Security Agency (NSA) has established new High Assurance Internet Protocol Interoperability Specifications (HAIPIS) that requires different vendor&#x27;s Inline Network Encryption (INE) devices to be interoperable.)

=== Voice encryption ===

True voice encryption (as opposed to less secure scrambler technology) was pioneered during World War II with the 50-ton SIGSALY, used to protect the very highest level communications. It did not become practical for widespread use until reasonable compact speech encoders became possible in the mid-1960s. The first tactical secure voice equipment was the NESTOR family, used with limited success during the Vietnam war. Other NSA voice systems include:

* STU I and STU II — These systems were expensive and cumbersome and were generally limited to the highest levels of command
* STU-III — These telephone sets operated over ordinary telephone lines and featured the use of security tokens and public key cryptography, making them much more user friendly. They were very popular as a result. Used since the 1980s, this device is rapidly being phased out, and will no longer be supported in the near future.
* 1910 Terminal — Made by a multiple of manufacturers, this device is mostly used as a secure modem. Like the STU-III, new technology has largely eclipsed this device, and it is no longer widely used.
* HY-2 a vocoder for long haul circuits designed to work with the KG-13 key generator.
* Secure Terminal Equipment (STE) — This system is intended to replace STU-III. It uses wide-bandwidth voice transmitted over ISDN lines. There is also a version which will communicate over a PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) line. It can communicate with STU-III phones and can be upgraded for FNBDT compatibility.
* Sectéra Secure Module — A module that connects to the back of a commercial off the shelf cellular phone. It uses AES or SCIP for encryption.
* OMNI — The OMNI terminal, made by L3 Communications, is another replacement for STU-IIIs. This device uses the FNBDT key and is used to securely send voice and data over the PSTN and ISDN communication systems.
* VINSON A series of systems for tactical voice encryption including the KY-57 man portable unit and KY-58 for aircraft
* HAVE QUICK and SINCGARS use NSA-supplied sequence generators to provide secure frequency hopping
* Future Narrowband Digital Terminal (FNBDT) — Now referred to as the &quot;Secure Communications Interoperability Protocol&quot; (SCIP), the FNBDT is a replacement for the wide-band STE, which uses narrow-bandwidth communications channels like cellular telephone circuits, rather than ISDN lines. The FNBDT/SCIP operates on the application layer of the ISO/OSI Reference Model, meaning that it can be used on top of different types of connections, regardless of the establishment method. It negotiates with the unit at the other end, much like a dial-up modem.
* Secure Iridium — NSA helped add encryption to the Iridium commercial mobile phones after it rescued the bankrupt Iridium.
* Fishbowl — In 2012, NSA introduced an Enterprise Mobility Architecture intended to provide a secure VoIP capability using commercial grade products and an Android-based mobile phone called Fishbowl that allows classified communications over commercial wireless networks.

The operational complexity of secure voice played a role in the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. According to the 9/11 Commission, an effective US response was hindered by an inability to set up a secure phone link between the National Military Command Center and the Federal Aviation Administration personnel who were dealing with the hijackings. &quot;See&quot; Communication during the September 11, 2001 attacks.

=== Internet ===

NSA has approved a variety of devices for securing Internet Protocol communications. These have been used to secure the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), among other uses.

The first commercial network layer encryption device was the Motorola Network Encryption System (NES). The system used the SP3 and KMP protocols defined by the NSA Secure Data Network System (SDNS) and were the direct precursors to IPsec. The NES was built in a three part architecture that used a small cryptographic security kernel to separate the trusted and untrusted network protocol stacks.

The SDNS program defined a Message Security Protocol (MSP) that was built on the use X.509 defined certificates. The first NSA hardware built for this application was the BBN Safekeeper. The Message Security Protocol was a successor to the IETF Privacy Enhance Mail (PEM) protocol. The BBN Safekeeper provided a high degree of tamper resistance and was one of the first devices used by commercial PKI companies.

=== Field authentication ===

NSA still supports simple paper encryption and authentication systems for field use such as DRYAD.

=== Public systems ===

NSA has participated in the development of several cipher devices for public use. These include:
* Suite B: a set of public key algorithm standards based on elliptic curve cryptography.
* Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): an encryption algorithm, selected by NIST after a public competition. In 2003, NSA certified AES for Type 1 use in some NSA-approved systems.
* Secure Hash Algorithm: a widely used family of hash algorithms developed by NSA based on earlier designs by Ron Rivest.
* Digital Signature Algorithm
* Data Encryption Standard (DES)
* Skipjack: the cipher developed for Clipper and finally published in 1998.
* Clipper chip: a controversial failure that convinced NSA that it was advisable to stay out of the public arena.
* Security-Enhanced Linux: not strictly a cipher device, but a recognition that in the 21st century, operating system improvements are more vital to information security than better ciphers.
* The Speck and Simon light-weight Block ciphers, published in 2013.

<doc id="1042282" wikidata="Q4821830" url="?curid=1042282" title="Ault Park">
<text>Ault Park is the fourth-largest park in Cincinnati at 223.949 acres (0.9 km2), owned and operated by the Cincinnati Park Board. It lies in the Mount Lookout neighborhood on the city&#x27;s east side. The hilltop park has an overlook which commands extensive panoramic views of the Little Miami River valley.

The park is named in honor of Ida May Ault and her husband Levi Addison Ault, who was prominent in the development of Cincinnati parks. In the park&#x27;s early years, 97 sheep were employed to trim the lawns and shrubs.

The park sports a soccer field, playground, and an impressive flower garden, first designed by George Kessler and later modified by A. D. Taylor. At the center of the park is a large Pavilion, built in 1930 in the Italian Renaissance-style. The Pavilion is used frequently for dances, parties, and weddings.

==Public Garden==

In 1980 the Cincinnati Park Board asked its volunteer organization based out of Krohn Conservatory to implement an adopt-a-plot program for the Ault Park gardens, encouraging citizens to adopt a plot of the garden. The program was a huge success and in 1983 the park won the illustrious Daniel Flaherty Park Excellence Award competition. The adopt-a-plot program is still in use today and has become popular in parks over the whole country.

==Events==
Ault Park plays host to a large 4th of July celebration and fireworks display, as well as the Ault Park Concours d&#x27;Elegance (an invitational Antique and Exotic car display that is the second oldest of its type in the United States). During the summer months the park also hosts a summer concert series and an Annual Dance Night. On October 9, 2008 Democratic Presidential Candidate Barack Obama spoke to a crowd of approximately 15,000 people from atop the historic Ault Park Pavilion. Also speaking that day was Ohio Governor Ted Strickland.

<doc id="1042287" wikidata="Q899150" url="?curid=1042287" title="Campari">
<text>Campari () is an Italian alcoholic liqueur, considered an apéritif of the &quot;bitter&quot; variety (and not an amaro) by Italians while considered an apéritif of the amaro variety by Americans, obtained from the infusion of herbs and fruit (including chinotto and cascarilla) in alcohol and water. It is a type of bitters, characterised by its dark red colour. It is produced by the Davide Campari Group, a multinational company based in Italy.

==History==
Campari was invented in 1860 by Gaspare Campari in Novara, Italy. It was originally coloured with carmine dye, derived from crushed cochineal insects, which gave the drink its distinctive red colour. Campari Group discontinued the use of carmine in 2006.

In 1904, Campari&#x27;s first production plant was opened in Sesto San Giovanni, near Milan, Italy. Under the direction of Davide Campari, Gaspare&#x27;s son, the company began to export the beverage, first to Nice in the heart of the French Riviera, then overseas. 

The Campari brand is now distributed in over 190 countries. Campari is a registered trademark of Davide Campari Milano S.P.A., which is part of Gruppo Campari (Campari Group).

== Critics ==
As of December 2024, Campari Group continues to operate in Russia. Following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Campari Group announced the suspension of all investments in Russia, including advertising and promotional activities, and scaled down operations to the minimum necessary to pay its local staff. Despite these measures, Campari&#x27;s products remain available in the Russian market. In August 2023, reports indicated that Campari planned to introduce a new aperitif, Sarti Rosa, in Russia, suggesting a potential expansion of its product offerings in the country.

==Use==
Campari is often used in cocktails and is commonly served with soda water or citrus juice (most often pink grapefruit juice), often garnished with either blood orange or blood lime slice (mainly in Australia) or mixed with prosecco as a spritz.

Campari is an essential ingredient in several IBA official cocktails (of which Campari is a sponsor): the negroni, the Americano (which was named at a time when few Americans were aware of Campari), the boulevardier, and the old pal (removed from IBA list in 1987), as well as other drinks such as the Garibaldi. It is a common ingredient in spritzes, though other amari are also common.

In the Italian market, Campari mixed with soda water is sold in individual bottles as Campari Soda (10% alcohol by volume). Campari Soda is packaged in a distinctive bottle that was designed by Fortunato Depero in 1932.

==Ratings==
&quot;Wine Enthusiast&quot; has reviewed Campari on a number of occasions, giving it a score of &quot;96/100&quot; in 2023.

<text>The Type Allocation Code (TAC) is the initial eight-digit portion of the 15-digit IMEI and 16-digit IMEISV codes used to uniquely identify wireless devices.

The Type Allocation Code identifies a particular model (and often revision) of wireless telephone for use on a GSM, UMTS, LTE, 5G NR, iDEN, Iridium or other IMEI-employing wireless network.

The first two digits of the TAC are the Reporting Body Identifier. This indicates the GSMA-approved group that allocated the TAC.

Prior to January 1, 2003, the global standard for the IMEI started with a six-digit Type Approval Code followed by a two-digit Final Assembly Code (FAC).
The Type Approval Code (also known as TAC) indicated that the particular device was approved by a national GSM approval body and the FAC identified the company that had built and assembled the device (which is not always the same as the brand name stamped on the device).

Effective on that date, many GSM member nations and entities (mainly Europe) moved away from requiring that devices be approved by national bodies, and towards a system where device manufacturers self-regulate the device market. As a result, a manufacturer now simply requests an eight-digit Type Allocation Code for a new phone model from the international GSM standards body, instead of submitting a device for approval to a national review body.

Both the old and new TAC uniquely identify a model of phone, although some models may have more than one code, depending on revision, manufacturing location, and other factors.

==Public TAC databases==

The authoritative database maintained by GSMA is named GSMA Device Database and is only made available to partners. However, there are many public alternatives, though they will not be fully up to date.

The Osmocom project maintains a crowdsourced TAC database, which is CC-BY-SA v3.0 licensed and fully downloadable.

Some OEMs publish TAC data for their products:

==TAC examples==
== New Zealand RBI broadband service TAC lock ==

In New Zealand with the rollout of the government subsidized rural broadband initiative a way was required to prevent users inserting the rural broadband SIM cards in an unauthorized devices to get subsidized data rates.

The use of a TAC lock by the use of a customized SIM card with embedded TAC codes was devised. Several Type allocation codes can be stored in the SIM cards of the device to allow a group of provider-supplied Huawei branded 4G modems and block the use of unauthorized and third-party devices on the network.

A company wishing to resell Vodafone RBI is required to supply a device for the approval process and certification, and to supply One NZ with the TAC details of this device to embed into the SIM cards at the point of manufacture. A minimum order of 500 SIM cards is required.

<doc id="1042294" wikidata="Q4800040" url="?curid=1042294" title="Arthur Puttee">
<text>Arthur W. Puttee (August 25, 1868 – October 21, 1957) was a British-Canadian printer and politician. Puttee was the first Labour Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of Canada, sitting as Winnipeg MP from 1900 to 1904.

Puttee was a printer by training. Born in England, he immigrated to North America in 1888. He settled in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1891. He helped found the local trade union council, the Winnipeg Labour Party (WLP) and a left-wing newspaper called &quot;The Voice&quot;, which he edited from 1899 until 1918. He was also a founding member of Winnipeg&#x27;s first English-language Unitarian Church.

When Winnipeg&#x27;s Liberal MP, R. W. Jameson, died in February 1899, Puttee called for the nomination of a Labour candidate to contest the vacant seat in a by-election (which was finally held on January 25, 1900). The trade union council agreed, and with resources promised from local unions, selected Puttee to be its candidate, to run against Liberal E.D. Martin.

Puttee&#x27;s campaign benefitted from a serious division in the local Liberal ranks. Martin had been nominated by a minority faction in the party rebelling against Clifford Sifton, a powerful member of Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s Cabinet and the leading Liberal spokesman in the western provinces. Many Sifton loyalists unofficially supported Puttee against Martin. There was no Conservative candidate in the race; the Conservative organization in the city supported Martin.

Puttee ran on a platform promoting public ownership of &quot;all natural monopolies&quot; and other reformist measures. The basic issue of the campaign was whether labour had a right to have its own representatives in parliament.

In a narrow two-way contest, Puttee prevailed by a margin of eight votes (2431 to 2423). Puttee ran for re-election later that year in the 1900 election and won by a margin of 1,200 votes. Puttee again received unofficial Liberal support against Martin, who ran as an independent with Conservative support.

Puttee remained in Parliament until the 1904 election, when he was defeated. There were several reasons for this setback.

As an MP, Puttee came into contact with British Labour MPs such as Keir Hardie and Ramsay MacDonald and promoted the new British Labour Party (then known as the Labour Representation Committee) as a model to emulate. In doing so, he repudiated Marxists within the Winnipeg Labour Party, alienating the city&#x27;s more radical and revolutionary socialists. The WLP suffered a severe split, and many socialists and radical trade unionists left in 1902 to join the Canadian Socialist League. They ultimately formed the Socialist Party of Manitoba, which had a much more radical program than Puttee&#x27;s broad-based WLP.

A second reason for Puttee&#x27;s defeat was the loss of Liberal support, as the Sifton loyalists succeeded in nominating their candidate, D. W. Bole. The Conservatives ran William Sanford Evans, later a leader of the provincial Conservative Party.

The Liberals made strenuous efforts to appeal to the working class through the dispensation of patronage among leading trade unionists, and by attacking the trade union council as being radical and uninterested in the needs of ordinary workers. Puttee was painted as a dangerous &quot;revolutionist&quot; backed by &quot;assassins&quot;. Bole won the election; Puttee finished in third place.

Out of office, Puttee returned to his newspaper and continued to agitate for independent working-class politics. He became chairman of a new party, the Independent Labour Party, based on the British model. This ILP proved to be short-lived, collapsing in an internal feud after some of its members attempted to define the party as &quot;socialist&quot;.

In 1910, Puttee endorsed Fred Dixon as a candidate for the provincial legislature, and helped create the short-lived Manitoba Labour Party to support him. Dixon was defeated, due to opposition from the Socialist Party of Canada. Puttee also created a provincial Labour Representation Committee in the 1910s, and used &quot;The Voice&quot; to endorse labour candidates in the elections of 1914 and 1915. In 1918, Puttee helped to create the Dominion Labour Party, which was intended to consolidate labourist activities in various cities throughout the country.

Ultimately, Puttee&#x27;s conservatism sidelined him as the labour movement came under the influence of socialist ideas. He opposed labour militancy and the Industrial Workers of the World in particular. In 1918, the Winnipeg Trades and Labour Council withdrew its patronage of &quot;the Voice&quot; due to the paper&#x27;s moderate tone, and began publishing a new weekly, the &quot;Western Labour News&quot;, effectively ending Puttee&#x27;s influence over the labour movement.

By the time of the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919, Puttee was a marginal figure sidelined by younger, more militant leaders such as J. S. Woodsworth and Abraham Albert Heaps. He continued to operate in the city&#x27;s DLP organization, however, and his conservatism was a primary reason for a split in the party in 1920. Puttee sought the DLP&#x27;s nomination for Mayor of Winnipeg in 1920, but was defeated by Seymour Farmer. Puttee&#x27;s supporters subsequently asserted their control over the party, causing most of its leading figures (including Dixon) to separate and form a new Independent Labour Party. The DLP ceased to be an effective organization after this time.

Puttee ran for the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1922 in the riding of Winnipeg—not as a Labour candidate, but as a Progressive, aligned with the United Farmers of Manitoba. He does not appear to have put much effort into this campaign, and received only 135 votes on the first count, finishing 38th out of 43 candidates. Winnipeg elected ten members via Single transferable voting in this election, and Puttee was eliminated in the ninth count. 

Already in his 50s, he did not play a significant role in politics after 1922.

<text>AMR Corporation was an airline holding company based in Fort Worth, Texas, which was the parent company of American Airlines, American Eagle Airlines, AmericanConnection and Executive Airlines. AMR filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2011. The company emerged from bankruptcy on December 9, 2013, and at the same time announced that it would merge with US Airways Group to form a new company, American Airlines Group.

==History==

AMR Corporation was formed in 1982, as part of American Airlines&#x27; non-bankruptcy reorganization into a Delaware corporation, its name derived from American Airlines&#x27;s former ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1984, various subsidiaries previously owned by American Airlines merged and created AMR Energy Corporation; it was involved in creating oil and natural gas resources. In 1986, AMR announced that it would be acquiring Air California&#x27;s parent company, ACI Holdings, for $225 million.

In 1994, AMR succeeded in achieving profitability, after failing to produce it for three years in a row. Sustained work to reduce its supplier base has been identified as one contributing cause: in 1995, AMR obtained goods and services from 7200 suppliers, but reduced this number by 30% in 1996 and by a further 16% in 1997, achieving cost savings as a result of this consolidation.

In 1998, the company announced that it would sell three of its subsidiaries and focus solely on the core airline businesses. AMR purchased Trans World Airlines (TWA) in 2001, for $742 million. With the acquisition, American became the largest airline in the world and surpassed United Airlines.

On November 29, 2011, AMR Corporation filed for Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy with $4 billion of cash.

The decision came as the airline tried to &quot;achieve a cost and debt structure that is industry competitive and thereby assure its long-term viability and ability to continue delivering a world-class travel experience for its customers&quot;, the company said in a statement. American Airlines stated that despite the filing it was continuing normal operations. Chairman and CEO Gerard Arpey stepped down and was replaced by company president Thomas W. Horton.

American was the last of the remaining legacy airlines in the US to file for bankruptcy, and thus there are no remaining legacy carriers that have not taken advantage of Chapter 11.

The Air Transport Association group said that unofficial research states that AMR was the 100th airline company to go into bankruptcy protection since 1990.

On December 2, 2011, AMR Corporation was replaced by Alaska Air Group in the Dow Jones Transportation Average.

In February 2012 the company announced that in order to cut operating costs and boost revenue, it would eliminate 13,000 jobs, which amounted to 18 percent (including 15 percent management positions) of American Airline&#x27;s 73,800 employees. This was projected to cut 20 percent—$2 billion—of operating costs and raise revenue by $1 billion. Since 2001, accumulative losses of the company were $11 billion.

On February 1, 2012, Horton announced that they would be cutting 13,000 jobs and restructuring pension benefits, after losing $884 million in the first nine months of 2011 and $904 million in December 2011 alone.

===Merger with US Airways===
In January 2012, US Airways Group expressed interest to take over American Airlines, followed by the AMR CEO stating, in March, that American was open to a merger with US Airways. US Airways told some American Airlines creditors that merging the two carriers could yield more than $1.5 billion a year in added revenue and cost savings.

On 20 April 2012, American Airlines&#x27; three unions said they supported a proposed merger between American and US Airways.

In July 2012, American announced capacity cuts due to the grounding of several aircraft associated with its bankruptcy and lack of pilots due to retirements. American&#x27;s regional airline, American Eagle, stated it would retire 35 to 40 regional jets as well as its Saab turboprop fleet.

As of September 2012, American&#x27;s unions were looking to merge with another airline. Reports were the possible merger partners AMR was looking at were, US Airways, JetBlue, Alaska Airlines, Frontier and Virgin America. Indeed, in a July 12 court filing US Airways said it supported an American Airlines request to extend a period during which only American could file a bankruptcy reorganization plan (&quot;exclusivity period&quot;); in the filing US Airways disclosed that it was an American Airlines creditor and &quot;prospective merger partner. On August 31, 2012, US Airways CEO Doug Parker announced that American Airlines and US Airways had signed a nondisclosure agreement, in which the airlines would discuss their financials and a possible merger.&quot;

On February 14, 2013, AMR and US Airways Group officially announced that the two companies would merge to form the largest airline in the world. In the deal, which closed in the third quarter of 2013, bondholders of AMR would own 72% of the new company and US Airways shareholders would own the remaining 28%. The combined airline would carry the American Airlines name and branding, while the US Airways&#x27; management team, including CEO Doug Parker, would retain most operational management positions. Headquarters for the new airline was consolidated at American&#x27;s current headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas. AMR president and CEO Thomas W. Horton was replaced as CEO by the current CEO of US Airways, Doug Parker. Horton remained as chairman of the merged business, while US Airways president Scott Kirby became president of the merged company.

==Property==
AMR Corporation owns a five-story townhouse, London Residence LON6526, in Cottesmore Gardens, Kensington, London. As of 2011, it is worth $30 million U.S. dollars. Many large companies own or rent property for use of executives who are working abroad. When AMR Corporation requested Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, LON6526 was one of the eight owned properties the company declared. The airline purchased the complex in 1992 for £6.3 million British pounds (US$9.8 million). Nina Campbell, an interior designer, had renovated the property. An AMR spokesperson said that AMR may sell the townhouse. Richard Tilton, a lawyer with specialization in bankruptcy and the director of Sheldon Good &amp; Co., compared the property to the &quot;corporate jets that the executives at GM and Chrysler were forced to give up&quot;, and predicted that such &quot;symbols of corporate suite excess&quot; were unlikely to survive the Chapter 11 reorganization.

<doc id="1042298" wikidata="Q2664096" url="?curid=1042298" title="Mudd's Women">
<text>&quot;Mudd&#x27;s Women&quot; is the sixth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Stephen Kandel, based on a story by Gene Roddenberry, and directed by Harvey Hart, it first aired on October 13, 1966.

In the episode, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; pursues a vessel and rescues its occupants Harry Mudd, an interstellar con man, and the three mysteriously beautiful women he is transporting to become the wives of settlers.
This is the first of two episodes of the original series to feature Harry Mudd. He also appears in &quot;I, Mudd&quot;, the animated series (&quot;TAS&quot;) episode &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Passion&quot;, and in &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, as a recurring character.

==Plot==
The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, under the command of Captain Kirk, is in pursuit of an unregistered cargo spaceship. The ship overloads its engines in an escape attempt through an asteroid field. Kirk orders &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s shields extended around the other spacecraft to protect it until its occupants can be transported aboard &quot;Enterprise&quot;. This action severely strains the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s systems and destroys all but one of the lithium crystal circuits in the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s warp engines.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; beams the cargo ship&#x27;s three passengers and captain aboard, just as an asteroid impact destroys their spaceship. In the transporter room, the captain gives his name as Leo Walsh. The three women who accompany him are stunningly beautiful, and they distract the male crew members of the &quot;Enterprise,&quot; excluding Mr. Spock, whose Vulcan heritage makes him immune to female charms. The women are intended as wives for settlers on the planet Ophiuchus III and are introduced as Ruth Bonaventure, Eve McHuron, and Magda Kovacs. All three signed on with Walsh to escape a situation in which their marriage prospects were slim or non-existent.

Kirk convenes a hearing, during which the computer contradicts Walsh&#x27;s testimony, reporting that his ship master&#x27;s license has been revoked and forcing him to reveal his true name, Harcourt Fenton Mudd, a criminal with an extensive record. The hearing ends as the final lithium crystal fails.

Without lithium crystals, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; must limp on reserve power to the storm-plagued planet Rigel XII to obtain new crystals from the miners there. Ben Childress, the chief miner, having been in contact with Mudd, demands his release along with the women in exchange for the crystals. The &quot;Enterprise&#x27;s&quot; remaining power is insufficient to maintain the ship&#x27;s orbit for more than a few days, threatening a fiery reentry into the planet&#x27;s atmosphere, so Kirk is forced to allow Mudd and the women to beam down to the planet. However, once there Childress reneges on the deal.

At an impromptu party with the three miners, Eve becomes angry when they begin fighting over the other two women, and runs away into a magnetic dust storm, with Childress and Kirk in pursuit. Kirk beams back to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to try to locate them from orbit. Childress finds Eve, brings her to his quarters, and falls asleep. On waking, he is confronted with a much plainer Eve.

Kirk and Mudd beam back down to the planet to deal with Childress. The captain reveals that Mudd has been giving the women the Venus Drug, which creates a transient, illusory beauty, and that the other two miners have already been married to Ruth and Magda. As Childress confronts Mudd over the deception, Eve snatches a dose of what appears to be the Venus Drug, but is in fact a placebo. This restores her self-confidence to the point that Childress finds her as attractive as before. Pleased, he gives Kirk the replacement crystals. Kirk offers to take Eve away with him but she opts to stay with Childress. Eve tells Kirk, &quot;You&#x27;ve got someone up there called the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.&quot; The ship continues on its way, with Mudd in custody.

==Production==
The story was one of three submitted for production as the second pilot of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the others being &quot;The Omega Glory&quot; and the selected episode, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;. It was filmed as the second episode of the first season, after &quot;The Corbomite Maneuver&quot;.

Gene Roddenberry told Stephen Kandel he wanted a swashbuckling character as the guest lead. Several weeks later Kandel presented his idea, &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Women&quot;, and started to write the script but disliked that Roddenberry repeatedly rewrote it. Roddenberry took credit for Kandel&#x27;s story when screen credits were submitted to the Writers Guild for approval.

==Reception==
Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode an &#x27;A&#x27; rating, describing the character of Harry Mudd in particular as &quot;a familiar character type, but an enjoyable one&quot;.

In 2015, &quot;Wired&quot; suggested this episode was skippable in their binge-watching guide for the original series.

In 2016, TVLine ranked Eve finding out Kirk had given her a placebo rather than the beauty pill as number 13 on the top twenty moments of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;.

<doc id="1042306" wikidata="Q6186440" url="?curid=1042306" title="Jesse Hubbard and Angie Baxter">
<text>Jesse and Angela &quot;Angie&quot; Hubbard are fictional characters and a supercouple from the ABC and The Online Network daytime drama &quot;All My Children&quot;. Jesse is portrayed by Darnell Williams and Angie is portrayed by Debbi Morgan. Jesse first appeared in Pine Valley in 1981 as the nephew of Dr. Frank Grant, who assumed custody after the death of his sister (Jesse&#x27;s mother). Angie first appeared in 1982, as the daughter of a well-to-do Pine Valley couple. Shortly after Angie&#x27;s first appearance on the show, they were paired with one another, becoming the first African American supercouple in Daytime history. Jesse and Angie were best friends to fellow supercouple Greg Nelson and Jenny Gardner. They are arguably the two most popular African American characters in soap opera history and have been credited for improving African American representation in the genre.

Angie also appeared on &quot;Loving&quot; and &quot;The City&quot;. Along with her son Frankie Hubbard and former heiress Skye Chandler, she is one of only three individuals who have been regular characters on three ABC soap operas.


==Background==
===Casting===
Actress Debbi Morgan was working in Los Angeles, California, on an episode of &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot; when she saw that a new storyline was being introduced on &quot;All My Children&quot;, which involved actor Darnell Williams in the role of Jesse Hubbard. Morgan&#x27;s feeling that Jesse might need a love interest, as she expressed as much to her agent in New York, matched that of the show&#x27;s producers, who were searching for a young woman to fill the role of Angie Baxter. When Morgan read for the part, she acquired the role within the same day.

Williams was a regular dancer on &quot;Soul Train&quot; in the mid-1970s. Later that decade, he was a cast member of the Broadway musical &quot;Your Arms Too Short to Box with God&quot;. This, before acquiring the role of Jesse.

===Writing===
&quot;All My Children&quot; creator Agnes Nixon was able to intrigue male and female audiences of all ages by focusing on young adult romances that included not only romance and sex but their issues in growing and learning as individuals. Social issues were also applied. This specific formula caused &quot;All My Children&quot;&#x27;s popularity to rise in the 1980s. The Jesse and Angie pairing, as well as fellow supercouple Greg Nelson and Jenny Gardner, were one notable aspect of Nixon&#x27;s writing that prompted young high school and college students to race home just to view the soap opera.

When characters Jenny and Jesse were killed off instead of being recast by new actors once the actors decided to leave their roles, it was so that no other actors could portray them. To Nixon, these actors were the characters. Morgan saw Jesse&#x27;s death as bittersweet. She pointed to Williams leaving the series as one of her toughest moments as part of the cast, but how it also provided interesting story. &quot;It really affected me more from a personal standpoint than from an actor&#x27;s standpoint,&quot; she said. &quot;From a personal standpoint, Darnell and I were like hooked at the neck or the back or something; we&#x27;d gotten to be such good friends. But from an actor&#x27;s point of view, it didn&#x27;t really bother me as much because I knew that it would just open up so many more avenues for Angie to take.&quot;

===Jacob and Angie===
For years, &quot;All My Children&quot; fans clamored for the reunion of Jesse and Angie. However, the nature of Jesse&#x27;s death (an on-screen death in the hospital as the result of a gunshot wound) made this all but impossible, even by soap opera standards. Eventually, fans got the next best thing.

In 1993, Morgan joined the cast of the soap opera &quot;Loving&quot;, reprising her role as Angie (who settled in Corinth, Pennsylvania). In 1995, Williams joined the cast as a mysterious stranger named Jacob Johnson. Jacob, whose actual surname was Foster, bore an uncanny resemblance to Angie&#x27;s late husband Jesse and was revealed to be a relative of Jesse. Originally, Angie resisted any type of relationship with Jacob, despite her attraction to him. In 1995, Jesse&#x27;s spirit visited Jacob just prior to Angie&#x27;s marriage to Charles Harrison and convinced him to pursue a relationship with Angie. Angie and Jacob ultimately fell in love and emerged as the core couple when &quot;Loving&quot; was relaunched as &quot;The City&quot;, eventually moving to New York City&#x27;s SoHo district (along with Angie&#x27;s son Frank), marrying, and adopting a daughter.

After &quot;The City&quot; was canceled, Williams returned to &quot;All My Children&quot; four years later as &quot;Jesse&quot;, but as an angel.

===Rewrite and return===

In late 2007, the producers of &quot;All My Children&quot; announced Williams and Morgan&#x27;s return to the series, with long-term contracts. It was on December 14, 2007, that the official &quot;All My Children&quot; website posted an article with the headline &quot;Angie and Jesse return to All My Children!&quot; The article suggested that Angie&#x27;s return would start with being called back to Pine Valley Hospital to assist on a case, where she would be reunited with a living Jesse Hubbard. Viewers were skeptical of Jesse&#x27;s return, since he had an onscreen death and appeared in ghost form several times afterwards on the series. There was sentiment that if Williams was returning as anyone, it had to be as Jacob Foster. Viewers wondered for weeks if Williams would truly return as Jesse or Jesse&#x27;s look-alike Jacob. It was later confirmed, however, that Jesse did not die in 1988 after all and that Williams would be resuming the role.

Morgan returned as Angie on January 18, 2008, and Williams returned as Jesse on January 25. To start the storyline where Jesse is brought back, the writers thought up a plot where characters Greenlee Smythe and Quentin contract a weird woods-related disease that triggers asphyxiation. Angie, now an infectious-disease specialist, is paged to Pine Valley Hospital to consult on the case: &quot;Quentin will turn out to be Angie and Jesse’s son, Frankie&quot;, said Julie Hanan Carruthers (the show&#x27;s executive producer), and noted that Angie&#x27;s adopted daughter, Cassandra, would also join the show. ABC consulted with Agnes Nixon (retired at that time) on how to resurrect Jesse, since he was shot to death in 1988: &quot;We saw Angie sobbing on his chest, but I think the audience is invested enough in them as a couple that they will embrace our solution,&quot; Carruthers stated.

Carruthers further relayed that Angie would not at first know that Jesse is alive. &quot;We’re going to play that out for a couple of weeks. Rightfully, it’ll be Tad, to whom Jesse has appeared in spirit form, who reunites them,&quot; she stated. &quot;Angie and Jesse made an eternal imprint on viewers, and many fans will not believe he&#x27;s alive,&quot; stated Brian Frons, president of ABC Daytime.

When addressing his character&#x27;s &quot;return from the dead&quot;, Williams explained: &quot;I’m the same character, but it’s a whole new experience. They had to figure out a way to bring him back to life. The word is that apparently he never died. He had to fake his death in order to secure the safety of his family.&quot;

In the 1980s, soap operas were not as short as they are today on the inclusion of African American characters. &quot;I think it has moved a thousand steps backwards,&quot; said Morgan. &quot;It just amazes me that here we are in 2008 and we have so little representation on daytime. I don’t understand it and I think it’s shameful.&quot;

Williams detailed that the lack of diversity is one of the reasons they were approached to return to the series: &quot;I think &quot;All My Children&quot; kind of shot themselves in the foot by allowing the canvas to become so nondiversified. And they found themselves sort of chasing their tails trying to figure out how to fix it... They came up with the idea, &#x27;Well, why not bring this core couple back that had such an appeal to such a broad audience?&#x27;&quot;

Morgan stated that it took her only about 30 seconds to accept the offer to return to the role of Angie. She could not remember a time in her career where she felt so welcomed. &quot;It was like a homecoming. There were members of the crew that were here 20 years ago. It was just so heartfelt, it made me cry. I couldn’t believe it. I’ve played the character for so long, it’s like stepping into a pair of old shoes, as they say.&quot;

The response from fans after the announcement of their return managed to astound both actors. &quot;The amount of people that are interested still is kind of overwhelming,&quot; Williams stated. &quot;The first thing they usually say, &#x27;I&#x27;m going to call my mother and my sisters and my brother right away and tell them that &quot;All My Children&quot; is back on the block.&#x27;&quot; Williams relayed his hope for the writers to progress slowly in reuniting Jesse and Angie: &quot;I hope they take it at a decent pace to where the audience will believe it. If they go too quickly and make us a happily ever couple, that gets kind of boring. But I have faith that they are going to do the right thing.&quot;

Soap operas tend to have preposterous storylines at times, and Morgan stressed to the producers of the show that she wants none of that for Angie: &quot;Soaps have changed a lot since I was on, and so many of the stories are so over the top and crazy to me. The kind of actress that I am, I couldn’t play all that hokey kind of stuff. So I would really like to see the shows return to more real-life drama that’s akin to what goes on with people in their everyday life.&quot;

In January 2008, the Alicia Keys song &quot;Like You&#x27;ll Never See Me Again&quot; was used in advertisements for &quot;All My Children&quot;, to promote Jesse and Angie&#x27;s return. The song was used again in the February 15 and 18, 2008 episodes of the series, when the couple was reunited after 20 years.

==Storyline==
===1981–82===
Jesse Hubbard—originally from Center City, Pennsylvania—first appears in the adjacent town of Pine Valley as the recently orphaned 17-year-old nephew of Dr. Frank Grant (John Danelle). After the death of Jesse&#x27;s widowed mother Ellie (Mary Alice), Jesse leaves Chicago and moves in with Ellie&#x27;s brother Frank and his wife Nancy (Lisa Wilkinson), who are next door neighbors and close friends of Dr. Joe Martin (Ray MacDonnell) and his wife Ruth (Mary Fickett). Like his best friend Jenny Gardner (Kim Delaney), Jesse is from the &quot;wrong side of the tracks&quot;.

Jesse soon falls in love with Angie Baxter, a well-to-do teenager from Pine Valley high society. However, Angie&#x27;s father Les Baxter (Antonio Fargas) strongly disapproves, feeling that Jesse is not good enough for his daughter. After Jesse is falsely accused of attempting to rape Angie&#x27;s former friend Liza Colby (Marcy Walker), he flees to the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen section of New York City with Jenny (who leaves town once Liza threatens to reveal that Jenny&#x27;s father Ray Gardner raped Ruth years earlier). After finding jobs to make ends meet, Jesse and Jenny remain in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen for most of the summer of 1982. Angie is heartbroken. When Liza finally confesses that she lied, Jesse returns to Pine Valley and resumes dating Angie, and Jenny returns to her boyfriend Greg Nelson (Laurence Lau).

===1983–1985===
Jesse&#x27;s desire to make love to Angie is evident, but Angie refuses until they are married. Angie and Jesse elope, because Angie is afraid of her parents&#x27; reaction if she tells them of their intended plans. Soon thereafter, Angie finds out that she is pregnant. Angie confides in her mother Pat Baxter (Lee Chamberlin) that she and Jesse are married and that she is pregnant. Angie is scared to tell Jesse; her insecurities grow when she thinks that Jesse is falling in love with another woman. Pat has a conversation with Jesse about the possibility that Angie could become pregnant. Jesse replies, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t even think of it for another few years.&quot;

When Angie learns of this, she divorces Jesse without telling him she is pregnant. Les encourages Angie to give her baby away, and she starts adoption proceedings. Their baby is adopted by a couple. Jesse is very upset with Angie for not telling him about their baby boy and for giving him up. He desperately tries to track his son down with the help of his friend Vera. When Angie begs him to take her back and to forgive her, they search for their son together. They locate and kidnap him, then flee to Sea City. The couple names the baby after Jesse&#x27;s uncle Frank, who had died just prior to the child&#x27;s birth. After Jesse and Angie convince a judge to give custody of the baby back to them because Jesse&#x27;s signature was forged by Angie&#x27;s father, they remarry. The couple starts their new life in the Grant home, after Jesse&#x27;s aunt Nancy and cousin Carl relocate to Chicago. The Hubbards are later joined by Angie&#x27;s mother Pat, who divorces Les.

By the summer of 1984, Greg Nelson and Jenny Gardner are married, and Jenny has become a successful fashion model. Tony Barclay, a male model who is obsessed with Jenny, plots to kill Greg by rigging his water ski to explode. When Jenny switches skis with him at the last minute, she is killed instead, at the relatively young age of 20. The residents of Pine Valley are stunned into grief. Jesse is particularly devastated, as he must cope with the loss of his closest friend.

In 1985, Jesse and Angie&#x27;s relationship is threatened once again when his half-brother Eugene Hubbard (Tom Wright) arrives in Pine Valley, and immediately sets his sights on Angie. Also new in town is nightclub singer Yvonne Caldwell (Vanessa Bell Calloway), who comes to Pine Valley at Eugene&#x27;s request. Her plan is to lure Jesse away from Angie so that they will divorce and Angie will find solace with Eugene.

Yvonne is able to seduce Jesse and was about to have sex. Eugene concocts a lie so Angie will arrive at Yvonne&#x27;s house just in time to catch Jesse in bed with Yvonne. This leads to a dramatic brawl between Angie and Yvonne. Angie is furious and throws Jesse out of the house, but she eventually forgives him after finding about Eugene&#x27;s plans. Later, a pregnant Yvonne lies and says that the child she is carrying belongs to Jesse. After admitting that she has lied, Yvonne gives her baby away to a black market baby adoption ring. When Jesse learns of Eugene&#x27;s schemes, the two brothers also have a vicious fight, after which Eugene leaves Pine Valley and is not heard from again.

===1986–91===
Convinced to seek political office by electronics mogul Palmer Cortlandt (James Mitchell) and his son Ross Chandler (Robert Gentry), Jesse announces his candidacy for a seat on the Pine Valley Town Council. Palmer and Ross withdraw their support after Jesse refuses to act as their political puppet. Nevertheless, Jesse wages an effective campaign and wins the election. However, he soon finds politics to be too restrictive for his tastes, and resigns from the Town Council.

Jesse works to find out the identity of &quot;Mr. Big,&quot; the leader of the black market baby adoption ring to whom Yvonne gave her baby. Mr. Big threatens Yvonne and, to protect herself and her son, she falsely accuses senatorial candidate Travis Montgomery (Larkin Malloy) of being the baby&#x27;s father. Mr. Big then blackmails Travis into paying $2 million to keep the false allegation from becoming public and ruining his campaign. After several months, Jesse discovers that Mr. Big is actually his own father-in-law, Les Baxter. Attempting to avoid arrest, Les confronts his son-in-law with a gun. In the ensuing struggle, Jesse accidentally pushes Les down a flight of stairs, and Les is killed in the fall. Having witnessed the struggle and the fall, Angie is devastated and blames Jesse for her father&#x27;s death. She once again separates from Jesse, who is heartbroken.

Soon, Jesse and Angie reconcile. She completes medical school and becomes a doctor, despite being sexually harassed by one of her professors, Dr. Allen Voight (John Canary). Jesse joins the Pine Valley Police Department and rises through the ranks quickly, soon becoming a plain clothes detective. During this period Angie befriends Cindy Parker (Ellen Wheeler), the widow of an intravenous drug user who died from AIDS. The couple takes Cindy and her son Scott (Philip Amelio) into their home, and are her closest supporters when she develops AIDS herself. Cindy is ostracized by many Pine Valley residents, including Skye Chandler (Robin Christopher), Greg&#x27;s mother Enid Nelson (Natalie Ross), and a hate group that sets fire to the Hubbard home. Cindy later died, but not before falling in love with and marrying Skye&#x27;s uncle Stuart Chandler (David Canary), who adopts Scott.

Jesse develops an excellent reputation within the police force and the community. In 1988, he is assigned to guard wealthy businessman John Remington (Eddie Earl Hatch), whose life has apparently been threatened. While in the line of duty, Jesse takes a bullet meant for Remington. Despite receiving prompt medical attention, Jesse is pronounced dead a few days later.

Remington (or &quot;Remy&quot; as he is often called) tries to start a romantic relationship with the recently widowed Angie, but his attempts are unsuccessful. This is due in part to the fact that Angie is still grieving, but Remington&#x27;s association with Jesse&#x27;s death makes an Angie-Remy relationship all but impossible. Eventually, Angie has brief romances with medical colleagues Jeff Martin (Jeffrey Byron) and Cal Cummings (Count Stovall), as well as police officer Derek Frye (William Christian). At one point she is engaged to Dr. Cliff Warner (Peter Bergman), but he ends the relationship to remarry his former wife Nina Cortlandt (Taylor Miller). In 1991, Angie leaves Pine Valley and moves to California, taking her son Frankie with her.

===1993–97: Jacob and Angie on &quot;Loving&quot; and &quot;The City&quot;===
In 1993, Angie and a teenage Frankie (Alimi Ballard) settle in Corinth, Pennsylvania, where they reconnect with Jeremy Hunter (Jean LeClerc), an acquaintance from Pine Valley. Her life is almost cut short when she develops aplastic anemia. However, she recovers after receiving a bone marrow transplant.

Angie is convinced she has found true love again with local police detective Charles Harrison (Geoffrey Ewing), who is eventually appointed chief of the Corinth Police Department. Then, as fate would have it, she meets Jacob Foster (Darnell Williams), a mysterious stranger who bears an uncanny resemblance to Jesse, and later turns out to be related to him. Originally, Angie resists any type of relationship with Jacob, despite her attraction to him. In 1995, Jesse&#x27;s spirit seemingly visits Jacob just prior to Angie&#x27;s marriage to Charles, and convinces Jacob to pursue a relationship with Angie. Jacob and Angie ultimately fall in love, prompting her to divorce Charles. Soon thereafter Angie, Jacob, and a college-bound Frankie move to New York City&#x27;s SoHo district, along with several other residents of Corinth. They are all anxious to relocate and make a fresh start after a serial killer murders a number of their friends and acquaintances, including Jeremy Hunter and Angie&#x27;s close friend Stacey Forbes (Lauren-Marie Taylor).

While in New York, Angie opens a free medical clinic at 212 Greene Street in SoHo, a building owned by billionaire Sydney Chase (Morgan Fairchild), and later by Port Charles businesswoman Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot). Angie eventually marries Jacob, who opens a bar in the same building with their friend Buck Huston (Philip Brown). Almost immediately upon reaching SoHo, the couple takes in a foster child named Kayla Jones (Erica Mer), who happens to be Caucasian. A group of white supremacists object to the notion of an African American couple raising a White child. Undaunted, Angie and Jacob continue to raise Kayla, but are heartbroken when she is adopted by another couple. However, in late March 1997, Angie finds an abandoned infant girl in a dumpster. Naming the baby Cassandra, Angie and Jacob ultimately adopt her.

===Jesse&#x27;s &quot;returns&quot;===
In 1994, a tornado rips through Pine Valley, leaving Jenny Gardner&#x27;s brother Tad Martin (Michael E. Knight) near death. While unconscious, Tad is seemingly greeted by the spirit of Jesse (whom Tad first befriended in high school). Along with Jenny, as well as Tad&#x27;s surrogate mother Nola Orsini (Barbara Rush), &quot;Jesse&quot; encourages Tad to return to his family in the land of the living.

In 2001, Jesse appears to return to Pine Valley, but as an angel whose mission it is to help Gillian Andrassy (who had recently been slain by a hitwoman who mistook her for Anna Devane) make a smooth transition to the afterlife. Also, &quot;Jesse&quot; visits Tad, as well as Frankie (Jason Olive), who is serving as a medical intern at Pine Valley Hospital.

===2007–2010===
In December 2007, private investigator Aidan Devane meets a mysterious man named Quentin (Cornelius Smith Jr.). Quentin helps Aidan successfully locate Greenlee Smythe and Zach Slater, both of whom had been missing for weeks and presumed dead. Greenlee and Zach are found in the woods at the bottom of an old bomb shelter, along with an old skeleton.

By January 2008, it becomes apparent that Quentin and Greenlee have both contracted a rare illness requiring their hospitalization in Pine Valley. Without first meeting Quentin, Dr. Joe Martin contacts Angie — now a specialist on infectious diseases — to consult on the case, much to the delight of her old friend Tad Martin. Angie and Joe are both shocked to later learn that &quot;Quentin&quot; is actually Angie&#x27;s son Frankie Hubbard (whose middle name is Quentin). The 25-year-old Frankie, who has served on active military duty in Iraq, apparently suffers from a rare poison he contracted while living in the woods. Now divorced from Jacob Foster, Angie spends her first few days back in Pine Valley searching for the cause of Frankie and Greenlee&#x27;s illness, while trying to understand why her son remained out of contact with his family after returning from Iraq. It is apparent to Frankie and to Angie&#x27;s close friends that she continues to long for Jesse, even after two decades.

Unbeknownst to almost everyone, Frankie is visited in his hospital room by Jesse, who — despite strong evidence to the contrary — is very much alive. Jesse soon reveals his presence to a stunned Tad, who (like his sister Jenny) considers Jesse to be his best friend. Jesse explains that he is pretending to be dead in order to protect his family, whose lives have been threatened, and that he only returned to Pine Valley because Frankie&#x27;s medical condition has placed him near death. Tad, who once incorrectly believed that his former wife Dixie Cooney had died, urges Jesse to tell Angie and Frankie that he is alive. Jesse refuses, and makes Tad promise not to reveal the truth to anyone. When Tad&#x27;s current wife Krystal Carey (Bobbie Eakes) inadvertently discovers him, Jesse elicits a similar promise from her. However, the comatose Frankie is aware of his father&#x27;s presence in his hospital room, and continues to suspect that something is amiss after he recovers.

Jesse attempts to leave Pine Valley, but is assaulted and mugged by a couple pretending to be a battered wife and her abusive husband. He is rushed back to Pine Valley Hospital, keeping him in town a bit longer. On Valentine&#x27;s Day, he attempts to leave town by train. Circumstance leads Angie to the Pine Valley train station as well, at approximately the same time. As she waits for her train, she sees Jesse sitting on another train as it is leaving the station. She chases the departing train, screaming Jesse&#x27;s name, and collapses onto the tracks in tears when the train continues on and disappears from sight. Dejected, she walks back to the station. However, the train unexpectedly returns, and Angie is stunned to see Jesse step onto the platform, alive and well. Embracing each other, the couple is reunited for the first time in 20 years.

Jesse explains to Angie (and later to Frankie) that he was kidnapped and that his abductors faked his death. He was brutally beaten, and the lives of Angie and Frankie were threatened in the process. Eventually, one of his captors took him to the woods and dug a grave in which Jesse was about to be buried. Jesse managed to turn the tables on the captor, kill him in self-defense, and bury him in that same hole.

As the Hubbard family is reunited, Derek Frye (Charles Parnell) -- now chief of the Pine Valley Police Department—informs Greenlee, Zach and their loved ones that the skeleton in the bomb shelter with them was John Remington, the man whom Jesse was protecting at the time of his supposed death. Soon thereafter, Tad is approached by a man identifying himself as Robert Gardner (David Rasche), Tad&#x27;s biological uncle and the brother of his abusive biological father Ray Gardner (Gil Rogers), who died in 1982. Robert, an agent with the FBI, slowly begins to gain the trust of some Pine Valley residents, including Tad&#x27;s biological mother Opal Cortlandt (Jill Larson), and soon convinces Jesse that his primary captor—nicknamed &quot;Papel&quot;—has been killed. However, the Hubbards and Martins are unaware that Papel is actually Robert himself, and that it was Robert who murdered Remington. Robert was apparently trying to locate a pair of large uncut diamonds, one of which Remington had secretly hidden inside a stuffed animal that he gave to Frankie as a child. Unaware of the diamond, Angie later gave the stuffed animal to her daughter Cassandra Foster.

Just as an 18-year-old Cassandra (Yaya DaCosta) arrives in Pine Valley from Paris and finally meets Jesse, the legal declaration of Jesse&#x27;s death is nullified, and he and Angie decide to remarry. On the eve of the wedding, Greg Nelson returns to town, reuniting with the Hubbards. It is a particularly poignant moment, as Greg and his late wife Jenny are Jesse and Angie&#x27;s oldest and dearest friends.

On May 21, 2008, Jesse and Angie&#x27;s friends look on as the couple is remarried at Zach Slater&#x27;s hotel and casino, in the extravagant ceremony that they never had in their younger days. Frankie and Cassandra serve as best man and maid of honor. As a special surprise, Jesse arranges for R&amp;B superstar Ne-Yo to sing his yet-to-be released song &quot;Stop This World&quot; as Angie makes her entrance. During the reception, Jesse catches Robert searching Cassandra&#x27;s hotel room for the diamond. Holding Robert at gunpoint, Jesse reveals that he has discovered the diamond, and that he deduced some time ago that Robert is the real Papel. After Angie unexpectedly enters the room, Robert takes her hostage and attempts to flee the hotel, shooting at Frankie and Cassandra. Although the two of them are unharmed, Greg is struck by a glancing bullet, while Tad is critically injured and Julia Santos Keefer is fatally wounded. However, Robert&#x27;s escape attempt fails and he is apprehended through the combined efforts of Jesse, Angie and Frankie.

Weeks later, Derek resigns as police chief and moves to California. Using U.S. Attorney Samuel Woods (Mario Van Peebles) to deliver the message, the mayor offers the job to Jesse. Although he clearly aches to accept the offer, Jesse previously promised Angie that he would not return to law enforcement. Thus, he initially declines the offer and accepts a position at Pine Valley University as a criminology professor. However, Angie soon realizes that her stance on the issue is an unreasonable one and relents. Jesse then accepts the appointment as police chief. His first case involves the murder of ex-convict Richie Novak. When Cassandra unexpectedly becomes one of the suspects in the crime, her fragile relationship with her new stepfather is severely strained. After she is cleared, Cassandra returns to Paris to live with her father Jacob.

Some time thereafter, Jesse reveals that—during his 20-year absence—he suffered a nervous breakdown. He eventually developed a romantic relationship with his doctor Rebecca Fowler (Laura Koffman), and the two had a daughter named Natalia (Shannon Kane). In late 2007, Rebecca learned that she had an inoperable brain tumor (which she kept secret), and shortly thereafter Jesse learned that Frankie was near death with a mysterious illness. Realizing that Angie was the true love of Jesse&#x27;s life, Rebecca and Natalia staged a huge argument and &quot;forced&quot; Jesse to return to Pine Valley. Months later, Natalia (now age 19) follows and her paternity is revealed. When Rebecca&#x27;s medical condition comes to light, Angie invites her to stay in the Hubbard home, so that Jesse and Natalia can be together, and so that Rebecca will not be alone in her final days. In February 2009, Rebecca dies.

Soon thereafter, Frankie&#x27;s military unit is reactivated. After marrying his girlfriend Randi Morgan (Denise Vasi), he returns to Iraq. In early May, Frankie&#x27;s convoy is ambushed. His family and friends—including fellow soldiers Taylor Thompson (Beth Ehlers) and Brot Monroe (J.R. Martinez) -- are relieved to discover that he survived. and has been rushed to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (the U.S. military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany). However, Frankie&#x27;s hands are crushed by a machine during the attack, and the injuries could end his medical career. Randi&#x27;s efforts to console Frankie are disrupted when her former lover Henry North comes to Pine Valley. After Henry is found murdered, Randi is mistakenly led to believe that she killed him. Jesse risks his career by altering the crime scene to cover any evidence of his daughter-in-law&#x27;s involvement in the man&#x27;s death.

===2011===
Around the time of May 2011 Angie found out that she was going blind due to her treating a young boy in the ER without protective gear on. She began taking medication to keep from the disease taking full control, but soon found out she was pregnant and discontinued the medication much to the disagreement of Jesse because it would harm the baby. Angie officially became legally blind, April 2011. On March 30, 2011, Angie gave birth to a daughter named Ellie. Maya, a teen who has just given birth and has no support from her parents leaves her baby in Brot&#x27;s police car. Angie goes into labor out at the former Justice of the Piece building Jesse calls for help after Angie passes out from labor pains. When help does not arrive in time he is forced to deliver the baby himself. Brot being the first one on the scene discovers the unnamed baby hidden away in his car. After failed attempts to get baby Ellie breathing after delivery and Jesse afraid of Angie being overwhelmed with grief at her baby being stillborn with Brots help he switches the babies. Jesse then buries baby Ellie under a tree saying that her parents will always love her. At the hospital they name the new baby girlLucille &quot;Lucy&quot; Eleanor Hubbard. A little time later Maya is persuaded by Frankie to work for the Hubbard&#x27;s as help for taking care of Lucy. Angie and Maya grow close, and Maya begins telling Angie about the little girl she abandoned. Angie deciding to help her search for her lost child become to unbearable for Jesse and on September 4, 2011 it is revealed to Angela the truth about her baby girl. September 14, 2011 Maya officially moved out taking baby Lucy with her leaving Angie and Jesse devastated.

==Reception and impact==
Jesse and Angie are the world&#x27;s first African American supercouple. This resulted in the pairing being listed in &quot;The News &amp; Advance&#x27;s&quot; Timeline of daytime soaps under the title of &quot;1984: Daytime’s first black supercouple, All My Children’s Angie and Jesse, are introduced.&quot;
The couple&#x27;s impact on viewers has often been documented in various other versions. Motivational speaker and author Angela D. Lewis recalled her experience watching the Jesse and Angie love story while attending the University of South Carolina in the 1980s. Students would crowd into the Russell House from 1-2 p.m. each weekday to watch Jesse and Angie. Lewis stated, &quot;We were always part of a huge crowd in the student center — not only girls, but plenty of guys, too! — watching &quot;All My Children&quot; to see Jesse and Angie. The student union was flooded. Many of us would even arrange our class schedules around the soap!&quot;

Darnell Williams and Kim Delaney shared a noticeable amount of chemistry in their respective roles as Jesse and Jenny. However, it is widely believed the producers of &quot;All My Children&quot; shied away from pairing them as a romantic couple, as a Black male/White female relationship was still considered to be a taboo on daytime television in the early 1980s. In 2024, Charlie Mason from &quot;Soaps She Knows&quot; placed Jesse and Angie at 14th and 13th place on his ranked list of &quot;Soaps&#x27; 40 Most Iconic Characters of All Time&quot;, writing, &quot;Darnell Williams and Debbi Morgan not only gave us soaps&#x27; first Black supercouple, they gave us a couple that was so perfect, not even death could keep them apart for good&quot;.

===Scholarly and Jesse&#x27;s &quot;death&quot;===
Jesse&#x27;s &quot;death&quot; with Angie saying goodbye to him is often noted for being an unforgettable moment in daytime history; this specific impact was examined in author Louise Spence&#x27;s book &quot;Watching Daytime Soap Operas: The Power Of Pleasure&quot;. When Williams left his role of Jesse, Spence documented fans&#x27; reaction to the news. One letter from a viewer with the initials of P.B. detailed a saddened state to see Williams having left the role. The viewer had never cried so much for an actor on a soap opera, and every time the viewer saw Jesse&#x27;s wife, Angie, onscreen after Jesse&#x27;s &quot;death&quot;, the viewer would also cry.

Another viewer of initials K.H. voiced that Debbi Morgan deserved an Emmy for her portrayal of Angie Baxter. Viewer K.H. felt that Morgan constantly performed with such strong emotion and sensitivity and that because of that, she could not help but touch everyone&#x27;s heart. Also mentioned was Morgan&#x27;s portrayal of grief at Jesse&#x27;s &quot;death&quot; being so moving, that the author of the letter felt as though a member within his or her own immediate family had taken the deadly bullet.

Jesse&#x27;s &quot;death&quot; made website inthe80s.com&#x27;s list of &quot;Memorable Television Events From The Eighties.&quot;

===Guest-starring and magazines===
ABC capitalized on the chemistry and popularity of Williams and Morgan by making them the hosts of &quot;New York Hot Tracks&quot;, a popular music video program which aired late night on Fridays in the 1980s. The genre of videos shown were primarily R&amp;B, Dance and Hip-Hop, with a few Pop videos thrown in every now and then.

In 1985, during the Jesse/Angie/Eugene story arc, Debbi Morgan and Tom Wright (Eugene) appeared in two music videos by the R&amp;B group Cameo: &quot;Attack Me With Your Love&quot; and &quot;Single Life&quot;. The former video features a brief appearance by Laurence Fishburne, and its storyline is continued in the latter video.

When magazine &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; picked their January 3, 1984 Jesse and Angie cover for their Friday November 11, 2005 cover in celebration of their magazine turning thirty years old, the following was stated:

&quot;January 3, 1984 Daytime&#x27;s first black supercouple — ALL MY CHILDREN&#x27;s Angie (Debbi Morgan) and Jesse (Darnell Williams) captured hearts and helped revolutionize the daytime landscape.&quot;
Essence magazine, an American fashion, lifestyle and entertainment source, which was the first monthly magazine for African American women, noted Jesse and Angie as well. In an instance of elaborating on Angie&#x27;s portrayer, the publication cited: &quot;Fans of &quot;All My Children&quot; have watched the ever-sweet Angie Hubbard evolve from a fresh-faced candy striper into a full-fledged physician — and, in the process, they have felt they&#x27;ve come to know Morgan too. And in a way they have. Both Angie and Debbi are fun-loving, determined women, with high moral standards and lots of integrity.&quot;

Kierna Mayo of Essence credited Jesse and Angie for their positive African American representation in the media, as well as their chemistry.

In January 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed the couple at #1 on their list of &quot;17 Great Soap Supercouples&quot;.

===Awards===
After an unsuccessful 1982 nomination, Darnell Williams&#x27;s portrayal of Jesse Hubbard earned him the 1983 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Actor in a Supporting Role in a Drama Series. In 1985, he won the award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, becoming the first black actor to win multiple Daytime Emmys for the same role. He also earned a 2012 nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.

&quot;During her long tenure on the show, Morgan earned two Daytime Emmy nominations, winning the trophy in 1989,&quot; stated &quot;Essence&quot;.
In addition, Morgan was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2009, 2011, and 2012.

<text>Boswil is a municipality in the district of Muri in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland.

The village lies in the Bünztal valley at the foot of the Lindenberg mountain. The hamlet Wissenbach and Sentenhof (a former estate of the Benedictine Muri Abbey) belong to the municipality.

==History==
During Neolithic times, between 10000 and 8000 BCE, settlements were first established near the fish-rich Bünzersee (a small lake). In 1930, a cemetery, dated to have been from between 350 and 325 BCE, was discovered north of Boswil, and is seen as evidence that the area was occupied by Celtic peoples during the same time period. Various wall remains of farm estates and mansions from Roman times lie nearby.

Boswil was first mentioned as &quot;Bozuuila&quot; in a document found in the Grossmünster church in Zürich. Although this document is not dated, recent research places the document&#x27;s origin between 874 and 887 CE.

Boswil and the surrounding regions were ruled by successions of counts and dukes of the Habsburgs up until 1379, when they began losing territories to the expanding Swiss Confederates. The lords of Hallwyl maintained control over Boswil from 1380, until it was handed over to the ministrations of Muri Abbey in 1483. Meanwhile, the eight &quot;Old Cantons&quot; of the Old Swiss Confederacy had unified and taken control in 1415, and jointly exercised power in all external affairs.

In 1649, a third of the village was destroyed in a fire. After the Second War of Villmerger of 1712, the lands of the Freie Ämter were divided into two parts. One section of the new boundary line, extending west from the church in Oberlunkhofen to the &quot;Hochgericht&quot; in Fahrwangen, passed directly through Boswil, with the northern section under control of the Protestant cantons Zürich, Bern and Glarus, and the southern section under control of the catholic cantons. Because of its unique position under the domain of two separate jurisdictions, Boswil&#x27;s development was constrained. Even with the formation of the Helvetic Republic in 1798, Boswil remained divided between the canton of Baden and the newly formed canton of Aargau, until the two cantons were merged in 1803 as the canton of Aargau. Since then, Boswil has been a part of the Muri district.

Industrialization began in 1874, when Boswil became a stop on the Aargauische Südbahn line from Aarau to Muri. From 1870, peat was dug from the Bünzmoos swampland which had resulted from the silting-up of the Bünzersee. In the 1930s and the 1940s, several peat mining companies came into prominence, and an area comprising over 2 square kilometers was cleared, to a depth of 6 meters. As more factories were built, Boswil developed to an industrial site.

<text>Cellular is a 2004 American action thriller film directed by David R. Ellis. The film stars Kim Basinger, Chris Evans, Jason Statham, William H. Macy with Noah Emmerich, Richard Burgi, Valerie Cruz and Jessica Biel. The screenplay was written by Chris Morgan, based on a story by Larry Cohen.

In the film, a female science teacher is kidnapped by home invaders, but manages to randomly phone a stranger and call for help. The man informs the police about the kidnapping, before realizing that the kidnappers are dirty cops, working for the Los Angeles Police Department. The film then follows a struggle for survival between several desperate characters.

The film was released on September 10, 2004. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $57 million.

==Plot==
Science teacher Jessica Martin lives with her husband Craig and their son Ricky. One morning, after Jessica takes Ricky to the bus stop, intruders break into her house, kill her housekeeper, kidnap and confine her in an attic, and smash the landline. Jessica manages to use the wires of the broken phone to contact a random number.

Ryan is hanging out at Santa Monica Pier with his friend Chad when he comes across his ex, Chloe, who dumped him. Hoping to get back with her, he offers to help with the fundraiser being held there; he gets Chad to hand out the fliers until he returns with the T-shirts. On his way, Ryan gets a call on his cellphone, from Jessica who tells him she&#x27;s been kidnapped, and her phone is shattered.

Although Ryan thinks it&#x27;s a prank, Jessica gets him to go to the police, where he reports it to Sergeant Bob Mooney. A fight between officers and gang members breaks out. Mooney intervenes and tells him to report the kidnapping on the fourth floor. However, Ryan can&#x27;t find anyone on the way up, and will lose the call due to poor cell service if he continues up. Ethan Greer, the leader of the kidnappers, demands Craig&#x27;s location from Jessica. When she refuses to cooperate, he leaves to get Ricky. Overhearing them, Ryan realizes the kidnapping is real, hurries to Ricky&#x27;s school, only to see the boy kidnapped. Hijacking a security officer&#x27;s car, he gives chase, but loses them. As his phone battery is running low, he takes a gun in the car and uses it to jump a queue and buy a charger.

Checking on the kidnapping claim, Mooney visits Jessica&#x27;s. Meeting Dana Bayback, the kidnappers&#x27; sole female accomplice posing as Jessica, leads him to believe it is a false alarm. With Ricky in tow, Ethan returns and questions Jessica about where Craig is hiding. Jessica, fearing the kidnappers will kill them all once Craig is found, attacks him, but is overpowered and confesses that he is at a bar at LAX. Before Ethan departs, a woman playing loud music in her car pulls up next to Ryan, but he silences his phone before Ethan realizes.

A cross-connection between cell lines forces Ryan to take a nearby lawyer&#x27;s car and his cell to maintain the connection. At the airport, he plants the gun on one of the kidnappers, triggering the alarm. When security intervenes, they show they are police officers for the LAPD and then detain Craig. Mooney sees a newsflash of Ryan holding up a store for the charger (and the car and phone jacking) and calls Jessica&#x27;s house, realizing the voice on the answering machine is different from that of the woman he met at the house (who has an accent).

The kidnappers escort Craig to his bank safe deposit box to retrieve a bag, but Ryan intercepts it. While Ethan chases him, he drops and breaks the lawyer&#x27;s cellphone. When he opens Craig&#x27;s bag, he sees a video camera with a disturbing video of LAPD Detectives Ethan, Mad Dog, Dimitri, Dana Bayback, Deason, and Mooney&#x27;s friend Jack Tanner, robbing, torturing, and murdering two drug dealers, exposing them all as dirty cops.

Ryan steals the lawyer&#x27;s car again, from the police impound lot, and finds his own cellphone he left in the seat. Mooney returns to the Martins&#x27; to verify some things, where he kills Bayback in self-defense when she fires at him, grazing his neck. His friend Tanner pulls up, hearing of the shootout, acting as a concerned friend. Back at the safe house, Mad Dog discovers Jessica has been using the landline seeking help. He attempts to kill her and her son, but she nicks his brachial artery, causing him to bleed to death in seconds.

Tanner tells Ethan of Bayback’s death and the forensic team at the Martins&#x27; house, looking for evidence. Before Jessica and Ricky can escape, they are caught by Ethan&#x27;s gang, but Ryan contacts Ethan before he can hurt them and makes a deal: the videotape in exchange for the Martin family at Santa Monica Pier.

At the pier Ryan, in disguise, refuses to give up the camera until the Martins are freed, but Mooney and Tanner find him when Chloe inadvertently exposes him. Tanner sends Mooney away with Dimitri for medical attention, abducts Ryan, bringing him to Ethan. He crushes the videotape, and Tanner radios Deason to execute the Martins, but Deason decides to wait until their return to the safe house to avoid attention.

Mooney overhears the transmission, overpowers Dimitri and handcuffs him before returning to the pier. Ryan escapes to a boathouse, thanks to Chad&#x27;s distraction, and Tanner and Ethan chase after him. He knocks Tanner out, but is overpowered by Ethan before Mooney shows up. After a brief altercation, Ryan sees Ethan approaching Mooney from behind and calls his cell. The ringtone exposes his position, and Mooney shoots him.

Jessica strangles Deason with her handcuff chain in the van, then frees her husband and son; however, he recovers and attempts to kill them when Ryan intervenes, slamming his head in the car door. While Ryan and Mooney are being treated by paramedics, Tanner is also exposed, as Ryan had copied the whole video on his cellphone. Jessica finally meets Ryan, the man who risked his life to save her family, and asks if she can do anything for him; Ryan humorously asks her to never call him again.

==Cast==
==Production==
Larry Cohen, screenwriter of the 2002 thriller film &quot;Phone Booth&quot;, conceived of &quot;Cellular&quot; while working for Sony Pictures. Cohen&#x27;s original screenplay mimicked &quot;Phone Booth&quot; in its theme of a &quot;narcissistically obsessed society&quot; enamored with cell phones. Its story followed a 30- or 40-year-old man named Theo Novak who obtains a call from a woman named Lenore, who tells him that she and her husband have been abducted in a safehouse by a group of bank robbers. It is then revealed that Novak is an art thief who becomes wracked with guilt after unsuccessfully rescuing a friend from committing suicide in the past; he agrees to make a detour from a criminal undertaking and rescue Lenore. During the rescue Novak is unsuccessful, but later discovers a conspiracy involving Lenore and her accomplices over another crime they are involved withultimately, Novak gains the upper hand, killing Lenore and her accomplices and obtains their loot in the process, which leaves him therefore a wealthy man.

Sony Pictures&#x27; then Vice President Lauren Lloyd was drawn to Cohen&#x27;s script and thought of pitching it to fellow executives, but was unsuccessful in doing so. She then left Sony to produce the project independently. Lloyd sent the script to her colleague producer Dean Devlin and pledged to develop it together. Aiming for a story straightforward and devoid of bitterness and cynicism present in Cohen&#x27;s version, the pair hired screenwriter Chris Morgan. Morgan had been passionate about crafting &quot;a story about how an everyday person can become heroic when faced with a certain set of trying circumstances&quot;, and he incorporated that in &quot;Cellular&quot;. In an attempt to segue the script&#x27;s predominant action and thriller elements with situational comedy, as well as appeal to young audiences, Morgan took inspiration from the comical attributes of the fictional character Indiana Jones:

<doc id="1042310" wikidata="Q1349167" url="?curid=1042310" title="Ground station">
<text>A ground station, Earth station, or Earth terminal is a terrestrial radio station designed for extraplanetary telecommunication with spacecraft (constituting part of the ground segment of the spacecraft system), or reception of radio waves from astronomical radio sources. Ground stations may be located either on the surface of the Earth, or in its atmosphere. Earth stations communicate with spacecraft by transmitting and receiving radio waves in the super high frequency (SHF) or extremely high frequency (EHF) bands (e.g. microwaves). When a ground station successfully transmits radio waves to a spacecraft (or vice versa), it establishes a telecommunications link. A principal telecommunications device of the ground station is the parabolic antenna.

Ground stations may have either a fixed or itinerant position. Article 1 § III of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Radio Regulations describes various types of stationary and mobile ground stations, and their interrelationships.

Specialized satellite Earth stations or satellite tracking stations are used to telecommunicate with satellites — chiefly communications satellites. Other ground stations communicate with crewed space stations or uncrewed space probes. A ground station that primarily receives telemetry data, or that follows space missions, or satellites not in geostationary orbit, is called a ground tracking station, or space tracking station, or simply a tracking station.

When a spacecraft or satellite is within a ground station&#x27;s line of sight, the station is said to have a &quot;view&quot; of the spacecraft (see &quot;pass&quot;). A spacecraft can communicate with more than one ground station at a time. A pair of ground stations are said to have a spacecraft in &quot;mutual view&quot; when the stations share simultaneous, unobstructed, line-of-sight contact with the spacecraft.

== Telecommunications port ==
A &quot;telecommunications port&quot; — or, more commonly, &quot;teleport&quot; — is a satellite ground station that functions as a hub connecting a satellite or geocentric orbital network with a terrestrial telecommunications network, such as the Internet.

Teleports may provide various broadcasting services among other telecommunications functions, such as uploading computer programs or issuing commands over an uplink to a satellite.

In May 1984, the Dallas/Fort Worth Teleport became the first American teleport to commence operation.

== Earth terminal complexes ==
In Federal Standard 1037C, the United States General Services Administration defined an &quot;Earth terminal complex&quot; as the assemblage of equipment and facilities necessary to integrate an Earth terminal (ground station) into a telecommunications network. FS-1037C has since been subsumed by the ATIS Telecom Glossary, which is maintained by the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), an international, business-oriented, non-governmental organization. The Telecommunications Industry Association also acknowledges this definition.

== Satellite communications standards ==
The ITU Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R), a division of the International Telecommunication Union, codifies international standards agreed-upon through multinational discourse. From 1927 to 1932, the International Consultative Committee for Radio administered standards and regulations now governed by the ITU-R.

In addition to the body of standards defined by the ITU-R, each major satellite operator provides technical requirements and standards that ground stations must meet in order to communicate with the operator&#x27;s satellites. For example, Intelsat publishes the Intelsat Earth Station Standards (IESS) which, among other things, classifies ground stations by the capabilities of their parabolic antennas, and pre-approves certain antenna models. Eutelsat publishes similar standards and requirements, such as the Eutelsat Earth Station Standards (EESS). The Interagency Operations Advisory Group offers a Service Catalog describing standard services, Spacecraft Emergency Cross Support Standard, and Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems data standards.

The Teleport (originally called a &quot;Telecommunications Satellite Park&quot;) innovation was conceived and developed by Joseph Milano in 1976 as part of a National Research Council study entitled, &quot;Telecommunications for Metropolitan Areas: Near-Term Needs and Opportunities&quot;.

== Networks == 

A network of ground stations is a group of stations located to support spacecraft communication, tracking, or both. A network is established to provide dedicated support to a specific mission, function, program or organization.

Ground station networks include:

* United States Space Force Satellite Control Network (SCN)

<text>The National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime (NCAVC) is a specialist FBI department. The NCAVC&#x27;s role is to coordinate investigative and operational support functions, criminological research, and training in order to provide assistance to federal, state, local, and foreign law enforcement agencies investigating unusual or repetitive violent crimes (serial crimes).

The NCAVC also provides investigative support through expertise and consultation in non-violent matters such as national security, corruption, and white-collar crime investigations. President Reagan gave it the primary mission of &#x27;identifying and tracking [[repeat killers]],’ a term he used for serial killers.

==Founding==
The NCAVC was conceived in 1981 by FBI agent and offender profiler Robert K Ressler during a conversation with then Quantico director Jim McKenzie. Jim McKenzie ran with the idea and eventually had it realised.

In November 1982, following a meeting between members of the Criminal Personality Research Project advisory board and other specialists, the concept of a single (NCAVC) was put forward. This elite investigative branch was never envisaged as a replacement for traditional crime investigation by local law enforcement agencies. The proposal was unanimously adopted seven months later by a conference held at Sam Houston State University&#x27;s Center for Criminal Justice in Huntsville, Texas.

The delegates agreed that the NCAVC should be founded at the FBI Academy in Quantico and run by the agents of the Behavioral Science Unit. President Ronald Reagan formally announced the establishment of NCAVC on 21 June 1984.

==Function==
The NCAVC uses the latest advances in computer and investigative strategies to combat serial and violent crime: ViCAP (Violent Criminal Apprehension Program) and PROFILER (a robot, rule-based expert system programmed to profile serial criminals). CIAP (Criminal Investigative Analysis Programme) is another program designed to investigate serial crime.

VICAP specifically works by identifying and linking the signature aspects in violent serial crimes. The signature of a crime is the intrinsic part of the crime which the criminal must include in order for him to be satisfied (as Ted Bundy would say what the killer must do to &quot;Get his rocks off&quot;) and thus is present in every crime committed by the same person (although the signature does evolve over time).

Today, every division in the FBI is mandated to have an NCAVC coordinator also known as a profiling coordinator. The NCAVC or profiling coordinator acts as a liaison to the local law enforcement agencies. Typical cases for which NCAVC services are requested include child abduction or mysterious disappearance of children, serial murders, single homicides, serial rapes, extortions, threats, kidnappings, product tampering, arsons and bombings, weapons of mass destruction, public corruption, and domestic and international terrorism. The operational services of the NCAVC are supported by research and training programs. Requests for NCAVC services are typically facilitated through NCAVC coordinators assigned to each FBI field office.

==Areas of focus==
The NCAVC is further organized into three components:
*Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU)- East/West Regions;
*Child Abduction Serial Murder Investigative Resources Center (CASMIRC);
*Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP).

<doc id="1042319" wikidata="Q5673206" url="?curid=1042319" title="Harry Warner Jr.">
<text>Harry Warner Jr. (December 19, 1922 – February 17, 2003) was an American journalist. He spent 40 years working for the Hagerstown, Maryland, &quot;Herald-Mail&quot;.

He was also an important science fiction fan and historian of fandom and Washington County, Maryland, as well as a classical musician.

==Biography==

Warner was born in 1922 in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. Due to poor health, he dropped out of Hagerstown High School by the 10th grade.

Despite his lack of formal education, he was a well-read and learned man, an autodidact who taught himself seven languages. During World War II, he translated letters from overseas to families of American soldiers.

Warner never married. On his death, he left most of his possessions to a Hagerstown Lutheran church.

===Career===

Warner started as a reporter at &quot;The Herald-Mail&quot; on May 17, 1943, covering governmental agencies and the farming community, along with obituaries and general news. A rapid typist and fast writer, Warner would often begin composing his stories while taking down information from sources. He also excelled at page layouts and writing headlines, and took a weekly stint as editor in charge. &quot;He was amazing,&quot; a colleague, Gloria Dahlhamer, recalled.

A lover of classical music, who played the piano and oboe in local recitals and on radio, he became the paper&#x27;s classical music critic. He also wrote a column focusing on local history and served as the media representative on the Washington County government&#x27;s Historical Advisory Committee; he received the county&#x27;s Historical Preservation Award for 1982.

He retired in 1983.

===Science fiction fandom===

Warner became active in science fiction fandom in 1936, although he was extremely reclusive, earning the nickname &quot;The Hermit of Hagerstown&quot; by the 1950s. He rigidly kept his professional life in Hagerstown and his science fiction world separate, and few people in his hometown knew of his science fiction activities until after his death. He hated to travel, and almost never attended science fiction conventions. Although in the 1930s he welcomed such visitors as Frederik Pohl, Jack Speer, Wilson &quot;Bob&quot; Tucker, Milt Rothman and Russ Chauvenet, ultimately, he discouraged the visits from other fans.

In 1938, he published the first issue of &quot;Spaceways&quot;, one of the most important science fiction fanzines of its period, and beginning in 1939, supplemented it with &quot;Horizons&quot;, which was for decades a mainstay of the Fantasy Amateur Press Association. &quot;Horizons&quot; had its first
issue in October 1939 and its 252nd and final issue in February 2003. He also wrote prolifically for other zines. He won Hugo Awards for Best Fan Writer in 1969 and 1972.

Fanzine fans revered him for his letter writing. His home at 423 Summit Avenue, Hagerstown, became the most famous mailing address in fandom. Using a manual typewriter, Warner wrote literally tens of thousands of letters commenting on fanzines. His reputation became such that nearly every fanzine publisher in the country sent him free copies of every issue as a matter of course. Almost without fail, Warner would reply with a thoughtful, two-page letter. Editors have described getting their first letter from Warner as a rite of passage.

Film critic and one-time fan Roger Ebert wrote: &quot;Locs (letters of comment) were the currency of payment for fanzine contributors; you wrote, and in the next issue got to read about what you had written. Today I can see my name on a full-page ad for a movie with disinterest, but what Harry Warner or Buck Coulson had to say about me — well, that was important.&quot;

Warner was announced as associate editor of the professional science fiction magazine Odd Tales in the 1940s.; however this was revealed to be a hoax by Warner and Julius Unger. In the 1950s, he tried his hand at science fiction itself, publishing a few short stories in various magazines, such as &quot;Rattle OK&quot; in the December 1956 &quot;Galaxy&quot;.

He was the fan guest of honor at the 1971 World Science Fiction Convention, a tribute he accepted with reluctance.

In 1995, Warner received the First Fandom Hall of Fame award. He remained active in fanzine fandom until the end of his life.

====Histories====
Warner wrote two book-length histories of fandom, essential references in the field: &quot;All Our Yesterdays&quot; (), covering the 1940s, first published in 1969, and &quot;A Wealth of Fable&quot; (), covering the 1950s, first published in 1977. The second book&#x27;s expanded edition won the Hugo Award in 1993 for Best Related Book. &quot;All Our Yesterdays&quot; was also the title of a series of historical columns Warner wrote.

<doc id="1042320" wikidata="Q6670780" url="?curid=1042320" title="London Skolars">
<text>The London Skolars are a rugby league club based at the New River Stadium in Wood Green, Haringey, North London. Founded in 1995, the club operated as a semi-professional team for 2003 and competed in the League 1 until it withdrew from the professional leagues at the end of 2023. The London Skolars were accepted into the Southern Conference League (SCL) for the 2024 season.

==History==
The London Skolars were founded in 1995 by Ian &quot;Hector&quot; MCNeil as the Student Rugby League Old Boys. The club was established for post-university graduates in London who wished to continue playing competitive rugby league, with several former international student players among its members. Initially, the team played at Hackney RFC and quickly expanded its player base to include London-based antipodeans and local rugby enthusiasts.

In 1997, the club changed its name to London Skolars, partly to humorously reference its academic origins but primarily due to a potential sponsorship from Skol Lager. The Skolars became a founding member of the Southern Conference League (SCL), the precursor to the Rugby League Conference, and won the inaugural competition (under the name North London Skolars). They also relocated to New River Stadium. Later that year, the Skolars joined the National Conference League, becoming the only club south of Sheffield in the competition for four consecutive seasons.

In 1998, the Skolars hosted Strella XIII, marking the first time a team from Tatarstan had toured Great Britain. During the 1999 season, the Skolars toured Russia, becoming the first amateur club to tour the former Soviet Union.

In 2000, the Skolars&#x27; first team won the Southern Division of the Rugby League Conference, while the second team secured the London League title. The second team repeated this achievement in 2001.

The club applied to join the National Leagues in 2002 and was accepted, becoming the first club in eighty years to transition from amateur to professional leagues. The A team also joined the Conference and won the London &amp; South Division in its first year.

In 2003, during their inaugural season in National League Two, the Skolars finished at the bottom of the league but made significant progress in 2004, winning the Middlesex 9s and the London League. They dropped &quot;North&quot; from their name to become London Skolars. The appointment of Latham Tawhai as a full-time coach at the end of the 2005 season marked another step forward for the club.

Tawhai left the Skolars at the end of 2007 to become assistant coach at Harlequins RL, and was succeeded by Tony Benson. Benson left at the end of the 2008 season due to the logistical challenges of traveling from his home in Leigh, Greater Manchester. Callum Irving, Benson&#x27;s assistant, took over as head coach but resigned in July 2009 for personal reasons. Injured player Jermaine Coleman then served as interim head coach for the remainder of the season. In 2009, the club appointed its first full-time CEO, Philip Browne, who was later replaced by Howard Kramer in 2010. The Skolars finished the 2009 season in 10th place in the Championship One table, taking the wooden spoon with just one win and five points. James Massara, a Hammersmith-born 32-year-old, was named head coach in 2010, followed by the appointment of former Harlequins RL player Joe Mbu in October 2010.

Under Mbu, the Skolars finished 4th in the Championship 1 in 2013, reaching the play-offs but failing to achieve promotion after being knocked out in the semi-finals. In 2014, the Skolars finished 7th out of 9 teams. Following a heavy defeat by Swinton Lions in the Challenge Cup early in the 2015 season, Mbu was released from his contract on 9 March.

On 18 March 2015, the Skolars appointed ex-player and then Hemel Stags assistant coach Jermaine Coleman as head coach. In his first season, Coleman led the Skolars to 11th place out of 14 teams. He strengthened the squad and guided the Skolars to a top-8 playoff position, securing a dramatic 23-22 win over the Gloucestershire All Golds.

In 2021, Mbu returned as coach. However, the team struggled in the league, finishing 9th out of 11 in both the 2021 and 2022 seasons. The 2023 season was particularly challenging, the club announced it would withdraw from the professional structure and continue as a community club in the Southern Conference League. On 29 July, they withdrew from the Southern Conference League, being unable to field for a number of matches.

On 12 September 2024, it was reported that Australian Trevor McLachlan had been appointed as head coach.

<doc id="1042321" wikidata="Q333605" url="?curid=1042321" title="Lionel de Rothschild">
<text>Baron Lionel Nathan de Rothschild (22 November 1808 – 3 June 1879) was a British Jewish banker, politician and philanthropist who was a member of the prominent Rothschild banking family of England. He became the first practising Jew to sit as a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.

He co-founded the British Relief Association, the largest private provider of relief during the Great Irish and Highland Potato famines raising over £500,000.

==Life and career==

The eldest son of Nathan Mayer Rothschild and his wife, Hannah Barent-Cohen, he was a member of the wealthy Rothschild family. Both of his parents were Jewish. He was born in London, where his father had founded the English branch of the Europe-wide family.

In his earlier years, he studied at the University of Göttingen before embarking on an apprenticeship in the family business at London, Paris and Frankfurt. He was admitted to the family partnership in 1836 at a family gathering in Frankfurt.

Like his father, he was a &quot;Freiherr&quot; (baron) of the Austrian Empire, but unlike his father, he used the title in British society. By royal licence of Queen Victoria on 16 June 1838, he was allowed (along with other male-line descendants of his late father) to use the Austrian title of baron in the United Kingdom.

Prime Minister Gladstone proposed to Queen Victoria that Lionel be made a British peer. She demurred, saying that titling a Jew would raise antagonism and furthermore it would be unseemly to reward a man whose vast wealth was based on what she called &quot;a species of gambling&quot; rather than legitimate trade. However, the Queen did raise Lionel&#x27;s son Nathan to the peerage in 1885, and he became the first Jewish member of the House of Lords.

==Banking and philanthropy==
Rothschild was responsible for raising large sums for the government, especially in the Crimean War, and for philanthropic relief of the victims of the Great Irish Famine. In 1861, in protest at the suppression of the Polish uprisings, he (initially) refused to contract a loan to Russia. His most famous undertaking was financing the government&#x27;s purchase of the Suez Canal shares from Egypt for £4 million.

===Irish and Highland famine relief===
On 1 January 1847, he founded the British Relief Association, alongside Stephen Spring Rice, John Abel Smith and other notable aristocrats. The Association went on to raise £500,000, and was the largest private provider of relief during the Irish Famine and Highland Potato Famine.

A Dublin newspaper, commenting in 1850, pointed out that Baron Lionel de Rothschild and his family had, 
==Parliament==

In 1847, Lionel de Rothschild was first elected to the British House of Commons as one of four Members of Parliament for the City of London constituency. Because Jews were at that point still barred from sitting in the chamber due to the Christian oath required to be sworn in, Prime Minister Lord John Russell introduced a Jewish Disabilities Bill to remove the problem with the oath. In 1848, the bill was approved by the House of Commons but was twice rejected by the House of Lords. After being rejected again by the Upper House in 1849, Rothschild resigned his seat and stood again winning in a by-election to strengthen his claim.

In 1850, he entered the House of Commons to take his seat but refused to swear on a Christian Bible asking to use only the Hebrew Bible. This was permitted but when omitting the words &quot;upon the true faith of a Christian&quot; from the oath he was required to leave.

In 1851, a new Jewish Disabilities Bill was defeated in the House of Lords. In the 1852 general election, Rothschild was again elected but the next year the bill was again defeated in the upper house.

Finally, in the Jews Relief Act 1858, the House of Lords agreed to a proposal to allow each house to decide its own oath. On 26 July 1858, Rothschild took the oath with covered head, substituting &quot;so help me, Jehovah&quot; for the ordinary form of oath, and thereupon took his seat as the first Jewish member of Parliament. He was re-elected in general elections in 1859 and 1865, but defeated in 1868; he was returned unopposed in a by-election in 1869 but defeated a second time in the general election in 1874.

<text>Killisnoo was an unincorporated community on Killisnoo Island in the Hoonah-Angoon Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska, near Angoon, Admiralty Island. Killisnoo had a post office until it closed in 1930. The community was known by several alternative names, including Kanas-nu, Kanasnu, Kenasnow and Killishoo.

==History==

Killisnoo Island has long been inhabited by Tlingit people. In the late 1800s, the North West Trading Company built a fish processing plant at Killisnoo and many Tlingit moved from nearby Angoon and other areas to Killisnoo to work at the plant. The plant was destroyed in a fire in 1928 and most of the residents left Killisnoo.

The St. Andrew Church in Killisnoo was destroyed by fire in 1927, and the congregation built a new church called St. John the Baptist church in Angoon.

Like nearby Angoon, Killisnoo receives less rain than most of southeastern Alaska. Whaler&#x27;s Cove Lodge is an active hunting and fishing lodge located on Killisnoo.

==Demographics==
Killisnoo first appeared on the 1890 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village of 79 residents. Although it was considered to be a Tlingit village, Whites outnumbered Tlingits by 44 to 33, with 2 Asians. It continued to appear until 1940, when most of the residents left. It was later annexed into the neighboring city of Angoon.

<doc id="1042326" wikidata="Q64139" url="?curid=1042326" title="Bremgarten, Aargau">
<text>Bremgarten is a municipality in the Swiss canton of Aargau. It serves as seat of the district of Bremgarten. The medieval old town is listed as a heritage site of national significance. In 2013, Bremgarten was the first municipality in Europe to introduce laws forbidding asylum seekers from visiting certain public places such as libraries, swimming pools, schools and churches.

On 1 January 2014 the former municipality of Hermetschwil-Staffeln merged into the municipality of Bremgarten.

==History==

The area was known before 1140 as &quot;Bremgarten&quot;, though the city wasn&#x27;t founded until almost a century later. In 1230, a settlement was founded near the present location of Bremgarten. Then, in 1238/39 it was mentioned as &quot;Bremegarten&quot;. In 1258, it was granted city right by Rudolf I of Habsburg. Bremgarten&#x27;s population grew rapidly, and it became an important market town with an outstanding Latin school. Because it was part of the Habsburg lands, the residents of Bremgarten fought at the Battles of Morgarten (1315) and Sempach on the Habsburg side.

In 1379, a courthouse was built in Bremgarten, serving as center of a new legal district. Berikon joined Bremgarten in 1374. Later, in 1410, Unterlunkhofen, Oberlunkhofen, Jonen and Arni joined. Oberwil-Lieli joined in 1429, Rudolfstetten-Friedlisberg in 1430, and finally Huserhof in 1482. Two districts were created: a &quot;high&quot; one for Ober- and Unterlunkhofen, Arni, Islisberg, Jonen, Werd and Huserhof and a &quot;lower&quot; one for the remaining village.
In 1415, Aargau was conquered by the Old Swiss Confederation. While Bern kept the southwest portion which consisted of Zofingen, Aarburg, Aarau, Lenzburg, and Brugg. Bremgarten became part of the &quot;Freie Ämter&quot; or &quot;free bailiwicks&quot;. They remained relatively independent and were allowed to keep their own legal districts. Bremgarten, together with the rest of the &quot;Freie Ämter&quot; (Mellingen, Muri, Villmergen, and the countship of Baden), were governed as &quot;subject lands&quot; by all or some of the Confederates. When Bremgarten refused the offer to join the Confederation freely, it became involved in the 1443 Old Zürich War, in which it was besieged and captured.

Bremgarten played an important role in the Reformation. An important Swiss reformer called Heinrich Bullinger was born there in 1504. As early as 1529, the official religion of the city changed from Catholicism. However, Catholicism was reintroduced by force in 1531 after the Battle of Kappel. Bullinger was forced into exile and moved to Zürich, where he became the successor of Huldrych Zwingli as the leader of the city after Zwingli had died in battle.
Catholicism lost its influence after the second Villmerger War of 1712. Bremgarten became part of the area of Zürich, Bern and Glarus. During the French Revolution, it became for a short time host to Louis-Philippe, who sought refuge from the revolutionaries. Marshal André Masséna moved into Bremgarten, along with his headquarters, before his troops defeated those of Russia and Austria near Zürich. During the time of the Helvetic Republic, Bremgarten became part of the short-lived Canton of Baden. In 1803 it joined the canton of Aargau.

The city flourished during the Industrial Revolution. Because of the growth, the city wall was taken down, and it was connected to the Swiss railway system in 1876. Only since 1912 has the city been connected with Dietikon and Wohlen by rail.

Like everywhere in Europe, the era after World War II marked a vast increase in motorised traffic. Bremgarten is located at the main road connecting Lenzburg to Zürich. Before the highway was opened, it was one of the busiest roads in Switzerland. This was a big problem, because all the traffic needed to pass a small wooden bridge in the middle of the old part of the town. The opening of the highway did not solve this problem. Only in 1994, when a bypass was constructed, the old part of the town has finally been quiet again. It is now closed to motorised traffic.

KuZeB&#x27;s cultural programme ranges from concerts of alternative and subculture of international format to readings and political lectures. In parts of the population, the appearance of the building has led to rejection.

<text>The Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) is a department of the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime that uses behavioral analysts to assist in criminal investigations. Their mission is to provide behavioral-based investigative and/or operational support by applying case experience, research, and training to complex and time-sensitive crimes, typically involving acts or threats of violence.

Overall, the FBI&#x27;s Behavioral Analysis Units handles diverse cases nationwide, spanning from terrorism and cybercrime to violent offenses targeting both children and adults. They provide expertise on new investigations, ongoing pursuits, and cold cases, collaborating closely with federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies.

Their tasks include:

# Criminal Investigative Analysis: Examining factors such as the offender&#x27;s motives, victim targeting, level of sophistication, actions, and connection to the crime in question, as well as the chronological sequence of events.
# Interview Tactics: Combining behavioral science principles, psychological theories, and science-based approaches to plan, execute, and evaluate interviews.
# Investigative Approach: Providing behaviorally informed suggestions to enhance the efficiency of investigations and allocate resources effectively.
# Threat Evaluations: Employing a data-driven approach to assess an individual&#x27;s cognitive patterns and behavior, determining the likelihood and extent of their progression towards targeting and potentially attacking a specific entity.

==History and structure==
The Behavioral Analysis Unit was originally called the Behavioral Science Unit. The Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) was launched in 1972 as part of the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime.

The Investigations &amp; Operations Support Section is a branch of the FBI&#x27;s overall Critical Incident Response Group. It provides personnel and training to assist in investigations throughout the country and at US embassies worldwide. It also supports other Critical Incident Response Groups within the FBI, FBI headquarters and field offices, FBI legal attaches (at embassies abroad), and all US law enforcement agencies. The section is divided into two main sections: the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime and the Operations Support Branch.

The National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime consists of five Behavioral Analysis Units, or &quot;BAU&quot;s:

* Behavioral Analysis Unit 1 (counterterrorism, arson and bombing matters)
* Behavioral Analysis Unit 2 (threats, cyber crime, and public corruption)
Cybercrime has been a problem for the FBI. In today&#x27;s digital landscape, cybercriminals share similar motives with traditional criminals, but the complex technological aspect of cybercrime poses unique challenges for law enforcement. There have been different approaches to reduce cybercrime through technological advances. Computer sciences and cybersecurity have applied this by using Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs), firewalls, and anti-virus software to mitigate cyberattack threats. 
* Behavioral Analysis Unit 3 (crimes against children)
Behavioral Analysis Unit 3 focuses on crimes against children and provides support to other law enforcement officials through criminal investigative analysis, a process through which analysts review, assess, and interpret offender behavior. Behavioral Analysis Unit 3 also assists other units within the FBI that specialize in crimes against children, such as the Violent Crimes Against Children program (VCAC). The Violent Crimes Against Children program aims to provide quick and proactive responses to threats and/or acts of abuse and exploitation of children that fall within the FBI&#x27;s jurisdiction.

The VCAC prioritizes the following violations against children:

# Child abductions: disappearance of a minor, typically 12 years or younger
# Contact offenses against children: production of child sexual abuse material, sextortion, and travel with the intention to engage in sexual activity with minors
# Sexual exploitation of children: producing, trading, distributing, and/or selling child sexual abuse material
# Trafficking of child sexual abuse material: either distribution or possession of the material
# International parental kidnapping: wrongfully keeping a child outside the United States with the intention of obstructing the lawful exercise of parental rights
The Violent Crimes Against Children program responds to the above violations by aiding the child victims and supporting federal, state, local, tribal, and international law enforcement in identifying, investigating, and deterring individuals and groups that exploit children.
*Behavioral Analysis Unit 4 (crimes against adults, ViCAP)
The ViCAP (Violent Criminal Apprehension Program) is a computer program that was established in 1984 to help law enforcement solve and identify serial murders. The ViCAP uses a 15-page format that requests information about a crime that was committed.

This includes information on:

* Victim
* Offender
* Crime scene
* Physical evidence

This report is then relayed to the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime which is then put in the system of the FBI&#x27;s Behavioral Analysis Unit in Quantico, Virginia. The report is analyzed by the agents to investigate the Criminal Investigation Analysis of a killer. This can help solve unsolved cases and/or new cases in the future, by identifying the suspects of the cases.
* Behavioral Analysis Unit 5 (research, strategy, and instruction)
the FBI&#x27;s Behavioral Analysis Unit 5 (BAU-5), relies on extensive training and law enforcement experience to develop and apply behavioral profiles. This unit focuses on research, strategy, and instruction, crucial elements that help understand and manage criminal behavior more effectively. The field of criminal investigative analysis, which includes behavioral profiling, had evolved significantly since the 1970s when the FBI&#x27;s Behavioral Science Unit began offering profiling assistance to other law enforcement agencies. Initially, profiling was more about understanding unknown offenders&#x27; personalities and behavioral traits based on crime scene analysis. This method has since grown into a more comprehensive tool known as criminal investigative analysis, encompassing a variety of services such as investigative suggestions, interview strategies, and trial support.

One of BAU-5&#x27;s core activities is conducting research and providing instructional courses that enhance the skills of law enforcement officers nationwide. The unit&#x27;s efforts aim to educate officers on Applied behavior analysis applying behavioral analysis techniques effectively in their cases. This training often involves analyzing solved and unsolved cases to identify patterns suggesting similar offender behaviors.

The strategy aspect of BAU-5&#x27;s work involves advising law enforcement agencies on various facets of criminal investigations. This could include developing Interview techniques, providing investigative leads, or assisting with media Strategy in high-profile cases. The unit&#x27;s role is often advisory, providing the groundwork for local agencies to build their cases rather than actively participating in the investigation.

Despite its proven utility, criminal investigative analysis continues to face debates over its Methodology and practitioner qualifications. Critics and proponents alike discuss whether the practice should be more Empirical evidence driven or rely on the seasoned intuition of experienced investigators. This ongoing debate highlights the need for continuous research and evaluation to refine criminal profiling techniques and ensure they are practical and scientifically valid.

The headquarters for the BAU is located in Quantico, Virginia.

The Operations Support Branch contains three main units:

* Crisis Management Unit
* Special Events Management Unit
* Rapid Deployment &amp; Technology Unit

==Operation==

The BAU focuses on preventing targeted violence by identifying concerning behaviors. For example, active shooters meticulously plan and prepare for acts of violence. Throughout this process, they frequently exhibit worrying behaviors, characterized as observable and identifiable actions suggesting potential progression towards targeted violence. While no individual behavior definitively signifies an individual&#x27;s trajectory towards committing targeted violence, the presence of multiple behaviors may warrant attention and concern.

The BAU receives requests for services from federal, state, local, and international law enforcement agencies. Responses to these requests for BAU assistance are facilitated through the network of field coordinators of the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime. BAU services can consist of on-site case consultations, telephone conference calls, and/or consultations held at the BAU with case investigators.

BAU assistance to law enforcement agencies is provided through the process of &quot;criminal investigative analysis.&quot; Criminal investigative analysis is a process of reviewing crimes from both a behavioral and investigative perspective. It involves reviewing and assessing the facts of a criminal act, interpreting offender behavior, and interaction with the victim, as exhibited during the commission of the crime, or as displayed in the crime scene. BAU staff conduct detailed analyses of crimes for the purpose of providing two or more of the following services: crime analysis, investigative suggestions, profiles of unknown offenders, threat analysis, critical incident analysis, interview strategies, major case management, search warrant assistance, prosecution and trial strategies, and expert testimony.
In addition to the above services, the BAU staff produced the &quot;Child Abduction Response Plan&quot; to assist investigators faced with these investigations. Recently, the BAU released &quot;The School Shooter: A Threat Assessment Perspective&quot; report to guide school administrators, teachers, parents, and law enforcement in identifying and evaluating threats in schools. The BAU maintains a reference file for experts in various forensic disciplines such as odontology, anthropology, psychiatry, entomology, or pathology.

==References in popular culture==
The BAU was brought into mainstream culture by television shows such as &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, which depict an elite group of &quot;FBI agent profilers&quot; who travel the country assisting local law enforcement on diverse cases.

The CBS weekly drama series &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; and its spinoff, &quot;Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior&quot; both feature the BAU. Thomas Harris&#x27; Hannibal Lecter novels and the corresponding films (&quot;Manhunter&quot;, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, &quot;Hannibal&quot;, and &quot;Red Dragon&quot;) featured the Behavioral Science Unit (BSU), which later created and developed what eventually became known as the BAU. It is also seen in the NBC television show based on the novels, &quot;Hannibal&quot;, and the CBS television show &quot;Clarice&quot;. The &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; episode &quot;Signature&quot; (season 9, no. 12, January 8, 2008) heavily features a member of the BAU. Additionally, in season 5 of the HBO show &quot;The Wire&quot;, two detectives visit the BAU team in Quantico for a profile of the &quot;fake&quot; serial killer they are investigating. In October 2017, the Netflix show &quot;Mindhunter&quot; was released, which details the experiences of two BSU team detectives interviewing inmates with psychological disorders. In August 2017, the Discovery Channel series &quot;&quot;, based on true events, was released. It featured a member of the BAU who helped catch Ted Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber, through the use of forensic profiling.

==Criticism==

In order to generate profiles of offenders, members of the BAU use a concept known as psychological profiling. Belief in psychological profiling has often been supported by anecdotal evidence describing BAU profiles as a necessary key to solving a crime. A homeless man in North Carolina, for example, was apprehended after a BAU profile was issued for a case that the local police force had not been able to solve. Although anecdotal evidence such as this abounds in popular media, the concept of psychological profiling has not been empirically proven.

In a number of studies, professional criminal profilers have been compared to other groups such as students, police officers, and clinical psychologists. In order to evaluate these groups, each participant was presented with the details of a previously solved crime. The profile written by the participant was then compared to a profile of the guilty party. In no study did the group of profilers outperform the other groups, and in some studies, they were clearly outperformed by both police officers and chemistry students.

Despite these findings, members of the BAU continue to use psychological profiling. Public confidence in psychological profiling is also high and has been greatly promoted by TV shows such as &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;. Some forensic psychologists, such as Robert Homant, have also dismissed the previously mentioned studies by stating that they lack external validity as they do not accurately represent the situations in which members of the BAU work.

<text>SAT-3/WASC or South Atlantic 3/West Africa Submarine Cable is a submarine communications cable linking Portugal and Spain to South Africa, with connections to several West African countries along the route.

It forms part of the SAT-3/WASC/SAFE cable system, where the SAFE cable links South Africa to Asia. The SAT-3/WASC/SAFE system provides a path between Asia and Europe for telecommunications traffic that is an alternative to the cable routes that pass through the Middle East, such as SEA-ME-WE 3 and FLAG. SAT-3 has a capacity of 340 Gbit/s while SAFE has a capacity of 440 Gbit/s. The SAT-3 system together with SAFE was built by a consortium of operators .

== History ==
SAT-3/WASC/SAFE began operations in 2001, providing the first links to Europe for West African internet users and, for South Africans, taking up service from SAT-2 which was reaching maximum capacity. SAT-2 had been brought into service in the early 1990s as a replacement for the original undersea cable SAT-1 which was constructed in the 1960s.

In November 2007, no internet access was available through SAT-3 for about seven days in parts of central Africa. A government official from Cameroon blamed a technical failure at the underwater SAT-3 high sea fibre optic terminal, about forty kilometres from Douala. Many ISPs in Cameroon had transitioned their connections from independent satellite connections to SAT-3 in mid-2007 creating serious communication difficulties during the seven days.

In late July 2009, SAT-3 cable damage caused internet blackouts in multiple west African countries including Benin, Togo, Niger, and Nigeria. Togo and Niger were &quot;completely offline&quot; and Benin was able to &quot;reroute its net traffic through neighboring countries.&quot; However, the three nations were able to use alternative satellite links in order to maintain some Internet communication with the rest of the world. Nigeria suffered a 70% loss of bandwidth that caused problems in banking, government and other mobile networks. President of the Nigeria Internet Group, Lanre Ajayi, said, &quot;[the cable is] a critical national resource because of its importance to the economy and to security.&quot; Two weeks may pass before the cable is fixed.

Nigeria portion of SAT3 cable was damaged in March 2016. On June 9, 2017 the link between Pointe-Noire in- the Republic of the Congo to the international cable was cut off by a fishing vessel forcing network providers to provide internet using V-SAT. The cable was restored after 15 days.

Gabon, Congo, DRC and Cameroon experienced internet disruption due to the rupture of the cable on 17 January 2020 off the coast of Gabon. It was fixed on January 27.

On 6 August 2023, the cable system snapped simultaneously with the WACS Cable System after a rock fall in the Congo Canyon. Internet Speeds in Sub-Saharan Africa were impacted, despite new cable systems such as Google Owned Equiano recently landing in the country.

== Landing Points ==
# Sesimbra, Portugal
# Chipiona, Spain (though this landing is considered to be part of the Telefónica domestic network)
# Alta Vista in Las Palmas, Canary Islands

and in Africa:
# Dakar, Senegal
# Abidjan, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire
# Accra, Ghana
# Cotonou, Benin
# Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria
# Douala, Cameroon
# Libreville, Gabon
# Cacuaco, Angola
# Melkbosstrand, South Africa meeting SAFE

Although Telecom Namibia holds ownership in SAT-3/WASC, Namibia has no landing point. Namibian internet users currently have no access to SAT-3/WASC, because Telecom Namibia would have to purchase capacity from Telkom SA, and due to Telkom SA&#x27;s high prices has so far refused to do so.

==Bandwidth costs==
Prices for SAT-3 bandwidth in the African countries it serves are high (US$4,500–12,000 per Mbit/s per month, over 50 times greater than bandwidth prices in the U.S.) in large part because operators have monopoly control of access. The lowest rates occur in Ghana, where the Ghana Internet Service Providers Association (GISPA) organized a two-year negotiation through a court fight against Ghana Telecom. SEACOM president Brian Herlihy states that the owners of the SAT-3 cable have cut prices by 50% since the 2007 announcement of Seacom, in order to compete with the arrival of Seacom in East Africa.

==Technology==
The cable itself consists of four fibers, using Erbium-doped fiber amplifier repeaters and wavelength division multiplexing.

<text>Robert Edward Coontz (June 11, 1864January 26, 1935) was an American naval officer who sailed with the &quot;Great White Fleet&quot; and served as the second Chief of Naval Operations from 1919 to 1923.

== Early life and education ==
Robert Edward Coontz, son of Benton Coontz, was born in Hannibal, Missouri. His parents were originally from Florida, Missouri, where they had been neighbors and schoolmates of a young Sam Clemens. Robert&#x27;s father was involved in several businesses, including owning Hannibal&#x27;s streetcar system. While a young boy, Robert left his name for posterity by carving it into the rock of Mark Twain Cave, then known as McDowell&#x27;s Cave.

After completing his primary education in Hannibal public schools, Coontz attended Ingleside College in Palmyra, Missouri, from 1878 to 1879, and Hannibal College (present day Hannibal-LaGrange University) from 1879 to 1880. Coontz asked family friend Congressman William H. Hatch for an appointment to the United States Naval Academy. Several other young men from the congressional district also desired the appointment, so a competitive exam was arranged, which Coontz won.

== Career ==

Coontz graduated from the Naval Academy in 1885, and served at the Navy Department and in several ships over the next decade, among them vessels stationed in Alaskan waters and the Great Lakes. He returned to the Navy Department late in 1894, to work on updating officer records, then was assigned to the cruiser , the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, and the cruiser .

During the Spanish–American War &quot;Charleston&quot; and he seized control of Guam, then joined Admiral George Dewey&#x27;s forces in the Philippines. He would remain in the Pacific, seeing action in the Philippine–American War. Following further duty afloat and ashore, Coontz, then a lieutenant commander, was executive officer of the battleship during the 1907–1909 world cruise of the &quot;Great White Fleet&quot;. In 1899, Coontz became a Veteran Companion of the Pennsylvania Society of the Military Order of Foreign Wars. 

After promotion to commander in 1909, Coontz was Commandant of Midshipmen at the Naval Academy. On January 30, 1912, Coontz became the Governor of Guam, until September 23, 1913. As Captain, Coontz served as Commanding Officer of the battleship , followed by duty as Commandant of the Puget Sound Navy Yard and the 13th Naval District. He held those positions until late in 1918. Following a brief period as acting Chief of Naval Operations, Rear Admiral Coontz assumed command of a battleship division in the Atlantic.

Coontz had just been assigned to the Pacific Fleet in September 1919, when he was selected to become Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), succeeding Admiral William S. Benson. Reportedly, his term as CNO was marked by unceasing pressure for economy, Congressional unhappiness over base closings, diplomatic efforts to achieve naval limitations, internal Navy Department conflicts over organization and the best ways to manage new technologies, plus the naval fallout of the Teapot Dome scandal. While dealing with these problems, Admiral Coontz established a unified United States Fleet and strengthened the CNO&#x27;s position within the Navy Department. Relieved as CNO in August 1923, by Admiral Edward W. Eberle, Coontz was able to return to sea as Commander in Chief of the United States Fleet.

In June 1925, as Admiral, the Coontz led U.S. fleet, consisting of 57 vessels of United States Navy carrying about 25,000 officers and crew, departed the port of San Francisco, California. He led the fleet on a trans-Pacific visit to New Zealand and Australia, byway of Hawaii and Pago Page, American Samoa. This was the first massed deployment of American battleships since the &quot;Great White Fleet&quot; cruise, nearly two decades earlier, and a valuable demonstration of their strategic reach. The last U.S. fleet departed Australia on August 6, 1925. The fleet played a significant role in strengthening Australia-American relations during the interwar years in the lead up to the signing of the formal ANZAS Alliance in 1941.

Coontz is also acknowledged for his key role in the promotion of U.S. naval aviation. He lobbied for converting the and from s to s following the Washington Naval Treaty, ships that would prove vital for training in the inter-war years and as fighting ships during World War II. From October 1925, until his retirement in June 1928, he served as Commandant of the Fifth Naval District, reverting to the rank of rear admiral.

== Later life ==
After retiring, Coontz wrote a memoir chronicling his early life growing up in Hannibal, Missouri, and his navy career, titled &quot;From the Mississippi to the Sea&quot;. Coontz was briefly recalled to active duty in 1930, to investigate railroads in Alaska. A second book, &quot;True Anecdotes of an Admiral&quot;, was published in 1934. Two years later in 1932, Coontz would represent Alaska at the Democratic National Convention. It was also in 1932, that he became Commander-in-Chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. In 1934, Coontz suffered a series of heart attacks. On January 26, 1935, Coontz died at the Puget Sound Naval Hospital in Bremerton, Washington. He is buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Hannibal, Missouri.

== Personal life ==
On October 31, 1890, in Sitka, Alaska, Coontz married Augusta Cohen, daughter of Abraham Cohen. They had three children, Benton, Kenneth, and Bertha.

<doc id="1042342" wikidata="Q1323201" url="?curid=1042342" title="Ji Ling">
<text>Ji Ling ( 196) was a military general serving under the warlord Yuan Shu during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China.

==In historical records==
In late 196, Yuan Shu sent Ji Ling to lead 30,000 troops to attack a rival warlord Liu Bei. When Liu Bei requested aid from another warlord Lü Bu, Lü&#x27;s subordinates said, &quot;General, you&#x27;ve been wanting to kill Liu Bei. Now you can make use of Yuan Shu to help you kill him.&quot; Lü Bu replied, &quot;No. If Yuan Shu eliminates Liu Bei, he&#x27;ll be able to build a network with the warlords in the north and I&#x27;ll end up being encircled by them.&quot; He then sent 1,000 foot soldiers and 200 riders to help Liu Bei. Ji Ling withdrew his forces and did not dare to make any move when he heard of Lü Bu&#x27;s approach.

Lü Bu set up a camp one &quot;li&quot; southwest of Xiaopei (小沛; present-day Pei County, Jiangsu) and invited Ji Ling to his camp. Ji Ling also hosted a feast in his camp and invited Lü Bu to attend. Lü Bu went there and brought Liu Bei along with him. He told Ji Ling, &quot;Xuande (Liu Bei) is my younger brother. I heard that he was trapped by you gentlemen, so I came here to help him. I don&#x27;t enjoy getting into conflicts, but I enjoy helping others resolve conflicts.&quot; He then had a &quot;ji&quot; erected at the gate of the camp, and said, &quot;Gentlemen, watch me fire an arrow at the lower part of the curved blade on the &quot;ji&quot;. If I hit it in one shot, all of you must withdraw your forces and leave. If I don&#x27;t, you can remain here and prepare for battle.&quot; He then raised his bow and fired an arrow at the &quot;ji&quot;, hitting exactly the lower part of the curved blade. Everyone present at the scene was shocked. They said, &quot;General, you possess godlike skill!&quot; The following day, they threw another party and then withdrew their forces. This is the sole mention of Ji Ling in the historical records.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Ji Ling has a greater role in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. He is first introduced in Chapter 14 during a battle between the forces of Yuan Shu and Liu Bei. He is from Shandong and he wields a war trident weighing 50 &quot;jin&quot;. He duels with Guan Yu and both sides end with a draw. He is also mentioned in the subsequent chapters. The incident involving Lü Bu&#x27;s resolving of the conflict between Ji Ling and Liu Bei is further dramatised in Chapter 16. In Chapter 21, Ji Ling is slain by Zhang Fei while escorting his lord through Xu Province.

<doc id="1042346" wikidata="Q7599898" url="?curid=1042346" title="Stanley Rader">
<text>Stanley R. Rader (August 13, 1930 – July 2, 2002), was an attorney, accountant, author and, later in life, one of the Evangelists of the Worldwide Church of God, then a Sabbatarian organization, which was founded by Herbert W. Armstrong.

==Before meeting Armstrong==
Stanley Rader was born and raised in White Plains, New York. He later moved to California, where he met his future wife, Natalie &quot;Niki&quot; Gartenberg. He graduated from UCLA in 1951 and became a Certified Public Accountant in 1954.

==First associations with Armstrong==
In 1956 Rader met Armstrong, leader of what was then called the Radio Church of God, at its headquarters offices in Pasadena, California. Under contract with the Radio Church of God, Rader worked on improving its accounting system, thereby creating a highly favorable impression with Armstrong, who then urged him to attend law school at Armstrong&#x27;s expense. In 1963 Rader graduated from University of Southern California Law School.

The Radio Church of God had been previously incorporated on March 3, 1946, when it was re-established in Pasadena. Prior to this event it had been an unincorporated voluntary association based in Eugene, Oregon, and named after its radio broadcast. On January 5, 1968, Armstrong, as president, together with the secretary of the corporation, amended its Articles of Incorporation to reflect the change of name to the Worldwide Church of God. (By then its radio broadcast had also been renamed &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot;). By this time Armstrong was considered to be more of a modern-day apostle by his followers, rather than merely &quot;pastor general,&quot; his title in the church. After coming to terms regarding salary and compensation, in 1969 Rader chose to devote himself full-time to the service of Armstrong.

==Joining WCG==
Rader, who still considered himself Jewish, was baptized into WCG by Armstrong in 1975 using a hotel bathtub in the Mandarin Hotel in Hong Kong. This move allowed Rader to reposition himself as a high-ranking church evangelist in an attempt to quell misgivings by many in the ministerial hierarchy, who felt that Rader&#x27;s undue influence on Armstrong was troubling.

==&quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview==
In a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview with Mike Wallace, Rader defended himself, remarking to Wallace, &quot;I don&#x27;t take stupid pills.&quot; Wallace read to Rader a portion of a letter Armstrong was drafting, asking Rader to resign from any church positions that would make him Armstrong&#x27;s successor. Wallace then played a tape of Armstrong reading the letter. Rader started to sweat, before finally declaring: &quot;Now I say you&#x27;ve acquired this by illegal means. I intend to have my attorneys today not only sue you if you use this. ... Mike, look, I think you&#x27;d better scrap everything because you&#x27;re on my list. Okay? You&#x27;re never going to live it down, Mike, I guarantee it. ... you&#x27;re contemptible. ... I&#x27;d like you to get out of here, immediately!&quot; Rader then stormed out of the room, and accused the press of distorting the facts.

==Popularizing Armstrong==
Whereas the plan of Garner Ted Armstrong was to ease his aging father into retirement, the plan of Rader and his aide Robert Kuhn was to transform Herbert W. Armstrong from an elderly evangelist into a more secular leader, casting him as a vital &quot;Ambassador for World Peace without portfolio&quot;. Rader&#x27;s plan required the creation of a totally new and secular cover entity from which to operate, distanced from Armstrong&#x27;s Worldwide fundamentalist sect, which might prove unpalatable to prominent world leaders as Armstrong played out his role as quasi-ambassador. In 1975, therefore, he incorporated the Ambassador International Cultural Foundation (AICF) which was actually funded from the tithe money of members of the Worldwide Church of God. In 1979, Rader was ordained as one of the Evangelists of the Worldwide Church of God.

As a consequence, the AICF transformed Ambassador Auditorium, on the Ambassador College campus, from a church auditorium, in which Saturday Sabbath church services were conducted, into a &quot;Carnegie Hall of the West&quot;, and launched a concert series featuring the top names in classical music, jazz, and the performing arts. PBS and other television networks made use of this glamorous new venue. The AICF also created a new, glossy, secular, coffee-table, commercial magazine called &quot;Quest&quot;, with a circulation of several hundred thousand copies. Additionally, the AICF bought the book publisher Everest House, and funded the motion picture &quot;Paper Moon&quot; starring Tatum O&#x27;Neal.

Armstrong, in the company of Rader, began introducing himself to any world leader who held political power and was willing to meet with the aging, grandfatherly figure for a photo opportunity for &quot;The Plain Truth&quot;, during which the leader would receive expensive gifts, such as Stueben crystal. Armstrong sold his new AICF portfolio approach to the church membership as being a new phase in preaching the church&#x27;s gospel.

==Business relationships==
Rader used his own professional legal accounting practice, and also incorporated new companies in order to conduct profitable business enterprises on behalf of the Worldwide Church of God. The companies largely owned and controlled by Rader included:

* Rader, Helge &amp; Gerson, which provided legal representation for the church.
* Rader, Cornwall, Kessler and Palazzo, which provided accounting services for the church.
* Worldwide Advertising, Inc., which booked &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; on radio and television stations.
* Mid-Atlantic Leasing, which leased light aircraft and a Gulfstream II, to enable Rader and Armstrong to fly around the world meeting kings, princes, presidents, and prime ministers, all paid for by the Worldwide Church of God.
* Wilshire Travel, which made the travel bookings for Rader and Armstrong.
* Gateway Publishing, which printed books used by the church.

==WCG placed in receivership==
By 1979, California Attorney General George Deukmejian had opened an investigation into allegations that millions of dollars a year had been stolen from the church by Armstrong and Rader. These allegations resulted in WCG being placed in court-ordered receivership for more than a year.

During this time, Rader was the point man for Armstrong, and rallied other religious groups to his defense. With the backing of a nonprofit, religious lobbying coalition formed to thwart state intrusion, Rader successfully introduced a bill into the California Legislature which restricted the Attorney General&#x27;s authority to conduct civil (but not criminal) financial investigations of California religious and nonprofit organizations. Subsequent to the bill&#x27;s passage into law, the California Attorney General&#x27;s office dropped its litigation against WCG.

==Book==
In 1980, Rader wrote a book called &quot;Against the Gates of Hell: The Threat to Religious Freedom in America&quot;, which was published by the Worldwide Church of God&#x27;s Everest House corporation. It was about the investigation by the State of California into the finances of the church. The National Council of Churches praised it as &quot;the seminal work on church/state relations in the 20th century.&quot;

==Resignation==
Although Rader appeared to have won the financial receivership battle, his plan to create the AICF cultural empire had come to a halt. In 1981 he resigned as General Counsel and Treasurer of the Worldwide Church of God. Armstrong paid Rader a special $250,000 bonus, after taxes, in appreciation of his vigorous defense of the church against the state receivership. Rader also received substantial pension payments arising under his contractual agreement with the church.

==Death==
By the time that Rader died on July 2, 2002, just two weeks after being diagnosed with acute pancreatic cancer, the Worldwide Church of God had terminated its former broadcasts and created a separate ministry for its magazine, which had renounced its previous editorial purpose. Rader was buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Altadena, California (the same cemetery in which the Armstrong family is buried). His funeral was presided over by Joseph Tkach, Jr.

<text>James Edward Jordan (November 16, 1896 – April 1, 1988) was an American actor and radio personality. He is best known for playing Fibber McGee in &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; and voiced the albatross Orville in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Rescuers&quot; (1977).

==Biography==
Jordan was born in 1896 on a farm near Peoria, Illinois. He attended St. John&#x27;s Church in Peoria, and his family eventually sold the farm and moved into Peoria. It was at church choir practice that he met Marian Driscoll, whom he married on August 31, 1918.

===With Marian===

Jim Jordan went on the vaudeville circuit, both as a solo act and with his wife, Marian, at various times until 1924. They went entirely broke in 1923, having to be wired money by their parents to get back to Peoria from Lincoln, Illinois.

Jim and Marian Jordan got their major break in radio while performing in Chicago in 1924; Jim said he could give a better performance than the singers they were listening to on the radio, and his brother Byron bet $10 that Jim couldn&#x27;t do it. By the end of the evening, Jim and Marian had their first radio contract, at $10 per show for 26 weeks as &quot;The O&#x27;Henry Twins&quot;, sponsored by Oh Henry! candy.

The Jordans would work as a double act for the remainder of their careers, seldom appearing separate from each other, with Jim as the comic foil and Marian as the stooge. From 1931 to 1935, they produced the low-budget sitcom &quot;Smackout&quot;, in which they portrayed most of the characters (including semi-fictional versions of themselves). In 1935, the couple, along with head writer Don Quinn, teamed up to create &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot;, a weekly sitcom that was given a larger budget and an ensemble cast.

&quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; would run as a weekly series, becoming one of radio&#x27;s most popular programs, until 1953. In addition to the general decline of scripted radio and the concurrent rise of television, Marian&#x27;s health was beginning to fail. The show would transition to a pre-recorded daily sitcom from 1953 to 1956, then to a short-form weekly series (under the name &quot;Just Molly and Me&quot;) for &quot;Monitor&quot; from 1957 to 1959.

In 1959, &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; was finally adapted for television, after years of resistance. Marian was too ill to continue, and for reasons unexplained (nothing in the radio series had identified the age of either of the McGees), neither Jim nor Don Quinn (nor Quinn&#x27;s successor as head writer of the radio show, Phil Leslie) transitioned to the new series; new writers were brought in, and both the McGees were recast. The television version of &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot;, with Bob Sweeney as Fibber, was a critical and commercial failure.

===After Marian===
Marian Jordan died in April 1961. Jim Jordan married Gretchen Stewart (1909–1998), the widow of radio comic Harry Stewart (Yogi Yorgesson) in 1962; they remained married for the rest of his life, and he remained in semi-retirement, other than a brief comeback in the mid-1970s when Jordan appeared in an episode of &quot;Chico and the Man&quot;, did voice work for &quot;The Rescuers&quot; and appeared in a public service announcement for AARP.

In March 1988, Jordan fell down at his home and suffered a major stroke. Left comatose for over a week, he never regained consciousness and died on April 1. His death came shortly before voice actors were being hired for &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot;; in acknowledgement of Jordan&#x27;s death, Roy E. Disney wrote his character out of the script (John Candy would play the character&#x27;s brother instead). He is buried next to Marian Jordan in the Saint Ann section of Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City, and is next to the plot of Sharon Tate.

<doc id="1042354" wikidata="Q5415056" url="?curid=1042354" title="Eva Gore-Booth">
<text>Eva Selina Laura Gore-Booth (22 May 1870 – 30 June 1926) was an Irish poet, theologian, and dramatist, and a committed suffragist, social worker and labour activist. She was born at Lissadell House, County Sligo, the younger sister of Constance Gore-Booth, later known as the Countess Markievicz.

==Family background and early life==
Eva Selina Laura Gore-Booth was born in County Sligo, Ireland, to Sir Henry and Lady Georgina Gore-Booth of Lissadell. She was the third of five children born to the 5th Baronet and his wife and the first of her siblings to be born at Lissadell House. She and her siblings, Josslyn Gore-Booth (1869–1944), Constance Georgine Gore-Booth (1868–1927), Mabel Gore-Booth (1874–1955), and Mordaunt Gore-Booth (1878–1958), were the third generation of Gore-Booths at Lissadell. The house was built for her paternal grandfather, Sir Robert Gore-Booth, 4th Baronet, between 1830 and 1835 and three generations of Gore-Booths resided there during Eva&#x27;s childhood, including her paternal grandfather and her maternal grandmother Lady Frances Hill.

Both Eva and Constance were educated at home and had several governesses throughout their childhood, most notably Miss Noel who recorded most of what is known about Gore-Booth&#x27;s early life. She learned French, German, Latin and Greek and developed a love of poetry that was instilled by her maternal grandmother. Gore-Booth was troubled by the stark contrast between her family&#x27;s privileged life and the poverty outside Lissadell, particularly during the winter of the Irish Famine (1879) when starving tenants would come to the house begging for food and clothing. Esther Roper later remarked that Gore-Booth was &quot;haunted by the suffering of the world and had a curious feeling of responsibility for its inequalities and injustices.&quot;

Gore-Booth&#x27;s father was a notable Arctic explorer and, during a period of absence from the estate in the 1870s, her mother, Lady Georgina, established a school of needlework for women at Lissadell. The women were trained in crochet, embroidery and darn-thread work and the sale of their wares allowed them to earn a wage of 18 shillings per week. This enterprise had a great influence on Gore-Booth and her later women&#x27;s suffrage and trade union work.

In 1894, Gore-Booth joined her father on his travels around North America and the West Indies. She kept diaries and documented their travels in &quot;Jamaica, Barbados, Cuba, Florida, New Orleans, St Louis, San Francisco, Vancouver, Toronto, Niagara, Montreal and Quebec.&quot; On returning to Ireland she met the poet W. B. Yeats for the first time. The following year she traveled around Europe with her mother, sister Constance, and friend Rachel Mansfield and, while in Venice, fell ill with a respiratory condition. In 1896, while recuperating at the villa of writer George MacDonald and his wife in Bordighera, Italy, she met Esther Roper, the English woman who would become her lifelong companion. Roper was also the secretary of the North of England Society for Women&#x27;s Suffrage. Believing that she was dying of tuberculosis, Gore-Booth and Roper settled in Manchester to serve working women throughout the remainder of her life.

Gore-Booth became a vegetarian in 1900.

==Political work==
The work of Eva Gore-Booth, alongside that of Esther Roper was responsible for the close link between the struggle for women&#x27;s rights in industry and the struggle for women&#x27;s right to vote. As a middle class suffragist representing Manchester, the work of Gore-Booth was mainly recognized in the Lancashire cotton towns from 1899 to 1913. Her struggle began when Gore-Booth became a member of the executive committee of the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies. Carrying out work at the Ancoats settlement, Gore-Booth became co-secretary of the Manchester and Salford Women&#x27;s Trade Union Council.

1902 saw Eva Gore-Booth campaigning at the Clitheroe by-election on behalf of David Shackleton, a Labour candidate that promised Eva he would show support for the women&#x27;s enfranchisement. Shackleton was elected yet he did not act upon his promise made to Eva. This led to the founding of the Lancashire and Cheshire Women Textile and Other Worker&#x27;s Representation Committee by Gore-Booth, Esther Roper and Sarah Reddish. The setting up of this committee led to Gore-Booth meeting Christabel Pankhurst who also felt campaigned for women&#x27;s rights. However, in 1904, Christabel caused some controversy in the Women&#x27;s Trade Union Council as she attempted to force the council to make women&#x27;s suffrage one of its aims to which they refused. This led to the resignation of Gore-Booth from the council. Resigning from that particular council, Gore-Booth alongside Sarah Dickenson who had also resigned, set up the Manchester and Salford Women&#x27;s Trade and Labour Council. As part of this council, Eva and other suffragists used constitutional methods of campaigning. In the general election of 1906, they put forward their own candidate, Thorley Smith yet he was defeated. In May 1906 Gore-Booth was present in the suffrage deputation to Campbell Bannerman. Her true feeling of helplessness after the failure of this deputation was captured in two poems, which she wrote. These poems were titled &#x27;Women&#x27;s Trades on the Embankment&#x27; and &#x27;A Lost Opportunity&#x27;.

In 1907 Gore-Booth, reluctant to give up hope, contributed an essay &quot;The Women&#x27;s Suffrage Movement Among Trade Unionists&quot; to The Case for Women&#x27;s Suffrage. In this essay Eva gave a summary of reasons for the methods of the LCWTOW campaign to gain a vote for working women.In 1908 Eva was a delegate to the Labour Party Conference at Hull where she proposed a motion in favour of women&#x27;s suffrage. This motion was defeated in favour of one for adult suffrage. The end of 1909 saw Eva Gore-Booth help to run the radical suffragist general election campaign at Rossendale where once again a candidate was put forward but was defeated. In 1910, Gore-Booth showed her support for the New Constitutional Society For Women&#x27;s Suffrage and in 1911 with Roper, she attended a meeting in London of the Fabian Women&#x27;s Group. Also in 1911, she participated in the suffragette 1911 census boycott, and on 17 November of the same year she was a member of the deputation representing the working women of the north of England. This deputation called upon Lloyd George not to drop the Conciliation Bill. 1911 was also the year that Eva put herself in the shoes of the working women when she worked for a short time as a pit-brow lass to sample the working conditions for herself. However, as war broke out, Gore-Booth and Roper took up welfare work among German women and children in England. In December 1913, Gore-Booth signed the &quot;Open Christmas Letter&quot; to women of Germany and Austria. 1915 then saw Eva Gore-Booth become a member of the Women&#x27;s Peace Crusade and in 1916 the No-Conscription Fellowship.

Gore-Booth continued to work for peace, writing poetry and for a privately circulated journal, &quot;Urania&quot;, for the rest of her life.

==Poetry==

When Gore-Booth was embarking on her writing career she was visited by W. B. Yeats who was very much taken with her work. In his own letters he states that he sent her a book to inspire her. Yeats was hoping that she would take up his cause of writing Irish tales to enchant and amuse. Instead Gore-Booth takes Irish folklore and put emphasis on the females in the story. Her widely discussed sexuality in later years is never declared but her poetry reflects it quite overtly. In her Triumph of Maeve she makes a minor scene between Maeve and a wise woman almost erotic. While in her legend of Deirdre she subverts the masculine nationalist identity of Ireland&#x27;s heroic tales. In her early work she uses the same poetic devices that her male counterparts do such as writing a love poem to the goddess of Nature. In these she does not take a male voice though. She is writing love verse from one woman to another. Gore-Booth was also one of a group of editors of the magazine &quot;Urania&quot; that published issues three times a year from 1916 to 1940. It was a feminist magazine that reprinted stories and poems from all over the world with editorial comment. A lot of prominent New Woman authors including Mona Caird were involved with the project. Each issue declared that sex was an accident and there were no intrinsic characteristics of the female or the male. Many New Woman issues were discussed such as gender equality, suffrage and marriage but Gore-Booth went further than that to write poetry about women loving women. Even the title of the magazine &quot;Urania&quot; can refer to heavenly or Uranian another term for homosexual. Gore-Booth and Roper allowed their names to be used in connection with the periodical and Gore-Booth was considered to be an inspiration for &quot;Urania&quot;.

==Later life and death==

Meeting political activist Roper in Italy in 1896, where Gore-Booth was sent to recover from respiratory ailments, was a deciding factor in Gore-Booth&#x27;s active involvement in women&#x27;s rights of the suffrage movement. The two women formed a strong attachment during the weeks spent together at the villa of writer George MacDonald and his wife in Bordighera which led to a partnership, privately and professionally, until Eva&#x27;s death in June 1926. How intimate her relations were with Roper is controversially discussed; however, letters and poems Gore-Booth dedicated to Roper suggest a romantic love between the two women. One of those poems appears in a collection ofher poetic work &quot;The Travellers, To E.G.R&quot; which was published by Roper in 1929 and in which she uses analogies of music and song to express how deeply she was struck by her partners personality and charisma.

After years of playing a lead role in the Women&#x27;s Suffrage Movement and fighting for equality of women&#x27;s rights in the UK as well as staying true to her literary roots, Gore-Booth and Roper relocated to London from Manchester in 1913 due to Gore-Booth&#x27;s deteriorating respiratory health. During World War I, Gore-Booth and Roper were actively involved in the British Peace Movement along with fellow suffragists, such as Sylvia Pankhurst and Emily Hobhouse. At the Women&#x27;s International Congress which took place at the city of Hague in 1915, she jointly composed an open Christmas letter entitled &quot;To the Women of Germany &amp; Austria&quot; urging to &quot;... join hands with the women of neutral countries, and urge our rulers to stay further bloodshed...&quot; and appealing to a sense of sisterhood to prevent further atrocities and the war from escalating.

Just weeks after the 1916 Rising, Gore-Booth traveled to Dublin accompanied by Roper and was pivotal in the efforts to reprieve the death sentence of her sister Constance Markievicz awarded for her instrumental role in the 1916 Rising. This was successfully converted to a life sentence. Her poetry composed during this period reflects the personal trauma and horror she was exposed to visiting her sister in solitary confinement. She further campaigned to abolish the death sentence overall and to reform prison standards and attended the trial of Irish nationalist and fellow poet Roger Casement thus showing solidarity and support for the overturning of his death sentence.

During the remaining years of her life, which was claimed by cancer on 30 June 1926, she remained devoted to her poetry, dedicated time to her artistic talents as a painter, studied the Greek language and was known as an anti-vivisectionist and supporter of animal welfare. She also became a Theosophist and animal rights activist. Gore-Booth died in her home in Hampstead, London she shared with Roper until her death. She was buried alongside Roper in St John&#x27;s churchyard, Hampstead.

==Sexuality==

Gore-Booth&#x27;s sexuality has been a topic for debate among academics, and it is increasingly considered that she and Esther Roper were in a same-sex relationship, while some believe that the two women merely cohabited.

After being told that she was close to death in 1896 Gore-Booth took a trip to the home of George MacDonald in Bordighera, Italy, to recuperate. It was there where she met Esther Roper who was also recovering from illness. They formed a strong mutual bond and were partners in life and work from then on. After the time they spent there together Gore-Booth further rejected her privileged rural life in Ireland and moved into the urban Manchester environment. There she purchased property with Roper , who became her partner in her sexual politics activism and suffrage work. Although Gore-Booth and Roper lived together till Eva&#x27;s death they slept in different rooms and there is no way of proving or disproving a sexual relationship or any sort of sexual encounters between them. However, it was also commonplace in this era for married couples (particularly among the upper class) to have separate bedrooms so this detail is superfluous. After knowing each other for four years Gore-Booth made Roper the sole beneficiary of her estate.

Both Gore-Booth and Roper worked with a team of professionals to establish and edit &quot;Urania&quot;, a sexual politics journal that was circulated between 1916 and 1940. The formation was due to the editors being connected through a feminist revolutionary group known as the Aëthnic Union which was formed in 1911. &quot;Urania&quot; was a radical journal that contributed to the discussion on sexual politics of the Suffrage era. It was established to document and enhance the progress of the first wave feminist movement. Its aim was to promote the elimination of the glorification of heterosexual marriage and sex and gender distinctions altogether. It also became a point of reference for those worldwide who shared the editors&#x27; radical, Uranian Philosophy. &#x27;Sex is an Accident&#x27; a term coined by Gore-Booth regarding biological gender distinction was used to sum up the Uranian philosophy.

The journal for most of its publication was privately circulated worldwide but was sent free to anyone who requested it to establish a network and register of supporters. Gore-Booth was seen as the figure head and founder of this journal as it tied into her theosophical feminist beliefs. &quot;Urania&quot; was ranged from eight to sixteen pages of compositions, magazines clippings, extracts and reports about sex changes and scientific methods, lesbian women in history as well as challenging and overcoming society&#x27;s gender norms.

&quot;Urania&quot; monitored birth and marriage rates worldwide and celebrated when the rates fell. It also promoted the idea of same-sex love being the ideal particularly between females and it being spiritual in nature rather than physical. Throughout all this discussion Gore-Booth was noted in &quot;Urania&quot; as an inspiration and her words and her poetry was quoted in it long after her death.

Gore-Booth is buried alongside Roper in Hampstead in England and her tombstone reads &quot;Life that is Love is God&quot;.

Despite the debate on her sexuality Gore-Booth has been honoured for her work by the LGBT community including an award in her honour at the Dublin Gay Theatre Festival. She has also been acknowledged by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions as LGBT and Worker&#x27;s Rights role model. Along with revolutionary lesbians Kathleen Lynn and Madeleine ffrench-Mullen, Margaret Skinnider and Nora O&#x27;Keeffe, and Elizabeth O&#x27;Farrell and Julia Grenan, Gore-Booth was featured in a 2023 TG4 documentary about &quot;the radical queer women at the very heart of the Irish Revolution&quot;: (&quot;Radical Hearts&quot;).

==Posthumous recognition==
Her name and picture (and those of 58 other women&#x27;s suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in 2018.

<text>Killisnoo Island is a small island in the Alexander Archipelago in southeastern Alaska, at . It is located just off the central west coast of Admiralty Island, south of the city of Angoon. Killisnoo Island, an unincorporated area, is a settlement on the island.

==History==
In 1878, the North West Trading Company established a trading post and whaling station on nearby Killisnoo Island and villagers were employed to hunt whales. Whaling, a BIA school and a Russian Orthodox Church attracted many Tlingits to Killisnoo.

In 1882, The first commercial herring fishery begins at Killisnoo; near Angoon and the first two canneries are built in Central Alaska.

In 1886, Alaska Northwest Trading Company was built within the Tlingit Village on Killisnoo Island. The site again was chosen due to the prosperous fishery and the calm inside passage of Chatham Strait.

<doc id="1042363" wikidata="Q548341" url="?curid=1042363" title="Piasecki Helicopter">
<text>The Piasecki Helicopter Corporation was an American designer and manufacturer of helicopters in Philadelphia and nearby Morton, Pennsylvania, in the late 1940s and the 1950s. Its founder, Frank Piasecki, was ousted in 1956 and started a new company, Piasecki Aircraft. Piasecki Helicopter was renamed Vertol Corporation in early 1956. Vertol was acquired by Boeing in 1960 and renamed Boeing Vertol.

==History==
The Piasecki Helicopter Corporation was founded in 1940 by Frank Piasecki and fellow aeronautics student Harold Venzie as the P-V Engineering Forum (shortened from Piasecki-Venzie); the other partners were F.J. Kosloski, Donald N. Meyers, Elliott Daland, and Walter Swartz. The first design from P-V Engineering was the PV-1, a rotorless-tail design that used a tapering tail cone and pressurized air to suppress main rotor torque. Venzie left the firm in 1943.

The PV-2 (NX-37061) was a more conventional design and became the third helicopter flown in the United States (following Igor Sikorsky&#x27;s VS-300 and Sikorsky R-4). It was designed and flown by Frank Piasecki on April 11, 1943. Piasecki had limited pilot experience; the PV-2 was tethered to the ground as a safety measure, but the clothesline he used broke. He towed the helicopter behind his car in October 1943 to Washington, DC to demonstrate it to federal government officials; because the wheels had no bearings, he had to stop every 10 to 15 minutes to cool them. When asked to show his pilot&#x27;s license following the demonstration in Washington, Piasecki admitted he did not have one and he was issued the first helicopter pilot&#x27;s license on October 20, 1943, by the Civil Aviation Administration.

===Tandem rotor designs===

With the successful demonstration of the PV-2, Piasecki convinced the United States Navy to fund the development of a follow-on prototype, signing a contract on January 1, 1944; this marked the start of the design and sale of a series of tandem rotor helicopters to the Navy. The resulting PV-3 became the world&#x27;s first successful tandem rotor design. The PV-3 first flew on March 7, 1945 and bore the Navy designation XHRP-X; it was larger and capable of lifting more than the contemporary Sikorsky designs.

Because P-V Engineering lacked the capital to fund production, the company was reorganized and renamed to the Piasecki Helicopter Corporation in 1946, with Laurance Rockefeller and A. Felix du Pont Jr. taking a controlling interest of 51% in exchange for $500,000. After constructing two more prototypes (designated XHRP-1), the PV-3 would go into production as the HRP-1 in 1947. The HRP-1 was commonly nicknamed the &quot;flying banana&quot; because of the upward angle of the aft fuselage which ensured the large rotors did not hit each other in flight. The nickname would later be applied to other Piasecki tandem-rotor helicopters of similar design.

An evolutionary follow-on design to the HRP-1, designated HRP-2, used an all-metal skin and switched crew seating to side-by-side instead of tandem; however, the limited power meant only five were built, all for the Coast Guard. In 1949, Piasecki provided the H-21 Workhorse to the United States Air Force, an improved version of the HRP-2 with a more powerful Wright R-1820 Cyclone radial engine. Piasecki&#x27;s tandem-rotor helicopters flew higher than competing single rotor designs, and offered a smoother ride.

At approximately the same time the HRP-1 and HRP-2 were being developed, the Navy commissioned Piasecki to design a smaller tandem-rotor utility helicopter; the resulting prototype, which Piasecki called the PV-14, was designated XHJP-1. These went into production as the HUP-1 (PV-18), with the first variants delivered to both the Navy and the United States Army (as the H-25) in 1949; in total, 339 were delivered to the militaries of the United States, Canada, and France by 1954. The HUP was designed with overlapping main rotor blades, which reduced the size so they could be carried on aircraft carrier elevators.

===Piasecki is forced out===

Don R. Berlin was brought in as president and director of Piasecki Helicopters in 1953, while Frank Piasecki was chairman of the board. Under Piasecki, the company began the PV-15 large transport tandem helicopter project (designated H-16). The prototype PV-15 was first flown in 1953, but a fatal crash in January 1956 led to the cancellation of the project.

The majority owners eventually lost faith in Frank Piasecki&#x27;s leadership and by May 1956 he was forced out of the company. He had formed a new company, Piasecki Aircraft Corporation to pursue the development of compound helicopters and other rotorcraft. In two successive special stockholders&#x27; meetings the board then changed the name of Piasecki Helicopter to Vertol (for vertical take-off and landing) Aircraft Corporation and amended the bylaws to bar Piasecki&#x27;s re-election as a director, on the grounds that he was running a rival company.

===Acquisition by Boeing===
In 1956, Vertol began developing a successor to the HUP with improved lift capacity by using turboshaft engines. The project was designated Vertol Model 107 (V-107), and a prototype first flew on April 22, 1958. Impressed, the Army awarded a contract for ten production aircraft (then designated YHC-1A) in June and later asked Vertol in March 1959 to produce a larger version, which was designated V-114. With the pressure to produce two relatively new designs, Vertol again ran into financial pressure and was acquired by Boeing on March 30, 1960, who renamed it Boeing Vertol. It became the Boeing Helicopter Division in 1987.

<doc id="1042373" wikidata="Q456888" url="?curid=1042373" title="Philip of Milly">
<text>Philip of Milly, also known as Philip of Nablus (; c. 1120 – April 3, 1171), was a baron in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the seventh Grand Master of the Knights Templar. He briefly employed the troubadour Peire Bremon lo Tort in the Holy Land.

==Early life==

Philip was the son of Guy of Milly, who witnessed a dozen of royal charters in the Kingdom of Jerusalem between 1108 and 1126. Guy&#x27;s origins are not certain. The historian Malcolm Barber considers it most likely that he came from Normandy or, alternatively, Picardy. Guy held fiefs in the royal demesne around Nablus and Jerusalem. Philip&#x27;s mother was a Flemish noblewoman, Stephanie, according to the late 13th-century &quot;Lignages d&#x27;Outremer&quot;. The same source stated that Philip was his parents&#x27; eldest son, but the sobriquet of his brother, Guy&quot;Francigena&quot; (or &quot;born in France&quot;)implies that Guy was Philip&#x27;s elder brother, born before their parents came to the Holy Land. The &quot;Lignages d&#x27;Outremer&quot; also claimed that Philip was a nephew of Pagan the Butler, but no other primary source refers to Pagan as Philip&#x27;s uncle.

The date of Guy&#x27;s death is unknown, but he was most probably still alive in the early 1130s. Philip inherited his father&#x27;s estates around Nablus. He married a noblewoman, Isabella, before 1144. Her name is the only known fact about her, but Steven Runciman writes that she was a niece of Pagan the Butler.

Philip first appeared in a royal charter in 1138. He and his brothers are absent from the lists of witnesses of royal charters in the 1130s. Their absence shows that they could not secure their father&#x27;s position during the reign of King Fulk, who seized the throne through his marriage with Queen Melisende and appointed his own men to the most important offices.

==Royal vassal==

===Lord of Nablus===

Philip&#x27;s career started only after Fulk died and Melisende became the actual ruler of Jerusalem. He was first mentioned as lord of Nablus in 1144. Late in that year, the queen appointed Philip along with Elinand, Prince of Galilee, and Manasses of Hierges, to lead a relieve army to Edessa, but Imad ad-Din Zengi captured the town before they approached it. During the following years, he seized further fiefs, including lands in the hills near Nablus and Tyre. In 1148, upon the arrival of the Second Crusade, Philip participated in the council held at Acre, where he and the other native barons were overruled and the ill-fated decision to attack on Damascus was made.

Along with the powerful Ibelin family, Philip was a supporter of Melisende during her conflict with her son Baldwin III. In the division of the kingdom in 1151, Melisende gained control of its southern part, including Nablus. Despite this arrangement, Philip assisted Baldwin during the siege of Ascalon in 1153. He granted estates to Order of Saint Lazarus in 1153. From 1155, Philip was regularly listed among the witnesses on Baldwin&#x27;s charters. He participated in the relief of Banyas in June 1157, but he and his troops soon returned home, and were not present at Nur ad-Din&#x27;s subsequent ambush of Baldwin at Jacob&#x27;s Ford.

===Lord of Oultrejordain===

Philip exchanged the lordship of Nablus with Baldwin III for Oultrejordain on 31 July 1161. For Melisende was dying, the agreement was confirmed by her sister, Hodierna, on her behalf. The king retained the revenues from tolling the caravans and the Bedouin tribes crossing Oultrejordain. One of Philip&#x27;s new vassals, John Gothman, was required to directly swear fealty to the king. Philip strengthened Kerak Castle with a ditch and towers. He made a pilgrimage to Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery in the early 1160s.

==Knight Templar==

Philip joined the military order of the Knights Templar in January 1166, passing on to them a significant part of Oultrejordain, including the castle of Ahamant. Acting against the decision of the Templars, Philip joined Amalric&#x27;s invasion of Egypt in 1167. The Ibelin family later recalled an event during the siege of Bilbeis, in which Philip saved the life of Hugh of Ibelin, who had broken his leg when his horse fell in a ditch. The Templars as a whole refused to support Amalric&#x27;s invasion, and the king blamed them for the failure of the expedition. After the death of their Grand Master Bertrand de Blanchefort in January 1169, Amalric pressured them to elect Philip in his place in August of that year. With the election of Philip, Amalric regained Templar support for the invasion of Egypt, although by the end of the year Amalric was forced to retreat.

For unknown reasons Philip resigned as Grand Master in 1171, and was succeeded by Odo de St Amand. Philip accompanied Amalric to Constantinople as ambassador to the Byzantine Empire in order to restore good relations with them after the failure of the Egyptian invasion. He probably died on April 3, before reaching Constantinople.

==Family==

Philip&#x27;s personal life is largely a mystery. William of Tyre describes him as one of the &quot;brave men, valiant in arms and trained from their earliest years in the art of war&quot; who accompanied Amalric to Egypt. Sometime after he became lord of Oultrejordain, he made a pilgrimage to the monastery of Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery on Mount Sinai. With his wife Isabella he had a son, Rainier (who predeceased him), and two daughters, Helena and Stephanie. Isabella died probably in 1166, which may have led to Philip&#x27;s decision to take vows as a brother of the Knights Templar. His lands were inherited by his elder daughter, Helena, wife of Walter III Brisebarre, lord of Beirut, and then by Stephanie and her husbands.

<doc id="1042375" wikidata="Q7403084" url="?curid=1042375" title="Saks, Inc.">
<text>Saks, Inc. was an American holding company founded in 1998 through the merger of Proffitts, Inc. and Saks Fifth Avenue. Before acquisition by the Canadian-founded Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 2013, it held ownership of numerous regional department store chains including Carson&#x27;s, McRae&#x27;s, Parisian, and Proffitt&#x27;s as well as the New York City-based Saks Fifth Avenue. It acquired several mid-range and specialty department store chains in the 1990s, however, refocused on upscale retailing and divested of them in the mid-2000s.

HBC maintains the Saks Fifth Avenue nameplate through the full-line department stores, Saks Off 5th off-price stores, and SaksWorks coworking space provider.

== Operations during 20th century ==
Saks, Inc. originally began as five Proffitt&#x27;s stores in the Knoxville, Tennessee, metropolitan area. After going public under the symbol PRFT on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1987, Proffitt&#x27;s Inc. grew by acquiring several department stores. In 1989 the company purchased 18 Hess&#x27;s locations in Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, and Georgia. From 1994 to 1998, the company added McRae&#x27;s, Younkers, Parisian, Herberger&#x27;s, Carson Pirie Scott, the Wisconsin-based Boston Store chain, and Bergner&#x27;s chains, as well as additional stores from Loveman&#x27;s, Parks-Belk, and Brody&#x27;s, which were converted into existing store nameplates. After acquiring Parisian, Proffitt&#x27;s relocated its corporate headquarters to Birmingham, Alabama, from Knoxville in October 1997. Although the full Saks company no longer has a store in Mississippi, Saks operates its data services from the former McRae&#x27;s headquarters in Jackson, Mississippi.

=== 1998 acquisition of Saks Holdings ===
In September 1998, the company acquired the holding company for the luxury retailer Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks Holdings, Inc., and subsequently changed its legal name to Saks, Incorporated. The acquisition brought the Saks Fifth Avenue and Off 5th franchises, as well as Folio, a mail-order business and Saks.com, an online retailer.

The former Saks Fifth Avenue properties became the Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises division of the company with the larger Birmingham-based department store division becoming the Saks Department Store Group. The company&#x27;s main-line department store group was made up of its Southern Department Store Group: McRae&#x27;s and Proffitt&#x27;s, the Northern Department Store Group: Bergner&#x27;s, Boston Store, Carson Pirie Scott, Herberger&#x27;s and Younkers, the company&#x27;s Specialty Department Store Group Parisian, and the company&#x27;s Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises which included Saks Fifth Avenue and Off 5th.

== Operations during 21st century ==
In 2001, the company recorded record revenues of $6.6 billion, making it a member of the Fortune 500 and one of the largest operators of department stores in the United States. The company was also a primary sponsor of the Bruno&#x27;s Memorial Classic golf tournament, now known as the Regions Charity Classic. The company moved its headquarters to Midtown Manhattan, New York City in 2007.

In 2005, vendors filed against Saks alleging unlawful chargebacks. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigated the complaint for years, and according to the New York Times &quot;exposed a tangle of illicit tactics that let Saks ... keep money it owed to clothing makers&quot;, inflating Saks&#x27; yearly earnings up to 43% and abusively collecting around $30 million from suppliers over seven years. Saks settled with the SEC in 2007, after firing three or more executives involved in the fraudulent activities. In March, 2005, Saks announced to restate financial results from fiscal 1999 through the third quarter of fiscal 2004 to correct some accounting errors related to its previously recorded operating leases.

By 2005, Saks Incorporated began to seek a narrower focus towards the luxury-oriented retail synonymous with its Saks Fifth Avenue stores. The decision resulted in a July 2005 sale of its combined 47 Proffitt&#x27;s and McRae&#x27;s stores to Belk for approximately $622 million.

On October 31 that same year, Saks announced that it was selling the 142 stores within its Northern Department Store Group, including Carson Pirie Scott, Bergner&#x27;s, Younkers, Herberger&#x27;s, and Boston Store to Bon-Ton Stores, Inc., for $1.1 billion; the transaction was complete as of March 6, 2006.

On August 2, 2006, Saks Incorporated announced that it had agreed to sell its upscale 38 Parisian stores, along with two regional distribution centers and Birmingham corporate headquarters to Belk, which rebranded them under their own name in the third quarter of 2007.

On November 5, 2008, Saks announced the closure of the unprofitable Club Libby Lu chain.

=== 2013 acquisition by Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company ===
On July 29, 2013, Toronto-based Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company announced that it will buy Saks, Inc. for US$2.4 billion. Through this ownership, Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks Fifth Avenue Off 5th became affiliated with Hudson&#x27;s Bay, Home Outfitters, and Lord &amp; Taylor.

<doc id="1042379" wikidata="Q4951082" url="?curid=1042379" title="Bowled">
<text>In cricket, the term bowled has several meanings. First, it is the act of propelling the ball towards the wicket defended by a batter.

Second, it is a method of dismissing a batter, by hitting the wicket with a ball delivered by the bowler. (The term &quot;bowled out&quot; is sometimes used instead.)

Third, it is used in scoring to indicate which bowler is credited with dismissing a batter, when the batter is dismissed by being bowled, leg before wicket (LBW), caught, stumped, or hit wicket.

==Delivery of a ball==
==Dismissal of a batter==

This method of dismissal is covered by Law 32 (Bowled) of the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;.

A batter is out Bowled if his or her wicket is put down by a ball delivered by the bowler. It is irrelevant whether the ball has touched the bat, glove, or any part of the batter before going on to put down the wicket, though it may not touch another player or an umpire before doing so. Such rules mean that out Bowled is the most obvious of dismissals: almost never requiring an appeal to the umpire; a bowled batter will usually acknowledge the dismissal voluntarily.

If the delivered ball deflects off the bat, and bowls the batter, then the informal term is known as &quot;played on&quot;, &quot;knocked on&quot;, &quot;chopped on&quot;, or &quot;dragged on&quot;. If the wicket is put down without the batter making any contact with the ball, then it is known as &quot;clean bowled&quot;, with variations of this being &quot;bowled through the gate&quot;, where the ball travels between the bat and pad, or &quot;bowled around the legs&quot;, where the ball goes behind (to the leg side of) the batter and hits the stumps.

A batter cannot be bowled from a no-ball, wide or dead ball.

A batter is out Bowled even if he/she could be given out by another method of dismissal instead. For example, if a batter edges the ball onto the stumps (such that the bails are removed) and the ball is then caught by a fielder, the batter would be given out Bowled instead of caught.

Out Bowled is the second most common method of dismissal after caught, accounting for 21.4% of all Test match dismissals between 1877 and 2012.

The bowler is credited with the wicket if the batter is bowled.

Muttiah Muralitharan holds the Test record for dismissing most batters (167) through the method of out Bowled.

==Scoring==
For example, a scorecard may say that a batter was &#x27;c Smith b Jones&#x27;, which reads as &#x27;caught Smith, bowled Jones&#x27;, and means he was out caught by Smith, when the bowler was Jones.

Or it might say &#x27;lbw b Jones&#x27;, which reads as &#x27;lbw bowled Jones&#x27;, and means he was out LBW when the bowler was Jones.

<text>Kirby James Hensley (July 23, 1911 – March 19, 1999) was an American minister. He was the president and founder of the Universal Life Church.

==Biography==
The second of seven children, Hensley was born on July 23, 1911, in the mountains of Low Gap, Yancey County, North Carolina. For more than 65 years he studied and preached religion throughout the United States. He was practically functionally illiterate; he hired others to read the Bible for him and later listened to recordings of the Bible on tape. Hensley &quot;studied and preached religion&quot; in this manner for 65 years.

Hensley received a doctoral degree (via mail) from institution by name of Hollywood University of Los Angeles, then an honorary doctorate in a domain of science from a school in Nebraska.

He was ordained in a branch of the Baptist Church, but after several years he left the denomination and attended the Pentecostal churches in the area. He married his first wife Nora in a Pentecostal church ceremony; they had two daughters together. He also pastored in Oklahoma and California.

Hensley later divorced Nora and moved back to North Carolina, where he met his second wife, Lida. During their forty-six-year marriage, they had one daughter and two sons.

In the mid-1980s, Hensley called himself the King of Aqualandia and sold citizenship documents, as well as church ordinations, for $35. He ran for President of the United States as the Universal Party&#x27;s candidate in 1964 and 1968, with Roscoe MacKenna as his running mate.

Hensley founded the Universal Life Church in 1962. He remained president of the church until his death on March 19, 1999. He compiled many sermons and once appeared on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; (also available in printed version — final highlight on page 24, still with Morley Safer, who concludes: &quot;I certainly liked him. He was a wonderful character.&quot;).

<text>The Balloon Pilot Badge is a military badge of the United States Armed Forces which was issued during the First and Second World Wars. The badge was issued by both the United States Army and the U.S. Air Force, with the Navy equivalent known as the Dirigible Pilot Badge.

Originally known as the Aeronaut Badge, the Balloon Pilot Badge was created in 1918 and awarded to pilots of military observation balloons. The badge consisted of a balloon centered on a standard Pilot&#x27;s Badge and was issued in two degrees. The senior degree of the Aeronaut Badge was denoted by a star centered above the winged balloon.

The Aeronaut Badge was awarded under the authority of the United States Army Air Service and the United States Army Air Corps until the mid-1930s. The badge was then redesignated the Balloon Pilot Badge and, during the Second World War (WWII), was issued by the Army Air Forces. Like its predecessor, the Balloon Pilot Badge was issued in junior and senior degrees.

The Army Air Forces also issued a Balloon Observer Badge for those who served as co-pilots and support crew on board military balloon craft.

Due to the aircraft technology advances of the 1940s, balloon aeronautics became militarily obsolete by the 1950s. At that time, the United States Air Force discontinued the Balloon Pilot Badge; however, the basic version of the badge is still issued by the U.S. Air Force Auxiliary&#x27;s Civil Air Patrol.

<text>Vshchizh () is a village in the Zhukovka rayon of the Bryansk Oblast of Russia. Now it is a part of the Shamordino rural settlement.

Vshchizh was an old Russian town on the Desna River between the 11th and 13th centuries. It was first mentioned in a chronicle of 1142. In the mid-12th century, it was an appanage town of Prince Svyatoslav Vladimirovich. In 1238, Vshchizh was destroyed by the Mongols. Later, Vshchizh was reborn as a village that exists to this day.

As a result of the excavations in the 1840s and then in 1940 and 1948–1949 (by a Soviet archaeologist Boris Rybakov), the remnants of different buildings and fortifications and a number of artifacts were found. This quiet spot has been Fyodor Tyutchev&#x27;s inspiration for many of his poems.

<doc id="1042416" wikidata="Q705379" url="?curid=1042416" title="Caught">
<text>Caught is a method of dismissing a batsman in cricket. A batsman is out caught if the batsman hits the ball, from a legitimate delivery, with the bat, and the ball is caught by the bowler or a fielder before it hits the ground.

If the catch is taken by the wicket-keeper, then informally it is known as caught behind or caught at the [[wicket]]. A catch by the bowler is known as caught and bowled. This has nothing to do with the dismissal bowled but is rather a shorthand for saying the catcher and bowler are the same player. (The scorecard annotation is usually &quot;c. and b.&quot; or &quot;c&amp;b&quot; followed by the bowler&#x27;s name.)

Caught is the most common method of dismissal at higher levels of competition, accounting for 36,190 Test match dismissals between 1877 and 2012, which is 56.9% of all Test match dismissals in this period.

South African wicket-keeper Mark Boucher holds the record for the most Test match catches, with 532, while Rahul Dravid holds the record for the most Test match catches by non-wicket-keepers, with 210.

==Laws==

This method of dismissal is covered by Law 33 of the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;, which reads:
&quot;The striker is out Caught if a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a No ball, touches his/her bat without having previously been in contact with any fielder, and is subsequently held by a fielder as a fair catch..., before it touches the ground.&quot;This means that the batsman cannot be out caught if:
* The ball is called a no-ball or dead ball.
* The batsman does not hit the ball with his bat or a gloved hand holding the bat.
* The ball, having been hit, makes contact with the field before a fielder catches the ball.
* The ball does not remain under the control of the fielder.
* The ball is hit and lands beyond or on the boundary; (six runs).
* A fielder taking the catch makes contact with the boundary rope or the area outside the boundary, with any part of his body, equipment, when touching the ball.
* An airborne fielder taking the catch, having not previously legally touched the ball, had his last contact with the ground not entirely within the boundary.

A catch is not completed until the fielder catching the ball obtains complete control over both the ball and his/her own movement (Law 33.3).

Note that if a batsman could be given out both caught and by another method, &#x27;caught&#x27; takes precedence, unless the other method is bowled.

If a batsman is out caught, any runs scored off that delivery are voided.

If a batsman is caught, the bowler is credited with the batsman&#x27;s wicket and the catching fielder is credited for the dismissal; there are no catch assists for saving boundaries before a catch, or deflecting the ball to a different fielder in the slips cordon. If the two batsmen cross each other, in attempting to take a run, before the catch was taken, the non-striking batsman at the time remains at the opposite end of the pitch as the new incoming batsman comes to the crease at his former end. This means, unless it is now a new over, he is now on strike and the incoming batsman is not.

==Adjudication==

If the catch taken is pronounced or obvious, the players need not appeal to the umpire; the batsman normally chooses to acknowledge the dismissal himself. However, if the ball brushes the edge of the bat, or the catch is taken very close to the ground, or the ball appears to have bounced off the batsman&#x27;s foot (so it has not touched the ground), or the ball appearing to come off the bat very close to the pitch surface (bump ball), or if the batsman is reluctant to accept that he has been dismissed, then the fielding team has to appeal to the umpire for this decision. In international competition, if neither field umpire can clearly decide if a catch has been made or not, they may refer to the third (television) umpire for a review. The third umpire may also be used if the Umpire Decision Review System is available and a team wishes to dispute a call concerning a possible catch.

==Celebration==
Before 2000, the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot; defined a catch as being completed when the player had &quot;complete control over the further disposal of the ball&quot;. In the very strictest sense, this meant that the player did not finish catching the ball until he threw it away, though the player doesn&#x27;t have to throw the ball to anyone in particular in so doing.

For this reason, even today many cricketers celebrate a catch by lobbing the ball into the air. In a Super Sixes match in the 1999 Cricket World Cup, South African Herschelle Gibbs caught Australian captain Steve Waugh on 56, but Waugh was given not out when Gibbs was ruled to not have control of the ball when attempting to throw the ball in celebration. Waugh went on to score a match-winning 120 not out to qualify his team for the semi-finals; Australia went on to win the tournament.

Coors sponsored Premiership side Chelsea from 1994 to 1997. The last competitive game that the club wore shirts bearing Coors as sponsors was the 1997 FA Cup Final in which they beat Middlesbrough 2–0 to end their 26-year wait for a major trophy.

Coors became the official beer sponsor of NASCAR in 2008, following the departure of Anheuser-Busch.That company returned as an official partner in 2018. Coors was also a partner of the NFL until Bud Light replaced it in 2011. In addition to its official NASCAR sponsorship, Coors Light has regularly sponsored cars in the series. They sponsored Melling Racing, Team SABCO, and most recently Chip Ganassi Racing. Drivers to have Coors backing have included Bill Elliott, who won the Winston Million in 1985 and the 1988 Winston Cup Championship, Robby Gordon, Sterling Marlin, Kyle Petty, David Stremme and Regan Smith. From 2008 to 2017, Coors was the title sponsor of the pole award in the NASCAR Sprint Cup and Nationwide Series. Coors stopped sponsoring a stock car in 2008.

Coors holds the naming rights to Coors Field in Denver, Colorado, home of the Colorado Rockies baseball team.

== Political influence ==
According to Russ Bellant Coors family members have played a prominent role in American politics and public policy, supporting many conservative causes. Such causes included providing a $250,000 grant in 1973 to found The Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative think tank, and, via its parent company, the right-leaning think tank American Enterprise Institute. Joseph Coors was also known to have supported the Contras’ effort in Nicaragua during Reagan&#x27;s presidency.

Chairman Pete Coors ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate from Colorado in 2004 on the Republican ticket.

<text>The FARA 83 (; &quot;Argentine Republic Automatic Rifle&quot;) or FAA 81, &quot;Argentine Automatic Rifle&quot; () was a rifle locally designed and developed for the Argentine Army in the 1980s. It is one of the first indigenously designed assault rifles in South America.

==Development==
The FAA project started in the early 1980s, when the government was still controlled by the National Reorganization Process. The DGFM (General Government Directorate for Military Procurements, or &quot;Dirección General de Fabricaciones Militares&quot;) ordered a replacement be designed for the FMAP FAL, a FN FAL license-built in Argentina. The prototype was completed in 1981, but production didn&#x27;t start until 1984, and continued until 1990.

By the late 1980s, under Carlos Menem&#x27;s tenure as president, the country was undergoing economic difficulties. The economic crisis severely limited the production of modern weapons. This factor forced President Menem to cancel several projects, including the Condor I and Condor II, the FARA 83, and SAIA 90. He was also forced to close armament factories, including TAMSE (&quot;Tanque Argentino Mediano Sociedad del Estado&quot;), which was responsible for the TAM tanks and &quot;Domecq Garcia Shipyard&quot; (the only submarine-related shipyard). Production of the rifle ground to a halt after 1193 rifles had been completed, however, it was resumed in 1990; it is unknown how many rifles were made, but for the most part the Argentine Armed Forces are still armed with the FAL rifle, while the FARA 83 is a secondary weapon.

==Main characteristics==
The FARA-83 was mostly inspired by the Beretta AR70 (Model of 1982). Features include a folding buttstock and tritium sights for aiming in low light conditions; the rifle uses a proprietary 30-round Beretta AR70 magazine (early issue), and has a trigger group that enables semi-automatic and fully automatic fire.

==In popular culture==
The FARA 83 is featured in the first-person shooter video game &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&quot; as part of the Season 2 battle pass which is claimed at tier 15.

<doc id="1042434" wikidata="Q1048080" url="?curid=1042434" title="Ciliary body">
<text>The ciliary body is a part of the eye that includes the ciliary muscle, which controls the shape of the lens, and the ciliary epithelium, which produces the aqueous humor. The aqueous humor is produced in the non-pigmented portion of the ciliary body. The ciliary body is part of the uvea, the layer of tissue that delivers oxygen and nutrients to the eye tissues. The ciliary body joins the ora serrata of the choroid to the root of the iris.

==Structure==
The ciliary body is a ring-shaped thickening of tissue inside the eye that divides the posterior chamber from the vitreous body. It contains the ciliary muscle, vessels, and fibrous connective tissue. Folds on the inner ciliary epithelium are called ciliary processes, and these secrete aqueous humor into the posterior chamber. The aqueous humor then flows through the pupil into the anterior chamber.

The ciliary body is attached to the lens by connective tissue called the Zonule of Zinn (fibers of Zinn). Relaxation of the ciliary muscle puts tension on these fibers and changes the shape of the lens in order to focus light on the retina.

The inner layer is transparent and covers the vitreous body, and is continuous from the neural tissue of the retina. The outer layer is highly pigmented, continuous with the retinal pigment epithelium, and constitutes the cells of the dilator muscle. This double membrane is often considered continuous with the retina and a rudiment of the embryological correspondent to the retina. The inner layer is unpigmented until it reaches the iris, where it takes on pigment. The retina ends at the ora serrata.

The space between the ciliary body and the base of the iris is the ciliary sulcus. 

===Nerve supply===

The parasympathetic innervation of the ciliary body is the most clearly understood. Presynaptic parasympathetic signals that originate in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus are carried by cranial nerve III (the oculomotor nerve) and travel through the ciliary ganglion. Postsynaptic fibers from the ciliary ganglion form the short ciliary nerves. Parasympathetic activation of the M3 muscarinic receptors causes ciliary muscle contraction, the effect of contraction is to decrease the diameter of the ring of ciliary muscle. The parasympathetic tone is dominant when a higher degree of accommodation of the lens is required, such as reading a book.

The ciliary body is also known to receive sympathetic innervation via long ciliary nerves. When test subjects are startled, their eyes automatically adjust for distance vision.

==Function==
The ciliary body has three functions: accommodation, aqueous humor production, and resorption, and maintenance of the lens zonules for the purpose of anchoring the lens in place.

===Accommodation===
Accommodation essentially means that when the ciliary muscle contracts, the lens becomes more convex, generally improving the focus for closer objects. When it relaxes, it flattens the lens, generally improving the focus for farther objects.

===Aqueous humor===
The ciliary epithelium of the ciliary processes produces aqueous humor, which is responsible for providing oxygen, nutrients, and metabolic waste removal to the lens and the cornea, which do not have their own blood supply. Approximately 80% of aqueous humor production is carried out through active secretion mechanisms (the Na+K+ATPase enzyme creating an osmotic gradient for the passage of water into the posterior chamber) and twenty percent is produced through the ultrafiltration of plasma. Intraocular pressure affects the rate of ultrafiltration, but not secretion.

===Lens zonules===
The zonular fibers collectively make up the suspensory ligament of the lens. These provide strong attachments between the ciliary muscle and the capsule of the lens.

==Clinical significance==
Glaucoma is a group of ocular disorders characterized by high intraocular pressure-associated neuropathies. Intraocular pressure depends on the levels of production and resorption of aqueous humor. Because the ciliary body produces aqueous humor, it is the main target of many medications against glaucoma. Its inhibition leads to the lowering of aqueous humor production and causes a subsequent drop in the intraocular pressure. There 3 main types of medication affecting the ciliary body:
*Beta blockers, the second most common treatment method for glaucoma, reduce the production of aqueous humor. They are relatively inexpensive and are available in generic form. Timolol, Levobunolol, and Betaxolol are common beta blockers prescribed to treat glaucoma.
*Alpha-adrenergic agonists work by decreasing production of fluid and increasing drainage. Brimonidine and Apraclonidine are two commonly prescribes alpha agonists for glaucoma treatment. Alphagan P uses a purite preservative, which is better tolerated by those who have allergic reactions than the older BAK preservative in other eye drops. Furthermore, less selective alpha agonists such as epinephrine may decrease the production of aqueous humor through vasoconstriction of the ciliary body (only for open-angle glaucoma).
*Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors also decrease fluid production. They are available as eye drops (Trusopt and Azopt) and pills (Diamox and Neptazane). This may be helpful if using more than one type of eye medication.

<text>The 29th Canadian Parliament was in session from January 4, 1973, until May 9, 1974. The membership was set by the 1972 federal election on October 30, 1972, and it was dissolved prior to the 1974 election. It was controlled by a Liberal Party minority led by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and the 20th Canadian Ministry, with the support of David Lewis&#x27;s New Democratic Party. The Official Opposition was the Progressive Conservative Party, led by Robert Stanfield. The Speaker was Lucien Lamoureux.

The government lost the confidence of the house in 1974 when finance minister John Turner&#x27;s budget was defeated by a vote of 137 to 123, prompting the prime minister to seek dissolution of parliament for the next election.

There were two sessions of the 29th Parliament. The first was from January 4, 1973, to February 26, 1974, and the second was from February 27 to May 9, 1974.

<doc id="1042464" wikidata="Q1402719" url="?curid=1042464" title="Prototype theory">
<text>Prototype theory is a theory of categorization in cognitive science, particularly in psychology and cognitive linguistics, in which there is a graded degree of belonging to a conceptual category, and some members are more central than others. It emerged in 1971 with the work of psychologist Eleanor Rosch, and it has been described as a &quot;Copernican Revolution&quot; in the theory of categorization for its departure from the traditional Aristotelian categories. It has been criticized by those that still endorse the traditional theory of categories, like linguist Eugenio Coseriu and other proponents of the structural semantics paradigm.

In this prototype theory, any given concept in any given language has a real world example that best represents this concept. For example: when asked to give an example of the concept &quot;furniture&quot;, a &quot;couch&quot; is more frequently cited than, say, a &quot;wardrobe&quot;. Prototype theory has also been applied in linguistics, as part of the mapping from phonological structure to semantics.

In formulating prototype theory, Rosch drew in part from previous insights in particular the formulation of a category model based on family resemblance by Wittgenstein (1953), and by Roger Brown&#x27;s &quot;How shall a thing be called?&quot; (1958).

==Overview and terminology==
The term &quot;prototype&quot;, as defined in psychologist Eleanor Rosch&#x27;s study &quot;Natural Categories&quot;, was initially defined as denoting a stimulus, which takes a salient position in the formation of a category, due to the fact that it is the first stimulus to be associated with that category. Rosch later defined it as the most central member of a category.

Rosch and others developed prototype theory as a response to, and radical departure from, the classical theory of concepts, which defines concepts by necessary and sufficient conditions. Necessary conditions refers to the set of features every instance of a concept must present, and sufficient conditions are those that no other entity possesses. Rather than defining concepts by features, the prototype theory defines categories based on either a specific artifact of that category or by a set of entities within the category that represent a prototypical member. The prototype of a category can be understood in lay terms by the object or member of a class most often associated with that class. The prototype is the center of the class, with all other members moving progressively further from the prototype, which leads to the gradation of categories. Every member of the class is not equally central in human cognition. As in the example of &quot;furniture&quot; above, &quot;couch&quot; is more central than &quot;wardrobe&quot;. Contrary to the classical view, prototypes and gradations lead to an understanding of category membership not as an all-or-nothing approach, but as more of a web of interlocking categories which overlap.

Further development of prototype theory by psychologist James Hampton, and others replaced the notion of prototypes being the most typical exemplar, with the proposal that a prototype is a bundle of correlated features. These features may or may not be true of all members of the class (necessary or defining features), but they will all be associated with being a typical member or the class. By this means, two aspects of concept structure can be explained. Some exemplars are more typical of a category than others, because they are a better fit to the concept prototype, having more of the features. Importantly, Hampton&#x27;s prototype model explains the vagueness that can occur at the boundary of conceptual categories. While some may think of pictures, telephones or cookers as atypical furniture, others will say they are not furniture at all. Membership of a category can be a matter of degree, and the same features that give rise to typicality structure are also responsible for graded degrees of category membership.

In Cognitive linguistics it has been argued that linguistic categories also have a prototype structure, like categories of common words in a language.

==Categories==
===Basic level categories===

The other notion related to prototypes is that of a &quot;basic level&quot; in cognitive categorization. Basic categories are relatively homogeneous in terms of sensory-motor affordances — a chair is associated with bending of one&#x27;s knees, a fruit with picking it up and putting it in your mouth, etc. At the subordinate level (e.g. [dentist&#x27;s chairs], [kitchen chairs] etc.) few significant features can be added to that of the basic level; whereas at the superordinate level, these conceptual similarities are hard to pinpoint. A picture of a chair is easy to draw (or visualize), but drawing furniture would be more difficult.

Psychologists Eleanor Rosch, Carolyn Mervis and colleagues defined the basic level as that level that has the highest degree of cue validity and category validity. Thus, a category like [animal] may have a prototypical member, but no cognitive visual representation. On the other hand, basic categories in [animal], i.e. [dog], [bird], [fish], are full of informational content and can easily be categorized in terms of Gestalt and semantic features. Basic level categories tend to have the same parts and recognizable images.

Clearly semantic models based on attribute-value pairs fail to identify privileged levels in the hierarchy. Functionally, it is thought that basic level categories are a decomposition of the world into maximally informative categories. Thus, they

* maximize the number of attributes shared by members of the category, and
* minimize the number of attributes shared with other categories

However, the notion of Basic-ness as a Level can be problematic. Linguistically, types of bird (swallow, robin, gull) are basic level - they have mono-morphemic nouns, which fall under the superordinate BIRD, and have subordinates expressed by noun phrases (herring gull, male robin). Yet in psychological terms, bird behaves as a basic level term. At the same time, atypical birds such as ostrich and penguin are themselves basic level terms, having very distinct outlines and not sharing obvious parts with other birds.

More problems arise when the notion of a prototype is applied to lexical categories other than the noun. Verbs, for example, seem to defy a clear prototype: [to run] is hard to split up in more or less central members.

In her 1975 paper, Rosch asked 200 American college students to rate, on a scale of 1 to 7, whether they regarded certain items as good examples of the category &quot;furniture&quot;. These items ranged from chair and sofa, ranked number 1, to a love seat (number 10), to a lamp (number 31), all the way to a telephone, ranked number 60.

While one may differ from this list in terms of cultural specifics, the point is that such a graded categorization is likely to be present in all cultures. Further evidence that some members of a category are more privileged than others came from experiments involving:

: 1. &quot;Response Times&quot;: in which queries involving prototypical members (e.g. &quot;is a robin a bird&quot;) elicited faster response times than for non-prototypical members.
: 2. &quot;Priming&quot;: When primed with the higher-level (superordinate) category, subjects were faster in identifying if two words are the same. Thus, after flashing &quot;furniture&quot;, the equivalence of &quot;chair-chair&quot; is detected more rapidly than &quot;stove-stove&quot;.
: 3. &quot;Exemplars&quot;: When asked to name a few exemplars, the more prototypical items came up more frequently.

Subsequent to Rosch&#x27;s work, prototype effects have been investigated widely in areas such as colour cognition, and also for more abstract notions: subjects may be asked, e.g. &quot;to what degree is this narrative an instance of telling a lie?&quot;. Similar work has been done on actions (verbs like look, kill, speak, walk [Pulman:83]), adjectives like &quot;tall&quot;, etc.

Another aspect in which Prototype Theory departs from traditional Aristotelian categorization is that there do not appear to be natural kind categories (bird, dog) vs. artifacts (toys, vehicles).

A common comparison is the use of prototype or the use of exemplars in category classification. Medin, Altom, and Murphy found that using a mixture of prototype and exemplar information, participants were more accurately able to judge categories. Participants who were presented with prototype values classified based on similarity to stored prototypes and stored exemplars, whereas participants who only had experience with exemplar only relied on the similarity to stored exemplars. Smith and Minda looked at the use of prototypes and exemplars in dot-pattern category learning. They found that participants used more prototypes than they used exemplars, with the prototypes being the center of the category, and exemplars surrounding it.

==Distance between concepts==

 The notion of prototypes is related to Wittgenstein&#x27;s (later) discomfort with the traditional notion of category. This influential theory has resulted in a view of semantic components more as &quot;possible&quot; rather than necessary contributors to the meaning of texts. His discussion on the category &quot;game&quot; is particularly incisive:Consider for example the proceedings that we call &#x27;games&#x27;. I mean board games, card games, ball games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all? Don&#x27;t say, &quot;There must be something common, or they would not be called &#x27;games&#x27;&quot;--but look and see whether there is anything common to all. For if you look at them you will not see something common to all, but similarities, relationships, and a whole series of them at that. To repeat: don&#x27;t think, but look! Look for example at board games, with their multifarious relationships. Now pass to card games; here you find many correspondences with the first group, but many common features drop out, and others appear. When we pass next to ball games, much that is common is retained, but much is lost. Are they all &#x27;amusing&#x27;? Compare chess with noughts and crosses. Or is there always winning and losing, or competition between players? Think of patience. In ball games there is winning and losing; but when a child throws his ball at the wall and catches it again, this feature has disappeared. Look at the parts played by skill and luck; and at the difference between skill in chess and skill in tennis. Think now of games like ring-a-ring-a-roses; here is the element of amusement, but how many other characteristic features have disappeared! And we can go through the many, many other groups of games in the same way; can see how similarities crop up and disappear. And the result of this examination is: we see a complicated network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities of detail.
Wittgenstein&#x27;s theory of family resemblance describes the phenomenon when people group concepts based on a series of overlapping features, rather than by one feature which exists throughout all members of the category. For example, basketball and baseball share the use of a ball, and baseball and chess share the feature of a winner, etc., rather than one defining feature of &quot;games&quot;. Therefore, there is a distance between focal, or prototypical members of the category, and those that continue outwards from them, linked by shared features.

Peter Gärdenfors has elaborated a possible partial explanation of prototype theory in terms of multi-dimensional feature spaces called conceptual spaces, where a category is defined in terms of a conceptual distance. More central members of a category are &quot;between&quot; the peripheral members. He postulates that most &quot;natural&quot; categories exhibit a convexity in conceptual space, in that if x and y are elements of a category, and if z is &quot;between&quot; x and y, then z is also likely to belong to the category.

==Combining categories==
Within language we find instances of combined categories, such as &quot;tall man&quot; or &quot;small elephant&quot;. Combining categories was a problem for extensional semantics, where the semantics of a word such as &quot;red&quot; is to be defined as the set of objects having this property. This does not apply as well to modifiers such as &quot;small&quot;; a &quot;small mouse&quot; is very different from a &quot;small elephant&quot;.

These combinations pose a lesser problem in terms of prototype theory. In situations involving adjectives (e.g. &quot;tall&quot;), one encounters the question of whether or not the prototype of [tall] is a 6 foot tall man, or a 400-foot skyscraper. The solution emerges by contextualizing the notion of prototype in terms of the object being modified. This extends even more radically in compounds such as &quot;red wine&quot; or &quot;red hair&quot; which are hardly &quot;red&quot; in the prototypical sense, but the red indicates merely a shift from the prototypical colour of wine or hair respectively. The addition of &quot;red&quot; shifts the prototype from the one of &quot;hair&quot; to that of &quot;red hair.&quot; The prototype is changed by additional specific information, and combines features from the prototype of &quot;red&quot; and &quot;wine&quot;.

==Dynamic structure and distance==

Mikulincer, Mario &amp; Paz, Dov &amp; Kedem, Perry focused on the dynamic nature of prototypes and how represented semantic categories actually changes due to emotional states. The 4 part study assessed the relationships between situational stress and trait anxiety and the way people organize the hierarchical level at which semantic stimuli are categorized, the way people categorize natural objects, the narrowing of the breadth of categories and the proneness to use less inclusive levels of categorization instead of more inclusive ones.

== Critique ==

Prototype theory has been criticized by those that still endorse the classic theory of categories, like linguist Eugenio Coseriu and other proponents of the structural semantics paradigm.

=== Exemplar theory ===

Douglas L. Medin and Marguerite M. Schaffer showed by experiment that a context theory of classification which derives concepts purely from exemplars (cf. exemplar theory) worked better than a class of theories that included prototype theory.

=== Graded categorization ===

Linguists, including Stephen Laurence writing with Eric Margolis, have suggested problems with the prototype theory. In their 1999 paper, they raise several issues. One of which is that prototype theory does not intrinsically guarantee graded categorization. When subjects were asked to rank how well certain members exemplify the category, they rated some members above others. For example, robins were seen as being &quot;birdier&quot; than ostriches, but when asked whether these categories are &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; or have fuzzier boundaries, the subjects stated that they were defined, &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; categories. Laurence and Margolis concluded that &quot;prototype structure has no implication for whether subjects represent a category as being graded&quot; (p. 33).

=== Compound concepts ===

Daniel Osherson and Edward Smith raised the issue of &quot;pet fish&quot; for which the prototype might be a guppy kept in a bowl in someone&#x27;s house. The prototype for &quot;pet&quot; might be a dog or cat, and the prototype for &quot;fish&quot; might be trout or salmon. However, the features of these prototypes do not present in the prototype for &quot;pet fish&quot;, therefore this prototype must be generated from something other than its constituent parts.

James Hampton found that prototypes for conjunctive concepts such as pet fish are produced by a compositional function operating on the features of each concept. Initially all features of each concept are added to the prototype of the conjunction. There is then a consistency check - for example pets are warm and cuddly but fish cannot be. Fish are often eaten for dinner, but pets are never. Hence the conjunctive prototype fails to inherit features of either concept that are incompatible with the other concept. A final stage in the process looks for knowledge of the class in long term memory, and if the class is familiar may add extra features - a process called &quot;extensional feedback&quot;. The model was tested by showing how apparently logical syntactic conjunctions or disjunctions, such as &quot;A sport which is also a game&quot; or &quot;Vehicles that are not Machines&quot;, or &quot;Fruits or Vegetables&quot; fail to conform to Boolean set logic. Chess is considered to be a sport which is a game, but is not considered to be a sport. Mushrooms are considered to be either a fruit or a vegetable, but when asked separately very few people consider them to be a vegetable and no-one considers them to be a fruit.

Antonio Lieto and Gian Luca Pozzato have proposed a typicality-based compositional logic (TCL) that is able to account for both complex human-like concept combinations (like the PET-FISH problem) and conceptual blending. Their framework shows how concepts expressed as prototypes can account for the phenomenon of prototypical compositionality in concept combination.

<text>An optical table is a vibration control platform that is used to support systems used for laser- and optics-related experiments in science, engineering and manufacturing. The surfaces of these tables are designed to be very rigid with minimum deflection so that the alignment of optical elements remains stable over time. Many optical systems require that vibration of optical elements be kept small. As a result, optical tables are typically very heavy and incorporate vibration isolation and damping features in their structure. Many use pneumatic isolators that act as mechanical low-pass filters, reducing the ability of vibrations in the floor to cause vibrations in the tabletop.

The surface of an optical table is typically stainless steel with a rectangular grid of tapped holes in either metric or imperial units:

* metric: M6 on a 25 mm grid
* imperial: ¼&quot;-20 UNC on a 1&quot; (25.4 mm) grid

Optical breadboards, benches, and rails are simpler structures that perform a similar function to optical tables. These are used in teaching and in research and development, and are also sometimes used to support permanently aligned optical systems in finished devices such as lasers.

==Explanation==
In optical systems, especially those involving interferometry, the alignment of each component must be extremely accurate—precise down to a fraction of a wavelength—usually a few hundred nanometers. Even small vibrations or strain in the table on which the elements are set up might lead to complete failure of an experiment. Hence, one requires an extremely rigid table which neither moves nor flexes, even under changing loads or vibrations. The surface of the table must also be quite flat, to allow precision optical mounts to make good contact with the table without rocking and facilitate easy assembly of the optical system.

=== Materials and construction ===
Earlier optical table tops were sometimes made of a large slab of highly polished granite or diabase. These materials are very dense and stiff, which inhibits flexing and motion of the surface, improving the stability of the optical system. The surfaces can be ground extremely flat, which is beneficial for alignment of optical systems. Such tables were very heavy and expensive, however, and did not do a good job of damping vibrations. Mounting components to a granite surface is also difficult. Granite and diabase are still used for smaller precision-flat surfaces, but optical tables made from these materials are not commonly available today.

Modern optical tables are typically made of top and bottom sheets of steel, aluminum, or carbon fiber, separated by a thick honeycomb lattice structure. The surface usually has a grid of threaded holes which allow the components to be bolted down to fit the optical system layout. Components may also be held to the steel surface by magnetic bases. Often, the table&#x27;s legs are pneumatic vibration dampers. For even more accurate setups, one also prevents air movements and temperature gradients by enclosing the surface in a box of transparent plastic such as Plexiglas. One may also use a &quot;flowbox&quot;, a device which produces a laminar stream of air flowing downwards, kept at constant temperature by special air conditioning.

The metal used to construct modern optical tables has a higher speed of sound than granite and therefore a higher frequency of the first eigenmode. Any vibration produced on the table below this frequency does not produce a resonant response, making the setup less sensitive to vibrations from motorized optics, cooling water pumps, etc. Vibration damping may be added to tables during their construction. As with granite&#x27;s composite structure, the combination of several stiff materials with different speeds of sound produces a table for which a wide range of vibrations are critically damped. Viscous fluids are used in between the stiff materials, to aid in damping.

==Breadboards==
An alternative to an optical table is an optical breadboard. Some optical systems use breadboards made of solid aluminum for later integration with a larger system with some form of vibration control. Most optical breadboards are constructed from
steel, aluminum, or carbon fiber sheets with honeycomb structure and can be placed on an ordinary table or workbench. Breadboards are not as good as optical tables, but weigh less and are adequate for smaller optical systems that do not require extremely high levels of mechanical stability. The low weight enables one to support these tables on soft air springs which reduce vibrations coming from the floor, although this increases vibrations due to acoustic noise.

The honeycomb structure reduces bending due to the breadboard&#x27;s own weight, so it can be tilted and forces applied via the soft spring supports accelerate the table as a whole without misalignment. Breadboards can therefore be used in mobile applications, such as on airplanes. Also, one can bolt a breadboard onto an optical table, build up a module of the experiment on it, and then transfer the module as a whole onto another table without the need to realign the components on the breadboard. Similarly, custom-built optical devices are assembled and aligned on breadboards, which are then enclosed in a case and shipped to the customer.

==Rails and benches==

An optical bench or optical rail is a simpler piece of hardware that provides a linear (or sometimes curved) track along which to mount optical elements. They are often used for simple experiments, especially for classroom demonstrations. Such rails are typically made of steel and designed to be very stiff, with features that allow holders for optical components to be bolted down and easily shifted along the length of the rail. Rails are common in laser assemblies where the beam path travels on a single axis.

A more sophisticated example is the silicon carbide ceramic toroidal optical bench in the Gaia spacecraft (illustrated), which supports several optical instruments.

<text>Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (also known as SPDC, parametric fluorescence or parametric scattering) is a nonlinear instant optical process that converts one photon of higher energy (namely, a pump photon) into a pair of photons (namely, a signal photon, and an idler photon) of lower energy, in accordance with the law of conservation of energy and law of conservation of momentum. It is an important process in quantum optics, for the generation of entangled photon pairs, and of single photons.

==Basic process==

A nonlinear crystal is used to produce pairs of photons from a photon beam. In accordance with the law of conservation of energy and law of conservation of momentum, the pairs have combined energies and momenta equal to the energy and momentum of the original photon. Because the index of refraction changes with frequency (dispersion), only certain triplets of frequencies will be phase-matched so that simultaneous energy and momentum conservation can be achieved. Phase-matching is most commonly achieved using birefringent nonlinear materials, whose index of refraction changes with polarization. As a result of this, different types of SPDC are categorized by the polarizations of the input photon (the pump) and the two output photons (signal and idler). If the signal and idler photons share the same polarization with each other and with the destroyed pump photon it is deemed Type-0 SPDC; if the signal and idler photons share the same polarization to each other, but are orthogonal to the pump polarization, it is Type-I SPDC; and if the signal and idler photons have perpendicular polarizations, it is deemed Type II SPDC.

The conversion efficiency of SPDC is typically very low, with the highest efficiency obtained on the order of 4x10−6 incoming photons for PPLN in waveguides. However, if one half of the pair is detected at any time then its partner is known to be present. The degenerate portion of the output of a Type I down converter is a squeezed vacuum that contains only even photon number terms. The nondegenerate output of the Type II down converter is a two-mode squeezed vacuum.

== Example ==
In a commonly used SPDC apparatus design, a strong laser beam, termed the &quot;pump&quot; beam, is directed at a BBO (beta-barium borate) or lithium niobate crystal. Most of the photons continue straight through the crystal. However, occasionally, some of the photons undergo spontaneous down-conversion with Type II polarization correlation, and the resultant correlated photon pairs have trajectories that are constrained along the sides of two cones whose axes are symmetrically arranged relative to the pump beam. Due to the conservation of momentum, the two photons are always symmetrically located on the sides of the cones, relative to the pump beam. In particular, the trajectories of a small proportion of photon pairs will lie simultaneously on the two lines where the surfaces of the two cones intersect. This results in entanglement of the polarizations of the pairs of photons emerging on those two lines. The photon pairs are in an equal weight quantum superposition of the unentangled states formula_1 and formula_2, corresponding to polarizations of left-hand side photon, right-hand side photon.

Another crystal is KDP (potassium dihydrogen phosphate) which is mostly used in Type I down conversion, where both photons have the same polarization.

Some of the characteristics of effective parametric down-converting nonlinear crystals include:

# Nonlinearity: The refractive index of the crystal changes with the intensity of the incident light. This is known as the nonlinear optical response.
# Periodicity: The crystal has a regular, repeating structure. This is known as the lattice structure, which is responsible for the regular arrangement of the atoms in the crystal.
# Optical anisotropy: The crystal has different refractive indices along different crystallographic axes.
# Temperature and pressure sensitivity: The nonlinearity of the crystal can change with temperature and pressure, and thus the crystal should be kept in a stable temperature and pressure environment.
# High nonlinear coefficient: Large nonlinear coefficient is desirable, this allow to generate a high number of entangled photons.
# High optical damage threshold: Crystal with high optical damage threshold can endure high intensity of the pumping beam.
# Transparency in the desired wavelength range: It is important for the crystal to be transparent in the wavelength range of the pump beam for efficient nonlinear interactions
# High optical quality and low absorption: The crystal should be high optical quality and low absorption to minimize loss of the pump beam and the generated entangled photons.

== History ==
SPDC was demonstrated as early as 1967 by S. E. Harris, M. K. Oshman, and R. L. Byer, as well as by D. Magde and H. Mahr. It was first applied to experiments related to coherence by two independent pairs of researchers in the late 1980s: Carroll Alley and Yanhua Shih, and Rupamanjari Ghosh and Leonard Mandel. The duality between incoherent (Van Cittert–Zernike theorem) and biphoton emissions was found.

== Applications ==

SPDC allows for the creation of optical fields containing (to a good approximation) a single photon. As of 2005, this is the predominant mechanism for an experimenter to create single photons (also known as Fock states). The single photons as well as the photon pairs are often used in quantum information experiments and applications like quantum cryptography and Bell test experiments.

SPDC is widely used to create pairs of entangled photons with a high degree of spatial correlation. Such pairs are used in ghost imaging, in which information is combined from two light detectors: a conventional, multi-pixel detector that does not view the object, and a single-pixel (bucket) detector that does view the object.

== Alternatives ==
The newly observed effect of two-photon emission from electrically driven semiconductors has been proposed as a basis for more efficient sources of entangled photon pairs. Other than SPDC-generated photon pairs, the photons of a semiconductor-emitted pair usually are not identical but have different energies. Until recently, within the constraints of quantum uncertainty, the pair of emitted photons were assumed to be co-located: they are born from the same location. However, a new nonlocalized mechanism for the production of correlated photon pairs in SPDC has highlighted that occasionally the individual photons that constitute the pair can be emitted from spatially separated points.

<text>Wincanton ( ) is a town and electoral ward in South Somerset, southwest England. The town lies off the A303 road, a main route between London and South West England, and has some light industry. In the 2021 census the civil parish had a population of 6,568.

==Etymology==
The name of Wincanton is first attested in 1084, in the forms &quot;Wincainietone&quot; and &quot;Wincautone&quot;. In the Domesday Book of 1086, the name is spelled &quot;Wincaleton&quot;. The town&#x27;s name comes from the name of the River Cale, which runs through the town and was in Old English called &quot;Wincawel&quot;, combined with the Old English word &quot;tūn&quot;, &quot;estate, settlement&quot;. It thus once meant &quot;estate on the River Cale&quot;.

The origin of the name of the River Cale itself is less clear. It is first attested in a fourteenth-century copy of a charter from 956, where it appears in the forms &quot;Cawel&quot; and &quot;Wricawel&quot;, the latter of which is agreed to be a scribal error for &quot;*Wincawel&quot;. The leading suggestion for the origin of this name is that &quot;cawel&quot; is the Brittonic word, meaning &quot;basket&quot;, found in Cornish as &quot;cawal&quot; and Welsh as &quot;cawell&quot; (borrowed from the Latin word *&quot;cavellum&quot; &#x27;basket&#x27;). If so, the baskets were perhaps fish-traps, and the river was named for their use in it. The &quot;win-&quot; element is the Brittonic word meaning &quot;white&quot;, and was not necessarily used literally: different arms of the same river were regularly distinguished by being labelled &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; (as in the rivers Whiteadder and Blackadder).

==History==
Windmill Hill was the site of a Bronze Age Beaker culture burial, and contemporary artefacts have been found on the Selwood Ridge.

Prior to the Norman Conquest Wincanton was frequently the scene of battles between the Britons, Danes and Saxons. During the reign of Edmund Ironside, the English, under his command, defeated the Danes, forcing them to leave England.

Cockroad Wood Castle, which is now in the parish of Charlton Musgrove, was a motte and bailey castle, probably built after the Norman conquest of England of 1066. The castle sits close to the contemporary Norman castles of Ballands and Castle Orchard, and may have been built as part of a system of fortifications to control the surrounding area. By 1086 the surrounding land was held by Walter of Douai, although no documentary evidence of the castle remains.

The parish of Wincanton was part of the Norton Ferris Hundred.

Wincanton was probably the site of a market in the medieval period but did not gain a market and fair charter until 1556.

The town was the scene of one of the few armed skirmishes in England during the Revolution of 1688. In the Wincanton Skirmish a troop of Horse Guards under Patrick Sarsfield, loyal to James II, defeated an advance party of troops fighting for William of Orange, on 20 November 1688. A great part of the town was destroyed by fires in the years 1707 and 1747.

In the early 19th century Wincanton was a depot for French officers, during the Napoleonic Wars.

By 2010 there had been an influx of foreign nationals, especially Portuguese and Polish citizens.

==Governance==

Wincanton is within the area of Somerset County Council and the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, with its own town council. The town council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic; their role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

The South Somerset district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, the library, roads, public transport, trading standards and waste disposal.

It is part of Glastonbury and Somerton, a constituency of the House of Commons. The current member of parliament is the Liberal Democrats politician Sarah Dyke. Prior to Brexit in 2020, residents of Wincanton also formed part of the electorate for the South West England constituency for elections to the European Parliament.

==Community services==
Wincanton Community Hospital in Dancing Lane was formerly known as Verrington Hospital and in March 2015 had 28 beds on two wards plus intermediate care unit. It opened as an Isolation Hospital in September 1910 for patients with scarlet fever.

The Balsam Centre is a Healthy Living Centre and also a Children&#x27;s Centre for Wincanton and South East Somerset.

The (War) Memorial Hall, which opened on 9 January 1959, has a stage as well as facilities for dancing or for seating 250. It also has a separate committee room that can seat 50.

Fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service.

==Geography==

Wincanton is situated on the northeast edge of Blackmore Vale, northeast of Yeovil, and northwest of Shaftesbury on the extreme southeast of Somerset close to the borders of Dorset and Wiltshire.

===Climate===
Along with the rest of South West England, Wincanton has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is about ; due to the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the UK. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between and . July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around .

Convective cloud often forms inland however, especially near hills, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1,600 hours.

Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. The Atlantic depressions are more vigorous in autumn and winter and most of the rain which falls in those seasons in the southwest is from this source. Average rainfall is about . November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the southwest.

==Economy==
In the late 1890s the West Surrey Central Dairy Company purchased a local creamery. In 1908, after developing a dried milk baby powder, it changed its name to Cow &amp; Gate. The creamery and dairy products factory had its own sidings from the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway station, providing access for milk trains.

In order to cope with the transport problems across its quickly expanding creamery, milk bottling and doorstep delivery network, Cow &amp; Gate formed a dedicated logistics arm in 1920. Spun out in 2002 from successor company Unigate, Wincanton plc is now a major logistics company. The company still has a dairy products base in the town, although its head office function moved to Chippenham, Wiltshire in 2005.

In 1999, Unigate sold its remaining dairies to Dairy Crest, which still has a creamery and milk processing plant in the town, but has sold the cheese business to Adams Foods Ltd, producer of the Pilgrim&#x27;s Choice brand of Cheddar cheese.

Several businesses are located in Wincanton, such as Coffee Sense Coffee Roasters who won a Guild of Fine Food Great Taste Award Winner in 2017 and Boxclever Press Ltd who gained Royal recognition in 2019 when they were awarded a Queen&#x27;s Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category

==Landmarks==

The Dogs (also called The Old House) was built around 1650, and was reshaped internally by Nathaniel Ireson in 1740–50. It is a grade I listed building.

Wincanton Town Hall, the third on its site, was completed in 1878.

==Transport==

The town had a railway station on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway but this closed on 7 March 1966.

The town is north of the A303 road, one of the main routes between London and South West England.

The nearest railway stations are in neighbouring Templecombe railway station on the Exeter to Waterloo line, and Castle Cary railway station on the Reading to Taunton and Heart of Wessex lines.

The town is served twice daily by Berrys Coaches &#x27;Superfast&#x27; service to and from London.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Somerset on 95.5 FM, Heart West on 102.6 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South West (formerly The Breeze) on 106.6 FM, Abbey104 on 104.7 FM and Radio Ninesprings, a community based station which broadcast to the town on 104.5 FM.

The town is served by the local newspaper, Western Gazette which publishes Thursdays.

==Education==

Primary education up to the age of 11 is offered by Wincanton Primary School and Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Primary School.
The history of Wincanton Primary began in 1833 when an appeal was launched to provide a National school in Wincanton and after a number of difficulties the school was built in North Street in 1838, although this had very few pupils. A school board was formed in 1871 and opened a school in the former National school buildings with over 200 pupils. In 1875 there were 206 children attending. In 1894 the board raised money for a new school to accommodate 445 children, which opened in South Street in 1897.

Wincanton has one secondary school, King Arthur&#x27;s School, which is Somerset&#x27;s first specialist Sports College.

The Balsam Centre is a Healthy Living Centre and also a Children&#x27;s Centre. Since 2005 it has received grants for the re-fitting of the training kitchen and construction and refurbishment to create a dedicated teaching area, counselling and interview rooms and a studio space for physical and community activities.

==Religious sites==

The Church of St Peter and St Paul was almost totally rebuilt in 1887-91 by J. D. Sedding; however, parts of the tower may be remnants of an earlier church, dating from 1313, on the same site. In 1793 the tower was raised by making it high; five bells were cast and a sixth added. The additional carving and north porch were added in subsequent years. The churchyard includes a self-designed monument to the local architect Nathaniel Ireson who died in 1796. Because of the state of the roofs, which are under repair, the church is included on the Heritage at Risk Register.

The Roman Catholic Church and Presbytery of St Luke and St Teresa was built in 1881 by the priest/architect A.J.C Scoles.

There are also places of worship for Pentecostals, Methodists, Baptists and Quakers in the town.

==Culture==

Wincanton Museum is a small local museum in the High Street which closed in 2010. You can now visit some of the items which were in the museum in the library which is situated in Carrington Way.

In 2023 the museum reopened in a new site on the high street, with free admission to view the artifacts’.

==Notable people==

The cartoonist Tony Weare was born in Wincanton.

==Sports==

The town gives its name to Wincanton Racecourse which is in the neighbouring parish of Charlton Musgrove.

Wincanton has a Non-League football club Wincanton Town F.C. who play at the Wincanton Sports Ground on Moor Lane. The Sports Ground in Moor Lane also provides facilities for tennis and bowls.

Wincanton Sports Centre was opened in 2001, funded by a National Lottery grant.

The cricket club, which plays in the recreation ground, has two Saturday teams and a Sunday team.

The rugby union club plays at King Arthur&#x27;s Community School in the town. In 2010 they won the Dorset &amp; Wilts division of the English Rugby Union South West Division.

==Twinning &amp; relation to &quot;Discworld&quot;==
Wincanton is unusual in that it was twinned in 2002 with a town which can only be found in fiction. As well as with Gennes / Les Rosiers in France and Lahnau in Germany, Wincanton is twinned with Ankh-Morpork, a fictional city state near the Circle Sea on Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Discworld. On 5 April 2009, a number of roads on a new housing development were given names taken from Ankh-Morpork, such as &quot;Peach Pie Street&quot; and &quot;Treacle Mine Road&quot;, after a short-list was voted upon by fans. There are shops in the town selling Discworld-related goods. In 2015 the &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; pub unveiled a sign by Discworld illustrator Richard Kingston referencing &quot;The Mended Drum&quot;. Pratchett and Kingston were regulars. The other Pratchett connection is to be found in Cale Park. A new bridge was built over the River Cale from the main park to the Children&#x27;s recreation area. The name &#x27;Troll Bridge&#x27; was chosen by the public from a list of nominations. This refers to a short story written by Terry Pratchett and a short film of the same name made by Snowgum Films.

<text>The Rosicrucian Fellowship (TRF) (&quot;An International Association of Christian Mystics&quot;) was founded in 1909 by Max Heindel with the aim of heralding the Aquarian Age and promulgating &quot;the true Philosophy&quot; of the Rosicrucians. It claims to present Esoteric Christian &quot;mysteries&quot; or esoteric knowledge, alluded to in Matthew 13:11 and Luke 8:10, to establish a meeting ground for art, religion, and science and to prepare the individual through harmonious development of the mind and the heart for selfless service of humanity.

The Rosicrucian Fellowship conducts Spiritual Healing Services and offers correspondence courses in esoteric Christianity, philosophy, &quot;spiritual astrology&quot; and Bible interpretation. Members of the Rosicrucian Fellowship are vegetarian and abstain from alcohol, recreational drugs and tobacco. Its headquarters are located on Mount Ecclesia in Oceanside, California, and its students are found throughout the world organized in centers and study groups. Its declared mission is to promulgate a scientific method of development suited particularly to the Western people whereby the &quot;Soul body&quot; may be wrought, so that humanity may hasten the Second Coming. Religious scholars classify the Rosicrucian Fellowship as a new religious movement.

==Origins and foundation==

In 1908 Max Heindel started, in New York City, the work of rewriting a previous draft in German of teachings ostensibly written under the instruction of Elder Brothers in their temple near the border of Bohemia and Germany. Heindel moved to Buffalo, New York, where he finished the typescript about September 1908. The work, called &quot;The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception&quot;, was revised and printed in November 1909.

The first edition of 2500 copies, printed in Chicago, was exhausted in six months but it was learned that 2000 of these had been given by the publisher as payment of the debts of the publishing house to other publishers. Immediately, a large second edition was ordered: a first payment was made to the printer with the help of Augusta Foss, who would become Max Heindel&#x27;s wife. This time two booksellers bought one-third of the imprint before it was off the press.

The Rosicrucian Fellowship&#x27;s formal constitution occurred on August 8, 1909, in Seattle, Washington, at 3:00 p.m. The first Rosicrucian study center had been already previously formed in Columbus, Ohio, on November 14, 1908, where Heindel lectured and taught for a number of months. After each lecture he distributed free mimeographed copies to the audience; those twenty lectures were printed in 1909, along with the first edition of &quot;Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception&quot;, under the title &quot;The Rosicrucian Christianity Lectures&quot;. The Columbus Center was followed by centers in North Yakima, Washington (November 1909), Portland, Oregon, and Los Angeles, California (February 27, 1910), the city where Heindel reencountered his theosophist friend Augusta Foss. In Los Angeles, Max Heindel gave conferences three times a week to audiences of nearly one thousand people from November 29, 1909, till March 17, 1910.

On October 28, 1911, the organisation&#x27;s international headquarters, still used today, were opened at Mount Ecclesia in Oceanside, California. The ceremony of ground-breaking consisted in planting a large Cross with the initials C.R.C. (for Christian Rosenkreuz, the legendary head of the original order) painted in gilt letters on the three upper ends and with a climbing rose. The Rosicrucian Fellowship Temple, called The Ecclesia, was erected for the purpose of affording more powerful means for the healing of disease, and dedicated on December 25, 1920. Spiritual Healing meetings are held there each day.

According to Max Heindel, the invisible Order of the Rose Cross exists in the inner worlds, was founded in 1313 and is composed of twelve great adepts presented as belonging to human evolution but already advanced far beyond the cycle of rebirth. Their mission is explained as aiming to prepare the &quot;whole wide world&quot; for a new phase in religion that includes awareness of the inner worlds and the subtle bodies and safe guidance in the gradual awakening of man&#x27;s latent spiritual faculties: &quot;to prepare a new phase of the Christian religion to be used during the coming age now at hand.&quot;

Admission into the Rosicrucian Fellowship is free of fees and is funded by donation. The Fellowship recognizes seven grades, but its study is primarily based upon a system of three grades: regular student, probationer and disciple. After a two-year term of being a Regular Student of the Fellowship, a person who abstains from all flesh food, tobacco, mind-altering drugs, and alcohol may apply for probationership. When the Probationer has complied with the necessary requirements and completed the term of probation he may send request for individual instruction. Access to the Disciple grade is granted upon merit; once admitted into discipleship subsequent Spiritual unfoldment of the &quot;advanced soul&quot; within the Order of the Rose Cross is conducted through the process of the nine Lesser Initiations.

== Teachings ==
The school&#x27;s teachings hold that man is a Spirit with all the powers of God, powers that are being slowly unfolded in a series of existences (rebirths) in a gradually-improving body, a process under the guidance of exalted Beings ordering our steps in a decreasing measure as man gradually acquires intellect and will. For this purpose we live many lives of increasingly fine texture and moral character. Through the &quot;Law of Cause and Consequence&quot; we constantly set new causes into operation which will create new destiny to balance and improve the old destiny brought from the past. All causes set into action in one life cannot be ripened in one existence but &quot;Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap&quot;.

===Constitution of man===

The human being is seen as a threefold Spirit, possessing a mind, by means of which he governs the threefold Body. This threefold body he transmutes into a threefold Soul upon which he nourishes himself &quot;from impotence into omnipotence&quot;.

The Ego (not as defined by Freud) is the threefold Spirit, the &quot;God Within&quot;, which uses these vehicles to gather experience in the school of life. The three aspects of the Spirit are (from highest to lowest aspect):
*the Divine Spirit aspect;
*the Life Spirit aspect;
*the Human Spirit aspect.

The Mental body functions like a mirror, reflecting the outer world and enabling the ego to transmit its commands as thought and word, and also to compel action.

The threefold body consists of;
*a Dense body, which is the visible instrument he uses here in this world to fetch and carry (the body we ordinarily think of as the whole man).
*a Vital body, which is made of ether and pervades the visible body as ether permeates all other forms, except that human beings specialize a greater amount of the universal ether than other forms. The ethereal body is our instrument for specializing the vital energy of the sun and is seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about an inch and a half outside our visible body.
*a Desire body, which is our emotional nature and this finer vehicle pervades both the vital and dense bodies (it is seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about 16 inches outside our visible body, which is located in the center of this ovoid cloud as the yolk is in the center of an egg).

The threefold soul consists of;
*Conscious Soul: extracted as pabulum from the dense body (which was emanated from the Divine Spirit aspect).
*Intellectual Soul: extracted as pabulum from the vital body (which was emanated from the Life Spirit aspect).
*Emotional Soul: extracted as pabulum from the desire body (which was emanated from the Human Spirit aspect).
Bible teachings enable us to become aware that Jesus Christ must be born within. There is a distinction between the Christ which is born within us, our true Saviour, and the Cosmic Christ, the Christ without. The latter helps us in the task of having Christ born within; however, it is our task to form the Christ within, the &quot;Soul Body&quot; which is the vehicle humanity will need to live in the Sixth Epoch, the &quot;New Galilee&quot;.

The &quot;Astral body&quot; is a vehicle evolved from a work of transmutation upon the etheric body (the two superior ethers), not to be confounded with the &quot;desire body&quot; since during astral projection the desire body molds itself readily into this prepared matrix and, when the individual returns to the physical body, the effort of will whereby he enters automatically dissolves the intimate connection between the desire body and the Astral or Soul body. The term &quot;Astral body&quot; was, it is said, employed by the mediaeval Alchemists because of the ability it conferred upon the one who has it to traverse the &quot;starry&quot; regions. The &quot;Astral body&quot; is regarded as the &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; or &quot;Living Stone&quot; of the alchemist, the Golden &quot;Wedding Garment&quot; that Christ speaks of in the Gospel of Matthew, the &quot;Soul Body&quot; [&quot;soma psuchicon&quot;] that Paul mentions in the First Epistle to the Corinthians or the &quot;Diamond Soul&quot; spoken of in some of the ancient philosophies. It will eventually be evolved by humanity as a whole.

The physical body is a vehicle which the Spirit uses to gain experience, while death is a passing of the Spirit into a larger sphere, a birth which should be prepared for with the greatest care. The Ego must assimilate what it has experienced. The Spirit withdraws with the two higher vehicles, which are tied to the etheric and physical bodies by a slender cord. At death the desire and mental bodies leave the physical, taking with them but one permanent etheric atom, which during life is stationed in the solar plexus. The seed atom, of the dense body, like the negative film of the camera, has been impressed with all the experiences of the life just ended. At death the force of this atom leave the body and all these impressions are transferred from the vital body, the storehouse of these experiences, into the desire body, which then forms the basis of the man or woman&#x27;s life in purgatory and the first heaven. This transfer is done by the Spirit during the first three and one-half days (84 hours) after the rupture of the connection between the seed atom and the heart, ordinarily known as death: death is not complete until this transfer has been accomplished. During this time sensation is still present, and the Spirit suffers through inharmonious surroundings, including postmortem examination and embalming.

Death should be prepared for with the greatest care, requiring a &quot;post mortem interval&quot;, or preservation period, of the physical body for three and half days (84 hours), for life review purpose (in a pacific death; not in a sudden impact such as: shock, accident, catastrophe, heart attack or suicide), before cremation or any other way of body disposal.

===Cosmology===

The evolution of man is divided into seven Periods:
*&quot;involution&quot;: the Saturn Period, the Sun Period, the Moon Period;
*the Earth Period (first half still &quot;involution&quot;, second half towards &quot;evolution&quot;);
*&quot;evolution&quot;: the Jupiter Period, the Venus Period, the Vulcan Period.
We are presently in the second half of the Earth Period: we have just passed the end of our involution and are beginning our evolution, or the spiritualization of matter and our return to God our Father.

The three Aspects of God are Will, Wisdom and Activity. The Father has completed His union with the first aspect, will. The Son, Christ, the highest Initiate of the Sun Period: has completed His union with the Second aspect of God, wisdom. Jehovah, the Highest Initiate of the Moon Period, has completed His union with the third aspect, activity.

The sevenfold constitution of man is related to five of seven worlds, different planes of existence having varying density and vibration, states of spirit-matter not separated by space or distance but permeating one another, so that God and the other great beings pervade their own realms and those of greater density than their own, including our own. Some worlds are related to the planet and the higher ones to the whole Solar System. These seven worlds are the planes of evolution of each Solar System and constitute the seventh and lower cosmic plane; the six superior cosmic planes possibly each have a different and larger structural and dynamic expression in the physical universe.

*The World of God
*The World of Virgin Spirits: home of the virgin spirits, differentiated within God Himself as &quot;sparks from a flame&quot; at the beginning of manifestation, prior to the beginning of pilgrimage through matter
*The World of Divine Spirit: related to the threefold Spirit&#x27;s Divine Spirit aspect; home of The Father, inhabited by the &quot;Lords of Wisdom&quot;, a hierarchy of Elohim astrologically associated with Virgo 
*The World of Life Spirit: related to the Ego&#x27;s life spirit aspect; home of the Christ (The Son, the Solar Logos); inhabited by the &quot;Lords of Individuality&quot;, a Hierarchy of Elohim astrologically associated to Libra; higher Memory of Nature, events from the earliest dawn of our present manifestation, open only to Adepts and higher Spiritual Beings
*The World of Thought
**Region of Abstract Thought: inhabited by the &quot;Lords of Form&quot;, a Hierarchy of Elohim astrologically associated to Scorpio; the &quot;Third heaven&quot; state of consciousness; Germinal idea(s); related to the Ego&#x27;s human spirit aspect; the home of Jehova, The Holy Spirit. This Great Hierarchy is the evolved form of the third aspect of God, the creative energy in Nature, which is reflected in man as sex energy; the misuse or abuse of that power, the holy creative force [of God] in man, for gratification of the passionate nature, and particularly perversion (see also human sexual behaviour), constitutes the sin against the Holy “Ghost”. The &quot;great transgression&quot;, the abuse of sex or generative force for sense gratification, must be expiated, under the Law of Cause and Consequence, through suffering in diseased and incapacitated bodies and minds, mainly afflicted with developmental disabilities, as there is a close connection between sexual activity and mental activity as well as the power of speech – and incurable cancer (see also carcinogenesis and cancer treatment) for those who abuse the sex function in a very marked and bestial degree. Thus the ignorant use of the generative force is primarily responsible for pain, sickness and sorrow. 
**Region of Concrete Thought: related to the Mind; inhabited by the &quot;Lords of Mind&quot;, a Hierarchy of Elohim astrologically associated to Sagittarius; the &quot;Second heaven&quot; state of consciousness; Archetypes; memory of nature in the highest subdivision (covering the essence of a whole life or event); ocean of harmony: the Music of the Spheres
*The Desire World, the world of color: related to the Desire body; home of the Archangels, astrologically associated to Capricorn; the abode of deceased persons for some time subsequent to the event of death
**higher regions, Attraction, the &quot;First heaven&quot; state of consciousness
**intermediate region, Interest and Indifference
**lower regions, Repulsion, the &quot;Purgatory&quot; state of consciousness
*The Physical World, composed of seven regions;
**Etheric Region: related to the etheric body; home of the Angels (seen as being one step beyond the human stage, as humans are a degree in advance of the animal evolution), astrologically associated to Aquarius; Akashic records in the &quot;reflecting ether&quot; (pictures at least several hundred years back or much more in some cases, almost as the pictures on a screen, scene shifts backward). The etheric region is subdivided in four regions according to the grades of density of the aether permeating our physical planet Earth; Reflecting Ether, Light Ether, Life Ether and Chemical Ether.
**Chemical Region; the physical Earth as perceived through the five senses enhanced by the current technological equipment, subdivided in three regions according to the four main states of matter: solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma. It is the current home of the self-conscious humanity, astrologically associated to Pisces. The &quot;Chemical region&quot; of the physical world is home to four life waves, or &quot;kingdoms&quot;, at a different stage in the evolutionary path: mineral life is the first and lowest level of spiritual evolution on Earth; then comes plants, with actual life, then animals (cold-blooded animals, then warm-blooded), and finally the human being. The beings belonging to each life wave either evolve through the work of the individual Spirit (human being) or are yet evolving under a group spirit and have acquired more or less subtle bodies according to the development stage of each life wave.

The worlds of matter (Physical world, Desire world and World of Thought/Region of Concrete Thought) are considered to be a reverse reflection of the worlds of Spirit (World of Thought/Region of Abstract Thought, World of Life Spirit and World of Divine Spirit).

===Vegetarianism===

Members of the Rosicrucian Fellowship cannot consume alcohol, meat or use tobacco. They advocate a vegetarian diet for ethical and spiritual reasons. They also recommend that vegetables be eaten raw as cooking destroys valuable cell salts. They have stated that the &quot;vegetarian diet is most conducive to health and purity; that meat of all kinds, including fish and fowl, also alcoholic drinks, tobacco, and stimulants are injurious to health and spirituality&quot;.

<doc id="1042506" wikidata="Q337767" url="?curid=1042506" title="Wilusa">
<text>Wilusa () or Wilusiya was a Late Bronze Age city in western Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) known from references in fragmentary Hittite records. The city is notable for its identification with the archaeological site of Troy, and thus its potential connection to the legendary Trojan War.

== Identification with Troy ==
Wilusa has been identified with the archaeological site of Troy. This correspondence was first proposed in 1924 by Emil Forrer, who also suggested that the name Ahhiyawa corresponds to the Homeric term for the Greeks, &quot;Achaeans&quot;. Forrer&#x27;s work was primarily motivated by linguistic similarities, since &quot;Wilusa&quot; and the associated placename &quot;Taruisa&quot; show striking parallels to the Greek names &quot;Wilios&quot; and &quot;Troia&quot; respectively. Subsequent research on Hittite geography has lent these identifications additional support and they are now generally accepted by scholars, though they are not regarded as firmly established.

One alternative hypothesis proposes that Wilusa was located near Beycesultan, which was known in the Byzantine era as &quot;Iluza&quot; ().

== Historical record ==

Wilusa first appears in the historical record around 1400 BC, when it was one of the twenty-two states of the Assuwa Confederation which formed in an unsuccessful attempt to oppose the Hittite Empire. This event is referenced in several surviving Hittite documents including the &quot;Annals of Tudhaliya I/II&quot;, which gives a detailed account of the Assuwans&#x27; defeat and its aftermath. In this document, the name of the city is rendered as &quot;Wilusiya&quot; rather than the later form &quot;Wilusa&quot;, and it is listed separately from &quot;Taruisa&quot;. Circumstantial evidence raises the possibility that Ahhiyawans may have supported the rebellion. For instance, a Mycenaean-style sword found at Hattusa bears an inscription suggesting that it was taken from an Assuwan soldier and left as an offering to the Hittite storm god.

By the late 1300s BC, Wilusa was politically aligned with the Hittites. Under the reign of Kukkunni, Wilusa maintained peaceful relations with Suppiluliuma I even as nearby kingdoms in Arzawa once again rebelled. By the early 1200s BC, Wilusa had become a vassal state of the Hittites. This political arrangement, common between Western Anatolian states and the Hittites, consisted of mutual treaty obligations whereby the local ruler would support Hittite political interests in exchange for having their claim to power backed by the Hittite military. One surviving example of such a treaty is the &quot;Alaksandu Treaty&quot; made between a Wilusan king named Alaksandu and the Hittite king Muwatalli II. One of the gods guaranteeing the treaty on behalf of Wilusa is Apaliunas (Apollo). As outlined in the document, Alaksandu&#x27;s obligations included both timely intelligence about potential anti-Hittite activity as well as soldiers for military expeditions. Some evidence suggests that Muwatalli invoked this later obligation, as Wilusan soldiers appear to have served in the Hittite army during the Battle of Kadesh. 

At some point during Muwatalli&#x27;s reign, he had to send an army to reassert Hittite control over Wilusa. The exact circumstances of this event are unclear, since it is only known from a brief mention in the poorly preserved Manapa-Tarhunta letter. One hypothesis suggests that the ruler of Wilusa had been deposed by Piyamaradu, a local warlord who toppled other pro-Hittite rulers in the area while acting on behalf the Ahhiyawa. This interpretation finds potential support in the later Tawagalawa letter which alludes to a previous disagreement between the Hittites and Ahhiyawa concerning Wilusa. However, this evidence is not conclusive since the Tawagalawa letter does not specify whether the disagreement escalated beyond strongly worded cuneiform tablets, and the Manapa-Tarhunta letter does not directly connect Piyamaradu to the trouble in Wilusa. Evidence against this interpretation includes a section divider in the Manapa-Tarhunta letter which seems to suggest that Piyamaradu&#x27;s activities and the Wilusa event were separate topics. Thus, there is no scholarly consensus as to whether the king of Wilusa was deposed by Piyamaradu, by an internal uprising, or remained in power while rebelling against the Hittites.

The final reference to Wilusa in the historical record appears in the Milawata letter, sent by the Hittite king Tudhaliya IV to one of his key vassals in western Anatolia, likely the king of Mira. Tudhaliya&#x27;s letter requests that the recipient send him Walmu, the recently deposed pro-Hittite king of Wilusa, whom he intends to reinstall. The letter promises that although Walmu will be the ruler of Wilusa, the recipient will maintain ultimate authority over the various kingdoms in the region. The letter does not specify how Walmu was deposed, though its discussion of the geopolitical situation in western Anatolia makes clear that the Ahhiyawa were no longer a major power.

In popular writing, these anecdotes have been interpreted as evidence for an historical kernel in myths of the Trojan War. However, scholars have not found historical evidence for any particular event from the legends, and the Hittite documents do not suggest that Wilusa-Troy was ever attacked by Greeks-Ahhiyawa themselves. Noted Hittiteologist Trevor Bryce cautions that our current understanding of Wilusa&#x27;s history does not provide evidence for there having been an actual Trojan War since &quot;the less material one has, the more easily it can be manipulated to fit whatever conclusion one wishes to come up with&quot;.

=== Known Kings of Wilusa ===

* Kukkunni (?) – a predecessor of Alaksandus, contemporary with Šuppiluliuma I.
* Alaksandu ( – after 1280 BC) – contemporary with the Hittite kings Mursili II and Muwatalli II, signing peace treaties with them.
* Walmu ( – after 1220 BC) – vassal of the Hittite king Tudhaliya IV and the state of Mira, dethroned following a possible occupation of the raids by the Ahhiyawa people. The letter from Millawata (Miletus) states that Walmu sought political asylum from Tarkasnawa, his suzerain in the kingdom of Mira. It seems that King Tudhaliya IV urged Tarkasnawa to send Walmu to the Hittite Kingdom so that he could reinstate him on the throne and return to the vassal position of both as he had been in the past.

<doc id="1042508" wikidata="Q7693933" url="?curid=1042508" title="Top Oil">
<text>Top Oil (formally Tedcastles Oil Products Unlimited Company) is an Irish-based petrol company founded in 1960 which trades under the brand name &quot;Top&quot;. Before a rebranding in 1998, the company variously traded as &quot;Tedcastles Oil Products&quot;, &quot;Tedcastles Oil&quot;, &quot;Tedcastles&quot; and &quot;T.O.P.&quot;, and prior to that as &quot;Tedcastle McCormick&quot;. Top Oil is a medium-sized Irish distributor of petroleum fuels.

==History==
The business was founded by Robert Tedcastle as a coal merchant in 1800, later diversifying in the heating business and entering the petroleum business. It was subsequently renamed as Tedcastle and McCormick, then Tedcastle, McCormick and Co. Ltd., and then Tedcastles Oil Products.

In 1926, the business became an associate company of the Coast Lines group. It established branches in Clonmel, Cork, Foynes, Limerick, Newcastle West and Waterford. In 1950, it returned to private ownership, with John P Reihill as chair. In the 1950s and early 1960s, it opened branches in Belfast, Dundalk and Sligo.

In the late 20th century, the business variously traded as &quot;Tedcastles Oil Products&quot;, &quot;Tedcastles Oil&quot;, &quot;Tedcastles&quot; and &quot;T.O.P.&quot;. In 1998, it underwent a rebrand as &quot;Top Oil&quot; with a green colour scheme that has changed little since.

The Tedcastle Group was acquired by Irving Oil of Canada in 2018.

==Petrol stations==
The company operates petrol stations mainly outside Dublin. It has over 205 locations nationwide ( 25 of them are company owned).
In 2010, Top Oil acquired a fuel company in Galway called Sweeney Oil, out of receivership for a nominal purchase price . Top oil have grown in recent years through vulture purchasing of distressed oil companies from bank receivership, examples including Tougher Oil in Kildare and Sweeney Oil in Galway.
In late 2010, Top Oil&#x27;s 6 separate sites were finally opened along the Galway motorway, which are all in alliance with Applegreen.
In 2012, the brand was changed to Top Oil – Fueling Ireland and in 2016, the company re-entered the forecourt shop sector with the acquisition of 10 company owned locations.

==Convenience stores==
From 1998 to 2004, the company operated a convenience store chain on a franchise basis with ADM Londis. These stores were known as &quot;Londis Topshop&quot;. This allowed forecourts to become franchisees of both Londis and Top at once. However it also had high street stores in competition with ADM Londis itself. In 2004, the stores were acquired by ADM and rebranded to simply Londis.

In 2018, Top Oil works in partnership with a number of retailers across their network including SPAR, Mace and Daybreak.

==Competition==
Top Oil&#x27;s main competition comes from Maxol, Certa, Texaco and Circle K.

<doc id="1042512" wikidata="Q7243151" url="?curid=1042512" title="Primary metaphor">
<text>In cognitive linguistics, a primary metaphor is an ingrained association between certain pairs of distinct concepts. These innate conceptual metaphors inform cognition, and are theorised to arise unconsciously from experienced events. Primary metaphors persist across languages because basic embodied experiences, which form their basis, are universal.

In these associated pairs of concepts, one can be said to be the &quot;source&quot; concept, which is usually grounded in a measurable experience, while the other is the &quot;target&quot; concept, which is usually more abstract and subjective. They may arise via conflation during early development, before the subject is able to distinguish the two concepts.

One example is the association of &quot;heaviness&quot; with &quot;difficulty&quot;. Likewise, there is a correlation between &quot;knowing&quot; and &quot;seeing&quot; forming the primary metaphor &quot;knowing is seeing&quot;. Understanding an expression such as &quot;glass ceiling&quot; rests on two such primary metaphors. Evidence for primary metaphors is usually observed in the use of language, though evidence from the visual domain has also been researched. 
The term &quot;primary metaphor&quot; was coined by linguist Joseph Grady.

<doc id="1042514" wikidata="Q649817" url="?curid=1042514" title="Mongolian gerbil">
<text>The Mongolian gerbil or Mongolian jird (&quot;Meriones unguiculatus&quot;) is a rodent belonging to the subfamily Gerbillinae. Their body size is typically , with a tail, and body weight , with adult males larger than females. The animal is used in science and research or kept as a small house pet. Their use in science dates back to the latter half of the 19th century, but they only started to be kept as pets in the English-speaking world after 1954, when they were brought to the United States. However, their use in scientific research has fallen out of favor.

== Taxonomy and evolution ==
The first known mention of gerbils came in 1866, by Father Armand David, who sent &quot;yellow rats&quot; to the French National Museum of Natural History in Paris, from northern China. They were named &quot;Gerbillus unguiculatus&quot; by the scientist Alphonse Milne-Edwards in 1867.

There is a popular misconception about the meaning of this scientific name, appearing both in printed works and in websites, due to the genus Meriones sharing the name with Greek warrior Meriones in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;; however, translations like &quot;clawed warrior&quot; are incorrect. The genus was named by Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger in 1811, deriving from the Greek word &quot;μηρος&quot; (femur). Combined with &#x27;unguiculate&#x27;, meaning to have claws or nails in Latin, the name can be loosely translated as &#x27;clawed femur&#x27;.

==Habitat==
Mongolian gerbils inhabit grassland, shrubland and desert, including semidesert and steppes in China, Mongolia, and the Russian Federation.

Soil on the steppes is sandy and is covered with grasses, herbs, and shrubs. The steppes have cool, dry winters and hot summers. The temperature can get up to , but the average temperature for most of the year is around .

In the wild, these gerbils live in patriarchal groups generally consisting of one parental pair, the most recent litter, and a few older pups; sometimes the dominant female&#x27;s sister(s) also live with them. Only the dominant females will produce pups, and will mostly mate with the dominant male while in estrus (heat), female gerbils are generally more loyal than male gerbils. One group of gerbils generally ranges over .

A group lives in a central burrow with 10–20 exits. Some deeper burrows with only one to three exits in their territory may exist. These deeper burrows are used to escape from predators when they are too far from the central burrow. A group&#x27;s burrows often interconnect with other groups.

==In science==
Gerbils have a long history of use in scientific research, although nowadays they are rarely used. For example, in the United Kingdom in 2017, only around 300 Mongolian gerbils were used in experimental procedures, compared to over 2 million mice.

=== Tumblebrook Farm ===
Most gerbils used in scientific research are derived from the Tumblebrook Farm strain, which has its origins in 20 pairs of wild-caught Mongolian gerbils sent to Japan in 1935. Eleven of these animals were subsequently sent to Dr. V. Schwentker&#x27;s Tumblebrook Farm in Brant Lake, New York, United States in 1954, with additional animals later sent to Charles River Ltd in Italy in 1996.

=== Hearing ===
Gerbils have a wide hearing range, from detection of low frequency foot drumming to higher frequency chirps and therefore may be a more suitable model of human hearing loss than mice and rats, which are high-frequency specialists.

=== Vocal ===
Male gerbils can produce ultrasonic sounds with frequencies ranging from approximately 27 to 35 kHz and amplitudes ranging from approximately 0 to 70 dBa. Their larynx is involved in the production of these ultrasonic sounds. Experimentation revealed five findings of interest, which are that adults only emit ultrasonic sounds when stimulated socially, males signal more frequently than females, dominant males are more active in vocalizations than subordinate males, ultrasounds are triggered by conspecific odors, and that d-amphetamine, a central nervous system stimulant, contributes high levels of ultrasounds while chlorpromazine, an antipsychotic medication, lowers the emission rate. 

=== Epilepsy ===
10–20% of gerbils exhibit spontaneous epileptiform seizures, typically in response to a stressor such as handling or cage cleaning. Epilepsy in gerbils has a genetic basis, and seizure-prone and seizure-resistant lines have been bred.

=== Diabetes ===
Like other desert rodents such as fat sandrats, Mongolian gerbils are susceptible to diet-induced diabetes, although incidence is low. A diabetes-prone line has recently been generated, showing that gerbil diabetes has at least some genetic basis.

=== Genetics and genomics ===
Laboratory gerbils are derived from a small number of founders, and so genetic diversity was generally assumed to be low. Initial genetic studies based on small numbers of genetic markers appeared to support this, but more recent genome-wide Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) data has shown that genetic diversity is actually quite high. It has been suggested that laboratory gerbils should be considered domesticated, and designated &quot;&quot;M. unguiculatus&quot; forma domestica&quot; to differentiate them from wild animals. A Mongolian gerbil genome sequence was published in 2018 and a genetic map comprising 22 linkage groups (one per chromosome) in 2019.

===Reproduction===

In the wild, Mongolian gerbils breed in February and October. Males do not become sexually mature for about 70–80 days, while the vaginal opening occurs in females about 33–50 days after birth. For other gerbils such as the hairy footed gerbil, sexual maturity has a slightly earlier and longer window of 60-90 days in comparison with a later and shorter window for Mongolian gerbils, 70–84 days. Females reach sexual maturity shortly after this opening occurs. They experience oestrus cycles every 4–6 days. Mongolian gerbils are regarded as monogamous within science. Even with this said, many Mongolian gerbils have still been found in laboratory tests regarding their sexual reproduction behavior to have shown signs of promiscuity and mating with other females while their monogamous partner is absent in laboratory setting.

Gerbils are for the most part selective when it comes to picking a mate for copulation. An average litter size for the Mongolian Gerbil is around 4–8 pups. If the litter only contains around 1–2 young then the mother will neglect them and they will die from starvation. Mongolian Gerbils are monogamous and mate with their selected partner for life. When their mate dies, many gerbils refrain from seeking other mates to reproduce with. Males generally find new mates whereas females may not. When older females lose their mate they almost always give up on seeking reproduction. Their behavior tends to vary when faced with different settings; in the wild, the large population of gerbils means that finding and selecting a mate is not a problem. Within a laboratory setting, though, many gerbils tend to keep to themselves and refrain from copulation.

==Behavior==
Gerbils are social animals, and live in groups in the wild. They rely on their sense of smell to identify other members of their clan. Gerbils are known to attack and often kill those carrying an unfamiliar scent. Groups of gerbils often have a &quot;dominant&quot; gerbil which may &quot;bully&quot; the others by humping them.

== Relationship with humans ==
===As pets===
A gentle and hardy animal, the Mongolian gerbil has become a popular small house pet. It was first brought from China to Paris in the 19th century, and became a popular house pet there. It was later brought to the United States in 1954 by Dr. Victor Schwentker for use in research. Dr. Schwentker soon recognized their potential as pet animals. Selective breeding for the pet trade has resulted in a wide range of different color and pattern varieties. Gerbils became popular pets in the US around the late 1950s and were imported to the United Kingdom in 1964, where they became popular pets too. They are now found in pet shops throughout the UK and the US.

However, due to the threat they pose to indigenous ecosystems and existing agricultural operations, it is illegal to purchase, import, or keep a gerbil as a pet in the U.S. state of California. It is also illegal to import the animal into New Zealand and Australia.
Gerbils are typically not aggressive, and they rarely bite unprovoked or without stress. They are small and easy to handle, since they are sociable creatures that enjoy the company of humans and other gerbils. Gerbils also have adapted their kidneys to produce a minimum of waste to conserve body fluids, which makes them very clean with little odor. Gerbils have many different aesthetic coat patterns, such as pied slate, described below.

===Health concerns===

Misalignment of incisors due to injury or malnutrition may result in overgrowth, which can cause injury to the roof of the mouth. Symptoms include a dropped or loss of appetite, drooling, weight loss, or foul breath.

Common injuries are caused by gerbils being dropped or falling, often while inside of a hamster ball, which can cause broken limbs or a fractured spine (for which there is no treatment).

A common problem for all small rodents is neglect, which can cause the gerbils to not receive adequate food and water, causing serious health concerns, including dehydration, starvation, stomach ulcers, eating of bedding material, and cannibalism.

Between 20 and 50% of pet gerbils have the seizure disorder epilepsy. The seizures are thought to be caused by fright, handling, or a new environment. The attacks can be mild to severe, but do not typically appear to have any long-term effects, except for rare cases where death results from very severe seizures. A way to prevent a gerbil from having a seizure is to refrain from blowing in the animal&#x27;s face (often used to &quot;train&quot; the pet not to bite). This technique is used in a lab environment to induce seizures for medical research.

Tumors, both benign and malignant, are fairly common in pet gerbils, and are most common in females over the age of two. Usually, the tumors involve the ovaries, causing an extended abdomen, or the skin, with tumors most often developing around the ears, feet, midabdomen, and base of the tail, appearing as a lump or abscess.

Gerbils can lose their tails due to improper handling, being attacked by another animal, or getting their tails stuck. The first sign is a loss of fur from the tip of the tail, then, the skinless tail dies off and sloughs, with the stump usually healing without complications.

The most common infectious disease in gerbils is Tyzzer&#x27;s disease, a bacterial disease, which stress can make animals more susceptible to. It produces symptoms such as ruffled fur, lethargy, hunched posture, poor appetite, diarrhoea, and often death. It quickly spreads between gerbils in close contact.

A problem with the inner ear may cause a gerbil to lean noticeably to one side. This may be caused by ear infections. Gerbils with &quot;extreme white spotting&quot; colouring are susceptible to deafness; this is thought to be due to the lack of pigmentation in and around the ear.

===Captive-bred gerbils===
Many color varieties of gerbils are available in pet shops today, generally the result of years of selective breeding.

Over 20 different coat colors occur in the Mongolian gerbil, which has been captive-bred the longest.

The fat-tailed gerbil or duprasi is also kept as a pet. They are smaller than the common Mongolian gerbils, and have long, soft coats and short, fat tails, appearing more like a hamster. The variation on the normal duprasi coat is more gray in color, which may be a mutation, or it may be the result of hybrids between the Egyptian and Algerian subspecies of duprasi.

White spotting has been reported in not only the Mongolian gerbil, but also the pallid gerbil and possibly Sundervall&#x27;s Jird.

A long-haired mutation, a grey agouti or chinchilla mutation, white spotting, and possibly a dilute mutation have also appeared in Shaw&#x27;s jirds, and white spotting and a dilute mutation have shown up in bushy-tailed jirds.

<text>Tiziano Terzani (; 14 September 1938 – 28 July 2004) was an Italian journalist and writer, best known for his extensive knowledge of 20th century East Asia and for being one of the very few western reporters to witness both the fall of Saigon to the hands of the Viet Cong and the fall of Phnom Penh at the hands of the Khmer Rouge in the mid-1970s.

==Early life ==
Terzani was born in Florence to poor working-class parents. His mother was a hatmaker and his father worked in a mechanic workshop. He attended the University of Pisa as a law student and studied at the prestigious &quot;Collegio Medico-Giuridico&quot; of the Scuola Normale Superiore, which today is Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies. After graduating, he worked for Olivetti, an office equipment producer. In 1965 he went on a business trip to Japan. This was his first contact with Asia and his first step towards his decision to change his life radically and explore Asia. During these years he again began writing for &quot;l&#x27;Astrolabio&quot;. He then resigned from Olivetti and moved to New York to study at Columbia University at the School of International and Public Affairs in order to study Chinese language and culture.

==Career as a journalist==
After a first stint as a journalist with &quot;Il Giorno&quot;, in 1971 he moved to Singapore as a reporter, with his German-descent wife, Angela Staude, and their two small children, as the Asian correspondent for the German weekly &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;. He then offered his collaboration to the Italian daily newspapers &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; and &quot;La Repubblica&quot;. In the meantime, on a semi-secret level, he sent regular information about East Asian politics to the Banca Commerciale Italiana, which was headed by Raffaele Mattioli.

Terzani knew much about the historical and political background of Asia but had also a deep interest in the philosophical aspects of Asian culture. Though an unbeliever, he always looked in his journeys for the spiritual aspects of the countries he was visiting. He lived for years at a time in Beijing, Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong, Bangkok and New Delhi. While staying in Hong Kong working as a journalist, he had a name in Chinese, 鄧天諾 (Deng Tiannuo) (meaning: &quot;heavenly/godly promise&quot;). His stay in Beijing in the 1980s came to an end when he was arrested and expelled in 1984 from the country for &quot;counter-revolutionary activities&quot;. He stopped using his Chinese name after this incident. Based on his experiences in China, he wrote &quot;La Porta Proibita&quot; (&quot;Behind The Forbidden Door&quot;).

==Books and essays==
Terzani&#x27;s experiences in Asia are described in articles and essays in newspapers, as well as in the several books that he wrote. In his first book, &quot;Pelle di leopardo&quot; (&quot;Leopard Hide&quot;) (1973), he describes the last phases of the Vietnam War. The following recollection, &quot;Giai Phong! The Fall and Liberation of Saigon&quot;, recounts the takeover of Vietnam&#x27;s capital by the Vietcong and the scramble of the last Westerners to escape with American helicopters; he stayed there for some time and witnessed the changes. Two years later he nearly died while trying to document the new &quot;Democratic Kampuchea&quot;: the Khmer Rouge tried to execute him after his arrival in the border town of Poipet, and he saved his life only by his knowledge of the Chinese language. In what is perhaps his most well-known book, &quot;Un indovino mi disse&quot; (&quot;A Fortune-Teller Told Me&quot;), Terzani describes his travels across Asia by land and sea following the advice and warning from a fortune teller in Hong Kong that he must avoid aeroplanes for the whole year of 1993. One chapter of the book is entirely dedicated to Ferdynand Ossendowski, a Polish traveller. Ryszard Kapuściński wrote about this book &quot;A great book written in the best traditions of literary journalism... profound, rich and reflective&quot;. Kapuściński and Terzani shared the same vision of journalism. 
After 9/11 he wrote &quot;Lettere contro la guerra&quot; (&quot;Letters Against the War&quot;). The book was born as a response to the anti-Islamic invectives published by the Italian journalist and author Oriana Fallaci on the daily &quot;Il Corriere della Sera&quot; on 29 September 2001.

==Final work and death==
In his last book &quot;Un altro giro di giostra&quot; (&quot;One More Ride on the Merry-go-round&quot;), in 2001, Terzani deals with his illness, a bowel cancer which eventually led to his death in 2004, but not before he had travelled and searched through countries and civilizations, looking for a cure and for a new vision of life. A short excerpt from his book: &quot;...after a while, the goal of my journey was not the cure for my cancer anymore, but for the sickness which affects all of us: mortality&quot;. Terzani spent the early 2000s in confinement in the mountainous Himalayas region, in a small hut that he rented in order to meditate and work on his books. He only seldom visited his family in Italy but had to desist from his isolation when his sickness advanced too much. He returned to Italy, spending the last months of his life with his wife and grown son in Orsigna, a little village in the Apennine Mountains in the province of Pistoia that he considered &quot;his true, last love&quot;.

Terzani died on 28 July 2004, aged 65. His last memories are recorded in an interview for Italian television entitled &quot;Anam&quot;, an Indian word that literally means &quot;the one with no name&quot;, an appellative he gained during an experience in an ashram in India.

==Legacy and Biopic==
His testament book &quot;La fine è il mio inizio&quot; (&quot;The End Is My Beginning&quot;), co-authored with his son Folco, was published posthumously in March 2006 and sold 400,000 copies in 4 months. According to &quot;The Times&quot; its supposedly New Age theme has been allegedly attacked by Vatican and certain Roman Catholic sources, such as the newspaper &quot;Avvenire&quot;. However, reading the articles related to Terzani in &quot;Avvenire&quot; shows just the contrary view: &quot;Terzani is more Christian than a New Age guru&quot;. It is underlined there that his experiences as a student (&quot;shishya&quot;) in the ashram of Swami Dayananda in 2004 have not persuaded him to &quot;convert&quot; to Hinduism, and that he was generally sceptical about New Age (e.g. in &quot;Un altro giro di giostra&quot;, 2004). 

His books have been translated into many languages: German, French, Polish, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Turkish, Slovenian, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Hungarian, and Romanian and published in India (in English), Thailand (English), Brazil (Portuguese) and Argentina (Spanish).

The film &quot;The End Is My Beginning&quot; was based on the book of the same name, depicting his last days (summer 2004, when he succumbed to cancer), when he is narrating to his son Folco the adventures of his life, his travels, and his philosophical views on life and death.
The role of the ailing, retired Terzani, now living in the mountains of Tuscany dressed and groomed just like an Indian sadhu, is played by Swiss-German actor Bruno Ganz and that of his son by Italian actor Elio Germano. The film, an art-house German-Italian production, was not expected to be a blockbuster but received positive reviews in the European press. &quot;In this film [see below], your father has a Franciscan spirit in some ways... «I think it&#x27;s a wonderful compliment. I understood what the Franciscan spirit really is by working alongside Mother Teresa in Calcutta, caring for the dying».

<text>Brian Dooley (born 16 April 1971) is an English television writer.

He is best known for creating the sitcom &quot;The Smoking Room&quot;, which debuted on BBC Three in 2004, before it was transferred to BBC Two, and for which he received a BAFTA in 2005. He also appears in the series as Ben from the post room.

==Education==
Dooley was educated at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge University.

==Career==
In 2007, Dooley contributed to the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; short story collection &quot;Short Trips: Snapshots&quot;. It was announced in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; issue 406 that he would write two episodes of series 3 of the Doctor Who spin-off &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, but his script, which formed the basis of &quot;Mona Lisa&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, was rewritten to the extent that only Phil Ford was credited.

<doc id="1042523" wikidata="Q683903" url="?curid=1042523" title="Christoph von Graffenried, 1st Baron of Bernberg">
<text>Christoph von Graffenried, 1st Baron of Bernberg (15 November 1661 – 27 October 1743) was a Swiss nobleman and explorer who was one of the founders of New Bern, North Carolina. Born in Worb Castle in the Canton of Bern, he played a major role in the colonisation of North America by German and Swiss settlers. In , von Graffenried published a memoir entitled &quot;Relation of My American Project&quot;, which recounted his life in both Switzerland and North America. 

==Early life==
Christoph von Graffenried was born on 15 November 1661 in Worb Castle in the Swiss canton of Bern. He was the son of Anton von Graffenried and Catherine Jenner. His father was lord of Worb and a minor government official. Von Graffenried studied at both Heidelberg University and Leiden University before visiting England . While in England, he came to know John Colleton and other Lords Proprietors of Carolina. In 1683, he returned home and on 25 April 1684 he married Regina Tscharner, with whom he had thirteen children.

==New Bern colony==
As his family grew, Von Graffenried found that his salary as a local government official and income from his estate were insufficient to cover expenses and growing debts. Around 1708, he became acquainted with the explorer-adventurer Franz Ludwig Michel who persuaded him to join an initiative to mine American silver deposits and establish a colony of Swiss refugees who were either poor or religiously persecuted. In 1709, Von Graffenried met with his former contacts in England and the Lords Proprietors of Carolina granted the Swiss venture 19,000 acres along the Neuse and Trent rivers in Carolina, including 5,000 acres purchased by Von Graffenried himself. As a significant landowner, Von Graffenried was named a &quot;Landgrave of Carolina&quot; and was later granted the provincial title, &quot;Baron of Bernburg.&quot; In addition, Queen Anne provided £4,000 to pay for the transportation of 100 German Palatine families that had fled to England to escape the War of the Spanish Succession.

In January 1710, Von Graffenried sent 650 Palatine settlers to Carolina under the leadership of John Lawson, the provincial surveyor general. Lawson had recently returned from Carolina in order to publish his book, &quot;A Voyage to Carolina&quot;. Lawson was knowledgeable of the country and promised to guide the settlers to the best sites for their communities. Their voyage was hindered by a series of winter storms and it was thirteen weeks before they landed in Virginia and then proceeded overland to Carolina. Hardship and disease took a heavy toll on the group and half of the original 650 colonists died before reaching their destination.

In July, Von Graffenried sailed with a contingent of about 150 Swiss colonists. Their crossing was relatively uneventful and after landing at Hampton, Virginia, in September, he joined Michel and Lawson in the Neuse-Trent area. He quickly laid out a town at the fork of the Trent and Neuse Rivers and christened it New Bern. When a local tribe complained that the land belonged to them, Graffenried negotiated a settlement and purchased the site of the new town from the tribe. The craftsmen in the group were assigned to the town while the farmers were given 250-acre plots in the outlying areas up the Trent River.

Despite a quick start to their settlement, the colonists were in desperate need of food and other supplies. The deputy governor of North Carolina was supposed to provide funds to purchase what was needed but a religious and political dispute between factions in the Carolina government meant that no money was forthcoming. Von Graffenried appealed unsuccessfully to the lords proprietors, other investors, and the colonial legislature for support. In the summer of 1711, an outbreak of yellow fever hit the colony and several settlers died, including two Swiss servants in Von Graffenried&#x27;s household.
Meanwhile, relations between colonists and Native Americans in the region continued to deteriorate. The Natives resented the steady encroachment of Europeans on their territory and felt abused in their trading deals with the settlers. Perhaps their greatest grievance was the native slave trade that flourished in the frontier regions—Native children in particular were kidnapped and sold into slavery by white slave traders. Von Graffenried&#x27;s new colony was not a specific target of this resentment and in later years, Von Graffenried would insist that he treated the Indians justly.

Von Graffenried was apparently unaware of how seriously relations with the Tuscarora had deteriorated. In September 1711, he and John Lawson began an exploratory journey up the Neuse. They hoped the river might provide a route for trade with Virginia. The trip was planned to last about two weeks and they brought along two Black slaves and two Native guides. The route took the group through the heart of Tuscarora territory. The Natives captured Von Graffenried, Lawson, and their Black slaves and subjected Von Graffenried and Lawson to a lengthy series of trials. Eventually, it was decided they were both guilty of crimes against the Tuscarora people and should be killed. Von Graffenried defended himself, saying that he had no part in any quarrels with the Natives and that he was under the protection of the Queen of England who would surely avenge his death. Ultimately, the Tuscarora spared Von Graffenried but killed Lawson. The manner of his death is unknown.

In negotiations with Native tribes on Virginia&#x27;s border, Lieutenant Governor Alexander Spotswood of Virginia interceded on behalf of Von Graffenried and demanded his release. Von Graffenried was freed after six weeks of captivity. When he finally reached New Bern, he found it abandoned and in flames. On September 22, 1711, while Graffenried was held captive, the Tuscarora and their allies had attacked white settlers in the region. The conflict became known as the Tuscarora War. Sixty Swiss and Palatines in New Bern and the surrounding area were killed and fifteen taken captive. The survivors fled New Bern and sought shelter at a fort built by plantation owner William Brice.

The colonists were surprised to see that Graffenried was still alive but they had lost confidence in his leadership and he never regained full authority. His refusal to seek revenge for the Native attacks was met with resentment. Some of the settlers followed him back to New Bern but others remained at the Brice plantation. A dispute over ownership of some blacksmith tools nearly led to open warfare between the factions. The disaffected colonists filed a protest with the colonial government and Graffenried was forced to appear before the assembly to defend his actions.

During the winter of 1711–1712, Graffenried and the remaining loyal settlers barricaded themselves in the town of New Bern and made plans to move their settlement to Virginia. When supplies ran low, Graffenried went to Albemarle County and obtained a shipload of corn, gunpowder and other provisions. Unfortunately, the ship caught fire on the voyage back to New Bern and the supplies were lost. In the spring of 1712, Graffenried traveled to Virginia to scout for a new settlement site around the falls of Potomac. Before leaving, he arranged with Franz Michel to transport any willing colonists to Virginia by ship.

In Virginia, the baron contracted French-Canadian explorer and adventurer, Martin Chartier, to serve as a guide. In addition to locating a suitable site for settlement, Graffenried was anxious to find a source of silver that was rumored to exist in the region. Chartier took him to Sugarloaf Mountain and then to the Shenandoah Valley, where they visited Massanutten Mountain, the supposed site of silver mines which the baron hoped would repair his fortune. However, they found no trace of silver.

When it became apparent that Michel would not be transporting any colonists (he later claimed his ship was not seaworthy), Graffenried decided to return to North Carolina. On his return, he stopped to confer with Governor Edward Hyde just as an epidemic of yellow fever was sweeping the province. The disease hit the governor&#x27;s household and Graffenried became ill but recovered, while the governor was not so fortunate and died.

Graffenried tried for a while longer to find some way of reviving his colonial venture but his investors had lost faith in him and creditors were threatening to have him arrested and thrown into debtors&#x27; prison. On Easter, 1713, he sailed for England, after mortgaging all the company landholdings to Thomas Pollock of Chowan County. He returned to Switzerland in 1714.

==Later life==

Late in 1714, Graffenried returned to Worb bankrupt and broken in spirit. It was several days before he could bring himself to face his father who had been critical of his efforts from the start. Perhaps in an effort to defend himself from critics, Graffenried soon wrote a manuscript entitled &quot;Relation of My American Project&quot;, detailing his exploits in America. He wrote at least three versions, one in German and two in French.

In 1731, Anton von Graffenried sold to his son Christoph the management of the estate which went with the office, reserving for himself the revenues of the office. The management of the estate was not very lucrative, but the father thought he had made a rather generous settlement for his spendthrift son. Later, when Anton became Mayor of Murton he wanted a representative in Iverton; and although Christoph did not relish the place, still to please his wife he ran for it and was elected. In 1730 at Anton&#x27;s death the estate of Worb came to Christoph without encumbrance, and he held it till 1740, when he retired in favor of his sons. Three years later, in 1743, Graffenried died and was buried in the choir of the Church at Worb.

His son, Christoph, emigrated to America and married Barbara Tempest Needham, of Hertfordshire, England. Their offspring founded the American branch of the family, which adopted the French version of the name, De Graffenried. The family became prominent in both Virginia and Tennessee.

<doc id="1042529" wikidata="Q4114781" url="?curid=1042529" title="Air launch">
<text>Air launching is the practice of releasing a rocket, missile, parasite aircraft or other aircraft payload from a mother ship or launch aircraft. The payload craft or missile is often tucked under the wing of the larger mother ship and then &quot;dropped&quot; while in flight. It may also be stored within a bomb bay, beneath the main fuselage or even on the back of the carrier aircraft, as in the case of the D-21 drone. Air launching provides several advantages over ground launching, giving the smaller craft an altitude and range boost, while saving it the weight of the fuel and equipment needed to take off on its own.

==History==

One of the earliest uses of air launching used an airship as a carrier and docking station for biplane parasite fighters. These planes would connect to their mothership through a trapeze-like rig, mounted to the top of the upper wing, that attached to a hook dangling from the bottom of the dirigible above. Fighters could be both launched and retrieved this way, giving the airship the speed and striking power of fixed-wing craft, while giving the fighters the range and lingering time of an airship. With advances in airplane technology, especially in range, the value of a dirigible mothership was reduced and the concept became obsolete.

The parasite fighter concept was later revived several times, in an attempt to solve the problem of how to protect bombers from fighter attack. The Convair B-36 was used to air launch several prototype fighters for defense, but none offered performance that could match ground-launched fighters. Even the largest bomber ever mass-produced was too small a mothership for the jet age. Docking also presented its own plethora of problems.

Air launch is the standard way to launch air-to-surface missiles and air-to-air missiles and is mainly used for rocket-powered craft, allowing them to conserve their fuel until lifted to altitude by a larger aircraft. The B-29, B-50, and B-52 have all served in the carrier role for research programs such as the Bell X-1 and X-15.

In the 1960s the SR-71 aircraft was used to launch the Lockheed D-21/M-21 drone to speeds of up to Mach 3. However, this added a degree of difficulty due to the shock wave pattern around an aircraft at supersonic speeds. After three successful tests, the fourth resulted in a collision with the carrier aircraft, in which both craft were destroyed and one crew member drowned. The project was subsequently abandoned.

During the development of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the 1970s, NASA used two modified Boeing 747 airliners, known as the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, to launch the Space Shuttle Enterprise, a crewed atmospheric test vehicle used to test the orbiter&#x27;s approach and landing capabilities. These aircraft were subsequently used throughout the Space Shuttle Program to transport the shuttles across long distances.

The Pegasus launch vehicle became the first air-launched orbital rocket when it was launched on April 5, 1990 by the private company Orbital Sciences Corporation (now a part of Northrop Grumman), from a NASA-owned B-52 Stratofortress. It has flown more than 40 times since, launched mostly from the company&#x27;s own Lockheed L-1011 known as Stargazer. Orbital Sciences was developing the Pegasus II launcher that would have dropped from the purpose-built Scaled Composites Stratolaunch. Pegasus&#x27;s capacity to low Earth orbit was projected to be 13,500 pounds (6,100 kg).

In the early 2000s, the B-52 was used to launch the X-43 hypersonic testbed aircraft. Recently, the air launch method has gained popularity with commercial launch providers. The Ansari X-Prize $10 million purse was won by a team led by Burt Rutan and Paul Allen for the successful launch of SpaceShipOne twice in a row in two weeks, which were the criteria.

In 2010, the SpaceShipTwo launch vehicle began launching. It was the successor the SpaceShipOne launch vehicle, which was retired in 2004. The first SpaceShipTwo aircraft, the VSS Enterprise flew 35 flights successfully from 2010 to 2014. However, on 31 October 2014, the vehicle was destroyed in-flight after an unintentional feathering. Michael Alsbury was killed and Peter Siebold was severely injured. In 2016, another ship, the VSS Unity conducted it&#x27;s maiden flight, which went smoothly. The VSS Unity conducted 20 test flights. The last one reached space, but without commercial crew onboard. On 11 July 2021, SpaceShipTwo launched 6 people to space. 2 were pilots and the rest tourists. Virgin Galactic repeatedly announced plans to refly the SpaceShipTwo. These plans have been delayed by more than a year and a half. It is currently expected to fly no earlier than the second quarter of 2023.

In 2021, Virgin Galactic announced plans for a SpaceShipThree. This would provide point-to-point transportation across the world. Two ships, the VSS Imagine and VSS Inspire are planned. In 2022, Virgin Galactic announced plans for the new Delta-class launch vehicle. This would be able to reach orbit. It is expected to launch in 2026.

<text>Shettleston (, ) is an area in the east end of Glasgow in Scotland.

==Toponymy==
The origin of the name &quot;Shettleston&quot; is not clear and, like many place-names of possibly medieval origin, has had a multitude of spellings. A papal bull of 1179 refers to &quot;villam filie Sedin&quot; – the residence of Sedin&#x27;s son or daughter. A Gaelic derivation suggests &quot;the daughter of Seadna&quot;.

==History==
Like several areas of Glasgow, Shettleston was originally a small village on its outer edge, lying within Lanarkshire. Today Shettleston - the heart of a local authority ward of the same name - lies between the neighbouring areas of Parkhead to the west, and Baillieston to the east, and is about from the city centre. Informally, it incorporates the neighbourhoods of Budhill, and Greenfield immediately to the north, although they fall within another Scottish Parliament constituency and Glasgow City Council ward; however, the Sandyhills neighbourhood to the south-east has the same administration as Shettleston in all respects. The area is well served by public transport, lying on the A89 road.

Shettleston railway station on the North Clyde line of the ScotRail local railway network provides a direct link to Glasgow Queen Street. It once was linked to Hamilton by the North British Railway, but this line has long since been closed.

In the late 1970s into the mid-1980s, Shettleston, like many other districts in the East End, benefited greatly from the Glasgow Eastern Area Renewal (GEAR) initiative, and much regeneration took place during this period. The area&#x27;s housing stock was substantially upgraded with tenements being sandblasted and internally refurbished, and coal fires were replaced with gas central heating. There was also support for small business with a new industrial estate on Annick Street in 1980. Landscaped areas were created on sites where derelict housing and industrial buildings that were beyond repair had been demolished. GEAR also saw several of Shettleston&#x27;s major public buildings replaced with new structures - a new police station in 1983, whilst several medical and dental practices were brought under one roof in a new medical centre in 1985. Early 1986 saw the opening of the long-awaited new building for Eastbank Academy.

In the early years of the 21st century, Shettleston was identified as the only place in the United Kingdom where life expectancy was falling. The reasons for the decline included poor diet and remarkably high smoking rates; neighbouring Easterhouse does not fare much better.

Shettleston was badly affected by the 2002 Glasgow floods.

==Education==

Shettleston contains three non-denominational schools; Eastbank Academy, founded in 1894 serves as the area&#x27;s main secondary school, and was rebuilt in the mid-1980s and then expanded in the early 2000s. Two of its feeder primary schools, namely Eastbank Primary School (originally part of Eastbank Academy, but became fully independent in 1968), and Wellshot Primary School - lie within its notional boundaries. St Paul&#x27;s RC Primary School is also located in the nearby Sandyhills area. The John Wheatley College originally existed in the area from 1989 to 2007 (in the former Eastbank Academy buildings), before it moved to its present site in Haghill.

Now defunct schools in the area include Shettleston Nursery on Old Shettleston Road, and St Mark&#x27;s (RC) Primary School.

==Churches==
Shettleston has a number of churches of all denominations, St Paul&#x27;s (RC), Shettleston Baptist Church, St Serf&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Shettleston Trinity Church, Shettleston New Church of Scotland (formerly Eastbank Parish Church), Romanian Orthodox Church in Shettleston Old Parish Church Halls, the Shettleston Old Church Halls was home to a number of community groups, including the 94th Glasgow (1st Shettleston) Company of the Boys&#x27; Brigade, founded in 1893. The church closed and parishioners were amalgamated with the Church of Scotland in Tollcross, due to building falling into disrepair in 2016 and as of 2017, is currently up for sale. In 2018 the 94th Glasgow Boys&#x27; Brigade moved base to Shettleston New Church near Aldi and Tesco on Old Shettleston Road/Annick Street. St Barnabas RC Church in Darleith St, Shettleston am sure is still an active Church.

<text>WNGC (106.1 FM) is a radio station in North Georgia that plays country music; it was at 95.5 from 1968-1999. It is owned by Cox Media Group and is part of Cox Radio. Its city of license is Arcade with studios in Athens. Its transmitter is in Lula, Georgia.

==Station history==
Prior to December 1996, 106.1 was light rock Mix 106 before switching to country and calling itself &quot;South 106&quot;. In the spring of 1999, WSTE built a new tower because at the time they were still in competition with WNGC---just before the two stations would merge. The purpose of the deal was to try to reach a larger audience and give the two Atlanta country stations WKHX &quot;Kicks&quot; 101.5, and WYAY (Y106 at 106.7) some competition.The studios had moved from Toccoa to Gainesville and finally to Athens, but its signal was hard to pick up in the Atlanta area beyond Gwinnett.

While WNGC&#x27;s city of license is Arcade, the transmitter is located in Lula (in northern Hall County). WNGC&#x27;s 106.1 signal can be heard in northeast metro Atlanta, Greenville, South Carolina, and as far as Asheville, North Carolina, but the main coverage area is northeast Georgia and the Athens metro area (where the studios are located). Attempts were made in 2001 to move the transmitter to Sugar Hill, but those plans were scrapped.In July 2005 WNGC added former Kicks 101.5 morning host Moby and his syndicated morning show.

In January 2008, it was announced that WNGC was sold (along with sister stations WGMG, WPUP, WRFC, and WGAU) to Cox Radio in Atlanta. On March 7, 2008, WNGC started running ads inviting former Eagle 106.7 listeners to switch to 106.1 WNGC, as WYAY had become an oldies station. In February 2009, WNGC became an affiliate of the Motor Racing Network (MRN) and the Performance Racing Network (PRN), and began carrying coverage of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series racing on weekends.

On June 29, 2015, WNGC began simulcasting on WTSH-FM, rebranding as &quot;106.1/107.1 Your Georgia Country&quot;.

On September 24, 2018, WNGC ended the simulcast with WTSH-FM, which switched to a simulcast of regional Mexican-formatted WLKQ 102.3 FM Buford.

<text>Allan Frederick Lawrence, (November 8, 1925 – September 6, 2008) was a Canadian politician and served as both a provincial and federal cabinet minister.

==Provincial politics==
After practicing as a lawyer, Lawrence became a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. His membership started when he won a 1958 provincial by-election in the downtown Toronto riding of St. George for the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario. In 1968, Premier John Robarts brought him into cabinet as Minister of Mines.

He ran to succeed Robarts as party leader at the 1971 leadership convention. Lawrence lost to Bill Davis by 44 votes on the fourth ballot. Davis reunited the party by inviting many of Lawrence&#x27;s key workers, including Hugh Segal and Norman K. Atkins, onto his team to create the Big Blue Machine that helped the party remain in power for a further 14 years.

Davis appointed Lawrence as his Attorney-General in 1971. In 1972, Lawrence resigned his seat in the Ontario legislature to enter federal politics.

===Cabinet positions===



==Federal politics==
Lawrence was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1972 federal election as the Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for the rural Ontario riding of Northumberland—Durham. He served as an MP throughout the decade.

When the party won the 1979 federal election, Prime Minister Joe Clark appointed Lawrence to the Cabinet as Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and Solicitor-General. The Clark government fell in a motion of no confidence after several months and was defeated in the 1980 election. Lawrence was re-elected in his riding and returned to the opposition benches.

He ran again in the 1984 election but, despite the Conservative victory that year, was passed over for a cabinet appointment by Brian Mulroney. Lawrence retired from politics at the 1988 election.

==Later life==
Lawrence retired to the small town of Cobourg, Ontario, with his wife, Moira. He died on September 6, 2008, at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. He was 82 years old.

<doc id="1042551" wikidata="Q821009" url="?curid=1042551" title="Berlaymont building">
<text>The Berlaymont building () is an office building in Brussels, Belgium, which houses the headquarters of the European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union (EU). The structure is located on the Robert Schuman Roundabout at 200, rue de la Loi/Wetstraat, in what is known as the &quot;European Quarter&quot;. The unique form of the Berlaymont&#x27;s architecture is used in the European Commission&#x27;s official emblem. The building is named after the .

==Usage==
The building has housed the European Commission since its construction, and has become a symbol of the European presence in Brussels and a metonym for the EU&#x27;s executive power. The Commission itself is spread over some 60-odd buildings, but the Berlaymont is the Commission&#x27;s headquarters, being the seat of the President of the European Commission and its College of Commissioners.

The following Directorates-General (departments) are also based in the Berlaymont: Human Resources and Security (HR), European Political Strategy Centre, formerly known as Bureau of European Policy Advisers (BEPA), Communication (COMM), Brussels Office of Infrastructure and Logistics (OIB), Secretariat-General (SG) and the Legal Service (SJ).

The office of the president, the Commission, and the boardroom, are on the 13th floor, together with the meeting room of the &quot;Hebdo&quot;, as well as the restaurant &quot;La Convivialité&quot;.

Ursula von der Leyen is the first Commission&#x27;s president to actually reside in the Berlaymont. She sleeps in a small private area next to her main office on the 13th floor.

==History==

===Background===
With the number of European civil servants rapidly growing since their arrival in Brussels in 1958, the European Commission required more and more office space across the city. By 1965, the Commission alone had 3,200 staff scattered across 8 different cramped buildings. The situation, which started as soon as they arrived due to the lack of large office blocks, became critical and the Commission tried to concentrate its staff in a number of rented buildings around the Robert Schuman Roundabout. The Belgian Government, becoming aware of the problem and keen to ensure that the Commission stayed, offered to build a prestigious administration complex large enough to house the entire staff. President Walter Hallstein was interested but cautious about making long-term commitments while the issue of where the institutions were based was still being discussed. However, the need for office space was overwhelming.

The Belgian Government&#x27;s proposal required sufficient land, which would preferably be in the Leopold Quarter (where they were already based) and near the homes of the civil servants to the south and east. The land chosen was then occupied by the , a 300-year-old convent that managed a girls&#x27; boarding school. The convent and school moved to a larger and quieter site out of the city centre in Waterloo. Once the Belgian State finished their new school and built infrastructure to it, the Ladies of Berlaymont handed over the site, which they had been under pressure to sell to developers for years, to the Belgian Government in November 1963.

To organise what was needed, the Belgian Foreign Minister Pierre Wigny suggested a &quot;Commission consultative Berlaymont&quot;, where the Commission, the Belgian Public Works Ministry, the contractors and the architects could draw up the plans. However, the Belgian State desired a building not just tailored to the Commission, but something that could be used by its own civil servants were the Commission to leave. This was also why they favoured a central office building rather than the project for the construction of a &quot;European city&quot; in Etterbeek. Due to the plans not meeting their exact desires, the Commission gained a lower rent.

===Construction===
Work was planned so that as soon as each wing was complete, staff could move in while the rest of the building was still under construction. The north and east wings were to be completed first (estimated for August 1961, though that proved optimistic). The south wing would take longer given the need to demolish more buildings including the girls&#x27; school, with the Ladies of Berlaymont unable to vacate until 1963. The Belgian Government, realising that budgetary constraints meant it could not meet any of the deadlines, resorted to outside funding from the &quot;Office de sécurité sociale d&#x27;Outre-mer&quot; (OSSOM). OSSOM would own the land but the building would be constructed and rented by the Belgian Government with rent deducted from its contribution to OSSOM&#x27;s budget. Eventually, it would buy it in 1985 through regular instalments, while it was being sublet to the Commission. OSSOM awarded the construction contract to an association of entrepreneurs, &quot;Enterprises François et Fils&quot; with &quot;Compagnie belge des Chemins de fer et d&#x27;entreprises&quot;, &quot;Compagnie industrielle de travaux&quot; and &quot;Armand Blaton&quot;. The lack of a public tender was criticised by the Belgian Audit Office.

In 1963, the first wing (north-east) entered its active phase and was scheduled to be finished by the end of 1965. Concreting on that wing was finished in November 1964. Completion was pushed back from the start of 1966 by a year due to the rail companies failing to vault the nearby railway line that prevented access to the ground floor. The wing was completed on 1 February 1967, with the first civil servants moving in three months later. The three-month gap was due to disagreements about the conditions of the lease. The Belgian State was to lease the whole building to the Commission starting from when the work was finished, but the other member states found the cost excessive and wanted to explore other options, gaining a lease for the one and only completed wing instead. The lease came into effect on 1 May 1967 and cost €545,366 (the whole building would be €4.82 million, a reduction of €2.48 million taking into account construction costs). The building was only fully occupied at the beginning of September of that year.

===Expansion===
However, from the start of the project, it was clear that the Commission would expand beyond the capacity of the Berlaymont. The Charlemagne building became available for the Commission. Furthermore, there was a building on the /, this would allow the Commission to concentrate itself in these buildings around the Schuman Roundabout and vacate the outer office complex. The cost of this deterred the Council from approving the plan, seeing the rent being driven too high.

The Commission also wanted to occupy the whole of the Berlaymont, which it shared with the Council and Parliament. The general public most associated the Commission with the Berlaymont and it was seen as a matter of pride that they occupy the entire building. Doing so would give them more room, and if they occupied it with the Joyeuse Entrée building, which they had before, they would have enough space, and the Charlemagne building could be occupied entirely by the Council. This would mean they could communicate well but not have to work in the same building. The Council eventually agreed but moved into a different building on the roundabout.

===Renovation===
Renovation of the building became the responsibility of the Belgian State when it bought the Berlaymont from OSSOM in 1985, but put off any work due to budgetary constraints. The Commission complained and Belgium offered to sell the building to them at a reduced rate (the rent was already half), but as the political question of a permanent seat had not been decided, the Commission was not in a position to buy. Renovation suddenly became an important issue when flaked asbestos was found in the building in 1990. The civil servants&#x27; trade unions put on the pressure and the issue was used as a pretext for a full renovation as the facilities had become outdated and were not able to cope with the influx of new member states.

Demolition was not an option as the foundations anchored the local road and metro networks, which would be put in danger if the Berlaymont were to be knocked down. However it was hard to establish a full renovation budget due to budgetary constraints of the Belgian Government. Hence, it was decided to bring in private sector financial institutions in the form of a management and renovation company: SA Berlaymont 2000 (in which the Belgian State remained a major shareholder). Berlaymont 2000 would pay €74.3 million to the Belgian State (also acting as a guarantor) and provide €160 million for the work, and in exchange it would gain a long lease on the building. Seeing it as a profitable investment, the following companies joined Berlaymont 2000: Citilease (affiliate of Citybank), CGER and BACOB. They began to provide finance and the Commission&#x27;s rent went up considerably to cover costs. The project was scheduled to start in 1994 and to take five years.

At the end of 1991, the Commissioners and their cabinets moved to the rapidly completed Breydel building and other departments moved out to buildings across the quarter and the wider capital: Auderghem, Evere and Etterbeek: in total, 11 buildings costing €14.8 million a year to the Belgian State in return the Commission kept paying the Berlaymont rent while it was vacated. However, the project began to face setbacks, which tarnished Belgium&#x27;s image, as it failed to decide working arrangements, and which put back preliminary studies until Berlaymont 2000 took over in 1996 and set up a team to carry out the necessary studies. The Commission then stalled, doubting that the proposed plans would sufficiently adapt the Berlaymont to its new needs. Eventually, the plans were adapted enough for the Commission not only to accept them and return to the Berlaymont but to pay the renovation costs, signing a long lease in 1997 with an option to purchase.

Work on removing the asbestos began in the summer of 1995, three and a half years after the building was vacated. Work was expected to finish in February 1997, but inefficient organisation led to delay after delay: rumours about air pollution and violation of standards, electricity failures and asbestos outside the screen brought work to a halt. Longer time frames and more capital were demanded to complete the work. Outside management was brought in with asbestos removal being completed in 1999. Renovation work started on 1 June 1999 with work on full modernisation of the building, including better natural light flows, and construction was expected to be finished by the end of 2001 according to optimistic forecasts. However, once more there were further delays from the subcontractors, Berlaymont 2000 and SNCB/NMBS, which was constructing a railway link below the building. The completion date was pushed back each year until it reached mid-2004.

Despite further considerable delays and legal battles, the building was handed over to the Commission in stages, starting from 1 July 2004, with civil servants moving back just before the start of the Barroso Commission, with their related cabinets and a total of 2,700 civil servants. In total, renovation took 13 years, five years longer than it took to build. The December 1998 handover date was delayed five times and the bill to the Belgian State for the poor planning and disagreements amounted, by some estimates, to €824 million.

===Fire===
On 18 May 2009, at approximately 11:00 GMT, the Berlaymont building was evacuated following a fire that started in the press room. There were no reported casualties. The building does not have a fire sprinkler system except in the garage.

==Architecture==
The building, under the provisional name &quot;Centre Administratif Europe&quot;, was designed by Lucien De Vestel, in association with Jean Gilson (Groupe Alpha), André and Jean Polak and with the recommendations of the engineer Joris Schmidt. It was directly inspired by the 1958 secretariat building of UNESCO in Paris (which was designed by Marcel Breuer, Pier Luigi Nervi and Bernard Zehrfuss). The technical design was ground-breaking at the time and generated an enthusiastic response from a Brussels journal: &quot;This design concept reflects both the 20th century innovative spirit and sheer audacity and brings to mind the astonishing civil engineering arrow at the 1958 exhibition.&quot;

The building has a cruciform design with four wings of unequal size spanning from a central core. It was built on piles located beneath each wing, supporting a narrow ridge of concrete, which in turn supported steel beams forming the frame of the glass façade covering the prefabricated floors. The top, 13th, floor however was supported directly by the upper beams, suspended entirely by them making the lower level free standing except for the core. The design is intended to convey a feeling of light and transparency. It includes decorative details such as sculptures and frescos to prevent it from becoming monotonous.

The complex was initially designed to house 3,000 civil servants and 1,600 cars in a four-level underground car park under the whole complex. Foundations run deep. The number of lower levels (which link to the road tunnels and metro) was due to the height restriction around the Cinquantenaire (so as not to spoil the view) It included 17 flexible conference rooms that could be used by the European Parliament and Council of Ministers. There were a further nine Commission meeting rooms on the upper floors. Free space outside was converted into public gardens and terraces.

Since renovation, the structure has not changed except for a press extension, but there have been a number of internal and landscape changes. Traffic flow has been improved, but underground parking has been reduced by 25% and surface parking has been almost entirely converted into a pedestrian mall that flows into the surrounding urban landscape. Security has been improved, and a lighting well provides natural light to the restaurant and multimedia centres. The helipad was replaced by a cupola that houses the Commission&#x27;s meeting room, looking out over the Schuman Roundabout. The building meets the strictest environmental standards, reusing light, power and heat throughout the building.

The façade was replaced with a curtain wall with mobile glass screens that adapt to weather conditions and reduce glare while still allowing light in. They also act as a sound barrier, reducing noise from the Rue de la Loi. The windows cut off the air conditioning when opened to prevent energy being wasted. Offices, which are now larger, can have their heating adjusted automatically or individually. The heating is turned off automatically when the room is unoccupied.

The building now has of floor space on 18 levels, connected by 42 lifts and 12 escalators. Offices for 3,000 officials and meeting rooms are in the tower. A restaurant, a 900-seat cafeteria, a TV studio, conference rooms, storage rooms, a Nordic sauna, car parking for over 1,100 vehicles and various services occupy the basement. Architects Pierre Lallemand, Steven Beckers and Wilfried Van Campenhout carried out the 1991–2004 renovation.

<doc id="1042563" wikidata="Q4380750" url="?curid=1042563" title="Bodø Main Air Station">
<text>Bodø Air Station is a military air base of the Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) located in the town of Bodø in Bodø Municipality, Nordland county, Norway. 

The base is home for a detachment of AgustaWestland AW101 search and rescue (SAR) helicopters of the 330 Squadron. 

The base was, until 2022, the home base for NATO&#x27;s Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) mission. The mission is now carried out by F-35s from Evenes Air Station. Bodø serves as the main air station for Northern Norway and shares its runway with Bodø Airport.

The first airfield was a simple wooden runway built in May 1940 by Allied forces during the Norwegian Campaign (8 April–10 June 1940) of World War II. The airfield was quickly bombed by the Luftwaffe, who chose to build a new airport in the same location. It remained in German use until 1945, when it was taken over by the RNoAF. Upgradation to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) standards started in 1950, and fighters have been stationed at Bodø since 1955. Aircraft previously stationed are the F-84 Thunderjet, the F-86 Sabre and the F-104 Starfighter. The air station will be closed with the delivery of the F-35 Lightning II, and only the SAR detachment will remain.

==History==

===World War II===
The first military aircraft to land in Bodø was a Hansa-Brandenburg aircraft of the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service which landed in July 1922. From the mid-1930s, regular seaplane flights were started from Bodø to Southern Norway. Two military Tiger Moth aircraft were sent from Trøndelag to scout the Bodø area for a possible site to land aircraft, and landed at Rønvikjordene. From 1935 additional aircraft missions were carried out to the area. In 1939 a plan for establishing airports in Nordland was made, which included a main air station at Bardufoss and five other smaller airport, including Rønvik. At the time of the break-out of World War II in Norway in April 1940, construction had yet to start. At the time both Germany and the United Kingdom believed that there was an airport in Bodø.

During the Norwegian Campaign the German troops were isolated in Narvik and the Allies decided to build an airport in the yet unoccupied Bodø area to allow air raids against German troops in a flanking maneuver in combination with Bardufoss Air Station. A airstrip made of peat and nets was built at Hernes in the course of twelve days in May. During construction German aircraft practice landing on the strip, flying just above. A detachment of the Royal Air Force&#x27;s 263 Squadron with sixteen Gloster Gladiator aircraft was stationed at Bodø from 21 May and 46 Squadron with eight Hawker Hurricane. The aircraft were used for raids on German aircraft in Saltdalen and evacuate Allied soldiers in Rognan on 26 May. The following day, ten German Junkers Ju 87, escorted by four Messerschmitt Bf 110, bombed the airport. In the evening the Luftwaffe bombed not only the rest of the airport, but also the town.

German forces captured Bodø on 1 June and immediately started preparing for a new airstrip. By August a runway was finished and the work was completed by April 1941 with a runway, in addition to various buildings. The need for the airport was both to counteract Allied raids and to allow reinforcements for a planned attack on the Soviet Union. At first fighters and reconnaissance aircraft were stationed at Bodø, but later also bombers. From January to April 1942 the Luftwaffe dispatched the 7th Squadron of the Jagdgeschwader 5 to Bodø, consisting of fifteen Messerschmitt Bf 109.

New squadrons, largely of Ju 87s, were stationed in Bodø. However, there were no Allied raids, so the aircraft were sent to the Murmansk Front. Throughout the war the Wehrmacht built &quot;Festung Bodø&quot;, consisting of army, navy and air force installations, including starting work on a concrete runway to replace the wooden runway. From the fall of 1944, Bodø again received an increasing number of aircraft, as Germany moved their fleet northwards following Finnish capitulation. Up to forty fighters plus other aircraft were stationed at the airport. When Germany capitulated on 8 May 1945 there were thirty aircraft at the airport.

===Reestablishment===

Upon the German capitulation, the airport was taken over by the Norwegian Armed Forces. At first the airport was manned by Germans, but operations were quickly taken over by Norwegians. All but a few Fiesler Storch aircraft were destroyed by the RAF. The Air Force decided to keep the airport operational and stationed thirty men for its operation. It was mostly used as a layover for aircraft flying between Bardufoss and Værnes Air Station. During this period, the airport consisted of an officers&#x27; mess, two barracks, three hangars, a fire station, an air traffic control building and some smaller buildings. Some of the wood was used for reconstruction, and by 1948 the runway was .

After the war, there was military agreement that Bardufoss should be the main air station for Northern Norway, and Bodø would not station any aircraft. The Air Force saw the strategic advantage of a second air station in Northern Norway, although it was at first the civilian needs for an airport that were most interested in an upgrade of Bodø. By 1949, internal notes within the Air Force were discussing the possibilities of moving the command center for the Air Force in Northern Norway to Bodø. During 1948, following incidents such as the Czechoslovak coup d&#x27;état of 1948, the Berlin Blockade and increased Soviet pressure on Finland, the Norwegian government increased military spending, and Norway became a founding member of NATO the following year.

Norway thus shifted its military strategy towards holding the country until allied forces could be dispatched. Northern Norway became a central part of this strategy because of NATO&#x27;s north flank in the Norway–Soviet Union border, and Norway planned to have two fighter squadrons and one reconnaissance squadron in the north. The Ministry of Defense awarded NOK 3.7 million in 1950 to expand Bodø&#x27;s runway to , with construction starting in October. The rest of the air station was designed through a main plan which was completed on 30 July 1951. The civilian sector was placed north of the runway, on the town side, while the military sector was placed south.
The military expropriated the entire peninsula south of the runway. The location of the airport was at the time controversial, mostly because of expropriation of agricultural land. Alternative locations were considered such as at Straumøya and Fauskemyrene, but Bodø was preferred by civilian authorities because of its proximity to the town. Later, two other major concerns, which were not evident at the time, would arise. First, the air station&#x27;s occupation of the central location meant that Bodø would spread out west-east, giving a less compact cityscape. Second, introduction of new aircraft would create significant noise pollution.

Funding was increased further from 1951, as it was considered as an advance on common alliance infrastructure, resulting in a further NOK 5.5 million for Bodø. The following year the government decided to acquire the F-84 Thunderjet, which required a longer runway than was being installed. Civilian traffic commenced on 12 May 1952. The first detachment of aircraft were stationed during the exercise Main Brace from 13 to 25 September, before the base was completed. Parliament decided in 1952 that Bodø would become the main air station for Northern Norway and that Air Force Command for Northern Norway would move from Bardufoss on 1 July 1953. The first aircraft to be stationed at Bodø was a Bell 47 in May 1954, and two new de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otters from July. Bodø was found ready to host squadrons in 1955, and was allocated the 331 and 334 Squadrons of F-84Gs previously based at Sola Air Station. The 334 moved to Bodø in mid July, while 331 moved in late August. A ground-controlled approach system was installed at Bodø in 1955.

Parallel to the construction of the air station, air defense batteries were built at nine locations, including batteries at Skipsholmen, Geitvågen, Landbruksskolen, Hernesskagen and Bestemorsenga. Several of these were upgrades of existing German installations. The air defense was completed in 1953. It became part of the Air Force in 1958, and L70 batteries were installed. Construction of a base in Bodin Municipality was completed in July 1954, which was used for training. From 1959, a troop of M24 Chaffee tanks were stationed at Bodin to strengthen the air defense. Housing for enlisted crew and their families was secured through prefabricated fourplexes which were built in town. Later, additional housing was constructed, in part through housing cooperatives. A network of radar stations was built throughout Northern Norway in the late 1950s. These were from 1956 headquartered at Hernes, which included one of two command and reporting centers for the region.

===Cold War===
The F-84s were replaced by the F-86 Sabre in mid and late 1958. During two periods in 1958 and 1959 the runway was extended further, and the aircraft were for these periods stationed at Bardufoss and Andøya Air Station. A support wing was transferred from Skattøra in 1959 and consisted of two Bell 47, two Sikorsky H-19 and five Otters. From 20 August 1960, the 334 Squadron replaced its F-86F with F-86K, which included radar and were thus better suited for reconnaissance. As there was need for additional fighters in Bodø, the 339 Squadron of F-86Ks was transferred from Gardermoen Air Station in September. With these realignments, the air station was rebuilt and expanded to handle more aircraft.

In case a war broke out between NATO and the Soviet Union, the fighter aircraft stationed in Bodø were to support NATO&#x27;s Atomic Strike Plan, which would see US Strategic Air Command (SAC) bomber aircraft drop nuclear warheads over the base of the Soviet Northern Fleet. Norwegian fighter pilots trained on techniques for dropping nuclear bombs, but the battle plans called for them to be used for reconnaissance and precision bombing of radar and communications targets with conventional bombs. With the introduction of intercontinental ballistic missiles, SAC&#x27;s interest for Bodø dwindled from 1959.

Norway agreed in 1955 that both US and UK reconnaissance flights could operate out of Bodø and other northern airports, given they not violate Soviet air space. American U-2 aircraft, used for high-altitude reconnaissance over Soviet territory, were first operated out of Bodø in 1958. The U-2 shoot-down on 1 May 1960, where the aircraft was heading for Bodø, had a severe negative impact on Norway&#x27;s relations both with the Soviet Union and the United States. In the aftermath, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev threatened to bomb Bodø Main Air Station as he regarded it as a strategic target. This was the first Soviet threat of targeting Norway with nuclear weapons.

SAC was given thirty days to withdraw its communications personnel from Bodø and prohibited allies from using Norwegian airports for flights in international airspace east of the 24th meridian east. Minister of Defense Gudmund Harlem withdrew on 18 February 1961, largely because of his lack of control over Colonel Vilhelm Evang at Bodø and his liberal permissions to US reconnaissance missions. Evang on his side had given permission largely because of misleading information from the Central Intelligence Agency regarding the nature of their missions.

The 332 Squadron switched to F-86K in 1962 and relocated a substantial portion of the Bodø aircraft. Squadrons 334 and 339 were merged in April 1963, with 334 responsible for operations and 339 for the technical aspects. 339 was closed later in 1963. On 7 August, the first thirteen F-104 Starfighters were delivered to Bodø. The increased noise, especially from use of afterburners during take-off, resulted in significantly more noise pollution in town and became a major concern among the residents. As the Sabres were used for interception, the Starfighters were at first used as fighter-bombers.
Bodø received a split strategic role during the 1960s. From Norway&#x27;s point of view it was largely used to control the air space and intercept Soviet aircraft in Norway air space. Because of the Sabres&#x27; limited range, they were often deployed at Banak Air Station. For NATO, Bodø was largely a site for exercises and reinforcements in case of war. The 719 Squadron was created on 1 January 1966 and consisted of the four helicopters and five Otters which had previously been designated as the 7193 Support Wing. The newly created squadron received its first Bell UH-1 helicopter in late 1966 and the first de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter in mid 1967. The Sabres were replaced by the F-5 Freedom Fighters from 1967. This involved a swap of roles, whereby the Starfighters took on the role as interception aircraft, and the Freedom Fighters, which lacked radar and advanced navigation equipment, took on the role as fighter-bombers.

The central command for Northern Norway was unified at Bodin from 1967, and moved into a new operations&#x27; center at Reita outside Bodø in 1971. International exercises and squadron exchanges became increasingly common throughout the late 1960s, with annual exercises in Bodø. A nearly annual visitor was the Royal Netherlands Air Force 314 Squadron as part of Allied Command Europe Mobile Force to protect NATO&#x27;s northern flank. Most exercises were carried out during the fall and winter and was important for the air station to practice reception of allied reinforcements and flexible use of area. These included the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic-organized land and amphibian Team-Work every fourth years from 1964, the annual Express under the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Northern Wedding every fourth year from 1970, and Ocean Safari every other year from 1975.

The Ministry of Justice started the process of establishing a search and rescue service in the late 1960s. The plans to order ten Westland Sea Kings were passed by Parliament in 1970. The 330 Squadron was recreated on 25 April 1973 and based at Bodø. Three detachments were created, at Sola, Ørland and Banak. This allowed any part of the coast to be reached within ninety minutes. From the 1970s, NATO became increasingly concerned about protecting grounded aircraft for nuclear warfare and sixteen underground hangars were built between 1973 and 1975.

In an effort to rationalize operations and renew the fighter inventory, Norway took delivery of twenty-two used CF-104 Starfighters from the Royal Canadian Air Force. These were stationed with the 334 Squadron in order to exploit commonality with the F-104s already stationed in Bodø. Unlike the F-104, the CF-104 was built as a fighter-bomber, but radar was retrofitting before entering Norwegian service. The aircraft&#x27;s primary role was naval bombardment. During larger exercises, the 334 Squadron would routinely relocate to Bardufoss. Bodø became one of nine co-located operating bases (COB), following an agreement between the Norwegian Armed Forces and the USAF in May 1974. This involved permanent storage of ammunition, parts and equipment, as well as a tighter organizational cooperation, with the USAF.

The Soviet Union built a steadily increasing military presence on the Kola Peninsula during the 1970s, leading to both a Norwegian and a NATO interest in strengthening Bodø. Soviet aircraft would routinely operate westward in international airspace in the Barents Sea and Norwegian Sea. The fighters at Bodø were therefore frequently scrambled to reconnaissance and intercept such aircraft, and were occasionally the first NATO aircraft to photograph new Soviet aircraft. Norway did not allow allied aircraft to carry out identification missions.
Norway chose to purchase the F-16 Fighting Falcon in 1975, with two of the four squadrons to be stationed in Bodø. The first F-16 was delivered to Bodø in February 1982 and the last CF-104 was retired on 22 April 1983. Bodø experienced an acute lack of pilots during the early in 1980s, and in 1984 there were more fighters than pilots. This was balanced with a lack of technicians. The deployment as COB was completed in 1985. The air force had originally planned during the 1970s to upgrade to the Roland II air defense system, but chose to install six I-Hawk batteries between 1985 1987. During the 1980s, both U-2 and SR-71 Blackbirds used Bodø as a reserve airport.

===Later history===
With an increasing allied presence on the northern flank, Bodø was set for a large NATO-financed upgrade starting in late 1989. Costing NOK 670 million, it included new underground hangars, new taxiways, an extension of the parallel taxiway to , a apron, a new parallel taxiway north of the runway, and filling in of sea west of the airfield. The upgrades also included 43 underground hangars and a new fire station. The upgrades were completed in 1993 and were largely funded by NATO.

From 1990, the 719 Squadron replaced its helicopters with Bell 412. However, these were later moved to the 330 Squadron, with the 719 becoming a pure Twin Otter operator. Passenger transport was reorganized from 25 October 1992, whereby the military&#x27;s charter flights were terminated and the military instead bought tickets with scheduled flights. As part of this reorganization, the military air terminal was closed and the service moved to the civilian terminal. In 1996 and 1997, the Hawk system was replaced with the Norwegian Adapted Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS).

Following the 2008 decision to purchase the F-35 Lightning II, the Norwegian Armed Forces carried out an analysis of its air base structure. The military wanted to reduce the number of bases for the F-35 to one, with Bardufoss, Bodø, Evenes and Ørland being the prime candidates. Ørland, with an advanced base at Evenes, was selected because of its location centrally in Norway and its existing squadron of F-16s. The increased noise levels of the F-35 became a major concern during the evaluation of Bodø, as the air station&#x27;s proximity to the town would create even higher levels of noise pollution. This would have required the runway to be moved southwestwards, incurring high costs. At the same time, Bodø lacked proper training areas and would give less flexibility in a forty-year perspective. This will cause Bodø Main Air Station to be closed, although the 330 Squadron detachment will remain.

The base were home to the F-16 Fighting Falcons of the 331 and 332 Squadrons before F-16 were phased out of the RNoAF. The squadrons were moved to Ørland Main Air Station in 2023, with F-35s.

==Operations==
The 330 Squadron has a detachment with AgustaWestland AW101 &quot;SAR Queen&quot; helicopters at Bodø. The detachment flew 367 missions and 840 hours in 2009. The &quot;SAR Queens&quot; primary role is for search and rescue (SAR) mission, with a portfolio northwards to central Troms and southward throughout Nordland. In SAR missions, the squadron operates under the management of the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Northern Norway located in downtown Bodø. The detachment&#x27;s secondary responsibility is as an air ambulance, in which it is under management of Nordland Hospital Trust.

==Civilian sector==
The Norwegian Aviation Museum is located on the premises of Bodø Airport. Bodø is also home to the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway and Bodø Air Traffic Control Center.

<text>HMCS &quot;Chicoutimi is a [[Upholder/Victoria-class submarine|&quot;Victoria&quot;-class]] long-range hunter-killer (SSK) [[submarine]] of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], originally built and operated by the [[Royal Navy]] asHMS &quot;Upholder. Shortly after being handed over by the United Kingdom to Canada she was involved in a partial flooding incident which resulted in a fire at sea. The incident sparked a fierce debate over the value of the purchase of this group of second-hand vessels, as well as the handover inspection process. The subsequent investigation &quot;determined the fire was caused by human, technical and operational factors, [and] the board cleared the commanding officer and crew of any blame.&quot; The submarine was repaired and entered Canadian service in 2015.

==Design and description==
As built the &quot;Upholder&quot;/&quot;Victoria&quot; class was designed as a replacement for the for use as hunter-killer and training subs. The submarines, which have a single-skinned, teardrop-shaped hull, displace surfaced and submerged. They are long overall with a beam of and a draught of .

The submarines are powered by a one shaft diesel-electric system. They are equipped with two Paxman Valenta 1600 RPS SZ diesel engines each driving a GEC electric alternator with two 120-cell chloride batteries. The batteries have a 90-hour endurance at . The ship is propelled by a GEC dual armature electric motor turning a seven-blade fixed pitch propeller. They have a diesel capacity. This gives the subs a maximum speed of on the surface and submerged. They have a range of at and at snorting depth. The class has a reported dive depth of over .

The &quot;Upholder&quot;/&quot;Victoria&quot; class are armed with six torpedo tubes. In British service, the submarines were equipped with 14 Tigerfish Mk 24 Mod 2 torpedoes and four UGM-84 Sub-Harpoon missiles. They could also be adapted for use as a minelayer. The submarines have Type 1007 radar and Type 2040, Type 2019, Type 2007 and Type 2046 sonar installed. The hull is fitted with elastomeric acoustic tiles to reduce acoustic signature. In British service the vessels had a complement of 7 officers and 40 ratings.

===Refits and Canadian alterations===
During the refit for Canadian service, the Sub-Harpoon and mine capabilities were removed and the submarines were equipped with the Lockheed Martin Librascope Submarine fire-control system (SFCS) to meet the operational requirements of the Canadian Navy. Components from the fire control system of the &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines were installed. This gave the submarines the ability to fire the Gould Mk 48 Mod 4 torpedo. In 2014, the Government of Canada purchased 12 upgrade kits that will allow the submarines to fire the Mk 48 Mod 7AT torpedoes.

These radar and sonar systems were later upgraded with the installation of the BAE Type 2007 array and the Type 2046 towed array. The Canadian Towed Array Sonar (CANTASS) has been integrated into the towed sonar suite. The &quot;Upholder&quot;-class submarines were equipped with the CK035 electro-optical search periscope and the CH085 optronic attack periscope, originally supplied by Pilkington Optronics. After the Canadian refit, the submarines were equipped with Canadian communication equipment and electronic support measures (ESM). This included two SSE decoy launchers and the AR 900 ESM.

==Construction and career==
The submarine was built for the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Upholder&quot; (S40), the lead ship of the &quot;Upholder&quot; (2400) class of submarines, the second vessel to bear the name in the Royal Navy. The submarine was laid down by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd (VSEL) in February 1983 and launched on 2 December 1986. During construction, work on the submarine was delayed due to a labour strike. &quot;Upholder&quot; commissioned into the Royal Navy on 7 December 1990. Her commissioning was delayed due to a problem with the operation of the torpedo tubes, which had to be welded closed to prevent sea water entering the submarine.

&quot;Upholder&quot; was decommissioned on 29 April 1994 as a financial measure, following the end of the Cold-War and subsequent cancellation of the programme and amidst some controversy. The entire class was declared surplus to requirements in 1994.

===Royal Canadian Navy===
The British government was looking to discontinue the operation of diesel-electric boats and offered to sell &quot;Upholder&quot; and her sister submarines to Canada in 1993. The offer was accepted in 1998. The four boats were leased to Canada for US$427 million (plus US$98 million for upgrades and alteration to Canadian standards), with the lease to run for eight years; after this, the submarines would be sold for £1.

Problems were discovered with the piping welds on all four submarines, which delayed the reactivation of &quot;Upholder&quot; and her three sisters. &quot;Upholder&quot; was the last to be restored. When work commenced on the submarine, internal steelwork was found to be corroded, hull valves were cracked, air turbine pumps were defective, and equipment was missing that had been used to refit sister boat (ex-&quot;Ursula&quot;).

&quot;Upholder&quot; was renamed HMCS &quot;Chicoutimi&quot;, in honour of the city of Chicoutimi, Quebec (now a borough of the city of Saguenay).

====October 2004 fire====

&quot;Chicoutimi&quot; was the last of the newly renamed &quot;Victoria&quot;-class vessels to complete the refit and was handed over to Maritime Command on 2 October 2004 at Faslane Naval Base. Two days later, &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; set sail for her new home port at CFB Halifax in Nova Scotia.

On 5 October, &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; was running on the surface, through heavy seas north-west of County Mayo, Ireland. Both hatches in the bridge fin lock-out chamber were left open and an estimated of seawater entered the vessel. The seawater caused an electrical panel to short out, which in turn started a major fire and caused all power to cut out, leaving the submarine adrift. Nine crewmembers were affected by smoke inhalation and the submarine was left drifting without power in heavy seas.

The RNLI lifeboat &quot;Sam and Ada Moody&quot;, stationed on Achill Island, County Mayo was put on standby to assist, but was later stood down. An Irish Navy ship, , responded to the submarine&#x27;s mayday signal and set out to assist it, but was seriously damaged by the rough seas and forced to return to harbour. The only other Irish Navy ships available to help, and were patrolling off Ireland&#x27;s southern coast. At 2 p.m. local time, the Royal Navy frigate and the auxiliary vessel reached the crippled &quot;Chicoutimi&quot;, with an additional three British ships en route. LÉ &quot;Aoife&quot; later reached the area and took over coordination of the rescue and salvage efforts. Other British ships dispatched to assist the submarine were and , as well as a number of specialist vessels to handle the situation. The rough conditions in the North Atlantic were impeding efforts to rescue the surfaced &quot;Chicoutimi&quot;, and a former Canadian naval officer said of &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; that &quot;[it&#x27;s] not [a] good surface rider at all. It&#x27;s by no means unsafe; it&#x27;s just very uncomfortable.&quot;

Three of the crew were airlifted by a Royal Navy helicopter for medical treatment after their condition deteriorated. Its original destination was Londonderry/Derry, Northern Ireland, but the helicopter diverted to Sligo, Ireland after one crewman, Lieutenant (Navy) Chris Saunders, 32, became severely ill. The three crewmen were taken to Sligo General Hospital, where Saunders was pronounced dead. The other two were admitted to the hospital, where one was listed in &quot;critical&quot; condition and placed in the intensive care unit, while another was reported as being in a &quot;stable&quot; condition.

By the evening of 7 October, the weather had abated, and &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; was taken in tow by the HM Coastguard tugboat &quot;Anglian Prince&quot; to return to Faslane Naval Base in Scotland. The tow was later taken over by the United States Submarine Support Vessel , which was able to increase the towing speed from to , and reached Faslane on the evening of 10 October. &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; was escorted into the Royal Navy base by , a Canadian frigate which rushed across the Atlantic after the navy learned of the fire.

Following claims made in the Canadian media about the cause of the fire, blaming the United Kingdom for supplying an unsafe vessel, the situation was further exacerbated by controversial comments made by the UK&#x27;s Secretary of State for Defence, Geoff Hoon. Hoon accompanied his condolences for Saunders with a proposal that the Royal Navy would charge Canada for the cost of the rescue while also stating that Canada as the buyer had to beware. In Canada, many Second World War veterans were outraged by his comments. As well as promoting speculation regarding problems with the &quot;Victoria&quot; class, the incident also sparked debate in Ireland over the country&#x27;s lack of a rescue tug at that time.
After some repairs were made at Faslane, the Department of National Defence contracted Eide Marine Services to transport &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; aboard the submersible heavy lift ship &quot;Eide Transporter&quot; to Halifax. She departed Faslane on 13 January 2005 and arrived in Halifax on 1 February, where she was dry docked at HMC Dockyard for further work.

A year after the incident, a Canadian board of inquiry found that &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; was traveling on the surface with two hatches open so that crewmembers could repair an air vent on the submarine&#x27;s conning tower, an issue that had not been addressed during the British refit of the vessel. An unexpected rogue wave arrived during this time and sent water down the open hatches. This partially flooded two compartments and created a short circuit in electrical connectors that the British had only applied one layer of waterproof sealant to, rather than the recommended three. The board of inquiry concluded that &quot;a combination of human, technical and operational factors ... led to a tragic death&quot;, in the words of the-then Chief of the Maritime Staff Bruce MacLean, and that &quot;Chicoutimi&quot;″s captain Luc Pelletier was not at fault. Sailors who fought the fire aboard the submarine suffered higher levels of post-traumatic stress syndrome and asthma in the years following the incident.

====2009 transfer to Victoria====
In April 2006 the Department of National Defence announced that repairs to &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; would be deferred until 2010 when the submarine was to undergo a previously scheduled two-year Extended Docking Work Period (refit).

From 2006 to 2008 the Department of Public Works and Government Services worked with the Department of National Defence (DND) to issue a Request for Proposal for the Victoria Class In-Service Support Contract Project (VISSC). The result of this RFP saw the VISSC awarded in June 2008 to the Canadian Submarine Maintenance Group (CSMG), a private-sector consortium led by Babcock Marine and Weir Canada Inc. The initial five-year contract for the VISSC will see CSMG establish a submarine maintenance and repair facility at DND&#x27;s graving dock at CFB Esquimalt near Victoria, British Columbia. The DND graving dock is operated by Washington Marine Group as Victoria Shipyards Inc.

Under the terms of the VISSC, CSMG contracted Dockwise USA Inc to transport &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; from Halifax to Esquimalt. On 1 April 2009 &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; was loaded aboard the submersible heavy lift ship &quot;Tern&quot; in Bedford Basin. &quot;Tern&quot; departed Halifax on 5 April 2009 and arrived in Esquimalt on 29 April 2009 where &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; was transferred to the CSMG facility.

In January 2014 it was announced that &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; was repaired and was being prepared to be handed back over to the navy. However, the boat would be limited to shallow-water diving for the foreseeable future. It was announced on 28 September 2014 that the submarine began sea trials that would take seven-to-eight weeks to complete. On 7 December 2014 the Ottawa Citizen reported that HMCS &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; had completed her sea trials and was handed over to the Royal Canadian Navy on 3 December 2014. The boat was officially commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 3 September 2015.

====Operational service====
In October 2015, &quot;Chicoutimi&quot;, along with and , participated in the United States Navy&#x27;s Task Group Exercise, a naval exercise held off southern California. In 2015, problems with welds were discovered aboard &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; and sister boat &quot;Victoria&quot;. Both submarines were docked to undergo repairs and &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; began training exercises in December 2016.

In May 2017, &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; returned to port after problems arose with the main battery while conducting operations at sea. On 15 June 2017, while &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; was docked at CFB Esquimalt, the &quot;Cougar&quot; struck the submarine as it was exiting the dockyard. The initial inspection following the collision showed only superficial damage to the protective gear around the submarine. To deal with the ongoing battery issues aboard &quot;Chicoutimi&quot;, the main battery was transferred from sister boat &quot;Victoria&quot;. On 7 October 2017, CBC News reported that &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; had been sent on a first-ever operational patrol to Asia. &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; made a port visit to Yokosuka, Japan while deployed to Asia, marking the first time in 50 years a Canadian submarine has visited the country. The submarine was deployed off the coast of North Korea recording airport departures and arrivals and monitoring sea traffic. The submarine returned to CFB Esquimalt on 21 March 2018.

==Heraldry==
===HMS &quot;Upholder&quot; (S40)===
The precursor of &quot;Upholder&quot; (S40) was . In 1941 &quot;Upholder&quot; (P37) was granted a badge which contained a caryatid. The ship&#x27;s captain, Lieutenant Commander Malcolm Wanklyn, described the badge as &quot;an armless Greek bint standing in a dustbin&quot;; and designed his own unofficial badge for the ship. &quot;Upholder&quot; (S40) originally sailed under the earlier &quot;Upholder&quot;&#x27;s official badge, yet was allowed to sail under the badge designed by Wanklyn.

===HMCS &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; (SSK 879)===
The badge&#x27;s blue and white &quot;V&quot; is in reference to the &quot;Victoria&quot;-class submarines and the colours of Quebec. The bear represents the bears which are indigenous to the Chicoutimi area. The bear protects a fleur-de-lis and stands upon waves; representing the lakes and rivers in the Chicoutimi region as well as the maritime environment in which the submarine operates.

The badge of &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; is blazoned:
&quot;Azure in front of a pile argent bordered throughout by a letter &quot;V&quot; also argent fimbriated azure surmounting three bars wavy in base argent a bear rampant sable holding in the forepaws a fleur-de-lis azure&quot;.

The colours of &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; are blue and white. The motto of &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; is , which translates into English as &quot;master of the domain&quot;.

<doc id="1042565" wikidata="Q1389355" url="?curid=1042565" title="FN Model 1949">
<text>The Fabrique Nationale Model 1949 (often referred to as the FN-49, SAFN, or AFN (automatic rifle version) is an autoloading battle rifle designed by Belgian small arms designer Dieudonné Saive in 1947. It was adopted by the militaries of Argentina, Belgium, the Belgian Congo, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Luxembourg, and Venezuela. The selective fire version produced for Belgium was known as the AFN.

While well regarded for its high build quality and reliability in comparison to the rifles of the time, its marketability was limited, as it was not developed in time for use in World War II but later, as many militaries had already begun the switch to selective fire battle rifles. About half of FN-49s were produced as selective fire automatic rifles, but the small 10 round box magazine limited the usefulness of the fully automatic feature.

The FN-49 found itself in direct competition with a number of more modern rifles such as the Heckler &amp; Koch G3 and Fabrique Nationale de Herstal&#x27;s own FN FAL, resulting in limited sales.

== History ==
=== Development ===
Dieudonne Saive, Fabrique Nationale&#x27;s then chief firearm designer, experimented with a number of recoil-operated rifle designs in the early 1930s. While little came of these experiments, they would become the basis for a gas-operated semi-automatic rifle, which he patented in 1936 and prototyped in 1937. (Photographs of these prototypes still exist, and they show a number of characteristics that would later appear in the FN-49.)

FN&#x27;s new rifle was still in development in late 1938 – early 1939, and a version with a 5-round magazine was about to be marketed. When German armies invaded Poland, these plans were delayed to increase production of bolt-action rifles and machine guns.

The German invasion of Belgium in May 1940 interrupted any plans for the production of the new model, as Liège, home of FN&#x27;s factory, was occupied by the German military. Despite this setback, Saive was able to escape to England via Portugal in 1941, where he continued work on what would become the FN-49.

By 1943, Saive was back to working on his experimental rifle, now in 7.92×57mm Mauser. Late that year, the Royal Small Arms Factory, Enfield ordered 50 prototypes (designated &quot;EXP-1&quot; and sometimes referred to as &quot;SLEM-1&quot; or &quot;Self-Loading Experimental Model&quot;). Based on tests with these prototypes, Enfield placed an order for 2,000 rifles for troop trials, but a last-minute problem with the moderation of the gas pressure (as well as the impending end of World War II) led to the cancellation of this order. Despite this, Saive (who had returned to Liège shortly after its liberation in September 1944) continued work on the rifle, and finalized the design for the FN-49 in 1947.

The FN Model 1949 is not ammunition specific, since it has an adjustable gas port or valve to adjust the rifle to various propellant and projectile specific pressure behavior, in which the gas port can be adjusted with a special wrench. This also requires removing the upper forward handguard for the adjustment.

=== Production lifetime ===
The contracts for the SAFN 1949 rifle started in 1948 with the first order placed by Venezuela on March 31, 1948, delivered exactly four months later. The last production contract of complete rifles was ordered by Indonesia on December 19, 1960 and delivered by February 19, 1961.

Some sources claim pre-production models for demonstration and testing were produced in 1948, making rifle ready for contract orders and mass production. Other sources however claim the rifle was trialed with the Royal Netherlands Navy in 1947, The Netherlands Navy trials did not however lead to a sales contract.

FN started looking for customers, but the communist states were not an option (as they were required to buy or build Soviet designs). The Western European nations had vast stocks of World War II firearms. They also could get American and British weapons aid, which was inexpensive or free. So FN decided to market to the non-aligned countries, who did not want to commit to Western or Soviet doctrine, which was inevitable when accepting aid.

The first contract production of the SAFN 1949 rifle was delivered to Venezuela by May 31, 1949. It composed of 2,000 rifles in caliber 7×57mm Mauser, with an additional 2,012 rifles including cut-away training demonstration rifles delivered by July 31, 1949. The remaining rifles of the Venezuelan contract of 8,012 rifles were sold as surplus in the United States, and are prized by US collectors, sportsmen, and hunters because of the unique features ordered by Venezuela, the general good to excellent condition of the surplus rifles, and the superb accuracy of the 7×57mm Mauser cartridge.

The second contract was for the Egyptian government, consisting of 100 rifles chambered to fire the 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge (also popularly known as 8mm Mauser). It was ordered on May 30, 1948 and delivered by June 10, 1949. While initially a small contract delivery, Egypt would eventually purchase 37,602 SAFN 1949 rifles total.

The third contract was ordered by the Belgian government, starting with thirty test rifles on May 12, 1949, received on August 31, 1949, and a second larger order for 100 test rifles delivered by December 12, 1949. The Belgians would make a contract for production of the SAFN 1949 rifle on August 24, 1950 for 6,000 rifles in caliber .30-06 Springfield. The Belgians designated the rifle as the &quot;ABL SAFN-49&quot;, ABL is an acronym for the Belgian Army in both French and Dutch; &quot;AB&quot; for the French &quot;Armée Belge&quot; and &quot;BL&quot; for the Dutch &quot;Belgisch Leger&quot;. The contracts for the SAFN 1949 rifle made by FN for Belgium totaled 87,777 rifles total, composing almost half of all FN-49 rifles ever produced. A selective fire version, known as the AFN was produced for the Belgian military. It is sometimes stated that all the ABL weapons were either built as a selective fire automatic rifle or that all could be readily convertible to selective fire automatic rifle. The AFN was also used by the Marines of the Belgian Navy or ZM-FN. (Zeemacht - Force Navale).

Luxembourg was the fourth country to order the SAFN 1949 rifles, with the first order placed on October 4, 1950 and taking possession of the first 1,500 rifles by May 5, 1951. The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg would eventually purchase a total of 6,306 rifles, including rifles specifically for Luxembourg&#x27;s Gendarmerie, which were FN-49s that comprised standard models, training cut-away rifles, and sniper variants, all in caliber .30-06 Springfield. The Luxembourg models, except for the Gendarmerie contract, were sold as surplus in the United States. Some were distributed to purchasers in larger US chain retail outlets. The Luxembourg models are sought after for two reasons: first, because of the particularly good condition of the Luxembourg surplus rifles; and second, because these FN-49 rifles were chambered for the .30-06 Springfield, a cartridge popular in the US sport shooting and hunting communities. Very few .30-06 FN-49 rifles from other contracts have been imported into the United States, making the Luxembourg rifles the only affordable option for an FN-49 in that caliber.

Indonesia, the Belgian Congo, and Colombia would make up the fifth to seventh contracts, all produced in caliber .30-06 Springfield.

Argentina requested the eighth contract, ordering 5,536 SAFN 1949 rifles in caliber 7.65×53mm Argentine on July 29, 1953 for use by the Argentine Navy after an initial order of one test rifle in 1948.

Several prototypes were made in other calibers, including at least five in 6.5×55mm Swedish for testing in Sweden, one in caliber 7.5×54mm French for testing in Syria, one in caliber .30-06 Springfield for testing in the United States, and one in caliber 7.62×51mm NATO for testing in Brazil.

A very small yet unknown quantity of commercial rifles chambered in .30-06 were imported to the US and Australia by Browning some time during the 1960s. These rifles are incredibly rare and few examples have been documented. They are configured with a polished checkered stock with a rollover cheek piece and side mount.

==== Argentinian modification ====
Contrary to some speculation, FN did not contract or produce the Argentine conversion of SAFN 1949 rifles from 7.65×53mm Argentine to 7.62×51mm NATO. While FN did receive and then later deliver an order for a conversion of a single rifle in March 1967, the remaining armory stock of the Argentine rifles were converted domestically by Metalúrgica Centro, a company formerly known as Fábrica de armas Halcón. Metalúrgica Centro provided and installed in each rifle a new barrel in 7.62×51mm NATO, modified each ejector, and modified each trigger guard to take a new 20 round detachable box magazine. The converted rifles were provided with proprietary 20 round detachable box magazines manufactured by Metalúrgica Centro to fit the SAFN 1949 rifle conversions. The 20 round steel magazines are proprietary, but were made to share the magazine loading charger with the FN FAL rifle used by the Argentine Army. These chargers are the same as for the Mauser Kar-98k, and thus not interchangeable with standard NATO stripper clips. These are very inexpensive via surplus dealers. Not only are Mauser 98 stripper clips not interchangeable with 7.62×51mm NATO standard, but also not with old 7.65×53mm Argentine versions.

A very small number were later used in the Falklands War as sniper rifles by the Argentinians.

<doc id="1042588" wikidata="Q965436" url="?curid=1042588" title="Iliamna Lake">
<text>Iliamna Lake or Lake Iliamna ( ; ; ) is a lake in southwest Alaska, at the north end of the Alaska Peninsula, between Kvichak Bay and Cook Inlet, about west of Seldovia, Alaska. It shares a name with the Iliamna River, which flows into it, and the nearby community of Iliamna, Alaska.

It is the largest lake in Alaska, 7th largest lake in the United States, and twenty-fourth in North America. Covering about , Iliamna Lake is long and up to wide, with a maximum depth of . Through the Kvichak River, its waters drain into Bristol Bay.

==History==

===Name===
The lake is marked as &#x27;Oz[ero] Bol[shoy] Ilyamna&#x27; (Big Ilyamna Lake) on the Russian Hydrographical Department&#x27;s Chart 1455, published in 1852. On an earlier Russian map, from 1802, the lake was named &#x27;Oz[ero] Shelekhovo&#x27; (Lake Shelekov) after Russian explorer Grigory Shelekhov. According to G.C. Martin, of the United States Geological Survey, Iliamna is said to be &quot;the name of a mythical great blackfish supposed to inhabit this lake, which bites holes in the bidarkas of bad natives.&quot;
The name Iliamna is derived from the Inland Dena&#x27;ina Athabascan name &quot;Nila Vena,&quot; which means &quot;island&#x27;s lake&quot;.

==Economy==

===Williamsport-Pile Bay Road portage===
Originally constructed by the Alaska Road Commission during the mid 1930s, the Williamsport-Pile Bay Road is a utility-class road maintained by the Alaska Department of Transportation &amp; Public Facilities. Connecting Pile Bay on the lake&#x27;s northeast side with Williamsport, a tiny settlement on the Iliamna Bay of Cook Inlet (about southwest of Homer), the road is long and one lane wide with four bridges. The Williamsport-Pile Bay Road is maintained as a gravel utility road for the purpose of hauling boats and freight, and is not intended for general purpose use. The road allows boats small enough to be hauled across the road&#x27;s bridges an opportunity to portage from Cook Inlet to Bristol Bay, saving a trip on the open ocean which involves traveling around the Alaska Peninsula. For this and other reasons, the road is also believed to significantly reduce fuel costs for the Lake Iliamna and Bristol Bay regions.

===Populated places===
The villages of Iliamna, Newhalen, Kokhanok, Pedro Bay, Pope-Vannoy Landing and Igiugig lie on the shores of Iliamna Lake.

===Flora and fauna===
Iliamna Lake is noted for its sport fishing. The three primary targets of anglers in the lake are trout, salmon, and grayling. August through September is prime time for catching fat rainbow trout, some of which exceed 28 inches long. The Kvichak River Policy (the drainage of Lake Iliamna) is catch and release on trout (and all other native fish), but not on salmon. Sockeye (red) and Chinook (king) salmon are consistently found in the lake and are open to harvest under Alaska Department of Fish and Game Regulations. Lake Iliamna also has one of few populations of freshwater seals in the world. It also serves as a nursery for the largest red salmon run in the world. Red salmon spend half of their 5-year lifespan in fresh water. This is longer than any other species of salmon.

==Monster Legend==

Local residents have a number of stories about the alleged Iliamna Lake Monster, an unknown aquatic creature. Speculation exists that reported sightings may be of an undocumented population of white sturgeon. If true, this would be the most northerly population known to exist, just a few hundred miles from the Arctic Circle. Jeremy Wade, presenter of Animal Planet&#x27;s River Monsters, is among those who speculate these sightings of a reputed &quot;monster&quot; are of a white sturgeon. Others believe that it is a Pacific sleeper shark. Proponents of this theory point to a 2012 YouTube video that shows a smaller Pacific sleeper shark in King Cove Lagoon, King Cove, Alaska. There were several new supposed sightings in 2017. The Anchorage Daily News once offered a prize of $100,000 for concrete proof of its existence.

<text>A war correspondent is a journalist who covers stories first-hand from a war zone.

War correspondence stands as one of journalism&#x27;s most important and impactful forms. War correspondents operate in the most conflict-ridden parts of the world. Once there, they attempt to get close enough to the action to provide written accounts, photos, or film footage. It is often considered the most dangerous form of journalism.

Modern war correspondence emerged from the news reporting of military conflicts during the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars. Its presence grew in the middle of the nineteenth century, with American journalists covering the Mexican-American War (1846-1848) and the European newspapermen writing reports from the Crimean War (1853-1856).

== History ==

People have written about wars for thousands of years. Herodotus&#x27;s account of the Persian Wars is similar to journalism, though he did not himself participate in the events. Thucydides, who some years later wrote a history of the Peloponnesian War was a commander and an observer to the events he described. Memoirs of soldiers became an important source of military history when that specialty developed. War correspondents, as specialized journalists, began working after the printing of news for publication became commonplace.

In the eighteenth century the Baroness Frederika Charlotte Riedesel&#x27;s &quot;Letters and Journals Relating to the War of the American Revolution and the Capture of the German Troops at Saratoga&quot; is regarded as the first account of war by a woman. Her description of the events that took place in the Marshall House are particularly poignant because she was in the midst of battle.

The first modern war correspondent is said to be Dutch painter Willem van de Velde, who in 1653 took to sea in a small boat to observe a naval battle between the Dutch and the English, of which he made many sketches on the spot, which he later developed into one big drawing that he added to a report he wrote to the States General. A further modernization came with the development of newspapers and magazines. One of the earliest war correspondents was Henry Crabb Robinson, who covered Napoleon&#x27;s campaigns in Spain and Germany for &quot;The Times&quot; of London. Another early correspondent was William Hicks whose letters describing the Battle of Trafalgar (1805) were also published in The Times. Winston Churchill in 1899, working as a correspondent, became notorious as an escaped prisoner of war.

Early film newsreels and television news rarely had war correspondents. Rather, they would simply collect footage provided by other sources, often the government, and the news anchor would then add narration. This footage was often staged as cameras were large and bulky until the introduction of small, portable motion picture cameras during World War II. The situation changed dramatically with the Vietnam War when networks from around the world sent cameramen with portable cameras and correspondents. This proved damaging to the United States as the full brutality of war became a daily feature on the nightly news.

News coverage gives combatants an opportunity to forward information and arguments to the media. By this means, conflict parties attempt to use the media to gain support from their constituencies and dissuade their opponents. The continued progress of technology has allowed live coverage of events via satellite up-links and the rise of twenty-four hour news channels has led to a heightened demand for material to fill the hours.

Only some conflicts receive extensive worldwide coverage, however. Among recent wars, the Kosovo War, the Persian Gulf War and the Russo-Ukrainian war received a great deal of coverage. In contrast, the largest war in the last half of the 20th century, the Iran–Iraq War, received far less substantial coverage. This is typical for wars among less-developed countries, as audiences are less interested and the reports do little to increase sales and ratings. The lack of infrastructure makes reporting more difficult and expensive, and the conflicts are also far more dangerous for war correspondents.

War correspondents are protected by the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their additional protocols. In general, journalists are considered civilians so they have all rights related to the civilians in a conflict.

===Crimean War===
William Howard Russell, who covered the Crimean War, also for &quot;The Times&quot;, was perhaps the first modern war correspondent. The stories from this era, which were almost as lengthy and analytical as early books on war, took numerous weeks from being written to being published.

===Third Italian War of Independence===
Another renowned journalist, Ferdinando Petruccelli della Gattina, Italian correspondent of European newspapers such as &quot;La Presse&quot;, &quot;Journal des débats&quot;, &quot;Indépendance Belge&quot; and &quot;The Daily News&quot;, was known for his extremely gory style in his articles but involving at the same time. Jules Claretie, critic of , was amazed about his correspondence of the Battle of Custoza, during the Third Italian War of Independence. Claretie wrote, &quot;Nothing could be more fantastic and cruelly true than this tableau of agony. Reportage has never given a superior artwork.&quot;

=== Russo-Japanese War ===
When the telegraph was developed, reports could be sent on a daily basis and events could be reported as they occurred. That is when short, mainly descriptive stories as used today became common. Press coverage of the Russo-Japanese War was affected by restrictions on the movement of reporters and strict censorship. In all military conflicts which followed this 1904–1905 war, close attention to more managed reporting was considered essential.

=== First and Second Balkan Wars ===

The First Balkan War (1912–1913) between the Balkan League (Serbia, Greece, Montenegro and Bulgaria) and the Ottoman Empire, and the Second Balkan War (1913) between Bulgaria and its former allies Serbia and Greece, was actively covered by a large number of foreign newspapers, news agencies, and movie companies. An estimated 200–300 war correspondents, war photographers, war artists, and war cinematographers were active during these two nearly sequential conflicts.

===First World War===

The First World War was characterized by rigid censorship. British Lord Kitchener hated reporters, and they were banned from the Front at the start of the war. But reporters such as Basil Clarke and Philip Gibbs lived as fugitives near the Front, sending back their reports. The Government eventually allowed some accredited reporters in April 1915, and this continued until the end of the war. This allowed the Government to control what they saw.

French authorities were equally opposed to war journalism, but less competent (criticisms of the French high command were leaked to the press during the Battle of Verdun in 1916). was imposed by the United States, though General John J. Pershing allowed embedded reporters (Floyd Gibbons had been severely wounded at the Battle of Belleau Wood in 1918).

===Second World War===

====United Kingdom====

At the beginning of the war the matters of war reporting came under the authority of a Public Relations Section created as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). At the beginning of World War II, the War Office urged all the major newspapers to nominate men to accompany the BEF. While the official process of vetting journalists took place, the War Office authorised to provide a limited ‘eye-witness’ coverage. Journalist Alex Clifford became one the first ‘eye-witness’ who joined the BEF units in France in September 1939. 
The first official group of British, Commonwealth and American correspondents arrived in France on October 10, 1939 (among them were O. D. Gallagher, Bernard Gray).

All of the war reporting was subject to censorship, directed by the chief press censor George Pirie Thomson. At the start of the war the Royal Navy implemented a policy that curtailed war correspondents&#x27; presence on its ships. This positioned them as the most conservative branch of the British military in terms of media engagement.

=== Vietnam War ===

The US conflict in Vietnam saw the tools and access available to war correspondents expanded significantly. Innovations such as cheap and reliable hand-held color video cameras, and the proliferation of television sets in Western homes give Vietnam-era correspondents the ability to portray conditions on the ground more vividly and accurately than ever before. Additionally, the US Military allowed unprecedented access for journalists, with almost no restrictions on the press, unlike in previous conflicts. These factors produced military coverage the likes of which had never been seen or anticipated, with explicit coverage of the human suffering produced by the war available right in the living rooms of everyday people.

Vietnam-era war correspondence was markedly different from that of WWI and WWII, with more focus on investigative journalism and discussion of the ethics surrounding the war and America&#x27;s role in it. Reporters from dozens of media outlets were dispatched to Vietnam, with the number of correspondents surpassing 400 at the peak of the war. Vietnam was a dangerous war for these journalists, and 68 would be killed before the conflict came to a close.

Many within the US Government and elsewhere would blame the media for the American failure in Vietnam, claiming that media focus on atrocities, the horrors of combat and the impact on soldiers damaged morale and eliminated support for the war at home. Unlike in older conflicts, where Allied journalism was almost universally supportive of the war effort, journalists in the Vietnam theater were often harshly critical of the US military, and painted a very bleak picture of the war. In an era where the media was already playing a significant role in domestic events such as the Civil Rights Movement, war correspondence in Vietnam would have a major impact on the American political scene. Some have argued that the conduct of war correspondents in Vietnam is to blame for the tightening of restrictions on journalists by the US in wars that followed, including the Persian Gulf war and the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

During the Vietnam War, UPI correspondent Joseph Galloway was present at the battle of the Ia Drang. The U.S. Army awarded him the Bronze Star for his actions during the battle, a rare event for a journalist. Along with Gen. Hal Moore, who commanded U.S. forces in the battle, Galloway subsequently wrote about his experiences in the book, We Were Soldiers Once ... and Young: Ia Drang - The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam. 

=== Gulf War ===
The role of war correspondents in the Gulf War would prove to be quite different from their role in Vietnam. The Pentagon blamed the media for the loss of the Vietnam war, and prominent military leaders did not believe the United States could sustain a prolonged and heavily televised war. As a result, numerous restrictions were placed on the activities of correspondents covering the war in the Gulf. Journalists allowed to accompany the troops were organized into &quot;pools&quot;, where small groups were escorted into combat zones by US troops and allowed to share their findings later. Those who attempted to strike out on their own and operate outside the pool system claim to have found themselves obstructed directly or indirectly by the military, with passport visas revoked and photographs and notes taken by force from journalists while US forces observed.

Beyond military efforts to control the press, observers noted that press reaction to the Gulf War was markedly different from that of Vietnam. Critics claim that coverage of the war was &quot;jingoistic&quot; and overly favorable towards American forces, in harsh contrast to the criticism and muckraking that had characterized coverage of Vietnam. Journalists like CNN&#x27;s Peter Arnett were lambasted for reporting anything that could be construed as contrary to the war effort, and commentators observed that coverage of the war in general was &quot;saccharine&quot; and heavily biased towards the American account.

These trends would continue into the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, where the pool model was replaced by a new system of embedded journalism.
