<text>The Mersey Railway was the passenger railway connecting the communities of Liverpool and Birkenhead, England. It is currently a part of the Merseyrail network. It was extended further into the Wirral Peninsula, which lies on the opposite bank of the River Mersey to Liverpool. Both sides of the river were connected via the Mersey Railway Tunnel. The railway opened in 1886 with four stations using steam locomotives hauling unheated wooden carriages; in the next six years the line was extended with the opening of three more stations. Using the first tunnel under the Mersey, the line is the world&#x27;s oldest underground railway outside London.

Because the steam locomotives created a polluted atmosphere in the tunnel despite the forced ventilation system, many passengers reverted back to using the river ferries making the railway bankrupt by 1900. Recovery came after the railway adopted electric traction in 1903. The Mersey Railway remained independent after the railway grouping of 1923, although it became closely integrated with the electric train services operated by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway over the former Wirral Railway routes after 1938. The Mersey Railway was nationalised, along with most other British railway companies, in 1948.

==History==

===Origins===
Records exist of a ferry service across the River Mersey between Birkenhead on the west bank and Liverpool on the east since the Middle Ages. In 1332 the monks of Birkenhead Priory were granted exclusive rights to operate a ferry; following the dissolution of the monasteries these rights passed through a number of operators eventually to the township of Birkenhead.


It is recorded that Marc Isambard Brunel suggested a road tunnel when designing the Birkenhead docks and from the 1850s a railway tunnel under the Mersey was proposed several times. The Mersey Pneumatic Railway Company received permission for a single line pneumatic railway in the Mersey Railway Act 1866 (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. cxxxix) but failed to raise the necessary capital. Renamed the Mersey Railway Company, they were given the necessary permissions in the Mersey Railway Act 1871 (34 &amp; 35 Vict. c. cci) for an orthodox two track railway connecting the Birkenhead Railway near their station through a tunnel under the Mersey to an underground station serving Liverpool. However the company found it difficult to raise the necessary funds until Major Samuel Isaac undertook to build the railway in 1881. He contracted construction to John Waddell, who appointed Charles Douglas Fox and James Brunlees as Engineers.

Construction of the river tunnel started from two deep shafts, one on each bank, containing water pumps. Three tunnels were to be dug, one for the two tracks, a drainage tunnel and a ventilation tunnel. A diameter ventilation tunnel was dug as the pilot heading. Some 38 million bricks were used for the construction of the main tunnel. When the tunnel was opened, fans on both banks changed the air in the tunnel every seven minutes.

The geology of the riverbed meant that the plans were changed and at the deepest section the drainage and ventilation tunnels combined. The grade on the Liverpool side was increased to 1 in 27. Estimates of the influx of water varied from to per minute; after the works were completed the maximum pumped out of the tunnel has been per minute. There were two pumping stations, Shore Road Pumping Station on the Birkenhead bank near Hamilton Square and Georges Dock Pumping Station on Mann Island on the Liverpool Bank. The railway&#x27;s workshop was built next to Birkenhead Central; stabling was also provided at Birkenhead Park.
===Opening and extensions===

The Mersey Railway was formally opened on 20 January 1886 and public services started on 1 February. The route had four new stations: Green Lane, Birkenhead Central and Hamilton Square in Birkenhead and James Street station in Liverpool. Green Lane and Birkenhead Central were below ground level in open cuttings whereas James Street and Hamilton Square were deep underground and accessed by lifts.

In 1888 a branch tunnel to Birkenhead Park station opened, with a connection to the Wirral Railway. This was followed in 1891 by an extension from Green Lane to bay platforms at the Birkenhead Railway&#x27;s Rock Ferry station, and in 1892 the tunnel was extended from James Street to a new underground station at Liverpool Central.

The railway opened with steam locomotives hauling four-wheeled -long wooden carriages, with first-, second- and third-class accommodation provided in unheated compartments. In 1900 in the peak periods trains left the Rock Ferry terminus every minutes and the Birkenhead Park terminus every 15 minutes, giving a train every 5 minutes between Hamilton Square and Liverpool Central. At off-peak times this was reduced to a train every minutes, alternately from the Rock Ferry and Birkenhead Park branches. The scheduled journey time between Rock Ferry and Central was 14 minutes; between Birkenhead Park and Central, 10 minutes.

As well as some through working of carriages from the Wirral Railway at Birkenhead Park, in the summer of 1899 a through service worked from Liverpool to ; carriages were taken to Rock Ferry, and there attached to a GWR Paddington express train; the carriages were slipped at Reading before being taken on to Folkestone attached to another train. Connecting ferries and trains allowed Paris to be reached in under 15 hours.

===Electrification===
The traffic peaked in 1890, when ten million passengers were carried, and then declined. Two years previously the company had been declared bankrupt and receivers appointed, because it was unable to pay the charges on its debt. Steam locomotives running at five-minute headways left a dirty atmosphere in the tunnel that the mechanical ventilation was unable to remove, so many passengers preferred the ferries.

Some other urban railways had been constructed for electric traction: in 1890 the City and South London underground tube had opened with electric traction, followed in 1893 by the more local Liverpool Overhead Railway. Plans for electrification of the Mersey Railway in 1895 were shelved because the company and its investors were fighting in the courts. In 1897 a new board of directors was elected, and in 1898, £500 was released for further expert advice that recommended electrification at a cost of £260,000 (equivalent to £ in ). By then, the railway had attracted the attention of George Westinghouse, an American in the UK looking for business for his UK works, the British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co. Ltd, that opened at Trafford Park in 1899. Westinghouse considered the railway would be profitable with electric traction and undertook to fund the project, promising to complete in eighteen months. Electrification was approved by Parliament in the Mersey Railway Act 1900 (63 &amp; 64 Vict. c. cxxxiv), which also terminated the bankruptcy, and in July 1901 the Westinghouse contract was signed.

All electrical equipment was shipped from the US, including power system plant equipment. A power station was built at the Shore Road pumping station and was designed to accommodate the extension of electrification to the Wirral Railway, although that did not occur until 1938. The conductor rails were fed direct, without any distribution. Four-rail 600 V DC electrification was installed, with the positive outer rail set from the running rail. The new electric multiple units, initially marshalled as 2-car or 4-car sets, had British-built wooden bodies on US bogies. 24 motor cars and 33 trailer cars were provided. The driving positions controlled all the motors on the train by the means of a low voltage control signal.

After inspection by the Board of Trade, the line was approved as fit for traffic on 3 April 1903. The last steam trains ran on Saturday 2 May and the current to the electrified rails was switched on at 3:30 am. At 4:53 am the first electric train arrived at Liverpool Central, and for the Sunday morning trains ran at 3-minute intervals without passengers. Passengers were admitted when the advertised Sunday service started at noon.

The stations were cleaned, whitewashed and electrically lit. A service was provided every three minutes from Liverpool Central to Hamilton Square and journeys were faster: Central to Rock Ferry was eleven minutes, down from fifteen minutes and the Central to Birkenhead Park journey was reduced by two minutes, down to eight minutes.

There was a maximum of four cars per train in 1904, which was raised to five cars in 1909. In 1923, automatic signalling was commissioned at Liverpool Central and in 1927 the island platform was widened, the work being completed in a weekend. The maximum number of cars in a train was raised to six in 1936, after the tunnels at the east end of Liverpool Central had been extended.

===Wirral Railway===
As a local railway the Mersey Railway remained independent in the 1923 grouping, although the Wirral Railway became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The Wirral had authority to electrify its lines, but had not done so, and passengers making through journeys had to change at Birkenhead Park. In 1926 discussions started on electrification and through running. The Wirral section was electrified with a DC third rail system, the Mersey Railway retaining its fourth rail but moving the positive conductor to from the running rail. The Mersey Railway electric multiple units were modified to run to the Wirral railway, and at the same time heaters and air compressors were added.

In 1938 the LMS introduced new lightweight three car multiple units that were later, under British Rail, to be classified Class 503.

===Nationalisation and legacy===
In 1948, on nationalisation of the railways, the Mersey Railway became the Mersey section of the London Midland Region. In 1956 these trains were replaced by Class 503 units, similar to the LMS Class 502 design, and the fourth rail removed. The last of the American-designed cars was withdrawn a year later.

A single track loop line was built between 1972 and 1977, and since 1977 trains from James Street have travelled round the loop calling at , and a new platform at Liverpool Central before returning to James Street. The original two platforms at Liverpool Central were reused as part of the Northern Line. The tunnel and railway are still in use today as part of the Wirral Line of the Merseyrail commuter rail network.

Shore Road Pumping Station in Birkenhead was a museum until closure sometime before 2014. Georges Dock Pumping Station on Mann Island in Liverpool is a grade II listed building.

For the opening of the line, eight powerful 0-6-4 tank locomotives were obtained from Beyer, Peacock and Company, fitted with condensing apparatus for working in the tunnel. Designated as Class I, a ninth followed within six months. Beyer Peacock also built six 2-6-2T tank locomotives in 1887 (Class II) and three further 2-6-2T (Class III) were built by Kitson and Company in 1892.

The 0-6-4Ts were built with steam and vacuum brakes and steam reversing gear and weighed . The 2-6-2Ts were fitted with vacuum brakes only; those built by Beyer weighed and Kitson&#x27;s .

As electrification progressed, the old rolling stock was advertised for sale. An attempt to sell the 18 locomotives and 96 carriages by auction in June 1903 proved unsuccessful – the auctioneer had to remind the bidders that he was not selling scrap. It was September before the first locomotive was sold; it would take another two years to sell all-bar-one of the locomotives. The last locomotive — which had been retained for working permanent way trains — was sold in January 1908.

The first to be sold was No. 5 &quot;Cecil Raikes&quot;, which was bought by Shipley Collieries for £750. They came back and bought No. 8 for £650; but not before Alexandra (Newport and South Wales) Docks and Railway had bought all six of the Class II locomotives for £3,450. They became ADR 6–11 (not in order). Alexandra Docks later bought four more locomotives: Three 0-6-4T (Nos. 2, 3 and 6), and one Class III 2-6-2T (No. 16), these becoming 24–22 and 25. All ten ADR locomotives passed to the Great Western Railway in January 1922, and were withdrawn between January 1923 and May 1932.

The other two Class III locomotives were bought by Whitwood Colliery for £1,240.

The last four locomotives (Nos. 1, 7, 9 and 4) were sold to J &amp; A Brown (as their Nos. 5–8) for use on the Richmond Vale railway line in New South Wales, Australia. No. 4 &quot;Gladstone&quot; had been retained by the Mersey Railway until 1907 for departmental use, but was then replaced by Metropolitan Railway A Class (4-4-0T) No. 61, built by Beyer Peacock. This was replaced in 1927 by an earlier Metropolitan Railway 4-4-0T, No. 7.

Two of the Class I locomotive have been preserved: No. 5 &quot;Cecil Raikes&quot; is preserved at the Museum of Liverpool; and No. 1 &quot;The Major&quot; is preserved at the NSW Rail Museum, Thirlmere, New South Wales.

===Locomotive-hauled coaching stock===
Between 1904 and 1907 thirteen four-wheeled gas-lit coaches were sold to the Liskeard and Looe Railway. Built by the Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company Ltd between 1885 and 1888, the sale price was between £20 and £70 each. In 1912, the six surviving examples were sold on to the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway.

===Electric multiple units===
In 1903 24 motor cars and 33 trailers were provided by Westinghouse. The stock was of an American design, with a clerestory roof and open gated ends. Unheated accommodation was in saloons and the wooden bodies were British built, and the bogies had been made by Baldwin Locomotive Works in America. First- and third-class cars were provided, the first-class seats being of natural rattan and the third-class seats being moulded plywood. The livery was maroon with white roofs and &quot;Mersey Railway&quot; in gold leaf on the upper fascia panels. Air brakes were provided with storage reservoirs that were recharged from static compressors at the terminal stations. The motor cars were powered with Westinghouse motors controlled by the Westinghouse low voltage multiple unit train control system.

An additional four trailers were received in 1908 followed in 1923 by two more motor cars and in 1925 a new five-car train. To allow the introduction of 6-car trains in 1936, ten trailer units were ordered. The later cars did not have a clerestory roof, but any car could work in multiple with any other car.

When the cars were modified to run to the Wirral railway, heaters and air compressors were added. The cars were replaced by vehicles similar to the Wirral Railway units in 1956–57.

Car no. 1, a first-class motor coach, was destroyed in a fire at Derby Litchurch Lane Works, where it had been taken for overhaul in preparation for restoration and preservation.

==Preservation==
Only two of the Class I locomotive have been preserved: No. 5 &quot;Cecil Raikes&quot; is preserved at the Museum of Liverpool; and no. 1 &quot;The Major&quot; is preserved at the NSW Rail Museum, Thirlmere, New South Wales, Australia.

<doc id="1057497" wikidata="Q917121" url="?curid=1057497" title="Path (Toronto)">
<text>Path (stylized as PATH) is a network of underground pedestrian tunnels, elevated walkways, and at-grade walkways connecting the office towers of Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It connects more than 70 buildings via of tunnels, walkways, and shopping areas. According to Guinness World Records, Path is the largest underground shopping complex in the world, with of retail space which includes over 1,200 retail fronts (2016). As of 2016, over 200,000 residents and workers use the Path system daily with the number of private dwellings within walking distance at 30,115.

The Path network&#x27;s northern point is the Atrium on Bay at Dundas Street and Bay Street, including a now-closed tunnel to the former Toronto Coach Terminal, while its southern point is Waterpark Place on Queens Quay. Its main north–south axes of walkways generally parallel Yonge and Bay Streets, while its main east–west axis parallels King Street.

There is continuous expansion of the Path system around Union Station. Two towers being built as part of CIBC Square will be linked to the Path system, extending it to the east to cross over Yonge Street by a pedestrian bridge into the Backstage Condominium building (Esplanade and Yonge corner), giving closed access to Union Station, Scotiabank Arena, and other buildings in Toronto&#x27;s Financial District.

==History==
===Early pedestrian tunnels===

In 1900, the Eaton&#x27;s department store constructed a tunnel underneath James Street, allowing shoppers to walk between the Eaton&#x27;s main store at Yonge and Queen streets and the Eaton&#x27;s Annex located behind the (then) City Hall. It was the first underground pedestrian pathway in Toronto and is often credited as a historic precursor to the current Path network. The original Eaton&#x27;s tunnel is still in use as part of the Path system, although today it connects Toronto Eaton Centre to the Bell Trinity Square office complex on the site of the former Annex building.

Another original underground linkage, built in 1927 to connect Union Station and the Royal York Hotel, remained an integral part of the Path network for many years until it was replaced by a newer connection between the Royal York Hotel and Royal Bank Plaza, which continues onward to Union Station.

===Expansion===

The network of underground walkways expanded under city planner Matthew Lawson in the 1960s. Toronto&#x27;s downtown sidewalks were overcrowded, and new office towers were removing the much-needed small businesses from the streets. Lawson thus convinced several important developers to construct underground malls, pledging that they would eventually be linked. The designers of the Toronto-Dominion Centre, the first of Toronto&#x27;s major urban developments in the 1960s (completed in 1967), were the first to include underground shopping in their complex, with the possibility of future expansion built in. The city originally helped fund the construction, but with the election of a reform city council, this practice ended. The reformers disliked the underground system, agreeing with Jane Jacobs&#x27;s notion that an active street life was important in keeping cities and neighbourhoods vital and that consumers should be encouraged to shop on street level stores rather than in malls (whether they be above ground or below); however, the system continued to grow, as developers bowed to their tenants&#x27; wishes and connected their buildings to the system. This also converted low-valued basements into some of the most valuable retail space in the country.

The next expansion of the network occurred in the early 1970s with the construction and underground connection of the Richmond-Adelaide Centre office tower with the Sheraton Centre hotel complex.

===21st century===

Construction of the Path tunnel north from Scotia Plaza through the Bay Adelaide Centre started in the fourth quarter of 2007. Completion of this section closed the last remaining gap in the north–south route through Path that parallels Yonge Street, thus eliminating the need to double back from Bay Street to get between buildings located on the eastern edge of Path.

In 2011, the City of Toronto released a long-term expansion plan for the Path network, developed by Urban Strategies Inc. As part of the expansion plan, there will be 45 new entry points, and the walkway expanded to as long as when changes are completed.

In August 2014, a major southward expansion of the Path network brought it closer to the Toronto waterfront, with the opening of a covered pedestrian bridge connecting Scotiabank Arena south to RBC WaterPark Place on Queens Quay (crossing the Lake Shore Boulevard / Gardiner Expressway corridor and Harbour Street).

The City of Toronto constructed a , $65-million tunnel connecting Union Station to Wellington Street, the first publicly owned segment of the Path subterranean shopping district. Toronto planners have begun work to guide future Path development and ensure Path construction is included in basement levels of key new buildings.

The network was particularly hard-hit during the COVID-19 pandemic in Toronto, with Bloomberg News calling the area a &quot;ghost town&quot;. The pedestrian system&#x27;s narrow halls in some locations were noted as a particular challenge, even once downtown employees returned to the office. The Toronto Financial District Business Improvement Area has planned various movement modifications to the space for future use.

In early November 2020, a connection was opened between the Maple Leaf Square complex (via the basement-level Longo&#x27;s supermarket) and ÏCE Condominiums at York Centre. On December 5, 2020, the new Union Station Bus Terminal was opened within the new CIBC Square complex and connected via a skywalk to the Scotiabank Arena.

In 2025, a navigation app for the Path system was released. The app contains 3D maps and photographs of each entrance and exit.

==Design==
Path provides an important contribution to the economic viability of the city&#x27;s downtown core and is also used to supplement sidewalk capacity in downtown Toronto. The system facilitates pedestrian linkages to public transit, accommodating more than 200,000 daily commuters and thousands of additional tourists and residents en route to sports and cultural events. Its underground nature provides pedestrians with a safe haven from the winter cold and snow, as well as relief from the summer heat and humidity.

===Coordination and signage===

In 1987, City Council adopted a unified wayfinding system throughout the network. The design firms Gottschalk+Ash International and Muller Design Associates were hired to design and implement the overall system in consultation with a diverse group of land owners, City staff and stakeholders. A colour-coded system with directional cues was deployed in the early 1990s. Within the various buildings, pedestrians can find a Path system map, plus cardinal directions (red for south, orange for west, blue for north, yellow for east) on ceiling signs at selected junctions. These same colours are also used in the Path logo. 

The signage can be hard to find inside some of the various connected buildings. Building owners concerned about losing customers to neighbouring buildings insisted any signage not dominate their buildings or their own signage system. The city relented and the result is the current system. Many complain the system is hard to navigate.

=== New Path signage ===
In 2016, the Toronto Financial District Business Improvement Area (FDBIA) and City of Toronto began study of updating Path signage and maps to make navigation easier. In 2018, Steer Davies Gleave completed design of a new wayfinding system that is still used today. This system was rolled out in some buildings in 2018. In 2024, the FDBIA completed a comprehensive update of all existing Path installations that brought this system to all buildings with Path installations. 

The new system no longer uses the colour-coded compass system and refers to neighbourhoods and landmarks instead. The system also integrates with TO360, Toronto’s neighbourhood mapping and wayfinding system. 

==Connected facilities==
More than 50 buildings or office towers are connected through the Path system. It comprises twenty parking garages, five subway stations, two major department stores, two major shopping centres, six major hotels, and a railway terminal. The CN Tower, Ripley&#x27;s Aquarium of Canada, and Rogers Centre are connected via an enclosed elevated walkway, called the SkyWalk, from Union Station, although the walkway does not have indoor connections to these attractions.

<text>William Britton &quot;Bil&quot; Baird (August 15, 1904 – March 18, 1987) was an American puppeteer of the mid- and late 20th century. He and his puppets performed for millions of adults and children. One of his better known creations was Charlemane the lion. He and his wife Cora Eisenberg Baird (1912–1967) produced and performed the famous puppetry sequence for &quot;The Lonely Goatherd&quot; in the film version of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. His son Peter Baird was also a puppeteer, and he continued his family&#x27;s legacy until his own death in July 2004.

He wrote &quot;The Art of the Puppet&quot; (1965) and provided the puppets for &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. Baird also created the expandable nose Peter Noone wore as Pinocchio in the 1968 musical adaptation of the Carlo Collodi story that aired on NBC as a &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; special.

==Early life==
Born in Grand Island, Nebraska, Baird grew up in Mason City, Iowa. He traced his love of puppets to the moment when his father made him a simple string puppet when he was eight. In 1921, he attended a local performance of the Tony Sarg production of &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot;, which cemented his interest. By the time he was 14, Baird was creating his own puppets and giving performances in the attic of his parents&#x27; home. In 1928, he helped Tony Sarg create the giant balloons for Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day parade.

==Performance career==
A graduate of the University of Iowa and the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, he began work with childhood idol Tony Sarg in New York City in 1928. Several years later Baird formed his own company, the Baird Marionettes, which performed initially at the Chicago World’s Fair of 1933.

In 1950, Baird and Producer Yul Brynner created a show based on his character Snarky Parker called &quot;Life With Snarky Parker&quot;, which was a satire of American Westerns. The show featured numerous characters who were previously created by Baird, including &quot;Snarky Parker&quot;, the lion &quot;Charlemane&quot;, &quot;Flannel Mouse&quot;, &quot;Slugger Ryan&quot;, a piano-playing rod puppet, along with new characters &quot;Fluffy&quot; and &quot;Nolan&quot;, the Villain &quot;Ronald Rodent&quot;, the slightly befuddled &quot;Birdie&quot;, the seductive &quot;Cuda Bara&quot;, the schoolteacher and Snarky&#x27;s love interest &quot;Butterbelle&quot;, and her father &quot;Paw&quot;. In 1951, Baird&#x27;s Marionettes performed some of the roles in the Broadway musical &quot;Flahooley&quot;, a fantasy about a mass-produced laughing doll who unintentionally threatens the American industrial system. Then, in 1956, Baird&#x27;s puppets &quot;Gargle&quot; and &quot;Snarky&quot; appeared in &quot;Adventures in Numbers and Space&quot;, a nine-part series by Westinghouse Broadcasting designed to interest children in mathematics.

===Late 1950s–1960s===
From 1958 to 1963, Baird&#x27;s puppets often appeared on an educational show known as &quot;Parlons Français&quot; (Let&#x27;s Talk French), which taught young children how to speak French. For this show, Baird created three new hand puppets named &quot;Patapouf&quot;, &quot;Lady Graybangs&quot; and &quot;Cliquot&quot;, who provided lessons to children while accompanied by Anne Slack, the hostess of the program.

The text of his &quot;The Magic Onion&quot; play for puppets was first published in &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; in 1961. It is performed still, and features &quot;a beautiful princess and her faithful dog, a wicked magician and his magic onion, a handsome prince, a hungry dragon, and a castle in an enchanted blue forest.&quot;

In 1959, Baird helped create Schultz &amp; Dooley, who appeared in advertisements for Utica Club Beer from 1959–1964.

They toured Russia, India, Nepal, Afghanistan, and Turkey, appeared in &quot;The Lonely Goatherd&quot; sequence in the film &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965), as well as in the ABC-TV 1958 television special &quot;Art Carney Meets Peter and the Wolf&quot; and &quot;Art Carney Meets the Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, graced many World&#x27;s Fairs, created commercials for Remington Razors, Wildroot Cream-Oil, Wheaties cereal, Borden Dairy, Bonomo Taffy, United Cerebral Palsy, and Young &amp; Rubicam and were part of five Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parades. During the 1964/65 World&#x27;s Fair in New York City, Baird&#x27;s Marionettes hosted &quot;The Show-Go-Round&quot;, an elaborate musical exhibit in the Chrysler Pavilion.

Opening in 1967, the Bil Baird Marionette Theater at 59 Barrow Street in Greenwich Village presented plays for more than a decade. Among them, &quot;Ali Baba&quot;, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;, &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;, &quot;Davy Jones&#x27; Locker&quot;, &quot;A Pageant of Puppet Variety&quot;, &quot;Holiday on Strings&quot;, &quot;People is the Thing That the World is Fullest Of&quot;, &quot;Bil Baird&#x27;s Band-Wagon&quot;, &quot;The Dragon and The Dentist&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Histoire du Soldat&quot;, and &quot;The Whistling Wizard and the Sultan of Tuffet&quot;.

===1970s–1980s===
In 1972, Baird created an educational short film called Cartonella which told about the importance of milk, the short was a typical &#x27;Damsel in Distress&#x27; story which featured the eponymously named &quot;Cartonella&quot;, who was a fortune telling cow. This character would later become one of Baird&#x27;s most popular characters, even having her own float during the 1974/75 Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parades.

In 1974, Baird married actress Josie Lloyd, 36 years his junior, and they remained together until his death in 1987.

In 1977, Baird temporarily closed down the theater so he could create another show at Busch Gardens: The Old Country titled &quot;Once Upon a Dragon&quot;, which replaced the Sid and Marty Krofft show &quot;The Camelot Revue&quot; and was regularly performed at the Reynold&#x27;s Aluminum Puppet Theater in the Hastings, England section of the park from 1977 to 1978. That show was notable for starting the careers of several other prominent puppeteers. Those performance artists included Martin P. Robinson, who later portrayed &quot;Telly Monster&quot; and &quot;Mr. Snuffleupagus&quot; on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;; Randy Carfagno, who later created the costumes of the Racing Presidents for the Major League Baseball Team, The Washington Nationals; Jonathan Freeman, who voiced the villain &quot;Jafar&quot; in Disney&#x27;s 1992 animated feature film &quot;Aladdin&quot;; and Craig Marin, who after marrying another Baird puppeteer named Olga Felgemacher, formed the company Flexitoon. 

After &quot;Once Upon a Dragon&quot; ended, Baird continued his puppetry work and helped create several characters for commercials such as the &quot;Flavor Fiend&quot; for Bubble Yum, a family of puppets for an ad for the now-defunct Greenwich Savings Bank, a family of dogs and a Goldilocks character for Hartz Flea Tags, a Maid for Drano, Stop-Motion animated Bottles for Desitin Skin Care Lotion and a puppet version of the mascot of RSO Records. Baird and his puppets would soon appear in another special for HBO called &quot;I&#x27;ve Got The World on a String: The First Annual All-Star Puppet Spectacular&quot;, which featured famous singers like Rita Moreno &amp; Ben Vereen.

In 1983, Baird performed a puppet version of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s L&#x27;Histoire du Soldat, which was his last performance before retiring due to severe arthritis.

In 1985, Baird made a brief return in which he performed one of his own plays called &quot;The Dragon and The Dentist&quot;.

==Death==
On March 18, 1987, Baird died at his home in Manhattan at the age of 82 from pneumonia and cancer. Six months after his death, on September 19–20, Baird&#x27;s children Laura and Peter sold nearly all of the remaining Bil Baird Marionettes at auction. The 800-lot sale was held in New York City at The Greenwich Auction Room located at 110 East 13th Street. Bonnie Bien invited a class of young students to a puppet show during the exhibition. Peter Baird and others from the Bil Baird Troupe entertained the children. Bonnie as the gallery public relations expert worked all summer until Rita Rieff who wrote the New York Times Auction picked up Bonnie&#x27;s press release for print.
Marionettes depicting Elsie the Cow and her family were sold to a New York collector. A group of Rockette figures and caricature puppets of U.S. presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman were purchased by a Pennsylvania toy dealer. Another character, &quot;Olly Oilcan&quot; from the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, sold for $11,000 ().

==Awards and legacy==
Baird received many awards and honors during his career, including the Medal of Achievement awarded by the Lotos Club of New York and the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University of Iowa. He was also honored in 1980 by the Union International de la Marionette and Puppeteers of America at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC.

In December 1988 Bil Baird&#x27;s Marionettes played at the Minetta Lane Theatre in New York. The play &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, from the book by Jerome Coopersmith, was produced by Arthur Cantor, and performed by puppeteers Peter B. Baird, Pady Blackwood, Randy Carfagno, Larry Engler, William Tost and Richard Stephen Weber. Mary Rodgers was the composer; Sheldon Harnick wrote the lyrics. (Playbill Vol.88 No.12).

<doc id="1057514" wikidata="Q5540467" url="?curid=1057514" title="George Henry Moore (politician)">
<text>George Henry Moore (1 March 1810 – 19 April 1870) was an Irish politician who, in the 1850s, was a co-founder of the Tenant Right League, of the Catholic Defence Association and, as the Member for Mayo in the United Kingdom Parliament, of the Independent Irish Party. Although an advocate of tenant rights, and renowned for his relief efforts during the Great Famine, at the time of his death in 1870 Moore was defending his rights as a landowner against an oath-bound tenant society, the Ribbonmen. He was the father of the novelist George Augustus Moore and of the Fianna Fáil Senator Maurice George Moore.

==Family==
George Henry Moore was born 1 March 1810 in Moore Hall, Ballyglass, County Mayo, the eldest of three sons born to Louisa Moore (née Browne), granddaughter of John Browne, 1st Earl of Altamont and George Moore (1770–1840), landowner and historian, the son of a wealthy merchant. In the rebellion year of 1798, an uncle, John Moore, was named President of the Government of the province of Connaught in Castlebar by General Humbert during its brief occupation by the French.

The Moores were originally English Protestant gentry but became Catholic when John Moore married a Roman Catholic, Jane Lynch Athy of Galway, and when their son, George, married Katherine de Kilikelly (a.k.a. Kelly), an Irish-Spanish Catholic, in 1765.

==Horse racing gentry==
Moore was educated in England at St Mary&#x27;s Catholic preparatory school in Oscott, near Birmingham, before entering Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1827. Unable as a Catholic to take a degree, he spent most of his time gambling and playing billiards. Sent to London in 1830 to study law, he soon fell heavily into debt from gambling and so was recalled again to attend to the family estate of 12,000 acres.

From 1834 he traveled abroad, visiting Russia, Syria, and Palestine. On his father&#x27;s death in 1840 he was recalled again to Mayo where he established a successful racing stable. After his brother Augustus was killed riding at Aintree in the 1845 English Grand National, and before selling his horses, Moore made one last grand wager. He won £10,000 on his own horse in the 1846 Chester Cup. The winnings he was to deploy, in part, for Irish famine relief.

==Organiser of Famine relief==
During the Great Famine (1845–1852) Mayo was one of the counties worst ravaged by starvation and illness, but none of Moore&#x27;s tenants starved, nor were any evicted—a fact he was to uphold twice in libel cases against &quot;The Times&quot; regarding the treatment of tenants and his character. Moore reduced rents: a full remission for any tenant paying £5 per year and 75% remission for those paying under £10 per annum. Together with the Marquess of Sligo and Sir Robert Lynch-Blosse, from the United States he imported 1,000 tonnes of flour for distribution among tenants at half cost. As the famine got worse Moore gave grazing lands to the people and placed others directly under his care on his own estate at Moore Hall. His estate gradually fell into debt, forcing him during 1854 to sell half his property for £5,900.

==Catholic Defence, and Tenant Right, MP==
Moore ran successfully in Mayo against Irish Repeal candidates in the 1847 general election. On a narrow property franchise he won his seat in Parliament with 504 votes. He tried, and failed, at a Dublin convention to get his fellow Whigs to oppose their leadership at Westminster, the government of Lord John Russell, and protest the laissez-faire approach to the agrarian crisis maintained by Treasury secretary Charles Trevelyan.

In 1851, Moore became chief parliamentary spokesman for the Irish Catholic opposition to the Ecclesiastical Titles Act, an attempt to hamper the restoration in the United Kingdom of the Roman Catholic episcopate. A close friend of Archbishop John MacHale of Tuam, Moore took the leading role in establishing (August 1851) the Catholic Defence Association (CDA). On 28 October 1852, with the support of twenty-six MPs, Moore also established in Dublin the short-lived Friends of Religious Freedom and Equality to call for the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland.

At the same time, Moore cooperated with the Young Irelander Charles Gavan Duffy, editor of &quot;The Nation&quot;, in uniting southern, overwhelmingly Catholic, tenant protection societies with northern, largely Presbyterian, tenant-right associations in an all-Ireland Tenant Right League. In the 1852 general election, Moore was one of 48 MPs returned with the League&#x27;s endorsement. At his insistence, and by prior agreement, they sat as the Independent Irish Party, pledged to support no government that did not both advance tenant rights and revoke the Ecclesiastical Titles Act. Combined with the presence among of many sitting Repeal MPs, the joining of the two platforms assisted the Irish Conservatives and their Orange Order auxiliaries in painting disloyalty to landlords as disloyalty to the Protestant Crown and to the Union. Only one tenant-right MP was returned from Ulster: William Kirk in Newry.

Within six months two of Moore&#x27;s colleagues William Keogh and John Sadleir broke ranks. Finding that, with a number of other CDA members, they held the balance of power in the House of Commons, they voted for, and accepted offices in, a new Whig-Peelite ministry in return for a commitment on the church question alone. With Duffy and Frederick Lucas, editor of the liberal Catholic journal &quot;The Tablet&quot;, Moore helped rouse popular indignation, but was opposed by the Roman Catholic Primate, Archbishop Paul Cullen. Moore continued to put pressure on MPs to adopt the independent opposition policy by using the influence of the Tenant League, of which he was chairman during 1856. During the late 1850s he also made repeated unsuccessful attempts to persuade the Young Ireland veteran William Smith O&#x27;Brien to re-enter Irish politics and lead the independent party.

In Archbishop Hale and in the local clergy Moore had sufficient clerical support for it to be made an issue in his re-election to Parliament in 1857. Invoking the new Corrupt Practices Act (1854), his Ascendancy opponents persuaded the House of Commons &quot;that Mr. Moore&#x27;s election had been carried mainly, if not entirely, by the influence of the Roman Catholic priesthood—not the influence of advice, or suggestion, or even of persuasion, but the influence of spiritual intimidation in its most marked and obtrusive form&quot;, including &quot;a most unseemly electioneering mandate, signed by &quot;John Archbishop of Tuam,&quot; and three Roman Catholic Bishops&quot;. He was denied his seat, and replaced in bye-election, unopposed, by Lord John Browne. (Moore was one of nine Irish MPs to be unseated on ground of undue clerical influence between 1853 and 1892).

Moore refused to back Cullen&#x27;s preferred alternative to the independent opposition, the National Association of Ireland (established 29 December 1864). Instead, with the encouragement of Archbishop MacHale, in 1868 Moore stood again for parliament in Mayo as a Liberal on a platform of tenant right and amnesty for Fenian prisoners. Although he had himself, according to John Devoy, been denied entry into the Irish Republican Brotherhood by James Stephens in 1864, he began conferring regularly with some IRB leaders. In common with John O&#x27;Connor Power and other more moderate republicans, Moore apparently desired some form of alliance between the Fenians and tenant-right MPs, with a view to forming a new political movement.

==Targeted landlord==
Moore died on 19 April 1870, at Moore Hall. He had left his family in London just four days before. In a later biography, his son Maurice revealed that what had brought his father home was not, as reported in the papers at the time, the need to consult local leaders before he introduced a Home Rule bill. Rather, it was the attention Moore and his tenants were receiving from local Ribbonmen.

A few months before his journey back to Ireland, Moore had been forwarded a copy of a note red ink that was being circulated to tenants on the outlying Ballintubber estate of his 12,481 acre property: &quot;IMPORTANT. Notice is hereby given that any person who pays rents to landlords, agents, or bailiffs above that of ordnance valuation will at his peril mark the consequences. By order, Rory &quot;.

Moore was incensed that his public commitment to agrarian reform should count for so little. Shortly before leaving London, in a debate on the second reading of Gladstone&#x27;s Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, Moore had protested that its concessions to the Three Fs (Fair rent, Fixity of tenure, and Free sale) did not go far enough to check the power of landlords to drive out tenants (old and sick) through remorseless rent increases. In Mayo, during and after the famine, many landlords had made a complete clearance of their tenants and turned their holdings into grazing farms.

Moore concluded the Ballintubber Ribbonmen were simply out to blackmail him. He wrote to the local priest, a fellow protégé of MacHale&#x27;s, Father Patrick Lavelle declaring that just because as an MP he advocated the rights of tenants did not mean he was going to surrender his rights as a landlord. Those who count upon taking base advantage of his political position &quot;will find that they have mistaken their man&quot;. He would not be intimidated and he would evict every tenant who did not pay rent. It would be an act of charity to the poor, Moore wrote, if Father Lavelle would intervene.

== Death ==
As soon as the Easter parliamentary recess began, Moore made his last return to Ireland, arriving on Good Friday, 1870. On Sunday, he attended Easter Mass at the local church in Carnacon. But on Monday, ill, he retired to his bed. He died the following afternoon of a stroke. Father Lavelle administered last rites.

In 1851 Moore had married Mary, daughter of Maurice Blake, a landlord with property in counties Mayo and Galway. They had five children. These included the future writer George Augustus Moore and the future Fianna Fáil Senator, Maurice George Moore. Maurice&#x27;s support for the Irish Free State prompted the anti-Treaty IRA to burn down the family&#x27;s ancestral home, Moore Hall during the Irish Civil War in 1923.

<text>Péter Nádas (born 14 October 1942) is a Hungarian writer, playwright, and essayist.

== Biography ==

He was born in Budapest into a Jewish family, the son of László Nádas (originally Nussbaum) and Klára Tauber. After the takeover of the Hungarian Nazis, the Arrow Cross Party on 15 October 1944, Klára Tauber escaped with her son to Bačka and Novi Sad, but returned to the capital directly before the Siege of Budapest. Péter Nádas survived the siege together with his mother in the flat of his uncle, the journalist Pál Aranyossi.

Even though his parents were illegal Communists during World War II and involved with the Communist administration later on, as well, they had both their sons—Péter and Pál—baptized in the Reformed (Calvinist) Church of Pozsonyi Street. His mother died of an illness when he was 13. In 1958, his father—head of department in one of the ministries, slandered with accusations of embezzlement, then exonerated by the court of all charges—committed suicide; Péter Nádas became an orphan at 16. Magda Aranyossi became the guardian of the two children.

Between 1961 and 1963 Péter Nádas studied journalism and photography. He worked as a journalist at a Budapest magazine (Pest Megyei Hírlap) from 1965 to 1969. He also worked as a playwright and a photographer. Since 1969 he has been a freelancer.

In 1990 he married Magda Salamon (with whom he had been living since 1962). In 1984 they moved to a small village in western Hungary, Gombosszeg, where they have resided ever since, though he also has a residence in the Castle District of Buda.

In 1993, he was elected member of the Széchenyi Academy of Literature and Arts.

Since the early 1970s, he has frequently spent time in Berlin, Germany, attending lectures at Humboldt University or reading in the Staatsbibliothek. He has been a fellow of the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin, Institute for Advanced Study. In 2006, he was elected a member of the Akademie der Künste, Berlin. He enjoys a high reputation in Germany.

== Works ==

After publishing volumes of short stories, he published his first novel &quot;The End of a Family Story&quot; in 1977.

He published his second novel, &quot;A Book of Memories&quot; in 1986. It took Nádas twelve years to write this book. The epigraph of this novel is from the Gospel according to John: &quot;But he spoke of the temple of his body&quot; (John, 2.21). In this novel, Nádas describes the world as a system of relations linking human bodies to each other. This book earned Nádas comparisons to Proust.

He published his latest novel, the three-volume &quot;Parallel Stories&quot; (I: &quot;The Mute Realm&quot;, II: &quot;In the Very Depth of the Night&quot;, III: &quot;The Breath of Freedom&quot;) in 2005. This novel is a multitude of independent stories that melt into one single narrative. It took Nádas eighteen years to complete this book. The novel has been described as &quot;a virtuoso combination of nineteenth-century high realism with the experimentalism of the nouveau roman&quot;, while &quot;the real narrative is that of bodies&#x27; actions on one another, their attraction and desires, their mutual memories&quot; (Gábor Csordás). The plot is constructed around the histories of two families: one—the Lippay-Lehrs, who are Hungarian, the other—the Döhrings, who are German. These two main threads link irregularly up to one another via specific events or figures.

Nádas&#x27; other novels include &quot;Lovely Tale of Photography&quot;, &quot;Yearbook&quot;, &quot;On Heavenly and Earthly Love&quot;, and &quot;A Dialogue with Richard Swartz&quot;. Death is a recurrent theme in Nádas&#x27; work, particularly in &quot;Own Death&quot;, based on his experience of clinical death.

His writing has been described as intellectual, detailed, strong, innovative, and demanding. He is the winner of the Würth-Preis für Europäische Literatur in 2014. A volume of interviews with Péter Nádas, by Zsófia Mihancsik (&quot;Nincs mennyezet, nincs födém&quot;) was published in 2006.

<doc id="1057521" wikidata="Q780899" url="?curid=1057521" title="Francis William Newman">
<text>Francis William Newman (27 June 1805 – 4 October 1897) was an English classical scholar and moral philosopher, prolific miscellaneous writer and activist for vegetarianism and other causes.

He was the younger brother of John Henry Newman. Thomas Carlyle in his life of John Sterling called him a &quot;man of fine attainments, of the sharpest-cutting and most restlessly advancing intellect and of the mildest pious enthusiasm.&quot; George Eliot called him &quot;our blessed St. Francis&quot; and his soul &quot;a blessed &quot;yea&quot;&quot;.

==Early life==
Newman was born in London, the third son of John Newman, a banker, and his wife Jemima Fourdrinier, sister of Henry Fourdrinier. With his brother John Henry, he was educated at Ealing School. He matriculated at Worcester College, Oxford in 1822, where he obtained a double first class and graduated B.A. in 1826. He was elected fellow of Balliol College in the same year.

During his undergraduate days, his father&#x27;s bank having failed, he was able to complete his degree by relying on financial support from his older brother John Henry. Early in his student period, however, lodging as he did with his brother, he disagreed enough on established religion to feel, at least as he expressed it in a late autobiographical work, that there was a breach in their relationship. He never graduated M.A., normally at Oxford a pure formality, since he shortly acquired religious scruples about signing as required the 39 Articles.

In 1827, Newman went to Delgany, County Wicklow, where for a year he tutored the sons of Edward Pennefather, There he fell under the influence of Pennefather&#x27;s brother-in-law, the Rev John Nelson Darby, one of the nascent group of Plymouth Brethren, who he describes in &quot;Phases of Faith&quot; as &quot;the Irish Clergyman&quot;.

Conscientious scruples respecting the ceremony of infant baptism then led him to resign his fellowship in 1830.

==Missionary==
Newman then took another position, in the family of Henry Parnell, 4th Baronet Parnell. An obituary of Edward Cronin, a Catholic convert widowed in 1829, suggests a Bible study group as origin of the sequel. Newman had recently been rejected by Maria Rosina Giberne, whom he had been courting for seven years, and had been helping his brother with parish work at Littlemore.

Shortly, in September 1830, Newman left Ireland with a party bound for Baghdad. They intended to join the independent faith mission of Anthony Norris Groves, who was working there with John Kitto and Karl Gottlieb Pfander. The party included John Vesey Parnell, who was its financial backer with John Gifford Bellett, Edward Cronin, and others. The journey, guided by the early views of Darby, ended badly. Newman&#x27;s letters written home during the period of his mission were collected and published in 1856. There are other accounts, by the Brethren historian William Blair Neatby, and by Henry Groves, son of Anthony Norris Groves.

In 1833, Newman returned to England, via Tehran, with Kitto, arriving in June. He intended to find additional support for the mission: but rumours of unsoundness in his views on the doctrine of eternal punishment had preceded him.

==Academic==
Finding himself looked upon with suspicion by erstwhile evangelical colleagues, including Darby, Newman gave up on his vocation of missionary. He became classical tutor at the non-sectarian Bristol College, which existed 1831–1841 at Park Row, Bristol.

In 1840 he became classics professor at Manchester New College, the dissenters&#x27; college lately returned from York, at the time linked to London University. In 1846 he moved to become a professor of Latin at University College, London, where he remained until 1869.

In 1856 Newman produced a translation of the &quot;Iliad&quot; which was heavily criticised by the poet and literary critic Matthew Arnold, which led to a bitter quarrel between the two in 1860 and resulted in Arnold&#x27;s series of essays on translation, &quot;On Translating Homer&quot;.

==Views==
Newman once described himself as &quot;anti-everything&quot;. Wilfrid Meynell commented that Newman was as a &quot;deist, vegetarian, anti-vaccinationist, to whom a monastery is even as a madhouse.&quot; Literary critic Lionel Trilling described Newman as a &quot;militant vegetarian, an intransigent anti-vivisectionist, an enthusiastic anti-vaccinationist.&quot;

&quot;The perfection of the soul, he said, lay in its becoming &quot;woman&quot;. He believed in woman&#x27;s right to vote, to educate herself and to ride astride&quot;. He sought to make life rational in all things, including clothing. He wore an alpaca tailcoat in summer, three coats in winter (the outer one green), and in bad weather, he wore a rug with a hole cut for his head. When it was muddy, he wore trousers edged with six inches of leather.

===Christian and secularist belief===
As a young man, Newman was a fervent evangelical, associating with Walter Mayers and Thomas Byrth. At Oxford he was acquainted with radical Calvinist evangelicals, such as the circle around John Hill (1786–1855) of St Edmund Hall. In 1827 he encountered Benjamin Wills Newton of Exeter College, a future Plymouth Brethren founder, and Joseph Charles Philpot of his own college, who was his predecessor in the Pennefeather household in Dublin, much impressed by Darby.

Newman returned from Baghdad in 1833 a deist. He remained throughout life a believer in a theism, which has been described as &quot;versatile&quot;. He had a believer&#x27;s baptism in 1836 at Broadmead Chapel. He often attended both Unitarian and Baptist religious services, but was agnostic on many aspects of Christian doctrine.

In London of the 1840s Newman associated with the radical group comprising also William Henry Ashurst, William James Linton, William Shaen, James Stansfeld, Peter Alfred Taylor, mixing Unitarians and freethinkers. Harriet Martineau wrote to William Johnson Fox in 1849 about the &quot;religious state of the world&quot;, saying &quot;I am in the midst of the F Newman set of friends&quot;, mentioning also Bonamy Price&#x27;s praise for Newman.

The liberal theological movement to which Newman belonged was hailed by George Jacob Holyoake, founder of British secularism. It equally received heavy criticism. The Anglican &quot;Clerical Journal&quot;, edited by Henry Burgess, wrote in 1854 of the &quot;openly destructive volumes&quot; of Newman and Theodore Parker. In that year, Newman published &quot;Catholic Union: Essays Towards a Church of the Future, as the Organization of Philanthropy&quot;.

===Journalism and controversy===
Newman wrote, anonymously, a favorable review of &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot; for the first issue in 1845 of the &quot;Prospective Review&quot;, a journal edited by James Martineau, John Hamilton Thom and two other Unitarian ministers in the north of England. The content is considered to reflect the influence on Newman at this time of Baden Powell, in the area of science and religion.

With Martineau and others such as James Anthony Froude and Edward Lombe, he was one of the unorthodox but &quot;respectable&quot; backers when John Chapman took over the radical &quot;Westminster Review&quot; in 1851. The embattled Newman was a figure of controversy, particularly with Henry Rogers and his &quot;The Eclipse of Faith, or, A Visit to a Religious Sceptic&quot; of 1852, to which Newman replied. He was supported in the &quot;Westminster Review&quot; by a sympathetic article of 1858, &quot;F. W. Newman and his Evangelical Critics&quot;, by Wathen Mark Wilks Call, that classed him as an &quot;honest doubter&quot;. Considering the reception of ten books by Newman from the 1850s, Call (writing anonymously) concluded that many of his opponents &quot;failed in candour, courtesy, generosity, and conscientiousness.&quot;

Newman himself published in the &quot;Westminster Review&quot; the provocative &quot;Religious Weaknesses of Protestantism&quot; in 1859. Circulation dropped, but Edward Henry Stanley stepped up with financial support. One of those offended was Henry Bristow Wilson, who thought it anti-Christian. He was one of the seven authors of &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot; (1860), which argued for a different version of liberal theology; among the other authors, Baden Powell was clearly influenced by Newman&#x27;s views, while there is evidence that Mark Pattison took &quot;Phases of Faith&quot; to heart.

Returning to the topic at book length, Newman published &quot;The Religious Weakness of Protestantism&quot; in 1866. He was slow to drop the &quot;sola scriptura&quot; doctrine of Darby. Over time he developed arguments against it, under the headings of Bibliolatry and bigotry.

He went on to contribute 11 articles in the early 1870s to &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, edited by Froude.

===Social purity movement===
Newman was both a supporter of a radical individualism and opponent of a centralised state; and an ethicist who opposed free love, and was concerned with urban libertinism and prostitution. In 1869 he became involved in the opposition to the Contagious Diseases Acts. In 1873 he stood his ground, while chairing a meeting against the Acts in Weston-super-Mare, confronting disruptive protesters.

In his lectures of the 1850s on political economy, Newman had commented on the &quot;population doctrine&quot; of Thomas Malthus. While he did not contest it in the abstract, in his view, the practical applications of the doctrine had been &quot;deplorably and perniciously false.&quot;

An opponent of birth control, Newman put a case that sexual excess was a danger to women&#x27;s health. The Moral Reform Union, launched in 1881 and commended by &quot;The Englishwoman&#x27;s Review&quot;, published Newman&#x27;s book 1889 book &quot;The Corruption Now Called Neo-Malthusianism&quot;.

===Vegetarianism===
Newman joined the Vegetarian Society in 1868, and was President of the Society from 1873 to 1884. He was opposed to the dogmatic ideas of raw foodism and objected to the disuse of flavourings and salt. He commented that &quot;the number of dogmatic prohibitions against everything that makes food palatable will soon ruin our society if not firmly resisted.&quot; In 1877, Newman criticized a raw food book of Gustav Schlickeysen.

He made an associate membership possible for people who were not completely vegetarian, such as those who ate chicken or fish. From 1875 to 1896, membership for the Vegetarian Society was 2,159 and associate membership 1,785.

Newman did not like the term &quot;vegetarian&quot; because it implied someone who ate only vegetables. Instead, he preferred the Greek term &quot;anti-creophagite&quot; or &quot;anti-creophagist&quot; (anti-flesh eater). This idea was not supported by other members of the Society, as few people knew what the term meant. He used the phrase &quot;V E M&quot; diet (vegetables, eggs, milk). Newman consumed dairy and eggs. In 1884, a hostile review of his book &quot;Essays on Diet&quot; commented that he &quot;is no vegetarian himself in the strict acceptation of the word, for he takes milk, eggs, butter, and cheese.&quot; Newman believed that abstinence from meat, fish and fowl should be the only thing the Vegetarian Society advocates. Some members believed that Newman was not strict enough. However, under Newman&#x27;s presidency the Society flourished as income, associates and membership numbers increased.

In the 1890s, Newman converted to a pescetarian diet, and consumed white fish.

===Vaccination===
Newman was an anti-vaccinationist and supported the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League. He carried over arguments, against following the advice of a &quot;medical clique&quot;, that he had used against the Contagious Diseases Acts. In 1869, an article in &quot;The Lancet&quot; journal criticized Newman for holding this opinion and tried to convince him to withdraw his support for the League.

One of Newman&#x27;s opponents in the vaccination controversy was Henry Alleyne Nicholson (Harry), whom he had tutored, and the son of his good friend John Nicholson. He declined to answer Henry&#x27;s pamphlet.

===Land reform===
*&quot;The Land as National Property: With Special View to the Scheme of Reclaiming it for the Nation Proposed by Alfred Russel Wallace&quot; (1886)

Newman was quoted by James Platt as stating that &quot;the ownership of land is a monstrous despotism&quot;.

During the 1870s, Newman supported Matthew Vincent&#x27;s scheme for acquiring land to provide smallholdings for agricultural labourers.

==Family==
Newman was married twice, firstly on 23 December 1835 to Maria Kennaway (died 1876). She was the second daughter of Sir John Kennaway, 1st Baronet, and a Plymouth Sister. They had met at Escot House in 1834. Francis&#x27;s mother Jemima was at the end of her life — she died in spring 1836 — but welcomed Maria to the Newman family home. John Henry Newman found that unacceptable. By 1840 the brothers were more reconciled, at least in correspondence.

Maria&#x27;s sister Frances married Edward Cronin in 1838.

The couple had no children. Under the will of John Sterling (died 1844), Francis became guardian of his orphaned son Edward Conyngham Sterling. Edward (Teddy) went to live with the Newmans in Manchester; for a while his younger brother, John Barton Sterling was there also − their sisters went to their uncle Anthony Coningham Sterling. Edward Sterling was an artist, and married in 1868 Bertha Stone, a suffragist, daughter of Frank Stone. Born in 1831 on Munro Plantation, St Vincent, he died in 1877. He had a house built in Sheffield Terrace, London, in 1876, by Alfred Waterhouse.

Secondly, Newman married Eleanor Williams on 3 December 1878.

== Death ==
After his retirement from University College, Newman continued to live for some years in London, subsequently moving to Clifton, and eventually to Weston-super-Mare, where he died in 1897. He had been blind for five years before his death, but retained his faculties to the last.

Newman&#x27;s funeral address was given by John Temperley Grey. It contained the comment that he was &quot;a saint in the very thick of life&#x27;s battle.&quot;

==Legacy==

Newman is listed on the south face of The Reformers&#x27; Memorial in Kensal Green Cemetery in London.

<text>Genesis is the twelfth studio album by English rock band Genesis, released on 3 October 1983 by Charisma and Virgin Records in the UK and by Atlantic Records in the US and Canada. Following the band&#x27;s tour in support of their 1982 live album &quot;Three Sides Live&quot;, Genesis took an eight-month break before they regrouped in the spring of 1983 to record a new album. It is their first written and recorded in its entirety at their studio named The Farm in Chiddingfold, Surrey, and the songs were developed through jam sessions in the studio with nothing written beforehand. Hugh Padgham returned as their engineer.

&quot;Genesis&quot; was the group&#x27;s greatest commercial success at the time of release, becoming the band&#x27;s third straight album to reach on the UK Albums Chart. It also reached No. 9 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it sold over 4 million copies. Five singles were released between 1983 and 1984; &quot;Mama&quot; was the lead single and remains the highest charting Genesis single in the UK, reaching . While &quot;Mama&quot; stalled on the US charts, follow-up single &quot;That&#x27;s All&quot; reached there and became the band&#x27;s first US top 10 hit. The band toured the album in 1983 and 1984, recordings from which formed the concert video &quot;Genesis Live: The Mama Tour&quot;. In 1985, the album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and &quot;Second Home by the Sea&quot; was nominated for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In 2007, the album was re-released with new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes.

In October 1982, the Genesis line-up of drummer/singer Phil Collins, keyboardist Tony Banks, and guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford, with live drummer Chester Thompson and live guitarist Daryl Stuermer, wrapped their two-month tour of North America and Europe in support of the band&#x27;s third live album, &quot;Three Sides Live&quot;. They had also performed a one-off gig titled Six of the Best with original Genesis frontman and singer Peter Gabriel and former guitarist Steve Hackett to raise funds for Gabriel&#x27;s world music festival WOMAD after it ran into financial trouble. Genesis then entered a period of inactivity, during which the band pursued their solo projects.

== Writing and recording ==
In the spring of 1983, the band reconvened at their studio, named The Farm in Chiddingfold, Surrey, to start work on a new studio album, their first since &quot;Abacab&quot; (1981). &quot;Genesis&quot; became their first album written, recorded, and mixed in its entirety at the studio room; previously they had to write in an adjoining space. Having the group work in their own space without the additional pressure of booking studio time and fees resulted in a more relaxed environment. They were joined by engineer Hugh Padgham, who had also worked on &quot;Abacab&quot;, but this time carried out production duties themselves with Geoff Callingham offering technical assistance. Rutherford recalled an initial period of slow and sluggish progress, but after a particularly productive session on the third day they had &quot;two or three&quot; songs worked out, which increased their interest and excitement towards the album and in performing the new material on stage. Before the sessions began, the group considered the idea of Banks or Rutherford taking on a lead vocal on the album, but opted out as they had developed material with Collins&#x27;s voice in mind. Banks said that he and Rutherford take a more prominent role in the backing vocals on &quot;Genesis&quot; than previous albums.

Banks explained the album was the result of the group&#x27;s decision to &quot;write an album and record it in one go, from start to finish&quot;. The group considered their strongest material had been put together collectively, so they decided to make an entire album in such a way as opposed to developing someone&#x27;s pre-arranged ideas. Before, each member would contribute fully or partially arranged songs, which restricted development or suggestions from the other members. This time tracks came about through jamming and improvisations in the studio that were recorded onto tape, ensuring the band remained unified and kept songs fresh. Banks noted that this made recording more exciting and spontaneous. This collaborative effort marked a return for Genesis crediting each member for writing the album as opposed to listing individual credits, which they had not done since &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; (1974). The collaborative effort also had an influence on the album&#x27;s title as the group were unable to come up with a suitable name, so they used &quot;Genesis&quot; to emphasise the fact that it was written collectively.

The main keyboards that Banks used on the album are the Prophet 10, Synclavier, an E-mu Emulator, a Yamaha CP-70 electric grand piano, and an ARP Quadra on &quot;Mama&quot;. At one point on the album, a sample from the soundtrack to &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) is used. Collins said: &quot;You play a chord and a half of it&#x27;s going at half the speed and part at twice the speed, sounds beautiful.&quot; Collins plays on a Simmons electronic drum kit.

== Songs ==
&quot;Genesis&quot; displays the group moving towards shorter, more straightforward, and radio friendly songs. Rutherford said that the band had gone as far as they could with their progressive and art rock direction that they had adopted since the early 1970s and wanted to write and record in a more relaxed approach as previously, the band were more driven to present what they had to offer. Banks considered the music, and overall sound of &quot;Genesis&quot;, something that the band had longed for many years prior, specifically its more aggressive edge. He described side one as the &quot;main act&quot;, while side two has the &quot;character pieces&quot;.

=== &quot;Mama&quot; ===

&quot;Mama&quot; originated during a group jam session where Rutherford was experimenting with a Linn LM-1 electronic drum machine fed through a gated reverb and a Mesa Boogie amplifier, and &quot;turned up incredibly loud&quot; to the point of amplifiers jumping off the studio floor. Collins was influenced to go for a vocal that resembled John Lennon&#x27;s style on his cover of &quot;Be-Bop-a-Lula&quot; on the song&#x27;s verses. His laugh was influenced by the 1982 song &quot;The Message&quot; by hip hop band Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, which features a similar sound. Padgham had brought the single to the band and upon hearing it, Collins did the laugh during the subsequent improvisation session for &quot;Mama&quot;, which the band liked and wished to use in the song. The group had doubts as to whether Collins could recreate the laugh on stage, but he had no problems.

When it came to picking a song as the album&#x27;s lead single, Rutherford expected Genesis manager Tony Smith and record label staff to pick another track than &quot;Mama&quot;, but said &quot;full marks to them, they agreed we should go with something that was a bit different&quot;. Rutherford later rated &quot;Mama&quot; as one of the best songs on the album, and was pleased with its commercial performance after the band found singles chart success with a song that represented what Genesis &quot;were all about&quot; at the time. During one session, the band had a koto in the studio, which was recorded through the E-mu Emulator and used as a sample for the song&#x27;s percussion effect, partly because Banks had tried other options and could not get another sound to fit.

=== Other songs ===
&quot;That&#x27;s All&quot; originated from Banks&#x27;s simple piano riff, which was followed by a drum pattern that instantly gave off a mood that the band wanted to develop further. Each member cited the Beatles as an influence for the song; Collins said his drumming was in tribute to the style of their drummer, Ringo Starr, one of his drumming influences. The organ solo is played using a preset on the Synclavier imitating a Hammond B-3 organ, despite the reverse seen in the song&#x27;s music video.

&quot;Home by the Sea&quot; tells the story of a burglar who breaks into a house only to find it is haunted by ghosts, who capture him and then force him to listen to their life stories. Collins had repeated the phrase &quot;home by the sea&quot; while putting down dummy vocals at a time when Banks was writing lyrical ideas, and used the phrase to conjure up the story. The song originated with the band playing along to their Linn drum machine, during which Banks and Rutherford devised a guide theme on the keyboard and guitar, respectively, and Collins a vocal outline. With the guide parts laid out, the band then had a format as to its mood and how the song would take shape and developed it into a complete track. When the three were happy with what came out from it, they re-recorded the song individually onto tape with Collins replacing the Linn drum tracks with his own.

The former track segues into &quot;Second Home by the Sea&quot;, a mostly instrumental piece developed from a group improvisation that began with Collins playing a drum riff which Banks and Rutherford liked and joined in. The working title was &quot;Heavy Simmonds&quot;, a reference to Collins&#x27; playing. Banks said the group spent around two hours jamming on the idea on one day, followed by a second jam of equal length on the next. They then took the parts from both jams they liked best and organised them into one cohesive arrangement, which required them to re-learn what they had put down to record it as one piece. Banks said the loose idea behind the instrumental section was to represent the former lives of the ghosts. The track ends with a reprise of &quot;Home by the Sea&quot;.
&quot;Illegal Alien&quot;, with lyrics from Rutherford, is about illegal immigrants and their attempts to cross the border into the United States for a better life. Collins aimed for a more adventurous style of drumming and went through a number of different styles, noting what he ended up playing was perhaps more than what the song called for. The chosen style was &quot;that basic rock-and-roll part-two and four on the snare, one and three on the bass. That&#x27;s what made the tune work&quot;. It opens with sound effects of car horns and telephones that Banks played on his E-mu Emulator sampler, which he found particularly exciting to record and incorporate into the music. Collins felt more pleased with his drumming on &quot;Mama&quot; and &quot;Illegal Alien&quot; than on the band&#x27;s more intricate tracks such as &quot;Los Endos&quot; from &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot;. Banks denied any racist implications the song appeared to have towards Mexicans, but said &quot;it is a tongue-in-cheek thing&quot; and in fact more sympathetic towards immigrants.

&quot;Silver Rainbow&quot; has lyrics written by Banks, who wrote about people being senseless when they are in love. Collins described them as &quot;romantic&quot; and &quot;lush&quot;. Its working title was &quot;Adam&quot; because it had a rhythm that the group felt resembled something by singer Adam Ant, and the band thought a lyric that matched the &quot;juvenile&quot; music would fit it best.

&quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Get Better&quot; features a keyboard introduction that Banks sampled from an album of classical music for cello, following a failed attempt to use it to obtain a quality string sound on his keyboard. He then played four notes simultaneously using the same sample that unexpectedly created a sound of interweaving harmonies, which he kept and used.

== Cover art ==
The cover art was designed by English artist Bill Smith, who had also produced the artwork on &quot;Abacab&quot; (1981). The front photograph originates from shapes from his one-year-old son&#x27;s shape sorter toy that were left on the carpet after he had gone to bed.

== Release ==
&quot;Genesis&quot; was released on 3 October 1983 and distributed by Charisma and Virgin Records in the United Kingdom and by Atlantic Records in the United States. It reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart for one week from 15 October 1983 during a 51-week stay on the chart, and re-entered the chart for a total of 15 weeks between 1984 and 1987. The album peaked at No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 during a 49-week stay. In the United Kingdom, the album reached Gold certification by the British Phonographic Industry on the day of release for shipment of 200,000 copies. In December 1983, the album reached Platinum certification and, in October 1987 reached double Platinum, the latter for selling 600,000 copies.

Four singles from the album were released between August 1983 and June 1984. A 12-inch single was released with longer versions of &quot;Mama&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Get Better&quot;, the edit for the latter containing an extra verse and chorus.

Genesis filmed promotional music videos for &quot;Mama&quot; and &quot;Illegal Alien&quot;, both of which were filmed back to back on the same film set.

== Critical reception ==

In his feature article on the band and the album in a September 1983 edition of &quot;Sounds&quot;, writer Bill Black described &quot;Genesis&quot; as &quot;an at times frustrating cocktail of the sassy songwriting&quot; that Collins&#x27; solo albums apparently brought into the band&#x27;s songs, &quot;spiced with tantalizing reminders&quot; of the band&#x27;s more progressive and art rock past. He was critical of &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Get Better&quot;, summarising it as &quot;pure formula&quot; and compared its backtracked keyboard sound to &quot;cosmic Elgar&quot;, but rated &quot;Mama&quot; as &quot;savage as you&#x27;re likely to get with post Gabriel Genesis&quot; and a notable departure from their earlier songs. The &quot;Kerrang!&quot; reviewer determined that for this album Genesis &quot;have traded technical complexity and ingenuity for an altogether more stunning simplicity&quot;, making &quot;a Genesis album for people who normally hate Genesis&quot; and &quot;great music for the masses&quot;.

In his retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine criticised the album for lacking coherency, but found that a majority of the tracks are outstanding, &quot;balancing such sleek, pulsating pop tunes as &#x27;That&#x27;s All&#x27; with a newfound touch for aching ballads.&quot; He also praised the band completely redefining themselves as a pop group.

In 1985 the album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal while &quot;Second Home by the Sea&quot; was nominated for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.

Mike Rutherford referred to this album as one of his favourite Genesis albums.

<text>Lower Upnor and Upper Upnor are two small villages in Medway, Kent, England. They are in the parish of Frindsbury Extra on the western bank of the River Medway. Today the two villages are mainly residential and a centre for small craft moored on the river, but Upnor Castle is a preserved monument, part of the river defences from the sixteenth century.

==Origins==
Upnor meant &quot;at the bank&quot; being &quot;æt þæm ōre&quot; in Old English and &quot;atten ore&quot; in Middle English and &quot;atte Nore&quot; in 1292. However, the meaning changed to &quot;upon the bank&quot; (Middle English: &quot;uppan ore&quot;) and by 1374 it was &quot;Upnore&quot;.

A skeleton of a straight-tusked elephant was excavated in 1911, during the construction of the Royal Engineers&#x27; Upnor Hard.

==Lower Upnor==

Lower Upnor faces the Upnor Reach of the River Medway. It was a single row of houses, separated from the river by the roadway and the hard. Located here is the Arethusa training centre, which provides residential school trips and educational visits and is run by the Shaftesbury Homes and Arethusa. In 1849, HMS &quot;Arethusa&quot; was the name of the training ship moored near the shore. The society had moored a training ship here for over 105 years. The first was &quot;Chichester&quot;, but after then all the ships were called &quot;Arethusa&quot;. The last but one &quot;Arethusa&quot; was the &quot;Peking&quot;, one of the R.F Laeisz&#x27;s Flying P-Liner four-masted barques, built in 1911, and acquired after 1918 as war reparations. She was sold in 1975 to the South Street Seaport Museum in New York. The last &quot;Arethusa&quot;, a 23-metre two-masted ketch, was sold in 2000 and now sails with the Cirdan Sailing Trust under the name &quot;Faramir&quot;.

In recent times extra housing has been built behind this street, exploiting the land exposed by quarrying the steep hillside that leads to Hoo Common.

Lower Upnor is also the home of two yacht/sailing clubs. Medway Yacht Club, which was founded in 1880, purchased land in Lower Upnor in 1948, now comprising approximately . Upnor Sailing Club was formed in the 1962 and moved into its present club house (formed from renovating three existing traditional riverfront cottages) in the 1980s.

==Upper Upnor==
Upper Upnor comprises a village cobbled high street leading down to Upnor Castle. It has many houses displaying Kentish weatherboarding, some are Grade II listed.

It also has some terraced streets including former military housing. Upper Upnor is on the Chatham Reach of the River Medway, directly opposite St Mary&#x27;s Creek.

==London Stones==

The London Stones are in Lower Upnor on the shoreline. They mark the limit of the charter rights of London fishermen. The older stone has the date 1204 carved on it as part of an eighteenth-century inscription.

==Industry==
Like other parts of Frindsbury, chalk has been extracted, high quality moulding sand has been taken from a pit near the Church, and William Burgess Little built 25 five barges at his yard between 1843 and 1871. The first was the Sarah Little and the last called W.B.Little Finish. James Little built three barges here in 1891, 1893, and 1895. A potter&#x27;s kiln can be seen on an 1830 watercolour by Susan Twopeny, now in Rochester Guildhall Museum.

==Church==
The ecclesiastical parish of Upnor split from Frindsbury in 1884 and was reabsorbed in 1955. The parish church of St Philip and St James (1884) was designed by Ewan Christian. It is virtually unaltered.

==Military==
===Upnor Castle===

Upnor Castle was built as an artillery fort between 1559 and 1567 in order to protect Chatham Dockyard and the associated naval anchorage. It was called into action in June 1667 when the Dutch Navy conducted a raid on the ships moored in the river; the castle proved ineffective in repelling the attack and it was decommissioned soon afterwards. Though the castle was only operational as a fort for about 100 years, it was retained as a gunpowder magazine and ammunition store until the end of the First World War; continuing in military use through World War II, it was opened to the public as a museum in 1945.

===Lower Upnor ordnance depot===

Upnor Castle served as a gunpowder magazine for the Board of Ordnance from 1668, providing powder for the defences of Chatham Dockyard and for the fleet based in the Nore. In 1810 a new magazine with space for 10,000 barrels of gunpowder was built downriver from the castle (which had long needed to expand its capacity) along with a &#x27;shifting house&#x27; for inspecting powder that had arrived by sea (though demolished, its surrounding earth traverse is still in evidence, midway between the magazine and the castle).

In 1856 a second magazine was constructed alongside the first, to the same design but with more than double the capacity; (this still stands on the river bank, the earlier magazine having been demolished in 1964). At the same time, buildings were constructed (alongside the shifting house) for storing and maintaining artillery shells; but these soon proved too small, so the site began to be extended to the north, where additional shell stores were built from the 1860s onwards. A little further to the north, a group of large houses were bought to serve as offices for the depot. There was not enough space, though, for further bulk storage of gunpowder, so in 1875 a separate set of five magazines were built, inland at Chattenden, and linked to Upnor by a narrow-gauge railway &quot;(see below)&quot;; the Upnor magazines were then converted into filled shell stores.

In 1891 Britain&#x27;s Ordnance Yards were split between the Admiralty and the War Department, Upnor going to the former, Chattenden to the latter. The Admiralty therefore embarked on building a new inland depot, next to Chattenden, at Lodge Hill; opening in 1898, it dealt principally with cordite. At Upnor itself further Shell Stores was built in the 1880s, supplemented by new buildings for storing wet and dry guncotton (used in torpedoes and mines) in 1895. The site was extended further to the north in the early 1900s to allow construction of a much larger store for filled shells and another for mines. At the same time a complex of buildings for filling shells with powder (and later also with trotyl and amatol) were added behind the original &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; magazines.

The three sites, Upnor, Lodge Hill and Chattenden, were active as Royal Naval Armaments Depots until the mid-1960s. Thereafter they remained in military hands as part of the Royal School of Military Engineering until the mid-2010s.

====Present day====
The Lower Upnor site was put up for sale in 2014. Two years later, the Grade II* listed &#x27;B&#x27; Magazine was being converted into offices, while a residential building of similar proportions was being erected on the footprint of the demolished &#x27;A&#x27; Magazine alongside; behind the magazines, more apartments were planned within the surviving concrete traverses (blast walls) of a demolished set of shell-filling rooms (dating from 1906). Meanwhile, the surviving buildings to the north were also being refurbished for light commercial and retail use. The inland depots, latterly known as Chattenden and Lodge Hill Military Camps, were put up for sale in 2016.

===The military railway===

The army used this area to train a railway engineering force. They built a standard gauge railway from Chattenden to Upnor in 1872–73. This was abandoned before 1881 and a gauge line was built in 1885 or by the 8th (Railway) Company R.E. in 1898. One branch went to Lower Upnor, and the other to the camp by Tower Hill. This line was used to supply armaments from Chattenden, the Lodge Hill Ammunition Depot and the standard gauge at Sharnal Street, to the warships and the Upnor Magazine. The service closed on 19 May 1961.

In 1965–1967, the Royal Engineers converted the route from Lower Upnor to Chattenden into a road, including building a new bridge over Four Elms Hill (the main road through Chattenden village). The new road is named Upchat Road.

===The Royal Engineers===

The Royal Engineers still have a presence in Upper Upnor; the Royal School of Military Engineering (Riverine Operations section) maintains classrooms, workshops and a hard in Upnor for training Royal Engineers assault boat operators and watermanship safety officers, who continue to operate craft on operations all over the world. The section operates Mk 1 and 3 Rigid Raiders, and combat support boats, as well as teaching use of the Mk 6 Assault Boat. The area is also used for other training purposes by the Royal School of Military Engineering including practice and test bomb disposal tasks by the Defence Explosive Ordnance Disposal School, until its move to Bicester.

<doc id="1057538" wikidata="Q3973172" url="?curid=1057538" title="Stephen Cleobury">
<text>Sir Stephen John Cleobury ( ; 31 December 1948 – 22 November 2019) was an English organist and music director. He worked with the Choir of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he served as music director from 1982 to 2019, and with the BBC Singers.

During his long tenure at King&#x27;s College, with the choir having performed a live broadcast on the BBC on Christmas Eve since 1928, he made the singers even better known by tours and recordings. From 1984 he introduced the commission of a new Christmas carol annually. Among many honours, he was honorary fellow of the Royal School of Church Music, and was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2009. In 2019, he was knighted for his contributions to choral music.

== Life ==
=== Early years ===
Stephen John Cleobury was born in Bromley, Kent, the son of John F. Cleobury and Brenda J. Randall. He sang as a chorister at Worcester Cathedral under Douglas Guest then Christopher Robinson. He was organ scholar at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, under the musical directorship of George Guest, and sub-organist of Westminster Abbey before becoming the first Anglican master of music at the Catholic Westminster Cathedral in 1979. In the 1970s, he was head of music at both St Matthew&#x27;s Church, Northampton, and Northampton Grammar School, where he taught music for four years.

=== King&#x27;s College, Cambridge ===
In 1982 Cleobury succeeded Philip Ledger as Director of Music for the Choir of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he also taught music. He led the annual Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at the King&#x27;s College Chapel on Christmas Eve, which was established in 1918 and broadcast live by the BBC from 1928. Cleobury&#x27;s most notable contribution was, from 1984, the incorporation of specially commissioned modern works to complement the traditional carols. Among the composers contributing were Thomas Adès, John Tavener and Mark-Anthony Turnage. Harrison Birtwistle&#x27;s &quot;The Gleam&quot;, which requires the choristers to stamp their feet and shout, caused some controversy. The high-profile performance of these commissions allowed the widespread dissemination of sophisticated contemporary choral music.

Cleobury introduced singing lessons for the choristers and expanded the repertoire to include more singing in Latin, and composers such as Kodály, Janáček and Arvo Pärt. He established the Festival of Easter at King&#x27;s and also Concerts at King&#x27;s, a concert series throughout the year. Recordings were made by the choir&#x27;s own label beginning in 2012.

He was conductor of Cambridge University Musical Society (CUMS) from 1983 to 2009, and made many recordings with that group including Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Quattro Pezzi Sacri&quot; and Goehr&#x27;s &quot;The Death of Moses&quot;. As part of the celebrations of the 800th anniversary of Cambridge University, he premiered Peter Maxwell Davies&#x27; &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Mirror&quot;.
His last major project there was Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; in 2019, in a sequence of performing it alternating with the &quot;St John Passion&quot; every year. The choir performed with the Academy of Ancient Music and James Gilchrist as the Evangelist. He retired on 30 September 2019, and was succeeded at King&#x27;s College by Daniel Hyde.

=== Beyond Cambridge ===
Cleobury was president of the Royal College of Organists from 1990 to 1992. He was chief conductor of the BBC Singers from 1995 to 2007, and was then their conductor laureate. He performed with them themed concerts such as &quot;Shostakovich, Stalin and Soviet Russia&quot; in 2014, &quot;Creation songs&quot; in 2015, &quot;Tallis Lamentations&quot; in 2016, and for Remembrance Day 2017, &quot;Songs of Farewell&quot;. The latter was given at the King&#x27;s College Chapel, and combined the world premiere of Thomas Simaku&#x27;s &quot;The Scream&quot; with Hubert Parry&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Farewell&quot;, and Duruflé&#x27;s &quot;Notre Père&quot; and Requiem. In the concert celebrating the choir&#x27;s 90th anniversary on 24 September 2014, he was one of four conductors to lead compositions written for the group. Cleobury served as a visiting fellow at the Louisiana State University School of Music for 2013–2014.

== Personal life ==
Cleobury&#x27;s brother Nicholas is also a conductor and his sister is a musician and teacher. His cousin Stephen Dean is a composer. Cleobury lived with his second wife, Emma Disley, whom he married in 2004, and their two daughters. He died of cancer in his hometown of York, on 22 November 2019, the liturgical feast day of Saint Cecilia, patron saint of organ players and musicians. He also had two children from his first marriage to Penny Holloway.

== Honours and awards ==
Cleobury was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Music (D.Mus.) from Anglia Ruskin University in 2001. In 2008 he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal School of Church Music. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours and was knighted in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to choral music.

<text>Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea is a 1961 American science fiction disaster film, produced and directed by Irwin Allen, and starring Walter Pidgeon and Robert Sterling. The supporting cast includes Peter Lorre, Joan Fontaine, Barbara Eden, Michael Ansara, and Frankie Avalon. The film&#x27;s storyline was written by Irwin Allen and Charles Bennett. The opening title credits theme song was sung by Avalon. The film was distributed by 20th Century Fox.

==Plot==
The state-of-the-art nuclear submarine, &quot;Seaview&quot;, is on diving trials in the Arctic Ocean. &quot;Seaview&quot; is designed by scientist Admiral Harriman Nelson (USN-Ret). Captain Lee Crane is Seaview&#x27;s Commanding Officer. The mission includes being out of radio contact for 96 hours while under the Arctic ice cap. The polar ice begins to crack and melt, with boulder-size pieces sinking into the ocean around the submerged submarine. Surfacing, they discover the sky is on fire. After rescuing scientist Miguel Alvarez and his dog at Ice Floe Delta, &quot;Seaview&quot; receives a radio message from Mission Director Inspector Bergan at the Bureau of Marine Exploration. After piercing the Van Allen radiation belt, a meteor shower caught on fire, resulting in an increase in the global temperature.

The President summons Admiral Nelson to a United Nations Emergency Scientific meeting. Nelson and Commodore Lucius Emery have devised a plan to end the catastrophe. &quot;Seaview&quot; arrives in New York Harbor two days later. According to Nelson and Emery&#x27;s calculations, if the increasing temperature is not stopped, it will become irreversible and the Earth will die in about three weeks. Nelson and Emery propose extinguishing the fire by launching a nuclear missile at the burning belt from the Mariana Islands. A nuclear explosion should extinguish the flames, &quot;amputating&quot; the belt from the Earth. &quot;Seaview&quot; can fire the missile. The chief scientist and head delegate, Vienna&#x27;s Emilio Zucco, rejects Nelson&#x27;s plan as too risky. He believes the composition of the belt&#x27;s gasses will cause the fire to soon burn itself out. Nelson disagrees with Zucco&#x27;s theory, claiming that his estimated burn-out point is incorrect. However, Nelson and Emery&#x27;s plan is rejected. The two leave the proceedings intending to get authorization directly from the President himself.

The &quot;Seaview&quot; races to reach the optimal firing position above the Pacific Ocean&#x27;s Mariana Trench in time for the needed angle of trajectory. Nelson and Crane attempt tapping the Rio-to-London telephone cable, trying to reach the President. During the cable tapping attempt, Crane and Alvarez battle a giant squid. They can only tap into the London cable, and Nelson learns there has been no contact with the U.S. for 35 hours.

An unsuccessful attempt on the Admiral&#x27;s life indicates a saboteur is aboard. Alvarez, a religious zealot regarding the catastrophe, is the suspected saboteur. Dr. Susan Hiller, who privately supports Dr. Zucco&#x27;s plan, is another suspect.

The &quot;Seaview&#x27;s&quot; main generator is then sabotaged by a crew member who lost his mind, forcing Nelson to order Crane to proceed while repairs are made despite the risk of traveling without power for the sonar and radar. As a result, the submarine narrowly escapes a minefield left over from World War II. The crew are near-mutiny, to the point that when the &quot;Seaview&quot; encounters a motor ship whose crew is dead, Captain Crane and the Admiral allow any men who wish to leave rather than continue the mission to sail the derelict home.

Crane begins doubting the Admiral&#x27;s tactics and reasoning. A hostile submarine pursues them, diving into the Mariana Trench, exceeding its crush depth; it implodes before it can destroy &quot;Seaview&quot;.

The saboteur has shut down the sub&#x27;s power. Crane encounters Dr. Hiller, the saboteur, atop the shark tank, as she exits the restricted nuclear reactor core. Her radiation detector badge has turned red, showing she has been exposed to a fatal dose. When asked why, she says to prevent the sub from reaching its target. An explosion rocks the sub, throwing Dr. Hiller into the shark tank. The sharks kill her.

&quot;Seaview&quot; reaches the Mariana Islands in time to carry out the Admiral&#x27;s plan. He learns that temperatures are rising faster than projected, proving Zucco&#x27;s theory is incorrect. Alvarez, believing it is God&#x27;s will for the Earth to be destroyed, attempts to sabotage the mission by threatening to explode a bomb. The nuclear missile is launched toward the belt by Captain Crane, who does it from outside the sub before Alvarez is aware. It explodes in the Van Allen Belt as intended, driving the burning flames away from Earth and saving humanity.

As the sky returns to its normal color, &quot;Seaview&quot; turns for home, her mission completed.

==Historical and technical background==

The name of the film is an inversion of a phrase in common use at the time, concerning the exploration of the Arctic Ocean by nuclear submarines, namely, &quot;a voyage to the top of the world&quot;.

From August 1, 1958, through August 5, 1958, (the first nuclear-powered submarine), under the command of Commander (later Captain) William R. Anderson, steamed under the Arctic ice cap to make the first crossing from the Pacific to the Atlantic via the North Pole. On August 3, 1958, she became the first vessel to reach the North Pole.

For this accomplishment, &quot;Nautilus&quot; and her crew were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation, the first Presidential Unit Citation awarded in peacetime. The citation began with the words, &quot;For outstanding achievement in completing the first voyage in history across the top of the world, by cruising under the Arctic ice cap from the Bering Strait to the Greenland Sea&quot;.

&quot;Nautilus 90 North&quot; (1959, with Clay Blair) was the first book Anderson wrote about the Arctic missions of USS &quot;Nautilus&quot;. It was named for the radio message he sent to the Chief of Naval Operations to announce that &quot;Nautilus&quot; had reached the pole. His second book about these missions, &quot;The Ice Diaries: The Untold Story of the Cold War&#x27;s Most Daring Mission&quot; (with Don Keith), was completed shortly before Anderson&#x27;s death. This second book includes many previously classified details.

On March 17, 1959, the nuclear submarine , under the command of Commander (later Vice Admiral) James F. Calvert, became the first submarine to surface at the North Pole. While there, her crew scattered the ashes of Arctic explorer Sir Hubert Wilkins. Calvert wrote the book &quot;Surface at the Pole&quot; about this and the other Arctic missions of USS &quot;Skate.&quot;

The film &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; begins with &quot;Seaview&quot; in the Arctic for the final phase of her sea trials, including a dive under the ice cap.

Two milestones in underwater exploration were achieved in 1960, the year before &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; was released. On January 23, 1960, Jacques Piccard and Lieutenant Don Walsh (USN), in the bathyscaphe &quot;Trieste&quot;, made the first descent to the bottom of the Challenger Deep. The Challenger Deep is the deepest surveyed spot in the world&#x27;s oceans, and is located in the Mariana Trench, southwest of Guam. From February 16, 1960, to May 10, 1960, the submarine , under the command of Captain Edward L. Beach, Jr., made the first submerged circumnavigation of the world. &quot;Triton&quot; observed and photographed Guam extensively through her periscope during this mission, without being detected by the U.S. Navy on Guam.

In the film, &quot;Seaview&quot; fires a missile from a position northwest of Guam to extinguish the &quot;sky fire&quot;.

At the time that &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; was made, the Van Allen radiation belts had only recently been discovered, and most of what the film states concerning them is fiction. Discoveries since then clearly invalidate what the film says: the Van Allen belts (actually somewhat more radiation-dense portions of the magnetosphere) are made up of sub-atomic particles trapped by the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field in the vacuum of space and cannot catch fire, as fire requires oxygen, fuel, and an ignition source, all of which are insufficient in the Van Allen Belts. Unburned hydrocarbon emissions have never reached concentrations that could support a &quot;sky fire&quot;.

At the beginning of the film, pieces of the polar ice cap are sinking, colliding with &quot;Seaview.&quot; No explanation is given as to why the ice doesn&#x27;t float.

==The submarine &quot;Seaview&quot;==
The film&#x27;s submarine design is unique in featuring an eight-window bow viewport that provides panoramic undersea views. In the novelization by Theodore Sturgeon, the windows are described as &quot;oversized hull plates which happen to be transparent&quot;. They are made of &quot;X-tempered herculite&quot;, a process developed by Nelson. In the film, &quot;Seaview&quot; has eight bow windows in the exterior shots, but only four appear in the interior shots showing the lower level Observation Room (the four upper windows are implied to be out of frame, at the top of the Observation Room). The lower hull also has an exterior shark-like bow flare, and the stern has tail fins reminiscent of a Cadillac circa 1959. &quot;Seaview&quot; is propelled by a water-jet system generally similar to the magnetohydrodynamic system employed by the &quot;Red October&quot; in the 1990 film The Hunt for Red October, though no details are provided in the film.

In the film, the USOS &quot;Seaview&quot; (&quot;United States Oceanographic Survey&quot;) is under the authority of Nelson and the Bureau of Marine Exploration rather than the U.S. Navy. The novel mentions the bureau as being part of the U.S. Department of Science. The crew wears World War II U.S. Army tropical khaki dress uniforms with naval rank insignia on the sleeves, rather than U.S. Navy service dress khaki with shoulder boards. The officers&#x27; working uniforms are U.S. Army khaki long with epaulets, black tie, and lapel insignia; however, unlike the U.S. Navy, the Marine Exploration insignia, a specialist insignia, is worn on the right collar point and rank insignia is worn on the left, the reverse of U.S. Navy practice. The crew&#x27;s working uniform is the U.S. Navy period-correct chambray shirt and dungaree uniform, with the white &quot;dixie cup&quot; cap. Chief petty officers wear the Army khaki uniform with U.S. Navy style chief&#x27;s rank (less the Navy &quot;crow&quot; on top of the rocker) on both sleeves. The effect is that of government service, but not necessarily military service.

==Production==
The film was part of an upswing in science fiction and fantasy films of the era, including adaptations of Jules Verne&#x27;s and H. G. Wells&#x27; works.

The film marked Walter Pidgeon&#x27;s return to filmmaking after several years working in the theater. The role of Captain Crane was originally offered to David Hedison, who turned it down after completing Allen&#x27;s &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1960), saying that he did not like the script. He would later play the role in the 1964 television series based on the film. Frankie Avalon&#x27;s appearance was one of several he made in films around this time where he was cast to appeal to teen audiences; he also sang the title track.

Set designer Herman Blumenthal did not approach the Navy to do research; he relied solely on pictures of naval vessels in the media.

The theatrical release poster shown above is one of four posters that were produced to promote the film. Each one has different wording and slightly different artwork, and each one promotes the film from a different perspective. The above poster also promotes Sturgeon&#x27;s novelization.

==Reception==
&quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; was previewed on June 18, 1961. It was released to theaters in early July 1961 and had run its course by late fall (September/October). The film played to mixed reviews from critics, but audiences made the film a popular success. &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; was made for US$2 million and brought in US$7 million at the box office.

==Impact==
For the filming of &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, detailed sets, props and scale models were created to realize the &quot;Seaview&quot; submarine. After the film was completed, the sets were placed in storage. When Irwin Allen decided to make a &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; television series, all he had to do was pull the sets out of storage. This was done at a fraction of the cost that he might have had if he had begun from scratch. The film reduced the cost of setting up the show and was the template for the type of stories that were done. The studios, having made the film, helped make the television series easier to produce.

==Other media==

===Television===
The success of the feature film led to the 1964–1968 ABC television series, &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;. During the series run, the film&#x27;s storyline was remade as a one-hour episode, written by Willam Welch, and titled &quot;The Sky&#x27;s on Fire&quot;. Other scenes from the film were also rewritten and incorporated into the television series.

=== Novels ===
In June 1961, Pyramid Books published a novelization of the film by science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon. The book went on to be reprinted several times during the 1960s. One of those reprintings pictures Richard Basehart and David Hedison on the cover, but the book is still based on the Walter Pidgeon film. Collectors who want a novelization of the television series should find &quot;City Under the Sea&quot;. That novel uses the television characters, but should not be confused with either the television series or the later Irwin Allen film with the same name.

Sturgeon&#x27;s book is based on an early version of the film&#x27;s script and has the same basic story as the film. It also has a few characters that were not in the film, as well as some additional technical explanation. Some film scenes are different, while some others are wholly absent from the film. Likewise, some film scenes are missing from the book.

The original 1961 book cover portrays a submarine meeting a fanged sea serpent. This scene is not in the novel or the film. The submarine design on the cover does not match the &quot;Seaview&quot; shown in the film or the &quot;Seaview&quot; described in the novel: The submarine&#x27;s bow is opaque, and her &quot;Observation Room&quot; is a rearward projection from the base of the conning tower. The basic shape of the &quot;Seaview&quot;&#x27;s hull resembles that of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s , the first American nuclear-powered submarine with an &quot;Albacore hull&quot;, including its cruciform stern and single-screw propeller.

===Comics===
A submarine design very similar to the one used on the 1961 book cover shows up in the 1962 Dell Comics series, &quot;Voyage to the Deep&quot; (with a similar mission to save the world), that was published to capitalize on the film&#x27;s popularity. The submarine&#x27;s mission took it to the Mariana Trench to stop the Earth from wobbling out of orbit. Dell later cancelled the title with issue #4. The submarine was named &quot;Proteus&quot;, later the name of the submersible seen in the science fiction film &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; (1966).

In 1961, Dell Comics created a full-color adaptation of the &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; film. The comic book was &quot;Four Color Comics&quot; #1230 and was illustrated by Sam Glanzman. It contains a few publicity stills from the film, plus a section on the history of submarines. In this adaptation, the Admiral&#x27;s first name is Farragut instead of Harriman.

&quot;Mad&quot; magazine published a TV series parody entitled, &quot;Voyage to See What&#x27;s on the Bottom&quot;.

===Other===
There is also a family board game, manufactured by GemColor, that is tied to the film and not the television series. The game&#x27;s product carton uses a photo of a wetsuited scuba diver with the eight-foot shooting miniature of the &quot;Seaview&quot;.

A &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; coloring book for children was released in the mid-1960s.

The film has since been released in multiple territories on VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.

<doc id="1057544" wikidata="Q474956" url="?curid=1057544" title="Lu Xun Literary Prize">
<text>The Lu Xun Literary Prize (or Lu Xun Literature Prize) 鲁迅文学奖 is a literary prize awarded by China Writers Association. It is one of China&#x27;s top four literary prizes and is named after Lu Xun and has been awarded every three years since 1995. Its predecessor, the National Outstanding Short Story Award and National Outstanding Novella Award, was established since the beginning of the new-era literature in the early 1980s.

Some of the critics believe that the credibility of &quot;Lu Xun Literary Prize&quot; is getting worse, and the basic attitude of their criticisms is that the &quot;Lu Xun Literary Prize&quot; has nothing to do with the &quot;Lu Xun’s Spirit&quot;, and &quot;lacks specific standards&quot;, &quot;is a black box operation&quot;, and &quot;is a money-for-award transaction&quot;. The prize should be awarded to the really outstanding writers, and the process of appraisal and election should be transparent. 

The 2010 Lu Xun literature prize 5th Award Ceremony was held in Shaoxing on October 19, 2010. Che Yangao, secretary of the discipline inspection committee in Hubei&#x27;s capital city of Wuhan, won the award for his collection of poems &quot;Yearning for Warmth.&quot;

The Prize has seven award categories:
* National Excellent Novella Award
* National Excellent Short Story Award
* National Excellent Reportage Award
* National Outstanding Poetry Award
* National Excellent Prose Essay Prize
* National Outstanding Literary Review Awards
* National Outstanding Literary Translation Award (formerly the Rainbow Translation Award)

<text>A programming game is a video game that incorporates elements of computer programming, enabling the player to direct otherwise autonomous units within the game to follow commands in a domain-specific programming language, often represented as a visual language to simplify the programming metaphor. Programming games broadly fall into two areas: single-player games where the programming elements either make up part of or the whole of a puzzle game, and multiplayer games where the player&#x27;s automated program is pitted against other players&#x27; programs.

==As puzzle games==
Early games in the genre include &quot;System 15000&quot; and &quot;Hacker&quot;, released in 1984 and 1985 respectively.

Programming games have been used as part of puzzle games, challenging the player to achieve a specific result once the program starts operating. An example of such a game is &quot;SpaceChem&quot;, where the player must use its visual language to manipulate two waldos as to disassemble and reassemble chemical molecules. In such games, players are able to test and debug their program as often as necessary until they find a solution that works. Many of these games encourage the player to find the most efficient program, measured by the number of timesteps needed or number of commands required. Other similar games include &quot;Human Resource Machine&quot;, &quot;Infinifactory&quot;, and &quot;TIS-100&quot;. Zachtronics is a video game development company known for its programming-centric puzzle games.

Other games incorporate the elements of programming as portions of puzzles in the larger game. For example, &quot;Hack &#x27;n&#x27; Slash&quot; include a metaphor of being able to access the internal programs and variables of objects represented in the game world, pausing the rest of the game as the player engages this programming interface, and modify the object&#x27;s program as to progress further; this might be changing the state of an object from being indestructible to destructible. Other similar games with this type of programming approach include &quot;Transistor&quot;, &quot;else Heart.Break()&quot;, &quot;Glitchspace&quot;, and &quot;Pony Island&quot;.

Another approach used in some graphical games with programming elements is to present the player with a command line interface to issue orders via a domain-specific language to direct objects within the game, allowing the player to reissue commands as the situation changes rather than crafting a pre-made program. Games like &quot;Quadrilateral Cowboy&quot; and &quot;Duskers&quot; have the user command several small robotic creatures in tandem through the language of code to reach a certain goal. &quot;Hackmud&quot; presents the player with a simulated mainframe interface through which they issue commands to progress forward.

==As competitive games==
Many programming games involve controlling entities such as robots, tanks or bacteria which seek to destroy each other. Such games can be considered environments of digital organisms, related to artificial life simulations. An early example is &quot;Core War&quot; (1984), where programs written in a standardized assembly-like language battle for space in a finite memory (virtual magnetic &quot;cores&quot;). Players are given tools to develop and test out their programs within the game&#x27;s domain-specific language before submitting the program to a central server. The server then executes the program against others and reports the results to the player, from which they can make changes or improvements to the program.

There are different tournaments and leagues for the programming games where the characters can compete with each other. Usually a script is optimized for a special strategy. Similar approaches are used for more traditional games; the World Computer Chess Championship consists of matches between programs written for the abstract strategy game of chess.

The competitive programming game has also found its way to various board games such as &quot;RoboRally&quot; or &quot;Robot Turtles&quot;, typically where a program becomes a premade deck of playing cards played one by one to execute that code.

Researchers presented &quot;RoboCode&quot; as a &quot;problem-based learning&quot; substrate for teaching programming.

==Related areas==
Open world games that feature the ability for players to construct environments from an array of building blocks have often been used by more advanced players to construct logic circuits and more advanced programs from the fundamental blocks. &quot;Minecraft&quot; is one such example, as while the game provides a limited set of blocks that mimic switches and electric circuits, users have been able to create basic functional computers within the virtual world, and at least one modification is aimed to teach children how to program on the virtual computer in a simplistic language.

Several sites, such as &quot;Codecademy&quot;, help to teach real-world programming languages through gamification, where video game principles are used to motivate the user.

<text>Chiddingstone Castle is situated in the village of Chiddingstone, near Edenbridge, Kent, England, south-southeast of London and in the upper valley of the River Medway. The castle was built by the Streatfeild family and served as their seat from the early 16th century until the beginning of the 20th century when the family left the castle. The Streatfeilds sold the castle to Lord Astor in 1938. Since 1977, the castle and its of grounds have been held in trust for the nation by the Denys Eyre Bower Bequest, and both are open to the public. Much of the current structure dates from the early 19th century, but incorporates elements of the earlier buildings on the same site.

==History==
===High Street House===
The first significant building to occupy the site of the castle was a timber-framed dwelling, inhabited from the early 16th century by Richard Streatfeild, an iron master and wool merchant. Little remains of this first structure as, in 1679, Henry Streatfeild (1639–1719) had the house rebuilt in red brick in the Restoration style. The building was known as High Street House or High Street Mansion since it fronted the village high street. Remodelling of the house&#x27;s grounds in the 19th century resulted in the current diversion of the road through the village.

===Chiddingstone Castle===
In the early 19th century, Henry Streatfeild (1757–1829), the son of Henry Streatfeild (1706–1762) and Lady Anne Sidney, commissioned William Atkinson to rebuild the house in the Gothic style however Atkinson&#x27;s design was not completed and, in 1835, Streatfeild&#x27;s son, also Henry Streatfeild (1784–1852), engaged the architect Henry Kendal to carry out further work. Although the Streatfields owned the house, now renamed Chiddingstone Castle, until it was sold to Lord Astor in 1938, the family did not live there after 1900. During the Second World War, the castle hosted members of the Canadian Forces before becoming Long Dene School until 1954.

===Denys Eyre Bower===
In 1955, the castle was purchased by Denys Eyre Bower (1905–1977), a former bank clerk and antiques dealer, in order to display his collections. Bower was born in Crich, Derbyshire and started collecting at a young age. Bower initially worked as a bank clerk before taking over Cavendish Hood antiques dealers in Baker Street, London in 1943. The redevelopment of Baker Street led to Bower moving to Chiddingstone Castle where he intended to show his collections to the public. However, in 1957 Bower was convicted of attempted murder of his mistress, whom he shot, and attempted suicide and sentenced to life imprisonment. Released in 1962 after successful efforts by solicitor Ruth Eldridge to prove a miscarriage of justice, Bower returned to Chiddingstone Castle which, with the help of Eldridge and her sister Mary, he continued to open to visitors until his death in 1977.

===Today===
Bower left the castle and his collection to the nation and so upon his death the Denys Eyre Bower Bequest was formed. This trust continues to care for the castle and its collection, opening it to the public and providing a venue for weddings, and the current trustees include descendants of the Streatfeild family. The castle is a Grade II* listed building and the grounds, which contain further listed buildings including an orangery, are themselves included on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The Castle is an accredited museum, contains a tea-room serving refreshments and hosts a variety of events and activities throughout the year.
=== Fishing ===
The Castle lake measures around 3.5 hectares. It divides the village of Chiddingstone from the grounds of Chiddingstone Castle. It is naturally stocked with wild Carp, Bream and Perch. It held the record for the largest Bream for 37 years, from 1945.

==Collections==

===Japanese===
Bower&#x27;s decision to collect objects from Japan was inspired by his father&#x27;s own interest in Chinese porcelain. The collection of lacquer is considered to be one of the most important in a private collection, whilst displays at the castle also feature swords, armour and haniwa figures.

===Ancient Egyptian===
The Ancient Egyptian collection spans the whole history of the civilisation and includes both grave goods, such as ushabti figures and amulets, and items from everyday life, including food and drink vessels. In 2013, items from the collection were lent to the Houston Museum of Natural Science for display in their Hall of Ancient Egypt.

===Stuart and Jacobite===
In British history, Bower was most interested in the House of Stuart and Jacobitism and was a member of the Royal Stuart Society. His collecting in this area included portraits of members of the House of Stuart, swords, objects with hidden Jacobite symbols and royal manuscripts. There is an extensive collection of antique books on the subject in the library, on display at the Castle.

===Buddhist===
As with other areas of his collecting, Bower&#x27;s interest in objects relating to Buddhism was driven by personal reasons; Bower was a Buddhist. Despite this, the collection does not focus on any one particular school of Buddhist thought or on any particular country. Amongst items currently displayed at the castle are thangkas and images of Buddha.

===Local history===
In addition to Bower&#x27;s collections, the castle&#x27;s 19th-century kitchen still retains many of its original features, such as three cake ovens, and is used to display a collection of kitchen utensils and an ice chest, reflecting the fact that the castle once had an ice house. There is also a servants&#x27; hall and a servants&#x27; bedroom. The Castle also holds some archives of local history.

<doc id="1057569" wikidata="Q2323002" url="?curid=1057569" title="Bells Are Ringing (film)">
<text>Bells Are Ringing is a 1960 American romantic comedy-musical film directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Judy Holliday and Dean Martin. Based on the successful 1956 Broadway production of the same name by Betty Comden, Adolph Green and Jule Styne, the film focuses on Ella Peterson, based on the life of Mary Printz, who works in the basement office of a telephone answering service.

==Plot==
Ella Peterson works as a switchboard operator at the Susanswerphone answering service. She can&#x27;t help breaking the rules by becoming overly involved in the lives of the subscribers. Some of the more peculiar ones include a dentist who exuberantly composes song lyrics on an air hose, an actor who emulates Marlon Brando and a little boy for whom she pretends to be Santa Claus.

Ella has a secret crush on the voice of subscriber Jeffrey Moss, an insecure playwright whose writing partner has left him and who has taken to drinking too much, for whom she plays a comforting motherly character. The producer of his play, &quot;The Midas Touch,&quot; leaves an ultimatum for Jeffrey that he must submit an installment of his play by an imminent deadline or lose the job. Drunk and dispirited, Jeffrey has left his phone off the hook. Breaking the rules to meet Jeffrey in person, Ella pretends to be &quot;Melisande Scott&quot;, stopping by his apartment to rouse Jeffrey for his meeting and convince him that he can be successful on his own. Through a series of manipulations, Ella introduces the playwright to the wishful actor and composer, who now have a chance to advance their career aspirations by contributing to &quot;The Midas Touch.&quot; Romantic sparks and confusions result.

A humorous subplot involves the courtly Otto, who convinces Susanswerphone to take orders for his &quot;mail-order classical record business&quot; known as Titanic Records. However, Otto is actually a bookie whose orders are a coded system for betting on horses. Unwittingly, Ella changes orders for the supposedly incorrect Beethoven&#x27;s Tenth Symphony, Opus 6, not realizing she is changing bets.

Although the police begin to assume that Susanswerphone might be a front for an escort service, the plot ends happily, with Jeff proposing and Ella&#x27;s wacky subscribers coming to thank her.

==Production==
Judy Holliday and Jean Stapleton reprised their stage roles for the film. Jazz musician Gerry Mulligan, Holliday&#x27;s real-life ex-lover, plays her disastrous blind date in a cameo role. &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; was Holliday&#x27;s final film.

Hal Linden appears, uncredited, in his first film appearance, singing &#x27;The Midas Touch&#x27; in the nightclub act, wearing a gold lame suit. A friend of Holliday, he portrayed Jeff Moss with her in the Broadway play in 1958-1959.

&quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; was also the final musical produced by the MGM &quot;Freed Unit&quot; headed by producer Arthur Freed, which had been responsible for many of the studio&#x27;s greatest successes, including &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1944), &quot;Easter Parade&quot; (1948), &quot;On the Town&quot; (1949), &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951), &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952) and &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958). The film marked the 13th and final collaboration between Freed and director Vincente Minnelli.

Several songs from the Broadway production were dropped or replaced, including &quot;Salzburg&quot;, &quot;Hello, Hello There&quot;, &quot;On My Own&quot; (replaced by &quot;Do It Yourself&quot;), &quot;Long Before I Knew You&quot; (replaced by &quot;Better Than a Dream&quot;), &quot;Mu Cha Cha&quot; (filmed but shortened) and &quot;Is it a Crime?&quot; (filmed, but cut before release). A new song for Dean Martin, &quot;My Guiding Star&quot;, was also filmed but cut. The latter two songs have been released as extras on the Warner Home Video DVD. The soundtrack album was released by Capitol Records.

The row house used for exteriors stood at 215 East 68th Street, Manhattan, and had once been the residence of author Stephen Vincent Benet. It was a holdout from a row and was torn down in the early 1960s.

==Reception==
In a contemporary review, critic Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was critical of the script but praised Holliday&#x27;s performance: &quot;[T]he jangled romance they have prepared for her to play is a poor thing, made up of one slight gimmick and a lot of surrounding gags. What Miss Holliday does with the latter is the measure of the quality of the show. ... You can take our word for it: &#x27;Bells Are Ringing&#x27; owes more to Miss Holliday than to its authors, its director (Vincent Minnelli), or even to Alexander Graham Bell.&quot;

== Awards and nominations ==
Comden and Green won the Writers Guild of America award for Best American Musical. Together with Styne, they shared a Grammy Award nomination for Best Soundtrack Album or Recording of Original Cast from a Motion Picture or TV. Minnelli earned a Best Director nomination from the Directors Guild of America. André Previn was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture. At the 18th Annual Golden Globe Awards, the film was nominated for Best Film - Musical, and Holliday was nominated for Best Actress - Musical.

==Box-office==
According to MGM records, the film earned $2,825,000 in the U.S. and Canada but only $800,000 elsewhere, losing a total of $1,720,000.

<text>Chiddingstone is a village and civil parish in the Sevenoaks District of Kent, England. The parish is located on the River Eden between Tonbridge and Edenbridge. The villages of Chiddingstone Causeway and Bough Beech and the hamlet Chiddingstone Hoath are also included in the parish. 

Chiddingstone is unique in that, apart from the church and Chiddingstone Castle, the entire village is owned by the National Trust, which describes it as &quot;the best example of a Tudor village left in the country&quot;. It is an example of a Tudor one-street village.

==History==

Chiddingstone is mentioned in the Domesday Book. It was given to Bishop Odo in 1072 after the Norman invasion as part of his Earldom of Kent.

The first house was owned by Roger Attwood, constructed in the typical Kent style. Several villagers including Atwood took part in Jack Cade&#x27;s rebellion of 1450, and were later pardoned.

The Castle Inn is a 15th-century building, which became a hostelry in 1730. It was visited by artists John Millais and Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Arthur Rackham also visited Chiddingstone.

The Streatfeild family were major landowners in the area, starting in 1584. In the early 1800s Henry Streatfeild changed the village significantly, diverting the road and demolishing some buildings.

The National Trust bought the village in 1939.

===Parish church===

St. Mary the Virgin, Chiddingstone is a large parish church which enhances the look of the village, and is perhaps the fourth built on that site. In the churchyard is a stone gazebo dating from 1736 built by Henry Streatfeild; leading down into the Streatfeild family vault beneath which has a through flow of air provided by vents in two false altar tombs, one adjacent to the gazebo and the other some 30 feet north.

The church was almost destroyed by a lightning fire in 1624. In recent years it has had new heating, lighting and sound systems installed. In addition to this, a chapel, at the base of the tower, has been constructed in 1979 with adjoining lavatory added in 2007.

===Origin of name===

A popular theory is that the village takes its name from a large sandstone rock formation, situated on its outskirts, named the Chiding Stone. Chidingstone was a previous spelling used for the village. The National Trust consider it more likely the name is derived from the homestead of Cidda&#x27;s family, &quot;Chidding tun&quot;. It was recorded as &quot;Cidingstane&quot; in the 12th century. The stone may have been used as a place to remonstrate overbearing local wives, a Druidical ritual site, or an Anglo-Saxon boundary marker.

==The village today==

The nearest available train station, Penshurst railway station, is located in the village of Chiddingstone Causeway. It is on the line between Tonbridge and Redhill.

There is a primary school, Chiddingstone Church of England School.

There are several nature reserves in the area including:
*Sevenoaks Reserve and Jeffery Harrison Visitor Centre (Operated by Kent Wildlife Trust)
*Bough Beech Visitors Centre and Reserve (Operated by Kent Wildlife Trust)
*Chiddingstone Reserve (Operated by Kent Wildlife Trust)

There is a village shop and accompanying cafe called The Tulip Tree, popular with cyclists at the weekend. 

===Film location===

The village was used as a setting in the 1985 Merchant Ivory film &quot;A Room with a View&quot;, in the scene where Lucy and Cecil take a walk after their engagement party. The High Street is seen from the end nearest to the Castle Inn.

Michael Winner used Chiddingstone in his production of &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot;.
Terry Jones and the Monty Python team filmed here for &quot;Wind in the Willows - Mr Toad&#x27;s Wild Ride&quot;. 
&quot;Elizabeth R&quot;, starring Glenda Jackson was largely made here, as was Gerald Scarfe&#x27;s &quot;Life of Hogarth&quot;.

<doc id="1057575" wikidata="Q1039656" url="?curid=1057575" title="Jobless recovery">
<text>A jobless recovery or jobless growth is an economic phenomenon in which a macroeconomy experiences growth while maintaining or decreasing its level of employment. The term was coined by the economist Nick Perna in the early 1990s.

==Causes==
Economists are still divided about the causes and cures of a jobless recovery: some argue that increased productivity through automation has allowed economic growth without reducing unemployment. Other economists state that blaming automation is an example of the luddite fallacy and that jobless recoveries stem from structural changes in the labor market, leading to unemployment as workers change jobs or industries.

===Industrial consolidation===
Some have argued that the recent lack of job creation in the United States is due to increased industrial consolidation and growth of monopoly or oligopoly power. The argument is twofold: firstly, small businesses create most American jobs, and secondly, small businesses have more difficulty starting and growing in the face of entrenched existing businesses (compare infant industry argument, applied at the level of industries, rather than individual firms).

== Population growth vs. employment growth ==

In addition to employment growth, population growth must also be considered concerning the perception of jobless recoveries. Immigrants (both legal and illegal) added to the workforce will often accept lower wages, causing persistent unemployment among those who were previously employed.

Surprisingly, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) does not offer data-sets isolated to the working-age population (ages 16 to 65). Including retirement age individuals in most BLS data-sets may tend to obfuscate the analysis of employment creation in relation to population growth. Additionally, incorrect assumptions about the term, Labor force, might also occur when reading BLS publications, millions of employable persons are not included within the official definition. The Labor force, as defined by the BLS, is a strict definition of those officially unemployed (U-3), and those who are officially employed (1 hour or more).

The following table and included chart depicts year-to-year employment growth in comparison to population growth for those persons under 65 years of age. As such, baby boomer retirements are removed from the data as a factor for consideration. The table includes the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Population Survey, for the Civilian noninstitutional population and corresponding Employment Levels, dating from 1948 and includes October 2013, the age groups are 16 years &amp; over, and 65 years &amp; over. The working-age population is then determined by subtracting those age 65 and over from the Civilian noninstitutional population and Employment Levels respectively. Isolated into the traditional working-age subset, growth in both employment levels and population levels are totaled by decade, an employment percentage rate is also displayed for comparison by decade.

When examined, by decade, the first decade of the 2000s, the United States suffered a 5% jobless rate when compared to the added working age population.

<doc id="1057577" wikidata="Q508558" url="?curid=1057577" title="Port triggering">
<text>Port triggering is a configuration option on a NAT-enabled router that controls communication between internal and external host machines in an IP network. It is similar to port forwarding in that it enables incoming traffic to be forwarded to a specific internal host machine, although the forwarded port is not open permanently and the target internal host machine is chosen dynamically.

== Description ==

When two networks communicate through a NAT-router, the host machines on the internal network behave as if they have the IP address of the NAT-router from the perspective of the host machines on the external network. Without any traffic forwarding rules, it is impossible for a host machine on an external network (host B) to open a connection to a host machine in the internal network (host A). This is because the connection can only be targeted to the IP of the NAT-router, since the internal network is hidden behind NAT. With port triggering, when some host A opens a connection to a host B using a predefined port or ports, then all incoming traffic that the router receives on some predefined port or ports is forwarded to host A. This is the &#x27;triggering&#x27; event for the forwarding rule. The forwarding rule is disabled after a period of inactivity.

Port triggering is useful for network applications where the client and server roles must be switched for certain tasks, such as authentication for IRC chat and file downloading for FTP file sharing.

=== Example ===

As an example of how port triggering operates, when connecting to IRC (Internet Relay Chat), it is common to authenticate a username with the Ident protocol via port 113.

When connecting to IRC, the client computer typically makes an outgoing connection on port 6667 (or any port in the range 6660–7000), causing the IRC server to attempt to verify the username given by making a new connection back to the client computer on port 113. When the computer is behind NAT, the NAT device silently drops this connection because it does not know to which computer behind the NAT it should send the request to connect. These two transport-level connections are necessary for the application-level connection to the IRC server to succeed (see Internet protocol suite). Since the second TCP/IP connection is not possible, the attempted connection to the IRC server will fail.

In the case of port triggering, the router is configured so that when an outbound connection is established on any port from 6660 to 7000, it should allow inbound connections to that particular computer on port 113. This gives it more flexibility than static port forwarding because it is not necessary to set it up for a specific address on your network, allowing multiple clients to connect to IRC servers through the NAT-router. Security is also gained, in the sense that the inbound port is not left open when not actively in use.

=== Disadvantages ===

Port triggering has the disadvantage that it binds the triggered port to a single client at a time. As long as the port is bound to that particular client, port triggering is effectively unavailable to all other clients. In FTP file sharing, for example, this means that no two clients can download files from an FTP server running on &quot;active mode&quot; simultaneously. For IRC, even though the authentication step happens very quickly, the port triggering timeout may still prevent other clients from logging into IRC servers. Port triggering is unsuitable for servers behind a NAT router because it relies on the local computer to make an outgoing connection before it can receive incoming ones. On some routers it is possible to have more than one client use port triggering and port forwarding, but not simultaneously.

<text>Greenhithe is a village in the Borough of Dartford in Kent, England, and the civil parish of Swanscombe and Greenhithe. It is located east of Dartford and west of Gravesend.

==Area==
In the past, Greenhithe&#x27;s waterfront on the estuary of the River Thames was used to build wharves for transshipping corn, wood and other commodities; its largest cargoes were of chalk and lime. This led in turn to the development of the cement industry at nearby Swanscombe. Greenhithe itself enjoyed a brief period of popularity during Victorian times as a tourist resort, with the building of Greenhithe Pier (now lost) in 1842. On 11 August 1863, Queen Victoria boarded the Royal Yacht &quot;Victoria and Albert&quot; - moored off Greenhithe - &quot;amid the eager applause of a large crowd of young and old&quot;.

Its manor house has been fully restored and the village is accessible to the M25 motorway, High Speed 1&#x27;s Ebbsfleet International station and, particularly relevant to its local economy, Bluewater shopping centre.

==History==
The social history of Greenhithe is bound up in terms of its rectory revenues and manors until the 20th century with its ecclesiastical parish, which is Swanscombe. It owes a great deal to its situation by the Thames and expansion to the nearby Watling Street (the London-Dover Road) and it being a suitable landing place for ships. In Roman times known as &quot;Gretenrsce&quot;, and by 1363 &quot;Grenehuth&quot;, &#x27;Greenhithe&#x27; comes from The Old English &#x27;hythe&#x27; meaning &#x27;landing-place&#x27;, with ‘grene’ as ‘green’; therefore, a ‘green landing place’.

It appears in a &quot;History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent&quot; by Edward Hasted, compiled early as such major works date, in this case to 1778:
 Greenhithe railway station opened on the South Eastern Railway’s North Kent Line, on 30 July 1849.

===Naval training and ship maintenance===
In the middle of the 19th century, the need was recognised for pre-sea training for potential officers in the Royal and Merchant Navies. This led a group of London shipowners to found the Thames Nautical Training College in 1862. The Admiralty was approached for a ship and allocated the &quot;two-decker&quot; . At the time the Royal Navy was starting to replace its fleet of &#x27;wooden walls&#x27; with iron-clad vessels and there was a surplus of such wooden vessels, which included the 1473-ton, 50-gun &quot;Worcester&quot;. She had various berths before finally moving in 1871 to what became a base forever associated with the &quot;Worcester&quot; – the village of Greenhithe, where successive ships remained until the 1970s. Also, HMS &quot;Erebus&quot; and HMS &quot;Terror&quot; departed from Greenhithe in May 1845, on the Franklin expedition.

The clipper &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; was given to the college in 1938, and was used as a &#x27;boating station&#x27; moored off the Greenhithe estate. However, during the war years, the college was evacuated to nearby Foots Cray Place. The &quot;Worcester&quot; was used as a training base by the Royal Navy but by 1945 the second &quot;Worcester&quot; was in a very poor condition, had lost most of her masts and was only kept afloat by a large salvage pump. Happily, after the war, a replacement ship was found in the form of the &quot;Exmouth&quot;, which was renamed and became the third and last &quot;Worcester&quot;. She was an unusual vessel, since she was built in 1904 of steel and iron especially for nautical training and had many advantages over the converted hulks previously used.

As a result of the acquisition of the fine new ship, the role of the &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; diminished and, with the approval of the original donor, Mrs Dowman, she was given to the nation through the National Maritime Museum. After restoration, she was moved to a permanent dry-dock at Greenwich.

The college moved to a new shore based Merchant Navy College and the last &quot;Worcester&quot; was broken up a few years later. The village of Greenhithe has many &quot;Worcester&quot; memories such as the sign at the waterside pub, and the streets named after &quot;Worcester&quot; personalities.

The new college allowed for expanded facilities and the new main building incorporated a replica of a modern ship&#x27;s bridge overlooking the River Thames.

==Ingress Abbey==

The &quot;Ingress&quot; Estate was a seat (manor) in the hamlet of Greenhithe. In 1363 the manor was endowed upon the Prioress and Abbey of the Dominican Sisters in Dartford by Edward III (1307–1377) until the Dissolution of the Monasteries under King Henry VIII of England.

In 1820, the Ingress Estate was purchased by barrister James Harman. He gave his architect, Charles Moreing, £120,000 to build the Abbey. The current Tudor-gothic-style mansion, Ingress Abbey, was constructed in 1833. Stone from the medieval London Bridge, replaced in the 1830s, is said to have been used in the construction. A grotto within the grounds known as the cave of the seven heads features keystones of grotesque heads which possibly came from the medieval London Bridge, 6 of which are still visible. The grounds were thought to have been landscaped by Capability Brown.

The Cameroon singer Irene Mayor lives in The Abbey.

==Economy==

Greenhithe&#x27;s economy no longer depends on river trade, this having been replaced by the M25 motorway, the new High Speed 1 Ebbsfleet International station and the Bluewater complex. The whole area is being redeveloped as part of the Thames Gateway regeneration. Its proponent councils and government sponsors thus aim to attract more affluence and income generation, particularly through the interaction with the enormous shopping complex. This is reflected in increased property valuations, and slightly higher spending than in 20th century overspill estates which tended to line the estuary.

Its high street is less significant a destination than Bluewater, which is supplemented by a supermarket in the village. Greenhithe railway station aside, there is little in the area apart from housing. The Thames Gateway project has seen expansion of residential neighbourhoods of the village such as Ingress Park and Waterstone Park, as well as of industrial and business estates that almost completely surround the former large hamlet.

== Paper mill ==
In 1904, plans emerged outlining the construction of a paper mill complex on a twenty-four acre site the east of Ingress Abbey. Designed by American architect and construction engineer Joseph H. Wallace the mill commenced operation in 1908 as ‘’Ingress Abbey Paper Mills’’. It was a part of ‘’Wall Paper Manufacturers Limited’’ and was the world’s most advanced paper mill. Furthermore, it was also the first mill of its type to be fitted with Crittall iron window frames.

Ingress Abbey Mill made numerous grades of paper from raw materials ranging from grasses of Northern Africa to old rags converted to pulp to make the final product. In 1922 the mill was taken over by Associated Newspapers Limited and was renamed Empire Paper Mills and producing up to 900 tons of newsprint a week.

The mill closed in 1992 before the site was completely redeveloped

==Transport==
===Rail===
Greenhithe station connects the village with National Rail services to Luton via Woolwich Arsenal and London St Pancras, London Victoria via Bexleyheath, London Charing Cross via Sidcup, Gravesend and Rainham.

===Buses===
Greenhithe is served by London Buses route 492, Arriva Kent Thameside routes A, B, 306, 480 &amp; 483 and Ensignbus route X80. These connect it with Bexleyheath, Bluewater, Crayford, Dartford, Ebbsfleet, Gravesend, Lakeside, Northfleet and Sidcup.

<text>A bridge router or brouter is a network device that works as a bridge and as a router. The brouter routes packets for known protocols and simply forwards all other packets as a bridge would.

Brouters operate at both the network layer for routable protocols and at the data link layer for non-routable protocols. As networks continue to become more complex, a mix of routable and non-routable protocols has led to the need for the combined features of bridges and routers. Brouters handle both routable and non-routable features by acting as routers for routable protocols and bridges for non-routable protocols. Bridged protocols might propagate throughout the network, but techniques such as filtering and learning might be used to reduce potential congestion. Brouters are used as connecting devices in the networking system, so they act as a bridge in a network and as a router in an internetwork.

<doc id="1057595" wikidata="Q5456623" url="?curid=1057595" title="Flag Group">
<text>The Flag Group was a British far-right political party, formed from one of the two wings of the National Front in the 1980s. Formed in opposition to the Political Soldier wing of the Official National Front, it took its name from &quot;The Flag&quot;, a newspaper the followers of this faction formed after leaving and regrouping outside the main and diminishing rump of the rest of the party.

==Emergence==
During the early 1980s the Political Soldier wing of the NF held sway within the party and was on good terms with chairman Andrew Brons who, although a Strasserite by conviction rather than a disciple of Julius Evola and ruralism, largely supported the young radicals and co-operated with them to remove Martin Webster, the former ally of Brons&#x27; predecessor John Tyndall, from the party in 1984. However cracks between the two factions soon began to show and a power struggle ensued. This culminated in 1986 when the two wings of the party split, with around 3000 of the 5000 registered NF members breaking away with Brons to form a new separate group. The immediate actual cause of the split had been the refusal of the Political Soldiers to contest elections and the Brons group made this the issue on which they started their own group, initially called the National Front Support Group before adopting their more usual Flag Group moniker. Activists such as Martin Wingfield, Ian Anderson, Joseph Pearce and Tom Acton emerged as the new leading figures within this group and the Flag Group initially grew at a much faster rate than the Official National Front, although this was in part due to the Political Soldiers closing off membership of their wing.

==Ideology==
The Flag Group rejected the mysticism of the Political Soldiers and the ONF&#x27;s technique of establishing contacts with non-white groups such as Black Power and Islamic fundamentalism activists. Despite these differences with the ONF the Flag Group was not a direct copy of the earlier NF as it was also influenced by &#x27;left-wing&#x27; economics ideals of Strasserism, albeit whilst emphasising anti-immigration and anti-Semitism alongside this. As time went on and Brons was sidelined in favour of Wingfield and Anderson the Flag Group began to look more towards the populism of the &quot;Front National&quot;, which was enjoying comparative success in France at the time, resulting in a return to more basic racist sentiments and less emphasis on economics as opposed to Strasserism. Amongst their more crudely racialist policies the Flag Group stressed the importance of having large families and included ideas about the white race being bred out of existence in their election literature. Steve Brady, formerly a leading figure in the National Party, championed this idea within the Flag Group although his other favoured idea, his opposition to Christianity in particular and religion in general and his desire to see a purely secular basis for Flag Group nationalism, was not taken up. Wingfield&#x27;s strategy for growth included recruiting new members at football grounds, a tactic that initially paid dividends.

==Development==
Brons had a history of low-level co-operation with the British National Party whilst he and BNP leader John Tyndall went back to the early 1960s when they were both active in the National Socialist Movement and so not long after the split Brons contacted Stanley Clayton-Garnett, the BNP&#x27;s Northern leader, with a view to closer co-operation. Tyndall and Brons met formally in Leeds in May 1987 to discuss the formation of a &#x27;Nationalist Alliance&#x27; to be organised along the lines of the SDP–Liberal Alliance in existence at the time. A Liaison Committee was set up as a result of this meeting and Brons put the idea to the Flag Group&#x27;s steering committee that same July. The plan however came to nothing as it was rejected by the steering committee and so disavowed by Brons in October 1987. Within the Flag Group it was widely reported that the rejection had happened because of a fear that Tyndall intended only to swallow up the party and make himself sole leader whilst within the BNP it was suggested that the Flag Group&#x27;s Strasserism made them incompatible with the party. It has also been argued that &quot;Flag&quot; editor Martin Wingfield, who published an editorial denouncing notions of merger, sabotaged the move because he bore a grudge against Tyndall and his father-in-law Charles Parker after Wingfiled had attempted, unsuccessfully, to replace the latter as NF organiser in Sussex some years earlier, a struggle that resulted in Wingfield&#x27;s temporary expulsion from the NF. Nonetheless the parties did continue to co-operate unofficially whilst Tom Acton also managed to win support for the Group from the influential publisher Anthony Hancock who had initially favoured the ONF in the split. As well as their monthly newspaper &quot;The Flag&quot; the group also published a monthly magazine &quot;Vanguard&quot; and &quot;Lonheart&quot;, a quarterly.

==Decline==
As a separate group, the Flag Group contested Bristol East in the 1987 general election. By the 1989 Vauxhall by-election, they had resumed using the National Front name, even though their candidate Ted Budden faced opposition from Official National Front candidate Patrick Harrington. Other elections contested included the Epping Forest by-election of December 1988, the European Parliament election of 1989 in which the West Midlands seat was fought by Wingfield and the Mid-Staffordshire by-election of March 1990 in which the party finished behind even parody candidate Screaming Lord Sutch. This policy of contesting elections, invariably with very disappointing results, left the Flag Group with a significant funding shortage. By 1989 the Flag Group had around 1,500 members with most activity centred on the West Midlands. Another activity centre had been Tower Hamlets although following the failure of the &#x27;Nationalist Alliance&#x27; initiative this group, which included future BNP Campaign Director Eddy Butler, switched en bloc to the BNP.

As the 1980s drew to a close, the ONF disintegrated with its place being taken by the International Third Position and the Third Way. This allowed the Flag Group to assume sole control of the name, mantle and traditions of NF and effectively signalled the end of the Flag Group as a name. Soon they would attempt to relaunch the NF as the National Democrats.

<doc id="1057597" wikidata="Q2660706" url="?curid=1057597" title="François Mackandal">
<text>François Mackandal (-) was a Haitian Maroon leader in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti). He is sometimes described as a Haitian vodou priest, or houngan. For joining the Maroons to kill slave owners in Saint-Domingue, he was captured and burned alive by French colonial authorities. His actions were seen as a precursor to the Haitian Revolution.

Haitian historian Thomas Madiou states that Mackandal &quot;had instruction and possessed the Arabic language very well.&quot;
Early sources identify him as coming from the Atlas Mountains which span the Maghreb, but contemporary scholars such as Sylviane Diouf have speculated that he may have been from the modern day nations of Senegal, Mali, or Guinea. According to contemporary accounts of the time, during his interrogation he repeated the Arabic-language Shahada (Muslim testimony of faith) several times and even translated its meaning to his French captors during his interrogation before being condemned to death.

His significance as a leader in the fight for Haitian independence has been immortalized through Haitian currency.

The association of Mackandal with &quot;black magic&quot; seems to be a result of his use of poison, derived from natural plants:
==Biography==
Mackandal created poisons from island herbs. He distributed the poison to slaves, who added it to the meals and refreshments they served the French plantation owners and planters. He became a charismatic guerrilla leader who united the different Maroon bands and created a network of secret organizations connected with slaves still on plantations. According to C.L.R. James, Mackandal had the eloquence to a European orator, differing only in strength and vigor. He led Maroons to raid plantations at night, torch property and kill the owners.

In 1758, the French, fearing that Mackandal would drive all whites from the colony, tortured an ally of Mackandal into divulging information that led to Makandal&#x27;s capture. After six years of planning and building up an organization of black slaves throughout Haiti to poison the French, he was burned at the stake in the center square of Port-au-Prince in front of everyone. However, people from the crowd, particularly the black slaves, believed that Mackandal rose out of the flames and transformed into a winged beast that flew to safety.

Beyond the sketch of historical events outlined above, there is a colorful and varied range of myths about Mackandal. Various supernatural accounts of his execution, and of his escaping capture by the French authorities, are preserved in island folklore and widely depicted in paintings and popular art.

It is speculated that Mackandal lost his right arm in a farming accident when it was caught in a sugarcane press and crushed between the rollers.

== In popular culture ==
One of the most well-known portraits of Mackandal is that in Alejo Carpentier&#x27;s magical realist novel, &quot;The Kingdom of this World&quot;.

Mackandal&#x27;s public torture and execution (via burning at the stake) is depicted vividly in Guy Endore&#x27;s 1934 novel Babouk. Both Mackandal&#x27;s rebel conspiracy and his brutal killing are shown as influential on Babouk (based on Boukman), who helps to lead a 1791 slave revolt.

A fictionalized version of Mackandal also appears in Nalo Hopkinson&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Salt Roads&quot; and in Mikelson Toussaint-Fils&#x27;s novel, &quot;Bloody trails: the Messiah of the islands&quot; (in French, &quot;Les sentiers rouges: Le Messie des iles&quot;).

In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s novel &quot;American Gods&quot;, a boy named Agasu is enslaved in Africa and brought to Haiti, where he eventually loses his arm and leads a rebellion against the European establishment. This account is very similar to Mackandal&#x27;s.

C G S Millworth&#x27;s novel, &quot;Makandal&#x27;s Legacy&quot; tells of Makandal&#x27;s fictional son, Jericho, and the gift of immortality he received as a result of his father&#x27;s pact with the voodoo spirits, the lwa.

The Harvard ethnobotanist and Anthropologist, Wade Davis, writes about Francois Macandal in his novel &quot;The Serpent and the Rainbow.&quot; In the chapter &quot;Tell my Horse&quot; Davis explores the historical beginnings of vodoun culture and speculates Mackandal as a chief propagator of the Vodoun religion.

In the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed III: Liberation&quot;, the character Agaté mentions François Mackandal as having been his Assassin mentor, and also recalls how Mackandal was burned at stake following his failed attempt to poison the colonists of Saint-Domingue. The game portrays a false Mackandal who is actually another character called Baptiste, who according to Agaté was once a brother and has also been trained by the real Mackandal, but betrayed the Assassins following his death. The character uses a Skull face painting and is missing his left arm, which he amputated to impersonate his mentor, although the real Mackandal lost his right arm. Mackandal is also mentioned several times in the prequel game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Rogue&quot; as the mentor of the Saint-Domingue Brotherhood of Assassins, who maintains close relations with the North American Colonial Brotherhood.

<doc id="1057601" wikidata="Q2246697" url="?curid=1057601" title="Quantum field theory in curved spacetime">
<text>In theoretical physics, quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS) is an extension of quantum field theory from Minkowski spacetime to a general curved spacetime. This theory uses a semi-classical approach; it treats spacetime as a fixed, classical background, while giving a quantum-mechanical description of the matter and energy propagating through that spacetime. A general prediction of this theory is that particles can be created by time-dependent gravitational fields (multigraviton pair production), or by time-independent gravitational fields that contain horizons. The most famous example of the latter is the phenomenon of Hawking radiation emitted by black holes.

==Overview==
Ordinary quantum field theories, which form the basis of standard model, are defined in flat Minkowski space, which is an excellent approximation when it comes to describing the behavior of microscopic particles in weak gravitational fields like those found on Earth. In order to describe situations in which gravity is strong enough to influence (quantum) matter, yet not strong enough to require quantization itself, physicists have formulated quantum field theories in curved spacetime. These theories rely on general relativity to describe a curved background spacetime, and define a generalized quantum field theory to describe the behavior of quantum matter within that spacetime.

For non-zero cosmological constants, on curved spacetimes quantum fields lose their interpretation as asymptotic particles. Only in certain situations, such as in asymptotically flat spacetimes (zero cosmological curvature), can the notion of incoming and outgoing particle be recovered, thus enabling one to define an &quot;S&quot;-matrix. Even then, as in flat spacetime, the asymptotic particle interpretation depends on the observer (i.e., different observers may measure different numbers of asymptotic particles on a given spacetime).

Another observation is that unless the background metric tensor has a global timelike Killing vector, there is no way to define a vacuum or ground state canonically. The concept of a vacuum is not invariant under diffeomorphisms. This is because a mode decomposition of a field into positive and negative frequency modes is not invariant under diffeomorphisms. If &#x27;(&quot;t&quot;) is a diffeomorphism, in general, the Fourier transform of exp[&#x27;(&quot;t&quot;)] will contain negative frequencies even if &quot;k&quot; &gt; 0. Creation operators correspond to positive frequencies, while annihilation operators correspond to negative frequencies. This is why a state which looks like a vacuum to one observer cannot look like a vacuum state to another observer; it could even appear as a heat bath under suitable hypotheses.

Since the end of the 1980s, the local quantum field theory approach due to Rudolf Haag and Daniel Kastler has been implemented in order to include an algebraic version of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Indeed, the viewpoint of local quantum physics is suitable to generalize the renormalization procedure to the theory of quantum fields developed on curved backgrounds. Several rigorous results concerning QFT in the presence of a black hole have been obtained. In particular the algebraic approach allows one to deal with the problems mentioned above arising from the absence of a preferred reference vacuum state, the absence of a natural notion of particle and the appearance of unitarily inequivalent representations of the algebra of observables.

==Applications==
Using perturbation theory in quantum field theory in curved spacetime geometry is known as the semiclassical approach to quantum gravity. This approach studies the interaction of quantum fields in a fixed classical spacetime and among other thing predicts the creation of particles by time-varying spacetimes and Hawking radiation. The latter can be understood as a manifestation of the Unruh effect where an accelerating observer observes black body radiation. Other prediction of quantum fields in curved spaces include, for example, the radiation emitted by a particle moving along a geodesic and the interaction of Hawking radiation with particles outside black holes.

This formalism is also used to predict the primordial density perturbation spectrum arising in different models of cosmic inflation. These predictions are calculated using the Bunch–Davies vacuum or modifications thereto.

The theory of quantum field theory in curved spacetime may be considered as an intermediate step towards quantum gravity. QFT in curved spacetime is expected to be a viable approximation to the theory of quantum gravity when spacetime curvature is not significant on the Planck scale. However, the fact that the true theory of quantum gravity remains unknown means that the precise criteria for when QFT on curved spacetime is a good approximation are also unknown.

Gravity is not renormalizable in QFT, so merely formulating QFT in curved spacetime is not a true theory of quantum gravity.

<text>John Beasley Brickhouse (January 24, 1916 – August 6, 1998) was an American sportscaster. Known primarily for his play-by-play coverage of Chicago Cubs games on WGN-TV from 1948 to 1981, he received the Ford C. Frick Award from the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1983. In 1985, Brickhouse was inducted into the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame along with the Voice of the Yankees Mel Allen and Red Sox Voice Curt Gowdy. Brickhouse served as the organization&#x27;s Secretary/Treasurer and was a member of its board of directors.
Brickhouse also called Chicago White Sox games prior to that team leaving WGN in 1968. He covered national events from time to time, including three World Series for NBC television, although the Cubs never got there during his tenure. The voice on the audio track of the famous Willie Mays catch in Game 1 of the 1954 Series at the Polo Grounds belongs to Brickhouse, who was doing the Series along with the New York Giants&#x27; regular broadcaster, Russ Hodges. (Brickhouse had also called Giants games locally in 1946.) Brickhouse called the 1959 Series, which featured the White Sox with Los Angeles Dodgers announcer Vin Scully, and the 1950 Series with Jim Britt. In addition, Brickhouse partnered with fellow baseball broadcaster Mel Allen for NBC coverage of the 1952 Rose Bowl, and with Chris Schenkel for the network&#x27;s coverage of NFL Championship Games in 1956 and 1963.

Brickhouse covered many other events in and outside of sports, such as professional wrestling for WGN and political conventions for the Mutual radio network. From 1953 to 1977 he was the voice of Chicago Bears football on WGN-AM radio, in an unlikely and entertaining pairing with the famous &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gossip columnist Irv Kupcinet. Brickhouse called Chicago Bulls basketball games for WGN-TV from 1966 until 1973, making him the voice of three of the major Chicago sports teams during that period. He was a boxing commentator as well. Fights he worked include the 1949 fight between Jersey Joe Walcott and Ezzard Charles and the 1951 fight between Johnny Bratton and Charley Fusari.

==Biography==

Brickhouse was born in Peoria, Illinois, to Will and Daisy Brickhouse. His father died when Jack was two years old, and he was largely raised by his mother. He started his first job when he was only eleven, delivering the Peoria Journal and Peoria Star, and subsequently attended Peoria Manual High School.

He began his long broadcasting career at eighteen, at Peoria radio station WMBD in 1934. Chicago radio station WGN hired him in 1940 to broadcast Cubs and White Sox games, largely on the recommendation of their top announcer, Bob Elson. Brickhouse served in the U.S. Marine Corps in World War II. He announced White Sox games on WJJD in 1945 but missed the 1945 Cubs season, the only time during his broadcasting career that the Cubs would win the National League pennant. His was the first face seen when WGN-TV, Chicago&#x27;s Channel 9, began broadcasting in 1948. His only pennant as a broadcaster was won by the White Sox in 1959, but neither the 1945 Cubs nor the 1959 Sox won the World Series.

Brickhouse broadcast both Cubs and White Sox games until 1967, because they almost never played at home on the same day. He retired in 1981.

Even in retirement, Brickhouse maintained a high profile as a Cubs and WGN ambassador. He occasionally returned to the booth for special events, such as Wrigley Field&#x27;s annual &quot;70&#x27;s Night&quot;. He also guest-hosted with Harry Caray when the Cubs secured their first postseason berth in 39 years, as they clinched the 1984 National League Eastern Division title in Pittsburgh. The Cubs won the first two games of the League Championship Series at Wrigley, but lost three games to the Padres in San Diego, once again failing to win the pennant (1984 was the last year that the LCS was a best-of-five series). 

Brickhouse hosted a weekly segment on WGN&#x27;s local version of &quot;WCW Pro&quot; in the early 1990s called &quot;Brickhouse&#x27;s Bonus.&quot; In 1990, Brickhouse narrated the retrospective VHS tape, &quot;The Sporting News Presents Baseball in the 80&#x27;s&quot;.

==Broadcasting style==
Brickhouse tried to let the pictures speak for themselves. In contrast, his successor as Cubs announcer, Harry Caray, a radio broadcaster by training, tended to describe the game on TV as if he were doing a radio broadcast. Brickhouse was sparer with his descriptive prose; perhaps not as spare as Vin Scully of the Los Angeles Dodgers, but talking in quick bursts rather than long sentences, knowing that the well-established camera work of WGN-TV and of producer Arne Harris would tell much of the story.

Instead of over-describing the action, &quot;Brick&quot; was more likely to add &quot;flavor&quot; to what was obviously happening, with almost childlike enthusiasm. He would pepper his play-by-play with various old-fashioned expressions, such as &quot;Whew, boy!&quot; after a close play that went the home team&#x27;s way, or &quot;Oh, brother!&quot; when it went the &quot;other&quot; way, or &quot;Wheeeee!&quot; when the team would do something well. During games at Wrigley Field, if the score was tied going into the bottom of the ninth inning, Brickhouse would retort, &quot;Any old kind of a run wins it for the Cubs.&quot;

His best-known expression was &quot;Hey-hey!&quot; after an outstanding play by the home team such as a homer in baseball or a touchdown in football, or even after taking a trick in a card game. But it was when he used it for a home run call that stuck in fans&#x27; memories, and that phrase now vertically adorns the screens on the foul poles at Wrigley Field along with Caray&#x27;s signature expression, &quot;Holy Cow!&quot;

Chicago columnist and lifelong Cubs fan Mike Royko&#x27;s annual Cubs quiz, April 11, 1968, included the following question:
:Q: Quick – When a ball goes over the left field wall, what street does it land on?
:A: Waveland Avenue. But to hear Jack Brickhouse yell, you&#x27;d think it landed in his eye.

(&quot;One More Time: The Best of Mike Royko&quot;, University of Chicago, 1999, p. 29-31)

Some examples of Brickhouse&#x27;s calls:

September 22, 1959; White Sox at Cleveland in the ninth inning of what would be the American League pennant-clinching game.

&quot;[Carroll] Hardy on second, [Jimmy] Piersall on first, and &#x27;dangerous&#x27; Vic Power is up ... one out. Power ... is 1 for 4, an infield single ... there&#x27;s a ground ball ... [Luis] Aparicio has it ... steps on second, throws to first ... The Ball Game&#x27;s over! The White Sox are the Champions of 1959!! a forty-year ... wait has now ended!!!&quot;

May 15, 1960; pitcher Don Cardwell, in his Cub debut, is trying to get the last out of a no-hitter, against the St. Louis Cardinals; the batter is Joe Cunningham, the left fielder is Walt &quot;Moose&quot; Moryn...
* &quot;Watch it now ... Hit on a line to left ... Come on, Moose! ... He caught it! Moryn made a fabulous catch! ... It&#x27;s a no-hitter for Cardwell! ... What a catch that Moryn made; what a catch he made!&quot;

December 15, 1963; Bears defensive back Dave Whitsell makes a game-clinching pick-six interception, defeating Detroit and clinching the Western Conference for the Bears...
* &quot;Here&#x27;s the pass ... picked off by Whitsell! ... He&#x27;s gonna go!! ... He&#x27;s gonna go!!! ... Touchdown!!!! ... Hey-Hey!!!!!&quot;

May 12, 1970; Atlanta&#x27;s Pat Jarvis pitches to &quot;Mr. Cub&quot;, Ernie Banks...
* &quot;Jarvis fires away ... That&#x27;s a fly ball, deep to left, back, back ... That&#x27;s It! Hey-Hey! He did it!! Ernie Banks got number 500!!! The ball tossed to the bullpen ... everybody on your feet ... this ... is it!!!! wheeeeeee!!!!!&quot;


==Illness and death==
On February 27, 1998, Brickhouse fell ill and collapsed while preparing for the funeral of fellow Chicago broadcaster Harry Caray. Following brain surgery on March 3 to remove a blood clot, he quickly improved, making a few on-air appearances in the spring and early summer. Though burdened with a gravelly voice (which he attributed to the surgery and said would soon pass), Brickhouse seemed on the road to recovery until his death on August 6 from cardiac arrest. He was interred at the Rosehill Cemetery and Mausoleum in Chicago.

==Legacy==
Brickhouse was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1998.

His godson Scott Simon followed him into broadcasting.

<text>Montadale is the name of a breed of domestic sheep developed in the 1930s by E. H. Mattingly, a Midwestern commercial lamb buyer who had a dream of developing the ideal sheep. He had been told that the best start to that goal would be to bring together the best characteristics of Midwestern mutton-type sheep and the big Western range sheep. The Montadale is considered a dual-purpose breed, raised for both wool and meat.

Mattingly selected the Cheviot and Columbia breeds as the basis for his project. The Cheviot is a small, hardy sheep developed in Scotland. It is known for its style, correctness, and muscling. The Columbia was developed in Wyoming and Idaho in the early 1900s. It is a large, big-bodied sheep with heavy, good quality fleeces. The average Montadale ram weighs 200 to 275 pounds and the ewe weighs 160 to 180 pounds. 

The first cross of Columbia rams on Cheviot ewes proved to Mattingly that his project was on track. However, he also tried breeding Cheviot rams to Columbia ewes. This cross was even more successful, and was chosen as the foundation for the new breed. Montadale sheep have very white wool and little lanolin, which makes higher wool yields. 

For nine years, the first Montadales were selected and line-bred to develop uniformity in breed characteristics and type. Then, the sheep were exhibited in competitions across the country. The breed quickly attracted the attention of progressive sheep producers. Montadale sheep were first imported to Canada in 1960.

<text>The Gulf of Mannar ( ) (; ) is a large shallow bay forming part of the Laccadive Sea in the Indian Ocean with an average depth of . It lies between the southeastern tip of India and the west coast of Sri Lanka, in the Coromandel Coast region. The chain of low islands and reefs known as Adam’s Bridge or Rama Setu (Rama’s Bridge), which includes Mannar Island, separates the Gulf of Mannar from Palk Bay, which lies to the north between India and Sri Lanka. The estuaries of Thamirabarani River and Vaippar River of South India and the Malvathu Oya (Malvathu River) of Sri Lanka drain into the Gulf. The dugong (sea cow) is found here.

==Conservation==

===Marine sanctuary===

Located on the southeastern tip of the subcontinent, the Gulf of Mannar is known to harbour over 3,600 species of flora and fauna, making it one of the richest coastal regions in Asia. Around 117 hard coral species have been recorded in the Gulf of Mannar. Sea turtles are frequent visitors to the gulf as are sharks, dugongs, and dolphins. However, the combined effects of 47 villages, with a total population of around 50,000 has meant that overharvesting of marine species has become a problem. The decline of fish populations has been accompanied with reducing numbers of pearl oyster, gorgonian coral, and acorn worm. Local fishermen rely on the reef to feed their families, but destructive fishing methods combined with the stress of pollution and coral mining have meant both nearshore and offshore catches have decreased. Endangered species include dolphins, dugongs, whales, and sea cucumbers.

In 1986, a group of 21 islets including Anaipaar Island lying off the Tamil Nadu coast between Thoothukudi and Dhanushkodi was declared the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park. The park and its buffer zone were declared a Biosphere Reserve in 1989.

===Biosphere reserve===
The Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve covers an area of of ocean, 21 islands and the adjoining coastline. The islets and coastal buffer zone include beaches, estuaries, and tropical dry broadleaf forests, while the marine environments include seaweed communities, sea grass communities, coral reefs, salt marshes and mangrove forests.
In May 2019, The National Centre for Coastal Research, an institute under the Ministry of Earth Sciences of India, which has a field research station in the Gulf of Mannar region, found an alarming pattern of bleaching in the reefs in Mandapam, Kilakarai and Palk Bay. Researchers observed a pattern of bleaching in corals when the temperatures rose to between 32 °C and 36 °C ().

==Marine activities==

The Gulf of Mannar is known for its pearl banks of &quot;Pinctada radiata&quot; and &quot;Pinctada fucata&quot; for at least 2,000 years. Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE) praised the pearl fishery of the gulf as one of the most productive in the world. Although extraction of natural pearls is considered too expensive in most parts of the world, it is still carried out in the gulf.

The chief seaports on the Gulf of Mannar are Thoothukudi (Tuticorin) in Tamil Nadu, and Colombo in Sri Lanka. While these ports can accommodate deep-draft vessels, the shallow Palk Strait can only accommodate small shallow-draft vessels. In July 2005, the Indian Government took preliminary steps to go ahead with the Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project, which would create a deep channel linking the Gulf of Mannar to the Bay of Bengal. Project boosters emphasize the benefits of a direct shipping route that connects India&#x27;s east and west coasts without the long trip around Sri Lanka; environmentalists have warned against the grave damage such a project could cause to the sea life and fisheries of the Palk Strait and the Gulf.

<doc id="1057616" wikidata="Q2095090" url="?curid=1057616" title="Unified Parallel C">
<text>Unified Parallel C (UPC) is an extension of the C programming language designed for high-performance computing on large-scale parallel machines, including those with a common global address space (SMP and NUMA) and those with distributed memory (e. g. clusters). The programmer is presented with a single partitioned global address space; where shared variables may be directly read and written by any processor, but each variable is physically associated with a single processor. UPC uses a &quot;single program, multiple data&quot; (SPMD) model of computation in which the amount of parallelism is fixed at program startup time, typically with a single thread of execution per processor.

In order to express parallelism, UPC extends ISO C 99 with the following constructs:

* An explicitly parallel execution model
* A shared address space ( storage qualifier) with thread-local parts (normal variables)
* Synchronization primitives and a memory consistency model
* Explicit communication primitives, e. g. upc_memput
* Memory management primitives

The UPC language evolved from experiences with three other earlier languages that proposed parallel extensions to ISO C 99: AC, Split-C, and Parallel C preprocessor (PCP). UPC is not a superset of these three languages, but rather an attempt to distill the best characteristics of each. UPC combines the programmability advantages of the shared memory programming paradigm and the control over data layout and performance of the message passing programming paradigm.

<doc id="1057630" wikidata="Q2605977" url="?curid=1057630" title="Battle of Dunbar (1650)">
<text>The Battle of Dunbar was fought between the English New Model Army, under Oliver Cromwell, and a Scottish army commanded by David Leslie on 3 September 1650 near Dunbar, Scotland. The battle resulted in a decisive victory for the English. It was the first major battle of the 1650 invasion of Scotland, which was triggered by Scotland&#x27;s acceptance of Charles II as king of Britain after the beheading of his father, Charles I on 30 January 1649.

After Charles I&#x27;s execution, the English Rump Parliament established a republican Commonwealth in England. When their erstwhile ally, Scotland, recognised Charles II as king of all of Britain on 1 May 1650 and began recruiting an army to support him, the English dispatched the New Model Army, under the command of Cromwell. The army crossed into Scotland on 22 July, with a force of over 16,000 men. The Scots withdrew to Edinburgh, stripping the land of provisions. Cromwell attempted to draw the Scots out into a set piece battle, but they resisted, and Cromwell was unable to break through their defensive line. At the end of August, with his army weakened through disease and lack of food, Cromwell withdrew to the port of Dunbar. The Scottish army followed and took up an unassailable position on Doon Hill, overlooking the town. On 2 September, although many of their most experienced men had been dismissed in religious purges, the Scots advanced towards Dunbar and the English took up positions outside the town.

Before dawn on 3 September the English launched a surprise attack on the Scots, who were poorly prepared. The fighting was restricted to the north-eastern flank with the main contingents of English and Scottish cavalry fighting inconclusively, as did the English and Scottish infantry. Due to the terrain Leslie was unable to reinforce the fighting, while Cromwell used his last reserve to outflank the Scots. The Scottish cavalry broke and routed; the Scottish infantry made a fighting retreat but suffered heavy casualties. Between 300 and 500 Scots were killed, approximately 1,000 wounded and at least 6,000 were taken prisoner from an army of 12,500 or fewer.

After the battle, the Scottish government took refuge in Stirling, where Leslie rallied what remained of his army. The English captured Edinburgh and the strategically important port of Leith. In the summer of 1651 the English crossed the Firth of Forth to land a force in Fife; they defeated the Scots at Inverkeithing and so threatened the northern Scottish strongholds. In response, Leslie and Charles II marched the Scottish army south in an unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist supporters in England. The Scottish government, left in an untenable situation, surrendered to Cromwell, who then followed the Scots south. At the Battle of Worcester, precisely one year after the Battle of Dunbar, Cromwell crushed the Scottish army, ending the war.

== Background ==
===First and Second English Civil Wars===
After years of rising tensions, the relationship between the king of England, Charles I, and his English Parliament broke down in armed conflict in 1642, starting the First English Civil War. Charles was also, but separately, king of Scotland. He had gone to war with his Scottish subjects in the Bishops&#x27; Wars in 1639 and 1640. These had arisen from the Scots&#x27; refusal to accept Charles&#x27;s attempts to reform the Scottish Kirk to bring it into line with English religious practices. Charles was not successful in these endeavours and the ensuing settlement established the Covenanters&#x27; hold on Scottish government, requiring all civil office-holders, parliamentarians and clerics to sign the National Covenant and giving the Scottish Parliament the authority to approve all of the king&#x27;s councillors in Scotland.

In England, Charles&#x27;s supporters, the Royalists, were opposed by the combined forces of the English Parliamentarians and the Scots, who in 1643 had formed an alliance bound by the Solemn League and Covenant, in which the English Parliament agreed to reform the English church along similar lines to the Scottish Kirk in return for the Scots&#x27; military assistance. After four years of war the Royalists were defeated. With his capital at Oxford under siege, Charles escaped on 27 April 1646, surrendered to the Scots at Southwell on 5 May and was taken to Newcastle, which was in Scottish hands. The Scots and the English Parliament agreed on a peace settlement which they put before the King. Known as the Newcastle Propositions, it would have required all of the King&#x27;s subjects in Scotland, England and Ireland to sign the Solemn League and Covenant, brought the church in each kingdom into accordance with the Covenant and with Presbyterianism and ceded much of Charles&#x27;s secular authority as king of England to the English Parliament. The Scots spent some months trying to persuade Charles to agree to these terms, but he refused to do so. Eventually, under pressure from the English to withdraw their forces now the war was over, the Scots handed Charles over to the English parliamentary forces in exchange for a financial settlement and left England on 3 February 1647.

Charles then engaged in separate negotiations with different factions. Presbyterian English Parliamentarians and the Scots wanted him to accept a modified version of the Newcastle Propositions, but in June, Cornet George Joyce of the New Model Army seized Charles, and the army council pressed him to accept the Heads of Proposals, a less demanding set of terms which, crucially, did not require a Presbyterian reformation of the church. He rejected these as well and instead signed an offer known as the Engagement, which had been thrashed out with the Scottish delegation, on 26 December. Charles agreed to confirm the Solemn League and Covenant by act of Parliament in both kingdoms and to accept Presbyterianism in England, but only for a trial period of three years, in return for the Scots&#x27; assistance in regaining his throne in England.

When the delegation returned to Edinburgh with the Engagement, the Scots were bitterly divided on whether to accept its terms. Its supporters, who became known as the Engagers, argued that it offered the best chance the Scots would get of acceptance of the Covenant across the three kingdoms and that rejecting it risked pushing Charles to accept the Heads of Proposals. It was opposed by those who believed that to send an army into England on behalf of the King would be to break the Solemn League and Covenant and that it offered no guarantee of a lasting Presbyterian church in England; the Kirk went so far as to issue a declaration on 5 May 1648 that condemned the Engagement as a breach of God&#x27;s law. After a protracted political struggle, the Engagers gained a majority in the Scottish Parliament, by which time war had again broken out in England between Royalists and Parliamentarians. The Scots sent an army under the command of the Duke of Hamilton into England to fight on behalf of the King in July, but it was heavily defeated at Preston by a force led by Oliver Cromwell. The rout of the Engager army led to further political upheaval in Scotland and the faction opposed to the Engagement was able to regain control of the government, with the assistance of a group of English Parliamentary cavalry led by Cromwell.

===Accession of Charles II===

Exasperated by the prolonged bloodshed, the New Model Army purged parliament and established the Rump Parliament, which had Charles tried for treason against the English people; he was executed on 30 January 1649, and the republican Commonwealth was created. The Scottish Parliament, which had not been consulted prior to the King&#x27;s execution, declared his son, also Charles, king of Britain. Before they would permit him to return from exile in the Dutch Republic to take up his crown, they demanded that he first sign both Covenants: recognising the authority of the Kirk in religious matters and that of parliament in civil affairs. Charles II was initially reluctant to accept these conditions, but after Cromwell&#x27;s campaign in Ireland crushed his Royalist supporters there, he felt compelled to accept the Scottish terms and signed the Treaty of Breda on 1 May 1650. The Scottish Parliament set about rapidly recruiting an army to support the new king and Charles set sail to Scotland, landing on 23 June.

Scotland was actively rearming and the leaders of the English Commonwealth felt threatened. They pressured Thomas Fairfax, lord general of the New Model Army, to launch a preemptive attack. Fairfax accepted the commission to lead the army north to defend against the possibility of a Scottish invasion but was unwilling to strike the first blow against his former allies, believing that England and Scotland were still bound by the Solemn League and Covenant. When a formal order to attack came on 20 June, Fairfax resigned his commission. A parliamentary committee which included Cromwell, his close friend, attempted to dissuade him, pleading with him to change his mind, but Fairfax remained resolute and retired from public life. Cromwell succeeded to his office as lord general, becoming commander-in-chief of the New Model Army; he received his commission on 28 June and set out for Scotland the same day.

==Prelude==
Once the Treaty of Breda had been signed, the Scottish Parliament started levying men to form a new army, under the command of David Leslie. Their aim was to increase their forces to 36,000 men, but that number was never achieved; by the time Cromwell entered Scotland, crossing the border near Berwick on July 22, Leslie had some 8,000–9,500 infantry and 2,000–3,000 cavalry, although these numbers fluctuated during the course of the campaign. The government instituted a commission to purge the army of anyone suspected of having supported the Engagement, as well as other men considered sinful or undesirable. This was opposed, unsuccessfully, by much of the Scottish nobility and the experienced military leaders, including Leslie. This purge removed many experienced officers and the bulk of the army was composed of raw recruits with little training or experience.

Leslie prepared a defensive line of earthworks between Edinburgh and Leith and employed a scorched earth policy between that line and the invading English army, allowing Cromwell to advance unopposed. Lack of supplies and the hostility of the local people towards the English invaders, forced Cromwell to rely on a seaborne supply chain and he captured the ports of Dunbar and Musselburgh in order to facilitate this. Operations were hampered by persistent bad weather and the adverse conditions and a shortage of food caused much sickness in the English army, substantially reducing its strength.

Cromwell attempted to bring the Scots to battle at Edinburgh. He advanced on Leslie&#x27;s lines on 29 July, capturing Arthur&#x27;s Seat and bombarding Leith from Salisbury Crags. Cromwell was not able to draw Leslie out and the English retired for the night to Musselburgh; their rest was disturbed by a party of Scottish cavalry raiding their camp in the early hours. Cromwell&#x27;s attack coincided with a visit by Charles II to the Scottish army, where he was warmly received. Members of the Covenanter government, concerned that their Godly war would be corrupted by feelings of personal loyalty to the King, asked Charles II to leave. They then ordered a new purge, which was quickly enacted in early August, removing 80 officers and 4,000 of Leslie&#x27;s men, damaging morale as well as weakening the army&#x27;s strength. 
Throughout August Cromwell continued to try to draw the Scots out from their defences so as to enable a set piece battle. Leslie resisted, ignoring pressure from the secular and religious Scottish hierarchy to attack Cromwell&#x27;s weakened army; he reasoned that the persistent bad weather, the difficult English supply situation and the dysentery and fever that had broken out in the English camp would force Cromwell to withdraw back into England before winter set in.

On 31 August Cromwell did withdraw; the English army reached Dunbar on 1 September, having taken two days to march the from Musselburgh, harassed day and night by the pursuing Scots. The road was left littered with abandoned equipment and the men arrived, according to one of their officers, Captain John Hodgson, as a &quot;poor, shattered, hungry, discouraged army&quot;. The Scottish army outflanked the English, blocking the road to Berwick and England at the easily defended Cockburnspath Defile. Their main force encamped on the Doon Hill, south of Dunbar, where it overlooked the town and the coastal road running south west from the town. The hill was all but invulnerable to direct assault. The English army had lost its freedom of manoeuvre, although they could supply themselves by sea and, if needs be, evacuate the army the same way. On 2 September Cromwell surveyed the situation and wrote to the governor of Newcastle warning him to prepare for a possible Scottish invasion:

== Opposing forces ==
=== Infantry ===
Infantry formations, equipment and tactics were similar in both armies, although the basic formation of the regiment varied greatly in size. An infantry regiment was composed of both musketeers and pikemen. The musketeers were armed with muskets possessing barrels and, mostly, matchlock firing mechanisms. These relied on the glowing end of a length of slow match, thin cord soaked in saltpetre, igniting the weapon&#x27;s priming powder when the trigger was pulled. These were reliable and robust weapons, but their effectiveness was severely reduced in poor weather. In addition, keeping the slow match burning at all times resulted in the consumption of a vast amount, while dowsing it rendered the musket useless. Balancing combat readiness against logistical capability called for fine judgement from a regiment&#x27;s officers. A small number of musketeers on each side were equipped with the more reliable flintlock muskets, known at the time as firelocks. In 1650 musketeer tactics were in the middle of a transition from firing one rank at a time so as to maintain a steady fire, to the entire unit discharging a volley simultaneously for shock effect.
Pikemen were equipped with pikes: long wooden shafts tipped with steel points. Pikes as issued in both armies were long, but on the march they were commonly cut down to a more wieldy or so. The pikemen carried basic swords and typically wore steel helmets but no other armour. Military manuals of the time suggested a ratio of two musketeers for each pikeman, but in practice commanders usually attempted to maximise the number of musketeers and a higher ratio was the rule.

Both armies organised their infantry regiments into brigades of three regiments each, which were typically deployed with two regiments abreast and the third behind as a reserve. Sometimes the two forward regiments of a brigade would amalgamate into a single larger battalia. The men in each unit would form up four or five ranks deep and in a relatively loose formation, with about of frontage per file; so an infantry regiment of 600 might form up 120 men wide and 5 deep, giving it a frontage of and a depth of . The pikemen would be placed in the centre of a formation, in a &quot;stand&quot;, with the musketeers divided on each side. The usual tactic against infantry was for the musketeers to fire on their opponents and once it was thought that they had been sufficiently weakened or demoralised the stand of pikemen would advance, attempting to break through the enemy centre. This was known as a &quot;push of pike&quot;. The musketeers would also advance, engaging the enemy with their musket butts, which were steel-plated for this purpose and attempting to envelop the opposing formation.

Against cavalry, doctrine called for infantry units to tighten the spacing between their files to approximately per man and to advance steadily. To be effective against infantry, cavalry needed to break into their formation and if the men were packed together this was not possible. It was accepted that so long as the morale of the infantry held, cavalry could do little against the front of such a formation. However, the flanks and rear were increasingly vulnerable as the infantry packed more closely together, as this made manoeuvring or turning the unit more difficult.

=== Cavalry ===
Most of the English cavalry were mounted on large, for the time, horses. The cavalrymen wore metal lobster-tailed pot helmets which protected the head and, usually, the neck, cheeks and, to an extent, face. They wore jackets of thick uncured leather and thigh-length boots. Body armoura cuirass (metal chest and back plates)was unusual but not unknown. They were each armed with two pistols and a sword. The pistols were to long and had a very limited effective range. Most but not all cavalry pistols had flintlock firing mechanisms, which were more reliable in damp or windy weather than matchlock mechanisms. Flintlock mechanisms were more expensive than matchlock ones and were usually reserved for the cavalry, who found igniting and using the slow match while controlling a horse inconvenient. The swords were straight, and effective at both cutting and thrusting. Cavalry were usually positioned on each flank of the infantry.

The Scottish cavalry were similarly equipped, with helmets, pistols, swords and no body armour, although their front ranks bore lances rather than pistols. The main difference was that the Scottish horses were smaller and lighter; this gave them greater manoeuvrability but put them at a disadvantage in a face-to-face confrontation. English cavalry tactics were intended to utilise their strengths. They would advance in a tight formation, with their riders&#x27; legs interlocked, at no faster than a trotin order to maintain formation. They would discharge their pistols at very short range and upon coming into contact attempt to use the sheer weight of their mounts and the mass of their formation to force back their opponents and burst through their ranks.

Both armies contained a number of dragoons. These had originated as mounted infantry, using horses to increase their operational mobility and dismounting to fight with pikes or muskets. By 1650 they had largely become specialist mounted troops; none carried pikes. The English dragoons had exchanged their muskets for carbines (shorter-barrelled versions of the infantry&#x27;s muskets) or, occasionally, pistols and been formally recognised as a cavalry arm. Scottish dragoons were partway through this transformation and carried both matchlock muskets and cavalry swords. Dragoons usually acted as scouts, or formed their army&#x27;s rearguard.

=== Artillery ===

The English army possessed about a dozen heavy guns used for sieges which played no part in the battle. The field artillery of both armies, of a variety of calibres from , was immobile once positionedwhere wheeled carriages were provided the wheels were removed before firing. Usually, the guns were allocated two or three to each regiment, to provide direct support, but for this battle, Cromwell massed all of his field artillery in one group. The Scottish artillery was even less mobile than the English and most of it played no part due to the way the battle developed, but a few of the lighter Scottish pieces, attached to individual regiments, saw action. Each gun was served by three crew, although there were a large number of additional auxiliary and men in the artillery trains.

=== Numbers ===

All of the Scottish units were well under their notional complements. There were 22 Scottish infantry regiments present, each with an establishment of about 750 men, but many had been amalgamated due to their low strengths. Only 15 composite formations took part in the battle. They averaged fewer than 700 men each for a total of approximately 9,500 according to Stuart Reid, or 8,000–9,000 according to Richard Brooks. The Scots fielded 19 small cavalry regiments, with a notional aggregate strength of 4,500; in fact they probably totalled fewer than 3,000.

The New Model Army mustered on 22 July 1650, immediately prior to crossing into Scotland. The 8 infantry regiments, notionally of 1,200 men each, totalled 10,249. Their 7 cavalry regiments and several ancillary mounted units were slightly above their complement of 5,400. The artillery component numbered 640, giving the English a total of 16,289 fighting men at this point. By the day of the battle this total had been seriously depleted. The English navy had taken off some 2,000 sick men and an unknown number had died. A proportion of the remainder were ill: Reid gives the total of English lost through sickness since the start of the campaign as 4,000–5,000 and reckons that there were &quot;upwards of 1,000 sick still with the army&quot;. All of those who could would have joined their regiments for the battle. Cromwell states that &quot;as to sound men [...] about 7,500 foot and 3,500 horse&quot;, while the modern historian Trevor Royle estimates that a little over 12,000 were fit for action; Reid gives 12,080.

In addition both sides fielded a number of artillery pieces, but details of the number and calibres have not survived other than that the English had 22 field and siege guns with only the field guns taking part in the battle; and the Scots a total of 32 with most not firing during the action.

===Preparation===

The position of the Scottish army on Doon Hill was tactically sound but would cause logistical problems. So far in the campaign the Scots had experienced difficulty in feeding their army and the small, muddy tracks from Edinburgh could not provide the army with food and slow match for more than a few days. More immediately, the weather was foul and Doon Hill was fully exposed to it. The Scottish position was not sustainable and on 2 September they held a council of war to debate what to do. There is no record of the discussion, nor certainty as to the attendees and survivors gave differing accounts. A number of clerics, plus the government&#x27;s leading lawyer, Archibald Johnston of Wariston, were present and they were enthusiastic for pressing the English hard. Royle, among others, has pointed out that the idea that Leslie was pressured into leaving the security of Doon Hill due to amateur advice from the Covenanter clerics is a myth. Leslie&#x27;s experienced military lieutenants were unanimous that the Scots had the English at a disadvantage and that they should advance against them.

On 2 September the Scots moved off the exposed ridge of Doon Hill. This took most of the day. The English army in turn advanced out of Dunbar and took up defensive positions along the steep north bank of the Brox Burn stream, which roughly paralleled the Doon Hill ridge. From Brand&#x27;s Mill westward this burn formed a significant obstacle against attack for both sides. Both Leslie and Cromwell concentrated their cavalry on the seaward side of Brand&#x27;s Mill, where the Brox Burn was more readily traversable. Leslie deployed much of his light artillery with his cavalry and attempted to also move his infantry to the east. The rough ground and the limited room to manoeuvre between the Brox Burn and the steep northern slope of Doon Hill hampered this and it was incomplete when halted by nightfall.

Cromwell intended to launch a dawn assault against the Scots on 3 September, but the objective of the attack has been debated by historians. After the event Cromwell claimed that the Scots moving down off Doon Hill had presented him with the long-sought opportunity for an open battle which he was quick to seize. The historians Reid and Malcolm Wanklyn believe that Cromwell was attempting to break out and escape along the coast road to England. Reid cites the movement of the baggage train from Dunbar churchyard to Broxmouth House as one indication. This position, in the front line of the army, was, says Reid, &quot;a most extraordinary place&quot; for the baggage train, only explicable by its nearness to the road which would have enabled it to move off promptly if the way could be opened. The alternative view is that Cromwell always planned an all-out assault and a decisive battle; Peter Reese is a proponent, although he states that &quot;the odds against the English ... were awesome&quot;.

In the adverse weather conditions it took the English army all night to reposition in preparation for the planned pre-dawn assault. At about 10:00 pm on 2 September English dragoons probed the Scottish positions. The whole Scottish army and the English withdrew slightly, maintaining patrols to try to ensure that the Scots were unaware of the manoeuvres going on behind them. The Scottish soldier John Nicholl described &quot;a drakie nycht full of wind and weit&quot; (a dark night full of wind and wet) and many Scottish soldiers attempted to shelter in the corn stooks. Their officers scattered across the countryside in search of sounder shelter, their cavalry went foraging and unsaddled most of their horses and Major General James Holborne ordered that the musketeers should extinguish their slow match except for two men per company.

By around 4:00 am the English troops had reached positions approximately where Cromwell intended them to be; none of them had made the mistake in the dark of going too far and alerting the Scots to their manoeuvres. John Lambert&#x27;s brigade of three cavalry regiments was positioned abreast of the road; Robert Lilburne&#x27;s brigade of a further three cavalry regiments was positioned behind it. Thomas Pride&#x27;s infantry brigade of three infantry regiments was to the north west of the cavalry, ready to cross the Brox Burn further downstream at Broxmouth. George Monck, with a slightly smaller force than Pride, was south of the cavalry, in position to cross the Brox Burn upstream of the road ford at Brand&#x27;s Mill. Behind all of these, held in reserve, was Cromwell&#x27;s own Lord General&#x27;s Regiment, reinforced by two companies of dragoons. A little upstream of Brand&#x27;s Mill the English field artillery had set up on a prominent spur where it had a good field of fire into the centre of the Scottish army. To the south west of this concentration Robert Overton&#x27;s three infantry regiments faced the three infantry brigades of the Scottish centre and left. Four companies of dragoons were dispersed in strong pickets along the north bank of the Brox Burn in front of Overton&#x27;s brigade and extending to its right (west).

The Scots were in a conventional line abreast with nearly all of their cavalry concentrated on their right (east) flank. On the extreme left was a force of about 500 cavalry commanded by William Stewart. Next was the Scottish infantry organised in five brigades. These were, from their left (west): 2,000 men under James Holborne; 1,600 men under Colin Pitscottie; John Innes&#x27; brigade of 1,200–1,500; about 2,000 men commanded by James Lumsden; and, facing Brand&#x27;s Mill, James Campbell of Lawers&#x27; 2,000 men. Astride the road and stretching north across the coastal plain were two strong forces of cavalry, totalling approximately 2,500 men, one behind the other. The leading (western) formation was commanded by Robert Montgomerie and the second line by Archibald Strachan. The camp of a small force of dragoons under John Douglas was to the rear of the cavalry, but it is not clear to what extent these troops had been disposed forward as pickets on the night of the battle.

===Night attack===
====Initial assault====
At approximately 4:00 am on 3 September English cavalry advanced to clear the Scottish pickets from the three militarily practicable crossing points of the Brox Burn: Brand&#x27;s Mill, the road ford and north of Broxmouth House. The pickets were driven back and a confused firefight broke out. The rain ceased and the cloud briefly cleared allowing moonlight to illuminate the scene. The artillery of both sides opened fire, although it is not known to what effect. At the first hint of dawn, just after 5:00 am with sunrise at 5:33 am, Lambert&#x27;s cavalry brigade crossed the Brox Burn at the road ford and formed up on the other side unmolested. The English mounts were in good condition and the three regiments advanced in their usual tight formation. Despite the activity during the night, the forward formation of Scottish cavalry was not prepared for action and its commander, Montgomerie, was probably not present. The Scots were taken by surprise, some were still in their tents and they were scattered by the English.

At around the same time Monck pushed his infantry brigade across the Brox Burn at Brand&#x27;s Mill and attacked Lumsden&#x27;s brigade of Scottish infantry. Despite having been engaged when the Brand&#x27;s Ford pickets were driven in shortly before, Lumsden&#x27;s men were in disarray. Reese reports that many of them were new recruits who had only recently joined the brigade. Reid suggests the inexperienced musketeers may have used all of their ammunition during the earlier firefight. Monck&#x27;s musketeers delivered two volleys, receiving little fire in return and charged home alongside their pikemen. The fire of the English field guns enfiladed the Scottish line. There are conflicting and sometimes confused accounts of what happened next. Reid has the Scottish brigade shattering after an ineffectual struggle; Monck&#x27;s troops pursued but were then caught by a counterattack from the next Scottish brigade in lineLawers&#x27;driven back and &quot;completely knocked out of the fight&quot;. According to Reese, Lumsden&#x27;s regiments maintained their cohesion and, reinforced by troops from Lawers&#x27; Brigade, drove Monck back by weight of numbers. Brooks agrees with Reid that Monck&#x27;s men were &quot;overpowered&quot;.
Meanwhile, Lambert&#x27;s cavalry charge came to a halt among the tents of the Scottish cavalrymen, with its formation disordered after pursuing the broken Scottish first line cavalry. As they were regrouping they were charged by Strachan&#x27;s second line cavalry and forced back. Reese points out that it was near dawn, cloudy, misty, there were occasional heavy showers and that great clouds of smoke from cannon and musket fire were drifting across the battlefield: the cumulative effect would have been to greatly restrict visibility and situation awareness. Simultaneously, Lilburne&#x27;s brigade of a further three cavalry regiments had crossed the Brox Burn, formed up and moved to reinforce Lambert. The fighting seems to have broken down into a series of actions scattered across the coastal plain, with the focus slowly moving to the east.

Pride&#x27;s Brigade of three English infantry regiments crossed the Brox Burn north of Broxmouth, wheeled right and marched south, behind the ongoing cavalry melee and reinforced Monck&#x27;s Brigade which was being forced back by the Scottish infantry of Lawers&#x27; Brigade and, possibly, Lumsden&#x27;s. In the confusion Pride&#x27;s regiments came into action piecemeal and the leftmost (Lambert&#x27;s) only engaged stragglers in the vicinity of Little Pinkerton. Leslie had three uncommitted infantry brigades, but they were squeezed between the steep slope of Doon Hill and the Brox Burn and were unable to engage. Cromwell had only his reserve cavalry, the reinforced Lord General&#x27;s Regiment, in hand. The extent to which either commander was aware of the situation on the field is uncertain. According to Hodgson &quot;horse and foot were engaged all over the field&quot;. The battle hung in the balance.

====Outflanking manoeuvre====

As with other aspects of the battle, the sources differ regarding what happened next. Reid and Royle separately write that the Lord General&#x27;s Regiment, led by William Packer, crossed the Brox Burn north of Broxmouth, either alongside or behind Pride&#x27;s Brigade. It then marched south east, got between the sprawling cavalry battle and the coast, on the Scots&#x27; right flank, charged them and set the whole Scottish cavalry force to flight. Wanklyn agrees with this general point but states that it was Pride&#x27;s infantry brigade that led the flank charge. Cromwell and Lambert prevented a pursuit and surveyed the situation while the English cavalry reorganised. At this point the cavalry troopers sang &quot;Psalm 117&quot;. Cromwell ordered his cavalry to the north west, where the infantry struggle was taking place and a unit charged Lawers&#x27; troops in their right flank and their formation collapsed. Hodgson wrote that Lawers&#x27; Brigade &quot;would not yield though at push of pike and butt-end of musket until a troop of horse charged from one end [flank] to another of them&quot;.

In contrast, Reese&#x27;s account has the Lord General&#x27;s Regiment, under Cromwell&#x27;s personal control, following Pride&#x27;s Brigade across the rear of the cavalry battle and deploying to its left (south). From there Cromwell personally directed them into the exposed flank of Lawers&#x27; Brigade at about 7:00 am with the same effect noted above. Meanwhile, the English cavalry gradually got the better of their Scottish counterparts, who broke and scattered. The English cavalry rallied and moved in the general direction of Little Pinkerton.

According to English accounts, Scottish resistance collapsed at this point, with the unengaged Scottish brigades throwing down their weapons and fleeing. Reid points out that as many of the Scottish regiments concerned were fighting again as coherent forces not long after the battle, their withdrawal may have been less panic-stricken than the English recounted. He suggests that Leslie may have been moving the left and centre of his army off the field before Lawers&#x27; resistance collapsed. Holborne&#x27;s and Innes&#x27; Brigades crossed the Brox Burn near what is now Doon Bridge (the bridge did not exist at the time) and withdrew to the east in good order, shielded by Stewart&#x27;s small brigade of cavalry. Pitscottie&#x27;s Brigade covered their retreat and while two of its regiments escaped with few losses, oneWedderburn&#x27;swas all but wiped out; presumably while gaining the time needed for the other surviving Scots to escape. The Scottish cavalry holding Cockburnspath Defile withdrew and joined the defeated Scottish cavalry from their right wing. They rode a wide loop south and then west of Doon Hill and rejoined Leslie&#x27;s main force as it withdrew towards their forward base at Haddington, to the west of the battlefield.
== Aftermath ==
===Casualties===
Sources differ as to Scottish casualties. Cromwell gives figures in his contemporaneous correspondence for the strength of the Scottish army based on all of its units being at full strength and claims to have &quot;killed near four thousand&quot; and captured 10,000 Scots. In Cromwell&#x27;s letters he states that the day after the battle he released between 4,000 and 5,000 of the prisoners. Several modern secondary sources accept these figures; although others dismiss them, with Reid describing them as absurd. The Scottish annalist James Balfour recorded &quot;8 or 900 killed&quot;. The English Royalist Edward Walker has 6,000 prisoners being taken and 1,000 of them being released. From Walker&#x27;s account Reid calculates that fewer than 300 Scots were killed. Brooks uses the known number of Scots wounded, approximately 1,000, to estimate their dead at 300–500. All accounts agree that approximately 5,000 Scottish prisoners were marched south and that 4,000–5,000 Scots survived to retreat towards Edinburgh; over half of them formed bodies of infantry and the balance cavalry or stragglers. English casualties were low, with Cromwell variously giving them as &quot;not twenty men&quot; or 30–40 killed.

The prisoners were taken to England and 3,000 were imprisoned at Durham Cathedral; many died on the march south, or in captivity. In September 2015 archaeologists announced that skeletons found in mass graves near Durham Cathedral were the remains of Scottish soldiers taken prisoner after the battle. The archaeological evidence appeared to show that the bodies had been tipped into a mass grave with no signs of ceremony. At least some of those who survived were deported to become indentured workers on English possessions overseas.

===Scottish response===
When the Scottish government learned of the defeat many people fled Edinburgh in panic, but Leslie sought to rally what remained of his army and build a new defensive line at Stirling, where he was joined by the bulk of the government, clergy and Edinburgh&#x27;s mercantile elite. Cromwell dispatched Lambert to capture Edinburgh, while he marched on the port of Leith, which offered much better facilities for landing supplies and reinforcements than Dunbar. Without Leslie&#x27;s army to defend them, both were captured with little difficulty. Cromwell took pains to persuade the citizens that his war was not with them; he promised that their property would be respected and allowed them to come and go freely, hold markets and observe their usual religious services, although the latter was restricted as most of the clergy had removed to Stirling. He also took steps to secure food for the city, which by this point was short on supplies. Edinburgh Castle held out until December, but since it was cut off from reinforcement and supplies and offered no threat, Cromwell did not assault it and treated its commander with courtesy. The historian Austin Woolrych described the behaviour of the occupying troops as &quot;exemplary&quot; and observed that after a short time many fugitives returned to the city and its economic life returned to something akin to normality.

The defeat at Dunbar caused great damage to Leslie&#x27;s reputation and authority. He attempted to resign as head of the army, but the Scottish government would not permit it, largely because of a lack of any plausible replacement. Several of his officers, however, refused to take orders from him, left Leslie&#x27;s forces and joined a new army that was being raised by the Western Association.

Divisions already present in the Scottish government were widened by the new situation. The more practical faction believed that the purges were to blame for Leslie&#x27;s defeat and looked to bring the Engagers back into the fold; the more dogmatic thought that God had deserted them because the purges had not gone far enough and argued that too much faith had been put in Charles II who was not sufficiently committed to the cause of the Covenant. These more radical elements issued the divisive Western Remonstrance, which castigated the government for its failure to properly purge the army and further widened the rifts amongst the Scots. The Remonstrants, as this group became known, took command of the Western Association army and attempted to negotiate with Cromwell, urging him to depart Scotland and leave them in control; Cromwell rejected their advances and destroyed their army at the Battle of Hieton (near the centre of modern Hamilton) on 1 December.

During December Charles and the Scottish government started to draw together what remained of Leslie&#x27;s forces, as well as the Engagers who had been purged from it and Highland chiefs who had been excluded by their refusal to sign the Covenant. These competing factions were poorly coordinated and even when Cromwell fell ill in early 1651 and was unable to take to the field, they were unable to take effective action. It was not until the late spring of that year that the Scots were able to piece their army together.

===English conquest===

A breakthrough was made when English forces, commanded by Lambert, managed to land in Fife and, on 20 July, capture Inverkeithing. This allowed the English army to threaten both Stirling and Perth, while Leslie&#x27;s men, faced with impending total defeat, started to desert in great numbers. Confident that he would be able to defeat what remained of the Scottish forces, Cromwell, by now returned to health, deliberately left the path from Stirling to England undefended. Charles II and Leslie, presented with little other option if they were not to surrender, went south on 31 July in a desperate bid to raise Royalist support in England. By this time they had only around 12,000 men, who were very short of firearms. They attempted to muster what Royalist support they could on their march through England, but little was forthcoming.

With Leslie and the army gone, Scotland was exposed to the English forces: the Scottish government, now in Perth, surrendered to Cromwell two days after Charles and Leslie left Stirling. Cromwell and Lambert then went south, to shadow the Scottish army, leaving Monck to mop up what little resistance remained. By the end of August, Monck had captured Stirling, Alyth and St Andrews. Dundee, the last significant Scottish stronghold, fell on 1 September.

Cromwell and his forces overtook the Scottish army at Worcester and on 3 September 1651 utterly defeated them. Leslie, along with most of the Royalist commanders, was captured; he was imprisoned in the Tower of London and would remain there until the 1660 Restoration. Charles II himself managed to escape the field. The historian Barry Coward wrote &quot;It was a divided enemy that Cromwell fought after Dunbar and decisively defeated at Worcester, exactly a year after Dunbar.&quot; The Scottish Covenanter government was abolished and the English commanders imposed military rule.

==Dunbar medal==
Parliament struck the Dunbar Medal for the combatants, in gold for officers and silver for men. It has been claimed to be the first campaign medal to be granted to all ranks of an army and was worn by a cord or chain around the neck. Thomas Simon was dispatched to Edinburgh to create the Lord General&#x27;s likeness. The medal shows a profile head of Cromwell and the army&#x27;s battle cry on the day, &quot;The Lord of Hosts&quot; and on the other face a view of Parliament.

==Battlefield today==
The battle has traditionally been known as the Battle of Dunbar after the closest parish to the area where the fighting took place, but at least one contemporary source refers to it as the Battle of Broxmouth, after another nearby settlement. The locations which saw action have been designated by Historic Environment Scotland in its Inventory of Historic Battlefields as a battlefield of national importance. The areas covered by the designation include: the summit and slopes of Doon Hill, where the Scots were initially deployed; Broxmouth House and its grounds and the southern part of Dunbar, where the English forces were encamped; the Brox Burn and lands around it, as the general location of the main battle; and Meikle Pinkerton Farm and the lands around it, where the Scottish right flank was deployed. Quarrying in the eastern part of the battlefield, which started in the early 19th century and continues today, has destroyed much of the landscape that was present in 1650 and further damage has been done by the construction of the Main Line railway and the A1 road, but a significant portion of the original landscape survives intact within the grounds of Broxburn House. The location of the English camp has probably been lost beneath the urban development of Dunbar. No artefacts from the battle are known to have been discovered, but Historic Environment Scotland considers it likely that shot and graves may be discovered there by future investigations; the only grave associated with the battle known to exist at the site is that of Sir William Douglas in the grounds of Broxmouth House.

<text>The Second English Civil War took place between February and August 1648 in England and Wales. It forms part of the series of conflicts known collectively as the 1639–1653 Wars of the Three Kingdoms, which include the 1641–1653 Irish Confederate Wars, the 1639–1640 Bishops&#x27; Wars, and the 1649–1653 Cromwellian conquest of Ireland.

Following his defeat in the First English Civil War, in May 1646 Charles I surrendered to the Scots Covenanters, rather than Parliament. By doing so, he hoped to exploit divisions between English and Scots Presbyterians, and English Independents. At this stage, all parties expected Charles to continue as king, which combined with their internal divisions, allowed him to refuse significant concessions. When the Presbyterian majority in Parliament failed to disband the New Model Army in late 1647, many joined with the Scottish Engagers in an agreement to restore Charles to the English throne.

The subsequent Scottish invasion was supported by Royalist risings in South Wales, Kent, Essex and Lancashire, along with sections of the Royal Navy. However, these were poorly co-ordinated and by the end of August 1648, they had been defeated by forces under Oliver Cromwell and Thomas Fairfax. This led to the execution of Charles I in January 1649 and establishment of the Commonwealth of England, after which the Covenanters crowned his son Charles II King of Scotland, leading to the 1650 to 1652 Anglo-Scottish War.

==Background==

Charles I ruled the three separate kingdoms of Scotland, Ireland and England in a personal union. Thus the conflicts that started in 1639 and lasted until 1653 are known as the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The 1639 and 1640 Bishops&#x27; Wars began when Charles attempted to bring the Church of Scotland, &quot;the Kirk&quot;, into line with reforms recently enacted within the Church of England. Known as Laudianism, these changes were opposed by English Puritans and the vast majority of Scots, many of whom signed the National Covenant pledging to preserve the Kirk by force of arms. Known as Covenanters, their victory in the Bishops&#x27; Wars confirmed their control of Scotland and provided momentum for the king&#x27;s opponents in England. The Covenanters passed laws that required all civil office-holders, MPs and clerics to sign the Covenant, and gave Parliament the right to approve all Royal councillors in Scotland.

Tensions about religion and the governance of the nation were also rising in England. All parties agreed a &#x27;well-ordered&#x27; monarchy was divinely mandated, but they disagreed on what &#x27;well-ordered&#x27; meant, particularly with regards to the balance of power between king and Parliament, and on the question of where ultimate authority in clerical affairs lay. Royalists generally supported a Church of England governed by bishops, appointed by, and answerable to, the king; Parliamentarians believed he ought to be answerable to the leaders of the church, who should be appointed by their congregations. The relationship between Charles and his English Parliament eventually broke down entirely, resulting in the outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642.

In England, Charles&#x27;s supporters, the Royalists, were opposed by the combined forces of the Parliamentarians and the Scots. In 1643 the latter pair formed an alliance bound by the Solemn League and Covenant, in which the English Parliament agreed to reform the English church along similar lines to the Scottish Kirk in return for the Scots&#x27; military assistance. After four years of war the Royalists were defeated and Charles surrendered to the Scots on 5 May 1646. The Scots agreed with the English Parliament on a peace settlement which would be put before the king. Known as the Newcastle Propositions, it would have required all the king&#x27;s subjects in Scotland, England and Ireland to sign the Solemn League and Covenant, brought the church in each kingdom into accordance with the Covenant and with Presbyterianism, and ceded much of Charles&#x27;s secular authority as king of England to the English Parliament. The Scots spent some months trying to persuade Charles to agree to these terms, but he refused to do so. Under pressure from the English to withdraw their forces now the war was over, the Scots handed Charles over to the English Parliamentary forces in exchange for a financial settlement and left England on 3 February 1647.
In England, Parliament was struggling with the economic cost of the war, a poor 1646 harvest, and a recurrence of the plague. The moderate Presbyterian faction led by Denzil Holles dominated Parliament and was supported by the London Trained Bands, the Army of the Western Association, leaders like Rowland Laugharne in Wales, and elements of the English navy. By March 1647, the New Model Army was owed more than £3 million in unpaid wages; Parliament ordered it to Ireland, stating only those who agreed to go would be paid. When their representatives demanded full payment for all in advance, it was ordered that it be disbanded, but its leaders refused to do so.

Charles now engaged in separate negotiations with different factions. Presbyterian English Parliamentarians and the Scots wanted him to accept a modified version of the Newcastle Propositions, but in June 1647, Cornet George Joyce of the New Model Army seized Charles, and the army council pressed him to accept the Heads of Proposals, a less demanding set of terms which, crucially, did not require a Presbyterian reformation of the church. On 26 July pro-Presbyterian rioters burst into Parliament, demanding that Charles be invited to London; fearing that the king might be restored without concessions, the New Model Army took control of the city in early August, while the Army Council re-established their authority over the rank and file by suppressing the Corkbush Field mutiny. The Eleven Members of Parliament whom the army identified as opposed to its interests were removed forcibly, and on 20 August Oliver Cromwell brought a regiment of cavalry to Hyde Park, rode with an escort to Parliament and pushed through the Null and Void Ordinance, leading to the Presbyterian MPs withdrawing from Parliament. Charles eventually rejected the Heads of Proposals, and instead signed an offer known as the Engagement, which had been thrashed out with the Scottish delegation, on 26 December 1647. Charles agreed to confirm the Solemn League and Covenant by Act of Parliament in both kingdoms, and to accept Presbyterianism in England, but only for a trial period of three years, in return for the Scots&#x27; assistance in regaining his throne in England.

When the delegation returned to Edinburgh with the Engagement, the Scots were bitterly divided on whether to ratify its terms. Its supporters, who became known as the Engagers, argued that it offered the best chance the Scots would get of acceptance of the Covenant across the three kingdoms, and that rejecting it risked pushing Charles to accept the Heads of Proposals. It was opposed by those who believed that to send an army into England on behalf of the king would be to break the Solemn League and Covenant, and that it offered no guarantee of a lasting Presbyterian church in England; the Kirk went so far as to issue a declaration on 5 May 1648 condemning the Engagement as a breach of God&#x27;s law. After a protracted political struggle, the Engagers gained a majority in the Scottish Parliament, and it was accepted.

==South Wales==

Wales was a sensitive area, since most of it had been Royalist during the war, while Harlech Castle was the last of their strongpoints to surrender in March 1647. The interception of secret messages between Charles and the Irish Confederacy made it important to secure ports like Cardiff and Milford Haven, since they controlled shipping routes with Ireland. The Army Council viewed the local commanders, John Poyer and Rowland Laugharne, with suspicion, since they supported the Parliamentarian moderates. In July, Horton was sent to replace Laugharne, and secure these positions.

The revolt began in Pembrokeshire, an area controlled by Parliament since early 1643. Like their New Model colleagues, the soldiers had not been paid for months, and feared being disbanded without their wages. In early March, Poyer, Governor of Pembroke Castle, refused to relinquish command; he was soon joined by Rice Powell, who commanded Tenby Castle, then by Laugharne. What began as a dispute over pay turned political when the Welsh rebels made contact with Charles. Most Royalists had sworn not to bear arms against Parliament and did not participate, one exception being Nicholas Kemeys, who held Chepstow Castle for the king. By the end of April, Laugharne had assembled around 8,000 troops, and was marching on Cardiff, but was defeated at St Fagans on 8 May.

This ended the revolt as a serious threat, although Pembroke Castle did not surrender until 11 July, with a minor rising in North Wales suppressed at Y Dalar Hir in June and Anglesey retaken from the rebels in early October. The Welsh rising is generally not considered part of a planned, Royalist plot, but largely accidental; however, its retention was vital for future operations in Ireland.

==Revolt against Parliament in Kent==

A precursor to Kent&#x27;s Second Civil War had come on Wednesday, 22 December 1647, when Canterbury&#x27;s town crier had proclaimed the county committee&#x27;s order for the suppression of Christmas Day and its treatment as any other working day. However, a large crowd gathered on Christmas to demand a church service, decorate doorways with holly bushes, and keep the shops shut. This crowd – under the slogan &quot;For God, King Charles, and Kent&quot; – then descended into violence and riot, with a soldier being assaulted, the mayor&#x27;s house attacked, and the city under the rioters&#x27; control for several weeks until forced to surrender in early January.

On 21 May 1648, Kent rose in revolt in the King&#x27;s name, and a few days later a most serious blow to the Independents was struck by the defection of the Navy, from command of which they had removed Vice-Admiral William Batten, as being a Presbyterian. Though a former Lord High Admiral, the Earl of Warwick, also a Presbyterian, was brought back to the service, it was not long before the Navy made a purely Royalist declaration and placed itself under the command of the Prince of Wales. But Fairfax had a clearer view and a clearer purpose than the distracted Parliament. He moved quickly into Kent, and on the evening of 1 June, stormed Maidstone by open force, after which the local levies dispersed to their homes, and the more determined Royalists, after a futile attempt to induce the City of London to declare for them, fled into Essex.

===The Downs===
Before leaving for Essex, Fairfax delegated command of the Parliamentarian forces to Colonel Nathaniel Rich to deal with the remnants of the Kentish revolt in the east of the county, where the naval vessels in the Downs had gone over to the Royalists and Royalist forces had taken control of the three previously Parliamentarian &quot;castles of the Downs&quot; (Walmer, Deal, and Sandown) and were trying to take control of Dover Castle. Rich arrived at Dover on 5 June 1648 and prevented the attempt, before moving to the Downs. He took almost a month to retake Walmer (15 June to 12 July), before moving on to Deal and Sandown castles. Even then, due to the small size of Rich&#x27;s force, he was unable to surround both Sandown and Deal at once and the two garrisons were able to send help to each other. At Deal he was also under bombardment from the Royalist warships, which had arrived on 15 July but been prevented from landing reinforcements. On the 16th, thirty Flemish ships arrived with about 1500 mercenaries and – though the ships soon left when the Royalists ran out of money to pay them – this incited sufficient Kentish fear of foreign invasion to allow Michael Livesey to raise a large enough force to come to Colonel Rich&#x27;s aid.

On 28 July, the Royalist warships returned and, after three weeks of failed attempts to land a relief force at Deal, on the night of 13 August managed to land 800 soldiers and sailors under cover of darkness. This force might have been able to surprise the besieging Parliamentarian force from the rear had it not been for a Royalist deserter who alerted the besiegers in time to defeat the Royalists, with less than a hundred of them managing to get back to the ships (though 300 managed to flee to Sandown Castle). Another attempt at landing soon afterwards also failed and, when on 23 August news was fired into Deal Castle on an arrow of Cromwell&#x27;s victory at Preston, most Royalist hope was lost and two days later Deal&#x27;s garrison surrendered, followed by Sandown on 5 September. This finally ended the Kentish rebellion. Rich was made Captain of Deal Castle, a position he held until 1653 and in which he spent around £500 on repairs.

==Revolt elsewhere==
In Cornwall, Northamptonshire, North Wales, and Lincolnshire the revolt collapsed as easily as that in Kent. Only in South Wales, Essex, and the north of England was there serious fighting. In the first of these districts, South Wales, Cromwell rapidly reduced all the fortresses except Pembroke. Here Laugharne, Poyer, and Powel held out with the desperate courage of deserters.
In the north, Pontefract Castle was surprised by the Royalists, and shortly afterwards Scarborough Castle declared for the King as well. Fairfax, after his success at Maidstone and the pacification of Kent, turned northward to reduce Essex, where, under their ardent, experienced, and popular leader Charles Lucas, the Royalists were in arms in great numbers. Fairfax soon drove Lucas into Colchester, but the first attack on the town was repulsed and he had to settle down to a long and wearisome siege.

A Surrey rising is remembered for the death of the young and gallant Lord Francis Villiers, younger brother of George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, in a skirmish at Kingston (7 July 1648). The rising collapsed almost as soon as it had gathered force, and its leaders, the Duke of Buckingham and Henry Rich, the Earl of Holland, escaped, after another attempt to induce London to declare for them, to St Albans and St Neots, where Holland was taken prisoner. Buckingham escaped overseas.

==Lambert in the north==
Major-General John Lambert, a brilliant young Parliamentarian commander of twenty-nine, was more than equal to the situation. He left the sieges of Pontefract Castle and Scarborough Castle to Colonel Edward Rossiter, and hurried into Cumberland to deal with the English Royalists under Marmaduke Langdale. With his cavalry, Lambert got into touch with the enemy about Carlisle and slowly fell back to Bowes and Barnard Castle. Lambert fought small rearguard actions to annoy the enemy and gain time. Langdale did not follow him into the mountains. Instead, he occupied himself in gathering recruits, supplies of material, and food for the advancing Scots.

Lambert, reinforced from the Midlands, reappeared early in June and drove Langdale back to Carlisle with his work half finished. About the same time, the local cavalry of Durham and Northumberland were put into the field for the Parliamentarians by Arthur Hesilrige, governor of Newcastle. On 30 June, under the direct command of Colonel Robert Lilburne, these mounted forces won a considerable success at the River Coquet.

This reverse, coupled with the existence of Langdale&#x27;s Royalist force on the Cumberland side, practically compelled Hamilton to choose the west coast route for his advance. His Scottish Engager army began slowly to move down the long couloir between the mountains and the sea. The Campaign of Preston which followed is one of the most brilliant in English history.

==Campaign of Preston==
On 8 July 1648, when the Scottish Engager army crossed the border in support of the English Royalists, the military situation was well defined. For the Parliamentarians, Cromwell besieged Pembroke in West Wales, Fairfax besieged Colchester in Essex, and Colonel Rossiter besieged Pontefract and Scarborough in the north. On 11 July, Pembroke fell and Colchester followed on 28 August. Elsewhere the rebellion, which had been put down by rapidity of action rather than sheer weight of numbers, smouldered, and Charles, the Prince of Wales, with the fleet cruised along the Essex coast. Cromwell and Lambert, however, understood each other perfectly, while the Scottish commanders quarrelled with each other and with Langdale.

As the English uprisings were close to collapse, Royalist hopes centred on the Engager Scottish army. It was not the same veteran army of the Earl of Leven, which had long been disbanded. For the most part it consisted of raw levies. The Kirk party had refused to sanction the Engagement (an agreement between Charles I and the Scots Parliament for the Scots to intervene in England on behalf of Charles), causing David Leslie and thousands of experienced officers and men to decline to serve. The leadership of the Duke of Hamilton proved to be poor and his army was so ill provided for that as soon as England was invaded it began to plunder the countryside for sustenance.

On 8 July the Scots, with Langdale leading an advance guard, were near Carlisle, and reinforcements from Ulster were expected daily. Lambert&#x27;s cavalry were at Penrith, Hexham and Newcastle, too weak to fight and having only skillful leading and rapidity of movement to enable them to gain time. Appleby Castle surrendered to the Scots on 31 July, whereat Lambert, who was still hanging on to the flank of the Scottish advance, fell back from Barnard Castle to Richmond so as to close Wensleydale against any attempt of the invaders to march on Pontefract. All the restless energy of Langdale&#x27;s cavalry were unable to dislodge Lambert from the passes or to find out what was behind that impenetrable cavalry screen. The crisis was now at hand. Cromwell had received the surrender of Pembroke Castle on 11 July, and had marched off, with his men unpaid, ragged and shoeless, at full speed through the Midlands. Rains and storms delayed his march, but he knew that the Duke of Hamilton in the broken ground of Westmorland was still worse off. Shoes from Northampton and stockings from Coventry met him at Nottingham, and gathering up the local levies as he went, he made for Doncaster, where he arrived on 8 August, having gained six days in advance of the time he had allowed himself for the march. He then called up artillery from Hull, exchanged his local levies for the regulars who were besieging Pontefract, and set off to meet Lambert. On 12 August he was at Wetherby, Lambert at Otley, Langdale at Skipton and Gargrave, Hamilton at Lancaster, and George Monro with the Scots from Ulster and the Carlisle Royalists (organized as a separate command owing to friction between Monro and the generals of the main army) at Hornby. On 13 August, while Cromwell was marching to join Lambert at Otley, the Scottish leaders were still disputing whether they should make for Pontefract or continue through Lancashire so as to join Lord Byron and the Cheshire Royalists.

===Battle of Preston===

On 14 August 1648 Cromwell and Lambert were at Skipton, on 15 August at Gisburn, and on 16 August they marched down the valley of the Ribble towards Preston with full knowledge of the enemy&#x27;s dispositions and full determination to attack him. They had with them troops from both the Army and the militias of Yorkshire, Durham, Northumberland and Lancashire, and were heavily outnumbered, having only 8,600 men against perhaps 20,000 of Hamilton&#x27;s command. But the latter were scattered for convenience of supply along the road from Lancaster, through Preston, towards Wigan, Langdale&#x27;s corps having thus become the left flank guard instead of the advanced guard.

Langdale called in his advanced parties, perhaps with a view to resuming the duties of advanced guard, on the night of 13 August, and collected them near Longridge. It is not clear whether he reported Cromwell&#x27;s advance, but, if he did, Hamilton ignored the report, for on 17 August Monro was half a day&#x27;s march to the north, Langdale east of Preston, and the main army strung out on the Wigan road, Major-General William Baillie with a body of foot, the rear of the column, being still in Preston. Hamilton, yielding to the importunity of his lieutenant-general, James Livingston, 1st Earl of Callendar, sent Baillie across the Ribble to follow the main body just as Langdale, with 3,000 infantry and 500 cavalry, met the first shock of Cromwell&#x27;s attack on Preston Moor. Hamilton, like Charles at Edgehill, passively shared in, without directing, the Battle of Preston, and, though Langdale&#x27;s men fought fiercely, they were driven to the Ribble after four hours&#x27; struggle.

Baillie attempted to cover the Ribble and Darwen bridges on the Wigan road, but Cromwell had forced his way across both before nightfall. Pursuit was at once undertaken, and not relaxed until Hamilton had been driven through Wigan and Winwick to Uttoxeter and Ashbourne. There, pressed furiously in rear by Cromwell&#x27;s cavalry and held up in front by the militia of the midlands, the remnant of the Scottish army laid down its arms on 25 August. Various attempts were made to raise the Royalist standard in Wales and elsewhere, but Preston was the death-blow. On 28 August, starving and hopeless of relief, the Colchester Royalists surrendered to Lord Fairfax.

==Execution of Charles I==
The victors in the Second Civil War were not merciful to those who had brought war into the land again. On the evening of the surrender of Colchester, Charles Lucas and George Lisle were shot. Laugharne, Poyer and Powel were sentenced to death, but Poyer alone was executed on 25 April 1649, being the victim selected by lot. Of five prominent Royalist peers who had fallen into the hands of Parliament, three, the Duke of Hamilton, the Earl of Holland, and Lord Capel, one of the Colchester prisoners, were beheaded at Westminster on 9 March. Above all, after long hesitations, even after renewal of negotiations, the Army and the Independents conducted &quot;Pride&#x27;s Purge&quot; of the House removing their ill-wishers, and created a court for the trial and sentence of King Charles I. At the end of the trial the 59 Commissioners (judges) found Charles I guilty of high treason, as a &quot;tyrant, traitor, murderer and public enemy&quot;. He was beheaded on a scaffold in front of the Banqueting House of the Palace of Whitehall on 30 January 1649. After the Restoration in 1660, the regicides who were still alive and not living in exile were either executed or sentenced to life imprisonment.

==Capitulation of Pontefract Castle==

Pontefract Castle was noted by Oliver Cromwell as &quot;[...] one of the strongest inland garrisons in the kingdom&quot;. Even in ruins, the castle held out in the north for the Royalists. Upon the execution of Charles I, the garrison recognised Charles II as king and refused to surrender. On 24 March 1649, almost two months after Charles was beheaded, the garrison of the last Royalist stronghold finally capitulated. Parliament had the remains of the castle demolished the same year.

== Aftermath ==

Following Charles&#x27;s execution, the Commonwealth of England was established. In Scotland, Charles II became the new king, the resulting tensions leading to the Anglo-Scottish War of 1650 to 1652.

<text>In differential geometry, the Einstein tensor (named after Albert Einstein; also known as the trace-reversed [[Ricci curvature|Ricci tensor]]) is used to express the curvature of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. In general relativity, it occurs in the Einstein field equations for gravitation that describe spacetime curvature in a manner that is consistent with conservation of energy and momentum.

== Definition ==
The Einstein tensor formula_1 is a tensor of order 2 defined over pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. In index-free notation it is defined as
formula_2
where formula_3 is the Ricci tensor, formula_4 is the metric tensor and formula_5 is the scalar curvature, which is computed as the trace of the Ricci tensor formula_6 by . In component form, the previous equation reads as
formula_7

The Einstein tensor is symmetric
formula_8
and, like the on shell stress–energy tensor, has zero divergence:
formula_9

== Explicit form ==
The Ricci tensor depends only on the metric tensor, so the Einstein tensor can be defined directly with just the metric tensor. However, this expression is complex and rarely quoted in textbooks. The complexity of this expression can be shown using the formula for the Ricci tensor in terms of Christoffel symbols:
formula_10
where formula_11 is the Kronecker tensor and the Christoffel symbol formula_12 is defined as
formula_13
and terms of the form formula_14 or formula_15 represent partial derivatives in the &quot;μ&quot;-direction, e.g.:
formula_16

Before cancellations, this formula results in formula_17 individual terms. Cancellations bring this number down somewhat.

In the special case of a locally inertial reference frame near a point, the first derivatives of the metric tensor vanish and the component form of the Einstein tensor is considerably simplified:

formula_18
where square brackets conventionally denote antisymmetrization over bracketed indices, i.e.
formula_19

== Trace ==
The trace of the Einstein tensor can be computed by contracting the equation in the definition with the metric tensor . In formula_20 dimensions (of arbitrary signature):
formula_21

Therefore, in the special case of {{tmath|1= n = 4 }} dimensions, {{tmath|1= G = -R }}. That is, the trace of the Einstein tensor is the negative of the Ricci tensor&#x27;s trace. Thus, another name for the Einstein tensor is the &quot;trace-reversed Ricci tensor&quot;. This formula_22 case is especially relevant in the theory of general relativity.

== Use in general relativity ==

The Einstein tensor allows the Einstein field equations to be written in the concise form:
formula_23
where formula_24 is the cosmological constant and formula_25 is the Einstein gravitational constant.

From the explicit form of the Einstein tensor, the Einstein tensor is a nonlinear function of the metric tensor, but is linear in the second partial derivatives of the metric. As a symmetric order-2 tensor, the Einstein tensor has 10 independent components in a 4-dimensional space. It follows that the Einstein field equations are a set of 10 quasilinear second-order partial differential equations for the metric tensor.

The contracted Bianchi identities can also be easily expressed with the aid of the Einstein tensor:
formula_26

The (contracted) Bianchi identities automatically ensure the covariant conservation of the stress–energy tensor in curved spacetimes:
formula_27

The physical significance of the Einstein tensor is highlighted by this identity. In terms of the densitized stress tensor contracted on a Killing vector {{tmath|1= \xi^\mu }}, an ordinary conservation law holds:
formula_28

== Uniqueness ==
{{see also|Lovelock&#x27;s theorem}}
David Lovelock has shown that, in a four-dimensional differentiable manifold, the Einstein tensor is the only tensorial and divergence-free function of the formula_29 and at most their first and second partial derivatives.

However, the Einstein field equation is not the only equation which satisfies the three conditions: 
# Resemble but generalize Newton–Poisson gravitational equation
# Apply to all coordinate systems, and
# Guarantee local covariant conservation of energy–momentum for any metric tensor.

Many alternative theories have been proposed, such as the Einstein–Cartan theory, that also satisfy the above conditions.

<doc id="1057641" wikidata="Q1422332" url="?curid=1057641" title="Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica">
<text>Saint Thomas, once known as &quot;Saint Thomas in the East&quot;, is a suburban parish situated at the south eastern end of Jamaica, within the county of Surrey. It is the birthplace of Paul Bogle, designated in 1969 as one of Jamaica&#x27;s seven National Heroes. Morant Bay, its chief town and capital, is the site of the Morant Bay Rebellion in 1865, of which Bogle was a leader.

Representative George William Gordon, a wealthy mixed race businessman and politician from this district, was tried and executed in 1865 under martial law on suspicion of directing the rebellion. Governor Eyre was forced to resign due to the controversy over his execution of Gordon and violent suppression of the rebellion. Gordon was designated in 1969 as a National Hero.

==Brief history==
Saint Thomas was densely populated by the Taíno/Arawak when Christopher Columbus first came to the island in 1494. The Spaniards established cattle ranches at Morant Bay and Yallahs. In 1655, when the English captured Jamaica, they organised their new territory into a number of parishes. This was when Saint Thomas Parish was established, administering part of what is now Portland Parish, which was not established until 1722, and excluding what is now the western part of the parish, which was in the historic Saint David Parish. The Crown invited residents from other British colonies to settle here. About 1600 colonists, mainly from Nevis – including the Governor of Nevis, his wife, children – settled there. In a short time, however, two-thirds of them died of tropical fevers. The colony began to rebuild. They forced enslaved Africans to work the sugar cane plantations developed in the area. In 1674, the French Admiral Du Casse, sailed from Santo Domingo and landed at Morant Bay on 17 June. For a month, he raided local settlers, killing many and carrying off their slaves. Later, bands of Maroons settled in the mountains of St. Thomas.
===Saint Thomas in the East===
In 1676, when Saint Thomas in the Vale Parish, the parish became known as &quot;Saint Thomas in the East Parish&quot;. It retained this name until 1 May 1867 when the parish system of colonial administration was reformed by Governor John Peter Grant who introduced A Law to Reduce the Number of Parishes (1867/No.20).

In the 18th century they joined with the Maroons in Portland parish to form the Windward Maroons.

Slaves long constituted the majority of the population of the parish. In 1834 the British government abolished slavery, ending it fully in 1838 after a four-year &quot;apprenticeship.&quot; But decades later, freedmen struggled to gain land to cultivate and generally worked at very low wages. As they generally could not afford to pay the poll tax, so were excluded from voting.

===Morant Bay Rebellion===
In October 1865, the Morant Bay rebellion took place in St Thomas. Formerly enslaved people and their descendants all over Jamaica were discontented about the social injustices, particularly on the question of land tenure. Baptist deacon and preacher Paul Bogle of St. Thomas parish led a delegation of small farmers who walked to present their grievances to Edward John Eyre the Governor of Jamaica in the capital Spanish Town, but they were denied an audience.

Angered after a case in which a peasant was convicted of trespass on a long-abandoned plantation, on 11 October, Paul Bogle and his followers, armed with sticks and machetes, marched to the Court House in Morant Bay where a vestry meeting was being held. The authorities read the Riot Act, but the protestors ignored it. A few people began to throw stones at the volunteer militia, who fired into the crowd and killed seven people. Later the mob reorganized and returned, setting fire to the Court House and nearby buildings. When the custos, Maximillian von Ketelhodt, and others tried to leave the burning building, the mob killed them. A total of 25 people died on both sides that day.

During the next two days the peasants took over St. Thomas parish. The governor declared martial law in the parish and ordered troops to suppress the rebellion. More than 430 people were killed outright by soldiers in suppression of the rebellion, and more than 1,000 homes were burned to the ground, leaving thousands of people homeless. They arrested more than 300, executing some and punishing many innocent people.

Representative George William Gordon, who was in touch with Paul Bogle, spoke out for the workers in the House of Assembly in Kingston. The governor ordered him arrested and returned to Morant Bay, where he was tried under martial law for conspiracy and hanged on 23 October. The following day Bogle was captured by Jamaican Maroons from Moore Town, handed over to the authorities, and hanged.

A public outcry in Great Britain led to the appointment of a Royal Commission to investigate events. Although Eyre was forced to resign and twice charged with murder, his case never went to trial.

In 1969, Paul Bogle was named a National Hero of Jamaica, as were George William Gordon and three others.

==Geography and demography==
Saint Thomas is located at latitude 18°05&#x27;N, longitude 76°40&#x27;W, to the south of Portland, and the east of St. Andrew. With an area of , it ranks as Jamaica&#x27;s ninth-largest parish. It is very mountainous, with ranges that include the Port Royal Mountains, stretching from above Newcastle in St Andrew, to Albion in St Thomas; the Queensbury Ridge, between the Yallahs and Negro rivers; and to the extreme south, an isolated ridge called Yallahs Hill, with its highest elevation above sea level. The Blue Mountains form the northern border of the parish.

The parish contains large wetlands areas, comprising the coastal area between Morant Bay and Hector&#x27;s River. There are also many cliffs and beaches.

There are three main rivers in the parish; the Yallahs River, measuring long; the Morant River, measuring long; and the Plantain Garden River, measuring long. The latter is the only eastward flowing river in the island.

The total population of the parish is 94,410. The ethnic makeup of Saint Thomas is 88.2% Black, 7.6% Asian, 3.2% White, and 1% Other.

The parish has a relatively youthful population. Approximately 54.7% of the parish&#x27;s population was 29 years or younger: children under 0-14 years accounted for 27% of the population, youths of 15 to 29 years accounted for 27.7%. The working-age population (15-64 years) accounted for 64.1%, reflecting the national distribution. The elderly, 65 years and over, accounted for 8.9%; this figure is lower than the national proportion of 11.1% reported by the Economic and Social Survey Jamaica (2010).

==Commerce==
Agriculture plays a vital part in the economy of Saint Thomas. Sugar and bananas were the main items produced for export.The St. Thomas Parish sugar mill Golden Grove closed in July 2019. Most small farmers produce domestic and orchard crops, which provide the main source of employment. Serge Island Dairies is located in the parish. St. Thomas also has many factories for food processing and electrical equipment.

Current efforts are being made by Upliftment Jamaica to create, support and provide opportunities to the people of St. Thomas, and to encourage economic and social transformation on a community and county-wide basis. Over 10,000 people benefit annually from this organization, via year-round projects and events, with numbers rapidly increasing.

==Transportation==

===Roads===
The coast of St. Thomas is skirted by the A4, which runs from Kingston to Annotto Bay. The primary secondary road runs east to west along the foot of the Blue Mountains from Golden Grove to Richmond Vale, with north-south connecting roads linking it to the A4 at Pleasant Hill, Port Morant, Morant Bay, Church Corner, Belvedere, Yallahs, Albion and Eleven Mile.

===Rail===
Rail transport in St. Thomas was formerly limited to estate light railways, such as the one serving the former Bowden banana shipment port. All have ceased operation.

===Sea===
The Morant Point Lighthouse guards the easternmost tip of the parish and the island.

<doc id="1057642" wikidata="Q1032338" url="?curid=1057642" title="Canadian Professional Hockey League">
<text>The Canadian Professional Hockey League, also known as Can-Pro, was a minor professional hockey league founded in 1926. After three seasons, it became the International Hockey League (IHL) in 1929. The Can-Pro name was then given to a new league of IHL farm teams which operated in the 1929–30 season.

==The first Can-Pro league (1926–1929)==
The initial meeting to organize a new league was held on June 27, 1926 in Hamilton, Ontario. The governing body for amateur hockey in Ontario, the Ontario Hockey Association, had been cracking down on teams that induced players to move from other areas in violation of the league&#x27;s residency requirements. In mid-June, the OHA refused to certify over 20 players who had changed residences. Windsor alone had eight players who were denied OHA certification.

In response, and also driven by the recent expansion of professional hockey in North America, seven OHA senior teams met to discuss forming a minor professional league that would be affiliated with the National Hockey League. Brantford and Toronto were at the initial meeting, but had to bow out, and the remaining five teams became the inaugural members of the CPHL: Hamilton, London, Niagara Falls, Stratford and Windsor. Charles King of Windsor was made league president on August 4 and served in that role for all three seasons the CPHL operated.

After the 1927-28 season, all the players on the Hamilton Tigers were purchased by the new Buffalo Bisons (a team based in Fort Erie), and an entirely new team played in Hamilton. Teddy Oke&#x27;s Kitchener Millionaires moved to Toronto to take the place of the Toronto Ravinas which disbanded in 1928. Oke sold the franchise rights to Kitchener to a new owner, who created the Kitchener Flying Dutchmen. The team included players from the Millionaires that did not move to Toronto.

The league championship in 1929 was a cross-border matchup between the Windsor Bulldogs and the Detroit Olympics, with Windsor winning the championship. Five of the eight teams had lost money during the season, including all the Canadian teams except the Bulldogs. Before the 1929 playoffs were over, it was rumoured that the league would be replaced by an international league the following season and that a lower-level minor league would be created in Ontario.

The league held its annual meeting in September 1929, re-elected King as president, and renamed itself the International Hockey League. The only change in the lineup was that the Kitchener franchise was transferred to Cleveland, Ohio, with the Kitchener players reassigned to Toronto and Toronto&#x27;s players sent to Cleveland.

===Franchises===
* Buffalo Bisons: 1928–29, joined the IHL in 1929
* Detroit Olympics: 1927–28, 1928–29, joined the IHL in 1929
* Hamilton Tigers: 1926–27, 1927–28, 1928–29, joined the IHL in 1929
* Kitchener Flying Dutchmen: 1928–29
* Kitchener Millionaires: 1927–28
* London Panthers: 1926-27, 1927–28, 1928–29, joined the IHL in 1929
* Niagara Falls Cataracts: 1926–27, 1927–28, 1928–29, joined the IHL in 1929
* Stratford Nationals: 1926–27, 1927–28
* Toronto Millionaires: 1928–29, joined the IHL in 1929
* Toronto Ravinas/Falcons: 1927–28
* Windsor Hornets/Windsor Bulldogs: 1926–27, 1927–28, 1928-29, joined the IHL in 1929

===Championships===
* 1927: London Panthers defeated Stratford Nationals (4-1, total goals)
* 1928: Stratford Nationals defeated Kitchener Millionaires (2-0, best-of-three)
* 1929: Windsor Bulldogs defeated Detroit Olympics (3-2, best-of-five)

==The second Can-Pro league (1929–1930)==
Teddy Oke led the organization of the minor pro hockey league in Ontario, designed to be a farm system for the IHL teams and a step up from existing industrial leagues. It took the abandoned Can-Pro name with teams in Kitchener, Galt, Guelph, and Brantford. League president was Robert Dawson of Guelph, Ontario. There were no artificial ice rinks in Guelph, so the Maple Leafs played all their games on the road until the weather was cold enough to support ice at the Royal City Arena in Guelph. The league disbanded after one season, with Galt and Guelph joining the Ontario Professional Hockey League.

===Franchises===
* Brantford Indians
* Galt Terriers
* Guelph Maple Leafs
* Kitchener Flying Dutchmen

===Championships===
* 1930: Guelph Maple Leafs defeated Galt Terriers (3-1, best-of-five)

<doc id="1057643" wikidata="Q4224577" url="?curid=1057643" title="Sword Scabbard Declaration">
<text>The Order of the Day of the Sword Scabbard, or the Sword Scabbard Declaration, actually refers to two related declarations by the Finnish Commander-in-Chief Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim during World War I and World War II against Soviet control of East Karelia.

==Background==

===World War I===
During the Civil War in Finland, in February 1918, General Mannerheim, the commander of the anti-communist White Guards, wrote his famous Order of the Day, in which he declared that he would not set his sword to the scabbard &quot;until Lenin&#x27;s last soldier and hooligan is deported from Finland and White Karelia&quot; (&quot;... ennen kuin viimeinen Leninin soturi ja huligaani on karkoitettu niin hyvin Suomesta kuin Vienan Karjalastakin.&quot;).

The events at the end of World War I made this goal hard to accomplish, but nevertheless, two attempts were made to this end: the Viena expedition in 1918 and the Aunus expedition in 1919, during the Russian Civil War, had allowed Finland to occupy and annex two regions of East Karelia - Repola and Porajärvi respectively.

===Between the wars===
Hostilities between Finland and Soviet Russia came to an end with the signing of the Treaty of Tartu in 1920. In accordance with the treaty, Soviet Russia ceded Petsamo to Finland and guaranteed special freedoms to the Karelian SSR. In return, Finland had to give up the two previously annexed Karelian counties. This was seen by many Finns as a very bad deal. The peace treaty thus got a nickname, &quot;a Shame Peace&quot; (&quot;Häpeärauha&quot; in Finnish).

===World War II===
Following the Soviet attack on Finland of 25 June 1941, Finland was again at war with its eastern neighbour. On 10 July 1941, Mannerheim referred to his 1918 declaration in his &quot;Order of the Day&quot; speech to his troops: &quot;... [I]n 1918 during the War of Liberation I stated to the Finnish and Viena Karelians, that I would not set my sword to the scabbard before Finland and East Karelia would be free.&quot; () This &quot;Order of the Day&quot; signified the beginning of an offensive, which would result in a three-year-long occupation of Eastern Karelia.

==Diplomatic consequences==
Immediately after the Axis invasion, Finland officially declared itself neutral in relation to the conflict. However, German minelayers, which had been hiding in the Finnish archipelago, laid two large minefields across the Gulf of Finland. Later the same night, German bombers flew along the Gulf of Finland to Leningrad and mined its harbor and the river Neva. On the return trip, these bombers landed on the Utti airfield for refueling. After three days, early on the morning of 25 June, preemptive Soviet air raids were launched on Finnish towns, airfields and industrial centers. The country was at war with its larger neighbor once again. This Continuation War was initially defensive for Finland, but with his nearly immediate restatement of his Sword Scabbard Declaration, Mannerheim lost the possibility to brand it a defensive war, or even as a war of revanchism to regain the territory lost in the Winter War, where one-eighth of the Finnish populace lived. Gradually, the Continuation War became, in the eyes of some, a war of conquest, to capture land that had not historically belonged to Finland.

For large segments of the public, both in Finland and in other democratic countries, there was a huge difference between a defensive war and a war of aggression. In the Winter War Finland had the sympathy of virtually the whole world (with the exception of Nazi Germany and the aggressor, the Soviet Union). The chief reason was that Finland, in international opinion, was unjustly attacked by a much larger power. In the Continuation War, on the other hand, Finland was partly an aggressor in the eyes of some, attacking the Soviet Union alongside the Axis invasion. This badly damaged Finland&#x27;s image in the eyes of the Churchill government and eventually caused the formerly sympathetic Britain to declare war on Finland in December 1941.

<doc id="1057654" wikidata="Q459189" url="?curid=1057654" title="Maria Soledad Torres y Acosta">
<text>María Soledad Torres y Acosta (2 December 1826 – 11 October 1887) - born Manuela - was a Spanish Roman Catholic professed religious and the founder of the Servants of Mary. Her apostolic actions - and those of her order - were dedicated towards the nursing of the sick and the poor in the places that it operated in. Torres&#x27; childhood consisted of the desire to join the religious life and managed to join a priest&#x27;s fledgling religious cluster of women after the Dominicans refused to admit her due to her frail constitution. But a series of struggles saw her in a conflicted position of leadership that saw her removed and reinstated twice.

Torres was beatified in 1950 and was later proclaimed a saint in 1970. Her liturgical feast is affixed to the date of her death as is the norm. In 2016, a movie was produced in Spain (original title: &quot;Luz de Soledad)&quot; that tells her vocation and the struggles during the early years of her life as founder.

==Life==
Manuela Torres Acosta was born on 2 December 1826 as the second of five children to Francisco Torres and Antonia Acosta in Madrid; she was baptized as &quot;Antonia Bibiana Manuela&quot;. Her parents ran a small business in their home near the Plaza de España.

Torres received her education from the Vincentian Sisters and often visited the sick in her neighborhood. The girl also helped at a free school for the poor that the order managed.

In about 1850 she felt called to enter an enclosed religious order and applied to a Dominican convent (not too far from her home) for admission as a secular religious but had to wait until there was room for her. In 1851 she heard of the efforts of Miguel Martínez Sanz (a Third Order Servite) who was the parish priest in Chamberí. Martínez envisioned founding a group of seven women who would minister to the sick and poor of his parish in their own homes since those people often could not afford proper hospitalization. Torres offered herself for this work and (with initial reluctance) Martínez accepted her as the seventh and final member of the order that he wished to establish. On 15 August 1851 she and her six companions committed their lives to this service as a religious group and at that time took the religious habit; she assumed the religious name of &quot;María Soledad&quot;. 

Martínez in 1856 took with him six of the twelve religious to the missions at Fernando Pó which left Torres as the superior of the order and the sole remaining member of the original group. The remaining religious soon removed her from this office which left the group disorganized and such was the chaos that the local bishop even threatened to dissolve it. The bishop examined Torres and the circumstances of her removal before deciding to re-appoint her as the superior. Torres managed to continue her work with the help of her spiritual director Gabino Sánchez who was an Augustinian Recollect. It was at this time that the order was named as the Servants of Mary. The dedication of the order was brought to the attention of the public after their notable and extensive care of the sick during the cholera epidemic in 1865.

Torres faced several trials throughout her time of leadership in the congregation and soon became the victim of slander and was again removed from her office until Father Sánchez had her reinstated following after another investigation. While establishing a new group of the order in Valencia she faced the liberalizing government which took control of the empire in the Revolution of 1868. It was around this stage that several of the nuns left the order but the order continued to grow in number and in 1875 began to serve in Havana. The order received definitive papal approval in 1876 from Pope Pius IX.

Torres died from pneumonia on 11 October 1887. Her remains were buried in a simple plot around fellow religious of her order but were exhumed and transferred to the chapel of the motherhouse on 18 January 1893; her remains were deemed to be intact and it was reported that her remains exuded a blood-like liquid and a sweet odor. But it was not long after upon another inspection that her remains were limited to bones which meant decomposition had advanced perhaps due to the first exhumation and transferral.

==Canonization==
Two informative processes opened in Madrid for the collection of documentation in relation to the cause for sainthood. Those documents would prove her saintliness while the theologians summoned to investigate her writings approved them on 21 November 1920. On 26 November 1924 she was titled a Servant of God. The documentation was forwarded to Rome where the Congregation for Rites approved them on 18 December 1929. First an antepreparatory committee met and approved the cause on 28 July 1936 while the preparatory one also approved it on 6 July 1937 as did a general committee on 11 January 1938. The confirmation of her life of heroic virtue allowed for Pius XI to sign a decree on 23 January 1938 that titled Torres as Venerable.

Two miracles were required for her beatification and the C.O.R. validated the two informative processes on 24 April 1942 that investigated the two separate cases. An antepreparatory committee approved these two healings as miracles on 30 November 1943 as did the preparatory one on 31 May 1949 and the general one on 22 November 1949. Pope Pius XII approved both miracles on 27 November 1949 and beatified Torres on 5 February 1950 in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica. One miracle was the cure of Sister Lucia Santiago Allende on November 10, 1915 from grave tuberculosis and severe gastric complications.

Two more miracles were investigated in two separate cognitional processes and the Congregation for the Causes of Saints later approved this on 29 October 1968 after their meeting while passing it onto Pope Paul VI on 10 November 1969 who confirmed them.

<text>Ian Hugh Myddleton Anderson (1953 – 2 February 2011) was a leading figure on the British far-right in the 1980s and 1990s.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Anderson was born in Hillingdon in 1953. His involvement in politics began in the mid-1970s when he was close to certain elements on the right of the Conservative Party, particularly the Monday Club.

===National Front===
Anderson joined the National Front in the late 1970s and was initially seen as a supporter of National Organiser Martin Webster. However, when the Political Soldier faction, led by figures such as Nick Griffin and Derek Holland, moved against Webster and his assistant Michael Salt, Anderson sided with the rebels and used his casting vote to ensure that Webster and Salt were expelled for mismanagement.

Anderson became a close associate of Andrew Brons and, like Brons, largely indulged the Political Soldiers faction, writing for the Third Positionist party magazine &quot;Nationalism Today&quot;. He also played a leading role in working with Ian Stuart Donaldson to ensure that Rock Against Communism became the province of the NF rather than the British Movement. As Anderson grew in influence within the NF divisions between the faction led by Brons and himself and the Political Soldiers grew, as Anderson was a strong supporter of electoral participation. He became one of the leading figures grouped around the dissident &quot;Flag&quot; newspaper (edited by Martin Wingfield) and was expelled by the Official National Front along with the rest of his faction in 1986, reconstituting as the Flag Group. The divisions reached a crisis at the Vauxhall by-election in 1989, where an NF candidate for each faction stood (Patrick Harrington and Ted Budden), splitting support and haranguing one another on live TV as the declaration of votes was made. Anderson, nonetheless, became a powerful figure within the Flag Group and by 1990 was effective leader, Andrew Brons having left the political scene.

In 1987, Troy Southgate and Patrick Harrington, acting for the NF&#x27;s Security and Intelligence Department (SID), photographed Anderson in Stratford, east London, when it was discovered that his printing business was housed in the same building as the offices of Searchlight, an anti-fascist organisation.

With the Official NF having split into the International Third Position and Third Way, Anderson gained control of the NF in 1990 and attempted to remodel the party back along the lines of John O&#x27;Brien in the early 1970s when they had appeared at one stage to be a potential threat to the mainstream parties. The spur for this was undoubtedly the success of the Front National. He had also attempted to gain contacts in the United States and in 1989 he had established a link with Richard Barrett and the Nationalist Movement with a pact known as the &#x27;New Atlantic Charter&#x27;. Anderson&#x27;s NF suffered however from the inactivity and in-fighting of the 1980s, whilst the emergence of the British National Party was also a major check on his ambitions as leader.

===National Democrats===
Anderson soon came to believe that the negative connotations of the National Front name were proving a bar to success and so in 1995 he relaunched the party as the National Democrats, after a postal ballot of the members. The launch was not without its problems however: within a month, many activists had joined the continuing National Front run by John McAuley.

Anderson maintained contacts in Northern Ireland (which the Flag Group&#x27;s Joe Pearce had built up during the 1980s), particularly within the right of the Ulster Unionist Party and in the 1997 General Election he stood as a candidate for the Londonderry East constituency. Securing a mere 0.2% share of the vote in the constituency, Anderson soon abandoned his Northern Ireland strategy.

===Later activities===
The National Democrats became the Campaign for National Democracy pressure group and ceased actively contesting elections.

In 2004, he became a figure in community politics, campaigning for adult learning, local clean-ups, and more shops and fewer restaurants amongst other local campaigns. He was also involved in setting up the People&#x27;s Campaign to Keep the Pound, along with Anthony Bennett, a leading member of Robert Kilroy-Silk&#x27;s Veritas.

Anderson was the leader of the short-lived Epping Community Action Group, which was registered with the Electoral Commission as a political party in April 2006. The group stood two candidates, including Anderson, for election to Epping Forest District Council in the 2007 local elections, but came third in both wards. He gained 215 votes in the Epping Hemnall ward beating a British National Party candidate by 68 votes.

Anderson was also involved in a number of other groups such as the Conservative Democratic Alliance. He gave considerable support to UKIP in later years and aided Pam Barden of Save Our Sovereignty (now sponsored by UKIP).

===Panther Print===
Anderson ran a printing business called Panther Print in Dagenham, which has been used by the nationalist movement. Panther Print was based at Britannia House, and the building doubled as National Democrats&#x27; HQ.

He died in Epping in 2011 from a brain tumour, at the age of 57. His funeral took place on 15 February 2011.

<text>Villerville () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. The &quot;commune&quot; is located towards the eastern end of the coastline called the Côte Fleurie (Flowery Coast).

==In entertainment==
In the summer of 1923 the American art collector and patron Peggy Guggenheim rented a villa in the village and entertained, amongst others, the American photographer Man Ray and his partner, the French model, singer, artist and &#x27;Queen of Montparnasse&#x27; Alice Prin, also known as &#x27;Kiki&#x27;. According the recently published biography of Kiki, Peggy would encourage her guests to paint in the villa&#x27;s garden, and Peggy &quot;picked up a brush for the first and last time of her life.&quot;

Composer Francis Bayer (1938–2004) was born in Villerville.

The film A Monkey in Winter &quot;Un singe en hiver&quot;, starring Jean Gabin and Jean-Paul Belmondo, was shot there in 1962. Villerville celebrated the film&#x27;s 50th anniversary with special events from 30 June to 20 October 2012.

La Baleine Theatre (The Whale Theater) operated between July and November 1894. The brainchild of Simon-Max, who managed Villerville&#x27;s Casino for a time, he purchased the remains of a beached whale at auction and had it converted into a theater seating 80–100, where he himself performed in various revues.

The attraction was so successful it was moved first to Trouville, then to the Casino de Paris, where it served the dual function of a museum and theater. It was destroyed by fire on the night of February 25–26, 1895, causing the Casino substantial damage.

The &quot;Friends of the Villerville Whale&quot; was founded in 2013 with the aim of reviving the town&#x27;s casino. In July 2014 they commemorated the 120th anniversary of The Whale Theater.

<text>Human behaviour genetics is an interdisciplinary subfield of behaviour genetics that studies the role of genetic and environmental influences on human behaviour. Classically, human behavioural geneticists have studied the inheritance of behavioural traits. The field was originally focused on determining the importance of genetic influences on human behaviour (for e.g., do genes regulate human behavioural attributes). It has evolved to address more complex questions such as: how important are genetic and/or environmental influences on various human behavioural traits; to what extent do the same genetic and/or environmental influences impact the overlap between human behavioural traits; how do genetic and/or environmental influences on behaviour change across development; and what environmental factors moderate the importance of genetic effects on human behaviour (gene-environment interaction). The field is interdisciplinary, and draws from genetics, psychology, and statistics. Most recently, the field has moved into the area of statistical genetics, with many behavioural geneticists also involved in efforts to identify the specific genes involved in human behaviour, and to understand how the effects associated with these genes changes across time, and in conjunction with the environment.

Traditionally, the human behavioural genetics were a psychology and phenotype based studies including intelligence, personality and grasping ability. During the years, the study developed beyond the classical traits of human behaviour and included more genetically associated traits like genetic disorders (such as fragile X syndrome, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and obesity). The traditional methods of behavioural-genetic analysis provide a quantitative evaluation of genetic and non-genetic influences on human behaviour. The family, twin and adoption studies marks the huge contribution for laying down the foundation for current molecular genetic studies to study human behaviour.

==History==
In 1869, Francis Galton published the first empirical work in human behavioural genetics, &quot;Hereditary Genius&quot;. Here, Galton intended to demonstrate that &quot;a man&#x27;s natural abilities are derived by inheritance, under exactly the same limitations as are the form and physical features of the whole organic world.&quot; Like most seminal work, he overstated his conclusions. His was a family study on the inheritance of giftedness and talent. Galton was aware that resemblance among familial relatives can be a function of both shared inheritance and shared environments. Contemporary human behavioural quantitative genetics studies special populations such as twins and adoptees.

The initial impetus behind this research was to demonstrate that there were indeed genetic influences on human behaviour. In psychology, this phase lasted for the first half of the 20th century largely because of the overwhelming influence of behaviourism in the field. Later behavioural genetic research focused on quantitative methods.

In 1984, a research program named the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA) was initiated in gerontological genetics. The research was executed on Twins Reared Apart (TRA) and Twins Reared Together (TRT). In this three-year interval study, the testing was carried out in two ways, Mail-Out Questionnaire and In-Person Testing (IPT). The IPT includes functional capacity, physical performance measurements, neurological state, general health, cardiovascular health, and cognitive abilities, all of which are particularly significant in ageing. The IPT had two major components for testing, Biomedical and Cognitive Assessment. The biomedical component was constructed to analyses the general health status like age changes, lungs function and capacity, physical strength. With this, the cognitive component was developed to represent and evaluate domains of crystallized and fluid intelligence and memory.

The data acquired from this study allowed researchers to assess genetic contributions to age changes and continuities throughout the length of the SATSA twins&#x27; later lives, which prolonged a decade and a half.

==Contemporary behavioural quantitative genetics==
Behavioural geneticists study both psychiatric and mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and alcoholism, as well as behavioural and social characteristics, such as personality and social attitudes.

Recent trends in behavioural genetics have indicated an additional focus toward researching the inheritance of human characteristics typically studied in developmental psychology. For instance, a major focus in developmental psychology has been to characterize the influence of parenting styles on children. However, in most studies, genes are a confounding variable. Because children share half of their alleles with each parent, any observed effects of parenting styles could be effects of having many of the same alleles as a parent (e.g. harsh aggressive parenting styles have been found to correlate with similar aggressive child characteristics: is it the parenting or the genes?). Thus, behaviour genetics research is currently undertaking to distinguish the effects of the family environment from the effects of genes. This branch of behaviour genetics research is becoming more closely associated with mainstream developmental psychology and the sub-field of developmental psychopathology as it shifts its focus to the heritability of such factors as emotional self-control, attachment, social functioning, aggressiveness, etc.

Several academic bodies exist to support behaviour genetic research, including the International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society, Behavior Genetics Association, the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics, and the International Society for Twin Studies. Behaviour genetic work features prominently in several more general societies, for instance the International Behavioral Neuroscience Society.

==Methods of human behavioural genetics==
Human behavioural geneticists use several designs to try to answer questions about the nature and mechanisms of genetic influences on behaviour. All of these designs are unified by being based around human relationships which disentangle genetic and environmental relatedness.

The cornerstone of behavioural genetics approaches is quantitative genetics theories, which were formulated more than half a century ago by geneticists concerned with the practical challenges of increasing economically relevant characteristics of domestic plants and animals. These methods are used to study a myriad of traits, including intelligence and other cognitive abilities, personality traits like extraversion and emotionality, and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disease.

===Traditional methods of behavioural-genetic analysis===

To examine genetic and environmental impacts on complex human behavioural traits, researchers uses three classic methods: family, twin, and adoption studies. Individual variations within the normal range of variation, as well as the genesis of psychopathologies, are investigated using each of these techniques.

===Family studies===
Genes and shared (or familial) environmental factors have a role in family resemblance. The majority of familial research on schizophrenia are concerned with relative risk. Despite the fact that the scope of diagnosis varies, the lifetime risk of schizophrenia in the general population is generally stated as 1%. Siblings of people with schizophrenia, on the other hand, constitute 13% of the population. The hazards for second- and third-degree relatives are lower, at 3% and 2%, respectively, as predicted. In a  As a result, schizophrenia is certainly a familial trait.

===Twin and adoption studies===
The basic understanding of behavioural genetics requires the separate study of effects of genes and environment influence on human behaviour. Such as, the genetic effects in a trait are discernible if pair of genetically identical (monozygotic twins) are much similar to one another than pair of genetically non-identical (dizygotic twin).

Twin and adoption studies describe the extent to which family resemblance is due to shared genes and the extent to which it is due to shared environments. Behavioral Scientist uses twin studies to examine hereditary and environmental influences on behavioural development.

For instance, some researchers also study adopted twins: the adoption study. The adoption design produces estimates of various genetic and environmental components of variance, similar to the twin design. Furthermore, the adoption design facilitates

(1) the identification of specific environmental influences that are unaffected by heredity (e.g., the effects of life stressors),

(2) the analysis of heredity&#x27;s role in ostensibly environmental relationships, and

(3) the evaluation of genotype-environment interactions and correlations.

In this case the adoption disentangles the genetic relatedness of the twins (either 50% or 100%) from their family environments. Likewise the classic twin study contrasts the differences between identical and fraternal twins within a family compared to differences observed between families. This core design can be extended: the so-called &quot;extended twin study&quot; which adds additional family members, increasing power and allowing new genetic and environmental relationships to be studied. Excellent examples of this model are the Virginia 20,000 and the QIMR twin studies.

Generally, if the observed behaviour and cognitive traits have a genetic component, then genetically similar relatives resemble to each other as comparative to individuals who share lesser component of genome. I n case of environmental influence, researchers study the two broad classes of effects in behavioural genetics such as shared environmental factors causing them to behave similarly and the other one is nonshared environmental factors causing them to behave different from one another. For example, siblings raised together in same environment will have more evident shared environment influences whereas in relative siblings raised apart from each other will have non-shared environmental influence. The understanding of the effects of genes and the influence of shared and nonshared environment on human behaviour provides a comprehensive data for genetic and environmental relatedness.

Also possible are the &quot;children of twins&quot; design (holding maternal genetic contributions equal across children with paternal genetics and family environments) and the &quot;virtual twins&quot; design - unrelated children adopted into a family who are very close or identical in age to biological children or other adopted children in the family. While the classical twin study has been criticized they continue to be of high utility. There are several dozen major studies ongoing, in countries as diverse as the US, UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Australia, and the method is used widely on phenotypes as diverse as dental caries, body mass index, ageing, substance abuse, sexuality, cognitive abilities, personality, values, and a wide range of psychiatric disorders. This is broad utility is reflected in several thousands of peer-review papers, and several dedicated societies and journals.

==Contemporary methods of behavioural-genetic analysis: new approaches==
The approaches improve the capacity to specify and generalize results on the effects of genetic and environmental factors on characteristics and their evolution across time.

===QTL analysis study===
Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis is a statistical approach for attempting to explain the genetic basis of variation in complex characteristics by linking two types of data: phenotypic data (trait measurements) and genotypic data (typically molecular markers).

Researchers in disciplines as diverse as agriculture, biology, and medicine use QTL analysis to relate complicated traits to particular chromosomal regions. The purpose of this procedure is to determine the action, interaction, quantity, and type of action. The ability to disentangle the genetic component of complex characteristics has been enabled by QTL studies in model systems.

To research behavioural characteristics such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, alcoholism, and autism, large-scale national and international alliances have been constructed. Such partnerships will bring together enormous, consistently gathered samples, improving the likelihood of finding real susceptibility gene connections.

===Biometric model fitting===
The method is designed in collaboration of quantitative geneticists to enhance the capabilities to delineate between the genetic and environmental components of complex behavioural characteristics. Path analysis and structural equation modelling are two statistical approaches used in this methodology. The approach is used to see if genetic and environmental impacts can be employed in various populations. It would be useful to know how much of the total genetic variance—heritability—is accounted for by a limited selection of potential loci in studies of emotional stability, for example.

<doc id="1057733" wikidata="Q637866" url="?curid=1057733" title="Book review">
<text>A book review is a form of literary criticism in which a book is merely described (summary review) or analyzed based on content, style, and merit.

A book review may be a primary source, an opinion piece, a summary review, or a scholarly view. Books can be reviewed for printed periodicals, magazines, and newspapers, as school work, or for book websites on the Internet. A book review&#x27;s length may vary from a single paragraph to a substantial essay. Such a review may evaluate the book based on personal taste. Reviewers may use the occasion of a book review for an extended essay that can be closely or loosely related to the subject of the book, or to promulgate their ideas on the topic of a fiction or non-fiction work.

Some journals are devoted to book reviews, and reviews are indexed in databases such as the &quot;Book Review Index&quot; and &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;; but many more book reviews can be found in newspaper and scholarly databases such as Arts and Humanities Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index, and discipline-specific databases.

== History ==
Photios I of Constantinople has been called &quot;the inventor of the book review&quot; for his work, &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;.

== Types of reviews ==

=== Academic reviews ===
Academic book reviews are both a form of academic service and a contribution to the academic literature. They are frequently published as a section or part of academic journals. They help the profession understand what has been happening in their profession, and work on the emerging intellectual challenges of their field. However, not all academics are incentivized to take on the work required in a book review, because they are often not rewarded for that work. Book reviews can be used to predict which monographs are likely to have subsequent citations.

=== Newspaper and magazine reviews ===
Newspaper reviews became prominent in the 18h century, as a form of reader responses.

In academic criticism, popular book reviews in newspapers and magazine reviews are often used to evaluate the relative audience and impact of books during a period.

<text>Hampstead Heath is a station on the Mildmay line of the London Overground, located on South End Road in Hampstead in the London Borough of Camden. Situated between and stations, the station is in Travelcard Zone 2.

==History==
In the nineteenth century up to 100,000 people per day used the station at weekends and on public holidays as the Heath was a popular leisure destination for Londoners. The station was rebuilt, after Second World War bomb damage, and in the 1990s in conjunction with works to allow Eurostar trains to use the North London line.

==Design==
The platform canopies are in a pseudo-antique style which is in stark contrast to the poured concrete style of the rest of the station&#x27;s structural features. The line runs below street level with access via staircases to each platform. Lifts providing access to both platforms were added in 2014. During the same refurbishment works new ticket barriers were added.

== Artwork ==
In 2011, &quot;Evenings&#x27; Hill&quot; by British artist Clare Woods was installed along the length of the platform, made from porcelain tiles. The artwork was commissioned by TfL in 2011, as part of London Overground&#x27;s art programme.

==Services==
All services at Hampsted Heath are operated by London Overground as part of the Mildmay line using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 8 tph to via 
* 4 tph to 
* 4 tph to 

During the late evenings, the services to and from Clapham Junction do not operate.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 1, 24, 46 and C11 serve the station.

<doc id="1057754" wikidata="Q372368" url="?curid=1057754" title="Leonard Howell">
<text>Leonard Percival Howell (16 June 1898 – 23 January 1981), also known as The Gong or G. G. Maragh (for &quot;Gangun Guru&quot;), was a Jamaican religious figure. According to his biographer Hélène Lee, Howell was born into an Anglican family. He was one of the first preachers of the Rastafari movement (along with Joseph Hibbert and Archibald Dunkley), and is known by many as The First Rasta.

Born in May Crawle River on 16 June 1898, Howell left Jamaica as a youth, traveling to many places, including Panama and New York, and returned in 1932. He began preaching in 1933 about what he considered the symbolic portent for the African diaspora—the crowning of Ras Tafari Makonnen as Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia. His preaching asserted that Haile Selassie was the &quot;Messiah returned to earth&quot;, and he published a book called &quot;The Promised Key&quot;. Although this resulted in his being arrested, tried for sedition, and imprisoned for two years, the Rastafari movement grew.

Over the following years, Howell came into conflict with all the establishment authorities in Jamaica: the planters, the trade unions, established churches, police, and colonial authorities. Howell was seen as a threat largely due to the anti-colonial message of the Rastafarian movement, which he was perpetuating along with the sermons promoting the idea of a positive black racial identity. Local ruling elites were uneasy with Howell’s popular call for black people to take a stand. Colonial authorities hoped to quell Howell’s growing movement early so as to snuff out support early on.

As his following grew, the threat of Howell&#x27;s core beliefs in the power of black people to overcome white oppression, and his movement, expanded to become an international concern given his strong messages of black liberation and Pan-Africanism that resonated with blacks across the globe. He formed a town or commune called Pinnacle in Saint Catherine Parish that became famous as a place for Rastafari. This movement prospered, and today the Rastafari faith exists worldwide. Unlike many Rastafari, Howell never wore dreadlocks.

Leonard Howell died in Kingston, Jamaica, on 23 January 1981 after suffering a vicious attack months earlier where he was slashed in the face and beaten badly at the age of 83 in Tredegar Park, St. Catherine not far from Pinnacle.

Although Leonard P. Howell suffered much abuse for the foundation of Rastafari, his legacy as a perceived true hero and leader in anti-colonialism took root throughout Jamaica and the Caribbean and eventually globally. Ironically, the same government who sought his continual persecution has in 2022 awarded L.P. Howell or &#x27;Gong&#x27; with an Order of Distinction.

== Early life ==
Howell was born on 16 June 1898 in May Crawle village in the Bull Head mountain district of upper Clarendon in Jamaica. He was the eldest of a family of 10 children. Charles Theophilus Howell, his father, worked as peasant cultivator and tailor. Clementina Bennett, his mother, worked as an agricultural labourer.

During the First World War, Howell worked as a seaman and served as part of a Jamaican contingent sent to Panama. Before temporarily settling in Panama in 1918, he travelled back and forth between New York City and Panama several times. While in New York he became a member of Marcus Garvey&#x27;s Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) after being confronted with his identity as a black man in Harlem for the first time and meeting Garvey, the revolutionary UNIA leader, in person.

Howell lived abroad for a total of some twenty years in his early life, during which time he was arrested and jailed for his involvement with the UNIA because the organization&#x27;s pro-black messages were viewed as threatening. After migrating to Panama and the United States, he eventually returned home in December 1932 at the age of 34 after being deported from the US. He was deported because of his involvement with the UNIA, which was perceived as threatening by the US government, due to the organization&#x27;s messages of black power and anti-colonialism. Upon returning to his homeland, he decided to leave his family home and spread the word about Rastafari. This decision to break away from his home was due to a conflict between Howell and his family, presumably because of his controversial belief in the divine nature of Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia.

== Personal life ==
Howell married Tethen Bent, whose grave in Pinnacle is said to have been desecrated. Howell&#x27;s eldest son is named Monty Howell Very little information is available about Tethen Bent (who is a descendant of several south St. Elizabeth families, including the Bents, Elliotts, Parchments, Powells, Ebanks, among others), their marriage or other children of Leonard Howell.

== Rastafari evangelism ==
Howell&#x27;s first public articulation of the divinity of Haile Selassie occurred in January 1933. This first open deification, which proclaimed the Emperor of Ethiopia to be the incarnation of God, took place at &quot;Redemption Ground&quot; in Kingston but was not successful in gaining converts.

In February 1933, Howell relocated his meeting to a south-eastern parish of St. Thomas and two months later, on 18 April, he addressed about two hundred people at a meeting in Trinity Ville, St. Thomas. During this meeting, police were present to monitor and control the event, which they deemed to be of a &quot;seditious nature&quot;. Despite concerns, authorities chose not to press charges against Howell so as not to draw additional attention to his movement and decided instead to closely monitor him.

According to Howell and his followers, Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia was the &quot;Black Messiah&quot; – an incarnation of God predicted by biblical prophecy. Howell believed that the grand coronation of Haile Selassie (who was widely traditionally claimed to be the descendant of King David, King Solomon, and the Queen of Sheba, in part due to the medieval Ethiopian text Kebra Nagast), was the realization of a prophecy. The grandness of the emperor&#x27;s ascension to power appeared to validate Howell&#x27;s imperative claim.

Howell&#x27;s teachings often began with background information about the people, land, and sovereignty of Ethiopia as an unchanged land populated by original, primitive Christian people who were under direct rule of a king who was a direct descendant of King David. He idealized Ethiopia in his preaching, calling the country a land with unmatched people and a perfect language, the sole uncorrupted language on Earth. Howell emphasized the coming of a new civilization based upon and founded in the glory and power of Haile Selassie, the &quot;Supreme Black King&quot;. He instructed his followers to adore the Ethiopian emperor as the supreme God over all of humanity. In Howell&#x27;s view, it was through Ethiopia that the truths of good character, social order, manhood and womanhood were preserved and were unfolding for all to see. Howell preached that Ethiopian culture was re-emerging to overtake hegemonic Anglo-Saxon forces that had kept Africans enslaved.

== Core values, leadership, and social network ==
Among his followers, Howell preferred being called Gangunguru Maragh or G.G. Maragh to distinguish his ritual, mystical personality from his secular identity. Howell&#x27;s ritual name is thought to be a combination of three Hindi words – gyan (wisdom), gun (virtue or talent), and guru (teacher). In Hindi, Maragh means &quot;great kings&quot; or &quot;king of kings&quot;. Howell used this name as a pseudonym when he published &quot;The Promised Key&quot;.

During a meeting at Port Mortant, St. Thomas, in September 1933, it is recorded that Howell held a meeting that began with the singing of hymns. Then, Howell reportedly taunted clergymen of other religious denominations at the gathering and discouraged people from attending church because &quot;ministers were liars&quot;. He also spoke critically of slavery, claiming that &quot;the White man stole Africa from the Africans, and that Black people should think that Africa is their home, not Jamaica&quot;.

Howell&#x27;s message of praise for Emperor Haile Selassie also came with an open call for black supremacy as a way to combat colonialism and reject oppression by whites. At times, Howell would ask his congregants to join together and sing &quot;God Save the King&quot; – the king being Haile Selassie. Howell&#x27;s central doctrine acted as a force against white colonial ideology due to his placement of blackness as morally superior to whiteness, as is explained in his widely read publication, &quot;The Promised Key&quot;.

Howell is remembered as being a charismatic and authoritarian leader who sincerely cared about the wellbeing of his followers. In 1939, Howell founded the Ethiopian Salvation Society (ESS) whose objective was to use collective savings to better its members. A secondary purpose of the ESS was to help spread the good news about salvation and Christianity and underscore the value of self-help and good citizenship. These secondary purposes were expressly stated so as to shield the organization from suspicion that it was promoting sedition. Nevertheless, in 1940 the Jamaican governor responded to pressure from the colonial secretary and the labour leadership by officially banning a meeting of the ESS due to the resentment the organization was creating as well as its internationalization.

In addition to his leadership role in the ESS, Howell served as a role model and father figure for the growing Rastafarian community. His audacious, generous personality, combined with his well-travelled background, made early Rastafarians particularly receptive to his messages. Howell brought &quot;the hope of a new generation, one which was inspired by the magnificence of the new Ethiopian emperor.&quot;

To expand Howell&#x27;s Rastafarian network, he formed relationships with other black groups such as the Afro-Athlican Constructive Gaathly and the UNIA. Additionally he collaborated closely with other icons of the Rastafarian movement such as Marcus Garvey and George Padmore, a Trinidadian journalist.

Howell&#x27;s appeal for identification with Africa was in opposition to concurrent movements in Jamaica promoting a Jamaican creole nationalism. Howell positioned himself as an opponent of the labour nationalists Bustamante and Manley who had gained a substantial following among the working class. Howell preached to both the working class and the peasantry in Jamaica, attempting to unite disenfranchised black people to overcome colonial oppression. Jamaica&#x27;s independence in 1962 (which nevertheless maintained social, political and economic ties between Jamaica and Great Britain) was largely a disappointment for Howell, who had called for the complete severance of relations with Britain.

== Trials and punishments ==
In January 1934, Howell and Robert Hinds, another pioneer of the Rastafari movement, were arrested and charged with sedition due to their gatherings and speeches at a meeting of 300 people at Seaforth, St Thomas, on 10 December 1933.

Howell was put on trial for sedition on 13 March 1934, and pleaded not guilty to openly expressing hatred and contempt for the Jamaican government and the King in addition to disturbing public peace on the island. Howell defended himself in court, using a photograph of Haile Selassie as evidence. During this historic trial, Howell is remembered as being the first person to declare that Haile Selassie was &quot;the Messiah returned to earth&quot;. Ultimately he was sentenced to two years in jail for sedition by the Jamaican chief justice, Robert William Lyall-Grant.

Later, in 1938, Howell was sent to a mental asylum in Kingston called the Bellevue Asylum after being certified as insane for the inflammatory statements he published in his book &quot;The Promised Key&quot;. In this publication, which was released while Howell was still incarcerated, he labelled the Roman Catholic Pope as &quot;Satan the Devil&quot; and created the impression that war was being declared against colonialism and white supremacy – which Howell asserted should be replaced with &quot;Black supremacy&quot;. Furthermore, he openly objected to locally created religious systems like Revivalism and Obeah, a Jamaican folk practice. Although small, the book was powerful and very popular to the dismay of the Jamaican government.

As one of the most charismatic and outspoken of Rastafarian leaders, Howell was incarcerated at notably higher rates than other pioneers of the Rastafarian movement, such as Joseph Nathaniel Hibbert and Hinds. Described as &quot;the most persecuted Rastafarian to date&quot;, Howell suffered considerably under constant state surveillance because of his Rastafarian teachings. Especially threatening to the powers that be was his prophetic call for people to destroy the legitimacy of &quot;international white supremacy&quot;, a message that caused people to reconsider their identity, agency and socio-political mobilization in Jamaica and elsewhere.

== Creation of Pinnacle Community ==
Following his release from prison for his teachings and denunciation of colonial rule, Howell created the first Rastafarian village in Jamaica at Sligoville, St. Catherine in 1940. The settlement was called &quot;Pinnacle&quot; due to its high hilltop elevation and was symbolically located in the first free village established to house former slaves in Jamaica. Pinnacle was one of the country’s first self-sustaining communities, its community members were able to meet their needs without dependence on outside resources. Some refer to Pinnacle as a commune, in which Howell&#x27;s form of socialism was practiced. Soon after its foundation, other similar Rastafarian communities were established across the country. Pinnacle was especially known for the cultivation of ganja (marijuana) that has religious significance for Rastafarians. 
In efforts to shut down Howell and his followers, police raided Howell’s community of Pinnacle multiple times and labeled the community a &quot;communist experiment&quot; in 1941. Just one year after the creation of the settlement, government forces infiltrated and arrested many of Howell&#x27;s followers. After escaping immediate arrest, Howell was eventually arrested and tried once again for sedition and consequently was faced with two more years behind bars. Upon his release in 1943, he returned to Pinnacle once again. Howell hired guards and brought in watch dogs to protect Pinnacle from future attacks.

The police raided Pinnacle several more times in the 1950s. In 1954, militia invaded the community and almost completely destroyed the village. Even after this mass destruction, settlers returned, though the settlement was never restored to its previous thriving state. During a final raid in 1958, the police cleared out the remaining residents completely. Despite its ultimate destruction, the impact of the settlement made it legendary among other settlements around the country, who were observed to have been &quot;miniature Pinnacles&quot;.

== Alleged disappearance and ongoing legacy ==
Some claim that Howell disappeared from public sight between 1958 and 1960, completely dropping out of his role as a Rastafarian leader. Accounts that he was neither heard from nor interacted with between this period and his death in 1981 have been challenged by historians who examined his life, however. Even after the final major raid of Pinnacle and Howell&#x27;s confinement in a mental asylum, he reportedly continued in his leadership of the Pinnacle community and as a Rastafari foundational role model, as evidenced by his role as a defendant in several cases at the Home Circuit Court, Kingston, regarding disputes about his ownership of Pinnacle. 

Today Howell is remembered as a pioneer of the Rastafarian movement. Additionally, in honour of his values and persistent fight against colonial authority, he is seen as a leader of Pan-Africanism. To fight for his remembrance, the Leonard P. Howell Foundation was created to &quot;perpetuate and honor the memory of Leonard P. Howell.&quot; The Foundation calls for the restoration of a portion of the Pinnacle Property so that it can become a UNESCO world heritage site, an international Rastafarian worship and research center, and a monument in tribute to the vision and leadership of Leonard Percival Howell.

<text>Takht-e Soleymān () or Adur Gushnasp, is an archaeological site in West Azerbaijan, Iran dating back to the Sasanian Empire. It lies midway between Urmia and Hamadan, very near the present-day town of Takab, and west of Tehran.

The fortified site, which is located on a hill created by the outflow of a calcium-rich spring pond, was recognized as a World Heritage Site in July 2003. The citadel includes the remains of Adur Gushnasp, a Zoroastrian fire temple built during the Sasanian era and partially rebuilt (as a mosque) under the Ilkhanate. This temple housed one of the three &quot;Great Fires&quot; or &quot;Royal Fires&quot; that Sassanid rulers humbled themselves before in order to ascend the throne. The fire at Takht-i Soleiman was called Adur Gushnasp and was dedicated to the &quot;arteshtar&quot; or the warrior class of the Sassanid. A 4th century Armenian manuscript relating to Jesus and Zoroaster, and various historians of the Islamic period, mention this pond. The foundations of the fire temple around the pond is attributed to that legend. Takht-e Soleyman appears on the 4th century Peutinger Map.

This site got its biblical name after the Muslim conquest of Persia in the 7th century. Folk legend relates that King Solomon used to imprison monsters inside a nearby 100m deep crater which is called &quot;Zendan-e Soleyman&quot; &quot;Prison of Solomon&quot;. Solomon is also said to have created the flowing pond in the fortress.

Archaeological excavations have revealed traces of a 5th-century BC occupation during the Achaemenid era, as well as later Parthian settlements in the citadel. Coins belonging to the reign of Sassanid shahs, and that of the Byzantine emperor Theodosius II (AD 408–450), have also been discovered there.

== Ilkhanid period of Takht-e Soleyman ==
Situated in the province of Azerbaijan of northwestern Iran, the remains of the Takht-e Soleyman complex can be found upon a grassy plain, surrounded by a volcanic mountain region. Meaning “the Throne of Solomon” in Persian, Sughurlukh in Turkish, translating to “a place abounding in marmots”, Takht-e Soleyman was built in the thirteenth century under the Ilkhanid dynasty as a summer and hunting palace. Beforehand, the site was a Zoroastrian fire temple, which was the state religion of the Sasanian dynasty, which they built during the fifth century. The Ilkhanid patron, Abaqa Khan (r.1265-82), the second Ilkhan ruler and son of Hülagü, the first ruler of the Ilkhanid dynasty, chose this site for his summer residence partly because of the massive ruins remaining of the old fire temple and Sasanian palace. He could create his complex using the ancient layout and general direction to help dictate his own architectural plan. Choosing this historic site in Iran also legitimized their presence within previous Iranian culture. The Ilkhanids wanted to integrate themselves into the historical Iranian fabric, hence them using the pre-existing and pre-Islamic Sasanian structure to build their own post-Islamic and Mongol inspired complex.

=== Context ===
The complex was created during the early phase of the Ilkhanid empire, and was a synthesis of Iranian and Central/Eastern Asian traditions. During the reign of Hülagü, the Ilkhanids experienced great success in continuously conquering lands, so the province of Azerbaijan in Iran and three Iranian cities nearby (Tabriz, Maragha, and Khoi), as well as an &quot;ordū&quot; (royal encampment) on the Jaghatu river, became the political headquarters for the dynasty now in Iran. This was partially due to the natural advantages of the landscape, with high mountains that sloped to lowland plains, a warm climate around Lake Urmia (the large body of water in the proximity of the complex), and lush, fertile grounds for ideal agriculture. The Ilkhanids were originally used to a nomadic Mongol lifestyle, living in tent encampments as their proper residences. Therefore, families could easily flock to this livable, fertile and safe land to set up their tents. However, now in Iranian land and upon new cultural and architectural influences, Ilkhanid nobility built Takht-e Soleyman, actually settling into the land and incorporating both nomadic and sedentary architecture. Also, Hülagü was focused on conquering Syria and Egypt, so his son wanted to continue his original plan after his father&#x27;s death. The construction of this site began soon after Abaqa&#x27;s accession, possibly beginning in 1271, and he decided to stay close to the dynasty&#x27;s current main headquarters in northwestern Iran, close to Syria and Egypt. Overall, he built this magnificent summer resort for himself, those in the Ilkhanid court living in the nearby city of Maragha and in the Jaghatū &quot;ordū&quot;. In the end, the site of Takht-e Soleyman was extremely beneficial due to historical, geographical, social, and political reasons.

=== Influences ===
The Ilkhanids were not originally an Islamic dynasty, but as they settled into the Iranian lands and established a new kingdom, they needed to adapt. They converted to the main religion of their new territory, and intertwined the established art and architectural traditions of their new home with the traditions of Mongols and those from Eastern Asia. They combined temporary and permanent architecture together, which is evident at Takht-e Soleyman, the only surviving secular structure of the Ilkhanid period. This complex has the tangible ability to show the connection between China and Iran through the layout and decorations. There were polygonal shaped tower structures said to be based on the shape of Mongol tents. There are Chinese motifs such as dragons and phoenix found on rectangular tiles from Takht-e Soleyman, showing the transmission of cultural motifs deliberately chosen by the Ilkhanids. The plan itself is reminiscent of the Mongol headquarters in China, which was inspired by a traditional Chinese city plan, as well as a classic Mongol nomadic camp. This links the Ilkhanid empire to great and powerful dynasties from the East, in a line of dynastic artistic traditions. The activities within Takht-e Soleyman are also similar to those in the pleasure palaces of those in China, where there was plenty room for hunting within the structure&#x27;s walls, and there was a lake on the palace grounds. The Ilkhanids also conducted administrative and courtly duties within this summer outpost, with many trials, appointments with foreign rulers and courts, celebrations, and enthronements. It was a place for the elite to get away from the busier cities and the wars, a place for retreat filled with colorful decorations, luxuries for the Ilkhanid court and soldiers, and a place for important activities to be fulfilled.

=== The complex ===
Takht-e Soleyman, constructed by Ilkhanid ruler Abaqa and later completed by his son Arghun, is an Ilkhanid summer palace situated directly on top of the ruins of the Sasanian sanctuary. The palace is oriented cardinally as in Mongol tradition with the entire complex being surrounded by a fortified ovular wall. Within this wall, the complex consists of a large courtyard with an artificial lake at its center. The entire courtyard is framed by porticoes, four iwan complexes in each cardinal direction, and “several polygonal structures”. Two large rectangular halls are placed in front of the south iwan and connect the surrounding ovular wall with the porticoed courtyard of the palace proper. An audience hall with a large dome is located behind the north iwan on the location of what was the Sasanian fire temple. While the north and south iwans are centered on porticoed walls of the complex, the east and west iwans are placed on the northern edges. The hall behind the west iwan stands between two polygonal structures, specifically octagonal chambers to the south and north of the iwan, which served as the throne room and later as a residence for the Ilkhanid ruler. Plaster remnants on the floor within the west iwan provide evidence that the dome of the southern chamber room was elaborately decorated with muqarnas. The walls of the palace, but specifically the northern chamber attached to the west iwan, were decorated with painted stucco on the upper sections and on the lower sections, the dado, with elaborate luster tiles in the lajvardina technique. These tiled designs consisted mostly of stars and similar geometric shapes and also included heroic figural imagery. There were also friezes across many walls with similar geometric and figural designs in addition to inscriptions. The muqarnas and luster tiles, as well as the painted stucco walls, all demonstrate the importance of lavish decoration of Ilkhanid architecture, especially with palatial structures. Furthermore, Takht-e Soleyman demonstrates the importance the Ilkhanids placed on secular architecture.

=== Muqarnas ceiling ===
Excavated from under the ruins of Takht-e Soleyman, specifically in the southern octagonal chamber of the west iwan, is a stucco plate now kept in Tehran at the National Museum of Iran. On this gypsum plate is a muqarnas plan believed to correspond to one quarter of the muqarnas vault of the southern chamber of the west iwan. This muqarnas plate is of the earliest known examples of an Islamic architectural plan for a muqarnas design. Although now broken into several pieces, the design on the plate consists of a geometric grid, 42 cm in length, for a curved muqarnas design. The majority of the design consists of squares, rhombi, and isosceles triangles all arranged along a diagonal axis with the empty upper right corner corresponding to the center of the muqarnas vault. The angles of each element are in multiples of 45° with few exceptions.

Scholars and archeologist of Islamic architecture have made numerous attempts to reconstruct the designs of the muqarnas plate found at Takht-e Soleyman to then understand what the muqarnas might have looked like in the palace. These scholars have based their designs in historical and cultural context by referencing the writings by Islamic mathematician and astronomer Ghiyath al-Din al-Kashi (in which he describes the use, design, and construction of muqarnas), various structures of the same Ilkhanid time period that contain muqarnas (the Great Mosque of Natanz and the tomb of Shaykh Abd al-Samad al-Isfahani of Natanz), previous interpretations of the muqarnas plate (chiefly of experts Ulrich Harb and Mohammad-Ali Jalal Yaghan), as well as the muqarnas traditions used today directly inherited through the traditions of the Ilkhanid period (as with the muqarnas workshops of Fez, Morocco).

=== Takht-e Soleyman tiles ===
Tiles found at Takht-e Soleyman are great artistic marks that demonstrate the interaction with and influence from China during the fourteenth century. There were six types of tiles: unglazed, partly glazed, monochrome glazed, luster-painting, Lajvardina (cobalt blue and white), and inglazed Lajvardina. The exterior tiles, including unglazed, partly glazed and monochrome glazed, are shaped as hexagons and composed with reddish clay, with turquoise or blue coloring. The design is inspired by Mongol and Chinese ceramics, mainly from ceramics including dragon or phoenix motifs, and an interwoven line design. On the other hand, interior tiles include the luster-painting, Lajvardina and inglazed Lajvardina. They were white and yellow glazed, and were also usually hexagonal shaped. Regarding design, these tiles included multiple objects with floral, animal and human subjects, such as a horse rider surrounded by a floral arc. Geometric patterns were very prevalent, with the inclusion of interwoven lines, hexagon shaped tiles, and eight-pointed star symbols, deriving from Chinese ceramics that were very popular with Iranian merchants during the fourteenth century. The highly skilled glazing upon the tiles with their surface patterns in blue and white can be followed back to the Islamic city of Baghdad.

Takht-e Soleyman&#x27;s tile decorations show a mixing of multiple cultures, using artistic traditions from Buddhism, Chinese mythology, and pre-Islamic Iran, and the current Islamic world itself. For example, the lotus flower, which is adopted from the Buddhist religion, is often used in floral designs as a symbol for wealth or is viewed as sacred. Secondly, as mentioned before, the dragon was a common motif related with Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism. It presented notions of sovereignty, and was viewed as the ancestor of all existing animals. The reinterpretation of a dragon or a lotus flower in an Iranian-Islamic way expanded the diversity of Islamic art in the medieval period. Thirdly, birds can also be seen in the tiles, specifically the crane, symbolizing longevity and wisdom from Chinese mythology. Mongol traditions are reflected in the frequent, deep blue color of the tiles, representing the sky or eternity. Also, there are Mongol scenes of horsemen hunting, expressing their important military matters.

Iranian elements, on the other hand, are also expressed in the Takht-e Soleyman tiles. These are mainly literary themes from the Shahnameh, the ‘Book of Kings’. The Shahnameh is a historical account of Iranian kings (shahs) and mythological matters through the use of calligraphy and illustrations. For example, a tile has an image of Fereydun, one of the legendary pre-Islamic Iranian kings, seen defeating the tyrant Zahhak. There is a tile with the image of the 5th century Sasanian monarch Bahram V, shown hunting deer with his slave Azada. Another scene is explained with calligraphy using a luster painting of Rustam (a famous Iranian warrior frequently included in the Shahnameh) killing his son, Sohrab. Using stories and images from the Shahnameh contributes to the integration of the Ilkhanid monarch into Iranian history, showing how Mongols are not just foreigners, but successors of Iran. There are also religious themes on the tiles, presented through Qur’an quotes, mentioning themes from the Shi’a branch of Islam. Many of the tiles were produced by craftsmen who followed the Shi’a path, where a hexagonal, exterior tile has the name ‘Ali’, the Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s cousin, around the border six times.

The British explorers Theodore and Mabel Bent dug “in front of a mosque” at the site in early May 1889, returning to London later with at least one tile fragment.

<doc id="1057785" wikidata="Q419557" url="?curid=1057785" title="Digestive enzyme">
<text>Digestive enzymes take part in the chemical process of digestion, which follows the mechanical process of digestion. Food consists of macromolecules of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats that need to be broken down chemically by digestive enzymes in the mouth, stomach, pancreas, and duodenum, before being able to be absorbed into the bloodstream. Initial breakdown is achieved by chewing (mastication) and the use of digestive enzymes of saliva. Once in the stomach further mechanical churning takes place mixing the food with secreted gastric acid. Digestive gastric enzymes take part in some of the chemical process needed for absorption. Most of the enzymatic activity, and hence absorption takes place in the duodenum.
Digestive enzymes are found in the digestive tracts of animals (including humans) and in the tracts of carnivorous plants, where they aid in the digestion of food, as well as inside cells, especially in their lysosomes, where they function to maintain cellular survival.

Digestive enzymes are classified based on their target substrates: lipases split fatty acids into fats and oils;
proteases and peptidases split proteins into small peptides and amino acids;
amylases split carbohydrates such as starch and sugars into simple sugars such as glucose,
and nucleases split nucleic acids into nucleotides.

==Types==

Digestive enzymes are found throughout much of the gastrointestinal tract. In the human digestive system, the main sites of digestion are the mouth, stomach, and small intestine. Digestive enzymes are secreted by different exocrine glands including salivary glands, gastric glands, secretory cells in the pancreas, and secretory glands in the small intestine. In some carnivorous plants plant-specific digestive enzymes are used to break down their captured organisms.

===Mouth===
Complex food substances that are eaten must be broken down into simple, soluble, and diffusible substances before they can be absorbed. In the oral cavity, salivary glands secrete an array of enzymes and substances that aid in digestion and also disinfection. They include the following:
* Lingual lipase: Lipid digestion initiates in the mouth. Lingual lipase starts the digestion of the lipids/fats.
* Salivary amylase: Carbohydrate digestion also initiates in the mouth. Amylase, produced by the salivary glands, breaks complex carbohydrates, mainly cooked starch, to smaller chains, or even simple sugars. It is sometimes referred to as ptyalin.
* Lysozyme: Considering that food contains more than just essential nutrients, e.g. bacteria or viruses, the lysozyme offers a limited and non-specific, yet beneficial antiseptic function in digestion.

Of note is the diversity of the salivary glands. There are two types of salivary glands:
* Serous glands: These glands produce a secretion rich in water, electrolytes, and enzymes. A great example of a serous oral gland is the parotid gland.
* Mixed glands: These glands have both serous cells and mucous cells, and include sublingual and submandibular glands. Their secretion is mucinous and high in viscosity.

===Stomach===

The enzymes that are secreted in the stomach are &quot;gastric enzymes&quot;. The stomach plays a major role in digestion, both in a mechanical sense by mixing and crushing the food, and also in an enzymatic sense, by digesting it. The following are enzymes produced by the stomach and their respective function: 
* Pepsin is the main gastric enzyme. It is produced in the stomach by gastric chief cells in its inactive form pepsinogen, which is a zymogen. Pepsinogen is then activated by the stomach acid into its active form, pepsin. Pepsin breaks down the protein in the food into smaller particles, such as peptide fragments and amino acids. Protein digestion, therefore, primarily starts in the stomach, unlike carbohydrate and lipids, which start their digestion in the mouth (however, trace amounts of the enzyme kallikrein, which catabolises certain protein, is found in saliva in the mouth).
* Gastric lipase: Gastric lipase is an acidic lipase secreted by the gastric chief cells in the fundic mucosa of the stomach. It has a pH level of 3–6. Gastric lipase, together with lingual lipase, comprise the two acidic lipases. These lipases, unlike alkaline lipases (such as pancreatic lipase), do not require bile acid or colipase for optimal enzymatic activity. Acidic lipases make up 30% of lipid hydrolysis occurring during digestion in the human adult, with gastric lipase contributing the most of the two acidic lipases. In neonates, acidic lipases are much more important, providing up to 50% of total lipolytic activity.
* Cathepsin F: is a cysteine protease.

===Pancreas===

Pancreas is both an endocrine and an exocrine gland, in that it functions to produce endocrinic hormones released into the circulatory system (such as insulin, and glucagon), to control glucose metabolism, and also to secrete digestive / exocrinic pancreatic juice, which is secreted eventually via the pancreatic duct into the duodenum. Digestive or exocrine function of pancreas is as significant to the maintenance of health as its endocrine function.

Two of the population of cells in the pancreatic parenchyma make up its digestive enzymes:
* Ductal cells: Mainly responsible for production of bicarbonate (HCO3), which acts to neutralize the acidity of the stomach chyme entering duodenum through the pylorus. Ductal cells of the pancreas are stimulated by the hormone secretin to produce their bicarbonate-rich secretions, in what is in essence a bio-feedback mechanism; highly acidic stomach chyme entering the duodenum stimulates duodenal cells called &quot;S cells&quot; to produce the hormone secretin and release to the bloodstream. Secretin having entered the blood eventually comes into contact with the pancreatic ductal cells, stimulating them to produce their bicarbonate-rich juice. Secretin also inhibits production of gastrin by &quot;G cells&quot;, and also stimulates acinar cells of the pancreas to produce their pancreatic enzyme.
* Acinar cells: Mainly responsible for production of the inactive pancreatic enzymes (zymogens) that, once present in the small bowel, become activated and perform their major digestive functions by breaking down proteins, fat, and DNA/RNA. Acinar cells are stimulated by cholecystokinin (CCK), which is a hormone/neurotransmitter produced by the intestinal cells (I cells) in the duodenum. CCK stimulates production of the pancreatic zymogens.

Pancreatic juice, composed of the secretions of both ductal and acinar cells, contains the following digestive enzymes:
* Trypsinogen, which is an inactive(zymogenic) protease that, once activated in the duodenum into trypsin, breaks down proteins at the basic amino acids. Trypsinogen is activated via the duodenal enzyme enterokinase into its active form trypsin.
* Chymotrypsinogen, which is an inactive (zymogenic) protease that, once activated by duodenal enterokinase, turns into chymotrypsin and breaks down proteins at their aromatic amino acids. Chymotrypsinogen can also be activated by trypsin.
* Carboxypeptidase, which is a protease that takes off the terminal amino acid group from a protein
* Several elastases that degrade the protein elastin and some other proteins
* Pancreatic lipase that degrades triglycerides into two fatty acids and a monoglyceride
* Sterol esterase
* Phospholipase
* Several nucleases that degrade nucleic acids, like DNAase and RNAase
* Pancreatic amylase that breaks down starch and glycogen which are alpha-linked glucose polymers. Humans lack the cellulases to digest the carbohydrate cellulose which is a beta-linked glucose polymer.

Some of the preceding endogenous enzymes have pharmaceutical counterparts (pancreatic enzymes) that are administered to people with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

The pancreas&#x27;s exocrine function owes part of its notable reliability to biofeedback mechanisms controlling secretion of the juice. The following significant pancreatic biofeedback mechanisms are essential to the maintenance of pancreatic juice balance/production:
* Secretin, a hormone produced by the duodenal &quot;S cells&quot; in response to the stomach chyme containing high hydrogen atom concentration (high acidity), is released into the blood stream; upon return to the digestive tract, secretion decreases gastric emptying, increases secretion of the pancreatic ductal cells, as well as stimulating pancreatic acinar cells to release their zymogenic juice.
* Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a unique peptide released by the duodenal &quot;I cells&quot; in response to chyme containing high fat or protein content. Unlike secretin, which is an endocrine hormone, CCK actually works via stimulation of a neuronal circuit, the end-result of which is stimulation of the acinar cells to release their content. CCK also increases gallbladder contraction, resulting in bile squeezed into the cystic duct, common bile duct and eventually the duodenum. Bile of course helps absorption of the fat by emulsifying it, increasing its absorptive surface. Bile is made by the liver, but is stored in the gallbladder.
* Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) is produced by the mucosal duodenal cells in response to chyme containing high amounts of carbohydrate, proteins, and fatty acids. Main function of GIP is to decrease gastric emptying.
* Somatostatin is a hormone produced by the mucosal cells of the duodenum and also the &quot;delta cells&quot; of the pancreas. Somatostatin has a major inhibitory effect, including on pancreatic production.

===Duodenum===

The following enzymes/hormones are produced in the duodenum:
* secretin: This is an endocrine hormone produced by the duodenal &quot;S cells&quot; in response to the acidity of the gastric chyme.
* Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a unique peptide released by the duodenal &quot;I cells&quot; in response to chyme containing high fat or protein content. Unlike secretin, which is an endocrine hormone, CCK actually works via stimulation of a neuronal circuit, the end-result of which is stimulation of the acinar cells to release their content. CCK also increases gallbladder contraction, causing release of pre-stored bile into the cystic duct, and eventually into the common bile duct and via the ampulla of Vater into the second anatomic position of the duodenum. CCK also decreases the tone of the sphincter of Oddi, which is the sphincter that regulates flow through the ampulla of Vater. CCK also decreases gastric activity and decreases gastric emptying, thereby giving more time to the pancreatic juices to neutralize the acidity of the gastric chyme.
* Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP): This peptide decreases gastric motility and is produced by duodenal mucosal cells.
* motilin: This substance increases gastro-intestinal motility via specialized receptors called &quot;motilin receptors&quot;.
* somatostatin: This hormone is produced by duodenal mucosa and also by the delta cells of the pancreas. Its main function is to inhibit a variety of secretory mechanisms.

Throughout the lining of the small intestine there are numerous brush border enzymes whose function is to further break down the chyme released from the stomach into absorbable particles. These enzymes are absorbed whilst peristalsis occurs. Some of these enzymes include:
* Various exopeptidases and endopeptidases including dipeptidase and aminopeptidases that convert peptones and polypeptides into amino acids.
* Maltase: converts maltose into glucose.
* Lactase: This is a significant enzyme that converts lactose into glucose and galactose. A majority of Middle-Eastern and Asian populations lack this enzyme. This enzyme also decreases with age. As such lactose intolerance is often a common abdominal complaint in the Middle-Eastern, Asian, and older populations, manifesting with bloating, abdominal pain, and osmotic diarrhea.
* Sucrase: converts sucrose into glucose and fructose.
* Other disaccharidases

===Plants===
In carnivorous plants, digestive enzymes and acids break down insects and in some plants small animals. In some plants, the leaf collapses on the prey to increase contact, others have a small vessel of digestive liquid. Then digestion fluids are used to digest the prey to get at the needed nitrates and phosphorus. The absorption of the needed nutrients are usually more efficient than in other plants. Digestive enzymes independently came about in carnivorous plants and animals.

Some carnivorous plants like the &quot;Heliamphora&quot; do not use digestive enzymes, but use bacteria to break down the food. These plants do not have digestive juices, but use the rot of the prey.

Some carnivorous plants digestive enzymes:
* &quot;Hydrolytic process&quot;
* Esterase a hydrolase enzyme
* Proteases enzyme
* Nucleases enzyme
* Phosphatases enzyme
* Glucanases enzyme
* Peroxidases enzyme
* Ureas an organic compounds
* Chitinase enzyme

== Clinical significance ==

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and alpha amylase inhibitors are found in several raw plants such as cinnamon. They are used as anti-diabetic drugs. Studies have shown that the use of raw cinnamon offers potential anti-diabetic therapeutic use.

<doc id="1057827" wikidata="Q616714" url="?curid=1057827" title="IGES">
<text>The Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) is a vendor-neutral file format that allows the digital exchange of information among computer-aided design (CAD) systems. It is an ASCII-based textual format.

The official title of IGES is Digital Representation for Communication of Product Definition Data, first published in March, 1980 by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards as NBSIR 80-1978. Many documents (like early versions of the Defense Standards MIL-PRF-28000 and MIL-STD-1840) referred to it as [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] Y14.26M, the designation of the ANSI committee that approved IGES Version 1.0.

Using IGES, a CAD user can exchange product data models in the form of circuit diagrams, wireframe, freeform surface, boundary (B-rep) or solid modeling (CSG) representations. Applications supported by IGES include traditional engineering drawings, models for analysis, and other manufacturing functions.

==History==
IGES was an initiative of the United States Air Force (USAF) Integrated Computer Aided Manufacturing (ICAM) project (1976-1984).

ICAM sought to develop procedures (IDEF), processes (Group Technology), and software (CAD/CAM) that would integrate all operations in Aerospace manufacturing and thus greatly reduce costs. Earlier the USAF Manufacturing Technology Program had funded the Automatically Programmed Tools (APT) language for programming Numerically Controlled (NC) machine tools. To close the data gap between parts design and manufacturing, one of the ICAM goals was to develop CAD software that would automatically generate numerical control programs for the very complex Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machine tools used throughout the Aerospace industry. A serious issue was the incompatibility of data produced by the many CAD systems in use at the time. USAF/ICAM called a meeting at the National Bureau of Standards (now known as National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST) in 1978 to address this issue. Boeing offered to sell its CAD translation software to USAF for one United States dollar. USAF accepted this offer and contracted NIST to bring together a group of users and vendors, including Boeing, General Electric, Xerox, Computervision, Applicon and others to further develop and test this software. Though it was the practice to begin the name of ICAM developments with the word integrated (for example the IDEFs) believing that there would be rapid development of graphical exchange software, USAF decided that the IGES would be the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification not the Integrated Graphics Exchange Specification.

Since 1988, the DoD has required that all digital product and manufacturing information (PMI) for weapons systems contracts (the engineering drawings, circuit diagrams, &quot;etc&quot;.) be delivered in electronic form such as IGES format. As a result, CAx software vendors who want to market their products to DoD subcontractors and their partners needed to support the import (reading) and export (writing) of IGES format files.

An ANSI standard since 1980, IGES has been used in the automotive, aerospace, and shipbuilding industries. It has been used for weapons systems from Trident missile guidance systems to entire aircraft carriers. These part models may have to be used years after the vendor of the original design system has gone out of business. IGES files provide a way to access this data decades from now. Today, plugin viewers for Web browsers allow IGES files created 20 years ago to be viewed from anywhere in the world.

After the initial release of STEP (ISO 10303) in 1994, interest in further development of IGES declined, and Version 5.3 (1996) was the last published standard.

==File format==
An IGES file is composed of 80-character ASCII records, a record length derived from the punched card era. Text strings are represented in &quot;Hollerith&quot; format, the number of characters in the string, followed by the letter &quot;H&quot;, followed by the text string, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;4HSLOT&quot; (this is the text string format used in early versions of the Fortran language). Early IGES translators had problems with IBM mainframe computers because the mainframes used EBCDIC encoding for text, and some EBCDIC-ASCII translators would either substitute the wrong character, or improperly set the parity bit, causing a misread.

Here is a very small IGES file from 1987, containing only two POINT (Type 116), two CIRCULAR ARC (Type 100), and two LINE (Type 110) entities. It represents a slot, with the points at the centers of the two half-circles that form the ends of the slot, and the two lines that form the sides.

The file is divided into 5 sections: Start, Global, Directory Entry, Parameter Data, and Terminate indicated by the characters S, G, D, P, or T in column 73. The characteristics and geometric information for an entity is split between two sections; one in a two record, fixed-length format (the Directory Entry, or DE Section), the other in a multiple record, comma delimited format (the Parameter Data, or PD Section), as can be seen in a more human-readable representation of the file.

When displayed, the user should see two yellow points (hard to see on a white background, but most CAD systems use a black background), one located at the origin of model space [0,0,0], two red circular arcs, and two green lines.

==Foreign-language support==

Due to its growing international popularity (several countries, including Australia and the UK, adopted IGES as their own National Standards for PMI interoperability), support was added to the TEXT (Type 212) entity to support the ISO 8859 (Latin-1) alphabet for European characters.

In the 1990s, IGES added support for the JIS encoding for Kanji () as double-byte characters (JIS-6226), allowing members of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) to exchange part models with their American and European partners without loss of the Kanji text.

The current version of IGES does not support Unicode 16- or 32-bit character encoding, so Arabic and other scripts (like Thai) cannot be represented.

==A recursive standard==
One of the unique features of the IGES standard is that it was the first ANSI standard to be documented using itself. Since Version 4.0, all of the technical illustrations for the printed version of the standard have been generated from IGES files. The electronic publishing system (LaTeX) integrates raster images generated from IGES files into the PostScript sent to the laser printer, so text and images are printed on the same page for subsequent use as camera-ready copy for commercial publication. Beginning with IGES Version 5.2, this is how the standard was generated, and Version 5.3 (the most recent ANSI-approved version) is available as a PDF document.

Many of the illustrations (all of which conform to the Defense Department&#x27;s MIL-D-28000 Engineering Drawings Subset of IGES) use the entities that they describe, e.g., the illustration of the LEADER (ARROW) ENTITY (Type 214) can be used as a test case for translator implementers, because it contains all 12 arrow head styles defined by the standard. These WYSIWYG example files can be distinguished by a leading &quot;F&quot; and trailing &quot;X&quot; in the file name (like f214x.igs), and this library is called the IGES X-files by members of the IGES community.

Here is one of the example figures, Figure 2 from Appendix A (fmeparte.igs), that has appeared in every version of IGES since Version 3.0. It uses linear, angular, and ordinate dimension entities, as well as examples of both circular and conic arcs. It is usually the first part used when testing an IGES translator, because the standard has a picture of what it should look like.

<text>World Squash, formerly World Squash Federation, is the international federation for the indoor racket sport of squash. It is recognised by the International Olympic Committee. It is also a member of the Global Association of International Sports Federations and the Association of the IOC Recognised International Sports Federations.

==Background==
It is based in Hastings in England. As of 2021 it has 122 member federations. The first squash court was built in England in 1865; there are now around 50,000 courts in more than 185 nations worldwide. To harness this growth and to promote and co-ordinate the sport, the International Squash Rackets Federation was formed in 1967, its name being changed in 1992 to the World Squash Federation. 2025 it changed its name to World Squash.

==Presidents==
Below is the list of presidents since 1967 :

==Membership==
World Squash has 122 Members, all of whom are National Associations of squash, recognised by their National Olympic Committee (NOC) or Ministry of Sport as the sole and undisputed governing body for the sport in the country. Members are required to join one of the five Regional Federations which are an integral part of the World Squash structure. Members receive a number of votes to be used at General Meetings depending on the number of squash courts in their country.

==Management==

World Squash is managed by an executive board (the board), responsible for day-to-day control of the Federation and an executive committee (ExCo) which assists the board in the strategy and policy making process. Members of the board are elected at general meetings and consist of a president and three vice-presidents, who each serve four year terms of office. One additional vice-president may be co-opted on an annual basis if required.

ExCo comprises all members of the board plus one regional vice-president appointed by each of the five Regional Federations. The chairman of the Athletes Commission and a representative of PSA are members of ExCo.

The board is supported by a number of committees, commissions and panels whose members are volunteers with specialist knowledge coming from the Regional Federations and Player Association. World Squash employs professional staff who are responsible for implementing the decisions of these bodies whose main activities are described below.

==Actions==

===World calendar of events===
World Squash works closely with the Player Association – the Professional Squash Association (PSA) – to control and co-ordinate the world calendar for squash. Championships are held in all major squash playing nations and are integrated with the World Championships and Major Games calendar to ensure that there are no clashes of dates.

===World Championships and major games===

The Championships Committee is responsible for running and promoting World Championships for men, women, juniors and masters at individual and team levels in both singles and doubles via National Federations. World Championships are run by World Squash Members, who tender for the events at least four years in advance. Team Championships are held every two years; and Open/Individual Championships are held annually. The committee is also responsible for ensuring that squash is represented in all major regional multi-sport games – squash is now included in the Pan-American Games, Asian Games, Commonwealth Games, World Games Pacific Games and All Africa Games. Starting with the 2028 Summer Olympic Games, Squash will be part of the Games.

===Olympic Games===
World Squash has established an Olympic Games Committee which is responsible for conducting a high-profile campaign for squash to be accepted as a full medal sport in the Olympic Games.

===Athletes Commission===
The Athletes Commission comprises representatives from PSA. The chairman, an athlete, reports to ExCo and represents the interests of the current players in areas such as Championship Regulations and implementation of the new WADA Code.

===Coaching and development===
World Squash encourages the development of squash, not only in countries where it is a new sport but also where it is already well-established. Advice on all development matters is given to members and is implemented through the group of World Squash specialists in the Coaching &amp; Development Committee and via &quot;best practice&quot; on the World Squash website. Committee Members identify needs for development projects in their regions and recommend activity plans to World Squash for resources and funding. The committee organises a Coaching Conference on an annual basis and runs coaching courses in new and developing squash nations to help develop local coaches. The committee also organises a management conference for senior executives in national associations so they can network, share resources and establish best practice on the World Squash website.

===Referees and rules===
The Referees Committee has responsibility for implementing and running a Referees’ Programme which trains, accredits and assesses the top grade World Squash Referees. A referees conference is organised on a biennial basis. The Rules Commission continually monitors the rules of the sport and makes recommendations for change. It also provides a very popular on-line rules answers service to the public at large on interpretation of the rules.

===Court and equipment specifications===
The Technical Committee sets standards for all technical aspects of squash, including court construction, rackets, balls, eye protection and clothing. It inspects and accredits court components which meet the specifications and works with its partner companies to promote good practice in court construction worldwide.

===Anti-doping===
The Anti-Doping Commission ensures that squash is fully compliant with the new WADA Code. The commission is responsible for establishing a Registered Testing Pool and an Athletes Whereabouts System for out-of-competition testing. It has established a panel of physicians which reviews Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUE) and calls on specialist Doping Hearing and Review Panels when required.

===Medical===
The Medical Commission generates positive guidelines for all medical aspects of playing and training for squash. It identifies and gives medical advice on topics such as eye protection, heart health, injury prevention and injury management.

===Ethics and disciplinary matters===
World Squash has established an independent Ethics Panel at the suggestion of the IOC. It also has a well-established Disciplinary Committee supported by an independent Appeals Panel when necessary – this is called upon very rarely.

===Promotion and publicity===
World Squash delivers an information and publicity service to squash players and the sports media worldwide. Press information is circulated regularly through the World Squash&#x27;s media services, who are also responsible for ensuring that up-to-date information on World Championships and other major squash events appears on the World Squash website.

===Squash 57===
World Squash renamed Racketball as Squash 57 in September 2015 to distinguish it from the sport of Racquetball, and in January 2017 updated the Standard Rules for it.

<doc id="1057847" wikidata="Q1426992" url="?curid=1057847" title="Flammarion engraving">
<text>The Flammarion engraving is a wood engraving by an unknown artist. Its first documented appearance is in the book (&quot;The Atmosphere: Popular Meteorology&quot;), published in 1888 by the French astronomer and writer Camille Flammarion. Several authors during the 20th century considered it to be either a Medieval or Renaissance artwork, but the current consensus is that it is a 19th century illustration that imitates older artistic styles and themes.

The illustration depicts a man, dressed as a pilgrim in a long robe and carrying a walking stick, who has reached a point where the flat Earth meets the firmament. The pilgrim kneels down and passes his head, shoulders, right arm, and the top of the walking stick through an opening in the firmament, which is depicted as covered on the inside by the stars, Sun, and Moon. Behind the sky, the pilgrim finds a marvelous realm of circling clouds, fires and suns. One of the elements of the cosmic machinery resembles traditional pictorial representations of the &quot;wheel in the middle of a wheel&quot; described in the visions of the Hebrew prophet Ezekiel.

The wood engraving has often, but erroneously, been referred to as a woodcut. It has been widely used as a metaphorical illustration of either the scientific or the mystical quests for knowledge. More recently, it has also been used as to represent a psychedelic experience.

In the early 20th century, the scholar Heinz Strauss dated the image to the period 1520–30, while Heinrich Röttinger suggested that it had been made in 1530–60. In 1957, historian of astronomy Ernst Zinner claimed that the image dated to the German Renaissance, but he was unable to find any version published earlier than 1906. The same image was used by psychoanalyst Carl Jung in his 1959 book &quot;Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies&quot;. Jung speculated that the image was a Rosicrucian engraving from the 17th century. The eminent art historian Erwin Panofsky also thought that illustration was from the 17th century, while his colleague Ernst Gombrich judged it to be modern. In 1970, Jung&#x27;s associate Marie-Louise von Franz reproduced and discussed the image in her book &quot;Number and Time&quot;, where it was captioned &quot;The hole open to eternity, the spiritual pilgrim discovering another world&quot;. Von Franz suggested that the image might be a 19th-century woodcut.

The image was traced to Flammarion&#x27;s book by Arthur Beer, an astrophysicist and historian of German science at Cambridge and, independently, by Bruno Weber, the curator of rare books at the Zürich central library. Weber argued that the work was a composite of images characteristic of different historical periods, and that it had been made with a burin, a tool used for wood engraving only since the late 18th century.

Flammarion had been apprenticed at the age of twelve to an engraver in Paris and it is believed that many of the illustrations for his books were engraved from his own drawings, probably under his supervision. Therefore, it is plausible that Flammarion himself created the image, though the evidence for this remains inconclusive. Like most other illustrations in Flammarion&#x27;s books, the engraving carries no attribution. Although sometimes referred to as a forgery or a hoax, Flammarion does not characterize the engraving as a medieval or renaissance woodcut, and the mistaken interpretation of the engraving as an older work did not occur until after Flammarion&#x27;s death. The decorative border surrounding the engraving is distinctly non-medieval and it was only by cropping it that the confusion about the historical origins of the image became possible.

According to Bruno Weber and to astronomer Joseph Ashbrook, the depiction of a spherical heavenly vault separating the Earth from an outer realm is similar to an illustration that begins the first chapter of Sebastian Münster&#x27;s &quot;Cosmographia&quot;, first published in 1544, a book which Flammarion, an ardent bibliophile and book collector, might have owned. However, in 2002 Hans Gerhard Senger, an expert on the works of Nicholas of Cusa, argued against the image having been first created by Flammarion.

== Context in Flammarion&#x27;s book ==
In Flammarion&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;atmosphère: météorologie populaire&quot;, the image is accompanied by a caption in French, which translates as: The illustration refers to the text on the facing page (p. 162), which also clarifies the author&#x27;s intent in using it as an illustration:

The same paragraph had already appeared, &quot;without&quot; the accompanying engraving, in an earlier edition of the text published under the title of &quot;L&#x27;atmosphère: description des grands phénomènes de la Nature&quot; (&quot;The Atmosphere: Description of the Great Phenomena of Nature,&quot; 1872). The correspondence between the text and the illustration is so close that one would appear to be based on the other. Had Flammarion known of the engraving in 1872, it seems unlikely that he would have left it out of that year&#x27;s edition, which was already heavily illustrated. The more probable conclusion therefore is that Flammarion commissioned the engraving specifically to illustrate this particular text, though this has not been ascertained conclusively.

==Possible literary sources==

The idea of the contact of the Earth with a solid sky is one that repeatedly appears in Flammarion&#x27;s earlier works. Commentators have suggested various literary passages that might have directly motivated the composition of the image in the Flammarion engraving. These included the Medieval legend of Saint Macarius the Roman, the &quot;Letters&quot; of François de La Mothe Le Vayer from the 17th century, and the classical argument for the infinitude of space attributed to Archytas of Tarentum (a friend of the philosopher Plato).

=== Legend of Saint Macarius ===

In his &quot;Les mondes imaginaires et les mondes réels&quot; (&quot;Imaginary Worlds and Real Worlds&quot;, 1864), Flammarion cites a legend of a Christian saint, Macarius the Roman, which he dates to the 6th century. This legend includes the story of three monks (Theophilus, Sergius, and Hyginus) who &quot;wished to discover the point where the sky and the earth touch&quot; (in Latin: &quot;ubi cœlum terræ se conjungit&quot;). After recounting the legend he remarks that &quot;the preceding monks hoped to go to heaven without leaving the earth, to find &#x27;the place where the sky and the earth touch,&#x27; and open the mysterious gateway which separates this world from the other. Such is the cosmographical notion of the universe; it is always the terrestrial valley crowned by the canopy of the heavens.&quot;

In the legend of St. Macarius, the monks do not in fact find the place where Earth and sky touch.

=== Letters of Le Vayer ===

In &quot;Les mondes imaginaires&quot; Flammarion recounts another story:

Flammarion also mentioned the same story, in nearly the same words, in his &quot;Histoire du Ciel&quot; (&quot;History of the Sky&quot;):

The &quot;Letters&quot; referred to are a series of short essays by François de La Mothe Le Vayer. In letter 89, Le Vayer, after mentioning Strabo&#x27;s scornful opinion of Pytheas&#x27;s account of a region in the far north where land, sea, and air seemed to mingle in a single gelatinous substance, adds:

Le Vayer does not specify who this &quot;anchorite&quot; was, nor does he provide further details about the story or its sources. Le Vayer&#x27;s comment was expanded upon by Pierre Estève in his &quot;Histoire generale et particuliere de l&#x27;astronomie&quot; (&quot;General and Particular History of Astronomy,&quot; 1755), where he interprets Le Vayer&#x27;s statement (without attribution) as a claim that Pytheas &quot;had arrived at a corner of the sky, and was obliged to stoop down in order not to touch it.&quot;

The combination of the story of St. Macarius with Le Vayer&#x27;s remarks seems to be due to Flammarion himself. It also appears in his &quot;Les terres du ciel&quot; (&quot;The Lands of the Sky&quot;):

=== Argument of Archytas ===

This historian of science Stefano Gattei has argued that the image in the engraving is directly inspired by an argument for the infinitude of space, due to the ancient Greek mathematician Archytas of Tarentum. Gattei quotes the version of this argument given in the commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot; by Simplicius of Cilicia, written in the 6th century CE:

== Later uses and interpretations ==

=== 1970s ===
The first color version to be published was made by Roberta Weir and distributed by Berkeley&#x27;s Print Mint in 1970. That color image spawned most of the modern variations that have followed since. Donovan&#x27;s 1973 LP, &quot;Cosmic Wheels&quot;, used an extended black and white version on its inner sleeve (an artist added elements extending the image to fit the proportions of the record jacket). The image also appeared in &quot;The Compleat Astrologer&quot; (pg. 25) by Derek and Julia Parker in 1971. In 1994, &#x27;The Secret Language of Birthdays&#x27; by Gary Goldschneider and Joost Elffers was published featuring this image.

The image was reproduced on the title page of the score of Brian Ferneyhough&#x27;s &quot;Transit: Six Solo Voices and Chamber Orchestra&quot;, published by Edition Peters in 1975.

British artist David Oxtoby made a drawing inspired by the Flammarion engraving (&quot;Spiritual Pilgrim&quot;), showing the face of David Bowie near the drawing&#x27;s right margin where the Sun should be. David Oxtoby&#x27;s drawing doesn&#x27;t show the crawling man at left.

=== 1980s–2000s ===
The Flammarion engraving appeared on the cover of Daniel J. Boorstin&#x27;s bestselling history of science &quot;The Discoverers&quot;, published in 1983. Other books devoted to science that used it as an illustration include &quot;The Mathematical Experience&quot; (1981) by Philip J. Davis and Reuben Hersh, &quot;Matter, Space, and Motion: Theories in Antiquity and Their Sequel&quot; (1988) by Richard Sorabji, &quot;Paradoxes of Free Will&quot; (2002) by Gunther Stent, and &quot;Uncentering the Earth: Copernicus and On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres&quot; (2006) by William T. Vollmann. Some books devoted to mysticism which have also used the engraving include &quot;Love and Law&quot; (2001) by Ernest Holmes and &quot;Gnosticism: New Light on the Ancient Tradition of Inner Knowing&quot; (2002) by Stephan A. Hoeller.

The 1989 &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; setting &quot;Spelljammer&quot; was loosely inspired by the Flammarion engraving at the suggestion of David &quot;Zeb&quot; Cook.

The Brazilian writer Olavo de Carvalho reproduced the engraving in his 1995 book &quot;O Jardim das Aflições&quot; (&quot;The Garden of Afflictions&quot;), offering it as an example of Renaissance views concerning the spiritual world, which he criticized: &quot;the pilgrim evades the mundane &#x27;sphere&#x27;, abandoning trees and flowers, Sun and Moon, birds and stars, to penetrate the marvelous kingdom of the spirit, which consists of some miserable gear wheels hidden among cloud wisps. Beautiful exchange!&quot;

=== 2010s ===
An interpretation of the image was used for the animated sequence about the cosmological vision of Giordano Bruno in the March 9, 2014 premiere of the TV series &quot;&quot;, hosted by the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.

In the German-language video series &quot;Von Aristoteles zur Stringtheorie&quot;, (&quot;From Aristotle to String Theory&quot;), which is hosted on YouTube and produced by &quot;Urknall, Weltall, und das Leben&quot;, and features Professor Joseph Gaßner as lecturer, a colored Flammarion engraving was selected as a logo, but the man is peering at a background filled with the important equations of physics.

=== 2020s ===
More recently in May 2021, an interpretation of the image has featured on a limited edition book release by Yusuf/Cat Stevens.

Niklas Åkerblad also known as El Huervo, in October 2021 released an album titled &quot;Flammarion&quot; in which the cover art for the album depicts an interpretation of the original Flammarion engraving.

The 2018 TV show Lodge 49 shows the Flammarion engraving in its opening credits (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKCAqrSXM6I).
