<doc id="1068520" wikidata="Q224069" url="?curid=1068520" title="The Island (2005 film)">
<text>The Island is a 2005 American science fiction action film directed and co-produced by Michael Bay and written by Caspian Tredwell-Owen, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, from a story by Tredwell-Owen. It stars Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansson, Djimon Hounsou, Sean Bean, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Steve Buscemi. The film is about Lincoln Six Echo (McGregor), who struggles to fit into the highly structured world in which he lives, isolated in a compound, and the series of events that unfold when he questions how truthful that world is. After Lincoln learns the compound inhabitants are clones used for organ harvesting as well as surrogates for wealthy people in the outside world, he attempts to escape with Jordan Two Delta (Johansson) and expose the illegal cloning movement.

&quot;The Island&quot; has been described as a pastiche of &quot;escape-from-dystopia&quot; science fiction films of the 1960s and 1970s, such as &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, &quot;THX 1138&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;. &quot;The Island&quot; cost $126 million to produce. The original score was composed by Steve Jablonsky, who went on to score Bay&#x27;s further works. It opened on July 22, 2005, by DreamWorks Pictures in North America and internationally by Warner Bros. Pictures, to mixed reviews, earning $36 million at the United States box office and $127 million overseas for a $162 million worldwide total.

==Plot==
On July 19, 2019, Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta live with others in an isolated compound. This dystopian community is governed by a strict set of rules. The residents are told that the outside world has become too contaminated to support life with the exception of a pathogen-free island. Each week, one resident gets to leave the compound and live on the island by way of a lottery.

Lincoln begins having dreams that he knows are not from his own experiences. Dr. Merrick, a scientist who runs the compound, is concerned and places probes in Lincoln&#x27;s body to monitor his cerebral activity. While secretly visiting an off-limits power facility in the basement where technician James McCord works, Lincoln discovers a live moth in a ventilation shaft, leading him to deduce the outside world is not really contaminated. Lincoln follows the moth to another section, where he discovers the &quot;lottery&quot; is actually a system to selectively remove inhabitants from the compound, where the &quot;winner&quot; is then used for organ harvesting, surrogate pregnancies, and other important purposes for each one&#x27;s wealthy sponsor, of whom they are clones.

Merrick learns Lincoln has discovered the truth about his existence, which forces Lincoln to escape. Meanwhile, Jordan has been selected for the island. Lincoln and Jordan escape the facility and emerge in the desert. Lincoln explains the truth to her, and they set out to discover the real world. Merrick hires Burkinabé mercenary and former GIGN operative Albert Laurent to find and return them to the compound.

Lincoln and Jordan find McCord, who explains that all the facility residents are clones of wealthy sponsors and are kept ignorant about the real world and conditioned to never question their environment or history. Merrick explains to Laurent that while the public is told that the clones are kept in a persistent vegetative state, trials had shown that the organs would only survive if the clones had consciousness.

McCord provides the name of Lincoln&#x27;s sponsor, yacht designer Tom Lincoln, in Los Angeles and helps them to the Yucca maglev station, where they board an Amtrak train to LA before mercenaries kill him. In New York City, Jordan&#x27;s sponsor, supermodel Sarah Jordan, is comatose following a car crash and requires transplants from Jordan to survive. Lincoln also meets Tom, who gives him some explanation about the cloning institute, causing Lincoln to realize that he has gained Tom&#x27;s memories. Tom seemingly agrees to help Lincoln and Jordan reveal Merrick&#x27;s crimes to the public, but secretly betrays them to Merrick and Laurent, as he desperately needs Lincoln&#x27;s liver to survive his cirrhosis. Tricking Lincoln into leaving with him, Tom brings him to an ambush that results in a car chase through suburban LA and ends with Lincoln tricking Laurent into believing Tom is the clone and killing him, allowing him to assume Tom&#x27;s identity. Returning to Tom&#x27;s home, Lincoln and Jordan give in to their romantic urges and have sex.

Merrick surmises that a cloning defect was responsible for Lincoln&#x27;s memories and behavior, resulting in him and every future clone generation to question their environment and even tap into their sponsor&#x27;s memories. To prevent this, he decides to eliminate the four latest generations of clones. Lincoln and Jordan, however, plan to liberate the other clones. Posing as Tom, Lincoln returns to the compound to destroy the holographic projectors that conceal the outside world. Jordan allows herself to be caught to assist Lincoln&#x27;s plan. Laurent, who has moral qualms about the clones&#x27; treatment after witnessing their fight for survival and learning that Sarah Jordan may not survive even with the organ transplants, helps Jordan. Lincoln kills Merrick with a harpoon gun, and the clones are freed, seeing the outside world for the first time. As Laurent seemingly gives up his mercenary life, Lincoln and Jordan sail away in one of Tom&#x27;s boats together toward an island, fulfilling their dream of one day going to such a place.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Pre-production===
In the original script written by Caspian Tredwell-Owen, at the time known for his work on the 2003 film &quot;Beyond Borders&quot;, the story was set one hundred years in the future and Scarlett Johansson&#x27;s character Jordan Two Delta was originally named Ester and was meant to be pregnant. After DreamWorks Pictures acquired the rights to the script, it was then re-written by writing duo Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, at the time mostly known for their work on the television shows &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Alias&quot;, mostly to decrease the budget. Kurtzman and Orci also heavily re-wrote the second and third acts of the film and included the scene of Ewan McGregor&#x27;s character Lincoln Six Echo finding a butterfly.

DreamWorks executives Steven Spielberg, Walter F. Parkes and Laurie MacDonald chose Michael Bay to direct the film, having been impressed with his work.

&quot;The Island&quot; was the first of many collaborations between Spielberg, Bay, Kurtzman and Orci. Bay later directed the first five films of the live-action &quot;Transformers film series&quot;, which Spielberg executive produced, as well as producing &quot;Bumblebee&quot; and &quot;&quot;. And Kurtzman and Orci later wrote &quot;The Legend of Zorro&quot;, the first two live-action &quot;Transformers&quot; films and &quot;Cowboys &amp; Aliens&quot;, all executive produced by Spielberg and produced the 2008 film &quot;Eagle Eye&quot; alongside Spielberg.

===Filming===

Principal photography for &quot;The Island&quot; began on October 24, 2004. The ruined buildings where Jordan and Lincoln sleep after leaving the subterranean compound are in Rhyolite, Nevada. The city parts were shot in Detroit, Michigan, with Michigan Central Station one of the notable locations. Other portions of the film were shot in the Coachella Valley, California.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;The Island&quot; grossed $12,409,070 in over 3,100 theaters its opening weekend in fourth place behind &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. The film went on to gross $35,818,913 domestically and $127,130,251 in other markets, for a worldwide total of $162,949,164.

Ultimately, it was considered a box office bomb, which Edward Jay Epstein of &quot;Slate&quot; blamed on poor publicity. Epstein notes that research polls showed little awareness of &quot;The Island&#x27;s&quot; impending release amongst its target audience and that trailers bore little relation to the film&#x27;s plot. He writes, &quot;What really failed here was not the directing, acting, or story (which were all acceptable for a summer movie) but the marketing campaign.&quot;

About the reception, director Michael Bay said, &quot;I liked &quot;The Island&quot; and the thing is the reaction to &quot;The Island&quot;, it worked really well overseas. I knew it would never be a smash, because it&#x27;s not that type of movie, and I continually have so many people that come up to me and say, &#x27;God, that movie is so good.&#x27; But no one knew about it in America. I mean, I asked 500 people before it came out, they didn&#x27;t even know when it was coming out. You saw our poster campaign, we had a muddled campaign, I knew we were in trouble with that movie domestically like four months out, and I kept saying, &#x27;You should go with the Warner&#x27;s campaign,&#x27; which did foreign, so it was a whole kind of microcosm study of studio marketing.&quot;

===Critical reception===
&quot;The Island&quot; drew mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 39% based on reviews from 201 critics, with an average rating of 5.40/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;A clone of &quot;THX 1138&quot;, &quot;Coma&quot;, and &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;, &quot;The Island&quot; is another loud and bombastic Michael Bay movie where explosions and chases matter more than characters, dialogue, or plot.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received &quot;mixed or average reviews,&quot; with a weighted average of 50 out of 100 based on 38 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;″ Roger Ebert said, &quot;[the first half] is a spare, creepy science fiction parable, and then it shifts into a high-tech action picture. Both halves work. Whether they work together is a good question.&quot; Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and praised the performances of the actors, in particular Michael Clarke Duncan: &quot;[He] has only three or four scenes, but they&#x27;re of central importance, and he brings true horror to them.&quot; On the critical side, he said the film &quot;never satisfactorily comes full circle&quot; and missed the opportunity &quot;to do what the best science fiction does, and use the future as a way to critique the present.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s Justin Chang called the film an &quot;exercise in sensory overkill&quot; and said that Bay took on &quot;the weighty moral conundrums of human cloning, resolving them in a storm of bullets, car chases and more explosions than you can shake a syringe at.&quot; He noted McGregor and Buscemi as highlights of the film, along with Nigel Phelps&#x27; production design. Chang felt the story lacked in surprises and blamed &quot;attention-deficit editing by Paul Rubell and Christian Wagner&quot; for action sequences that he thought lacked tension and were &quot;joltingly repetitive&quot;.

&quot;Salon&quot;&#x27;s Stephanie Zacharek also praised the actors but felt that when the film &quot;[gets] really interesting, Bay thinks he needs to throw in a car crash or a round of gunfire to keep our attention.&quot; She felt the film had enough surprises &quot;to make you wish it were better.&quot; A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said &quot;[the] film is smarter than you might expect, and at the same time dumber than it could be.&quot;

Reviewers were critical of the excessive product placement in the film.

===Copyright infringement lawsuit===

The creators of the 1979 film &quot;&quot;, which is also about a colony that breeds clones to harvest organs for the elite, filed a copyright infringement suit in 2005. DreamWorks attempted to have the suit dismissed but a federal judge determined that there was indeed a copyright infringement case to be heard and scheduled the case to go to trial in February 2007. However, DreamWorks then settled the case out of court in late 2006 for an undisclosed seven-figure sum.

Michael Marshall Smith&#x27;s 1996 novel &quot;Spares&quot;, in which the hero liberates intelligent clones from a &quot;spare farm&quot;, was optioned by DreamWorks in the late 1990s, but was never made. It remains unclear if the story inspired &quot;The Island&quot;, so Marshall Smith did not consider it worthwhile to pursue legal action over the similarities.

<doc id="1068523" wikidata="Q3476389" url="?curid=1068523" title="Leopold, Indiana">
<text>Leopold is a small unincorporated community and Census-designated place in Leopold Township, Perry County, in the U.S. state of Indiana.

With a population of less than 100, Leopold is the site of a Roman Catholic church, St. Augustine; a general store, Guillaume&#x27;s Store; a restaurant and Marcy&#x27;s. On the last Sunday in July, Leopold holds its annual St. Augustine&#x27;s picnic, which serves both as a fundraiser for the local parish and as a homecoming for former residents.

==History==
Leopold was founded in 1842 by the Reverend Augustine Bessonies and named for the then-reigning king of Belgium, Leopold I.

A post office was in operation at Leopold from 1846 until August 12, 2017.

Most of the original settlers of Leopold were Belgian emigres. These &quot;lorrain&quot; settlers were Catholics from the French-speaking southern region of Belgium which had formerly been part of Luxembourg. They were motivated to move to America from cities along the Meuse River bordering France, such as Florenville and Chiny, after Belgium was placed under Protestant rule in the 1830s. The land and climate of Perry County was similar to their homeland and made for an easier transition. Because this was an open frontier, immigrants were required to sign an oath renouncing any allegiance to King Leopold.

==Geography==
Leopold is located fifteen miles north of the Ohio River.

==Education==
Leopold Township is in Perry Central Community School Corporation.

Prior to 1962, the community had its own high school. The school colors were black and white, and the mascot was the leopards. That year, it merged into Perry Central High School.

==Demographics==
The United States Census Bureau delineated Leopold as a census designated place in the 2022 American Community Survey.

<doc id="1068526" wikidata="Q721031" url="?curid=1068526" title="Fred Dryer">
<text>John Frederick Dryer (born July 6, 1946) is an American actor, radio host, and former professional football player.

He was a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 years, participating in 176 games starting in 1969 until his retirement in 1981. He recorded 103 career sacks with the New York Giants and Los Angeles Rams. He is the only NFL player to score two safeties in one game.

Following his retirement from football, Dryer had a successful career as a film and television actor, notably starring in the NBC television series &quot;Hunter&quot;, with his height of and physique proving useful for action roles.

==Early life==

Fred Dryer was born and raised in Southern California. His parents were Charles F. Dryer and Genevieve Nell (née Clark) Dryer. He played football at Lawndale High School in Lawndale, California.

==College career==
Dryer attended El Camino Junior College before transferring to San Diego State University (SDSU).

Dryer was inducted to the El Camino Community College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1988 as a charter member and was the Athlete of the Year for his 1966 performance on the football field. Dryer was also a 1966 Junior College All-American.

During Dryer&#x27;s junior and senior seasons at San Diego State, in which he lettered both seasons, the Aztecs had a combined record of 19–1–1. They were the College Division National Champions in both seasons. In 1967, the Aztecs topped both the Associated Press and United Press International polls as #1. In 1968 San Diego State was voted the champions by UPI and North Dakota State University topped the AP poll, and thus the two schools shared the College Division title.

Dryer was voted the outstanding defensive lineman on the team and as such was the recipient of the Byron H. Chase Memorial Trophy.

One of Dryer&#x27;s teammates was Carl Weathers, who played Apollo Creed in the first four films of the &quot;Rocky&quot; series. In 1967, the Aztecs allowed 12.9 points a game on defense, which is still ninth in program history. In 1967 and 1968, the Aztec run defense allowed just 80.1 and 100.1 yards per game, still fourth and fifth, respectively in school history after over half a century.

Dryer was named to the Little All-America team in 1968 since at the time the school was 1-AA. Dryer played in the East-West Shrine Game in San Francisco, the Hula Bowl in Honolulu and the College All-Star Game in Chicago where the college stars played the world champion New York Jets.

In 1988, Dryer was inducted into the San Diego State University Aztec Hall of Fame.

In 1997, Dryer received college football&#x27;s ultimate honor in being voted to the College Football Hall of Fame and is one of only three Aztecs in the collegiate Hall of Fame. When voted into the San Diego Sports Hall of Fame in 1998, he joined athletes such as Ted Williams, Dan Fouts, Dave Winfield, and Tony Gwynn in receiving the preeminent recognition for a San Diego athlete.

==NFL career==
Dryer was selected in the first round of the 1969 NFL/AFL draft by the New York Giants and won a starting job as a rookie. He was the starting right defensive end from 1969 through 1971. Although the NFL did not officially recognize quarterback sacks until 1982, teams did record their own sack data for the time. As such, he led the team in sacks each of those three seasons with 8½ in 1969, 12 in 1970 and 8½ in 1971. He was among the defensive leaders in other categories as well. In 1969, he tallied 58 tackles (39 solo), six passes deflected and forced two fumbles, recovering both.

The next season, Dryer was an alternate to the Pro Bowl but could not play due to a bruised hip. He was Second-team All-NFC after recording 59 tackles (43 solo) four pass deflections, three forced fumbles, while recovering two to go along with his 12 sacks. In 1971, he again led the team with 8½ sacks, and totaled 52 tackles (33 solo). He deflected two passes, forced two more fumbles and recovered two for the third consecutive season.

After several run-ins with Giants management in 1971, Dryer was traded to the New England Patriots in February 1972 for three draft choices (a first and a sixth in 1972; a second in 1973). The Giants used the first round pick to select defensive back Eldridge Small. Because Dryer had not signed a contract for the 1971 season, he was eligible to become a free agent in May 1972. He refused to report to the Patriots unless they signed him to a long-term contract making him the highest paid defensive lineman in pro football. The Patriots refused to meet his demands and instead dealt him to the Los Angeles Rams for a 1973 first round draft pick (which they ultimately used to select fullback Sam Cunningham) and backup defensive end Rick Cash, four days before Dryer would have become a free agent. This trade gave Dryer what he wanted all along—a move to a West Coast team—and he agreed to a multi-year contract with the Rams. In his first year with the Rams, he backed up left defensive end Jack Youngblood making only four starts but playing in every game despite a broken hand and broken nose. His primary role in 1972 was to come in on likely passing downs and rush the passer. He had 40 tackles (17 solo) and 4½ sacks.

In 1973, Dryer started all 14 games on the right side and became the only NFL player ever to have two safeties in the same game by tackling opposing passers in the end zone twice in the fourth quarter. He ended the season with ten sacks, three forced fumbles with three recovered fumbles (all three were second on the top-ranked Rams defense). After the season, he was a Second-team All-NFC pick by &quot;Pro Football Weekly&quot;. He finished the season with 39 tackles (21 solo), three forced fumbles and three fumbles recovered.

In 1974, he had 15 sacks, which co-led (with Youngblood) the league, and he was also voted the Rams Outstanding Defensive Lineman. He was named NEA First-team and AP Second-team All-Pro and All-NFC. Statistically, he had another solid year versus the run, totaling 49 tackles (34 solo) and two forced fumbles.

Dryer scored his first NFL touchdown in 1975 on a 20-yard interception return against Philadelphia. After scoring his touchdown against the Eagles, Dryer promised that if he ever scored another, he would set his hair on fire in the end zone. Against the Eagles that day, he chose to celebrate by &quot;rolling six&quot;, a touchdown celebration where the player scoring rolls the ball like an imaginary pair of dice with some of his teammates looking on. He ended 1975 with 12 sacks, behind only Jack Youngblood and was voted All-NFC. Additionally, Dryer played in the 1975 Pro Bowl. Statistically, Dryer was excellent against the run with 61 tackles (39 solo) and two passes deflection, two fumbles recovered to go along with the 20-yard TD interception.

After 1975, rule changes affecting the offensive line hindered Dryer because of his small frame. He had a 55-tackle, five-sack season (33 solo) in 1976. He did deflect two passes and forced three fumbles to lead his team. In 1977, Dryer adopted a new diet and was winning praises from NFL sportswriters for the start he had. He recorded 35 tackles (28 solo) and six sacks. He also knocked down four passes, recovered three fumbles and caused one fumble. The next season, 1978 was much of the same. Dryer was the starting right defensive end on the NFL&#x27;s #1 defense. Personally, he had 51 tackles (33 solo) and forced two fumbles, recovered three, blocked a kick and blocked one pass as the Rams went 12-4 and won their sixth straight division title.

In 1979, Dryer would be named an honorable mention All-NFC after recording 49 tackles (31 solo), ten sacks, and three forced fumbles (with one recovery). Against the New York Giants on October 28 of that year, Dryer recorded a career-high five sacks. At last, the Rams would finally break through and reach the Super Bowl. Dryer played in Super Bowl XIV when the Rams met the Pittsburgh Steelers on January 20, 1980. The Rams led 19–17 against the defending champions, but the Steelers scored fourteen unanswered points to win the game in the fourth quarter 31–19. The following season, Dryer split the time at his right defensive end position with third-year player Reggie Doss. They combined for 67 tackles (Dryer 31, 20 solo) and 12 sacks (Dryer 5½, Doss 6½).

Dryer ended his career with 104 career sacks, although as mentioned the statistic was not recognized until after he retired. Dryer played on a tough Los Angeles Ram defense that allowed fewer points, fewer total yards, fewer rushing yards, and sacked more quarterbacks than any other defense during the 1970s.

In January 1981, Dryer made the cover of &quot;Interview&quot; magazine, published by Andy Warhol from the late 1960s through the early 1990s and was considered the very essence of &quot;magazine chic&quot;. In 2003 the NFL Alumni presented Dryer with its Career Achievement Award which is presented to former NFL players &quot;For Getting to the Top of His Field&quot;.

===Record game===

Dryer&#x27;s record-setting game on October 21, 1973, at Los Angeles was a 24–7 win over Green Bay. Down 20–7 in the fourth quarter, the Packers found themselves deep in their own territory when Dryer came storming in from the right side of the defense and chased down Green Bay quarterback Scott Hunter, dropping him in the end zone for a safety.

On the Packers&#x27; following possession near their own goal line, Dryer attacked again. He looped through the middle of the Packers&#x27; offensive line and dragged backup quarterback Jim Del Gaizo down for his second safety of the game, setting an NFL record. For his efforts, Dryer was named the Associated Press NFL Defensive Player of the Week.

==Acting career==
Prior to the start of his show business career, Dryer helped cover Super Bowl IX for &quot;SPORT&quot; magazine. In response to the perceived grandiose and self-important nature of the NFL&#x27;s championship match, then-editor Dick Schaap hired Dryer and Rams teammate Lance Rentzel for this journalistic assignment. Donning costumes inspired by &quot;The Front Page&quot;, &quot;Scoops Brannigan&quot; (Dryer) and &quot;Cubby O&#x27;Switzer&quot; (Rentzel) peppered players and coaches from both the Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings with questions that ranged from clichéd to downright absurd. He briefly served as a color analyst on CBS&#x27;s NFL coverage in 1981 and 1982.

In the early 1980s, when producers/creators Glen and Les Charles and James Burrows were developing the soon-to-be hit sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;, Dryer and two other actors were considered for the role of lead character Sam Malone. Ted Danson ultimately won the role, but Dryer appeared in episodes as a sportscaster and Sam&#x27;s former Red Sox teammate Dave Richards in the episodes &quot;Sam at Eleven&quot;, &quot;Old Flames&quot;, &quot;Love Thy Neighbor&quot;, and &quot;&#x27;I&#x27; On Sports&quot;. He appeared on &quot;CHiPs&quot; as Lt. John LeGarre in the Season 5 episode &quot;Force Seven&quot;, about a secret LAPD unit implemented for special situations.

Dryer&#x27;s best-known acting role came in the 1980s television crime drama &quot;Hunter&quot;, in which he co-starred with Stepfanie Kramer, followed by Darlanne Fluegel, then Lauren Lane. He starred in the action-thriller movie &quot;Death Before Dishonor&quot; as well as playing Mike Land in the TV series &quot;Land&#x27;s End&quot; (21 episodes, 1995–1996). In 1998, he portrayed Police Chief Masters in &quot;&quot;. He portrayed Sgt. Rock during his appearance on &quot;Justice League&quot;.

In January 2009, Dryer was seen in a cable TV commercial for SMS research company, which obliquely makes reference to his NFL record of two safeties in a game from 1973. Dryer is also now a spokesman for the law service Injury Solutions.

He starred in the drag racing film &quot;Snake &amp; Mongoose&quot;, which depicts the rivalry between drivers Don &quot;The Snake&quot; Prudhomme and Tom &quot;The Mongoose&quot; McEwen and their groundbreaking accomplishments in the world of drag racing. Dryer played &quot;Ed Donovan&quot;, McEwen&#x27;s engine builder, who coined the nickname &quot;Mongoose&quot;.

Dryer appeared in the NBC series &quot;Crisis&quot; in 2014. In 2015, Dryer joined the ranks of the Marvel Cinematic Universe when he played the evil HYDRA leader, Octavian Bloom, in an episode of &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; On October 23, 2018, he played a Vietnam veteran on the CBS show &quot;NCIS&quot;.

==Personal life==
Dryer has had a long interest in nutrition. In the late 1970s Dryer was consuming 70 raw egg yolks a week. He has since excluded red meat from his diet and eats chicken and vegetables.

He married actress and &quot;Playboy&quot; centerfold Tracy Vaccaro in May 1983; the couple divorced in 1988. Together, they have at least one daughter. Dryer still resides in Los Angeles and has his own production company (Fred Dryer Productions).

<doc id="1068538" wikidata="Q7869841" url="?curid=1068538" title="USS Greenling (SS-213)">
<text>USS &quot;Greenling&quot; (SS-213), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the greenling.

==Construction, commissioning, and shakedown==
&quot;Greenling&quot; was laid down by Electric Boat Company, Groton, Connecticut, on 12 November 1940, launched on 20 September 1941, sponsored by Mrs. R. S. Holmes, and commissioned at Naval Submarine Base New London in New London, Connecticut, on 21 January 1942. While she was conducting shakedown training from New London, she suffered damage on 28 February 1942 when a PBY-5A Catalina amphibian of U.S. Navy Patrol Squadron 73 (VP-73) mistook her for a German U-boat and bombed her.

== First war patrol, April – June 1942 == 
After completing shakedown training, &quot;Greenling&quot; departed New London on 7 March 1942 for the Pacific. She arrived Pearl Harbor 3 April and sailed 20 April for her first war patrol, in the Marshall Islands and Caroline Islands. The submarine attacked the cargo ship &quot;Seia Maru&quot; four times 30 April – 1 May off Eniwetok, but due to faulty torpedoes was not able to sink her. The tenacious submarine even closed for a night gunfire attack in an attempt to cripple her adversary. Finally forced by Japanese aircraft to break off the attack, &quot;Greenling&quot; turned her attention to the huge Japanese base at Truk. As the Japanese converged on the Solomon Islands, Truk became a busy shipping point and a fertile ground for submarine operations. The submarine recorded her first kill 4 May when she hit cargo ship &quot;Kinjosan Maru&quot; amidships, breaking her in two. As the Japanese were turned back in the important Battle of the Coral Sea (history&#x27;s first carrier air battle), &quot;Greenling&quot; attempted to intercept the retiring enemy units, but her speed was no match for the fast Japanese heavy units. The submarine departed the Truk area 4 June, the day of Japan&#x27;s first great naval defeat at the Battle of Midway, and arrived at Pearl Harbor 16 June.

== Second war patrol, July – September 1942 == 
&quot;Greenling&quot; departed on her second war patrol 10 July 1942. One of the first submarines to operate in the Truk area, she now joined in the undersea blockade of that important base, in an attempt to cut its supply lines to Japan. After damaging ships on 26 and 29 July, &quot;Greenling&quot; sank the transport &quot;Brasil Maru&quot; off Truk on 5 August, and just after midnight the same night torpedoed and sank the cargo ship &quot;Palau Maru&quot;. Next morning the submarine took periscope photographs of Truk, and steamed to the New Ireland area, attempting to intercept Japanese fleet units retiring from the Solomons. The submarine encountered surface opposition in the area, but evaded a destroyer attack 20 August and set course back to Midway. En route on 26 August she used her deck gun to destroy a large Japanese sampan of from 50 to 100 tons at 5°13&#x27;N, 160°-17&#x27;E; she arrived Midway 1 September 1942.

== Third war patrol, September – November 1942 == 
&quot;Greenling&quot;&#x27;s third war patrol took her off the Japanese home islands. Departing Midway 23 September, the submarine sank the cargo ship &quot;Kinkai Maru&quot; 3 October, and &quot;Setsuyo Maru&quot; the next day. She fired three torpedoes at cargo ship &quot;Takusei Maru&quot; 14 October, scored three hits, and watched her sink in the space of 6 minutes. This attack brought a host of escort vessels to search for &quot;Greenling&quot;, but she evaded them and attacked a large freighter 18 October. One torpedo set the target aflame, but the second &quot;fish&quot; ran erratically, circled, and almost hit &quot;Greenling&quot;. The next ran true, however, and cargo ship &quot;Hakonesan Maru&quot; was sent to the bottom. After destroying a sampan in the Tokyo–Aleutian Islands shipping lanes 21 October, &quot;Greenling&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor 1 November. The attrition on Japanese shipping by submarines was already being felt and would be a major factor in their eventual defeat.

== Fourth war patrol, December 1942 – January 1943 == 
Steaming into the Solomons–Truk area for her fourth war patrol, &quot;Greenling&quot; departed Pearl Harbor 9 December 1942. Immediately upon her arrival off Bougainville 21 December she attacked a tanker and two escorts, sinking &quot;Patrol Boat 35&quot; before being driven down by depth charge attacks. Moving to the familiar Truk traffic lanes, she sank freighter &quot;Nissho Maru&quot; 30 December. She attacked a destroyer-escorted large tanker early 10 January 1943, but after scoring one hit was fired upon by the tanker&#x27;s large deck gun and was forced to break off the action. Off New Britain on 16 January she torpedoed and sank cargo ship &quot;Kimposan Maru&quot;. On 18 January &quot;Greenling&quot; claimed to have damaged ammunition transport/survey vessel &quot;Soya&quot; in Queen Carola Channel, although the Japanese ship was not damaged and recovered a torpedo for later examination. Greenling then reconnoitered the Admiralty Islands before steaming to Brisbane, Australia.

== Fifth and sixth war patrols, January – July 1943 == 
The submarine arrived Brisbane 31 January 1943 and remained there until departing on her fifth war patrol 21 February. &quot;Greenling&quot; steamed to the Solomons–Bismarck area, and landed a party of intelligence agents on the coast of New Britain 2 March. In a patrol characterized by bad weather, she scored no hits on enemy shipping and returned to Brisbane 26 April 1943.
&quot;Greenling&quot; cleared Brisbane 17 May to conduct her sixth war patrol, in the Solomons–New Guinea area, long the scene of bitter sea and land fighting. During this patrol she damaged oiler &quot;Akebono Maru&quot; on 9 June, and is also alleged to damaged ships on 10 June, and 27 June, but was unable to record a sinking because of heavy escort activity. She returned to Brisbane 8 July 1943.

== Seventh war patrol, July – September 1943 == 
The submarine sailed 29 July on her seventh war patrol, which consisted largely of special missions. She landed a party of Marine Raiders in the Treasury Islands 22 – 23 August to select a site for a radar station and prepare for the landings there, scheduled for October. &quot;Greenling&quot; reconnoitered Tarawa 10 September and sailed to San Francisco via Pearl Harbor for overhaul.

== Eighth and ninth war patrols, December 1943 – May 1944 == 
Returning to Pearl Harbor 5 December, &quot;Greenling&quot; sailed for her eighth war patrol 20 December 1943, in the Caroline Islands. She ended the old year with a late night attack, sinking freighter &quot;Shōhō Maru&quot;, reconnoitred Wake Island, and returned to Midway 28 January 1944. Her ninth war patrol, 20 March – 12 May 1944, was a special mission entailing photographic reconnaissance of Guam, Tinian, and Saipan in the Marianas Islands, work which did much to aid the coming amphibious campaign for the Marianas.

== Tenth and eleventh war patrols, July – November 1944 == 
&quot;Greenling&quot; sailed from Pearl Harbor on her 10th patrol 9 July 1944. Operating off Formosa, she formed a coordinated attack unit (&quot;wolfpack&quot;) with and . Closely watched by enemy aircraft, &quot;Greenling&quot; recorded no torpedo sinkings, though she sank a trawler with gunfire 8 August north-east of Luzon, Philippines in position 19°50&#x27;N, 119°58&#x27;E. She returned to Midway 12 September 1944.
The veteran submarine departed 5 October 1944 for her 11th war patrol, in the ocean approaches to Tokyo. Sighting a 5-ship convoy 7 November, she fired 4 torpedoes and sank both oiler &quot;Koto Maru&quot; and transport &quot;Kiri Maru 8&quot;. Continuing to prowl off Japan, &quot;Greenling&quot; sank her last ship 10 November 1944 when she torpedoed old destroyer &quot;Patrol Boat 46&quot;. She returned to Pearl Harbor 23 November 1944.

== Twelfth war patrol, December 1944 – January 1945 == 
&quot;Greenling&quot;&#x27;s last war patrol, her 12th, was carried out in the Ryukyu Islands. Departing Pearl Harbor 26 December she found no targets until 24 January 1945, when she intercepted a nine-ship convoy. While making her approach, &quot;Greenling&quot; was attacked by escorts, and after a four-hour depth charge attack managed to make her escape. The submarine suffered minor damage and steamed to Saipan 27 January 1945 for repairs. There it was decided to send her to the United States, and &quot;Greenling&quot; steamed via Pearl Harbor, San Francisco, and the Panama Canal to Kittery, Maine. After overhaul at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, the submarine decommissioned 16 October 1946 at New London, Connecticut.

== Post-war service ==
&quot;Greenling&quot; was placed in service for the 1st Naval District in December 1946. Stationed at Portsmouth, she assisted in the training of reservists there and at Boston. The submarine continued this vital service until 18 March 1960, when she was placed out of service at Boston. She was sold 16 June 1960 to Minichiello Brothers, Chelsea, Massachusetts, and scrapped.

== Awards ==
* Presidential Unit Citation for her outstanding performance in her first three war patrols
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with 10 battle stars for World War II service

All of &quot;Greenling&quot;′s war patrols except the fifth, tenth, and twelfth were designated &quot;successful.&quot;

<text>A tagine or tajine, also tajin or tagin () is a Maghrebi dish, and also the earthenware pot in which it is cooked. It is also called or .

== Etymology ==
The Arabic () is derived from Ancient Greek () &#x27;frying-pan, saucepan&#x27;. According to some sources, the origin of the word &#x27;tagine&#x27; is Persian, pronounced &quot;&quot;.

== Origin ==
In the 1990s, the late Dr. Vivien Swan identified pottery from various sites on Scotland&#x27;s Antonine Wall, built by the Numidian governor of Roman Britain, Quintus Lollius Urbicus, of a North African style, one being a casserole dish that may have been a precursor to the modern tagine. Fragments of tagines have also been identified among Numidian ceramics in modern-day Tunisia.

According to some sources, the history of tagine dates back to the time of Harun al-Rashid, the fifth Abbasid Caliph. The concept of cooking in a tajine appears in the famous &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, an Arabic-language story collection from the 9th century.

Today, the cooking pot and its traditional broth are primarily prepared in the Middle East and North Africa, although both are popular in many other countries. There are different ways to prepare the tagine. In the original &quot;qidra&quot; style, (clarified butter) is used to lubricate the surface and a puree of chopped onion is added for flavour and aroma. For -style cooking, the ingredients are placed in olive oil to enrich the flavours.

According to the historian of Jewish food Gil Marks, the unique two-piece cooking vessel made from red clay called a tagine originates from the Anti-Atlas Mountains in Morocco.

Étienne Villot recounts in his book &quot;Customs and Institutions of the Indigenous People of Algeria&quot; (1888):All indigenous women know how to make pottery, from humble cups to the immense kolla of the Kabyle Algerians. Clay pottery is very common in Algeria. Various colors, usually red, yellow, and black, are applied to the pottery pieces shaped by the women. These colors are fixed onto the clay using a varnish composed of pine resin and a little bit of olive oil. Kabyle women have great skill in these types of work.There are many descriptions of how to prepare a tagine from Arab scholars. A famous description is the one from ibn al-Adim (1192–1262):
Tagines have been in use for an extended period, persisting to the present day. In 1859, French explorer, geographer, archaeologist, librarian, and Maghreb expert Oscar Mac Carthy recounted encountering cooking tagines and pottery in the streets of Algeria. He described them as large hollow pots of various shapes. Additionally, a Tunisian review from 1896 also references the presence of pottery and tagines in Tunisia.

==Pottery==

The traditional tagine pottery, sometimes painted or glazed, consists of two parts: a circular base unit that is flat with low sides and a large cone- or dome-shaped cover that sits on the base during cooking. The cover is designed to return all condensation to the bottom. That process can be improved by adding cold water into the specially designed well at the top of the lid.

Tagine is traditionally cooked over hot charcoal leaving an adequate space between the coals and the tagine pot to avoid having the temperature rise too quickly. Large bricks of charcoal are used, specifically for their ability to stay hot for hours. Other methods are to use a tagine in a slow oven or on a gas or electric stove top, on the lowest heat necessary to keep the stew simmering gently. A diffuser, a circular utensil placed between the tagine and the flame, is used to evenly distribute the stove&#x27;s heat. European manufacturers have created tagines with heavy cast-iron bottoms that can be heated on a cooking stove to a high temperature, which permits the browning of meat and vegetables before cooking.

Tagine cooking may be replicated by using a slow cooker or similar item, but the result will be slightly different. Many ceramic tagines are decorative items as well as functional cooking vessels. Some tagines, however, are intended only to be used as decorative serving dishes.

== Algerian and Moroccan tagine ==

Algerian and Moroccan tagine dishes are slow-cooked stews, typically made with sliced meat, poultry or fish together with vegetables or fruit. Spices, nuts, and dried fruits are also used. Common spices include ginger, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, and saffron. Paprika and chili are used in vegetable tagines. The sweet and sour combination is common in tagine dishes like lamb with prunes and spices. Tagines are generally served with bread. Because the domed or cone-shaped lid of the tagine pot traps steam and returns the condensed liquid to the pot, a minimal amount of water is needed to cook meats and vegetables. This method of cooking is important in areas where water supplies are limited or where public water is not yet available.

==Tunisian and Libyan tagine==

What Tunisians refer to as a &quot;tagine&quot; is very different from other forms of the dish. Tunisian tajine is more like a French quiche while the Libyan is more similar to an Italian frittata or an eggah. First, a simple ragout is prepared, of meat cut into very small pieces, cooked with onions and spices, such as a blend of dried rose flower buds and ground cinnamon known as &quot;baharat&quot; or a robust combination of ground coriander and caraway seeds; this is called tabil. Then something starchy is added to thicken the juices. Common thickeners include cannellini beans, chickpeas, breadcrumbs or cubed potatoes. When the meat is tender, it is combined with the ingredients which have been chosen to be the dominant flavouring. Examples include fresh parsley, dried mint, saffron, sun-dried tomatoes, cooked vegetables and stewed calves&#x27; brains. Next, the stew is enriched with cheese and eggs. Finally, this egg and stew are baked in a deep pie dish, either on the stove or in the oven until top and bottom are crisply cooked and the eggs are just set. When the tagine is ready, it is turned out onto a plate and sliced into squares, accompanied by wedges of lemon. Tunisian tagines can also be made with seafood or as a completely vegetarian dish.

In rural parts of Tunisia, home cooks place a shallow earthenware dish over olive-wood coals, fill it, cover it with a flat earthenware pan, and then pile hot coals on top. The resulting tajine is crusty on top and bottom, moist within and is infused with a subtle smoky fragrance.

==Maghrebi Jewish tagine==
Maghrebi Jews also eat and prepare tagine, owing to their historic presence in North Africa. Tagine is a very important dish in Sephardi cuisine, and is commonly eaten and prepared by Moroccan Jews, Algerian Jews, Tunisian Jews, Libyan Jews, Djerban Jews, and also by French Jews, Jewish Americans, and Israelis, due to the large population of Sephardim in those countries.

Tagine is a mainstay of Sephardic cuisine commonly prepared for Shabbat dinners in the Sephardi community, and served with couscous. Sephardim from different regions prepare different styles of tagine; for instance, Moroccan Jews often prepare tagine with dried fruits, while Tunisian Jews often prepare a vegetable tagine containing potatoes, carrots, and zucchini cut into large dice. Tagine is also commonly prepared for Jewish holidays such as Rosh Hashanah and the Yom Kippur break-fast.

<text>Charles Grandison Rose III (August 10, 1939 – September 3, 2012) was an American attorney and politician and who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives for North Carolina&#x27;s 7th congressional district from 1973 to 1997.

==Early life and education==
Rose was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina. He earned a Bachelor of Laws from Davidson College and a Juris Doctor from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. As an undergraduate, he was a photographer for &quot;The News and Observer&quot;.

== Career ==
For several years, Rose practiced as a lawyer, and in 1967, he became a prosecutor for Fayetteville district courts. In 1970, Rose unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Congressman Alton Lennon in the Democratic primary, claiming over 40% of the vote. In 1972, when Lennon stepped down, Rose beat back a primary bid by a Lennon-endorsed candidate, State Senator Hector McGeachy, claiming the nomination and ultimate victory.

Rose represented a district stretching from Fayetteville to Wilmington on the coast. Rose was a liberal, populist Democrat, which seemingly made him an odd fit for his conservative coastal district. However, he remained popular because he was viewed as a champion of farmers, especially tobacco farmers.
He was a member of the Intelligence and Agriculture Committees. He also served as chairman of the United States House Committee on House Administration from 1991 to 1994, a post which helped earn him the nickname &quot;mayor of the Capitol&quot;.

From his early photography days he had had an interest in cutting-edge technology and, according to friend and former chief of staff John Merritt (public servant), &quot;pushed the House of Representatives to televise its activities on C-SPAN, helped bring computers and fiber optics to Congress and was &#x27;behind just about every tech advancement Congress made while he was there&#x27;&quot;. He also had an electric car in the 1970s.

In 1991, Rose chaired the House Committee investigation of the George H. W. Bush administration&#x27;s role in selling military supplies to Iraq.

After Democrats lost control of Congress in the 1994 Republican Revolution, Rose challenged incumbent House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt for the post of minority leader, but lost 150–50. He retired from the House the next year and became a lobbyist, working alongside his third wife, Stacye, the daughter of fellow North Carolina Congressman Bill Hefner. Rose&#x27;s former intern Mike McIntyre succeeded Rose in 1997, and held the seat until the 2014 election.

== Personal life ==
Rose married Sara Louise Richardson on June 30, 1962; they had three children. Charles Grandison Rose, IV born December 14, 1965. Louise Rose (Pacini), born October 19, 1973. Irene Cowan Rose, born November 9, 1975. Irene died in infancy of a congenital heart defect on January 28, 1976.
Sara and Charlie divorced in September 1982. Rose then married Joan Ray Teague in 1982 on Bald Head Island, North Carolina. Together they adopted a baby girl, Kelly Josephine (born October 1, 1987). The couple divorced in 1995. Rose then married Stacye Hugh Hefner in May 1995 near Washington, D.C. The couple have one daughter, Parker Delaney (born October 19, 1999).

=== Death ===
In 2009, Rose moved to Albertville, Alabama, to be near Stacye&#x27;s mother. Rose largely gave up his lobbying work with the move. Rose died of complications related to Parkinson&#x27;s disease at a hospital in northern Alabama near their home.

<text>Illa Coelleira, or Colleira (Spanish: Isla Conejera, literal translation: Rabbits&#x27; Island), is a small island located in the mouth of the Barqueiro river, off the town of Viveiro, in the Rias Altas coastal region of Galicia, Spain. The island is part of O Vicedo municipality. It is known best as the site of a former monastery, and today houses a lighthouse to aid navigation.

==Name==
The island&#x27;s Galician name, Illa Coelleira, means &quot;island of the rabbits&quot;, a reference to the numerous rabbits that today inhabit the otherwise bare island. Documents show its name in the 11th century as Quonicularia.

==History==
Historians have speculated that the monastery was founded during the reign of Leovigildo (573-586 AD), a period during which Christians were persecuted. This theory holds that the monastery was populated with monks fleeing the monastery of San Claudius of León, who then spread out to work throughout Galicia.

A firm record exists of a donation by Vimara Menéndez to the monastery of San Miguel de Quonicularia in 1095. The donation gave over to the monastery one third of the church of San Julian de Loiva under an intermediary bishop, Gonzalo.

Little record of the island exists from the 11th to 15th centuries. Some accounts describe the island being settled by Templars, who were then massacred in 1307. Reports resume in the 15th century, with the 1485 union of the island monastery with the mainland monastery of San Martiño de Mondoñedo under prior Ares Pérez de Viladonga. There followed numerous difficulties for the Coelleira monastery, until in 1534 a papal bull annexed the monastery to Mondoñedo Cathedral.

<text>Shotgunning is a means of consuming a beverage, especially beer, very quickly by punching a hole in the side of the can, near the bottom, placing the mouth over the hole, and pulling the tab to open the top. The beverage quickly drains, and is quickly consumed.

Shotgunning is normally done as a competition. The participants wait until all the others are ready until the countdown begins. Once the countdown is finished, the participants get under way and the first one to finish consuming the beverage is the winner.

==Technique==

To shotgun a beverage, a small hole is punched in the side of the can, close to the bottom. In order to prevent the liquid from spilling out while the cut is made, the can is held horizontally and the hole is made in the resulting air pocket. The hole can be made with any sharp object—typically a key, bottle opener, pen, knife, or tooth. The drinker then places their mouth over the hole while rotating the can straight up. When the can’s tab is pulled, the liquid will quickly drain through the hole into the drinker’s mouth. This occurs because the hole allows air to enter the can, balancing the internal pressure and enabling the liquid to flow rapidly without resistance from carbonation or a vacuum.

<doc id="1068559" wikidata="Q6451506" url="?curid=1068559" title="R-36 (missile)">
<text>The R-36 () is a family of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and space launch vehicles (Tsyklon) designed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The original R-36 was deployed under the GRAU index 8K67 and was given the NATO reporting name SS-9 Scarp. It was able to carry three warheads and was the first Soviet MIRV (multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle) missile. The later version, the R-36M, also known as RS20, was produced under the GRAU designations 15A14 and 15A18 and was given the NATO reporting name SS-18 Satan. This missile was viewed by certain United States analysts as giving the Soviet Union first strike advantage over the U.S., particularly because of its rapid silo-reload ability, very heavy throw weight and extremely large number of re-entry vehicles. Some versions of the R-36M were deployed with 10 warheads and up to 40 penetration aids and the missile&#x27;s high throw-weight made it theoretically capable of carrying more warheads or penetration aids. Contemporary U.S. missiles, such as the Minuteman III, carried up to three warheads at most.

The R-36 became the base for the Tsyklon launch vehicles family. As of early 2021, Cyclone-4M, the last Tsyklon variant in development, is planned for launch in 2023 from Canso, Nova Scotia.

Some R-36 missiles have been converted into Dnepr medium-lift launch vehicles, capable of putting up to 4,500 kg into orbit.

== History ==
Development of the R-36 was begun by OKB-586 (Yuzhnoye) in Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine (at the time part of the Soviet Union) in 1962, and built upon the work of the R-16 program. The Chief Designer was Mikhail Yangel. Initial development was of light, heavy, and orbital versions, with flight testing from 1962 through 1966, at which time initial operational capability was achieved. News of the development of the orbital version caused alarm in the West with the possibility that the Soviets would be able to launch a large number of nuclear weapons into orbit where there was no capability to intercept them. Weapons could potentially be left orbiting for an indefinite period. The prospect of orbital nuclear weapons led both sides to agree to a treaty banning the basing of weapons of mass destruction in space.

In 1970, development of a fourth version, capable of delivering multiple warheads, was begun, which was test flown the next year.

Further improvement of the R-36 led to the design of the R-36M, which provided a theoretical first-strike capability—the ability to destroy the United States&#x27; LGM-30 Minuteman ICBM silos and launch control centers before they could retaliate. However, neither the Soviet Union nor the Russian Federation have ever publicly delineated the missile&#x27;s particular role in their arsenal. The initial design of the R-36M called for a single massive 12 Mt warhead to be delivered over a range of 10,600 km. The missile was first tested in 1973 but this test ended in failure. After several delays the R-36M was deployed in December 1975. This design was delivered with a single 18–20 Mt warhead and a range of just over 11,000 km. This new version was given a new codename by NATO: SS-18 Satan.

The R-36M has gone through six separate variants, with the first being phased out by 1984. The final variant designated R-36M-2 &quot;Voevoda&quot; (NATO codename SS-18 mod 6) was deployed in August 1988. This missile could deliver the same 18–20 Mt warhead 16,000 km. Prior variants mainly introduced MIRV (Multiple independent reentry vehicles) warheads. These missiles surpassed their western counterpart, the US LGM-118 Peacekeeper in terms of megatons delivered, range, and survivability, but were inferior in terms of accuracy (CEP).

The control system for this rocket was designed at NPO &quot;Electropribor&quot; (Kharkiv, Ukraine).

=== Deployment ===
At full deployment, before the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, 308 R-36M launch silos were operational. After the breakup of the USSR, 204 of these were located on the territory of the Russian Federation and 104 on the territory of newly independent Kazakhstan. In the next few years Russia reduced the number of R-36M launch silos to 154 to conform with the START I treaty. Part of the missiles in Kazakhstan (54 of them) were under the 57th Rocket Division at Zhangiz-Tobe (Solnechnyy), Semipalatinsk Oblast. The other R-36 establishment in Kazakhstan was the 38th Rocket Division at Derzhavinsk, Turgay Oblast. The dismantling of 104 launchers located in Kazakhstan was completed in September 1996. 

The START II treaty was to eliminate all R-36M missiles but it did not enter into force and the missiles remained on duty. Russia has steadily decreased the number of operational R-36Ms and as of March 2013, only 55 (all of the 10 MIRV R-36M2 version) remain.

US Air Force National Air and Space Intelligence Center estimates that as of June 2017 about 50 R-36M2 launchers were operationally deployed.

About 40 missiles will have their service lives extended so that they remain in service until about 2020. With the retirement of the 20 megaton R-36M2 warheads, the highest yield weapon in service with any nation is the estimated 5 Mt Chinese Dong Feng 5 (DF-5) ICBM (CSS-4) warhead and the Russian UR-100N 5 Mt rocket.

=== Elimination / Retirement ===
In the last decade Russian armed forces have been steadily reducing the number of R-36M missiles in service, withdrawing those that age past their designed operational lifetime. As of January 2020, the Strategic Missile Troops had 46 R-36M2s (or RS-20Vs) in active service.

In March 2006 Russia made an agreement with Ukraine that will regulate cooperation between the two countries on maintaining the R-36M2 missiles. It was reported that the cooperation with Ukraine will allow Russia to extend the service life of the R-36M2 missiles by at least ten to 28 years.

According to Interfax report, two R-36M2 missiles are planned to be dismantled by November 30, 2020. The process is to be carried out in accordance with the New START procedures.

 Russia unveiled the intended replacement for the R-36M series, a new heavy ICBM the RS-28 Sarmat, which became operational in September 2023.

== Design ==
=== Multiple warheads ===
Missiles of the R-36M family have never been deployed with more than ten warheads, but given their large throw-weight (8.8 tonnes as specified in START), they have the capacity to carry considerably more detonation power. Among the projects that the Soviet Union considered in the mid-1970s was that of a 15A17 missile—a follow-on to the R-36MUTTKh (15A18). The missile would have had an even greater throw-weight—9.5 tonnes—and would be able to carry a very large number of warheads. Five different versions of the missile were considered. Three of these versions would carry regular warheads — yield, yield, or yield. Two modifications were supposed to carry guided warheads (&quot;upravlyaemaya golovnaya chast&quot;) — or . However, none of these upgraded models were ever developed. The SALT II Treaty, signed in 1979, prohibited increasing the number of warheads ICBMs could carry. Equally, from a strategic point of view, concentrating so many warheads on silo-based missiles was not seen as desirable, since it would have made a large proportion of the USSR&#x27;s warheads vulnerable to a counterforce strike.

The operational deployment of the R-36M consisted of the R-36MUTTKh, which carried ten 500 kt warheads, and its follow-on, the R-36M2 (15A18M), which carried ten 800 kt warheads (single-warhead versions with either 8.3 Mt or 20 Mt warhead also existed at some point). To partially circumvent the treaty, the missile was equipped with 40 decoys to utilize the capacity left unused due to the 10-warhead limitation. These decoys would appear as warheads to any defensive system, making each missile as hard to intercept as 50 single warheads, rendering potential anti-ballistic defense ineffective.

=== Silo hardness ===
A US military estimate circa 1994 said &quot;SS-18 silos have since been assessed to be much harder than &quot;.

The R-36 is a two-stage rocket powered by a liquid bipropellant, with UDMH as fuel and nitrogen tetroxide as an oxidizer. It carries one of two types of re-entry vehicles (RVs) developed especially for this missile:
* Single nuclear warhead of 20 megatons TNT (NATO codename SS-9 Mod 1).
* Single nuclear warhead of 8.3 megatons TNT (NATO codename SS-9 Mod 2).

The first launch of an R-36 took place on September 28, 1963, and ended ignominiously when the missile lost thrust one second after liftoff and fell back onto the pad, causing a fire.
This debacle led to program director V.P. Petrov being fired and replaced by V.N. Soloviev. LC-67/1 was repaired and the next test took place successfully on December 3. Subsequent testing went better, however, LC-80/1 had to be rebuilt following another launch accident on January 13, 1965. Two months later, an R-36 caught fire during propellant loading on LC-67/1 and exploded, putting the pad out of commission for nine months. During test launch #17 (October 10, 1964), the warhead was retrieved with a parachute. Flight tests of the rocket were completed by May 20, 1968, and on November 19 of the same year it entered service. The first (and only) regiment with 18 launchers was deployed on August 25, 1969. A total of 139 8K67s flew between 1963 and 1975 with 16 failures.

The Tsyklon series of civilian space launchers from Ukraine is based on the R-36orb (8К69) or R-36-O (capital O for Orbital) design. The R-36-O launched many orbital satellites (like Kosmos 160, SATCAT 2806, on 17 May 1967) in the 1960s and 1970s as part of the FOBS weapons program.

==== R-36M (SS-18 Mod 1) ====
Variant of the R-36M carrying a single large reentry vehicle, with a warhead yield of 18-25 Mt, a distance of about . In January 1971, cold-launch tests began during which the mortar launch was perfected. The actual flight tests for the missile began on 21 February 1973, though some sources suggest that testing began in October 1972. The testing phase of the R-36M with various different types of warheads was finished in October 1975 and on 30 December 1975 deployment began (though some Western sources suggest that an initial operational capability was reached in early 1975). A total of 56 were deployed by 1977, though all were replaced by R-36MUTTKh missiles by 1984. These high-yield weapons were assessed in the West as possibly developed to attack American Minuteman ICBM launch control centers.

==== R-36M (SS-18 Mod 2) ====
Variant of the R-36M with a post-boost vehicle and up to eight reentry vehicles, each with a warhead yield estimated at between 0.5 and 1.5 Mt, with a range capability of about . The MIRVs were placed in pairs, and a post boost vehicle with a command structure and a propulsion system were contained in the nose cone of the R-36M. The flight tests of this variant began in September 1973 (though some Western sources suggest that the initial flight test occurred in August 1973), with IOC in 1975. Approximately 132 were deployed by 1978, but the post-boost vehicle design was seriously flawed, and all missiles were replaced by R-36MUTTKh by 1983.

==== R-36MUTTKh (SS-18 Mod 3) ====
Variant of the R-36MUTTKh with a single large reentry vehicle that was an improved version of the R-36M. On 16 August 1976, a few months after the R-36M entered service, the development of an improved modification of the R-36M (15A14) was approved. This missile subsequently received the designation R-36MUTTKh (15A18) and was developed by KB Yuzhnoye (OKB-586) through December 1976. The R-36MUTTKh was capable of carrying two different nose cones. On 29 November 1979, deployment of the improved R-36M with a single reentry vehicle carrying an 18–25 Mt warhead began. This variant is no longer in service.

==== R-36MUTTKh (SS-18 Mod 4) ====
Variant of the R-36MUTTKh with multiple warheads. It was probably designed to attack and destroy ICBMs and other hardened targets in the US. Its increasing accuracy made it possible to reduce the yield of the warheads and allowed an increase in the number of warheads from 8 to 10. According to some Western estimates, evidence suggested that it may be capable of carrying as many as 14 RVs (this may reflect observation of the deployment of countermeasures intended to overcome a ballistic missile defense, or to confuse American attack characterization systems). The flight-design tests of the R-36MUTTKh began on 31 October 1977 and in November 1979 the flight tests of the MIRVed missile were completed. The first three regiments were put on alert on 18 September 1979. During 1980 a total of 120 missiles were deployed, replacing the last remaining R-36 missiles. In 1982–1983 the remaining R-36M missiles were also replaced with the new R-36MUTTKh and the total number of deployed missiles reached the maximum 308 ceiling established in the SALT-1 treaty. The R-36MUTTKh force had the estimated capability to destroy 65 to 80 percent of US ICBM silos using two nuclear warheads against each. Even after this type of attack, it was estimated that more than 1000 R-36MUTTKh warheads would be available for further strikes against targets in the US. After 2009, the R-36MUTTKh were all eliminated in favor of the newer R-36M2.

==== R-36M2 Voevoda (SS-18 Mod 5) ====
This newer, more accurate version placed in converted silos allowed the R-36M family to remain the bulwark of the SRF&#x27;s hard-target-kill capability. The R-36M2 carries 10 MIRVs, each having a nearly twice the yield of the R-36MUTTKh warheads according to Western estimates (approximately 750 kt to 1 Mt), though Russian sources suggest a yield of 550–750 kt each. The increase in the R-36M2&#x27;s warhead yield, along with improved accuracy, would, under the START treaty, help allow the Russians to maintain their hard-target-kill wartime requirements even with the 50 percent cut in heavy ICBMs the START agreement required. The technical proposals to build a modernized heavy ICBM were made in June 1979. The missile subsequently received the designation R-36M2 Voevoda and the industrial index number 15A18M. The design of the R-36M2 was completed in June 1982. The R-36M2 had a series of new engineering features. The engine of the second stage is completely built into the fuel tank (earlier this was only used on SLBMs) and the design of the transport-launching canister was altered. Unlike the R-36M, the 10 warheads on the post-boost vehicle are located on a special frame in two circles. The flight tests of the R-36M2 equipped with 10 MIRVs began in March 1986 and were completed in March 1988. The first regiment with these missiles was put on alert on 30 July 1988 and was deployed on 11 August 1988. This is the only variant still operational.

One of the missile&#x27;s most important features is its storage/basing in a container, inserted in the silo. The container doubles as a mortar barrel – it has a &quot;piston&quot; at its bottom, beneath the missile. The drum-like &quot;piston&quot; is filled with a slow-burning, gas pressure-generating charge that pushes, mortar-like, the missile from the container. Only when several meters above the silo with the now empty container the &quot;piston&quot; is pushed sideways by a small rocket motor to avoid being accelerated towards the silo by the ignition of the missile&#x27;s main engine. Thus the silo is a) spared the burning-out by the main engine flames, and so b) the empty container could be quickly removed and a new container with missile could be inserted by a ready transporter/erector into the intact silo, allowing for a second salvo before the adversary&#x27;s warheads arrive. This feature was a deep concern for the US side during the SALT/START negotiations, as it gave Soviet Union the possibility to strike US targets again after the first missile exchange was concluded.

==== R-36M2 Voevoda (SS-18 Mod 6) ====
The flight tests of the R-36M2 missile carrying a single warhead with a yield of 20 Mt were completed in September 1989 and deployment began in August 1991. Ten missiles were deployed. One intended use of these large warheads was high altitude detonation to incapacitate electronics and communications through a very large electromagnetic pulse, however, the most likely use would be against missile launch control centers as the stated purpose for which the R-36MUTTKh warheads were designed. These missiles were all decommissioned by late 2009.

=== Derivatives ===
A proposal has been advanced to modify Voyevoda R-36M2 Satan heavy ICBMs to destroy incoming asteroids of up to 100 m, similar to the Chelyabinsk asteroid.

<doc id="1068565" wikidata="Q472510" url="?curid=1068565" title="Ernst Alexanderson">
<text>Ernst Frederick Werner Alexanderson (; January 25, 1878 – May 14, 1975) was a Swedish-American electrical engineer and inventor who was a pioneer in radio development. He invented the Alexanderson alternator, an early radio transmitter used between 1906 and the 1930s for longwave long distance radio transmission. Alexanderson also created the amplidyne, a direct current amplifier used during the Second World War for controlling anti-aircraft guns.

==Background==
Alexanderson was born in Uppsala, Sweden. He studied at the University of Lund (1896–97) and was educated at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and the Technische Hochschule in Berlin, Germany. He emigrated to the United States in 1902 and spent much of his life working for the General Electric and Radio Corporation of America.

==Engineering work==
Alexanderson designed the Alexanderson alternator, an early longwave radio transmitter, one of the first devices which could transmit modulated audio (sound) over radio waves. He had been employed at General Electric for only a short time when GE received an order from Canadian-born professor and researcher Reginald Fessenden, then working for the US Weather Bureau, for a specialized alternator with much higher frequency than others in existence at that time, for use as a radio transmitter. Fessenden had been working on the problem of transmitting sound by radio waves, and had concluded that a new type of radio transmitter was needed, a continuous wave transmitter. Designing a machine that would rotate fast enough to produce radio waves proved a formidable challenge. Alexanderson&#x27;s family were convinced the huge spinning rotors would fly apart and kill him, and he set up a sandbagged bunker from which to test them. In the summer of 1906 Mr. Alexanderson&#x27;s first effort, a 50 kHz alternator, was installed in Fessenden&#x27;s radio station in Brant Rock, Massachusetts. By fall its output had been improved to 500 watts and 75 kHz. On Christmas Eve, 1906, Fessenden made an experimental broadcast of Christmas music, including him playing the violin, that was heard by Navy ships and shore stations down the East Coast as far as Arlington. This is considered the first AM radio entertainment broadcast.

Alexanderson continued improving his machine, and the Alexanderson alternator became widely used in high power very low frequency commercial and Naval wireless stations to transmit radiotelegraphy traffic at intercontinental distances, until by the 1930s it was replaced by vacuum tube transmitters. The only surviving transmitter in a working state is at the Grimeton radio station outside Varberg, Sweden. It is a prime example of pre-electronic radio technology and was added as a UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Site list in 2004.

Alexanderson was also instrumental in the development of television. The first television broadcast in the United States was received in 1927 at his GE Plot home at 1132 Adams Rd, Schenectady, N.Y. The following year he developed the coordination of sound and movement on the first television drama, &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Messenger&quot;. In 1930, he conducted an early public demonstration of his large screen television system on a closed-circuit channel at Proctors in Schenectady.

Alexanderson retired from General Electric in 1948. The inventor and engineer remained active to an advanced age. He continued television research as a consultant for the Radio Corporation of America filing his 321st patent application in 1955. Over his lifetime, Alexanderson received 345 US patents, the last filed in 1968 at age 89. He died in 1975 and was buried at Vale Cemetery in Schenectady, New York.

Alexanderson is also mentioned in connection with the emergence of the patent system, that he was partially critical to. As the technology historian David Noble writes:
==Kidnapping incident==
In 1923, Alexanderson&#x27;s son, Verner, was kidnapped. Alexanderson broadcast an appeal for help on the radio. The child was located after three days and returned to his family. The kidnappers were later caught.

==Honors==
*IEEE Medal of Honor from the Institute of Radio Engineers, now IEEE, (1919) 
*IEEE Edison Medal from the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, now IEEE, (1944)
*Valdemar Poulsen Gold Medal from the (1947)

<text>Ashmore is a village and civil parish in the North Dorset district of Dorset, England, southwest of Salisbury.

The village is centred on a circular pond and has a church and several stone cottages and farms, many with thatched roofs. It is the highest village in the county with the contour passing close to the village church (although the north side of the town of Shaftesbury, Dorset, is slightly higher at ).

The pond or &quot;mere&quot; gave the village its original name of &quot;Ash-mere&quot;.

In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 188.

==History==
Three round barrows have been found in the parish: two barrows south of the village near Well Bottom, and one west of the village near the boundary with the village of Fontmell Magna; this latter barrow was excavated in the 19th century and bones were recovered. Ashmore may have been the site of a Neolithic market place or settlement.

The Roman road from Bath to Badbury Rings passes through the east of the parish. The situation of the village is similar to Romano-British sites in the area, and there may have been a military camp and trading post in the area.

In 1086, Ashmore was recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Aisemare&quot;; it had 24 households, 7 ploughlands and of meadow. It was in Cranborne Hundred and had a value of £15 to the lord of the manor, who was King William.

Until 1859, Ashmore had an open field system; the three fields—North Field to the north, and Sandpit Fields and Broadridge to the south—were roughly equal in size and covered an area of . At the same time there was also a considerable area of enclosed fields, covering in 1590.

===Ashmore as an ancient continuously inhabited village===
In his pioneering work &quot;The Making of the English Landscape&quot; (1955), historian W.G. Hoskins wrote that, although &quot;It yet remains to be proved that there is any village in England which has been continuously inhabited since Celtic times&quot;, certain &quot;exciting clues&quot; led him to believe Ashmore was such a place.

Hoskins noted that Ashmore lies in an area thickly studded with Romano-British remains. It is a hilltop village, a fact &quot;particularly suggestive of great antiquity&quot;. Furthermore, it was too far from the river valleys for it to be squeezed out by the Early English settlers, who would have let it be. 

For Hoskins, a telling clue was the settlement&#x27;s ancient nucleus: the village pond. Such embanked ponds may go back to &quot;the beginning of the Christian era or a little earlier&quot;. The parish church lies some distance from the pond, on the outskirts of the village, suggesting that Christianity was a relative latecomer. &quot;Ashmore may well be a Romano-British village which has survived without a break to the present day&quot;.

==Geography==
Ashmore parish is situated on the hills of Cranborne Chase southeast of Shaftesbury and north of Blandford Forum. The underlying geology is chalk, overlain by clay-with-flints in the south and southeast. The village, which at above sea level is the highest in Dorset, is sited on a spur of land between dry valleys which drain south and southwest. All of Ashmore parish is within the Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

The nearest rail link is from the village at Tisbury railway station and the nearest air link (Bournemouth International Airport) is away.


==Church and Chapel==

The parish church of St. Nicholas is about 100 metres west of the village pond, west of High Street. Its chancel arch is said to date from the 13th century and it was rebuilt in 1874. On the opposite side of the High Street is a Wesleyan chapel which dates from 1855.
==Demography==
In the 2011 census the parish had 97 dwellings, 87 households and a population of 188.

In the first national census in 1891 the village had a population of 228.

==Culture==
In midsummer a celebration known as &#x27;Filly Loo&#x27; (or &#x27;Filleigh Loo&#x27;) takes place around Ashmore pond, with a Green Man, country dancing, morris dancers and live music. The event&#x27;s ancient origins are mysterious but may have pagan influences; theories include that it celebrated either the pond&#x27;s constancy as a water supply, the summer solstice, or the end of the cultivated filbert (hazelnut) harvest. The meaning of the name &#x27;Filly Loo&#x27; has also attracted more than one explanation, including that it is West Country dialect for &#x27;uproar&#x27;, a corruption of the French &#x27;La Fille de l&#x27;Eau&#x27;, (&#x27;maiden of the water&#x27;), or a corruption of &#x27;Filbert Louis&#x27;, a nickname of Louis Rideout, one of the historical instigators of the event. The event was revived in 1956 as a folk dance festival, and takes place on the Friday night nearest to Midsummer Day or the Feast of St. John the Baptist.

<text>James Gregory (December 23, 1911 – September 16, 2002) was an American character actor who played roles such as Schaffer in &quot;Al Capone&quot; (1959), the McCarthy-like Sen. John Iselin in &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962), the audacious General Ursus in &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1970), and crusty Inspector Frank Luger in the television sitcom &quot;Barney Miller&quot; (1975–1982).

== Career ==
In 1939, he made his Broadway debut in a production of &quot;Key Largo&quot;. 
He served from 1941 to 1946 in the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps during World War II. His early acting work included army training films; one such appearance is excerpted in &quot;The Atomic Café&quot; (1982). He also worked in radio, including a year (1955–1956) on &quot;21st Precinct&quot;.

Gregory was the lead in &quot;The Lawless Years&quot;, a 1920s-era crime drama which aired 45 episodes on NBC. In the series, which ran from 1959 to 1961, he played NYPD Detective Barney Ruditsky.

After his appearance as the McCarthyistic Senator Iselin in &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962), Gregory starred in the film &quot;PT 109&quot; (1963) with Cliff Robertson. He played Dean Martin&#x27;s spy boss MacDonald, in the &quot;Matt Helm&quot; film series; in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series in the episode &quot;Dagger of the Mind&quot; (1966), as Dr. Tristan Adams; and in the Elvis Presley film &quot;Clambake&quot; (1967). In the pilot movie for the 1968 &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; series, Gregory became the first actor to portray State Department official Jonathan Kaye, a recurring character on the series.

Gregory portrayed Nick Hannigan on &quot;Detective School&quot;. He was a semiregular on the TV series &quot;Barney Miller&quot; as Deputy Inspector Frank Luger. His final acting credit was in a 1986 episode of &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Gregory was married to Ann Miltner for 58 years. He died of natural causes on September 16, 2002, in Sedona, Arizona, aged 90.

<text>Ferdinand Jacobus Domela Nieuwenhuis (31 December 1846 – 18 November 1919) was a Dutch socialist politician and later a social anarchist and anti-militarist. He was a Lutheran preacher who, after he lost his faith, started a political fight for workers. He was a founder of the Dutch socialist movement and the first socialist in the Dutch parliament.

==Biography==

Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis was born in Amsterdam, the son of Ferdinand Jacob Domela Nieuwenhuis, Lutheran pastor and professor of theology, and Henriette Frances Berry. When Nieuwenhuis was ten years old, his mother died. His brother was art collector Adriaan Jacob Domela Nieuwenhuis. His family added the second surname &quot;Domela&quot; in 1859.

After he died in Hilversum at the age of 72 on 18 November 1919, he was one of the first to be cremated and interred at Westerveld in Velsen. His funeral procession, attended by 12,000 sympathizers, traveled through Amsterdam.

<text>Burton Bradstock is a village and civil parish in Dorset, England, approximately southeast of Bridport and inland from the English Channel at Chesil Beach. In the 2011 Census the parish had a population of 948. The village lies in the Bride Valley, close to the mouth of the small River Bride. It comprises 16th- and 17th-century thatched cottages, a parish church (dedicated to St Mary the Virgin), two pubs, a primary school, shop, post office stores, beach café, hotel, garage, village hall, reading room a library. The parish has a National Coastwatch Institution Station, Lyme Bay Station.

==History==
The place was first recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Bridetone&quot;, it had 28 households and the lord of the manor was the Abbey of Saint-Wandrille. The toponym means the place (Old English &quot;tūn&quot;) on the River Bride, and therefore has a different origin from most places named &quot;Burton&quot;, including Burton, Dorset. 

In 1286 land in the village was acquired by Bradenstoke Priory in Wiltshire. Bradenstoke, sometimes pronounced &quot;Bradstock&quot;, gave its name to the suffix &quot;Bradstock&quot;.

The local church, &quot;The Parish Church of St. Mary&quot;, dates largely from the late 14th or early 15th century, though it was significantly restored in 1897. 950 yards south-east of the church is the Bronze Age burial mound of &quot;Bind Barrow&quot;, it is in diameter and high, it was scheduled as an ancient monument in 1959.

The cliffs were used for training before the Normandy landings in 1943.

==Geography==
Burton Bradstock lies on Dorset&#x27;s Jurassic Coast, which in the vicinity of the village comprises vertical cliffs up to high. Near the top of these cliffs is a layer of Inferior Oolite, which contains large ammonites. Rockfalls result in these being accessible to fossil hunters on the beach beneath. At Hive Beach there is a gap in the cliffs; the National Trust owns the land here and provide a car park. There is a yearly Spring Tide Festival on the beach.

==Governance==
The village is within the Dorset Council ward of Chesil Bank and the parliamentary constituency of West Dorset.

==Transport==
The village has a frequent local bus service to Bridport via West Bay, and is also served by the X53 coastal bus service which runs east to Weymouth, Wareham and Poole and west to Bridport, Lyme Regis, Seaton and Exeter. The village has several local footpaths including one to the beach and the coastpath to West Bay.

==Famous residents==
The musician Billy Bragg has lived in the village since 2000.

<text>SAVILLE is a classified NSA Type 1 encryption algorithm, developed in the late 1960s, jointly by the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in the UK and the National Security Agency (NSA) in the US. It is used broadly, often for voice encryption, and implemented in many encryption devices.

Little is known publicly about the algorithm itself due to its classified nature and inclusion in the NSA&#x27;s Suite A. Some documentation related to the KYK-13 fill device and statements made by military officials confirm that SAVILLE has a 128-bit key, which consists of 120 key bits and an 8-bit checksum. Furthermore, it is known that SAVILLE has two modes of operation: Autonomous Mode (also known as Key-Auto-KEY or KAK) and Autoclave Mode (also known as Cipher-Text Auto Key or CTAK). On the AIM microchip, it runs at 4% of the clock rate (compare DES at 76% and BATON at 129%). The Cypris chip mentions two modes; specifications for Windster and Indictor specify that they provide Saville I.

Some devices and protocols that implement SAVILLE:
* Secure Telephone Equipment (STU)
* The VINSON family (voice encryption)
* UK Lamberton (BID/250)
* APCO Project 25 (single-channel land mobile radios) (Saville has algorithm ID 04)
* Versatile encryption chips: AIM, Cypris, Sierra I/II, Windster, Indictor, Presidio, Railman
* Spendex 40
* Spendex 50 (also known as DBT)
* Elcrovox 1/4
* Motorola&#x27;s SECURENET encryption module named FASCINATOR

<doc id="1068602" wikidata="Q2174869" url="?curid=1068602" title="Chideock">
<text>Chideock ( ) is a village and civil parish in south west Dorset, England, situated close to the English Channel between Bridport and Lyme Regis. Dorset County Council&#x27;s 2013 estimate of the parish population is 550.

Chideock&#x27;s economy mostly comprises agriculture (arable and pastoral) and tourism. The parish includes part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site.

During much of its history Chideock has had a strong tradition of Catholicism; in the late 16th century four Chideock men were executed for their faith and became known as the Chideock Martyrs. There is a memorial to the men in the village.

The A35 trunk road passes through the village, which means the main street can have high volumes of traffic.

==Etymology==
The name of Chideock is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, as &quot;Cidihoc&quot;. This name is unusual in England for being derived from Common Brittonic, in this case the word that survives in modern Welsh as (&quot;wooded&quot;).

==History==
In 1379–80 John de Chideock, a manorial lord, built Chideock Castle just north of the village. During the Middle Ages ownership passed to the Catholic Arundell family, who used it to provide refuge for priests and loyal followers during subsequent religious persecution. During the Protestant reign of Elizabeth I the Arundell estate became Dorset&#x27;s main centre of Catholicism, and the locality witnessed considerable religious strife. Four local Catholic men—John Cornelius, Thomas Bosgrave, John Carey and Patrick Salmon—were martyred in the late 16th century; their trial took place in the main hall of what is now Chideock House Hotel and they were executed in Dorchester. The men became known as the Chideock Martyrs. A fifth man, Hugh Green, who became Chideock&#x27;s chaplain in 1612, was tried and executed in 1642. All five were beatified on 15 December 1929.

During the English Civil War Chideock was a royalist stronghold, and the castle changed hands more than once before it was ultimately left ruinous in 1645 by parliamentarian forces under the Governor of Lyme Regis, Colonel Ceeley. Chideock House Hotel may have been the headquarters of General Fairfax as he planned the castle&#x27;s overthrowing. Parts of the castle remained standing until at least 1733 but only some of the moat can be seen today; it is in a field, accessed by Ruins Lane, and marked by a crucifix as a memorial to the martyrs.
In 1802 the Arundells were succeeded by the Weld family of Lulworth Castle who in 1810 built Chideock Manor. The Welds were also Catholic and in 1870-2 Charles Weld designed and built the village&#x27;s Roman Catholic church in an unusual Romanesque style. It is dedicated to Our Lady Queen of Martyrs, and St Ignatius and remains in trust to the Weld family.

Among other surviving relics claimed by this location is St. Thomas More&#x27;s hair shirt, sent to Margaret Roper the day before his martyrdom and later presented for safe keeping by Margaret Clement. This was long in the custody of the community of Augustinian canonesses who, until 1983, lived at the convent at Abbotskerswell Priory, Devon. More recent sources, however, state that the shirt is now preserved at the Roman Catholic Buckfast Abbey, part of a Benedictine monastery, in Devon.
==Governance==
Chideock is in the electoral ward of Chideock and Symondsbury, which encompasses much of the coast between Charmouth and West Bay plus inland beyond Symondsbury. The total population of this ward is 1,745. This ward is one of 32 that comprise the West Dorset parliamentary constituency, which is currently represented in the UK national parliament by the Liberal Democrat Edward Morello.

==Geography==

Chideock is situated in the Dorset Council administrative area about west of Bridport, east of Lyme Regis and inland from the English Channel. The parish includes the coastal hamlet of Seatown, which is less than to the south on the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. Seatown has a long shelving pebble beach, with views up towards the hill which forms Golden Cap, which at is the highest cliff on the south coast of England. Fossilised ammonites and belemnites can often be found on the beach due to continued coastal erosion of the soft blue lias clays which make up the cliffs. Iron-rich rocks such as lodestone and magnetite can also be found on the beaches near the village – these are thought to have been transported down the coast from Chesil Beach, having been deposited there by a shipwreck in the 1800s. Similar collections of these rocks can be found on beaches along the Jurassic Coast and in the neighbouring counties of Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.

==Demography==
Dorset County Council&#x27;s 2013 estimate of the parish population is 550.

The population of the parish in the censuses between 1921 and 2001 is shown in the table below:

Results of the 2011 census have been published for the combined populations of Chideock parish and the small neighbouring parish of Stanton St Gabriel; the combined population was 686.

==Transport==
The A35 trunk road between Honiton and Southampton passes through Chideock, which in 1997 was the first village in Britain to have two speed cameras installed in response to perceived excessive speed. The National Trust refused permission for a prospective bypass over land it owns to the north of Golden Cap, citing its importance as an area of natural beauty. On 4 May 2010 a protest against the lack of a bypass was initiated by some residents and involved constant operation of a pedestrian crossing at the centre of the village for one hour&#x27;s duration every week. This campaign continued for a year and may result in restrictions on heavy goods vehicles in the village.

<text>Number 31 Squadron, known as &quot;the Goldstars&quot;, is a squadron of the Royal Air Force. The Squadron lays claim to being the first military unit to fly in India, where it was based from 1915 to 1947. Throughout the Cold War, No. 31 Squadron was based in West Germany, flying from RAF Laarbruch and RAF Brüggen. Between September 1984 and March 2019, the &quot;Goldstars&quot; operated the Panavia Tornado GR1/4, initially from RAF Brüggen and after August 2001 from RAF Marham, Norfolk. No. 31 Squadron was disbanded on 14 March 2019 at RAF Marham and reformed on 11 October 2023 at RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, equipped with the General Atomics Protector RG1.

==History==

===First World War and Inter-War period===

No. 31 Squadron was formed at Farnborough on 11 October 1915 as part of the Royal Flying Corps. The Squadron was initially composed of a single &#x27;A&#x27; flight and was equipped with the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c. No. 31 Squadron was soon deployed to Risalpur, on the North-West Frontier in the British Raj, where they arrived on 26 December. &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;C&#x27; flights were formed at Gosport in January and April 1916, before joining up with &#x27;A&#x27; flight in Risalpur in May. In 1917, the Squadron sent a detachment to Khormaskar, Aden, to fly reconnaissance flights against Ottoman forces. No. 31 Squadron helped form No. 114 Squadron at Lahore when it provided an initial nucleus in September 1917. No. 31 Squadron would remain operating in India throughout the entirety of the First World War, flying the B.E.2c, B.E.2e and the Henri Farman HF.27, primarily supporting the British Army against dissident tribesmen.

The Squadron, along with No. 114 Squadron, took part in operations during the Third Anglo-Afghan War between May and August 1919. No. 31 Squadron carried out raids on Jalalabad on 17, 20 and 24 May in which they lost three aircraft. In June 1919, the Squadron&#x27;s fleet was standardised with the replacement of the B.E.2s and HF.27s with the Bristol F.2B Fighter. For the next ten years, No. 31 Squadron helped police the Waziristan and Afghanistan regions as well as supporting the British Army in putting down any rebellions.

In February 1931, the Squadron replaced their outdated Bristol F.2Bs with the Westland Wapiti Mk.IIa. The 1935 Quetta earthquake forced the Squadron to relocate to RAF Drigh Road. In June 1937, No. 31 Squadron&#x27;s laurel wreath and mullet squadron badge was officially approved by King George VI. In April 1939, No. 31 Squadron became a bomber-transport squadron when it inherited Vickers Valentias from No. 216 Squadron and the Bomber Transport Flight. After re-equipping with the Valentia, the Squadron carried out attacks against Mirzali Khan (known as the Faqir of Ipi) during the 1939 Waziristan campaign.

===Second World War===
For the first 18 months of the Second World War, No. 31 Squadron remained stationed at the North-West Frontier. In April 1941, the Squadron started to be equipped with Douglas DC-2s and began flying support missions to RAF Habbaniya during the 1941 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état and the following Anglo-Iraqi War. Returning to India the squadron re-equipped with the Douglas Dakota Mk.I. After the Japanese invasion of Burma, it flew missions between Calcutta and Rangoon dropping supplies for the XIVth Army. After World War II the squadron moved to Java. In 1946, the Squadron was disbanded in Java and reformed at PAF Base Masroor, Mauripur Karachi, at that time in British India.

===Cold War (1948–1984)===
At the end of 1947 it was again disbanded, but reformed in July 1948 when &quot;the Goldstars&quot; took over the aircraft and role of the Metropolitan Communications Squadron at RAF Hendon. On 1 March 1955, No. 31 Squadron reverted to its previous identity, and moved to RAF Laarbruch in West Germany with English Electric Canberra PR.7s, becoming a photo reconnaissance unit. &quot;The Goldstars&quot; received their Squadron Standard, for 25 years of service, on 13 September 1956. Between 8 and 12 September 1958, No. 31 (Photographic Reconnaissance) Squadron participated in Royal Flush III, a reconnaissance competition between 2 ATAF and 4 ATAF at Spangdahlem AFB. &quot;The Goldstars&quot; flew alongside No. 17 Squadron for 2 ATAF against USAF Douglas RB-66 Destroyers of 4 ATAF for the high altitude part of the competition, with the RAF squadrons being awarded the trophy by General Alfred Gruenther. No. 31 Squadron hosted 3º Stormo of the Italian Air Force when they deployed to RAF Laarbruch in 1967. No. 31 (PR) Squadron disbanded at RAF Laarbruch on 31 March 1971.
In June 1971, crew from No. 31 Squadron began to arrive at RAF Brüggen to help prepare the squadron for its conversion to the McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR.2. &quot;The Goldstars&quot; flew their first Phantom sortie on 20 July 1971. The squadron held their reformation parade at RAF Brüggen on 7 October 1971, with the occasion marked by a flypast of four Phantom FGR.2s. No. 31 Squadron were declared combat ready to Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) on 1 March 1972, with the unit shortly after deploying to Decimomannu Air Base, Sardinia, for an Armament Practice Camp (APC). On 25 June 1973, &quot;the Goldstars&quot; lost Phantom &quot;XV440&quot; when it crashed into the Wadden Sea, killing pilot Flt. Lt. Hugh Kennedy and WSO Sqn. Ldr. David Hodges.

No. 31 (Designate) Squadron was formed on 1 January 1976 in preparation for conversion to the SEPECAT Jaguar GR.1 strike aircraft, with the new OC Wg. Cdr. Terry Nash arriving at Brüggen on 12 January. The squadron&#x27;s Jaguar GR.1s were declared operational on 30 June 1976, with the Phantoms being given to both No. 19 Squadron and No. 92 Squadron. In December 1976, No. 31 Squadron was declared combat ready to SACEUR, with conventional weapons and eight British WE.177 nuclear bombs from 1977.

===Tornado GR (1984–2019)===

No. 31 (Designate) Squadron was formed in September 1984, when the unit took delivery of Panavia Tornado GR.1s at RAF Brüggen. The &quot;Goldstars&quot; completed their conversion from the Jaguar on 1 November 1984. The squadron&#x27;s assignment to SACEUR and its war role did not change, although the squadron&#x27;s allocation of WE.177 weapons increased to eighteen to account for the greater capacity of the Tornado, which could each carry two nuclear weapons, and the ratio of weapons to aircraft at full strength increased to 1.5 : 1. The apparent mismatch between aircraft numbers and WE.177 numbers is explained thus: RAF staff planners expected up to one third attrition in a conventional European high-intensity war, and some aircraft were to be held back in reserve to ensure that if a conflict escalated to use of tactical nuclear weapons, there were sufficient aircraft surviving to deliver the squadron&#x27;s full stockpile of eighteen nuclear weapons. 

In 1991, No. 31 Squadron was the lead Squadron of the Dhahran Tornado GR1/GR1A detachment during Operation Granby (Gulf War 1). Under the overall command of Wing Commander Jeremy (Jerry) Witts, the composite squadron was principally comprised from No. 31 Squadron with elements of Nos. IX (B), 14, 17 and 27 Sqns together with a reconnaissance flight formed from elements of Nos. II (AC) and 13 Squadrons. Wg. Cdr. Witts was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his actions. 

The squadron&#x27;s nuclear strike role at RAF Bruggen finished in 1994. On 1 January 1995, the squadron was declared operational in the Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) role equipped with the Air Launched Anti Radiation Missile ALARM Anti Radiation Missile. While all Tornado GR4s are capable of carrying the ALARM Anti Radiation Missile, only No. 31 Squadron and No. IX (Bomber) Squadrons specialise in the role. In this role they are known as &quot;Pathfinder&quot; squadrons.
During 1999, the squadron re-equipped with the Tornado GR4. In the same year, No. 31 Squadron participated in Operation Engadine, NATO operations over the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. For the latter part of this operation the Squadron was temporarily based in Corsica. No. 31 Squadron was the last RAF Squadron to be based at RAF Brüggen in Germany, before returning to the UK to be based at RAF Marham, Norfolk, in August 2001. In 2003, &quot;the Goldstars&quot; formed the core of the Ali Al Salem Air Combat Wing in Kuwait; an amalgamated Composite squadron of Nos. 31, 9, 617 and II (AC) Squadron crews under the overall command of Wing Commander Paddy Teakle (OC No. 31 Squadron at the time). His actions in command of the Squadron earned him the DSO. From Ali Al Salem Air Base, the squadron operated over Iraq during Operation Resonate South and Operation Telic.

No. 31 Squadron became the lead RAF Tornado GR4 unit on the Brimstone anti-tank missile, accepting the weapon into RAF service at its home base, RAF Marham, on 7 April 2005. 
The squadron completed a tour of Afghanistan on Operation Herrick in 2012 providing fast air support to ground troops in contact.

In September 2012, they participated in Exercise Shaheen Star, a series of exercises in the United Arab Emirates with the host nation&#x27;s air force, the French Air Force and the United States Air Force. On 12 August 2014, &quot;the Goldstars&quot; deployed to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus, with six Tornados after the UK government authorised reconnaissance missions over Mount Sinjar in Iraq. However, they were shortly relieved in order for the squadron to deploy to Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan, for their (and the Tornado&#x27;s) last Operation Herrick deployment – returning to Marham on 11 November 2014. No. 31 Squadron returned to RAF Akrotiri in February 2015 for their first Operation Shader deployment.

On 10 July 2018, to celebrate the RAF&#x27;s 100th anniversary, nine Tornado GR.4s from No. 31 Squadron and No. IX (B) Squadron participated in a flypast over London. On 13 November 2018, Tornado GR.4 &quot;ZD716&quot; was unveiled by the RAF in a special retirement scheme to mark 35 years of Tornado operations. No. 31 Squadron was disbanded, along with No. IX (B) Squadron, on 14 March 2019 at RAF Marham.

===Protector RG1 (2023 – present)===
No. 31 Squadron reformed on 11 October 2023 at RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, equipped with the General Atomics MQ-9B, a remotely piloted air system (RPAS), which will be known as the Protector RG1 in RAF service. The first Protector was delivered to Waddington on 29 September 2023, with operational flying expected to start in 2025.

<text>The Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S&amp;DJR, also known as the S&amp;D, S&amp;DR or SDJR), was an English railway line jointly owned by the Midland Railway (MR) and the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) that grew to connect Bath (in north-east Somerset) and Bournemouth (then in Hampshire; now in south-east Dorset), with a branch in Somerset from Evercreech Junction to Burnham-on-Sea and Bridgwater. Strictly speaking, its main line only ran from Bath Junction to Broadstone, as the Bath to Bath Junction section was wholly owned by the MR and the Broadstone to Bournemouth section was owned by the LSWR.

Brought under joint ownership in 1876, the S&amp;DJR was used for freight and local passenger traffic over the Mendip Hills, and for weekend holiday traffic to Bournemouth. Criticised as the &quot;Slow and Dirty&quot; or the &quot;Slow and Doubtful&quot;, it closed in 1966 as part of the Beeching axe despite protests from the local community.

== Overview ==
The initial Somerset and Dorset Railway (S&amp;DR) was created on 1 September 1862 by an amalgamation of the Somerset Central Railway (SCR; opened in 1854) and the Dorset Central Railway (DCR; opened in 1860). The SCR line ran from Highbridge to Templecombe and the DCR line from Blandford to Wimborne, and by 1863 when a line connecting them was opened, the Somerset and Dorset Railway ran from Burnham-on-Sea to Wimborne, where S&amp;DR trains could use a line owned by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) to reach Poole Junction (now Hamworthy) on the Dorset south coast.

This cross-country link between the Bristol Channel and the English Channel failed to attract the substantial traffic expected and so the S&amp;DR, falling into dire financial straits, made a desperate bid to increase their prospects by building an extension from Evercreech Junction to Bath in 1874, to link with the Midland Railway. This provided a through route between the south coast and Midlands and north and produced a substantial increase in traffic, but came too late to save the company. The S&amp;DR went into receivership and in 1875 it became jointly owned by the Midland Railway and the LSWR, and was renamed the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S&amp;DJR). After the 1 January 1923 Grouping, joint ownership of the S&amp;DJR passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) and the Southern Railway.

Its attractions were its quirky individuality, its varied scenery (captured particularly by the photographs and pioneering cine films taken by Ivo Peters), and the way it seemed to struggle against overwhelming odds. Its main line climbed to above sea level at Masbury, and it contained several single line sections, but on summer Saturdays it managed to handle a considerable volume of holiday trains, when it seemed every possible locomotive was drafted into service to handle heavy trains requiring double-heading and banking over the steep gradients.

The S&amp;DJR started before the railway network in England had settled down, and both local and strategic aspirations structured the line&#x27;s earliest days. Work has now started to restore some remnants of the line to working condition, notably at Midsomer Norton in Somerset and Shillingstone in Dorset.

== The S&amp;D in the early 1960s ==

The fame of the Somerset &amp; Dorset line reached its peak in the first years of the 1960s, just before final closure as part of the nationwide reduction of railway services, usually called the Beeching Axe.

The main line was still active, carrying local passenger trains and a daily long-distance train, the &quot;Pines Express&quot;, from Manchester to Bournemouth West, reversing at Bath Green Park. Local freight on the route survived in adequate volumes, although the Somerset coalfield was becoming ever more uneconomic to work and so coal traffic had dwindled.

On summer Saturdays, the line continued to carry a very heavy traffic of long-distance trains, from northern towns to Bournemouth and back. The traditional nature of the operation of the route was reflected in the fact that most of the originating towns were on the former Midland Railway system, almost as if the railway grouping of 1923 had never taken place. These trains brought unusual traffic combinations to the route, and the home locomotive fleet was augmented by strangers such as LMS Jubilee Class 4-6-0s from the north, though these did not work over the S&amp;D proper, and West Country Pacifics from the south. For the summer seasons of 1960, 1961 and 1962 a small number of BR Standard Class 9F 2-10-0s, which were designed as heavy freight locomotives, were transferred to Bath locomotive depot, in an attempt to reduce the preponderance of double-heading required on the majority of trains between Bath and Evercreech Junction on account of the steep gradients encountered on either side of Masbury summit. For the same reason, during the summer months the native S&amp;D class 7F 2-8-0s were also pressed into service to assist, or to handle lighter trains on their own.

The route remained almost entirely steam-worked until closure, though some diesel multiple units ran over the line on a couple of excursions only in the final years. After closure, diesels worked demolition trains, and some diesel workings operated to Blandford Forum after the line had closed.

Freight in the 1960s was largely in the hands of Fowler 4Fs, Stanier 8Fs, Standard Class 5 4-6-0s, and the S&amp;DJR 7F 2-8-0s, assisted by Fowler 3F &quot;Jinty&quot; 0-6-0Ts and Great Western Railway Pannier Tanks; freight trains were assisted in rear by these locomotives over the Combe Down summit and over Masbury.

The Highbridge branch trains were latterly worked by GWR 2251 Class 0-6-0s, and LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0.s

== Geography ==
The S&amp;D main line ran south from Bath Queen Square (later renamed Green Park) to Radstock, at one time the centre of the Somerset coalfield, and then over Masbury Summit, at 811 feet (274 m) above sea level, crossing the Mendip Hills, via Shepton Mallet and entering the catchment area of the River Stour to Wincanton and Blandford, joining the LSWR South West Main Line at Poole, the S&amp;D trains continuing to the LSWR station at Bournemouth West.

The branch line from Highbridge to Evercreech Junction had been the original main line, when attracting steamer traffic across the Bristol Channel had been an objective. It traversed a sparsely populated area, and when the marine connection ceased, only Glastonbury and Street in the centre of the route contributed any worthwhile income. There had been other, shorter branches, but these too generated very little traffic and they had all closed by the early 1950s.

Serving only a string of medium-sized market towns between its extremities, the S&amp;D generated a modest internal traffic, and had daunting operational costs, due to the difficulty of its main line. Its strategic significance was as part of a through route between the Midlands and the South Coast, by connecting with the Midland Railway at Bath. The Midland Railway linked Bath to Bristol and via Gloucester to Birmingham and the north. Heavy summer holiday passenger traffic and healthy through freight business was the result, but the long and difficult main line was always very expensive to run.

There was only one intermediate connection on the route, at Templecombe where the West of England line was crossed. There was an awkward layout there, requiring through trains to reverse along a spur between the S&amp;D main line and the east-west LSWR main line. The full journey time for ordinary passenger trains was typically four hours, although the limited stop holiday expresses managed it in two hours.

Much of the S&amp;D was single track, but the main line was double track from Midford to Templecombe, and from Blandford Forum to Corfe Mullen. Crossing trains on the single line sections always added operational interest to the line, but many enthusiasts chose to focus on the quirky operation of trains calling at Templecombe and the light engine movements associated with them. Trains had to reverse from Templecombe station to Templecombe Junction (for southbound trains, and the reverse for northbound), requiring use of a pilot engine to assist with these manoeuvres. In at least one case, a northbound train and a southbound train, both requiring to call at Templecombe station, were timed to arrive at Templecombe Junction simultaneously. The operating procedure was for the northbound train to set back on to the southbound train at the junction, thence to be pulled into the station by the southbound train engine, with the northbound engine still on the back. After completion of station work, the entire equipage was pulled back to the junction by the northbound train engine, where the two trains were uncoupled to continue on their separate ways.

== History ==
The Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway came into existence on 1 November 1875. It was formed when the Somerset &amp; Dorset Railway ran into unmanageable financial difficulties and they leased the line for 999 years to the Midland Railway and the London and South Western Railway jointly.

The origins of the Somerset &amp; Dorset Railway lay with two separate companies, which built sections of line, each with their own ambitions.

=== Somerset Central Railway ===
The Somerset Central Railway started out as a local railway line designed to give Glastonbury transport access for manufactured goods, to the Bristol Channel and to the Bristol and Exeter Railway&#x27;s main line. It soon saw that a longer connection southwards was useful, and made an alliance with the Dorset Central Railway, and built an easterly line to join that railway at Cole.

==== Origins ====

The Somerset Central Railway opened on 28 August 1854 from Glastonbury to Highbridge Wharf. Glastonbury was then an important manufacturing town, but its location made the transport of goods difficult. Coastal shipping was still dominant for transport and the Bristol Channel ports of Bridgwater and Highbridge were about 18 miles away. The Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&amp;ER) had been opened, passing through both those towns, in 1841.

Highbridge was chosen as the destination because a route to Bridgwater would have been much more challenging technically, because of high ground to the east of Bridgwater itself. The Glastonbury Canal had been bought by the friendly B&amp;ER, and by arrangement with them the canal was closed and the railway built partly on the course of the canal, reducing construction cost.

The line was opened as broad gauge, as a feeder to the B&amp;ER, and had stations at Glastonbury, Ashcott, Shapwick, Edington, Bason Bridge (opened in 1862) and Highbridge at the B&amp;ER station. There were goods facilities at Highbridge Wharf, to the west of the B&amp;ER line. The line was worked operationally by the B&amp;ER.

Initial results were encouraging, and the original objective of the railway, to give Glastonbury access to the maritime and railway transport links at Highbridge, was successfully achieved.

==== Development ====
Highbridge Wharf became a hive of activity, and at this early date coastal shipping was still an important means of transporting goods. To reach South Coast destinations the ships had a difficult and hazardous passage round Land&#x27;s End, and there were hopes that the railway could become the core of a transport chain bringing manufactured goods, especially metal goods, from South Wales to the Southern Counties, and taking agricultural produce back to feed the industrial population in South Wales, using shipping across the Bristol Channel.

The success of Highbridge Wharf for goods traffic encouraged ideas of expanding passenger traffic across the Bristol Channel, and on 3 May 1858 the Somerset Central Railway opened an extension from Highbridge to a new passenger pier at Burnham, expecting heavy passenger traffic. The pier was actually a slip, a broad ramp 900 feet (274 m) long, sloping down at 1 in 21 into the tidal waters; and steamers berthed alongside at the point where the adjacent part of the slip was at a suitable height. Rails were laid on the slip, and single wagons were worked down to the steamers using a wire rope; passengers, however, walked to a platform at Burnham station nearby. In both cases the arrangement was awkward and inconvenient, and the anticipated traffic growth never materialised, and the Burnham Pier, which had cost £20,000, was a financial failure.

At the eastern end, a branch to the important city of Wells was opened on 15 March 1859. This had originally been planned to be part of a main line extension towards Frome, where the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway could be joined, giving the yearned-for access to the South Coast towns, but by now the Somerset Central thought that joining up with the Dorset Central Railway would be a more cost-effective option. Wells therefore was a branch line only, with the station at Priory Road. It too was broad gauge, and one intermediate station at Polsham was opened in 1861.

The impetus now however was the south-easterly link with the Dorset Central Railway, and parliamentary powers were sought for the extension to Cole.

==== The link to Cole ====
Cole was no destination in itself, but was the agreed point of meeting up with the Dorset Central Railway. The important town of Bruton lay nearby, but its topography made a closer approach difficult. The Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway had been opened in 1856, giving broad gauge access to the Great Western Railway (GWR) system, but the Somerset Central wanted to have through standard gauge access to the Dorset Central Railway and the South Coast. Parliamentary powers were sought and the standard gauge was specified, but pressure from the broad gauge B&amp;ER – who feared loss of the feeder traffic from the line it had supported – led to a requirement to lay broad gauge and to make a junction with the Wilts Somerset and Weymouth where the lines would cross.

The line from Glastonbury to Cole opened on 3 February 1862 and mixed gauge track was laid, although the required connection to the Wilts Somerset &amp; Weymouth was never opened. Glastonbury to Highbridge and Burnham was converted to mixed gauge at the same time. Intermediate stations between Glastonbury and Cole were West Pennard, Pylle and Evercreech.

=== Dorset Central Railway ===

==== Initial opening ====
The Dorset Central Railway had started with higher ambitions than the Somerset line. Its promoters had originally intended a connection to the north via Bath, but their actual railway started more modestly. It opened on 1 November 1860 from the LSWR station at Wimborne, to the important market town of Blandford. The Blandford station at this time was south of the river Stour, at the hamlet of Blandford St. Mary, until later amalgamation, when the bridge was built over the river.

The line was worked by the LSWR. This and all of the Dorset Central Railway&#x27;s lines were standard gauge. Intermediate stations were at Spetisbury, and Sturminster Marshall.

==== Northwards aspiration ====
Seeing that its northwards destiny could best be served by an alliance with the Somerset Central Railway, it obtained powers to extend to Cole and join that railway there, and it opened part of this route, from Templecombe to Cole on 3 February 1862, the same day that the Somerset company opened its section to Cole. There was one intermediate station, at Wincanton. All of this northern section was worked by the Somerset company.

==== Templecombe ====
Templecombe was a small community and its significance was the connection to London over the Salisbury &amp; Yeovil Railway&#x27;s line. The DCR trains used the Salisbury &amp; Yeovil Railway station on the main line. The difference in levels between the two lines and the availability of land induced the company to make the physical connection facing towards Salisbury and London, and the junction was to the east of the S&amp;YR station. The S&amp;YR provided a track from the point of junction back to their station, and DCR trains arriving from Cole had to reverse from the junction to the S&amp;YR station. It is unlikely at this early date that through running (without calling at Templecombe) was contemplated, and the DCR spur probably did not connect directly into the S&amp;YR main line.
=== Formation of the Somerset and Dorset Railway ===
The Somerset Central Railway and the northern part of the Dorset Central Railway were worked as a single unit from the beginning, and on 1 September 1862 the two railways were amalgamated by Act of Parliament, under the title Somerset &amp; Dorset Railway. At this time therefore, the system consisted of:
* the original main line and its eastward extension, running from Highbridge to Templecombe (the junction with the Salisbury &amp; Yeovil Railway);
* the Highbridge Wharf extension and the Burnham extension at the western end;
* the separate portion from Blandford to Wimborne Junction.

==== Closing the gap ====
The new company opened the missing link from Blandford to Templecombe on 31 August 1863, and now the original dream of a link from the English Channel to the Bristol Channel materialised. The LSWR allowed through passenger trains to run over their line between Wimborne and Poole, reversing at Wimborne. The Somerset and Dorset company therefore operated trains from Burnham to Poole and on the branch to Wells. At this time Poole station was on the western side of Holes Bay, at the location that ultimately became Hamworthy Goods.

Intermediate stations between the point of junction at Templecombe and Blandford were Templecombe (S&amp;DR station), Henstridge, Stalbridge, Sturminster Newton, Shillingstone and Blandford. The original connection from Cole to the Salisbury &amp; Yeovil Railway (S&amp;YR) had faced towards London, and the new line diverged half a mile or so north of the S&amp;YR line, passing under it by a bridge. The S&amp;D Templecombe station was provided between the new junction and the S&amp;YR bridge. The opening of Sturminster Newton station prompted the renaming of the Sturminster Marshall station to Bailey Gate (after the adjacent turnpike gate) to avoid confusion. At Blandford, a new station was built, situated more conveniently to the town, and the earlier DCR station south of the River Stour was closed.
==== Templecombe complications ====
Templecombe had suddenly become the most important interchange point on the system, and trains from Wimborne needed convenient access to a station. The company provided its own &quot;Lower&quot; station on the direct north–south line a little north of the S&amp;YR line on the east of its own line. S&amp;DR passengers had their own station, but the through traffic from Glastonbury and Highbridge to London was important, and would not think well of the half mile walk between the two stations. To accommodate those passengers, the S&amp;YR operated a shuttle train service between the two stations.


This arrangement could hardly continue, but the topography of the village was challenging. The solution eventually adopted was to construct a new west-facing connection entering directly into the S&amp;YR station. Because of the height difference it made its junction with the DCR main line some distance to the north at a new junction. The east-facing connection to the S&amp;YR line was severed, although the spur was retained as a siding connected at the Templecombe S&amp;DR end.


At some later date, it became obvious that the S&amp;D station to the east of its main line was almost useless, as nearly all trains called at the main (Upper) station to make connections. The Lower station was closed and a short platform, &quot;Templecombe Lower Platform&quot;, was provided on the west side of the main line, adjacent to the main road. There were no facilities on it, and only the last train from Bournemouth and certain other very early or late trains used it.

==== Bournemouth reached at last ====
In the first half of the 19th century, Bournemouth was an insignificant hamlet, and when a railway from London to Dorchester was being planned, no importance was attached to the coastal area. Later as the town grew many of its wealthier inhabitants blocked the coming of the railway as they felt it would spoil the exclusivity of the town by allowing access to tourists from all classes. Accordingly, the railway from Southampton to Dorchester cut inland to pass through the important towns of Ringwood and Wimborne. There was a branch to the west of Holes Bay from Poole Junction (now Hamworthy) to a station called Poole, situated to the west of the bridge over the inlet. This was the &quot;Poole&quot; station that Somerset &amp; Dorset trains reached over LSWR tracks, reversing at Wimborne.

This was inconvenient for the town of Poole, and the LSWR interest built a railway to reach Poole itself from Broadstone, opening on 2 December 1872, and through a daughter company from Poole to Bournemouth on 15 June 1874. The Bournemouth station eventually became Bournemouth West. Somerset &amp; Dorset trains transferred from the Hamworthy station to the new Poole station immediately, and extended to Bournemouth as soon as the extension was opened. They still had to reverse at Wimborne, as the Corfe Mullen connection did not materialise until 1885.

==== The Bath extension ====

In earlier times the port and industrial centre of Bristol had been the northerly magnet, but in the intervening years other railways had interposed themselves. But the Midland Railway&#x27;s Mangotsfield and Bath Branch Line had reached Bath in 1869, so the S&amp;DR decided to head for that destination. This had the advantage also of crossing the Somerset Coalfield.

An act of Parliament was obtained on 21 August 1871 which included running powers for the last half mile into Bath over the Midland&#x27;s line, and the use of their Bath station at Queen Square. The terrain was quite different from the previous ground covered, and engineers had to build many tunnels and viaducts. The line was steep, with a ruling gradient of 1 in 50. The summit, in the Mendip Hills, was 811 feet above sea level. (247 m). From Radstock to Midford the railway followed the route of the Radstock branch of the Somerset Coal Canal which was little used and had been replaced by a tramway on the canal&#x27;s towpath in 1815. The S&amp;DR purchased the waterway, filled in the canal, removed the tramway and built its railway along the route. This greatly reduced the cost and time of construction and provided a mostly level course, but forced the railway to follow the sharply-curved course of the original canal.
Completion was swift, despite a break in construction when a contractor had financial problems. It opened on 20 July 1874.

There were four passenger trains each way every day; two of them carried through coaches from Birmingham to Bournemouth.

Intermediate stations were at Wellow, Radstock, Chilcompton, Binegar, Masbury, Shepton Mallet and Evercreech New. The original Evercreech station was renamed Evercreech Junction.

=== Financial exhaustion and lease ===
The completion of the line to Bath brought a further massive traffic increase, but the financial burden of the loans taken to build the Bath extension weighed the little company down even more, and it soon became clear that even day-to-day operating expenses could not be met. Atthill describes the Bath extension project as an act of financial suicide.

The company realised that the game was up, and sought purchasers. The GWR and the B&amp;ER were obvious candidates, but in August 1875 a 999-year lease was abruptly agreed jointly to the Midland Railway and the LSWR (the two railways whose networks it joined at either end), and this was confirmed by act of Parliament, the (39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. cxv) on 13 July 1876.

The purchase price was generous, being calculated by the Midland and LSWR as much to exclude the GWR and B&amp;ER from Bournemouth as anything else, and the rental income enabled the S&amp;DR company to pay its shareholders %, a considerable income in those years of very low inflation.

The railway route was now the Somerset &amp; Dorset Joint Railway.

=== The Joint Committee ===
With the lease to two very powerful companies, the operation of the Joint Line (as it was now called) would no longer be hampered by shortage of money. The Midland Railway and the LSWR set up a joint committee, and divided up responsibilities so that the Midland was in charge of motive power, and the LSWR provided the infrastructure and rolling stock.

The serious accident at Foxcote, near Radstock took place on 7 August 1876, within a month of the formal takeover of responsibilities, and must have brought home to the parent companies the urgency of their intervening to bring things into good order. Operation of the complex stretches of single line had been done by Absolute Block working, but without any form of physical train staff (supplemented by telegraphic train orders issued from an office at Glastonbury), so the LSWR set about replacing this by the Electric Train Tablet method of single-line control.

Aside from that, the new management consolidated the links with mineral extraction interests near the line.

At Wells, two other railways, originally independent, had approached the S&amp;D station there (Priory Road). The East Somerset line from Witham led in from the east, and had a station opposite the S&amp;D station. The Bristol &amp; Exeter operated branch from to a station in Wells at Tucker Street. The S&amp;D station sat exactly between them and while these railways remained broad gauge, connecting them, a connection was difficult. Eventually they were absorbed by the GWR, and then converted to standard gauge, and on 1 January 1878 a through connection was made, so that goods traffic exchange was now possible, and GWR passenger trains could run throughout from Yatton to Witham, through the S&amp;D station. They did not make calls there until 1 October 1934, and ceased to do so when the S&amp;D Wells branch closed in 1951.

The main line transit from Bath to Bournemouth was still hampered by the necessity of reversing at Wimborne, and the joint companies built a new cut-off line from Bailey Gate, through the station in Corfe Mullen and the hamlet of Ashington, to what became Broadstone station. The new line ran alongside the Wimborne line for the first two miles to Corfe Mullen and the cut-off carried its first goods traffic on 14 December 1885, and was fully brought into use on 1 November 1886. It is not clear why the ten-month delay took place, but it may be connected with objections from the town of Wimborne at the obvious loss of train services.

In 1889 and 1891 the Midland Railway and the LSWR bought out nearly all of the stock of the original S&amp;D shareholders, so that they finally became joint owners of the line.

=== Bridgwater joins the S&amp;D ===
The original Somerset Central Railway company had considered the important town of Bridgwater as its western terminus, but had decided that the difficulties of constructing a route were too great. However the Bridgwater Railway Company made the connection from Edington Road, renamed Edington Junction, to Bridgwater, opening the seven mile line on 21 July 1890; there was one intermediate station at Cossington and a Halt at Bawdrip. From that time, there was a viable passenger transit from Bridgwater to London via Templecombe, in competition with the GWR route via Bristol.

The nominally independent Bridgwater Railway had a working arrangement with the LSWR and the line was operated from the outset by the S&amp;D. After the 1 January 1923 Grouping ownership of the line passed to the Southern Railway.

=== Working of single line ===
From the late 1870s a number of the single line sections were made double track, to improve handling of the heavy train service, and by 1905 about two-thirds of the main line mileage was double track, and trains could now run throughout from Bath to Bournemouth with reasonable convenience, excepting only the awkward arrangement at Templecombe. Southbound trains calling there (to make connection into the LSWR Exeter main line) had to be hauled back to the S&amp;D junction by a spare engine, then to continue their southward journey; the corresponding evolution in reverse was necessary for northbound trains. This complexity persisted until the final closure of the S&amp;D line.

However the remaining single line sections proved a serious delaying factor for the traffic. Safety on single line sections was secured by every train carrying a token for each single line; instruments at the signal boxes were electrically interlocked to ensure that only one token could be out of the instruments for any one section at a time. The tokens had to be handed to the driver of every train by the signalman, and in the case of express trains, this meant slowing to walking pace to secure the handover.

Alfred Whitaker, the S&amp;D locomotive engineer, developed a mechanical apparatus; part of this fitted to the locomotive cabside consisted of jaws which caught a loop on a pouch containing the token; the pouch was held at the lineside in a special delivery holder. The token to be given up by the train was correspondingly caught by a catcher fixed at the lineside.

This system enabled token exchanges to take place at 40 mph, and considerably accelerated the handling of through trains at single line crossing places.

The main line was single from Bath Junction to Midford (inclusive), from Templecombe Junction to Blandford with crossing places at Stalbridge, Sturminster Newton, Shillingstone and Stourpaine, and from Corfe Mullen to both Wimborne Junction and Broadstone Junction.

=== Locomotives and rolling stock ===

Locomotive and rolling stock on the Somerset and Dorset was largely defined by those running the line, the 5 main phases were:
* Somerset and Dorset, 1863–1875
* S&amp;DJR – Midland Railway and LSWR, 1875 – 1923
* Post grouping – LMS and Southern Railway (SR), 1923–1948
* Nationalisation – British Rail Southern Region, 1948–1958
* Nationalisation – British Rail Western Region (north of Templecombe) and Southern region (south of Templecombe), 1958–1966

The early locomotive fleet was bought in from suppliers, and as the company was always in financial difficulties, the stock was never to the highest specification.

The company had its own Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon works at Highbridge. This closed in 1930 and the locomotives were transferred to the control of the LMS.

Things improved considerably when the Joint ownership started, and the Midland Railway provided more powerful and reliable traction. Even so, the Midland Railway&#x27;s policy of building small engines was spectacularly unsuitable for the heavy gradients and heavy loads of the S&amp;D.

For many years, right up to 1959, a Midland design of 4-4-0 Class 2P was the mainstay of the express passenger traffic, with variations of 3F 0-6-0 freight tender engine and 0-6-0T tank engines. A revolutionary change took place when the Midland built a small fleet of 2-8-0 tender engines to handle the heaviest freight trains—the unique S&amp;DJR 7F 2-8-0 series—with Walschaerts valve gear and the greatest tractive effort ever delivered by a Derby locomotive, with the exception of the &quot;Lickey Banker&quot; 0-10-0.

After nationalisation in 1948 the Southern Region Battle of Britain and West Country 4-6-2 locomotives were a common sight. The heavier Merchant Navy 4-6-2 was not used on the line.

In the final few years, GWR Collett 0-6-0 tender locomotives in the 22XX class handled all of the Highbridge branch work, and LMS standard Jinty types dealt with the shunting duties. The LMS 4F 0-6-0 tender locomotives worked some trains down from Bath—they were commonplace on the Bath to Bristol services—and the Western Region drafted in green liveried Standard Class 5 4-6-0s in the 73XXX series, with BR Standard Class 4 4-6-0 75XXX 4-6-0 locomotives working from the Bournemouth end. The 7F 2-8-0s were pressed into passenger service in summer.

Some standard tanks classes operated on the line, the most powerful being the Standard Class 4 2-6-4T in the 80XXX series; these had one disadvantage, in that the water tanks extended along the cabside and this prevented the fitting of the Whitaker tablet exchange mechanism there.

In the early 1960s (1960 to 1963, to be exact) a small fleet of Standard Class 9F 2-10-0 locomotives were transferred to the line for the duration of the summer timetable period (roughly June to September) to work on the heaviest passenger trains. They included (in 1962) No. 92220 &quot;Evening Star&quot;, the last steam engine to be built by British Railways. These locomotives proved ideal for the S&amp;D, delivering considerable power, good steaming, and high adhesion. These heavy freight locomotives had relatively small wheels, and were not designed to run with passenger trains, but with the &quot;Pines Express&quot; they were easily able to reach, and perhaps exceed, the 70 mph line speed limit on the better, downhill parts of the route. After a review of the velocities of the reciprocating masses and coupling rods, a 60 mph maximum speed was urgently imposed.

Diesel multiple units were trialled on the route about 1959 when dieselisation of branch lines was in full swing elsewhere, but their relatively low power made them impractical for the steeply graded route.

=== Service in 1938 ===

The S&amp;D&#x27;s domestic train service was not fast, and except on summer Saturdays, there were a handful of stopping services, several of them running from Bath to Templecombe and from Templecombe to Bournemouth separately, and even the through stopping trains waited for some time at Templecombe. Some trains ran from Highbridge to Templecombe, and a few of the trains started from Bristol, reversing at Bath. (All these comments apply &quot;and vice versa&quot; wherever appropriate.)

The 1938 Bradshaw gives a good snapshot of the train service:

Stopping trains took the best part of four hours for the Bath to Bournemouth journey. In July 1938 stopping trains left Bath Queen Square at
* 06:50 (Bristol Temple Meads] to Bournemouth)
* 08:30 (to Templecombe)
* 09:20 (Bristol Temple Meads to Bournemouth fast, 2 hours 35 minutes Bath to Bournemouth)
* 10:20 via Bristol Temple Meads to Bournemouth semi-fast, 2 hours 35 minutes Bath to Bournemouth)
* 13:10 (to Templecombe)
* 14:50 (to Templecombe; 15:00 on Saturdays)
* 17:05 (to Templecombe)
* 18:35 (to Bournemouth)
* 21:00 (to Evercreech Junction, continuing to Wincanton on Wednesdays and Templecombe on Saturdays)
* 23:00 to Midsomer Norton

The last train of the day from Bournemouth to Templecombe terminated there at the lower platform instead of reversing into the Upper station. A summer Sunday evening train started from the Lower Platform and ran to Bournemouth Central, but there were only one or two trains on Sundays.

The connections at Templecombe were poor, and this probably reflects timetable improvements over the years on the Waterloo – Salisbury – Exeter line that were not supported by S&amp;D connectional arrangements. The early possibility of making a fast Bridgwater to Waterloo journey via Templecombe had vanished by 1938.

Summer Saturdays increased this traffic immensely over the domestic business; holidaymakers returning home wanted to leave Bournemouth in the morning, but the southbound arrivals travelled later in the day (having left northern towns in the morning).

There were thirteen long-distance trains handled over the S&amp;D, all but one of them with Bournemouth as their southern terminal. The exception ran to Sidmouth and Exmouth, leaving the S&amp;D at Templecombe; in later years it ran from Cleethorpes, forming an interesting coast-to-coast service. The holiday trains otherwise avoided Templecombe, and many ran non-stop from Bath to Poole taking two and a half hours from Bath to Bournemouth. The northern terminals were mainly on the former Midland Railway system, with Bradford in the lead, although the &quot;Pines Express&quot; ran to and from Manchester. Two southbound trains and one northbound train started on Friday night and ran through the small hours.

==== Branch lines ====
Six trains a day ran on the Highbridge line from Burnham-on-Sea to Evercreech Junction taking about 70 minutes for the 24 miles – two morning trains continued to Templecombe. A seventh train ran as the last of the day from Burnham-on-Sea to Wells, and the first train of the day in the reverse direction also ran from Wells to Burnham-on-Sea. In addition there were eleven daily trains in summer between Highbridge and Burnham-on-Sea only.

The Wells to Glastonbury line saw six trains each way daily, and the Bridgwater branch had eight trains each way (plus one Wednesdays only down train) daily. These more or less connected with trains for Evercreech at Edington Junction.

=== Closures ===

The line began to decline in use from the 1950s onwards. In 1951, the branch from Glastonbury to Wells was closed. In December 1952, passenger services were withdrawn on the branch from Edington Junction to Bridgwater (Edington Junction being renamed &#x27;Edington Burtle&#x27;); followed by closure of the branch on 1 October 1954. The short section of branch-line from Highbridge to Burnham-on-Sea closed to regular services in 1951, though through specials continued to use the line until September 1962. Highbridge was the new branch terminus and was renamed several times, becoming: Highbridge &amp; Burnham-on-Sea. In 1956 four of the smaller stations on the Dorset section of the main line were closed as an economy measure.

In 1958 management of the line north of Templecombe was transferred from the Southern Region of British Railways to the Western Region of British Railways. In the five years after this, through trains from the north and the Midlands were diverted to other routes, notably the daily &quot;Pines Express&quot;, which was re-routed after the end of the summer timetable in 1962.

In Summer 1962, John Betjeman (before his knighthood) visited the Somerset and Dorset to make a short BBC documentary, entitled &quot;Branch Line Railway&quot;, first broadcast in March 1963. Starting at Evercreech Junction, Betjeman travelled the 24-mile stretch to Highbridge and Burnham-on-Sea, making a plea for this branch line to be spared by Dr. Beeching. The black-and-white film was issued on video by BBC Enterprises in 1987.

A further small closure affecting the S&amp;D in 1965 of the Bournemouth West terminus station saw S&amp;D trains in the last months starting from and ending at Bournemouth Central.

Despite the Labour government elected in 1964 promising no further major railway cutbacks, an active campaign to save the line was lost when on 6 September 1965, the closure consent covering most of the S&amp;D and the line to Bristol via Mangotsfield was issued. Tom Fraser was the Minister of Transport at the time. That consent was followed by another for Broadstone station and Creekmoor Halt as these stops had also been served by another passenger service, though that had already been withdrawn.

Closure scheduled for 3 January 1966 was deferred when one of the road operators withdrew his application for a licence to provide some of the alternative road services, and an emergency service was introduced on that date instead. This reduced the number of trains departing Bath to four a day (06:45, 08:15, 16:25 and 18:10), and two a day (06:55 and 16:00) from Highbridge. There were no through trains other than the 18:46 from Bournemouth Central on Saturdays, with journeys being broken at Templecombe and no suitable connections provided. There were no services on Sundays. Finally, on 7 March 1966 the whole S&amp;D line from Bath to Bournemouth – and also the Evercreech Junction to Highbridge line – was closed under the Beeching Axe and dismantled. Three short sections survived:
* Blandford Station remained open for freight only, accessed by a branch from Broadstone until 1969.
* A section from the GWR main line at Highbridge to Bason Bridge remained opened to allow milk trains to access the United Dairies creamery. In the months before closure, goods trains loaded with fly ash tipped at the construction site of the M5 motorway to enable it to progress across the Somerset Levels. Progress on construction of the motorway finally closed the spur on 3 October 1972.
* After the decision to close the S&amp;DJR in 1966, a connection was made to the west of with the GWR main line. This allowed trains on the former GWR Bristol and North Somerset Railway to traverse a short spur through Radstock North to Lower Writhlington Colliery, Braysdown Colliery and Writhlington Colliery, to transport coal to Portishead power station. After the last coal from the Somerset Coalfield was extracted from Writhlington Colliery on 28 September 1973, the spur was dismantled

== Accidents ==
* Foxcote (Radstock) collision, 1876
* On 13 April 1914, a passenger train hauled by locomotive No. 52 was derailed at .
* Bath goods yard 20 November 1929 3.25. An S &amp; D locomotive 2-8-0 no 89 ran out of control from the Combe Down tunnel when the crew were overcome by fumes. The loco crashed into the goods yard at Green Park Station killing the driver and two others.
* Braysdown Accident. On 29 July 1936, the crew of an empty colliery wagon train at Foxcote mistakenly abandoned their engine. The wagons were derailed, but no one injured.
* On 19 August 1949, a British Railways passenger train from Highbridge collided with an Eclipse narrow gauge diesel locomotive crossing on the level and left the track, ending up in the Glastonbury Canal. From 1922 onwards, the Eclipse Peat Works industrial tramway had a level crossing on the SD&amp;JR Burnham-on-Sea branch, west of Ashcott railway station. The collision occurred when the tram locomotive stalled on the Eclipse level crossing on the SD&amp;JR branch further towards Glastonbury. The locomotive was cut up into pieces and removed.

== Restoration, renovation and preservation ==

Sections of the line are being restored. These include:

=== Somerset &amp; Dorset Railway Heritage Trust ===
The Somerset &amp; Dorset Railway Heritage Trust is based at Midsomer Norton South station. It operates a one-mile section of line on the original trackbed heading south from Midsomer Norton towards Chilcompton. Public trains ran every two weeks in 2019.

===The North Dorset Railway ===
The North Dorset Railway (formerly the Shillingstone Railway Project) is based at Shillingstone railway station. This heritage railway attraction intends to run standard gauge trains and aims to restore the line between the sites of Sturminster Newton and Stourpaine and Durweston as well.

=== Gartell Light Railway ===
There is also a narrow gauge line south of Templecombe – the Gartell Light Railway – which uses a short section of S&amp;D trackbed, with a planned extension northwards to Templecombe.

=== Somerset and Dorset Railway Trust ===
The Trust was originally set up as the Somerset &amp; Dorset Circle in late 1965 - before the line closed. In 1970, the Trust acquired S&amp;D 7F locomotive No. 53808 from Woodham Brothers&#x27; Barry Scrapyard. The locomotive returned to steam in 1987. At on the West Somerset Railway the Somerset and Dorset Railway Trust operated a museum of historical items and rolling stock originating from the S&amp;D. As of summer 2021, the stock and artefacts are being relocated owing to the Trust having been served with a Notice to Quit the site in February 2020.

=== The New Somerset and Dorset Railway ===
A group called the New Somerset and Dorset Railway, has been set up with the aim of restoring the line between Bournemouth and Bath, along with key branch lines, as a commercially viable railway running freight and commuter services (with provision for heritage services too). The group was formed 6 March 2009 as a reaction to climate change, peak oil, capacity restraints on the existing railway network and inefficiency in other forms of transport. Their intention is to buy up stretches of trackbed and buildings, as well as lobbying local and national government and encouraging restoration work along the line. They aim to present a document &#x27;The Case for a New S&amp;D&#x27; soon. The first step is the purchase of the site of Midford station, and restore it for use as an information office and operating base, although track will be re-laid (possibly towards Wellow) as part of the route reopening.
The New S&amp;D also started restoring Spetisbury station in Dorset in cooperation with Dorset County Council; this was to echo the role of Midford but with the addition of refreshment facilities. However, the Spetisbury group is now independent, see below.

=== Non-railway use preservation ===

Bath Green Park station has been fully preserved. With road access gained over the former railway bridges, in the former goods yard and approach roads Sainsbury&#x27;s have developed a supermarket, while the main train shed houses a series of small businesses and a twice-weekly market.

A short section of the former railway forms the North Dorset Trailway, a multi-use rail trail. The trail currently extends from Sturminster Newton to Spetisbury with plans to continue a further 5km northwest to Stalbridge.

==== Two Tunnels Greenway ====
The section from Bath Green Park to Midford was bought and retained by Bath Council as part of their Two Tunnels Greenway. Under the management of Sustrans, who input £1M of the £1.9M project cost, the scheme provides a dual walking and cycle path from the centre of Bath to Midford, where it intersects with National Cycle Route 24. In July 2010, the council transferred the care of the Devonshire and Combe Down Tunnels to Sustrans. The section was opened on 6 April 2013.

==== Spetisbury Station Project ====
This is a Community Interest Company (CIC) which has been clearing and improving the station site at Spetisbury, Dorset,with a long-term objective of creating a small railway heritage centre. Originally part of the &#x27;New S&amp;D&#x27; referred to above, the group subsequently became independent.

==== Glastonbury Festival ====
The trackbed from Steanbow Crossing to Cock Mill Crossing, between the sites of Pylle and West Pennard stations, crosses the site of the Glastonbury Festival and functions as an internal road within the festival site. There are gates at both points where it crosses the perimeter fence.

==== Maesbury Railway Cutting ====
Maesbury Railway Cutting between East Horrington and Gurney Slade is a Geological Conservation Review site because it exposes approximately of strata representing the middle and upper Lower Limestone Shales and the basal Black Rock Limestone. Both formations are of early Carboniferous (Courceyan) age.

== Preserved S&amp;DJR locomotives ==
Neither of the S&amp;DJR Sentinels has been preserved but a similar locomotive is operational at Midsomer Norton railway station.

=== Preserved rolling stock ===

Four ex-S&amp;DJR carriages have survived:
* No. 4 six-wheel first, built in 1886, is preserved at Washford on the West Somerset Railway and is currently operational in S&amp;DJR livery and owned by Somerset &amp; Dorset Railway Trust. It was grounded at Templecombe and was preserved from the site in 1986.
* Two other six-wheel carriages are preserved by the Somerset &amp; Dorset Railway Trust on the West Somerset Railway;
** No. 98 third, built in 1894 and No. 114 third are both preserved in an unrestored condition, both in original S&amp;DJR livery and with original lettering too.
* Section of a four-wheel passenger brake has also been preserved by the Somerset &amp; Dorset Railway Trust.
* No. 2 four-wheel first, was grounded at West Huntspill but was broken up by the Somerset and Dorset Railway Trust for spares around March 1994.
* No . 9 Brake Van, was in a field at Highbridge and was recovered by the SDRT around October 2001, it was faintly marked &#x27;Wells Branch&#x27;, &#x27;S D J R&#x27; and &#x27;No 9&#x27;.

<text>Sikth (also typeset as SikTh) are a British progressive metal band from Watford, Hertfordshire, formed in 1999.

==History==
===Early days (1999–2002)===
Sikth formed in late 1999, but consolidated their line-up in March 2001. That line-up consisted of dual vocalists Mikee Goodman and Justin Hill, guitarists Dan Weller and Graham Pinney, bassist James Leach and drummer/percussionist Dan Foord.

Their first official release was an EP titled &quot;Let the Transmitting Begin&quot;. Released in 2002, it featured three tracks, as well as a limited edition live CD from the BBC Radio 1 recordings of the same songs.

The band&#x27;s first release for Gut Records was an EP titled &quot;How May I Help You?&quot; Released in 2002, it featured three tracks, two of which were on the band&#x27;s debut album. A video for the song &quot;(If You Weren&#x27;t So) Perfect&quot; was also contained. The song &quot;How May I Help You?&quot; contained a story about a person called Rodney. The song was made into an animated video, which was written, directed and produced by Mikee Goodman. It went on to win the best video award in The Big Cheese Magazine, as well as reaching number 1 on MTV UK, and being an A-list video on MTV Asia.

===Debut album (2003–2005)===
Sikth&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Trees Are Dead &amp; Dried Out Wait for Something Wild&quot; was released on 18 August 2003 through Gut Records. The album was produced by the band themselves, along with Andrew Scarth. Mixing duties were handled by Colin Richardson. Two singles were released from the album in &quot;Scent of the Obscene&quot; (October) and &quot;Peep Show&quot; (December). The album has sold approximately 30,000 copies in the UK, Japan and Australia.

In support of the album, Sikth performed at Download Festival at Donington Park in 2003. The band subsequently travelled to Japan in 2004, firstly supporting Anthrax and Killswitch Engage, then playing at the Fuji Rock Festival in August with Lou Reed, PJ Harvey and Primus. Also in 2004, the band made an appearance at the debut Fuse Leeds festival of cross-disciplinary New Music, at the personal invitation of festival curator Django Bates (they played a support slot to Bates&#x27; own jazz ensemble on the closing night of the festival).

===Second album (2006–2007)===
The band returned in 2006 with their second full-length album &quot;Death of a Dead Day&quot;. It was released in the UK on 26 June 2006 on their new label Bieler Bros. Records. It was earlier released in the US on 6 June. The album entered the UK album charts at number 94. The album was once again produced by the band themselves, with mixing duties handled by Matt Plant.

In support of the album, Sikth performed a show at The White Horse in High Wycombe, the venue of their first ever gig, on 6 June 2006 and at the Download Festival 2006 four days later, as well as short UK tour.

An EP titled &quot;Flogging the Horses&quot; was released in October 2006, featuring demo versions from &quot;Death of a Dead Day&quot; tracks, as well as a remix version of &quot;Where Do We Fall?&quot;. The track &quot;Each Other and Ourselves&quot; was also included, which was a bonus track on the Japanese version of the album. The EP was limited to just 1,500 copies.

===Departure of vocalists and hiatus (2007–2013)===
On 8 May 2007, it was announced that vocalists Mikee Goodman and Justin Hill would be leaving the band at the conclusion of the July 2007 &quot;The Black Summer Starts Here&quot; UK tour set, due to their ongoing projects and producing careers. Mikee Goodman&#x27;s and Justin Hill&#x27;s final performance in SikTh was at the Carling Academy, Islington, London on 14 September 2007 (this was a rescheduled show).

On 27 May 2008, Sikth announced that the band had decided to split due to numerous factors. The main reasons cited for their break-up was the inability to find a replacement for Mikee and Justin, as well as commitment to other projects.

On 15 January 2012, an official Sikth Facebook Page was created by the band in order to reissue and sell Sikth merchandise. The band also stated that when they do reform, it will not be &quot;for the wrong reasons&quot; and that &quot;we owe it to our fans to produce something very special when we return.&quot;

===Reunion (2014–present)===
On 16 December 2013 it was revealed in a surprise announcement that Sikth were to be playing a reunion set at Download Festival 2014, headlining the Red Bull stage. This was the band&#x27;s first live performance since 2007 and their first appearance at Download Festival since 2006. On 25 March, they were also announced to be headlining October&#x27;s Euroblast festival in Cologne, Germany. On 13 June 2014, Sikth announced a full autumn UK tour via their Facebook page running through October and November. Sikth have also been announced to play UK Tech-Metal Festival as the main headliner on 14 June 2014. They were also main headliner of Silence Festival V in Nepal 17–18 October 2014,sharing same stage where Enigmatik, Vader, Textures and Behemoth had headlined before.

On 27 April 2015 Sikth announced via their Facebook page that they are planning to release new music in the form of a crowd funded EP with a tour to follow. Fans who pre-ordered the EP were able to visit the pledgemusic page and gain access to exclusive updates, content and merchandise for the duration of the funding campaign. The six track EP, titled Opacities, was released on 4 December 2015. Sikth were also the opening act for Slipknot on their 2016 U.K tour in February alongside Suicidal Tendencies. They were announced to be performing the Arctangent Festival in August 2016, but later pulled out. They appeared in 2017.

On 3 June 2016 Justin Hill announced his retirement in order to focus on his production career. Joe Rosser from Pin&#x27;s second band Aliases was announced as his replacement.

The band will be in the UK in September for their &quot;Riddles of Humanity&quot; tour and will feature Loathe as their support act in September 2018. Their final show of the year was at Festivile on 20 October 2018, it was also at this show where frontman Mikee Goodman said that &quot;This will be the last show we&#x27;ll do for a while&quot; he also stated he is unsure if they will return soon and if new music will be made.

Sometime between 2019 and 2021, Joe Rosser departed the band to pursue other musical endeavours, in late 2022 the band announced that Justin Hill would rejoin the band for a set of anniversary shows in November 2022, at the Manchester date of the show the band brought out Joe Rosser for the songs &quot;Sanguine Seas of Bigotry&quot; and &quot;Bland Street Bloom&quot; as a thank you to his tenure in the band when Justin departed.

==Musical style==
Sikth&#x27;s style of music is hard to categorise as they incorporate many different elements of metal, rock and hardcore. They are commonly categorised as progressive metal due to their unorthodox approach, as well as avant-garde metal and mathcore due to the complex nature of their instrumental playing abilities and the regular inclusion of dissonance into their music.

According to guitarist Dan Weller;

&quot;Energy has always inspired us, things that really get you pumping. We play extreme music, sure, but in the sense that we go to all extremes. If something sounds good, then we&#x27;ll do it, and that includes beautiful, melodic music, which we all love, too&quot;.

According to guitarist Pin;

&quot;But we&#x27;re always concerned with the quality of the tune; just writing crazy music isn&#x27;t enough, and I think that&#x27;s what makes us different from other bands who go really technical. We&#x27;re definitely writing songs.&quot;

In a review for Sikth&#x27;s second album &quot;Death of a Dead Day&quot;, DecoyMusic.com described the band&#x27;s style as containing elements of &quot;speed metal, progressive metal, thrash, nu metal, metalcore, and cock-rock&quot;. The website Drowned in Sound &quot;sees the band come across like a heady America-friendly mix of Dillinger Escape Plan&#x27;s feather-fingered guitar contorting melded with Korn&#x27;s manipulated rhythms, thundering through the bizarre nuances of System of a Down&quot;.

In a review for the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Trees Are Dead &amp; Dried Out Wait for Something Wild&quot;, MusicOMH.com described the album as containing &quot;guttural throaty vocals mixed with harmonized melodies, viciously rhythmic drumming which instantly metamorphosises into elaborate percussion, and haunting atmospheric piano interludes which sit superbly between slices of metal brutality&quot;. In the early days of the band, Goodman once described their sound as &quot;scatcore&quot;, a reference to their fast-jabbering scat style of singing.

<doc id="1068626" wikidata="Q2223927" url="?curid=1068626" title="Hilton, Dorset">
<text>Hilton is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England. It is sited at an elevation of in a small valley which drains chalk hills in the eastern part of the Dorset Downs, approximately west-southwest of the town of Blandford Forum. The summit of Bulbarrow Hill () is north of the village. In the 2011 census the parish—which includes the settlement of Ansty to the west—had 231 dwellings, 206 households and a population of 477.

Hilton used to form a part of the estate of the nearby Milton Abbey when it was owned by the rich Hambro family; the Hambros, who often used to entertain Edward VII, planted woods on the surrounding hills, to provide cover for pheasants. However the woods surrounding Hilton today are mostly post-war plantations of beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;) and ash (&quot;Fraxinus excelsior&quot;) as the hills were cleared during WW2. Large areas are privately owned, although there are open access areas owned and managed by the Forestry Commission.
The church of All Saints is a typical Dorset country church and is mainly in the late Gothic style. In the north aisle a fine range of windows from the cloisters of Milton Abbey have been reused. The fan vault in the porch probably comes from the same source. Also from the abbey are a set of 12 panels with paintings of the Apostles: these are of high quality and early 16th century in date.

In 1870–72, John Marius Wilson&#x27;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Hilton like this:

<doc id="1068627" wikidata="Q244040" url="?curid=1068627" title="Tyndall effect">
<text>The Tyndall effect is light scattering by particles in a colloid such as a very fine suspension (a sol). Also known as Tyndall scattering, it is similar to Rayleigh scattering, in that the intensity of the scattered light is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength, so blue light is scattered much more strongly than red light. An example in everyday life is the blue colour sometimes seen in the smoke emitted by motorcycles, in particular two-stroke machines where the burnt engine oil provides these particles. The same effect can also be observed with tobacco smoke whose fine particles also preferentially scatter blue light. 

Under the Tyndall effect, the longer wavelengths are transmitted more, while the shorter wavelengths are more diffusely reflected via scattering. The Tyndall effect is seen when light-scattering particulate matter is dispersed in an otherwise light-transmitting medium, where the diameter of an individual particle is in the range of roughly 40 to 900 nm, i.e. somewhat below or near the wavelengths of visible light (400–750 nm).

It is particularly applicable to colloidal mixtures; for example, the Tyndall effect is used in nephelometers to determine the size and density of particles in aerosols and other colloidal matter. Investigation of the phenomenon led directly to the invention of the ultramicroscope and turbidimetry.

It is named after the 19th-century physicist John Tyndall, who first studied the phenomenon extensively.

== History ==
Prior to his discovery of the phenomenon, Tyndall was primarily known for his work on the absorption and emission of radiant heat on a molecular level. In his investigations in that area, it had become necessary to use air from which all traces of floating dust and other particulates had been removed, and the best way to detect these particulates was to bathe the air in intense light. In the 1860s, Tyndall did a number of experiments with light, shining beams through various gases and liquids and recording the results. In doing so, Tyndall discovered that when gradually filling the tube with smoke and then shining a beam of light through it, the beam appeared to be blue from the sides of the tube but red from the far end. This observation enabled Tyndall to first propose the phenomenon which would later bear his name.

In 1902, the ultramicroscope was developed by Richard Adolf Zsigmondy (1865–1929) and Henry Siedentopf (1872–1940), working for Carl Zeiss AG. Curiosity about the Tyndall effect led them to apply bright sunlight for illumination and they were able to determine the size of 4 nm small gold nanoparticles that generate the cranberry glass colour. This work led directly to Zsigmondy&#x27;s Nobel Prize for chemistry.

== Comparison with Rayleigh scattering ==
Rayleigh scattering is defined by a mathematical formula that requires the light-scattering particles to be far smaller than the wavelength of the light. For a dispersion of particles to qualify for the Rayleigh formula, the particle sizes need to be below roughly 40 nanometres (for visible light), and the particles may be individual molecules. Colloidal particles are bigger and are in the rough vicinity of the size of a wavelength of light. Tyndall scattering, i.e. colloidal particle scattering, is much more intense than Rayleigh scattering due to the bigger particle sizes involved. The importance of the particle size factor for intensity can be seen in the large exponent it has in the mathematical statement of the intensity of Rayleigh scattering. If the colloid particles are spheroid, Tyndall scattering can be mathematically analyzed in terms of Mie theory, which admits particle sizes in the rough vicinity of the wavelength of light. Light scattering by particles of complex shape are described by the T-matrix method.

== Blue irises ==
The color of blue eyes is due to the Tyndall scattering of light by a translucent layer of turbid media in the iris containing numerous small particles of about 0.6 micrometers in diameter. These particles are finely suspended within the fibrovascular structure of the stroma or front layer of the iris. Some brown irises have the same layer, except with more melanin in it. Moderate amounts of melanin make hazel, dark blue and green eyes.

In eyes that contain both particles and melanin, melanin absorbs light. In the absence of melanin, the layer is translucent (i.e. the light passing through is randomly and diffusely scattered by the particles) and a noticeable portion of the light that enters this translucent layer re-emerges via a radial scattered path. That is, there is backscatter, the redirection of the light waves back out to the open air.

Scattering takes place to a greater extent at shorter wavelengths. The longer wavelengths tend to pass straight through the translucent layer with unaltered paths of yellow light, and then encounter the next layer further back in the iris, which is a light absorber called the epithelium or uvea that is colored brownish-black. The brightness or intensity of scattered blue light that is scattered by the particles is due to this layer along with the turbid medium of particles within the stroma.

Thus, the longer wavelengths are not reflected (by scattering) back to the open air as much as the shorter wavelengths. Because the shorter wavelengths are the blue wavelengths, this gives rise to a blue hue in the light that comes out of the eye. The blue iris is an example of a structural color because it relies only on the interference of light through the turbid medium to generate the color.

Blue eyes and brown eyes, therefore, are anatomically different from each other in a genetically non-variable way because of the difference between turbid media and melanin. Both kinds of eye color can remain functionally separate despite being &quot;mixed&quot; together.

== Similar phenomena different from Tyndall scattering ==
When the day&#x27;s sky is overcast, sunlight passes through the turbidity layer of the clouds, resulting in scattered, diffuse light on the ground (sunbeam). This exhibits Mie scattering instead of Tyndall scattering because the cloud droplets are larger than the wavelength of the light and scatters all colors approximately equally. When the daytime sky is cloudless, the sky&#x27;s color is blue due to Rayleigh scattering instead of Tyndall scattering because the scattering particles are the air molecules, which are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light. Similarly, the term &quot;Tyndall effect&quot; is incorrectly applied to light scattering by large, macroscopic dust particles in the air as due to their large size, they do not exhibit Tyndall scattering.

<text>Pelephone (, , lit. &quot;miracle phone&quot;) is a mobile network operator in Israel, and also the first company to offer mobile telephony services in Israel. Due to this, the brand-name &quot;Pelephone&quot; became the genericized trademark for mobile phones in Israel, regardless of service provider. The company is a subsidiary of the Israeli telecommunications conglomerate Bezeq, which is also the principal provider of fixed-line telephone service in the country. As of June 2016 Pelephone had 2.26 million wireless subscribers.

==History==
Pelephone was founded as a company in 1985 as a joint venture between Motorola and Tadiran, after Motorola was awarded the contract to build Israel&#x27;s first mobile phone network in November 1983. Pelephone began operations of its mobile phone network in March 1986. Pelephone&#x27;s first television commercial featured Israeli actor Hanan Goldblatt using his car phone to buy and sell shares via a stockbroker while driving at the same time. Pelephone&#x27;s first CEO was Benny Epstein, who served in that position until 1994.

In 1994, Bezeq acquired 50% ownership of Pelephone, and in 2004 acquired full ownership of the company from its co-owner Motorola.

In December 2011 Pelephone became the host network of &quot;Rami Levy Communications&quot;, the first MVNO to begin operating in Israel. As of 2012, Pelephone states that it has 4,500 employees, although the workers&#x27; union says that there are just 3,800.

YouPhone (Alon Cellular) was a member of the Pelephone network as a virtual MVNO operator. It was established as a subsidiary of Alon Blue Square Israel, but since 2015 it has been owned completely by Pelephone and also merged its operations with Pelephone.

==Network==
The Pelephone network started as AMPS/NAMPS in the 850 MHz band. In 1998 it converted to IS-95 CDMA and in 2004 CDMA2000/EV-DO mobile data capabilities were added as well.

A 3G UMTS network in the 850/2100 MHz bands was launched in early 2009 and in March of that year, Pelephone stopped selling cellphones that use the CDMA system. In mid-2010, the UMTS network was upgraded to HSPA+. In 2014 the company launched an LTE network in the 1800 MHz band. and in 2020 5G NR services were launched, using the 3500 MHz band.

In April 2017, Pelephone announced plans to shut down their CDMA network over the summer, and did so on June 28, 2017.

==Operations and services==
Pelephone lost its monopoly status in 1994, when Cellcom was founded, breaking Pelephone&#x27;s monopoly as a mobile network operator, and in 1999, a third competitor, Partner (formerly known as Orange) was established.

The prefix (area code) for Pelephone customers is 050, although customers who requested to keep their old number from a different cellular company may have a different area code, as required by law.

Between 2003 and 2022, Pelephone pursued a multibranding strategy to reach previously underserved market segments. These included Esc, a youth-focused subsidiary which operated between 2003 and 2007 in cooperation with radio station , Sawa, a lower-cost flanker brand targeting the Arab-Israeli sector, and k-mobile, which operated between 2017 and 2019. All the flanker brands were closed and merged into the main Pelephone brand by 2022 as the result of Pelephone&#x27;s new CEO Ilan Siegel&#x27;s decision to focus on 5G expansion.

===Hii mobile===

On April 11, 2016, Pelephone launched a new mobile brand &quot;Hii-Mobile&quot;, in cooperation with Hunnam (owned by Yaakov Kedmi). This brand appeals particularly to young people, soldiers and students with attractive offers and packages for this target audience.

===Pmobile===
Pelephone and the Bug Multisystem retail chain launched the cellphone brand &quot;Pmobile&quot; in May 2016. The brand offers Pelephone network services at prices significantly lower than normal.

==Criticism==
===Involvement in Israeli settlements===
On 12 February 2020, the United Nations published a database of companies doing business related in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as in the occupied Golan Heights. Pelephone was listed on the database on account of its activities in Israeli settlements in these occupied territories, which are considered illegal under international law.

<text>Derek Kirk Kim (born ) is a Korean-American comics artist and filmmaker.

==Personal life==
Derek Kirk Kim was born in South Korea in , and moved to the United States at age eight. From Pacifica, California, by 2005 he was living in San Francisco. There, Kim attended the Academy of Art University where he majored in illustration, though he later wished he had attended &quot;a regular school so I could have gotten a more rounded education and been exposed to different subjects.&quot;

==Career==
Kim began publishing semi-autobiographical serialized short stories on his website, lowbright.com, in 2000. Some of those stories from 2000 to 2003 were collected by Kim and published in &quot;Same Difference and Other Stories&quot;, an award-winning publication that he later said kick-started his professional career. Through the early 2010s, Kim described himself as being singularly focused on writing and drawing comics.

For his character, Andy Go, an art-school dropout who finds himself trapped in a world that outlawed creativity, Kim began branching out by 2012. In the webcomic &quot;Tune&quot;, Kim stepped back from drawing volume two and instead brought on artist Les McClaine to take over those duties—Kim could no longer handle the monotony of the drawing, and instead preferred to focus on production and writing. In the live-action YouTube series &quot;Mythomania&quot;, an impetus for which was the casting–whitewashing controversy in 2010&#x27;s &quot;The Last Airbender&quot;, Kim found he enjoyed filmmaking more than drawing.

Kim was credited as a designer on Animation Domination High-Def&#x27;s 2013 video, &quot;Sympathy for Slender Man Song&quot;, which was a 2014 Webby Awards nominee in the category Online Film &amp; Video: Animation.

===Influences===
Kim became interested in graphical storytelling as a child in South Korea, reading and watching &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, &quot;Gundam&quot;, &quot;Mazinger Z&quot;, Captain Harlock stories, &quot;Marine Boy&quot;, and &quot;Star Blazers&quot;. In 2004, citing their oversized influence on development, Kim expressed an interest in illustrating children&#x27;s books, citing &quot;The Little Prince&quot; and &quot;Oh, the Places You&#x27;ll Go!&quot; as examples.

In 2005, NPR&#x27;s Jacki Lyden noted that, like Kim, both main characters in &quot;Same Difference&quot; are Korean-American, though she felt they did not exhibit any explicitly-Korean attributes; Kim told her that he avoided obvious or stereotypical signifiers of their Asianness, instead grafting similar scenes as he and his Korean-American friends had while growing up. In a 2013 interview by Gene Luen Yang for First Second Books, Kim agreed that, in addition to many of his main characters being Asian-American, he consciously imbued his work with an &quot;Asian American-ness&quot;, though was saddened it needed to be conscious: &quot;The default race for a central character shouldn&#x27;t have to be white.&quot;

===Reception===
In November 2001, Kim was highlighted and praised in &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; for his serials &quot;Same Difference&quot; and &quot;Half Empty&quot;—then hosted on GeoCities. In September 2004, Shaenon K. Garrity reviewed his body of work for &quot;The Webcomics Examiner&quot;, and heaped praise on the artist, explicitly calling out his &quot;technical precision and emotional expressiveness.&quot;

In September 2002, the Xeric Foundation awarded Kim a self-publishing grant for &quot;Same Difference and Other Stories&quot;. For his publication thereof, Kim received a 2003 Ignatz Award for Promising New Talent, a 2004 Eisner Award for Name Deserving of Wider Recognition, and a 2004 Harvey Award for Best New Talent. The third story in 2009&#x27;s &quot;The Eternal Smile&quot;, &quot;Urgent Request&quot;, earned Kim a 2010 Eisner Award for Best Short Story.

<text>Science News (SN) is an American bi-weekly magazine devoted to articles about new scientific and technical developments, typically gleaned from recent scientific and technical journals. The periodical has been described as having a scope across &quot;all sciences&quot; and as having &quot;up to date&quot; coverage.

==History==
&quot;Science News&quot; has been published since 1922 by Society for Science &amp; the Public, a non-profit organization founded by E. W. Scripps in 1920. American chemist Edwin Slosson served as the publication&#x27;s first editor. From 1922 to 1966, it was called Science News Letter. The title was changed to &quot;Science News&quot; with the March 12, 1966, issue (vol. 89, no. 11).

Tom Siegfried was the editor from 2007 to 2012. In 2012, Siegfried stepped down, and Eva Emerson became the Editor in Chief of the magazine. In 2017, Eva Emerson stepped down to become the editor of a new digital magazine, &quot;Annual Reviews&quot;. On February 1, 2018, Nancy Shute became the Editor in Chief of the magazine.

In April 2008, the magazine changed from a weekly format to the current biweekly format, and the website was also redeployed. The April 12 issue (Vol.173 #15) was the last weekly issue. The first biweekly issue (Vol.173 #16) was dated May 10 and featured a new design. The 4-week break between the last weekly issue and first biweekly issue was explained in the Letter from the Publisher (p. 227) in the April 12 issue.

In January 2025, the magazine began publishing on a monthly basis, with significant changes to style, format, and physical aspects.

<doc id="1068649" wikidata="Q1770969" url="?curid=1068649" title="Hinton St Mary">
<text>Hinton St Mary is a village and civil parish in Dorset, southern England. It is sited on a low Corallian limestone ridge beside the River Stour, north of the market town Sturminster Newton. In 2001 the parish had 97 households and a population of 221. In 2013 the estimated population of the parish was 260. In 2021 the estimated population of the parish has decreased to 225.

The village includes a parish church, a traditional pub, a manor house, a village hall and a water mill.

==History==
The church, dedicated to St Peter, has a 15th-century tower. The manor house was once owned by the nuns of Shaftesbury Abbey, and its grounds includes a noted avenue of beech trees.

The village has a community garden, the Millennium Garden, which was constructed in 1999 as an episode of the BBC series &quot;Charlies Garden Angels&quot;, with local people and businesses helping to create it.
Cutt Mill, a water mill on the River Stour to the northwest of the village, was burned down in 2003 by vandals. The building remains unused as the structure is now unsafe.

==Roman mosaic==

In 1963 a Roman building of unknown type, possibly a villa or a church, was discovered in the village. On the floor of one room was laid a large 4th-century mosaic depicting Bellerophon and the Chimera (illustrating good defeating evil) and a portrait bust that may be a depiction of Christ. The bust is now on display in the British Museum. The rest is kept in storage.

A return visit was made to the site of the mosaic in 2021, with several exploration trenches dug and several interesting finds uncovered.

In July 2022, archaeologists from the British Museum unearthed another Roman mosaic dating to the 4th century AD and hundreds of objects from regularly positioned such as jewelry, cash, roof tiles and kiln bricks. Although the mosaic has long been influenced by plowing farmland, it contains a black, white and purple tesserae.

<doc id="1068651" wikidata="Q1585826" url="?curid=1068651" title="Harold Ford Sr.">
<text>Harold Eugene Ford Sr. (born May 20, 1945) is an American politician and Democratic former member of the United States House of Representatives representing the area of Memphis, Tennessee, for 11 terms—from 1975 until his retirement in 1997. He was the first African-American to represent Tennessee in the U.S. Congress. He is a member of the Ford political family from Memphis.

During his 20 years in Congress, Ford obtained ample federal funds for his district through his membership on the House Ways and Means Committee. He advocated for increased government assistance for lower income constituents including job training, health care, and supplemental unemployment benefits with welfare as a safety net. He supported President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s initiatives to rebuild central cities, and opposed President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s cuts to programs such as Medicare and food stamps. He proposed welfare reform legislation to gradually transition recipients from welfare to work, but it was not passed.

His effectiveness was diminished following his 1987 indictment on bank fraud charges that alleged he had used business loans for his personal needs. Ford denied the charges and claimed the prosecution was racially and politically motivated. He lost his committee leadership roles but remained in Congress while the legal proceeding was pending. He was ultimately tried and acquitted in 1993 of all charges by a jury.

He chose to retire from Congress in 1996. His son Harold Jr. returned to Tennessee from New York and successfully ran for his seat. In his retirement, Harold Sr. has been active in Democratic Party affairs and has worked as a lobbyist. He lives in Florida and in the Hamptons.

==Early life, education and family==
Harold grew up on Horn Lake Road in the West Junction neighborhood of South Memphis. He is the eighth of 15 children born to Newton Jackson Ford (1914–1986) and Vera (Davis) Ford (1915–1994), prominent members of the African-American community. His mother was a homemaker and his father was an undertaker and businessman, who opened N.J. Ford Funeral Home (later changed to N.J. Ford And Sons Funeral Home) in 1932. His grandfather Lewie Ford (1889-1931) started the family funeral business and became allied with E. H. Crump, an influential white politician in Memphis and the state in the early 20th century.

Ford and his family have been involved in politics since his great-grandfather Newton Ford (1856–1919), who was a well-respected civic leader around the southern section of Shelby County. Newton Ford was elected as a county squire from 1888 to 1900. N. J. Ford ran for the Tennessee House in 1966 but was not elected.

Harold Ford graduated from Geeter High School in 1963, received his B.S. degree from Tennessee State University in Nashville in 1967 and did graduate work there for one year. He is also a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He received a mortuary science degree from John A. Gupton College of Nashville in 1969, and worked in the family business as a mortician from 1969 until 1974. In 1982, he earned a Master of Business Administration from Howard University.

== Political career ==

===State legislature===
Ford was able to use his family&#x27;s deep roots in Memphis to garner support within the affluent black community for his first run for office. He also ran an organized campaign and was able to take advantage of the increase in black voters that followed the Voting Rights Act. He was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1970, becoming one of its youngest members and one of only a few African Americans to have served in the Tennessee General Assembly to that point in the 20th century. He was made majority whip in his first term, and chaired a state house committee on utility rates and practices.

He was a delegate to Democratic State Convention and to the quadrennial Democratic National Conventions from 1972 through 1996.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
In 1974, after two terms in the Tennessee legislature, he ran for the Democratic nomination for the Memphis-based 8th U.S. Congressional district, easily beating three opponents. He faced four-term Republican incumbent Dan Kuykendall in the general election. At that time, the district still had a white majority, though the 1970 round of redistricting by the Tennessee legislature had redrawn the 8th to include more African-American voters. Ford ran on a bipartisan platform emphasizing economic development to attract both black and white voters. He waged a large and well organized get-out-the-vote campaign using paid workers, volunteers and his own considerable energy, and received support from black churches and celebrities. He was also able to take advantage of post Watergate dissatisfaction with the Republican Party. When the votes were first counted it looked like Kuykendall had eked out a narrow victory—but Ford ultimately won by 744 votes after contesting the original count.

Ford became the first African-American to represent Tennessee in the United States Congress. He was re-elected by large margins, locking in the black vote, and winning a large number of white votes in his district. After the 1983 census, the district was renumbered as the 9th District, and was drawn as a black-majority district. With the percentage of black voters increasing due to increased white flight, Ford then won re-election by gaining more than 70 percent of the vote. After he was indicted, he still garnered more than 50 percent of the vote.

He served on a number of House committees including: Banking, Currency and Housing; Veterans&#x27; Affairs, and the Select Committee on Assassinations that investigated the death, among others, of Martin Luther King Jr. He was a member of the influential House Ways and Means Committee beginning in 1975, and chaired the subcommittee on Public Assistance and Unemployment. He served as the chairman of the House Select Committee on Aging during the 102nd and 103rd Congresses.

Ford obtained ample federal funds for his district through his membership on the House Ways and Means Committee. He focused his work in Congress on helping lower income constituents. He advocated for increased federal government assistance for job training, health care, and unemployment supplemental benefits with welfare as a safety net. He supported Democratic President Carter&#x27;s initiatives to rebuild central cities, and opposed cuts to programs such as Medicare and food stamps that were passed during the administration of Republican President Ronald Reagan. Ford proposed comprehensive welfare reform legislation to gradually transition recipients with children over the age of six from welfare to work. The legislation had a high start up cost due to the education and job training aspects, and was opposed by the Reagan administration.

Ford suffered in the eyes of many for the antics of his brother John Ford, who had been elected to the Tennessee State Senate in the same 1974 election. John Ford was accused, but never criminally convicted, of driving between Memphis and Nashville at high speeds while in possession of a legal firearm. Harold Ford said he had no control over his brother&#x27;s actions.

=== Bribery trials ===
In 1987, federal prosecutors obtained an indictment against Ford from a grand jury in eastern Tennessee. The indictment was based on testimony from two bankers, both partners of Jake Butcher, who pled guilty to bank fraud under a plea bargain. Ford was charged in 18 counts of conspiracy and fraud accusing him of receiving nearly $1.5 million in loans from 1976 to 1983, that prosecutors alleged were actually bribes. Ford contended that the loans were legitimate business transactions used to extend loans to him and his family funeral home business.

A first trial in Memphis in 1990 ended in a mistrial with the jury deadlocked 8-4 along straight racial lines. The eight black jury members voted to acquit, and the four whites voted to convict. The judge granted the prosecutor&#x27;s motion for retrial, and held that an impartial jury could not be found in Ford&#x27;s hometown, the heavily Democratic and predominantly black city of Memphis where Ford was very popular. He ordered that the jury for the retrial be selected for a pool of jurors living 80 miles from Memphis in 17 heavily Republican and predominantly white rural counties. The jurors were to be bused into Memphis for the trial. Ford appealed this jury selection plan twice to the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on the ground that it violated his constitutional right to a jury of his peers; the appeals were denied twice. In 1993, Stuart Gerson, a hold-over Bush-appointee serving as acting Attorney General sided with Ford&#x27;s request for a jury from Memphis, but the federal judge hearing the trial rejected the request. On April 9, 1993, a jury of 11 whites and 1 black acquitted Ford of all charges. During the seven year pendentcy of the criminal charges, Ford remained a U.S. Representative, but was stripped by Congress of his committee leadership roles. After his acquittal they were restored. In 1992, he had also been implicated in the House banking scandal.

== Later career ==
Harold Jr., Ford&#x27;s son, in 1996 returned to run for his retiring father&#x27;s seat after having worked in New York City and completed his education at the University of Pennsylvania and University of Michigan Law School. The elder Ford publicly hoped that the confrontational stance that he had sometimes used, particularly with regard to race, would never need to be employed by his son.

==Personal life==
Ford married Dorothy Bowles in 1969 and the couple had three children: Harold Jr., Newton Jake and Sir Isaac. They divorced in 1999. He and his second wife, Michelle Roberts have two children: Andrew and Ava.

He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He is a Baptist. Currently retired, Ford divides his time between Tennessee and Fisher Island in Miami-Dade County, Florida. He is still active in the Democratic Party.

<text>Iwerne Courtney (), also known as Shroton, is a village and civil parish in the English county of Dorset. It lies approximately north-west of Blandford Forum. It is sited by the small River Iwerne between Hambledon Hill to the south-west and the hills of Cranborne Chase to the east. In 2001 the parish had 187 households and a population of 400. In 2013 the estimated population of the parish was 410.

==Toponymy==
The names Iwerne Courtney and Shroton both have long histories. Iwerne () is a Celtic rivername that perhaps refers to a goddess or may mean &quot;yew-river&quot;. The village was recorded as &quot;Ywern&quot; in 877 AD, and in 1086 in the Domesday Book it was &quot;Werne&quot;. The addition of Courtney is a result of land by the Iwerne stream being owned in the 13th century by the Courtenay family, the Earls of Devon.

The name Shroton derives from the Old English &quot;scīr-rēfa&quot; and &quot;tūn&quot;, meaning &quot;sheriff&#x27;s estate&quot; or &quot;sheriff&#x27;s town&quot;, and its use is due to the lord and tenant-in-chief at the time of Domesday being Baldwin of Exeter, the sheriff of Devon. In 1403 the name was recorded as &quot;Shyrevton&quot;.

The name Shroton is preferred locally; in his 1980 book &quot;Dorset Villages&quot;, Roland Gant stated that &quot;I have heard only visitors to Dorset call it Iwerne Courtney&quot;.

==History==
At the time of the Domesday Book, Iwerne Courtney had 17 households and was in the hundred of Gillingham. It had 2 mills, of meadow, 8 ploughlands, and its value to the lord of the manor was £10.

In 1261 the village received a grant from Henry the Third, enabling it to hold two annual fairs and a weekly market. The autumn &quot;Shroton Fair&quot; used to be &quot;one of the main Dorset events of the year&quot;. It is mentioned in Owen&#x27;s book of fairs (1788), under the name Shroton. In 1965 Dorset-born broadcaster Ralph Wightman wrote of the fair that &quot;For many years time was dated in this part of Dorset by Shroton Fair. Old men recalled events by the number of months they had happened before or after this event.&quot; However the fair has now &quot;vanished without a trace&quot;.

The civil parish of the village was formed by the joining of three settlements: Iwerne Courtney in the centre, Farrington to the northwest and Ranston immediately east of the river. Each settlement had its own open field system. Farrington now consists of a few farms, and at Ranston only the manor house remains.

==Governance==
The parish of Iwerne Courtney or Shroton is within the Dorset Council ward of Beacon and the parliamentary constituency of North Dorset. The MP since 2015 is Simon Hoare of the Conservative Party.

==Geography==
Iwerne Courtney civil parish covers nearly in an L-shaped area on either side of the River Iwerne. To the east it extends over the chalk hills of Cranborne Chase, reaching an elevation of over . To the west it extends north-west over greensand, gault and Kimmeridge clay at an altitude of about , although in the south-west it rises to over on the slopes of Hambledon Hill, an outlier of the chalk.

<doc id="1068674" wikidata="Q41346" url="?curid=1068674" title="Hassan II Mosque">
<text>The Hassan II Mosque () is a mosque in Casablanca, Morocco. It is the second largest functioning mosque in Africa and is the 14th largest in the world. Its minaret is the world&#x27;s second tallest minaret at . Completed in 1993, it was designed by Michel Pinseau under the guidance of King Hassan II and built by Moroccan artisans from all over the kingdom. The minaret is 60 stories high topped by a laser, the light from which is directed towards Mecca. The mosque stands on a promontory looking out to the Atlantic Ocean; worshippers can pray over the sea but there is no glass floor looking into the sea. The walls are of hand-crafted marble and the roof is retractable. A maximum of 105,000 worshippers can gather together for prayer: 25,000 inside the mosque hall and another 80,000 on the mosque&#x27;s outside ground.

==Geography==
The mosque is located at Bd Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdallah in Casablanca. The complex nestles between the harbor and the El Hank Lighthouse. From the nearest train station at it is about a 20-minute walk to the mosque. The ten-lane boulevard with shopping avenues is at the southern facade of the mosque and extends to the gates of the Palace Oued el Makhazine in the middle of the city. The basilical plan of the mosque justifies this layout of the boulevard.

The mosque rises above the Atlantic Ocean. The building is built partially on land and partially over the ocean. This siting was accomplished by creating a platform linking a natural rock outcrop reclaimed from the sea, where the Orthlieb Pool had previously been located. Two large breakwaters were also built, to protect the mosque from the erosive action of the ocean waves, which can be up to in height. A temporary pier in length had to be erected to protect the foundations of the pillars from the sea during the construction period. Its environmental advantage is that it is free of noise and pollution and receives a fresh breeze from the sea.

Apart from the mosque, other structures in the area are a madrasa (Islamic school), hammams (bathhouses), a museum on Moroccan history, conference halls, and a very large library said to be the &quot;most comprehensive in the Islamic world.&quot; The 41 fountains in the courtyard are all well decorated. The garden around the mosque is well tended and is a popular location for family picnics. The traditionally designed madrasa occupies an area of including the basement. Two stories in height, it is constructed in a semi-circular shape, with abutting qibla wall and the mihrab section.

==History==
The historical context of the mosque began with the death of King Mohammed V in 1961. King Hassan II had requested for the best of the country&#x27;s artisans to come forward and submit plans for a mausoleum to honour the departed king; it should &quot;reflect the fervor and veneration with which this illustrious man was regarded.&quot; In 1980, during his birthday celebrations, Hassan II had made his ambitions very clear for creating a single landmark monument in Casablanca by stating:

The building was commissioned by King Hassan II to be the most ambitious structure ever built in Morocco. It was designed by the French architect Michel Pinseau who had lived in Morocco, and was constructed by the civil engineering group Bouygues.

Work commenced on July 12, 1986, and was conducted over a seven-year period. Construction was scheduled to be completed in 1989 ready for Hassan II&#x27;s 60th birthday. During the most intense period of construction, 1400 men worked during the day and another 1100 during the night. 10,000 artists and craftsmen participated in building and beautifying the mosque. However, the building was not completed on schedule which delayed inauguration. The formal inauguration was subsequently chosen to be the 11th Rabi&#x27; al-Awwal of the year 1414 of the Hijra, corresponding to 30 August 1993, which also marked the eve of the anniversary of Prophet Muhammad’s birth. It was dedicated to the Sovereign of Morocco.

===Financing===
Construction costs, estimated to be about 585 million euro, were an issue of debate in Morocco, a lower mid-income country. While Hassan wished to build a mosque which would be second in size only to the mosque at Mecca, the government lacked funds for such a grand project. Much of the financing was by public subscription. Twelve million people donated to the cause, with a receipt and certificate given to every donor. The smallest contribution was 5 DH. In addition to public donations and those from business establishments as well as other countries, western countries provided construction loans, which Morocco repaid.

==Architecture and fittings==

In the words of the authors of the book &quot;Morocco Country Study Guide&quot;, the Hassan II Mosque &quot;undeniably marks the continuity of a modernized ancestral art and bears the sign of innovations that are due not only to technical reasons but also to a fertile exploration of new aesthetic possibilities.&quot; The building dimensions are in length and in width. All of the granite, plaster, marble, wood and other materials used in the construction, were extracted from around Morocco, with the exception of some Italian white granite columns and 56 glass chandeliers. Six thousand traditional Moroccan artisans worked for five years to create the abundant and beautiful mosaics, stone and marble floors and columns, sculpted plaster moldings, and carved and painted wood ceilings. The exterior surfaces of the mosque display titanium, bronze, and granite finishes. It is ornamented with pale blue marble and Zellige tilework. A particular feature in the mosque is that all structures are made of reinforced cement concrete and all decorations are of traditional Moroccan design. The construction work involved engagement of 35,000 workers and working of over 50 million hours. The mosque has capacity to accommodate 25,000 devotees for prayers in the main hall and another 80,000 in the plaza squares around it.

Notable architectural features include the conspicuous columns, the horseshoe arches, and the innumerable muqarnas embellishing the ceilings. The dome, arches and walls give a grand ambiance to the mosque. The first-class sound system is discreetly hidden. The ablution room and a vast public hammam are in the basement, with its own entrance. Tadelakt, a plastering technique which adds egg yolks and black soap into mixed plaster, was used in the hammam baths.

===Design===
The building blends Islamic architecture and Moroccan elements, and reflects Moorish influences, while featuring an urban design. It displays elements found in other Moroccan buildings such as the unfinished mosque in Rabat and the Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakesh. There are features from an old Roman fort converted into the Tomb of King Mohammed V. Other elements come from the Hassan Tower Mosque, the Dome of the Rock (also known as Qubbat al Sakhra 688–692 AD), the Great Mosque of Madina (705–710 AD), Kairouan Mosque in Tunisia (663 AD), the Great Mosque of Damascus (705–715 AD), the Great Mosque of Cordoba (785–786 AD), Quarawiyyin Mosque (956 and 1135 AD) in Morocco, the Great Mosque of Tlemcen (1136), and Djamaa el Kebir (1096). Its layout is known as the basilican plan, which is different from the common practice of a T-shaped plan adopted in many North African countries. The qibla wall is perpendicular to the naves which is said to be an unconventional layout, given that it is customary for the rows of worshipers facing Mecca to be as wide as possible rather than extend farther back (Halod and Khan 1997, 61). The adoption of this plan has been described as &quot;a conflict between King Hassan II the ancient aristocrat and King Hassan II the contemporary leader who must develop commerce and industry in order meet the needs of his country.&quot;

===Prayer hall===

The prayer hall is on the top of the mosque covered in windows The central hall is centrally heated, and provides spectacular underwater views of the Atlantic Ocean. The decorations in the hall are elaborate and exquisite made possible by involving 6,000 master artisans of Morocco working on it. It is so large that it can easily accommodate Notre-Dame de Paris or St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. The woodcarvings, the zellij work and the stucco mouldings are of elaborate and highly impressive design; the wood used for carving is cedar from the middle Atlas Mountains, the marble is from Agadir and granite is brought from Tafraoute.

The prayer hall is built to a rectangular plan of length and width with three naves, which are perpendicular to the qibla wall. The central nave of the hall is and larger than the side naves which are high. The central hall is undulating with a succession of numerous domes from which glass chandeliers, imported from Murano, are hung. On either side of the hall, there are mezzanine floors with carved dark wood furnishings, which are reserved for women. The doors are electrically operated. A &quot;triptyich marble partition with open work and central window flanked by two smaller sized windows&quot; are built on the wall of the façade. Such panels, built with multicolored arches, engraved with ornamented floral designs, appear like a geometrical framework when viewed from the outside. The gates are embellished with marble bars which have faux voussoirs (alternately smooth or sculpted). The pillars of height are square in shape with engaged columns and cruciform joining a series of pillars. Geometrically shaped polychromatic zellji with carved plaster are noted with floral and geometric designs with epigraphy. Carved or painted marble or shaped wood are used for these elegant designs, which highlight Islamic art forms.

The roof is retractable, illuminating the hall with daytime sunlight and allowing worshippers to pray under the stars on clear nights. It weighs 1,100 tons and can be opened in five minutes; it measures high, with an area of . The roof is covered with cast-aluminium tiles, (similar to the Fez tiles), stronger and more reliable than traditional ceramic tiles, and about 35 percent lighter. The prayer hall is also illuminated by light from the glass gates on the northern wall.

===Minaret===
The minaret is tall and was the tallest minaret in the world when completed in 1993. It has a laser beam fitted at the top, which is electronically operated in the evening. It is oriented towards Mecca and has a range of . The minaret is said to enhance the visual alignment of the boulevard. It is square in shape thrusting skyward. The base to the top width ratio of 1 to 8 (between basement and the summit) has a marble covering on the exterior with austere decoration. The faces of the facade have carved ornamentation with different materials. There are stitches of roudani tracetine on a 100,000 MP surface. This decorative material (with chrome and green as dominant colours), is a substitute for the use of bricks, the material used in many other notable minarets, and has given the mosque an extraordinary elegance. Green tiles decorate the minaret for one third of the height from the top, and then changes colour to deep green or turquoise blue; it is said that in the Hassan II minaret, the designer had used his sea-foam green and God&#x27;s blue to celebrate the life of a king. The concrete used for the minaret was a special high-grade type, which could perform well under severe conditions of a combined action of strong wind and seismicity. This was achieved by the Science Department of the Bouygues Group, the contractors for the project, who developed an extra-strength concrete four times stronger than ordinary concrete. Called B.H.P (highly resistant concrete), it offers a resistance to compression value of 1200 bars per sqcm (claimed to be a world record) and has a very quick setting time. This enabled the building of a taller structure with due underpinning of the foundation, while adhering to the construction schedule. Cranes were also designed to suit the height of the minaret for concreting.

=== Hassan II Mosque Museum ===
The museum opened its doors to the public after the construction of the mosque. It showcases art pieces from various traditional Moroccan arts as well as unused architectural elements of the mosque, such as carved stucco, painted wood ceilings, and zellij walls.

==Restoration works==

Structural deterioration in the concrete wall was observed ten years after the mosque&#x27;s completion. This was explained as being due to exposure to the salt water of the Atlantic Ocean, into which nearly half of the mosque&#x27;s foundation projects. Salt water migrating into the porous concrete caused the rusting of the rebar steel reinforcements resulting in expansion of the steel and causing cracking of concrete. Salt water had penetrated beyond the steel bar into the structures as well.

Effective restoration works were instituted in April 2005. This involved use of moly-grade stainless steel combined with high-grade concrete to make the structure resistant to chloride attack, a process that evolved during 3 years of research. This is expected to enhance the building&#x27;s life by 100 years. The works were carried out in four phases. In the first phase a leak-proof coffer dam was constructed to isolate and dry the work area. This was built below the highest water level. In the second phase, the voids seen in the prayer hall were filled with concrete. In the third phase, the structural slabs and pillars on the exterior part of mosque exposed to the sea were demolished; of concrete was removed. In the fourth phase, new exterior protection works were built using high-strength concrete with 2205 (conforming to UNS S 32205 EN 1.442 standards) stainless steel rods as reinforcements for effective erosion control. Even though the many structural changes were made as per detailed design, still during execution of works, 100 external pillars, called “combs” because of their wave breaking characteristics, were exposed to salt water and wave action and had to be replaced with new pillars. These were made from high-strength concrete with 2205 stainless steel reinforcements. This necessitated an additional leak-proof dyke to be built behind the earlier one; total dyke quantity involved was . All of these works involved use of 1300 tons of special steel (with 40 tons of Mo) of bars with yield strength of 850 N per mm2. The concrete quantity poured involved of non-reinforced bulk concrete and of high-strength concrete. The entire work was done at a cost of 50 million euros.

<text>Patrick Sean Farley is a freelance illustrator and Web page designer. Known as a pioneer of webcomics as a medium, Farley works out of Oakland, California.

== Biography ==
Patrick Farley is the creator of comics under the anthology &quot;Electric Sheep Comix&quot;. Scott McCloud cites him as an early pioneer of the webcomics movement. He is the author of a semi-autobiographical webcomics graphic novel &quot;The Guy I Almost Was&quot; and of several other Web-based comics or stories, listed below.

In addition to the traditional strip format Farley has presented work in the infinite canvas mode peculiar to the more innovative web comics, and he has done many stories using 3D tools such as Poser and Bryce.

&quot;The Webcomics Examiner&quot; wrote a story about Farley&#x27;s work in December 2004 titled &quot;Patrick Farley, Apocalyptic Utopian&quot;, describing him as &quot;the Cecil B. DeMille of webcomics&quot;.

Farley appeared in &quot;Adventures Into Digital Comics&quot;, a 2006 documentary on the comics industry.

=== Electric Sheep Comix ===
Electric Sheep Comix is a Web-based anthology of Farley&#x27;s work. The name was taken from the title of Philip K. Dick&#x27;s novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;. It was originally hosted at the domain , but the domain registration lapsed, and after being offline for 2 years, the site was restarted in August 2009, at a new domain.

One unusual project from this collection is &quot;Apocamon: The Final Judgement&quot;, a satirical, stylized presentation of the Book of Revelation in a graphic style similar to the Pokémon trading card game and a writing style similar to the comic book tracts of Jack T. Chick.

===&quot;The Spiders&quot;===
&quot;The Spiders&quot; is a webcomic written and illustrated by cartoonist Patrick S. Farley for his website, Electric Sheep Comix. The comic traces an alternate history of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, where Al Gore is President of the United States, and ordinary civilians can view the war through web cams carried by roving robotic &quot;spiders&quot; dispersed into Afghanistan by the U.S. Army.

Unlike most webcomics, the comic is displayed in an &quot;infinite canvas&quot; format, where each page of the comic has the individual panels lined up in one continuous strip, viewable in full by scrolling with the horizontal scrollbar of the reader&#x27;s web browser. Occasionally, the pages of the comic deviate from the format for storytelling effect, usually in the form of a fictional web page created for the story.

Mark Frauenfelder, writing for &quot;Playboy&quot;, recommended the comic, praising how it used the multimedia capabilities afforded by the internet to &quot;present comics in an entirely new way.&quot;

=== Electric Sheep Reloaded ===
In March 2010 Farley started a Kickstarter page in order to raise $6,000 to support him in making more comics for his website. On May 1, 2010, the fund raiser was successful. From June 2010 until December 2010 Farley continued &quot;The Spiders&quot; with a chapter titled &quot;Prologue&quot;.

<text>Starday Records was an American record label producing traditional country music during the 1950s and 1960s.

==History==

The label began in 1952 in Beaumont, Texas, when local businessmen Jack Starnes (Lefty Frizzell&#x27;s manager) and Houston record distributor Harold W. Daily (better known as &quot;Pappy&quot;) decided to form a record label. The Starday name is a combination of Starnes&#x27; and Daily&#x27;s last names. After four releases, former Four Star vice president Don Pierce was brought into the fold and the three men founded the Starday Recording and Publishing Company.

Soon after, Starnes sold his shares out to Pierce. In the mid-1950s, Art Talmadge of Mercury Records made Starday a unique proposition, whereby Mercury contracted out all production of Country and Bluegrass music to Starday Records. This move proved not to be the success Mercury had hoped it would be, and this resulted in an acrimonious split between Daily and Pierce. 
Daily joined Mercury records as an A&amp;R man/Talent Scout, while Pierce took over Starday altogether and moved operations to Madison, Tennessee, a bedroom community of Nashville.

Pierce began to study in earnest the buying habits of the fans of Country &amp; Western music. He soon found that most people who bought Country records were Adults who preferred the Long-Play album format over single records. With this knowledge Starday began cranking out LPs in earnest, with Singles basically being an aside to their LP line.

In addition to creating the largest bluegrass catalogue throughout the 1950s and ‘60s, Starday was also known for its legendary rockabilly catalogue, an extensive Texas honky-tonk outpouring, classic gospel and sacred recordings and as a Nashville independent powerhouse studio and record label. Starday was the largest exclusively country label of the period and is renowned among record collectors for producing a level of pure, undiluted country music that was becoming increasingly rare on the major labels. Starday released the first recordings of George Jones and country stars like Willie Nelson, Dottie West, the Big Bopper, and Roger Miller. Comedian Minnie Pearl released a number of records for the label. Several veteran country stars were also on Starday, including Cowboy Copas, Helen Carter, Johnny Bond, Harry Choates, Link Davis and T. Texas Tyler. The label also featured several legendary country radio-based acts in the twilight of their careers, such as the Blue Sky Boys, Lulu Belle and Scotty, Texas Ruby, Mel Price, and Moon Mullican, performers probably not of much interest to the big labels in the 1960s. The label may be best known for the dozens of budget-priced compilation albums it released featuring artists on or at one time on the label.

Starday&#x27;s most successful artist was perhaps Red Sovine, who scored a number of hits in the 1960s on the label. Starday also produced a series of classic anthologies of trucker records by various artists including Copas, Bond, Sovine, The Willis Brothers and bluegrass acts including Moore &amp; Napier and Reno &amp; Smiley. These LPs were renowned for their color covers shot at Nashville area truck stops with real rigs and shapely female models dressed as waitresses.

===Starday-King Records===
When Syd Nathan died in 1968, his label King Records was acquired by Hal Neely&#x27;s Starday Company. Neely relaunched the label as Starday-King Records. The label was sold to LIN Broadcasting (sale consummated in 1970), which in turn sold it to Tennessee Recording and Publishing Company, owned by Freddy Bienstock, Hal Neely, Jerry Leiber, and Mike Stoller, who sold it in 1974 to Gusto Records.

By the end of the 1960s, Starday&#x27;s new product was limited and most of its recordings were reissues, many of them originally recorded or released on other small labels. The Starday label briefly made a strong comeback in the mid-1970s when Gusto Records&#x27; Red Sovine took his recitation song record &quot;Teddy Bear&quot; to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart in 1976 using the Starday label, and even made the back of the pop chart. This record rose to No. 1 in seven weeks, the fastest rise to the No. 1 position for any 45 rpm record released before or since.

University Press of Mississippi published &quot;The Starday Story: The House That Country Music Built&quot;, written by Nathan D. Gibson with Starday president Don Pierce, in January 2011. The book retraces the label&#x27;s origins in 1953 through 1968 and the Starday-King merger.

<doc id="1068680" wikidata="Q2312196" url="?curid=1068680" title="Iwerne Minster">
<text>Iwerne Minster ( ) is a village and civil parish in Dorset, England. It lies on the edge of the Blackmore Vale, approximately midway between the towns of Shaftesbury and Blandford Forum. The A350 main road between those towns passes through the edge of the village, just to the west. In the 2011 Census the civil parish had a population of 978.

==Toponymy==
The village takes its name from the River Iwerne. &quot;Iwerne&quot; may have been the name of a Celtic goddess or may be a reference to yew trees growing on its banks. The &quot;Minster&quot; part of the name is a reference to the ownership of the settlement by Shaftesbury Abbey.

==History==
Evidence of prehistoric human activity in the parish consists of five round barrows on the chalk escarpment in the east, and the site of an Iron Age settlement in the southwest, near Park Farm. The settlement, which takes the form of several pits, was excavated by General Pitt-Rivers in 1897; finds included a bronze brooch and silver coins.

In the early Roman period the Iron Age site was altered with the construction of ditches and sub-rectangular pits; finds included 1st and 2nd-century samian pottery and Roman coins dating from the period between Vespasian and Commodus. In the 3rd century a building, possibly an aisled barn, was constructed on the western half of the site; it was long, wide and had flint footings wide. More Roman coins were found here, dating from the period between Gordian I and Tacitus. Around 300 AD a substantial building was constructed on the eastern half of the site; it was long and wide and divided into four rooms, with a granary built against one external wall and a corridor or outbuildings against another. One of the rooms had plaster walls and a floor made of shale from Kimmeridge. The building was occupied for about sixty years.

In the Domesday Book in 1086 the village was recorded as &quot;Euneministre&quot; (or &quot;Euneminstre&quot;). It was in Sixpenny Hundred and the lord and tenant-in-chief was Shaftesbury Abbey.
The early settlements in the parish—Iwerne and Preston—were sited by the River Iwerne. There may have been a third settlement contemporary with these, called Hulle. Pegg&#x27;s Farm in the northwest of the parish is probably a secondary settlement; it was in existence by the early 14th century, though the present buildings are mostly 18th-century.

The parish church, dedicated to St Mary, has a nave, north aisle and north transept dating from the mid-12th century, though it is probable there was a minster and clergy community here before that, as indicated by the village&#x27;s name and its large size in the Domesday Book.
Iwerne Minster House was built in 1796 by the Bowyer Bower family (who had owned the village and estate of Iwerne Minster since at least 1645), on the site of their original manor. Their family crest, the Talbot, is still represented in the name of the village pub. Iwerne Minster remained in the Bowyer Bower family until 1876, when they sold the estate to George Glyn, 2nd Baron Wolverton. Wolverton had a new house built, designed by Alfred Waterhouse and completed in 1878. A ornamental park, including a lake, was also created. James Hainsworth Ismay, second son of Thomas Henry Ismay, bought the estate in 1908; he had a village hall, pump and shelter built, designed clothes for the village children and gave the village shops hand-painted signs, all resulting in the village having a &quot;model&quot; appearance. The estate was sold in 1929 and the mansion became Clayesmore School. From the 1940s until the 2000s, the school was the venue for the influential Evangelical Christian Iwerne camps.
There are 44 structures in the parish that are listed by Historic England for having particular historical or architectural interest. These include the parish church of St Mary (Grade I) and The Chantry (Grade II*). The village noticeboard was designed by Giles Gilbert Scott.

==Geography==
Iwerne Minster civil parish covers an area of at an elevation of about . From east to west the geology of the parish comprises chalk hills in the east, then upper greensand and gault, through to lower greensand around the Fontmell Brook in the northwest. About half of the parish and most of Iwerne Minster village—the area east of the A350—is in the Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

Measured directly, Iwerne Minster village is about north of Blandford Forum and south of Shaftesbury.

==Governance==
Iwerne Minster is in the northern part of the electoral ward called the Beacon Ward, which extends to includes Sutton Waldron, Fontmell Magna, Ashmore, Melburry Abbas &amp; Cann, Twyford, Hartgrove, Compton Abbas, Todber, Stour Row, Stour Provost, East Orchard Shroton. The ward falls within the North Dorset parliamentary constituency and in the 2011 Census had a population of 4,818.

==Demography==
In the 2011 Census the civil parish had 326 dwellings, 298 households and a population of 978. 21.4% of residents were aged 65 or over (compared to 16.4% for England as a whole).

The population of the parish in the censuses between 1921 and 2001 is shown in the table below:

==In literature==
Virginia Woolf and her husband spent five days in Iwerne Minster in April 1926; she wrote to her friend Raymond Mortimer about how, even though the appropriation of images of rural England for patriotic purposes made her &quot;almost ashamed of England being so English&quot;, she and her husband had nevertheless been enchanted by the Dorset landscape in spring. It is possible that the name of the fictional village &quot;Bolney Minster&quot; in Woolf&#x27;s 1941 novel &quot;Between the Acts&quot; was partly inspired by Iwerne.

A pre-Norman conquest Iwerne Minster is imagined, along with neighbouring village Shroton, in Julian Rathbone&#x27;s 1997 novel &quot;The Last English King&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Angler&quot; (SS-240), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the anglerfish.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Angler&quot;′s keel was laid down on 9 November 1942 by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 4 July 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Mary E. Drewry (née Metcalf), the wife of Congressman Patrick H. Drewry of the House Naval Affairs Committee, and commissioned at New London, Connecticut, on 1 October 1943.

==Service history==

===World War II===
Following shakedown in the New London and Newport, Rhode Island, area, &quot;Angler&quot; sailed to Key West, Florida. She arrived on 21 November and after one week of operations with the Fleet Sound School, sailed for Pearl Harbor on 27 November.

Selected to be transferred from Pearl Harbor, &quot;Angler&quot; commenced her first war patrol on 10 January 1944, her patrol to terminate at Fremantle, Australia. &quot;Angler&quot; encountered a Japanese convoy north of the Mariana Islands on 29 January, and attacked with torpedoes. She claimed to have sunk one ship and damaged two others, but postwar records confirmed only the sinking of &quot;Shuko Maru&quot;. Having developed &quot;structural noises&quot; which prevented silent running, &quot;Angler&quot; turned back to Midway Island for repairs, arriving on 4 February.

&quot;Angler&quot; began her second war patrol on 15 February, assigned the waters off the east coast of the Philippines in the Mindanao Sea and Sulu Sea. While she was nearing her patrol area, General Douglas MacArthur had learned that the Japanese were massacring all the civilians they could find on the island of Panay. MacArthur requested that a submarine be assigned to evacuate what was believed to be about twenty civilians from the island. The task fell to &quot;Angler&quot;, and she found 58 men, women, and children awaiting rescue. &quot;Angler&quot; took all of them on board and berthed them in the forward and after torpedo rooms. Meals were limited to two per day in an attempt to stretch the submarine&#x27;s overtaxed food supply. Toward the end of the cruise, many of the passengers and crew became nauseous. The captain suspected the water supply may have been contaminated, and requested that the fresh water tanks be cleaned upon arrival at Fremantle on 9 April.

&quot;Angler&quot; sailed on 3 May for another patrol as one of eight submarines assigned to support the Operation Transom carrier strike scheduled to hit Surabaya, Java. Their job would be to sink retreating Japanese ships, to provide lifeguard services, and to guard the major passages from the Java Sea (the Sunda Strait and Lombok Strait) to the Indian Ocean lest the Japanese try to move into the Indian Ocean to attack the Allied strike force. Launched as scheduled on 17 May the strikes achieved complete surprise.

The only action of the patrol for &quot;Angler&quot; came on 20 May, when she torpedoed and sank &quot;Otori Maru&quot;. Japanese escort vessels administered a bad pounding to &quot;Angler&quot;, but she escaped damage.

The next day, nausea again gripped everyone on board &quot;Angler&quot;. The situation was reported to Fremantle, and the submarine was ordered to return at once. Things onboard &quot;Angler&quot; continued to grow worse. On 22 May, Lieutenant Commander Olsen noted in the log: &quot;Physical condition of officers and crew is so bad that it is difficult to maintain watch, either surface or submerged. Put crew on fruit juice alone, no water. Held thorough field day in case boat is contaminated. Exercised special supervision in cooking, dishwashing.&quot; On 23 May he wrote, &quot;Decided to run submerged as we did not have enough able-bodied people to maintain proper surface watch.&quot;

 and were sent to intercept &quot;Angler&quot; and lend assistance. also arrived and transferred a doctor to assist the ailing crewmembers. &quot;Angler&quot; finally arrived at Fremantle on 29 May. An investigation concluded that an electrician had taken a can of carbon tetrachloride on board as a cleaning agent, which was strictly forbidden. Although the illness was attributed the tetrachloride, some suspected that the fresh water tanks had not been cleaned as requested.

&quot;Angler&quot; began her fourth war patrol on 21 June. She paused to refuel alongside a barge in Exmouth Gulf on 24 June, and while maneuvering into position, hit an uncharted obstruction. Returning to Fremantle for repairs, &quot;Angler&quot; was underway again on 29 June with a new starboard propeller. She rendezvoused with &quot;Flasher&quot; and &quot;Crevalle&quot; to carry out one of the first &quot;wolfpack&quot; patrols of the war. The group worked the middle area of the South China Sea and along the Indochinese coast, without success. They were then ordered to move to a position off the west coast of Luzon. On 25 July, &quot;Angler&quot; and her sister ships picked up a large northbound convoy and began a series of attacks over the next few days. While &quot;Angler&quot; failed to damage any ships, the pack as a whole sank six ships for 36,000 tons. The patrol continued uneventfully until 23 August, when &quot;Angler&quot; returned to Fremantle.

On 18 September, the submarine departed on her next patrol, to operate with in the Sulu Sea. On 14 October &quot;Angler&quot; torpedoed and sank &quot;Nanrei Maru&quot;.

At 0145 on 22 October, the men on watch on &quot;Angler&quot;″s bridge were startled by voices calling out of the darkness. Repeated attempts to locate the source of the voices proved unsuccessful, but the dawn soon revealed &quot;one of the most gruesome sights imaginable as far as you could see ...&quot; the water literally covered with wreckage and dead Japanese, most clad in Army uniforms. Aircraft in the vicinity made it too risky to stop and investigate a lifeboat, but &quot;Angler&quot; returned at sunset. At 1806, she brought this boat alongside and counted 26 surviving men, both soldiers and naval ratings. Determining who was the senior officer of the group, the submarine retained three men for questioning, and after giving the men remaining in the boat some food, water, and a course to land, away, released the lifeboat. The three prisoners retained on board – Second Lieutenant Seigi Shimazu, Sergeant Sei Fuji, and Sergeant Toyonaga Nishikawa – had willingly agreed to go along with the Americans.

At 1915 on 23 October, &quot;Angler&quot; made radar contact with the main Japanese force steaming to contest the Allied invasion of Leyte. &quot;Angler&quot; tracked the task force until 0240 the following morning, and her contact reports proved of inestimable value to the American forces off Leyte. Ironically, &quot;Angler&quot; had just made the only worthwhile contact with the only worthwhile convoy of her entire patrol. Although the maneuvers to clear the convoy took her astern of the task force, &quot;Angler&quot; forsook the convoy of civilian ships for the military task force. On 1 November, &quot;Angler&quot; rendezvoused with , and received onboard Commander Fred E. Bakutis, a pilot from Fighting Squadron 20 (VF-20) who had been rescued by &quot;Hardhead&quot; a short time before. &quot;Angler&quot; returned to Fremantle on 9 November.

On 4 December, &quot;Angler&quot; left on her sixth patrol, during which time she served a brief period of lifeguard duty. On 13 December, was fired on by a Japanese destroyer. A shell tore a large hole in &quot;Bergall&quot;″s pressure hull and left the submarine unable to dive. &quot;Angler&quot;, operating in the Java Sea, received orders to proceed to &quot;Bergall&quot;″s assistance, take off the crew and torpedo the ship. She found the crippled submarine on 15 December. &quot;Bergall&quot;″s commanding officer, Commander John Hyde, had decided to remain in &quot;Bergall&quot; with a skeleton crew. &quot;Angler&quot; trailed &quot;Bergall&quot; to take everyone off if a Japanese attack threatened. The two submarines traveled nearly , through waters mostly controlled by the enemy, and reached Exmouth Gulf safely on 20 December without seeing any Japanese airplanes or ships.

&quot;Angler&quot; resumed her patrol, but contacted no enemy shipping. She put in at Saipan briefly on 6 February 1945, then continued on to Pearl Harbor. &quot;Angler&quot; reached the West Coast of the United States on 24 February, and immediately began overhaul at the Bethlehem Steel Company yard at San Francisco, California. She was underway again on 18 May, and by 12 June was ready to begin her seventh and final war patrol. On 27 June, she made a fuel stop at Saipan then sailed to patrol the waters east of Honshū. At that stage of the war, shipping targets were few and far between, and &quot;Angler&quot; made only two contacts. One of these moved away faster than &quot;Angler&quot; could close, but the submarine developed the other into an unsuccessful torpedo attack on 25 July.

&quot;Angler&quot; did, however, conduct three shore bombardment missions during this patrol. The first - on 26 July - found her making a careful reconnaissance to locate a Japanese installation on Kinkasan Island. From a range of about , &quot;Angler&quot; hurled 25 rounds at a target area containing closely bunched buildings, radio towers, and a lighthouse. Although she claimed at least 20 hits, the large clouds of smoke and dust made a closer assessment of damage impossible.

Five days later, on 31 July, after an all-day close-in observation, &quot;Angler&quot; surfaced at dusk in a thick fog, off Tomakomai, on Hokkaidō, and fired 50 rounds at what looked like a thickly congested factory installation. On 1 August, &quot;Angler&quot; joined and in carrying out a coordinated gun action against boat sheds and boats; &quot;Angler&quot; firing 23 rounds of five-inch, 320 rounds of 40 mm and 300 rounds of 20 mm.

===Post-War===
&quot;Angler&quot; arrived at Midway on 9 August, and was there when hostilities ceased on 15 August. She sailed for Pearl Harbor on 26 August and paused there briefly before continuing on to the United States. The submarine transited the Panama Canal on 14 September, and called at New Orleans, Louisiana on 20 September. A month of leave and upkeep followed, and on 24 October, &quot;Angler&quot; got underway for Jacksonville, Florida. She continued on to Newport to unload her torpedoes on 2 November, and arrived at New London on 6 November. &quot;Angler&quot; sailed to Portsmouth, New Hampshire in February 1946 to begin deactivation. She returned to New London on 21 April, and was decommissioned there on 12 February.

Following her recommissioning on 2 April 1951, &quot;Angler&quot; held shakedown in the Caribbean Sea. She then began operations from her home port of New London. In October 1952, &quot;Angler&quot; was decommissioned and entered the General Dynamics Corporation yard at Groton, Connecticut, for overhaul and conversion. During the overhaul, one of her four diesel engines was removed to make room for advanced sonar equipment, part of her conversion to a &quot;hunter-killer submarine&quot;. She was redesignated SSK-240 in February 1953.

Upon completion of overhaul, &quot;Angler&quot; was recommissioned in September 1953 and rejoined the Atlantic Fleet. Following her shakedown in the West Indies from November 1953-March 1954, she returned to New London. She then operated along the East Coast and in the West Indies for the next two years, taking part in numerous Atlantic Fleet exercises, and spent the period from January through April 1956 undergoing overhaul at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. &quot;Angler&quot; made a training cruise to the West Indies, then returned to the East Coast. In October, she deployed to northern Europe and visited several ports in Britain before returning in December to New London.

&quot;Angler&quot; spent the first eight months of 1957 participating in exercises along the East Coast. On 27 September, she was underway for Europe to take part in NATO fleet exercises. She then visited Dieppe, France and the Isle of Portland, England before returning to New London. Her final operation of the year was a training cruise to Bermuda in November.

From 24 February-23 March 1958, &quot;Angler&quot; participated in Operation &quot;Springboard,&quot; held in the West Indies and Caribbean, following those evolutions with numerous training exercises. On 3 November, &quot;Angler&quot; once again entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for overhaul. Repairs were completed in March 1959, and the submarine resumed her schedule of operations and exercises along the East Coast. She also rendered services to the Submarine School, New London. In 1960, the ship reverted to her original designation, SS-240.

On 24 October 1962, &quot;Angler&quot; commenced her first deployment to the 6th Fleet and conducted operations in the Mediterranean Sea. In the course of her deployment, she visited ports in Spain, Italy, France, and Greece. She returned to New London on 6 February 1963 and resumed operations with the submarine school. In 1963, &quot;Angler&quot; was redesignated AGSS-240. For the remainder of her career, the submarine continued her pattern of periodic deployments to the Caribbean and West Indies, made midshipman and Naval Reserve training cruises, and operated in conjunction with the submarine school.

&quot;Angler&quot; was decommissioned on 1 April 1968 and was assigned to the Naval Reserve training program at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On 30 June 1971, she was redesignated IXSS-240. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 December 1971. Sold to the Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation, of New York City on 1 February 1974, she was removed from naval custody on 4 March 1974 to be broken up for scrap.

<text>Shaenon K. Garrity is an American webcomic creator and science-fiction author best known for her webcomics &quot;Narbonic&quot; and &quot;Skin Horse&quot;. She collaborated with various artists to write webcomics for the Modern Tales-family of webcomic subscription services in the early 2000s, and write columns for various comics journals. Since 2003, Garrity has done freelance editing for Viz Media on various manga translations.

==Early life==
Garrity was born in Pittsburgh in 1978. She enjoyed drawing and writing at a young age, and she began drawing comics in high school. As a youth correspondent, Garrity drew a comic strip for the kids&#x27; section of the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot;. She studied English at Vassar College, where she ran a comic strip in the college newspaper. Once out of college, Garrity worked as a front-desk secretary at Viz Media for three years while simultaneously creating &quot;Narbonic&quot;.

==Webcomics==
Shaenon Garrity conceived her daily webcomic &quot;Narbonic&quot; in college, after watching the science-fiction films &quot;City of Lost Children&quot; and &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie&quot; back-to-back. She began posting her webcomic, about the evil mad scientist Helen Narbon and her minions, shortly after moving to San Francisco in July 2000. She initially advertised her webcomic to her family, friends, and her old Usenet group, and she submitted her website to major search engines. She also submitted &quot;Narbonic&quot; to the webcomic portal Keenspot, but it was rejected. Garrity had no plans to profit from her work, but she was curious how far her readership would grow. &quot;Narbonic&quot; audience grew slowly during its first year, but shot up significantly in 2001, hitting Garrity with steep bandwidth charges.

&quot;Narbonic&quot; was part of the launch line-up of Joey Manley&#x27;s webcomic subscription website Modern Tales in March 2002, and it remained the most popular feature on the website until she moved it to Webcomics Nation in 2006. In the following years, Garrity began several webcomics on Manley&#x27;s subscription services. When the platform Girlamatic launched, Manley and Lea Hernandez suggested she do a &quot;Narbonic&quot; spin-off featuring a child version of the character Mell, one of Helen Narbon&#x27;s minions. Garrity initially collaborated with artist Vera Brosgol to write the webcomic &quot;Li&#x27;l Mell&quot; for Girlamatic, and this webcomic later had a rotating roster of artists. For the platform Graphic Smash, Garrity collaborated with artists Robert Stevenson and Roger Langridge to write &quot;More Fun&quot;, and, for Serializer, Garrity worked with Tom Hart to write &quot;TrunkTown&quot;. After the launch of Webcomics Nation, Garrity wrote &quot;Smithson&quot;, drawn by Brian Moore and Roger Langridge. Garrity became content editor for Modern Tales in 2006. She revived the long-form webcomic section of the website and worked on implementing Project Wonderful.

Garrity concluded &quot;Narbonic&quot; on December 31, 2006, and Garrity began a commentated &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; of the webcomic online a few years later. During &quot;Narbonic&quot; run, Garrity was contacted by &quot;Narbonic&quot; reader Jeffrey Wells, who was writing a story that shared some elements with Garrity&#x27;s webcomic. In 2008, Garrity and Wells launched the daily webcomic &quot;Skin Horse&quot;. Telling the story of a top secret government agency that handles non-humans as armed social workers, &quot;Skin Horse&quot; was the most popular webcomic on Webcomics Nation until it was moved to its own website and GoComics. The first volumes of &quot;Skin Horse&quot; were published by a San Francisco Bay Area artist group, the Couscous Comics collective. &quot;Skin Horse&quot; concluded in 2022, and the last of its twelve print volumes was published.

In 2010, Garrity brought back &quot;Li&#x27;l Mell&quot; with a new storyline, this time collaborating with artist Cameron Nielson.

==Other work==
Garrity began volunteering at the Cartoon Art Museum in 2000, and she continued to work there throughout her webcomic career. Shortly after being laid off by Viz Media in 2003, Garrity began doing freelance editing work for the company. She edited &quot;One Piece&quot;, &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;, &quot;Ultimate Muscle&quot;, &quot;Knights of the Zodiac&quot;, and &quot;Tenchi Muyo&quot; for the English-language &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; magazine, and wrote reviews for the &quot;Animerica&quot; magazine. Garrity wrote for Marvel Comics in the mid-2000s, writing the 2005–2007 Marvel Holiday Specials. She was a regular contributor for &quot;Sequential Tart&quot;, &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, and &quot;Anime News Network&quot;.

Handling the localization of &quot;Case Closed&quot;, Garrity became responsible for official translations of the names of new characters. Garrity intended to write the book &quot;CLAMP in America&quot; in 2011, a volume which was intended to cover the history of the popular four-member manga creation team CLAMP. However, this release was cancelled due to copyright issues.

Garrity wrote short science-fiction stories in &quot;Strange Horizons&quot;, &quot;Lightspeed&quot;, and &quot;Machine of Death&quot;. In 2013, Garrity contributed to Dark Horse Comics&#x27; &quot;CBLDF Presents Manga: Introduction, Challenges, and Best Practices&quot;.

==Personal life==
Garrity is married to artist and Cartoon Art Museum curator Andrew Farago, and they moved to Berkeley, California in 2009. The two had a son in 2014.

==Awards==
Garrity won the 2005 Friends of Lulu &quot;Lulu of the Year&quot; award, alongside Kazu Kibuishi. In 2005, Garrity&#x27;s &quot;Narbonic&quot; won in the &quot;Outstanding Writing&quot; category of the Web Cartoonists&#x27; Choice Awards. During her spotlight panel at the 2022 Comic-Con International, Garrity received the Inkpot Award for Achievement in Comic Arts.

<text>Ruakura is a semi-rural suburb of Hamilton City, in the Waikato region of New Zealand. The University of Waikato is nearby.

The area lies to the east of urban Hamilton and to the west of State Highway 1B (a variant of State Highway 1 which avoids the urban area).

==Ruakura Agriculture Research Centre==

Waikato Agricultural College and Model Farm was set up in 1888, so that Ruakura is now synonymous with the Ruakura Agriculture Research Centre, the location of institutes such as AgResearch and Plant &amp; Food Research. Areas of AgResearch&#x27;s research at Ruakura include animal molecular biology (genomics and cloning), reproductive technologies, agricultural systems modelling, land management, dairy science, meat science, food processing technology and safety, and animal behaviour and welfare. Plant &amp; Food Research&#x27;s site in Hamilton is home to its blueberry nursery, its Bioengineering Group and its Food and Biological Chemistry laboratory. Work is also carried out on biological control agents and plant fertilizer (&quot;Ruakura solution&quot;). The Waikato region is a major contributor to New Zealand&#x27;s agricultural-based economy, and Ruakura has an important role in that industry.

The Ruakura Agriculture Research Centre is on land owned by the Waikato Tainui, to whom it was returned by the Crown as part of their 1995 Waikato Raupatu Land Settlement.

The Waikato Regional Council included a majority of the land at Ruakura in the proposed Regional Policy Statement (PWRPS) as a future employment area. The Hamilton City Council Proposed District Plan gave effect to the PWRPS incorporating the Ruakura structure plan.

Ruakura was west of Eureka and east of Claudelands. it was north of Mongaonui (or Mongonui), later renamed Newstead. When the line opened, Ruakura station was described as an island in a swamp, with no road connection. In 2020 reopening as a &quot;passenger rail Metro Station&quot; was put forward as a COVID-19 recovery scheme, as part of a $150m scheme to relay tracks to Cambridge.

<doc id="1068694" wikidata="Q5543581" url="?curid=1068694" title="George Pullen Jackson">
<text>George Pullen Jackson (1874–1953) was an American educator and musicologist. He was a pioneer in the field of Southern (U.S.) hymnody. He was responsible for popularizing the term &quot;white spirituals&quot; to describe the &quot;fasola&quot; singing.

==Early life==
George Pullen Jackson was born in 1874 in Monson, Maine. He graduated from Vanderbilt University in 1902. While in college, he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He received a Bachelor of Philosophy in 1904 and a PhD in 1911 from the University of Chicago.

==Career==
Jackson was an Assistant Professor of German at the University of South Dakota in the 1910s. By the 1930s, he had joined the faculty at his alma mater, Vanderbilt University. He was also a music critic for the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot;, and the president and manager of the Nashville Symphony Society.

Jackson argued that Tennesseans in the Antebellum South were &quot;far more musically active&quot; than after the war. He added that many people used to attend singing schools, and he blamed the lack of musical training on the radio, which discouraged people from learning to sing in the postbellum era.

Additionally, Jackson argued that Negro spirituals took their origin from poor whites who sang old folk songs from England.

During the 1940s, he studied the roots of anabaptist music (Amish and Mennonite). He proposed the now generally accepted view that the original tunes used in &quot;Der Ausbund&quot; hymnal were popular medieval melodies. &quot;Der Ausbund&quot; is still used by Amish groups and has the distinction of being the hymnal with a history of the longest continual use (1564 to the present; the latest edition being published in 1999).

The name Langton stems from &quot;long town&quot;, and is first attested in 1206, as &quot;Langeton&quot;. Matravers stems from the name of John Mautravers who owned the land there in 1281, and ultimately originates from the French &quot;mal traverse&quot;.

The Old Malthouse was a preparatory school for boys and, more recently, girls which was founded in 1906, but closed in 2007. Two other preparatory schools Durnford School and Spyway used to be located in the village. Both Durnford and Spyway were closed earlier; Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond novels, was educated at Durnford.

On 2 November 2022, the Ordnance Survey (OS) announced that the historic triple alignment of true, magnetic and grid north had made landfall in the village.

==Governance==
Langton Matravers is the major part of an electoral ward called Langton. This stretches south to the English Channel and includes Worth Matravers. The total population for the ward at the 2011 Census was 1,491. For governmental purposes, it lies within the Dorset unitary authority and the South Dorset constituency of the House of Commons; until 31 January 2020, it also lay within the South West England constituency of the European Parliament. The first Langton Matravers Parish Council was elected in 1894.

<text>Female economic activity is a common measure of gender equality in an economy. It is one of the numbers used by the UNDP in the calculation of the Human Development Index, but the numbers themselves are gathered by the International Labour Organization. It is a measure of women over the age of fifteen who are working or able to work as a percent of males. It is one of less accurate statistics gathered and is highly variable with regions and year to year within individual countries.

In general female economic activity is lowest in the Middle East and South Asia and highest in developed nations and sub-Saharan Africa. Even though, in Middle East and North Africa women at the age of 30 have more access to health and educational providers than their mothers, they still play a minor role in public, economic and political activities.

In the United States, women&#x27;s involvement in the economy has shifted from the 1890s to the 1970s. Women used to work in what were called &quot;pink collar&quot; jobs, such as teachers, librarians, and secretaries, but now have careers involving investment like lawyers, doctors, and corporate workers. Compared to men who have always been at a constant high level of employment rates, women are now increasing their numbers in the economy. However, the growth rate is not equal for different regions, e.g. Middle East and North Africa, South and Southeast Asia still cannot compare with other regions and show the lowest rates.

Abbreviated as FEAR, it is a proportion of female population aged fifteen years and above who furnish or are available to furnish, the supply of labor for production of goods and services in accordance with System of National Accounts (SNA).

<text>Longburton or Long Burton is a village in Dorset, England, three miles (5 km) south of Sherborne. It is sited on a narrow outcrop of Cornbrash limestone, at the western end of Blackmore Vale. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 470.

==History==
Medieval records show that Longburton belonged to the See of Sarum. In 1547, the Bishop of Salisbury granted the Manors of Long Burton and Holnest to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, the Protector. After his execution the manor was held by the Crown until it was granted to Sir Walter Raleigh. In 1594 Raleigh conveyed Long Burton and Holnest to John Fitzjames, who was already lord of the neighbouring manor of Leweston. The Fitzjames family lived at Redlynch near Bruton, Somerset. Their manors were sequestrated in 1645, but were returned at the Restoration.

To the north of the church chancel is a small chapel that was added by Leweston Fitzjames (d. 1638), who installed effigies of his parents Sir John Fitzjames (d. 1625) and Joan (d. 1602). Another monument contains similar effigies of three members of the Winston family from Standish in Gloucestershire: these are the parents and grandfather of Leweston&#x27;s wife Eleanor. Eleanor&#x27;s younger sister, Sarah, married John Churchill and was the grandmother of John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, whose line included Sir Winston Churchill. The Christian name Winston had become a family name to commemorate Sarah Winston. Sir John Fitzjames (d. 1670), son of Leweston, and his wife Margaret Stephens are buried beneath a tablet on the floor immediately west of the church altar.

When Sir John Fitzjames Junior died in 1699, the manor passed jointly to his sisters, Grace and Catherine and ultimately was settled on Grace&#x27;s husband Sir George Strode until he died in 1702. The manor then passed to his only daughter Grace Strode who subsequently married and was widowed before dying intestate in 1729. In the absence of her will the terms of her father&#x27;s will of 1700 applied and matters were so complex that Parliament appointed a Commission to determine how the Strode estates should be divided between Grace&#x27;s daughters. It took seventeen years before an Act of Parliament was passed to agree the apportionment of the lands between the two heirs, one of whom had since died. The dead daughter&#x27;s son received her portion and Long Burton manor passed to the dowager Countess of Hertford. She died in 1754 and her estates passed to Sir Hugh Smithson, husband of her only daughter Elizabeth, and subsequently Duke of Northumberland. His family sold the manor to Anthony Chapman, who built an elegant small mansion at Long Burton, which was later owned by Mark Davis. Chapman&#x27;s widow sold the manor to J.S.W. Sawbridge in 1826. Sawbridge married Sarah Frances Erle-Drax, the heiress of Charborough, and assumed her surname.

With the coming of the railway to Sherborne in the mid nineteenth century the village developed rapidly as a dormitory and most of the present housing stock was built as part of the railway boom. The village housing is mostly either seventeenth-century, late nineteenth-century or late twentieth-century.

The present parish is a tithing of the larger medieval parish of Long Burton. The name derives from , a fortified manor, and , a homestead or village. It was distinguished as Long Burton (presumably to distinguish it from the other four Burtons in Dorset) because of the length of its main street. The present form of the name as a single word seems to have arisen in the late nineteenth century. However, writing in 1980, author and Dorset resident Roland Gant insisted on using Long Burton, and commented that the village was &quot;irritatingly often now spelled &#x27;Longburton&#x27; on road signs, which to me changes its pronunciation in line with Warburton&quot;. The village is still recorded as Long Burton on the 1889 Ordnance Survey map of the area.
==Governance==
Longburton and the surrounding area is a major part of Cam Vale electoral ward which also covers the villages of Alweston, Holwell and Leigh. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 2,000. This ward is one of 32 that comprise the West Dorset parliamentary constituency.

==Geography==
Longburton village is a ribbon development along the A352 road, which was the turnpike between Dorchester and Sherborne. A set of traffic lights controls the passage of vehicles between stone cottages sited close to the road.

Longburton parish covers approximately , measuring approximately 3 km long north to south and about half that west to east. The neighbouring parishes are Castleton, Folke, Holnest, Leweston, and North Wootton.

The surrounding landscape is typical Dorset pasture with small fields divided by hedgerows and small patches of woodland. Away from the narrow strip of Cornbrash limestone on which the village sits, the underlying geology of the vicinity is Oxford Clay, which here results in moist and fertile soil that yields rich dairy pastures. Although the dominant industry is dairy farming, other local industries have included stone-quarrying and more recently land has been given over to orchards. In the early eighteenth century at least five attempts were made to find coal in the area; this was documented by the local vicar William Sharpe.

==Demography==
The population of the village rose regularly from 216 in 1801 to 339 in 1851,and then fell steadily until in 1931 it was only 241. In 1971 the inhabitants numbered 292 and during that decade increased by 44% to 420 by 1981 when a small housing estate was built on the south western edge of the village. The population has since increased slowly from 414 in 1991 to 435 in 2001 and 470 in 2011.

==Architecture==
The parish church is dedicated to Saint James the Great. It was originally a chapelry of Sherborne Minster. Most of it was built in the fifteenth century although the square tower was built local of rubble with freestone dressings about two hundred years earlier. The tower&#x27;s upper storey has a crenellated parapet which was added as part of the main fifteenth-century development. The tower holds six bells with the tenor tuned to G#. Local superstition had it that if the tenor bell sounded dull someone in the parish would die within the week.

West Hall is a Grade I listed Elizabethan manor house to the north of the village. It was owned by the Hymerford and Moleyn families, and later by the 17th century MP Thomas Chafe. In the 20th century, the house was used by the Royal Army Medical Corps.

The seventeenth-century houses in the village are traditional two-storeyed Dorset cottages, and some retain their thatched roofs. After the Second World War some bungalows were built in the heart of the village. Burton House, just north of the church, is a modern building incorporating a mixture of decorations and structural elements of different periods from all over Dorset. Set apart from the village is Leweston Farm, which may have been the old Long Burton manor house. The farm also has a late seventeenth-century five-bay barn.

Two substantial buildings mark the southern extent of the village on opposite sides of the road. The Methodist chapel built in 1878 stands to the East and the now disused Temperance Hall built in 1907 stands to the West.

==Records in Dorset County Records Office, Dorchester==
The Longburton parish registers begin in 1589 (marriages and burials) or 1590 (baptisms). The latter continue without gaps to 1865. Marriages are likewise complete to 1842, except for the one year 1812. Burials are missing for 1797–1601 and 1804, and have not been deposited after 1812. There are banns for 1824–45 and 1869–1940. There is a printed copy of the register to 1812, while typescripts are available for the whole register for 1813–1837, burials being extended to 1865. Churchwardens&#x27; accounts cover a remarkable span from 1634 to 1897 with just two short gaps. Accounts for the Overseers of the Poor survive for 1681–1759; there are six settlement orders, nine removal orders and one bastardy order.

A court book of the Manors of Long Burton and Holnest survives for 1523 to 1609. There are deeds for various properties from 1705 onwards in the archive D/FFO in the County Record Office. One dated 1702/3 relates to property in Long Burton, Little Burton and Leweston.

The tithe map of 1843–4 has an attached apportionment. Another map of 1768 shows lands in Long Burton and Holnest. A facsimile record of land given for a school by J.S.W.S. Erle-Drax, Lord of the Manor, has also been deposited. The school records include log-books for 1872–1900 and 1920–1949 and an attendance register for 1853–1887. Minutes and accounts of the Longburton parish council are deposited for 1894 to 1935.

==Notable residents==

The most notable resident of Longburton was Reverend Charles Herbert Mayo, the antiquarian who was vicar of Longburton from 1872 to 1912. More prosaically, in 1664 the probate inventory of the late Henry Gumbleton, village blacksmith was valued at £18-13-08.

<text>Gusto Records is a Nashville, Tennessee-based record company that specializes in reissuing and licensing recordings.

The catalogues that Gusto owns include King Records (except for recordings by James Brown), Starday, Scepter (except for recordings by Dionne Warwick, and the pre-RCA recordings of The Guess Who), Wand (except for recordings by The Kingsmen) Musicor, Chart (except for recordings by Lynn Anderson, whose catalog is owned by Sony Music Entertainment, and a few other artists who bought their own masters), Federal, Audio Lab, Ovation, Step One, Atteiram, and others. Gusto is believed to maintain one of the largest independently owned collection of record masters.

==History==
Gusto was founded in 1973 by Gayron &quot;Moe&quot; Lytle and songwriter Tommy Hill, who owned the Stop Records label. Tommy Hill operated the business while Moe was still in St. Louis. In 1974, Moe Lytle moved to Nashville and bought Tommy Hill&#x27;s interest in the company, along with the Stop Records label shortly thereafter. It acquired Starday-King Records from Tennessee Recording &amp; Publishing, which was owned by Freddy Bienstock, Hal Neely, Jerry Leiber, and Mike Stoller in 1975. In the late-1970s, Gusto purchased the Chart and Ovation catalogs. Gusto acquired the Musicor, Scepter, and Wand catalogues from the bankrupt Springboard International Records in 1984, along with many masters that were recorded by Springboard itself. Gusto also acquired Little Darlin&#x27; Records and a large classical catalog in the same purchase. The Indigo and Audiograph masters were added in the 1980s. The company’s most recent acquisitions were the Mel Street masters, the Step One master catalog, and the Atteiram masters, which included a large bluegrass catalog.

Gusto owns the longest-operating recording studio in Nashville. Known as Starday-King Sound Studios, it opened in 1952 and was used until 2000 for transferring some of the older style masters to other formats and some new recordings.

Gusto first signed artist Red Sovine in 1974. Moe Lytle was a fan of Sovine&#x27;s and has claimed that one of the main reasons he purchased the Starday/King masters was so that he could own and market the Red Sovine catalog. The first huge hit recorded and distributed by Gusto Records was Red Sovine&#x27;s single &quot;Teddy Bear&quot;, which was released in 1976 using the Starday label and rose to No. 1 on the charts in seven weeks, which was the fastest rise to the No. 1 position for any country music 45-rpm record released before or since (the Beatles did it on the pop chart in two weeks with &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;). The song rose to No. 40 on the pop chart. Most recently, Gusto Records released new material recorded by Porter Wagoner in the five years prior to his death.

Gusto Records does its own licensing, both master licensing and sync licensing, under the name Gusto Music Licensing.

== &quot;Louie Louie&quot; controversy ==

Among the master recordings Gusto acquired in the purchase of the Scepter/Wand catalog were those of the 1960s garage band the Kingsmen, including &quot;Louie Louie&quot;. In 1993, group members brought legal action against Gusto to have the Wand recordings returned, alleging they had not been paid royalties since 1968. On November 9, 1998, in a story that made national headlines, the Kingsmen were awarded ownership of their Wand recordings.

<text>Dan Heflin Kuykendall (July 9, 1924 – June 12, 2008) was an American politician and businessman who served as a United States Representative from Tennessee&#x27;s 8th and 9th congressional districts from 1967 until 1975. A member of the Republican Party, Kuykendall was the first Republican to be elected in the 8th district since 1920 and was the first to be elected in the 9th district since 1872.

==Early life and education==

Dan Heflin Kuykendall was born in Cherokee, Texas, on July 9, 1924. During World War II he served as a B-29 pilot from 1942 to 1945. In 1947 he graduated Texas A&amp;M University and moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in 1955 through employment with Procter &amp; Gamble as an executive. On July 6, 1951, he married Jacqueline Meyer and would later have four children with her.

== Career ==

===Early politics===

During the 1956 presidential election he volunteered for Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s presidential campaign and during the 1960 presidential election he volunteered for Richard Nixon&#x27;s presidential campaign. In 1962 he managed former city councilman Ed Davis&#x27; campaign for Congress in the 9th Congressional district and Davis came within only 1,200 votes of defeating 22-year incumbent Clifford Davis. From 1963 to 1964, he served as a co-chairman of the Shelby County Republican Party, which was returning to prominence after years of irrelevance. During the 1964 Republican presidential primaries he supported Senator Barry Goldwater.

In July 1963 he stated that he was interested in challenging Senator Albert Gore, Sr. in Tennessee&#x27;s 1964 Senate election and on September 6, 1963, the directors of the Republican Association of Memphis and Shelby County adopted a resolution urging Kuykendall to run for Senate either against Gore or to fill the vacancy created by Senator Estes Kefauver&#x27;s death. On February 6, 1964, he announced that he would seek the Republican nomination to run in the Senate election against Gore and would officially announce his candidacy on April 7. Despite Gore having won in 1958 in a landslide with 79.00% of the vote against the Republican 19.01%, Kuykendall received 46.38% of the vote to Gore&#x27;s 53.62% and in the simultaneous special election Howard Baker received 47.41% of the vote to Ross Bass&#x27;s 52.14% with both Democrats benefiting from the coattail effect of President Lyndon Johnson winning Tennessee with 55.50% of the vote.

===House of Representatives===

On March 12, 1966, he stated that he had no political plans outside the Ninth Congressional district, on April 26 he announced that he would challenge incumbent Representative George W. Grider, and on May 25 he formally announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the district. He won the Republican nomination without opposition and in the general election he narrowly defeated Grider with 52.16% of the vote.

He easily won reelection in the 1968 and 1970 elections by over 25% both times. During the 1968 presidential election he supported Richard Nixon and stated that &quot;a vote for Wallace is a vote for Humphrey&quot;.

After the 1970 United States census, Tennessee lost a congressional district and the General Assembly moved Kuykendall to the 8th congressional district with Republican areas in his former district being replaced with Democratic areas. He won reelection in 1972 elections against black pastor J. O. Patterson Jr., but by only 11.25%.

Kuykendall established himself as one of the House&#x27;s most conservative members and was known for being long-winded to the point of what many felt was verbosity, and as a consequence was given the derisive nickname &quot;The Tennessee Talking Horse&quot;. During his tenure he served on the Interstate and Foreign Committee and Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Transportation and in 1971 he cosponsored an attempt to impeach Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, but nothing came of it and Douglas retired in 1975.

====Watergate====

During the Watergate scandal and the ensuing impeachment process he defended President Richard Nixon. He blamed &quot;nonpoliticians&quot; for Watergate by placing blame onto people such as Attorney General John N. Mitchell, stated that those who supported impeachment were trying to lynch Nixon, and he agreed with Nixon&#x27;s decision to dismiss special prosecutor Archibald Cox. When the House decided to investigate the case for impeachment on October 23, 1973, Kuykendall came to the House floor with a noose and warned the other members against using lynch law tactics. However, on August 5, 1974, he stated that he would reexamine his position on impeachment due to Nixon having refused to hand over evidence to the House and stated that he would support impeachment shortly before Nixon&#x27;s resignation.

Following Vice President Spiro Agnew&#x27;s resignation the House voted on House Minority Leader Gerald Ford&#x27;s confirmation as vice president to President Nixon and all House Republicans vote in unanimity including Kuykendall. When the House voted on former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s confirmation as vice president to President Gerald Ford, he was one of 153 Republicans to vote for him.

In 1974, the Democrats nominated state Representative Harold Ford, a young member of a prominent black funeral-directing family in Memphis whose political involvement dated to the days of E. H. Crump. Ford staged a tremendous get-out-the-vote campaign in the Memphis black community. He also received the support of many whites angered by Kuykendall&#x27;s continued support of Nixon in the midst of Watergate. On election night, it looked like Kuykendall had managed to hold onto the seat by a razor-thin margin. However, Ford&#x27;s supporters found eight ballot boxes purported to have been in the dumpster of the then all-white Shelby County Election Commission. When those ballots were counted, it was enough for Ford to unseat Kuykendall by only 744 votes—one of the closest races of the 1974 cycle. Since then, Republicans have never come close to retaking the Memphis-area district. The district was renumbered the 9th District again in the 1980s round of redistricting, as Tennessee regained a House seat due to its population now growing at a rate above, rather than below, the national average. At that time, it was drawn as a majority-black district, and Republicans have lost interest in the seat.

===Post-House career===

As is the case with many former members of Congress, Kuykendall stayed in the Washington, D.C., area and lived for many years in Bethesda, Maryland. In 2002, Kuykendall returned to the region and lived in Germantown, a suburb of Memphis.

Kuykendall died on June 12, 2008, after a long illness at age 83.

<text>Lytchett Matravers is a large village and civil parish in Dorset, England. The 2011 census recorded the parish as having 1,439 households and a population of 3,424.

==Etymology==
The name of Lytchett Matravers is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Lichet&quot;. This name comes from the Brittonic words that survive in modern Welsh as (&quot;grey&quot;) and (&quot;wood&quot;). The name is first attested with addition of &quot;Matravers&quot; in 1280, in forms such as &quot;Lichet Mautravers&quot;. This was used to distinguish the settlement from Lytchett Minster and arose because, following the Norman Conquest, William I granted the manor to Hugh Maltravers, attested as the owner of the estate in the Domesday book. (Prior to the Conquest, a Danish lord called Tholf held the manor.)

An alternative derivation of the name &quot;Lytchett&quot; is from the word lynchet or linchet, which is an earth terrace found on the side of a hill. Lynchets are a feature of ancient field systems of the British Isles. Such terraces were visible in Garden Wood above the Church and Manor in the 1970&#x27;s.

==History==
Following the Norman Conquest, the Maltravers family held the village for about 300 years, until the Black Death reduced the population in the second half of the 14th century. The surviving villagers deserted the original village, sited around the church and manor house, and resettled further up the hill.

The remaining female heir to the title &quot;in abeyance&quot;, Eleanor Maltravers, inherited the title on the death of her sister, Joan, in or after 1376. She married John FitzAlan, 1st Baron Arundel on 17 February 1359.

The estate was later bought from the Arundels by the Trenchard family, who demolished the former manor house and built a new one that incorporated, amongst other facilities, a ballroom and a tower. When the Trenchard family foundered in 1829, the manor passed to the Dillon family who added the name Trenchard to their own. However, the newly titled Dillon-Trenchards chose not to occupy the newer manor house. The Dillon-Trenchards left Lytchett Matravers in the latter part of the 20th century.
Lytchett Matravers has developed over the 20th century from a settlement of mostly scattered cottages with large curtilages to a village with a moderately high housing density. In the 1920s and 1930s there was some ribbon development on the main access road. This continued into the 1950s with the addition of small scale infill housing behind. Since the 1970s development has mainly been through housing estates. In the 1960s and early 1970s many of the original cob and thatch cottages were either demolished or greatly altered, but there are still 13 thatched cottages in the village, some of which retain their original curtilage. Recently some modern developments have included a smattering of thatched houses in an acknowledgement of the local vernacular architecture.

==Governance==
There is a Lytchett Matravers and Upton electoral ward for Dorset Council. It is larger than the parish, extending westward towards Bulbury. The 2011 Census recorded the ward&#x27;s population as 3,747.

==Geography==
The village is on higher ground in a landscape of small valleys, open fields and woods about northwest of Poole and a similar distance north of Wareham. The elevation gives views from many parts of the village to Poole Harbour and the Purbeck hills. The village is in the Green Belt of the South East Dorset conurbation. To the northeast are the plantations of Henbury and Stoney Down and to the south the woods of Lytchett Heath.

The village is on what until 150 years ago was the main road between Poole and Dorchester. There is some through traffic through the village between the main A350 and A35.

==Religion==
The parish church of St Mary the Virgin is northwest of the modern village, on the former site of the village deserted in the 14th century. The church&#x27;s west tower is 13th-century, the chancel is 14th-century and the rest of the church was rebuilt in about 1500. It is a Grade I listed building. The west tower has six bells, the oldest of which was cast in about 1400.

Near the middle of the village is a Methodist church, which is a member of Poole Bay Methodist Circuit.

==Amenities==

Lytchett Matravers has two pubs: the Chequers Inn and the Rose and Crown.

The village Primary School is situated in a large modern building on the Wareham Road, having moved from its former home near the central crossroad. The village school dates from around 1837 when about 30 children attended a National Society School built near to the higher crossroads. In 1875 education for all children became compulsory and the Board School was built on land on the opposite corner of the crossroads. Children were taught there for 115 years before the present school for over 400 pupils was built and opened in 1992. 
Secondary education is provided by Lytchett Minster Secondary School.

The Village Hall was built in 1972, to replace the ailing Victory Hall and has magnificent views over Poole Harbour. The hall is a central meeting place for all kinds of village activities including many sports and keep-fit classes.

The Lytchett Martavers Parish Council also maintain a small office there.

The Lytchett Matravers Youth Hall and Cadet Hall are situated between 72e &amp; 74 High Street. The Youth Hall originated in the 1950s and has undergone extensive regeneration with the benefit of a grant from the Dorst Council and the UK Shared Prosperity Fund/Rural England Prosperity Fund in 2024. The Youth Club now runs every Tuesday evening with many other youth and community activities throughout the week, including a Warm Welcome cafe on a Wednesday. The Cadets also run sessions every Monday and Thursday 

The Sports Pavilion and Scout Hut sit centrally off the High Street between the lower and upper car parks and overlook the large, tree lined recreation ground. The Rec features a central football area, plus the Rocket Park children&#x27;s play area and a Skate Park and dog-exercise area. The Sports Pavilion is home to the Lytchett Matravers Football Club who run soccer clubs for minis and youth in the village. The Scout Hut is home to Beavers, Cubs and Scouts, and is available to hire for community activities.

The Lion Hall and old British Legion buildings were demolished to make way for new housing estates 

==Economy==
A small number of businesses run in or from the village. Most of those of working age however, commute elsewhere in Dorset for their work, chiefly to Poole and Bournemouth.

==Sport and recreation==
There is a cricket club in the village. For children there are Beavers, Cubs, Brownies, Scouts, Guides, an Army Cadet Force Detachment and a Youth Parish Council.

Lytchett Matravers Detachment (The Rifles), Dorset Army Cadet Force, is located opposite the Chequers Inn. The current centre was opened in September 1995, and is to this day home to a successful ACF unit.

The monthly &quot;Parish Magazine&quot; includes articles on the activities of 12 clubs and societies in the village. 

For many years, the village has held a traditional carnival in June.

==Twinning==
The village is twinned with the French village of Les Pieux, from Cherbourg.

<text>Cuprates are a class of compounds that contain copper (Cu) atom(s) in an anion. They can be broadly categorized into two main types:

1. Inorganic cuprates: These compounds have a general formula of . Some of them are non-stoichiometric. Many of these compounds are known for their superconducting properties. An example of an inorganic cuprate is the tetrachloridocuprate(II) or tetrachlorocuprate(II) (), an anionic coordination complex that features a copper atom in an oxidation state of +2, surrounded by four chloride ions.

2. Organic cuprates: These are organocopper compounds, some of which having a general formula of , where copper is in an oxidation state of +1, where at least one of the R groups can be any organic group. These compounds, characterized by copper bonded to organic groups, are frequently used in organic synthesis due to their reactivity. An example of an organic cuprate is dimethylcuprate(I) anion .

One of the most studied cuprates is , a high-temperature superconducting material. This oxide cuprate has been the subject of extensive research due to its ability to conduct electricity without resistance at relatively high temperatures.

The term &#x27;cuprate&#x27; originates from &#x27;cuprum&#x27;, the Latin word for copper. It is primarily used in the context of oxide materials, anionic coordination complexes, and anionic organocopper compounds, reflecting the diverse roles of copper in chemistry. The term is mainly used in three contexts: oxide materials, anionic coordination complexes, and anionic organocopper compounds.

==Oxide cuprates==

One of the simplest oxide-based cuprates is potassium cuprate(III) . This species can be viewed as the salt of the polyanion . As such the material is classified as an oxide cuprate. This dark blue diamagnetic solid is produced by heating potassium peroxide and copper(II) oxide in an atmosphere of oxygen:

Other cuprates(III) of alkali metals are known; in addition, the structures of (caesium cuprate(III)) have been determined as well.

 was discovered first in 1952 by V. K. Wahl and W. Klemm, they synthesized this compound by heating copper(II) oxide and potassium superoxide in an atmosphere of oxygen.

It can also be synthesized by heating potassium superoxide and copper powder:

 reacts with the air fairly slowly. It starts to decompose at and its color changes from blue to pale green at . Its melting point is .

 (blue-black) and (black) can be prepared by reaction of rubidium oxide and caesium oxide with copper(II) oxide powders, at and in oxygen atmosphere, respectively. Either of them reacts with the air fast, unlike .

In fact, is a non-stoichiometric compound, so the more exact formula is and &quot;x&quot; is very close to 2. This causes the formation of defects in the crystal structure, and this leads to the tendency of this compound to be reduced. 

Sodium cuprate(III) can be produced by using hypochlorites or hypobromites to oxidize copper hydroxide under alkaline and low temperature conditions.
:

Cuprates(III) are not stable in water, and they can oxidize water as well.

Sodium cuprate(III) is reddish-brown, but turns black gradually as it decomposes to copper(II) oxide. In order to prevent decomposition, it must be prepared at low temperature in the absence of light.

==Coordination complexes==
Copper forms many anionic coordination complexes with negatively charged ligands such as cyanide, hydroxide, and halides, as well as alkyls and aryls.
===Copper(I)===
Cuprates containing copper(I) tend to be colorless, reflecting their d10 configuration. Structures range from linear 2-coordinate, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral molecular geometry. Examples include linear and trigonal planar . Cyanide gives analogous complexes but also the trianionic tetracyanocuprate(I), . Dicyanocuprate(I), , exists in both molecular or polymeric motifs, depending on the countercation.

===Copper(II)===

Cuprates containing copper(II) include trichlorocuprate(II), , which is dimeric, and square-planar tetrachlorocuprate(II), , and pentachlorocuprate(II), . 3-Coordinate chlorocuprate(II) complexes are rare.

Tetrachlorocuprate(II) complexes tend to adopt flattened tetrahedral geometry with orange colors.

Sodium tetrahydroxycuprate(II) () is an example of a homoleptic (all ligands being the same) hydroxide complex.

===Copper(III) and copper(IV)===
Hexafluorocuprate(III) and hexafluorocuprate(IV) are rare examples of copper(III) and copper(IV) complexes. They are strong oxidizing agents.

==Organic cuprates==

Cuprates have a role in organic synthesis. They are invariably Cu(I), although Cu(II) or even Cu(III) intermediates are invoked in some chemical reactions. Organic cuprates often have the idealized formulas and , both of which contain copper in an oxidation state of +1, where R is an alkyl or aryl. These reagents find use as nucleophilic alkylating reagents.

<text>Federal Records was an American record label founded in 1950 as a subsidiary of Syd Nathan&#x27;s King Records and based in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was run by famed record producer Ralph Bass and was mainly devoted to rhythm &amp; blues releases. The company also released hillbilly and rockabilly recordings from 1951 onward, e.g., &quot;Rockin&#x27; and Rollin&quot; by Ramblin&#x27; Tommy Scott on Federal 10003. Singles were published on both 45 and 78 rpm speed formats.

Federal issued such classics as The Dominoes&#x27; &quot;Sixty Minute Man&quot;, and &quot;Have Mercy Baby&quot; as well as Hank Ballard &amp; The Midnighters&#x27; &quot;Work with Me, Annie&quot; which was opposed immediately by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) but went on to be an enormous hit.

James Brown was touring with The Famous Flames when they were signed to Federal in 1956. The group&#x27;s first Federal single, &quot;Please, Please, Please,&quot; was a regional hit and eventually sold a million copies.

Between 1962 and 1965, Freddie King, one of the three blues &quot;kings&quot; (Freddie, B.B. and Albert), released a series of albums, mostly instrumentals, for Federal.

Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson was another artist on Federal Records.

<doc id="1068714" wikidata="Q512986" url="?curid=1068714" title="Vincent Pastore">
<text>Vincent Pastore (; born July 14, 1946) is an Italian American actor. Often cast as a mafioso, he is best known for his portrayal of Salvatore &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero on the HBO series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. He also made notable appearances in the HBO film Gotti (1996), Shark Tale (2004) and Revolver (2005). 

==Early life==
Pastore was born on July 14, 1946, to an Italian-American family in the Bronx, New York City, and grew up in New Rochelle, New York. Following his graduation from high school, he enlisted as a sailor in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam War and then attended Pace University for three years, before eventually going into the acting industry after befriending Matt and Kevin Dillon. On June 3, 2015, during an appearance on &quot;Good Day New York&quot;, Pastore said he was in the club business for close to 30 years, and got into acting in his 40s.

==Career==

===Acting===
Pastore has made a career of portraying Italian-American gangsters in film and television. He began with small parts in the 1990s, in films such as &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot;. In &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, he is briefly seen rolling a coat rack through the kitchen of the Bamboo Lounge and is credited as &quot;Vinny Pastore&quot; playing &quot;Man with Coat Rack&quot;. In &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot;, he portrays one of the friends of the Italian man that dances with Gail, whom Kleinfeld insults. He is listed in the credits as &quot;Vinny Pastore&quot; playing &quot;Copa Wiseguy.&quot;

Pastore got a bigger role in the comedy/crime film &quot;The Jerky Boys: The Movie&quot; (1995) as Tony Scarboni, one of the three gangsters and Lazarro&#x27;s (played by Alan Arkin) clients. In the 1996 HBO television movie &quot;Gotti&quot;, Pastore played the character of Angelo Ruggiero, alongside future &quot;The Sopranos&quot; cast members Tony Sirico, Frank Vincent, and Dominic Chianese. In 1999, Pastore got his biggest role in &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, where he played the character Salvatore &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero.

In addition to &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, he has appeared in &quot;Mickey Blue Eyes&quot;, &quot;Flodders in America&quot;, &quot;Two Family House&quot; (with &quot;The Sopranos&quot; castmates Michael Rispoli, Kathrine Narducci, Matt Servitto, Michele Santopietro, and Sharon Angela), &quot;Under Hellgate Bridge&quot;, &quot;Riding in Cars with Boys&quot;, &quot;Witness to the Mob&quot;, &quot;Deuces Wild&quot;, &quot;Made&quot;, &quot;Mafia!&quot;, &quot;The Hurricane&quot;, &quot;Serving Sara&quot;, &quot;American Cousins&quot;, &quot;A Tale of Two Pizzas&quot;, &quot;This Thing of Ours&quot;, &quot;Remedy&quot;, &quot;Shark Tale&quot;, &quot;Bachelor Party Vegas&quot;, &quot;The Family&quot;, &quot;Once Upon a Time in Brooklyn&quot;, &quot;Money Train&quot;, &quot;A Brooklyn State of Mind&quot;, &quot;The Deli&quot;, &quot;The Last Don II&quot;, &quot;Johnny Slade&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, and Guy Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;Revolver&quot;. He served as associate producer of the film &quot;Doughboys&quot;.

Pastore&#x27;s other television credits include &quot;Grounded for Life&quot;, character Vinnie Fellachio in &quot;Son of the Beach&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (various roles from 1992 to 1996), the soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, host of &quot;Repo-Men/Stealing for a Living&quot;, &quot;Ed&quot;, &quot;Queens Supreme&quot;, &quot;Vegas&quot;, &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot;, &quot;The Making of the Mob: New York&quot;, &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;, &quot;The Making of the Mob: Chicago&quot;, and an uncredited voice role in the television program &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; as Terry.

In 2007, Pastore starred in the independent feature film &quot;P.J.: A Journey of the Heart&quot;. In 2008, he joined the cast of &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Maximus Giambetti, father of two characters on the show; he once again plays a mobster. He had roles in 2008&#x27;s &quot;College Road Trip&quot; and &quot;Our Last Days as Children&quot;. He also starred in the 2008 film &quot;Dough Boys&quot;.

In 2009, Pastore starred in Pavaline Studio&#x27;s debut short film, &quot;Alienated&quot;. In 2010, he starred in the award-winning indie mob-comedy &quot;Pizza with Bullets&quot;. Pastore played Mayor Avenoso in the 2012 indie feature &quot;Surviving Family&quot;. He appears in the 2013 film &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with a Church Girl&quot;. In 2014, he appeared in the Broadway musical &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; as Nick Valenti.

===Reality shows===

Pastore lost 29 lb on the fourth season of the VH1 reality show &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;, which ran from August 6 to October 1, 2006.

On February 20, 2007, ABC announced that Pastore would participate in the fourth season of the American version of the competitive dance series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He withdrew from the competition after only one week. Pastore said that he found the necessary training and preparation too physically demanding. John Ratzenberger took his place in the competition.

Pastore was featured as a contestant on the January 2008 edition of &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;. In the second week, he participated in raising $52,286 by selling hot dogs on a Manhattan street for the Lustgarten Foundation for Pancreatic Research. In a task of selling Broadway show tickets, with Pastore as project manager, he led his team to raise $33,300 for charity. In the fifth week, he got into a faked, blow-out conflict with the project manager of the task, Piers Morgan, to see if he could get the women to let him on their team to spy on them. The episode had played out like an episode of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, with Pastore switching allegiances multiple times.

Pastore was deliberately &quot;ratted out&quot; to the women by Morgan in the end, to make Pastore look bad to the women. While Pastore and the men then lost their task, before Trump even lifted a finger to fire anyone that week, Pastore resigned from the show and Trump eventually accepted Pastore&#x27;s resignation after trying to convince him to stay. The show ended with a sequence based on the series finale of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, ending abruptly before Pastore could give the customary end-of-show interview in the cab. The week-6 episode begins with Pastore meeting his ex-wife Nancy in a restaurant and presenting her the check he received for being project manager for $50,000, in memory of her husband, Mitchell Burke&#x27;s memorial fund with the Lustgarden Foundation.

On July 1, 2008, Pastore appeared on NBC&#x27;s new show, &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot;, as part of a family team trying to win $50,000 for their favorite charity. He first competed, with his friends and family, against the cast of &quot;The Girls Next Door&quot;. Then, Pastore&#x27;s team made it to the finals against Kathie Lee Gifford&#x27;s family, but did not win. Pastore and his team picked up a $10,000 consolation prize for their charity, though, which is researching a cure for pancreatic cancer.

On April 8, 2011, Pastore and a business partner appeared on &quot;Shark Tank&quot; for an investment in &quot;Broccoli Wad&quot;, a product that holds money. All the &quot;Sharks&quot; wanted out, and Barbara Corcoran said, &quot;this is one of the dumbest things I&#x27;ve ever seen on this show&quot;. She later had the idea of putting Pastore&#x27;s face and name on the box, and labeling it &quot;Vinnie&#x27;s Wad&quot;. She offered $50,000 for a 40% stake in the company, and would give half of her ownership to Pastore in exchange for his name and face on the packaging; Pastore and his partner agreed. A year later, Pastore made an appearance on an episode of truTV&#x27;s &quot;World&#x27;s Smartest Inventions&quot; after his commercial for &quot;the Broccoli Wad&quot; aired on the show.

As of July 10, 2011, he appeared on the VH1 Marc Cronin-produced reality show &quot;Famous Food&quot;. In the show, contestants are assigned the task of opening a restaurant on the Sunset Strip. He appeared with Joseph R. Gannascoli on &quot;Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s 24 Hours to Hell and Back&quot; on January 21, 2020.

===Radio and podcast===
Pastore previously hosted &quot;The Wiseguy Show&quot; on Sirius Satellite Radio on the now defunct Raw Dog channel 104. Described as a &quot;weekly three-hour celebration of Italian-American culture.&quot; Produced by &quot;Sopranos&quot; co-star Steven Van Zandt, it aired on Wednesdays from 6–9 pm ET. He has also had stints as a radio host on the New Rochelle, New York, station WVOX in 2004 and 2012, with guest appearances in between.

In September 2020, Pastore started a podcast with Goumba Johnny called &quot;Fuhgeddaboudit with Vinny Pastore&quot;.

===Vincent Pastore&#x27;s Italian Sauce===
In 2019, Pastore launched a tomato sauce business under the name of Vincent Pastore&#x27;s Italian Sauce. The sauce is made with San Marzano tomatoes, is not GMO, and has no added sugar.

==Personal life==
Pastore is divorced. He was previously married to Nancy Berke with whom he has a daughter, Renee. He befriended Berke&#x27;s subsequent husband and donated the winnings from his stint on &quot;The Apprentice&quot; to a charity in his name. In 2014, Pastore was diagnosed with prostate cancer and served as the grand marshal of the Columbus Day parade in the Bronx. He currently lives on City Island.

The village is sited on Upper Greensand at the confluence of the River Frome with its tributary of equivalent size, the Hooke. Both these rivers have cut valleys into the surrounding chalk hills of the Dorset Downs. The A356 main road passes through the village. In the 2011 census the parish—which does not include the adjacent settlements of Frome Vauchurch and Tollerford— had a population of 1,119.

==History==
In 1086 in the Domesday Book, Maiden Newton was recorded as &quot;Newetone&quot;; it had 26 households, 7 ploughlands, of meadow and 2 mills. It was in Tollerford Hundred and the lord and tenant-in-chief was Waleran the Hunter.

Maiden Newton was the basis for the village of Chalk-Newton, South Wessex, in many of the works of Thomas Hardy. In the vicinity of the village is evidence of Roman occupation and early British settlements. The parish church of St Mary contains much Norman work, with additions from the 14th and 15th centuries. The shaft of the Village Cross is 15th century and is Grade II* listed. There is also the shaft of a medieval cross in the churchyard which is a scheduled monument. Maiden Newton is also home to one of the country&#x27;s oldest fire engines, restored and in full working order, the fire engine house built for it in 1842-3 is a grade II listed building.

Maiden Newton is in an electoral ward with the same name, which also contains much of the surrounding countryside including the villages of West Compton, Toller Fratrum, Toller Porcorum and Hooke. The population of this ward was 2,081 at the 2011 census.

==Transport==
The village is served by Maiden Newton railway station on the Heart of Wessex Line. There was also a railway line from Maiden Newton to Bridport which opened in 1857 and was extended to West Bay in 1884. The Bridport branch line was recommended for closure in the Beeching Report of 1963. By the time the line closed in 1975 it was the last remaining branch line in Dorset. Work is underway to turn the line into a footpath and cycle track.

The A356 passes through the village as does National Cycle Network Route 26.

Three long distance footpaths the Macmillan Way and the Wessex Ridgeway pass through the Village as does the shorter Frome Valley Trail.

<doc id="1068727" wikidata="Q1185036" url="?curid=1068727" title="Deluxe Records">
<text>Deluxe Records is the record label of German hip-hop artist Samy Deluxe.

== History ==

After Hamburg label &quot;Eimsbush&quot; went bankrupt in 2003, &quot;Dynamite Deluxe&quot; member Samy Deluxe founded a new label within the same year called &quot;Deluxe Records&quot;. At first, it was part of &quot;Capitol Records&quot; which is owned by &quot;EMI&quot;. The first artists besides Samy Deluxe himself were the rap group &quot;Headliners&quot; and rapper &quot;Illo&quot;. To make them known and to help distributing mixtapes and merchandise, Samy founded the branch &quot;Hamburgs Finest&quot;. Starting off on the internet, &quot;Hamburgs Finest Mixtape Vol. 4 - So Deluxe So Glorious&quot; was the first mixtape to retail. 2005 compilation album &quot;Deluxe Records - Let&#x27;s Go&quot;, together with the &quot;Let&#x27;s-Go-Tour&quot;, helped introducing the label to further audience.

In 2006, five other artists signed contracts with &quot;Deluxe Records&quot;. They were Munich rapper &quot;Ali A$&quot;, Ruhr Area artists Manuellsen and Snaga &amp; Pillath as well as Cologne rapper &quot;Blade&quot;.

On February 12, 2007, an internet show called &quot;Deluxe Zoom&quot; started broadcasting live performances and backstage footage of the label&#x27;s artists. The episodes appeared at irregular intervals and today, no more episodes will be produced.

In July 2007, &quot;Deluxe Records&quot; broke away from &quot;Capitol Records/ EMI&quot; and is now an independent label distributed over &quot;Groove Attack&quot;. Solely Same Deluxe&#x27;s albums will be released over &quot;Capitol Records&quot;. In December 2007, rapper TUA, formerly signed on &quot;Royal Bunker&quot;, joined &quot;Deluxe Records&quot;. On March 14, 2008, Snaga &amp; Pillath broke up with Deluxe Records due to misunderstandings relating to business. Manuellsen also left the label in 2008. Illo, who quit his rap career, and Blade also followed in the same year.

As of now, Deluxe Records consists of Samy Deluxe, Ali A$ and TUA. In December 2008, they released a sampler with the title &quot;Liebling, ich habe das Label geschrumpft&quot;. It is translated &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Label&quot;, which obviously is a parody of the motion picture &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; due to the cut of signed artists on the label.

<doc id="1068732" wikidata="Q831335" url="?curid=1068732" title="Bethlehem Records">
<text>Bethlehem Records was an American jazz independent record label, founded by Gus Wildi in 1953.

==History==
Bethlehem is remembered for its jazz releases from the 1950s. Producers included Creed Taylor and Teddy Charles. Bethlehem released the first albums recorded by singers Chris Connor (the dual releases &quot;Chris Connor Sings Lullabys for Lovers&quot; and &quot;Chris Connor Sings Lullabys of Birdland&quot;) in 1954, Nina Simone (&quot;Little Girl Blue&quot;) in 1958, and singer/actress Julie London. Julie London recorded four songs that were released on the EP &quot;Julie London&quot;, and they were later added to the compilation LP &quot;Bethlehem&#x27;s Girlfriends&quot; in 1955, which also featured Chris Connor and Carmen McRae. Bethlehem recorded the debut album by Marilyn Moore and the album &quot;Somebody Loves Me&quot; by Jerri Winters, in addition to many modern jazz musicians including Howard McGhee, Herbie Nichols, Pat Moran McCoy, and Oscar Pettiford.

In 1958, Bethlehem began a distributing deal with King Records. In 1962, Bethlehem Records was sold and absorbed by King Records. After Syd Nathan died in 1968, King was acquired by Starday Records and relaunched as Starday and King Records. It was purchased in 1970 by Lin Broadcasting and in 1972 by Tennessee Recording &amp; Publishing, until acquired by Gusto Records in 1974. At that time, Bethlehem was purchased by the Cayre brothers&#x27; Salsoul Records, who initially intended to release its back catalog for inexpensive 8-track tapes in the 1970s. By 1993, the Bethlehem name was revived as Bethlehem Music Company, although Salsoul is often used as an imprint. The Verse Music Group obtained its licensing in 2010. In 2015 BMG acquired the catalog of Verse Music, including the Bethlehem label.

During 2013–2014, Verse and Naxos reissued the 1950s catalogue on LP, CD, and digital download. This included music by Art Blakey, Chris Connor, Paula Castle, John Coltrane, Dexter Gordon, Nina Simone, Mel Tormé, and Zoot Sims.

=== Selected acquisitions ===
In 1956, Period Records sold its jazz LP catalog (10 disks) to Bethlehem. Production of all its jazz recordings was supervised by Leonard Feather. Several of the Period recordings had been previously released by Jazztone for mail-order club release.

==Discography==

===BCP 1000 Series===
The BCP 1000 Series of 10 inch LP records commenced in September 1954 and ran until July 1955 when the label switched to 12 in LP releases. 
===BCP 12-Inch &quot;Deluxe&quot; Series===
The BCP &quot;Deluxe&quot; Series of 12 inch LP records commenced in 1955 and ran until 1960. Early releases consisted of reissues of 10 inch albums from the BCP 1000 Series.

In the move to create the BCP 6000 series in the fall of 1956, Bethlehem removed three original recordings from the deluxe series and replaced them with later recordings. These are noted in the table with both releases shown.
===5000 series===
The 5000 series of 12 inch LP records commenced in 1957 but only released six albums.
===6000 series===
The 6000 series of 12 inch LP records commenced in 1956 and ran until 1964.

<doc id="1068735" wikidata="Q1392676" url="?curid=1068735" title="Ivan Albright">
<text>Ivan Le Lorraine Albright (February 20, 1897 – November 18, 1983) was an American painter, sculptor and print-maker most renowned for his self-portraits, character studies, and still lifes. Due to his technique and dark subject matter, he is often categorized among the Magic Realists and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;master of the macabre&quot;.

From a family of artists and artisans, Albright emerged on the American art scene in the 1930s and established a reputation as one of the most enigmatic of the American Realists. He shocked, awed and upset the viewing public through his emphasis on the fragility of the body, flesh and the human condition with such works as &quot;The Lineman&quot; (1928), &quot;That Which I Should Have Done I Did Not Do (The Door)&quot; (1931), and &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1943). His work to highlight the minute detail and texture of every surface often required him to spend years or decades on a single painting.

While Albright&#x27;s works can be found in museums throughout the United States, the most important repository of his works is at the Art Institute of Chicago.

== Life ==

Before the birth of Ivan Le Lorraine and his identical twin brother Malvin Marr Albright, the Albright family (formerly the &quot;Albrecht&quot; family) was already known for artwork and craftsmanship. Ivan&#x27;s paternal great-great-grandfather Andreas Albrecht was a master gunsmith in Thuringia, Germany, a family trade passed down to Ivan&#x27;s grandfather Zachariah. Likewise, Ivan&#x27;s father Adam Emory Albright was an Impressionist painter and student of Thomas Eakins who built his reputation on landscapes and idealized paintings of children.

=== Youth and education (1897–1925) ===
Ivan and Malvin were born in 1897 near Chicago in North Harvey, Illinois, to Adam Emory Albright and Clara Wilson Albright. Through their youth and until the two were age eleven, their father would use the boys as models in his paintings. Adam likewise began to teach the two to draw at age eight: This included formal Eakins-esque drawing lessons and regular visits to the Art Institute of Chicago. Through their father, the boys were introduced to several prominent American Impressionists and Realists including Childe Hassam, Robert Henri, William Glackens, Maurice Prendergast, Edmund Tarbell and John Twachtman. As Michael Croydon, Ivan&#x27;s biographer, describes, these experiences laid the foundation for Ivan and his brother&#x27;s later careers as painters.

Ivan&#x27;s formal education and career prospects in his youth and early adulthood were relatively erratic. His family moved frequently due to his father&#x27;s career and it wasn&#x27;t until 1910 that they settled in Hubbard Woods where Ivan and Malvin could attend New Trier High School. By 1915 Ivan entered the College of Liberal Arts of Northwestern University, which he failed out of. His brother enrolled at the same school shortly after. In 1916 he began to study at the University of Illinois at Urbana, at the time considering careers in architecture or chemical engineering. It was not until 1918, after a family painting trip to Caracas, Venezuela, that Ivan began to take seriously the possibility of becoming an artist. That same year he publicly exhibited his first work – a watercolor study of the trees hear his home in Hubbard Woods entitled &quot;The Oaks in Winter&quot; – at the Art Institute of Chicago&#x27;s Annual Watercolor exhibition. The entry of the United States into World War I likewise disrupted his early adult life as both he and his brother were enlisted in the United States Army as part of the Medical Corps of the American Expeditionary Forces. While stationed in Nantes, France between 1918 and 1919, Albright produced at least eight sketchbooks of medical drawings illustrating surgeries and wounds in graphite and watercolor. While Albright was not yet an accomplished draftsman, art historians and critics often cite these illustrations as the catalyst of his interest in the fragility of the flesh and humanity for those suffering.

After briefly working in architecture and advertising, in 1920 both he and his brother entered the Art Institute of Chicago. While Malvin studied sculpture, Ivan studied painting – each receiving standard, academic training in line with the institute&#x27;s traditional philosophy. He stayed there until he graduated in 1923, having exhibited &quot;The Philosopher&quot; (1922) and receiving Faculty Honorable Mention in both Life and Portrait Painting. Following his time at the Art Institute, he continued his studies at his father&#x27;s alma mater the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts with the intention of learning from George Bellows. Bellows was at the time, however, on sabbatical in Europe and so Ivan instead chose to move to the National Academy of Design to study under Charles Webster Hawthorne. Having completed his formal education, in 1925 he and his brother Malvin rented a studio in Philadelphia and his professional career as an artist began.

=== Early and mid-career (1925–1950) ===
Between 1925 and 1926, Albright&#x27;s mature &quot;baroque&quot; formal style began to emerge, and in many cases the general public was not prepared for his &quot;naked and uncompromising disclosure of the human condition.&quot; At the end of 1926, Albright and his brother spent three months in southern California near San Diego. While there, Albright produced several works that are representative of the maturity of his style, including &quot;I Walk To and Fro Through Civilization and I Talk As I Walk (Follow Me, The Monk)&quot; and &quot;I Drew a Picture in the Sand and the Water Washed It Away (The Theosophist)&quot;. By 1927, he and Malvin returned to Illinois where their father Adam had repurposed an old Methodist church for use as the Albright Gallery of Painting and Sculpture. Due to the brothers’ proximity for the next two years, Malvin adopted the pseudonym Zsissly to avoid confusion with Ivan. It was during the years at this studio that Ivan&#x27;s style began to cause controversy: In May 1928 his painting &quot;The Lineman&quot; was used as the cover for the trade magazine &quot;Electric Light and Power&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s readership thought the figure of the lineman was inaccurate and depressing; however, the painting was far more successful with art critics. Not long after, Albright began working on paintings that emphasized the microscopic quality of surface as much as baroque form, beginning with &quot;Woman&quot; (1928). When &quot;Woman&quot; was displayed at the Toledo Museum of Art in the 17th Exhibition of Selected Paintings by Contemporary American Artists in 1929, the painting was met with protesters who first had the painting removed, followed by another group protesting the painting&#x27;s removal. 

By 1931 and the onset of the Great Depression, Albright&#x27;s career was becoming established. In July of that year he exhibited fourteen paintings at the Art Institute of Chicago alongside fellow artists George and Martin Baer. That year as well, following the completion of the monumental &quot;Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida&quot; (1929–30), he began his decade-long obsession with his magnum-opus &quot;That Which I Should Have Done I Did Not Do (The Door)&quot; (1931). According to Albright, the Depression didn&#x27;t significantly affect his career because people didn&#x27;t buy his paintings &quot;whether times were good or bad, [so] it didn’t make a bit of difference.&quot; Indeed, his father&#x27;s success in art sales and real estate allowed Albright to live comfortably through the 1930s. Nonetheless, as did many other artists of the period, Albright participated in the Public Works of Art Project in Illinois. He was supposed to receive thirty-eight dollars per week in the program as a &quot;class A&quot; artist, but he maintained that he never received payment for his works. While in the project, Albright completed two paintings: &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; (1933–34) and &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; (1934). &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, now housed at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, in particular suited the PWAP&#x27;s expectations of images of hard-working Americans and is indeed thematically the closest of Albright&#x27;s paintings to those of the popular Regionalists. The subject nonetheless allowed Albright to display in the woman weariness and deterioration and thus to critique the positivist outlook of Regionalist artists like Grant Wood and Doris Lee.

The 1940s brought a series of changes in Albright&#x27;s life. His mother, Carla Wilson Albright, died on May 8, 1939, and heartbroken, he, Malvin and Adam spent the next several summers painting in Maine. During this period, in 1941, Albright completed work on &quot;The Door&quot; and began work on its de facto companion &quot;Poor Room – There Is No Time, No End, No Today, No Yesterday, No Tomorrow, Only the Forever and Forever and Forever Without End (The Window)&quot;, which Albright would continue to work on off-and-on for the next twenty-one years. Work on &quot;The Window&quot; experienced its first interruption when Ivan and Malvin were asked to paint for the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer adaptation of &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray,&quot; directed by Albert Lewin. For his portrait, Albright insisted on working under the same harsh lights as on the set, so to compensate he developed a new aggressive sensibility around color that would persist in his work into the 1970s. In 1946, Albright&#x27;s personal life changed even more when on August 27 he married Josephine Medill Patterson Reeve. After the marriage, the couple briefly moved to Billings, Montana and then south to Ten Sleep, Wyoming before returning to Chicago. Albright adopted Josephine&#x27;s children upon the marriage. In 1947 Ivan and Josephine had a son Adam Medill, and two years following in 1949, they had a daughter Blandina Van Etten.

=== Late career (1950–1983) ===
Portraiture and self-portraiture dominates much of the output from the final part of Albright&#x27;s career. The final interruption to Albright&#x27;s work on &quot;The Window&quot; was the commission of the &quot;Portrait of Mary Block&quot; (1955–57). Upon completing &quot;The Window&quot; in 1962, he immediately began work on a posthumous portrait of his father-in-law &quot;Captain Joseph Medill Patterson&quot; (1962–64), an officer during WWI and the founder of the &quot;New York Daily News.&quot; Likewise, while he and his family were vacationing in Aspen, Colorado in 1963, he executed the &quot;Aspen Self Portrait&quot;, objectively capturing the artist at age sixty-six.&quot;

The decades of the 1950s and 1960s featured few large-scale works by Albright, but did see him expand his horizons with travel. Between 1948 and 1964, Albright produced a number of oils and gouaches with western themes. This was in part because, through Josephine and her sister Alicia Patterson Guggenheim, the artist acquired partial ownership of a ranch in Dubois, Wyoming. The ranch was a fitting setting for a series of Western-themed artworks including &quot;Roaring Fork, Wyoming&quot; (1948)&quot;,&quot; &quot;The Purist&quot; (1949), &quot;The Wild Bunch (Hole in the Wall Gang)&quot; (1951), &quot;Tin&quot; (1952–54) and &quot;The Rustlers&quot; (1959, 1963–64). Likewise, upon Alicia&#x27;s passing in 1963, Ivan and Josephine inherited her plantation in Georgia, just north of Jacksonville, prompting Albright to take particular interest in the swamp as a subject. Ivan&#x27;s time in Georgia between 1963 and 1965 was in part, however, out of necessity as the city of Chicago decided to tear down his studio on Ogden Avenue to make way for a shopping mall. In addition, despite having been honored with a retrospective at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1964–65, Albright felt ostracized by the artistic community of Chicago. Contemporary art was at the time dominated by Pop-Art and Minimalism, much unlike Albright&#x27;s figurative style. In part to escape this &quot;scene&quot;, Ivan and Josephine moved to Woodstock, Vermont in 1963, but were only able to begin living there full-time in 1965 when the property was fully renovated. It was there that Albright completed what was arguably his last major work, &quot;If Life Were Life – There Would Be No Death (The Vermonter)&quot; (1966–77), using the model Kenneth Harper Atwood, a retired maple farmer and former member of the Vermont House of Representatives.

While Albright was seventy-five, his eyesight began to deteriorate with the development of cataracts. The cataracts were reversed in 1977 with his first corneal transplant, which gave the artist a new sense of life. That year, he gifted much of his work to the Art Institute of Chicago, and the following year his first biography by Michael Croydon was published. Nonetheless, his health soon deteriorated. His last series of paintings was a group of self-portraits executed between 1981 and 1983. The series was begun at the request of the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence for a self-portrait to add to their collection of self-portraits by great masters in honor of their 400th anniversary. While one of the paintings is now in the Uffizi, Albright produced more than twenty-four in total in a variety of styles and media. The last of these he completed after a stroke and only a few days before he died on November 18, 1983.

== Style and works ==

=== Artistic development ===

It was not until the 1930s that Albright developed a consistent technique for his works. The technique included creating numerous detailed drawings, creating his own color palette and painting with hundreds of little brushes. Albright&#x27;s time-consuming technique not only allowed for detailed depiction of the physical deterioration of objects and people, but enabled him to incorporate a multitude of slight shifts in point-of-view and highlight the relationships between the objects. Albright&#x27;s combination of extreme realism with a violent and lurid color palette led art critics to categorize his work with the works of American Magic Realists.

In the late 1950s and the 1960s he employed metalpoint for drawings. &quot;The Last of the Old WoodStock Inn&quot; was drawn in 1968, using silver-, platinum-, gold-, copper-, and brasspoint on VideoMedia paper.

Themes through Albright&#x27;s works include death, life, spiritual vs. physical, and the effects of time. The titles of his works were similarly complex. He would not name a painting until it was complete, at which time he would come up with several possibilities before deciding on one. For example, a painting of a window is titled &quot;Poor Room – There is No Time, No End, No Today, No Yesterday, No Tomorrow, Only the Forever, and Forever and Forever Without End (The Window)&quot;. The painting is generally referred to only by these last two words. Another painting, &quot;And Man Created God in His Own Image&quot;, had the words in the title reversed into &quot;God Created Man in His Own Image&quot; when it toured the Southern US to avoid controversy.

=== Major works ===
==== &quot;Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida&quot; (1929–30) ====
This painting is a grotesque depiction of a woman who (based on the title) is named Ida. Within this painting there are several references to the idea that the human body is weak and that we are all trapped within our physical forms. There appears to be a conflict happening between the soul and the body. The figure is seated in a room that is cluttered and in a state of disrepair. She is looking into a hand mirror with a look of sadness on her face. One reading of this is that she is sad because of her age and lack of beauty. Some people believe she is an old actor or possibly a prostitute. &quot;Ida&quot; is akin to many of Albright&#x27;s other works due to the dead and decaying look of the figure as well as the deeper (and often dark) meanings that are hidden within.

==== &quot;That Which I Should Have Done I Did Not Do (The Door)&quot; (1931–1941) ====
One of his most famous paintings, titled &quot;That Which I Should Have Done I Did Not Do (The Door)&quot;, took him ten years to complete and won top prize at three major exhibitions in New York City, Chicago, and Philadelphia in 1941. The prize at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York earned him a $3,500 purchase award towards the painting and its place in the permanent collection, but Albright set the purchase price at $125,000. Instead he took First medal, allowing him to keep the work. This painting is currently on view at the Art Institute of Chicago.

==== &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1943) ====

In 1943, Albright was commissioned to create the titular painting for Albert Lewin&#x27;s film adaptation of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;. His naturalistic, exaggerated depictions of decay made him suited to create the image of the corrupted Dorian. His brother was originally chosen to do the beginning, uncorrupted painting of Gray. However, the painting used in the final film was from Henrique Medina. When changes to Medina&#x27;s painting were needed to show Gray&#x27;s fall, Albright painted them. His painting of the corrupted Dorian Gray currently resides in the Art Institute of Chicago. Allegedly, Albright kept retouching the painting while being shown at the Art Institute of Chicago.

== Reputation and legacy ==
Albright&#x27;s paintings can be found in some of the most prominent institutional collections in the United States, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the National Gallery of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. The largest and most important collection of Albright&#x27;s artworks and archives is held at the Art Institute of Chicago, demonstrating his singular relationship with the institution. Between donations from the artist, his family and his patrons, the Institute now holds 137 paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures. In turn, the institute works to promote his legacy through the publication of scholarly catalogues and exhibition of works. Major retrospectives of his work were held in 1964 and 1997. In addition, smaller exhibitions were held in 1978, 1984 and 2018.
The Art Institute of Chicago&#x27;s collection was the result of Albright&#x27;s own savvy in cementing his reputation among high-level museums and collectors. During the 1940s and 1950s, Albright repeatedly allowed prominent institutions to exchange works for superior examples: in 1947, the Institute exchanged &quot;Woman&quot; (1928) for &quot;Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida&quot; (1929–30); and in 1956, along with financing from donors they traded &quot;Ida&quot; together with &quot;Heavy the Oar to Him Who Is Tired, Heavy the Coat, Heavy the Sea&quot; (1929) and &quot;Oh God, Herrings, Buoys, the Glittering Sea&quot; (1940) for Albright&#x27;s masterpiece &quot;The Door&quot; (1931–1941). In 1977, Albright gifted seventy-five of his personal collection to the museum, returning several works that had been traded before. Upon Albright&#x27;s death, his widow Josephine Patterson Albright donated an additional twenty self-portraits as well as a collection of archival materials, now held by the Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago. The archive includes photographs, scrapbooks, sketches, notebooks, a film, and other materials documenting his life and career.

<text>Broadcast programming is the practice of organizing or ordering (scheduling) of broadcast media shows, typically radio and television, in a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or season-long schedule.

Modern broadcasters use broadcast automation to regularly change the scheduling of their shows to build an audience for a new show, retain that audience, or compete with other broadcasters&#x27; shows. Most broadcast television shows are presented weekly in prime time or daily in other dayparts, though there are many exceptions.

At a micro level, scheduling is the minute planning of the transmission; what to broadcast and when, ensuring an adequate or maximum utilization of airtime. Television scheduling strategies are employed to give shows the best possible chance of attracting and retaining an audience. They are used to deliver shows to audiences when they are most likely to want to watch them and deliver audiences to advertisers in the composition that makes their advertising most likely to be effective.

With the growth of digital platforms and services allowing non-linear, on-demand access to television content, this approach to broadcasting has since been referred to using the retronym linear (such as linear television and linear channels).

==History==
With the beginning of scheduled television in 1936, television programming was initially only concerned with filling a few hours each evening – the hours now known as prime time. Over time, though, television began to be seen during the daytime and late at night, as well on the weekends. As air time increased, so did the demand for new material. With the exception of sports television, variety shows became much more important in prime time.

==Scheduling strategies==

===Lead-ins and lead-outs===
Broadcasters may schedule a program to air before or after a widely viewed tent-pole program, such as a popular series, or a special such as a high-profile sporting event (such as, in the United States, the Super Bowl), in the hope that audience flow will encourage the audience to tune-in early or stay for the second program. The second program is usually one that the broadcaster wants to promote to a wider audience, such as a new or lower-profile series. Sometimes, a lower-profile program may be scheduled between two tentpole programs, a technique known as hammocking.

Lead-outs can sometimes help to launch new programs and talent; in 1982, NBC premiered &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; as a lead-out for its long-running late-night talk show &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. Characterized by an off-beat style appealing to young adults, &quot;Late Night&quot; helped launch the career of host David Letterman, and influence later entries into the genre. Despite Carson&#x27;s endorsement of Letterman as a successor following his 1992 retirement, NBC chose Jay Leno instead, and Letterman departed for CBS to host a spiritual successor—&quot;Late Show with David Letterman—&quot;beginning in the 1993–94 season. &quot;Late Night&quot; would continue as a franchise with hosts such as Conan O&#x27;Brien and Jimmy Fallon—both of whom would later go on to host &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

The same season, Fox scheduled &quot;The X-Files&quot; as a lead-out for its sci-fi western &quot;The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.&quot;, with the expectation that &quot;Brisco County Jr.&quot; would serve as the anchor of its Friday-night lineup. However, &quot;The X-Files&quot; proved to be significantly more successful, and would eventually run for nine seasons. By contrast, viewership for &quot;Brisco County Jr.&quot; declined throughout the season, and the show was cancelled. Fox attempted to use other sci-fi shows as a lead-in for &quot;The X-Files&quot; (such as &quot;Sliders&quot; and &quot;VR.5&quot;), but they were similarly unsuccessful.

A weak lead-in can have an impact on the viewership of programs that follow; NBC&#x27;s 2009 attempt to strip the talk show &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot; (a spiritual successor to Leno&#x27;s tenure of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; after Conan O&#x27;Brien succeeded him) in a 10:00 p.m. ET/PT timeslot proved detrimental to the viewership of late local newscasts on its affiliates. NBC subsequently announced plans to shorten &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot; to a half hour and move it to 11:35 p.m. ET/PT in late-February 2010, displacing &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; from its traditional timeslot. This proposal led to a public conflict between O&#x27;Brien and NBC, and ultimately resulted in his departure from the network, and the reinstatement of Jay Leno as host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

===Blocks===
Block programming is the practice of scheduling a group of complementary programs together. Blocks are typically built around specific genres (i.e. a block focusing specifically on sitcoms), target audiences, or other factors, with their programming often promoted collectively under blanket titles (such as ABC&#x27;s &quot;TGIF&quot; lineup, All TV&#x27;s &quot;Jeepney TV sa All TV&quot;, and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Must See TV&quot;).

===Bridging===
Bridging is the practice of discouraging the audience from changing channels during the &quot;junctions&quot; between specific programs. This can be done, primarily, by airing promos for the next program near the end of the preceding program, such as during its credits, or reducing the length of the junction between two programs as much as possible (hot switching). The host of the next program may similarly make a brief appearance near the end of the preceding program (sometimes interacting directly with the host) to provide a preview; in news broadcasting, this is typically referred to as a &quot;throw&quot; or &quot;toss&quot;.

A bridge was used by ABC between &quot;Roseanne&quot; and the December 1992 series premiere of &quot;The Jackie Thomas Show&quot;, a new sitcom co-created by Roseanne and Tom Arnold of &quot;Roseanne&quot; fame. A scene of the Connor family watching its opening on TV seamlessly transitioned into the program itself, with no junction in between. ABC commissioned a minute-by-minute Nielsen ratings report, which showed that the majority of viewers from &quot;Roseanne&quot; had been retained during the premiere.

Owing to both programs&#x27; news comedy formats, the Comedy Central program &quot;The Daily Show&quot; used newscast-style toss segments to promote its new spin-off and lead-out, &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, in which host Jon Stewart would engage in a comedic conversation with the latter&#x27;s host, Stephen Colbert, via split-screen. On the December 18, 2014 episode of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, this segment was used to seamlessly segue into the series finale of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. At its conclusion, the show transitioned back to Stewart (giving the impression that the entire &quot;Colbert Report&quot; episode was merely a segment of &quot;The Daily Show)&quot;, who concluded his show with its traditional closing segment &quot;Your Moment of Zen&quot; (which featured an outtake from a previous toss segment) as normal.

In some cases, a channel may intentionally allow a program to overrun into the next half-hour timeslot rather than end exactly on the half-hour, in order to discourage viewers from &quot;surfing&quot; away at traditional junction periods (since they had missed the beginnings of programs on other channels already). This can, however, cause disruptions with recorders if they are not aware of the scheduling (typically, digital video recorders can be configured to automatically record for a set length of time before and after a schedule&#x27;s given timeslot in program guide data to account for possible variances). For a period, TBS intentionally scheduled all of its programs at 5 and 35 minutes past the hour rather than exactly on the half hour (a practice it marketed as &quot;Turner Time&quot;), to attract viewers tuning away from other channels.

===Crossovers===

Crossovers can be organized between multiple programs, in which a single storyline is extended across episodes of two or more separate programs. Typically, these involve programs that form a single franchise or shared universe, such as NBC&#x27;s &quot;Chicago&quot; franchise and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (all created by Dick Wolf), and the ABC dramas &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; and &quot;Station 19&quot; (both created by Shonda Rhimes).

===Counterprogramming===
Counterprogramming is the practice of deliberately scheduling programming to attract viewers away from another, major program. Counterprogramming efforts often involve scheduling a contrasting program of a different genre or demographic, targeting viewers who may not be interested in the major program (such as a sporting event, which typically draws a predominantly-male audience, against an awards show that attracts a predominantly-female audience). Despite frequently being among the top U.S. television broadcasts of all time, the Super Bowl has had a prominent history of being counterprogrammed in this manner. One of the most prominent examples of this practice was Fox&#x27;s 1992 airing of a special live episode of &quot;In Living Color&quot; against the game&#x27;s halftime show.

Programs can also be counterprogrammed by a direct competitor in the same time slot, often resulting in the two programs attempting to attract viewers away from each other through publicity stunts and other tactics; these tactics have most notably been seen in counterprogramming efforts surrounding professional wrestling, including the Monday and Wednesday Night Wars of the 1990s and 2020s respectively.

In some cases, broadcasters may attempt to adjust their schedules in order to avert attempts at counterprogramming, such as getting a slightly earlier time slot (in the hope that once viewers have become committed to a show they will not switch channels), scheduling the competing program on a different night, or moving it to a different portion of the television season to avoid competition altogether.

===Dayparting===
Dayparting is the practice of dividing the day into several parts, during each of which a different type program is appropriate for that time is aired. Daytime television shows are most often geared toward a particular demographic, and what the target audience typically engages in at that time.

===Stripping===
Stripping is the practice of running a single series in a consistent, daily time slot throughout the week, usually on weekdays. Daytime programs such as talk shows, court shows, game shows, and soap operas, are typically aired in a strip format. Outside of serial drama formats such as telenovelas where popular, strips are rarely used for first-run entertainment programming outside of limited events.

Syndicated reruns of network programs that originally aired on a weekly basis are often aired as strips. Shows that are syndicated in this way generally have to have run for several seasons (the rule of thumb is usually 100 episodes) in order to have enough episodes to run without significant repeats.

=== Marathons ===

A marathon is the scheduling of a continuous, long-term block of programming as an event, usually devoted to airings of a single program or film franchise. When conducted using television series, a marathon may either consist of episodes aired in sequential order, or focus on episodes sharing specific themes.

Marathons are often aired on holidays (such as Syfy&#x27;s annual &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; marathon on New Year&#x27;s Day, and Game Show Network airing a Charles Nelson Reilly-hosted marathon of game show series finales on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1999), as counterprogramming for major events airing on other channels (such as the Super Bowl in the U.S.), to lead into new episodes of a series, or to commemorate milestones/events surrounding a specific series or franchise (such as an anniversary, or the network&#x27;s acquisition of rights to broadcast a certain series or franchise). Some marathons may focus on the roles of a specific entertainer; the death of Betty White resulted in several networks scheduling marathons of programming on or around January 17, 2022—which would have been White&#x27;s 100th birthday—featuring her television appearances, such as Hallmark Channel airing a marathon of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, and both Buzzr and Game Show Network airing marathons of her game show appearances.

While longer marathons are typically reserved for major events, the popularization of binge-watching via streaming services in the 2010s led to many U.S. cable networks adopting marathon-like blocks of programs as their regular schedule. To compete with the release practices of streaming services, TBS premiered entire seasons of its police sitcom &quot;Angie Tribeca&quot; in a marathon format.&quot;&quot; Similarly, free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services often feature linear channels that are narrowly-focused towards specific programs or franchises.

===Theming===
A broadcaster may temporarily dedicate all or parts of its schedule over a period of time to a specific theme. A well-known instance of a themed lineup is Discovery Channel&#x27;s annual &quot;Shark Week&quot;. Themed schedules are a common practice around major holidays—such as Valentine&#x27;s Day, Halloween, and Christmas—where channels may air episodes of programs, specials, and films that relate to the holiday. Channels may also air marathons of their signature programs and film rights to target viewers who are on vacation.

The U.S. basic cable networks Freeform (25 Days of Christmas, 31 Days of Halloween) and Hallmark Channel are known for broadcasting long-term holiday programming events. After experiencing success with its &quot;Countdown to Christmas&quot; event, Hallmark Channel adopted a practice of dividing its programming into similarly-branded &quot;seasons&quot; year-round, which are accompanied by thematically appropriate original series and television films. This strategy was part of an effort to position the channel as &quot;a year-round destination for celebrations&quot;, and is synergistic with Hallmark Cards&#x27; core greeting card and collectibles businesses.

===Time slot===
A show&#x27;s time slot or place in the schedule could be crucial to its success or failure; generally, earlier prime time slots have a stronger appeal towards family viewing and younger demographics, while later time slots generally appeal more towards older demographics. Some time slots, colloquially known as &quot;graveyard slots&quot; or &quot;death slots&quot;, are prone to having smaller potential audiences (with one such example in the U.S. being Friday nights), or insurmountable competition from highly rated series.

<doc id="1068737" wikidata="Q2733067" url="?curid=1068737" title="Marnhull">
<text>Marnhull ( ) is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England. It lies in the Blackmore Vale, north of Sturminster Newton. The resort towns of Bournemouth and Weymouth are approximately south. Marnhull is sited on a low ridge of Corallian limestone above the valley of the River Stour, which forms the northern and western boundaries of the parish. In the 2011 census the parish had 962 dwellings, 905 households and a population of 1,998.

==Description==
Marnhull consists of several conjoined hamlets, connected by a network of minor roads. The village presents a mix of architectural styles, with post-war developments existing alongside properties dating back to Tudor times and earlier. It has three churches (Anglican, Roman Catholic and Methodist), two primary schools, two public houses, a GP surgery, a village hall and a recreation ground, as well as various small shops and services. The parish church of St Gregory has a 15th-century tower which is a landmark and has been described as &quot;the finest in the Vale.&quot;

==History==
Saxon charters show that Marnhull existed as a village in the 10th century, although the village&#x27;s site has seen human occupation as early as the Iron Age, and a Roman settlement was established at Ashley Wood in the east of the parish. The Domesday Book of 1086 does not mention Marnhull by name, though the constituent settlements of Walton Elm, Burton and Kentleworth were probably recorded under the entry for Sturminster Newton as the eight hides of land owned by Waleran, Roger and Chetel. The eastern part of Marnhull parish used to be a separate parish, named Thorton, until the 16th century. Until 1763 Marnhull was the site of an annual bull-baiting event, taking place every 3 May. The event was stopped as a response to the violence and bloodshed it engendered, not just in Marnhull but also in surrounding villages.

==Governance==
Marnhull is in the constituency of North Dorset, currently represented in the UK parliament by the Conservative Simon Hoare.

Marnhull is part of the Stalbridge and Marnhull ward which elects 1 member to Dorset Council.

==Geography==
Marnhull civil parish covers about at an elevation of about . The western boundary of the parish is formed by the River Stour and the eastern by the Key Brook, a tributary of the Stour. The central part of the parish is drained by Chivrick&#x27;s Brook, a tributary of the Key Brook. These watercourses all drain north to south. From west to east the geology of the parish comprises a thin strip of Oxford clay around the Stour, a long ridge of Corallian sand and limestone between the Stour and Chivrick&#x27;s Brook, then lower-lying Kimmeridge clay between Chivrick&#x27;s Brook and the eastern boundary. Marnhull village is sited on the ridge of Corallian beds, which form the highest part of the parish and are the source of the building stone extensively used throughout it.

==Culture==
===Cultural references===

Thomas Hardy described Marnhull as &#x27;Marlott&#x27; in his novel &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;. The Crown Inn is described by Hardy as &#x27;The Pure Drop Inn&#x27;, and The Blackmore Vale Inn is described as &#x27;Rollivers&#x27; - a disreputable and illegal drinking house, where secret ale drinking groups gathered upstairs. The television adaptation of the book was filmed in the village.

==Notable residents==
*Catherine Parr the last of Henry VIII&#x27;s wives was given the original manor of Nash Court in 1544. From her it passed to Edward VI and then to Elizabeth I after which it passed through the families of several noblemen and eminent civilians.

<text>David Trinidad (born 1953 in Los Angeles, California) is an American poet.

David Trinidad was born in Los Angeles, California, and raised in the San Fernando Valley. He attended California State University, Northridge, where he studied poetry with Ann Stanford and edited the literary journal &quot;Angel’s Flight&quot;. While at Northridge, he became friends with the poet Rachel Sherwood, a fellow student. On July 5, 1979, Sherwood and Trinidad were involved in an automobile accident in which Sherwood was killed and Trinidad severely injured. Later, Trinidad published a book of Rachel Sherwood&#x27;s poems and established Sherwood Press in her honor.

His first book of poems, &quot;Pavane&quot;, was published in 1981. The &quot;Los Angeles Times Book Review&quot; noted that Trinidad’s &quot;voice has assurance and integrity.” In the early 1980s, Trinidad was one of a group of poets who were active at the Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center in Venice, California. Other members of this group included Dennis Cooper, Bob Flanagan, Amy Gerstler, Jack Skelley, and Ed Smith. As editor of Sherwood Press, he published books by Cooper, Flanagan, Gerstler, Tim Dlugos, Alice Notley, and others. In 1988, Trinidad relocated to New York City. He received his Master of Fine Arts from Brooklyn College in 1990. He taught at Rutgers University and The New School. In 2002, Trinidad moved to Chicago to teach at Columbia College. His personal papers are archived at Fales Library at New York University.

Trinidad’s numerous books include &quot;Plasticville&quot;, &quot;The Late Show&quot;, and &quot;Dear Prudence: New and Selected Poems&quot;. Amy Gerstler writes that &quot;Plasticville&quot; “provides readers with a model train tour of a fastidiously kept alternative world where fixation provides temporary relief from the pain and confusion of growing up human.” In her review of &quot;The Late Show&quot; in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Lizzie Skurnick praises Trinidad as “a meticulous curator of pop-culture flotsam—silver-screen sirens, Barbie, &#x27;60s-era lip gloss—and his autobiographical verse is a graceful, merry wink to gay culture.” Assessing &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; in &quot;Bookforum&quot;, poet Ange Mlinko states, “How Trinidad molds fanboy longings into sophisticated forms, dousing them with liberal California light and his own temperamental sweetness, is his secret and his achievement.” Both &quot;Plasticville&quot; and &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; were nominated for the Lambda Literary Award in Poetry, and &quot;Plasticville&quot; was a finalist for the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize.

In addition to his own books, Trinidad has edited several volumes of poetry, including &quot;A Fast Life: The Collected Poems of Tim Dlugos&quot; (2011), which won a Lambda Literary Award. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; writes, &quot;This ambitious collection, with Trinidad&#x27;s foreword and chronology, might elevate from cult status a poet who did much more than respond to his times.&quot; Trinidad&#x27;s latest edited volume, &quot;Punk Rock Is Cool for the End of the World: Poems and Notebooks of Ed Smith,&quot; was published in June 2019. David L. Ulin, reviewing the book for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, describes it as &quot;a back-and-forth between despair and aspiration, ecstasy and degradation: a lens (or set of lenses) on the shards that make a life.&quot;

With Arielle Greenberg and Tony Trigilio, Trinidad co-founded the poetry magazine &quot;Court Green&quot; in 2004. From 2004 to 2015, &quot;Court Green&quot; was published in conjunction with Columbia College, and twelve issues of the magazine appeared during that time. In 2017, Trigilio and Trinidad revived &quot;Court Green&quot; as an independent online poetry journal. Aaron Smith joined &quot;Court Green&quot; as a co-editor in 2020.

Trinidad is known for his masterful use of popular culture in his poems. The poet James Schuyler wrote, “Trinidad turns the paste jewels of pop art into the real thing.” His work is also associated with the innovative formalism of the New York School. Alice Notley has written, “There is an unwavering light in all of Trinidad’s work that turns individual words into objects, new facts.” About &quot;The Late Show&quot; (2007), &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; wrote that Trinidad’s “most impressive gift is an ability to dignify the dross of American life, to honor both the shrink-wrapped sentiment of the cultural artifacts he writes about and his own much more complicated emotional response to them.”

<text>Lake Houston is a reservoir on the San Jacinto River, 15 miles (24 km) northeast of downtown Houston, Texas, United States. The reservoir is the primary municipal water supply for the city of Houston.

==Location and creation==
Situated between the communities of Kingwood, Atascocita and Humble on the west bank, Sheldon on the south, and Crosby and Huffman on the east. An earthen dam spans a portion of the southern bank along Dwight D. Eisenhower Park.

The reservoir was created in 1953 when the City of Houston built the dam to impound a reservoir to replace Sheldon Lake, then the primary source of water for the city. The city sold Sheldon Lake to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department for use as a waterfowl sanctuary and public fishing site.

The City of Houston annexed the Lake Houston area and a canal in 1956.
==Fish and plant populations==
Lake Houston has been stocked with species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish present in Lake Houston include largemouth bass, white bass, white crappie, blue catfish, and bluegill.

==Recreational uses==
Boating and fishing are both popular recreational uses of the lake. At the northern end of the lake, Lake Houston Wilderness Park has rental cabins, facilities for camping, a kayak launch and trails for hiking and biking.

<doc id="1068768" wikidata="Q283180" url="?curid=1068768" title="Phytoremediation">
<text>Phytoremediation technologies use living plants to clean up soil, air and water contaminated with hazardous contaminants. It is defined as &quot;the use of green plants and the associated microorganisms, along with proper soil amendments and agronomic techniques to either contain, remove or render toxic environmental contaminants harmless&quot;. The term is an amalgam of the Greek &quot;phyto&quot; (plant) and Latin &quot;remedium&quot; (restoring balance). Although attractive for its cost, phytoremediation has not been demonstrated to redress any significant environmental challenge to the extent that contaminated space has been reclaimed.

Phytoremediation is proposed as a cost-effective plant-based approach of environmental remediation that takes advantage of the ability of plants to concentrate elements and compounds from the environment and to detoxify various compounds without causing additional pollution. The concentrating effect results from the ability of certain plants called hyperaccumulators to bioaccumulate chemicals. The remediation effect is quite different. Toxic heavy metals cannot be degraded, but organic pollutants can be, and are generally the major targets for phytoremediation. Several field trials confirmed the feasibility of using plants for environmental cleanup.

==Background==

Soil remediation is an expensive and complicated process. Traditional methods involve removal of the contaminated soil followed by treatment and return of the treated soil.

Phytoremediation could in principle be a more cost effective solution. Phytoremediation may be applied to polluted soil or static water environment. This technology has been increasingly investigated and employed at sites with soils contaminated heavy metals like with cadmium, lead, aluminum, arsenic and antimony. These metals can cause oxidative stress in plants, destroy cell membrane integrity, interfere with nutrient uptake, inhibit photosynthesis and decrease plant chlorophyll.

Phytoremediation has been used successfully in the restoration of abandoned metal mine workings, and sites where polychlorinated biphenyls have been dumped during manufacture and mitigation of ongoing coal mine discharges reducing the impact of contaminants in soils, water, or air. Contaminants such as metals, pesticides, solvents, explosives, and crude oil and its derivatives, have been mitigated in phytoremediation projects worldwide. Many plants such as mustard plants, alpine pennycress, hemp, and pigweed have proven to be successful at hyperaccumulating contaminants at toxic waste sites.

Not all plants are able to accumulate heavy metals or organics pollutants due to differences in the physiology of the plant. Even cultivars within the same species have varying abilities to accumulate pollutants.

==Advantages and limitations==

===Advantages===
* the cost of the phytoremediation is lower than that of traditional processes both &quot;in situ&quot; and &quot;ex situ&quot;
* the possibility of the recovery and re-use of valuable metals (by companies specializing in &quot;phytomining&quot;)
* it preserves the topsoil, maintaining the fertility of the soil
* Increase soil health, yield, and plant phytochemicals
* the use of plants also reduces erosion and metal leaching in the soil
* Noise, smell and visual disruption are usually less than with alternative methods. The :de:Galmeivegetation of hyperaccumulator plants is even protected by environmental legislation in many areas where it occurs.

===Limitations===
* phytoremediation is limited to the surface area and depth occupied by the roots.
* with plant-based systems of remediation, it is not possible to completely prevent the leaching of contaminants into the groundwater (without the complete removal of the contaminated ground, which in itself does not resolve the problem of contamination)
* the survival of the plants is affected by the toxicity of the contaminated land and the general condition of the soil
* bio-accumulation of contaminants, especially metals, into the plants can affect consumer products like food and cosmetics, and requires the safe disposal of the affected plant material
* when taking up heavy metals, sometimes the metal is bound to the soil organic matter, which makes it unavailable for the plant to extract
* some plants are too hard to cultivate or too slow growing to make them viable for phytoremediation despite their status as hyperacumulators. Genetic engineering may improve desirable properties in target species but is controversial in some countries.

== Processes ==

A range of processes mediated by plants or algae are tested in treating environmental problems.:
=== Phytoextraction ===
Phytoextraction (or &quot;phytoaccumulation&quot; or &quot;phytosequestration&quot;) exploits the ability of plants or algae to remove contaminants from soil or water into harvestable plant biomass. It is also used for the mining of metals such as copper(II) compounds. The roots take up substances from the soil or water and concentrate them above ground in the plant biomass Organisms that can uptake high amounts of contaminants are called hyperaccumulators. Phytoextraction can also be performed by plants (e.g. Populus and Salix) that take up lower levels of pollutants, but due to their high growth rate and biomass production, may remove a considerable amount of contaminants from the soil. Phytoextraction has been growing rapidly in popularity worldwide for the last twenty years or so. Typically, phytoextraction is used for heavy metals or other inorganics. At the time of disposal, contaminants are typically concentrated in the much smaller volume of the plant matter than in the initially contaminated soil or sediment. After harvest, a lower level of the contaminant will remain in the soil, so the growth/harvest cycle must usually be repeated through several crops to achieve a significant cleanup. After the process, the soil is remediated. 

Of course many pollutants kill plants, so phytoremediation is not a panacea. For example, chromium is toxic to most higher plants at concentrations above 100 μM·kg−1 dry weight.

Mining of these extracted metals through phytomining is a conceivable way of recovering the material. Hyperaccumulating plants are often metallophyte. Induced or assisted phytoextraction is a process where a conditioning fluid containing a chelator or another agent is added to soil to increase metal solubility or mobilization so that the plants can absorb them more easily. While such additives can increase metal uptake by plants, they can also lead to large amounts of available metals in the soil beyond what the plants are able to translocate, causing potential leaching into the subsoil or groundwater.

Examples of plants that are known to accumulate the following contaminants:
*Arsenic, using the sunflower (&quot;Helianthus annuus&quot;), or the Chinese Brake fern (&quot;Pteris vittata&quot;).
*Cadmium, using willow (&quot;Salix viminalis&quot;), which as a phytoextractor of cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu).
*Cadmium and zinc, using alpine pennycress (&quot;Thlaspi caerulescens&quot;), a hyperaccumulator of these metals at levels that would be toxic to many plants. Specifically, pennycress leaves accumulate up to 380 mg/kg Cd. On the other hand, the presence of copper seems to impair its growth (see table for reference).
*Chromium is toxic to most plants. However, tomatoes (&quot;Solanum lycopersicum&quot;) show some promise.
*Lead, using Indian mustard (&quot;Brassica juncea&quot;), ragweed (&quot;Ambrosia artemisiifolia&quot;), hemp dogbane (&quot;Apocynum cannabinum&quot;), or poplar trees, which sequester lead in their biomass.
*Salt-tolerant (moderately halophytic) barley and/or sugar beets are commonly used for the extraction of sodium chloride (common salt) to reclaim fields that were previously flooded by sea water.
*Caesium-137 and strontium-90 were removed from a pond using sunflowers after the Chernobyl accident.
*Mercury, selenium and organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been removed from soils by transgenic plants containing genes for bacterial enzymes.

* Thallium is sequestered by some plants.

=== Phytostabilization ===
Phytostabilization reduces the mobility of substances in the environment, for example, by limiting the leaching of substances from the soil. It focuses on the long term stabilization and containment of the pollutant. The plant immobilizes the pollutants by binding them to soil particles making them less available for plant or human uptake. Unlike phytoextraction, phytostabilization focuses mainly on sequestering pollutants in soil near the roots but not in plant tissues. Pollutants become less bioavailable, resulting in reduced exposure. The plants can also excrete a substance that produces a chemical reaction, converting the heavy metal pollutant into a less toxic form. Stabilization results in reduced erosion, runoff, leaching, in addition to reducing the bioavailability of the contaminant. An example application of phytostabilization is using a vegetative cap to stabilize and contain mine tailings. Some soil amendments decrease radiosource mobility – while at some concentrations the same amendments will &quot;increase&quot; mobility. Vidal &quot;et al.&quot; 2000 find the root mats of meadow grasses are effective at demobilising radiosource materials especially with certain combinations of other agricultural practices. Vidal also find that the particular grass mix makes a significant difference.

=== Phytodegradation ===

Phytodegradation (also called phytotransformation) uses plants or microorganisms to degrade organic pollutants in the soil or within the body of the plant. The organic compounds are broken down by enzymes that the plant roots secrete and these molecules are then taken up by the plant and released through transpiration. This process works best with organic contaminants like herbicides, trichloroethylene, and methyl &quot;tert&quot;-butyl ether.

Phytotransformation results in the chemical modification of environmental substances as a direct result of plant metabolism, often resulting in their inactivation, degradation (phytodegradation), or immobilization (phytostabilization). In the case of organic pollutants, such as pesticides, explosives, solvents, industrial chemicals, and other xenobiotic substances, certain plants, such as Cannas, render these substances non-toxic by their metabolism. In other cases, microorganisms living in association with plant roots may metabolize these substances in soil or water. These complex and recalcitrant compounds cannot be broken down to basic molecules (water, carbon-dioxide, etc.) by plant molecules, and, hence, the term &quot;phytotransformation&quot; represents a change in chemical structure without complete breakdown of the compound.
The term &quot;Green Liver&quot; is used to describe phytotransformation, as plants behave analogously to the human liver when dealing with these xenobiotic compounds (foreign compound/pollutant). After uptake of the xenobiotics, plant enzymes increase the polarity of the xenobiotics by adding functional groups such as hydroxyl groups (-OH).

This is known as Phase I metabolism, similar to the way that the human liver increases the polarity of drugs and foreign compounds (drug metabolism). Whereas in the human liver enzymes such as cytochrome P450s are responsible for the initial reactions, in plants enzymes such as peroxidases, phenoloxidases, esterases and nitroreductases carry out the same role.

In the second stage of phytotransformation, known as Phase II metabolism, plant biomolecules such as glucose and amino acids are added to the polarized xenobiotic to further increase the polarity (known as conjugation). This is again similar to the processes occurring in the human liver where glucuronidation (addition of glucose molecules by the UGT class of enzymes, e.g. UGT1A1) and glutathione addition reactions occur on reactive centres of the xenobiotic.

Phase I and II reactions serve to increase the polarity and reduce the toxicity of the compounds, although many exceptions to the rule are seen. The increased polarity also allows for easy transport of the xenobiotic along aqueous channels.

In the final stage of phytotransformation (Phase III metabolism), a sequestration of the xenobiotic occurs within the plant. The xenobiotics polymerize in a lignin-like manner and develop a complex structure that is sequestered in the plant. This ensures that the xenobiotic is safely stored, and does not affect the functioning of the plant. However, preliminary studies have shown that these plants can be toxic to small animals (such as snails), and, hence, plants involved in phytotransformation may need to be maintained in a closed enclosure.

Hence, the plants reduce toxicity (with exceptions) and sequester the xenobiotics in phytotransformation. Trinitrotoluene phytotransformation has been extensively researched and a transformation pathway has been proposed.

=== Phytostimulation ===
Phytostimulation (or rhizodegradation) is the enhancement of soil microbial activity for the degradation of organic contaminants, typically by organisms that associate with roots. This process occurs within the rhizosphere, which is the layer of soil that surrounds the roots. Plants release carbohydrates and acids that stimulate microorganism activity which results in the biodegradation of the organic contaminants. This means that the microorganisms are able to digest and break down the toxic substances into harmless form. Phytostimulation has been shown to be effective in degrading petroleum hydrocarbons, PCBs, and PAHs. Phytostimulation can also involve aquatic plants supporting active populations of microbial degraders, as in the stimulation of atrazine degradation by hornwort.

=== Phytovolatilization ===

Phytovolatilization is the removal of substances from soil or water with release into the air, sometimes as a result of phytotransformation to more volatile and/or less polluting substances. In this process, contaminants are taken up by the plant and through transpiration, evaporate into the atmosphere. This is the most studied form of phytovolatilization, where volatilization occurs at the stem and leaves of the plant, however indirect phytovolatilization occurs when contaminants are volatilized from the root zone. Selenium (Se) and Mercury (Hg) are often removed from soil through phytovolatilization. Poplar trees are one of the most successful plants for removing VOCs through this process due to its high transpiration rate.

=== Rhizofiltration ===
Rhizofiltration is a process that filters water through a mass of roots to remove toxic substances or excess nutrients. The pollutants remain absorbed in or adsorbed to the roots. This process is often used to clean up contaminated groundwater through planting directly in the contaminated site or through removing the contaminated water and providing it to these plants in an off-site location. In either case though, typically plants are first grown in a greenhouse under precise conditions.

=== Biological hydraulic containment ===
Biological hydraulic containment occurs when some plants, like poplars, draw water upwards through the soil into the roots and out through the plant, which decreases the movement of soluble contaminants downwards, deeper into the site and into the groundwater.

=== Phytodesalination ===
Phytodesalination uses halophytes (plants adapted to saline soil) to extract salt from the soil to improve its fertility.

== Role of genetics ==
Breeding programs and genetic engineering are powerful methods for enhancing natural phytoremediation capabilities, or for introducing new capabilities into plants. Genes for phytoremediation may originate from a micro-organism or may be transferred from one plant to another variety better adapted to the environmental conditions at the cleanup site. For example, genes encoding a nitroreductase from a bacterium were inserted into tobacco and showed faster removal of TNT and enhanced resistance to the toxic effects of TNT.
Researchers have also discovered a mechanism in plants that allows them to grow even when the pollution concentration in the soil is lethal for non-treated plants. Some natural, biodegradable compounds, such as exogenous polyamines, allow the plants to tolerate concentrations of pollutants 500 times higher than untreated plants, and to absorb more pollutants.

== Hyperaccumulators and biotic interactions ==

A plant is said to be a hyperaccumulator if it can concentrate the pollutants in a minimum percentage which varies according to the pollutant involved (for example: more than 1000 mg/kg of dry weight for nickel, copper, cobalt, chromium or lead; or more than 10,000 mg/kg for zinc or manganese). This capacity for accumulation is due to hypertolerance, or &quot;phytotolerance&quot;: the result of adaptative evolution from the plants to hostile environments through many generations. A number of interactions may be affected by metal hyperaccumulation, including protection, interferences with neighbour plants of different species, mutualism (including mycorrhizae, pollen and seed dispersal), commensalism, and biofilm.

===Tables of hyperaccumulators===

*Hyperaccumulators table – 2 : Nickel
*Hyperaccumulators table – 3 : Radionuclides (Cd, Cs, Co, Pu, Ra, Sr, U), Hydrocarbons, Organic Solvents.

== Phytoscreening ==
As plants can translocate and accumulate particular types of contaminants, plants can be used as biosensors of subsurface contamination, thereby allowing investigators to delineate contaminant plumes quickly. Chlorinated solvents, such as trichloroethylene, have been observed in tree trunks at concentrations related to groundwater concentrations. To ease field implementation of phytoscreening, standard methods have been developed to extract a section of the tree trunk for later laboratory analysis, often by using an increment borer. Phytoscreening may lead to more optimized site investigations and reduce contaminated site cleanup costs.

<text>Fairyland (Early Modern English: &quot;Faerie&quot;; (Scottish mythology; cf. (Norse mythology)) in English and Scottish folklore is the fabulous land or abode of fairies or &quot;fays&quot;. Old French (Early Modern English ) referred to an illusion or enchantment, the land of the &quot;faes&quot;. Modern English (by the 17th century) &quot;fairy&quot; transferred the name of the realm of the &quot;fays&quot; to its inhabitants, e.g., the expression &quot;fairie knight&quot; in Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; refers to a &quot;supernatural knight&quot; or a &quot;knight of Faerie&quot; but was later re-interpreted as referring to a knight who is &quot;a fairy&quot;.

==Folklore==
Fairyland may be referred to simply as &quot;Fairy&quot; or &quot;Faerie&quot;, though that usage is an archaism. It is often the land ruled by the &quot;Queen of Fairy&quot;, and thus anything from fairyland is also sometimes described as being from the &quot;Court of the Queen of &quot; or from the Seelie court in Scottish folklore. The Scots word or &quot;&quot; &quot;fairyland&quot; has other variant forms, attested in Scottish witch trials, but or with the stem (meaning &#x27;home&#x27; in Scots) were conjectural readings by Pitcairn.

==In Scots texts==
Records of the Scottish witch trials reveal that many initiates claimed to have had congress with the &quot;Queen of Elfame&quot; and her retinue. On November 8, 1576, midwife Bessie Dunlop, a resident of Dalry, Scotland, was accused of sorcery and witchcraft. She answered her accusers that she had received tuition from Thomas Reid, a former barony officer who had died at the Battle of Pinkie 30 years earlier and from the Queen of &quot;Court of Elfame&quot; that lay nearby. It resulted in a conviction and she was burned at the stake in 1576.

Allison Peirson was burned as a witch in 1588 for conversing with the Queen of Elfame and for prescribing magic charms and potions (Byre Hills, Fife, Scotland). This same woman (styled &quot;Alison Pearson&quot;) is also featured in Robert Sempill&#x27;s ballad (1583) where she is said to have been in a fairy-ride. Sempill&#x27;s piece mentions &quot;Elphyne&quot; glossed as &quot;Elfland&quot; or &quot;Fairyland&quot;.

In the medieval verse romance and the Scottish ballad of &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot;, the title character is spirited away by a female supernatural being. Although identified by commentators as the Queen of Fairies, the texts refrain from specifically naming her or her domain except in ballad version A, in which she is referred to as the Queen of Elfland. Poet and novelist Robert Graves published his alteration of the ballad, replacing her name with &quot;Queen of Elphame&quot;:
Elfhame or Elfland is portrayed in various ways in these ballads and stories, most commonly as mystical and benevolent but sometimes as sinister and wicked. The mysteriousness of the land and its otherworldly powers are a source of skepticism and distrust in many tales. Additional journeys to the realm include the fairy tale &quot;Childe Rowland&quot;, which presents a particularly negative view of the land.

<text>Christian existentialism is a theo-philosophical movement which takes an existentialist approach to Christian theology. The school of thought is often traced back to the work of the Danish philosopher and theologian Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855) who is widely regarded as the father of existentialism.

==Kierkegaardian themes==

Christian existentialism relies on Kierkegaard&#x27;s understanding of Christianity. Kierkegaard addressed themes such as authenticity, anxiety, love, and the irrationality and subjectivity of faith, rejecting efforts to contain God in an objective, logical system. To Kierkegaard, the focus of theology was on the individual grappling with subjective truth rather than a set of objective claims – a point he demonstrated by often writing under pseudonyms that had different points of view. He contended that each person must make independent choices, which then constitute his or her existence. Each person suffers from the anguish of indecision (whether knowingly or unknowingly) until committing to a way to live. Kierkegaard posited three stages of human existence: the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious, the latter coming after what is often called the leap of faith. Kierkegaard argued that the universe is fundamentally paradoxical, and that its greatest paradox is the transcendent union of God and humans in the person of Jesus Christ. He also posited having a personal relationship with God that supersedes all prescribed moralities, social structures and communal norms, since he asserted that following social conventions is essentially a personal aesthetic choice made by individuals.

==Major premises==
One of the major premises of Kierkegaardian Christian existentialism entails calling the masses back to a more genuine form of Christianity. This form is often identified with some notion of Early Christianity, which mostly existed during the first three centuries after Christ&#x27;s crucifixion. Beginning with the Edict of Milan, which was issued by Roman Emperor Constantine I in AD 313, Christianity enjoyed a level of popularity among Romans and later among other Europeans. And yet Kierkegaard asserted that by the 19th century, the ultimate meaning of New Testament Christianity (love, cf. agape, mercy and loving-kindness) had become perverted, and Christianity had deviated considerably from its original threefold message of grace, humility, and love.

Another major premise of Kierkegaardian Christian existentialism involves Kierkegaard&#x27;s conception of God and Love. For the most part, Kierkegaard equates God with Love. Thus, when a person engages in the act of loving, he is in effect achieving an aspect of the divine. Kierkegaard also viewed the individual as a necessary synthesis of both and infinite elements. Therefore, when an individual does not come to a full realization of his infinite side, he is said to be in . For many contemporary Christian theologians, the notion of despair can be viewed as sin. However, to Kierkegaard, a man sinned when he was exposed to this idea of despair and chose a path other than one in accordance with God&#x27;s will.

A final major premise of Kierkegaardian Christian existentialism entails the systematic undoing of evil acts. Kierkegaard asserted that once an action had been completed, it should be evaluated in the face of God, for holding oneself up to divine scrutiny was the only way to judge one&#x27;s actions. Because actions constitute the manner in which something is deemed good or bad, one must be constantly conscious of the potential consequences of his actions. Kierkegaard believed that the choice for goodness ultimately came down to each individual. Yet Kierkegaard also foresaw the potential limiting of choices for individuals who fell into despair.

==The Bible==
Christian Existentialism often refers to what it calls the indirect style of Christ&#x27;s teachings, which it considers to be a distinctive and important aspect of his ministry. Christ&#x27;s point, it says, is often left unsaid in any particular parable or saying, to permit each individual to confront the truth on his own. This is particularly evident in (but is certainly not limited to) his parables; for example in the Gospel of Matthew (). 
A good example of indirect communication in the Old Testament is the story of David and Nathan in .

An existential reading of the Bible demands that the reader recognize that he is an existing subject, studying the words that God communicates to him personally. This is in contrast to looking at a collection of truths which are outside and unrelated to the reader. Such a reader is not obligated to follow the commandments as if an external agent is forcing them upon him, but as though they are inside him and guiding him internally. This is the task Kierkegaard takes up when he asks: &quot;Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor&#x27;s distance from everyday life, or the learner who should put it to use?&quot; Existentially speaking, the Bible doesn&#x27;t become an authority in a person&#x27;s life until they &quot;permit&quot; the Bible to be their personal authority.

==Notable Christian existentialists==
In addition to Søren Kierkegaard, Christian existentialists include German Protestant theologians Paul Tillich, and Rudolf Bultmann, American existential psychologist Rollo May (who introduced much of Tillich&#x27;s thought to a general American readership), British Anglican theologian John Macquarrie, American philosopher Clifford Williams, French Catholic philosophers Maurice Blondel, Gabriel Marcel, Louis Lavelle, Emmanuel Mounier, Jacques Maritain and Pierre Boutang and French Protestant Paul Ricœur, German philosopher Karl Jaspers, Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno, Russian philosophers Nikolai Berdyaev and Lev Shestov, and Greek Orthodoxy philosopher Christos Yannaras. Karl Barth added to Kierkegaard&#x27;s ideas the notion that existential despair leads an individual to an awareness of God&#x27;s infinite nature. Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky could be placed within the tradition of Christian existentialism. Walker Percy, an American author from the twentieth century, gave Christian existentialist critique of contemporary society. &quot;Walker Percy: Prophetic, Existentialist, Catholic Storyteller&quot; (New Connections) by Rev. Robert E. Lauder (Author)

The roots of existentialism have been traced back as far as Augustine of Hippo. Some of the most striking passages in Pascal&#x27;s &quot;Pensées&quot;, including the famous section on the Wager, deal with existentialist themes. Jacques Maritain, in &quot;Existence and the Existent: An Essay on Christian Existentialism&quot;, finds the core of true existentialism in the thought of Thomas Aquinas.

== Existential theology ==

In the monograph, &quot;Existential Theology: An Introduction&quot; (2020), Hue Woodson provides a constructive primer to the field and, he argues, thinkers that can be considered more broadly as engaging with existential theology, defining a French school including Gabriel Marcel, Jacques Maritain, and Jean-Luc Marion, a German school including Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and a Russian school including Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Leo Tolstoy, and Nikolai Berdyaev.

== Radical existential Christianity ==
It has been claimed that radical existential Christians’ faith is based in their sensible and immediate and direct experience of God indwelling in human terms. It is suggested that individuals do not make or create their Christian existence; it does not come as a result of a decision one personally makes. The radical Protestants of the 17th century, like the Quakers, may have been in some ways theo-philosophically aligned with radical existential Christianity.

<doc id="1068783" wikidata="Q3287002" url="?curid=1068783" title="Monolingualism">
<text>Monoglottism (Greek μόνος &quot;monos&quot;, &quot;alone, solitary&quot;, + γλῶττα , &quot;tongue, language&quot;) or, more commonly, monolingualism or unilingualism, is the condition of being able to speak only a single language, as opposed to multilingualism. In a different context, &quot;unilingualism&quot; may refer to a language policy which enforces an official or national language over others.

Being monolingual or unilingual is also said of a text, dictionary, or conversation written or conducted in only one language, and of an in which a single language is either used or officially recognized (in particular when being compared with bilingual or multilingual entities or in the presence of individuals speaking different languages). Note that mono&quot;glottism&quot; can only refer to lacking the &quot;ability&quot; to speak several languages. Multilingual speakers outnumber monolingual speakers in the world&#x27;s population.

Suzzane Romaine pointed out, in her 1995 book &quot;Bilingualism&quot;, that it would be weird to find a book titled &quot;Monolingualism&quot;. This statement reflects the traditional assumption that linguistic theories often take on: that monolingualism is the norm. Monolingualism is thus rarely the subject of scholarly publications, as it is viewed to be an unmarked or prototypical concept where it has the sense of being normal and multilingualism is the exception.
The assumption of normative monolingualism is also often the view of monolinguals who speak a global language, like the English language. Crystal (1987) said that this assumption is adopted by many in Western society. One explanation is provided by Edwards, who in 2004 claimed that evidence of the &quot;monolingual mindset&quot; can be traced back to 19th century Europe, when the nation was rising and a dominant group had control, and European mindsets on language were carried forth to its colonies, further perpetuating the monolingual mindset.

Another explanation is that the nations who speak the English language are both “the producers and beneficiaries of English as a global language” and the populations within these countries tend to be monolingual.

==Comparison with multilingualism==
===Vocabulary size and verbal fluency===
According to a study on lexical access, monolinguals often maintain a wider vocabulary in a target language relative to a comparable bilingual, and that increases the efficiency of word retrieval in monolinguals. Monolinguals also access words more often than bilinguals in a target language.

In letter fluency tasks, monolinguals in the study were also able to respond with more words to the letter cue than bilinguals, but such an effect was not seen in bilinguals with a high vocabulary score.

Also, monolinguals performed better than bilinguals on verbal fluency in the study. If the vocabulary abilities were made to be more comparable, however, many of the differences would disappear, indicating that vocabulary size may be a factor that moderated a person&#x27;s performance in verbal fluency and naming tasks. The same study also found that bilinguals, in a version of the letter fluency task that placed more demand on executive control, performed better than monolinguals. Thus, once vocabulary abilities were controlled, bilinguals performed better on letter fluency possibilities by the enhanced frontal executive processes in the brain.

It is important to note here that bilinguals&#x27; overall vocabulary size in both languages combined was equivalent to monolinguals&#x27; in one language, even though monolinguals may excel in vocabulary size for the one language they speak. Bilinguals may have smaller vocabularies in each individual language, but when their vocabularies were combined, the content size was approximately similar to that of the monolingual. Monolingual children demonstrated larger vocabulary scored than their bilingual peers, but bilingual children&#x27;s vocabulary scores still increased with age, just like the monolingual children&#x27;s vocabulary scores (Core et al., 2011). Despite a variation in vocabulary scores, there was absolutely no difference between monolingual and bilingual children in terms of total vocabulary size and total vocabulary gains (Core et al., 2011). Bilingual children and monolingual children have the same vocabulary size and gain the same vocabulary knowledge.

===Creative functioning===
In a study testing for creative functioning that involved monolingual and bilingual children in Singapore, researchers found that monolinguals performed better on fluency and flexibility than bilinguals. The trend was reversed, however, on tests for originality and elaboration.

===Mental well-being===
In another recent study in Canada, it has been shown that monolinguals were worse at the onset of senility than bilinguals. In the study, it seems that being bilingual is associated with a delay of dementia by four years as compared to monolinguals. Bialystok&#x27;s most recent work also shows that lifelong bilingualism can delay symptoms of dementia.

It is believed that bilingualism contributes to cognitive reserve by preventing effects of cognitive delay and prolonging the onset of sicknesses such as dementia. Cognitive reserve refers to the idea that engaging in stimulating physical or mental activity maintains cognitive functioning (Bialystok et al., 2012). In that case, knowing more than one language is similar to stimulating mental activity. To test whether or not bilingualism contributes to cognitive reserve, Bialystok et al. (2012) looked at hospital records among monolingual and bilingual adults who have dementia. The researchers found that elderly bilingual adults were diagnosed with dementia about three to four years later than elderly monolingual adults. The results have been replicated and validated, with outside factors being controlled. In fact, outside factors such as socioeconomic status and cultural differences always helped monolinguals, making the argument the bilingualism contributes to cognitive reserve even stronger (Bialystok et al., 2012). That finding enhances the fact that bilinguals are at an advantage because of their ability to speak two languages, not because of outside factors. A probable explanation for this phenomenon is that knowledge of multiple languages keeps the brain alert and therefore more mentally aware for a longer period of time.

===Emotion and behavior===
A study conducted with children in their early school years suggested that there are emotional and behavioural benefits to being bilingual. In the same study, the findings show that monolingual children, in particular non-English monolingual children, display more poor behavioural and emotional outcomes in their school years. The non-English monolingual children had the highest level of externalizing and internalizing behavioral problems by fifth grade (around 10–11 years of age), even though the children were all measured to have similar levels of internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems at the start. In contrast, the fluent bilingual and non-English dominant bilingual children were found to have the lowest level of these behavioural problems. The authors suggest that monolingualism seems to be a risk factor. However, if there is a supportive school environment with teachers who are experienced in ESL (English as a Second Language), children seem to have better emotional constitution.

===Memory performance===
In a study conducted at the University of Florida, which compared Native-English bilinguals to English monolinguals, although there was no difference in accuracy between the two groups, there was a slower response rate from bilinguals on tasks that involve latency of recognition of a list of abstract words and lexical decision tasks, but not in any of the other tasks used in their study. The researchers noted that the tasks where bilinguals had a significant disadvantage were those which were data-driven (subjects were given verbal input and asked to make decisions about it), as opposed to conceptually driven (subjects were asked to produce verbal output). The study differed from prior research in that the bilingual subjects were more balanced in their familiarity with their two languages. Mägiste hypothesized that the bilingual disadvantage could have been due to differential familiarity with the dominant language. They explained that for bilinguals, it could be because the acquiring and using of the second language meant that there was less time to process the first language, as compared to the monolingual participants in the study.

However, evidence from a research study shows that bilinguals have a faster reaction time in most working memory tasks. While a lot of research asserts that monolingual children outperform bilingual children, other research asserts the opposite. Research by Bialystok et al., as reported by Kapa and Colombo (2013, p. 233) shows that bilingual individuals perform better than monolingual individuals on a wide variety of cognitive tests, thus demonstrating cognitive control advantages. Two different concepts, attentional inhibition and attentional monitoring, are used to measure attentional control. In terms of attentional control, early bilingual learners showed the greatest advantage, compared to monolingual speakers and late bilingual speakers. In terms of overall performance on ATN, the three groups performed equally, but when age and verbal ability variables were controlled, there was a difference in reaction time. The early bilingual children&#x27;s reaction time was tremendously faster than the monolingual children, and only slightly faster than the late bilingual children (Kapa &amp; Colombo, 2013). Early bilingual learners showed that they simply responded most efficiently to the task at hand. The results from this study demonstrate the advantages bilingual children have with attentional control. This is likely because bilingual children are used to balancing more than one language at time, and are therefore used to focusing on which language is necessary at a certain time. By constantly being aware of what language to use and being able to successfully switch between languages, it makes sense that bilingual children would be better at directing and focusing their attention.

===Verbal and non-verbal cognitive development===
A 2012 study by the University of York published in &quot;Child Development&quot; journal reviewed the effects of the development of a child&#x27;s verbal and non-verbal language, matched between monolinguals and bilinguals in a particular language. Researchers compared about 100 6-year-old monolingual and bilingual children (monolingual in English; bilingual in English and Mandarin, bilingual in French and English, bilingual in Spanish and English), to test their verbal and non-verbal communication cognitive development. The research takes into consideration factors like the similarity of the language, the cultural background and education experience. These students mostly come from public schools from various areas, having similar social and economic background.

Results show that in the child&#x27;s early stage, multilingual kids are very different from one another in their language and cognitive skills development, and also when compared to monolingual children. When compared to monolinguals, multilingual children are slower in building up their vocabulary in every language. However, their metalinguistic development allowed them to understand better the structure of the language. They also performed better in non-verbal control tests. A non-verbal control test refers to the ability to focus and then able to divert their attention when being instructed to.

==Reasons for persistence==

===Convergence principle===
According to the convergence principle, language style tends to change to that of people who are liked and admired. Conversations in which one party speaks a language different from the other persons both are hard to maintain and have reduced intimacy. Thus, speech is usually adapted and accommodated for convenience, lack of misunderstanding and conflict and the maintenance of intimacy. In intermarriages, one partner tends to become monolingual, which also usually applies to the children.

===Predominance of English===

The predominance of English in many sectors, such as world trade, technology and science, has contributed to English-speaking societies being persistently monolingual, as there is little incentive to learn a second language if all dealings can be done in their native language; that is especially the case for English-speakers in the United States, particularly the Northern United States and most of the Southern United States, where everyday contact with other languages, such as Spanish and French is usually limited. The country&#x27;s large area and the most populous regions&#x27; distance from large non-English-speaking areas, such as Mexico and Quebec, increase the geographic and economic barriers to foreign travel. Nevertheless, the requirement for all school children to learn a foreign language in some English speaking countries and areas works against this to some extent. Although the country is economically interdependent with trade partners such as China, American corporations and heavily-Americanized subsidiaries of foreign corporations both mediate and control most citizens&#x27; contact with most other nations&#x27; products. There is a popular joke: &quot;What do you call a person who speaks three languages? A trilingual. What do you call a person who speaks two languages? A bilingual. What do you call a person who speaks one language? An American.&quot;

==Costs==
Snow and Hakuta write that in a cost-benefit analysis, the choosing of English as the official and national language often comes with additional costs on the society, as the alternative choice of multilingualism has its own benefits.

===Education===
Some of the education budget is allocated for foreign-language training, but fluency of foreign-language students is lower than those who learned it at home.

===Economic===
International business may be impeded by a lack of people competent in other languages.

===National security===
Money has to be spent to train foreign-service personnel in foreign languages.

===Time and effort===
Compared to the maintenance of a language that is learned at home, more time, effort and hard work are required to learn it in school.

===Job opportunities===
Kirkpatrick asserts that monolinguals are at a disadvantage to bilinguals in the international job market.

==In the media==
Lawrence Summers, in an article published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, discusses how to prepare for the future advancement of America. He also questioned the importance and necessity of learning foreign languages by remarking that &quot;English&#x27;s emergence as the global language, along with the rapid progress in machine translation and the fragmentation of languages spoken around the world, makes it less clear that the substantial investment necessary to speak a foreign tongue is universally worthwhile.&quot;

Others have disagreed with Summers&#x27; view. A week later, &quot;The New York Times&quot; hosted a discussion among six panelists, all of whom were for learning foreign languages and cited the benefits and advantages and the changing global landscape.

<text>Frank Ralph Nitto (born Francesco Raffaele Nitto, ; January 27, 1886 – March 19, 1943), known as Frank Nitti, was an Italian-American organized crime figure based in Chicago. Bodyguard of Al Capone, Nitti was in charge of all money flowing through the operation. Nitti later succeeded Capone as acting boss of the Chicago Outfit.

==Early life and prohibition==
Nitti was born Francesco Raffaele Nitto on January 27, 1886, in the town of Angri, province of Salerno, Campania, Italy. He was the second child of Luigi and Rosina (Fezza) Nitto. While later journalists reported Nitti and Al Capone were cousins, this was not in fact the case. Their families did, however, live blocks away from each other in Brooklyn, and had come from the same area in Italy. 

His father died in 1888, when Frank was two years old. Within a year, his mother married Francesco Dolendo. Although two children were born to the couple, neither survived—leaving Francesco and his older sister, Giovannina, the only children. 

Francesco Dolendo emigrated to the United States in July 1890, and the rest of the family followed in June 1893 when Nitti was seven. The family settled at 113 Navy Street, Brooklyn, New York City. Little Francesco attended public school and worked odd jobs after school to support the family. His 15-year-old sister married a 24-year-old man. His mother gave birth to his half-brother Raphael in 1894 and another child, Gennaro, in 1896. 

After the seventh grade, he quit school and worked as a pinsetter, factory worker, and barber. Al Capone&#x27;s family lived nearby, and Nitti was friends with Capone&#x27;s older brothers and their criminal gang (the Navy Street Boys).

A worsening relationship with Dolendo urged him to leave home in 1900 when Nitti was 14, to work in various local factories. Around 1910, at the age of 24, he left Brooklyn. The next years of his life are poorly documented, and little can be ascertained. He may have worked in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn around 1911. He probably moved to Chicago around 1913, working as a barber and making the acquaintance of gangsters Alex Louis Greenberg and Dion O&#x27;Banion. He married Chicagoan Rosa (Rose) Levitt in Dallas, Texas, on October 18, 1917. The couple&#x27;s movements after their marriage remain uncertain. 

By 1918, Nitti had settled at 914 South Halsted Street. Nitti quickly renewed his contacts with Greenberg and O&#x27;Banion, becoming a jewel thief, liquor smuggler, and fence. Through his liquor smuggling activities, Nitti came to the attention of Chicago crime boss John &quot;Papa Johnny&quot; Torrio and Torrio&#x27;s newly arrived soldier, Al Capone. Nitti, being a newcomer, and familiar with the Texas area, became a partner in the Galveston crime syndicate run by Johnny Jack Nounes. He is reported to have stolen a large sum of money from Nounes and fellow mobster Dutch Voight in 1924, after which Nitti fled back to Chicago. Years later, he was spotted at a Houston bar, which was brought to the attention of Nounes and Voight. The two Galveston mobsters found Nitti, drove him back to Galveston, and made him return the money he had stolen.

Under Torrio&#x27;s successor, Al Capone, Nitti&#x27;s reputation soared. Nitti ran Capone&#x27;s liquor smuggling and distribution operation, importing whisky from Canada and selling it through a network of speakeasies around Chicago. Nitti was one of Capone&#x27;s top lieutenants, trusted for his leadership skills and business acumen. Because Nitti&#x27;s ancestry was from the same town as Capone&#x27;s, he could help Capone penetrate the Sicilian and Camorra underworld in a way Capone alone never could. 

Capone thought so highly of Nitti that when he went to prison in 1929, he named Nitti as a member of a triumvirate that ran the mob in his place. Nitti was head of operations, with Jake &quot;Greasy Thumb&quot; Guzik as head of administration and Tony &quot;Joe Batters&quot; Accardo as head of enforcement. Despite his nickname, &quot;The Enforcer&quot;, Nitti used Mafia soldiers and others to commit violence rather than do it himself. In earlier days, Nitti had been one of Capone&#x27;s trusted personal bodyguards. Still, as he rose in the organization, Nitti&#x27;s business instinct dictated that he must personally avoid the &quot;dirty work&quot; for which hitmen were paid. Frank and Rose divorced in 1928, and shortly thereafter, he married Anna Ronga, daughter of a mob doctor and former neighbor of the Nittis in the 1920s. The couple adopted a son, Joseph, through the Tennessee Children&#x27;s Home Society.

==The Outfit under Nitti==
In 1931, both Nitti and Capone were convicted of tax evasion and sent to prison; however, Nitti received an 18-month sentence which was served at the United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, while Capone was sent away for 11 years. When Nitti was released on March 25, 1932, he took his place as the new boss of the Capone Gang.

While some revisionist historians claim that Nitti was a mere &quot;front boss&quot; while Paul &quot;The Waiter&quot; Ricca was the actual boss of the Chicago Outfit, both contemporary and modern accounts confirm that Capone&#x27;s successor was indeed Nitti. According to Nitti biographer Mars Eghigian, Nitti&#x27;s age, brilliance, and reputation in the underworld made him Capone&#x27;s personal choice for successor, rather than younger, less experienced mobsters such as Ricca or Murray Humphreys. 

In actuality, Ricca was merely the acting boss of the Chicago Outfit for six months between Capone&#x27;s October 1931 imprisonment and Nitti&#x27;s March 1932 release. With the recently released Nitti paranoid about violating his federal parole, Ricca was acting in the capacity of emissary that same month when he was arrested with Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, and other mobsters by Chicago police and prominently photographed. This picture caused some to incorrectly conclude that Ricca was the new boss of the Chicago mob.

With Nitti calling the shots, the Chicago Outfit branched out from prostitution and gambling into other areas, including control of labor unions (which led to the extortion of many businesses). On December 19, 1932, a team of Chicago police, headed by Detective Sergeants Harry Lang and Harry Miller, raided Nitti&#x27;s office in Room 554 at 221 N. LaSalle Street in Chicago. Lang shot Nitti three times in the back and neck. He then shot himself (a minor flesh wound) to make the shooting look like self-defense, claiming that Nitti had shot him first.

Court testimony later insisted that the murder attempt was personally ordered by newly elected Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who supposedly wanted to eliminate the Chicago Outfit in favor of gangsters who answered to him. Nitti survived the shooting and in February 1933 was acquitted of attempted murder. During that same trial, Miller testified that Lang received $15,000 (equal to $ today) to kill Nitti. Another uniformed officer at the shooting testified that Nitti was shot while unarmed. Harry Lang and Harry Miller were both fired from the police force and each fined $100 (equal to $ today) for simple assault.

Two months later, Cermak was shot and killed by Giuseppe Zangara while he was talking to President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt; Roosevelt was Zangara&#x27;s target, but missed. A conspiracy theory emerged sometime before 1999, originating in Chicago, asserting that Zangara was a hired killer working for Nitti. John William Tuohy, author of numerous books on organized crime in Chicago, after reviewing Secret Service records, described in detail in a 2002 article his interpretation of how and why Cermak was the real target and the relationship of the shooting to the rampant gang violence in Chicago. The theory is enhanced by numerous researchers, citing their analysis of court testimony, asserting that Cermak had directed an assassination attempt on Nitti fewer than three months earlier.

Anna Nitto died on November 19, 1940, in Mercy Hospital, Chicago, from an unspecified internal ailment. Nitti married Annette (Toni) Caravetta on May 14, 1942; she was widowed almost a year later when he committed suicide.

==Death==
In 1943, many top members of the Chicago Outfit were indicted for extorting the Hollywood film industry. Among those prosecuted were Nitti, Phil D&#x27;Andrea, Louis &quot;Little New York&quot; Campagna, Nick Circella, Charles &quot;Cherry Nose&quot; Gioe, Ralph Pierce, Ricca, and John &quot;Handsome Johnny&quot; Roselli. The Outfit was accused of trying to extort money from some of the largest movie studios, including Columbia Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, RKO Pictures, and 20th Century Fox. The studios had cooperated with The Outfit to avoid union trouble (unrest itself stirred up by the mob). 

At a meeting of Outfit leaders at Nitti&#x27;s home, Ricca blamed Nitti for the indictments. Ricca said that since this had been Nitti&#x27;s scheme and that of the FBI informant (Willie Bioff), one of Nitti&#x27;s trusted associates, Nitti should go to prison. A severe claustrophobe due to his first prison term, Nitti dreaded the idea of another prison confinement. It was also rumored that he was suffering from terminal cancer at this time. He ultimately decided to take his own life.

The day before his scheduled grand jury appearance, Nitti had breakfast with his wife in their home at 712 Selborne Road in Riverside, Illinois. When his wife was leaving for church, Nitti told her he planned to take a walk; then he began to drink heavily. He loaded a .32 caliber revolver, put it in his coat pocket, and walked five blocks to a local railroad yard. Conductor William F. Seebauer and switchmen L.M. Barnett and E.H. Moran were riding in the caboose, backing their train slowly southward over an ungated Cermak Road in North Riverside. The workers spotted an oblivious Nitti walking on the track away from them and shouted a warning. Nitti walked off the tracks, staggering towards the fence. Three shots rang out. The workers thought Nitti was shooting at them but then realized he was trying to shoot himself in the head. The final, fatal bullet entered behind Nitti&#x27;s right ear and lodged in the top of his skull. Police Chief Allen Rose of North Riverside, rushing to the scene with a sergeant and several beat patrolmen, recognized Nitti immediately. An autopsy by William McNalley, coroner&#x27;s toxicologist, showed that Nitti&#x27;s blood alcohol level was 0.23. A coroner&#x27;s jury ruled the following day that Nitti &quot;committed suicide while temporarily insane and in a despondent frame of mind&quot;.
Frank Nitti died on March 19, 1943, at the age of 57. Nitti is buried at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois. Controversy has persisted regarding the interment of a suicide in a Catholic cemetery. Nitti&#x27;s grave can be found to the left of the main Roosevelt Road entrance, about from the gate. To the right of the gate is the family plot containing the grave of Al Capone, marked by a white monument stone. Straight up from the gate are the graves of Dean O&#x27;Banion and Hymie Weiss, both North Side Gang members who the Chicago Outfit killed under Capone.

<text>Melbury Abbas is a village and civil parish in north Dorset, England. It is situated at the edge of the Blackmore Vale under the scarp of Cranborne Chase, south-southwest of the town of Shaftesbury. The parish includes West Melbury and part of Cann Common.

In the 2011 census the parish had 147 dwellings, 134 households and a population of 305.

== History ==
In 1086 Melbury Abbas was recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Meleberie&quot;. 

It was in Sixpenny Hundred and had 47 households, 12 ploughlands and 4 mills.

The lord and tenant-in-chief was Shaftesbury Abbey.

== Church of St Thomas == 
This is on the south side of the village and as well as a square tower at the south west end, has a large spire mounted on the SW corner of the top of the tower. 

The original stone church of Norman times had a tower with three bells, at least one transept, and a west door. It survived until 1852 when it was in poor condition and was demolished.
The present church is said to cost Sir Richard Glyn £2500.00. At this time Sir Richard owned most of the village. On 21 December 1852 the Bishop of Salisbury dedicated the new church to St Thomas, whose feast day it was. 

== Road Connections ==
Melbury Abbas village is on an unclassified road that follows a hilltop route roughly parallel to the A350 primary route that passes west of the village between Shaftesbury and Blandford. The A350 follows a lower route through villages in the Blackmore Vale. However, much traffic uses the hilltop route as an alternative because it is straighter and passes through fewer villages. Melbury Abbas is the only bottleneck on this road, where it dips down into the valley and becomes narrower.

Dorset County Council have considered bypass schemes, but none has got further than preliminary stages because the village is surrounded by conservation land.

<doc id="1068797" wikidata="Q4767336" url="?curid=1068797" title="Anna McNeill Whistler">
<text>Anna Matilda (née McNeill) Whistler (September 27, 1804 – January 31, 1881) was the mother of American-born, British-based painter James McNeill Whistler, who made her the subject of his famous painting &quot;Arrangement in Grey and Black No.1&quot;, often titled &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot;.

==Biography==

Anna McNeill Whistler was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, to Charles Daniel McNeill (1756–1828), a physician, and Martha Kingsley McNeill, daughter of Zephaniah Kingsley Sr. (one of the founders of the University of New Brunswick) and youngest sister of Zephaniah Kingsley (a slave trader and plantation owner, and the husband of the African Ana Madgigine Jai).

In 1831, she married George Washington Whistler, a civil engineer, former army officer, and widower who had three children. She gave birth to two sons, James McNeill Whistler and William McNeill Whistler. Her husband soon accepted a job in Russia as a railway engineer between Moscow and St. Petersburg. She had a son named Kirkie who died age four. A son named Charlie also died before Anna had moved to Russia.

When James was nine, his art brought the attention of Scottish painter Sir William Allan. Anna then enrolled James in the Imperial Academy of Arts at St. Petersburg. Her husband died in 1849 from cholera.

Anna returned to the United States, to live in Connecticut. Her daughter remained in England after marrying a surgeon. It was then the family lived in poverty but her daughter helped William and James attend private school. James entered West Point just before his 17th birthday, was expelled soon after, and moved back to England. Her son William became a surgeon in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War.

In 1863, at the advice of her stepdaughter and son, she moved to England, moving in with her son James in London. She later relocated to St Mary&#x27;s Terrace, Hastings, east Sussex. She was surprised by her son&#x27;s &quot;flamboyant Bohemian lifestyle&quot;; however, she tolerated it, and befriended some of his friends as well. This was around the time the famous painting was made, although it was not the only one. Anna was 67 during the painting of the picture. She died a decade later and is buried in Hastings Cemetery.

<doc id="1068799" wikidata="Q1660964" url="?curid=1068799" title="Incident Command System">
<text>The Incident Command System (ICS) is a standardized approach to the command, control, and coordination of emergency response providing a common hierarchy within which responders from multiple agencies can be effective.

ICS was initially developed to address problems of inter-agency responses to wildfires in California but is now a component of the National Incident Management System (NIMS) in the US, where it has evolved into use in all-hazards situations, ranging from active shootings to hazmat scenes. In addition, ICS has acted as a pattern for similar approaches internationally.

==Overview==
ICS consists of a standard management hierarchy and procedures for managing temporary incident(s) of any size. ICS procedures should be pre-established and sanctioned by participating authorities, and personnel should be well-trained prior to an incident.

ICS includes procedures to select and form temporary management hierarchies to control funds, personnel, facilities, equipment, and communications. Personnel are assigned according to established standards and procedures previously sanctioned by participating authorities. ICS is a system designed to be used or applied from the time an incident occurs until the requirement for management and operations no longer exist.

ICS is interdisciplinary and organizationally flexible to meet the following management challenges:
* Meets the needs of a jurisdiction to cope with incidents of any kind or complexity (i.e. it expands or contracts as needed).
* Allows personnel from a wide variety of agencies to meld rapidly into a common management structure with common terminology.
* Give logistical and administrative support to operational staff.
* Be cost-effective by avoiding duplication of efforts, and continuing overheads.
* Provide a unified, centrally authorized emergency organization.

==History==
The ICS concept was formed in 1968 at a meeting of Fire Chiefs in Southern California. The program reflects the management hierarchy of the US Navy, and at first was used mainly to fight California wildfires. During the 1970s ICS was fully developed during massive wildfire suppression efforts in California (FIRESCOPE) that followed a series of catastrophic wildfires, starting with the massive Laguna fire in 1970. Property damage ran into the millions, and many people died or were injured. Studies determined that response problems often related to communication and management deficiencies rather than lack of resources or failure of tactics.

Weaknesses in incident management were often due to:
* Lack of accountability, including unclear chain of command and supervision.
* Poor communication due to both inefficient uses of available communications systems and conflicting codes and terminology.
* Lack of an orderly, systematic planning process.
* No effective predefined way to integrate inter-agency requirements into the management structure and planning process.
* &quot;Freelancing&quot; by individuals within the first-response team without direction from a team leader (IC) and those with specialized skills during an incident and without coordination with other first responders
* Lack of knowledge with common terminology during an incident.

Emergency managers determined that the existing management structures – frequently unique to each agency – did not scale to dealing with massive mutual aid responses involving dozens of distinct agencies and when these various agencies worked together their specific training and procedures clashed. As a result, a new command and control paradigm was collaboratively developed to create a consistent, integrated framework for the management of all incidents from small incidents to large, multi-agency emergencies. 

At the beginning of this work, despite the recognition that there were incident or field level shortfalls in organization and terminology, there was no mention of the need to develop an on the ground incident management system like ICS. Most of the efforts were focused on the multi-agency coordination challenges above the incident or field level. It was not until 1972 when Firefighting Resources of Southern California Organized for Potential Emergencies (FIRESCOPE) was formed that this need was recognized and the concept of ICS was first discussed. Also, ICS was originally called Field Command Operations System.

ICS became a national model for command structures at a fire, crime scene or major incident. ICS was used in New York City at the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993. On 1 March 2004, the Department of Homeland Security, in accordance with the passage of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-5) calling for a standardized approach to incident management among all federal, state, and local agencies, developed the National Incident Management System (NIMS) which integrates ICS. Additionally, it was mandated that NIMS (and thus ICS) must be used to manage emergencies to receive federal funding.

The Superfund Amendment and Re-authorization Act title III mandated that all first responders to a hazardous materials emergency must be properly trained and equipped in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120(q). This standard represents OSHA&#x27;s recognition of ICS.

HSPD-5 and thus the National Incident Management System came about as a direct result of the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, which created numerous All-Hazard, Mass Casualty, multi-agency incidents.

In the United States, ICS has been tested by more than 30 years of emergency and non-emergency applications. All levels of government are required to maintain differing levels of ICS training and private-sector organizations regularly use ICS for management of events. ICS is widespread in use from law enforcement to every-day business, as the basic goals of clear communication, accountability, and the efficient use of resources are common to incident and emergency management as well as daily operations. ICS is mandated by law for all Hazardous Materials responses nationally and for many other emergency operations in most states. In practice, virtually all emergency medical services and disaster response agencies use ICS, in part after the United States Department of Homeland Security mandated the use of ICS for emergency services throughout the United States as a condition for federal preparedness funding. As part of FEMA&#x27;s National Response Plan (NRP), the system was expanded and integrated into the National Incident Management System (NIMS).

In Canada the Incident Command System (ICS) has gained recognition and use within various governmental and emergency response agencies. Canadian authorities have embraced ICS principles as an effective framework for managing incidents and emergencies, ensuring a coordinated and efficient response.

Federal, provincial, and territorial governments in Canada have adopted ICS as a key component of their emergency management strategies. This adoption is driven by the need to establish clear lines of communication, streamline resource allocation, and maintain accountability during critical incidents. Federal agencies such as Public Safety Canada promote the use of ICS to enhance the nation&#x27;s emergency preparedness and response capabilities. Canada&#x27;s proximity to the United States has facilitated the exchange of best practices in emergency management, including the adoption of ICS. Cross-border cooperation and training exercises have enabled Canadian agencies to align their incident management practices with those of their American counterparts.

New Zealand has implemented a similar system, known as the Coordinated Incident Management System, Australia has the Australasian Inter-Service Incident Management System and British Columbia, Canada, has BCEMS developed by the Emergency Management and Climate Readiness.

In a 2003 disaster reduction strategy report, a United Nations task force recommended the use of ICS as an international standard for wildfire incidents.

In Brazil, ICS is also used by The Fire Department of the State of Rio de Janeiro (CBMERJ) and by the Civil Defense of the State of Rio de Janeiro in every emergency or large-scale events.

As of 11 March 2024 in Mexico the ICS is regulated by a federal norm: NOM-010-SSPC-2019. All municipal, state and federal agencies are obligated by this norm. 

==Basis==
=== Incidents ===

Incidents are defined within ICS as &quot;unplanned situations necessitating a response&quot;. Examples of incidents may include:
* Cyberattack - a cybersecurity incident, or major information security breach
* Emergency medical situations (ambulance service)
* Hazardous material spills, releases to the air (toxic chemicals), releases to a drinking water supply
* Hostage crises and active shooter situations. 
* Man-made disasters such as vehicle crashes, industrial accidents, train derailments, or structure fires
* Natural disasters such as wildfires, flooding, earthquake or tornado
* Public health incidents, such as disease outbreaks
* Search-and-rescue operations
* Technological crisis, e.g. system outages
* Terrorist attacks
* Traffic incidents

===Events===
Events are defined within ICS as &quot;planned situations&quot;. Incident command is increasingly applied to events both in emergency management and non-emergency management settings. Examples of events may include:
* Concerts
* Parades and other ceremonies
* Fairs and other gatherings
* Training exercises

==Key concepts==
=== Unity of command ===
Each individual participating in the operation reports to only one supervisor. This eliminates the potential for individuals to receive conflicting orders from a variety of supervisors, thus increasing accountability, preventing freelancing, improving the flow of information, helping with the coordination of operational efforts, and enhancing operational safety. This concept is fundamental to the ICS chain of command structure.

===Common terminology===
Individual response agencies previously developed their protocols separately, and subsequently developed their terminology separately. This can lead to confusion as a word may have a different meaning for each organization.

When different organizations are required to work together, the use of common terminology is an essential element in team cohesion and communications, both internally and with other organizations responding to the incident.

An incident command system promotes the use of a common terminology and has an associated glossary of terms that help bring consistency to position titles, the description of resources and how they can be organized, the type and names of incident facilities, and a host of other subjects. The use of common terminology is most evident in the titles of command roles, such as &quot;Incident Commander&quot;, &quot;Safety Officer&quot; or &quot;Operations Section Chief&quot;.

===Management by objective===
Incidents are managed by aiming towards specific objectives. Objectives are ranked by priority; should be as specific as possible; must be attainable; and if possible given a working time-frame. Objectives are accomplished by first outlining strategies (general plans of action), then determining appropriate tactics (how the strategy will be executed) for the chosen strategy.

===Flexible and modular organization===
Incident Command structure is organized in such a way as to expand and contract as needed by the incident scope, resources and hazards. Command is established in a top-down fashion, with the most important and authoritative positions established first. For example, Incident Command is established by the first arriving unit.

Only positions that are required at the time should be established. In most cases, very few positions within the command structure will need to be activated. For example, a single fire truck at a dumpster fire will have the officer filling the role of IC, with no other roles required. As more trucks get added to a larger incident, more roles will be delegated to other officers and the Incident Commander (IC) role will probably be handed to a more-senior officer.

Only in the largest and most complex operations would the full ICS organization be staffed. Conversely, as an incident scales down, roles will be merged back up the tree until there is just the IC role remaining.

===Span of control===
To limit the number of responsibilities and resources being managed by any individual, the ICS requires that any single person&#x27;s span of control should be between three and seven individuals, with five being ideal. In other words, one manager should have no more than seven people working under them at any given time. If more than seven resources are being managed by an individual, then that individual is being overloaded and the command structure needs to be expanded by delegating responsibilities (e.g. by defining new sections, divisions, or task forces). If fewer than three, then the position&#x27;s authority can probably be absorbed by the next highest rung in the chain of command.

===Coordination===
One of the benefits of the ICS is that it allows a way to coordinate a set of organizations who may otherwise work together sporadically. While much training material emphasizes the hierarchical aspects of the ICS, it can also be seen as an inter-organizational network of responders. These network qualities allow the ICS flexibility and expertise of a range of organizations. But the network aspects of the ICS also create management challenges. One study of ICS after-action reports found that ICS tended to enjoy higher coordination when there was strong pre-existing trust and working relationships between members, but struggled when authority of the ICS was contested and when the networks of responders was highly diverse. Coordination on any incident or event is facilitated with the implementation of the following concepts:

===Incident Action Plans===
&quot;Incident action plans&quot; (IAPs) ensures cohesion amongst anyone involved toward strictly set goals. These goals are set for specific operational periods. They provide supervisors with direct action plans to communicate incident objectives to both operational and support personnel. They include measurable, strategic objectives set for achievement within a time frame (also known as an operational period) which is usually 12 hours but can be any length of time. Hazardous material incidents (hazmat) must be written, and are prepared by the planning section, but other incident reports can be both verbal and/or written.

The consolidated IAP is a very important component of the ICS that reduces freelancing and ensures a coordinated response. At the simplest level, all incident action plans must have four elements:
* What do we want to do?
* Who is responsible for doing it?
* How do we communicate with each other?
* What is the procedure if someone is injured?

The content of the IAP is organized by a number of standardized ICS forms that allow for accurate and precise documentation of an incident.

====ICS forms====
* ICS 201 – Incident Briefing
* ICS 202 – Incident Objectives
* ICS 203 – Organization Assignment List
* ICS 204 – Assignment List
* ICS 205 – Incident Radio Communications Plan
* ICS 205A – Communications List
* ICS 206 – Medical Plan
* ICS 207 – Incident Organization Chart
* ICS 208 – Safety Message/Plan
* ICS 209 – Incident Summary
* ICS 210 – Resource Status Change
* ICS 211 – Incident Check-In List
* ICS 213 – General Message
* ICS 214 – Activity Log
* ICS 215 – Operational Planning Worksheet
* ICS 215A – Incident Action Plan Safety Analysis
* ICS 218 – Support Vehicle/Equipment Inventory
* ICS 219 – Resource Status Cards (T-Cards)
* ICS 220 – Air Operations Summary Worksheet
* ICS 221 – Demobilization Check-Out
* ICS 225 – Incident Personnel Performance Rating

===Comprehensive resource management===
&quot;Comprehensive resource management&quot; is a key management principle that implies that all assets and personnel during an event need to be tracked and accounted for. It can also include processes for reimbursement for resources, as appropriate. Resource management includes processes for: 
* Categorizing resources
* Ordering resources
* Dispatching resources
* Tracking resources
* Recovering resources

Comprehensive resource management ensures that visibility is maintained over all resources so they can be moved quickly to support the preparation and response to an incident, and ensuring a graceful demobilization. It also applies to the classification of resources by type and kind, and the categorization of resources by their status.
* Assigned resources are those that are working on a field assignment under the direction of a supervisor.
* Available resources are those that are ready for deployment(staged), but have not been assigned to a field assignment.
* Out-of-service resources are those that are not in either the &quot;available&quot; or &quot;assigned&quot; categories. Resources can be &quot;out-of-service&quot; for a variety of reasons including: resupplying after a sortie (most common), shortfall in staffing, personnel taking a rest, damaged or inoperable.

T-Cards (ICS 219, Resource Status Card) are most commonly used to track these resources. The cards are placed in T-Card racks located at an Incident Command Post for easy updating and visual tracking of resource status.

===Integrated communications===
Developing an integrated voice and data communications system, including equipment, systems, and protocols, must occur prior to an incident.

Effective ICS communications include three elements:
* Modes: The &quot;hardware&quot; systems that transfer information.
* Planning: Planning for the use of all available communications resources.
* Networks: The procedures and processes for transferring information internally and externally.

==Composition==
=== Incident commander ===
* Single incident commander – Most incidents involve a single incident commander. In these incidents, a single person commands the incident response and is the decision-making final authority.
* Unified command – A unified command involves two or more individuals sharing the authority normally held by a single incident commander. Unified command is used on larger incidents usually when multiple agencies or multiple jurisdictions are involved. A Unified command typically includes a command representative from major involved agencies and/or jurisdictions with one from that group to act as the spokesman, though not designated as an Incident Commander. A Unified Command acts as a single entity. It is important to note, that in Unified Command the command representatives will appoint a single operations section chief.

* Area command – During multiple-incident situations, an area command may be established to provide for incident commanders at separate locations. Generally, an area commander will be assigned – a single person – and the area command will operate as a logistical and administrative support. Area commands usually do not include an operations function.

===Command staff===
* Safety officer – The safety officer monitors safety conditions and develops measures for assuring the safety of all assigned personnel.
* Public information officer – The public information officer (PIO or IO) serves as the conduit for information to and from internal and external stakeholders, including the media or other organizations seeking information directly from the incident or event. While less often discussed, the public information officer is also responsible for ensuring that an incident&#x27;s command staff are kept apprised as to what is being said or reported about an incident. This allows public questions to be addressed, rumors to be managed, and ensures that other such public relations issues are not overlooked.
* Liaison officer – A liaison serves as the primary contact for supporting agencies assisting at an incident.

===General staff===
* Operations section chief: Tasked with directing all actions to meet the incident objectives.
* Planning section chief: Tasked with the collection and display of incident information, primarily consisting of the status of all resources and overall status of the incident.
* Finance/administration section chief: Tasked with tracking incident-related costs, personnel records, requisitions, and administrating procurement contracts required by Logistics.
* Logistics section chief: Tasked with providing all resources, services, and support required by the incident.

===200-Level ICS===
At the ICS 200 level, the function of Information and Intelligence is added to the standard ICS staff as an option. This role is unique in ICS as it can be arranged in multiple ways based on the judgement of the Incident Commander and needs of the incident. The three possible arrangements are:
* Information &amp; intelligence officer, a position on the command staff.
* Information &amp; intelligence section, a section headed by an information &amp; intelligence section chief, a general staff position.
* Information &amp; intelligence branch, headed by an information &amp; intelligence branch director, this branch is a part of the planning section.

===300-Level ICS===
At the ICS 300 level, the focus is on entry-level management of small-scale, all-hazards incidents with emphasis on the scalability of ICS. It acts as an introduction to the utilization of more than one agency and the possibility of numerous operational periods. It also involves an introduction to the emergency operations center.

===400-Level ICS===
At the ICS 400 level, the focus is on large, complex incidents. Topics covered include the characteristics of incident complexity, the approaches to dividing an incident into manageable components, the establishment of an &quot;area command&quot;, and the multi-agency coordination system (MACS).

==Design==
=== Personnel ===
ICS is organized by levels, with the supervisor of each level holding a unique title (e.g. only a person in charge of a section is labeled &quot;chief&quot;; a &quot;director&quot; is exclusively the person in charge of a branch). Levels (supervising person&#x27;s title) are:
:* Incident commander
::* Command staff member (officer) – command staff
::* Section (chief) – general staff
:::* Branch (director)
::::* Division (supervisor) – A division is a unit arranged by geography, along jurisdictional lines if necessary, and not based on the makeup of the resources within the division.
::::* Group (supervisor) – A group is a unit arranged for a purpose, along agency lines if necessary, or based on the makeup of the resources within the group.
:::::* Unit, team, or force (leader) – Such as &quot;communications unit,&quot; &quot;medical strike team,&quot; or a &quot;reconnaissance task force.&quot; A strike team is composed of same resources (four ambulances, for instance) while a task force is composed of different types of resources (one ambulance, two fire trucks, and a police car, for instance).
::::::* Individual resource. This is the smallest level within ICS and usually refers to a single person or piece of equipment. It can refer to a piece of equipment &quot;and&quot; operator, and less often to multiple people working together.

===Facilities===
ICS uses a standard set of facility nomenclature. ICS facilities include: pre-designated incident facilities: Response operations can form a complex structure that must be held together by response personnel working at different and often widely separate incident facilities. These facilities can include:

* Incident command post (ICP): The ICP is the location where the incident commander operates during response operations. There is only one ICP for each incident or event, but it may change locations during the event. Every incident or event must have some form of an incident command post. The ICP may be located in a vehicle, trailer, tent, or within a building. The ICP will be positioned outside of the present and potential hazard zone but close enough to the incident to maintain command. The ICP will be designated by the name of the incident, e.g., Trail Creek ICP.
* Staging area: Can be a location at or near an incident scene where tactical response resources are stored while they await assignment. Resources in staging area are under the control status. Staging areas should be located close enough to the incident for a timely response, but far enough away to be out of the immediate impact zone. There may be more than one staging area at an incident. Staging areas can be collocated with the ICP, bases, camps, helibases, or helispots.
* A base is the location from which primary logistics and administrative functions are coordinated and administered. The base may be collocated with the incident command post. There is only one base per incident, and it is designated by the incident name. The base is established and managed by the logistics section. The resources in the base are always out-of-service.
* Camps: Locations, often temporary, within the general incident area that are equipped and staffed to provide sleeping, food, water, sanitation, and other services to response personnel that are too far away to use base facilities. Other resources may also be kept at a camp to support incident operations if a base is not accessible to all resources. Camps are designated by geographic location or number. Multiple camps may be used, but not all incidents will have camps.
* A helibase is the location from which helicopter-centered air operations are conducted. Helibases are generally used on a more long-term basis and include such services as fueling and maintenance. The helibase is usually designated by the name of the incident, e.g. Trail Creek helibase.
* Helispots are more temporary locations at the incident, where helicopters can safely land and take off. Multiple helispots may be used.

Each facility has unique location, space, equipment, materials, and supplies requirements that are often difficult to address, particularly at the outset of response operations. For this reason, responders should identify, pre-designate and pre-plan the layout of these facilities, whenever possible.

On large or multi-level incidents, higher-level support facilities may be activated. These could include:

* Emergency operations center (EOC): An emergency operations center is a central command and control facility responsible for carrying out the principles of emergency preparedness and emergency management, or disaster management functions at a strategic level during an emergency, and ensuring the continuity of operation of a company, political subdivision or other organization. An EOC is responsible for the strategic overview, or &quot;big picture&quot;, of the disaster, and does not normally directly control field assets, instead making operational decisions and leaving tactical decisions to lower commands. The common functions of all EOC&#x27;s is to collect, gather and analyze data; make decisions that protect life and property, maintain continuity of the organization, within the scope of applicable laws; and disseminate those decisions to all concerned agencies and individuals. In most EOC&#x27;s there is one individual in charge, and that is the Emergency Manager.
* Joint information center (JIC): A JIC is the facility whereby an incident, agency, or jurisdiction can support media representatives. Often co-located – even permanently designated – in a community or state EOC the JIC provides the location for interface between the media and the PIO. Most often the JIC also provides both space and technical assets (Internet, telephone, power) necessary for the media to perform their duties. A JIC very often becomes the &quot;face&quot; of an incident as it is where press releases are made available as well as where many broadcast media outlets interview incident staff. It is not uncommon for a permanently established JIC to have a window overlooking an EOC and/or a dedicated background showing agency logos or other symbols for televised interviews. The National Response Coordination Center (NRCC) at FEMA has both, for example, allowing televised interviews to show action in the NRCC behind the interviewer/interviewee while an illuminated &quot;Department of Homeland Security&quot; sign, prominently placed on the far wall of the NRCC, is thus visible during such interviews.
* Joint operations center (JOC): A JOC is usually pre-established, often operated 24/7/365, and allows multiple agencies to have a dedicated facility for assigning staff to interface and interact with their counterparts from other agencies. Although frequently called something other than a JOC, many locations and jurisdictions have such centers, often where Federal, state, and/or local agencies (often law enforcement) meet to exchange strategic information and develop and implement tactical plans. Large mass gathering events, such as a presidential inauguration, will also utilize JOC-type facilities although they are often not identified as such or their existence even publicized.
* Multiple agency coordination center (MACC): The MACC is a central command and control facility responsible for the strategic, or &quot;big picture&quot; of a disaster. A MACC is often used when multiple incidents are occurring in one area or are particularly complex for various reasons such as when scarce resources must be allocated across multiple requests. Personnel within the MACC use multi-agency coordination to guide their operations. The MACC coordinates activities between multiple agencies and incidents and does not normally directly control field assets, but makes strategic decisions and leaves tactical decisions to individual agencies. The common functions of all MACC&#x27;s is to collect, gather and analyze data; make decisions that protect life and property, maintain continuity of the government or corporation, within the scope of applicable laws; and disseminate those decisions to all concerned agencies and individuals. While often similar to an EOC, the MACC is a separate entity with a defined area or mission and lifespan whereas an EOC is a permanently established facility and operation for a political jurisdiction or agency. EOCs often, but not always, follow the general ICS principles but may use other structures or management (such as an emergency support function (ESF) or hybrid ESF/ICS model) schemas. For many jurisdictions the EOC is where elected officials will be located during an emergency and, like a MACC, supports but does not command an incident.

===Equipment===
ICS uses a standard set of equipment nomenclature. ICS equipment include:
* Tanker – This is an aircraft that carries fuel (fuel tanker) or water (water tanker).
* Tender – Like a tanker, but a ground vehicle, also carrying fuel (fuel tender), water (water tender), or even fire fighting foam (foam tender).

===Computers===
The importance of access to computer systems is becoming more common within the advancements to technology and to support the standardised approach to incident and emergency response. Commonly referred to within the Command and control structure within United States Army, computers and computer-based systems allow responders to interface with each other to have access to the latest information for decision making. See Incident Command Post (ICP) for more information.

===Type and kind===
The &quot;type&quot; of resource describes the size or capability of a resource. For instance, a 50 kW (for a generator) or a 3-ton (for a truck). Types are designed to be categorized as &quot;Type 1&quot; through &quot;Type 5&quot; formally, but in live incidents more specific information may be used.

The &quot;kind&quot; of resource describes what the resource is. For instance, generator or a truck. The &quot;type&quot; of resource describes a performance capability for a kind of resource for instance,

In both type and kind, the objective must be included in the resource request. This is done to widen the potential resource response. As an example, a resource request for a &quot;small aircraft for aerial reconnaissance of a search and rescue scene&quot; may be satisfied by a National Guard OH-58 Kiowa helicopter (type &amp; kind: rotary-wing aircraft, Type II/III) or by a Civil Air Patrol Cessna 182 (type &amp; kind: fixed-wing aircraft, Type I). In this example, requesting only a fixed-wing or a rotary-wing, or requesting by type may prevent the other resource&#x27;s availability from being known.

===Command transfer===
A role of responsibility can be transferred during an incident for several reasons: As the incident grows a more qualified person is required to take over as Incident Commander to handle the ever-growing needs of the incident, or in reverse where as an incident reduces in size command can be passed down to a less qualified person (but still qualified to run the now-smaller incident) to free up highly qualified resources for other tasks or incidents. Other reasons to transfer command include jurisdictional change if the incident moves locations or area of responsibility, or normal turnover of personnel due to extended incidents. The transfer of command process always includes a transfer of command briefing, which may be oral, written, or a combination of both.

<text>Puddletown is a village in the civil parish of Athelhampton and Puddletown, in Dorset, England. It is situated by the River Piddle, from which it derives its name, about northeast of the county town Dorchester. Its earlier name Piddletown fell out of favour, probably because of connotations of the word &quot;piddle&quot;. The name Puddletown was officially sanctioned in the late 1950s. Puddletown&#x27;s civil parish covers and extends to the River Frome to the south. In 2013, the estimated population of the civil parish was 1450.

Puddletown&#x27;s parish church has significant architectural interest, particularly its furnishings and monuments. It has a 12th-century font and well-preserved woodwork, including 17th-century box pews. Thomas Hardy took an interest in the church, and the village provided the inspiration for the fictional settlement of Weatherbury in his novel &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot;; Weatherbury Farm, the home of principal character Bathsheba Everdene, is based on a manor house within the parish.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Puddletown&quot; means &#x27;farmstead on the River Piddle&#x27;. It derives from the Old English , a river-name meaning &#x27;fen&#x27; or &#x27;marsh&#x27;, and , meaning &#x27;farmstead&#x27;. Several settlements along the river derive their names from it. In the upper reaches, Piddletrenthide and Piddlehinton retain the &quot;Piddle&quot; river name, whereas downstream Puddletown, Tolpuddle, Affpuddle, Briantspuddle and Turners Puddle use &quot;Puddle&quot;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as &quot;Pitretone&quot;, and in 1212 it was &quot;Pideleton&quot;. John Speed used &quot;Puddletown&quot; for his county map of 1610. In 1848 Samuel Lewis used &quot;Piddletown&quot; in &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of England&quot;. In 1906 Sir Frederick Treves used &quot;Puddletown&quot; in &quot;Highways &amp; Byways in Dorset&quot;—describing it as &quot;the Town on the River Puddle&quot; and a &quot;curiously named place&quot;. In 1946 &quot;Piddletown&quot; was the name on voters lists. One explanation for the preference of &quot;Puddletown&quot; over &quot;Piddletown&quot; is that Major-General Charles William Thompson, who lived at Ilsington Lodge after returning from the Great War, pushed through the &quot;puddle&quot; variant because &quot;piddle&quot; had other connotations in army circles. The broadcaster and writer Ralph Wightman (1901–71), a native of the Piddle Valley and one-time Puddletown resident, believed it was due to Victorian &quot;refinement&quot;, as he recalled that in his youth elderly aunts referred to Piddletrenthide as just &quot;Trenthide&quot;. Roland Gant in &quot;Dorset Villages&quot; stated more explicitly that the Victorians used &quot;puddle&quot; because &quot;piddle&quot; &quot;became a euphemism for &#x27;piss&#x27;&quot;. The use of &quot;Puddletown&quot; rather than &quot;Piddletown&quot; was officially preserved in the late 1950s, when, according to Wightman, &quot;a long County Council debate solemnly decided Piddletown should be Puddletown&quot;.

The other rivers of the parish have names that derive from Celtic river-names: the Frome, which forms the parish&#x27;s southern boundary, means &#x27;fair, fine or brisk&#x27;, and the Devil&#x27;s Brook, which forms the north-eastern boundary, means &#x27;dark stream&#x27;.

==History==

Evidence of prehistoric human occupation in the parish exists in the form of 30 round barrows, about half of which are sited over chalk and half over Reading Beds. Many of the barrows have been damaged by more recent activities. The remains of strip lynchets of &#x27;Celtic&#x27; fields have been found near a few of the barrows. One of the three &#x27;Rainbarrows&#x27; on Duddle Heath has been excavated; bucket urns containing cremations from the site were taken to the Dorset Museum.

The Roman road between Durnovaria (now Dorchester) and Badbury Rings passed through the area of the civil parish; it cut a WSW-ENE route through Puddletown Heath, between the village and the River Frome. In the 21st century a section of the road, which is wide, was discovered in Puddletown Forest.

Part of the arm of a 9th- or 10th-century stone cross was discovered when a house in the village—Styles House, near the River Piddle—was demolished. The cross might have been connected with a meeting place. The fragment was incorporated into the parish church&#x27;s new chancel when it was rebuilt in 1911.
At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, Puddletown was a large and important manor that contained several villages, with 1,600 sheep recorded. In the 13th century, during the reign of Henry III, the manor of &#x27;Pidele Bardolfeston town&#x27; was owned by John of Monmouth, and leased to Sir Alfred Lincoln: on Monmouth&#x27;s death, it was inherited by Lady Albretha Boterell and Lady Joan Nevill.

Except for Puddletown village, the several small settlements within Puddletown parish have all either diminished or disappeared. The other settlements were Cheselbourne Ford (beside the Devil&#x27;s Brook in the northeast of the parish), Bardolfeston (about half a mile northeast of Puddletown village, just north of the River Piddle), Hyde (now Druce Farm), Waterston, South Louvard (now Higher Waterston), Little Piddle (now Little Puddle Farm in neighbouring Piddlehinton parish) and Ilsington (in the south of the parish, by the River Frome). Cheselbourne Ford and Bardolfeston are abandoned. Cheselbourne Ford had a population of six in 1086, four in 1327, and by the mid-seventeenth century was just one ruinous house. In 1970 its remains covered about and consisted of ten closes bounded by low banks, though the site is not shown on modern Ordnance Survey maps. Records indicate that Bardolfeston was declining by the 13th century and, though still occupied in the 16th, it was completely deserted by the 17th century. Its site covers about and is well-preserved, revealing a -wide hollow way aligned southwest–northeast, with the sites of at least eleven houses alongside, though the southern end of the site was destroyed when watermeadows were later created along the river. The site at Waterston consists of earthworks covering about on a terrace on the south side of the River Piddle. Its medieval population was relatively stable, and ten households were recorded in 1662. The site was probably abandoned gradually.

In the early 17th century Puddletown was one of the first places in Dorset where the use of watermeadows developed; the practice occurred at least as early as 1620, and in 1629 the manorial court decided to allow some tenants to continue making the necessary watercourses that would enable &quot;the watering and Improvinge of theire groundes&quot;. Watermeadows are generally no longer used in southern England, though their physical remnants have persisted in many places; in Puddletown civil parish, several areas of watermeadow were shown by the Ordnance Survey as late as 1978, though none was shown in 2010.
Records from 1801 show that at that time agriculture was the main component of Puddletown&#x27;s economy, though cottage industry and artisan crafts were also an important element: 596 people in the parish were primarily employed in agriculture, with 221 employed in handicrafts, manufacture and trade. Cottage industry, often undertaken by women and children, was used to supplement agricultural income, though there were fewer opportunities for this after the French Revolution.

In 1830, Puddletown was one of the places in Dorset where agricultural labourers took part in the Captain Swing riots of southern England, protesting against very low wages and long working hours. Threshing machines were damaged and ricks burned. Wages were raised from about six or seven shillings per week to ten as a result.

To the east of the church is Ilsington House, also known as the Old Manor, which was built in the late 17th to early 18th century. It was originally owned by the 3rd Earl of Huntingdon and in 1724 by Robert Walpole. Between 1780 and 1830 it was leased to General Thomas Garth, principal equerry to King George III. The General adopted King George III&#x27;s illegitimate grandson by Princess Sophia, and brought him up at the manor. In 1861 the house was acquired by John Brymer and remained in the possession of the Brymer family for the next century. The family built new cottages and a reading room in the village, and a new manor next to the church, which they restored.

==Governance==
In local government, Puddletown is governed by Dorset Council at the highest tier, and Puddletown Area Parish Council at the lowest tier. Puddletown is part of the Puddletown and Lower Winterborne ward which elects 1 member to Dorset Council.

In the UK national parliament, Puddletown is within the West Dorset parliamentary constituency.

Historically, Puddletown was in the Dorchester Rural District from 1894 to 1974, and the West Dorset district from 1974 to 2019. On 1 April 2024 the parish was abolished and merged with Athelhampton to form &quot;Athelhampton and Puddletown&quot;.

==Geography==

Puddletown civil parish extends between the flood plain and watermeadows of the River Frome in the south to the chalk watershed of Puddletown Down in the north. It covers and is bisected by the River Piddle, which crosses it from west to east. Measured directly, Puddletown village is about northeast of Dorchester, west of Poole and southwest of Blandford Forum.

The bedrock geology of the parish comprises rocks formed in the Santonian and Campanian ages of the Cretaceous period and the Eocene age of the Palaeogene period. In places these are overlain by younger Quaternary drift material: river terrace and head deposits, clay-with-flints, and alluvium—the last found only in the valley floors of the larger watercourses. On Puddletown Heath (now mostly covered by Puddletown Forest) are more than 370 solution hollows or sinkholes; these constitute the largest concentration of hollows on the heathlands in the area.

The River Frome, which forms the southern boundary of the parish, is designated by Natural England as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Southwest of the village and almost wholly within the parish is Puddletown Forest, which covers and is managed by Forestry England. The forest is on the edge of the Dorset Heaths Natural Area and some of the forest is being restored to heathland; the heath flora consists of &quot;Calluna&quot;, &quot;Ulex gallii&quot;, &quot;Ulex minor&quot; and bilberry; fauna includes the rare smooth snake and sand lizard. Close to Puddletown Forest are Yellowham Wood and Ilsington Wood, which are ancient woodland sites, though Ilsington Wood has significant conifer plantings.

==Demography==
In 2014 the estimated population of Puddletown civil parish was 1,452. Figures from the 2011 census have been published for Puddletown parish combined with the small parish of Athelhampton to the east; in this area there were 663 dwellings, 614 households and a population of 1,405.

==Notable buildings==
Excluding ancient earthworks, there are fifty-six structures within the parish that are listed by Historic England for their historic or architectural interest, including two (the parish church and Waterston Manor) that are listed as Grade I, and three (Ilsington House, The Old Vicarage, and 8 The Square) that are Grade II*.
Puddletown&#x27;s parish church, dedicated to St Mary, has been described as being &quot;of considerable architectural interest&quot;, &quot;of exceptional interest for its furnishings and monuments&quot; and &quot;one of the most exciting parish churches in the county&quot;. It has 12th-century origins—parts of the tower date from 1180 to 1200—but was rebuilt and enlarged between the 13th and 16th centuries. The 12th-century font is particularly notable, being of a tapering beaker shape, with diapering depicting crossing stems and &quot;Acanthus&quot; leaves; its cover is an octagonal pyramid dating from about 1635, when the church interior was refitted. There is a panelled roof in the nave, and 17th-century box pews, pulpit and gallery. There are also a number of 15th- and 16th-century monumental brasses and some stained glass by Ninian Comper. The South or Martyn family chapel has three 16th-century tombs with alabaster effigies. In 1910 the church was partially restored by Charles Ponting. Thomas Hardy led an unsuccessful campaign to prevent enlargement of the original chancel.

Waterston Manor, about WNW of Puddletown village, is of early 17th-century origin, though it was largely rebuilt after a fire in 1863, and altered again in about 1911.

Ilsington House dates from the late 17th to early 18th century, with alterations made in the late 18th to early 19th century and enlargement later in the 19th. It has plaster-covered brick walls, quoins of ashlar, and a hipped slate roof. In 2000 it was presented with a &quot;Dorset Architectural Heritage Award&quot;.

The Old Vicarage, previously the east wing of the vicarage, was originally a timber-framed building built about 1600. It was clad in brick in the 18th century (after the vicarage had been extended west in 1722) and a third storey added early in the 19th century. The 1722 west-wing extension became 8 The Square and is listed separately.
==Community facilities==
Puddletown has a village hall, which has a kitchen and bar, full disabled facilities and access, and a capacity for between 100 and 160. Since 2013 it has also housed Puddletown Community Library, which is operated solely by volunteers. On Athelhampton Road there is a doctor&#x27;s surgery, which also treats patients who live in surrounding villages. Puddletown has a recreation ground on Three Lanes Way; it has one cricket pitch and two grass football pitches (one junior, one full-size).

==Literary connections==
Puddletown is the basis for the village of &quot;Weatherbury&quot; in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s novel &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot;. Weatherbury Farm, the house of Bathsheba Everdene, is based on Waterston Manor, between Puddletown and Piddlehinton. Hardy&#x27;s cousin, Tryphena Sparks, who was the inspiration for Hardy&#x27;s poem &quot;Thoughts of Phena at News of Her Death&quot;, lived in Puddletown.

==Notable people==
Cardinal Pole, the last Roman Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury, was vicar of the parish from 1532 to 1536. The author and broadcaster Ralph Wightman (1901–1971) lived in Puddletown in the later years of his life; he lived in the 16th-century Tudor Cottage in The Square. The writer Constantine Fitzgibbon (1919–1983) owned Waterston Manor for part of the 20th century.

<text>Guru Purnima () is a religious festival dedicated to offering respect to all the spiritual and academic gurus. It is celebrated as a festival in India, Nepal and Bhutan by Hindus, Jains and Buddhists. This festival is traditionally observed to honour one&#x27;s chosen spiritual teachers or leaders. It is observed on the full moon day (&quot;Purnima&quot;) in the month of &quot;Ashadha&quot; (June–July) according to the Hindu Calendar. It is also known as Vyasa Purnima, for it marks the birthday of Veda Vyasa, the sage who authored the Mahabharata and compiled the Vedas.

== Etymology ==
The word guru is derived from the Sanskrit root words, &quot;gu&quot; and &quot;ru&quot;. G&quot;u&quot; means &quot;darkness&quot; or &quot;ignorance&quot;, and &quot;ru&quot; means &quot;dispeller.&quot; Therefore, a guru is the dispeller of darkness or ignorance.

==Observances==

=== Hinduism ===
The celebration of Guru Purnima is marked by spiritual activities and may include a ritualistic event, &quot;Guru puja&quot;, in honour of the guru or teacher. 
Gurus are believed by many to be the most necessary part of life. On this day, disciples offer&quot; puja&quot; or pay respect to their guru.
In addition to having religious importance, this festival has great importance for Indian academics and scholars. Indian academics celebrate this day by thanking their teachers as well as remembering past teachers and scholars. Hindu Gurus are revered on this day by remembering their life and teachings. The festivities are usually followed by a feast for the disciples, &quot;shishya&quot;, where the &quot;prasada&quot; and &quot;charnamrita&quot; (nectar of the feet), the symbolic wash of Guru&#x27;s feet, which represents his &quot;kripa&quot; (grace) is distributed.
Special recitations of the Hindu scriptures like the &quot;Guru Gita&quot; are held all day. Apart from the singing of &quot;bhajans&quot;, hymns and of special &quot;kirtan&quot; session and &quot;havan&quot; at many places, where devotees from all over gather at the &quot;ashrams&quot;, &quot;matha&quot; or place where the seat of Guru, &quot;Guru Gaddi&quot; exists. This day also sees the ritual of &quot;padapuja&quot;, the worships of Guru&#x27;s sandals, which represent his holy feet and is seen a way of rededicating to all that a Guru stands for. Disciples also recommit themselves on this day, towards following their teacher&#x27;s guidance and teachings, for the coming year. This day is also seen as an occasion when fellow devotees, &quot;Guru Bhai&quot; (disciple-brother), express their solidarity to one another in their spiritual journey. In Vedic Hindu tradition, the day is celebrated in honour of the sage Vyasa, who is seen as one of the greatest gurus in ancient Hindu traditions and a symbol of the &quot;guru-shishya&quot; tradition. Their recitations are a dedication to him and are organised on this day, which is also known as &quot;Vyasa Purnima&quot;. &quot;Vyasa Puja&quot; is held at various temples, where floral offerings and symbolic gifts are given away in his honour.
Hindu ascetics and wandering &quot;sanyasis&quot; observe this day by offering &quot;puja&quot; to their guru, during &quot;Chaturmasya&quot;, a four-month period during the rainy season, when they choose seclusion and stay at one chosen place; some also give discourses to the local public. Students of Indian classical music and Indian classical dance, also celebrate this festival. 

=== Buddhism ===
The festival is celebrated by Buddhists in honour of the Buddha, who gave his first sermon on this day at Sarnath, Uttar Pradesh, India. In the yogic tradition, the day is celebrated as the occasion when Shiva became the first guru, as he began the transmission of Yoga to the Saptarishis. Buddhists observe uposatha, i.e., to observe eight precepts on this day. Rainy season vassa also starts on this day, lasting for three lunar months, from July to October. During this time, Buddhist monks remain in a single place, generally in their temples. In some monasteries, monks dedicate the Vassa to intensive meditation. During Vassa, many Buddhist lay people reinvigorate their spiritual training and adopt more ascetic practices, such as giving up meat, alcohol, or smoking.

=== Nepal ===
In Nepal, Guru Purnima is a big day in schools. This day is teacher&#x27;s day for Nepalese. Students honour their teachers by offering delicacies, garlands, and special hats called &quot;topi&quot; made with indigenous fabric. Students often organize fanfares in schools to appreciate the hard work done by teachers. This is taken as a great opportunity to consolidate the bond of teacher-student relationships.
==Significance==

=== Hinduism ===
This was the day when Vyasa – author of the Mahabharata – was born to sage Parashara and a fisherman&#x27;s daughter Satyavati; thus, this day is also celebrated as &quot;Vyasa Purnima&quot;. Veda Vyasa did yeoman service to the cause of Vedic studies by gathering all the Vedic hymns extant during his times and dividing them into four parts based on their characteristics and use in rites. He then taught them to his four chief disciples – Paila, Vaisampayana, Jaimini and Sumantu. It was this dividing and editing that earned him the honorific &quot;Vyasa&quot; (vyas = to edit, to divide). He divided the Vedas into four parts, namely, Rig, Yajur, Sama and Atharva.

=== Buddhism ===
Gautama Buddha went from Bodhgaya to Sarnath about 5 weeks after his enlightenment. Before he attained enlightenment, he gave up his austere penances. His former comrades, the pañcavargika, left him and went to Ṛṣipatana in Sarnath. After attaining Enlightenment, the Buddha left Uruvilvā and travelled to the Ṛṣipatana to join and teach them. He went to them because, using his spiritual powers, he had seen that his five former companions would be able to understand Dharma quickly. While travelling to Sarnath, Gautama Buddha had to cross the Ganges. When King Bimbisara heard of this, he abolished the toll for ascetics. When Gautama Buddha found his five former companions, he taught them the Dharmacakrapravartana Sūtra. They understood and also became enlightened. This marked the establishment of the mendicant Sangha, on the full-moon day of Asadha. The Buddha subsequently spent his first rainy season at Sarnath at the Mulagandhakuti. The bhikshu sangha soon grew to 60 members; then, Buddha sent them out in all directions to travel alone and teach Dharma.

=== Jainism ===
According to Jain traditions, special veneration is offered to one&#x27;s gurus and teachers on Guru Purnima. The day falls at the beginning of &quot;Chaturmasya&quot;. On this day, Mahavira, after attaining &quot;kaivalya&quot;, made Gautama Swami his first disciple (&quot;ganadhara&quot;) thus becoming a Guru himself.

<text>The civil service of the People&#x27;s Republic of China is the administrative system of the traditional Chinese government which consists of all levels who run the day-to-day affairs in China. The members of the civil service are selected through competitive examination.

== Civil servants ==
As of 2009, China has about 10 million civil servants who are managed under the Civil Service Law. Most civil servants work in government agencies and departments. State leaders and cabinet members, who normally would be considered politicians in political systems with competing political parties and elections, also come under the civil service in China. Civil servants are not necessarily members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), but 95 percent of civil servants in leading positions from division (county) level and above are CCP members. The vast majority of civil servants remain in the service for their entire careers.

The definition of &quot;civil servant&quot; (), a term formally codified in the 2006 Civil Service Law is often ambiguous in China. Most broadly, civil servants in China are a subset of CCP cadres, the class of professional staff who administer and manage Chinese government, party, military, and major business institutions. More specifically, the term denotes public employees in higher positions of authority; according to academic Yuen Yuen Ang, they &quot;form the elite strata of functionaries in the party-state hierarchy&quot;, in contrast to &quot;shiye renyuan&quot; (事业人员) or &#x27;shiye&#x27; personnel, who are also public employees but are not considered &quot;gongwuyuan&quot;.

The definition of the civil service differs from that of many western countries. Civil servants are &quot;the managers, administrators and professionals who work for government bodies,&quot; including leadership such as the Premier, state councillors, ministers, and provincial governors, among others. It excludes manual workers and many other types of cadre, such as those employed in public service units such as hospitals, universities, or state-owned enterprises, even though those positions are also paid and managed by the government. While not strictly part of the civil service, the judiciary is governed by the same personnel arrangements as the civil service.

== History ==
A professional corps of dedicated bureaucrats, akin to a modern civil service, has been an integral feature of governance in Chinese civilization for much of its history. Part of the motivation was ideological; Confucian teaching discouraged overly involved, warlike, and rowdy rulers alike, making the delegation of legislative and executive authority particularly necessary. During the Zhou dynasty (c. 1046 – 256 BC), records show that kings would send edicts encouraging local officials to identify promising candidates for office in the capital. This practice was intensified under Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141 – 87 BC), who standardized the selection process with the addition of question-and-answer elements on classic texts judged by a panel of scholars. This helped lay the groundwork for the Imperial examination system that would be formed under the short-lived Sui dynasty before being widely adopted thereafter. The examination system and the bureaucracy it engendered would remain in place in some form until the dissolution of the Qing dynasty in 1911.

===Mao-era cadres===
The People&#x27;s Republic of China did not initially maintain a formal civil service like other countries of the era. As the CCP gained ground in the Chinese Civil War against the Kuomintang (KMT), it instead used dedicated CCP cadres to oversee and administer territories it took over. The CCP, at the time of its victory in 1949, faced a serious shortage of qualified personnel to the fill over 2.7 million public positions needed to govern the country that had previously been occupied by KMT-affiliated officials, some of whom the CCP had to allow to continue to work due to lack of suitable replacements. By the mid-1950s, China had developed a nomenklatura system modeled on the Soviet Union; there was no civil service independent of the ruling party.

===Reform===
Following the death of Mao Zedong and the rise of reformist Deng Xiaoping, efforts began to change the cadre system after the discord of the Cultural Revolution so that the CCP would be able to effectively carry out the modernization of China. Reforms beginning in 1984 did not decrease the approximately 8.1 million cadre positions across China, but began to decentralize their management to authorities at provincial and local levels.

Zhao Ziyang, elected General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in 1987, sought to transform the cadre system into a more independent body resembling a civil service. The civil service not completely subservient to the CCP, and thus reform the relationship between the CCP and the state. In the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Zhao and his allies lost their influence among CCP elite and the civil service reform project was denounced by remaining leaders. Zhao&#x27;s proposals were subsequently heavily modified and implemented as the &quot;Provisional Regulations on State Civil Servants&quot; in 1993, albeit on a much less comprehensive scale.

Nevertheless, the Provisional Regulations established the first formal civil service in China since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic.

Since the early 2000s, recruitment quotas for non-CCP members, gender, and ethnic group, have been institutionalized to increase representation of such groups in the civil service.

In 2018, the CCP&#x27;s Organization Department absorbed the State Civil Servants Bureau.

== Levels and ranking system==
The current ranking system has 27 different ranks (from previously of total 15 levels) and a grade () system within each rank (at most 14 grades for each rank) to reflect seniority and performance; a combination of rank and ultimately determine pay and benefits. The highest tiers (including department chiefs, deputy department chiefs, and section chiefs) have significant involvement in policy-making. Within local governments, the highest level decision-makers are typically the CCP committee secretary, the state chief, and party committee members.

The 27 ranks are sub-divisions of 11 &quot;levels&quot;. The following is a non-exhaustive list of party and state positions corresponding to their civil service rank. The list only comprises &quot;leadership positions&quot; (), but not civil servants who are not in leadership positions. Non-leading civil servants can be given high corresponding ranks. For example, an expert or advisor hired by the government on a long-term initiative does not manage any people or lead any organization, but may still receive a sub-provincial rank. Similarly, retired officials who take on lesser-ranked (usually ceremonial) positions after retirement would generally retain their highest rank. Occasionally, officials may hold a position but be of a higher rank than what the position indicates, for example a Deputy Prefecture-level CCP committee secretary who holds a full prefecture-level rank.

==State Administration of Civil Service==
The State Administration of Civil Service was created in March 2008 by the National People&#x27;s Congress. It is under the management of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, which resulted from the merger of the Ministry of Personnel and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security. The function of the administration covers management, recruitment, assessment, training, rewards, supervision and other aspects related to civil service affairs. The administration also has several new functions. These include drawing up regulations on the trial periods of newly enrolled personnel, further protecting the legal rights of civil servants and having the responsibility of the registration of civil servants under central departments. Its establishment was part of the government&#x27;s reshuffle in 2008. It aimed at a &quot;super ministry&quot; system to streamline government department functions.

== Examinations ==
For decades, civil service jobs have been among the top career choices for college graduates. In 1993, the civil service examination and evaluation were established. Generally, more than a million people enroll each year in the civil service examination and success rates are approximately 2%.

An alternative route to civil service other than the examination is the assigned graduates system (&quot;xuandiaosheng&quot;, 选调生), which is available to student cadres who are at least probationary members of the CCP. Through the assigned graduates system, new university graduates enter a program that sends them to grassroots positions like village leadership roles or local Communist Youth League secretaries for a few years. Candidates for the assigned graduates system take written and oral examinations arranged by the CCP&#x27;s Organization Department at its local or provincial levels. The examinations cover public service topics similar to those in the civil service examination, but are generally viewed as less competitive.

Programs similar to the assigned graduate system began appearing in the 1980s but were formalized after 2000.

==Salary and allowances==
There are three main components of civil service pay according to the 2006 pay regulation by the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, namely base pay (基本工资), cost-of-living allowances (津补贴), and bonus (奖金).

<text>Purse Caundle is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southwest England. It lies within the Dorset Council administrative area, about east of Sherborne. In 2013 the estimated population of the parish was 90.

Purse Caundle manor house was built in the 15th century under the instruction of Richard Long, who bought 575 acres of land here in 1428. The manor&#x27;s site was recorded as early as the Domesday Book in 1086, when it was a tenancy of Athelney Abbey.

The village church provides the final resting place for the seventeenth-century physician Nathaniel Highmore, whose father was rector here.

<doc id="1068814" wikidata="Q1554733" url="?curid=1068814" title="Joe L. Evins">
<text>Joseph Landon Evins (October 24, 1910 – March 31, 1984) was an American lawyer and politician who served 15 terms as a Democratic U.S. Representative from Tennessee from 1947 to 1977.

==Early life==
Evins was a native of the Blend Community of DeKalb County, Tennessee, the son of James Edgar Evins and Myrtie Goodson Evins. His father was a Tennessee state senator and a successful local businessman. He was also the namesake of Edgar Evins State Park near Smithville. One of his brother&#x27;s children ran a local bank. Another nephew, Dan Evins, was the founder of the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store restaurant chain.

Evins graduated from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee in 1933 and the Cumberland School of Law in Lebanon, Tennessee in 1934, as well as The George Washington University. He was admitted to the bar in that same year and began practice in Smithville, the county seat of DeKalb County.

==Career==
In 1935 Evins was named a staff attorney for the Federal Trade Commission, and served in this position until 1938, when he was named the FTC&#x27;s assistant secretary, a position which he held until 1940.

Shortly after U.S. entry into World War II, he was commissioned in the United States Army Judge Advocate General Corps, serving on active duty until 1946, when he resumed his law practice in Smithville.

Upon his return, he was also elected chairman of the DeKalb County Democratic Party. Later in that same year, he won the nomination of the Democratic Party for the seat from the 5th District. He won the election easily in this solidly-Democratic area, and was re-elected to fourteen more terms, generally with little or no opposition. His district was renumbered the 4th after the 1950 Census, when Tennessee lost a congressional district.

Evins was a powerful figure in Congress. He was chairman of the House Select Committee on Small Business for six years, and for the following Congressional session of the United States House Committee on Small Business, and served on the important House Appropriations Committee.

He used his influence to make sure that his district, a mostly rural area east and south of Nashville, was well taken-care of; Smithville was the smallest city chosen for participation in the Model Cities Program and its major thoroughfare was renamed &quot;Congressional Boulevard&quot;.

The Tennessee Technological University Appalachian Center for Craft near Smithville was built with a $5 million federal grant that Evins secured as a member of the Appropriations Committee.

Evins, a conservative Democrat, was slow to accept racial desegregation. He signed the 1956 Southern Manifesto and voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968. But Evins voted present on the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. and voted in favor of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Evins decided not to stand for re-election in 1976, after serving a total of 15 terms. At the time of his retirement in January 1977, his continuous service in the U.S. House of Representatives was longer than that of any other House member from Tennessee.

In a spirited primary to succeed him, Al Gore won and began his political career.

==Personal life and death==
His wife, Ann Smartt, with whom he had three daughters, was the daughter of a McMinnville judge.

Evins died in Nashville on March 31, 1984, and is buried in the Smithville Town Cemetery in Smithville.

<text>The Movement of Free Citizens (), also known by its acronym KEP, was a short-lived, right-of-center political party in Greece. It was a personality-driven party, founded and led by Dimitris Avramopoulos. KEP was founded in the early 2000s with the goal of developing a new conservative platform that was different from that of other parties. Despite early public interest, it had trouble gaining a large following. After resigning from the diplomatic corps in 1993, Avramopoulos began his political career within the conservative New Democracy. First a member of the Hellenic Parliament and then Mayor of Athens, Avramopoulos became one of the most popular Greek politicians.

In 2001, the conservative New Democracy party was suffering from many internal problems, notably the continuous conflict between its president Costas Karamanlis and the former Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, and its opposition to the government of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) seemed ineffective. In this somewhat stagnant situation for the conservative right, Avramopoulos decided to step forward and create a party of his own. His personal appeal drove many new people by his side. However, it was clear that KEP&#x27;s main asset was Avramopoulos&#x27; own charisma, who was attracting most of the publicity. Other famous people involved in KEP were &quot;Eliza Vozenberg&quot;, a lawyer who served as the party&#x27;s spokeswoman, and the coroner &quot;Mattheos Tsoungas&quot;. The first polls targeting the Greek voters revealed that KEP&#x27;s percentage in an election would be as high as 24%, something extraordinary and unusual for a new party in Greece. In newer polls, though, the party&#x27;s percentage went on a free fall, and much of the initial enthusiasm faded away.

To his supporters&#x27; annoyance and surprise, in 2002, Avramopoulos unexpectedly terminated KEP&#x27;s existence as a party, pointing at its financial shortcomings as an excuse. He announced that KEP would continue operating as a think tank, and this effectively marked Avramopoulos&#x27; return to New Democracy. Few of KEP&#x27;s members opposed its president&#x27;s decision and stated that they would continue working towards their political goals inside the party and without Avramopoulos. However, all attempts to revive KEP were unsuccessful. Most of the party&#x27;s members followed Avramopoulos&#x27; return to New Democracy, few of them went to PASOK, while some others have remained politically inactive ever since, overwhelmed by disappointment.

<text>Shillingstone is a village and civil parish in the Blackmore Vale area of north Dorset, England, situated on the River Stour between Sturminster Newton and Blandford Forum. In the 2011 Census the civil parish had 479 households and a population of 1,170.

South of Shillingstone is a large area of woodland on Okeford and Shillingstone Hill which forms part of Blandford Forest.

==History==
Shillingstone features in the Domesday Book of 1086 as a settlement of 46 households, with meadow, woodlands and a mill, under the lordship of Ascelin. Its name is a derivation of Eschelling&#x27;s (or Ascelin&#x27;s) town. It once had the tallest maypole in Dorset – high. An agricultural community, it specialised in the production of moss.

In the First World War, it earned the title, &quot;the bravest village in Britain&quot;, because of the high proportion of residents who volunteered to join the armed forces. In 1924 the Shillingstone lime works was started to extract lime from the chalk beds at Shillingstone Hill.

Shillingstone Parish Council meets monthly to discuss planning applications, maintenance of allotments and the local recreation ground, and other local amenities.

==Parish church==
The parish Church of the Holy Rood is a short distance away from the village and is of 12th-century origin, constructed in banded flint and ashlar masonry. It was enlarged in the 15th century and in the 19th century; G. F. Bodley added the north aisle. The font is of the 12th century and the pulpit of the 17th. The hymn writer Edward Dayman was appointed Rector of Shillingstone in 1842. About 165 yards [150 m] south of the church is a medieval cross base.

==Railway station==
Shillingstone railway station still survives intact on the former line of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, now part of the North Dorset Trailway. The station is one of the best-preserved on the Somerset and Dorset line since the railway&#x27;s closure in 1966. It opened on Monday 31 August 1863 and closed just over a century later on Sunday 6 March 1966. 

The station is undergoing extensive restoration by the Shillingstone Station Project, supported by the North Dorset Railway Trust. The village also had a light railway serving Shillingstone House, the postwar home of Sir Thomas Salt.

==Education==
The village has a primary school, affiliated to the Church of England and is also home to independent special school, The Forum School.
Until August 31st, 1997, Shillingstone was the location of the now-defunct girls&#x27; boarding school, Croft House School. The independent Hanford School is also near the village.

==Governance==
Shillingstone is the most populous area of Bulbarrow electoral ward, which extends south to Winterbourne Strickland and had a population of 1,850 in the 2011 census. Bulbarrow forms part of the constituency of North Dorset, which is currently represented in the UK parliament by the Conservative Simon Hoare.

<text>Entergy Corporation is a Fortune 500 integrated energy company engaged in electric power production and retail distribution operations in the Deep South of the United States. Entergy is headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana, and generates and distributes electric power to 3 million customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Entergy has approximately 24,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity, annual revenues of $11 billion and employs more than 12,000 people.

==History==
Entergy traces its history to November 13, 1913, with the formation of Arkansas Power Company. Founder Harvey C. Couch used sawdust from a lumber company to bring electricity to rural Arkansas. In the 1920s, Couch set his sights on buying electric companies in other states. In 1923, he merged four independent companies in Mississippi into Mississippi Power and Light. Two years later, he formed Louisiana Power and Light to provide power to his Mississippi customers from northern Louisiana&#x27;s natural gas fields.

Meanwhile, in 1922, the Electric Bond and Share Company (EBASCO, a subsidiary of General Electric) under Sidney Z. Mitchell merged several competing streetcar and electric utilities into New Orleans Public Service. Mitchell began turning his attention to other territories, and eventually began competing with Couch. The two men ultimately decided to merge their resources. In 1925, Electric Power and Light Corporation was formed, an EBASCO subsidiary headquartered in New Orleans, with Couch as its president. It was the parent company for Mississippi Power and Light, Louisiana Power and Light, New Orleans Public Service, and Arkansas Power and Light.

EBASCO fought the constitutionality of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, losing a Supreme Court case in 1938, and was ordered dissolved under the provisions of that act in 1949. Mississippi Power and Light, Louisiana Power and Light, New Orleans Public Service and Arkansas Power and Light were deemed to be an integrated system, and were reorganized under the control of a new holding company, Middle South Utilities. It changed its name to Entergy in 1989, and merged/bought Gulf States Utilities, based in Beaumont, Texas, as of 12:00 midnight, January 1, 1994.

In the late 1990s, Entergy pursued a strategy of global expansion into unregulated markets, acquiring substantial facilities in Australia, Argentina, and the United Kingdom. Shareholder dissatisfaction with the results of this strategy led to a shakeup of management, culminating with the ouster of longtime CEO Ed Lupberger in 1998. Lupberger was replaced by Wayne Leonard, formerly of Cinergy, who supervised the company&#x27;s disinvestment from overseas holdings.

Since its inception, Entergy has been headquartered in New Orleans. That city had also been home to Entergy&#x27;s various corporate predecessors since 1925. After Hurricane Katrina hit the city of New Orleans in August 2005, Entergy temporarily relocated the 1,500 employees and contractors who worked at the headquarters to other cities, including Clinton, Mississippi, Little Rock, Arkansas, and The Woodlands, Texas. In April 2006, the company began moving back into its New Orleans headquarters.

In 2011, Entergy and Coulomb Technologies, an electric vehicle charging station maker, began to donate free electric vehicle charging stations at 16 sites at college campuses in the southern U.S. Its first installation was at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, and is free to use for faculty and students.

In 2013, Entergy joined the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) as is southern region following an Department of Justice investigation into the company&#x27;s anti-competitive behavior. By joining MISO rather than the Southwest Power Pool, Entergy&#x27;s service areas have limited interconnection to the remainder of the transmission organization, which reduces flow of cheaper electricity into the area. With a integrated power utility business model, Entergy makes money by constructing power plants, reducing the company&#x27;s incentive to build transmission connecting it to other regions. Experts state these capacity contraints result in higher profits for the company at the expense of customers and lower reliability, such as rolling blackouts during Winter Storm Uri in 2021.

==Subsidiaries==
* Entergy Arkansas (formerly Arkansas Power and Light Company (AP&amp;L))
* Entergy Louisiana (formerly Louisiana Power and Light Company (LP&amp;L))
** Entergy Gulf States Louisiana (formerly the Louisiana operations of Gulf States Utilities (GSU)) was merged into Entergy Louisiana in 2015.
* Entergy New Orleans (formerly New Orleans Public Service, Inc. (NOPSI))
* Entergy Nuclear
* Entergy Mississippi (formerly Mississippi Power and Light Company (MP&amp;L))
* Entergy Texas (formerly the Texas operations of Gulf States Utilities (GSU))

==Former subsidiary company logos==

Prior to the use of the current Entergy logo, each subsidiary had its own distinctive logo. Upon the renaming of the company from Middle South Utilities System to Entergy, the present logo was adopted.

Louisiana Power and Light Company, for example (today&#x27;s Entergy Louisiana) used the logo shown at right extensively from about 1967 to 1989, on buildings equipment, and advertising. Each of Middle South Utilities&#x27; subsidiaries used similar-styled logos
==Operations==
Entergy&#x27;s service territory includes the southeast corner of Louisiana and the cities of Lafayette and Baton Rouge, the eastern three-fourths of Arkansas and the western half of Mississippi. It also includes part of southeastern Texas, including the Beaumont-Port Arthur-Orange and Conroe-Woodlands-Kingwood areas.

A member of the Fortune 500, Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 30,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity, and it is the second-largest nuclear generator in the United States after Exelon Corporation. It had annual revenues of more than $11 billion in 2010 and approximately 15,000 employees.

Entergy&#x27;s main operating segments consist of the U.S. utility segment and the non-utility nuclear segment. The U.S. utility segment provides retail electricity services to approximately 2.9 million customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The non-utility nuclear segment owns and operates a total of six nuclear units, and provided support services to one:
*Michigan – Palisades Nuclear Generating Station (closed in spring of 2022)
*Arkansas – Arkansas Nuclear One Units 1 and 2
*Louisiana – River Bend Nuclear Generating Station and Waterford Nuclear Generating Station
*Mississippi – Grand Gulf Nuclear Generating Station
*Nebraska – support services for the Cooper Nuclear Station through 2014, terminated in 2022.

The company&#x27;s nuclear division is headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi.

Entergy operates more than 40 plants using natural gas, nuclear, coal, oil and hydroelectric power with approximately 30,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity to serve its 2.9 million customers in the Gulf South. Its extensive transmission system carries approximately 30,000 megawatts of power across more than of interconnected lines within a area.

Entergy is the only U.S. utility to make the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) nine years in a row. The DJSI is a listing of the companies whose overall environmental, social and economic sustainability performance scores were in the top 10 percent for their sector. Entergy was named in 2008 to &quot;Forbes&quot; list of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Trustworthy Companies&quot;, a ranking based on corporate governance practices and accounting transparency.

On February 24, 2010, the Vermont Senate voted to prevent the Vermont Public Service Board from issuing the necessary certificate that would allow for the Vermont Yankee plant to have its license renewed for another 20 years. The vote will not affect current operation of the plant, and the issue could be revisited by the legislature in either a special session later in 2010 or in its next regular session in 2011.

=== Entergy Texas ===
Entergy Texas operates as a wholly owned subsidiary. This was done to prepare the Texas side for de-regulation under Texas law, but Entergy later notified the Public Utility Commission of Texas that it would not split off the Texas side as a de-regulated operation. Because of this, the Texas side remains connected to the Entergy network; until 2012, it was based on where the former Gulf States Utilities was in Beaumont. Entergy Texas has since moved its operations to The Woodlands.

==New Orleans gas plant astroturf scandal==
In May of 2018, Entergy New Orleans was embroiled in a scandal surrounding its controversial proposal for a natural gas power plant in East New Orleans. An Entergy subcontractor used Crowds on Demand to artificially lobby council support for the gas plant. The New Orleans City Council ended up fining Entergy New Orleans $5 million for this paid actors scandal.

<text>Stour Provost is a village and civil parish in the Blackmore Vale area of north Dorset, England, situated on the River Stour between Sturminster Newton and Gillingham. In old writings it is usually spelled Stower Provost.

Stour Provost once constituted a liberty, containing only the parish itself. Today the civil parish includes the settlements of Woodville and Stour Row to the east. In the 2011 census the civil parish had 235 households and a population of 579.

After the establishment of Stour Provost village near the River Stour, at least four smaller settlements were established in a piecemeal fashion from the 13th century – or perhaps earlier – in the common land or &quot;waste&quot; further east, at Woodville and beyond. These small groups of farms, with their own irregular shaped fields, were separated by unenclosed &quot;waste&quot; probably until the 18th century, when it was enclosed and divided into rectilinear fields.

<text>The Lyulka AL-21 is an axial flow turbojet engine created by the Soviet Design Bureau named for its chief designer Arkhip Lyulka.

==Design and development==

The AL-21 is closely similar in technology to the General Electric J79 first flown in 1955, which was the first engine for supersonic flight, using a variable stator.

It is generally described as being in the &quot;third generation&quot; of Soviet gas turbine engines which are characterized by high thrust-to-weight ratios and the use of turbine air cooling.

The AL-21 entered service in the early 1960s. Later designed the AL-21F3, it was used in the Sukhoi Su-17, Sukhoi Su-24, Ground-attack variant Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23, and Sukhoi T-10 (Sukhoi Su-27 prototype).
